###Data Collection###
1) scraper.py
This crawls the search results for a given Yelp search (for bars), parses the saved raw 
html files and generates a bars_**.json files, where ** stands for neighborhood code. 
Then the reviews for each bar are crawled and saved then parsed generating a single json 
of review-level information for each bar.

2) get_latlong.py
This script takes as input the bars_**.json and finds the latitude and longitude 
coordinates for each bar, returning bars_**_latlong.json

###Cleaning and Analysis###
3) prelim_analysis.ipynb
Currently, this notebook takes as input the bars_**_latlong.json and the associated 
<bar-name>.json files and rates the bars on a scale from 1 - 5 based on the ratio of SF 
reviews to nonSF reviews for the bar.  This analysis will not be used in the final 
product.  This outputs the file bars_**_rated_prelim.json.  The notebook also eliminates
any bars that do not have their complete set of reviews and any bars with fewer than 10
reviews.

4) prelim_analysis-2.ipynb
This notebook takes as input bars_**_latlong.json and the associated <bar-name>.json 
files and evaluates the localness of the bars based on the weighted ave rating by SF 
reviewers versus the weighted average rating by nonSF reviewers, dividing the bars into 
three categories: local, neutral, touristy.  This is the starting point for the true 
analysis.  

###Create database###
5) populate_bars_nb.py
This script takes as input bars_**_rated_prelim.json and populates a PostgreSQL
database called bars_nb.


~/git-demo/front_end/app/
###Build App###
6) views.py
This scripts describes functions that can be called on each page of the app.  It 
connects the PostgreSQL database to the app, as well as describes what should be 
returned when buttons are pushed.
