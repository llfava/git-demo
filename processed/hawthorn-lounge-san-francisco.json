Romantic, glamorous decor 2. High end liquor selection. You get what you pay for when it comes to... Well everything! Haha but know that this is not a dive bar. Everything is top quality and hand crafted.  3. Superior ((VOID)) sound system ** the best in SF hands down- be sure to stand in the middle of the main room at least once before you leave. Trust me, it's incredible to feel the music as well as hear it :) 4. Polished service and staff- very helpful and attentive  6. Gentlemen and ladies; San Francisco's elite 7. Dress nice, dress up, you'll be under a chandelier or two 8. Music really sets the tone- deep, sexy soulful, house music. I've seen an amazing artist selection there since it's opening- Miguel Migs, Fred Everything, Doc Martin, Mark Farina, Colette and Dj Heather  9.Mesmerizing theatrical performers- passionate and unforgettable. And my goodness their costumes are breathtaking - nothing I've ever seen before. Whoever is their designer/ stylist is a true artist and I'd love to meet them! May I please borrow a costume?? 10. Great vibes- everyone's happy &amp; everyone's polite",

You can't quite tell from the outside that it's a club minus the super long line of good looking people. I loved the bouncer's outfit, super retro. The club downstairs and all I can say is that it is HOT! \u00a0  I liked the dance floor and ambiance a lot. There is a second bar if you walk all the way to the right of the club. Btw, the bartenders were awesome! Super nice and not snotty at all. Speakeasy/ Vegas/ New York feel with a good looking mid 20s-30s crowd but without the snootiness. I hate snooty vibes so I like this place, everyone from staff to the attendees were relatively chilled at least on Friday night.... I was having dinner close by on Saturday and was going to stop by to see my sister but ran out of time since we had to be at Harper and Rye for a birthday party. From first glance, I think the Saturday looked a little younger and a little more snooty... but not for the right reasons. :(  Anyways, Our host, Janelle??? was amazing!! She deserves 2 stars alone!!! She was friendly, helpful and just all around fun! She added to our experience and made the birthday boy very happy!!! Both tables had an amazing time and I would definitely come back again. \u00a0Props to the servers who cleaned up the dirty cups quickly! \u00a0  (I overheard there is a cover from someone but I am not sure how much.)",

The venue itself is well-designed and has a great lounge-y vibe, lots of bathroom stalls, and two different rooms, each with their own bar and music - either EDM (Mark Farina is the man) or the Top 40/Hip-Hop DJ in the back - so you have a place to hang depending on what mood you're in.  I was especially pleased with the service we received by the bartenders, our cocktail waitress and the other staff! They were constantly checking on us, getting us what we needed, bussing our table, cleaning up the messes we made when we dropped our drinks (!!), etc.   The DJ in the back room where our table was was not aware of the time (for the countdown to midnight) and played a 6-0 countdown once we showed him our phones that read 12:00am. So that was kind of a bust. Also one of the bussers kept taking away my friend's shot glasses that she wasn't finished with (or so she claims).   All in all, the high-quality service and exceeding of my expectations for last-minute plans warrants a 5-star review! Thanks for a great NYE 2015.",

Don't be fooled by the relaxing environment I'm painting here... Hawthorn comes to life deep in the night with one of the best sound systems in the city. From what I hear they invested heavily into a pulsating nightlife experience. While your heart bumps along to the rhythm of the bass manipulated by the DJ it doesn't feel anything like the usual grimy club.   Come have a drink early in the evening with friends or come later in the evening on the weekends to get your groove on with a good looking crowd... either way it'll be a good night.

PROS  - Great sound system  - Bartenders put out cups and pitchers of water - this was very much appreciated   CONS  - Poor ventilation on main dance floor. There were two dance floors, one main one in the front, and a smaller one in the back. I don't think the air was flowing over the main floor because it was sauna-hot. The rest of the bar was fine though.  - Mediocre music. The main floor DJ was playing some kind of loungy, slow-tempo beats that weren't really good for dancing. I know this place is called Hawthorn LOUNGE, but there's a dance floor and cover that make it more like a club. Sadly, not the music though.  - $20 inflexible cover, despite the fact that I (male) came in with three girls. I can tell you, from personal experience, that many other clubs in the city will waive the cover or give a discount when you come in with more girls than guys. Here, the cashier seemed offended that I would even ask.   - $3 coat check. This is greedy. When you charge a high cover, I think it's unreasonable to charge for coat check. Coat check is to make the customers life easier by not having to worry about their coats/bags while they dance. Making matters worse, the coat check was full when I arrived ~11 PM. Obviously, this means enough people were willing to pay $3 for coat check, but once you've shelled out $20 to get in, it doesn't make sense to not pay $3 for the piece of mind that your stuff will be safe. But like I said, I still think its greedy to try to capitalize on this.",

We definitely had choices but no cab needed, WE WALKED to our next destination..... Enter HAWTHORN.   No Cover Charge, not sure if it was just the night or us, a bunch of HAWT ladies (get it?!)   Here's what we ordered and I sorry if I butchered the names but I thought some of them waas down right clever:  NipSlip. (taste like Horchata with Cinnamon Bourdon). That drink was Amazing. I wish I had one right about now, lol.  Outer Sunset (I forgot what was in it, but it stuck with me) Amaretto Soiree (brings you back to the 90's)  We couldn't help but notice the DJ set up. It was like a Vegas style but more personalable. We danced till our feet hurt, then drank some more. Friendly bartenders and we met the Owners that evening.   I highly recommend HAWTHORN to anyone looking for the hottest lounge in the SF. If I lived closer to downtown, that's be our Happy Hour Spot!

Throughout the night I had complications with the same blonde female bartender, who was completely drugged out of her mind. *After writing this review I noticed other people have had problems with a blonde female bartender as well.*  First encounter: I was taking $10 tequila shots (in case people are just curious of the pricing) with my friends. I went to pick up my lime and as I was reaching for it a blonde female bartender just snatched the limes from beneath me and threw it away. When I looked at her she turned around. So I said, \"Excuse me\" multiple times, but she completely ignored me. Eventually, I got my own limes, no worries right?  Second Encounter: Myndset finally came on and I was so excited. There were two girls in the front and I put my arm around them and said \"OMG aren't you excited for Myndset!\" I get completely PALMED in the FACE, and I almost fell backwards, but caught my balance and just took 7 feet worth of steps back. And guess who it was, the bartender from before. Now, I am not going to fight a random girl and get kicked out, when my favorite DJ just came on. So, I stared at her, waiting for an apology, in complete rage. Her friend looked at me and told her \"Come on.\" and they moved off the dance floor. Of course, I get no apology and since her friend didn't allow her on the dance floor, she decided to keep trying to harass the DJ and his friends behind the turntables. Yes, she was going up to all his friends and making out with them. She was so sloppy drunk and out of control a security guard had to pick her up, as she was kicking her feet like a child, and set her down on a seat away from the crowd. There, she was rubbing her face, legs, and hair, like she was on Ecstasy or something. I don't care if someone is on Ecstasy, not my problem, but why would an EMPLOYEE be that gone, at the place she works at?  At one point, I told the guard that she palmed me in the face and he told me that I shouldn't worry about it. Well isn't that nice.  When this place was closing, she was sitting on the bar, as her fellow coworkers were cleaning up. So is she still on the clock or just being annoying? Or both?  Anyway, if this establishment is going to employ somebody like this, and allow a woman to be that out of control... Wow. No thank you. From all the other reviews it seems like this is a \"classy\" place. There was nothing classy about my experience at Hawthorn Lounge.",

But, depends on what your tastes are. \u00a0(The private party in the back that had better music.) No cover charge for us, but had to have a table to actually sit down. Crowd was mostly Asians, 20s-30s. If you're looking for a hot, new place to come, check this place out.",

Comfortable, velvety seating. There's a cage on what I imagine is the dance floor when it's a Fri/Sat night, which I will come back for. DJ was playing some good tunes. I'm surprised there wasn't a bigger after work crowd.   Going off of the receipt, our bartender was Christina. She was very attentive considering she was the only bartender on duty, big props to her. And her drinks? VERY good. We wanted to get a taste of all that we could handle on their eclectic menu. We had the June and Tonic (very refreshing), Blue Peruvian, #Nipslip, aaaaaaaand I completely forgot what my friend had, it was one their sours. Needless to say, they were all amazing, especially the #Nipslip... it has horchata in it, what?!  I assume their management team was working the floor, making sure everyone was doing okay. Nice guys serving up FREE TRUFFLE POPCORN. How could you not love this place?  Thumbs up to this place, I'll def be back.",

She greeted my friend &amp; I very warmly and made sure hat we were taken care of. Her service was beyond attentive and I'm so happy that she was our bartender because she made the one of the best Hendrick Dirty Martini's. She was very welcoming and even if she was busy, she still made sure that we had cocktails in our hands. S  As far as everything else, the ambiance, the cocktails, the DJ's -- and the kick ass Bartender, Kat - I have to say this place is a great addition to the neighborhood.

However, service directly at the bar was much better, and the venue is new so it may be a case of staff training or the tuning the service workflow they have in place. May be could use a Gordon Ramsey style overseer on the floor to keep things running smoothly! Great potential.",

The servers pay A LOT of attention to the groups making sure we have a good time and get our money's worth. - Beautiful dancers and good music on the weekends. You really can't go wrong if you are looking to have a good time in a venue that is unlike most others.  CONS: - I honestly don't have any! (which is rare for me)",

Walking in was a breeze, got seated at our table right away (near the dance floor), great layout, clean, cool decor and ambiance, didn't have to wait long for a drink (at the bar) and the drinks were not overpriced like other clubs.  Now the music (in the main room): the DJ only played deep underground house music w/ zero vocals. I do enjoy electronic music but tracks that I could actually dance to - hence why I came to a club rather than a bar. I would imagine that an empty dance floor is a good indication to play a different genre of music but the DJ didn't seem to pick up on that. For a club that is in/near Union Square and attracts tourists, I would definitely recommend booking DJs that cater to different types of people.",

There are two comely gents at the doorway though to steer you in the right direction, and the way in, is all the way down. The joint is cozy; rich in dark tones and curious embellishments, i.e. cage contraption just off the dance floor. We got a quick but thorough tour from Chad, a delightful host and Hawthorn partner. I got the impression all the meticulous care in the details, such as the exclusive sound system, Void, is all in place to make sure the ambiance is top-notch and distinctive from any other lounge in the area.",
