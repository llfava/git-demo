The parking is GREAT - I don't think a lot of people know about the Japantown Center garage but parking is $1/hr after 6pm so we literally paid $3 for parking last night instead of having to take the bus or use Uber! Score!  The line was around the block when we got there but we got in maybe 5-10 minutes after the doors opened, so that was a plus. The venue's interior is gorgeous, my friend &amp; I kept admiring the vintage-esque chandeliers!   -1 star for the venue being ALL AGES - there is literally nothing worse than being around drunk high school girls - they're not really old/experienced enough to learn how to handle their liquor (especially in a public setting) but they sure know how to kick the fun out of a simple night...or maybe, I'm just growing into an old, bitter lady at 22! Sorry, I also just had to be the one out of everyone to voice my opinion loudly to one drunk teenage girl in particular....(she knocked her elbow against my head &amp; then started grinding up against me). Um, HELLO little girl, we don't know each other like that! Class, not ass please.....at least not when the concert hasn't even started &amp; there's no music playing.....lol.  I also think the waitresses handing out the water bottles throughout the crowd is a really horrible idea. A lot of people get the idea of following right behind these ladies in an effort of cutting through the crowd to get to the front. I had A LOT of people try and force their way past me...I say \"try and force\" because hell no, I'm 4'11\" and I'm not gonna let anything else obstruct my already-limited view of the stage! It's not really fair to the people who have endured the two hours of sound checks and opening acts just to have a bunch of inconsiderate people try to creep their way through five minutes before the headliner starts.  The venue hands out free posters of the night's concert when the show is over!",

Left with a FREE poster in hand Mellow crowd lovin' the beats Oh, can't wait when she's back in April 2010! Red apples, chandeliers, great view of the stage Enjoyed my first show at this small and wonderful venue  *~* I M O G E N \u00a0H E A P *~*  I have to confess, I didn't know how to properly pronounce the name of the performer until the day of the concert! Yes, I'm quite embarrased. -.- So to get some things straightened out, it's Imogen Heap (pronounced imoJEN... not imoGAN) ahaha The name might not sound familiar to you at first, but think Frou Frou and Garden State! She has an English accent, has crazy awesome hair, and has a unique voice when she sings.  The Fillmore: It's quite a small venue, kind of reminds me of House of Blues on Sunset in LA. Very nice crystal chandelier lights hanging from the ceiling!! Loved the dark painted walls! Bars and benches along the walls. Upper balcony seating only on one side of the venue. Coat check in (I think you have to pay). A huge basket of red delicious apples await you at the top of the stairs as you enter. When you exit, get yourself a nice souvenir (a FREE Fillmore poster of the concert)!!  The concert: It was awesome! I've not paid for many concerts in my life. It's quite sad. I've either won tickets or was on a list to get in for free. Probably this is the second concert I've actually had to pay for. First one was a Matchbox 20 concert at the Staples center in LA way back in high school. O_O So about this concert... I LOVED the stage decor! It looked like a winter wonderland! This giant white wooden tree that lights up! The backdrop had the same silhouette of the tree. Grand piano on stage was transparent with a feathered boa inside! The cellist's chair was made of white fur too! And cool blue lighting! The opening acts were great! They were also incorporated into Imogen Heap's main concert! My favorite act was the cellist Zoey! Loved her dreads! Overall, I just couldn't believe how close we wer to the performers on stage! \u00a0The crowds was great! Very calm, mellow, civilized group. Thank goodness for no crazy mosh pits, loud-blasting-screaming music! O_O I could still hear very well after the concert!  The ugly: The only annoyance was the security guy on the floor who kept try to get through the crowds of people who were taking picture with flash or recording the concert. You're enjoying the moment and some old guy in a hawaiian shirt (and a bit smelly) =X tries to push through in front of you every few minutes! OMG, come on! They should've announced in while you were entering the venue not to do those things.  Getting there: From our friend's house, we took the cab from Civic Center for about $7 each way.  Left Mountain View: 5pm Got into SF: 6:14pm (traffic was horrible) Fillmore: 7pm The Fillmore: 7:45pm (doors opened @ 7pm) Opening act: 8pm Imogen Heap: 9:15pm- midnight Got back to Mountain View: 12:45am  Tips... - Try not to bring too much stuff with you (leave your big purses at home) - Don't bring a jacket, it's going to get HOT inside - Bring a water bottle, you might get dehydrated... or even pass out (someone did that evening) - Wear comfy shoes if you plan to stand the whole time on the main floor - Grab yourself an apple when you're there if you get hungry!",

Don't know who does the sound checks, but I found it very hard to hear the singers because the other instruments were turned up way too high.  4. Odd food smells...where are these coming from?

Average drinks and bar food. Amazing music history with 50 years of show posters all over all the walls. But, still. If it were a craphole and Justin Beiber were playing, all the Belieber fanatics would flock there anyway.   Not that Beiber would play the Fillmore.

The size of the venue was large enough to accommodate hundreds of fans, and with the stage being small and elevated at a good height, plenty of people were able to crowd around it and take pictures, and pretty girls were able to just get up onto the stage.   The lighting and acoustics were also amazing and really added to the experience. I'm not able to give it a full 5 stars because of the number of crazy drunk ass people there and the lack of security helping out. Usually at most concerts you'll see a couple bouncers or guards watching out for everyone, but during this concert where N*E*R*D encourages people to \"go ape shit and just SHOVE the people next to you as hard as you can!\" things got a little crazy.   The only other problem I had was that I wasn't of age yet so I couldn't try out the drinks. Not sure if it was a full bar or just beer, but everyone had a beer and it looked like it would hit the spot in the steamy hall. Oh yeah, there were also waitresses walking around the dancefloor selling drinks! I thought that was unique to a concert.   So aside from the low security, this concert was almost perfect.

Needless to say, we got drunk, and Millencolin rocked like none other. \u00a0  We must have been on some sort of high (or an actual high, I can't remember) but after Millencolin's set, we decided to use those backstage passes. \u00a0  Drunk ass Archie comes screaming in like a coked up manager who has known the band for years and hugs every member of the band, raids the little food setup they had (I just really remember Doritos), gets his picture taken with the band, and leaves.  To this day I like to picture Millencolin sitting \u00a0on their tour bus talking about that night in SF when that weirdo barged in and all of them swearing it's one of the other band mate's cousin that none of them can remember. \u00a0  Evening #1 on my all time list?  Let's just say that it involved one case of beer, a 1994 Defender 90, a bottle of 10W30 motor oil, two fishing poles, a swatch watch, three water balloons, and 6 \"day old\" apple fritters. \u00a0  Family.",

But I don't like my shoes sticking to the floor because there is too much beer on it.   The last time I was there someone asked the greeter if he could go to his car to \"medicate.\" \u00a0The Fillmore has a policy of not letting people come and go. \u00a0The coat check is similar, once you check something, you've checked it for the night. \u00a0  What is really cool, though, is being close enough to the performers to really see them, all of their gestures and facial expressions. \u00a0And I think they like the coziness of the Fillmore too.",

The bass was a continuous rumble that destroyed the articulation of the bass lines and wiped out the higher frequencies. \u00a0To be honest, it was nearly impossible to discern a single bass note. \u00a0As a bass player, I was psyched to hear Eric Coomes lock in with Adam. \u00a0You could see that the band was tight as hell, but the subtle syncopations of the funk were completely washed out. \u00a0The mix sounded like it was set up for soulless EDM, not the organic articulate funk of Lettuce. \u00a0Please kill the subs!! \u00a0 Beautiful room with lots of history. \u00a0Unfortunately the sound quality is of little concern.",

I've seen quite a few shows here and the sound has always been top-notch. You feel like you're very close to the action here as there are no bad sight-lines and the lighting system illuminates the stage very well. Besides these technical aspects there is also the feeling of being apart of a greater musical history when you're here. All the posters on the walls (too many pics of The Grateful Dead if you ask me. I mean I get it. The Dead played here a lot) and the nice guy who greets you at the top of the stairs (albeit after the real nasty guy who \"controls\" the line outside) makes you feel like you're at some place really special. The drinks here are pricey but let's face it, they're going to be expensive at most live music venues so the fact that this club actually has kind servers who make their way into the tightly packed crowd with a tray full of drinks and somehow find you to drop off your order is very impressive and worth the extra cash. With a mostly friendly staff and a consistently great line up of artists, this is and remains one of my favorite live music venues.",

P. had been here many times and gave me the tour: -- I liked the upstairs lounge, where live music is played before the opening band hits the main stage. So you're pretty much guaranteed access to music during your entire time here, if you want. -- I loved checking out all the posters of all the great shows over the years. -- I liked the huge, slightly springy main floor and all the chandeliers  Once the show started, we squeezed up front and stayed there. The opening band was really fun, and Bob put on a great show too. \u00a0The sound was not overly loud but it was a bit muddy (I suspect this was the band mixer's fault, not the club's). \u00a0  One thing that surprised me was the ubiquitous servers taking drink orders everywhere, even within the press of the crowd on the main floor. But then again, they make about $7 of profit on each beer, so I guess I shouldn't be all that surprised.  We had a great time overall, and on the way out they handed us a Fall schedule poster.

    "review_text": "The Fillmore is a live music venue that is absolutely saturated with history and is really one of the best venues in the Bay Area. \u00a0  They have big coolers of water and cups placed at the end of the bars on both floors, as well as a big bowl of (free) apples. \u00a0The interior is decorated with all the posters from shows over the last 40 years or so, walls painted in rich dark red hues. \u00a0The main floor area is actually pretty big - but not so big that you can't see the band on stage. \u00a0There's also a coat check that is very efficient and well run.  All that said - I have to confess that the Fillmore has not always been my favorite venue for live music. \u00a0Often the acoustics and sound are so overpowering that I can't really hear what the singers are singing. \u00a0This was especially the case with a Halloween 1998 performance by The Residents in 1998 -- but completely the opposite for a Billy Bragg acoustic show in November 2000. \u00a0  I've been vexed by muddy vocals more often than not - and left disappointed by the size of the crowds generally, preferring The Great American, The Independent (aka The Justice League) and for bigger acts - the now defunct Maritime Hall. \u00a0Let's not even talk about the Warfield - I just can't stand that place!  My most recent experience at the Fillmore was for a Yonder Mountain String Band show - I first saw this band in 2001, and that show was full of long haired hippies with dreads, blue eyes and shiny straight white teeth, all wearing long skirts, dancing in spinning circles like dervishes. \u00a0This show was completely different - sort of nouveau hipster blue grass chic with lots of scruffy beards, plaid shirts and narrow leg pants. \u00a0The acoustics for this show were much improved over the last show I attended there -- I could understand everything that the vocalists were singing at the front of the room (not just the back by the sound board as with many shows).  It's hit or miss - The Fillmore is definitely one of the more popular places to see big shows, but be prepared with cash for the coatcheck lady and ear plugs.",

I think so because on more than one occasion, I have seen security people grab concert goers who were using a camera or recording a song on their cell phones. I have also seen them push people out of the way to keep the \"aisles\" (aka access to the bar) clear. And, when a fight broke out next to me at a show, the security people pretty much did nothing. What's the point of security then I ask you?   Anyway, I really like the Fillmore as a venue. It's historical, good lines of sight, smallish size, and pretty darn good acoustics. However, some things, including the security, make it so I can't give the venue 5 stars. I don't like the fact that the tickets are sold through Ticketmaster for a ridiculously high markup (or at the box office if you want to brave it on show nights or Sunday mornings). I also don't like the fact that they seem to be doing away with the posters (last four shows and not a one!). However, god bless those cocktail waitresses who have to weave their way through drunken revelers while carrying a full tray of drinks and looking for someone who has changed positions to get a better view.",

The history alone of the Fillmore is reason enough to spend a little extra money on a show.   Besides the rich history, It's strikingly beautiful inside and has several different areas. The upstairs balcony seats, to me, are the best place to watch a show from. It can be tough to get there first, though. Theres a big side-room with hundreds upon hundreds of framed fillmore posters on the walls dating back 50 years. It houses another bar and sometimes has a small band playing as well.   The sound is fantastic and the lights are always great. Sold out shows are crowded, obviously, but not too much so, they have limited the number of occupants perfectly. Drink prices are what you'd expect, and parking is pretty difficult sometimes so be sure to go earlier than you intended.  So glad to have The Fillmore nearby, and I always look forward to seeing shows at this historical, gorgeous venue.",

Been here five times now. \u00a0Once in 8th grade to see Weird Al with my mom, once in high school for Lowell's winter ball, twice for the Sounds, and last night for theSTART.  This was great fun. \u00a0We went upstairs to the lounge overlooking Geary for a bit before the headliners, and aside from the $5.75 Red Tail, it was quite nice up there. \u00a0No lines, lots of seating available, and the bartenders were nice. \u00a0When we heard screaming downstairs, we headed down. \u00a0We were pretty much at the back of the floor , and we could still hear and see quite well, even the wee tiny ones I was with. \u00a0Sounds was good, as were sightlines. \u00a0My only complaint was that we seemed to be directly beneath an AC vent. \u00a0I actually had to put my hoodie back on. \u00a0Oh, and I almost forgot- roving waitresses on the floor! \u00a0I didn't even have to move to get beer (though I did have to flag down my wayward waitress when I saw her in the crowd wandering around meekly repeating \"Red Tail...? \u00a0Red Tail?\"). \u00a0At the end of the show, you get that show's poster, which will be a nice addition to my bare yellow walls. \u00a0I look forward to the next show I get to see here.  Minus one star for having to pay $34 total to pick up a $20 ticket at will call. \u00a0I suppose it's not the Fillmore's fault per se, but it's still part of the experience. \u00a0The Fillmore being in ClearChannel's hands may be disappointing, but its fate is a lot rosier than that of The Matrix.

Classic setting, well run, decent sound and not too crowded. \u00a0I have been there a handful of times and will go again.  At the Anvil show in 2010, I accidentally activated the flash on my camera. \u00a0As soon as I flashed, a security \"guard\" grabbed me and said if I did that again, he would take my camera. \u00a0I apologized and all was cool. \u00a0As we were standing there a guy walked right by us smoking a pot pipe - the guard didn't say a word. \u00a0Only at the Fillmore - flash photography will get you kicked out but smoking pot (in a city where smoking anything indoors is outlawed) is ok. :)   gotta love it.  What I like about the Fillmore: - not too big, so even if you stand near the back to avoid the crowd by the stage you are still close enough to the band - they don't oversell tickets - I have been to several sold-out shows that were not overly crowded - the history - between bands go into the bar/dining area on the top floor and check out the cool concert posters lining all the walls - 3 bars - so the line is never too long to get a drink - a kitchen - for the munchies, and the food is not half bad - friendly staff - mostly, anyway. \u00a0Yes there are some grumps, but you would be grumpy too if you had to deal with 100 people every night telling you that they were friends of the band, knew Bill personally, and the other lines they say to get access to areas where they aren't supposed to go. - they have a coat check - if you are walking here you will likely have a coat to check - the little things - like giving you apples when you leave (or arrive for some shows), or giving you a concert poster to take home with you.  Another nice touch - we went to the Monday night Willie Nelson show when he was in town in January. \u00a0In the upstairs room they had a bluegrass band playing before the show as well as between the opening band and Willie. \u00a0They didn't have to have them, there were already 2 bands playing. \u00a0It was a nice touch and they were quite enjoyable.  What I don't like about the Fillmore (a short and obvious list): - ordering spirits or a cocktail is a rip-off - over priced for a small amount. Stick with the beer, still pricey for beer in a plastic cup but better than the hard liquor. - bathrooms - small and always a line  I am sure there are a few more things I don't like about the Fillmore, but the contact high put me in a happy mood and made me forget the negatives.  So for any \"medium\" name bands reading this, you should tell your manager that the next time you are coming through SF, book you at the Fillmore for a couple nights. \u00a0You may not make a ton of money, but your fans will love you for it.",

The venue was more spacious than I expected. The floor vibrations are a little unnerving though; it feels likes it'll give out at any moment. Didn't really get a chance to explore more, but I know it's a great music hall that showcases awesome bands of various genres. It's very close to the Japanese Center parking garage.

Well, I finally returned for the first time since April 2008...and creature of habit that I am, I came back for the same band, Brit-hop ensemble Morcheeba. The last time I saw them here, there was no sign of Skye Edwards, the effervescent singer who bopped with conviction in the contagious video for \"Rome Wasn't Built in a Day\". Just a French girl singer who sounded like she had one too many.   So imagine my glee to find that Skye has reunited with the Godfrey boys for this tour. Looking resplendent in her own self-designed pink frock, she was a major delight singing Morcheeba's hits with energetic abandon, while Ross Godfrey was showing impressive chops on guitar (see photos). What can I say? That trio makes me happy. I swing my arms up like a buxom Texas cheerleader and dance almost as good as the Bee Girl in the old Blind Melon video. Jamie W. was not overly embarrassed by my faux-hipster behavior since he was doing some swingin' himself.   Just love this space even though sitting is at a premium. Standing is your only option even if you come for the opening bands, which we did and regretted. Terrible. A tuba doesn't belong on a Fillmore stage, but who cares? We could sit in the lounge upstairs with a beer (see photo) or just hang at the bar downstairs (see photo). But when Morcheeba came on, it was a sea of bodies writhing in rhythm, and this whale was maneuvering through the waves...oh wait, that's me. The band played for at least 100 minutes, but my God, where's my song? Dammit, they fooled me again. It was their last encore...   \"You and me, we're meant to be  Walking free in harmony  One fine day, we'll fly away  Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day...\"",

An old ballroom with a big stage up front and everyone just packs in and dances, jives, and has a great time. The crystal chandeliers are a nice touch.   In the front are pictures of hundreds of bands who have played the Fillmore over the years. I spent a long time looking at all of them and just pondering the history.  The medicinal herb smoke in the air, the intimacy of a small venue such as this, and knowing that the worlds best bands have all played here makes the Fillmore one of the top places to see a show in America.",

AND THE BEST PART OF IT ALL WAS THAT ON THE WAY OUT YOU GET A FREE POSTER OF THE SHOW.  soooo sick. amazing care, the best venue. the best.",

I love the Fillmore's rich history, the intimacy of the smallish venue and ease of access via public transit (and parking if you're willing to walk a few blocks on questionably lit sidewalks). Staff is friendly and helpful. The guy checking IDs actually looks at the birthday and wished me a happy belated! If they don't have a female working security they won't pat women down at the door. They give out free posters for sold-out shows, which is awesome.  However, I'm not sure how many more shows at this venue I have in me. The drinks are strong but pricey per ounce and the crowds can get obnoxious getting up and down the tiny staircase or through the main floor to get a drink or use the restroom. I'm a short-ish person and it drives me nuts that there's nowhere for me to go but all the way to the back wall if I want to see the entire band. Venues like the Warfield or Fox at least have tiered railings on the GA floor. If you can't alter the main floor, maybe could you raise the stage by a foot or so?   Overall, I'm on the fence about this place. There's really great things about it, but I think I will have to *really* like the performer to see another show here.",

The Fillmore is a somewhat small theatre which makes for an intimate setting...especially when you're front row (which we were). They are quite strict on photos, so make sure to stow away your phone unless you want it taken away. Parking is a bit of a pain, but there was a garage a few blocks away which wasn't so bad. All in all, it was a wonderful night and I will definitely take in another show here. I didn't have the privilege to take home an apple or even a poster...mainly because we were too busy getting guitar pics from the roadies.

Before I get to the main dish let's just say this place is everything everyone has written about, so there's not much more i can say but..give me more of that Good Stuff.  Getting to the show..the appetizer of the night was a sweet little band called HoneyHoney, a melodic fusion of soulful folk-rock who got the crowd pumped for the \u00a0heat of meat that was to come. Beautiful songs which included one of my fav's called \"Thin Line\" had a profound effect, but unfortunately there were no more of their cd's to buy. Oh Well..Next Time! \u00a0  Enter James Morrison and his ever-so talented band..(GUYS WITH ACCENTS WHO SING GREAT ARE SO HOT!) in his brown leather jacket,white symbol-embedded T, and jeans looking quite comfortable, but yet oh so fab that he had the men in the room swooning too(including heterosexuals..lol) The voice is incomparable to any singer-songwriter I've heard in his genre so far and I've heard and seen plenty. Deep feeling is put into every word uttered from this man and he was worth every dollor I spent to come and see him and more! Ladies and gentlemen if you ever get a chance to see J.

I had never been to The Fillmore, so I stopped in here on Yelp to check it out and get an idea of what to expect. The reviews sounded good, so I was in! Unfortunately, I hadn't read any reviews about seated shows at The Fillmore. Tosh was a seated show, turned out. The cheap plastic chairs were horribly uncomfortable for 3 hours of sitting and were so close together there was minimal leg room and the kid sitting next to me literally sat on me when he took his seat.   The in-house bars closed promptly at 7:30, leaving several people who had been waiting 5 or 10 minutes in line stranded without a drink. The outdoor bar was still open, but was in the smoking lounge. Not an ideal place to wait for a drink if you're a non-smoker. I had read that the drink prices were exorbitant, but actually thought $9 for a 24 oz. tallboy was pretty reasonable. So they get one point there, but lose it again when you consider a VERY small well cocktail was $7-8.  The uncomfortable chairs were arranged such that you had to do a little bobbing gopher move throughout the entire show to catch a glimpse of the headliner through the people sitting in front of you. The people making out in front of us through the entire show (yes, at a comedy show) made these occasional glimpses even more difficult to catch.  The venue itself is really cool looking and is perfect for a more \"intimate\" show. Tosh even commented on how many cool chandeliers there were in the building and that there must've been a sale at Ikea. I would imagine for a non-seated concert it would be a lot better since there wouldn't be horrible plastic chairs involved and being tall would have its advantages. Parking is definitely a non-issue and we got in and out easily, which was a big plus.  Overall The Fillmore is a cool theater, but avoid seated shows here! Your butt will thank you.",

I have to say that the sound at the Fillmore is horrible. \u00a0 The atmosphere is ok, and, the bar service is questionable. \u00a0Let's just say I nearly got thrown out of the show once because I asked the bartendress what the appropriate standing distance was in order to watch the concert from near the bar area.

In my recent experience with the Fillmore (which hasn't been recent at all), tickets sell out so fast it's headspinning. The place is small enough that you can hear and enjoy the music at any point in the venue.   Here, concert-going is an experience. It's about the whole room being into the music and the performer. Since the venue is small, not that many big artists go here a lot and if they do,sometimes it's at the point where they are about to break it big, and this is their last tour before you have to shell out the big bucks to see them as a tiny little speck at the Bill Graham Civic Center or the Greek Theater. Also, there's a history here that makes seeing a concert here so special - they've been playing concerts here since ... well, forever.   Whatever it is that's so special about the Fillmore, if you get the chance to see a favorite artist play here - I say go. It's the best opportunity you'll get to see an artist play (and you won't even have to break the bank to do it). It'll spoil you for concerts, and leave you wondering why all concert venues aren't like the Fillmore.",

Buyers beware!! The VIP seating is not that. It gets you 3 hours of standing room only. I politely engaged everybody in the place including the site manager.

I went to see the Butthole Surfers last night, 12/30. \u00a0The sound REALLY SUCKED. \u00a0I'm a big fan of bass frequencies, but this is all the front of house mixer seemed to want in the mix. \u00a0I stood in several spots and never found a good sound. \u00a0Most of the detail in the Surfers' sound is in the mid range. \u00a0Paul Leary's guitar was lost most of the time. \u00a0Gibby Hayne's vocals (while obviously highly effected) were barely audible. \u00a0I just have a hard time paying $50 for a ticket (after all the wonderful \"convenience fees\") in 2008 for bad sound. \u00a0The equipment is too good now, and there are many qualified sound engineers. \u00a0Essentially the Surfers sounded better at the dive club I saw them at in Dallas in '87.  To be fair, this could have been the Surfers' FOH mixer's fault, but my friends told me that the last few shows they've seen there were boomy and muddy as well. \u00a0That's too bad, as I've heard great sound there.  Also, the service fees to buy tickets are just plain stupid. \u00a0This may also not be the Fillmore's thing, but seems like one corporation may essentially own the venue and the ticket company??

    "review_text": "OK, as far as a concert venue goes, the Fillmore is an awesome *building* and has a nice small sized *stage*, HOWEVER having just been there to see Duran Duran (07/07/09), I can tell you the Fillmore staff are some of the rudest people I have ever met.   It's true they do these great commemorative posters that are limited, which is what they don't tell you. They make 1000 only no matter how many they know are attending the concert. I went to the show having spent more $ on the ticket to be up close and ended up right next to someone who paid 1/3 or 1/4 the ticket price I did. Fine, that's disappointing, I got over that. But coming out of the venue is so hard with these 2 small doors and so since I was in front, naturally I'm one of the last few to come out. A small part of the reason I went all that way (from Las Vegas) to see the show there was the poster and they were gone. I asked the staff where they were and they just said \"All gone.\" I was quite upset about this and was given no sympathy like, \"Hey, sorry they only make 1000.\" No. It was complete rudeness about telling me to get out of the way. I said innocently, \"I drove 10 hours to get here and paid $350 for my ticket and I don't get a poster? Surely, there has to be ONE just lying around?\" The response was, \"I don't care where you came from or HOW much you paid, get the F (not what he said) out of the way, NOW.\" I was so shocked at how rude this doorman was to me. I just stood there dumbfounded. Then I stooped to his level and called him an expletive. Eventually, because I just stood there and wouldn't leave, he sent me back inside just to get me out of the way, where I asked around to several staff members about the poster and was shunned at every turn. Even the t-shirt seller was rude about having to repeat herself once again about the poster.   I tell you the venue alone would be GREAT if the staff actually cared about their customers which keep them in business and in this bad economy how nice it must feel for them not to care at all about their patrons' feelings or whether they return (I have actually been there before, but never again now). There's more where that came from, right? More suckers going in and coming out without the poster and staff telling them to shove off belligerently.  The reason I know they knew how many people were going to be in attendance is a) ticket sales (obviously), but also b) Duran Duran's fan club didn't even get some for their office. They told me that The Fillmore knew how many were coming and purposely didn't make enough. Yes, Duran Duran'd fanclub *should* have secured enough for their ticket holders, but the Fillmore should have made enough.  Now, even that wouldn't be such a big deal if they told people ahead of time only 1000 are made and were NICE to people who didn't get it. You just cannot be in business and not be nice to your patrons! I haven't been treated so badly at a venue since I was in New York City (no surprise there) but in 1990! It's time for the staff at the Fillmore to go through some customer service training. I should know; I have been in customer service for 20 some years.",

I had previously paid upwards of $250 to see them at the HP in San Jose, and I hated the restriction of staying in my seat. Even if it was the 5th row center stage area. Not here! I got in relatively early and I merely stayed standing close to the stage, and I loved the view, which was so much less than the other price tag. *sigh* Pharrell crooning to me from that close was beyond a dream come true. =P  The show ended a little after midnight. I wouldnt recommend hanging around to wait for a bus. The cabs came pretty frequently and I got home exhausted, but exhilarated from the concert.",

Three generations of this Bay Area family LOVE The Fillmore. And we still go all the time. I was just there for Sonic Youth and Sic Alps and it was FANTASTIC! I've been to well over twenty-thirty (if not more) shows here and it is probably my favorite SF venue. A stroll through the halls to check out all the past show posters is worth the visit alone. I don't know how many awesome posters I have from shows here. And I always appreciate the fruit they give out to their guests. Way to retain the hippy vibe!   I saw Johnny Cash with Rev. Horton Heat and Ted Hawkins here. I think it has to be the best show I've ever been to in my life. Some guy in the audience was drunk and loud and Johnny said, \"That's alright, I remember my first beer, too, son\". CLASSIC!   The sound is usually SPOT ON. It's a big, cavernous venue so I know it can be hard getting the right levels but they do a fine job. Be prepared to stand because there aren't really many places to sit down except for upstairs or against the walls where you can't really see anything. If they have food going the night you're there, you can get some decent grub for a reasonable price. Not totally reasonable, but considering the \"captive audience\" factor, you could do much worse. The drink prices are a bit steep for what you get but I just chalk it up to the \"night out\" budget and let it go.   If you've never been to the Fillmore, you're missing out. This is truly a gem in the crown of what makes SF special. I've never been to a \"bad\" show here EVER.",

If you wanna sit, go upstairs, if you wanna drink look in any direction and there is a bar so you don't have to spend the whole concert in a line missing your favourite song. When I was there last this douchebag looking guy walked up the stairs with his arm candy and demanded to know \"where's the bar at?!\" and the man with the 'stache that meets and greets at the top of the stairs, \"Welcome to the Fillmore! Enjoy the show!\" he told the dude to look in any direction, go through any door and he'd find the bar. I thought it was funny... obviously Douche &amp; Arm candy were new to this fine establishment. I love love love when they have the apples, cause usually I get really thirsty and hungry after dancing and standing and drinking for so long that the apples just quench everything in me that needs quenching. Plus, when they have the posters, those are the best souvies! If I wanna dance, I gotta dance! And here at the 'mo I can do just that. I swing my arms furiously as the Violent Femmes strum so vigorously to \"Blister in the Sun\". I feel like there is no reason to not be yourself here which I think is important for concert-going. Even if there are some puffs of smoke in the sea of fans nobody minds and everyone minds their own business... you don't have to worry about being shanked, shivved or mauled inside the Fillmore (unless you want to), it's so full of love and history...  I suggest if you get there early, to check out the band in the upstairs bar lounge, it's always a fun atmosphere with up-and-coming artists, loads of posters to keep any A.D.D.-kid captivated for hours... I wish the drinks were cheaper, but still decent for SF - maybe pack the flask if you have a sneaky pocket to put it in! On that note, BRING CASH! Or succumb to the evil charges of a non-bank ATM fee... boooo...  AND, this may be important if it applies to you, but if you are handicapped or bringing someone who can not climb stairs, just call in advance and they are SUPER accomodating and you'll get a table and everything reserved for you.",

Even Free Blood made our bodies move. Fantastic. Saw them last year at The Fillmore and they were equally awesome. GirlTalk was another danceable show, perfect for this venue.

But the sound quality is never really very good. One show in particular was played so loud the clipping was quite obvious on the massive speakers. Or maybe the clipping was in my ears. In any case, there's been a random clicking in my left ear ever since. Like when you yawn, except I'm not yawning and those noises aren't real noises. Not cool.  But I still go back sometimes--wearing musician's earplugs so I can actually hear the music properly if they decide to make it stupidly loud again. Unfortunately, with or without musician's earplugs, the sound is never very good. Not sure if it's the venue's fault or the sound engineers'.",

When you first walk in the doors and up the stairs, you're surrounded by photographs of past acts, from Johnny Cash to Radiohead. Be sure to grab one of the free red apples at the top of the stairs. The auditorium itself has a simple setup, with just a few tables lining the walls, leaving the majority of the floor standing-room only. Gorgeous crystal chandeliers dangle from the ceiling, dappling light on the deep red walls. Upstairs, there is a mezzanine level where the walls are covered, floor to ceiling, with copies of the kaleidoscopic posters that are sometimes given out gratis after performances.",

One of the biggest drawbacks for me at least, is that it's a bit out of the way, after the show is over it's late at night and you can't just walk down to the bart station, you have to either wait for the bus or catch a cab, however, a lot of time it is worth going a little further when you want to see your favorite bad. Another thing is the setting, while I enjoy the smaller venues, the Fillmore packs everyone together, though they do have a seating area on the balcony, there aren't enough seats to accommodate a lot of people, and when the pit gets crazy, you can find yourself either being dragged in or assaulted. I do enjoy coming here but the Warfield is more convenient. The memories I've taken away from the Fillmore make me a fan of it.",

I'm not one to give credit for tradition, so if that's what the high ratings are for, that's rough.  I'm not saying it's a bad spot. I like it just fine. I saw Aziz Ansari here and would be happy to see another comedy show here. But, it's an average venue for comedy shows. Here's why   1) The seating was average. They brought in plastic chairs like we were at a high school graduation. I'm guessing that is because it's a concert hall and they want open space for people to dance, which is fine, but this review is for a comedy show, and I'd prefer to sit in a real chair at a real table.   2) Sub Par food and Drinks. I'm fine with event pricing, but $10 for a draft Bud Light in a plastic glass? Even AT &amp; T Park only charges 8.50, and I could get Blue Moon there. The girls in our group paid $16 dollars for a double vodka soda with grapefruit, and it came out in a small plastic cup that also looked like it came from a high school graduation party. So that sucks. Also, our waitress recommended the Nachos, because they were \"great for sharing\". Yeah, not really. There was about 20 cheap tortilla chips on a paper plate with some melted cheese and pre-packed guacamole. The nachos at On The Border are better.  Overall, i'd go see any good show there, but I'd skip the drinks (they didn't have a minimum, which I respect) and buy Take-out food from DOSA across the street, which is fantastic.",

Parking was really tough to find, but luckily one of my friend, Nick told me to park at the Kubuki parking structure. So damn cheap! I parked from 7-11? And I ended up paying about 5 bucks? No need to go discuss that further more. Again my friend told me that finding the Fillmore would be a little hard to find and it was. It was very low-key but once you stepped in, it was very nice and regal looking. It was an open dance floor when I went so I was able to stand so close to see Clean Bandit. One thing that I didn't like was how it wasn't ventilated or air conditioned so when it was later into the concert I was sweating bullets. The bass and the amount of people moving around literally shook the dance floor and that was a crazy experience. Water bottles were about $4, I didn't get to look into other drinks though. The waitresses were really nice and the crowd was really respectful of one another and gave the waitresses space to maneuver around. Even the violinist of Clean Bandit interacted with one of the waitress. That shows you how great the vibes were that night. A great tip is that after the show, the Fillmore will always give you a poster, so be sure to get one. Another is that they give out FREE apples as snacks. Bathrooms were a bit small, it wasn't super clean but I can't complain about it. I do recommend if you get the chance to go to the Fillmore go for it and don't pass up on it!",

There was a really grump, old security guard that constantly complained and \"critiqued\" (read: talked out of his ass about music) the entire time. He was borderline racist as well. The opener was a black rapper and the security guard was making some very politically incorrect statements about him. Additionally, one of the younger security guards was on a power trip. He was constantly yelling at people over the littlest things.   Overall, I'm completely neutral over the place. I won't see an artist solely because they are at The Fillmore but I also won't avoid seeing an artist because they're playing here either.",

    "review_text": "I hope this story illustrates the highlights of the world famous Fillmore.  I came on a recent Friday night for rave rockers Klaxons. I had an extra ticket and sold it to a hipster wearing a brown leather jacket on the street corner. Outside Fillmore there's usually a couple of wily scalpers selling tix for twice face value, but not tonight. This show didn't sell out.  After my friend and I got inside, we went straight to the bar. We both got Stellas, which are $0.75 more than Buds. We walked onto the dance floor. The crowd was a mix teeny boppers and indie rock fans in their 20's and 30's.  We nestled up to the stage. In front of us was a petite brunette. She wore a gray tunic, blue leggings, tight boots and the cutest bangs this side of Anna Friel (of Pushing Daises). As my friend and I talked about nothing in particular, Ms. Friel fished a small notebook from her bag. A pensive look crossed her face and she jotted a line down. She tucked the notebook back into her bag, only to retrieve it two minutes later and do it all over again. \"Maybe she's a reporter for the Daily Cal,\" my friend remarked.  My friend stepped away to buy another round of drinks. The brunette remained in front of me, alone. I really wanted to ask her what she was writing, and more than anything, I wanted to see her toss the bangs out of her eyes. But the more I thought about it, the more my arms and legs locked up. Bangs even took a step back--I could hear her fine writing instrument scratch the journal's acid-free paper--but I couldn't budge. As quickly as it had opened, the window of opportunity shut. She walked away to the side.  My friend came back with beers. I grabbed mine and knocked it back. \"What the hell?\" he asked. I explained how I had just dropped the ball. We looked over at her. It had been just a couple of minutes since she left, but already she was talking to someone. Her new friend wasn't just anybody, either. This guy--one tall dude, if I may say so--wore black-rimmed glasses and a brown leather jacket. It was the hipster I sold my extra ticket to. Not only did he get a tremendous deal on a concert ticket, he also got my girl. Over the next ten minutes, waiting for the show to start, I snuck a few glances at them. They talked the whole time. If there was any consolation, she kept her arms crossed, marking her personal space.  The lights dimmed and Klaxons emerged. I put in a pair of earplugs, available at coat check for a small donation. The show rocked from Minute One. The teeny boppers threw their arms into the air; the indie rockers gyrated and pulsated low to the ground. One rocker was really getting down. She cleared a 5 foot space around her and shook her body like it was going out of style. It was Bangs, sans Brown Leather Jacket. Bangs passed by me but before I could react she flitted away. I shook my head and redirected my attention to the music. Klaxons put on a damn good show.  The concert ended 70 minutes later. As my friend and I trudged along in the inevitable cowherd that ends every show, I scanned the hall for Bangs. Perhaps off to her next assignment, she was nowhere to be found. I grabbed an apple from the barrel at the top of the stairs and bit in. It was sour.  Final tip: don't bother bringing your own ganja to The Fillmore. Two words: contact high.",

We scored street parking a couple blocks away, and we got to stroll down the lovely Japantown street on the way to The Fillmore.  Hassle-free entrance, friendly employees, intimate venue, strong drink.  The only reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars:  - Venue got hotter and hotter as more bodies packed the place. Big bonus points, though, because the staff realized this and then blasted the A/C. Was so much more enjoyable after that. - I wish the drinks were a little less expensive. It was $16 for one easy mixed drink and a beer. - Also, I think they should do away with servers taking drink orders from the middle of the packed floor. They do a balancing act with the drink tray high above their heads....Unfortunately, we witnessed one of the servers drop her tray of drinks on someone's head! Fortunately, she made up for it by apologizing profusely and for returning with napkins and a bottle of water.  Otherwise, what a cool place for a show. And getting a free high-quality concert poster after was a nice touch.  You can bet we'll be back.",

The intimate room means that unless you're short, there isn't a bad place to stand on the floor, and if you're determined enough to get close by arriving early or by gradually making your way forward, you'll be very close to the stage. The sound is always expertly mixed.  There is an upstairs area where there is a bar, a small lounge/seating area, and oftentimes there will be a local guy with a guitar putting on a small little performance of his own during or between the first few bands.  Parking on the street isn't that bad, but San Francisco can be San Francisco no matter which way you spin it. At the end of the show they hand out concert posters, so those seeing their favorite band will most likely walk away with memorabilia worth framing.  As far as the venue itself goes, The Fillmore is quite simply one of the best - or THE best - in the Bay.",

There are posters from groups like, the Doors, Led Zepplin, and of course the Dead. Apparently they are all out of room for any more posters, according to a very chatty doorman. There are 3 bars in this venue as well, and you get your money's worth of liquor, which is a good thing, since mixed drinks are expensive! The show was GA, but I could see the stage just fine. The restrooms are ok, there was only a minimal line for the ladies room. Maybe it was because it was such a small show, but there was nothing wrong with the bathroom, it remained relatively clean throughout the show. I'm sorry it took us so long to see a show here, and I can't wait to come back!",

It looked beautiful and the sound was right on, with the bathrooms being a 3 on a scale of 1-5 for cleaniness. Not too shabby for a place catering to a few hundred drunk women eh? They at least had the good graces to maintain the toilet paper stock. I had a few stiff drinks, thanks to the cool bartender who liked my dress, and I made out with some randomly cute blonde girl who decided I was her new best friend and wanted me to meet her boyfriend. Awesome. My date was sorely disappointed that he missed this part of the evening..boys (note rolling of the eyes).  So if you're in the mood for some good bands/artists coming into town, and fun venue that allwos you to dance and sing along loudly if you so desire, then I say check out the Fillmore.

Being in the middle of the dance floor is all sorts of crazy because you feel the ground shaking when everyone's dancing - like it's about to fall apart at any moment. \u00a0You'll know what I mean when you're watching a concert with the right people. It's one of the best highs you can get without being on chemicals, you know? The crowd usually kicks ass anyway.  The bar is on the left side, but for you underage kids trying to get your drink on WATCH YOURSELF! They're really strict and there's a guy with long beard who keeps tabs on who's ordering and making sure they have a stamp on their left hand that 'proves' your ID was legit - he'll even go as far as following you to make sure the 21+ year old who ordered doesn't let an underage kid take a sip or you'll both be out. End of story with that.   Also, you might want to pre-drink, because the alcohol is expensive :(  Upstairs, there are two separate rooms: to the left is where you can chill and get great seats to watch from above without missing a thing. The walls are decorated with different posters of bands that have previously had sold out shows at this venue. Tons of great legends to see here! I was honestly awestruck. Very dim here btw.  To the right room is where you can grab some food. It's almost like entering a whole new place because the blaring music from downstairs almost disappears and is replaced by another. You have to make a $30 purchase to use your card so unless you're hella hungry, I don't recommend spending so much here - you have tons of other choices outside the venue.  The coolest part about The Fillmore is it's just down the street from the famous Haight shopping district AND right across from the Japanese Mall!",

I'd never been to a concert at the Fillmore before, so I thought that we were just lucky to have met such a fine individual. Not only was he a homeless-looking mega douchebag, but he was totally drunk, stoned, or both. Here's how it went...  After standing for three hours at the La Roux concert and not being able to see a thing (I'm of average height, and there were people way shorter than me who had it worse), it was finally over. Yay! Now we're waiting for the crowd to clear, but it was going verrrrrry slowwwwwly. We got out into the corridor and saw there was a major pile-up of people trying to go down the stairs. I was starting to get claustrophobic, so we moved to the side by an emergency exit. Of course, the douchebag bouncer had a problem with this. He kept mumbling under his breath about how we wouldn't leave, what was our problem, etc. He finally gave it a rest when a few more people took refuge by the emergency exit. My boyfriend alerted a staff member that didn't look drunk or high about the douchebag, but now I see that that was probably useless.  I've never been to a concert venue that had such difficulty clearing out. I can't imagine if there was ever a goddamn fire in there. Ever hear of the Station nightclub fire? Yeah. Overall, it was probably the worst concert venue I've ever been to. I don't think you could pay me to go back.  And, one last thing... no smoking? Really?! I don't think so. Everyone there was smoking a joint, including an actual little person who was busting some awful moves. I was getting baked just standing there.",

Tall boys are $10, this is the same price that I pay at professional sporting events, need I say more? That is ridiculous even for San Fran! The bar tenders are rude. I asked for a cup of water and got a bottle, then the bartender pretended not to hear me plead for a cup. There was a cooler of tap water at the other end of the bar, come to find out later with no help from them. It takes an eternity to get a drink. And lastly, the bouncers are thugs. They are definitely running a racket, and letting people bribe their way into the venue to the point where it is beyond capacity. I would not want to be there in the event of a fire. I also saw one bouncer punch someone on the sidewalk. If this occurred inside the venue I may have a different perspective, but once on the street I don't think they have the right to regulate. I overheard the cops have arrested this individual 3 times for assault (African American individual with shoulder length dreads that always sits behind the chain link gate). \u00a0They also were trying to shoo people standing on the sidewalk after the show, in front of the adjacent post office. I'm pretty sure we all own that property. \u00a0If this venue weren't so famous, it could never compete with the other venues.

Spacious venue, the line moved relatively quick once doors opened, street parking was fairly easy to find, apples, free posters, etc etc. I can't comment too much on acoustics, mostly because my boyfriend and I came here for a comedy show (Aziz Ansari) and also because I have no working concept of good/bad acoustics.   Two things, though:  1. If you happen to go here for a stand-up show and are worried if it actually is \"Standing Only\" as your tickets say, don't. It's seated. They set up plastic chairs and round tables, and ushers seat people as they come in. I imagine that this would make it difficult for larger groups who don't arrive at the same time to save seats for friends (an annoying habit, anyway).  2. If you've never been there and you're relying on GPS/Google Maps for directions, 1805 Geary STREET is not the same as 1805 Geary BLVD (the actual address). Keep that in mind or else you'll end up about a quarter-mile away wondering where the venue is.  Last night was my first time at The Fillmore, and I have no complaints. Yes, seeing a stand-up act is not the same as coming for live music, but I'll be returning again in November, so we'll see how my opinion holds up after that.",

I greatly appreciate that it's completely feasible to get drinks during the show without really missing anything since there are two bars in the main room - one being on the open upper level - that are long and not in such a tight space that it takes forever. There's also a bar in the lounge area upstairs that serves food well before and during the show. \u00a0Bars are also well stocked, including a nice variety of draft beers.  The upstairs lounge also contains an impressive display of Fillmore show posters from throughout its long and illustrious history as (IMHO) the premier live music venue in the Bay Area.

Three of us drove down from Tahoe for the moe. concert and we all had a fun time, moe. was amazing as usual, but dressed in suits which was strange for a change.  The nostalgic venue itself was cool and generally speaking the staff had a good vibe which elevates an already good experience to a great night out. The Fillmore is not too big yet not real small either, a nice size for a concert venue. It was set up for general admission so the main floor was free from seating and open for viewing, dancing &amp; mingling except for some tables and chairs along the side wall which are served by the cocktail wait staff. I liked how the band was elevated up on a stage above the main floor so everybody had a good view of the band playing.   The moe. crowd was chill too, I could roam around the sticky main floor, go right up to the front for a close up look at the band. The sound system was OK, Typical of concerts today, it was good n' loud, but not enough gut pounding bass for me, I have friends with car stereos that punch better, I wanna' feel that bass at a concert.   There's a nice lounge with tables and seating on the second floor overlooking the main floor. \u00a0It was interesting checking out all of the concert posters from past shows framed and hung everywhere, particularly upstairs on the second level. During the set break there was a performer in the upstairs lounge playing the guitar, singing and entertaining, it was a nice touch. If a performer you like is appearing at the Fillmore you should go, it's good times.",

Big enough to form a nice pit and crowd surf, small enough to get close and see the strings on Tepei's guitar. Not to mention it's legendary for hosting the greatest bands of all time. THRICE played with Circa Survive and Pelican, the sound was pretty decent, and you could hear the vocals clearly through the music. They also supplied FREE water which is helpful after jumping around for a few hours. The chandeliers above make for a cool crossing of past and present. The d\u00e9cor inside is faded and reeks of memories and good times. I'm definitely getting tickets to another concert here before the summer's out.",

Every show has been brilliant and completely different from the last. Icons have performed here for decades and it has undeniable historical charm.   The walls are covered with framed photographs and detailed posters from past events.The staff are always welcoming and the concert goers are chill and enthusiastic. The quality of the lighting varies from show to show (depending on the artist's budget) and in my experience, the sound has been consistently pretty great.   I love the orientation of the venue. Once you walk upstairs from the entrance, it's like a brand new world. A dark color palette complete with velvet curtains and chandeliers. If you're on the main floor, you can still get a good view of the stage from any spot and there is usually plenty of room to dance. The balcony is my favorite part. I love looking over the railing at the crowd going nuts.   In terms of refreshments, I appreciate never having to wait long to get a drink at any of the bars. The drink prices are standard for San Francisco and pretty strong. They have food and more memorabilia upstairs. Merchandise and coat check are on the main level. \u00a0  A few notes... Ladies, you might want to skip heels that are hard to walk in/aren't strapped to your feet if you're planning on spending a lot of time on the main floor. It's always really sticky...  Parking can be a trick. I always make sure to get there at least 30 minutes before the show to drive in circles, hoping to luck out. The upside is that there are plenty of nice places to eat beforehand. Yay Japantown!   Sorry to all you people who have grumpily resorted to posting grainy Instagram shots but I actually love that they generally don't allow personal cameras. People get flash photography happy despite being asked to refrain and it spoils the experience. I don't need a shaky, blurred video of my favorite song of the night to get my money's worth. I guess that makes one of me! Ha.   If you stay for the full show, don't forget to grab a free poster at the end of the night (while supplies last, of course)!  Last but certainly not least, the craziest thing that's happened to me here was during one of the Metallica anniversary shows...Jason Newsted came on stage to perform \"Battery\" with the rest of the band and this ecstatic 7 foot tall German guy in an orange correctional facility jumpsuit screamed in my face and then picked me up and swung me around like a sack of potatoes.

The Fillmore is such a historic venue, every bay-arean concert goer should try to cross a gig here off their list.   Security here is pretty chill. They do make sure you're not smuggling anything dangerous, but i'm also pretty sure they don't let DSLRs slide without a press pass because they were awfully hasty to question me about my polaroid. I snuck in a sandwich in my bag and even though they told me to throw it away, i was still able to smuggle it in.   Show started at 8, doors opened at 7, my friend and I arrived at 6:30, and even though there were maybe 25-30 people in front of us, we were still able to secure a barrier spot. It all depends on who's playing. As with any show, if you're short like me (5'0\" lol), either get there early to secure a barrier spot or drag along a tall friend to push people out of the way so you can see. There's an upstairs area if you don't want to fight your way through the floor.  The security guard at the barrier passed out waters if you asked, but he was really fickle on pestering people who vaguely looked like they were taking a video, so be weary if you're in the front.   Finish Ticket was amazing, but if you have sensitive ears be sure to bring earplugs because the speakers are pretty loud. The lighting was amazing, mad props to the lighting designer for having the colors complement the show.   Pro-tip: They only pass out free posters if the show sells out, but the apples are always there! :]",

Everytime I go there I see a new Dead poster about a performance at The Fillmore. Not to mention the homage to Jerry by the stairs.   An awesome perk about going to The Fillmore? The apples. They still give out apples. What better way of getting the fruit you should be eating at an awesome venues listening to some awesome band.

Also at the top of the stairs is a big barrel of apples!  As you turn the corner, the venue opens up completely to the good size stage way up in front. The venue is big enough to house fairly established bands without being a giant theater. This makes it very easy to see the band playing from anywhere in the room.   One thing that really struck me at both shows was how good the sound was. Most venues love to crank up the volume, and I always lament the times I forget ear plugs. But at the Fillmore, the volume is actually really reasonable. Sure, it's loud, but not so loud that you'll be deaf afterwards.  Looking forward to attending a show that's sold out. Everyone keeps telling me about the free show posters they give out.",

That being said, the large man with the eyeglasses at the box office was terribly rude to me. \u00a0I wanted to have a good time and I wasn't expecting to be treated with attitude. \u00a0I get it, you see a lot of people everyday, and not all of them are pleasant; but you are working, try to act cordial to your customers because you reflect the establishment you work at.  I won a pair of tickets from KZSU Stanford. \u00a0So I brought a buddy of mine to go. \u00a0When I talked to the people at the box office, they said they couldn't find my tickets. \u00a0So they told me to wait. \u00a0I thought fine, it's a minor inconvenience but I am sure they will get things straightened out. \u00a0They called me back to the window and told me they hadn't given out any free tickets...   I was upset because I was expecting a pair of tickets to the show and the dude just shrugged it off, tough luck, he couldn't find them. \u00a0He gave me one ticket and said figure it out, tickets are $22. \u00a0  I didn't know what to do at that point. \u00a0He wasn't in the mood to figure out anything. \u00a0As if I was a liar or someone trying to sneak in for free. \u00a0Now, it isn't as if I didn't have another $22. \u00a0I wasn't about to pay them more money especially after having been talked to so rudely. \u00a0I wasn't happy, my friend and I basically sat outside trying to figure out what to do. \u00a0  Finally we were called back and the dude said he'd give me another ticket. \u00a0We also had a bit more to say to each other but I'll leave it at that.  As we were about to head inside, a woman approached me and said she had been treated with the same disrespect. \u00a0She was apparently the photographer, and they wouldn't let her in either. \u00a0What she said to me at least reassured me that I wasn't wrong in my assessment of the man's rudeness.",

You gotta love those chandeliers and all the big open space. The sound here is great, however, they seem to have problems with their vocal mics on occasion. The first time I saw Jamie Cullum here about 6 years ago, it was so bad at the start of his set that he exchanged it for a new mic and started the first song over again.

    "review_text": "Don't judge this place on its food or price of cocktails. This is the Fillmore, the mighty, the legendary Fillmore. Magic happens here. At certain shows the sweaty, elbow-to-elbow crowd and the band collectively plug in to the moment, electricity courses through the room, the wooden dance floor bouncing and bowing as everyone rides the same wave-- and oneness is achieved. Such moments are my religious experiences. I've found religion at shows for TV on the Radio, Gang of Four, Hot Chip, The Prodigy, Iggy Pop, Primus, Eagles of Death Metal, Queens of the Stone Age and many many more.   At 900 capacity the Fillmore feels intimate whether you are right up front near the stage or hanging out in the back of the room for air. There are tables along one side of the ballroom and upstairs, but I like the immediacy of being on the floor. The best bands play here, and revere it. \u00a0The acoustics are excellent. Lovely cocktail waitresses somehow weave their way through the crowd, bringing alcoholic beverages or cold bottled water to parched \u00a0audience members. Bless them. The Fillmore still rewards the faithful by maintaining the tradition of commissioning concert posters for sold out shows, which they hand out one per person at the exit, but only after the encore is finished. If you leave early, no poster for you. \u00a0Depending on the artist or the band, some of these posters attain decent resale value relatively quickly.   There ware some minor negatives: the collective body heat of the crowd, the stickiness of the dance floor after 500 people have spilled their beers, the long bathroom lines if you have bad timing. Exiting requires patience and civility as everyone must use the one rickety staircase. Not every show attains that legendary Fillmore status. I've been to a few stinkers here. That stars do have to align properly--show needs to be sold out, band needs to be cooking, crowd needs to not be overly filled with a**holes. But it is worth it!   If you live in the Bay Area you owe it to yourself to attend a show here. You may be lucky enough to experience one of the legendary ones. Get there early and check out the opening band. They are usually very good. And it's an all ages venue, so bring your \u00a0kids!",

I like the feeling of the artist being intimate with the crowd so that was a big plus!   I have 1.5 complaints about the venue: the \u00a0flooring and the staff. First of all, when the crowd starts jumping, it's only obligatory that you should also. Now let me tell you, when I started jumping along, I thought there was an earthquake going on! The floor feels like it can probably only survive a few more months of hardcore jumping. It was scary but at the same time also added to the fun.   My second complaint goes to the staff. The artist we saw perform was kind enough to sign all the autographs he could \u00a0after the show. Of course everyone gathered around the stage for an autograph. The staff wanted everyone to get away from the stage so they could clean up, I understand that. Some of the staff directed us to go outside into the lobby so we could continue the autograph signing over there, so we did. After a few minutes of waiting, we were then getting kicked out of the lobby and out of the venue. Another member of the staff said it was the last chance to get autographs at the bar, which they didn't tell us was going to be there, so they let some of us in. Once we got in another staff member told us to get in line. Once we got in line, another staff member yelled at us for getting IN line. My point is, the staff needs one unified level of organization. We were cooperating with the staff yet almost got kicked out for basically following THEIR directions. Sheesh!   Anyway, that obviously wouldn't stop me from attending another event from that venue again, but that does stop me from giving it 5 stars.",

I've stood in line outside this place numerous times waiting for shows to start to ensure a good spot next to the stage, but really all views are good.   The drinks are spot on, which is always nice.  This venue blows me away every single time. The atmosphere is perfect. This place is legendary for a reason.   Also, the manager RULES.  Parking is never available, but there is a parking garage directly across the street. But who drives a car in this city?  If you want the quintessential San Franciscan music experience, go to The Fillmore, people!",

    "review_text": "Every show I have seen here @ the fillmore I have always enjoyed  Artists seen: Primus, Les Claypool, Cypress Hill, Trentmoeller and multiple others.   ++Free posters @ end of the show  + If you are a good concert go-er like me, you get used to cruisin' through the crowd and bein able to read pathways in and out.  - If your 5'4 like me, sucks to get stuck behind a pack of 6'5 ogars. But, I just groove my way to the front so never really a problem anymore.  - Kinda sucks how the bar is only on 1 side. When I go, I always make sure that I can stick close to the bar because thats a good way to enter the front of the crowd again. Depends on who is playing  - Hate how the shows always end early, but o well, there are always after parties in the city  + Vibe is awesome with other concert go-er/music lovers.   - Kinda shady area. I wouldn't walk around alone, let alone with a group of girls. That is just a screaming target, be sure that you have good transportation or a buncha dudes around ya to shield ya.  If I could, I'd probably give it 3.5 stars. But since I have seen so many awesome artists here, I rounded up.  Conclusion: Obviously in SF there are going to be some areas that are good, and some areas that are bad. This place just happens to fall on the cusp of both worlds, so be sure to play it smart and be safe. If you do drive, park on Geary, Ive always had good luck. Arrive, pre-game in the car and of course, party like a rockstar!=always a good night @ the fillmore",

Believe it or not, I do get out a lot, and I do love music, so don't completely discount me when I say: this is one of the best venues I've ever stood foot in.  -A veritable history of music in neatly arrayed, artistically devine posters -Lovely upstairs balconies and bars -Not a bad view in the house -Chandeliers! -They do outstanding, beautiful things with spotlighting -Cheerful, friendly people working here  And believe me also when I say, the sound could have been a little better - namely the balance between vocals and instrument amplification. \u00a0The bands I saw (Think About Life, Stars) seemed to get the hang of it a few songs into their sets, so no harm done.

The crowd was definitely straight west coastin, with drinks overflowing and heavy smoke in the air. There isnt a bad place to stand in this venue (unless you get stuck behind that ONE dude who is 7 feet tall like we temporarily did...).

And I'm glad to say they didn't do this Fillmore justice when they copied it because I have been to a few concerts at this Fillmore now and really enjoyed it.  The crowds don't get too crazy big, the light shows are amazingly rad, and I love that the store lets the bands decide what to charge rather than telling them. The only downer is that they are a Live Nation venue which means tickets have ridiculous fees. So, I go to fewer shows here than I would if they weren't part of Live Nation.

Another time I was having a drink with a friend at the bar and the security were telling us we couldn't stand at the bar because we needed to leave that space open for people that wanted to get drinks - the bar section was half open to begin with. Oh well, I guess some security people like to boss people around to make themselves feel important. At least the last time I went to the Fillmore it was smooth as butter. Went to see Tamar with Prince. At midnight (when the show was supposed to start) and I had to pee. So I chanced it and went to the back bathroom. As I walking to the bathroom people come out of a side door and low and behold there's Prince 10 feet away from me. I should of said something to him but what would I of said... \"hey Prince, I'm going into the bathroom. Peace\".",

With it's reputation of being a famous live house, walking into the Fillmore feels like walking into a place where you know instinctively that you're going to get a fantastic concert no matter who the artist is.   I've been here for Jason Mraz's first show as well as many Japanese artists like Puffy (otherwise known in the U.S. as Puffy Ami Yumi) and, most recently, GLAY.   The Fillmore has fantastic acoustics and no matter where you are on the main floor, you have a great view. \u00a0The bartenders like to make the drinks strong so be sure to get a your drink of choice (you need a 21+ stamp and only 1 drink at a time) and get ready to enjoy the concert.   I love the way the floor bounces when everyone's dancing and rockin' out. GLAY put on amazing show and the Fillmore was a great place to showcase their energy. The amazing guitar solos by Hisashi and Takuro and Jiro's epic bass solo thrummed throughout the entire venue and just heightened the crowd's energy.   It was their second time at the Fillmore and I hope they keep coming back. No other venue can convey simply how amazing they are other than the Fillmore.",

I live maybe 5 blocks away and I honestly have to admit that I need to go to more shows, however every show I have attended is always worth the sqeezing and groping you should expect from the audience....which in my opinion comes with the territory. Inside the venue is gorgeous. The walls are jam packed with priceless silkscreened rock posters in gaudy bronze frames from past shows. In the main auditorium large drooping crystal chandeliers hang down from above giving the place a feeling of \"properness\" as you see your band rock da house. When you are finished dancing and you manage to get out in time you might even get a free poster...yay! The only bad thing that I can say about the Fillmore is that it has an amazingly obstrusive sign that you cannot see unless you are standing across the street from the structure, but once again....inside the building has crystal chandeliers....even though it is in a sort-of dicey neighborhood across the street from Mr. Bling Bling's. :). Nontheless, the neighborhood wouldn't be the same without this place as it is a gem of San Francisco.....gleaming with awesomness.

You just don't find this caliber of accessibility at most venues. Bill Graham did a very cool thing many decades ago, and his legacy is still vibrantly alive in this hall. I do worry, though, that all that encore stomping will land everyone down in the check cashing store directly below one of these days, but The Fillmore remains as iconic as its long roster of notables who have performed there over the years.",

The crowd is almost always cool; laid back relaxed San Franciscan's who dont push and shove as Ive seen in other cities. So, I'd avoid the Warfield and of course any coliseum.   I've been going since 1994 and theres still nothing like seeing your favourite band here while having a bottle or two of Anchor Steam.  Best to take a cab or a bus here, as parking can be especially challenging, and consider beginning the evening in Japantown or a restaurant in Pac heights just to the north.",

    "review_text": "I used to think the Fillmore was the absolute best live music venue in the city, but after last night I have defiantly changed my tune. First of all, since when did it get so corporate? Even their website is now run by Live Nation? The drinks are weak and EXPENSIVE. $9 for a watered down Stoli and Red Bull. While some of the people that work there are still really nice, there were alot of employees who stood around with nasty scowls on their faces (true- it was an industrial show- so maybe they were just trying to fit in).  In my not-so-experinced opinion the handicapped accessibility is pretty sucky, maybe it's still better than other venues but I still was not pleased. Handicap accessibility is something I probably never would have noticed before but since I was there with a friend in a wheelchair I had an entirely different experience. So first off you have to call ahead to \"reserve handicapped seating\". They said only one person could accompany the wheelchair and there were three of us total- lame. Then we get up there and we have these little stickers on us so we can sit at our special reserved table. But the table is full, first there is only one person (who had the same table reserved?) then later in the night the entire table was full of random people. Do they just call it a reserved table to make us feel special but then over book it? What's the point of the table anyways- since someone in a wheelchair couldn't see at all from there. Luckily they did help my friend wheel to the front right side of the stage where he could see. But by see I mean an 1/8 of the stage, most of it was still blocked by giant speakers cause it's way off to the side. Again, maybe this is way better than other venues for wheelchair accessibility I don't but I thought it was sorta lame. On the positive note (there are still 3 stars- so obviously I still got love for the Fillmore) it really is overall a great place to see a show. One cannot forget to mention the fact that this place is a San Francisco institution with a legendary history. It's the perfect size for a venue - not too big or too small. It's got great sound. A nice high stage which makes it way easier to see. They often give you free posters after the show. They've got the apples of course ;)",

Rock and roll SF style!  The show was fantastic, but you can't credit the venue with that. However, the acoustics are fantastic, the stage is at the perfect height and angle, and the floor space is comfortably wide. I dig it. It was a bit crowded, but there was still room to move around and dance. The staff is mediocre, but I've never personally had problems with them. They did frisk me rather abruptly when I entered, which startled me, but it was no big deal. I didn't feel harassed. I didn't bother with the bar since it was already crowded when I arrived. Mostly I just hung out by the stage. The only thing I'd really change would be the seating. After a three hour show, I'd have loved to rest for a minute, but there are no chairs other than up in the balcony. And if you don't arrive super early, good luck getting any of those tables!   Complaints aside, this venue rocks. I've been to most of the major venues in SF, and this is definitely one of the best. It is a beautiful old building, very ornate inside, and the spirit of rock and roll definitely resides.",

BUT, there have been a few notable instances which add up to five stars. Upon returning from 2 weeks in Spain, I was *ahem*, a little out of wack. Ed had to remind me that we had tix to the Stephen Malkmus show, and no sorry ass excuse involving purloined Spanish goofballs was getting me out of it. This was back when he was bossy. So I dragged my ass from my office down to meet him- he had taken the day off and was camping out in order to score that table upstairs to the left of the stage. Which he did! UNTIL a lackey skulked up to us and informed us that this table was reserved- for Stephen Malkmus' father!? WTF? Bossy, I mean Eddy, tried to argue to no avail. So we go to speak to the manager (SEE? Bossy.) \u00a0The manager is working coat check and has no time for this. So we head out to the floor with the unwashed masses, and now Ed is spitting nails. Finger and otherwise. I actually didn't mind too much, because our friend Michael worked the floor there and I used to love watching him maneuver our cocktails out to the middle of the crowd- this guy is Dangerprone Daphne normally, but at work he was some sort of spillproof robot. Anyway, after a while the coat check/manager individual comes barreling out onto the main floor screaming \"ED AND DAVID!!!!! WHERE ARE ED AND DAVID!?!?!?!?\" We meekly responded, expecting I don't know what, when she graciously apologized about the table and gave us box seats. The box seats are kind of far away from the stage, but whatev. It's the thought that counts.",

Considering the bar was nearly entirely empty except for us, I can only assume a \"crowd\" at the Fillmore consists of two customers. \u00a0   We then wanted to go have a cigarette but were informed by the door staff that the only time you could smoke at the fillmore is after the opening band goes off and before the main act goes on. \u00a0Okaaaaay...Didn't make sense so we asked one of the servers why this was the case. \u00a0They informed us that they had recently had a \"mexican show\" with a lot of \"hispanic\" customers. \u00a0These \"hispanic\" patrons had been using their tickets tickets to get entry and then were reselling tickets to other people once they had left and these people used the already used tickets to get in. \u00a0After realizing how offended my girlfriend had been by what she had said, she came back to enforce us that we shouldnt be offended because she was \"100% Mexican.\" \u00a0beyond the offensiveness of what she said, her statement is just rediculous. \u00a0If they scan all tickets when we get in, then it should SHOW that the ticket had already been used for entry and was invalid. \u00a0Are they really telling me that you can just print multiple copies of the same ticket and every single on will work because this is the first venue I have ever been to where this would be the case. \u00a0Why waste everyone's time scanning every ticket and delaying entry if the scanners cant even detect whether or not a ticket has already been used? \u00a0If this is the case, I can only imagine how much money has been made by scalpers using this loophole!   After sitting through the opening act, we went to have a cigarette. \u00a0As we were attempting to reenter the venue, we were informed that we could not enter because we were \"intoxicated.\" \u00a0Ummm you have bar. \u00a0you serve alcohol. \u00a0 This is a rock concert. \u00a0We are SUPPOSED to be intoxicated. \u00a0They then had to add inslut to injury by emphasizing that we werent being kikced out we just couldnt come back in until we were \"sober\" and to come back in 10 minutes. \u00a0Ummm what? \u00a0In what world can you be too drunk to get in, but be able to sober up in 10 minutes. \u00a0It should be noted that I have gone to hundreds if not thousands of concerts in my life. \u00a0I have been to hundreds of bars,clubs, and venues in the bay area since moving here 5 years ago and have never been denied entry or removed from a bar/club/venue. \u00a0EVER!  At this point, We were so sick of the terrible service, and rude, self-aggrandizing employees that we didnt even want to wait the 10 minutes to try and get back into the venue. \u00a0We simply took a cab home, stopped at our neighborhood bar, and called it a night. \u00a0Not too surprisoingly, neither the cab driver, nor the bar felt we were \"intoxicated\" much less too \"intoxicated\" to let us in. \u00a0I will NEVER EVER go to this venue again no matter how great the billing. \u00a0In the past I had told myself it was worth dealing with their incompetence to see one of the great acts they book but after the disapointment of the last show, this will never be the case again.",

Why blame the venue? \u00a0 Bill Graham started it, and it's where the Grateful Dead, Jefferson airplane, Janis Joplin, the Doors, Pink Floyd, jimi Hendrix used to play. \u00a0Then Black Flag, Dead Kennedies. \u00a0And some other acts, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Love and rockets, Social Distortion, \u00a0Smashing Pumpkins, Tom Petty, Underworld. \u00a0Los Van Van. \u00a0The Decemberists are playing there Thanksgiving weekend, then Ozomatli, Etta James, Debby Harry. \u00a0Perhaps you've heard of some of these people. \u00a0Stanley Mouse and friends more or less invented hippie art there, the day-glo concert poster that's so famous. \u00a0And they've been bellowing \"Welcome to the Fillmore\" and giving out red delicious apples almost forty years now, as many as you want, free.  The owner, Live Nation, is a $2.8 billion a year, 18,000 employee spin-off of Clear Channel Communications. \u00a0Am I just sore over corporate big music greed?  Kind of. \u00a0Either a publicly traded corporate lawyer suit company just sold me a ticket at full price to a show that was already over, or it is so sloppy that it lets its employees do it openly right in front of the ticket office. \u00a0It's totally obvious, and flagrant. \u00a0Either way, if anyone at Live Nation had a pulse they wouldn't let their ticket office fleece the customers.  I've been had. \u00a0It just isn't right. \u00a0There are so many people in San Francisco eager to make a chump out of you. \u00a0I guess it's part of the grand tradition of pirates, pickpockets, and swindlers, that's our town as much as the hippies and the drugs. \u00a0But I feel like a sucker, and when someone makes a sucker out of me I don't return to the scene for more.",

I had been here around 10 times back in the 1980s. \u00a0The place is fixed up much nicer than I remember or what I could remember from the 80s. \u00a0But it still has the same great ambiance. \u00a0At The Fillmore, you know you are at a Rock Concert Hall and not some multipurpose arena.  Unlike other reviewers, I had no problems with the staff. \u00a0They are direct and speak loudly to you but its really because they are dealing with a ton of often loaded or stoned concert patrons. \u00a0If you are nice with them, they are nice with you. \u00a0If you want to make lots of Fillmore friends, wear SF Giants gear. \u00a0Seeking to get razed, wear Dodger blue - on 2nd thought, maybe not a good idea.  Get there early, be sure to grab an apple on the way in and make your way upstairs to look over past concert posters and to grab a drink or two. \u00a0Drinks are higher priced but it is a concert venue. \u00a0But I found prices no greater and perhaps less than at AT&amp;T or a downtown theater. \u00a0  Lot of easy parking in Japan town lots. \u00a0 Be warned however, you might catch a 2nd hand high from the exhales of numerous concert goes smoking nearby. \u00a0Every so often inside even, you catch a whiff of what B-Wizz calls '4-20 in the air'. \u00a0Not that I partake in any of that.",

Came here last night for the Blue Scholars show. \u00a0  Looking from the outside, you wouldn't be able to tell that there was a huge stage/floor on the inside. \u00a0When I was walking up the stairs after being checked by the bouncers (who seemed really friendly), I was just talking to them and told them it was my first time here. \u00a0Immediately, they directed me and demanded me (in a friendly manner, of course) to grab an apple from the bin at the top of the stairs. \u00a0The famous Fillmore apple. \u00a0Nice and cold. \u00a0Crisp and juicy. \u00a0I felt like it was my initiation into The Fillmore and can finally and officially say, \"I've been to The Fillmore..\"   After devouring the apple (I hadn't eaten dinner beforehand), I went around to take notice of the venue. \u00a0The floor was huge and you can get a great vantage point of the stage from anywhere on the floor, it seemed. \u00a0I didn't get a chance to check the posters on the walls outside because I wanted to secure my spot up front. \u00a0The bar was lined up against wall and they seemed to be getting drinks out fast to the patrons at the bar and to the servers, who, by the way, does an amazing job keeping the tray from falling while walking through waves of waving arms and bodies. \u00a0Acoustics sounded nice and resonated well throughout the place. \u00a0  I recommend catching a show at the Fillmore. \u00a0If you see that one of your favorite performers is performing there, jump on it. \u00a0You won't regret it. \u00a0It's definitely worth catching a show in a venue that's full of culture and a historic presence that's set by those who have performed there from years past.  **I should recommend, if you're catching a night show there and you're worried about parking on the streets (I've heard it can lead to broken windows and whatnot), park at the Japan Center Garage, just a block or two down on Geary. \u00a0The show was from 8pm and when I got to my car around 11:45pm-12pm, I only paid $2. \u00a0Definitely worth it.**",

I would have bought my tickets way in advance to get that precious balcony seating. I could have danced all night, but I'm starting to creak a little. So, if you're like me, order them early.   Otherwise, it's a great time. There's some service that goes into the general admission area.

The only thing I wish they had was food here, but other than that I felt comfortable here and will frequent in the future!",

I saw my very first concert here so I guess I'll always have a special place in my heart for this place. It has great acoustics and a fairly intimate venue. The Fillmore is not as big as the Warfield but frequently hosts big acts here. There's a lot of history here, as you'll read from the previous reviews, and one of the best things about seeing a show here is the free poster! I also love how the floor is extra bouncy when everyone's jumping/dancing.   When I saw Two Door Cinema Club here last year, there was an after party that was only for people with passes. I didn't have one, but after waiting awhile security or TDCC's team gave out extra passes. We got to hang out in the poster room while Kev DJ'd. Fun times!",

The Fillmore might be in the janky part of Japantown, but it's the most unsuspecting concert venue I've ever been to.  Once you get past the front door where all the scalpers are, you walk upstairs to the foyer with helllllla fotos of all the famous artists that have played the Fillmore. They even had a big-ass foto of Dave Chappelle! Hah, love it. They have several standing areas to watch the show, including a balcony.  Plus 10 points. They have a separate restaurant/lounge/bar area where they have a DJ and you can get your drink on before the main act! How sweet. I just remember the DJ playing the instrumental to Snoop's \"Signs\" and I was in a good effin mood.  Ok, one last thing: free apples? \"Really, I can take one? You go first.\" We wanted to know the truth behind the free apples so we asked the old-timer guy greeting all the people in the front. He said that the owner of the Fillmore used to give out free apples after the show because hippies were usually parched/hungry after being on drugs for the whole concert. Nice! These were seriously the juiciest apples I've ever had IN MY LIFE. (I do get worried about the potential danger of fans throwing apples at ppl on stage tho.)

Positive Experiences: 1 - Greeter was a nice touch 2 - The photos from previous performances lining the walls is very cool 3 - Our bartender was great! \u00a0Very nice and even comped us some waters at the end of the show.  Negative Experiences: 1 - Security was incompetent. \u00a0Before the show even started my girlfriend was pushed by a woman and gentleman in front of us. \u00a0I stepped in and told them to stay where they were and we would stay where we were and everything would be fine. \u00a0That wasn't good enough, the guy proceeded to bump into me and then got the security guards attention to say that I was the aggressor. \u00a0Things settled down, the show started and all of a sudden a security guard comes up to me and says I have to go with him. \u00a0I've worked security at events myself and I know the process, so I went with him with no argument. \u00a0Once out in the hall I was informed that I was taken out because it had been reported I had a knife! \u00a0What?! \u00a0All I did was defend my girlfriend from a older stuck up couple and I get accused of this? \u00a0I thought I was in a twilight zone. \u00a0The guard went on to search me and obviously found no knife. \u00a0By this time my buddy and our both of our girlfriends are freaked out by what has occurred and the guard realizes that security had been 'used' by the over zealous guy. \u00a0I asked for the guard to escort us back to where we were (up front) and he did, but he did nothing about the couple that had started the entire ordeal. \u00a0I'm a 'right and wrong' type of guy and when someone abuses the system to cause harm to others I expect it to be dealt with. \u00a0BTW, this same couple had pissed off others in the area due to their 'entitlement' attitude of at least a three feet radius around them. \u00a0The woman even went so far as to say \"I'm an ex of Billy Idols\"....LOL.  Additionally, I found out today that it is misdemeanor to falsely accuse someone of brandishing a weapon. \u00a0The Fillmore security staff obviously is not trained in this or they decided to ignore this fact. \u00a0Either way, they were incompetent in their duties last night.  2 - The \u00a0Fillmore is famous for their poster giveaway at the end of the event. \u00a0Probably not a big deal to many, but they ran out long before the crowd exited. \u00a0This was our first time there and was a semi-major disappointment.  Needless to say, I won't be returning to The Fillmore anytime soon.",

So, allow me to introduce:   ** the man in the hat greeting concertgoers as you walk up the stairs ** the bowl of apples which is available to all (a venue that cares about your health? That gets me right *here* and also *here*, keeping me regular, as they say) ** the many many concert posters, never before have I been able to appreciate some of the fine graphics poured into such receptacles, nor encountered such psychedelia in place. Dude, they have so many words written in bubble text, it will make your head spin. No wonder hippies always sat down.  ** so much pot being smoked in here. Actually, if I think about it, maybe that was what was making my head spin. Nope, nope, definitely the bubble text, but the aromas did bring back a lot of memories of back in the good old days, when I was but a lass... sigh.  I was watching the Yonder Mountain String band - who played for over 4 hours. I was not expecting that. When they walked off the stage after the first set, I was extremely confused as to why everyone was just standing. Not clapping, not moving, just standing. Were they that under-impressed? Oh no, there is a second set coming up. Wait... what?! So good and boy those boys (oh boy oh boy oh boy) can play a mighty string.  One of the downsides to the Fillmore (and I understand that every concert is overcrowded, queueing everywhere blah blah blah) but honestly, during the break, most of the venue filed outside for a quick smoke. One poor bouncer had to stamp every persons' hand in order to re-enter. A couple of musings on this:   1) I had a stamp already when I first entered. Can't we do a twoferone combo?  2) maybe the man in the hat at the top of the stairs could have doubled up or during these hard times is there only one stamp available? We can setup a fund, a half marathon or something if this makes it easier.   Also, yeah, fire? Don't really want to be there if that breaks down, unless some other exits spring forth to save the day. On the plus side, by the time I got back in, there was no queue at the womens - which in some way is a minor miracle comparable to the image of Jesus on a slice of toast.  One final note before I attack my first coffee of the morning after - I know we were in the heart of an institution with roots firmly embedded in the 60's, but the whole rainbow lighting of the band was super-awful. If that (and I assume it was) was the band's choice, then they need to go on some reality show like 'What Not to Light' to show them the way. As my friend described it, it was like My Little Pony on crack with a little Rainbow Brite and Wicked (purple and green) thrown in for good measure.   Anyway, I did have a wicked time at ye old Fillmore, and definitely added that to my 'experiences had only in San Francisco' list and if you haven't already, you should really rethink that decision.",

Yes you heard right ! The waitress came round through the many people jumping up and down and dancing to serve us beers so we didnt have to lose our place or miss the music .. now that i have not seen anywhere else.. is that common!???!!! Iwould recommend this venue - it was great for me as they are one of my favorite bands, \u00a0i dont think the Charlatans are that well known in the US and so it wasnt absolutely packed .. in the UK i would have had a hard time getting a ticket to one of their gigs.

I went to see Uh Huh Her on Tuesday night 11/11 \u00a0and.. Oh..my..gosh.. amazingg concert.. \u00a0actually, one of my friends ended up bailing on me last minute and it took me forever to find someone else to take that extra ticket... Although when I got there, I realized a homeless beggar wanted to buy a ticket off someone.. I shoulda asked him..as long as he doesn't have a knife on him..hmm.. But I ended up giving the ticket to someone totally undeserving of it.. Which was actually my clubbing friend.. and she wanted to get another ticket for her undetachable friend of hers, and ASKED ME FOR $4 to buy the fucking ticket.. so basically I paid her $4 to GIVE her MY ticket.. I bet you she won't pay me back even though she said she would.. fucking.. omg.. \u00a0 Well.. you might wonder why I make a big deal out of $4? \u00a0Well.. I just paid money for three tickets (so that's like $105) plus some extra whatevers here and there, and I'm completely broke and trying to get more money (fyi i JUST FINALLY got a job yesterday hehe..) so I gotta penny-pinch every last cent for now on... we are in a financial crisis, after all...  Well anyway, that fucking ho bag.. she didn't even know the band \u00a0but she went because *LIKE OMG! THE SINGER IS FROM THE L WORD!! OF COURSE!!!* \u00a0So basically she keep cheering and hyperventilating because of that...and she was really unappreciative and rude..  I brought another friend along with me and she kept complaining my friend was creepy and old, thinking I won't care about her opinions and what she thinks of my friends. \u00a0Well.. Maybe that's HK for you (most are judgmental about clothes, style, and looks)  Well.. besides that, about the actual concert though.. Damn.. there were a load of lesbians in there, that's for sure... it was like gay pride all over again divided by 100 million and a half...or something.. okay i can't do math, but you get my point, right???  And dammnnn, jigga.. The singers were fucking hot... both Leisha Hailey and Camila Grey were ... fucking amazing looking.. like 50x better than what you see on TV and in pictures.. \u00a0real nice bodies.. hahaha. To see them like 10 feet away was truly an amazing experience.. The lighting and everything was awesome too, the venue itself looks pretty cool. \u00a0I didn't buy any drinks there though, but I don't think I would anyway, I hear they're pretty fucking expensive.  What else.. oh, there was an opening act.. I forgot what it was called.. The Fashion? Kinda dumb.. the vocalist guy kept jumping around like he was in a pinball game or something, and one of the guitarist look like he was about to shit his pants and have an orgasm at the same time from playing the guitar.... you can imagine how that looked...

I also didn't notice any guards on the inside, which is alright, becuase they weren't needed. It was laid back and everyone enjoyed the music. I hope nothing changes.

There's just something about standing towards the front of the stage squished between sweaty fans and singing at the top of my lungs that makes me feel so alive. There are some seats available on the edge floor along the wall or upstairs in the balcony, but the balcony seats first-come-first-serve and hard to score... Not that it matters because who the hell pays to sit down and watch their favorite bands when they could stand and rock out?!  Gotta love that they give away free posters after sold out shows.

I realize things may have changed a bit, and maybe its a bit cleaner and nicer than it was in its hay day and that detracts from the character and mystique a bit, but give me a break. This is one of my favorite places to see live music in the City.   Seeing an artist at a venue this size or smaller will always trump a huge stadium or one of those silly outdoor, sit on the grass venues. ALWAYS. Parking at the movie theatre across the street is relatively painless considering that we're talking about parking in San Francisco.   The staff is always great, and its fun to look at all the framed photos and posters of people who have played the Fillmore in the past. In addition to all that stuff, playing at the Fillmore should be a huge deal for any artist i have any interest in seeing, so they usually make sure to really put on a legendary show for a legendary venue. Being able to see that happen with a fair amount of consistency is pretty sweet.  Next up for me at the Fillmore is Taj Mahal performing with a large brass band. I can't wait.

Other pros:  The venue is General Admission and if you can get through the crowd (not super hard wth 1250 total), you can be right at the stage. \u00a0  Tickets are generally $20-40. \u00a0That's not too bad considering they get some pretty good bands. \u00a0I've seen the Black Crowes here multiple times, Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, P-Funk, Buddy Guy, the Black Keys, etc.  There is food available on the second floor, although you can't watch the band from there. \u00a0For a sit down dinner, there's a great Ethiopian place right across the street called Rasselas.... and many nights they have live jazz!  Cons: As of 2006, Live Nation (a part of Clear Channel Entertainment Group) owns the Fillmore and other Bill Graham venues. \u00a0They've completely ruined the venue websites with a generic, heartless page... and the few employees I've talked to said that old management has had to fight to keep some perks available to customers (ie. no service charge at the box office).",

As much as I love the venue for its calm, San-Francisco style atmosphere, quick and efficient bartenders, and of course music, there were not any high points that made me feel a need to trek out from the Mission on a regular basis. \u00a0  Overall, if you want great live music or if you're a rock and roll fan, I recommend giving this historic venue a visit.",

You gig here, you know you're a legit musician. Sorry Justin Bieber, no matter how much you try, YOU WILL NEVER PLAY HERE.  Lovie and I came here after the mayhem that is game 7 of the NBA Finals at Gordon Biersch and Palomino to watch a jazz musician I instantly fell in love with within the past two weeks of the show: Melody Gardot. Ironicially, I stumbled upon a TV commercial for the release of her new CD. When I first heard her smooth voice, her genius piano, and hearing that she's actually partially blind and learning that she's actually my age (24), I was hooked. I had to see her.  I was nervous that we had to stand the whole time since I knew it was open floor general admission. But I was relieved to see the tables and chairs. We walked in a little late for the opener, but were able to catch the last seats in the center of the floor - perfect view. The show itself was spectacular despite running late (she came on stage at 10:30, which is pretty late for a work night). But it was well worth it. Her show is sheer genius. Crazy syncopations that rocked my brain. She straight up plucked the strings inside the piano. The saxophonist playing TWO saxes at a time. It was a show that tingled my tympanic to its core, and I loved every minute of it.  The only downfall is the bar. Cash only or $20.00 minimum charge on a debit/credit card, which is absurd. Then again, a drink is pretty much 10 bucks, so you're good with two.   Overall, a beautiful venue which should be on the bucket list of any music enthusiast. I'm scoping out upcoming artists to make sure I come back here again.",

It's definitely one of the better places to catch a show in the Bay because it's fairly intimate with pretty darn good acoustics. However, shows can sell out suuuuper fast because there aren't as many tickets available as there would be at larger venues (Death Cab sold out within, like, 20 min! Luckily, we scored tickets but it was sooo stressful with our sometimes spotty internet connection.)   There's limited balcony seating available based on a first come, first serve basis... but come on, if you're there for a good show, being down in the pit is the only way you're going to get the full experience!  BEWARE: For sold out shows, they require that your entire group is in line together as you approach the will call area or else they'll boot you to the back until everyone is accounted for, even if everyone shows up right as they're checking you. You'll get a condescending, \"Sorry, sweetie.\" Really annoying that they don't announce this when you're just getting in line.

I spent a good 15 minutes looking at all the posters wishing I had been there for half of the shows.   The architecture is great for live music, great sound, great space.

The connection with the past, the really great photographs on the wall of past concerts, the great vibe I get when I think of all the amazing talent that has passed through this venue for decades.  2. The type of venue it is: big enough for major acts, and small enough to still get up close. \u00a0I'm so glad it's not set up theatre-style like the Warfield. \u00a0I prefer standing with everybody, with the ability to move around and find a good spot. \u00a0And the balcony is cool for chillin' out, it has tables and chairs where you can order food.  3. Ok, and while I hate the ticket scalper on the corner (I SWEAR it's always the same dude), I have managed to get into sold out concerts on more than one occasion by really forwardly asking people walking up the venue if they have any extra tickets they're willing to sell to a true music fan, and not some jackass scalper who is only going to re-sell the ticket for 3 times the price. \u00a0So if you were ever that person, thank you SO MUCH for your compassion.  4. The posters! \u00a0They have some great artists pumping out some great posters for the venue. \u00a0I love the separate cafe thingy upstairs with all the really old posters in it. \u00a0It makes me wish I could have been around for the good old days.

He immediately asked if I needed help and if we needed ear plugs. \u00a0Luckily we already had some but the fact that he asked was a pleasant surprise. \u00a0  The only gripe about this place is fairly irrelevant because it's expected for almost any venue: \u00a0a)trying to find parking can be a challenge b) indoor reefer...",

They have the most strict policy of any venue I have ever visited--I can never bring my \"Professional Camera\" into the venue...even when the band tells its fans that they are allowed. Then I get to stand there and watch people with mini-digital cameras and video recorders instead.   Of all the music venues in San Francisco, this is the one I have visited the most...always enjoy the show but get a bit miffed at the way I'm treated by the staff. They seem to have this weird sense of entitlement because they work at \"The Fillmore\". \u00a0And who is that dude that stands at the top of the stairs all the time? Does he own the place? Is it Bill Graham's son/brother?  Sure...you can buy me off as I leave the venue with that FREE poster, and that is why you still get 4 stars.",

I was a bit annoyed that they were very thorough with my tiny bag which fit like tetris and not so much after they ravaged through it, I am not carrying a weapon thank you ... but other than that nothing really stood out to me to be spectacular.  Certainly nothing worthy of more than 3 stars. The acoustics were ok, the venue looked ok, the prices were average and the bouncers were mean. There was seating and tables around but we missed that for the front of the line spot. There wasn't too much moshing going on, but then again it was MGMT.  At the end of the night, we stood outside for about 1.5 hr to wait for the band to come out, and it seemed like the band was calling random folks in, but the bouncers were yelling at the waiters to form a line and get out of the way. Boo hoo. We left, no MGMT in sight, oh well.   I wouldn't not come back but it's not my favorite venue so far.",

Off we go to the liquor store, or not. \u00a0We exited the club and turned to go to the right and , really, three (3 !!) security guards started screaming at us that we could only go to the left. \u00a0I attempted to explain \u00a0the dilemma here, but all three were unbending in their enforcement of this important \u00a0rule. \u00a0  We went to the left and another guard, who was working outside said, that it was cool to go to the store. \u00a0So, we attempt to go, and as we pass the club entrance one of the \u00a0younger guards at the door took time away from his busy schedule of collecting tickets to yell at us, then come running after us, and grab us. \u00a0His forehead veins were bulging as he expressed his displeasure with having to tell us twice that we could, under no circumstances, go to the right \u00a0side of the club. \u00a0My pal told him that while they can make rules for inside the club, they can't control where their patrons go outside. \u00a0The guard was then clever enough to come up with this scathing gem... \u00a0 \"If you go to the right, you say goodnight!\" \u00a0Over my guffaws he repeated this line not once, not twice, but thrice!!! \u00a0He then told another bouncer to keep an eye on us so that we would not go to the right. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0   So we went to the left to smoke a smoke. \u00a0Apparently we were not the only ones with a deep desire to go to the right because there was a support group full of concert goers here on the left, all a bit peeved about the goofy rule. \u00a0One girl had to go to her car to get something, one had to go meet a friend that was lost, none had a solid enough reason to be allowed to go to the right. \u00a0 We were going to start a drunken rebellion and just all walk to the right at the same time, but we just couldn't get organized, and Social D started playing \"Ball and Chain\" , so we all went back in. \u00a0  I mean come on, The Great American Music Hall, The Warfield, also great venues with much more courteous staff. \u00a0The Fillmore folks can learn from them. \u00a0  ... \u00a0And Finally, the point. \u00a0Bring cash with you. \u00a0Park to the left. \u00a0Don't piss off the door people. \u00a0This is overall a great place, only marred by recent strange rules vigilantly enforced by an over zealous team of, uhh, door... guys. \u00a0And remember... if you go the the right, you say goodnight.",

Tickets are overpriced, which is why I avoid shows here sometimes if I can stand missing a band. The big plus about seeing a sold out show here is getting the poster commerating the event. Be careful though, sometimes they run out. I suggest moving to the back for the encore so you're closer to the door.

So, the sound here is pretty good. \u00a0I wish the stage were higher though, \u00a0because the tallest guy in the place always stands in front of me. \u00a0The last time I was here, however, karmic payback appeared in a slightly different manifestation: \u00a0Marina girl with giant purse. \u00a0I had to do a quick mental check with myself (I was a bit intoxicated) -- are we at Hot Chip? \u00a0Where happened to the cheerful dancing electro-kid who was just next to me?  Well, Marina incarnate decided that she had to be right in front of me during the last five songs or so (and I mean practically on top of). \u00a0I don't take kindly to people invading my personal space (especially when I'm trying to dance), so I gave her a not-very-friendly shove. \u00a0I'll give her credit, though, she actually whipped around and seemed ready to take me on. \u00a0I was buoyed by about six vodka tonics and a shot of Jameson, though.    I gave her the signature look of death that my brother and I both do very well. \u00a0I had already decided to grab her hair with my left hand and break her nose with an open handed upward motion with my right (oops, I fell into your nose!) \u00a0She looked at me, exchanged glances with her little toadie friend, and they sidled over about ten feet to the right. \u00a0She then proceeded to sway off-rhythm, half-heartedly swinging her left arm in a semi-circle. \u00a0Are you dancing or air-jerking off your semi-limp frat boy boyfriend? \u00a0Shouldn't you be at a Dave Mathews concert or something? \u00a0Bah!  Bad rhythm, an unnecessarily large purse, and a lack of self-awareness in a crowd put you in the expendable portion of the population. \u00a0Congratulations. \u00a0Here's hoping that you won't be at the next Fillmore show I attend.",

It's a really cozy place, with glittering lights, a beautiful atmosphere and such an amazing history of wonderful, wonderful artists playing there in the sixties. That's one of my favorite things about the Fillmore. And they're still booking amazing people to play at the Fillmore.   And they give out free posters at the end of each show. I love that.   My favorite shows at the Fillmore so far have been Metric and Regina Spektor. I really want to see Broken Social Scene play there but the show sells out so quick!",

The man at the top of the stairs, his name is Tim, and he's that lovely in person, too.  2. Quit whining about being searched when you come in a venue. It's for your safety as well as ours. Trust me, that one time when the off duty cop got drunkedy drunk and started waving his gun around, it wasn't pretty.  3. The staff present at the shows has absolutely nothing to do with merch prices, how many bands are playing, your drinks being too expensive or convienence fees on tickets. All those things have to do with the jerks up in corporate that get paid WAY more than most of us ever will. The people you see nightly get paid jack and we're there cause we love music. Be nice and even say thanks if you had a great time.  4. There are no ins n outs cause we're an all ages venue. Get over it. Get nice and drunk and grab something to eat before you come, if you are feeling really cheap. You can always call the venue and ask the lineup, there is almost always a real person in the office answering phones, just for you.  5. The bar is how the venue makes money, which is how we stay in business and bring you quality shows. Drink heavily, but not too heavily. We really don't want to kick you out, OK? And that bitchy bartender or coctail waitress you complained about would probably be nicer if you tipped her more than a quarter.  6. Shows have to sell out two weeks in advance for there to be a poster. It's your fault for not buying your ticket earlier.  7. Behave yourself. That guy who bit off Pat's thumb is is some serious legal trouble.  8. Have fun. You make the show. Never pretend like you're too cool to enoy the music. If all else fails, go find the Led Zepplin poster up in the poster room. Ask someone working if you need a hint.  Oh, and by the way. We don't want to be owned by Clear Channel either, but somehow, we still manage to enjoy our jobs and our shows. You should try it.",

All I can say is most of the big name or up and coming bands (especially from EU or UK) when they first tour, play here first \u00a0then move on to bigger venues and thus losing the club intimate feeling, and if you miss them the first time round, you have nobody but yourself to blame.

The only time I thought they were being harsh was when I was buying merch. I bought one of the opening bands' CD and their bass player tried to hand it to me himself, but the staff wouldn't let him touch it. I don't understand why, but I guess it's some sort of protocol.

Worst part of the whole night is trying to exit the venue after a concert. The stair cased entrance becomes a narrow funnel that the entire building is trying to exit from.

SETUP  Small small balcony, though there's a sweet upstairs room that doubles as a seated chill space, but also sometimes has a smaller band stand where another artist can play to this crowd.  But the main floor - which usually is standing room general admission permits a considerable amount of dancing, and moshing, and mingling with friends. \u00a0Kinda go in circuits around the perimeter. \u00a0Find myself getting smashed up against the stage riser, but them I'm chilling in the back talking to sound engineers.

Get there early since it's completely general admission (I got there about an hour before doors opened, and I was able to secure a spot at the railing next to the stage). \u00a0I was torn between going to the bar first or having to stand farther from the stage, but lo and behold there was a waitress walking around taking orders from the crowd before the show. \u00a0$8.75 for a paltry 8 oz or so of Red Bull vodka and a lot of ice, but the ice came in handy to sip on later.  Cameras may be listed as not being allowed, but the staff was ok with it as long as the flash stays off when the show starts.  Parking at the Japantown garage on Geary (one block away) was a cinch and reasonably priced for SF (max is $15), but beware, they accept cash only. \u00a0I think if I tried a little harder, I could've easily found parking on the street too.  I was a little disappointed that I didn't see the infamous bucket of apples or free posters after the show, but the experience was awe inspiring enough to still warrant a rare 5 star rating from me.  By the way, Jimmy Eat World was freakin sweet tonight too, but this review is about the Fillmore and is completely unbiased in reference to the band. \u00a0From now on, I would easily go back to the Fillmore to see any artist/band that I remotely like... it's that amazing.",

Visit the room where it is filled with concert posters from all time greats in every genre. At the door, take an apple (or four), which possesses a gloss that looks so unnatural, but I guarantee it'll be the juiciest, most orgasmic apple you've ever tasted in your life. I swear they must genetically modify that shit. Take a look upwards towards the ceiling and check out the beautiful chandeliers that line it. Even though this is a pretty big venue that probably holds at least a couple thousand, it feels as intimate as your grandma's living room. The acoustics are on point, and the crowd is chill. The only negative to the Fillmore is the fact that they only have 1 exit so there is a traffic jam that rivals the 805 south at 5 pm. However that is a small price to pay to check out the heavenly experience of the Fillmore.",

The line was really long the evening I visited that went around a full block and this area can get really windy so bring a warm jacket.  The venue itself is slightly older but definitely with good nice old charms.   While many were seated this evening they also allowed standing room by the bar which had the same great view and some standing areas are even closer and clearer.  The staff here was very very nice and the line did move along rather quickly so kudos to them. Definitely one of the venues in the city that I enjoy especially it's on the Fillmore.",

Other things I love about the Fillmore: free apples, fantastic posters in honour of the shows that sell out, friendly staff, great sound, and an all-ages venue that works. San Francisco is extremely lucky to be the home of the Fillmore.  EDIT: I have to mention that the staff is especially hospitable to friends and family of the performers. One of my good friends has headlined here three times now and each time has been an absolute pleasure. I've experienced my fair share of boisterous venue staff at other clubs. I realise that they're there to keep the fans safe and out of restricted areas, but some venues treat the performer's guests like they're trying to scam the staff. The Fillmore is the complete opposite. They're extremely accommodating and want to make sure that friends and family have the best time possible, and always go above and beyond to meet this goal. They also have great VIP facilities to provide guests and performers with a stellar view from the boxes above the stage.",

Willie was awesome! \u00a0He covered most of his classic tunes, and although there were less musicians than I was expecting, they were sharp and on key. \u00a0Well except for the Good Hearted woman duet. \u00a0He should stick to just playing music and not singing. \u00a0The posters that they distribute at the end are well worth the wait and will make a nice addition to my apartment.

Okay, so I was pretty upset that they didn't offer a poster for the sold out Billy Idol concert. \u00a0Can you tell? \u00a0I guess because he is a bit of a my history as a kid growing up, and I was really looking forward to that Fillmore Billy Idol poster for memories. \u00a0Not really sure why they didn't do a poster. \u00a0Someone said he may have sold out very close to the concert date - but it is Billy Idol. \u00a0C'mon, you should have had those posters pre printed months ago.  Okay, enough of that. \u00a0Great venue, great space, good acoustics, you can roam around which is great, bartenders aren't overly nice but not bitchy either and they pour good drinks. \u00a0Chandeliers inside as you are rocking out to whomever you are seeing = awesome.

I knew it was sad that I'd lived in the Bay Area for over 3 years and not been to this venue...but I had NO IDEA how sad. Little did I know how much this place would rock my world.  I'm speechless at the sheer numbers of amazing artists that have graced the stage at The Fillmore. \u00a0The history is mind blowing. The upstairs lounges/bars are so super 70's cool. \u00a0I love it. \u00a0In fact, I would be happy to spend a Friday or Saturday night, just chillin in the lounge with a glass of wine, checking out all the rad posters that adorn the walls. \u00a0  The room itself where the artists perform is equally breathtaking in all its' retro-vintage glory. \u00a0I was mesmerized by the chandeliers for half of the show . \u00a0So classic. The room is the perfect size. \u00a0Intimate, yet large enough to get a crowd going. \u00a0Not too cramped so that you're smelling the person's armpit next to you while they're jumping up &amp; down. \u00a0Plus, they blast the A/C and keep you nice and cool. \u00a0So nice of them!!  Seriously, I want to have a private party in here. \u00a0Get some old school artists to come in and rock out with me and some good friends. \u00a0I need to get the hook up.  Yes, this place is the kinda place where magical things happen and rock &amp; roll fairy-tales come true.  I'm already booking tickets for another show next month. \u00a0 I'm going to become a resident groupie at The Fillmore, just you wait!",

Do you not trust him to pick his own goddamn songs? And to the woman behind me who shouted \"Jeff Tweedy is an asshole!\" No. You're the asshole lady, in fact you're an asshat! WTF are you doing spending $40 on a ticket for somebody you know nothing about, pushing your way up to the front and ruining it for everyone else???  Five stars to the people who go to enjoy the music and treat the artists with respect. Five stars to the awesome waitresses and coat-check people. Five stars to the white-haired friendly guy at the top of the stairs who welcomes everybody in and says goodnight at the end!  I love the Fillmore. Can't stand some of the asshat fans.

I think my biggest beef with The Fillmore is the lack of control of the \"scalpers\" on the corner. Obviously there's not a whole lot that can be done about them, though I don't see an abundance of them at any of the smaller venues around the city. I guess thats the nature of \"concerts vs. shows\". I do however find them to be extremely annoying not to mention completely unethical. I have been treated very poorly by some of the staff of The Fillmore which I thought was totally unmerited, though I can certainly understand where the frustration roots from.

When lining up outside, not much direction was given to customers as to which line they were to get in, and a staff person yelled at the next customer in line to go to the window if they hesitated at all. During the concert I witnessed an employee grab a chair that a woman was trying to move from a table in the upper bar and gruffly say she couldn't move it. When the concert ended the employees were so eager to get people to leave they almost threw them out. My husband and friend were told to leave the bar area while waiting for me to use the restroom, and I heard others being told to wait for friends outside although it was only 11:30. I would not recommend a woman waiting outside by herself because of some of the people who congregated in the neighborhood. I feel that it's unfortunate that the staff didn't live up to the status of the venue.",

    "review_text": "I love, love, love the Fillmore. I have always dreamed of going here, and I finally had the opportunity the other night to see Robert Earl Keen-who, by the way, was simply awesome.  I consulted my trusty Yelp before heading over to find out about the venue (I mean, besides the legend) I wanted practical info, like how early do you have to get there, when do the doors open, where can you park?  Yelp was helpful, but here's my personal take on The Fillmore. Here's all the stuff I was wondering about before I went:  #1 What time to get there? I guess cause REK is a Texas band, sort of country rock, maybe I didn't have to worry about getting there early (maybe he's not that big in SF). The show started at 9 so I showed up at about 9:30. There was an opening act-v. funny scruffy looking guy with sort of a cool voice named Hayes Carll (with 2 \"L's,\" that's not a typo). I'd go see him again too.  #2 Where to park? Place was easy to find, no line to get in. I had a little delay because when I went to my garage, turns out my car had to be jumped so I couldn't drive (no point in driving 10 mins, then parking the car and having the battery die in the middle of a Japantown parking lot). So, I had to take a cab. I heard there was parking about 2 blocks away at Japantown Center, but b/c my car was dead, I didn't get to test that out.  #3 Can I get a cab home? I was worried maybe I wouldn't be able to get a taxi home after the show, but the band got done (way too early at about 12:30) and there were homeless guys on every corner with flashlights flagging down cabs (that were probably already coming over anyway) to pick up any wayward or inebriated REK revelers. P.S. The band's bus was parked right by the door. I was so tempted to wait for them to come out (recovered groupie).  #4 How is the staff? I was also worried about the staff (based on some of the reviews) but they couldn't have been nicer to me. I got a great spot right up front, no one stood in front of me and I had the perfect view. The guy at the top of the stairs was welcoming. (I didn't see the famous apples). The door staff was pleasant enough (they just did a cursory look into my bag). The staff looks like typical aging rock star wannabes, heavily tatooed and pierced, but everyone was very cool to me and I think they really love the music.  #5 What about smoking? I was also worried about smoking (based on some reviews). \u00a0I have long hair and am always afraid of some drunken idiot waving their cigarette around and catching my long locks on fire. I also hate the smell. A couple of knuckleheads in the middle of the crowd fired up some doobies, but it was far enough away that all it did to me was fleetingly remind me of high school.  #6 What about drinking? I was also worried about having to buy drinks/2 drink minimum because I'm not drinking at the moment and I thought I was going to have to pay, like, $10 for a cranberry juice just to hang. But, no problemo, no drinking necessary.  #7 What about the ladies room? Next on the list, I was also worrying about the ladies room, which tends to be a disaster in these situations (lines around the block, overflowing toilets, vomit, I could go on). But I went right after the band wrapped up and while the floor was kind of damp, I didn't have to wait AND there was toilet paper and a trash can so I gotta say-what more can you ask for at a legendary landmark?  The sound system was a little inconsistent-sometimes great and sometimes not, but overall, I couldn't have enjoyed this band and this experience more. I wanted the band to never stop playing. I'm almost afraid to go back I had such a good time. Next time I'm going to look at all the posters.  I'm headed to Slim's for a Reckless Kelly show in a couple of weeks and I'm curious to see how it compares.",

If you don't, it's just a small, cozy, warm place to see a concert.   I think the evening was unfairly good for a rock concert. Very civilized crowd, no pushing nor shoving, not even any b.o. or drug smell. Guess a higher class of people are into Bryan Adams. I think a venue like this is worthy of his talent. Sure wish more acts could/would play small venues, impracticality notwithstanding.   Personally, I like being able to sit at a concert, and that wasn't possible. Everyone stood for the entire time. It was worth it though.  My date paid for our concert tickets (don't be so impressed; I sprung for dinner!), so I don't know how much it cost.

    "review_text": "My latest crush took me to the They Might Be Giants show here last night. \u00a0It's a very cool venue...very steeped in tradition...very cool to see all the posters in the room upstairs...a chronology of the bands that have played here over the years. \u00a0It appears to be a strictly general admission venue, where everyone stands, except perhaps for the VIP sections upstairs. \u00a0I very much like this, as you can stand where you like and still have a great, somewhat intimate, view of the band.  All of the employees were friendly and helpful, and they seem to very much enjoy doing what they do...from will call, to security, to the bartenders, to the DJ upstairs. \u00a0It almost seemed to me that they know they are part of music history as it is happening, and behave as though they are appreciative of such an opportunity. \u00a0This, of course, is just my subjective observation, but you can get a sense of when someone is grateful and content doing what they are doing. \u00a0It really made for a very positive vibe...without any attitude whatsoever.  Lesbian ladies listen up...although nature has cursed me with a preference for men (simple but perplexing creatures) there is a very attractive female bartender on the main level that is a total hottie with a killer smile. \u00a0I didn't get her name, but she has very dark, long curly hair with very blond highlighted sections that frame her face. \u00a0She is a beauty, with a killer smile and lovely, warm eyes that will stop you in your tracks. \u00a0She oozed an effortless sensuality and genuinely friendly quality as she served us. \u00a0I can't speak for her sexual preference, but if I were a lesbian I would have definitely given her my phone number. \u00a0She was delightful!  As for me, I play for team hetero, so I spent the entire concert in the arms of my incredibly handsome and magnetic date...one of the aforementioned simple but complex creatures....and in that moment there was no where else I would have rather been. \u00a0We are both fairly tall...him over 6 feet and me 5'8 and wearing 5 inch heels....so we stayed toward the back of the venue and had no trouble seeing the band. \u00a0The benefit to standing toward the back is that you have easy access to the bar, bathroom facilities, and can exit rather quickly.  I also thought it was really sweet that when you exit the show, there is a friendly man who stands just to the left of the stairs, thanking you for coming, inviting you to return, and stating that he hoped we enjoyed the show. \u00a0Awwwwww.....does it get any sweeter than that?! \u00a0When is the last time you got THAT kind of love from a total stranger at his place of work? \u00a0  FYI...the free concert posters are only offered when the show sells out TWO WEEKS in advance...so know before you go, so you're not disappointed if they aren't distributing them.",

The first time I attended a show at The Filmore I was intrigued by the historic significance of the venue for live performances. Walking into the building is like walking into the past. The walls are adorned with posters of the performers that have played on the stage. I still haven't had an opportunity to look at all the posters.  The stage is well setup, lots of room. The sound system, from where I normally place myself is excellent from about 15 feet away from the stage. I like to call it the sweet spot.   When the band starts to plays, the floor starts to flex with the beat. The people are courteous. During the breaks you can go to the bar get a drink and get back to the same spot before the break.,unlike other venues. I won' t mention the venue.  A little tip for bands wanting to provide your fans with an experience. Book yourself at The Filmore.",

Oh - and not only me - my 12-year-old son (admittedly tired from a long day already) couldn't hack it until the end because he simply couldn't stand the whole time.

My head started spinning, and it was a very good thing I was sitting down. \u00a0So, in spite of the very cute young guy reading the Economist (no kidding) next to me trying to pick me up, I had to high-tail it out of there. \u00a0Then what? \u00a0No surprise, there are no tickets left! Craigslist, my dear yelper friends, is a veritable fucking wonder. \u00a0I love Craig now too, b/c he hooked me up with a fan named Bruce, I got the ticket at face value price. \u00a0Unbelievable. \u00a0Awesome. Okay, on to the Fillmore, this place is fantastic. \u00a0Nice seating area upstairs with a very tasty veggie burger and drinks, and then an open floor in front of the stage which felt very intimate. \u00a0Not so intimate that I'm gonna throw my bra up on stage or dangle hotel keys in front of Jarvis like some other chicks, but y'know what I mean. \u00a0 And how was Jarvis? \u00a0Everything I thought he would be. \u00a0I didn't hear any Pulp classics, but they were so unneeded. \u00a0The Jarve is an amazing songwriter, and his performance was that of an artist who really knows and accepts himself, and this was the essence of his \"cool\". \u00a0Could I have had this experience at a big stadium? \u00a0No.  Thank you Fillmore!",

This is it people, the original, one and only Fillmore - no matter what ill-conceived branding idea LiveNation comes up with, remember that THIS place is the REAL deal. Music as we know it comes from this place. The staff at the Fillmore is the best: knowledgeable, polite, helpful and funny - in a word, pros. The main room is awesome - not too big or too small, the sound is phenomenal, and the acts that come through are top notch. They have several bars so there is rarely a wait, and the food they serve upstairs in the poster room is pretty good. The posters themselves are incredible - they have them all framed and hung in order, so it's like going to a rock and roll museum where the history of the San Francisco sound is displayed in a chronological kaleidoscope. And if you happen to get hurt or become ill at a show, the Fillmore Medical staff will take the very best care of you and make sure you have a safe way to get home, instead of kicking you out into the street or calling the cops (or your parents). And best of all, after some shows the staff passes out a real Fillmore poster of that night's show to you as you leave the building. There really is no place like it anywhere! Respect!",

I was determined to meet up so I stuck around out front after the show and, yup we talked and I scored an autograph and a hug out of him. Anyhoo, back to the Fillmore. It's small enough so wherever you're standing, you get a good view of the performers. There are no seats, only the balconies on the side. Second show, I saw The Roots w/ Big Daddy Kane &amp; MC Lyte. Excellent show, great crowd, no pushing or shoving, just heads nodding, shoulders bouncing, and hips shaking. The drinks from the bar are decent. The bathrooms are nice and clean with lots of stalls, another plus.  If you're into meeting the musicians after the show, this is the best venue to do it. Since it's small, the musicians can't really run away from you. So hang out front near the bus, groupie style. Or you could be lucky enough to meet someone inside. I got to meet Tre Cool, drummer for Green Day and my sixth grade crush.

    "review_text": "Shady. Completely shady.   I used to like this venue. It's one of the better venues in the area.. but their lying, stealing staff is what earns them this 1-star review.  I took my camera into a show one time. Sure, no big deal. Apparently, cameras weren't allowed that day.. but they never advertised that online or anywhere else until people got to the venue, and they didn't advertise their camera check-in service, so I had no choice but to carry it in. Once inside, I hear a PA announcement saying that \"no FLASH photography is allowed\". Naturally, I assumed this meant that non-flash photos were okay.  As I'm taking pictures during the show, a bouncer pulls me aside and confiscates my camera. He says that he's going to delete my pictures of that night, and then I can pick up the camera at the front door after the show. Obviously, I consented.  A couple days after the show, I noticed that MY MEMORY CARD WAS MISSING. Yup, those THIEFS stole my SDHC card without my consent. Not only was it an expensive card, but it's a COMPLETE VIOLATION OF MY PRIVACY AND MY RIGHTS. Not only is the card mine, but the contents of the card are completely private and they, BY LAW, are not allowed to confiscated it without my approval.   I contacted them via their website. NO RESPONSE. I had to send an angry twitter message to get a response, to which they claimed that the BAND MANAGEMENT took the card. That's complete bullshit. They gave me a phone number to call for the Fillmore office, which had a 20+ minute recording of upcoming shows. Great.  Another angry tweet later, they finally give me a phone number where I can speak with someone. Though the lady on the other line was helpful, all she told me the same thing, and would not let me speak to the manager. They just told me to contact the band via their website. Obviously, I got no response from the band.   Needless to say, I gave up rather than to continue wasting my time. However, that doesn't mean that I'm still not completely angered by these events.  Come on guys, we all know that no band will steal a memory card. We also know that it's completely F*ed up to tell someone that you'll delete their photos, but instead, STEAL the memory card. We also know that it's a complete violation of my privacy.",

Every time I come to a show here I'm surprised to remember that it's owned and run by the heartless corporate entity of LiveNation, because everyone is so nice and seems to actually care about music. They also really care about preserving the legacy of Bill Graham's original vision for the club, so there's a lot of interesting historical tributes to geek out on as you wait around in between acts.  Of course, none of that really matters if the show is bad, but the production values here are outstanding. The sound is always perfect and the lighting guy is so good that twice now I've seen the performer call them out by name during the middle of a set for doing a great job.  Obviously a venue doesn't really need reviews - if you want to see a band, you're going to go wherever they are playing. But The Fillmore deserves some praise for the outstanding job they do year after year.",

Spacious, cool concert posters line the walls upstairs, several bar areas (they are so expensive though), upstairs seating--one seating area even has a little stage for small performances!   The lighting is generally well done, the sound system is usually perfect, bathrooms are pretty nice, and the service is very professional. They even have a tub of apples for you if you feel like eating one!   There is a coat check ($1.50 per item...so cheap!) but once you check something in you CANNOT ask for it back and put it back in. Make sure you have all the things you need before you check your stuff in or else.  Only other gripe is that it's a little hard to get to the venue! It's pretty much around Japantown area. Accessible yet time consuming by bus.  I like the Fillmore.",

    "review_text": "The Fillmore is an outstanding concert venue, and truly one of the best. This is San Francisco's finest and truly a gem. I'm so happy that the Fillmore is so close to my hood, and have had the privilege of seeing artists like (then up and coming) Ben Folds Five as well as the Fratelli Brothers. Whenever I enter the main doors, get carded (yes, I still do at this place at least), and walk up the stairs, I get chills knowing that many great artists like Santana, Grateful Dead, and Bob Dylan (to name a few) have performed here. I've had many Fillmore experiences, and my most recent one was watching Ben Harper and the Relentless 7.  My Top Two Most Memorable Fillmore experiences:  1) In 2005, I was invited to a private corporate event led by my BFF, who is also the lovely Yelper (and currently MIA until August), Jeannette Z. At the time, she was in a band (of the several performing that evening), and yours truly was front and center as she performed. For those of you who don't know, the girlie can sing her heart out, as she has been doing since she was little. (BTW, I know this since I've known her since junior high). Anywho, I'm one of her biggest fans, and as she performed on that stage, I beamed with such pride and \u00a0took pictures like I was the paparrazi. *That same night, another fellow Yelper, Michael H, and his band were also performing. MH is also a musician, and a very talented drummer. \u00a0He was captivated by JZ (who wouldn't be, right?) and sparks flew. Yes, I was there when those lovebirds met. :0  2) Black Crowes Concert - A number of years ago, my friend (a huge BC fan) invited me to their performance. At the time, Chris Robinson was still married to Kate Hudson. Before the show, Kate and son, Ryder, were hanging outside by the side entrance. Later on, I looked up to see Kate at the balcony, with a drink and a smoke in one hand, and the other hand swaying as she grooved to her man's tunes. It was awesome. This show totally rocked and wished I brought my camera to capture the moments. Duoh!   I love everything about the Fillmore, from the outside architecture to the interior (with all of the concert posters of previous performers in the hallway, hanging chandeliers in the main room, etc.,). All of the artists that I've seen here have commented on how awesome and intimate this venue is, and I really couldn't agree more. Not many places can have you so up close and personal. The acoustics are great, too. There are several full bars inside, and the wait can be long (as the servers usually have priority). You definitely get a \"high\" here, whether you bring your own or get it by secondhand. After the concert is over, the concert high continues as upon exiting, you get an official Fillmore artist poster!",

The Fillmore is great because a bunch of fun places to eat a drink are only a short walk away. \u00a0Harry's bar on Fillmore is always a good place to eat and start off the night before a show.  My favorite thing about this place is probably the fact that they never over sell a show. \u00a0Even with a sold out show, there is always room to roam around. \u00a0The bathroom situation kinda sucks, but with one bar upstairs, a bar on the side and two in the back, waiting for a drink is never a problem. \u00a0 Be sure to check out the upstairs bar and see all the pictures and classic Fillmore posters of bands who have came and gone. \u00a0It's quite an impressive line up. \u00a0This is a great intimate venue to go on a date or even just a group of friends. \u00a0  Every now and then I'll pass on seeing a favorite band I might have seen a few times already.... \u00a0Shoreline? \u00a0No way! \u00a0Great American Music Hall? \u00a0Meh! \u00a0Warfield? \u00a0....

But the fact of the matter is today this place feels more like a prison than a music venue. I don't know if it's just me, but the people that work here are just jerks(everyone except for that one guy who stands at the top of the stairs to greet you, he's nice.)

Anyway, on top of this, is the Clear Channel/Livenation connection. Now NORMALLY i could care less about corporate ownership and all that junk, it really doesn't bother me or concern me... but The Fillmore has definitely changed for the worse. If the Livenation advertisements and gigantic drop down projection TV Screen weren't annoying enough, THE PRICES TO SEE SHOWS HERE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ROOF.

Maybe this is common practice in venues like this, maybe the owner should know how their fine staff works... \u00a0 Realize that this place may often be crowded beyond official Fire Marshall capacity which has its own repercussions.

Miyavi first exploded onto the Japanese visual kei (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FVisual_kei&amp;s=d77dc514594f23059281cadf9074a2a32a881ee3a7b9068201bf172e01593b17\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi\u2026</a>) scene back in 1999 when he first joined the J-rock band Du\u00e9 le Quartz (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDu%25C3%25A9_le_Quartz&amp;s=fa6cbd77b0cc231cad546cf3546bdcdb38e7b11b234abe4fa1a484ce41499dcd\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du\u2026</a>) at the young age of 17. Miyavi, back then known as Miyabi, blew the world away with his addicting and mesmerizing guitar-playing skills. Since the break-up of that band, he joined forces with J-rock heavy-weights Gackt, Yoshiki and Sugizo to form the group S.K.I.N. back in 2007. Now, Miyavi has become a sole force to be reckoned with on the J-rock music scene, standing apart from his peers with his unique style of fusing many different genres of music to form his own brand of revolutionary rock.  The concert itself was electrifying, and did not seem to last long enough for the fans to get enough of the J-rocker. The decided lack of special effects put a strong emphasis on the musician prancing and parading around on stage, allowing the audience a first-hand demonstration of the rocker's key talent - his unbelievable ability to play a guitar like no other.  It is perhaps Miyavi's gift for the instrument that reminds me so strongly of heavy-weights Slash (Guns 'n Roses) and Lindsay Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac). \u00a0Miyavi's abilities to play his guitar without the use of a pick, and to even be able to play while holding the instrument to the back of his head while dancing around on stage, is nothing short of amazing to watch and sets him apart from many other rock guitarists that I have seen over the years. \u00a0If you have not had the chance to witness this young man's talents, I highly recommend watching the video to his hit \"Survive\" (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FcfQ-DK0TalY&amp;s=a2f0bc8c5e14b78a17e60637a7ab8670585b70b8d7cf873b7537e196a7aad69d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">youtu.be/cfQ-DK0TalY</a>) or this live version of \"Are You Ready to Rock\" (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FIsdCItNx7tg&amp;s=b9e34b45861f2bf54394384eb3c92d3d57b577ec11288740198676bff930c61b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">youtu.be/IsdCItNx7tg</a>) where he plays the entire song and all the instruments by himself:  There were several highlights to the show, to which yours truly was up front and dancing along with all the other fans in the joint. \u00a0At one point, during a lull where Miyavi was drinking water and the crowd quieted some, a fangirl screamed out \"YOU'RE SEXY!\" to the man. \u00a0The reaction was truly memorable. \u00a0After laughing at the outcry, he saunters up to the mike, pulls up his shirt, and speaks in a husky tone \"Oh really?\" \u00a0The fans went wild.  It was most refreshing to hear just how fluent the artist was speaking English, much to the delight of his North American fans. More key highlights of the two-and-a-half hour concert were his spraying the audience with his water bottle (which yours truly got smacked in the face with), after which he chucked the bottle out to some lucky fan in the crowd, and saving a poor young lady that was getting pushed harshly into the bouncer bars at the front of the stage by rabid fangirls behind her trying to get as close to the J-rocker as possible. \u00a0He loved the crowd by screaming back at them in the exact same way the fangirls were, which only incited more rabid screaming, to which he more than happily reciprocated. \u00a0The screaming match was hilarious to witness, having never seen that done from a musician before.  Miyavi also played a few songs from his upcoming album in the fall, a couple of which had the face-splitting titles of \"SuperMotherFuckingBitch\" and \"Ah-Ha!\". \u00a0(Even the bouncers were laughing and rocking out to the first one) \u00a0Look on iTunes or at your nearest J-rock friendly music store for when the album hits shelves in October. \u00a0The new album promises to be everything one can expect from the man, and much much more.  But perhaps the most mesmerizing moment of the entire night was when Miyavi shared with us his trials that took place over the past year, in which he got married and had his first child, a daughter. \u00a0The audience screaming out \"omedetto\" (Japanese for \"congratulations\") and \"Happy Father's Day\" really spoke of the joy that his fans shared with him for a couple of his greatest moments in life.  At the end of the concert, Miyavi walked all over the front of the stage waving to his devoted fans and shouting his love and appreciation for his San Francisco fanbase from where he could before finally leaving the stage. \u00a0The night was truly a work of magic, and yours truly was one of the many happily infected.

Why sit literally miles away when you can be up-close-and-personal at the Fillmore? (Probably because stadium acts are far more popular, but you never know who will roll through this place.)

I may be tipping my middle-aged hand, but standing from 8 p.m. until 1 a.m. in moderate heels does tend to wear a gal down--especially when fighting off an ensuing monster cold. I ended up adorning the recycling bins for about twenty minutes between shows. By the final finale, I again propped myself against a bottle bin in the lobby while waiting for the disgorgement of the more stalwart fans including Mr. G. I was in fine company. There were loads of young ladies in heels taking a load off on the lobby bench.   Apparently the camera policy is in constant flux based on the performers' preferences which meant Huzby had to check his Canon. They took good care of it and let me pick it up before the show was over as long as I promised not to go back inside. Fine by me.   Here's the thing: You want to be as tall as possible so you can see above the crowd, so you wear heels. But there's a trade-off. Standing for five hours in heels is a bee-yatch!

I was totally surprised because the venue is misleading. \u00a0A small entrance, large venue upstairs and expansive at that. \u00a0The staff stamping in people were extremely nice as were the bouncers checking in people. \u00a0One even apologized when they had to direct everyone to the left of the building during intermission (all the smokers congregated and I had to escape due to the impending doom to my scarred lungs..long story)   \"Sorry miss, you could stand behind me. \u00a0Or go back inside,\" he apologized.  The venue is huge, with lots of standing room as well as benches lining the walls (good luck getting those) and galleries set up along the balcony. \u00a0However, it does not help when I had two twins (they looked like the red haired tall twins from Harry Potter) stand directly in front of me and pull a Mona Lisa move on me. \u00a0Every inch/angle I moved, they followed in front of me. \u00a0  The concert was awesome. \u00a0Good acoustics and the sound effects were not overcompensating in any way. Most of the concerts I've been to have also resulted in my being smashed from all sides or my toes getting smashed. \u00a0People were mostly respectful of space, except for the occasional splashes of beer from being surrounded by happy people.  What I enjoyed, was munching on an apple from the tin bucket when I waiting between the sets. \u00a0I was encouraged by the number of men who grabbed these crunchy apples......even more so than women.  Bathroom was relatively clean and moved quickly, which is somewhat surprising for a concert hall. \u00a0In all, a positive experience and enjoyable one at that!  I'll be back!",

Now, if I could rate this place on looks alone or when it's completely empty or when only a bands devoted fans are there, I'd give it another star or two. However, we're talking a music venue here that can house more than a couple of hundred of people which seems to attract anybody who's just heard about a show from any one of the city's lame radio stations. The problem is that the crowd that goes to shows at the Fillmore sucks. I've seen bands play in various venues throughout the U.S. and Europe. So, I've seen a variety of crowds. The problem is that a fair share of the crowd at the Fillmore will talk during a show. I don't mean short blips like \"ah, they're playing my favorite song\" or any short phrases like that. I mean, people will go on and on about whatever the **** they want to talk about, even during low key songs. One person or another will find it hysterical to yell out a certain Lynyrd Skynard song title, just because. Another will OMG themselves to death because her BF just spotted another hot guy. It's beyond frustrating if you're there to actually listen to the band's performance. I'm not there to listen to the next \"great\" thing that will come out of the mouth of the person in front of me. Perhaps if the SF crowd would stop being so Self Fanatical about itself, it might forget about itself and have a good time, while letting people amongst it enjoy it, too.  Said crowd has taken some years to realize that it's okay to dance at some of these performances. Star for that!",

Even though it totally IS a musical/historical landmark--which is absolutely hard to deny for one second after you climb those stairs to get in, and see all the photos and posters that hang on those walls as memorials to concerts gone by.  Personally, I tend to think of the Fillmore from the concert-going perspective. And from that angle, it's pretty swell. For a large-ish venue, it doesn't feel huge--so you get the benefit of well-known acts in a still-kind-of-intimate setting. The sound is good (critical for concerts, of course), and the sight lines are fairly decent, even if you're fairly far back in the crowd. Compare this to the Warfield, where for some reason I always feel like someone's head is in my way, no matter where I'm at, and I seem to get a better view of backstage than the stage itself. YMMV.   So why am I never totally jazzed about the Fillmore, despite all it has going for it? Maybe it's because I'm always craving a spot to sit here, and they are fairly hard to come by. It'd be nice if they had some tables set up, but it just doesn't seem to be that kind of joint. And that's pretty normal. Just be ready.   That said, it IS really fun to get a poster on the way out, so be sure not to miss that.  Pro Tip: If you like looking at rock memorabilia, get to the venue early so you can spend time looking at the photos and posters. Then you can say \"It's NOT POSSIBLE that Beck played here in '94. That would mean Mellow Gold came out 20 years ago, and I'm still in my early 20's! I mean... right?\"  Or, perhaps that's just me.  Anyway, on a scale of Heaven (+) to Shoreline (-), the Warfield is definitely on the positive side of things. Just wear comfy shoes, and you'll be in business.",

The max capacity is 1,250 people, so it's a pretty intimate yet roomy space. The key is to get there decently early and be committed to standing if you want to be close to the performers. I think that's one of the things that makes this a great space is that you can stand 4 feet away (or even closer) from amazing artists. I liken it to a high school gym where you have a local band playing on a platform stage and you can stand so close they sweat on you.  The coolest part about seeing shows at the Fillmore is after each one they hand out free posters of the event. Take that you vendors who want to charge $15 for glossy poster prints!

There are only two things I've ever really been irritated with here: 1. \u00a0Sometimes the staff behind the bar is really slow and not very courteous, while the staff on the concert floor rocks...I never will understand how she always finds me!!  2. \u00a0Posters...LOVE THEM...please Fillmore, don't skimp on this! \u00a0I went to a concert recently that was definitely that particular artist's first show in a year...and no posters. \u00a0A friend I was with said one of the Fillmore employees had fessed up to just being lazy about it since their schedule has been so hectic this fall. \u00a0We love them - please don't disappoint us :)",

Both times it was a great show. The sound is always the most important thing, and it really doesn't get much better here. There's a reason why this place has lasted as long as it has.   The venue itself is gorgeous. The chandeliers that adorn the ceilings are such a great touch, and they create a perfect ambiance for the show. Also, do yourself a favor and get here early one day so you can talk a walk around and take in a little bit of music history. Just knowing that you're standing in the same venue that all these legends on music is enough to give me goosebumps. It could possibly double as a museum if it allowed itself too.   Always look forward to concerts here.",

I was fortunate to get to see Billy Corgan here a few summers ago (2005). I got there about an hour before the show, and my husband and I were lucky enough to get a spot right next to the stage. It must be something about San Francisco people or something in the Bay Area's water, but when we went to get drinks in the middle of the show and came back to the main room, no one seemed to care that we wanted to push forward to get our spot near the stage back. In LA, people usually want to bust your head open if you do so.  This place is fabulous....awesome bar, awesome atmosphere, awesome people. Enough said.",

It was easy for people to smoke blunts on the floor and security wasn't doing anything about it (hey that would be okay if people weren't smoking disgusting old man \u00a0weed but they were, and puffing it in other people's faces). A young white girl in front of my girlfriend and I was jumping up and down (drunk) and then just passed out like a rock on the floor. BOOM. 15 minutes later no staff, no security, but some guys around her were trying to help her up and carry her off the floor.

Their events have always been relatively organized, you wait in line in front of the post office, they call you up, feel you up (via frisking/security), stamp you up (if you're 21+), booze you up, and then you dance your face off. See? Organized.  The main dance floor is a decent size. You can rock out front row and get tossed around if you're small like me. Or you can hang towards the back and still get a great view of the stage and not risk bodily harm.  I could go either way (like a bisexual - Cleveland), both hanging on the dance floor or sitting upstairs by the balcony. I don't need to bump uglies with strangers in order to enjoy myself and dance. Their food menu is nothing special, yet satisfies you if you are unable to eat before a show.  And free posters of shows on your way out. What could be better?",

Close enough to watch the guitarist's fingers in action. (drool)    At the bar, drinks were $8 for grey goose vodka shots -I'm not complaining. A nice buzz for under $20 beats any club night! Still feel like you need a club ambiance? They have cool chandeliers all over and a clean bathroom. Can't ask for more!  Grown up, Glam'd up under cover rocker groupie shall return!",

(Note however to the balcony staff member who got irked about me taking a cell phone picture--do you really think I would have gotten anything even remotely decent for sale on a Droid phone from that distance. Chill bro!)  Unless you really can't stand crowds, stay on the floor. \u00a0If you don't have balcony seats upstairs, chances are you'll have a better view from ground zero. \u00a0   The drinks are reasonable for a music venue and there are several bars about the place, which makes getting drinks easy and fast. \u00a0The food upstairs is good though a mite expensive.  And you get a poster of the show when you leave!   My only complain is the lobby set up. \u00a0Having the store, the woman's room and the coat check right in the way of one of the exit doors of the ballroom is nuts. \u00a0Getting your coat after a show can be like swimming upstream in a flood tide and claustrophobic.",

A surly old bartender who has apparently lost his hearing due to too many rock shows got pissy with me because he completely misheard my drink order. There was feedback throughout the Gnarls Barkley show, which is inexcusable. The crowd had far too many teeny-boppers and yuppies who glared at me because I was dancing. Sometimes it seems that people in the Bay Area don't like to have fun. I liked the free poster after the show.",

On Thursday, 9/16, I came here for the Mike Posner and Far*East Movement Concert (mainly for FM). Three other groups also performed XV, Stephen Jerzak and 2 AM Club which I'm not familiar with so my friend and I came to TF at about 8 PM. There was no line, so we got in w/in minutes.   Upon entering, a metal basket filled w/ Red Delicious Apples welcomes you to a nostalgic hippyish music arena. I wasn't born until the early 80s, but the TF is a place that I can imagine my parents coming to in their bell bottoms, platforms and waving a lighter back and forth.   1st FLOOR: *Stage w/ standing area only *There's small tables and benches to the right of the stage which you can snag *Main Bar to the left upon entering the stage area *Main Restroom: 7 stalls in women's restroom which is really clean *Merchandise Window near the staircase to the left *Smoking Area is outside to the left near the USPS office  2nd FLOOR: *Caf\u00e9 and Bar: Prime Rib, Burgers, Hotdogs, Nachos, Quesadilla, Mozzarella Sticks, Chili, and Salad ($6-$13) *Balcony seating on the upper left corner w/ about 8-10 tables for 2-4 people. A major plus is you can order food and drinks at the tables so you can avoid waiting in line at the bar.  STAFF: All of the staff, ushers, bouncers, bartenders, and servers were very professional and very friendly.   BAR/DRINKS: We got Remy shots at the bar downstairs and upstairs in the balcony area. The bar was very crowded downstairs, so it took about 10 minutes to get a drink.   I honestly don't understand how some Yelpers can say drinks were expensive at TF. *scratches head* If you're comparing it to Happy Hour specials, than perhaps. All of the drinks were comparable to any local bar, restaurant and cheaper than most clubs. $20.50 for two Remy VSOP shots??? A STEAL especially when most places inflate prices for a special event.   *Beer: $6 *Wine: $6-8.50/glass *Well Cocktails: $7 *Top Shelf Liquor: $10.25-$10.75  $25 min for CC. There's an ATM located on the first level.  AMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: TF has a very 70s vibe to it; large burgundy velvet curtains, faux crystal chandeliers, and a huge collection of rock posters that lines walls of the 2nd floor.  My biggest complaint is that there is NO ventilation. I felt like I was sitting in a sauna room at the balcony level and it wasn't even packed.   PARKING: Street parking and there's a parking garage located a block and half away across from Yoshi's which is cheaper than parking at the J-town garage. It's $3 for the 1st hour and $1 for every add'l hour.   As far as the concert goes, it was just blah. We couldn't really get a good view of FM w/ drunktards and boppers jumping and waving their hands in their air. Mike Posner was a little disappointing. So much so, that we left early before he sang, \"Cooler Than Me\".   There was an FM after party at Infusion. Some of my friends who didn't attend the concert went and I'm STILL kicking myself for not going (not a fan of Infusion). They were literally inches away from FM and even got to take pics w/ them. Ugh, excuse me while I throw yet another tantrum....*POUT*",

There is some seating on the floor along a wall that is reserved for handicap, and some tables and chairs upstairs that fill up immediately upon doors opening. I think some employees had them reserved for friends, but, OK. We did find a table with no stage sight lines but figured, \"hey, we are here, let's enjoy the show\".

This was all truly enhanced by the Fillmore's perfect atmosphere, cold beer, and genius lighting designer (seriously, whoever was in charge of the lighting deserves a friggin' Nobel Price for concert ambiance). Britt Daniel ended their set last night by saying \"we won't ever forget this experience,\" and neither will I.

Also there's free apples (interesting running tradition/trait they got goin on) \u00a0 that you can grab at on the way out.  Lots of cool signed and framed posters/portraits of many artists on their walls (history has taken place at this venue!).  Sometimes free posters on the way out. Plus it's just groovy and \u00a0edgily decorated. Even in and around the bathrooms. Friendly staff too. One minus: there have been a couple times when the soundguy didnt balance all the acoustics too well, mostly with the result of the singer being the least heard. &amp; along with it difficult to understand the lyrics at times.

I didn't find the north or south side of the street any more or less creepy but people say stick to the south side. \u00a0I passed some skeevies on that side at the bus stop, so I can't rec. \u00a0  The shows end early(by 11pm) so the real nasty zombies aren't out yet. \u00a0  Be safe and enjoy the show!",

While it may be hard to separate three days of debaucherous celebration from a more objective assessment of the venue, I was sober for a few minutes here and there, so I will make a valiant attempt.  Parts of it were just what I expected: the drinks were way overpriced and watered down, the line from the ladies' room crowded the lobby, and you can get dizzy just breathing, because the atmosphere seems to maintain a ratio of 3:1 air to pot smoke. This doesn't necessarily distinguish it from any other venue. What was spectacular about the Fillmore was the layout and the dcor. The open floor area is nothing new, but the balcony allows early arrivals to secure tables that overlook the stage and crowd. The view is spectacular, and you get table service so that you don't have to miss the show standing in line at the bar. The back room on the second floor also features a small stage and tables to chill out at before or after shows. There is also an impressive array of framed concert posters from past shows that cover most of the walls.   As for sound, I was really amazed that the venue sounded as good as it did. I guess that should be expected considering all the live recordings that have transpired here, but I was still impressed by the acoustics.   The other truly amazing thing about the Fillmore: the people who worked security were so, so nice. Very helpful, very professional, and very courteous.",

Everyone stops by here at some point.   How can you not love a place that passes out free shiny red apples? Don't worry. Unless you're Snow White, feel free to accept an apple. Free red delicious apples is a tradition that's tied to the Grateful Dead. Going to guess their fans liked using them as apple bongs. Free posters for selected sold out shows is pretty awesome too.

Tim is just a regular guy who is retired and is now a greeter for the Fillmore. Cause he loves music. After the hello you come upon a bucket of apples. Why Apples?? Back in the hay-day of psychedelia when you saw a concert at the Fillmore, they always had a tub of apples that had been soaking in LSD. Take the apple, take a bite, and enjoy the ride... Bill Graham could also be seen handing out apples and posters at the end of a show too.   Now the fruit is sans drugs but it is a fantastic nod to the past. This is what I love about the Fillmore. It remembers its past while looking towards the future. i love bringing out-of-towners here and taking them upstairs and showing them the concert posters. It is honestly like a pictorial tour of rock n' roll history from the 60's to the present. I still look at them every time I'm there. To see who played when, who opened for who, etc. They sill give out concert posters but only for acts \u00a0that sell-out and you have to have to stay to the end of the show to receive it. i love getting them and have some framed posters hanging in our house now.   Many bands play here and most consider making it to the big leagues when they headline the Fillmore. That's why so many acts record their shows here and release it for sale. It is a big deal to perform here. The venue is intimate and gorgeous and this really adds to experience. it has soul. It's not all roses and sugarplums however. Unless you can make it down to the ticket window you do have to go through Ticketmaster and drinking in venue isn't cheap by any stretch of the imagination.   Interestingly enough, this was the original Fillmore West but at one point the neighborhood turned so unsafe they moved it over the Van Ness where the Elite Club is now. But after the Earthquake in 94 they moved it back to it's original location. This all happened before I moved to the Bay Area so I can't speak of the other location but for its current...It is easily my favorite place in the world to see a band play. As long as I live in SF I will always check out bands here... probably long after it is cool for someone my age to goto concerts. That's right, i will be the creepy old guy attending the concert by himself.   Fillmore, look at what you are doing to me!",

It continues, sweet melody resonating across the room.  \"a moment, a love a dream, a laugh a kiss, a cry our rights, our wrongs a moment, a love a dream, a laugh a moment, a love a dream, a laugh\"  She yells off beat again, now I want to smack her and her boyfriend in the head, for letting her yell offbeat and thinking it's adorable. You are just ruining this moment for me, and yet also making it more memorable.   This is what a concert is about, or at least any one worth attending. It's about the loud annoying child behind you. Or the group of insanely tall amazon business women who decide the smart thing to do is to link arms to get out of the joint, when really creating an obstacle harder for them to get out with as well as a giant wall for other people. Or the dozen plus folks that managed to sneak in joints and puff them nonchalantly in front of children, or better yet, ARE children.  But yeah, that's what a concert is about, I saw The Temper Trap. It was awesome and the piece de la resistance... a free poster at the end of the concert. Value win.  P.S. I've also seen Modest Mouse here live for a private company showing, also very good. Plus the upstairs room has the best collection of the posters that they give out here.",

I only write reviews after a particularly good or horrible bad experience. In the vase of the Fillmore, its the latter.  I had a photo credential for a show and approached a bouncer to ask what the photo pass meant (there was no pit, side stage was inaccessible). He was SO RUDE and rather than answer my question like a reasonable human he was physically threatening and started yelling at me. Going outside was an episode of 3 different people aggressively telling us that we would not be let in if we left, even after the understanding that we were going to the smoking area. Then, some power tripped door guy tried to make me take a 10 minute \"time-out\" before he would let me back in last night. Even with press credentials he insisted on X-ing my hand before he would (very reluctantly) let me back in.  What is up with the bad attitudes? Maybe last night was a fluke but I feel strongly that I will not be returning to this venue anytime soon. There are way better places in the Bay Area to see a show.. don't waste your money at this one.",

    "review_text": "So I've been here several times, and now I'll only go to this venue if there's no other option when seeing the band I want to see. First off, as someone who works with sound for a living, I have to say that the acoustics of the space could be a lot better. It's basically a big black rectangular box, so it's kind of boomy and you lose a lot of the tonal clarity. Secondly, all the drinks are waaaay overpriced. The mixed drinks are tiny and weak, and what you would expect to pay for a stellar Belgian ale at any other establishment will get you Heineken or Sierra Nevada. And then there's the dance floor. Sure, it's nice to be able to see the band, but dancing? That floor gets sticky fast so good luck. It's probably due to the fact that the waitresses, as part of their job, have to weave in and out of the crowd with drinks, spilling them in the process. By the end of a show the floor starts to feel really gross. Of course, if you want to take a break from dancing, good luck. There's no place to sit really. Once before a show I tried to even sit along the benches on the wall when there wasn't even anyone there, and I was asked to leave the area. Add that to seeing bouncers trying to tell people where they can or can't stand on the sidewalk (wtf?), and I've about had it with this venue. I only give one star for the apple, which I have been known to snack on sometimes (not really much of a pothead). The Fillmore might be an historic venue but it definitely misses the bar for me. I'd rather go to the Independent down the street.",

It's awesome for so many reasons, and one that I really appreciate is that they house a huge variety of artists ranging in a wide spectrum of genres. There's something for everyone, and mostly all of the time, it's really good music.  The parking isn't bad once you get off Geary. Or the easiest, most efficient way is to actually take the 38/38L which stops right in front. Though going back might be a little sketchy, but if you're with a group it should be fine. But if you're a real San Franciscan, you'll figure it out . . . and if you're a real San Franciscan, you have to at least have seen one show here at The Fillmore (and have a kick ass time)",

The Fillmore is more important than a movement because it's been host to every movement since hippies first said, \"The man is schwag!\"   It's muse. It's the canvas. It's where you grow up and then, where you're born again.   The Fillmore has been host to bands ranging from Jefferson Airplane to Nas and Atmosphere. The vast breadth of music has undoubtedly influenced many into the world of creation. I know that when I decided to go to music school, the Fillmore was one of the reasons.   The floor is where I spent most of my time because it's where the action is. But I've had some very memorable conversations during warm-up DJ's and bands up on the mezzanine level. In fact, one of my best friends went on his first date with his wife at The Fillmore. I was there to chaperon of course.   The point of The Fillmore it to give everyone a chance regardless of genre. If you walk in with a closed mind, you're not at the right place. But if you're there for the experience and your open to the new, you've arrived at the right place.",

Now here are my reasons why I hate/love The Fillmore.   1. I'm 5'2\" and this venue does not provide enough of a slant in the main floor for people my height to see over anyone taller than the average female. Most shorties have this problem and therefore they all flock to the front rows.   2. Although drinks are available to those standing around waiting through opening acts, the plastic cups are constantly being dropped by concert goers and needless to say hardwood floors + beverage= one sloppy mess. This is a constant problem. Oh, and as most venues, ventilation is mainly through oversized fans only in certain areas of the floor. Good luck to feel a breeze if you're smack in the middle of the venue for a sold out show.   3. Go for the history of the venue as you walk through the main hallway into the floor. You'll spot endless amounts of photographs from Joplin to the Dead, Hendrix, and Aretha to name a few.   4. Go for the wonderful collectible posters they hand out at the end of each show as they are one of the few places to have this and red apples to goers in a basket by the entry area.   5. For sound quality, try Great American Music Hall, Yoshis two blocks away, 365 Bimbos. For closeness factor The Fillmore, Slims and yes Bottom of the Hill - even though it is practically impossible to find cabs there in the middle of the night.

Don't make the same mistake I did: I sat on the floor in a spot that I *thought* was out of the way and nearly got trampled several times. \u00a0I don't really know why these people ended up falling on me unless they were trying to walk through the wall, but regardless, there is NO safe place to sit anywhere on the main floor! \u00a0 Last time, I got a well ventilated spot in the center towards the front, but the slippery hardwood really stifled my dancing :( The lines for the bathrooms are LONG, but your turn comes pretty quickly. Can't wait to go back!",

You have to park on the street, but honestly it wasn't too bad since we came early. The security is the same as any other place, they check your ID, pat you down, and then check your ticket. Once you're in it looks very vintage? Not sure if it's the right word, but you can tell that this place has some history with all of the groups, bands, DJ's, events that have been held here. There are tons of pictures on the walls of past performances which is cool.   The venue itself is quite small. Even though there are 2 floors with balconies, the dance floor is really not that big. The sound &amp; light production was fantastic. Everyone including myself was jumping with excitement throughout the event! The bar was very quick at refilling the water station with fresh clean cold filtered water which is why I gave them a 5/5. In other events the water they give for free is from tap or some other dirty source. Everything went smoothly and the bathrooms did not have very long lines. Overall a nice small intimate venue that I wouldn't mind going to for another event.",

(there's always seats). they give out free posters traditionally. the sound is always good....  the only problem i have is that they tax too much on merch. merch is always expensive here. even when bands actually WANT to sell thier merch for reasonable prices (grizzly bear), the venue will insist on adding five or so bucks per item.",

Show was good but I ended up having to leave early...actually I should say two thug security morons carried me out. \u00a0Apparently, I was standing in the wrong spot and was told to move by this meth - head security guy. He told me I needed to be behind some white line painted on the ground. I was by the way maybe two inches over the line. I moved about four feet down line to find a spot more clearly behind it, asked the guy if this spot was OK. \u00a0He walked by and rather than answering my question, pushed his shoulder into me. I naturally tensed up to accept his aggression. Next thing I know another security thug shows up. I tell them to take their hands off me and to get their supervisor. They pick me up and drag me down the stairs to the sidewalk out front. \u00a0Unbelievable!  For the record I am 55 years old and was with my wife who is also mid 50's and two other couples of similar age.

GOOD:* a lot of history (look at all the walls decorated with old posters);  *gorgeous interior;  *a lot of top notch bands perform here (the bigger the act, the better it is that you get your tix when they go on sale or you will be assed out in like 5 minutes); \u00a0 *big concert floor, yet still one would consider it intimate;  *if you're lucky to attend a sold out show, you can get a poster (which decorates the walls);  *many bathroom stalls; * a good place for a band to have background visuals;  * FREE APPLES (better than spending $9 for a soy burger).  BAD: *OWNED BY CLEARCHANNEL!!!!! (-2 stars just for that),  *decent sound,  *overpriced food and drinks.  Shows I've attended: Atmosphere (twice), Jurassic 5, DJ Shadow (solo, not his Product Placement tour), the Scratch tour (Ztrip, Jazzy Jay, Xecutioners), Stereolab [yes, a lot of the stuff I've seen is hip hop related, so sue me. and yes, Stereolab is hip-hop in my POV.]  Shows that I have missed: Prince, Coldplay, Dave Chappelle, plus a shitload of others that don't come to mind, but those three are the \"big\" acts that I wouldn't have mind seeing if the tix weren't so damn expensive and didn't sell out in 5 minutes.

I'm always impressed by the servers who take an order from you while you're standing in the crowded pit and somehow manage to find you again with your drink. \u00a0That takes some serious skill. \u00a0I mean.. there are times when I go to the bathroom and it takes me like 20 min to find my friends in the crowd again.  But really the fifth star is b/c the people who work here are super cool.. I brought like 20 students here on a field trip one Wednesday morning and we got to go on stage and backstage and get a very informative and fascinating history of the venue and the bands that have come through. \u00a0I think the moment that summed that whole trip up was one of my students saying, \"How can I get a job like yours?\" to Tony B.  It's always nice that if you buy your tickets from the box office on Sundays, they won't charge you a service charge. \u00a0And it's very accessible by muni. \u00a0And if you're lucky, the free posters are a pretty cool, unique souvenir :)",

Not as beautiful as the GAMC, but the history alone is enough to enjoy going there. \n  Went to see The Meters there this weekend. What a great show! It was one of 6 reunion shows they are doing. They did 2 nights in SF. \n  These guys are truly a staple having created a genre of music. Funk. They are THE original thing. The fathers of the funk. \u00a0They made something like 25 albums over a vast career. They broke up in the 70's and reunited in various permutations as \u00a0The Funky Meters.\n  No matter how old you are you have heard their music and dance to it. If you can recall even hearing about the Neville Brothers you have heard the Meters. Art Neville one of them. No other band has been sampled as much as the Meters, ask any DJ.\n  What is amazing is these guys are all approaching their 70's for the most part, and can lay down a groove better than 20 somethings anyday. The most uptight person will be shakin their ass at a Meters show.\n  Anyone who has heard of Ozomatli can thank the Meters for that.\n WIthout these guys there would be no funk.\n  But I digress....\n If you like SF history, and espeicially music history and design walk around and look at all the show posters on the walls. Classics all of them. Upstairs you can get some food (if you wanna call it that) and keep looking up. Concerty posters dating back to the opening year. They even have posters from Winterland. Winterland is now a resaurant, but it, like the Fillmore was a fabulous place to see shows waaaay back when. hahahaha\n  So get out there and go to a funk show. Remember the fathers of \u00a0the funk. And when you do, do it at the Fillmore get out on that floor and shake your backside.",

Being one of the first venues I went to for a concert and all the great shows I've seen here over the years, I almost feel obligated to give them a decent review, but then again, I'm not reviewing the performers.   That said, I love the pictures of the artists/bands from different genres/eras juxtaposed all over the walls AND the free poster they give you after each show. I hate how I have to struggle to see the stage even when I'm only a few feet away. I'm short, but I'm not THAT short. \u00a0I hope they install a slope for us short folks one day or make rules that permit only short people to stand in front. I also got kicked out of here once before the band even came on (Tragic, I know).   Hard liquor is pricey and only draft beer is available. They're a bit uptight about people drinking. They're also Nazis about no underage drinking, which I can understand, but do they really need to stalk you to make sure? Also, if you've been to smaller places like Great American Music Hall, you might start to think this place is too big for small shows. For those that don't already know, it's all general admission (no assigned seating) so show up early if you want a good spot for those big-name artists.",

The classic d\u00e9cor, mood lighting, and excellent acoustics are what really make The Fillmore outstanding. \u00a0What I love most is the intimate, standing-room-only concert space. \u00a0 Spectators in the front row are literally an arms-length away from the stage -- close enough to feel the bass reverberate through your entire body and maybe even get some beads of sweat thrown your way.  But if you're not like me and prefer to keep your distance, the floor is spacious enough for a good view from any angle. \u00a0You can also watch from the balcony upstairs, but seats up there are hard to come by, unless you show up early and eat at the restaurant before the show. \u00a0Besides, who goes to a concert to sit down? I sure don't!  There's a full bar on each floor, although the main bar is next to the stage so it's often crowded. \u00a0The drinks are not cheap, but unfortunately that's typical of most concert venues. \u00a0There are more bars in the surrounding area if you're looking to get your drink on before the show.",

Surrounded by the poster lined walls of all the live acts that have graced its stage, you are welcomed to another part of musical history.  At the main entrance, it's tradition to take a red apple from the wicker basket at the top of the stairs. Make your way over to the souvenir stand and take a peek at tonight's Fillmore poster. It's another Fillmore tradition to hand out posters to all who attended sold-out shows. Head upstairs to the Poster Room where you can kick back with a drink and food while you listen to local live acts on their second stage. Move across to the balcony bar and chill out the with friends while being surrounded by red velvet drapes, show posters and conversations of music and memories as you gaze down on the show and crowd below.  Now it's time to head down for the opening act. You never know who might be the next Led Zeppelin or White Stripes. Grab another beverage from the side bar and find your spot on the hardwood main floor. There is not a bad spot in the entire place. Look up and marvel over the beautifully lit infamous chandeliers that dangle above like angels of sound. Feel the vitality build. Listen to the keyed up voices and the see the anticipation in the eyes of Fillmore's gathering.  As the stage hands disappear into the wings and the lights go down, the entrance music of the main act stretches the venue's intensity. Not many occurrences in life can compare to those first few striking seconds when the silhouettes of your favorite musical act walk across that mystical and historic stage. Well, that is until the first sound wave pours from the speakers like volcanic electricity. And that's when it hits you. You are now a part of something larger than the music itself; you are now and forever the energy that is the Fillmore West.",

This goes out to people with disabilities, I have no clue how you can get around those stairs? \u00a0Please look into if they have a separate elevator entrance before you purchase your tickets.  Music was super loud and powerful. I could feel it in my body. \u00a0Took the option of wearing ear plugs. \u00a0Funny thing, when people were jumping in unison to the music, I could feel the floor bounce with them. \u00a0Kind of scary since we were in an older building on the second floor. \u00a0Ahhhhh!",

I love everything about this venue from the velvety looking walls adorned with some of the best posters ever, to the sound and intimate environment that the Fillmore provides. Also, appreciated the multiple levels and multiple bars.   The first show I caught on Tuesday, Wiz Khalifa \u00a0with Yelawolf, was a blazing smoky memory. Despite the fact that the show started a bit late the whole crowd was vibing to the pre-show tunes, lots of reggae. Yum.  The second show I saw on Friday was actually a comedy show, Aziz Ansari. I was surprised that there was actually seating, as the ticket said standing room only, but I was thrilled to pieces, grabbed a seat and a brew and was ready to laugh. Even his opening act Dave C. was amazing. Great show.  Perhaps one of my favorite things about catching a show here are the \"deceptively free\" posters that they hand out as you leave. Make sure to grab one on your way out...",

My complaint is regarding security. You've got to have competent security in a large space like this. There were 4 belligerant drunks leaning on me the second half of the night. When my friends realized this girl who could barely talk was a pin-ball between us, someone gave her a gentle, and I mean gentle I'm a person not a wall nudge. They responded in drunk fashion and started name calling and threatening. Someone got security and one man came. It was like herding kittens. He had no control over the situation. Meanwhile, as the security guard watched the guy throw an entire cocktail in my face. I asked if he saw that, and he said yes. And nothing. My friends had to help him herd the drunks out, and no one apologized to me. I think at the least, he should have brought another security person, and he should have apologized. If you're going to serve drunks, you need to protect the bystanders.  It's sad to me that a few drunks can ruin my experience, and everyone else's to a degree.",

I was standing towards the front middle of the dance floor and had a great experience. They had some balcony seating. It's just too bad the bar was missing one thing to make a 'surfer on acid'. I must add that they have a great air conditioning system to keep the room temp comfortable and to pump in fresh air to push out the weed smoke (not that I have something against blazing though to enhance your musical experience). BTW, I have that \"Enuff\" song stuck in my head off Shadow's latest album (at the time of this review) called \"The Outsider\" which was performed at the show.

Similar venues, such as the Great American Music Hall and the Warfield, have more upstairs seating -- much more, in the case of the Warfield. And the GAMH has significantly better acoustics.

BUT... but... yes, there is a BUT.  This place is fantastic.  I've seen... JC Chasez (yes, I did), Ryan Cabrera (yes, I did) and most recently I saw Sara Bareilles (and all of this I did with a love in my life, Mily).  The place is a fantastic testament to how music should be heard and experienced. If you are not a experienced concert goer I don't recommend the place due to the issues mentioned above, but if you can get into it and are friendly - the Fillmore can be a place for some amazing shows.  Sara Bareilles was filming her DVD this night and that was a cool thing to see itself. She is amazing, cute, totally kept referencing to the legend that was the Fillmore. The place was still cozy enough so that the intimacy was not lost.  Do not miss the free handbills they hand out after the show, those are the most fantastic souvenirs.
