He blamed it on his inability to read his own handwriting.  The jukebox was playing nothing but Tupac. Tupac Tupac Tupac and Tupac. Our Harry Potter waiter was singing along to the words, and we even simultaneously said \"this song is about his gun, not his girlfriend,\" which was pretty awesome. All the Tupac made up for the fact that I got no cheese on my cheeseburger.  When our bill came, our waiter forgot to charge us for the drinks when he printed the bill, so he just let laziness win (his words, not mine) and gave us the drinks for free. The service was pretty shitty but it was probably one of the most entertaining dining experiences I've had in a while. The Tupac helped a bit, too.",

    "review_text": "Daughter and I picked up mommy (my wife) and son at the airport. Then we came here for an early dinner. Yes, the \"Fantastic-4\" have reunited and are finally back at \"full-strength.\"   After spending most of the Summer-time in Hong Kong, wife and son doesn't want to see or eat any Chinese food for a while. So Sparky's serves your typical All-American diner food including breakfast, pizzas and Italian foods 24-hours a day. I used to come here many years ago when I used to party in the Castro and also dine here for my meal/snack when I work the graveyard shift.   Yeah, this place never closes.   I needed to work the following evening so I had half of the Famous Sparky's Cheeseburger. For $6.25, the burger has a 1/3 of a lb beef patty cooked your way, fresh condiments and choice of cheese (I got Provolone) in a fat bun. There are no combo meals and the optional sides are charged extras. And for an additional $1.50, we got the fries with our burger. The burger hasn't changed much through the years and was still good and greasy. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9d1iGjkk-4M5BpPczQ01ag?select=0tUSuK1k0XGZsm1u3UWIUQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/9d1i\u2026</a>  Wife and son split the Tuna-Melt. For $7.25, the filling had Tuna melted with Swiss-Cheese in a pair of toasted Rye Bread. And she also chose fries as her sides and there is also a charge. For a lady who spent all summer in Hong Kong, she enjoyed it and her unusual eating habit proves it. (I trained her to eat like the Tazmanian-Devil.) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9d1iGjkk-4M5BpPczQ01ag?select=glO0jsX_ujpkjUGnZmomAA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/9d1i\u2026</a>  On the plus side, Sparky's is best known for their specialty milkshakes, which is made with San Francisco's own Mitchell's Ice Cream. Besides the usual Neopolitan flavored milkshakes, there are 15 different kinds. The kids and I split a Chai Tea Milkshake. For $6.00, the milkshake has the usual milkshake ingredients and the special Chai Tea Ice Cream. The milkshake has a overpowering taste of the Indian Spice with the Chai Tea Ice Cream. A unique treat and I highly recommend. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9d1iGjkk-4M5BpPczQ01ag?select=KzPm2HwrBdxIbGQLpkbyZw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/9d1i\u2026</a>  I paid our meal in cash and my night with the rest of Fantatstic-4 was brief because of work! =(",

My friend and I were seated promptly upon entering Sparky's at 11pm and the service got worse from thereon. The young troubled waiter decides that he's going to pass us and help two other people that came in after us. So now we are stuck waiting a few more minutes to order. It wasn't until a few of my friends brought food from another restaurant that the waiter finally decides to come over and greets us with 'are you going to order food, or are you just going to bring food from other restaurants here' Are you kidding me? I'm holding a menu in front of your face, so do your job and just take my order. Being very hungry and waiting so long to order, I put that comment aside and put in my order. Also something to note, was the whole restaurant had approximately 14 people already eating, and 4 looking to order.   The food is your typical diner food, but with a good selection of pasta. The many selection of food items was the main reason why we were primarily into this place. I ordered the chicken fettuccine($12) which was sub-par and looked like they nuked it under the microwave. My friend ordered their french toast combo($9) which he said was 'good, but the eggs lacked milk to make it fluffy'  Being in an area that offers great service and a wide variety of fantastic food, Sparky's definitely does not belong in this neighborhood.   Sorry Sparky's, but you lack that spark other diners have.",

They get one star, simply for the fact that they are open late and have pretty good food, but the girl who processed our order was a complete idiot and had ZERO ability to prioritize or rectify a mistake of any kind.   We placed an online order for three burgers and three shakes. Nothing too complicated. We called to confirm that they received our order (you know...just in case), which was promptly read back to us. Cool! They got it.   Fast forward an hour later. Where is our food? Should we check on it? We called back and were told by the same girl who took our order that she'd check on it and call us back. (For some reason, she couldn't just put us on hold and do this? Like I said, NO ability to prioritize.)   15 minutes later, I get a voicemail on my cel phone that \"I mistook your order for another on your street and it will be another hour before our driver can make it to your place. I know that's really bad, but...it's what happened.\" Are you kidding me? Not even any apology! No offer to expedite our order. No offer for any kind of discount. \u00a0On top of that, my street isn't all that big. \u00a0I have a hard time believing that on a Sunday afternoon, anyone from my street placed an order to the same restaurant for delivery. \u00a0Yeah, right, Incompetent Girl. \u00a0You can't even lie well.  I called back to explain to Incompetent Girl that we needed to leave our house to go somewhere and, unless she could get our order TO OUR HOUSE in 20 minutes, we would need to cancel it. Again, she said she'd call us back and let us know.   Waited a little bit...almost two hours since placing the original order.   I called back and was told that our order had been cancelled and that our card would initially be charged, but would be refunded within a couple of days. So...she cancelled our order and didn't even bother to call. And STILL no apology.   We went to Tower Burger instead and they were super friendly and got our order to us within ten minutes.

Now, I know many of you out there think there is no such thing as the real stuff and not the stuff from a can. Well, this place cooks the can stuff without it being oily and mooshy. How many diner places can you say that can pull that off? Not many, right? I also ordered some onion rings to go because I had a craving for them. Someone else ordered a side of fries with her mac and cheese and the others had a BLAT (Bacon Lettuce Avocado Tomato) sandwich. One had curly fries and the other had seasoned steak. I think they cook the regular fries twice, once to par cook them and the second to crisp them up really good. Kinda surprised they would do that at that time of night. But the fries were really crunchy, all of them. And the onion rings were awesome! Nothing like fresh onion rings. Soo crunchy and tasty! I personally left feeling better and happier. Nice place to go to. Not sure why there are soo many bad reviews of the place. It's a freaking diner, deal with it.",

I most highly recommend dinner time if you actually want to eat a meal, because they have a special uber-awesome dinner menu then, and the place is usually nearly empty, too, so service is ideal.  I've never had bad service here. Sometimes in the wee hours, the waitstaff is really busy and you may have to get their attention if you need something, but other than that I've found everyone there to be really helpful and accommodating. Once I was there and ordered a milkshake, and it didn't show, so I reminded the waitress and she apologized, said there must have been a mix-up, and brought it. Stuff happens.  Last night the boyfriend and I had dinner there, and we got the appetizer platter. We don't like the batter they use on their onion rings, so we asked if they could give us more of everything else instead, and they did, no problem. We got a hot fudge sundae for dessert, ate all the fudge before we were halfway done...and the waitress noticed and offered to put more fudge on it. They've made custom milkshakes for us before, too.   The decor in here is awesome, even when it's packed it's not too loud, the jukebox has the best selection ever, and they have some of the best milkshakes you can find anywhere.",

    "review_text": "I'll start by saying that I'm not a fan of the food at Sparky's and left to my own devices I would almost NEVER eat there, but alas my household was ordering, I was tired and hungry so I got on board and ordered.  So here's my story: Today my household ordered 4 meals from Sparky's Diner at 11:30AM. After waiting for a ridiculous amount of time, several phone calls made by my roomies, multiple explanations of missing driver and having been told at least twice that our order was \"on it's way\" and many hours later at 3PM (yes 3pm) we STILL had not received our meals. Wow!!   My roommates were laid back, understanding and patient with the situation. I called Sparky's to talk with them myself, because I still had no idea what was happening, weather our food would ever come at all and why in the hell they weren't jumping to remedy the situation.   Keep in mind, I could make this low quality food at home...I'm playing them to make it so I don't have to, right?  To my utter disbelief the girl on the phone was exceptionally unhelpful and ineffective. She was more interested in explaining what happened, how it had happened, why we'd been told several times that our food was on it's way (which was obviously not true), in interrupting/talking over me and denying my request that she call her manager to get our food comped/delivered immediately than in problem solving a situation they had clearly F-d up COMPLETELY.   If it were my business and I had screwed the situation this hard, I'd be kissing my customers ass, getting their food delivered immediately, and for FREE. But, I understand that the customers opinion and experience of my business can and will make a difference. (If it were my business the food would also be decent and reasonably priced though.) Sparky's passed an opportunity to do right, and impress me, but chose instead to completely blow my mind and piss me off.  I called once more, again I got another explanation and I asked the useless unhelpful girl on the phone to please call her manager and get our food delivered pronto, for free. She called me back and said they could cancel our order or send it for 50% off. Wow! End of Story. She can blow me.  Wish I could give ZERO stars.",

We called and ordered and they never asked for our address which we didn't catch, but was strange at an after thought. Apparently they just assumed they were going to the same address that was previously linked to that number. We waited for an hour and a half and when they finally called they were at the wrong address. sigh.  My third encounter (my second encounter was pretty anticlimactic, although the waitress was a better-than-you vegan punk hipster type who never made eye contact with us or smiled) was super late at night. My friend and I were going to make our way to Orphan Andy's (WHICH IS WONDERFUL) when we opted to stop here since it was closer. We ordered ice cream and fries. Our ice cream was served first and ten minutes apart from our fries. Now you may be concerned that our ice cream would have melted by the time we got our fries...Well you're wrong. It was melted before it even reached the table. \"SWAN\" another bored hipster served us the ice cream by sliding it across the table without ever turning her body towards us in a sort of jaded tone.  And my last encounter was two nights ago. I asked to sit at a booth because I wanted to read and the lighting is pretty awful at the counter. They wouldn't let me because the guy working the tables was busy...Sparky's has a weird idea of what is busy btw. \u00a0Regardless why couldn't the woman behind the counter help instead? She wasn't busy at all. I ordered a chicken sandwich and curly fries. I waited a long time as usual and was served a chicken sandwich. She forgot my fries which was super disappointing. I know this review speaks for myself, but sitting next me at the counter were two tourists. I don't know what went on in their service, but I did here him tell the waitress that something \"wasn't acceptable\" and he didn't tip her. True that's hearsay... but judging by some of the other reviews I would trust it.",

I ordered Sparky's for delivery on a Saturday afternoon. I was catching up on work all weekend and wanted to make my day a bit easier by having some food delivered instead of having to spend time to go grab it or make it. And so it began...  I placed my order around 12:30pm and was told it would be about an hour for my delivery. This was already disappointing considering my order was garlic fries and chicken strips (unhealthy, I know! stop judging me). So 1:30pm rolls around and no food arrives. I wait until about 1:50 before I call to find out where my food is. I was assured that it has been out for delivery for quite a while and should be there \"any minute\". At this point I'm hungry and grumpy. At 2:15 my food still has not arrived so I call again. Of course the man on the phone has no clue where the hell my food actually is and I get brief apology and a promise that it will be there soon.  My food arrived slightly after 3pm, at this point I've already decided that Sparky's is the worst food establishment on the planet, but I'm so hungry that all I care about is finally eating what I've been waiting for hours to eat. I open the box and find a generous mound of soggy, cold fries - the kind that are as disgusting to look at as they are to eat. In the next box are my \"chicken tenders\" presented upon a bed of lettuce that is so brown and wilted, it looked on the verge of rotting (these were also cold).  I threw the food in the trash where it belonged and walked to a sandwich place a few blocks away like I should have at 12:30pm.  In summary: -delivery nearly 2 hours late -food is horrible",

My impression is that it went downhill in the late 90s/early 00s, but the food is actually back up to snuff now. The prices have crept up, but so has quality, and it ain't cheap running a restaurant in SF nowadays.  I usually get the turkey burger and fries. Mmmmm.",

    "review_text": "I must begin this review with a huge sigh, rubbing temples that throb (mainly from the ten phone calls I have exchanged with the manager who refuses to refund my card for food that was never delivered to me!), and trying to figure out a new way to say what my fellow yelpers have already made painstakingly clear...Sparky's does not even deserve one star. If there was a negative rating system, that would be more efficient for such a joint. Usually, I create a list of positives and negatives, often unbiased, for my readers, but I can honestly and wholeheartedly not come up with one single positive thing to say.   To be blunt: Sparky's, I did not feel sparks. How do you steal almost $40 from a customer? How do you agree to a refund, then refuse, then ignore and avoid calls, then agree again to a refund...I'm still waiting.  Let me make a list of other restaurants that I would recommend for late night eats (it's worth the walk/ride/drive because Sparky's delivery is far from the convenience you might have had in mind):  1. Orphan Andy's (This is my first choice for late night eats, after dancing and drinking, a long sex session, or getting all beach dirty at a bonfire. Their food is amazing! AND, the service is always super cute gay boys, with much love! Castro locale, 6 a.m.- 6 p.m.) 2. Ryoko's Japanese Restaurant &amp; Bar (Civic Center, 6 p.m.- 2 a.m.) 3. Osha Thai (multiple locations, open til 3 a.m.) 4. NOPA (western addition, open til 1 a.m.) 5. Vietnam Restaurant (North Beach, open til 4 a.m. on Fri/Sat) 6. Grubstake (Burgers! on Pine St., open til 4 a.m.) 7. El Farolito (Delicious burritos-check. Quick and good service-check. Open til 3:30 a.m.-check. My intense appreciation for The Mission-check.) 8. Its Tops Coffee Shop (Greasy &amp; yummy noms! A little pricey but, hey, it's worth it. Duboce Triangle locale, open til 3 a.m., Wed-Sat.) 9. Zeitgeist (Another of my faves, but mostly because I can get a top-notch, snotty but amazing beer in a divey bar, outdoor patio setting with a grilled cheese that always melts perfection down to my tum. Open til 2 a.m.) 10. I'm just going to finish with the obvious...almost any pizza place in your neighborhood is open until 2 or 3 a.m. I happen to enjoy Arinell's on Valencia, but have been known to grab a funky-topped slice in SOMA.   In case I haven't made my point, eat anywhere else but Sparky's. I understand the convenience of delivery, but you'd be better off putting the delivery fee towards a cab ride to any of the above places. I may even be down to split the ride with you!   As always, enjoy--this is, after all, a city where one can almost always eat happy. I know I do, as long as I remember that Sparky's is never an option.",

The first time I went I shared a works burger and some onion rings with my friend, and I have to say those onion rings were so good. They're beer battered, which I think makes them even better. I went back here yesterday and I had myself some steak and eggs, which was pretty filling. The hash browns were really good, even though I was iffy about it when I saw some carrots in it (good choice, good choice). Their chocolate shake: to die for. Better than Mel's, which is something I didn't think I would ever say. The chocolate shake at Sparky's is no joke. Believe that.   And of course, I had myself some onion rings.

The server Illeana was busy because the place was packed yet she was very friendly and very attentive to my table. She deserves 5 stars!  The burger hit the spot and soaked up all of the cocktails that I had been drinking throughout the night. It was very good. They also have a full breakfast menu 24hrs a day.  The diner is set like a 50's style diner yet they were playing some awesome mash-ups for the patrons to listen to.   Sparky's is open 24hrs and has all American cuisine.   I have been here quite a few times over the years and I have always had a good experience. From the burgers and shakes to the onion rings and fresh brewed iced tea, it's all good.

Of all the collective systems that take money for a service or product, this place is horrible. Worse than BART even.  There have been many great experiences had for me here from 1997 to 2007, but after that it all went downhill. Either the business changed hands, or a new captain came to the helm and ran this business into a berg.  From poorly made food, to slow service on busy nights, this place should be given a half a star. Nothing is made or packaged consistently. The staff(of whom I have had many friends work here) has an over accomplished sense of power &amp; entitlement. Its a 24 hour diner ladies, not the stage you work on weekends. Give the ego a break &amp; serve. That is the role you play on Sparky's stage. Service starts with being interested in helping people, not being pissed off that you have to be there. Where do you think that negative energy goes? Into that bad coffee your pouring? It goes into every person who sees how you represent this business, your employer. Not everyone likes whom they work for. Less than half a percent actually love their employer. If you're unhappy, do something about it other than insisting that you are right &amp; the only one whom can be. That attitude will trickle into other areas of your life, and that truly could be sad.  Most people say the first impression is the most important, but I say its the last one that is longer lasting. Until they change Sparky's into an stylish gay pool hall, biker bar or another Peet's Coffee, its unlikely that I will return to this business.",

Not sure why we went to Sparky's tonight except that it was late...we didn't feel like cooking...nothing else was open (Oh yeah, that's the scenario.) I ordered the chili cheeseburger, imagining a nice burger, a couple of slices of cheese, all drowning in chili. What I got was an over-cooked piece of meat, on a dried bun, and about three tablespoons of chili. When the server brought it to the table, I almost sent it back because I didn't see the chili. I literally had to lift up the bun and look for the chili--really??? I ordered curly fries and got regular fries...no biggie...except they were not at all crispy...sort of soggy and cold. Best think about my meal--the Diet Coke and Ranch Dressing (I love it on my fries...damn the fries were terrible.)  Okay...so this is a 24-hour diner and the staff is pretty much all twenty-something hipster types. I probably shouldn't expect a whole lot.

Eggs: Eggs over easy should not have any overcooked yolk. And no crispy or browned edges. Fail. Pancakes: Good basic pancake, fluffy and perfectly cooked. No butter? Are you kidding me? \u00a0Syrup isn't pure maple (not unexpected) but not very mapley either. I get that maple syrup is expensive but the table syrup you're using kinda ruins the pancake. Half a fail. Bacon: More fat than meat but nice and smoky. No real personality, like store bought bacon. Please drain the excess fat ok?   It wasn't just my food that was disappointing.  Biscuits and gravy with poached eggs and sausage: The poached eggs came in a little bowl, swimming in water with broken overcooked yolks (yuk) and the order was SAUSAGE, you came back with bacon.  The burger with gorgonzola &amp; basil was inspired, but when it's ordered medium rare and it arrives well done with an insipid bun that collapses the minute you pick it up, it's a failure.

Even if you spill out of a downtown theater at 1 AM, resist the gravitational field around Mel's Diner and come here instead. Oh stop complaining, it's only an extra 15 blocks toward the Castro.   There is an generous spread of healthy menu items at this American diner, and if you want something healthy, don't even look at the menu and just order \"My Body is a Temple\" with orange juice and a side salad or something. Though it's not particularly tasty, you'll feel twice as good by the end of the meal. The menu also offers plenty international fusion with notable influence from Mediterranean dishes, for some unknown reason.  If your cholesterol is in top shape, be a little more daring and try the omelettes and DEFINITELY a side order of the hash browns. Their hash browns include delicious slivered carrots and green onions tossed into the shredded potatoes. Yum. \u00a0If you're really young and don't care about your body a damn bit, then hell, order a milk shake while you're at it!   Why not try out this establishment once or twice. Management has created a late night oasis that is good any hour of the night at a moderate price, so take advantage of it.",

The food is not bad, but everything takes forever... to get menus, to have your order taken, for the food to arrive, for the check to come. Everything is a wait much longer than it needs to be. After the other two waiting tables received their food we were the only ones still waiting and it still took another 10 minutes for our food to arrive. It should not take 15 - 20 minutes for 2 orders of scrambled eggs to come out.   I'm writing this in the hopes that the manager will read some of these reviews and realize they're losing business and that this all seems easy to solve. But I think it will fall on deaf ears. The sign on the door says \"Sparky's Diner - Breakfast\" but I think their heart may be in the late night crowd and not the breakfast crowd. When we first moved to the hood and started trying it, there was a couple times when they staff just looked like they had been up all night too and were blasting heavy metal to try and stay awake. My recommendation is to go to Chow or Crepevine. Even if it Chow is packed, it will probably still be faster than the sparkless \"Sparky's\".",

But Sparky's isn't REALLY a diner, it merely tries to be one by creating an atmosphere that's diner like. It ends up being diner-LITE. The service is not nearly as friendly, the food as unhealthy, or the food quite greasy enough. And they are all too accommodating with delivery to be a real hole-in-the-wall.  Real diner or not, it's nice to know there's a place in the city where I can buy burgers, fries, and the kitchen sink at all hours of the day and night. Thank god a place exists where I can decide it's a great idea to break a semblance of a healthy diet at 3am.",

It's more like the fault of the establishment for not ensuring the right amount of people are working during PRIDE weekend! How can a restaurant right next to the area of PRIDE celebration only have ONE SERVER?! HEELLLOOO... Too much pressure on one worker and patrons eager stomachs!  After 30 minutes of food arriving, only 1/4 of us enjoyed our food.  Side salad with fries - salad had no dressing in it. Since there was only one server, my friend did not want to add to the already-pressured waitress. So she just ate the salad without dressing. Fries were fries... nothing special. 2 of us ordered Chicken Pesto - I don't mind dry chicken breast so I actually was the 1/4 who actually enjoyed my food. My other friend did not enjoy hers at all.  Eggs benedict with hashbrowns - When did eggs benedict become eggs boiled?? My partner literally took the two eggs by the fork and dropped it on the plate and it made a big PLOP like a dense brick. Luckily, the waitress apologized and did not have us pay for that meal since she didn't really eat it.  Customer service (one waitress) was great and awesome! She did her best and worked harder than she should have on PRIDE weekend. I hope she got paid triple time for this.",

My order comes and the potatoes are no where to be found. The only reason that I get breakfast, pretty much ever, is so I can order hash browns. There is nothing better to me for breakfast - not bacon, not sausage, HASH BROWNS.  I called because I figured that it was just a mix up, since I didn't write their menu on Grub Hub and I'm pretty sure it's not my bad I didn't get those heavenly potatoes. But to no avail. Somehow I supposedly read the site wrong, and now I get to go potato-less.  Also, no syrup for pancakes? Seriously?! Who does that?  And they charge extra for tabasco, not that it matters since they didn't give me my potatoes anyway.",

    "review_text": "We came into Sparky's on a Saturday night around 9 pm because the menu was extensive, but halfway through our visit to this establishment the boy and I both went \"we could have been in and out at the place across the street!\" So, don't be fooled by the promise of fast and/or upbeat service implied in the name.  Even though the restaurant was half-empty, the waiter tried to seat us at the corner where the bathroom/kitchen entrance is. Maybe I'm just high-maintenance, but I really don't like sitting by the kitchen and hearing all the pots and pans get banged around (or watching people enter/exit the bathroom), so I asked to move. They let us move, but I did notice that the guy who had seated us didn't come back to our table after that, even though he served the tables adjacent to ours.  Instead a female waitress took our order. We tried to order the spinach omelet, which comes with salsa, cheese and sour cream ($8.25). She informs us that the menu is mis-printed and it's actually the \"Spanish\" omelet. No spinach included. We can, however, create our own omelet. The only problem is that it starts at $6.25 and it's an extra dollar for each thing. So a spinach, salsa, cheese and sour cream omelete is $10.25, not $8.25. It's not really my (or I guess the watress') fault the menu says the wrong thing and hadn't been corrected, and it annoys me that she couldn't just accommodate us. We ended up settling on some other omelet that has bacon, cheese and spinach. (I was trying to eat healthy-ish though so I really didn't want the bacon!)  Then we waited for 20 minutes for the omelet, which is the point at which we said \"maybe we should have just greased out at Chilango.\"  When the food finally came it was decent, although the has browns weren't my favorite -- they didn't stick together well and just fell apart in their grease.  The verdict: this is probably a great greasy spoon if you're not in a hurry and don't mind waitstaff who could care less if your needs are actually met. Otherwise, I might as well go to Dennys...or my own kitchen. 2 stars, because \"Meh, I've experienced better\" is exactly how I feel.",

In fact, if prices were more decent, I would give this place 3 stars.  I also want to mention that last time I went there, the hispanic busser/runner was very friendly and smile a lot which was a far better experience than I got from any of the wait staff.

We had ordered at 2am and our food took an hour and 15 minutes to get, despite being told it would be 45 minutes. We told the phone operator we were paying with cash and only had large bills so we would need change. He said no worries. The delivery person that showed up claimed to not have change and could not go back to get change. Given his demeanor it was almost as if he expected us to give him a $70 some odd dollar tip. We scrambled through our rooms and managed to come up with $20 in bills and change which was just under our tab. We did keep telling him if he went back to get change we could tip and pay in full. He reluctantly took the $20 we had mustered up and saved us a few bucks at least. At any rate... the pizza \u00a0was pretty bad but still edible. The philly cheese was disgusting and they definitely tried to save money by skimping out on the meat. The garlic bread was really hot dog buns with garlic over it. My guess is they ran out of rolls but I mean really?  That was a few months back. Then yesterday morning, me and my friend decided that previous bad service was probably due to it being 2am. So around 12:30pm, we decided to give their day crew a shot, and I mean, how can you mess up breakfast food? We ordered 2 orders of eggs and hasbrowns with toast and waffles. We were told it would be a 45 minutes. At 1:30 I called and politely inquired about the status of my food. I was told the food had left 20 minutes prior and should be there any minute (remember this place is less then 10 minutes from my house).  At 2 I called again and was told he was surprised the food wasn't there and he would call the driver while I stayed on the line. I was told right after that the driver wasn't picking up his phone but should be walking up any minute now. At 2:15 I called again and was told the driver was 15 minutes away. (okay can I mention again that it takes less then 10 minutes to drive there from my house?) At 2:45 my food finally showed up, 2 hours and 15 minutes after I had ordered it.   The eggs were absolutely repulsive and could not be eaten. Out of sheer hunger I tried to mask the taste in hot sauce but had no luck of covering up the awful taste. They had shipped it with an extra order of hashbrowns and thank god because that was the only edible thing (Although I later found I had been charged for those as well). The toast tasted a bit stale (only the part they had soaked in butter I could eat) and of course there was no syrup or butter packets so unless we wanted dry waffles we couldnt eat those.   I will never even consider getting a soda from this place ever again.",

I came here on a Friday night before hitting up a Mark Farina show and I left here wanting to scream and stand outside telling people not to come in. Here's the night in list form:  Diner activity: Only 3 people were sitting when we walked in (THREE).  Waitress: Spaced out, not paying attention, not writing anything down, and slow.  Order taking time: She took our order maybe 10 minutes after seating us.  Food arrival time: I'd say 30 minutes...seriously. And we got our food AFTER two other tables that came in well after us.   Order accuracy: Completely f*cked up. Between the waitress and the kitchen...is the job THAT hard? My corned beef hash had no eggs; one friend said no cheese on her sandwich (lactose intolerant) and it had a nice thick slice of mozzarella; the other friend had to ask for aioli sauce because they didn't put any on the sandwich that has aioli sauce as the key ingredient.   With the number of good eateries in the Castro, Sparky's might as well fizzle out and open that space up to owners who care.  Peace!",

Because after depositing her in a cab, it got professional. Really, what is more attractive than a grown man humping a tree while singing, \"Hips Don't \u00a0Lie\"? I'll tell \u00a0you \u00a0what: A grown man humping a waiter at \u00a0Sparky's while friends in the booth do naughty things with food. We were dubbed \"Brad, Angelina, and Maddox\" by our server, who exhibited the \u00a0patience of a saint while repeatedly reminding us to keep it down and keep our clothes on.  Sparky's is a diner- it's not classy but neither were we last night. I usually end up here after drinking heavily in the surrounding neighborhoods. They're open 24 hours, which I find reassuring in a city that rolls up and goes to bed long before I'm sleepy. This means I can have a double barbecue bacon cheese burger when I really need it: usually around 2 a.m. Their fries are near perfect, they have some very un-dinerlike salads and vegetarian options available, and I distinctly recall pounding mimosas at 1:30 this morning, so they must have those, too.  Food's cheap, the crowd and staff are great entertainment, and they're always open. Just remember to keep your voice down and your shirt on! Server from last night, you rocked our world!",

I cannot help but briefly talk about the waiter - I should've asked his name. He is the dopest waiter I ever saw!!. He's a like a good looking guy in his early 20's. His general demeanor and character was extra-ordinary in an entertaining way!! :) He looked very spacey very shy and introverted. He would not talk to you when you ask him a question but try to communicate with gestures, uncoordinated and vague head movements and quiet babbles!!!.

    "review_text": "The line for lunch on the weekend at Crepevine and Thoroughbread were long so I thought it would be fine to eat at Sparky's since there were plenty of tables and we were starving. I highly regret putting my friends though this, failing to check yelp first, not taking all the empty table as an indication, etc.   First of all, we were seated at a table under the skylight. It would normally be nice to get some sun, except it was so bright that my friends seated at the far end of the table needed to wear sunglasses whilst inside. We requested to be moved to one of the many other available tables, but the waitress wanted to keep us in the same general area (unclear why as the place looks empty from the outside as the tables closer to the front window were kept empty). She did let us move though, but asked us to wait for them to clear the table immediately next to us.   My main complaint is how long everything took. It took at least half an hour before they took our orders, and it took probably another hour and a half before our food came. When we were about 40 minutes into our wait, we saw the table next to us get their food and I think they ordered before we even say down because I didn't see them order in the time we were there.   The food was standard dirty diner fare, I suppose. I ordered chili and it looked like for the cheese, they cut up a Kraft slice into even smaller squares and dumped it on top. It wasn't terrible... Maybe an apt description would be \"very mediocre,\" or \"the epitome of mediocre.\"  The diner was not at all busy while we were there, so I'm not clear on why everything took so long. Looking at the other reviews, I see that this is a common complaint about this place.   I mostly just feel bad for putting my friends through this. Poor decision-making on my part.   The waitress, who otherwise was pretty surly the whole time, did thank us for our patience when we were leaving. I did appreciate that and wonder whether she is used to having people get mad and yell at her for how long things take. We did recognize that she is not entirely to blame for the long wait.   As a whole, I think that it is a poorly run restaurant operation. Maybe it stays in business because late night people have few options. As for during the day, I recommend eating elsewhere... Unless you have about 2.5 hours to kill.",

But I DID go to Sparky's at 1am.  Worst grilled cheese sandwich I've EVER had. How the hell can they fuck THAT up? I dunno but they should get some sort of award for it. Everything I've ever eaten here has, at best, slid down somewhat easily. And at worst, has been awful. Last night, my Sparky's-loving friend hit her limit too when she ordered a turkey sandwich and they brought her chicken. She too is vowing to never go back. And my other friend ordered a glass of white whine, they brought her the bottle to show her, and then returned with a glass of red, saying that they'd run out of white.   And their mac &amp; cheese is an embarrassment to the mac &amp; cheese loving community.  For subpar diner food, it's expensive. AT LEAST the shakes are delicious. I WILL grant them that. However, \u00a0remember in \"Pulp Fiction\" when Travolta says \"A $5 shake? You don't put bourbon in it?\" Yes, those were 1994 prices, but still, your shake here is going to cost $8 after tax and tip and there's no bourbon in it.  From everything my five senses tell me, there are only two reasons to go here: first, because they're open at the witching hour. And second, if you want people to see that you are more rock-hipster than they are (the amount of posturing that goes on here at 2am is unbelievable.) As for the first reason: there are other places open at this time. And as for the second reason, get it through your head that nobody gives a shit... especially at 2am.  One almost feels sorry for the waitstaff, but then you realize that they made their own bed that they're lying in, and it's probably (to them) some weird badge of coolness to work there.

I said okay and they called the delivery guy to try to get him to come back. After 5 minutes, they gave up on the delivery guy and said they were going to have the kitchen re-make the order. It was explained to me that this was GREAT because then I'd be getting it \"all fresh and hot.\" Really? What was my original order going to be? Old and cold?  Oh well, I try to be nice to customer service people cause I know it's a horrid job, so I just said okay and was nice about it. Another 15 minutes later and the delivery guy comes in with my order. For a second, they seemed to ponder trying to give me the cold order, soggy fries and all, but they reconsidered. Another couple minutes passed and they brought out the order from the kitchen and rung me up for the full amount. At this point, I'd been standing in the restaurant for nearly 30 minutes. I said, \"aren't you going to give me a discount for my troubles?\" The guy looked at me like I was crazy and said, \"I'd have to ask my boss. I can't make that decision.\" I said, \"Please do.\"  Wait another 5 minutes while he consults his supervisor in the back office.  \"I'm sorry, my boss said we can't do that at this time.\"  I told him, \"thank you\" and walked out right there. It was the middle of the night and I was starving, but I wasn't going to be treated like crap, given mediocre food AND be expected to pay full price for the privilege.  Congrats Sparky's manager, in your attempt to save a couple bucks, you made the meal twice, got a grand total of $0 and lost me as a customer for good. Clearly the bad service and bad business decisions extend from the top on down. With any luck, this place will be out of business soon and be replaced by one that knows how to treat customers.",

Our punishment for walking in at last call, lol.   Back to Sparky's...  It's open 24hrs and the portion sizes are massive. Perfect place to carb up and stuff yourself silly before passing out after a long night of partying. 'Nuff said.   CALIFORNIA OMELETTE ($8.75) A 3 eggs omelette with melted cheddar cheese, crispy smoked bacon and guacamole. It's served alongside a couple pieces of heavily buttered toast and a choice of either hash browns or home fries.  - It seemed more of a scramble, with the way everything was folded/mixed into the eggs, but it was tasty.

I guess I looked more scrambled than sunny-side-up to them that night....  I ordered a side of hot sausage links and requested that they cook the $hit out of my corned beef hash, because I prefer it crispy. - They ran out of hot links and my corned beef was still a pile of oily mush. It's all good, all that greasy food helped me immensely - woke up with no hangover! Woot!",

    "review_text": "Here are the objective facts:   The place was empty on a recent Sunday night around 1:00 a.m.   Three friends and I walked in and were promptly seated and given menus.   We ordered:   Blueberry pancakes w/ eggs over medium.  Biscuits and Gravy w/ eggs over easy.  Breakfast Burrito w/side of guacamole, side of hash browns and side of bacon.   The two women in my party were convinced by the waiter to share the breakfast burrito because, \"It's huge.\"   We received:  Blueberry pancakes w/eggs over easy.  Two biscuits - no gravy/w eggs over medium, hash browns and guacamole.  Breakfast Burrito.   Here's the editorial: In case you didn't catch it, here's what was wrong:  Eggs were served with the wrong order.  Biscuits and Gravy served without Gravy but with Hash browns and guacamole. Why the hell would I want guacamole and biscuits? Who am I, Colonel Sanders vacationing in Havana?  Breakfast burrito served without hash browns or bacon. And too small to share between two people.   When we asked for the missing orders they were promptly delivered. We received our side of bacon, another side of hash browns and I happily scooped the guacamole away from my biscuits and onto the breakfast burrito. I also received a bowl of lumpy gravy for my biscuits. The kind of gravy that crazy Aunt Wanda makes with her dry pot roast on Sundays. She thinks it's fantastic and the family agrees while winking at each other and crushing lumps of par-cooked flour between their teeth.   I left the gravy in the bowl and ate the biscuits dry because, despite having biscuits and pancakes on the table, we never received the butter that we asked for. In Sparky's defense, and even though they were delivered with the wrong order, the eggs were cooked perfectly.   Before this month, the last time I ate here was about 7 years ago and I had a much better experience back then. In my opinion, the menu is too bloated and they would be better off doing a few things well than doing a lot of items poorly. In the future, I will skip Sparky's and grab a slice of pizza.",

Oh, and to eat as well. And the place is actually open even when the sun is up, not that it really matters to most patrons.  So much of what makes Sparky's a modern San Francisco landmark is unrelated to the food--sure, the menu is huge and the traditional American fare passable to good--which is why I'm not too concerned about the rumored transition to a more upscale pizza-bearing Sparky's.

My boy friends chicken fingers were dry and tasteless, also not eaten. The chili was over salted...also not eaten.   They forgot our milkshake. We reported it to grub hub and they arranged for us to have another delivered...took another hour, but that was actually the only thing that tasted good.  All in all we paid $42 for a milkshake.

When the food came, it was bland and cold. \u00a0It was definitely a two-star experience, but I give them mad props for delivering until four. \u00a0Mad props=one star.  UPDATE: \u00a03/27/09 ==============  So I'm taking away a star for two reasons. \u00a0First, the last time I was in here, the service was atrocious. \u00a0I might be using too kind a word. \u00a0The server wasn't mean; he just didn't check on us, refill our water, or ever bring a drink that one of my companions had ordered. \u00a0Ever. \u00a0And it wasn't exactly busy. \u00a0The guy was literally spending his time brushing his James Iha hair and talking to a girl at another table. \u00a0The other reason I'm removing a star is that although this place now officially does deliver to my place of work (yea!), the food has been cold both times I've ordered, and the delivery takes forever.  UPDATE: \u00a05/29/09 ==============  Late-night vegetarian options or not, it doesn't really matter if they never get your order right. \u00a0How difficult is it to remember an order of fries with a veggie burger? \u00a0And that breakfast comes with toast? \u00a0I'm not usually terribly picky when it comes to 24-hour delivery, but Sparky's has made me dread the delivery man's arrival. \u00a0So I'm done.  UPDATE: \u00a09/12/10 ==============  In addition to its other inadequacies, Sparky's is wheelchair inaccessible. \u00a0It doesn't really help to have a ramp inside the restaurant when you need to climb a step to enter the restaurant.",

I have to admit I peeked. Here's what I found:  Section 4: Ambiance In order to foster a pleasing atmosphere, employees should restrict the restaurant playlist to two genres of music: either pop music from 1980 to 1989, i.e. \"the 80s\", or amateur recordings obtained from friends or produced by independent bands labeling themselves as \"punk\". If the latter, music shall consist of one loudly distorted guitar, one screaming white woman, and one Sock-Em (tm) brand drum kit, available from \u00a0Wal-Mart. Said music shall be played at the loudest possible setting so that patrons must shout to communicate with one another. Excessive noise is essential to the Sparky's brand and employees should endeavor at all times to achieve maximum volume.  Section 9: Employee Attitude Remember, you are the face of Sparky's! In order to maintain our restaurant's unique image, employees should refrain from interacting with customers. Employees shall take every opportunity to remind the customer that the customer is not cool. Communication, when necessary for obtaining orders or payment, shall be delivered with a patina of resentment and bitterness. Under no circumstances is the employee to make a customer feel welcome as that will discourage our target demographic of mid-20, socially active, bellicose, preferably intoxicated men and women known collectively as \"punk\", \"goth\", or \"emo\". Any employee caught smiling, unless in an ironic manner, will be reprimanded and subject to disciplinary action.  That's as far as I got before the waiter snatched it out of my hands. He said something but I couldn't hear him because of my ear plugs.",

I've eaten a late night dinner there once before, but this review is for delivery.   I ordered of a bowl of mac and cheese, along with chicken strips. The mac and cheese was almost flavorless, and arrived in a coffee cup. I don't really have an issue with the latter, but lack of flavor matched up with lack of presentation isn't a great combo. Made me kind of wish I spent 5 times less the amount and just went and picked up a box of Kraft.  I had a major craving for some legit chicken strips, but Sparky's version wasn't at all what most people would have in mind. I expected some meaty, deep friend pieces of chicken. But what I got was a very thin chicken breast, lightly breaded, and then cut into 1/2 pieces after the fact. \u00a0So it was only partially breaded, was extremely dry, and also had very little flavor.  Their mozzarella sticks and cheeseburgers seemed to be solid, but anything else I've ordered was pretty much cafeteria food. But hey, they deliver rather quickly. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong stuff. Or maybe I should just reserve them for drunchies exclusively.",

This is a custom that I'm sure dates back to when Father Junipero Serra's illegitimate children were in the fourth grade. The whole thing with Serra started when he was in Spain or Mexico or something and got word of indigenous people living happy, disease-free lives so he headed north to straighten that shit out. The usual story...white man swoops in and fixes everything and everyone lives happily ever after. Well, except everyone who's not white.   Final Score: Father Serra \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1 Miwok Indians \u00a0 \u00a00  I guess I digress from the point of this review which of course is Sparky's.   Sparky's is not far from Mission San Francisco de Asis which is where I took my fourth grader. Since this is a major project (I believe it goes on his permanent record...Flash forward 20 years. He's on an important job interview. The second interview actually. The conversations had been going well to that point. In this interview, however, my son senses an chill in the room. \"Son,\" the interviewer says, \"We love your work history, Great grades at Cal and all that but we just got word of the shabby job you did on your papier mache model of the San Francisco Mission. We're very sorry.\") After a triumphant couple of hours at the mission, you can't just go home. A celebration was in order. So of course, we headed to Sparky's. I was surprised to find that we were the only father and son there with a bag from the Mission giftshop but we were.  We were warmly greeted even though I told the host that we were just there for a hot chocolate and a coffee. I augmented my coffee with an order of huevos rancheros and my son ordered a cheeseburger and fries. The huevos were out of this world. Seriously. I was in heaven. I even ate the first few bites without my beloved Tapatio since anything tastes good bathed in Tapatio. I wanted to see if these huevos could stand on their own two feet, so to speak. Fantastic.  The burger was good. Not great. The fries were a bit better than that. I think the burger would have been better at 3 am for some reason.  Sparky's was a great way for me to close the final chapter on California Mission reports. As Missions go, I'd rate my experience with Mission San Juan Capistrano and even Mission San Juan Bautista to be superior to San Francisco but Sparky's provided the best post-Mission meal.",

If anything, without them giving the place some hip, \"happening\" ambiance, this place has descended to a-leg-up-Happy Donuts stature. The place looks squalid and run-down, at least Happy Donuts employees are quick with their feet.  Their ho-hum, slop-house, greasy concoctions are exorbitantly priced, which can be excusable when on a drunken stupor, but even then the selection is poor and not very well-thought-out.  And how about their online delivery service? DREADFUL! They take their sweet time! I waited for an hour and a half only for the delivery person to miss a number on my phone and the entire transaction was shot to hell! I don't know about you, but: though the instructions say to call instead of ringing the bell, and I get one digit of that number off, I would have rung the bell anyway just to complete a transaction. Not only would I have not lost a customer, but I'd have not squandered the time of travel, not to mention, the gas money. I suggest you take off your online/delivery service since you're no good at it.  As I said, Sparky's Diner, you're lucky people go out on the weekends, otherwise you'd have no one to peddle your mediocre (at best!) food to.

Our quest was not as adventure-filled as Harold and Kumar's but still a bit of a journey. And alas! Sparky's is open!!  Technically I've never went inside Sparky's but my friends got food to-go while I waited in the car. So my experience is curbside but still a good experience nonetheless.   We opted for the cheesecake and mixed berry pie (wound up with pecan pie somehow but was not disappointed with the mix up). It was good and satisfing but it was the tea that did me over.  HANDS DOWN THE BEST CHAI TEA I'VE HAD THUS FAR!!  I got so excited and couldn't wait for it to cool that I burned my tongue drinking it. We all know how a fuzzy tongue is incredibly obnoxious but it was worth it. \u00a0I couldn't finish the tea that night b/c I was so tired and my tongue hurt. I still craved it in the morning so.... don't judge me, but I reheated it in the microwave. Tossing it would have been such a waste of good tea!",

Not only that but he sat down next to me and got a little too close to my face which made me more than uncomfortable.  AND: Even though there were 2 other people in the whole place - we waited around 25 minutes and never got our food, so we asked nicely if we could get it in a to-go box.  Here's the kicker: When we got our stuff to go, we got home and looked in the bag, and IT WASN'T IN IT. They didn't even give us what we paid for.

    "review_text": "We went here on Christmas evening out of desperation to find a place that was open. Unfortunately, I didn't take the time to read any reviews before we went. When we arrived, there were two or three other tables seated. There was only one server working, but this seemed easy enough to handle. The place started to fill up and the server, although friendly enough, began running around like a chicken with his head cut off. It wasn't all his fault- there were about 4 other people working (delivery guys, possibly?) who were sitting down at the cash register while he was taking care of about 12 tables by this time, not offering him any help whatsoever! We should've taken it as a cue to cut our losses when the table next to us, that was already there when we arrived still didn't have their food about 20 minutes after we'd ordered. Not to mention the table of two parents and a toddler on the other side of us, who sat down before us, but still had not even had their order taken at this point! So we finally received our food after about a 30 minute wait. I ordered a turkey burger and chili cheese fries and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the heart-stopper burger (medium rare). He began setting down our plates and reciting back to us what they were- first, disco fries. Nope, I ordered chili cheese fries. His response...\"Oh, you did order those. But the thing is, I put the order in as disco fries. But I can bring you a side of chili if you want. These have gravy and cheese on them\" No thanks. Next on the table, veggie burger. Nope, I ordered a turkey burger. \"Oh yes, a turkey burger. This is a turkey burger.\" (Bless his heart). The burger was horribly overcooked. I would have liked some mustard, but I actually felt bad asking him for anything else at this point, so I slathered it with ketchup and dipped it in the cheese/gravy mixture from the unwanted disco fries. Completely inedible. So I settled for just eating the fries, which were cold, but I was starving and it was the least disgusting thing on the table. Now onto my fianc\u00e9's burger, which was overcooked and chewy. Ew. Let's just say that his stomach is not feeling all that great, so we are holding out hope that he doesn't get a last minute gift of food poisoning. After we were finished, I knew it would be ages if I asked the server for the check, waited for him to bring it, gave him our credit card, and waited for him to run it. So as soon as I got his attention, I handed him our card, and since he didn't seem bothered by the fact that there was an almost completely uneaten turkey burger left on my plate, I told him it was inedible and asked him to take it off the bill, which he did. We signed the check and ran out of there as fast as possible. The poor couple with the toddler still had not received any food at this point, even though they'd asked him to bring the kid's pancake out as soon as possible. On the way out, we walked by the other employees chillin' at the register on their cell phones, with zero acknowledgment, or even a glance from any of them. Merry Christmas!",

Every other late-night diner in the City is worlds better, and when those other diners are Mel's and Lori's that's saying a lot, because those places aren't so hot.

Cheese fries, Apple Pie milkshake, I had the chicken parmesan \u00a0&amp; he had fettuccine carbonara. The waitress was nice but not intrusive which was great for us. All the staff was having a good time it seemed &amp; the other patrons were happy as well. We both left full &amp; happy! \u00a0  The second time we both went again (this time earlier, around 6pm) not as great as the first time. The waitress seemed like she didnt really want to be there/wanted to be doing other things besides waiting on people. We both had the fetticini alfredo with prawns which was really creamy (which we both loved, hate that thin sauce other places use) the prawns were alright though mine were overcooked &amp; tasted a little too fishy for my liking. The music sucked this time (staff chooses music I guess? but it wasnt fun stuff like the first time we went) We had to ask our waitress to do things that should just be done in the first place I thought like bringing ketchup for fries.

I have ordered from Sparky's before to get breakfast delivered to me to cure my hangover. The eggs benedict was good, hashbrowns ok, and the side of bacon came in this little bag full of several slices of bacon. No skimming on the bacon, thank you!  With these kinds of places, I try to pick the menu item least likely to be botched. After last night's jaiger/redbull sprint, at 3am I decided to order the garlic fries, side of bacon (because why not), and wings.  I was very surprised that the fries were actually crispy, they used real minced garlic to season, and they were still hot. No weird sogginess. The wings were pretty good, and the ranch was ok - a touch watery but manageable.   I don't know if this was a fluke, and I'm almost too afraid to order again, but I know I have to try it again, because any place that can serve ok food at 4am or bring you breakfast at 1pm is a keeper.   There was absolutely nothing that disappointed me last night, I got exactly what I expected, but even a touch better - because the fries weren't soggy.  So for purely scientific reasons, I will try this again.",

Regardless, we found our way perfectly fine thanks to his city savvyness. Parking wasn't as bad as I thought- but that just might have been luck. There wasn't any wait either- so that was probably luck too! We were seated right away, in a nice kinda dim neon lit place. I loved the ambiance. Call me sleazy but I \u00a0feel relaxed in neon lights, sitting next to a juke box. Not to mention that they also played some awesome music- (I heard a lot of old school Q-Tip and ATCQ). I wasn't too starving, but my dude was. He got some kind of spicy sandwich and was loving it. I ordered the chicken caesar salad and thought it was pretty good for a diner- a lil too generous with the dressing but no complaints here cause they gave me a fat piece of grilled chicken to go along with! Definitely coming back here if I'm in the city in the wee hours of the morning all poisoned out. Yeee!",

At the end of the meal, the waiter brought our tab, which I paid with my check card. \u00a0I was a little stunned to sign off on a $24 bill for just a burger and fries, but I quietly paid up.  When I sat down to do my finances for the past couple of weeks, I sorted all my receipts out and noticed I had two from Sparky's - the itemized one, and the one I'd signed. \u00a0Lo and behold, they were different. \u00a0The original bill? \u00a0$17. \u00a0Looking closer, the table numbers didn't match up. \u00a0They ran my card for the wrong tab!  I wrote the restaurant and enclosed a photocopy of the two receipts. \u00a0A week later, I got a check for the $6 and change difference. \u00a0OK, fine. \u00a0A classy joint might have refunded the whole tab or sent along a gift certificate to make up for their error and entice me back, but whatever.  My problem was with the scolding letter that accompanied the check. \u00a0After a brief apology, the sender wrote \"Mistakes happen and [the waiter] was probably very busy, so please always check your bill.\"  The place wasn't particularly busy - lots of open tables. \u00a0Others have complained about slow service, and I certainly didn't see our waiter putting on much hustle. \u00a0I have had tabs at all kinds of bars and restaurants that were far busier than Sparky's, and have never had my card charged for the wrong tab. \u00a0And when the card is in the little pleather folder with the tab it's supposed to be run for? \u00a0There is NO excuse, NONE. \u00a0The subtle blaming of \"you should always check your bill\" plus the excuse-making is totally inappropriate for a business communication. \u00a0You screw up? \u00a0You fix it and apologize, period.  I won't be going back to Sparky's, because I don't want to have to worry that some inattentive wait staff is going to overcharge my card, get my order wrong, forget to bring my card back at all, who knows what? \u00a0If the attitude the management takes is \"mistakes happen,\" they can forget about my business.",

However, that was part of the charm. Considering it was 11 at night on a week day, it was nice that a place with such a wide selection was open.  We were seated by a guy who was nice and chatty, the way I like my waiters. After about ten minutes of talking, I indulged myself in a cornucopia of drunk food, getting a three stack of buttermilk pancakes, french fries, and a soda. The beer and wine selection was small but respectable, from which I had the merlot.   The food came right at that time where you are about to get impatient, but then it comes so you're satisfied. The sizes were great and the food was delicious. In the interest of full disclosure, my friend's greek salad had a hair in it. However, I did not dock Sparky's because it was not my meal. Merely don't order the salad and you won't get hairs. My flawless logic at work again.  The once-daunting atmosphere turned into an interesting collection of drunken drag queens, unhappy couples, and tourists out late. At one point my friend made a joke at which point this boisterous flamboyantly gay guy at the next table started laughing hysterically. All in all, these are my kind of people for a late night drunk run.  The meal ended up costing my about $20 with tip and some of the selections were pricey enough to dissuade me from purchase (the $5 grilled cheese line was crossed, if I remember correctly). Still, if you know what you are getting into, Sparky's is a perfect throwback to those late night college diners with interesting characters and tasty food.",

Figured oh well i probably wouldnt have finished them anyway so i let it slide. Sandwhich is pretty good, tastes like a salad inbetween two pieces of bread. When we left to pay the waiter noticed we never got our mashed potatos so he took the fries off the bill and only charged us for the sandwhich. yay.",

I had high hopes for Sparky's ability to satisfy my Sunday night waffle craving. I searched high and low on the internet for a place that serves Belgium waffles at 8:30pm and Sparky's was the only place I came across. My previous experiences with Sparky's had been decent, but I had only ordered breakfast once there (about 4 years ago) and the rest of my meals had been hamburgers.  The place had probably 10 other patrons besides myself, my boyfriend, my brother, and our friend, Nika. We seated ourselves and were brought menu's quickly (but that's where the promptness ended). The menu had a full selection - pizza, breakfast, burgers, sandwiches, salads, milkshakes. My favorite item on the menu, name-wise, has to be the Paris Hilton pizza - clams, shrimp, and garlic. Gross. The Elton John is another good one - a pizza with all different types of meat, haha (1 star)!  The server took 10-15 minutes to come around to take our orders (even though all the other tables had been handled). My boyfriend ordered a pizza, I got my Belgium waffle (no whip cream, but berries and powdered sugar, please) and a side of eggs and bacon, my brother had a chicken Ceaser salad, and Nika had some type of omelette.   The food took FOREVER to arrive. I'm talking 15 or 20 minutes when the place is empty. Once it arrived, I was definitely disappointed. First off, it had no whipped cream, but it didn't have the berries and powdered sugar on it like the menu stated. Second, it was super thin and burnt! Now, I've never been to Belgium, but I know what a Belgium waffle is supposed to look like - BIG, thick, and NOT BURNT. The eggs were ok, but the bacon was awful. It tasted like it had been cooked in the wrong substance. The bacon tasted sour and left a horrible taste in my mouth. The whole meal was a huge disappointment and the service sucked! Everyone else fared a little better - it was \"decent\" (word used by all three people). Nothing to write home about, but curbed the hunger just fine. The only thing that was really good was my boyfriend's espresso/mint shake (.5 star).  As you can imagine, it took our server another 10-15 minutes to bring us our bill, even after clearing plates away. I was so upset by the waffle fiasco, I forced everyone to go with me to Mel's right after our meals so I could order a waffle to get the taste of Sparky's out of my mouth. Now Mel's doesn't do a fantastic job on just about anything, but their waffles were at least plump, not burnt, and had fruit on them. Oh, and Mel's has crayons, but that's for another review...  The point of the story is I will not go back to Sparky's except under extreme circumstances of life or death hunger and I will stick what they can do decently.",

    "review_text": "The food is good, but my relationship with Sparky's is coming to an end (or perhaps a long, long hiatus) because I just can't with the delivery service.   I fully understand that their busiest time is during the late hours of the weekend -- I do! This is why I always assume it will take longer than the 45-60 minute delivery timeframe. Earlier this summer, I called to follow up after about an hour and 45 minutes passed. The woman who answered the phone (the same person who had taken my order) seemed very confused and put me on hold. When she came back, she offered \"Oh...uh...yes. the driver, his car broke down...but he'll be right there.\" That's fine. Notice would have been nice, or I could have walked to Church and 18th in less time than this, but I know they're busy. The food appeared 30 minutes later (...two hours after the initial order), miraculously still hot. Things happen, though, and it was the weekend -- so I wasn't really annoyed.   Some time after that, I called and placed an order and the person seemed a-ok! An hour and a half went by; I gave it a few more minutes then called (given my past experiences) just to make sure that everthing was okay. The person who answered the phone said she would have to get back to me. She called back a half hour later and, to make a long story short, they totally lost the order. As two hours had passed by that point, I just said to forget it, but my card had been charged (I knew this from looking; she had no record of anything). She couldn't find the transaction, so I gave my card # to her so that she could void it. As an apology, she offered $5 off my next order; she told me it was already noted with my phone number so whoever took the call the next time would know to deduct it.  In a recent (weak) moment of hunger, I thought, '''Perhaps I have misjudged Sparky's!\" -- I placed an order and mentioned the $5 off. I explained that this was offered because they lost my order the last time, it should be under my phone number, etc. Even though I was by no means insistent (...it's $5), the person accused me of trying to scam them (\"How do I know you're not making this up?\") and told me that they never do this, she had no idea what I was talking about, and that I'd have to speak with the person who made the offer. While I did actually remember the person's name, she didn't work until the following week, so it was a moot point. She grudgingly offered a \"piece of cake, on me\" which I think I declined (it was included, anyway, which was nice). I didn't really care about the $5 -- it's $5! -- it's just the point.   After this last experience -- not to mention all the previous ones -- I just don't think it's worth the hassle. 1 star for service, 3 for food = 2 stars.   The Apple Pie milkshake = amazing, though, I will say.",

Time After Time, just Like A Prayer you'll find Wild Horses at Sparky's enjoying some basic balance-out-the-liquor type cuisine. If you're lucky they might even que up a little Dolly for ya.",

    "review_text": "Boooooooo  So went here last night for pride weekend shenanegans. We were so hungry and were happy to find something open. We were seated immediately and ready to order. We sat and watched 3 other parties get seated around us and their orders got taken before us. We had to ask repeatedly for our waitress to come take our order, since she obviously forgot about us. She finally takes our order and then the waiting game continues... FOR ANOTHER 45 MINUTES. We were there for OVER AN HOUR waiting for 2 burgers and a breakfast burrito.... I MEAN COME ON when we asked the waitress what happened to our food, she said they lost the ticket or it was hidden so the kitchen didnt start making our food until 45 after we ordered.... we watched the parties around us get their food, finish eating, pay and leave. and we were STILL waiting. at that point it was a matter of principle, we werent leaving until we got our food. My roommate and i had to ask the manager where our food was, finally it comes out. He offered us free drinks, we asked for free food. They took the burrito off the bill, we still had to pay for the burgers and fries. MY ORDER WAS WRONG, i orded the vegan sandwich \"guacamole, olives, artichoke, onions\" i got the vegan BURGER. but i didnt feel like reporting the mistake, i didnt want to wait for another hour.... The food is nothing special, just diner food. not worth the wait awful experience ruined our night wish we hadnt left tip wish we hadnt paid period  1 star for the hard working host boy person who sat us so quickly. he was wearing a red shirt and literally sprinting back and forth all night, for the entire 1.5 hours we were there he was working so hard running around. my roommate said \"thats how he stays skinny.\" Cute kid, should have given him tip instead.  we will never go back",

    "review_text": "Booo! Disappointment...  Came here last night, mostly because I couldn't think of any options that didn't involve a drive-through...or cooking. I checked out their menu online and quickly realized they serve EVERYTHING, so since I was being indecisive, I figured that \"everything\" was a good option.  Got there, walked in, looked around for a signal of whether I should seat myself or...??? Hmm. No one was paying attention. So I just picked a table and sat down. It was semi-crowded for a Monday night (mostly college aged folks) but I suppose since there was only server waiting on those 8 or so tables, it took her a while to get around to us to take our order. I kinda felt bad for her. She seemed tired.  I ordered the turkey club with a side salad and my hubby got a bacon cheeeburger with fries and a banana shake. Sides are extra add-ons here, but they're only around $1.50 - $2.50, depending on what you're adding. The shake was a whopping 5 bucks, but it was the most delicious thing we ordered - big chunks of fresh banana, creamy vanilla bean ice cream with a neat little mountain of whipped cream on top. I asked my husband if I could have a sip and I ended up drinking the whole thing. He should've known better :)  The rest of the meal was just \"meh\". The bacon in the turkey club was the best part of it - thick and crispy. But the turkey itself had an odd taste to it. Come to think of it, I know why the turkey tasted funny. It's the way turkey tastes when it's close to or past expiration. It took me a few bites to realize it, and by then I was kinda grossed out. My husband ate half his burger and there was a little pink in the middle of the meat patty even though he ordered it well done. Undercooked meat grosses him out, so that was another fail.  I doubt I'll be back, unless it's to grab a milkshake. Those things are like crack.",

I've had very good experiences where I received good, hot, fresh-tasting food, and other experiences where the ingredients tasted old, the bread was soggy, and the service was just slow.  The only real thing that Sparky's has going for it is that it's open all the time. This is not to be undervalued! Need a shake or some nachos or something after a long night on the town?

Luckily it was only a little bit of 'C'.  My meal was delivered in about an hour by a quick and efficient dude. \u00a0At first glance my meal was wrapped up pretty nicely. I got everything I ordered: \u00a0cheese fries with cheese on the side, hamburger with cheese AND extra mayo (on the side), and a meatloaf sandwich.  The fries were a little cold and came out either chewy or really crunchy. The meatloaf sandwich was TINY and it LOOKED like meatloaf but didn't really TASTE like meatloaf and my cheeseburger was a little soggy on the bottom bun but whatever; both sandwiches came with a pickle, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce.  Even though I expected a lot worse and was fairly surprised when I didn't get it, I probably won't order from Sparky's again. \u00a0I may venture out there if I'm dancing the night away in the Castro and I'm up for some late night eats or if I'm craving really good milkshake, which seems to be what Sparky's all about.  P.S Quick question, Sparky: \u00a0what's type of cheese do you guy's use for your cheese fries. \u00a0Why is it so sour?",

Although the service isn't so bad, the cleanliness of the diner and timeliness of receiving your order are unacceptable. I've been going to Sparky's for about 5 or 6 years now and have noticed major changes since the new management. The worst part is that not only will you pay to eat s***y food (because it is pretty much SF's only 24/hr diner) you will pay to see the manager yell at his employees right in front of your table. Maybe it's their idea of dinner and show? Whatever it is...Sparky's is solely still in business because \u00a0unfortunate San Francisco dwellers have no where else to eat, s***, or sleep (only plus is I get to check out the hapa server).

Both customer service and food proved to be decent, as evidenced by my lack of a scowl while exiting the restaurant and the fact that, 9 hours later, I don't have a tummy ache.  I had the biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and sausages. Not bad, and I actually liked the country gravy that was served.

Another person in my party ordered macaroni and cheese and didn't eat it because he said the cheese tasted like \"melted plastic\" Our server did as much as he could, so nothing was wrong there.  One thing that is unjustified here is the pricing. It was like $7.35 or something just for a veggie burger that came with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a pickle. it was an extra dollar for mushrooms and guacamole, and another $1.85 for fries. I could get the same thing at Herbivore, with a real veggie burger, for less than that, and it would have been way better.  Sparky's, if I can avoid you when I'm looking for a late-night meal, then I most definitely will.",

It started out as just an error...I ordered a pizza, and two hours later called to see if it was still coming. The gal said no, I said fine, just process the credit card refund. She told me I needed the manager, I went on hold. After ten minutes, I hung up and called back. This time I was given the manager who didn't apologize about the missed delivery, which I noted but didn't really care about, but when I asked for my refund he gave me attitude, said he needed me to call back the next day cause he was apparently unable to figure out a refund. When I said Hey, you messed up my order, can't you at least help me get my money back? He told me to fuck off, and hung up on me.  Check it out...I added my credit card receipts since May 9th from Sparkys. $827. Imagine that, I spent $827 in just 6 weeks, can you imagine a better customer?

Ok now on to my review. this place is really mediocre. There is nothing outstanding about the food at all. The portions are way smaller than most diners and the dishes are more expensive. I have ordered everything from tuna melts to eggs to pastrami sandwiches and shakes, it's all pretty average. so for food you could do better before all the other restaurants in the area close.   Now for the wait staff....ANNOYING. i dont need some coked up ass getting all \"fun\" and in my face when i am ordering, sparky's thinks this is cute and cutting edge, i just think it sucks. If the wait staff isnt hyped up and obnoxious then they are feigning this apathetic vibe that just crawls under my skin. just take my order and be chill and leave me alone is pretty much what i want.   so yeah i am giving this place a 2 stars because there food isnt god awful and they are open 24 hours, but all that needs to happen for that extra star to go away is any decent place also opening up its doors all night long.   thanks sparkys but no thanks i'll order seniores instead.",

Came here with a large ish group and not being familiar with the area too well, we looked and saw that they had seating, so we took the chance and went in.  We were seated quite promptly and ordered from a truly vast array of items on the menu. I LOVE the fact that you can order breakfast at anytime. There are sometimes where this cheetah will be craving some eggs in the late night, so the fact that this is available kind of makes my day ^ ^  Our group split into two tables and our table decided to split the checks. I always hate doing that cause I feel it makes things complicated for the waiter, but he took our request with no problem. I have to say, the waiter was an absolute sweetheart. He was busy and had some tough stuff happen prior, but he was super nice to all of us in our group and was very genuine. Perfect service.  So now the food! Me and my other friend in the group decided to cater to our dinner time breakfasty desires and went for an omelette. The portions here are BIG, and the omelette was served with toast and hash browns. Everything was cooked perfectly and was full of flavor. Definitely satisfied.   I am so happy to have found this restaurant and for sure I'll be checkin it out again when I'm in the area. Great food, wonderful service, heck, the meal ended with some small talk with the waiter and a cook. It was a great experience for us all, and this is definitely a place I would highly recommend to others.  Loved it.  *Chirp!*",

Point being, anyone who Doesn't talk to a homeless guy walking down the street bawking and rawking is a poser and a douchebag and should probably move back to whatever shit-smeared corn-hole state they came from.   So anyway, the server/waitperson/manager/tool (who really shouldn't have been judging as he was clearly emulating the fashion sense of the much more friendly and genuinely shit smeared fellow outside) asks me: \"Are you friends with that guy?\" To which I respond cheerfully: \"Yeah, I guess... Maybe as of 5 minutes ago.\" To which this intolerant turd termite has the temerity to say: \"Get out.\" I tried to belligerently argue with him for the greater part of two minutes (much to my girl friend's mortification), at which point he smugly informs me he's going to call the cops.

The other night, my friends were getting really hungry and it was super late so we decided to go here because it's 24 hours.   The place is spacious but nothing special. Kind of grimy. We were seated right away but overall service was sub par.   We were a pretty big group. 6 people total. We took a while to decide what to order, but it took even longer for us to get our waiter to come over and take out order.   I ordered a tuna melt. My friends ordered chili cheese fries/patty melt, vegetarian burger/mac and cheese/mocha mint shake, personal pepperoni pizza, and onion rings/cheesy fries respectively. It took maybe a little less than 20 minutes to get our food.  When the food arrived, I wasn't impressed. Flipped my tuna melt to see that it was blackened on the other side meaning they tried to hide it. I ate it anyway. It was okay.   I split that tuna melt with my friend for half of his patty melt. I liked that one better because it was heartier, but it was also just okay. Chili cheese fries were okay. Canned chili and processed cheese.   I tried the onion rings, the mocha shake, and the mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was okay, not a lot of flavor. Onion rings were good. Mocha shake was delicious.   Tried to get our server's attention for the check. It took ten minutes because he wasn't paying attention to us. He was watching TV.   Got our check to find that gratuity was added without us being informed about it. Apparently groups of 6 automatically adds gratuity. I understand this, but I don't like that he didn't tell us about it and I don't like that the gratuity was 18%. The service we received was not worth 18%.   The friend who eats here the most tells me that the service is not usually as piss poor as it was that night. We all assume that this is because it was past midnight but still.

First off, beans \u00a0tasted like they came straight from a can (that can easily be remedied with a little seasonings and a bit more cooking... mr stoner chef), the salsa was tasteless, the eggs came fried and sandwiched already between two tortillas. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Buzz! \u00a0I'm all for creativity and personal expression - but ordering huevos ranchero's from Sparky's is kinda like when some lame band totally bollixes up one of your favorite songs when trying to cover it.   What made it more irritating was that my friends spinach and mushroom omelette was not only perfectly serviceable, but it was actually pretty darn good. If only I picked the correct menu item my breakfast may have turned out fine... do yourself a favor - when ordering from Sparky's menu - keep it simple, don't order \"foreign\" exotic things like huevo's ranchero's",

Once upon a time I would rant and rave about the deliciousness of your mashed potatoes, especially after a long evening in Dolores Park. I took my mother here for my birthday one year. Oh, Sparkey's you used to be so great, now, WHAT THE F*CK HAPPENED?  Sometime around when you changed your menu everything fell apart. The service went to sh\u00a1t, the prices all went up, I wouldn't be surprised if you decided to cut your hours soon. I mean, really, is it that hard for your waiters to put menus on my table? To repeat my order so they don't mess it up (which at 3 in the morning you seem to be doing a lot now)? How about asking me if I want whipped cream on my mocha? Is 2 seconds just 2 seconds more than you can bother with?  I miss the old days a lot, Sparkey's. When that waiter with the red hair would laugh his way through the day, make sure we had everything we wanted and even accommodate a rambunctious group of *possibly* intoxicated high school sophomores at two nearby booths because there were too many to fit into one. Those where the days when I didn't mind rounding up to the nearest dollar, even if it meant a 30% tip.  You've changed, Sparkey's, you've really changed. It breaks my heart every time I pass by and decide I'm not quite as hungry as I thought I was. Now, come 3 am, I think I'll just visit the Safeway kitty-corner from you \u00a0for a microwave dinner or some eggs and frozen fries so I can go home and feed myself -- at least that way I can be sure that my water glass will always be full.

When Gisselle asked one of the boys to get an order from the back for her, he completely ignored her and brushed her off. And they rest standing around him didnt help out either. Very rude.   At the time I was there and I'm sure it gets worse, there were plenty of \"creepy\" and very strange people in the area. As well as some other inconsiderate employees. Seems to me that regardless of the jerks she has to put up with she still continues trying to multitask and is very polite as well as actually maintaining great customer service.  Ive walked in a few times and she is the one and only person I can ever get takeout from because unlike anyone else, she actually tries to suggest various things that would fit what I'm craving at the moment. She is of great help to the customers and such a joy to see when you walk in.

The name Sparky just really gets under my skin and she knows it - which is why she enjoys saying it to me all the time!  After having dined at Sparky's for the first time on Friday night, though, I'm starting to soften on good ol' Sparky. Maybe it was the huge booth that seated 6 of us, or the doughy pizza's that soaked up happy hours sloshing around in our tums, or maybe it was how quickly they brought it all to out. Whatever it was, I might...MIGHT... be okay with the name Sparky now. \u00a0  I might be even more okay with it when I come back at 3AM after an even longer night of drinking. Hell, I might even love it.",

    "review_text": "\"We probably have the LEAST picky customers on earth!\" - Breaking Bad  Let's break down the Sparky's situation. I've never been there during the day and I bet no one else has either. However, at 5 am, when your stomach is literally burning and your dignity has been left at some bar on the other side of town, Sparky's is the place to stop on the way home. As I'm usually the Designated Driver, I take my carload here to sober them up and stuff them with food. Their food is the kind of food you eat in a pinch when you're on the highway, running from the law, with a bag of clothes, a dream and a guitar... wait, I digress. Wind on your back... no, seriously, Sparky's, San Francisco, and I'm back...  Anyway, food = meh. But, there is a wide variety of meh food, and seeing as you or your carload of people WILL be drunk when you go there - not a problem.   The service varies, probably depending on how many annoying people they've had to deal with that night. (hint: if you're a sober person who makes their lives easier, the service gets better.)  Here's what RULES about Sparky's:  - Your carload of 30-something friends currently acting 4 1/2 will be tolerated at this establishment.   - From my experience Sparky's appears to be clothing-optional.   - The food comes on large plates for slightly high prices, but again - drunk people are not picky.  - Various folk tell me their milkshakes are quite good.  - They serve espresso drinks all night! YES - this is for me, the DD and wrangler of a carload of fools.   - They have a lot of tables and they move them quickly.   - They have a jukebox with a variety of musical styles. Usually, if you are the DD, you can hear your own music because the rest of the place is too drunk to figure out where the music is coming from.   - They actually deliver to a small area -- even espresso. Did I mention espresso? Because I like espresso. Just sayin'.. espresso. However, if you do order delivery - you should be drunk when consuming the food.  Warning: Their bathrooms are disgusting with frequent clogs of the undefined type.",

    "review_text": "Me and a friend randomly searched for a 24 hour diner in my GPS at around 1am on a Tuesday night, and this was the first place to pop up. Kinda surprised to find ourselves in the Castro District, but hey no problem there.  It's kind of creepy walking into the place though. Before we even got into this place, we got scared by this creepy looking mummified doll staring at us from the kitchen window. Then when we walk in, we get greeted by both another creepy looking doll, this one presumably of Sparky, and a surly looking waitress that did nothing that night except sit in the corner. If we weren't starving we woulda been gone, but we needed some food.  The food here was pretty good though. More than made up for the creepy intro. Me and my friend definitely got what we paid for. I ordered 2 pork chops, 2 eggs, and 2 pancakes. My friend ordered the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. Oh man, the pork chops were not what I was expecting. I was expecting just some plain pork chops, but the ones I got were covered in gravy. It was delicious. It got a little salty after awhile but man it was so good. The pancakes were perfect also. I've been so used to eating the sub-par flat pancakes from places like IHop and Dennys that I forgot how real pancakes tasted like. One pancake here was about as thick as two pancakes at any of those chain diners. Super fluffy also. It had the texture of a memory foam mattress. Seriously, I pressed my fork down on it, and it sprang back up just like foam. I bet if they stacked a few of these pancakes up, I'd have the most delicious pillow ever. They were a thing of beauty. My friend said that his Philly Cheese Steak was good, but the Mac and Cheese he got along with it was bad. I tried it to make sure it wasn't just his taste buds, and yeah it was bad. No flavor at all. Kind of sad.  This was a pretty cool place though. It's nice knowing that there's good 24 hour food places open in the city. Gonna be heading here after those late nights of shenanigans in the city.",

    "review_text": "The Case of the Half Eaten Burger   It was a windy night. The wind so strong, it could peel the paint off a railroad apartment, making the bottom of my trench coat flap like so many middle aged housewives' upper arms.   I was on Church Street, and I crossed the street car tracks to find refuge in a diner. The food looked warm, the wait staff cold, and young bucks coming down from whatever drunken debauchery looked comfortable in their booths. I wanted that comfort.   I walked in, largely ignored, and figured I'd find a seat myself. If there's anything I've learned in six years back in the Fog, it's that if you want anything, you have to grab it yourself.   And there I saw her, blonde hair parted to one side as if she had something to hide, huddled in a booth like she was up to no good. Of course she was up to no good, what dame isn't?   I threw my coat in the booth and removed my scarf like it was a five-pound wool necktie. This was my seat, and I was taking it.   Of all the burger joints in all the predominantly gay neighborhoods in this city, you pick this one? And this booth?   This one's closer. It's open 24 hours. And they have shakes, I lied. I'd seen this skirt's gams from the window outside, beckoning me in like a pair of flesh-colored, homewrecking lures, and I was a trout looking for a bite.   She looked at me sideways, like I couldn't be trusted. But these days, who can you trust in this town? Not the broads. Definitely not the coppers. Not even your friends. And no one would trust a hard-boiled fella like me, swarthy and ripe as a pile of dog crap at the end of a fishing pier on a sunny day. So I wasn't surprised.   I'll have the Superb Burger, she told the curt waitress, pierced up and full of holes like a piece of Swiss cheese at the end of a shooting range.   The Superb Burger's a real piece of work. Known affiliates: Bacon. Cheese. Avocado. A legendary trio in these parts, and any dame who's in with them, is in with me. I let down my guard and trusted her.   We gnawed on our burgers, not so superb even with the Holy Trinity working for them, and the conversation flowed like some gargantuan river in a balmy South American rainforest - steady in parts, choppy in others, deep and shallow. And the Swiss cheese waitress was kind enough never to interrupt our gabber. Either that or she'd just plain forgotten about us, which suited me just fine.   All the while the grooves were being shimmied out of the best diner jukebox this town's ever seen; a music machine to rival some of the better gin joints out there, with grooves even the most hardened barfly would raise his tumbler of whiskey to.   The shakes were pretty respectable, too. After shaking down Swiss Cheese and gumshoeing the plastic-coated menu, I found out they were supplied by a guy named Mitchell, apparently well known around these parts for his frozen moo juice. I'd have to pay this Mitchell a visit one of these nights, and sleuth just what he puts into his wares to make everyone so crazy for them, like they've been sucking on a peace pipe full of loco weed.   Between the good grooves and the good gab with Blondie, I almost forgot there was even a mystery here. Leave it to a well-stocked jukebox and a well-stacked dame to get in the way of a good story. It'll happen every time.   By the wee hours of the night, the time when the freaks come out and good people lay to rest, I sent the skirt off in a cab - she was good people, after all.   I walked back to my pad through the wind and the darkness of yet another night in Fog City, and I wondered what the hell the mystery of this story would be. Then it hit me   How bad does a bacon and avocado cheeseburger have to be for me not to eat the whole thing?",

Service is also pretty average, but what do you expect from a place that's open all day/night? The food comes out pretty fast, I think our whole order came out within 15 minutes and we had a sandwich w/fries, grilled cheese w/curly fries, and a breakfast plate.

I also probably passed out while eating it.  Regardless, it did not prevent a hangover.  Fast forward a few years, I'm back at Sparky's. Very sober and anxious to try things that were not on my radar the first go around, namely the house veggie burger and parfait.

Our waiter was...an imbecile. I don't even know how I could sugar coat it. One of my friends is a Belgian waffle fiend and ordered it, while my other friend and I decided on TWO-yes TWO orders of fries (I will explain the emphasis on TWO later).  We sat there impatiently waiting for our food to arrive since we were 3 of about 5 people in the restaurant (the other table was already chomping away). After several minutes, our waiter comes out with ONE plate of fries, but no Belgian waffle. Where is my dear friend's Belgian waffle? WHOOPS, imbecile waiter forgot to mention they ran out. Gee, thanks for the head's up! So she ordered something else that of course did not satisfy her. Then I asked him where our other plate of fries were.

So I've been into Sparky's before and while their food is rather good (especially for late night eats), their employees are constantly bitter, mean, and rude.   Had almost THE worse delivery experience of my life and felt I had to share. I ordered food from their online delivery service provider (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FEat24Hours.com&amp;s=2028d5b871bb2bb04d504e0a494778222c70b1a581299d8397910e21ba0e8fb2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Eat24Hours.com</a>). They warned me it would take 60-90 minutes for delivery, which is long but I was willing to wait. The food arrived after about 80 minutes, and the delivery guy rang my doorbell 3 times within the 1 minute it took me to get the door. He handed me the food and walked away. I got inside, opened the bag, and much to dismay my Two Eggs any Style was without its advertised toast, and my salad was delivered with their not-good-tasting balsamic vinaigrette, despite my explicit request for Ranch.  I contacted Sparky's to tell them about the mistake. They put me on hold for 4 minutes, came back to say that their delivery guys were out and it'd be about 30 minutes until they could redeliver me my toast and salad dressing. They suggested 3 times that I just ask for a refund of the toast and salad dressing (for like $2 back). I told them I wanted the delivery and requested they deliver my missing ingredients before they went and delivered other people's food.   Fast forward 1 hour. I contact <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FEat24Hours.com&amp;s=2028d5b871bb2bb04d504e0a494778222c70b1a581299d8397910e21ba0e8fb2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Eat24Hours.com</a> requesting that they deal with Sparky. The representative informed me that Sparky had a shift change and \"lost\" my redelivery form. I then had to wait another 30 minutes for them to deliver me my salad dressing and toast.   Total delivery time: 3 hours !!! For a freaking salad and eggs meal. And of course when the toast arrived it was cold and soggy. I wish that I had ordered food from somewhere closer and more reliable.   I'd only suggest this place if it is late and NO WHERE ELSE IS OPEN!! That is the only time it seems worth the wait/crappy service.   I will say that <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FEat24Hours.com&amp;s=2028d5b871bb2bb04d504e0a494778222c70b1a581299d8397910e21ba0e8fb2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Eat24Hours.com</a> was extremely helpful through this irritating ordeal, and they even refunded me the cost for the salad (not Sparky's).

Upon seeing the line outside, my friend said there was no way we were waiting and that she knew another place close by. \"Close by\" proved to be quite the trek...I basically walked 5 ft behind her and whined \"are we there yeetttt?\" the whole way.   Even though it was super crowded in Sparky's, we were seated right away. I love when restaurants put the word \"vegan\" with the title of an entree...it makes my life a lot easier...especially when it's 3 AM and I'm drunk and vaguely know where I am. I ordered the vegan burger and fries, as did another one of my friends, and it was AMAZING. I'm sure it tasted 10x better because it was 3AM and I was drunk, but that wouldn't stop me from ordering it again while sober.  The walk back to the car was HELL.",

I was here between 3am-4am on January 17, 2014 for the first time in years and a good deal had changed and not all of it for the better.   Positives: Nice new laminate floors would give a clean appearance if the lights weren't down so low (might've been a kindness at this time of the morning?). Also, the kitchen, which can be seen but not walked though (thanks!) on the way to the restrooms, was notably and surprisingly the cleanest restaurant I saw on a weeklong stay in the Bay Area.   Negatives: The egg florentine was so laden with feta I could barely make it through and the hash browns...I have no idea what was going on with the hash browns.   It's a diner and given its location is one of the best people-watching experiences I've got on my list of SF diners and dives (and that's some steep competition).",

Maybe there's not enough time in the day to read the complaints. I ordered a Heartstopper burger last night for delivery because the picture looked good. I didn't know you could mess up on a burger so much. It was barely edible, but I was starving so I was eating it. After a few bites, I saw a hair under the burger. I have super long hair and the hair was brown and only about 6 inches, so definitely not my own. I gave them benefit of the doubt and hoped maybe it just floated in from somewhere in the kitchen and they hadn't noticed. Nonetheless, I decided I wouldn't eat any more of it, but decided to inspect further. It took me about 5 seconds to find another hair. It was the same color and length of the other one and when I pulled on it, half of it was cooked into the burger, so it most definitely from someone in the kitchen staff. THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED.

Back then the food was just average and there was this waiter with the worst attitude on the planet. \u00a0The food was always over priced and below average in taste. \u00a0It was a good night if you did not get \"that waiter with attitude\". \u00a0I lived nearby back then and even stopped going there back then.  Now the same ole' sh-t...Grade of an F for food taste. \u00a0Fettuccine Alfredo was something Hells Kitchen would have throw out and yelled at the chief about for hours but their not even in their caliber. \u00a0Honest to god; The Safeway brand Fettuccine Alfredo has better quality and taste. \u00a0I left most on the plate which was hard considering the plate and a coke was $14.05 .   The waiter was fine for 2/3 of the visit. \u00a0I had requested a split bill and got his acknowledgement but when it came it was one bill and he was not that busy. \u00a0 I waited for him to return to let him know but he never came back so I assumed we pay at the register. \u00a0I went there to request a split bill and the cashier called over our waiter instead of simply splitting the check. \u00a0The waiter was still was nice but asked how I wanted it split as if he had forgotten the request. \u00a0I told him I wanted it split like I has requested and he did so w/o asking who had what--at least he knew that. \u00a0With just an ever so slight attitude he put my new bill on the table for me to pay and left--no thank you etc. \u00a0  20 years later new staff though all the same nationality this time. \u00a0Likely family owned but again the same below average taste and a waiter with attitude. \u00a0How can that carry over from the previous owners and still be there 20 years later. Guess you cant beat a dead horse in this case.",

But we both agreed that the food tasted a little \"off.\" My macaroni and cheese tasted more like pepper than like cheese and the slice of ham was pretty thin for the price, but salty and hammy like normal. The pancakes were just \"meh\" and the \"maple syrup\" I thought tasted like wood shavings - maple-flavored wood shavings.  Service was okay, though the place was incredibly loud despite the fact that there were only two other tables of people there.

So my friends and I were hungry and didn't know what to eat around the Castro area since most of the surrounding places were closed and lo and behold, a place that's 24 hours and it looks like a charming diner with a charming name. Lies and deceit! Anyway we get inside and we sat in a booth in an area of the diner that was oddly dim. I was craving waffles at the time so I was ecstatic to find that they had belgian waffles on the menu. Yipee. But once I got to order all dreams were dashed when the server said that they didn't have any waffles at that time. What the fuck? I don't see this place selling out of waffles or running out of batter. The guy next to me can order his pancakes but I can't get my waffles?! At the time I was upset and settled for a mocha milkshake instead to drown my sorrows in. My friends had 2 orders of fries and a milkshake as well. They ordered the Chai milkshake. It was tasty. I'll give them that.  The fries took unusually long to cook. The people next to us who had come in maybe 15 minutes after us already got their EXTRA LARGE pizza delivered to their table. What gives? Our server is nowhere to be found and the one time he comes around we flag him down and ask where the orders of fries were. He looks dumbfounded and says they'll be right up. The place wasn't busy by any means so it shouldn't of been a problem to get us 2 orders of plain french fries. A couple minutes later he comes with a plate with a hefty portion of fries. Is this supposed to be our 2 orders of fries combined into one? Whatever, the server was out of sight until we were done with our meal and ready to give us the check. We look over it and an order of waffles was on the receipt. Where were these delicious waffles? I did not see them. I did not taste them. Were they magical waffles? Or phantom waffles? Apparently I had to pay for these elusive waffles. So we get the server to change up the check, paid for our shit, and got out of there. Needless to say if we were desperate for some food around the Castro in the middle of the night, we'll probably just hit up Orphan Andy's instead.",

I'm going with 2 stars in hopes that this was a rare occurrence rather than the rule, but just barely, since a more appropriate response to your patrons leaving disappointed would be something along the lines of \"sorry guys\" rather than \"peace out!\"",

After trying to tell her what a \"BLT' was, she said I'm sorry the music here is really loud. My response was well, that's not my fault, why don't you turn it down?... She replied with a snotty \" it's not my fault either, I don't set the music\". Nice.. really nice customer service and manners....   With all the food places in this city there is NO WAY I will give a dime to a shop that has such attitude, no manners, and hires a completely unprofessional moron who apparently thinks that keeping her job, making tips, and having an income in this time where NO ONE can even get a job.. is not worth saving or caring about.   I have ordered from Sparky's in the past.. but I will NEVER do it again. It's not rocket science to know that if your staff is so uneducated that they can't turn down \"music\" to hear and take your order.. your business is not appreciated either.  And so where is the owner? Who is the manager and owner of this place that consistantly get's one star here on yelp... ? Don't they care, don't they have any self worth or integrity? If I owned a place and it got one star reviews.. I'd be humiliated, ashamed, pissed..   I guess if the owner doesn't care it makes sense the staff doesn't either.   Go anywhere else..",

    "review_text": "Came here for one reason: it was 23:30 on a Sunday and nothing else was open. \u00a0I had just finished watching the thoroughly depressing 'There Will be Blood' (there wasn't much blood, but there was a lot of oil) and needed some sustenance. \u00a0Cafe Baghdad, which was close to the Castro theater that I had just exited claimed to be closed, contrary to their sign, so off we went in search of food, and hence Sparky's.  To me, a diner is a place with lots of plastic, linoleum, chromed metal, and kitchy music from before 1965. \u00a0The menu must consist of things that could probably make at home, mostly from cans and it must not be healthy. \u00a0The servers should be older women with names like 'Helen' and 'Edith' and 'Fran' and they must, when referring to you, call you something that would give you cavities (honey, sweetheart, honeypie, sugar, sweetpea, etc). \u00a0Finally, it cannot be hip...not intentionally at least, coincidental hipness is ok.  Sparky's has some of these things, there is a lot of plastic and such, all in bright colors. \u00a0The menu is largely made up of stuff you can make at home, mostly from cans, and the food comes out hot and bathed in gravy. \u00a0But there was a bit too much hipness, and not to discriminate against the quick, courteous and attentive waiter, but I don't he was called 'Helen.' \u00a0Plus, the food was hot but not super tasty. \u00a0And there was a definite effort to be hip...which kind of kills it for me.  So overall, it wasn't a bad place, but not an excellent place--solid three stars. \u00a0I think I'll have to go back to Atlanta where I went to school, where there are real diners. \u00a0I call those places 'Waffle House.'",

I am highly sorry for last night for when I arrived with an entourage that started fighting on the bench because they were two bitches. Getting kicked was sad and not nice since I was drunk and didn't get to eat a burger.  But moving on.  Being the quasi-SF drunk that I am, you are a legend. Nothing tastes better than a Sparky's burger late at night after a good dose of Ketel One. Your menu has expanded entirely, and I used to love that I would call you to deliver when I lived two blocks down. This was because I was again, being that quasi-SF drunk.  Your menu has grown bigger, but to me... I will just stick to what I know you can be good at. And that is your burger. However, I think it's still impressive that you are trying your hand at pastas and pizzas to breakfast. I've had some instances here where service is sketchy, and food is spotty... but I mean I can assume you are trying the best that you can. Because when most of your clientele, is inebriated, homeless or just generally weird folk - it can get hard.  I'm glad I can count on you, Sparky.
