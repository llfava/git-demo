Restaurants everywhere seemed crowded and had wait times, and Palmer's doesn't take reservations, but luckily they were able to take us right away when we arrived, so in we went.  And I am so glad we did! From the outside, Palmer's is nondescript and very easy to miss among all the other shops and restaurants. On the inside, it's classy, intimate, and even a little historic, with deer heads and lots of photo frames mounted all over wooden walls. There is also a bar area, which makes it more comfortable. I ordered the entree special, which was a shortrib served on pappardelle and vegetables (25), and the shortrib was super duper tender. Other people got the steak (35), gnocchi (20), trout (24), salmon (25), and lamb (27 and massive), and everyone really liked their food.  To top it off, the waitress overhead us talking about our friend's birthday, and surprised her at the end with ice cream and a candle!  Next time I'll try getting that curtained little table in the back corner. Scandalous.",

Finally got a chance to step inside last Saturday afternoon and what can I say, I was wowed!  So it's pretty fancy schmansy, perfect for a date night/couples, but since I came alone decided to have a seat at the bar. The bartender, Erin, was incredibly sweet/personable and made me feel like not such a loser for having come to the bar completely alone. She was super knowledgeable about the menu and was also a very pretty face to look at (hope that doesn't come off creepy).   Anyway, definitely planning on stopping by again soon (perhaps with a chica). In short: 1. Great vibe/atmosphere; lighting was good, lots of couples 2. Amazing and inviting staff 3. Food looked good (I just had a drink, it was fantasmic)",

    "review_text": "If my other half saw I gave three stars, he'd urge me to bring it down to two, but there were aspects of Palmer's that I really liked on our recent visit. \u00a0Spoiler alert: the food was not one of them.  SERVICE: very attentive; the food came out quickly, and we also didn't wait long for our drinks. \u00a0Because it's a new restaurant, we were given a survey at the end to help them gauge how well they were doing so far. \u00a0I really appreciated the fact that they were open to taking feedback and making Palmer's a long-term success.  DRINKS: The drink selection is great and not *too* outrageously priced. \u00a0I'd come back here for drinks if I want a bar option in Pac Heights that isn't Harry's.   FOOD: This is where I don't have a lot of positive things to say, and I was really surprised at the quality of the food given that I've always had great meals at Leopold's (owners' other restaurant). \u00a0The food just seemed a notch below everything else at Palmer's; my green beans looked/tasted like they were of the frozen variety, my fries were salted beyond repair, and the steak, while cooked to the correct temperature, didn't seem to be a high-quality cut of meat.  DECOR: I see other reviews think the antlers/animals on the walls are weird, but I think it gives off a cool, Italian-mob-in-a-bar kind of vibe. \u00a0I like it.  OTHER PATRONS: meh. \u00a0Someone who knew the owner sat next to us and were disgusted to (over)hear that we didn't love our food when we filled out our post-meal survey. \u00a0They then proceeded to insult us for a good five minutes, calling us \"ignorant young people\". \u00a0That wasn't a direct factor in the score since Palmers didn't choose to plant them next to us, but it certainly didn't help the overall experience.",

The food is mediocre. \u00a0I had the Wagyu Beef entree, which was bad. \u00a0I wasn't expecting fillet mignon for $23, but it was the toughest cut of meat I've ever had. \u00a0One of my friends tried a bite and couldnt even swallow it. \u00a0We sent it back. \u00a0Also had a burger, which was solid in and of itself, but kind of a let down at $13. \u00a0The bun was buttered. \u00a0The cheese was okay. \u00a0lettuce, peppers and pickles came on the side, but no tomato or onion. \u00a0IMO, highend bars, should focus on top quality beef, prepared simply, for burgers. \u00a0  Great bar with mediocre food that is over priced. \u00a0My overall sense is that Palmers is trying to be a little too fancy and that if they focused on doing a few simple dishes really well, it could be one of the best hangout spots in Lower Pac Heights.",

And you know, maybe that's true on some nights, but it wasn't the night my lady and I ended up at Palmer's after our own little Fillmore cocktail crawl.   And what a great place to end up. We sat at the bar, and enjoyed watching the bartender (a big, tattooed gent bedecked in a strong beard and a classic white barkeeper jacket), lovingly create each cocktail. He and the other keep were nice guys--friendly and talkative, but not so talkative as to be annoying.   I don't remember which cocktails we ordered, but they were served in the old-timey glasses. In general, I'd say Palmer's is paying homage to the 1920s Jazz-era Fillmore Street: a vintage feel with lots of solid wood and incandescent lighting. I like it a lot--it's speakeasy-ish without the pretense.  We also had some food: the burger and the side of brussel sprouts. Both were well-priced, largely portioned, and delicious. Particular shout out for the brussel sprouts, which were cooked in balsamic, and cost only four dollars, for as many veges as you normally be able to buy for $4. Impressive.   Great place, will return. Holding off on the fifth star for now, as we didn't have dinner proper there, but I expect they'll be able to get it.",

    "review_text": "The location is great and so was the ambiance with dim lighting (but not so dark that you can't read the menu, similar to most steak houses) and room for sitting and standing. Started with the curry fries which I don't regret at all. Crispy and coated in curry seasoning with some ketchup on the side. The gnocchi was excellent, slightly crisped but soft on the inside sitting on top of duck bolognese. I got full about halfway through but it tasted so good I forced myself to eat the rest. My husband ordered the salmon which was also cooked to perfection. If you're in the mood for something light but flavorful this is the dish for you. It came with some crunchy vegetables which was a great touch if you're able to include some in every bite.   Unfortunately the dessert was nothing like the entrees. We ordered two vanilla bean creme burlees for a table of 6 to share and we ended up sending both back. The entire thing (both of them) were freezing cold and gelatinous, the caramel on top tasted burnt and was crunchy only in the center and not on the sides. If you enjoy creme burlee I advise you not to try it at Palmer's - give something else a try.   Overall, I enjoyed 80% of my experience there. Service and dessert were not notable.",

Our waiter Eric was fantastic, our entire dinner went so smoothly even on a very busy night. After talking with him we learned that he used to wait tables at the Slanted Door, so I'm sure he's accustomed to high volume restaurants. The entire staff was just so wonderful, including the owner, Albert, who stopped by to greet us. We will certainly be going back!",

    "review_text": "The fifth star is for the best trout preparation ever (and I came from Trout Land before I came from the Cool Grey City of Love, and my trout-loving lover has even deeper exposure to the mountain-farmed fish), which is what got us into the restaurant in the first place.  Our experience actually started in my old neighborhood, on Polk just north of Union, where I wanted to try the replacement for an Italian place that I had liked there. \u00a0Leopold's is Austrian, with an impressive beer list, and a group of noisy techies playing mating games at the window table. \u00a0My companion's eyes lit upon a trout wrapped in pancetta; it is rare that she passes a trout dish on a restaurant menu. I had \u00a0the pappardelle, and we shared a beet and endive salad. \u00a0Had I done my Yelp duty then, I would have given Leopold's 5 stars. \u00a0Alas, I no longer can. \u00a0  So a few weeks later we were back in the City, and I asked, back to Leopold's whose menu I want to explore further, or (since we were in a pet-friendly motel near the west end of Lombard) take the 22 up and check out the lower-Pacific-Heights restaurants? \u00a0Long pause. \u00a0The trout sounded good. But, being born to be wild, we went out in search of Adventure, and headed for the best bus line in San Francisco.   The last place we looked at had the appearance of a youth-oriented meat market, but we are rather pretty for old people and I lack the shame gene, so we dared to approach the entry-way menu. \u00a0The first thing my eye saw? \u00a0Pancetta-wrapped trout. \u00a0In we went.  It is indeed an attractive, well-designed restaurant with a classic dark-wood look appropriate for the concept. \u00a0The animal heads, well, read on.  My partner's choice being already made, I dug into the menu. \u00a0Hey, look, roast-beet salad, the last one we had at Leopold's was awesome. \u00a0Wait a minute...pappardelle, with parsnips? \u00a0I mean, it was really good at Leopold's, but this is supposed to be a New American place, the other restaurant with the same interesting menu has Austrian heraldry \u00a0all over the walls, along with a truly impressive collection of ungulate heads.  So yes, Palmers is owned by a man who came to San Francisco 20 years ago from Salzburg, \u00a0opened in a primo Russian Hill location a few years ago, and now has a hot spot on Fillmore. \u00a0Congratulations.  I ended up with the lamb shank, which was just as good as everything else. \u00a0Then after Christmas we took my sisters and brother-in-law for a reunion dinner (all of us now from out of town), because my elder sister has as long and deep a love affair with the trout of our home mountains as does my companion. \u00a0So more samples were made of the trout (and I got my tastes in), and we got a wide exploration of appetizers (roast marrow! \u00a0Yum!) and main courses. \u00a0Every single dish was interesting and done well. \u00a0The food really is based on the somewhat rural tastes of \u00a0Mountain Austria. \u00a0I can only imagine what they would do with venison. \u00a0That means somewhat less gimcrackery around bizarre high-tech preparations of food ingredients. \u00a0At both Leopolds and Palmers, you can recognize what you are eating. \u00a0The kitchen celebrates the ingredients, which drives this reviewer to celebrate the kitchen.  This is one busy place, and new. \u00a0I see that Dr. I had a dinner from hell. \u00a0It may be that his server recognized a diner from hell. \u00a0I can say that the servers were very busy, but I thought handled the press (we were there at prime time on a Friday night) very well. \u00a0If Palmer's is not yet at the top of its game, (1) I did not see it, the place was ticking beautifully, and (2) it has only been open a few months, there may still be some glitches which will undoubtedly be identified and worked out. \u00a0If it continues on track it is a hit restaurant. \u00a0  So about the trout.  It is served apparently whole, wrapped in pancetta and pan-fried, with fixin's. Raised on trout that is pan-fried and served whole, with the diner carefully lifting the tail to leave one cooked filet behind then flipping the carcass and repeating (a process that removes most but never all of the skeleton), we approached the fish with care. \u00a0The pancette tied everything together: \u00a0our at-table filet technique would not work. \u00a0So we dove in with a sharp knife, and found:  No bones. \u00a0Flesh still moist, some of it due no doubt to the basting of the surrounding pancetta. \u00a0Still no bones. \u00a0That was at Leopold's. \u00a0What was it about the Palmer's prep that made it slightly better than what I had declared, 6 weeks earlier \"the best trout preparation ever\"? It is the reason I couldn't 5-star Leopold's. \u00a0I should have said \"best trout yet,\" then repeated that pronouncement \u00a0the next time we had the dish, and then again the time after that.  This is a not-uncommon preparation for trout in Salzburger Province, \u00a0enjoyed by a native of that beautiful mountainous region who has brought his skills, drive, and favorite dishes to a new home in California. \u00a0We are lucky to have him.",

    "review_text": "Thoughts for my experience: You are kidding me right? \u00a0  Before I say anything else and describe our (disgusting) experience I must state the good. \u00a0The Hostesses and our bartenders were outstanding, OUTSTANDING. \u00a0 Our amazing hostess saved us from who I am guessing is the owner (obnoxious German(?) guy with the filthy rag hanging out of his pants), She looked mortified about how he carried himself and profusely apologized for his actions which I will get into later. \u00a0Our bartenders made an impeccable old fashioned, my favorite. \u00a0The bar staff were knowledgeable, fast and skilled. \u00a0It truly is a good looking bar.  My coworker and I have been on a Gastropub kick lately and wanted to check out the new place on Fillmore. \u00a0Note: website is under construction and Facebook goes to a German Lingerie company (I will expand later). \u00a0So based on yelp I left my Amex card at home (Lame business practice; considering our corporate cards are all Amex) and we took a cab on up the hill. \u00a0From the outside the place looks great, but it got creepy the moment we hit the door. \u00a0We walked in planning on having a drink or two then dinner, per the norm. \u00a0The instant we enter I see this larger fellow charging straight for us wiping his hands on some filthy rag hanging out of his pants, before we can breathe he puts his hand on my coworkers shoulder (the one that was just wiped on the disgusting rag) and shouts in what we both guess is a German accent \"Table for two?\" Normally I would be happy for prompt service however, we did not have a chance to look or breathe before he tried to usher us off, and he almost knocked the hostess down while interrupting her. \u00a0Very rude. \u00a0  We steer for the bar after putting our name in for dinner. \u00a0The bar has a great selection of elixirs and the drinks are a reasonable price. \u00a0After a libation we smile at the hostess and she carts us off to a table. \u00a0I sit down and Thomas decides to go wash his hands (still grossed out about the rag), it is during this time that our waiter swings by the table and informs me he is not serving an incomplete party, before I can say a word. \u00a0When he is done filling me in on the rules I reply: \"That's nice my guest is in the restroom I know what he would like to ..\" and he walks off in the middle of my sentence. \u00a0Did we offend the service gods? \u00a0I worked in a restaurant in college so I doubt it. \u00a0Thomas returns and so does our waiter, \"Hi my name is Erick, I will be taking care of you tonight.\" \u00a0I had told Thomas about the incomplete party bit and we both chuckled, Erick, your authority trip must be a great ride. \u00a0Our drinks show up and they are outstanding, we order the chicken and the steak for dinner. \u00a0  I have lived in San Francisco since 2003 and I should tell you the city is known for great food and drink. \u00a0Palmers, your food is terrible for the level of restaurant you want to be. \u00a0If we were in some dive bar it would be fine, but when I want frozen food I will go to a dive bar. \u00a0The chicken was rubber dry and tasted like dirt, have your chef season his food. \u00a0The steak was a steak, tough and over cooked, I am guessing it was a lower quality beef then you have written on the menu. \u00a0The sides with the steak were offensive, both the fries and the greens must have come out of the frozen foods section at Safeway then microwaved to limp mediocrity. \u00a0Palmers perhaps use quality ingredients like the other taverns in town, something fresh perhaps. \u00a0When our waiter asked we mentioned that the chicken and the steak were tough and both overcooked, he informed us that the chef had studied in France and blah blah, not offering to correct the problem. \u00a0I stopped listening, and asked for the check. \u00a0I am guessing that Erick does not realize we can hear him when he is speaking next to the computer, because guess what, we did hear you. \u00a0Thanks for calling us assholes and mentioning that we know nothing about food. \u00a0I have not had an experience like this and I had to think on it for about a week or so before writing this review. \u00a0How are you employed is a puzzle I will never solve.  Of course The Chronicles food critic reviews the place the Sunday after we go and his review was spot on, if not a little generous. \u00a0The one thing we saw he might be wrong about, my coworker has been living in Sweden and noticed that the name of the restaurant, font and logo are the EXACT same as a German Lingerie company. \u00a0It is one of the top searches when you look up PALMERS on FB. \u00a0So the little story I read about a family friends place in Canada has to be nonsense. \u00a0This place is either owned by a German company that produces (Very Hot) ladies underwear or the owner has zero creativity and just copied everything down to the color of the lettering. \u00a0It is somewhat sad. \u00a0To see for yourself: \u00a0<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.palmers.at&amp;s=4ba20eec0fe8e629ac6186fd2ddd22c3c52178e15d70aac9293d06a4ac27aba5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">palmers.at</a>",

Order a beer, friends arrived. We got one seat at the bar and chatted. \u00a0Friends were hungry so they asked the bartender for a menu, well apparently you couldn't eat at the bar. \u00a0Was just odd...seems like there are to many rules here.

My experience is solely with the bartenders/drinks. \u00a0I can't comment on food. \u00a0My story begins with a perfectly reasonable cocktail, Diablo something, ordered from a friendly bartender at a reasonable $8.50. \u00a0I went back and wanted something a little stiffer. \u00a0This is where my tale begins. \u00a0  I asked for a double Makers on the the rocks. \u00a0The bartender types in a Makers into the POS. \u00a0Its $9. \u00a0I can SEE this with the EYES I have on my head. \u00a0He then clearly is puzzled as to how to put a double Makers into the system. \u00a0He heads off to my right to speak with what must have been the manager. \u00a0He comes back with my drink and my receipt. \u00a0\"$27 dollars.\" \u00a0Im rather surprised that a double makers cost $18 more than a single. \u00a0\"27 dollars?\", I say. \u00a0\"So you are telling me a single cost $14.50.\" \u00a0Looking me right in the eye - \"Yes.\" \u00a0  I don't argue with restaurants, I don't send food back, and I never complain to anyone. \u00a0 \u00a0I wasn't about to start here. \u00a0I sign the check, even give a tip. \u00a0The point here is instead of checking on something that seemed wrong, ie a $27 dollar drink, he looks me in the face and charges me that amount. \u00a0Screw you dude. \u00a0Check on that. \u00a0  I wish my story ends there. \u00a0However after drinking my cocktail I want just one more. \u00a0I head back to the bar and avoid eye contact with previous bartender. \u00a0I don't want to complain, I don't want him to comp anything, I just want to avoid the situation and get charged properly. \u00a0I also don't want to order a single Makers and seem like I am \"testing\" the price on him. \u00a0Just trying not to be a jerk here. \u00a0  To avoid any confusion and keep the price down, I order a \"whiskey on the rocks\". \u00a0When asked \"What kind of whiskey would you like,\" I respond \"whatever is fine\". \u00a0Mind you today is not my first rodeo - I have ordered drinks before. \u00a0Generally, when a patron does not specify the type of drink they would like, they want the cheapest you have because they are indifferent. \u00a0However, the bartender elected to serve me a $10 whiskey. \u00a0My bill was $10. \u00a0The brand was 4 shamrocks or something like that. \u00a0Again, possibly i should have specified that I would in fact not like your most expensive whiskey, but rather the cheapest. \u00a0So maybe its on me. But I don't think so.   Either way, this is my experience, and my tale. \u00a0Screw you bartenders at Palmers. \u00a0I wish the same fate as Long Bar upon your establishment.",

The drinks are also consistently good and thoughtfully made (the bartenders are white-coated mixologist extraordinaires!). They have a nice selection of European beers, as well (I believe the owner is the same Austrian gentleman who runs Leopold's on Polk St?).

We left discussing whether we were more disappointed with the food or the size of the bill. I have paid parking tickets that felt like a better use of my money than our dinner bill. Our bread order should have been a clear signal of where our meal was headed. For $4.75 we got 2 defrosted dinner roles with butter (in most cases I would not admit that I paid nearly $5 for bread, but because we had never seen bread cost so much on a menu we had to try it).  It is not worth getting in to a discussion of our entrees, but I will say I wish I had a camera to capture the look on my wife's face when she saw her plate of hen sausage meatballs.   On a somewhat positive note, aesthetically the restaurant looked great with the exception of the animal heads and marlin on the wall (very confusing decor given the theme in the restaurant).  To sum it up, Palmers needs to step their game up big time before everybody starts wanting their money back, which I do.",

My friends and I have been waiting for months (literally) to try Palmer's. \u00a0We live very close and were excited for a new neighborhood watering hole. \u00a0Excitement has now turned to extreme disappointment.   Here is my Palmer's story:  The first thing I notice is that we are the ONLY people under age 35 at this place. \u00a0So if you are looking to meet \"young\" individuals, this is not the right place. Upon walking in, I was forced to keep my sunglasses on due to sun rays blazing into the bar. \u00a0Apparently blinds were never discussed during the years of renovations. \u00a0  There was ONE table occupied and everyone else was standing in the bar area. After asking the hostess for a table, she rudely (this is a common theme) tells us that you must order food to sit down. \u00a0After little discussion, we decide to order an appetizer so that we can sit down at a table. \u00a0We inform the hostess that there will be four people total, although only 3 are present. \u00a0She, once again, rudely tells us that everyone must be present in order to be sat at a table--we quickly changed our magic number to three and figured our friend could squeeze in when she arrived. \u00a0I understand the not-seated-until-entire-party-is-here rule, but this is not Nick's Tacos on a Tuesday night--this is a brand new bar with one table occupied. \u00a0Give me a God-damn break! \u00a0On our way to the table in the back, I am beyond puzzled as to why this \"tavern\" is so un-accomodating \u00a0This hostess must have missed the training day about being polite to customers, in addition to lacking common manners. \u00a0  The menu was less-than impressive, but I was willing to try something in order to avoid getting sunburned inside. After sitting at the table for what seemed like 15 minutes without seeing a server, we decided to leave. \u00a0And never come back.",

I'd been drawn to Palmer's after walking by a handful of times and noticing the dark wood, leather booths, and warm lighting. The decor and atmosphere lived up to exactly what I had hoped for, but the drinks fell a little short. The cocktail list was reasonably priced by SF standards ($8.75 for all drinks on their menu), yet the list was a bit weak, lacking a good variety of drinks or anything very unique. I got the Pimm's cup which was fine, but just went for a gin and tonic after. The bar had a great variety of liquors though, so I think they have the potential to expand their list.

While service at the bar was slow, the cocktails ($8.75) that were finally served were well made. \u00a0Service in the dining room is disorganized at best and haphazard at worst. \u00a0There seems to have been no planning to the waitstaff's workflow, and there is a great deal of wasted effort, resulting in slow, inefficient service.  A surprising disappointment from Albert and Klaus Rainer of the wonderful Leopold's on Polk Street, Palmer's Tavern is trying hard, but failing miserably.",

Our server was really nice but didn't mention the specials, I just happen to over hear her \u00a0yell to the table next to us they had specials. \u00a0I was bummed because the Burrata starter sounded so much better than the salad I ordered. \u00a0Our wedge salad arrived shortly and it was truly terrible. Soaked with vinegar dressing and little to no blue cheese which is just weird. \u00a0My husband thought it was ok but I couldn't eat it so I ordered the Burrata which was just ok. We had the hamburger which was nicely prepared and the fries were good, but they never did bring us ketchup which would have been nice. \u00a0At the end of the day the food was just ok at best. \u00a0I will say this we were surprised at how reasonable the price of the bill was. \u00a0One of our less expensive dinners in the city to date. \u00a0In my opinion if you serve food in this city you better get it right and it better be great. Too much competition. I can't see myself going back for anything else other than an early afternoon quick drink with friends then move on to any number or restaurants in the neighborhood that offer amazing cuisine and allow you to actually hear what others have to say in your party.",

The re-done restaurant is beautiful inside and I really loved the music, not too loud but I couldn't hear the people next to me either.   The bartender made me one of the signature cocktails with whiskey. They had some other cool signature drinks I would try, like the Fillmore Fizz or something like that. Yum!   Our server Eric was knowledgeable about the menu and suggested a couple of his favorites, which the beau and I shared. We are big foodies so I was excited. We had the rolls, and the chilled corn soup to start. Fan-freakin-tastic. Then we shared a couple other appetizers, the quail and oysters.

Silverware would disappear and we would have to ask for more. The food was also not remarkable - the flatbread was the best part of the meal. The pappardelle with mushrooms was very gummy - which we felt must have meant that it was sitting for a while. The spinach side dish was very runny and had no flavor. The decor was very odd with the deer heads, and some decor reminiscent of the 30s or 40s but the menu didn't quite go and neither did some of the other decor on the walls.

Back when I lived in the city, my friends and I would frequent the Long Bar at least once a week. It was a convenient neighborhood watering hole that attracted a more mature clientele than Harry's Bar down the street. Best of all, it was stumbling distance from my apartment.  In any case, Long Bar never really found its footing. Fortunately, the owners of Palmer's seemed to have figured out a way to make this place work. By 5:30pm, the bar was hoppin'!  My friend and I ordered a few drinks from the happy hour menu. I had the Persephone (which was like a pomegranate version of a Cosmo). Although it was only $5, it really wasn't that well balanced of a drink. I kind of gave up on it after a few sips and then ordered a Fernet. Since we were kind of hungry, we split an order of the Spicy Meatballs with Gruyere Mashed Potatoes. For $5, this dish was quite a steal! Some of the other $5 happy hour bites looked delicious as well (especially the ribs with cole slaw).  The bartender was extremely friendly. And what she lacked in mixology skills, she certainly more than made up for with personality. Over all, I really enjoyed the vibe of the space. It's a lot less stuffy compared to the Long Bar days. Plus, they now have outdoor seating (which is perfect for September/October - SF's real summer!). While the Palmer's didn't exactly bowl me over, I think it's a nice addition to the Fillmore neighborhood. I'll certainly be back if I'm in the hood.",

Sometimes you'll chat with a nice bartender but I spoke with six employees, all of whom were friendly and accommodating! \u00a0(Three barmen, two servers and the hostess.) \u00a0I asked one of the servers about a cocktail ingredient, she wasn't really sure but then lo and behold, a sample showed up so we could taste it. \u00a0Later, a different employee offered another sample when perusing the gin options.  With poor service the San Francisco norm, it was lovely to feel taken care of and be surrounded by professionals who enjoy what they do. \u00a0  Kudos (and thanks) to the Palmer's crew! \u00a0I'm sold.",
