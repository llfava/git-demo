Mason Burger Brawl but was kind of disappointed in the food. The tator tots were not what I recall. Their burger looked pretty plain but something about the patty was pretty tasty, what killed it though... the bread - it was dry as hell.   Will I be back? I'd skip them next time at the Burger Brawl and would rather to go their bar to eat.",

I had an order of the crispy pork buns (good+) and the bacon wrapped tater tots (over-hyped and only okay), as well as my fair share of drinks. My main complaint is that well into the evening, there was a TON of people in the bar and only one bartender, so it took forever to get a drink after he noticed you at the huge bar. This wouldn't stop me from returning, but I hope they plan for better coverage when they have events like that.",

All the worst kind of douchey sausages that you could never want to meet. I truly hope that we had an off experience last night when we went to trivia because I feel sorry for the Boardroom staff if that is what their normal patrons are like. I'll probably only go back if I feel like it's a good night to get constantly harassed.  BUT the bar. The most important part of the review. The people working there are great. Nice people. But there were no waiters, so be prepared to go to the bar to order. The food, for the most part, was good bar food. Bacon wrapped tater tots: Delicious (though few in quantity. Not shareable, in my humble, bacon-loving opinion). Tacos: Yum Yum. Nachos: Great. Mac 'n Cheese: Not great. Just avoid it. They lured me with the promise of cheese and bacon and I felt duped! It was more watery than cheesy and even the bacon couldn't save the dish!  $5 margaritas were okay, but not strong at all. I had four and felt fine. I should have been buzzin' hard though; I am quite the lightweight. But they have $2 Tecates on Tuesday, which is a sweet deal, so you should definitely go for that.  The reason we went to The Boardroom, however, was to participate in Trivia Tuesday, which was disappointing, in my opinion. It started about a half hour late, which, in fairness, was due to the A's vs. Royals game going into extra innings, but it just got going too late for a work night, if you ask me. I couldn't hear the woman reading the questions. When she spoke at a good volume, she was kinda mumbling (drink much, lady?). And there were HUGE time gaps between rounds. I heard that it is usually better organized than that, but it was frustrating for me and my gal pals.  My general experience there probably warrants less than 4 stars, but I truly believe it was an off night based on what I've heard from others, the yumminess of the greasy food, and the quality of the service. Worth a shot, just beware of male patrons: they just may be nacho-stealing tards.",

Their buffalo chicken tenders hit the spot for our second round, but the most impressive we're the nachos and the BACON WRAPPED TATER TOTS!  The crowd was excellent, a mix of all ages appropriate for a bar. There were pats, Vikings, skins, Seahawks, and of course 9'ers fans. Everyone had actress time cheering for their respective teams in this highly inclusive environment.   My only gripe is in regards to the pitcher of mimosas. The bottom line is that idea needs to be reworked in a way that is tastier. (Most likely a bit more OJ is in order)",

On the one hand, it's in North Beach, a place I love, the staff is incredibly kind, they play great music, and have lots of big TVs for ample sports viewing.   On the other hand, it smells like my college boyfriend's shared dorm apartment, ie, dirty towels and bong water, trivia night was a huge bust as the hostess was absolutley schwaaasted (like blurting out answers to trivia questions and heckling some guys in the crowd), the place is very tiny and dark, and last but not least (and at no fault of the establishment) we were infultrated by the *biggest douchebags* I have encountered in a while - seriously, they ate the better part our nachos and bacon mac n' cheese and got really angry when we told them to stop and moved our food away.  Me and the girlies started off the day yesterday in high spirits, looking forward to Dr Teeth's Tuesday Trivia / Two-for-One Maragarita deal / Two Dolla Taco fest, only to have our dreams squashed roadside after we learned that *Dr Teeth NO LONGER DOES TRIVIA* (fyi, y'all). So we had to resort to other options. Boardroom is somewhere between all of our offices, so we landed there.   Rita I and I got there waaaay before the trivia rush and planted ourselves at one of the two long tables and filled ourselves with a Margarita and a Corona ($5 each) and waited for our homegirls to grace us with their presence. I had the Fernet and Tecate deal for $6 which was pretty sweet.  Now kiddies, I welcome you to flashforward a few hours to almost trivia time. We were joined by some random menfolk from Canada who made a good impression - at first. Then they proceeded to take and eat our food and tried to justify it. Um, I hate you. Thankfully the staff saw what was happening and took the charge off our bill and put it onto theirs. The chef in the kitchen does major work - cooking and bringing everything out to the many people who order, good work!  We shared Nachos with Carne Asada ($9) which was pretty bomb, plus an order of Mac N' Cheese with Bacon ($8) which was no bueno. It was basically large elbow pasta with a watery cheese sauce and topped with nearly burned bacon bits. Sad face central. Stephanie S got the Bacon Wrapped Tater Tots aka Bac-o-Tots ($8 for five) which she said were yummy, but not a lot came in an order. Rita I had the Buffalo Wings in Island Flavor ($9), which were not particularly meaty, but had good flavor. During trivia we got all fat kid and ordered Tot-chos ($8) and they were OK, a combo of soggy and then dried out, I could probably live without them.  Anywho, I'd like to go back and try brunch. I think last night was also slightly tainted because there was a Wild Card A's v. Royals game on that went to the 12th inning, and there were way too many A's fans clogging up the joint. So that's that: I hope to be back, I hope no more awful men approach me and my friends, and I hope the staff continues to rock on.",

She claimed that the bartender was cool with this. While we were outside talking, a man who claimed to be the owner happened to be walking into the bar at the same time. He stated that we could not have our drinks outside, to which we gladly obliged and brought our beverages inside. At this point the owner seemed very upset with the bartender for letting this happen. Once inside, my girlfriend went back outside to have a smoke and did not have any drinks with her. She had been outside for about 20 min and since the area is a little dark and shady, I decided to peek my head out the front door to check on her. Let me clarify, I did not set foot outside of the door I only looked outside to make sure my girlfriend was OK. At this point, the bartender very rudely asked me to give him my drink. I believe he was trying to make up for his prior mistake of letting us take the drinks outside and to look good in front of the owner. Once again, I did not put up a fight and gave him my drink and the bartender never mentioned that I was cut off or could not have another drink. About 5 minutes later, my buddy had an extra drink, which he gave to me. When the bartender saw me with another drink he proceeded to officially kick me and my whole group of friends out of the bar. My other friends asked why they were being kicked out as well and the owner claimed \"Because you are with him and I have to backup my bartender\". My friends were from outside of the area and I felt we were being treated unjustly and unfairly because we were seen as outsiders. Message to the bartender: own up to your mistakes and don't try and make up for it by being overly strict to customers, that is not a fair way to treat your business.  tl;dr: I had a terrible experience at this bar. Even though our entire group was being respectful, and under control we were told to leave. Mind you, the bartender had already received his payment for our $80 tab, which included food and drinks, when he decided to kick us out. Which I'm sure had something to do with the ease in which he kicked us out.",

Drinks = $5 for Jameson and Ginger Ale. Cheapish shot and beer specials. Beers on tap are great (love the various IPA's).  Food = The world's best (as claimed) bacon wrapped tater tots. Pretty good. Not the thickest cut of quality bacon, but wrapped in tots with a nice mayo/ketchup mix sauce is great.! ~$9 for a small plate, bit pricey but tasty.  The burgers are big and tasty, friends shared.  I got a taco salad for $9 in a cool pho bowl and the salad and beef (you can get chicken too) were great. The taco wrap on the outside was obviously from a wrapper, but hey, can't expect a bar to fry it like a Mexican restaurant.  Big fan. I'll be back for food and drink.",

They have several TVs and they even put on the Sacramento Kings for me (which no one else cared about). If you haven't been, swing by on a Monday for 50 cent wings. They have about 20 flavors and the guy cooking them takes real pride in his wings. Bars like this are becoming rare in SF so support them when you can.",

    "review_text": "A couple reasons why this place is great:   1) I took a girl here once and she HATED it. That's now I knew it was good. So I kicked that bitch to the curb.   2) The bartender is a cool ass dude. This is weird that I have to even say this because I feel like one of the prerequisites of being a bartender should be \"don't be a dick\", but we all know how that usually goes.   3) I like mimosas.   4) The brunch was awesome as hell. I haven't had anything bad from the brunch menu. You also got to have respect for a place where the guy cooking your food, brings it to you. So you know he wouldn't dare bring you something shitty because he has to look you in the eye.   5) I got to piss off everyone with my musical selections on the \"juke box\"",

    "review_text": "Came here with the BF and his sister when I got a hankering for some burgers- this place came up and was nearby, so off we went. Was told upfront that it was a bar that serves food rather than a burger place, specifically. Good thing too, because when we arrived there was only bar seating and we hesitated at first, thinking maybe we would not be able to eat here.  Luckily, we stayed- probably because the game was on and we didn't want to waste time finding a new spot, but the fact that wings were on special really helped, too. \u00a0Fifty cent wings on Mondays, 5pm-10pm.  We ordered a round of beers (had the hawaiian one on draft- can't remember the name, but it was light and sweet, refreshing) and a ton of food: a burger and the brisket dip to share, with sides of bac-o-tots and onion rings, plus (what amounted to) 25 wings in spicy bbq, hot, and spicy island. More on those in a minute.  Burger was just okay, dip sandwich was dry and tough and we did not finish it- very unusual for us. Bac o tots were awesome, but seemed overrated based on other reviews we read here. Onion rings were okay.  The WINGS are where it's at though- specifically the SPICY ISLAND. I could bathe myself in that sauce. It was phenomenal- I was expecting something with pineapple that's overly sweet and not usually my thing, but this one.. dude, I can't even figure out what was in it! A fresh green herb/spice was present, possibly basil? Or maybe thai basil? Overall the taste to me was more thai than island, but whatever the hell you want to call it, we ordered extras of it, and even then I was dipping my pieces in the extra sauce puddled at the bottom of our basket.  Service was good- bartender/server clearly enjoys his job and was making conversation with most at the bar. Made good food/drink recommendations. Space itself is divey, and that's okay- all the TVs were working and the food was good, so that's all that matters.  Definitely want to add that the unisex bathroom was surprisingly VERY clean, which I almost didn't expect based on the looks of this place- but the appearance is deceiving. Most dive bars have mediocre foods and questionable cleanliness- and you'll find the exact opposite here: phenomenal island wings and tidy space, from the bathroom to the bartop.",

    "review_text": "Time: 9:07pm/59\u00b0F clear  Purpose: Needed to find a nearby bar to catch the last half of the warriors/cavaliers game without being notice alot. Didn't feel like walking around saying hi to everyone like a town mayor as I know most of the businesses nearby, just didn't feel like talking much.  Ambiance: Small neighborhood joint were the owners knows everyone by their names. Even if you don't know much about the place you will when you leave. Not much going on here it's all about locals stopping by for a drink or so. Since it's small place when there's Giant's or 49er's you will have to use a megaphone to reach someone across the room. 4-5 flatscreen spread through the place nice wooden bar counter with smooth contour groove sit about 12+ at bar if you counter the ends too. A dartboard lot's of pennants and posters articles of local teams some trophys but couldn't get close enough to read the plaque.   Staff: Guy at counter was nice greeted me how you doing? I sat down he said I've seen you around before and I answer I bet you have. We started talking about the upcoming 2014 season for the Giant's.  Cleanliness: It's a bar/restaurant type so I can't say it was clean or not as some areas maybe opposite of what a business should be, let's say I will eat here again.  Eats/Drinks: Order wings $9 and thinking about the bacon wrap tots. Not a fan of fried food but once in a while, yes. Not really sure as I was watching only second half of the game. So bartender walks off and brought me 5pcs on the house. Thank you! Quite delicious. Wash it down with speakeasy $6 including tips.  Products: Mostly finger foods that are easily made in matter of minutes, deep frying. Wings,tots,bacon wrap tots,nachos,sweet pototo fries,hummus, chips/dips,onion rings etc.  Punch Lines: Neighborhood bar,chinatown,little Italy,SFPD Central Station,parking garages,funeral home,Washington square park,fisherman wharf,cafes,italian restaurants,muni buses,post office,banks,delis,trinket shops,coit tower (closed for remodeling),Russian hill,Fairmont hotel,Mark Hopkins hotel.  Tradeoffs: A nearby friendly environment for the locals to meet up or socialized.  Final Thoughts: Don't get me wrong it's a cool place it's just the menu options and noise level is unbearable. I understand it's a sports bar too. Guy yaps on his phone probably to no one because he was to drunk to recognized there's no one on the other side. Those ghost calls can really mess you up pair with drinking. The kind that you think it's vibrating picks up phone no call inbound so you yap about your day to no one. I will come back again with my Giant's/49er's jerseys depending on sports season.",
