    "review_text": "Came here for a light dinner after the Fillmore Jazz Festival last weekend. I have to say I really enjoyed the visit. First off, I made a reservation through yelp. Easy, simple, and I got the time I wanted. We even arrived a half an hour early and they seated us without a wait!  I like the feel of this place. Lots of dark wood and splashes of green. Definitely felt Zen-influenced.  We ordered a few items: the hawaiian poke salad, a california roll, a yellowtail dish, and a boiled egg cooked inside of a fried pumpkin bread. All of it was delicious. I really liked how spicy the poke salad was. I'm not a general fan of seafood, but I really enjoyed the salad. The California roll was also really delicious; no imitation crab here! The yellowtail was alright; once again, this is just my palate not being so favorable to seafood. My favorite though was the egg in fried pumpkin bread. I could eat that over and over again!  We also got a couple of drinks: a blood orange chuhai and a green tea chuhai. Strong and flavorful.  Only complaint was that our waitress wasn't around all that often; it was hard to flag her down.  I'd definitely come back though!",

I really enjoyed the octopus balls and thought the ramen was great since it wasn't too salty (and had lots of vegetables!) but I wasn't blown away by any of the flavors. We tried both the chicken and the pork skewers and could barely taste a difference between the two dishes. \u00a0The wakame salad was tasty, but I wish there was more of it... the clump of seaweed looked a little lonely in the middle of the big bowl on top of a couple of thin tomato slices.   I'd request the Tatami area next time- and do a little research on the food before hand.",

    "review_text": "Very rarely will you find a Japanese restaurant that does everything right.  Izakaya Hashibiro Kou is a total game-changer.  They've successfully transformed a traditional Izakaya into a modern, hip, and fun dining experience by offering Japanese-style tapas infused with Asian influences in a cozy lounge-like atmosphere.  Their extensive menu ranges from yakitori to fresh-cut sashimi to ramen to grilled and fried items.  In my opinion, it's the best way to eat.  Because duh, you get to share everything- which means you get bites of everything. It's a win-win.  And lemme tell yah, their drink menu is just as impressive: Sapporo on tap, wine, cocktails and freshly-squeezed juices. They also have an extensive sake list to please all audiences.  So.  If you're looking for a fun night out with a group of friends OR just a high- energy date night atmosphere, then this is your place.  + KOU Sashimi ($18)- You get a total of 9 pieces of fresh cut sashimi; salmon, hawaiian big eye tuna, and yellowtail (no substitution). Overall, I was very impressed with the quality of their fish (being that it's not a true sushi restaurant).  + Gindara Misozuke ($11)- \u00a0Miso marinated black cod.  This is one of my favorite things here. You get a buttery piece of seared black cod that melts with each bite you take. It's the only dish where I secretly wish I wasn't sharing with everyone (sshhhhh).  + Tofu Temptation ($7)- The soft tofu arrives beautifully presented with three variations: topped with Korean style mentaiko, uni, and oshinko. This is a great appetizer to get your taste buds flowing for the next couple of dishes.  + The seafood ramen is just ridiculous. Like, I can't believe how much I love this bowl of ramen.  It has just the right amount of spiciness (jalape\u00f1o) so that it doesn't take away the taste of the broth. The noodles were cooked to perfection. And you get a good variety of seafood options (shrimp, mussels, octopus, etc).  Get it, and you wont be sorry.  + Uni ($10)- sea urchin from Santa Barbara  They give you hugeeee chunks of uni where it's practically falling over the sides. The uni was pretty good for an Izakaya restaurant (b/c I definitely didn't expect this type of quality here).  + Hotate Yaki ($10)- scallops with garlic and asparagus. The scallops were fresh and so buttery. Overall the flavors worked really well together.  + Buta Toro ($7)- Pork belly garnished with scallions and red onion. The pork belly arrives sitting in a slightly sweet miso sauce. While it was good, the pork was a tiny bit dry. I wish it had more of a \"melt in your mouth\" type of texture. (yah know?)  + Kalbi Tempura ($10)- Korean style boneless short ribs with vegetables mixed in a sesame ponzu sauce.  This is the only dish that I wouldn't order again. It was weird, because the short ribs were fried and really dry.  They should have just left the shorts ribs alone.  + California Roll ($6)- made with fresh crab meat  Yah I know... I'm ordering sushi ROLLS (and I don't even like rolls). But hey, I was craving carbs &amp; they use fresh crab meat here. None of that fake shit.  It was bomb.  To sum it all up...   This place is literally perfect for a fun night out. Social drinking is a big part of the Izakaya experience, so ask your server for some sake recommendations (or beer- whatever floats your bloat!).  Since the menu is so extensive, it has a little bit of everything to satisfy anyone's cravings or taste buds.  The two \"MUST GET'S\" are the miso black cod &amp; seafood ramen.  PS: Make your ressies in advance. If you come with a large group, get the private rooms!

For drinks, the signature Kou is delightfully not too sweet and mixes unique cocktail flavors such as shiso leaf, sochu, umeboshi cherry and soda water. The miso-glazed black cod is a big winner here, as well as the tempura squid with arugula. I was particularly impressed with their red tuna sushi, as it's quality, texture and taste was steps above what you would find in most J-Town joints. Most of all, the staff are super nice and motivated and the ambiance is perfect with seating Japanese booths (please take your shoes off) and normal tables.",

I called on Thursday in hopes that they would have a private room available that would fit our party of 16 - no luck. James did, however, offer me the communal dining area of their restaurant. Basically glass walls surrounding the tables with some gaps here and there for ins and outs. $30 minimum per person, which is super affordable. Not bad considering how last minute I was and my only other choice was Sakesan - where the food is definitely not on par.  I was in my office this morning just spending hours looking through their yelp photos and browsing their menu options to see what to pre-order. It's easier to order ahead when it's a group of indecisive people who will probably take an hour to decide what to order! I called James at 4pm - they weren't even open yet and he answered the phone! I went down the list I had created and he punched in the whole order for me. We came to a $650 total for food and tax which isn't bad at all. They automatically charge 18% gratuity for big parties. He also said he'd have everything set and ready to be cooked so once I arrive there wouldn't be any waiting around for food.  OK, I over-ordered. I thought the guys would be these starving tarzan-like cavemen scarfing down the food before it even touched the table. Boy, was I wrong...we had about 6 boxes of leftovers. Bill came out to be around $800 with gratuity - about $60 a person. SO WORTH IT!  What stood out the most to me was the hamachi carpaccio, the baby octopus! the braised pork belly, the miso cod, and the chicken thigh skewers. Definitely worth trying!  Overall, it was a great dinner and I'm thrilled with the service. I mean, JAMES! Give this guy a raise! or a medal.",

    "review_text": "The food here was very good. It was probably 4-star+ quality food, however I'm docking it a star for service. When I arrived, the restaurant was very empty. The hostess asked if we had a reservation and when we said no she asked if we would mind sitting at the bar. I didn't really understand since the restaurant was empty so I requested a table. She seemed annoyed and took me to a table in a corner of the restaurant, right next to the kitchen. It was not a great place to be seated and impacted my experience at the restaurant. Furthermore, it was hard to get the attention of the waiters - with whom I had no issues - because our table was so out of their eye's view. When I left the restaurant was still half empty.   On the subject of food, I got the California roll (the crab inside was exceptionally delicious), the seaweed salad and the scallops with asparagus in butter sauce (this dish was also absolutely delightful). All these dishes were 5-star quality. The only dish I have any contention with was the salmon sashimi (more like 2.5 stars). It didn't seem as fresh as the other food. I should also mention they have happy hour drinks. I got a draft beer for $3!   Overall, I would recommend this place for the food. The menu is creative and most of what I tried was great. That said, the service could be improved.",

    "review_text": "tl;dr  Really overpriced subpar food. Great ambience, but unless you are literally rolling in dough you can do a lot better in a city like San Francisco.  ----  I very rarely give 2 stars for an establishment. To me, 2 stars means that not only was the food seriously lacking in some aspect, I also feel emotionally cheated by the restaurant (usually by price). Expensive and bad = Izakaya Kou.  Given that over 70% of my reviews are of Japanese places and I jump at the first opportunity to try any new Japanese places (especially those in the $$ and $$$ range), I had high expectations for Izakaya Kou - it had four stars on Yelp, and it was very close to my gf's new apartment on Divisadero - I had high hopes of making Izakaya Kou a regular haunt the way I've enjoyed Izakaya Sozai through the years.  The restaurant itself is quite nice - it's spacious and divided into private rooms and communal dining rooms. At 10 PM on a Friday night, the ambience is more accurately described as calm and subdued, not like the boisterous smoky izakaya ambience that is usually much more common. This is probably a major plus for businessmen looking for a quieter place to talk or for couples seeking a good date spot.   I never give stars based on service, but it was good enough - seating was quick and service was attentive throughout the meal.  Here were the dishes we got:  Buta toro ($7) - the pork belly that so many people have talked about was unfortunately a flop. To be very honest, this dish can be easily made at home. How hard is it to reheat a few pieces of previously-grilled pork belly and squeeze miso sauce+sprinkle some random scallions and onion on top of it? To add insult to the injury, the dish is not even warm when it came out. Come on - you can do better!!  Kabocha croquette ($8) - now this is actually a great dish - 4/5. The kabocha wrapped in fried breading is terrific, and the egg in the middle is delish :) Really tasty and super good value, especially compared to the buta toro that just came out. Very creative dish - a side note is that they probably can hold the sauce/mayo that comes with the croquette - feels like they're a bit too trigger happy with it :)  Sashimi Salad ($13) - this was a joke. Please refer to my picture - you call 3 small mounds of chopped up fish, a cluster of arugula, 5 blueberries (you can count them), and a random dallop of onion a $13 value? Please. Go to any Japanese place and see how a real sashimi salad is done. This is probably the most disappointing of the bunch.  Sake onigiri ($6) - meh. okay. dry rice. very small rice balls. 3/5. not terrible, but not great.  Volcano roll ($14) - since they ran out of their kou ramen, I opted to get a roll instead. It's pretty well done, but as well as any fancy roll in a Japanese place. Is it worth $14? I'm not so sure. Maybe the random slivers of onion they seem to toss on every dish of the restaurant is some organic heirloom onion or something. That was a joke. Ha ha.  When it's all said and done, $61 post-tax and tip. Left hungry. Will certainly not be back.   Honestly, with a drink list as long as the food menu combined with the nice ambience, this place is probably much more suited for businessmen to drink after hours. I would certainly not come back for the food. (but with them charging $17 for a small bottle of Kikusui, I'm not sure whether that's a good reason to come back either...)  In a word, disappointed, and I have no idea what the hype is about. But looks like they're making good money with all these group dinners that appear to be happening in the other reviews.",

Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and although the service was horrible, the food was stellar all around.  we had.  uni onsen- amazing! assorted nigiri- sushi rice not bad, and fish was very fresh ikura, tamago don- highlight, small but amazing textures, and what can I say we love fish roe! Kurobota pork skewers- very juicy and flavorful.  I think the first time we went they were trying to get their act together and the servers were working with an unfamiliar POS system- we had multiple folks coming to our table asking us about our orders, delivering food that wasnt ours, missing food, repeating ourselves, one other couple even walked out cus they were seated for over 15 minutes with no hello of any sort. They had so many staff there who seemed all confused at that time...it was sort of funny watching them in action   HOWEVER! I went back with a large party last night and the service has gotten much, much better, (we were in tatami area)   in addition to the above, we also got   squid mouth- o so delicious!! kaki fry- fried oysters very good sashimi platter- very good beef tataki- good miso clams very good both types of ramen- i forgot names but both were great okonomiyaki- good takoyaki- just like osaka! spicy tuna roll-good + a bunch of sake!  overall a vast improvement in service although they really should keep to one person and ONE busser serving each table vs random pl coming to and from to help your party.  Its very confusing when other servers deliver your food then you attempt to reorder something but they say they cannot only to leave to try to retrieve the server who is helping you out.....  overall a must hit for izakaya I heart!",

We sat at the communal table, next to a \"painting\" on the wall that looks like it was the side of a tree, with branches, mushrooms, and bark popping out. Combined with the wooden tables, the dishware (stone bowls), and the dim lighting, the place feels very much like a forest, which goes well with the \"elemental\" vibe of the cuisine.  We ordered the fish roe don (fish roe over rice served in a stone bowl), which was small, but really, really good. The top of the rice was filled with several patches of different kinds of color roes, and the heat made it stick to the rice in a very pleasant way. We also got the chicken thigh skewers, which was ok. The Kalbi Tempura was on the \"chef's recommended\" list, and was pretty good as well--nice chunks of juicy beef covered by crispy tempura shells, topped with some really well-marinated leaves.

The interior design is really tasteful - raw wood and beautiful fixtures. They have separate, private rooms for larger parties and seating at the sushi bar.  The wooden table that my guest and I sat at was very small and cramped, I couldn't cross my legs, and we both felt uncomfortable during the entire meal. The first 5 or so wooden tables that seat two people sit in front of the door, so we kept getting chilled.   Our chuhai cocktails were watery and flavorless.  The yellowtail and tuna sushi were fine, nicely sized portions.   The bacon-wrapped asparagus and bacon-wrapped mushroom yakitori were good. However, there was a pretty long wait between our veggie yakitori and our meat yakitori. The chicken was bland (really didn't taste like anything), and the meatballs were dense and just ok.  This was early on a Friday night, and the place wasn't too busy. The wait staff seemed to hover over us, and it feeling cramped and uncomfortable as it was, didn't add to the experience.   The thing that bothered me the most was actually the crappy pop radio they were playing over the speakers. It surprised me considering the place presents itself as upscale (from the website) but it definitely has more of a casual vibe (so be prepared to hear Miley Cyrus during dinner).

If you do want alcohol there were ginjo and daiginjo 720ml sake bottles in the ~$50 price range, which comes out to about 16 \"shots\" -very helpful and friendly staff  Will definitely come back again. I've read in a review somewhere that they have a \"buy one bottle of sake, get another for $1\" deal during HH, but didn't confirm if it was still ongoing",

I had seen the restaurant in passing a few different times but never had to the opportunity to try it out.  Overall I was relatively satisfied with my meal. We tried an arrangement of different small plates. All small plates + sashimi had really good freshness and flavor. I also appreciated the pace at which the plates came out. Sometimes restaurants don't stagger the dishes well but I thought the service did a good job with that.  The dish with the *best* flavor was the miso marinated black cod (although the portion was much smaller than I expected). The *only* dish I would not recommend is the Hamachi Carpaccio. It was beautiful but bland. A bit anti-climatic.",

First - the kabocha croquette - will redefine the whole notion of a croquette.  Second - the interior - is really quite spectacular, and the place deserves a visit just because of the ambiance/decor.  Third Drinks - Izekaya - being a drinking oriented food genre - \u00a0specialty cocktails are on the lighter side, and all the obligatory beers and a selection of sake is available. However they did not have Asahi black upon my visit and thats a fail - especially so close to japan town.  Was here for an event and got to try almost the entire menu which was a great experience, everything was delicious and fun was had by all. \u00a0If you're considering the venue for an event - I can recommend it as it's laid out in a very interesting way that forces people to congregate in small groups and socialize.",

    "review_text": "My friends and I came to Izakaya Kou on a whim when we were just chilling in Jtown. We wanted to try something other than the same places we had been frequenting since high school. So I yelped up sushi places, and Izakaya Kou was one of the few highly-rated, reasonably priced sushi joints nearby.  The restaurant itself looks fairly trendy, with wood paneling all over the place, and glass doors separating different sections. There were also sections where you could sit on cushions on the floor, and then closed off by sliding doors. So that was interesting, and I kind of wanted to sit there. \u00a0It was kind of loud inside the restaurant, but not overwhelmingly so. I could still hold a conversation with my friends. \u00a0Service was a little bit slow, but attentive whenever the servers came by.  Describing this place as sushi would be inaccurate. This place mostly does small plates, although some bigger rice bowls are available. While I would say that this place is a little pricey (forever living on a poor college student budget), the food was fresh and tasty.  I got the chirashi don, which had about 12 pieces of fish (salmon, tuna, shrimp, and a white fish), all of which were quite delicious and had a great texture. It also had 2 pieces of sweet egg, which were equally as good. I enjoyed the whole dish, but I can say that I wasn't completely full from just the chirashi.  Luckily we got other things as well: takoyaki, karage, and kalbi tempura. I thought the takoyaki was well done, crispy on the outside, but not too crispy where you couldn't reach the inside. The kalbi tempura was really tasty and tender, but the serving size was REEEAAALLLY small. The karage was average. My friend also got a unagi don, and that piece of eel was HUMONGOUS. And delicious.  We were here during happy hour too, so we got a couple of Sapporos for $3 each. Which is a good price for those I think. And the appetizers (takoyaki, karage) were $5 each. So happy hour is not too shabby :)  Overall, I would definitely come here again, but probably during happy hour.",

I thought this was awesome and absolutely perfect for the occasion. I also loved the decor throughout the restaurant.

No, they are not even lukewarm. They are cold.. I'm not quite sure why they are called hot sakes. As for food, I tried the Yaki Udon and the Frisco roll. Both were delicious and the presentation was amazing. I liked that the udon had a lot of seafood and vegetables in it and the roll was fresh and flavorful.  The only issue we had was with the service. To put it simply, it was not good. Our waitress would only check up on us when we pressed the button to call her and she was really bad at answering our questions. Maybe she was new..?

Not amazing, but not bad by means. $5 for nigiri was pretty middle of the road.   My favorite was the tonkatsu scallops. Crunchy on the outside and light and delicious on the inside. They came out piping hot from the kitchen and were accompanied by a great dipping sauce. If you're a scallop fan, get these. Really good value for the $8.   Interesting beer and sake list.

They were extremely accommodating of our 8 month old son, gave us a fairly secluded corner table (it helped that we went early and were the first ones there) and best of all they commented how cute he was but no one tried to touch him (total pet peeve when waiters touch his face since he is a preemie)! \u00a0   Food highlights for me were definitely the Hotate (scallop) Gratin and the sake nigiri. \u00a0I would go back for these two things alone. \u00a0I'm not exaggerating when I say the sake nigiri was some of the best I've ever had. \u00a0Generous slices of fish that just melted in your mouth - yum. \u00a0And the scallops were so freaking delicious that I literally licked the shells. \u00a0Yes, it was that good. \u00a0My only gripe is that there were only three per order! \u00a0That was my own fault though, I really should have gotten two orders.  The hubby's favorite was the clam miso soup, TONS of clams and the broth was light and flavorful at the same time. \u00a0  I can't say enough about how great the service was. \u00a0The waiter thought we had ordered sashimi instead of nigiri and due to the mixup they gave us an extra order of each nigiri for free! \u00a0They didn't have to do that, especially since the food came out so quickly so we really didn't have to wait long for the correct order to come out AND they gave us the 10% first week discount too. \u00a0Dishes were cleared quickly and the servers were always asking to check how everything was and if we needed anything else. \u00a0  I'm officially a big fan of this place and hope they do well so I can come back for the scallops for years and years to come! \u00a0(But not so well that I won't be able to get a table if I go at 5:30 lol).",

They are an izakaya, afterall, but seems to serve at least one of every type of Japanese dish including ramen (seems de riguer in the US, but you will not typically find ramen at izakaya in Japan), sushi (sashimi or raw fish yes, but not sushi), kushi yaki, koroke, wow, just every thing was on that menu! We tried sashimi (fish seemed like it was frozen then thawed), sansai ika (a bit dry), yakitori (too sweet!). Sunomono was good. Gyoza seemed a bit sweet and mushy. Nice selection of sake, but the brands are relatively easy to find elsewhere in J Town. Draft beer is Sapporo. Service was fine. Efficient and courteous. Interiors seemed to follow the usual SF trend of exposed wood. Nice to have private 'tatami' areas. Maybe this place is good for non-Japanese who could use a basic introduction to 'real' Japanese food, but if you know good Japanese food, then you might be a tad disappointed.",

    "review_text": "After months of anticipation for their advertised \"Coming March 2013\", I'd given up hope that I'd ever be able to try their food. \u00a0But, after seeing signs of life in July and August, hope picked up again.  You can see the amount of work that had been put into this place since Nan closed, and I think it looks great inside. \u00a0They have the Japanese-style seating on one side (with at least one table kind of a cool hybrid), and regular tables in the middle. \u00a0And the menu has a number of dishes that look really good and a nice sake selection. \u00a0So, I was really looking forward to tasting the food.  But, the actual execution fell short. \u00a0It all *looks* good. \u00a0Like, with the fancy flourishes with the sauce - you know - when they add the sauce on parts of the plate, but not actually on the food. \u00a0But, here's the thing: unless the sauce is just garnish, that fancy flourish just makes it harder to eat.  Some dishes were approached \"alright\" (with the tofu temptation making it into the \"good\" category), but mostly, it felt like they came up with the dish, then moved on to the next without \u00a0taking the time to perfect it. \u00a0And, since they cover just about every section of Japanese cuisine, seems almost inevitable. \u00a0The ramen was the huge disappointment. \u00a0The Kou ramen was reminiscent of Tampopo's Kyushu ramen, which you could have gotten away with everyone and their brother opened a ramen shop in SF. \u00a0But, if you want to be taken seriously, you should really take the time to do it right, and, if it's not working, don't put it on the menu. \u00a0(Or, maybe have it on the specials board to experiment.)  Note for the servers: When you are bringing a plate of \"oyster mushrooms\", if you leave out one of those two words, leave out \"oysters\", not \"mushrooms\".  My advice would be to cut the menu in half, and try and focus on a few dishes that they know they can do well.",

But the hostess recognized we were stuck in back and we got a table immediately. Lifesaver. We were back near the bar between the tatami rooms and counter service, giving a good view of most of the restaurant Lots of wood, dimly lite. Very well appointed in a more modern way. Got:  -kaboCha Croquette boiled cage-free egg inside of pumpkin puffs   -Chicken Tsukune  chicken meatball  -kurobuta  black pork  -hamachi kama yellowtail collar  -hawaiian poke salad  hawaiian big eye tuna mixed w/sea veggies and seasonal vegetables in spicy sauce  -okonomiyaki japanese style pancake with bacon  Everything was fairly tasty. Portions are actually bigger than I thought they'd be. Staff are attentive and the food came out fast. We were out in under an hour. Definitely a place of consideration if you're trying to hit a show across the street with little time. Just make sure you dont get stuck behind 12 people!",

    "review_text": "I went to Izakaya Kou last night for a Yelp Elite event (so my review may differ slightly from a non-special event meal). I must say, Izakaya Kou really played to their strengths. Normally, I don't crave izakaya. Between the various styles and dishes of Japanese cuisine, I lean towards ramen joints. However, this was a fabulous experience and meal!  Among the food sampled was the Uni Onsen Tamago. It is basically uni with a soft-boiled cage-free egg and their special Kou sauce sitting pretty in a martini glass. Very delicate flavors. I loved the thinly sliced red onions on top. Though I'm not crazy about uni, it was nevertheless refreshing. The dengaku miso was one of my favorites of the evening. It is grilled eggplant with a miso sauce. The kalbi tempura was also excellent and I wish I could've had more!   With fellow Yelpers, we shared: Okonomi Yaki ($12), Kou Ramen ($11), Kuo Sashimi ($18), Hamachi Kama ($12), Yaki Udon ($11), Salmon Skin Katsu ($7), Nagasaki Ramen ($14), and 2 green tea cheesecakes ($7 each). Among that list, it was agreed that the grilled hamachi was a \"must try.\" The okonomi yaki was also on point. I mean, how could you lose with a pancake loaded with bacon?!! The salmon skin katsu was a crowd-pleaser. The salmon was fried to perfection -- didn't turn out dry from the battered outer layer. The Nagasaki ramen was the better between the two ramens we ordered. The broth was delicious and the slight spiciness thanks to the jalape\u00f1o provided a nice kick! Now... dessert should always complete a meal and the green tea cheese cake really did! Subtle and rich at the same time -- is that possible?! It was accompanied with -- brace yourself... LAVENDER HONEY ICE CREAM FROM BI-RITE CREAMERY (my favorite flavor from Bi-Rite!). I thought it was vanilla upon seeing it, and once I put it in my mouth (keep it G-rated folks), I pretty much made the loudest \"food-gasm\" sound. The green tea cheesecake and the ice cream in one bite was euphoric.   In terms of cocktails, we tried the Samurai, Ginger Cooler, Love Hotel, and the Kou. I loved the Ginger Cooler most because it was refreshing and the combination of ginger, ginger-ale, sake, and lime was an apt beverage for the meal. A close runner-up was the Samurai.   The service was fantastic. Though it was for a private event and there were multiple servers taking care of the whole restaurant, our server Diane was so sweet, attentive, and very thorough in her descriptions of the dishes. I believe she said she mainly works Tuesdays and Wednesdays \u00a0(?), so if you get her, you'll be in good hands.   The interior... the only way I can describe it is... rustic Japanese meets modern American -- if that makes sense. There are Tatani rooms where shoes must be off in traditional Japanese settings, and there are communal dining tables as well. There is a lot of wood action happening at Izakaya Kou. The lighting is a soft yellow dim and its corner location allows for reasonable people-watching views.  Overall, I plan to return. I remember seeing this being constructed every time I'd walk along Fillmore and last night was a fantastic reason to try this spot. I would return in a minute with friends and loved ones. The food and the setting allow for a convivial feel. Also... if you want a cute date spot with sexy sharing food and a fun vibe, this is your place San Francisco. Bow-chicka-wow-wow. I highly recommend this spot. It'll exceed your expectations!",

In my experience, Izakaya is usually in a small compact environment, with traditional Japanese feeling. Not anything like that here, it's classy, it has high ceilings, very spacious, and it plays light classical music. Anyway, the dishes:  - Maguro Tartare: big eye tuna chopped sashimi (it seems this restaurant emphasizes \"big eye\" a lot as all tuna dishes on menu are big eye tuna) with raw egg. Mix it together and eat; interesting texture, and good as a first dish - Dengaku Miso (eggplant): a must to order whenever I go izakaya not only because I like eggplant, but apparently all Izakaya I have been to had some very different cooking method of this dish. In here, it got a quarter size of a Japanese fat eggplant, so big that you would think the middle of the eggplant will be not as good but NOT - the miso taste was strong, not too hard/soft, and the skin was soft as well - Hotate Yaki: another amazing dish but not because of the scallop, but because of the asparagus - it totally felt like a Chinese stir-fry asparagus scallop dish in local low cost hawkers store; but really, this dish was just phenomenal! - Buta Toro: this one is alright; wouldn't order it next time though - Kalbi Tempura: a dish that I would have never ordered but my friend did - and it turned out to be as amazing as the Hotate Yaki. I always thought Kalbi was only for Korean BBQ but I would have never imagined it can be made as tempura with wonderful taste!! Must try! - Frisco Roll - a regular sushi roll but the fish was fresh and I could instantly tell the chef paid a lot of effort to make it good - Momo skewers: chicken thigh yakitori, a bit overcooked, kind of hard - Mushroom Enoki skewers: not too bad, enoki mushroom smelled good - Ika Yaki (whole grilled squid): descent, nothing too special - Kabocha Croquette: we added this as additional order but we waited for a long time and it didn't came; asked the waiter and found that the chef overcooked the original one and had already started cooking a new one for us instead. I give one additional star just because of the persistence the chef has about his food  Other than that, the waitress service was a bit disappointing, very very small voice, could barely hear what she said; although I could tell she was doing her best and she had a nice attitude at least.  Definitely a coming back to this restaurant! Next time with a larger group though, those private rooms look really nice and cozy. One of my new favorite SF Izakayas!",

I enjoyed the hamachi carpaccio, however the beef tataki, gyoza, icy soba and kabocha croquette were underwhelming. The layer of pumpkin on the croquette was way too thick. The whole Japanese fusion didn't work for me. I'd almost like to see them stick with more traditional preparation done really well.",

Service: Food arrived FAST! \u00a0Staff is friendly, easy-going, and polite, and I was happy to be spared the usual inauthentic small talk bullshit. \u00a0They simply did their jobs well so I could comfortably focus on eating without having to socially exert myself. \u00a0I'm an introvert in a noisy overpopulated city, so I treasure any moment I can space-out freely with minimal intrusion. \u00a0Food orgasms are best experienced sans interruption mid-chew.  Ambience: Despite being full of people, this is an oasis of calm, which is a rare thing to find in San Francisco. \u00a0I can't remember the last time I wasn't bumping elbows with the table next to me, or not being forced to eavesdrop on loud strangers seated too close. \u00a0Introvert approved!  Verdict: A novel dining experience. \u00a0Stylish spot for friend gatherings, yet sophisticated enough to bring parents, co-workers, or a discerning date. \u00a0We waited 30 minutes on a sunday night but it gave us time to decide what to order, and the atmosphere is so lovely I really didn't mind hanging out for a bit in their waiting chairs. \u00a0Get a reservation if you don't want to wait.",

We were lucky enough to get seated and were able to order fairly quickly. I had the seafood ramen, which I'm no expert on, but it was delicious and the portion size was reasonable (not too big). My friend had an undon stir fry dish and really enjoyed that as well. Both dishes were flavorful and contained a nice variety of seafood.  This was an extremely busy day, but the wait staff was as attentive as could be expected, our water glasses were always full and they even split our check for us. We also really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. It felt tastefully minimalist and modern but the strategic placement of glass walls and partitions meant that it was not too loud or full of echoes.",

Walking in makes you feel like you are transformed into a different environment with the wooden tables, decor, and private rooms.  - The perfect place to have a intimate event by reserving one of their private rooms or just a casual dinner at the bar or one of their tables within the restaurant.  - Food is delicious during my first visit and thanks to a recent YEE that I attended again here, I had the opportunity to even try more of their fantastic dishes.  - Items that stood out: Kabocha Croquette (Deep fried pumpkin ball wrapped egg), Uni Onsen Tamago (soft poached egg with uni served in a martini glass), KuruMa rbi Zuke (raw prawn in soy sauce marinade w/ onigiri) - Best drink: The Samuri (Sake, Cucumber, Lemon, and Apple juice). Refreshing and thirst quenching.  - Service was attentive and the best I have had. I had the same server both times and she was on her A-game. Ready to swap out chopsticks that dropped, clear out any trash on the table, provide you with extra napkins, and on it when you need something.   Improvements - Very very minor detail that i noticed, but I can see it being cramped in the picnic like table inside the glass room to the right. It's a nice concept, but I'm not sure how patrons would maneuver around if someone were to need to go to to the bathroom and dishes were to be served. Other than this, I can't think of anything else.   Tip - I didn't have to make a reservation the first time I came, since they had plenty of tables free. Parking is a little hard. Other than street parking or an alternative mode of transportation, it's better parking in the neighborhoods if you go a little further out.",

The sea urchin was small but very tasty. Difficult to share. The scallop gratin was delicious too.   What really stood out to be honest though was the service. The waiter / maitre d' walked us through his favorite choices which we ended up ordering, and even steered us away from some dishes that he thought weren't as good as described.

The Dengaku Miso is also a winner because of its deep and complex flavors. This is definitely much more savory and what I would consider to be a comfort dish.   In addition to all of the wonderful flavors these dishes have to offer the chefs also do an amazing job with presentation. I was very impressed after both visits.

Ambiance #1: I love this word and I always want to check out a restaurant for it's vibe. Do I see myself going even just for a drink? Do I WANT to bring friends there? Is it worth recommending on YELP? For here? Absolutely.   It's easy to find and people are always standing at the greeting guests. Perhaps it's their new business procedure before they get super busy, but having a good first impression is always a bonus. The manager stood at the door with a server, and as you walk in, the server readily walks you to your table.   Ambiance #2: I love the openness of the restaurant. There are tables down the center of the restaurant, sushi bar to the right, and as usual, tatami styled private rooms to the left. Each room can be opened for bigger parties, otherwise become three rooms of eight. Dim lighting and beautiful artwork.   Service: I only have to say three words: friendly, knowledgeable, and quick. I love it when servers can tell me what's good (not just because they work there), their favorites, highly recommended items, and also recommend drinks (sake in this case). I dislike when I ask a question and an answer like \"they're all good\" comes out. It actually makes me question the food.   Food: Can I say WOW?!! Yes. Yes I can. Presentation, originality yet creative, and taste. I'm not a professional food critique, but their dishes are how I see them in Japan and how I remember dishes tasting in Japan. For eight people, \u00a0we have about 20 or so dishes and many of them were portioned for at least the number of people present. They were very generous. Photos have yet to be posted, but stay tune! You'll know what I mean after I post them.  There's much to be said, but sometimes tasting it is better than just reading a review. Try it if you haven't and definitely reserve for parties larger than four.",

Not sure that this fully qualifies as Izakaya in the strictest definitions, as there are some modern twists and fusion happening here (not a bad thing at all). Regardless, this hit some great notes with us and was one of the more enjoyable meals we've had out in a while...   We hit Izakaya hard and had too many things to list here, but some quick high points:   - Yakitori - Basically the whole section of the menu is worth getting. There were some stand \u00a0outs (Ebi, Kurobota Black Sausage, Shishito), but in general everything was as it should be (though the chicken and pork were a tad under seasoned for my taste).   - Sashimi - No complaints here; Tasted great and seemed to be high quality fish.   - Beer/wine - As it should be, inexpensive and plentiful. They aren't charging premiums here for alcohol ($25 bucks for a bottle of Cune, and $18 for a pitcher of Sapporo), which is great especially in SF.   - Service - Excellent service, friendly waitress, lots of great recommendations. Well done.  - Ambience - Warm, aesthetically pleasing, and really just a fun place to be.   I could go on and on. The point is, I wish I could have eaten more. With all the booze and food (three big rounds of dishes), we spent two hours of happiness there, and I think it came to $174 for 4 people. A bargain given what we've paid elsewhere for less food and less fun.   I will be going back to Izakaya Kou, and will maybe rent one of their Tatami rooms as they look like a lot of fun.   Kampai!",

The menu is diverse without being confusing and each dish is prepared thoughtfully and with care. I love, love, loved the maguro sashimi presentation and the pork belly was heaven. They have an amazing, sweet and savory eringi mushroom prepared teppanyaki style, as well.   Our server was gracious, attentive, and accommodating and was quick to offer suggestions that really helped make our dinner experience special. While the tatami rooms had a max time of 3 hours, the restaurant did not rush us or make us feel that we had a time limit.  We're looking forward to coming back for more on our next trip up to SF.",

Really haven't had yakitori this bad in awhile.   The \"chef specialty\" - hamachi carpaccio was not fresh. we did not finish it.   With that said, their sea urchin onsen egg was delightful. The Kabocha croquette was huge but delicious. Cheese corn was yummy though it was screaming for some carbs to soak up the garlic butter.. maybe a small japanese pizza would do the trick. Izakaya Kou should take notes from the Vancouver izakayas.   All in all, this izakaya has potential but may need to cut down on the extensive menu, scrap the yakitori category if it cannot be up to par and focus on just having the items that shine!   ** They do serve Dassai 50 in both sizes as well as Calpico.. which is always a plus!",

Short rib tempura: didn't know what to expect with this, but it was not bad. \u00a0Liked the greens to give it a change of texture and flavor. \u00a0  Takoyaki: another solid dish  Potato croquettes: nice and creamy...solid  Okonomiyaki: it was ok...maybe I don't get to eat okonomiyaki that much, but I felt like it was a bit undercooked. \u00a0Presentation was solid though.  Service was ok. \u00a0Food came out pretty fast, and I felt like it could have been paced a little better, considering how small our table was. \u00a0The restaurant wasn't busy (there was only 1 other table and a few people at the bar). \u00a0Our server, with some help, delivered all the food and that was it. \u00a0Attentiveness could have been a bit better. \u00a0  Anyhow, I will be back. \u00a0Hope the overall food experience will be better.",

The manager is excellent, and on a slower night, he is able to overcome the lackluster waitstaff, but on a busy night, he can't, and that's when the poor service really shows. On a Saturday night, no one came to our table -- and we didn't even receive water -- until the manager noticed and sent someone to our table 20 minutes later. The food is hit or miss. We tried both the seaweed and daikon salads, both of which said they included \"fresh vegetables from the farmer's market\" -- and they were the most disappointing salads we have ever had. Other than 3 slices of tomato under the seaweed and daikon, the description of \"fresh vegetables\" was totally false advertising. Many of the dishes LOOK great but don't taste as great. I asked for the beef tataki to be cooked a little more, as it was too raw for me, and the waitress didn't bother asking me how I would like it done. She grabbed my plate with a blank face and when she brought it back, it tasted exactly the same. One of the items we ordered never showed up, but it was still listed on our check. All of these lapses would have been more tolerable if the service had been friendly/attentive, and/or if the food had been so fantastic that everything else could be forgiven. But it wasn't. With the new club \"Origins\" next door, this restaurant will likely remain busy on weekends. If they seriously improve the service, this place has a lot of potential. I hope the owner and manager will read this and hire people who understand what good service entails.",

No complaints and was a good appetizer.   Kabocha Croquette - Another good one. Seems like this is the specialty of the restaurant and I enjoyed this one. Basically a fried pumpkin croquette with a soft boiled egg inside.   Seafood Nagasaki Ramen - It seems that the EC here is Korean and some influences show here. This noodle dish is closer to a non-spicy \"champoong\" than a Japanese ramen. Although tasty, I would have ordered something else if I knew this.  Other dishes I tried were Hamachi Carpaccio (three slices of hamachi with some mint olive oil and asparagus), Beef Tataki (didn't seem like the quality of beef was there. Wasn't sure what cut they used but it wasn't as good), Sake Onigiri (really dry and the flavor wasn't there), and perhaps a few others I don't remember.  The restaurant itself is somewhat trendy and nice. The chairs were just wood seats... I wish they were put some nice cushioning there as you notice it more as the nice goes on.   It was a small restaurant and there seemed to be about 3 servers at the time... Although the servers were very nice helpful, they were scarce and hard to get a hold of. Prices were standard but I'd prefer Tanto's or Dan's in the south bay. I guess I just expected more from a 4 star restaurant in sf.",

They opened the room divider so we can still talk and pass beer around. There is a minimum charge for the small tatami room for $200 with 3 hours use of space and the larger room minimum charge is $280. Very easy to make the minimum charge since the portion is small, we made 2 orders for each dishes and ordered about 26 dishes, plus 2 pitch of beer and 2 glasses of sake, the bill came out to be around $530. Our waitress is super sweet, she gave us suggestions of wut to get and also suggest wut not to order. some highlights:  Uni Onsen Tamago: soft boiled egg with uni (interesting taste) Kabocha croquette: biled egg inside of a pumpkin puff ( must order, soooo good!) Hamachi carpaccio Sashimi special: very fresh Okonomiyaki: japanese style pancake (delicious!) Tako Yaki All the rolls are good, my favor: Volcano - depp fried shrimp with tuna Kalbi Tempura: short rib with sesame ponzu  Dessert: green tea cheesecake with lavender ice cream (Ummm, heaven...)

We got there at 9:45 pm no reservations only two other couples waiting in front of us. The host was super nice and the 15 minute wait was just enough time to peruse the menu. The interior decor is very interesting, modern industrial meets old Asian wood. The location is terrific right on the corner of Geary and Fillmore. The parking gods saved me a parking spot on the street a block away.   Our table came up and we sat down. Our waitress was excellent and attentive. We had plenty of time to make our menu decisions. The first three items we wanted were not available because they ran out of Uni. The waitress offered to substitute ikura salmon roe in the tofu temptation in stead of Uni. Hummmmm..... If several menu items are dependent on Uni as a ingredient and run out then on a Friday night at 9:45 pm \u00a0and you are open till midnight \"The Kitchen Screwed Up!\" The restaurant is within yelling distance of the Japan Town Center. I am sure that with all the Japanese Markets and other Japanese establishments within a couple of thousand feet than at 5 pm before they opened last night some one would have procured some more Uni. No excuse for running out half way through your dinner service.   Advise get hooked up with a Uni distributor like Maru Hide out of Gardena, CA and get enough for your dinner service.   The menu printed \"no substitutions\" then why are you substituting menu ingredients?  Since having Yelp and bookmarking certain restaurants I have kept the underwhelming meals because of the food to a minimum.   The Kuruma Ebi Zuke $12 was raw shrimp marinated in some sort of terriyaki mirin with some chili powder sprinkled on it. The shrimp was dark brown and limp it tasted as bad as it was visually unappealing. Terrible!  Hotate Gratin (3) $9 was less then a mouth full for the whole plate.  Asari Sakamushi $10 clam and sake soup came out luke warm.  The three items that were good were The frosty cold Kirin draft beer, the Buta Toto, and the Sea Bass Sashimi.  The front of the house has its act together, the back of the house ( kitchen) is a mess.   Overall underwhelming !!!",

We'd actually have been inclined to doing this but what a rude way to introduce 4 new potential guests? We sat in the horrible location while other tables all remained empty.

Nice sweet finish and grilling was done right. Takoyaki: I am a fan of this dish. This was OK as I have had much better versions. Ebi Roll: OK nothing special. I would say 3.5 stars as we got try a good variety of food and left fulfilled.",

The decor was nice, not over fancy, but comfortable and modern. We ordered a few things to start. They were really not impressive.   What did we get? - Tofu temptation: not impressive, but overall pretty decent. They ran out of uni, so replaced it with ikura (fish roe). I felt that the tofu taste was overpowering the seafood. The sauce was ok. This is the better dish that we tasted.  - Kabocha croquette: This looked very interesting, and tasted interesting. It's basically a croquette with an egg inside. It's creative, unfortunately, the flavor of the egg and the croquette don't really go together. - Hamachi Carpaccio(??? I actually don't remember which this was): very bad. Huge piece of fish, but no flavor. On the bottom was whole green onions, blanched. It was very strange. Sauce was strange too.  - Wakame salad: Exactly the same kind that you can find at Costco. I was expecting the branch looking seaweed!  After this first round, we decided there's no need to have a second round. We ended up going to a ramen place for the rest of our dinner. I will not be back again. I don't understand why they have a 4-star on Yelp!!!!",

Kyokoku Mori (deep fried asparagus tuna roll with garlic chips on top w/ponzu sauce and spicy sauce) - a NO GO **important to understand this is not a tempura roll, the asparagus and tuna had no battering components, it also didn't actually seem deep fried in general. I would have skipped this. 3. Sashimi - I really enjoyed my salmon sashimi, my friend seemed only partially happy with her yellowtail and monkfish 4. Spicy Tuna Roll tuna and cucumber - not worth ordering 5. Agedashi Tofu - very good! 6. Tsukemono (pickled selection of 4 veggies) - so so, nothing to get excited about",

After recently reading Cherylynn N.'s review and seeing her photos, I suggested to my friend coming here for dinner. \u00a0The vibe and d\u00e9cor of the restaurant were terrific (warm, wood centric feel plus rooms for tatami-style dining), but it was the extensive menu that really caught my eye. \u00a0Just so many tantalizing things to get!  -- SASHIMI SALAD - Assorted Sashimi and Seasonal Vegetables with Ponzu...$13 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-kou-san-francisco?select=lAxWxr3uYtN7vNrf4xXXrw#H0E0zALpcLxkdoo0hgUQhA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/izak\u2026</a>) The salad was fine, but this dish was more about the sashimi for me. \u00a0I liked how they gave us a decent amount, but I wish they hadn't cubed the pieces so small. \u00a0The taste and freshness seemed okay, but it was hard to say for sure.  -- UNI ONSEN TAMAGO - Soft Boiled Egg with Uni in KOU Sauce...$8 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-kou-san-francisco?select=lAxWxr3uYtN7vNrf4xXXrw#-nTxXAQRVnpNwCkeng0mUQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/izak\u2026</a>) I might have missed this one had I not been looking for it after reading Cherylynn N.'s review. \u00a0The \"KOU Sauce\" was essentially just ponzu, but it went well with the runny yolk and the briny uni flavor. \u00a0Big fan of this one, though it's not for everyone.  -- BACON ENOKI - Enoki Mushrooms Wrapped with Bacon...$5 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-kou-san-francisco?select=lAxWxr3uYtN7vNrf4xXXrw#1C-w9xvus09ef6h8xRKyKg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/izak\u2026</a>) I couldn't not try one of my favorite skewers! \u00a0Each piece was evenly cooked and the bacon they used had some quality to it (read: not super fatty nor skimpy in size). \u00a0Not a spectacular dish, but solid.  -- BUTA TORO - Pork Belly Garnished with Scallions Drizzled With Miso Sauce...$7 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-kou-san-francisco?select=lAxWxr3uYtN7vNrf4xXXrw#5c-EORgte9EllGkGsbqeGg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/izak\u2026</a>) Aside from the slightly excessive amount of scallions/green onions, I thought it was great. \u00a0The pork wasn't too fatty and there was a ton of savory flavors to it.  -- SABA TATAKI - Lightly Seared Mackarel Slices with Daikon and Ponzu...$11 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-kou-san-francisco?select=lAxWxr3uYtN7vNrf4xXXrw#ltQAZr34I-1a2yoUePjLtg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/izak\u2026</a>) Unlike with the pork belly, the scallions were great here - a fresh element to cut through the fishiness of the mackarel. \u00a0As much as I liked that tart, \"seafoody\" flavor though, I definitely wouldn't recommend ordering this on a hot date...  -- TAKOYAKI - Fried Octopus Balls, Scallions, and Bonito Flakes...$7 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-kou-san-francisco?select=lAxWxr3uYtN7vNrf4xXXrw#CeCxizto-Ks8uGqr366ufg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/izak\u2026</a>) Not as good as the ones I had in Japan, but one of the better ones I've had here. \u00a0Each piece had a good amount of octopus and it wasn't over dressed/soggy.  -- SPICY TUNA ROLL - Tuna and Cucumber in Special Spicy Sauce...$6 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-kou-san-francisco?select=lAxWxr3uYtN7vNrf4xXXrw#qLPAHUKu34uu6P_Zca8sZA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/izak\u2026</a>) I'm rather indifferent to Spicy Tuna Rolls, but my friend loves it and threw in an order. \u00a0The spciness wasn't as harsh as others I've had (which is good), but I thought the tuna could have been a little more flavorful (not so good).  Much like the food, I thought the service was solid - our server was helpful with his suggestions and refilled our cups often. \u00a0However, I do have a knock with the restaurant's awkward layout. \u00a0To get to and from our table (right wall, by the front windows), we had to weave our way through the room with the semi-communial tables. \u00a0Not an issue when those seats were empty, another story when they're not.  Still, despite that flaw with their set-up (it's not exactly a fatal flaw), nothing about our experience would discourage me from coming back. \u00a0And even though prices are a shade high, the taste is there. \u00a0Between the dishes I'd want again and the things I still want to try (particularly their ramen), I have plenty of reasons to come back!",

Their sake collection is quite wide, with 3-5 brands for each type of Sake - nigori, junmai, ginjo, honjozo, and even shochu, which I thought was pretty neat. \u00a0 We got the Sayuri ($11), which was very sweet, refreshing, and made the couple next to us think that we were gay because it's bright pink. \u00a0Later on, we got the Tozai Typhoon ($9), which was a soft, dry sake, but my palate was not trained enough to say much more. \u00a0I didn't like it as much. \u00a0  As for food, it's an izakaya, which is kind of the japanese equivalent of a tapas place, so we ordered lots of small dishes to share. \u00a0We got:  Tori Karaage (fried chicken): well seasoned, but the fry coating was less textured than one usually expects. \u00a0Still delivered hot and tasty though, so no complaints. 4/5. Kabocha Croquette: BIG fried pumpkin puff with an egg inside. \u00a0Nice presentation, but overall a somewhat boring dish where neither the pumpkin nor egg flavors could come through, even eaten without sauce. \u00a03/5. Buta Kakuni (braised pork belly): generously portioned, melt-in,your mouth pork belly. \u00a0Really tasty (if you're cool with pork belly, anyway). \u00a05/5. 'Frisco Roll: Spicy tuna topped with salmon, avo, and una sauce. \u00a0Above average roll that wasn't overpowered by the sauce; salmon/avo topping was well prepped and shined, enhancing the dish. \u00a0Tasty. \u00a04.5/5. Enoki mushrooms: wrapped in bacon, seasoned and charred, and finally served on skewers, this was definitely the strangest dish of the night. \u00a0While the char was appreciated, the enoki mushrooms were still a little too hard to chew through, especially when bundled together. \u00a0Not what I was expecting, but still pretty good. \u00a03/5. \u00a0  We also ordered Ikura, Saba, and Uni nigiri, which were of surprisingly good quality for the price ($5-$8 for two). \u00a0Ikura was full and juicy, the saba was chewy and fresh, and even though I've never had uni before, Kou's was very milky and delicately briny, so I'm pretty sure my friend just ruined the uni experience at at lesser sushi places. \u00a0Loved every bite.  Charge came out to around $100 including tip, which was not bad considering the city, for the ambiance, the quality, and the amount of food we ate. \u00a0I do wish that their non-booth eating area was larger so that they could seat us faster, and I also wish they had okonomiyaki, which is what I craved all along :(. \u00a0Still, I had a good time. \u00a0Definitely recommend for a business casual meeting or a date.  ps they take reservations, which I would recommend.  ---  sweet: delicious, not overpowered-by-sauce sushi. \u00a0pork belly was fantastic. bitter: definitely some \"miss\" dishes comparatively, wait can be long.",

When we first arrived, the host took a few minutes before he even looked up at us because he was concentrating so hard on something he was working on at the cash register. We get seated and the setting is just so awkward to me as we have to walk through the kitchen to get to the area behind the private tables. The menu prices weren't terrible, but the items that came out were not as substantial as the pictures my friend posted from what I believe was their soft opening. Sadly the portions to our sashimi salad were a lot smaller and the beef tataki wasn't even rare. We ended our meal after choosing our 3rd item which was the chicken meatball skewers. I think that was our favorite item out of the three!   But what makes me go back to my first comment is what i saw overall. The couple next to us were very unhappy since the wife's food came out and she was done w/ her meal before the husband even got any of his food. While they were quite loud about the situation, it just goes to show that they need to step their game up a bit.  With so many other places around, I'm not sure if i'll be back yet.

TWICE. \u00a0Both times we went.  The last visit was made worse by the attitude of the hostess, very slow service (no food on the table until 40 minutes in, no water until it had been requested THREE times). \u00a0The food is fine, but there are plenty of equally good options in the city with good or great service. Today, despite our dispute with the hostess that a reservation does NOT mean a seat at the bar--- I got an email from Open Table that we were never registered by the hostess as having kept our resy. Glad there are other great izakayas that want our business in town.",

Each had some nice presentation but the flavor in all of them just seemed a bit off. And by a \"bit off,\" I mean \"not tasting good.\"   The staff seemed new and are still learning the ropes and that's fine because it's a new joint. That sort of stuff can and should be worked out.   The decor is interesting. It's nice but I feel like it's a bit much - like they're trying too hard to be this super upscale joint when the food and service doesn't match that. Of course, if this had the type of food you find at Izakaya Sozai, I'm sure I would have thought the ambiance really worked well with the food.   A positive is that the food is priced appropriately and serving sizes are relatively large.  TL;DR: I didn't like the food but there's a small chance it could get better as they work out the kinks.",

They also only have a booster seat for my son but we didn't use it because it did not have a belt attachment. We paid $40 per person at the end of it all.

    "review_text": "Guilt by association.   Admittedly, I was very skeptical about going to Izakaya Hashibiro Kou because I read that their sister restaurant was nearby YakiniQ, an \"AYCE\" Korean bbq joint that limits you to one kalbi order per a person and charges you for lettuce. WTF. Anyways, not going to even get into that. I'll just leave it at that I'm not a fan of that place so I expected the worst with this new izakaya joint. Like when Cocobang decided to open Izakaya Ninja which was an utter fail. I digress.  We initially had dinner reservations at St. Vincent in the Mission which Michael Bauer had revisited and was keen on. Well, I trust Bauer as much as I trust my uncle Charlie at a seedy strip club with butt floss twerking in his face so when I heard about this new opening, I cancelled our reservations and took a leap of faith with Izakaya Kou. Pleasantly surprised was an understatement. Izakaya Kou offers some solid Japanese-Korean fusion izakaya with equally good service to match. I hope they keep it up.   While not an authentic izakaya, Izakaya Kou fits in the area as can cater to the crowds at the nearby music venues (Yoshi's and The Fillmore) and/or walk-ins not wanting to wait hours to get into State Bird Provisions across the street.   As with most izakaya restaurants, the menu is very extensive. Izakaya Kou has small dishes, salads, sashimi, grilled dishes, yakitori, teppan, fried dishes, soups, noodles, and rice bowls. They also have a couple of jive ass rolls and nigiri but that's like ordering fish at a steakhouse so it may be best to stick with their other items.   ~ * ~F O O D~ * ~ Izakaya dishes are meant to be small so the rule of thumb is 3-4 dishes per a person and then finish with a bowl of ramen (we opted out). Expect to spend about $50-60 a person; more if you're a lush.   *Kou Sashimi Combo: Maguro, Sake &amp; Hamachi (9 pieces - $18): \u00a0<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1dss1pD&amp;s=0348a481037fe52b42e63233b7a7651d2707a723e9e00b65e2f4969bbc7a7d8c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1dss1pD</a> *Uni Onsen Tamago: Sea Urchin w/ Hot Spring Egg ($7): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1gDvZeI&amp;s=ca9bc22739aae44000965b0b2dc667ca1cecd02de5eedef31c51505ddc779f21\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1gDvZeI</a> *Gindara Misozuke: Miso Black Cod ($11): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1gDvRw3&amp;s=74331dbc086ff3d35c7ea1f809b246572aae399c2e6a59a5183a363e4136e5e7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1gDvRw3</a> *Buto Toro: Grilled Pork Belly ($7): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1eUIjMa&amp;s=8c5f40713291f8bdded08728752cc19677547aaaa872c5e213af1c5e498a7dbe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1eUIjMa</a> *Momo: Chicken Thigh ($5): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1gDvMIw&amp;s=f17a81532d0ce19081afddf874cf9f8d25fc6c2f2614993cab71aa1fbca078af\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1gDvMIw</a> *Kalbi Tempura ($10): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F19hrKD0&amp;s=5bc7845d3244726b1af8cd1a60519c0d586456ef96e0d4c1e79ed8f5747a66b8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/19hrKD0</a> *Kabocha Croquette: Japanese Pumpkin Wrapped Egg ($7): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F17Mg63Q&amp;s=d016411387f7a7ff2edef5d8a3c235a3e6c721ffe9464bed73d8cca45f3c8962\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/17Mg63Q</a>  The sashimi combo was surprisingly excellent; thick buttery slices of deliciousness that trump many sushi restaurants that I've been to. Even better than the beloved Gochi and Tanto (izakaya) in the South Bay. If you like Koo's spoonful of happiness (the uni &amp; quail egg one) then you will like the uni onsen tamago which had a delectable oozing egg yolk, creamily briny uni, and a ponzu type sauce. Black cod done right, this fish was incredibly buttery and flaky with tons of umami flavor. My only gripe is I wish there was more. The buto toro had a nice lean meat to fat ratio with a delightful savory sweetness and a nice crunch from the red onions and scallions. I didn't try the momo but Mr. NSS said the grilled chicken thighs were tender and well-seasoned.   Two dishes that needed improvement were the kalbi tempura and kobacha croquette. While the kalbi was very tender and robust in flavor, the pale tempura batter was soggy. Perhaps lightening the batter with some soda water and frying it a slightly higher temperature would help? The sweet kabocha with the soft boiled egg was nice combo especially with the crunchy exterior but it was sitting atop some apple-like sauce which made the dish way too sweet. It needed some heat to balance out the sweetness.   ~ * ~S E R V I C E~ * ~ Considering it was the second day of their soft opening, the staff was fantastic. Everyone was very welcoming and gracious. Staff was attentive and tried to help us out with the menu and recommendations as much as they could. The owner passed by several times to make sure everything was ok and offered 10% off during their soft opening stage which is what every new restaurant should do (but they don't).   ~ * ~A M B I A N C E / D E C O R~ * ~ Previously the short-lived Nan California Korean Cuisine, Izakaya Kou's designers did an spectacular job transforming the drab space into a very earthy urban space with unfinished wood walls, furnishings, living plant wall, Japanese street art on the back wall, and sleek glass encased tatami rooms. There's also counter seating available so you can overlook all the action in the kitchen.   ~ * ~P A R K I N G~ * ~ Difficult street parking after 6 pm and on the weekends. The Kabuki parking garage is a block away.   Izakaya is never complete without sake, shochu, or any alcohol for that matter.   Thank you, waiter for the Kikushui recommendation: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1gDM6Jn&amp;s=66e6959976c7727bf2e73b2d23702d6a9b18e3628c5a53343c01c1f0952b9058\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1gDM6Jn</a>. I almost twerked my way back home. Luckily, I saved everyone's eyes and ended up at the Korean market next door drunk shopping. Came home with a bag of fish cakes. Fish cakes. *Le sigh*  Happy Thirsty Thursday! *Kanpai*",

It's a very good combination of one boiled egg wrapped with pumpkin and the whole thing was deep fried. Very yummy.  The interior design of the restaurant is also nice. The service was good too.

My issue was with the consistency of the food. About half the things that came out were kinda blah/average and the other half were excellent. My guess is that when they were making the menu, they were trying too hard to please everyone instead of just concentrating on what they were good at.  Kabocha Croquette - Super Blah. Its basically what it sounds like. A soft boiled egg sitting inside mashed yam and then deep fried. Not that great.  Buta Toro - Somewhat better than average. Just pork belly grilled. Nothing special here.  Sake Onigiri - Way overcooked/burned on the outside with barely any salmon inside. Probably the worst dish of the night.  Uni Onsen Tamago - The best dish of the night for me. The uni was fresh and paired very well with the soft cooked egg and sauce.  Miso Black Cod - Delicious. Made perfectly and melted in our mouths.  Kalbi Tempura - Could have been a bit crispier, but otherwise was executed well.  Service was a bit lacking as they understaffed and overworked. They never brought out water and didn't ask to refill our green tea. They also forgot to bring out one of our dishes until we were about to sign the check.   But yes - this place has potential to be better.. just remove the things off the menu that are average and hire more servers. :)",

    "review_text": "I really really really wanted to like this place but there were quite a few things that were disappointing...  The food did taste pretty good, I will give it that. I would recommend ordering the momo skewers (chicken) and the ika yaki (grilled squid) because these were my favorite dishes. We also had the chicken karaage (fried chicken pieces), kaki fry (oysters) and the tuna poki salad. The karaage was flavorful but cooked a bit too much but my bf really liked the oysters. The poki salad was actually surprisingly spicy, but there wasn't much on the plate for $12!! Definitely a rip off since the dish is mostly greens sprinkled with a few chunks of tuna =( We ended with a spicy tuna roll which was very good: big pieces and lots of yummy fish inside.   The service here was pretty bad which put a damper on the whole evening. We were seated promptly at a \"communal table\" but then were offered a private table which we accepted. However this table was right next to the kitchen which was kind of loud and busy.... I thought this would make it easier to flag down a waiter but boy was I wrong!! It took at least 10 minutes before we even saw our waiter, and this was after I had asked the water guy to send someone over!! Unacceptable. After we ordered I was waiting for the glass of wine to come out first since this is usually easy to pour and bring out, but it didn't come until almost all our food had been served!! What?! My bf had to ask after the wine as well, otherwise I would have received it AFTER we had finished our meal -____-   The food was brought out pretty quick but the waiters pretty much just bring the food to your table and are not very knowledgeable in regards to the menu (my bf asked how many pieces were in the spicy tuna roll and the guy had to go to the kitchen to check.... I would think that was pretty basic information....) Overall most of the food was pretty good but it was PRICEY and the service was SUBPAR =( I would think twice about spending my money here.",

    "review_text": "It's hard to really see that the food lacks top quality when the hip, modern, LA-like decor of this restaurant makes it look so nice and aesthetically pleasing.   I'm obsessed with the interior of this restaurant. Everything from the long group tables to bar seating to two-person tables and the Japanese rooms where you take off your shoes and sit on the floor. The rich, wooden look of this place. Overall, this looks like a very quality, hip restaurant, but I was disappointed that the food wasn't matching the level of the design of the restaurant.   Overall, this place is more of a Korean-Japanese fusion style restaurant. Some Korean influences in the food which was unique and interesting.  My boyfriend and I love izakaya/tapas types of restaurants. I love upscale, hip restaurants so he thought this place would be great! He came here before and enjoyed it that he took me again this time around, but he was frustrated that the food was not of same quality as last time he came. Maybe we came on an off day?  We ordered 6 variety of plates from the menu (My prices are approx guesses from what I briefly remember) I think we kept ordering more because we were in disbelief of how disappointing our food was.:   -Chirashi bowl - About $16-$18 I think?- The rice was alright. The sashimi/cuts of fish were good, but the quality of the fish wasn't the best. There was even some salmon skin on our salmon. We've never seen that, never. And salmon (which is supposed to be the fattiest, hence one of the butteriest/smoothest fish was actually the chewiest, yuck) The other fish tasted fresh and clean!  -Pork belly- About $10- This was sooo good. Good, thick cut. Melt-in-your-mouth pork that falls apart once your tongue hits it... It was sitting in a delicious soupy sauce.  -Mushroom wrapped in bacon- About $8-Bacon was cooked well..This was good, but tasted a bit burnt (because of the mushrooms) that I couldn't really taste anything else. Most izakaya places know how to grill without the burnt tastes.   -Fried asparagus rolled in tuna with garlic chips - About $9-This was good, but it came out with the garlic chips so we had to ask for it a few times. When it came out, it wasn't even a garlic chip, but rather a few raw garlic shavings. So disappointed. The tuna was fresh and good, but the asparagus did not seem fried, but seemed raw. Was a bit sad because I wanted to try something fried.   -Poke salad - About $12- They should rename it to salad with bits of poke because there were honestly 6 pieces of itsy bitsy poke pieces (that were good), but still, we didn't expect to barely get any poke. Fyi, it's very spicy.  -Salmon Skin Katsu - \u00a0About $8- This tasted super fishy. I couldn't even finish it. But very nice crunchiness from the katsu and it wasn't too oily.  Overall, the aesthetics are very nice. The food was good, but a bit underwhelming at times. :( The prices are a bit steep for the small plates (normally I wouldn't mind how pricey it is if the food was awesome, but I thought for the food we did get, this place was overpriced.) Very small portions, decent food. Great service. Overall, this place is okay. I really wanted to love it, though.",

There are private rooms where you have to take your shoes off before entering. This looked like a cool spot for a group dinner party.  My date and I sat in the seated dining area in front of those rooms. I think I would prefer to sit at the bar, which looked pretty cool.  We shared hamachi kama, uni sushi, hamachi and tuna sushi. Didn't like the octopus; that was slimy and truly raw; not at all like what we expected. We also had the miso cod (or was it a sea bass) it white fish that was delicious. Over all the food was pretty good.  So why only 3 stars? Well customer service was friendly when they were finally at our table. Service was painfully slow. And it was a Wed-night; not that packed.

My wife and I have tried about 5 izakaya's around town, and Izakaya Kou is probably one of our favorite. Beautiful restaurant, unless you're stuck at the right side wall facing the kitchen. Sure, portion is somewhat small and but service was attentive, polite and unobtrusive. We ordered:  kabocha croquette - tasty, huge! sashimi kou - very average, will not order sushi/sashimi from here next time kurobuta pork yakitori - juicy dengaku miso eggplant - great miso sauce black cod - delicious, teeny tiny portion hamachi kama - acceptable beef tataki - too salty, 4 slices of overcooked, oversalted beef and a pile of greens buta kakuni (braised pork belly) - not too fatty but still melt in your mouth nagasaki ramen: huge bowl, generous with the vegetables and seafood.  Overall, the food was 3.5 stars, bumping it up 4 stars for the friendly and efficient service. I was well-fed and could barely walk out of the restaurant. But hey, Japantown is only one block away, so must drag self to get green tea ice-cream crepe obviously...",

The manager then decides to waive the $200 minimum for the tatami room. Fair enough.  The interior is decorated beautifully and very trendy.  The first half of order which was all the seafood came out first. The hamachi mamas were overcooked and bland.  The rest of our order (5 items) was either forgotten or overlooked. Eventually we asked the waitress to cancel the order. The waitress offered to charge us 50% off the remaining order. We obliged.  After we got the check we wish we just cancelled it altogether. $300 later and we all picked up pizza from Tony's.",

Everyone was very friendly except for the big guy at the counter. Maybe bad day? But no need to be rude or grab the check out of a friends hand. Very unprofessional.

There are couple of points I need to mention here.   1. The ambiance is unique. When you walk into the restaurant you will see everything is made by wood, even the chandeliers in the private rooms look really stylish.   2. Every dish is a product of art. The dish not only tastes good, it is also well designed with beautiful layout and made with fresh ingredients.   3. The service is fantastic. The server knows the menu so well and he even recommended some off-the-menu special dishes. Goodies!!!!   My overall experience was just amazing at this restaurant last night. We stayed there from 9pm to 1am.",

    "review_text": "If you even knew.  No, really. If you even knew just HOW difficult and frustrating it is to find a quality izakaya in the Bay. I might retire from my search for a while because my meal at Izakaya Kou was so underwhelming and disappointing, I've lost all patience and hope for discovering this elusive izakaya.   The reviews sound promising and the dishes are pretty good. However, it was the nonexistent--and might I even say biased--customer service that really ruined our experience. I even noted in my reservation that my partner and I were celebrating a special occasion. Hint hint: don't be total jerks to us.   From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, I sensed disaster. My boyfriend and I stood at the entrance for nearly 10 minutes as the host completely ignored us. He was seating another customer (who was standing right next to us!), which was totally fine, but even after helping her to her table, he didn't even look at us. Not a single nod of acknowledgement. Not a \"I'll be with you shortly,\" or \"just give me a few minutes.\" He was fiddling with checks and menus, which again, I understand but we're potential customers. Are you trying to drive us away? Finally, after 10 minutes of this nonsense, my partner stepped up to the register and informed the man that we had reservations.   After being seated, it took forever for a waitress to come take our orders (I'll get to the food later). The dishes arrived quickly but the staff only checked on us once during our entire dinner. This would be acceptable if only the two tables next to us didn't receive extremely attentive and courteous service. Nothing stings more than seeing your fellow diners being showered with lots of attention while you're ignored and neglected. I don't want to insinuate anything but both of the tables next to us were older Caucasian couples. I noticed the majority of this restaurant was non-colored folks (it's Japantown so I was anticipating more diversity). Perhaps the staff wasn't purposely overlooking us but it sure rubbed off that way. My boyfriend and I are Asian and in our 20s. Y'all can judge this for what it is.   Now to the food. We ordered the following small plates: *Unagi Don - large piece of unagi but a tad too sweet. *Kabocha Croquette - lackluster. The molten egg yolk in the center was interesting/creative but the flavors were dull.  *Buta Toro - not sure if it's supposed to be tough and chewy, but it was like jerky. The pork was savory and tasty though. *Takoyaki - average dish but stingy with the octopus filling--too much batter and not enough meat.  *Gindara Misozuke - LOOK AT MY PHOTO. $11 FOR A TINY PIECE OF FISH?! It's basically the size of a golf ball. WTH. The taste/texture/execution does not justify this ridiculous price. I'm guessing it was for the \"intricate\" presentation. I've ordered the miso cod at other restaurants and the portions were not this outrageous.  We also got some beers: Asahi Black and Kawaba Weizen. The beers were the best part of our night. Just drinking our misery away! Kidding. We were still hungry after our meal but didn't want to stay a second longer at Izakaya Kou and being subjected to the terrible service while everyone around us was treated like royalty. Unfortunately it took an eternity for them to get us the check so we were stuck there. The Universe can be so cruel.   This is an upscale izakaya; don't expect the hearty and lively atmosphere characteristic of traditional izakayas. The food can pass for 3 stars but the service...I've made my case.",

We tried several dishes and all of them were unique and delicious. I definitely will go back soon for other dishes and drinks!   Ambiance It is a beautiful place with lots of reclaimed wood and unique lightings. I felt like I was walking into a gallery almost. It has communal table section with beautiful lightings and air-plant art on the wall, sushi bar area, table seating area and Tatami rooms. Their Tatami rooms are beautiful and private. It has doors between rooms and separate entrance. The calm atmosphere balances very well with dynamic calligraphy artwork on the wall.  Food *Hamachi Carpaccio: 3 pieces served, Hamachi was very fresh and flavorful, green onion adds crunchy texture which made it very refreshing in my mouth. *Nagasaki Ramen: Great for the chilly SF weather! White spicy broth was very flavorful and had plenty of seafood and vegetables. This can be my perfect hangover remedy! *Uni Onsen Tamago: Very unique and delicate. Good balance between richness of egg &amp; uni and the refreshing sauce and slices of onions. I used a spoon to eat but you can actually drink to taste all the delicate flavors in your mouth. *Kuruma Ebi Zuke: This was so amazing! The more I chew, the more flavor I could taste. The server informed us that they marinate for two weeks for the perfect flavor and texture.  *Maguro Tataki: It was delightful, if you want something light, this is a good dish to start with. *Gindara Misozuke: Oh Yum... it literally melted in my mouth. The texture of black cod was so soft perfectly flavored with miso. If you like black cod, this is a must try dish.  Dengaku Miso: I love eggplant so I had to try this. The miso sauce on top of the eggplant was so good and it complimented very well with eggplant. *Kalbi Tempura: OH My.... I never could imagine to fry Kalbi. I am a big fan of Kalbi (the Korean rib) and I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this. It was fantastic. period. The meat inside was so tender and flavorful, and the outside was so crispy. Eating it with vegetables and the sauce really made my mouth heavenly.   Desert *Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream: I liked the fact that it was not too sweet. It had beautiful small edible flowers on the plate that certainly added beauty of desert. *Cheesecake with Bi-Rite Ice Cream (Salted Caramel Flavor): I usually wait in line at Bi-Rite Creamery to get Salted Caramel ice cream. So I was so happy to get this desert without waiting so long outside!   Drinks *Akira Organic: I like sake in general and I wanted to try something new that I haven't tried. Server recommended Akira and said this is USDA certified organic sake! It was very smooth and clean yet flavorful.   Overall I LOVED my experience at Izakaya Kou. This place surprised me twice. The first surprise I had was the price. I was expecting higher price because of the beautiful interior and the 3 dollar sign on Yelp, but the price was much lower than I expected which of course made me happy! The second surprise was the quality of the food. Based on the price and the vast amount of menu items, I did not expect too much on food, but the quality of each food I tried were so delicious, and the simple but beautiful plating made a statement.",

Highlights: - EXTENDED menu, and they keep adding new items to it!  - ATTENTIVE service - REASONABLE prices - GREAT organic modern decor, good quality tables and partitions - CLEAN, ROOMY bathrooms  We ordered mainly izakaya items from their small dishes, fried, yakitori, and grilled menus, and nothing disappointed. We loved their kabocha croquette  so much that we ordered two more, absolutely delicious. Pork bellies, chickens, bacons, sausages, raw or pickled goodies, we had it all! None of the meats were overcooked, food always arrived piping hot, and the sauces all had different flavours. Presentation was also kind to the eye. Despite the \"private\" table, I could tell that the restaurant started to fill up, yet our service stayed excellent the whole time. Various members of the wait staff checked in on us, kept our glasses filled, and were surprisingly quick at clearing our table of any empty plates... mmmmm keep the food coming!!!  I was a bit skeptical on trying a new place with a group, but I was really impressed by our experience. Despite it being just a soft opening, everyone already worked like a well-oiled machine.. kudos to that! Definitely looking forward to coming back to try out their other dishes!",

    "review_text": "A much needed addition to the \"other side\" of Fillmore St. The restaurant is situated on the corner of Geary and Fillmore, across the street from the Fillmore Center. This side if the street is slowly picking up. There is State Bird (which I can never get into anymore) and Social Study close by (and in the event of a moment of utter weakness, Panda Express!!). The night I was here I had a flurry of small plates and grilled eel (damn that was good; see picture). For some reason I had some udon as well which was entirely too much food. But I liked it and enjoyed it at the time. The ride home was a little rocky since I felt like Shamu stuffed inside a sardine box. But I brought this upon myself and hence could not complain too loudly. And I will do it again. Anytime there is a show at the Fillmore, I will pre-party to my stomachs content with the beautiful people chowing down at this place.",

Since it's been too long I can only recall vaguely the food. While nothing truly stood out, it was all decent with no real flaws.   I will say that food does come out in a swift pace so try to order in waves versus all at once due to lack of table space. Also the music gravitates towards the EDM scene, right up my alley way, but might not be for everyone.  They have traditional Japanese sit down rooms good for large parties secluded from everyone else.  Service is quick, especially tables with call buttons.   Overall Thoughts  I will have to go back another time and relive the experience again",

    "review_text": "I've been here twice now. This place has a few things going for it:  1. It's accessible. Next to Japan town, so parking nearby is easy. And it kept popping up on opentable when I was looking for dinner options.  2. It's a nice scene.  3. The food isn't bad.  Apparently I'm doing lists today - so why not a higher score?  1. It's a scene, so the food is expensive for what it is.  2. Presentation is great here, taste is okay.  3. The meal seemed to be randomly coursed and orders have gotten mixed up every time I've come here.  4. What was unique here wasn't that good, it was the food that can found at any other Japenese restaurant that was done well.  5. Worst of all, the last time I was here they were out of uni.  This is a pretty good date destination. It could be fun to go drinking here with a group. But I'm leaving this review mostly so I don't accidentally make the mistake of initiating a third trip to this place without remembering what I'm getting myself into.",

Very flavorful and rich for a usually dull fish. We also enjoyed the roe don and volcano roll. The ginger cocktail was fantastic! The restaurant is very chic and there are a few rooms with recessed seating, traditional Japanese style. Great service, our waiter was very knowledgable about the more obscure dishes. A little pricey, but totally do able for a special occasion. I highly recommend this place.",

    "review_text": "We were in the mood for Izakaya food later at night and were having bad luck with everyone being closed or unwilling to take us when they were about to close. Unlike the others, Izakaya Kou made us feel welcome even though kitchen was closing soon. The server was very friendly, helpful in recommendations, and gave us a primo table. The atmosphere here is much nicer and upscale than most Izakaya and the dishes were far more creative than typical. This was what I would conisider upsscale Izakaya. But the prices were not outrageous considering the atmosphere and quality of food.  Food standouts for me were (don't remember the proper names): 1) Battered japanese pumpkin with soft egg inside. This was a crazy Frankenstein creation that reminded me of a mixture between a corn dog and a scotch egg. It sounds weird, but was incredible tasting and a great portion size. 2) cheese corn - once again seems so simple as to be boring. It's cheese and corn. But it was delicious after an exhausting day of SF fun. It could have perhaps used a spicy component though for an extra dynamic. 3) chicken meatball - I'm not a big meat eater, but this was on point  If I lived closer to the area, I'd certainly want to go back post haste to try other stuff on the menu.   They also have an extensive sake selection if you're into that.  This was a real treat to have perfect food and service after other Izakaya places being unwelcoming jerks that night.",

    "review_text": "I came here for a friends birthday and we got the tatami room because are party was too large to be seated in the dining room. I have to say the service was really bad. Maybe because 18% gratuity was already added to the bill. We didn't get the menu nor a glass of water until I had to wave them down and that was 20 mins later. What was even worse is when the waitress asked us to clean are own table! (I think she is Korean) she told us to put the dishes that where done next to the sliding door. We told her that all the dishes where finish and that she can clear the table, but she insisted on us to put all the dishes which was more then 10+ next to the door. I think she didn't want to take off her shoes. My friend had to tell her that we didn't \u00a0want to get are hands dirty! She closed the door on us and never came back to clear the table even when we didn't have space to put the desert. You will expect excellent service if not at least good service after spending over $500 and giving $75 tip but think twice.  Besides the service food was ok and the atmosphere was nice.",

Using it as a learning opportunity, they identified kinks to iron out and took feedback to enhance the menu.  A couple of weeks later, I came back with my brother and ordered some new and old dishes alongside a pitcher of Asahi. Once again the service was friendly and the food delicious. The sushi was great (especially the ankimo), especially for the price. The yakitori was well prepared. And the okonomiyaki awesome with the bacon. The only item that could have been done better was the miso black cod. It was much better at the soft opening as this time it was a bit rubbery. In any case, the taste was there.  I hope these guys rock it. The location hasn't had a great history of restaurants, and if there's one restaurant that has a chance among them, it's Izakaya Hashibiro Kou.",
