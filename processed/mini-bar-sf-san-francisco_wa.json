Everyone that works here is beyond nice, Molly, Les, Summer take your pick..really a refreshing change in the SF bar scene.  And best of all they are huge supporters of the neighborhood, putting up new art installations on their walls every 6 weeks provided only by local artists!  And they support all the great local restaurants by allowing you to bring in your food (pizza from Little Star, lasagna from Herbivore, whatever) to eat while enjoying a tasty brew!  Cheers to Mini Bar!",

It's a great place for happy hour (although I'm not sure of their happy hour specials) with a few friends but probably not the place for a large gathering since it is kind of small. \u00a0Sure there might be an incentive to reserve the back room but this seems more like a launch pad for a longer evening. \u00a0Meet for some drinks and then head out somewhere else along Divisadero for some grub or something.  The atmosphere in this place is real nice too. \u00a0They have art work up and some of it seems to be WIP (like the bottle caps and Muni passes next to the bathroom). \u00a0The can collage on the wall near the bar is super cool too.

Lots of variety in the local art from sculptures, paintings on the wall and canvas to skateboards. Art makes the atmosphere but as the name says it's pretty small. My favorite place to sit is in the far back, it has steps up and its a cozy setting, with a comfortable and seats, good for a small group to hang. Sometime it gets too packed and uncomfortable to drink wine when people are bumping into you if your standing. Its nice if you want to get dressed up or a special occasion and go out. Usually no cover charge, but we were there on New Years Eve it's expected everywhere, just arrived before 10 so it was free.",

The drinks are very much over priced, $6 for a house wine, which wouldnt be so bad if they wheren't so extremely skimpy on the pours. Ive had heavier pours at wine tastings. This was shitty wine, get over yourselves.... Next they charged my girlfriend $3 for a water. Maybe that lemon was really expensive...

I'm not sure how often the bouncer who was there on Sunday works the door, but he was great! \u00a0He was very friendly (he took several pictures for my friend's birthday) and even played a little harmonica for us. \u00a0  Even though we were there on a Sunday and the place closed at midnight, I did notice that they stay open 'til 2 on Friday &amp; Saturday. \u00a0This should be a standard thing, \u00a0but I have noticed that some bars in this neighborhood close early on weekends, so this made me happy when I saw this. \u00a0I really liked this place, and I may even be willing to the brave the crowd to stop in for a drink or two in the future :)",

Booths line one side of the wall which make for good art viewing but you sit in a row with your friends which is bad for convo but great for a photo ops. Think A Clockwork Orange's Korova Milk Bar scene featuring Alex and droogs posting and staring. So maybe Mini Bar seating is better for photo ops than conversing. Tell your camera happy, FB posting peeps wassup!  If you're lucky enough to snag the back room, grab it. This smoking room sans smoking offers comfy, couches for intimate lounging and chatting.   A friend's had problems with a door man but I haven't and find the bar staff nice.   Prices are quite fair. Top shelf whiskey -- bulliet -- for $6. Quality drafts for $4.

I mean the place is narrow but it's like a cave- it goes pretty far back. It may even be the same square footage as 821. The bar is attractive and they have a prosecco (which was interpreted as \"percocet\" when I ordered it...) that's actually pretty tasty. Unlike 821, these guys have real booze, which makes Mini a dangerous destination for me, especially on a school night.  Overall, it's a pretty cool space. The actual bar is a little small and seating in the front comfy booths can be hard to come by but there's also an upstairs space with couches and chairs.

The bartenders are incredibly skilled. Every time I've been here, which has been quite a few times, I've asked for a drink in loose terms and let them make me something.. You know, \"I'd like something warming and Whiskey based, not too sweet, not too heavy on the Whiskey, maybe along the lines of a Blood and Sand, but different\".. and BAM! I'd get EXACTLY that and LOVE IT!  Also, it's dog friendly, and has a great little sofa filled lounge area in the back!  Can't go wrong here!",

It's got a lively, interesting mix of people, good drinks, and quick service. However, I wouldn't go here in a group of more than 4, as this place is just too small.   Mini bar is indeed mini. Finding a space to sit is usually out of the question, as there are only 2 or 3 small tables in the front, a cozy lounge area at the back, and about 8 seats at the bar. Even standing can be hazardous, as the place is so narrow there's basically nowhere to stand without sort of blocking traffic. But it is a bar, after all, so if this is a dealbreaker for you, you're going to have a hard time finding a good drink in this town.   This is one of the only bars (maybe even the only bar?) in the area that serves hard liquor, which probably explains why it's always crowded. It serves no food, so dogs are welcome and almost always present... my pup loves to snooze under the bar stools when we're here. Mini Bar's walls showcase work by local artists, the quality of which ranges from \"meh\" to \"wow.\"   Pros: hard liquor, good service local art, dog friendly Cons: tiny, loud",

Mini bar has been open for, I think, about 2 years now and they've stayed surprisingly true to their premise. A small bar, good friends, good neighbors, and a splash of local art over reasonably priced drinks. The bartenders are very friendly, at least one of them has a pretty awesome taste in music. The drinks are fairly strong but they won't knock ya over (unless you ask for it). They carry a decent amount of respectable beers. And they do push that gimlet on ya for some reason, but it ain't bad.   I really like that during the annual Noise Pop festival, they host the \"art of noisepop\" on the walls, which is a bunch of historic promotional posters and what not. Very cool. They also feature lots of great local photographers.  The only reason this bar doesn't get 5 stars is that, like any good thing in this town, it's ruined by the crowds. It's become near impossible to grab a seat here on the weekend, and even Thursday has become a challenge. Yes, I am blaming them for being popular...but lots of people goes against the whole \"mini\" concept. You can't meet new friends when the person next you already brought his 6 best ones with them.

I was able to get the bartender's attention pretty quickly, and he was actually pretty cool; I ordered a Kettle One &amp; Soda for my friend and a Hendrick's Martini (up with 2 olives) for myself. I guess he had to run an errand because he then stepped out of the bar and another person made my martini. Again, she was nice enough, but at nearly $8 per drink, I was expecting a perfectly made cocktail. Instead I got a version that was at once too dirty and too sweet. Maybe I'm used to drinking at Absinthe or NOPA, but to me a martini is that classic that just has to be done right.   If you do go, try and go early and get the front booth, seems like a good spot to enjoy a few drinks with friends.",

The kicker was during beer week when they were serving Pliny the Younger. They had run out but continued to serve flights - that's fine but instead of letting me know they were out of the Younger when I ordered, the bartender just served me four glasses instead of five. So then I had to ask where the fifth glass was and received in return, literally, a snort, an eye roll, and a terse \"We're out.\" Gee thanks, sorry I bothered you.",

I think I was distracted by the dogs more than anything else.  Good thing about this bar is they allow outside foods. We bought two pizzas from Little Star Pizza right across the street and munched away.  Great selection of beer along with Pliny the Elder and Damnation on tap. My boyfriend would love this place!

Somebody said in their review that it is a crime that the bartenders have double the room of the patrons, that is totally true.  The crowd is pretty much uniformly young and hip, lots of plaid, thick glasses and hip jackets in this place. It makes it worse that you can't ignore people you would like to because its so small. I'm not saying I walk into a bar thinking \"I don't want to see these people\" but when there are people way far ahead on the drunk level and you can't keep your distance it sucks.   There are comically small tables to sit at. Seriously. I don't think my laptop would fit on one. The only good thing I can say is that I enjoyed 2 of the art pieces on the wall.   So anyway, I paid double what I pay most places for a simple drink on the rocks and went up to the bar to ask if this was correct. I was thinking that I might have gotten the 18 years bottle instead, which is understandably pricier. I will never know because I was ignored completely and eventually gave up.   Not great. Over hip, over priced, too small. Two stars.  *****EDIT*****: Contacted by manager, offered a refund for the confusion and a free drink.",

This place has been open for 2 weeks the owner tells me-I sat at the bar and the bartender made me an awesome raspberry lemondrop-one of my favorite cocktails. THe atmosphere here is very friendly-I didn't dive too much into the signature cocktails, but the drink I had was perfect enough. Bathrooms are CLEAN  (Whooo-hooo!!)  The art on the wall is cool and I love the lil \"champagne\" room in the back ha! I would definitely come back here-I always appreciate new spots-never a dull day in SF ;)",

I see people complaining about the drinks not being good and this being a dive bar. It's all true to some degree. They have only a few beers on tab but the beers they have are good.  It's a dive of a bar and its perfect. The bartender knows how to make good drinks, there is usually not a huge crowd and the music isn't too loud.

When it gets packed in there, it gets packed. The drinks are stiff and interesting--try the shit weasel. Perhaps a round of shit weasels for all. Whoooo gives a shit?  There's an art rotation that is kind of hodgepodge and doesn't seem to follow any certain theme but it's interesting to look at. Drink prices are what you'd expect in a non-dive in SF. You're looking at $7 mixers for the better kinds of booze... Jameson..etc.  Not a bad spot at all, though I hear the burrito place next door is pretty wacked. And if you're smoking outside, do so on the left side of the building as the neighbors are trippin (Neighbors always be trippin) about living above a bar with smokers.  Only bummer, or perhaps a godsend, is that they close at midnight. With the drinks as strong as they are, that's probably the best decision for our collective health.",

    "review_text": "Well after a year of Mini Bar awaiting their green light to open, I am glad to see these folks up and running. \u00a0As a local in the neighborhood I know i am def. happy to see a full bar open up because one can only drink so much sake and soju cocktails- which have taken over everywhere due to SF's next to impossible liquor license acquisition. \u00a0I dont know who they had to knock off to get this license but whoever they were, I hope they are smiling in their grave knowing that the NOPA-lites are getting sauced and loving it. \u00a0R.I.P. soju. \u00a0I will say that when I stopped in on opening night, I didn't order a drink so I cant review that. \u00a0Also, it was not the neighborhood crowd which is fine and to be expected since it was an opening. \u00a0What I did pay more attention to was the art, which is decent but because of this aspect the lighting in MIni-Bar is way too bright. \u00a0They are lighting the art well but its not cozy nor relaxing. \u00a0Its like being in a gallery. \u00a0They have this cool lounge room (with what I think were leather sofas) in the back up a few stairs but when I went back to it I felt like I needed sunglasses if I were to ever hang back there. \u00a0If they dimmed the lights--that room will become prime make-out \u00a0real estate.--. Lighting for art's sake I understand, but at the end of the day this is a bar and should feel like one. \u00a0Minus one star for that. \u00a0And I agree with another reviewer who says that music is key and should be a main focal point. \u00a0I can't recall if and/or what they had playing but I do hope they incorporate good DJ's or mixes or both. \u00a0I spoke with one of the owners, Summer who was very sweet and welcoming and she mentioned they had been paying rent since last August! \u00a0Thats reason enough to get me in there for some drinks...these people need our support! \u00a0As if they haven't dealt with enough delays, she mentioned that \u00a0apparently there are 2 individuals in the neighborhood who arent so thrilled on a new bar so they have been making this long overdue opening not only annoying to the owners but us locals too and as a result \u00a0Mini Bar is required to close at midnight until further notice (upcoming public hearing: date unknown). \u00a0These folks protesting dont live above the bar or even on the same block so thats gotta suck for Mini. \u00a0This is Divisadero St. for crying out loud!! \u00a0So with a few hurdles still left to clear, by all intents and purposes --Mini Bar is open, looking good (minus the bright lighting), and serving up good cocktails. \u00a0They are also doing Bloody Mary's , etc. on the weekends starting around noon so that will be another plus for them. \u00a0Buena Suerte Mini-Bar---We got yer back but turn down those lights a bit!",

When a friend of mine told me she and friends were meeting here for drinks, I immediately thought \"well, just how 'mini' is mini?  Lemme tell ya, it's tiny. I think I've seen apartments bigger than this place. You can't fit more than two people side-by-side in the hallway leading to the living-room-type space in the back.   Its size, however, is not such a bad thing. Considering personal space is at a premium, it's a good place to meet the locals, chat it up and pet your neighbor's dog (as in it's a dog-friendly establishment). I've read reviews of this place being too \"hip\" for their tastes, but I didn't get that impression at all. If anything, as long as you're not a complete, loudmouthed tool (leave the Ed Hardy at home), you should ok here.  For a place so small, I wasn't expecting the beer + liquor selection to be as solid as it was. Russian River Damnation AND Salvation on tap? Specials on Pliny the Elder? Very nice. The mixed drink I had was stiff, too - snuck up on me real fast, that one.   As I mentioned before, the space in the back resembles a cozy living room that'll comfortably seat 6-8 people or so - perfect if you have friends from out of town.   So, all in all, Mini Bar has earned a spot on my \"must visit\" list whenever I find myself on Divisadero St.",
