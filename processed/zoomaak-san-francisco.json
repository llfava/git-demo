The manager has a lifetime of traditional Korean cooking experience in Korea but has developed this menu as fusion drinking foods served up similarity to tapas. The fried brussels sprouts with gochujang chilli sauce is insanely addictive and a perfect pair to a round of drinks. Also love the creative makgeolli cocktails and in particular the fresh fruit blends that taste like smoothies.  Get to know the voluptuous lady behind the bar. She's a hoot!",

My boyfriend and I ordered 5 small tapas dishes and they all came out yummy and beautifully plated. Price is reasonable, too. \u00a0We waited for this place to open for months.",

    "review_text": "New place on Fillmore Street!   Really interesting idea of taking old Korean tavern to a modern setting. The space is lit with cold neon color (from bar tables too). Two floors, can take about 40 people. I went on a Friday evening and it wasn't too crowded yet. The host/bartender Benjamin is very friendly.   I ordered Icing Grapefruit and I liked it, but I'm not sure if it's good news for you. I dislike the taste of alcohol so any drink that I like tend to be sweet and have very slight trace of alcohol =P It's very fruity and refreshing.  With the (relatively) recent addition of Izakaya Kou, Social Study, Origin and the expansion of State Bird Provision, this one block is more happening than ever. Now we just need a real boba place, a froyo shop and a good Chinese restaurant to complete the collection. Oh maybe also a Sephora.",
