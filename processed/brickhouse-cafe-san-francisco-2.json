On Saturday afternoon I stopped by here for some eats and cheap happy hour specials. If you go there between 4 p.m. - 6 p.m. (I believe it is), drinks are $1 off and appetizers are $2 off. This is what we got off the menu:  - Jalape\u00f1o poppers w/ basil ranch sauce: These were actually incredibly satisfying. They were seasoned well and the basil ranch sauce it was served with was really good -- way more fun than just your typical ranch sauce.   - Fish tacos: I wish I could write a review about this. But after ordering the server came back and told me they were out of fish....at only 4:30 p.m. Thought it was worth mentioning.   - Brichouse mixed green salad: This was actually quite delicious and my favorite of all of the items we orded. The raspberry vinagrette was incredibly tasty and the pear added a nice touch.   - Fried calamari: EEK! This calamari was not the business. So over cooked and really difficult to eat. It was so chewy and not tender at all. I won't be ordering this again when I return.  - Bloody Mary (2): The first one was a little off -- too much horseradish. But we asked the bar tender to tone it down on the second one and it was a much better turn out.  - Mamosa (2): A great poor and incredibly satisfying on a sunny san francisco day.  Total bill for 2 (large) appetizers, 1 (large) entree salad, and 4 drinks from the bar = $36.  When I got the bill I was shocked! So much food and a decent amount of drinks for so little money. Definitely a great spot for happy hour :)",

I can't think of too much else that's open at night in SOMA that fits these requirements.  Lots of burger and beer choices. I had the roast chicken, which was a little greasy, but suit me just fine.  Plus, we had a round of $2 PBR - can't complain there. With a jazz duo playing in the background, and cool little antique nick nacks all over the restaurant, I will likely be back, should i need something low key in SOMA again.",

Dining spontaneity doesn't always pay off so well.  Their food was consistently very good and they have a small but decent wine list. I thought the service was pretty good too. The one night they had some live music, which was a little loud in the small space, but enjoyable and an unexpected treat.  We were told their menu is seasonal too, so we'll definitely be back.",

    "review_text": "I've been here twice now. The first time was great- we came on a weeknight for dinner, and thoroughly enjoyed the food and beer. Come to think of it, I think we'd had many drinks that night, which may have skewed our perceptions. Oops.   With that experience in mind, we came back for late lunch on a Saturday (maybe 3:00ish). We had issues with the service and the food this second time around, so really, there were no redeeming qualities.   The place was actually pretty crowded, and I could tell right away that they were understaffed. Regardless, they quickly sat us at an open table without so much as a word (no \"how are you?\" or mention of how busy they were...nothing).   That initial exchange was a sign of things to come. We started reviewing our menu and eventually decided on what we wanted-- which takes a significant amount of time for my indecisive bf and I. As we're narrowing down our options, I realize that we haven't even heard from our waiter yet. 10 minutes later, he finally swings by and we order everything all at once, since who knows when we'll see him again!  From there, we don't see him for another hour or so. Someone else brings out our drinks and food, and we seriously have to hunt people down for refills and condiments. The food itself was eh. I got the chicken-brie sandwich, which was dry and and overdone. The bf got the burger, which was kinda soggy and fell apart. Ick.   I used to wait tables, so I have empathy for when servers are jammed, but seriously, just tell us and come up with a back up plan. Our waiter hardly said two words to us and never apologized for the lack of service. Not only that, but we had a hard time getting ANYONE to help us- bus boys, other servers, bartenders. It was really aggravating. I see little reason to come back again.",

    "review_text": "I've been to Brickhouse a couple of times already and I'm really not sure why. There's nothing incredibly appealing or uniquely special about this place but for some reason I find myself wanting to come back. Maybe it's the fact that it's a few blocks away from my apartment. Or maybe it's because it's a cool spot that isn't trying to do too much. There are no themes, no arrogant servers, no complicated menus: just good food, plenty of space, and a satisfying Happy Hour menu.  The food here is standard American fare. The burgers, sandwiches, and salads all come in hearty portions, are moderately priced, and most importantly: taste pretty damn good. The Grilled Chicken and Brie Sandwich was only $9 and tasted great. The melted cheese, juicy chicken, crisp apples, and fluffy foccaccia bread made for a kick-ass sandwich that I'd definitely order again. The calamari and garlic fries are also pretty good--well-seasoned and not overly greasy. There is also a pretty extensive beer menu (which is great considering happy hour starts early at 4:30 and lasts until 6:30pm!). Finally, brunch at Brickhouse is equally delicious. The vanilla bean French toast is incredible - fluffy, moist, and with the perfect hint of vanilla flavor. Definitely a must-try for all you French toast lovers!  Brickhouse gets bonus points for super friendly service, plenty of seating, and live jazz music Fridays-Sundays. Although it's certainly not a spot that is special enough to merit more than a 15-minute commute, if you live in South of Market, it's definitely worth the trek.",

    "review_text": "Now \u00a0I am sure the brickhouse is an excellent restaurant and is delicious. This review is referring to my dinning experience only. \u00a0  Ok so to start out, the restaurant was very accommodating, we did not wait too long before they had arranged some tables for us to sit at. The staff was pleasant and fairly on the ball with our mimosa and coffee orders. The atmosphere was cozier then I expected and they had a live person playing guitar in the background, so points for that.   I should mention that neither the coffee nor the mimosa were that good. The coffee was weak like an atrophied child and the mimosa was just a notch below \"meh\" quality. Actually, it was only $3 so I wont complain much.   On to the food. Here is where my dining experience takes a turn. I often battle between a few specific menu choices, and at the brickhouse was no different. The juevos rancheros and the Salmon Benedict were competing for my affection and as I had previously forgone salmon benedict at an earlier brunch I chose it here.  Oh how I regret that decision.  OK first off, I ordered the \"salmon benny\" with \"House smoked (house caught) sock eye salmon.\" It was the novelty of this house caught smoked salmon that intrigued me. However, when my dish came, no smoked salmon! None at ALL! It was just cooked salmon! WTF! This infuriates me! Don't promise me smoked salmon (one of my favs) then deliver just cooked salmon ( not one of my favs). On top of this, it wasn't even really that good cooked salmon. Most of it just tasted like kinda fishy eggs. Admittedly, maybe I shouldn't order fish and eggs if I am not a huge fan of fishy tasting eggs, but that's not what I ordered! The best bites were the bits that were covered in the sauce so they have the dish some resemblance of a deeper flavor beyond unseasoned salmon and eggs. Usually, I prefer less sauce on my benedicts, but in this case, there need to be more. Overall, I was deeply unimpressed and deeply disappointed. Perhaps if I wasn't expecting smoked salmon then I would have been happier with my somewhat bland fishy eggs.  A quick note in the positive for the brickhouse. The girlfriend ordered the juevos rancheros, and was kind enough to let me try a bit. It tasted delicious and made me rue my choice of menu items even more. This is an important note because I am giving the brick house 2 stars because of the my eggy salmon debacle, even tho based on what everyone else ordered they probably deserved better. Actually, the more I think about it, if I am wanting to go back, then it deserves 3, since Id probably not go back to a 2 star place. So 3 stars for now, simply because of the potential I saw in the gfs food. was good too.",

I ended up having the Mexican burger, which is a jalape\u00f1o infused beef patty, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo, and sour cream. I went sans sour cream, and used the chipotle aioli they have on hand. I must say, that was a pretty magical combination!  My fianc\u00e9 had the Chicken Brie sandwich and absolutely loved it. She also commented that the garlic fries were better than at the ballpark. She also used the chipotle aioli and thought it was outstanding. She also had a glass of wine and we were both pleasantly surprised about the selection of wines they had.   We finished it off with a cookie dough milkshake that was out of this world. The only mark down on the whole experience was the fact that her fries were cold and my onion rings were just ok. Nevertheless, from now on, every time we come to a Giants game, we're going to stop and eat at the Brickhouse!",

One of my coworkers suggested Brickhouse Cafe and the rest of us were indifferent about where to eat so the decision was made.  I got the Chicken Brie sandwich with the side salad of mixed greens. In hindsight, I should have done the upgrade to garlic fries or sweet potato fries instead of the salad because the fries actually smelled and looked very good. My sandwich came with sliced chicken breast, pesto mayo, brie, red onions, and apple on toasted foccocia bread. The filling of the sandwich was well-balanced and the flavors were great. The issue was the bread. It was a bit too toasted and my mouth got super scraped up. It was very uncomfortable :( This sandwich would have actually gotten 4 stars otherwise.",

I'm not wowed particularly by the food, it was good but nothing stands out of the ordinary to me in memory. But what does stand out for me, is that for a group of 9 girls, we were treated with horrible service. They mixed up our group and separated us when seating us, the waitress was slow in bringing out drinks whenever we were out, and she NO patience in taking our orders, she was actually snappy to us.   Really? 9 nice girls that are just there to catch up, munch on some food and have a good time. Also these 9 girls are more than generous tippers.   But oh no she was rude.

When I got to the counter I noticed a sign that said \"Free Wi-Fi. Please only make use of this after 2 pm.\" (Something very close to those words exactly). So I thought, great its just after two, no problem.   I ordered my drink, sat down and found that I couldn't connect to the internet. I went to the counter and asked the woman, \"Do I need a certain password or something that I'm missing for the wireless?\" She handed me a card with the wireless name and password. I sit down again, type it in and it still won't connect. A different worker passes by my table and I ask her if there's something wrong with the wireless to which she replies: \"Yeah, the wireless doesn't really work, it never has. I think I've gotten it to work twice ever maybe. I don't know why we even advertise for it. I don't really think there's anything else in this neighbord except for Starbucks, and that's (tilt of the head) Starbucks\"  First of all, I too would REALLY like to know as well, why you advertise for free wireless if it plainly and simply doesn't work. I'd like to know why the first employee I asked about it didn't happen to mention a thing, and I'd like to know how many customers have been driven away in the past because of this false advertising. I find it especially ironic that there's a sign next to the register advertising their new ten dollar minimum on credit cards because \"this recession is killing us!!!\" Maybe you all should step up your game, get your wireless fixed once and you could be opening your doors to a whole host of missing customers in those lonely late afternoon hours.   I'm sure as a business owner, the image of hoardes of laptop bearing, two dollar coffee sipping people infesting your place all afternoon is far from your favorite. But keep in mind people who work also eat sometimes too. I'm sure you could take a nod from some of your more successful competitors and figure out how they manage to maintain a consistent lunch, laptop and happy hour crowd, and are, surviving the recession.

    "review_text": "So here's a bit of a shocker. I'm giving Brickhouse five stars for my two recent dining experiences there. Why did you slap your forehead? Yes, five stars because it's mighty might just lettin' it all hang out. And she's the one, the only one who's built like an am-a-ka-zawn.... what did Lionel Richie just say? Anyway, I had originally written off Brickhouse as a ballpark hangout for people who wear those orange styrofoam fingers while eating drippy chicken wings and downing some brewskis. But I guess I was mistaken. Dinner is the option to take.   Jamie W. and I came here last week with zero expectations. We were going to grab a bite at 21st Amendment, but as usual, it was packed. Ozone was blaring Eurotrash dance music through their patio speakers. Alas, when we sat down and saw the menu, it really just looked like your standard brewpub selections - burgers, ribs, fish n' chips - nothing that sounded wow. As we do at Perry's, we shared an $8 Wedge Salad, which was frankly much better than the one at Perry's (see photo). I think the key differences were the size and quality of the pancetta and the addition of crispy leeks and cucumber chunks that made it fuller in flavor.   Jamie ordered the $14 Stick-to-Your-Ribs Baby Back Ribs, which was a hefty slab of fork-tender pork over fries (see photo). Timing is everything as he just ordered almost the same thing at the Tee Off Bar in the Outer Richmond. There the overly sweet sauce completely overpowered the ribs that had been in the smoker a little too long. At Brickhouse, the sauce was more mild and modest in portion, and the rib meat was moist. Mine was a true unexpected winner, the $18 Brandy Apple Pork Chop, which was honestly one of the best prepared pork chops I've had at a restaurant (see photo). Seasoned nicely outside and moist inside. The grilled apple slices on top, usually a death knell for such an all-American dish, were just the right consistency and sweetness to offset the savory.   It came with grilled asparagus and golden polenta grits, which were a tasty, chunky alternative to the more predictable mashed potatoes. So the question became... was this just a fluke? I held back on a review until our second visit last night. This time, the place was packed. There was live music from a sadly ignored jazz duo performing buttery smooth standards. Lots of young T-shirted guys, colleagues obviously, have congregated for after-work eats. We managed to score a corner table with a view of the duo.   We decided to share the $12 Organic Beet and Arugula Salad, which you should be forewarned is a massive pile of green (see photo). Delicious with a monstrous grilled portobello mushroom sliced on one side and big wedges of red beets on the other. Smaller beet cubes, goat cheese and toasted walnuts finished the dish. This time, Jamie tried the $14 Anchor Steam Beer-Battered Fish n' Chips, two large, tasty and lightly crisped filets over fries with a remoulade dipping sauce (see photo).   Mine was even more back-to-basics, the $16 Rosemary Roasted Half Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus (see photo). Sounds like a Marie Callendar frozen dinner, doesn't it? It's all in the execution - moist inside and with a nice savory sauce. There is nothing revolutionary about the food. It's simply and honestly satisfying food, especially after a taxing day at the office. The eclectic Victorian vibe is comforting with the waitresses on both occasions really attentive no matter how many diners there were. It's a cozy neighborhood place that probably doesn't need much crosstown traffic to survive. That just means more pork chops for me.   FOOD - 5 stars...yes, can you believe it?... excellent traditional brewpub fare really well executed  AMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...warm vibe makes you want to hang out on a weeknight to avoid the cold world outside  SERVICE - 5 stars...really attentive with no fuss or pretension  TOTAL - 5 stars...it's mighty might just lettin' it all hang out!",

I stopped going there after more than once having to ask the counter person if my bagel was ready yet.

Like everyone else mentioned, the line is long so plan accordingly. \u00a0I'd say try and come before the noon rush for sure. \u00a0They have seating upstairs as well. \u00a0The few other times I've been here, I remember saying to myself I wouldn't be back for a while. \u00a0But I didn't say that this time and I really want to try the Chicken Brie sammich everyone is talking about. \u00a0Til next time...",

Tried the Wagyu burger today, with sweet potato fries. Several problems with the lunch; the lettuce was limp/wilting, and onions soggy/limp. The buns were burnt. the burger wasn't anything special. It was juicy, I'll give them that, but there wasn't much flavor for the ensemble as a whole. (served dry w/no sauce) The fries were overcooked, dry and on the edge of burnt. All said, for 20+ bucks (I had cheese for an extra buck, with tip $25 total), I'd rather eat an Umami. New menu + higher prices + poorer quality = Brickhouse has jumped the shark :(",

The Wait - A bunch of coworkers and I ordered to-go. Now I don't mind waiting for food to be prepared, but when 6 out of 7 orders come out and we sit there waiting 10 minutes for the last to come out, it's kind of annoying.

I've been a fan of the Brick House Cafe, and the Brickhouse Melt sandwich for years. \u00a0I went for lunch today and had this exchange at the counter:  Me: \u00a0I'd like the Brickhouse Melt please  Manager: \u00a0Sorry, it's not on the menu anymore. \u00a0We are redoing the menu.  Me: \u00a0Uhhh.... really. \u00a0Gee, it's like a signature item for this place. \u00a0Named after the establishment.  Manager: \u00a0Yeah, it's been on the menu for nearly 20 years, but we wanted to make a change.  Me: \u00a0I see... so I guess it just wasn't selling very well ?  Manager: \u00a0Oh no, it sold really well, but we thought we'd like to make a change and take if off the menu.  Me: \u00a0Uhhh... OK... but that really doesn't make sense. \u00a0I could see if you weren't selling them, or if people didn't like them. \u00a0  Thinking to myself now: \u00a0Do you understand the concept of repeat business and signature items ? \u00a0I also looked up reviews of the Brickhouse Melt sandwich on Yelp - people LOVED IT, and wrote about it often.  Back to the Manager, who said: \u00a0No, they were selling. \u00a0We just wanted to make some changes. \u00a0Do you want to try the Turkey Club instead? \u00a0  Me: \u00a0Yeah, sure. \u00a0  So I tried the Turkey Club. It's OK, but NOT a club sandwich at all. \u00a0Accordingly to Wikipedia (i.e. source for ALL KNOWLEDGE, ha ha) a \"Club Sandwich\" is a multi-layered construct made with toasted (flat) bread- usually 3 layers in my experience, and (because of it's nice height) held together with toothpicks. \u00a0  This Turkey \"Club\" was on a hoagie-style roll of french bread. \u00a0Not bad, but not a \"Club\". \u00a0  Yeah, sure, so you might say that not all \"club\" sandwiches are multi-layered, but MOST are. \u00a0So when you name an item a \"club sandwich\" the majority-vote expectation of the person ordering it is that it will be like other \"club\" sandwiches. \u00a0This one was not.  And it was not nearly as good as the now defunct \"Brickhouse Melt\". \u00a0Damn that was one great sandwich.  I shudder to think of all the other great items that may have been deleted from the menu under the ridiculous logic being adhered to by the person that decided to \"redo\" the new Brick House Cafe menu.  Not sure if I'll find out. \u00a0Not sure if I'm going back.  There is never-ending silliness and entertainment in this world... if you just pay attention.",

The place, true to its namesake, resides in a checkered red &amp; white brick building sporting some nice signage out front. \u00a0As you walk in, a small, precarious staircase to your right leads to a loft containing tables and a TV--a good place to conquer if you're arriving with a big group and/or wanna watch the game. \u00a0Otherwise, as you venture further into the main floor you're greeted by a streetlamp, long main communal table sprouting a tree in its center, mahogany booths to your right and an mirror-backed bar on your left. \u00a0The walls variously host wallpaper, an assortment of interesting pictures/people, and the question-of-the-day chalkboard. \u00a0The latter offers menu discounts for answers to somewhat off-kilter questions. \u00a0  The happy hour menu was very respectable---notably the $10 beer pitchers. \u00a0And while it's difficult to get your entree under the same price, the atmosphere and craftsmanship, particularly with the sandwiches, warrants the cost.   On our trip, a talented bassist and guitar player were running through holiday standards. \u00a0Would've been enough to give even the wet bandits pause. \u00a0  Screw catch and release---this one's a keeper.",

The busboy was nice and never let my water glass go empty.  AMBIANCE: I liked the overall feel of the space, except for the awkward tree growing out of the table. That was weird (and dirty!

I thought I'd be getting a nice fluffy fritata... instead it was like an omelette that hadn't been folded over. Plus it was so weirdly cooked-- rubbery in some spots and totally runny in others (ew).  - Western Cowboy scramble: I only tried a few bites of this. It was mediocre.   OVERALL: I doused the entree in tabasco + ketchup + sriracha... so... make what you will of that. It was pretty pricey too. Probably won't be returning.",

I've been for brunch and dinner, though prefer the brunch/lunch options. Their \"big ass burger\" ($11) really is big... I could only eat half, though there's great topping combos like mushrooms and avocado (and bacon, if you're a fan). They also have a \"small ass burger\" ($9) which doesn't have the fancier toppings but is a more manageable portion. If you're vegetarian, I'd stick with one of the veggie scrambles rather than the veggie sandwich (mozzarella, tomato, avocado, red onions, balsamic... on a kinda stale baguette - or at least ask for the baguette toasted).

    "review_text": "OK, quick rundown of why this place is awesome:  High-quality ingredients Creative dishes Strict attention to detail Fair prices Great ambiance Good service Self-serve water Full bar Huge plasma TV Great selection of coffee High-quality tables and seating  The first time I came here, I was blown away, and ready to run back to my laptop and give it 5 stars. The inside of the restaurant is very well-done; there's a nice pale yellow/burgundy/dark wood color theme going on, plus there's a tree in the middle of the dining room that adds a nice (tropical?) touch. They have a full bar with a huge plasma screen, a wide and well-priced selection of coffee drinks, an unbelievable upstairs with what looks like designer furniture, and all the people who work there seem helpful and personable.  I usually spend a good five minutes pouring over the menu ANYWHERE before making a decision on what to get. However, I was sold on this place after reading the first item on the menu: a hot sandwich with grilled chicken breast, melted brie, red onions, pesto many and crisp apple on toasted focaccia. I figured that if they have thought about a sandwich that delicious, they will love sandwiches enough to craft it perfectly...and they did. The chicken was juicy and flavorful, the cheese was melted perfectly, the bread was toasted just right...the flavors of each ingredient mingled perfectly, and it was then (or maybe it was after they brought me a free sample of tiramisu smoothie) that I knew I would have a long, meaningful relationship with Brickhouse Cafe.  The second time I went, I wasn't as wowed, but that's not to say it was a bad meal (it definitely was not). They had a meatball sandwich special, \u00a0which turned out to be good but not great (granted, I set the bar pretty high for this place after my first visit); I thought the sandwich itself was too small, as well as the amount and the size of the meatballs. Additionally, the marinara sauce was good and well-spiced but not out-of-this-world like the sandwich I had the time before. I got the fries this time instead of the side salad, and they are (here comes my token phrase!) fundamentally sound; they're a good size, just like you'd expect at a proper restaurant. But if you don't want to pony up the extra dollar for the fries, they include a side salad with lettuce and bell peppers, which is a healthy little extra to round out your meal.  Now one thing I haven't gotten to are the burgers. The fact that they tell you to allow 20 minutes for it was a sign that I need to try it (in reality, it's about 8-10 minutes, but they say 20 just to be safe). Also, quick note, you can phone in your order, but they assume it's a to-go order unless you tell them otherwise. I was going to go with the classic burger, but I stepped it up and went for the SOMA burger, which has melted swiss, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms and avocado. Simply put, it was a very good burger. High-quality beef (though I thought it was a bit too pink for ordering it medium), perfectly melted cheese, and a heaping pile of mushrooms and onions. However, I will say that I thought they could have put more avocado. The burger is a bit expensive at $12.32 with tax, but it's definitely, definitely worth trying.",

Lunches- If you don't go at the right time, you usually get stuck in a long line and although they are pretty efficient, it can still take you a while to get your food.

They're getting cheap, while charging more for everything. The not so tasty, but helpful gluten free bun has gone up a buck. \u00a0I'm sorry, but I can bring my own, not too mention better tasting gluten free bread for less than $3.  About the only thing to say is when I want to pay too much for a burger, this is the place to go. \u00a0  $2 for onions and pico de gallo added on, making a meal that costs less than something else with major protein that adds way more than that. \u00a0Plus I'm not getting the bread.   Then I not just wanted the onions &amp; cheese in the scramble, I needed the onions cooked. \u00a0It was just the Pico de Gallo to be on top, not everything.  I just paid $13 &amp; change + tip for something not worth $7. \u00a0I didn't question the cost, because I'd also ordered a mocha which wasn't included. Also I miss the white velvet (white chocolate version of mocha).  Once I've specifically would have picked brickhouse for a minimum of the next five times, I'm eating somewhere else. \u00a0From the other reviews, I can see there's some general quality issues going on.  Plenty of other places that can get eggs right and I can pick up better pico de gallo for less, too.",

The waitress was amazed and said she's never gotten a full table requesting the same sandwich, though it is her favorite sandwich as well. Sandwich was still delicious, but not as great as last time--maybe because they had to make 5 in one go, thus couldnt give as much attention to each sandwich.   Some updates on the sandwich: - The flavor of the onion was more present this time around - The brie got a little lost (not as big) =\\ - Side of salad MUCH bigger than the to-go.  Got to dine in this time. The waitress was very friendly. We sat in the nook by the door, so it was a bit chilly, but it had a nice ambiance and it felt very homely sitting by the four panel window with a table lamp and a tulip. The place wasnt packed, which is nice if you're looking for a happy hour place without fighting with people's elbows. A live band came in around 7p, but it wasnt loud enough to disrupt our conversations or have to talk over it.  This was a perfect place to catch our with our friend who was visiting--it had a nice balance of chill and beer-loving fun.",

Because we hadn't eaten all day and were in for a late night, our friend sent us a block away to get some dinner at the Brickhouse Caf\u00e9 &amp; Saloon. It was a small, unassuming place with some great live jazz playing when we walked in. The place had maybe 25-30 seats max, plus some at the bar and I believe an upstairs area which I didn't get to check out. They had a great cocktail menu and a decent selection of beers. Their menu is stocked with tons of food, but what surprised me was their huge burger selection. Most places I go to these days, even burger specialty restaurants, don't have as many pre-made selections as this place did. Quite a nice surprise for a last-minute dinner!  I went with my go-to mushroom and swiss burger to have something fairly neutral but still provide me with an idea of what these guys could do. The buttery bun looked smaller than the meat, but ended up being proportioned quite well in the long run. The patty had great beefy flavor with a small amount of char, and was cooked perfectly. The mushroom chunks didn't stand out even though they were quite large, and the cheese was nicely melted but also didn't have too strong a flavor. Unfortunately the fries were only so-so, and I wished they were a bit more to compliment this strong burger. Overall it was juicy, wet and great. I don't think you can go wrong here with many of their options; the prices were good, the drinks were great, and the live music was a treat.",

Food - the burgers are good but not great. The vegetarian food here SUCKS. Their \"handmade\" veggie burger tastes like a stale morningstar burger which is so dry it will give you cotton mouth.   2. Bad Service - they also screw up my order more often than not (seriously, I started keeping track a while ago and they have a 58% screw up rate). I have often been kept waiting for 20-30 minutes - and not even at peak lunch times, but after the crowd has left.   3. Cleanliness - last but not least: on multiple occasions I've seen several different cashiers display blatant disregard for basic hygiene standards. On one occasion a sick cashier who looked like death coughed all over some poor guys order. On another occasion, they had my order ready but didn't know it was mine, so it just sat on the counter for 10 minutes. When I asked about my order, they were confused, and realized that the order sitting on the counter was mine. First a cook, and then a couple of minutes later after I asked again, a cashier - they both opened the to-go box and pushed down on the sandwich with their bare fingers to see if it was still hot. Then the cashier gave it to me - obviously it wasn't warm, so I asked for a new one- and she just said sorry and shrugged. Obviously they take the food here very seriously.   4. Price - horrible value, and in the evenings they cook even crappier food under the guise of being a sit-down gastropub and charge twice as much for it. As for the salmon that the owner proudly procured himself on his annual Alaska trip - I'd much rather have store bought salmon which was flavored properly.   Bottom line: good if you want a mediocre (at best) and likely unsanitary lunch.",

It was a basic burger with lettuce, tomato, red onions and a pickle. The other specialized burgers looked really good too. The fries are nice and crisp, nothing spectacular though. The last time I had the apple chicken brie sandwich which I really liked. The apple gives it a nice crunch. I want to try their tomato bisque and sandwich combo next time.

I love the benedict here, you should try both the regular, salmon and florentine versions. THEY DO NOT DISAPPOINT. Ok I lie, the only thing that disappoints me is when I realize my plate is empty and I want more and I'm on the verge of licking the last of the deliciously smooth (not too sour) holindaise sauce up. What makes the benedict different is that they serve it on a thick house made bread instead of english muffins. The florentine version loads you up on a whole pile of spinach, the regular has delicious not too salty canadian bacon and the salmon version is caught by the owner according to the menu. They serve it with their delicious breakfast potatoes! nom!   Also - did I mention $3 mimosas? Endless refills on your coffee and tea? yup.",

The food was OK. \u00a0The jalepeno crab drip was a bit bland. \u00a0Granted, I'm from the home of the The Wire and use to blue grab, but I still think that this was a bit bland. \u00a0I got the Waygu burger blue moon style. \u00a0Again, a bit bland - had to ask for extra buffalo sauce to spice it up (though while I admit I love condiments, it needed more than the wipe of buffalo sauce on the bun). \u00a0But the food was hot when it came out and the server seemed nice. \u00a0  Certainly would not bring out of towners here to show off our gorgeous city, but if you are looking for a big variety of things to eat locally and OK food, not a bad choice.   Wonder how my friend is doing...  P.S. Saw a new Audi A6 with all LED lights on the walk back home...wow.",

Next time I come to SF again I will swing by this place. Take a risk if you want to get your own seat because it's a first come first seat basis. You should probably try to avoid the weekday lunch hours since that is their busiest time.  Other than that, please do enjoy their menu. I know I did and I always recommend this place.

The bar looks to be Southwestern themed, with buffalo buffalo buffalo skulls lining the walls and pieces of brick with museum tags on the walls, presumably of some geographic, historic, or fictional importance (although I did no musing, out of respect for my company).  I got a nice 8oz Wagyu burger ($18) with swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and a pickle inside, cooked medium. The sweet potato fries were good but looked a little sad -- on the other hand, my compa\u00f1ero's onion fries looked and smelled delicious! Never doubt your first instincts, either on Scantron or burger menus.  I had two rounds of the California hef (note to self: stick to the Germans next time) to top off the meal. All in all, I had a good conversation over good food.  Total bill per person came out to 35 with tip, but if you get a regular burger ($10 to 12) You're probably looking at something closer to $25 -- not bad for beer and burgers.",

The food can be described as bland at best. I had the smoked seafood salad. The portion size was good but the salad dressing was tasteless. I could have made a better salad dressing at home. My bf ordered the salmon ravioli off the menu only to be told that they didn't have it. They actually had lobster &amp; crab. No big deal. He went with that. Portion size for the ravioli was pretty small but it did come with a side of garlic bread. Also when we sat down, we were given 4 meager slices of bread. And meager is a very generous description. From reading the other reviews, it might be better to come here for brunch or to order simple stuff like the burgers.   We had a super spunky and nice waitress. \u00a0While we like her, we had to ask several times for more bread and it took a while to for the food to come out.",

This is a really different kind of place and is not what I expected for the location and what it looks like on the outside. It's somewhat near the industrial district, which is generally grimy/dark/cold... but the inside of this place is the complete opposite!  Warmly lit, cosy feeling, rustic atmosphere. This place is great on the inside! When we got there, there was a three man blues band playing, which really adds to the feel of the place.   Though the place was crowded and we had seven people in our group, since we had made a reservation, we were seated immediately upstairs (highly recommended) and away from the din below.   The waiter (Chris, I think his name was) was super friendly and accommodating. One of our friends was a bit (like a lot) *ahem* inebriated... And kept knocking over drinks, throwing things on the floor... A bit embarrassing since this place seemed really nice, but the waiter took everything in stride and good humor, cleaning up every spill, bringing more drinks and food, etc.  The food was okay. Nothing quite blow me away kind of thing, but not bad. I ordered the seafood salad... which wasn't great. Other people got burgers and seemed to enjoy them... so I guess it was okay. The drinks were alright but definitely not memorable. They get a star for service (incredibly accommodating), star for atmosphere (super cosy), and a star for the entertainment... other than that... food and drink are probably a pass for me.

Also the tables were really close together. I had a party of just my bf and I and our table for two was extremely too close to another table for two. Too close for comfort. I felt like I was also having brunch with these people. But I guess the restaurant has a map for how to seat their guests. They're obviously not going to seat two people at a table for four. Also, be careful about their order for seating people. I was sitting right by the door and next to the stand where the host stands. I watched as a couple was extremely upset when a couple that came after them was seated first and had a nicer table.   Anyways, my bf and I ordered corn beef hash and a salmon Benedict. I asked for English muffins and scrambled eggs. My meal was pretty decent. Everything was cooked well! My bf's dish eggs Benedict was on a focaccia bread instead of an English muffin! Never saw that before. His Benedict was also very tasty. I didn't enjoy the smoked salmon that much. I thought it was a little too salty for me but my bf enjoyed his dish. Each of our dishes were very filling.   Overall service was pretty decent, although our waitress never came back to refill our waters. Maybe we were at a disadvantage because we were sitting at the very front of the restaurant. I liked that they did not seem to rush us out of the restaurant. They didn't bring our bill out until we had asked for it.   Would love to try this place again, but maybe not during brunch time for it may be a long wait.",

The ambience is small but cozy. \u00a0There is an upstairs that many don't know about so if you can't find seating, try your luck on the second level. \u00a0It gets a little crowded around lunch time but I think its worth the wait. \u00a0Eat on.",

Quaint. \u00a0Picked the table at the end of the staircase in front of the window - private and some sunlight! \u00a0The Happy Hour drink specials are taped onto the table...we are kicking back in an old wing chair. \u00a0Sign at the front says \"Seat yourself - your server will be with you.\" \u00a0Right when I wonder if anyone will know we are hidden in the corner, the server came over to give us the menu. \u00a0  After studying the menu, we decided we should try their burger and something in the breakfast menu. \u00a0We decided on the Carlito's Frittata and the mushroom burger. \u00a0I tried the Trumer Pils - it's from Berkeley and although light, it's not bad. \u00a0They also carry Wyder's Pear Cider - that was my 2nd drink w/ a splash of OJ (it's a poor man's \"mimosa\"). \u00a0  Back to the food - the burger wasn't bad BUT the fries are FANTASTIC! \u00a0Damn, it was SO perfectly crunchy on the outside...just yummy w/ the side of barbecue sauce we requested. \u00a0My frittata was not what I had expected - it was more like a semi-scrambled eggs w/ slices of tomatoes and a few fresh basils on top. \u00a0It's light, not bad - again, just not what I expected.  Our server was very nice and attentive and not over bearing. \u00a0Two unisex bathrooms - the one I used was large and very clean.

They have good coffees, a pretty extensive food menu, happy hour beers for those middle-later portions of the day, and a pretty swell vibe. It's a little on the small side, so if you're meeting someone for the first time (whether it's a business or personal thing), you'll have a pretty intimate gathering. If that doesn't freak you out, you're golden.   And if you're meeting someone who's driving from outside they city... say San Jose, for example, it's really easy to find if taking the 280 to 6th street.

Don't you think?  Whatever you choose to call it, The Brickhouse has been there for me through thick and thin. It's nothing fancy, but that's what I love. I can't tell you how many times I have worked all day on school projects only to find myself starving and too tired to cook. I can always rely on The Brickhouse for a tasty, filling meal - all within a cozy, eclectic atmosphere.  My favorite is the Chicken Brie sandwich, hands down. Oh. My. God. If this isn't the most heavenly sandwich I have ever had the pleasure of devouring, I don't know what is. The combination of chicken, brie, pesto, red onions, and fresh apples (yes that's right, fresh apples) is an all around palette pleaser. The sweet crunchiness from the apples is what sets this sandwich apart from all others. As a side, I highly suggest ordering the garlic fries. They are served with a tasty chipotle aioli dipping sauce which I am addicted to. If that stuff was sold in bottles, I'd buy the whole lot!  The Brickhouse is also a great spot for a laid back breakfast or brunch. You can't go wrong with the Vanilla Bean French Toast. Oh, oh! There's also a question of the day, and if you answer it correctly you get 25 cents off your coffee. I'm not a coffee drinker, but trivia junkies like myself always appreciate opportunities where we can show off our knowledge of useless, random facts.  Now, you may be wondering, \"If you love this place so much, why give it 4 stars and not 5?\" Well, my little yelpies, it all boils down to two simple factors - consistency and service. The service isn't bad by any means. Most of the people are awesome! It's just that the service and quality tend to fluctuate. Sometimes the staff is AMAZING and other times I feel borderline ignored. I guess it just depends on who's working. I've had ONE bad meal here, but that's easily forgiven because everyone has their off nights.  That being said, all the people I have taken to The Brickhouse have fallen under its spell, especially when they discover Happy Hour. I'm not a big drinker (I usually drink the cranberry lemonade), but I suggest going on Monday - pomegranate margs - enough said. You can thank me later, or yell at me - depending on how much you drink and how bad your hangover is on Tuesday morning! (;",

My ribs were fine but lacked any sort of bite. I ate the whole order but they were just sorta 'eh'. Also, my root beer was flat. No bueno. My date's burger was overcooked and (oddly enough) featured a round patty on a square bun. Everyone knows that throws off the bun/meat ratio per bite! They need to either make the patties square to match or switch to round buns.  Service was solid, especially since there was a constant stream of people in the place. The inexpensive prices, friendly service and great looking happy hour is enough to convince me to give Brickhouse another shot next time I'm in the hood and looking for a bite to eat or some drinks.

On to things I think are good and even great. - Beer selection. \u00a0My boyfriend really enjoys the variety of beers they have to offer. \u00a0I like picking a nice cocktail off of their pretty decent list. \u00a0  - Other salads. \u00a0The Thai-style salad they have has a nice sauce, delicious chicken (maybe I paid to add this--can't remember) and has noodles on the bottom which i really enjoyed.  - Both the veggie burger and the regular burgers are good.  - Breakfast is SOLID. \u00a0My bestie had a scramble and loved it. \u00a0I had bacon and eggs--(bacon is a bit fatty and greasy but that can come as no surprise, I suppose, but I've had better). \u00a0Their real winner is their pancakes. \u00a0DELICIOUS. \u00a0I will get those every time I go from here on out.

Our food was brought out pretty quickly, and I was disappointed to see my smoked salmon was more like cooked salmon, and it was dry and extra fishy tasting. It was on top of focaccia bread, and the eggs were perfectly poached. The potatoes were okay. I was starving and ate the whole thing minus some of the salmon. I wish I went with the pulled pork instead since my fish was so dry and hard.  Everyone's burgers looked good, the garlic fries were delicious! Their caesar salad also looked amazing with anchovies and garlic bread on top.  Service was lacking towards the end, even though it had emptied out.

Started with some celebratory, welcome to SF, happy birthday drinks. CP enjoyed a mimosa. I had a bloody mary. Once every two years I'll have a bloody mary only to be reminded that I don't really care for them. Sigh. oh yeah, my bad.  CP and I both ordered burgers. Mine had a fried egg on it. I asked for grilled onions but that didn't happen. Both burgers were fine. My onion rings were pretty good but there was only a few on the plate. The burger greens (lettuce, tomato, pickle) all looked frighteningly soggy and wilted. I pushed those off. blech.   The bathroom was very dark. Why? Why would they do that.  Clearly this wasn't the worst lunch I have ever had and I may be particularly sensitive since I didn't want to be here in the first place but I was still very unimpressed.

My western scramble was overdone. Egg was way overcooked.  My son's sausage and eggs were good. Eggs were fluffy and sausage was tasty.  Overall it was ok, nothing that inspires you.

Theyre covered in cheese (cheddar?), then with pulled pork, then with jalapenos and blue cheese. OMG, they were yummy. I would recommend eating these when theyre hot still since the ones I ate when cold were a tad soggy. The pulled pork was sweet, but not too sweet and since the jalapenos were cooked, they weren't too spicy.

I like the decor - it's different, rustic, slightly random and schizo, and very visually stimulating so there's a lot to look at and keep you occupied. We sat in a window table which is nice if you want to be separated from the main floor/dining area.   We got the wagyu burger and salmon scramble. Both were good. Burger was really tasty. Salmon scramble definitely hearty with a good portion of salmon. Potatoes were tasty too. They have freshly squeezed fruit juices (said the server). I had a latte too and it was a large and hot cup - nice.   Service was really friendly. For a Saturday brunch, it wasn't crowded and we were seated immediately which is great when you are hungry. If you drive, there's a lot of metered street parking.",

The food is mostly good, but it is definitely hit or miss between entrees and even the same thing on different days. Here's some of my pros and cons for my friend the Brick House:  Pros: Cool old timey feeling. Wood, stairs, big chairs. Try to sit upstairs and pretend you are a queen/king staring down at your subjects as they wait in line. The Sassy Spinach and Asian Sesame salads are both quite good. Filling but not totally unhealthy tasting. Onion rings are bomb. Beer on tap and wine by the glass - my coworkers and I occasionally LOVE this.  Cons: Gets very crowded right past lunch hour and can be very awkward as you try to maneuver around and find a spot. Come at 11:50 and you will be just fine. Otherwise prepare to wait in a long ass line and then creep around for a table. Kind of expensive for the quality of the food. Why is the menu in that weird cursive that is impossible to read?? The veggie amore sandwich is really, really, unapologetically bad.  Haven't been here for happy hour but I should. it's a fun vibe that I enjoy if I come at the right time and order the right thing (plus some booze).",

Parking wasn't hard to find but then again, I wasn't the one driving! \u00a0Walked in and the upstairs wasn't open so we just grabbed a seat downstairs.  They were offering the regular menu and the happy hour menu which was good cuz sometimes, happy hour items just never seem to make me full, or maybe it's because I'm fat.. We started off with drinks. I ordered the Happy Hour cocktail. The Buckaroo? It's almost like a Mojito but used basil? That was OK. Nothing special and not enough alcohol for me...   We chose to order the: Fried Calamari ($9 - $2 during happy hour = $7!) Jalapeno poppers ($8 - $2 = $6!) Baked Rigatoni and Cheese on reg menu ($8)  They were all pretty damn good! My fav? Calamari and rigatoni and cheese. I love it when places make mac and cheese using penne or rigatoni.. The cheesey gooey goodness inside those tubes just makes the best of the dish! Calamari, piping hot, crispy, oily served with chipotle aioli. YUM! So good! The jalapeno poppers were good. REALLY hot. Vincent, I know you were trying to man up and NOT spit out that piping out jalapeno popper with SUPER HOT cream cheese filling, but it was funny seeing how it's steaming in your mouth but you still didn't spit it out. haha The popper was good, but I think it was purchased then fried.. BUT still good.  The <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">restaurant.com</a> certificate was good if you order $45 worth but we weren't there yet! So Vincent orders a pasta dish for his lunch tomorrow.. It was the special for the night. Some kinda pasta with shrimp in a cream sauce. SMELLED SO GOOD. Vincent really wanted to just get a bite of it once it came but we were going to Humphry so he resist... until he went home atleast... Oh and thanks for saving me a bite! NOT!!  Definitely would come back again and get dinner or something cuz their pasta dishes were looking really delish!  THANKS VINCENT FOR HAPPY HOUR!",

You might even call them \"cozy\" - if you consider tightly packed tables surrounding a long, communal table \"cozy\". The wood-paneled walls add to the warmth. And, you can always catch the Giants games here. Yup, I really do think I'm starting to like this place.  It doesn't hurt that the food is good. I've had their Big Ass Burger (love the name) twice, and was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Their happy hour gets you discounts off the bar menu and certain beers and cocktails (ask for the happy hour menu when you come in). The only downside is that the servers get really busy here, so if you're in a rush you might have to flag them down.  Parking isn't terrible during happy hour since most folks are leaving SOMA during that time.  I just realize I didn't insert even ONE \"Brickhouse\" song reference. I must be getting rusty. *shrug*",

We were immediately seated by the bus boy and helped by our waiter who was friendly and knowledgable. My hub ordered a german beer, turkey burger with garlic fries and he said it was alright. I tried some of the turkey burger and would say that it tasted like it was a previously frozen patty.  I had a caesar salad and a bowl of tomato soup that came with garlic bread and unfortunately everything I ordered had an overwhelming amount of cheese on it, which I was not aware they were going to put cheese on everything. In a nutshell the meal was tasty but a hassle due to picking out the cheese off my meal.  I also decided to treat myself to a brick house buttered rum and it was the best alcoholic concoction I've ever had. The drink wasn't too sweet or too strong it was just right and if you foodies ever come to BC I highly recommend it.  Overall I'd highly recommend this joint for lunch, dinner or cocktails in the evening. The prices seem to be alright and the service is friendly and fast.",

Lots of tech guys and gals come here for lunch/meetings -Delicious Arnold Palmers made with a floral-y tea -Roast beef sandwich with side salad is spot-on.

I've had the chicken and turkey and they are fantastic -Burgers (for me at least, I'm not adventurous in this area) are mediocre; missing a certain je ne sais quoi that I can't put my finger on. -Meatloaf tastes like mom's but with a New American twist; sometimes they have cheddar mashed potatoes, sometimes sweet potatoes, veggie changes.

Brickhouse was not happy with my review...this is what they sent me...now \u00a0I have changed my review to 1 star Hi D d.,  Kim here, from the Brickhouse Cafe. \u00a0Just a quick note, all of our fresh herbs are washed by the kitchen before they make there way to the bar for our fresh drinks. \u00a0  We take all of our reviews very seriously and I was just wondering if there something else you were unhappy about aside from not being at the restaurant you thought you were at? \u00a0A 2 star rating is just a step beyond, well...pretty awful, and I didn't quite grasp the reason for it. \u00a0I'd love to hear any additional comments you have so that we can do our best to improve upon them.  I look forward to your response.  All the best,  Kim,  Thank You for the message, the plant was at the bar in front if me, did you wash the plant before you brought it out and started making my drink? The pieces of mint were so small I had to keep spitting them out would you like me to add that to my review...fyi I couldn't even finish my drink and was charged and I didn't complain. Word of mouth is the best form of advertisement.   Try a drink at Grand Pu Bah or Olive and then ask why I only gave your establishment one star.",

My friend ordered the spinach salad no olives, which came out as a salad with no artichokes.   Service was...missing. I think our waiter was also the bartender, so when he said, I'll be back in 1 minute he really meant, see you in 20. It was impossible to get refills and we were relying entirely on other servers to get what we needed.   My friend was off the game so she really wanted to get going, but we couldn't find our waiter. Finally we tracked down someone else and got the check, but then we had to wait entirely too long for someone to take it. So I took it up to the register, he ran over apologizing and rang it up, but when he handed it back to me I opened it only to find he had passed me someone else's bill and credit card... free credit card?!

It was truly wonderful, albeit just fried eggs, roasted potatoes and chicken sausages and english muffins.

Rather than hold up the people behind me, I told her to \"just skip that\"..She went and told the chef of my request, and lo and behold the extra egg arrived but the added egg charge was not added to my bill.

(Ironically, I kinda like those.)  My friend ordered the pork chop, and though ample, it too left him wanting... not wanting more, just wanting.   The lemonade was from a powder, and to me, the layout of the place just seemed off.  All in all, Brickhouse ain't bad, but it's not something to make a trip for, either. \u00a0  By the way, I didn't intend to have a margarita that night, but given that the lemonade was chalky, I went ahead and added a few shots of Petron from a flask I had in my pocket. \u00a0Much better! \u00a0This is to say that I don't know if Brickhouse has good margaritas, but I certainly know how to make lemonade when life gives me lemons.",

In a city that's so self righteous about being healthy I feel like it's pulling teeth to get them at so many breakfast places where you don't sit down. Their bagel sandwiches are good and they come out pretty quickly. Their coffee is good also.  Lunch options are varied and there are tons of veggie options.  They've also got a great bar and a good amount of beers on tap--including some nice local surprises.

The Big Ass Burger, Chicken &amp; Brie sandwich, and their garlic fries are all fantastic. But what's the point of great food if you're treated poorly, ignored, or met with surly demeanor?   My latest experience was standing at the register to place a to-go order while the server sorted through credit card receipts... Place one here. Stick one there. Circle a total on this one. Shuffle. Re-sort. Done. Wander away with a sigh. Leaving me standing there, still. A waitress then approached, never made eye contact, and didn't seem interested in helping either. That's when I gave up and left empty handed.   I find it funny that in my time waiting there I had time to read and then reread their note on the register about requiring a $10 minimum on credit card transactions because \"the economy the way it is and these transaction fees are killing us!\" and found it funny. I'd figure patrons wandering out the door unhelped would be more of an issue.   This was one instance of 4 years worth of experiences with Brickhouse. Some experiences have been great, and the food, like I've said, is really quite wonderful.

Well, it all started with my father, and my father's experimental combinations involving canned goods and the spice rack. I won't go into detail but let's just say you can do some really interesting - and entirely legal - things with over-the-counter spices and canned spinach.   Now while Dad's efforts with foodstuffs were not always properly appreciated by his offspring, his hash was deservedly legendary and quite delicious. And now, because of that legacy, I am compelled to order corned beef hash if it shows up on the menu. And judge it by a very high standard.   Brickhouse's hash is lovely. The meat is shredded, not cubed, and wonderfully salty. It's breakfast comfort food at it's finest and I would happily return for more. The rest of breakfast was fine but not inspired.   Service was kind of inattentive, but not unkind. I would put this place on my list if I lived or worked closer, but it's not a 'go out of my way' winner.",

I came here for dinner Saturday evening and impressed by the first food item that appeared on the table -- the complimentary bread. \u00a0Fresh out of the oven, this baguette was so piping hot my fingers could barely hold it in place as I cut it in half. \u00a0When I pushed gently on the crust it made that fresh crackling noise and when I finally cut open the bread an eruption of steam accompanied the exposure of a delicate, chewy center. \u00a0The bread was served with an herb butter but the herb flavor was very subtle. \u00a0  We tried the jalepeno crab dip appetizer, and I was impressed once again. \u00a0I so often get served seafood that is improperly marinated/seasoned, resulting in this unpleasant fishy aftertaste that makes me crave dessert afterwards. \u00a0That was not the case at Brickhouse. \u00a0The crab was prepared with the perfect amount of lemon juice and jalepeno and was not disgustingly mayonnaise-y as often is the case for dips. \u00a0To finish it off, the dip was topped with parmesan and bread crumbs and served with 4 slices of focaccia. \u00a0Heaven!  My friend got the Frenchy burger, served on a nice plump roll and topped with an over easy egg. \u00a0He was quite pleased. \u00a0I ordered the seared ahi tuna sandwich, which once again, had the right amount of acidity to counteract the potentially disgusting fishy flavor. \u00a0To my personal delight, the flavors of the asian marinade described on the menu were not very prominent and my only complaint was that the sandwich could've used twice the amount of fried onion and the chipotle aioli could've had more of a kick. \u00a0Both entrees were served with french fries that deserve a solid 4.5 stars - perfectly deep fried, not too dry, not too greasy. \u00a0  Not only that, the service was excellent. \u00a0Our server was very friendly and our waters were refilled 6-7 times during the course of our meal. \u00a0My only complaint about this place is that their sandwiches and burgers are $1-2 overpriced, but that's SOMA for you. \u00a0Still a solid place overall. \u00a0Thanks Scoutmob for directing me to Brickhouse Cafe!",

As if the food wasn't bad enough, the service sucked. Ordered a tea and told to serve myself at the bar (pitcher of tea on top). So I helped myself and had some of the help yell across the the restaurant for pouring my own tea. You would have thought I just stole some money from the register.  I don't give bad reviews for shitty service because we all have bad days. I don't mind bad service as long as the food is great. So these guys get 1 star for crappy food.  Save money and go to McDonalds instead.",

Parking was easy (although we got a $74 ticket for not paying the meter on a Sunday *thumbs down*) luckily so we were able to hop right in. The restaurant was pretty full (we arrived around noon) but there was only a 10 minute wait which was fine for us since it gave us some time to look at the menu since it was our first time. I ordered one pancake, one egg and a side of bacon with a vanilla latte. I loved everything I ordered! The eggs had a really great flavor and were cooked perfectly, the bacon was superb and the pancake also had great flavor and was just the right size. I live for a good vanilla latte and Brickhouse didn't disappoint, although my only wish was that the mug was a wee bit bigger because I was still yearning for more to the point that I almost ordered a second one. My friend ordered the cowboy combo with a pancake on the side. I tasted a few of the potatoes from my friend's plate and they were spectacular. The seasoning used was really good and gave the potatoes a nice kick so I'd say they were probably some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  Overall, I would go back to Brickhouse and recommend it to others.

I had the Small Ass Burger (seriously that is what it is called on the menu) it was very good, very flavorful and moist and it was overcooked slightly. The fries were also very good as well, they has a light crisp to them that did not make them feel greasy or heavy. The staff was so friendly and kept checking to make sure that we had everything that we needed.   Also provided coffee while you wait.",

    "review_text": "An eclectic Western-ranch themed eatery worth a stop in before a Giants game for some pre-game action but make sure you have some extra time to spare because it might take a little longer.   Stopped by for happy hour before heading onwards to AT&amp;T Park and it was pretty packed when we walked in the door at 6pm. A little confusing to wait to be seated when there weren't any staff at the door acknowledging the various groups of folks lingering around the entrance. Eventually we got seated at the communal table by the bar. \u00a0   They have various happy hour specials (3-7pm) including select pints for $4 and $6 bites like chicken wings, fish tacos, and fried calamari. We opted for the pitcher and nachos combo - a quintessential pre-game combo for $23. Brickhouse's take on nachos uses potato chips and pulled pork with blue cheese, cheddar, jalape\u00f1os, and pico de gallo. The chips stayed crunchy and there was a nice balance of flavors with \u00a0the pulled pork and cheeses against the jalape\u00f1os and salsa. Washed down with some Lagunitas and we were all set for the ballgame.   Our server was absolutely lovely but you could tell she was swamped and overwhelmed. In fact, the whole place was severely understaffed for the sudden mass of humanity before the game. Still, I would love to come back to try their burgers. Till the next game day I suppose.

So today I went in with some friends and a little one.   I got the veggie chili and grilled cheese sandwich. UGH! bad move on the chili and worse move on the grilled cheese sandwich - it had 2 diff kinds of flavorless cheese with hot house tomatoes and pesto. I should've ordered the burger - that looked good.   The little guy got the peanut butter and banana sandwich with fries. Good thing he 'shared' some of his sandwich with me - it was delicious with a little jam.   Because sharing is caring, at least that's what we tell the 4 year old.   Our waiter was nice, maybe a little clueless taking away an iced tea mid way through the meal like he's done with it, but he was at least interesting and a good guy. He brings it up to 3 stars. My guess from the crowd is that other items on the menu are better, just don't order the grilled cheese with pesto. Does that sound good to anyone?",

    "review_text": "Feel free to recommend Brickhouse to looking for a good burger and pleasant service, whether or not it's baseball season. Our server was excellent, keeping up with our party of three despite our varying arrival and departure times in the midst of pre-Giants game business.   The Brickhouse Wagyu Beef burger had motivated me to recommend this as our meeting spot. Honestly, this burger list (blog?) of mine may never be completed. Anyway, a premium half-pounder with cheddar and bacon absolutely should've hit the spot. For $17, I was expecting a lot, but not all of my expectations were met. The only \"big-ass\" part of the burger was the amount of cheese, which was plentifully gooey.   The patty was a little overcooked, which may have prevented me from tasting its unique flavor. Although let's be honest, their Wagyu/Kobe claim is bogus. Read a detailed review on Forbes about the hype. That kind of beef heritage doesn't have proof of 100% compliance in lineage and methods.  My friends ordered the french dip (Cow Tipper Dip) and fish &amp; chips. The french dip was good for a french dip, though I've never been a fan; she thought it was quite good, however, and to her point the meat was moist but not runny. The fish and chips also got a sign of approval, with garlic fries subbed in for just another dollar...good call on his part.  Brickhouse's biggest selling point to me before games, or any time, is its low beer prices: many bottles and drafts are in the $3-4 range. Cheap beer and great service can't be beat. I think I might come back for brunch before a day game.",

    "review_text": "With my beef ban officially over, my first weekend of \"freedom\" was unexpectedly beef heavy. \u00a0After going to Burger Bar on Friday night, I found myself at Brickhouse for my friend's birthday dinner. \u00a0Even though they offer several beef alternatives, I had to give their burger a shot considering a whole sheet of the menu was devoted to it. \u00a0(side note: since that weekend, I haven't had much beef...talk about overkill...).  Like Burger Bar, Brickhouse gives you the option of tailoring a burger to your liking (albeit with less options). \u00a0Given that I already made my own the night before, I decided to give my brain a break and go with one of theirs so that I could try something different. \u00a0I ended up ordering the Frenchy Burger (served open face with a fried egg, grilled pancetta, swiss and chipotle aioli) and quickly realized that it was fairly similar to what I had at Burger Bar. \u00a0Whoops. \u00a0If nothing else, my taste buds are pretty consistent. \u00a0  When our plates were served, I noticed that my burger looked a little dark, but I didn't think too much of it since we were trying to make sure everyone got the dish they ordered. \u00a0Taking that first bite though, it was pretty obvious why it was so dark - overcooked. \u00a0I ordered my burger between medium rare and medium, but I ended up getting it a touch past medium well instead. \u00a0Now, I generally don't send plates back (can't remember the last time I did, if ever), but I thought about it this time. \u00a0Seeing as how my friends around me were complaining about the same problem though, I figured there wouldn't have been much of a point.  Being overcooked, a lot of the burger's juiciness and flavor were gone, and it didn't even taste like it had been seasoned very well. \u00a0The egg was nice and I liked the pancetta flavor, but it was just way too salty and overwhelmed everything else. \u00a0The sides didn't do much for me either. \u00a0The truffle mashed potatoes didn't taste like truffle, and the fries and onions were average - not great but not bad. \u00a0I thought the truffled fried polenta bricks were decent though.  The best part of the meal for me was the upstairs loft where we were seated; given the large size of our party (roughly 20 in total), it was nice to have the area to ourselves. \u00a0The food was just too disappointing for me though - overcooked (my friend's ribs had some serious char) and relatively bland. \u00a0I see people have said some nice things about their brunch, so maybe that would be worth checking out one day, but I don't think I need to come back for dinner. \u00a0Even though they might be cheaper than Burger Bar, I'd rather pay more for something I like better (or go to Serpentine for a comparable price and a better burger). \u00a0TWO AND A HALF stars for the food, but rounding up since I liked the vibe of the place. \u00a0[EDIT]: \u00a0Scratch that, upon further consideration, I'm thinking two stars is more appropriate.",

Since we had to spend a minimum of $50 we started off with the calamari and chicken wings. Make a note, the server had handed us a happy hour menu in addition to the regular menu in which we made the appetizer selections off of. We found out later that we did not in fact get the happy hour prices for these said appetizers, we were also too lazy to complain and just wanted to leave when we finished eating. Furthermore, when the wings came, they seemed like they were drenched in ketchup and bbq sauce. I have yet to really find a place with some decent wings that I would care to revisit. One day I will find some really great bbq wings in the city, but until then... Calamari was nothing to swoon over as well. I could have sworn some of the pieces didn't even contain any meat at all. I think some of them were just breading molded into little circular shapes and fried.   For the main course I settled on the chicken and brie sandwich. (crisp apples, red onions, and basil pesto aioli on foccacia bread) On paper the sandwich just sounds really good, but reality begs to differ. I'm not that super picky now, but the sandwich was pretty disappointing. At least I had the garlic fries to munch on the side, which I admit were pretty decent if not good. \u00a0In addition, we had ordered off their \"specials\" for the day. We asked the server how it was before ordering and he just kinda looked at us like ehhhhhhhhhhh. He said they usually get to taste the specials of the day, but for some odd reason he didn't try this one on this particular day and therefor could not speak for it. Well well well, we figured we'd just try it since it did sound good. Like before though, what looks good on paper is one thing. Now we know why the server gave us the face to begin with. The end.",

There is also an extensive alcohol/drink list that you can too easily get lost in. With your beer, why not try the veggie sandwich or vegan burger! Both are good sizes and not too heavy!.I think the sandwich actually wins out taste-wise, but sometimes you just gotta have a burger. I've seen fries but have only had the side salad which is adequate but really, only mixed greens with olive oil and balsamic vinegar? But the fries, if someone at your table gets them and you are forced to dine in their presence...look pretty good! Probably not as good as Source fries or the yummy sweet potato fries you can get at Barney's, but still pretty good!  In sum, warm, cozy, tasty, and friendly service.

Coffee was 'meh', and its a very small cup.   The food was decent as far as breakfast fare goes, with the highlight being the bacon which was great. I've had the biscuits and gravy and corn beef hash on my two visits, and both are fine.

After visiting you today for lunch I feel so disappointed. \u00a0  You know how when you run into a long lost friend who used to have a great sense of humor, dress well, and was fun to be around...and now she's a crack whore? \u00a0That's how I feel about Brickhouse.   I've been eating here for about 4 years now. I have been in a few times when the service was not the best, but I gladly returned because the food was great, atmosphere is awesome, \u00a0and it is soooo convenient.  I read a YELP review of Brickhouse the other day about how bad the service was. I thought, this person must just be a pain in the ass, the service couldn't have been THAT bad. \u00a0To you Ms. or Mr. Yelper whom \u00a0I thought was a 'pain in the ass', I stand corrected...everything you said was true. \u00a0  When we arrived today, there was only ONE other person in the restaurant. \u00a0Out of 6 employee's walking around, none of them greeted us, told us we needed to order at the counter, or acknowledged we existed. \u00a0We sat for 10 minutes before someone, as they were walking out the door told us to go order at the counter. \u00a0  When our food arrived, my burger tasted like fish, and my friends \"big salad\" was a side salad at best. \u00a0When we told the server he looked at us blankly like he was a zombie, and said in a monotone voice, 'I'll get you more greens\". Came back and dropped the plate on our table and just walked away. \u00a0   It was if we were being served by the \"Twilight\" cast. \u00a0  So Brickhouse, I say this to you. \u00a0I love you to death and don't want to end our relationship, but its gone too far. \u00a0Your service, your food, your prices....you got's to go ! \u00a0When there are options like \"Holy Grill\" three blocks away, you don't have the option to behave like this. \u00a0  I will miss you. (tear streaming down face) Don't worry you will survive as long as there are hungry Giants Fans and desperate office lunch meetings at your place. \u00a0I hope one day we can be friends again.",

    "review_text": "Oh Boy. I was excited to have a big juicy burger between my hands, dripping down the side of my mouth. All day it was all I could think about. Alas, Brickhouse you disappointed me. The menu *looks* great. I was torn between ordering the wild mushroom burger with Cheddar instead of Swiss, or the Apple &amp; Brie sandwich. I ended up getting the burger, cooked medium, and asked for a side salad instead of fries (just to be spontaneous).  As soon as the plate hit the table, I saw there was a problem: round patty on a square (more rectangular) bun! Who does that? It *looked* really good so I of course devoured it. When there were about 2 bites left, I decided to just ditch the bun because it wasn't working for me, and realized that my patty was cooked to well-done, not medium. The salad was just simple greens tossed in balsamic vinegar, olive oil and sea salt. Simple, yet for some reason delicious.  Our waitress was very nice, though. I liked the fact that she knows what the specials du jour are, and makes it a point to say that it's \"not that great.\" Ha ha, I appreciate the honesty.  Just to point out: parking is great, metered spots are open all around the block here (granted it was 6:30pm on a Wednesday). Great little spot to come eat before a show at AT&amp;T park...just a 10-15 min walk from there (depending on how fast you can walk).",

Starting off with onion rings was the perfect way to initiate dining. We warmed up our tums with their crispy deliciousness.   We ordered the beef pot pie and pesto pasta with chicken as our entree. Spencer really liked his pot pie and although I wasn't completely sold on the pasta, it was a much better choice than the veggie burger I had last time.   Brickhouse is a great place to go for happy hour with $3 draft beers and $2 off bar bites. I'm not certain I would recommend a full meal here only because there's nothing that I've tasted that would leave me dying to come back. The prices are pretty darn high on some of the meals and although their portions are hefty, the quality doesn't quite warrant that.   I will say that a good friend of mine has had the veggie sandwich here and she emphatically claims that it's amazing. That may be a good place to start if it's your first time eating here. I was really close to ordering it but at the last minute changed my mind (kinda wish I had gone with my gut instinct).   The ambiance is still a driving likability factor here and continues to win me over.",

It had the texture of a really good tuna melt filling but with crab. A yummy spread on some warm Focaccia bread. I ordered the special, house caught king salmon (apparently just caught by the owner himself on a trip to Alaska) with a Cajun rub over crab mashed potatoes. The salmon was fresh and well cooked and the potatoes were still chunky which meshed well with the crab stuffing. my only suggestion would be to add some veggies to lighten up the dish. My date ordered the Rib-eye and it was also cooked very well. It came with truffle mashed potatoes that was actually a scalloped potato gratin but went well with the dish none the less.   I definitely recommend this place if you're in the neighborhood. Seems like a good spot for a small dinner party.",

Right off the bat, although the waitress was sweet, she was not on top of her game. Definitely slow service. We wanted to start on drinks first, and it took her a long while to come back to take our orders...just for drinks. C'mon a girl just wants her drink! haha  Anyways, so when it came on deciding what to eat, being that i love salads, i decided on getting the Smoked Seafood Salad. I dunno if its because im such a critic for salads, but when i saw it, i noticed the fish was really dry. took a bite...not impressed. actually disappointed. another friend ordered ribs and it \"looked\" good, and i stuck my fork in it thinking the meat would just fall right off the bone, NOPE. \u00a0i guess im spoiled? but i dont usually see ribs so tough and chewy. One friend ordered the \"Kobe\" burger? it wasnt too bad, but ive definitely had better burgers at BBQs that my friends would throw.   Topping off the review of the food, so my friend bought a bday cake for me and asked one of the waiters at the beginning to put it in the frig. When the bill came, guess what was charged?! \"cake-slicing\" fee! wtf?! serious?! they never mentioned a fee for the cake nor did anyone slice the cake for us! that was ridiculous. so we disputed the fee and they took it off the bill. had they not, i think i wouldve gotten super upset....  overall, i gotta say, im probably never going back there again.  Update: I went again because the manager was kind enough to send me a complimentary gift certificate. I was very appreciative, but sad to say, I went there to try their brunch one sunday morning. I was again dissappointed.....food wasn't as tasteful as it looked (my over easy eggs, came with the yolk almost completely fully cook not having any yolk juice spill out). The service was slow and not very attentive. Sorry, but I gave it another chance, and I regret to say that will be my last.",

I've tried different kinds of burgers and a few diff sandwiches but a lot of it feels on the dry'er end. Even when I've ordered a med cooked burger.. the burger meat doesn't seem to have much flavor itself and never felt like a medium cooked burger, but that's just me. Aside from that I used to come here bc it had a nice sitting area for you and coworkers to eat when a lot of small restaurants are... well.. small.. in sf.",

I was not so impressed by the Bigass Burger because the burger was oily but not juicy, you know what I mean? I am sorry for saying this but I really think that the cook was cooking the burger patty with no sense of love. I mean, I had a better tasty juicy burger before that got a love from the cook.   Making a good burger is not really getting a good meat. Wagyu Beef for a burger? No, Thank you! I don't like the beef ground.  In my opinion, Wagyu Beef should not be ground beef, period. I like Wagyu Beef as a steak, not a burger patty.   I think cheap meat is fine for a burger.  I am talking about a burger place like Hall of Flame Burgers, Sam's and Hamburger Haven. They know what the juicy burger is.  Sorry but, the Bigass Burger did not \u00a0impress me much.  But I really like the breakfast menu, especially the Cowboy Combo! 9 bucks. 2 eggs, apple smoke bacon, nice roasted potatoes w/ english muffin was hit the spot! I must tell you that I had to have the egg scrambled. I usually order my egg over medium, but I don't know why I wanted to get my egg scrambled for a first time in a long time. But the egg was so fluffy but firm, in a good way, light but very flavorful nicely cooked.  My son had the French Toast w/ mascarpone cheese and caramelized apple, 9 bucks. It was another hit item. Really Good coffee in the original Brick House insulate coffee mug, 9 bucks! I got one and it's the best coffee mug I've ever had!  The coffee 5 star. The breakfast, so far 4 star. The Big Ass Burger, disappointed, 3 star. Decor, very clean toilet, 5 star. The service, decent-good, 4 star. The 9 bucks coffee mug, 10 star!!!! Total 4 star!  I'd like to come back for more breakfast menu.",

My boyfriend and I come here almost every single weekend, since I happen to live in Soma, and it never disappoints.   The biscuits and gravy, french toast, and classic bacon-and-eggs dishes are my favorites. I'm always tempted to try a milkshake, but end up getting too full.   The inside of the place is kind of like an antique shop in a farmhouse, but somehow doesn't feel cluttered. There are trees coming out from the middle of some of the tables, nice sky lights, and vintage armchairs here-and-there. If you're lucky, you can get a booth to the side.   This place is also full of surprises. Each weekend there's a different milkshake flavor of the day to look forward to. On Easter weekend, they put peeps in their mimosas. One random sunday, there was a badass violin player with a mohawk classin up the place with his soothing-earthy tunes.   The mimosas, quirky decor, and delicious breakfast menu keep my boyfriend and I coming back time and time again. Love this place!",

I got just the regular Big Ass Burger, the bf got the Mexican Burger (jalpeno patty, guac, salsa, etc on top) and the garlic fries. They were out of sweet potatoes so no sweet potato fries.   Neither of us could finish our burgers, which is saying something because I had just ran 12 miles. The patty was good, the fries (I just got regular) were nice and thick, but not tooo thick, and were the perfect consistency. My beer was yummy (I couldn't finish that, either!)

The decor was nothing to write home about; in fact, it felt rather busy and was ultimately not ideal.   Warm fresh bread greeted us shortly after we made arrangements for the main course. This, paired with herb butter, delighted our tongues for minutes.   As our group discussed gender, sexual expectations in society, and fat Val Kilmer, I was treated to a tasty Halibut complete with wild rice and broccolini--the wild rice was bursting with flavor and delicious. I enjoyed sipping my anchor steam while surveying the crowd, noticing whimsically outloud \"there are a lot of random folks here.\"  Other selections from our group:   The ravioli:Tasty, fresh and covered in browned sage butter.   The shrimp and grits: tasty but very spicy. A bit heavy for a full meal but great for leftovers.  The best part was the service: our friendly waitress was very hospitable and passed no judgment when we asked for more butter and to split the check 4 ways.   If only I was as wild as that rice.

I enjoyed the space- there is an upstairs- and very bar foodish atmosphere and it is bar food, yes!:) haha!  l want to try all the greasy things on their menu. \u00a0w/ a beer of course! Good service, can get crowded. There was live music when i was there for brunch- so i enjoyed that as well. If you are sitting close by the kitchen, the view is not so great but manageable.",

    "review_text": "I am really surprised this place doesn't have a better rating-Came here before the Giants game Saturday and I loved it.   Yes - it's small. Supply and Demand people.   Sounds like they have some awesome happy hour specials. We came in for breakfast and cocktails, had a delicious breakfast, although I had to ding them a start for bland breakfast potatoes, and for the service. We never went long without what we needed, but felt the service was awfully scattered, with waiters doing EVERYTHING for their tables. It seemed like a dedicated bartender would have been better, making drinks for all the tables and service those of us sitting at the bar as well, rather than a couple going without their check for 20 minutes because the server has to make a round of bloody Mary's.   But other than that, good food, good prices, pleasant experience, I can't wait to go back.",

    "review_text": "Ok ok ok ok. So (somewhat) like my ever so jerkish yet really good friend Abby A, I'm trynna not do the whole 3 star thing and live life on 2 extremes: either you got it, or you don't.  But BHC kinda rang it in there though, so Imma drop the fad for the moment and cave in JUST FOR THIS REVIEW..haha..maybe.   So the first time I went, there wasn't much of a crowd. I had the California Burger with a 'butt-load of fires' (i didn't name it..they did, PROMISE!) and the whole deal was real good! HOWEVER! This time? Not as great, but it was decent...not decent enough though to keep the stars intact.   First off, to the mad cute girl working the counter w/ the glasses..Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii. You earned the spot 1/2 a star by ya lonesome..HAHAHAHHAHA. Ok, back to the foo-...huh? WHAAAAT!? she was cute! and she didn't act mad snobbish and do that \"EW! Don't talk to me\" kinda look when I said hii to her...BOOYOW OHH-NOW!   Ok, the food. So as of recently I've been on this super soup hype. I looooooooooove me some soup! And most places I go to now, I'll do a soup for beginners. So BHC wasn't no different, except that I wasn't entirely hungry, and a soup would suit me just well.   Jambalaya: Well I'll be a baldy at a toupee farm!! I went on ahead and got me some of that goood ol' Jam-buh-lie-uh! Too bad someone was a a LIE-UH (liar) and the soup wasn't JAMMIN so to speak. Mad salty, and the seasoning was lightweight off.   Grilled Panini: This saved the place! It was a cheese and veggie panini grilled to gee golly goodness! Indeed it saved the sucky soup!!   Backed it up with fries and a lemon iced tea, and it did OK for a lunch outing, though I shoulda just stayed and enjoyed Microsoft FREE FOOD! hahahhaha!   So by now you'll realize:  \"Didn't he say he was gonna give it 3 stars? I see 2! Lijh is a LIAR!\"   So?   HAHAHAH!   Done!",

    "review_text": "The Brickhouse cafe is one of modern and eclectic tastes. Upon walking into the cafe, one feels right at home. The decor is eclectic and unique. It's a cafe with the homey feel and also bar feel, in a cozy way. The number of times my boyfriend and I have come there has never been a wait, unless there was a Giants home game but the wait was never more then 10-15 minutes.   The food here is simple, tasteful and comforting. Their menu ranges from burgers to Classic American food such as pot pie, beef stroganoff, ravioli, roasted chicken, fish and chips, various salads and more. There is always something for everyone and you can't go wrong with simple food made well. The staff is always welcoming and attentive and service is quick.   This place is a great option if you are seeking a good bite to eat before a Giants game they have specials for Giants games and their menu is creative with the Giants theme into their menu. The Giants menu focuses on specials on their bar food such as different burgers. They even offer a Wagu burger for $14 which is a great price and also flavorful, fatty, and delicious. This is one of the best that I have had in the city. I would recommend trying this burger above all the others.   Dinner- My favorite dish out of the whole menu is their pot pie. Their filling changes between chicken or turkey. The pie is made fresh when ordered, and comes piping hot to the table, with a side salad. The pie is flavorful, the filling is delicious and the crust is buttery and flakey. It comes it comes in a big serving so be prepared to be full!",

    "review_text": "I went to Brickhouse for happy hour this Friday, and I really loved it. \u00a0Great food, good service, and pitchers of beer -- what more could I ask for?  The Fried Calamari and Garlic Fries are great appetizers, and a huge plus is that the Chipotle Aioli on the side is amazing. \u00a0It is just spicy enough, and I was glad it came with both dishes.  The Grilled Chicken and Brie sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. \u00a0The apples add a lot of texture and flavor, and the brie is delicious! \u00a0And the sandwich goes along really well with the Tomato Bisque  It's a really cute restaurant, and I love places with great food and some character to match. \u00a0I would say it's definitely one of my favorite places in SOMA.",

    "review_text": "Tired of the ball park type of food? \u00a0Well, The Brick house Cafe is the place to stop before heading to the Giants game. \u00a0We were here last night to grab a bite before the game. \u00a0I am glad that we stepped in when we did because once we sat down and waited a bit before we got our menus, the crowd started to come.  This little cafe is very cute and unique. \u00a0It totally looks like a house in the inside. \u00a0Their appetizer plates are cute and unique. \u00a0It has different designs on it. \u00a0I just so happen to a picture that was sitting in front of me. \u00a0(See my pictures for reference) \u00a0What also caught my eye is when they brought the check out when we were done with dinner. \u00a0It was brought out in a pocket book. \u00a0Once again, very unique!.  So, here goes with my review about our drinks and food. \u00a0To start off, my bf and I both ordered an alcoholic drink. \u00a0He had the pomegranate margarita and I had the lemon drop. \u00a0The pomegranate margarita was pretty good, on the other hand, my lemon drop wasn't all that great, but the food made up for it.  I had the tomato bisque soup and the grilled chicken and Brie sandwich. \u00a0My bf had the Mexican burger. \u00a0The tomato soup was pretty good, I wished it was a bit on the hotter side. \u00a0The grilled chicken and Brie sandwich is to die for. \u00a0The chicken sits in between a foccaia bread spread ed with mayo pesto sauce with melted Brie cheese, a slice of apple and a slice of onion! \u00a0It was pretty awesome. \u00a0The sandwich also came with a side salad. \u00a0My bf said that his Mexican burger was pretty good. \u00a0It had a slice of melted cheese on the patty with avocado. \u00a0My bf said that burger patty had a kick to it because they put some jalapeno peppers in the meat.  We will be back ....hoping to try breakfast the next time.",
