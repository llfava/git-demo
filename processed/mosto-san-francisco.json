I met some friends at Mosto before having dinner nearby and we all ordered a drink and some tacos. After about 20 minutes everyone had gotten their drinks and tacos - I still hadn't gotten my beer. The waitress stopped by and said it was because they had to change the keg (understandable) so I cancelled the beer since we had to leave soon for dinner. Apparently the bartender didn't get the message and still poured the beer a few minutes later - another waitstaff brought it over to me and I told him I cancelled. He said oh ok, well you can still have it. I took the beer - not really even wanting it - and our blonde waitress came over and literally GRABBED the beer out of my hand and said in a horribly rude tone \"you cancelled that.\" Everyone at our table and nearby was pretty shocked by the incident and how loudly she yelled. I really want to like this place, but if their staff doesn't get a better attitude it will not survive.",

    "review_text": "Bright sun in the Mission. Strolling south on Valencia. Obviously in the mood for Latin fare--I call it love, others call it a disease.   My partner and I happen upon Mosto--instantaneous curb appeal: gaping plate glass windows and simple, inviting gray-green earthen facade. Friendly greeting by the hostess, immediately seated at a two-top in the sun. Ambiance perfect so far--expansive mural with scrawled messages opposite us, wooden floorboards, lights strung above. So far, excellent.   Cute female hipster servers all about, but none come to our table right away...or within our first 5 minutes of being seated. Minus a few points. Finally, a busboy brings us water, chips and salsa. The chips house-made chips are salty, crunch and fresh. The salsa amazes us--light brown-orange, not your everyday pico- or tomatillo-style offerings. \u00a0Slight tang and spice complement the chips well. Points regained.  When our server finally arrives we decide on a pitcher of red sangria--a drink we both adore--for $26, which is standard for trendy Hispanic places. Another 5 minutes or so elapses before it arrives, served in a 1 liter carafe. Most of the volume is ice, which is disappointing. The disappointment deepens when the sangria tastes like watered-down kool aid, with barely any alcohol burn or spice notes. Big minus here. $3 Tecate cans are not bad, but I would like to see 21st Amendment cans for $3 or $4--something that is probably not fiscally appropriate in the Mission. Oh well!  We decide on the tilapia and shrimp ceviche. For $13, the portion is smallish. I think the chef was going for something audacious and interesting, but failed: the dish has nectarines, which is nice, but they are muted by the lime. In fact, the prevailing flavor is not of the seafood nor the nuances of the fruit and vegetable combination, but of the lime juice. The dearth of flavor is definitely not worth the money.  The decor and vibe of this place is decidedly rad if you enjoy the upscale, hip Mexican scene, which both of us certainly do; however, our experience with the food, albeit small, is a major turn off. Would I return? Probably, if only to hang at the bar or outside with some beer.",

(Yes it's official, we're old!)   6) \u00a0Cheap Eats   The nopales taco and pork tacos were budget friendly ($1.50 each) but a bit bland and cold. \u00a0The tamale with chicken, green beans, and potatoes was ok flavorwise but very mushy in texture ($3). \u00a0(Next time would probably hit up El Toro instead.)  7) \u00a0M.W.A. (Menus With Attitude)  It warned us that \"Getting drunk will not get you laid\" and grouped the non tequila hard liquor options under \"Haters.\"  Haters gonna hate!",

Can't decide? try one of the cocktails featuring said tequila, or a few that don't and some non \u00a0alcoholics. The El Mosto classic margarita on the rocks and the Ferro's Little Devil with ginger beer are blackout good. Not since the Cadillac Bar and Grill before the Metreon took over have I had such a good one. They also do the blended styles a la Baja which are also tasty. You can have the eats over next door at Tacolicious and then continue the drinking here or you can just come here for drinks in their low lit swanky bar and back lounge area. So many tequilas, so little time",

Then I hit a certain age. Father Time, Mother Nature ain't got nothin' on you when it comes to being a [redacted]. For this reason, we thank the mocktail menu at Mosto. Yes, it's not as sexy as tossing back some craft cocktail and making cross-eyed googlies at the fine young thing in the painted-on jeans but after a while, a man gets tired of living that way. And as sung in 'The Lion King', the circle of life demands a return to that which was awesome as a child: grenadine. Yep, the stuff that Shirley Temples are made of are back and they're still delicious. I ordered the Moss Mocktail. It's a potent combo of Mexican Coke, lime and grenadine. Sounds simple. Tastes delicious. If the thought of one more ounce of poison floating through your liver makes you queasy, settle in for an expertly made craft mocktail, cool environment/vibe and decent playlist. Oh, and service. Attentive service that feels authentic is another reason to stop in... but first and foremost, get a mocktail. And call your mother. You never call.",

I don't remember which cocktail my friend ordered but it was tasty like a margarita on the rocks $9, and he liked his tamale $3 enough to order a second one. I just needed a snack, and the little taco really hit the spot.The drinks and food came out quickly. The service was great.

After reading all of the colorful and complex flavor notes listed, I want to try them all. At around $10 a swig though, I'll have to take my time. The flights are fun, but of all the tequilas I've tried here so far, my favorite is the Espol\u00f3n blanco. To my surprise, it's not very expensive in stores (~$20), so I am excited to stock the ol' wet bar with it. Get ready: one tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor!  The itty bitty, street-style tacos are much different than the ones served on the Tacolicious restaurant side, but just as t-lish. Though I would happily eat one million of both the bistec and cactus (with burnt cheese!), I usually settle for just a few. Each one is intended to be a bar snack, not a meal - but they will save your life as you're wasting away waiting for a table next door.

Yes, because of those nice old Spanish tiles you have in the main dining room, oh.. and the Paul Madonna's ink drawing of Delores Park, you got bump up from 4 to 5 stars.  Food: the appetizer are very generous in size, tacos are very large, two will be enough to fill me up, I don't think I can ever eat more than 3 in one sitting. The grilled squid Veracruz are so soft and juicy; the chicken enchilada are pretty good as well. The chip and salsa that they provided are good, the chips are thin which you can just nibble on all night long.   Drinks: Oh.. they have tequila. In fact, the tequila list is bigger than the food menu. I still think Tres Agave has a more comprehensive tequila list, still with just about 100 type of tequila on their list, they gave me another excuse to come down to Mission. Their margaritas are very good, not too sour, definitely recommended. $10 per cocktails and $30 for a small pitch of the same cocktails, as you can see, drinks are not cheap here, and it is where they will make their profit.  Decor: modest, comfortable. The only thing I didn't like is those metal stools. They have a few different spaces. As you come into the main dinning room through the courtyard space, you will see a small bar counter with a much larger open kitchen, high bench sitting along the glass window that open to the courtyard. There is a banquet room pass the bathrooms, and another parallel space to the main room that have a much better bar setup. I like the variety that it provides, also it just means the wait time is less. (I hope)  Service: Overall good. Food came really fast, and our drinks took a little while.  Just a couple of suggestions, if tequila will the be the premier alcohol, then maybe the wait staffs should be better trained about them. I asked for sangrita to come with my Herradura reposado, and our waitress didn't know what the heck I am talking about. Also the few tables next to the hostess has the most awkward set up, those short metal stools look so uncomfortable. They could easily do a couple of large communal table with bench seating.  By no mean, this is not a place that their food or drinks will blow your mind away, but they do have a winning combination of being well priced and exactly what I have in mind for a night out in the Mission.  Great new addition to the Mission casual fine dining scene.",

Their two house salsas are devine, an orange salsa (made with oranges?) is thick, citrus-y and mild and the green jalepeno salsa is killer, vinegar-y and with a bit of a kick. I had the nopale taco as well which said it came with queso, but not enough to comment. It was also very good, slow cooked, nice texture.   My boyfriend ordered their Agave flight which is a 2oz of tequila, mezcal and sotol each, bartender's selection. ya know. again, we were here for the tacos.   I've had the Mosto house margarita (on the rocks) and the Paloma which is a grapefruit based tequila coctail. Both good, fine...$9, maybe.   The ambiance is really chill, dim lighting wasn't so good for eating, but it makes everyone look good. I wouldn't try to roll through with a group larger than 4 to this place...if you get there early enough you can snag the 2 large top tables in the back of the bar, otherwise its tiny bar tables with a very narrow bench. Either way, don't get confused, you're here for that Pastor!  side: On NYE we did pop over to Tacolicious which I guess is an independent-ish venue (expanded menu, tacos are $3.95, taquitos for $9 etc), if I were just going out for drinks and a snack or a first time date I'd stick to Mosto.",

    "review_text": "Mosto is one of those places that always brings to mind the question, why do they bother having waitstaff serving the tables if they aren't actually going to help you? \u00a0At least it's not as bad as some places where they bark at you for going to get drinks at the bar. \u00a0The waitress was very good about bringing us drink menus and taking our first orders. \u00a0Afterwards we were only able to view her from a distance. \u00a0Yes, only a distance of a few feet but that's what made it even worse. \u00a0She was tantalizingly close yet just out of reach. And it was so loud it was hard to get a hold of her - no one really wants to shout down a waitress. \u00a0To get around this issue people chose to order drinks at the bar or would eye-stalk her and then jump up and grab her as soon as she got close. \u00a0Go to the bar. \u00a0It's hard to have a conversation with someone when they are eye-stalking the waitress.  The other annoying thing was that the waitress we had did not believe in bringing change. \u00a0Maybe she's used to a $5 tip on a $5 juice drink but that was not my intention. \u00a0Yes, I realize I could have asked for change. \u00a0But in the middle of catching up with friends, eye-stalking the table (thinking maybe she brought it and I just missed it) then eye-stalking the waitress who was never around it was half an hour before I got a chance then I felt like it was may be too late. \u00a0So lesson learned. \u00a0Leave exact change.  Other than the issues above, the place is nice. \u00a0Definitely a step up from the usual Mission bar. \u00a0I asked my friend, where did these people come here? \u00a0Where are the hipsters? \u00a0We came to the conclusion that after work Mosto draws the weekend/restaurant Mission crowd. \u00a0Older hipsters, better dressed. \u00a0Around 6 it's empty and easy to talk. \u00a0By 7 the place will be packed and you'll have to shout.",

How many shots of tequila do you need to feel invincible?? A WHOLE BOTTLE! \u00a0;D  I usually prefer my tequila in a margarita or plain in a shot glass with lime. \u00a0But Mosto is a place where you should do BOTH, not either. \u00a0Or you could just spend the extra $$ for a tequila flight -- 270+ tequila choices line up the wall and yes, you will have a hard time choosing so ask your bartender for recs. \u00a0We had the Fortaleza reposado and this is clearly top-quality tequila, it is spicy and rich, none of this Patron stuff. \u00a0Down that and follow it up with the housemade \"sangrita\" chaser or the escabeche \"pickle-back\" and you'll be saying: \"ay carumba! una mas por favor....\"  After you get the booze taken cared of, place an order for the $1.50 Al Pastor tacos. El senor will expertly carve the meat pieces off the rotating grill. He tops it off with grilled pineapple, radish and salsa. I realized that getting 4 isn't enough because they are so, so good! (but so, so TINY!)  Friday nights are packed! You'll be elbowing your way to the bar and fighting for the few coveted seats. But the drinks and bites are worth it. If you end up standing with your margarita in hand, look up at the ceiling and count the seemingly endless rows of mason jars that adorn it. There are 3000+ of 'em.

All of the tacos were delicious, but I will say they are filling. Remember that they come with two tortillas and you can make four tacos out of two.  I don't like tequilla, but I had the best drink there called flor de Jamaica. It was delicious and EFFECTIVE. Even their guacamole is delicious, but its a little over priced. \u00a0  Service is great, and people are friendly.

We chose to sit outside which on some aesthetic level was interesting with its softly etched mural of San Francisco including bits of inspiring and fragmented prose, long narrow channel flooded with cheap-looking, yet fun modern orange seats tucked under some industrial string lights. Let me belabor the point, that was the best part.   It took us a while to get greeted. The sangria was a glorified watered down icee with only enough alcohol to laugh at one of my partner's jokes (not okay). We split the ceviche which was just okay. It was bland with no complexity, the bits of nectarine added nothing-- it was overpowered by a wash of \u00a0lime juice. The chips and salsa were surprisingly the best part. The chips were perfectly salted and fresh with a golden hue that reminds me of the dried grass on Mt. Tamalpias. The salsa was fresh, tangy and had no chance in hell of staying full.  The food was overpriced for the quality and the service was slow. They did have a pretty nice tequila list-- expensive but good. So my suggestion would be come get a nice shot of tequila and eat some free chips and salsa.",

I did like their food, too--just make sure you take THEIR menu and not the menu from next door. They have separate registers and menus.  The place seems like a winner if you come at the right time of night, before it gets packed. Once the crowd fills the place up, you really feel the crunch as elbow room becomes a precious commodity. And I'm certainly not one to get in the way of people having a good time with liquor, but you will find it very difficult to eat anything if there or do a tasting if drunk people are bumping into your table or stool as they try to squeeze into the bar.  There is a TV on the back wall, but I wouldn't recommend this place for a baseball game on a Friday night. The high noise levels and tunnel-design of the bar will make following the action a bit difficult.  Nice bar though, I will be going back to do my tequila snob thing.",

Unlike Tacolicious' huge portion sizes, though, these are normal-sized, and I ate like 4 of them.  Good place to chill with a friend, have a drink, and get some tacos if you guys aren't going to hardcore rage and black out later that night.",

The first time tequila and I met, I belligerently chanted out loud (over and over again) how my friend was going to get some nookie nookie that morning...in front of the girl he just met....in front of table of 10+ people at 3 AM.  The second time at a Vegas Bachelorette party, my friend, the bride-to-be found me on the floor with two Palazzo security guards hovering over me snickering. Apparently, I was trying to get into our hotel room, gave up because I couldn't open the door so I ended up sprawled on the floor like a hobo. I think being on the right floor would have helped. FAIL. My friends now write \"Please Return to Palazzo Room #\" on my arm.\" No joke.  These days I avoid tequila like a plague. That was until hump day arrived. Looking for a post happy hour spot, Mosto was the closest place within walking distance to where we were according to my Yelp app. All I have to say is Yelp made me do it...again.  While sipping on my strong El Mosto ($9) margarita cocktail <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WMf6bHwvBftlZF-vUb6Cyw?select=9watN7YGQvcJu4XV6RT61A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/WMf6\u2026</a>, we couldn't help but notice a couple next to us giggling, making out, groping and fondling each other like high schoolers in a backseat of a Chevy at the drive-thru movies. Go, Go, Get it, Get it!   Tequila may not be my friend but it was definitely someone's BFF that night. *wink wink*  OTHER NOTES: *Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive staff *Long and very narrow space (seating for ~25 people) attached to Tacolicious *Over 300 kinds of tequila, mezcal (agave), and sotol (desert spoon plant) *Cocktails ($9) are made with house made syrups and sodas *Tacos ($1.50) and tamale ($3) are available for noshing *CC's accepted with no minimum *Parking blows",

    "review_text": "Probably the best gringo tacos I've ever had. Met up with Randy, Char, Elisa, and A.Lau while coincidentally running into Cat and Jor and their families.  7 dollars for a tequila shot and a tecate? Done deal, especially for a tough day of work \u00a0(all of us were having)  We ordered the 10 tacos special for 31 bucks. 3.10 a taco is pretty pricey for the Mission, but this is more of a fusion place. All tacos come with 3 sauces... spicy (habanero), medium (tamarind i think), and mild (green sauce). All sauces were good, and had different profiles so mix and match.  Short Ribs - these were cooked medium, and were super tender but you'd pretty much gobble up all the meat before even finishing the taco. The only thing that was bad about these were that they were under seasoned.  Carnitas - Surprisingly tender... closer to pulled pork though than carnitas. Not overly salty or crunchy, which was a bit disappointing, but the pulled pork flavor was great.  Beer/Tequila Chicken - amazingly flavorful. Almost like a mole taste to the beer/tequila chicken, but it had this nice sweetness from the beer and tequila. The chicken was ultra tender, and not overly salty.  Fish - this gives Nick's a run for its money. While this may be smaller, it is slightly cheaper than Nick's. It has a better batter flavor as well, though Nick's bests Mosto's with the guac and crispy tortilla.   Lengua - not one of the specials... but still amazing. Ultra tender cubes of beef tongue (don't worry, they shave off the taste buds), marinated so that it was slightly sweet but more salty. This was amazingly tender, as in yakitori japanese restaurant tender. You cannot get tongue cooked any better than Japanese style or Mosto style. My only gripe was the price tag (5 bucks). However, this is THE BEST lengua taco I've ever had... hands down... sadly its a weekly item only.  Choco Taco - pretty much a fancy choco taco... with the waffle being crispy and flavored similar to a Swedish pancake (vanilla flavored). The ice cream was deliciously creamy and dense (vanilla flavored as well) and the chocolate was dark chocolate. Almost tasted like a fancy Drumstick.  Overall an awesome place, with good deals. I would dock it 1 point for bringing tacos to the Mission but this place is different than your standard tacqueria. As many others have said, it does have a sexy atmosphere, and I would definitely recommend this place.",

Our friends had just ordered drinks 5 minutes ealier and the bartenders didn't warn them they were about to close--they just happily pocketed $20+.

The meat so really well seasoned on a warm tortilla and the pineapple added the perfect sweetness. My mouth is watering just thinking about them.

It gets thick and heavy and very loud so if you're planning a more intimate evening get savvy about when you're arriving or keep the group small.",
