I'm \u00a0really grumpy before I get my coffee, but the fine folks at Cafe Francisco are always friendly and quick. \u00a0  Their breakfast bagels are pretty tasty, and their coffee has plenty of caffeine. I usually have several cups (free refills!) every morning. \u00a0  Cafe Francisco is a good place to work, they have free wifi, and the booths are nice and big. However, only the tables by the front have power. The tables outside on the sidewalk are great on sunny days.  Their sandwiches are pretty good too, the roast beef is highly recommended.",

I ordered a vegetarian sandwich and noticed it was crunchy, though there was no reason for crunch. When I opened it up I was disgusted. The vegetables all had a bad mucousy sheen to them, the greens were black and soggy, and I was crunching on the mostly blackened avocado slices. Those vegetables looked like they'd been cut and laid out in the open for a week. I brought the opened sandwich to the person at the counter and told them it didn't look right. He just said, \"Sorry you didn't like it,\" and threw it away. That's it. I went home and was horribly, horribly sick for 3 days. So I lost three days of work over a bad Francisco Cafe sandwich.

Most of the restaurants / cafes in the neighborhood (by the Pier) are overpriced, have crappy food or more likely are both crappy and overpriced ~ as is usual for tourist trap destinations.  All the food here is very fresh (the first most important thing). The lunchtime salads, soups and sandwiches are very tasty, interesting combos, large portions and reasonably priced. Service is fast and efficient ~ also crucial for work time lunches (although sometimes grouchy--family stuff I think ; )  The Greek Salad and the Mediterranean Salad Plate are both large, fresh and rich in dolmas, feta, olives and the like...  My favorite lunch is the 1/2 sandwich // cup of soup combo. The soups here are delicious and dependable. The half sandwich is usually served on small pieces of bread as a \"whole\" sandwich and can include any of their wonderful sandwich choices. Their Garden Vegetarian sandwich is perfect--avocado, hummus, peppers and more yummy stuff. I usually order it on the sourdough--which is the real deal (from a bakery) and not the pre-sliced crap often served at sandwich places.   I pair this up with a small soy chai latte and I'm good. Sitting outside in the warm weather is always nice.  I wish they would offer a half salad / soup option or even just a half salad option since their salads are too big for me. But they won't budge on this for some reason. They do have a smaller garden salad, though.  I've only tried a couple of the breakfast items--the French toast was too sweet and the omelette was just okay.  Come here Monday - Friday for lunch and odds are there will be one or two people from my office sitting next \u00a0to you.",

The avocado was super fresh and the bacon was cooked PERFECTLY! It was great and I was even able to get half down, considering the hangover I had. \u00a0I ended up eating the other half on the beach, which may have been even better, but a bit sandy :)  It's also priced pretty well. My sandwich was only $5.95, which is alot cheaper than most other fancy sandwich shops.",

    "review_text": "Time: 3:03pm/70\u00b0F partly sunny  Purpose: Came back from south bay earlier and checking out area. Remembering that this used to be a local hangout back in the days.  Ambiance: Your standard neighborhood cafe with mostly locals. Weekends seems more popular when others nearby are packed to the limits. Some mismatched tables/chairs place throughout. Kids will find it boring as no coloring books or play area for them. Place is outdated with not much of any modern but if you come for the food and drinks you will overlook it. You will really need to know the staff here or else you'll get the stink eye treatment.   Staff: A lady about mid 40's not too helpful when ask for specifics. Seems to like doing things at her pace and time.   Cleanliness: Grade B-, needs some new chairs some are cut and some have unexplained stains.  Eats/Drinks: Fresh fruit salad $4.75 and cappuccino $3.25. Can't say it's good or bad fruit was house made cantaloupes needs to ripen up a little more. Cappuccino decent but strong, scolded my tongue, ouch.  Products/Services: Coffee, capps, lattes, espressos, juice, chips, egg products, vegetarian friendly, sandwiches, soup/salad, fruit bowls/salad, french toast, bagels, waffles, sides, create your own.   Punch Lines: North Beach, schools, library, safeway, TJ's, laundromat, salon, bikeshop, Coit tower, hotels, post office, gym, street parking, muni bus, parks, churches, restaurants, Lombard street, art institute.  Tradeoffs: A local place that carries most of the upper north area but at about 20% cheaper than most. Not too touristy mostly locals. Happy hour drinks are price just right.  Final Thoughts: It's one of those places you go on a lazy Sunday afternoon with paper in hand nothing much to do but sit and sip. Perfect for me to hide from friends as all of them are in heavy foot traffic area like cafe treist. Service is just lacking for my daily visit leave it for the weekends you'll be just fine.",

The feta being in the upper layer melted into the lower layers, infusing a cheesy chewy texture which provided contrast against the spinach and tomatoes.

The hidden gem of the area, tucked away from the riffraff of the fisherman's wharf/pier 39 crowd, they have a great menu of exciting flavors, ranging from savory breakfast frittatas to rich soups and fresh, flavorful salads. Their soups are by far my favorites, they are constantly changing, and are always my go-to no matter the weather or time of day (butternut curry, red pepper Gouda bisque, Mediterranean veggie, Thai chicken basil, I'd go on but now I'm drooling).  Highly, HIGHLY recommend stopping by anytime for a sandwich and a coffee or a beer, have a sit and enjoy the great location, friendly staff, and, above all, amazing food!",

In addition to being located in a corner of the City I have not yet experienced (and am very much looking forward to experiencing more!), Cafe Francisco also delighted me because:  * True to its name, it just *feels* like Classic San Francisco circa turn of the (previous) century: old wooden paneling reminiscent of chowder houses, antique-designed bathroom signs, tree-lined brick-filled street and proximity to Coit Tower. I almost expected the fresh fish catch deliveries to be in the back.  * It has very friendly staff *and* patrons. During my visit, an 80- (or 90-) something man came in to order a glass of wine and a customer looked out for him, asking me to have him step in front of me. How could I refuse? He was adorable! He took a lot of time ordering and chatting...subsequently adding a feeling of familiarity, warmth, community and history to the already historically-ensconced environment.  * Its menu is definitely ample, and my selection was perfect: what else to order but The Francisco Salad, replete with greens (spinach, tomatoes &amp; artichokes) and protein (avocado, feta and chicken which I used to replace the bacon which normally accompanies this)? All of this topped by a beautiful basil leaf and accompanied by lightly-toasted wheat (of course) sourdough with a tasty strawberry &amp; pineapple garnish. Delishhh.  A few nits: the coffee was just sort of so-so, and there is only one functional power outlet (and this was hogged by a less-communal patron...he also had a Mac though, so I empathize). But: there is free wifi!  I'd definitely consider returning here on my next romp in this historical, quaint, sunny part of town.",

The atmosphere is personal and cozy, though, so many loyal customers go and sit for a couple of hours reading or chatting with friends.  The service is quick, the food is always fresh and very generous on the portions. There's a touch of fresh pepper on many dishes, which adds just the right amount of flavor to the dishes. My top picks from Cafe Francisco are the San Fran, Garden Vegetarian, and Roast Beef Tuscany sandwiches, and the Francisco and Greek Salads.  Breakfast at the cafe is also very enjoyable; the omelets are all very tasty and filling. They recently added new special omelets, which I have yet to try but I anticipate doing so.  I highly recommend this cafe for those looking for a quiet \"getaway\" in the busy tourist area of North Beach/Fisherman's Wharf.",

The place also has free internet, but it closes early (7:00pm everyday), so it's not much use as a cafe, but probably great as a lunch and snack spot if you live/work around here. \u00a0  The ambiance, however, is crap. \u00a0Dirty old tables, lame music, and the workers are yelling and banging stuff constantly. \u00a0These problems with the environment cost them two stars. \u00a0I mean, it's set up like a quiet little deli on a quiet street corner with light (lame) music, but it's like a New York subway in there just because of the noise made by the people behind the counter. \u00a0Not conducive to anything pleasant. \u00a0If they fixed that (i.e. learned manners and common sense on running a place that's comfortable for customers), then place would be great!",

When I'm not busy being bitter, we find places new at least to us to park our keesters for a spell. On the way back on Powell, we stopped here since it just seemed inviting before going up that treacherous incline to Washington Square Park. OK, it's not that treacherous. It's not even that much of a hill. We just wanted a Diet Coke and maybe something to snack on before counting our steps again.  There's quite a selection of salads and sandwiches served here. Also a lot of tables occupied by people working on their MacBook Airs (or is it MacBooks Air?). We were able to snag a booth and split the $7.95 Greek Salad, which turned out to be quite a treat with fresh hummus and dolmas added for good measure. There were lots of other fresh ingredients - garbanzo beans, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives, cucumber slices, tomato wedges, red onion, basil leaves, and feta cheese of course (see photo). It was an unexpected cornucopia of goodness which tasted healthy and delicious. As we munched, regulars walked in with great frequency to get their caffeine boost. Definitely a neighborhood cafe that I wish was in my neighborhood.  FOOD - 4 stars...quite a plethora of fresh ingredients in the Greek Salad here AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...where everybody knows your name...except mine SERVICE - 4 stars...friendly and attentive TOTAL - 4 stars...a welcome find for casual neighborhood eats",

Second, their roast beef was wet. \u00a0Like dripping wet. \u00a0I'm not sure how cold cuts are on the West Coast, but to me, roast beef shouldn't be wet enough to drip whatever it was soaking in.  Third, their sourdough bread. \u00a0I'm under the impression that San Francisco is the place to get good sourdough, but the toasting they put on the slices here took all the flavor out of it and made the crust too hard to be enjoyable.

The ingredients are always fresh (the breads are always fresh, the tomatoes are nice red and ripe, and the lox doesn't smell \"fishy\") and the portions aren't stingy either.   \u00a0The real problem is the service. The owner doesn't smile much, but is polite. His staff on the other hand is surly and unprofessional - even if you make sure they are watching when you drop some cash in the tip jar.  \u00a0I went in there a few minutes after 12pm and asked if it was possible to still get the lox bagel. The cashier glared at me a barked \"no breakfast!\" Ok, no problem, just asking. Disappointing, but I understand. So I order the BLT with avocado, which was great, but after paying and sitting down, I noticed that the chalkboard had a lox sandwich special for lunch! Wtf? Is it too much of a strain to politely tell the customer that no, we aren't serving that breakfast item, but we are serving something that is 95% the EXACT same thing as a lunch special? If that's the case, I think that putting my hard earned cash into the tip jar might be a bit too much of a strain on my part.   \u00a0Regardless of the rotten service and FiDi level prices, the patio tables and the tasty, fresh food will keep me coming back.",

The service isn't really up to much... a New York scowl awaits you when you order, and if you have the slightest accent, you'll repeat everything 6 times, mainly because the person taking the order isn't looking at you. The food is pretty good though, the eggs and salsa are top notch. The coffee is a little below par for this town (help yourself from the flask), but if you just flew in from North Korea, you might think it's awesome. The jazz in the background will either add to the ambiance or distract, depending on your taste in music (it makes me tense) but you'll get nothing else for free (water, coffee top ups, a smile). Having said all that, it's well away from the other tourist coffee bars - you'll feel more like a local, which can be refreshing.   It fits the location, pretentious and over valued. Just like that Inuit Poetry major.  **edit - after scouring the area a little further and realizing that virtually every other caf\u00e9 gives free coffee refills with breakfast, this place is even more disappointing.

My co-workers and I hit up this place for a Tuesday lunch, and they didn't balk at the group of 10 that showed up and started moving their tiny tables around. I came most recently for a lunch alone with my book, and it was perfect for that, too. You can come here on a bad day and have a pastry or scone to eat your feelings away, or you can come here on regular, good days and have your choice of salads, sandwiches and espresso drinks.  Caprese salad was almost the perfect size - it was actually a shade too big, leaving a tomato+mozzarella+basil ball for a lucky, still-hungry co-worker. Iced coffee kept me blissfully awake through food coma. The roast beef sandwich on focaccia with pesto is my favorite so far, and all that oil reminds me that I should take the hills home instead of the F. Francisco salad is good and worth the $9 if you're, say, de-toxing from four days in unhealthy Texas.  Speaking of the oil, there is a lot of olive oil in everything. This makes for tasty, but it's perhaps a bit much. Also, the roast beef sandwich and an iced chai latte ran me $11. Not the end of the world, but I'll think twice about how much I'm spending later for dinner.  I've complained loudly, at length, about the dearth of regular-person places to eat in Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach. I'm more than happy to welcome Cafe Francisco to my 9-5 list.",

I was skeptical that this tiny place on Powell Street was anything more than a coffee/bagel walk in. Instead, I was greeted with a huge menu that covered at least three continents. I settled on the Greek Salad, to satiate my European craving of the day, and a bagel, because I hadn't had breakfast yet.  The salad? Oh it was Greek enough for me. The lettuce was leafy and green, and it came with several blocks (not crumbles) of Feta, and a healthy portion of hummus on top. The highlight, though, was perhaps the best dolma I have ever tasted. Though the dressing was a rather bland balsamic vinaigrette, instead of my preferred Greek, I let it slide. The rest of it was that good.  My plain bagel, by itself, wasn't particularly interesting. But the welcome surprise of whipped cream cheese made it at least a little adventurous.  And to top it all off, the coffee was strong with a bit of a smokey flavor. I'll be heading back soon to try the rest of the menu.",

I have a few favorites on the menu including the Francisco Bagel w/ Lox -- although for $10, it's become a \"treat\" instead of \"the usual\" -- and the San Fran sandwich on foccacia with turkey instead of chicken.   Although thing I go back for is the Hazelnut coffee. Sure the morning staff is a bit grumpy, but the coffee helps.   They went through a real rough patch with staff who didn't know how to multitask and were sloppy. Everything suffered, and it was right after they raised everything by $1. Those guys are gone now though -- thankfully the \"little one\" as we called him is ... I once waited for a good 5 minutes at the counter with a line of 4 behind me while he counted tips! -- and the staff seems to be somewhat better ... the food has been more consistent, but I still feel like I only eat there once in a while as opposed to at least 1x/week now.   The ambiance is minimal, although cozy; benches inside are hard and uncomfortable and the owner never seems to be enjoying himself or the fact that he has customers, but the table by the big window or the patio are good options. Mostly bring the food home with me -- I think maybe to escape the chaos of new staff and a sourpuss owner.   Bottom line ... some competition moved into the neighborhood recently -- tried it once and Franny's will always be my default. More like 3.5 stars.",

I was in the area because I was getting the grand tour of the malt house down the block by one of the project managers, and after four hours of walking around we were pretty hungry. Having worked there for so long, he suggested we pop in here for lunch, siting delicious sandwiches. Now, being a vegetarian I believe there was really only one option on the menu for me sandwich wise. The sammy sounded pretty darn good, and after reading other reviews I almost regret not getting it, but I opted for the Mediterranean plate since I had been craving some good hummus for a few days.  The service was quick, they came and cleaned off our table as soon as we sat down which was nice. The plate was huge, there was hummus and pita bread, plus dolmas and fallafel, plus a giant greek salad. On the whole the plate was pretty damn delicious, but to be nit picky, the hummus could have used a bit more tahini, and the large chunks of feta was a little odd. I did however, really like that they get everyone a little bit of fruit with their meal.  We sat here for at least an hour eating and talking, and by the time we left the near empty cafe had filled up a bit. All in all, if I am in that area again I will definitely stop in for a bite to eat, although the portions are quite large for cafe food.
