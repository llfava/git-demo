And indeed they had! \u00a0The entire upstairs loft was empty, so we grabbed a perch up there. \u00a0The atmosphere was very cool, laid-back and kind of a luxe-vintage thing going on. \u00a0They had a really nice diverse beer selection and I saw a bunch of people drinking the Sofia Coppola champagne-minis which are awesome. \u00a0  Everyone seemed friendly and there was even a huge pug dog eating french fries at the banquette in front as we left. \u00a0The fries looked good so we asked his owner where they were from. \u00a0They were from Mo's down the street so that was our next stop of the evening...",

I don't know if the bartender was a good mixer and I wasn't pleased with their beers on tap. \u00a0The crowd was a good mix of urban intellectuals (I went on a night where there was trivia), but in the end I fell a little in love with the ambiance created by my non-sentient surroundings. \u00a0Love the red couch along the back wall. \u00a0Love the few small tables and high tops, which left the space feeling intimate. \u00a0Love that there is an upstairs. \u00a0And the lighting was perfect for good conversation of any and all sorts.  So what makes for a good bar? \u00a0A good bar is a space where you want to drink and converse and you feel more of yourself than you did before. \u00a0Bars like this make me feel more sophisticated, but casually so. \u00a0The Church Key to my heart!",

They also have some interesting beers on tap so our \"one drink\" turned into a couple. Next time I'm in the neighborhood I will stop on in for another tasty beer adventure...though with so many amazing beers to chose from... and with the affable bartender...and chill relaxed vibe... it can be a bit dangerous if you have to be somewhere the next day-be warned that you may end up \"tasting\" more delicious beers than you bargained for.",

Also upstairs in the Church Key was Open Mic night, but honestly even though I was sitting at the bar downstairs I rarely heard a joke being told, either great sound system downstairs or nothing laugh worthy was being told haha, sorry. \u00a0(not sorry)  Bar tender for the night was Thomas, and he is a pretty cool dude, told him that I'm fairly new in the beer world so I got to try a few samples of what they had on tap, after finding a few that I liked I went ahead and ordered a glass, can you believe the 1st one was on the house because it was my bday! WOOT WOOT!  Lots of fun was had here everyone who came in was friendly and fun, even met a man who worked for Google, but didn't liked to be called a googlier haha. \u00a0Music was playing the in the background, for the life of me I couldn't tell you who, but then a song came on and I was like hold up isn't that George Michael and of course everyone said NO WAY this is Queen, and then I was like nope thats George, being a George Michael fan from back in the Wham days, I know the man's voice, and Thomas checked the IPod and said well shit it's both.

It is a wonderfully cozy space that is never too loud so you can have great conversations here. I particularly like the space \"upstairs\" although sitting at the bar (if you can snag a seat) is the way to go if you want to engage with the bartenders who are always more than willing to offer you suggestions of new brews to try.

The staff are ALWAYS super down to earth, mellow and can talk beer like it was their first born child.   They have a nifty second floor and if you have a big group you can go up there.

It's perfect for when you're in the mood to drink a couple of beers and unwind with friends, but aren't really up to Going Out and stumbling your way back home in the wee hours of the morning (a different yelp review for another time). I usually come here when I want to grab a drink or two with a friend or a small group of people, but wouldn't really recommend going here if you're with a large group because it isn't huge and seating is somewhat limited. The beer list is LONG, so if you plan to come here with someone who \"doesn't like beer\" there is probably something on the menu even for these foolish people. The bartenders also let you sample the beers on draft, which helps you avoid the disappointment that comes with spending $9 on a beer you thought you would like but actually makes you want to gag. Ok, I haven't actually had a beer that makes me feel like that, but I could imagine. The bartenders I've encountered here have been pretty knowledgeable and helpful, so I've only gotten good suggestions so far. I just came here again this past weekend when a friend was in town, and he was both impressed by the local feel of the place and happy to see an obscure beer he loves on the menu (which made me look cool).

Once we had our beers, we sat upstairs where there was ample seating to enjoy the drinks and talk it up a bit.

Extremely knowledgeable bartenders, lots of rare ridiculousness, appropriate glassware and friendly folks.  Also, they had the Black Keys album on repeat. *WIN*!!!  The place is a little small, but it's cozy. Upstairs has a low ceiling, which, at first, was oppressive, but after a few beers, it kicked ass. One caveat, which doesn't matter so much during the winter months, but during the summer it gets hotter than a supermodel in a Microbikini. Like, literally uncomfortable. Other than that the setting is great.  They have a pretty quick rotation of kegs, and their website is inaccurate. Just go there, ask them what's best and drink away. You won't leave disappointed.

The one saving grace is that while I choose to mostly dodge North Beach, if you want to meet in a bar somewhere in the area, I would make it be this one. \u00a0The place wasn't packed like a sardine tin and the clientele seem to be mostly enjoying themselves at a moderate pace instead of trying to get completely obliterated. \u00a0Just don't try to get me back across Green St. now...",

Sadly there is a problem with Church Key; it \u00a0just does not feel like a beer joint, there is no beer character.

I ordered a peach beer of some brand. The bartender gave me different beer of the same brand, which was my fault because I named the brand only and not the variety. He offered to take the beer back and give me the one I wanted, but I relented and accepted the beer he had already poured; he insisted that I was getting a good deal on the beer. I took the beer back to my table and checked the menu to see what I had gotten, and it seemed that I had been overcharged by $1. I decided not to bring it up cause I had already left the bar area.  The second time I ordered a round I checked the menu and added up the expected total in my head. I gave the barkeep my order and he checked the menu on his own to get the correct prices, but the amount he told me overcharged $2 for the round. I pointed this out on the menu and he apologized and charged me the correct amount.   The lesson is this: Go to this bar, be prepared to pay a premium for good beer, and definitely double-check your bill like you're getting Chinese take-out.",

It's partly my fault for not saying anything, but the bartender was already annoyed because the Mr. had the audacity to ask him about the beers. \u00a0Not like, \"Why don't you carry Bud?\" but simply, \"Do you have a pilsner?\" \u00a0I guess our not knowing which of the selections was a pilsner was bothersome to our expert bartender, the server of hot wine.

Go ahead and ask the bartender questions about the selection. He has opinions and will ask you questions back to find out exactly what you want. This place also has a fair amount of regulars who are cool and appreciate good beer. With all of the beers on the menu here both in bottle and on tap, I find it so funny that they have PBR on the menu as their \"mystery american beer\". You can usually make a pretty accurate character assessment of a person at the bar if they passed up all of the awesome options for a PBR (im just sayin).   One strange feature of this place is the placement of the washroom. It is just passed the bar where there is a very narrow place to line up. This means that people waiting for a chance to relive themselves are inevitably standing right next to a group who is having a conversation at the bar.

OK, it was blueberry, still delic. \u00a0As clean cut as the place is and as knowledgeable as Jason is, there is no sense of pretentiousness.

Feel bad that this is my first negative review, but the bartender \"lady\" has some serious anger management issues.  I have never been treated this unprofessional and rude. The worst bar experience I had by far in the 7 years I live in this city. Still stunned...  What happened? We got a bottle of white wine for our group. It was the worst wine I drank in a very long time but OK, it's a beer place and they have lots of good beers there. Guess our own fault. When we (nicely!) asked whether we could exchange the still almost full bottle of wine for a beer or 2 (they sell the same wine by glass also) she suddenly got grumpy. She poured the beers, then made us pay for them and then asked us to leave right after. Just like that. Speechless.  Please dear Church Key, get rid of that bartender. You are a great place otherwise.",

The boyfriend and I have each been in San Francisco for over 20 years so it takes some really egregious pricing to shock us but Church Key managed to do it. And in these extremely difficult economic times, I find their prices pretty offensive.   What's sad is that the Church Key has the potential to be one of the most unique, enjoyable bars you could ever have the pleasure of being in. \u00a0As the other reviews note, the ambience is very chill: \u00a0great lighting, colors, very cozy, and music that adds to the experience but doesn't drown you out. \u00a0I never made it upstairs, but down below there is no TV, which is also an \u00a0added plus. \u00a0My boyfriend and I did not find the bartender particularly friendly, although he wasn't overtly rude, either.  For unusual beer selection, there are a plethora of choices such as City Beer, Healthy Spirits, and Toronado. Or head to Lanesplitters in Oakland, Barclay's in Rockridge, The Warehouse Cafe in Port Costa. While these places not might have the ambiance that Church Key has - their pricing is much more palatable.   If you really want to spend ridiculous amounts of money on beer, go to Mays Field and watch Tim Lincecum pitch, head to the Cliff House for the view, or go the the Top of the Mark for a styley time out.",

That being said, there are a few bright spots. I personally didn't like the attitude at La Trappe, and well, if you're not into Belgian beer, you're pretty much SOL.   Church Key pretty much takes a teeny weeny little beer/wine space and gives North Beach a mellow little spot with a great beer lineup. The bartenders are nice guys, and the lineup is ever-changing. Are there beers with bigger selections, rarer beers and lower prices? Sure, but not in North Beach, and not with the \"welcome to my living room\" atmosphere of Church Key. There's a big resurgence in quality and craft beer in San Francisco, and it's always good to see more places pushing the word of good beer.",

We ranged from dark beer to light beer. We had 3 different beers each. I thought it was fairly priced however, I stayed cleared of the $15 and plus beers. I would really like to see a beer tasting, that would be awesome! We had the best seat in the house. If you can, get the booth on the first floor (next to the door), it's away from the traffic at the bar and allows you to talk without having to scream. Our server, Lisa, was great. Super friendly and always came to check up on us.   I want to give it 5 stars, but parking was horrible. I had to park about 4 blocks away, but it was well worth the walk.",

It's cherry and chocolate flavors were perfectly balanced and the beer had a smooth,clean finish. It was definitely something I would drink again or buy on my own. They also had a rose hibiscus beer in stock that I am awfully fond of. Needless to say, there is a good mix of the offbeat and some of the usual suspects. The tuesdsy night trivia was fun background noise. And, the upstairs area is perfect for a small gathering. Which is terrific comsidering I was there for a birthday.

I walked up to the bar tender who didn't seem very busy and politely tried to get his attention. \"Excuse me\", I said lightly and got no response from him. Since there were people chatting around me I tried again, but with a little more volume, \"Excuse me\".

As we're walking out, I noticed the bartender was saying something in my direction.

Completely nondescript sign with a key above the door that keeps a lot of the riff raff out.  ChurchKey had ten beers on tap of all different variety. They had Santo Marro from DogFish on tap, so that was pretty cool. There was only one bartender but he did a good job of providing recommendations when needed.   Also, no kitchen. You are free to bring in your own food though - plenty of pizza joints around the bar.  Good stop here.",

    "review_text": "I've always been a fan of speak-easy type lounges and bars. I don't know what it is about them, but I love to be incognito for awhile and drink my libations in secret. The past few months, I have casually strolled past the Church Key on my way to Savoy Tivoli, or Grant and Green or Gino and Carlo's, or Golden Boy, or...well, you get the picture (this is my 'hood after all), and wondered what the heck it was! The outside is dark, the windows tinted and there isn't any other signage other than a mysterious key hanging over the door. I was dying to know what sort of secretive behaviour was happening behind those doors. Did I need a password? Or better yet, a special key?  Luckily, my intrigue was put to rest last night when my date suggested we check it out for a beer. A-ha! So it's a bar...good to know! We arrived at 7pm, and the place was pretty empty, which was great for us because we could chat and hear one another. We sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely knowledgable on their extensive beer list. I told him I usually drink Stella and wanted something similar. He quickly offered up a Hawaiian Beer that was called \"Blonde\"-something and had a picture of a hula girl on the front. I'm easy...sold! My date grabbed his favorite German lager and we happily talked and drank our frosty brews for the next hour. We joked around with the bartender and wanted to know what the word was for a beer sommalier. Brewlier? Beerologist? Anyone have answers??  The atmosphere is simple yet cozy and dark. I loved the lounge-y music and low lighting. It appears there is an upstairs loft area to get lost in, but we did not make our way up there. They also claim to have pub quiz on Tuesday nights, so I will have to come back and check it out.  Overall, this is a great place to meet someone for a drink, especially if you are an adventurous beer drinker. I think it would be fun to have a large group here as well for some after-work shinanigans.",

Ordered: Duchess de Bourgogne- sour, fruity, red-ale style beer, yumm!! La Caracole Saxol- smooth blonde ale, sweet malt with a touch of spice, also recommended Wild Game sausages- I tried the boar and rabbit, came served with a slice of sourdough bread and sauerkraut, good stuff when paired with your beers..

There is such a ridiculous range of tastes that you get a bit obsessed with finding your next brew. Seriously, some of the beers here really change the way you think about how a beer should taste.   The best thing though, and this holds for the Broken Record when it comes to buying scotch, is that Jason is super helpful when it comes to making your choice. He doesn't make you feel like an idiot for asking questions and seems to make it his mission to find you a beer you'll like. Just give him a vague idea of stuff you like and he'll hook you up.

The barman was friendly and knowledgeable about the eclectic beer selection. It had a cool vibe, definitely a place to have a quiet conversation with friends or perhaps go on a date.  I would say that the selection is not necessarily any better than La Trappe and Monk's Kettle, and certainly Toronado has more beers on tap.   In addition, they had the door open all night and it was FREEZING!  Overall though, a good place to drink some interesting beer and have a quiet night.

Bastard and liked his. \u00a0A regular, Don (maybe another part owner?) was very friendly. \u00a0He is a distributor and has a couple of the wines served there. \u00a0He even offered us a taste of his bottle of Black Orchard, a champagne like beer - maybe a nice start for any ladies who are not into beer. \u00a0It was really a nice evening enjoying good beer and chatting away with other patrons. \u00a0To end the evening, we both tried a lighter beer in bottle. \u00a0Hubby had something from Germany and I forgot what I had but I picked it because the description says very carbonated. \u00a0  If you enjoy beer, you need to check out this place. \u00a0It has 8 drafts and about 50 varieties in bottles or cans from 12 oz. to 24 oz from $5-$20+ all around the world. \u00a0Yes, plenty with high alcohol content so drink accordingly. \u00a0They do have a one page wine list including Sofia sparkling wine. \u00a0Both the menus, yes even the beer menu, has a simple description of the flavor. \u00a0  We also met another patron who happens to be a neighbor across the street!  This maybe the best beer pub in North Beach.",

As I was sitting on the stool, I looked over at my friends and said, \"Oh my god. I think I'm going to move here.\" The lady bartender I encountered was rough around the edges (maybe a bit too rough), but I have to give it to her on the music selection. She was rocking Refused and some other really great bands, so I'll take a few death stares for that. Also, I think she was displeased with mine and my friend's request to drink coffee. She obliged us, despite her obvious annoyance at the request. C'est la vie, especially because our other friends were drinking. Honestly though . . . one of THE best times I've had at a bar without drinking booze. That's gotta be a world record or something! I'll definitely be there often when I move up.",

I chose an awesome Canadian beer with hints of hibiscus and pear. It was surprisingly tart, and I was really charmed by the Victorian-goth label. Dorky, I know. I also had a great thick stout that could have doubled for dinner.   The owner (I think his name is Jason?) will spend a long time chatting with you about the beers he stocks and the work he has put in the bar renovations.

We hit Church Key up this past Saturday for some post-SF Beer Week fun and were a tad shithoused by the end of Round 1. \u00a0My husband was so affected by the camaraderie on display here, that well into the evening, he decided to announce his run for Mayor of San Francisco. \u00a0The bartender, Ben, was quite nice to my husband, under the circumstances, which also gives Church Key a huge thumbs-up, in my book.  Some of the selections I count among my favorites include Dogfish Head's Midas Touch and the Allagash. \u00a0The taps are switched out periodically, so you can sample a variety of the bests every few weeks or so. \u00a0  One thing I would LOVE for them to add is Russian River Ales, such as Temptation and Sanctification.

Besides the staff, who are always great, I love: 1) the crowd - it's totally diverse &amp; super-friendly and I meet new interesting people every night I'm there. It's not too noisy, too small to get really crowded (I'm slightly claustrophobic). I especially love meeting the traveling beer nuts from all over who have heard through the grapevine that this is THE place to hit when in SF. \u00a0I've never seen one disappointed.  2) the beer! This is really a great place to push your tastes in beer well past your comfort level and discover flavors you didn't know you loved. If you know a brand of beer that you do like, don't go for it again, ask for something similar but with a different taste. \u00a0You may not love everything, but you'll definitely find some completely new types that you will. I've tasted my way into some weird corners of the beer world here, and grown to really love the diversity of the Lambic/Sours/Brett family.  3) the meat pies &amp; the wild game sausage (gator, pheasant, venison, and rabbit ATM, sometimes boar). \u00a0If you get a chance to catch them when they're doing the food pairing nights, that's a don't-miss. \u00a0last time it was 3 courses - cheeses, salumis, and chocolates, and it was *fantastic*.

Not that he hates Sierra Nevada, it's just this place works hard to maintain an extensive 8-10 page menu of beer from all corners of the world.  Can't decide what you want?

Be warned, this is very sweet robust porter.  Described as being 'brewed with six varieties of malted barley,  hops and hand-toasted coconut'.  I am in love. . .

I had just finished dinner at Sushi on North Beach and we were seeking a place where we could chill out and have a beer. The first thing you notice is Jason the bartender, who is as jovial a host as you can have. Beyond that, it's clear he takes great pride in the variety of the beer menu - a menu which changes virtually every week. And that includes what's on tap.   Try the Aventinus for notes of \"caramelized banana\" - a tasty and smooth beer that is a bit strong (8%) but worth every penny. I also tried a 14% malt liquor beer that was a bit heavy called samichlaus. I can't wait for food to be included cause I'm DEFINITELY coming back here!",

I get that Church Key might not be the best place for a meet up but we started pretty early. \u00a0The folks meeting me there are more typical of pac heights, marina and snob hill crowd. Prime real estate for the ridicule of the edgy bar tender. My friends were spending a lot of money and being respectful. The issue the bar tender seemed to have was that we were crowding the bar toward the bathroom as that's where I had been sitting and my friends joined me. Rather than ask us to move or try to accommodate us with another space he went on with passive aggressive actions and commentary. He barged his way through us with glasses several times, mocked the group in front of his regular patrons and gave some folks who were asking for a recommendation the worst tasting beer on their menu. My friends came to me and said \"taste this beer it's what the bar tender suggest...it was like $9 and tasted like it was infected. Way to communicate, barman. Way to be a professional. It's your bar space---Manage it. You certainly didn't refuse the money pouring into your till or tips in your jar. But that's not what it's about right? It's about holding onto this one little place that allows you to continue to believe that you are better than everyone else. This is SF....it's chill and people bar hop on weekends keeping your job in demand and your pocket lined. Don't be a dick.",

Another point of note is the quality bartenders. \u00a0A few regulars rotate and all have an impressive understanding of their offerings and beer in general. \u00a0If you are unsure or overwhelmed by the large selection, I am confident you will be in good hands.

If you came up with more than 5 (White Men Can't Jump, Zombieland, Natural Born Killers, People vs. Larry Flynt, Kingpin, and the list goes on...), you would have won the trivia night here. Trivia nights, I love 'em! Just one of the reasons to go to Church Key.   They have a wide selection of beers and a pretty detailed menu that actually describes each of the brews. Beers on tap seem to change pretty often, so there will always be a reason to stop in. I'd say the bartenders lean somewhat towards a 'too cool for school' attitude, but maybe they just prefer having their regulars here. There's quite a bit of seating both downstairs and in their upstairs area. On a weekday, you can definitely chill with a bunch of friends and have plenty of room to sit. I think they set up a DJ upstairs on the weekends, sometimes.   Ok, but it's in North Beach, the land of no parking (or $10 parking lots), so unless you have somehow appeased the parking gods and find parking within 5 blocks of this place, it's not the easiest bar to access. Maybe that's a good thing for the locals. Also be aware that the sign is just a picture of a key so you have to keep your eyes peeled for it, as there's not neon sign announcing its existence to the world.   So if you want to test out your trivia savvy or try out some new microbrews, head on over to Church Key.",

But there are those rare occasions, and the few times I'd been there the beer selection and vibes were always enticing enough that I wanted to check it out on a more languid weekday with a few close friends.  A friend's sister, visiting from the UK, was staying in a North Beach hostel with her boyfriend and thus I decided on Church Key for post-dinner drinks. We went on a Wednesday. We sat at the bar. The DJ was playing upbeat jazz and soul and it was a gooooood!  I really like the vibe here when its somewhere between moderately mellow and almost loud to the point where you need to start raising your voice. It feels vibrant, yet still relaxing- perfect for mid-week.   As for the selection, well the beers on tap are rotating pints of perfection and they have a great book of bottled as well.   Everything up to this point is good.... but don't expect the bar tender to help you figure that out. This is where Church Key looses some stars. See, I only know a little bit about beer- such as: I like it!!! Other than that, I'm pretty clueless as to what's what save for that golden beers are light and dark ones are heavy, and that IPAs are from India and a stout will make you fat :)   When I asked the bartender about a particular draft I've never had, the answer I got was \"well, it's a pale ale, soo... it's kinda light.\" Well, what do ya know? A beer with \"IPA\" in the name is a pale ale? Reaaallly??? I wanted to know about the flavor or whatever makes the beer interesting and work $12 a pint! The bartender told me I could have a taste or two of beverages I was curious about. \u00a0This only half makes up for the fact that in an establishment known for unique beers, the person serving them appears to know nothing. He also acted aloof and disinterested in taking care of patrons. Not really cool in a small little joint like this  Obviously this guy isn't the only bartender who works here. But still.  I'm also knocking off a points because even though I am one of maybe a handful of people that knows Church Key offers a half off pint to anyone checking in there on Foursquare for the first time, Mr. Charisma behind the bar didn't offer me the deal after bringing it up and explaining how I forgot my phone at home. The one day!!! He didn't even seem slightly amused I knew they had a Foursquare deal. Dude?!? Just indulge my geekiness a little when you see me geeking out! You know? Bartender fail.  I'd throw in a half star if I could, though, for the $1 PBR they serve in a chalice :)",

The bartender is also the DJ so I guess I can't blame him for multitasking so well.   There's a great selection of beers! I've never flipped through so many pages of beer before! They even have a selection of cider and wine for decent prices ($6-8). There's a tiny upstairs lounge area to hang out with friends. Very cozy and very relaxed environment.",

Mind you this place seems to specialize in beers, lots and lots of beers, but alas that is lost on me, the non-beer drinker. However, they do have some fantastic red wines. My friend and I got there early enough that we were able to grab the front couch/seat that faces the sidewalk. Great people watching! We sat there and had a couple of glasses of wine and chatted it up. The bartender was really friendly and generous with the pours! This place has a pretty relaxed atmosphere with chill people, nothing too pretentious.",

Anyhow...I've been hearing a lot of buzz about his new beer mecca and popped in with Alyssa G. last night after dinner at Don Pistos. Unknowingly, we walked in during trivia night but were still able to grab a couple of beers (Allagash Witbier for her, Anchor Steam Our Special Ale for me) and had the upstairs loft to ourselves.  The beer was tasty, the company great, and the trivia harder than I would have thought. Congrats to Hipster Holiday Sweater, it sounded like you were running away with things when we ducked out.  Church Key is the type of bar that I could imagine spending hours at with friends on trivia night or bellying up to by myself to work my way through the taps. Either way, I'm a fan and will definitely be back.",

I may not be the beer aficionado, but Church Key seems to provide that venue to try something different and new. It is comfortable enough. There are a bunch of beers on tap, ranging in color, price, and taste. And then, there's the menu with even more hard-to-find brews in bottles. For the non-beer drinkers, a selection of wine/champagne is available. From what I understand, the beers will keep on changing. The good stuff will stay longer, while everything else rotates every few weeks. Not sure what to try? Just ask!  What I'd really love is an email list to inform me of what's new at Church Key!   It IS in North Beach and quite the trek for some of us [a worthwhile one though!]. The best part is that it is just one bus ride to/from home base, Broken Record.",

Red and white.   Not exactly a Sideways tour.  What they do have is a beer list that's longer than most books, and a fine one too. Everything from that Midwest standby Pabst Blue Ribbon -- in a can -- to some 50 dollar beer that the barkeep remarked that was special occasions. I had a red beer -- don't recall the name -- and it was a fine choice. They really know their beer (read my monologue about 4th Street Vine), so I don't feel stupid about asking for a particular flavor. I tell them what they want, they get it.  What's nice about the place is that it doesn't have that North Beach tourist and drunken college student (read: not the Savoy) vibe; the place is nice enough that people think that they have to act civilized (as said by the barkeep, Benjamin), and the runnin' soundtrack is hip enough to make us older types feel young without the youngins throwing up on our shoes.
