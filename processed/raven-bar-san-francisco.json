    "review_text": "Alright, not going to lie... this review is a little bias. Not because I know the owner or anyone that works here, but because service got a little personal.   It was a bachelorette party with a group of 10 girls. Our host sat us upstairs in the back couches and right next to the bar. Our waitress brought us our 2 bottles, we made a couple of drinks, and headed to the dance floor. They started with 90s hip hop and R&amp;B, which was perfect because that's what we grew up listening to. Once the music changed, we went back to our seats. But that's when the party really started. Want to know? This lady is keeping hush hush.   All the bartenders were REALLY attentive. Probably also because it was a bachelorette party, there were 10 of us, and we were all wearing extremely short skirts with really high heels. Special shout out to Julian for the love and making this group of ladies feel special. Also, special thanks to David for helping us organize the event, treating us with such great hospitality, and especially for the special treat.",

Online you can sign up on their guest list and there's no cover if you get in before 11pm.   The night started out when I touched down at SFO around 10pm. Clay picked me up from the airport and we took the 15min drive over to Raven's Bar. The area isn't filled with a bunch of clubs and is very low key, which was nice - it made parking extremely easy and we only had to walk 2 short blocks to the bar. The outside isn't much, small and quaint. Inside is small and tight at first but it opens up as you walk further in. I believe I counted a total of 3 bars. One when you first walk in, one in the back and one upstairs. This place is like a dive-lounge, it's an interesting feel. There looked like there was a small dance space downstairs, but we wanted to check out upstairs more. There's a long bar and then a small dance floor to the side covered by large tv's. They were playing music video's that matched up with the rad Hip-Hop that was bumpin' all night (totally fun &amp; cool). The DJ was great! Good mix of old school and new school Hip-Hop, great dancin' music!  Bartenders were great! I was always able to grab a drink. All cocktails were about $10-11 a piece. All my drinks were strong and doing everything they were supposed to. The dance floor became really crowded, but it was an awesome crowd. I danced the whole night away with my man! And loved every minute of it! They had great music, lights and smoke at our feet. Which if you're going to fog the room, I like it at your feet vs.up in your air.   This may be my new favorite dancing spot in the city. It's fun, but low key at the same time. It makes it easy to disappear and go out dancing for the night without it becoming too big a deal. I would definitely recommend the Raven to anyone looking for a fun night out.",

I wanted to get a table here for my boyfriend's birthday and got in contact with David. He promptly responded to my email within hours which I really appreciated and explained to me the process. However, it got kind of confusing when we were going back and forth about when my party was supposed to arrive. My boyfriend and I were scheduled to watch a show until 10:30pm at AT&amp;T park so it was impossible for us to arrive by 10pm so I suggested that someone from our party will be there to hold our reservation then I was told everyone has to arrive by that time.  Ok, that'd be impossible.. then David said he can hold an \"area\" for us. I was utterly confused whether that was a table or not and turns out it wasn't an actual table. Um, I'm not going to pay for bottle service if we can't get a table just because not everyone will arrive there by 10pm. After several emails and a phone call, I decided not to get a table. I appreciate David's patience though.   It was WAAAAYYY crowded for me to handle. Everyone was shoulder to shoulder and the bar downstairs by the front door is so narrow that everyone walking by bumps into you and I almost dropped my drink. There is ONE bathroom stall in the bathroom downstairs... ONE! While waiting in line for the bathroom, a girl told me that that was a slow night. WHAT? I can't even go upstairs to check in my coat! There was literally a line just to go upstairs. We (7 of us) all just hung out downstairs by the smoking area since everywhere else was so damn crowded. The music was OK, mostly 90s hiphop.   We finally got to go upstairs towards the end of the night only to find out that they just have another bar and another ONE stall bathroom and they play the SAME music. Bleh.   I guess the place is popular due to their music selection, location, and the fact that you can reserve a table without bottle service but wow was it crowded. I wanted to go here because it was close to our hotel and we love dancing and they have a dance floor but what's the point if we can barely move around?",

I think I've had every drink on the menu at this point. \u00a0Of course, some I like better than others, but they're all fantastic. \u00a0My favorite is the Castaway. \u00a0If you're not sure what to order, the bartender will gladly guide you to something delicious.  The second time I went in, I brought a friend (a habit I've developed) for happy hour. \u00a0We got through a few cocktails and were offered a free round. \u00a0What a nice gesture! \u00a0This is how it usually works at legit places: you are polite, you tip appropriately (AT LEAST $2 for every single drink - don't order three drinks and tip $2), and sometimes you get a free drink or two. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, I absolutely do not tip with the expectation of getting one on the house, but I've noticed it happens. \u00a0Again, a very nice gesture, and a smart one, because you tell your friends you found a kick ass spot, bring them in and benefit the business. \u00a0Regardless, the staff is amazing and they deserve to be tipped very well (no, I don't work here - I swear).  I don't know what else to say. \u00a0I love '90s night on Thursdays. \u00a0You can get some great eats from Triptych. \u00a0It's a popular, yet personable establishment, which is what makes Raven rare. \u00a0I know the names of most bartenders. \u00a0I've patronized every night of the week and the crowd (if there even is one) has always been completely chill. \u00a0This is not Holy Cow. \u00a0Cheers!",

David was really flexible and helpful in suggesting the type of space to reserve (booths versus tables) based on the range in guests I was expecting. Jeff and Cherine were the awesome bartenders that night, and mixed up some great cocktails.  Fast forward a couple of months to May, and I was able to call in a few hours beforehand and reserve a table for my graduation celebration (they were able to fit us in earlier in the night before another reservation kicked in).   I've taken mixed groups of all personalities (pretty reserved to party animals) and ages (college peers to folks in their 30s), and everyone has found something for them. I think it helped that we went on friday nights, when they have their 90s - present music video hits playing, which provides a variety that anyone can shake their groove thang to.",

I had the vampire slayer, which is a whiskey cocktail - sweet and citrusy but with enough alcohol so that you feel the burn. The bartender definitely gave me a little extra alcohol for this one. And she complimented what I was wearing.. needless to say, she went home with a hefty tip!  Next I tried the switchblade. A spicy cocktail, with a hint of sweetness, and a Tequila base. Very interesting blend, and something that I would recommend.  Also tried tastes of what my friends were having, but don't really remember the drinks' names. Regardless of what you order, you can rest assured that they won't skimp on the alcohol!  The DJ was killing it, a good mix of 90s/00s Billboard hits, as well as some current Top-40 songs.

I made reservations two weeks in advance for two 10-person booths, and they held them with no charge and no minimum. For comparison, I shopped around at a few other comparable bars... Many had at least $1000 drink minimum / reserved charges for a group of 20, or charged a flat fee for the space.  On the day of the event, the other birthday boy and I showed up to find welcoming bartenders who had even decorated our booths with balloons and a happy birthday sign.  I tried at least a sip of most cocktails on the menu, and honestly think they have a fun / creative mix that still all makes sense with their overall theme. And each of the main bartenders has their own signature drink, all of which we loved.  Kudos to you guys and gals @ Raven for making a great cocktail hour at the beginning of our birthday festivities. You rock.",

Do they expect/experience a lot of problems with people's behavior or belongings?  We went for a friend's birthday party on Saturday and while it was quiet and easy to get a drink from about 9:30-10, by 10:15 the crowds came in droves. Forget getting a drink- it will either take forever or make you need the restroom (which will also take forever, since they don't seem to have nearly enough for the people they stuff in this club like sardines).   I am not one to frequent dance clubs, so maybe I'm just the wrong audience, but by 10:30 it was, like... Outside-Lands-trying-to-reach-your-friends-at-\u00adPaul-McCartney crowded. Fire codes be damned!   Raven, perhaps rightly (judging by the lines) prioritized constructing ladies' rooms, but with only one men's-only restroom downstairs, at one point the guys in our group faced a 25-minute wait to get back upstairs.   We escaped out the fire exit by 11:15 to see a line down the block.   I do think it was nice that they offer the coat check and guest lists for birthday groups (and I'll give a higher rating than my own experience on the benefit of the doubt for those who did seem to enjoy themselves), but the crowd deterred me from drinking or staying.",

Look, I didn't have a terrible time at this place (that's not to say it wasn't bad, because it was). I was there with my friends, I bought a few drinks at reasonable prices, and I even waited on line to get upstairs to challenge myself to make the most of their 30-something square foot \"dance floor.\" Maybe \"dance floor\" is pushing it because that sounds like a large room, so let's say \"small designated space for dancing\" to be more accurate.  The music sucked and had no flow to it -- it was a horrible attempt at DJing/VJing/whatever-you-want-to-call-it, the floor was disgustingly sticky as if they were trying to glue your shoes down, and the entire staff just needs to be retrained or replaced.

I looked at the yelp reviews prior, so I wasn't really that thrilled to come here but I needed to get out.   My first thoughts upon walking towards Raven was, \"Lines lines lines yeah!\" (Read that with Thompson Twins in mind)  If you want to practice being patient you won't be disappointed coming here. There's a line for EVERYTHING.  A line to get in, a line to use the restroom, and line to go upstairs ('m not kidding) accompanied by a bouncer that guards the stairs. Prepare to stand in line and pointlessly scroll through your instagram or FB feed on your smart phone.  There is a $10 cover charge and that includes ladies as well, which I thought was kind of odd. Don't ladies usually always get in for free?   Also, the floors are STICKY as hell. It gets so crowded that people bump into each other and it becomes a wet and wild contest with all the spilled drinks sloshing in the air and splashing on the floor.   They play some old school nostalgic hip hop which was actually pretty nice. Everyone was reciting the lyrics to the songs they used to dance to in middle school. They played songs like \"Ghetto superstar\", \"Dilemma\", \"Everybody in the club getting tipsy\", etc. Basically everything I haven't heard in ages.  The crowd was friendly and the drinks were strong.  Overall I had a good night. \u00a0  3/5 stars",

It means it doesn't matter if I get smashed from the super delicious craft cocktails at any hours of the night and I will still make it home relatively in one piece (minus the time I ran into a baby tree..but I digress). From tequila shots to fency cocktails you should only be drinking with one pinky up, Raven has it all. My personal favorite is the herbal remedy because despite it's potency, drinking it makes me feel like I'm doing something really good for my body, almost like drinking green juice! It's super herby &amp; deliciousss. Also, if it's not super crazy packed (thurs, fri, sat nights) ask the bartenders to make you something off the menu. The bartenders are really awesome at making dranks &amp; are hot to boot, a couple of celeb look alike at this bar ;)  Yes, it gets pretty packed. It's a pretty small dance floor upstairs, but if you can booty bump your way around, it's really worth it. Thursday is always a little less crowded. It's free entry until 10 pm, but it's only $10 after. I've been the lines get pretty hairy so earlier is always better. A lot of people enjoy having their bday parties here. From what I hear, it's either free or super cheap (for reserving a table with no bottles, but don't quote me on that one). Definitely a fun spot to go for bday drinks, though.   Happy hour is M-F until 7 PM which includes 2 for 1 drink specials, $5 beer, $6 wine, and $3 off specialty cocktails. This means that you could come here to pregame and stay for the dancing until 2 AM. I've done this before and would highly recommend. Especially on the dance filled nights, you are bound to bump into at least two to three different groups of friends and random acquaintances. I most definitely saw Phil from Wongfu on at least 2 occasions, hehe. The music at Raven is the biggest pull of this bar for me personally. I'm not the biggest fan of EDM and this bar is the one bar that consistency has awesome 90's music. It's like the music that I danced to in high school, except you know, with alcohol. Plus there is a screen downstairs and downstairs that plays the music videos, it's an awesome blast to the past.",

(Whoever you were bartender in the back, pay attention to your RIGHT and LEFT 'cause you're losing tips for the night).

Dance floor is small, with a few bottle-service tables lined against one wall. One long bar with DIY water tank, so you don't have to bug the bartenders.

I will admit when I go clubbing, I just want to dance by myself to EDM. This is not the place to do so. The crowd fits the music genres, and the attire is more casual than dressy.  Raven is a fun bar if you're into that kind of thing. I can't really dance to hip-hop and such, so the only songs I really rocked out to were Britney Spears' \"Oops, I Did It Again\" and TLC's \"No Scrubs\". With that said, I probably won't be back.",

I reserved a spot for 30 of my friends about two months ahead of time (as I do...), and David (the owner) was kind when I couldn't figure out how to get the online guest list working. He even came and introduced himself to me earlier in the night. \u00a0The bartenders were darling, and extremely attentive to me and my friends no matter how crowded it got. And the music was also on point: 80's and 90's hip hop and R&amp;B played through most of the night, and it was only after midnight that music got kind of funky and too EDM-y (for the record, that is a made up genre and it is stupid). If you're in need of a venue with a private area for you and your friends--and a dance floor--Raven Bar is quite a place.",

    "review_text": "Yes, I can update my review after having a decent time on New Years Eve and I was able to actually experience Raven on a regular night....AND I LOVED IT!!!! I tried signing up for guestlist for free entrance before 11pm on Saturday but when I tried on a Tuesday or Wednesday, guest list was already closed. So my advice is that if you know you are gonna go to Raven, you should guestlist asap haha. That night I had to pay $10 regardless so we strolled on by at 11:15pm and there was a huge line out the door. After 11pm, they really do hold up the line and at first I thought it was to make the place look poppin but there is a capacity limit since the place is pretty small. It is a bar/lounge/dance club with a small dance floor on top so you cant fit as many people as the Grand. I guess that is what gives it its charm and why I like this place so much. I finally got in around midnight and was ready to dance the night away.  MUSIC There was actually a line to go upstairs to the dance floor and it was quite annoying to stand in two lines to get to dance but it was totallyyy worth it. The floor was packed but I made my way and omgosh the MUSIC!!! They had Nsync, Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Beyonce, Kesha and ALLL THE GOODIES. I WAS IN MUSIC DANCING HEAVEENN. They have the music video playing in the background as well. This is seriously the best music I have ever heard because it has the good late 90's and early '00s music, some of the older dancable music, and some modern hip stuff. I dont think I have ever given a dance club, especially one in SF, 5 stars but it totally deserves it. I will definitely be celebrating my birthday here! I went to request my two fave dance songs and numba one is Return of the Mack but I should have known that this DJ already played it. I was disappointed but I realized this guy is good. The DJ plays every weekend it seems like so I am feeling that. My second song is Too Close by Next and thank goodness he didnt play it yet. Usually you have to wait a bit for the DJ to play your requested song but he played it two songs later and I totally gave him a high five.I complimented a guy in a suit behind the bar and asked if he was the manager. He was and at first he thought I was complaining but I just wanted to show my appreciation. I complimented the place and he gave me 4 passes for free entrance and skip the line privileges. Score one for me! I hope you are reading this, but thank you!  ATTIRE The attire here is pretty chill and you def do not have to go all out with the Grand status clothes. I saw girls in jeans and guys looking casual but some people dressing up as well. I would feel inappropriate wearing like a tight dress and heels so if anything, I would wear a shirt and skirt with flats. The whole point is to feel comfortable and dance the night away :)  CROWD Yes, it is true that this place is mostly Asians in their mid late twenties and early thirties. It is a good looking crowd compared to other hip hop, top 40, pop dance clubs. I got there after midnight so I noticed all the guys had already prowled on the crowd so I guess if you are there to meet people, get in on guestlist and before 11pm so you can venture and not have to wait in that long line. I like that the guys here are not creeps as well and do not just stand at the dance floor staring at the girls dancing.   PARKING Parking is quite difficult so good luck finding! I cant really give you advice here.  I have never been so satisfied with a club ever. Music and people cant get better than this! If only this place was bigger but allll goood.  **TIPS** 1) Guestlist days before because most like the sign up will be filled, especially on Saturday and if you do the day of. Free before 11pm! Afterwards, they hold up the line and you wont get in until midnight. 2) If you love the older pop music and r&amp;b but also the new hip top 40s, THIS IS TOTALLY YOUR PLACE. I am sold like no other. 3) You dont have to dress that much to impress but you can still look cute for the crowd. 4) Enjoy :))))))",

I just really wish their \"speciality\" cocktails were included in the happy hour, they are not and are like 9 to $10. Only well drinks and beer/wine. What if I want to get a margarita with a decent tequila? Well tequila?...*dies*  I hadn't been here before they remodeled but nice, 3 bars and 2 dj booths with a small dancefloor upstairs. Has potential for future parties..  There was no DJ playing when I went, had music video mix going on that was mostly a mix of modern what i call \"hipster rock\" with once ina while a classic soul/funk tune thrown in, and once in a while a smashing pumpkins or depeche mode etc",

Anyways they'll make you what you want or something they recommend if you don't have anything in particular in mind. \u00a0Their drinks menu is solid and there drinks are deceptively strong, which to them is the perfect compliment. \u00a0  On slow nights, they'll let the patrons play their own music via iPone, iPad, etc. \u00a0They also have DJ nights, that spin mostly Deep House. \u00a0However, you can ask them to play something more upbeat, or more popular and they will. \u00a0One night (on my bday) the DJ went nuts and we had an awesome time!  On weekends and during bigger parties, they open up the top floor and back bar. \u00a0Giving it more of an Ultra Lounge feel. \u00a0  Its good to have a place where everybody knows your name.",

Free cover before 11PM if you sign up for the guest list (WARNING: It does fill up!)  Drinks: They have a pretty good list of specialty cocktails. Their signature drink list at the very bottom of the menu has some solid choices. The bartenders seem to know what they're doing because they do it well!  Ambiance: Cool, not divey, but not too upscale, either. Girls wear everything from cocktail dresses and heels to jeans and converses (though the latter was definitely an outlier). There's lots of booths lining the dance floor, but all of them were blocked off for tons of birthday parties (at least 5) and a bachelorette party. The music was also interesting. It was old school 90's music, but not all of them were the hits you would immediately remember and want to dance to... Oh well, you make the most of it!  Would I return? Maybe.",

It's all thanks to the pretentious prick who calls himself a \"bartender.\" I came here last Friday (1/17) to grab some drinks and catch up with friends. We were in the back bar area on the first floor, when I came up to the \"bartender\" to order a round of drinks for my group. He immediately made eye contact and nodded his acknowledgement of me. I courteously waited my turn, and when he was ready, I made my request. I got my drinks right away and showed my appreciation with a 25% tip.  When I found out that I had ordered the wrong drink for a friend, I came back to the bar. \u00a0The \"bartender\" acknowledged me, and I requested the correct drink. I was ready to pay for my own mistake, as I was standing around, holding my credit card. I saw him making 2 drinks, took a drink request from the group of girls that arrived AFTER me, saw him making drinks for them, and another drink or two for someone else. I tried to make eye contact, but he avoided me like the plague. My bf checked up on me to see why I was still waiting so long at the bar. Finally, I politely informed the \"bartender\" that I've been waiting for my drinks for quite a while. His reaction took me by surprise because I was being polite the entire time.  He hissed at me that he's in the services industry, and people in the services industry tend to forget. On top of that, he told me to find another bartender to make me my drinks!  Well, if you're in the services industry, and you see a customer lingering around trying to make eye contact with you, shouldn't you follow up with your customer to ensure that he/she's been taken care of? That's what I would do, as I was in the services industry myself. Nor would you ever stoop so low as to react in such an immature and unprofessional fashion, especially to a customer who was generous to you.  Being a bartender means servicing each and every customer with consistency and with the highest level of professionalism, not making fancy drinks to whomever you please and being a snot while you're at it. Perhaps you should learn what servicing is about before you call yourself a bartender.",

There's a bunch of good group seating options and it's not too loud to overpower a conversation (although I will disagree with their choice of music).  My only complaint is that the bartenders are the slowest I've encountered in my life (at least the ones working that night). Most bars I've been to, the bartender always seems like they're in a hurry and you're just short of wasting their time. The Raven bartenders have a more laid back attitude at the Raven which is good but it will take 15-20 minutes to get your drink (from the moment you order to getting the drink and your credit card back).",

I highly recommend their signature cocktail called The Raven. It's sweet, flavorful and has complex layer of flavor. I am also a big fan of The Basil of Death, Apple Poe, and the Caiprinha Noir. They have cheap well drinks and good beers on tap. It's a nice place to go for happy hour with $5 dollar wine, $4 wells and $4 draft beers. They have awesome, knowledgeable bartenders who are very friendly and who make you feel like you are the only one in the bar when you order a drink. They show care and attention to every cocktail they make. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Great for groups and partying on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday Night. It's also great for a quiet cocktail throughout the week.   Pros: Beautiful remodeled bar. Great for parties. Very good bartenders. Awesome cocktails. Cheap drinks. Smoking patio where you can bring drinks. Sweet bar and dance floor upstairs.   Cons: couldn't think of any.",

We danced for awhile upstairs, but it eventually got too crowded and stuffy up there, so we made our way downstairs. We ended up hanging out in the corner of the downstairs bar near the front door. This is where the real fun began!  Our bartenders were the best! They were super attentive and made amazing shots. They definitely gave VIP treatment to our bride-to-be!

I read online that they do free table reservations but of course being a procrastinator, by the time I planned everything they were booked out. I was exchanging emails with the person in charge of table reservations, and he was very polite, responsive and attentive. David put me on the wait list for a table in case of a cancellation or a no show.   Got to the place around 10 pm, no line at the door and if you get on the guest list, entrance if free before 11 pm. Even the guest list girl was super nice. My boyfriend was on the guest list twice so we thought we could put someone else's name instead of his once we got there. The girl said she couldn't do that, but instead she offered my second +1 a discount. How accommodating of her (as opposed to just shutting me down.)   Security was everywhere and they were all really nice. David eventually was able to accommodate me and my group with a table as one party left early! He was around all night and made sure everyone was having a good time! Props to that.  I must admit, that I feel that I got better service here, than at a place where I actually paid a lot of money for bottle service....  Music was amazing (a mix of old school and new stuff) and the bartenders poured really good drinks for reasonable prices! Overall I had a great time and me and my group really enjoyed ourselves.  Big shout out to David for taking very good care of me and my party! Will definitely be coming back!",

My girls and I got to dance freely without any contact from creepers (aside from a pair of sweaty drunk boys that I didn't realize were not gay).. but a lot of the guys on the dance floor got some action going on. You don't need details regarding that, but it was liberating to have our own space!   Love the layout of the bar, downstairs is lounge with two bar areas and some dance floor space, while upstairs is another dance floor with it's own bar. The music downstairs is a combo of top 40 + 90's (perfect!). The upstairs is more house music, but it's a lot more spacious for dancing. I spent most of my time upstairs until it got extremely hot \u00a0and the condensation fogged up the windows-- then I went downstairs and requested a song.. and the DJ played it 3x IN A ROW (prob to kill me). Gangnam style danced for 10+ minutes.   TRY THESE DRINKS: Fruity drink lovers, get the Liquid Marijuana (don't think it's on menu but seriously delish), the Apple poe (stronger on the alc), or Lychee Bliss.  Note: Not a fan of the Herbal Remedy drink.. it's taste is of Chinese herbal teas + basil. Quite bitter.  Overall, I really like this place- \u00a0lots of space for hanging out or dancing with your friends. Plus, very unique &amp; creative drink menu and no minimum requirement for table reservations.",

I was totally not diggin that...lol  So we decided to check out Raven's Bar instead and the ambience was pretty cool. It has a narrow layout with more floor space towards the back of the bar. At first, it seemed like the place was slightly crowded, but it was not overbearing. We ordered our drinks, which the bartender served right away. It's always a plus when bartenders serve drinks immediatley with minimal wait! And the pinot gris on the wine menu was definitely refreshing, just like our bartender recommended! Now that i look back on that night, i think he was the only bartender working. I'm pretty impressed the wait was not long to get a drink!   The music was pretty cool too. It was upbeat songs that were up to date, yet not to trashy or trancy or hippity hoppity (i think i just made up some words there...) To keep it simple, they were a mixture of songs you can hear on K-Fog, Alice and 94.9 strategically blended together with a smooth transition so each song doesn't clash and interrupt my intimate conversation with my friend!   Overall, it was a great night. Well deserved for me since i barely go out to bars nowadays. My friend and i had a great time (and we could actually hear ourselves talking) while we were well aware that everyone else at the bar enjoyed their party's company.   I wouldn't mind checking Raven's Bar again and doubt i would get sick of this place anytime soon.   Funny thing...i just found out it used to be a gay bar. But based on the environment from my first experience there, i would have never guessed it was a gay bar before!",

Leading up to the event, they clarified what we'd need for our presentation (which we had on a laptop). On the night itself, I arrived 40 mins early and was impressed at how organized they were - on hand were staff preparing the bar and an audio-visual pro (Mark), ready to setup the projector and mic.  The upstairs room has a separate entrance from Raven Bar, so the staff prepared a sign for my meetup outside and attendees had no problems finding us. The venue itself has a great AV setup (including DJ booth behind the bar). Being separate from the downstairs area means that you have a bar exclusively for your group - it's a very private space. Everyone at our meetup appreciated the personal service, not to mention, the very attentive staff. They even made sure there was good, upbeat music playing all evening - and at a good noise level, too.  Afterwards, one of our attendees mentioned that he'd be booking his birthday party at Raven Bar - for groups of up to 60 people, I'd say it's a fantastic space.  Overall, I can really recommend Raven Bar for customer events and meetups - they have the model well rehearsed and really made our evening a really memorable one. Thank you so much to David, Jonathan, Mark and the team - we will be back!",

It was my friend's wedding weekend and we decided to reserve the back area with a private bartender for free! for some pre-wedding festivities. The owner started the night off bartending and was very polite and met all of our needs, then the night shift started and the other bartenders were just as nice. There were a bunch of Russians in there so we definitely drank a lot of their booze and they didn't seem to mind our rowdiness which is a star itself. Beforehand they provded us with some caterers we can order from but another option was to bring our own food as well and no charge! So we got costco pizzas and a bunch of apps which turned out to be awesome.  I definitely recommend this place, especially for a private party. The owner and staff were friendly and their music was off the hook!  Thank you Raven Bar for treating the Russians with absolute fantastic customer service!",

    "review_text": "Sometimes you can judge how ratchet or crazy your night will be based on the TYPE of cup your drink comes served in. At raven, you get most of your mixed drinks in a plastic clear cup.   Details:  The Venue (3/5): Two story venue with two dance floors and bars. If you're signing yourself up for lung cancer, there's even a smoking patio outside connected to the club, so you don't have to go through the bouncers again. \u00a0I came at 11pm on a Friday and there was no cover and no line. When we left around 12:30am to go to another bar there was a line. At 11pm, the club was already poppin' on the inside. You'll find your pushing and shoving yourself to the bar or to finding yourself a place to boogie down on the dance floor or to wall flower. \u00a0Bathrooms both on the first and 2nd floor near the staircase.   I would recommend being careful in the staircases if you're a girl. A narrow, very dimly lit, crowded staircase with spilled drinks in heels isn't safe at all! The front staircase outside has lights lighting the steps, but not the back one. Another thing that I didn't particularly like about the venue is that drinks were getting spilled everywhere and the floor was wet and often gross and I didn't spot too many staff around cleaning things up and keeping things from just getting SLOPPY.   The crowd (2/5) : You see a lot of younger faces here - everybody looked like they had a newly minted fake or just crossed the line of 21. This isn't the financial district or marina crowd. There are a lot of RUDE people dancing like they don't care throwing arms everywhere, people who wouldn't let you through the crowd and a bunch of awkward asians taking selfies.   The music (4.5/5) : The DJ's do a good job of hitting a lot of hip hop/pop jams... but at the same time i'm in my mid 20's and i could barely recognize some of the oldies they played. Still good to whippin my hair back and forth though. \u00a0If you're looking for an EDM type vibe, it wasn't there. They had music videos playing on the walls on the second floor.   Bartenders (5/5) : One guy I swear looks like Ryan Gosling. They deserve an extra star for this. \u00a0The bartenders themselves are great. They make drinks quickly, don't ignore you, aren't snotty and serve the pretty people first. Only downside --- they bartenders pour just a little too much over the rim and most drinks just end up spilled everywhere. Well drinks and shots $7, pretty standard.   Verdict: The overall vibe at this place is one that could be summed up as: Divey, chic-ratchet, dancing on the line of \u00a0trashy and classy, yet a SOLIDLY fun night. Good bartenders, 2 dance floors, poppin' music will ensure you a fun night. Just remember to not accidentally fall on your butt, laugh at the awkward kids taking selfies, and whip your hair back n forth!",

    "review_text": "Not the BEST place to go in sf, but it does the job. I went to Raven for the first time for a friend's bday. At first, I was a little surprised by how much my friend emphasized signing up for the guestlist, getting there by ten so you don't have to pay cover, etc., because by 10:00, the place was still pretty light so I thought \"how popular could this be?\". However, by the time the clock struck midnight, I knew why she was so paranoid. The line was out the door till at least the end of the block and they weren't letting anybody in because they were filled till capacity. In the end, my other friends who came late and were waiting in said line decided to just go next door.  The Pros:  - Killer house cocktails (a big plus for me) - old school/throwback music (sometimes, you are in that mood!) - Nice-looking but casually-dressed crowd  The Cons:  - Lounge areas (while nice) are small and limited unless you have a reservation for the back area - Dance Floors are small, both of them (I like to dance and for a place that identifies as a \"dance club\", Raven Bar was really cramped) - the long lines (it sucked that my friends couldn't get in) - Cover (I just hate cover, period.)  The cons are enough to knock off a star for me. I realize that some things like the long lines are out of Raven's control but as for the cramped dance floors: if you are going to charge cover, I better enjoy myself and not have to worry about bumping into people and/or feeling trapped when I am dancing. Don't get me wrong, I will probably come back, because I don't know many places in sf that will play throwback songs, but I will definitely need to make sure that 1) I get there early and 2) I will spend most of my night there, two things that I generally do not enjoy.",

We came in a little late (10:15pm) and was glad to see that the table was still there, with a \"Happy Birthday\" sign hung on the wall - nice touch.  When we got there, the vibe was more chill. It wasn't packed and no one was dancing, though it was quite loud in there. The music was throwback 90s, which was great! Everybody seemed to enjoy themselves. We left around 11:00pm to stop by another bar in the area (WISH Lounge), but wasn't feeling it too much. Therefore, we made our way back to Raven about an hour later. At this point, people were starting to dance, though still not packed. Actually, I think it was only my group of friends who were dancing and singing to Gangnam Style (my friend requested it). We had a blast! Stayed here until 2am, and was sad that it was over :(  Would definitely come by again. See you soon, Raven! :)",

There are cool little corners you can collect your group, and as I recall, there were 3 bars, 2 on the ground floor, and one on the next floor up.   TheDJ beats were bumpin and thumpin, just up my ally as far as sounds, but can't say they have a lot of space to cut a rug with your best moves. Some flatscreens here and there with music videos mirroring the beats. \u00a0  Lotsa creative drink mixes for the ladies and the dudes that like to experiment. Me, I stick to what I know, thank you.   This places has a cool vibe, chill and relaxed, SOMA neighborhood. Perfect for those Techsters who grew up with \"That's So Raven\" on Disney, and even OK for their older siblings.   Their parents? If they saw the original The Raven movie with Vincent Price, that is too old for this Raven. But if they were Ravin when it first started back in the 80's, they may still like this Raven. But don't bet on it.   I Caw it like I see it!",

The staff was awesome- with the VIP room comes guest list of 10+ with no one paying a cover fee, private seating area upstairs with boots, and access to the dance floor without waiting in lines. The best part about all of this-- it was all done FREE. absolutely NO FEE to make large group reservations here.   We went on a Friday night because they have hip-hop DJs and we all love to dance. They played 90s hip hop music videos and we all had an awesome time.   The drinks were delicious and reasonably priced. Though, the BEST thing about this bar is that my girlfriend lost her phone that night---we called them the next day as a last ditch resort and to our shock and surprise THEY HAD HER PHONE! They worked with us and coordinated for us to pick up her phone the next afternoon.   I cannot say enough good things about the staff here and how great of a time we had. They respond to emails in a timely manner, are professional, fun to deal with, and honest and respectful when it comes to your personal items.   We'll definitely be back. Best place to dance on a Friday night- by far. Thank you!!!",

    "review_text": "I came to Raven for a friend's birthday and I would definitely consider coming back!   I recommend singing up for the guestlist as soon as as you decide on coming because they do close the guestlist once it's full. Better safe than sorry! Expect to wait awhile if you come closer to 11pm when guestlist closes. A girl was checking the line and stamping those on the guestlist. My friends and I got our stamps but still had to pay $10 right at 11pm. What's the point of stamping everyone then?  The music here is pretty good for the most part! They played old school 90's/early 2000's and hip hop. I will say that the music started off great but worsened to obscure songs the longer I was there... to the point where my friends and I were confused as to how to even dance to certain a songs. Perhaps that's how they get people to leave towards the end of the night.  As for drinks, my friends and I had bottle service and they were nice enough to check to make sure the mixers were refilled. I had their lychee cocktail which was refreshing! Not your typical watered down, 75% ice drink.   - As a side note, the crowd here is primarily Asian.  - They do have a free coat check, so take advantage of that.  - Parking can be difficult, as expected in the city.  - The dress code here is relaxed, so no need to bust out a dress and heels unless you want to!  Overall, Raven has great drinks and music so I would recommend checking it out on your next night out in the city.",

The music got better and it all of a sudden became extremely crowded. The dance floor upstairs was packed that they closed the staircase to go upstairs.

The most action they get these days are from vibrators...vibrations from their better half's anal acoustics that is.  Been there, done that for nearly 10 years. Never again.  Last week, the plan was to watch a movie but I was insistent in going out. It was a Friday night after all and Mr. Fernet was calling my name.  A quick Yelp search leads me to Raven. Two visits in 8 days. That's how much I love this low key venue that's part speakeasy, part lounge, and part nightclub.  COVER Free. Zero. Nada.   DRESS CODE None. Whooo hoo, I can wear my granny panties and my frumpy flats!  COAT CHECK $2 on second level.  BAR/DRINKS 3 bars. Shots were a reasonable $7-$8 a pop. Specialty cocktails are $9-$10. The bartenders are very nice but more are needed upstairs on a Saturday night (there were 2) because drinks took a while. CC's accepted with no minimum.  Happy Hour is Monday - Saturday from 4-7 pm: $1 off specialty cocktails, $4 wells, $4 drafts, and $5 house wine.  CROWD Friday night was chill with a mix of older tech nerds and the badminton club. Saturday night was cracking with a very mixed late 20s to early 30s crowd. No hipsters unlike Bloodhound next door. No sleazy douchebags. No pretentious Marina princesses. ME LIKEY.  MUSIC VJ DJ Mark plays Top 40s, Rap, Hip Hop, EDM, Pop, and Old School music videos on the numerous flat screen TVs and huge projection screen TV upstairs. Shake your money maker/hokey pokey/cabbage patch/crunk/fist pump to Florida's \"I cry\", Swedish House Mafia's \"Don't you worry child\", Bell Biv DeVoe's \"Poison\" and MJ's \"Billie Jean\". Or sing horribly to Jackson 5's \"I want you back\" and Taylor Swift's \"You belong to me\"...*ahem ahem* Mr. NSS. =X  AMBIANCE/DECOR Long, narrow speakeasyish bar downstairs (super crowded) with a back lounge area, a second bar, and a small dance floor. Upstairs is \"Club Raven\" with a small couch area, a third bar and a dance floor equipped with fluorescent lighting and a smoke machine. The outdoor patio/smoking area is on the first level.  RESTROOMS I love dancing but not doing the pee pee dance because there's only one stall upstairs. Although I heard there are several stalls downstairs, MORE stalls upstairs please!  PARKING Easier street parking on the 7th and 8th streets as opposed to Folsom.  I had a blast at Raven the both times I've been and it was the most action I got in a long, long time. My bad for my anal acoustics ruining the mood.   Note to self: Mr. Lactaid and Mr. Beano are my bffs and Mr. NSS'. ( ^ _ ~ )",

    "review_text": "I would have given Raven 3 stars had the staff not been total pricks.   This place is fun because it's truly a group of misfits. Lots of birthday party groups and bachelorette parties. Everyone has a good time because they are out with their friends and it's not really a \"scene\" of any sort. The music is old school, which I think is a hit because half of the crowd seemed to be made up of people who were probably saying to each other, \"Oh my god! I haven't been to a club in 10 years!\" They let in just about anyone. All ages, ethnicities, sizes, types, etc.   The venue is pretty low budg. Kind of like a diner that turns into a club at night. The tables are something you would see in an airplane or on a boat. Very narrow to try and make more room in the middle area dance floor thing. In most clubs this would just be the entry way into another room, but it was the dance floor here.   I had a fun time with my friends because our crowd was similar to the one I described in my first paragraph. We could have been anywhere and had fun. My friends ordered bottle service, of which the items barely fit on our table.   You are probably asking, why only 1 star then??? That seems a little harsh. Well, because the bouncers and bus boy were horrendous. Considering my friends dropped a lot of cash at the place, we got less than par service. The one guy who was cleaning our table kept going over the couches where our purses and jackets were. He kept clearing glasses and drink before they were empty. This is a huge pet peeve of mine!!! We had 3 bottles of Vueve, a bottle of vodka, and whisky. DON'T TAKE OUR DRINKS WHEN THEY ARE HALF FULL. Period. It is so basic. This guy took so much of our alcohol, it was insulting. Then in his mission to clear our table every few minutes, drops a glass under the table (because of course he was on the couch/seat side), it shatters and we all feel glass hit our ankles, and wetness because .... yep, you guessed it, the glass wasn't empty because he was clearing a half full cocktail. He then proceeded to look up and say, \"don't worry, I got it.\" Uh...YA! I hope so. I'm not trying to be a pretentious bitch, but come on. No apology and then implying that he's doing us a favor by cleaning up the glass shards from the drink he dropped.   The last straw was that we were leaving and I told this same little shit that we would be heading out and could he get the caps to the bottles. He literally flips out on me, and starts screaming like he is ready to fight me. Super rude and sarcastically he said, \"Are you serious?! Are you serious?! ARE YOU REALLY FUCKING SERIOUS?! I dont' think so! You really think I'm that dumb. If I see you take this bottles out of here, I will get your ass.\" .... uhhhhhhhhhhh......ME = STUNNED. WTF just happened?? Oh my god. Not sure if he was on meth or what, but he freaked out. Ok, I just learned it's against the law to do that. I didn't realize that because other places must have turned a blind eye.   The next thing we know he has another bouncer and the manager. The bouncer comes over putting a flash light in our eyes. He was more calm, but still SUPER CONFRONTATIONAL. He stood about 3 inches from me and my friend asking us what our problem was, etc. To be honest it was quite embarrassing. Unfortunately, my drunken friend had already left with a bottle and was outside the bar. So, thinking that we were plotting against all of them, which we were not, and just wanted to be compliant, the little crazy one went outside and started yelling again and running up to her like he was going to attack my friend (honestly, I hope this is just a weird night) and the other flashlight guy came out too. In their toughest, scariest voices told my friend to stop, and then searched her body and purse and got the bottle. She had no idea what had gone on in the club, so was like a deer in headlights. After they got the bottle, the little guy continued to scream and yell at us as we were leaving. He was jumping up and pointing at us with his finger saying stuff like, \"That's right. You thought you were going to get away with this. I'm 24 and I'm smarter than you!\" (He actually said the thing about being 24 and smarter than us).  I hope that this was a one-time unfortunate fluke. However, it was one of the most aggressive, unnecessarily confrontational events. It was weird and left a nasty taste in my mouth. Oh, the main a$$hole guy I was taking about is about 5'7\" or 5'8\", half white, half African American, he's a bar back or bus boy type person, almost shaved head (very short hair). If you see him, run for the hills!",

David was very helpful in the process to get a booth reserved for the co-birthday celebration with my friend and I. A couple months before the date I emailed him and he assured me a prime booth spot. He also mentioned emailing me a sign up list a week before the date so all my guests could have free entry into Raven all night. Awesome!  After having a celebratory dinner at Radius down the block, we walked to Raven, waited in line for a bit to check-in, and headed inside. The place was rockin' as usual. I spotted David and he led us to a wonderful booth in the main area. He introduced us to Larry who would be snapping photos all night and we could grab him if we wanted any photos taken of us.  There is bottle service available should you choose. We chose to buy our own drinks instead with 2 bars, front and back, on the main floor and one long bar upstairs. Although the main dance floor with the flashing lights and occasional burst of fog is upstairs, people do get their groove on in the area between the booths on the 1st floor.  It was a wonderful time had by all thanks to David and the crew at Raven. I have been back and will continue to do so.",

I think I must have tried nearly every cocktail on the menu by now, but generally, I just let the awesome bartenders mix up whatever drink they can think up for me or are experimenting with. \u00a0  Overall, this place is for keeps!!! \u00a0Def recommend this bar for anyone looking for a place to hang out with friends in a chill, non-douchey atmosphere. \u00a0If you want to reserve a space for an event, this is also a great place - they don't charge a reservation fee!",

The music was awesome. 90s hits all night long made me feel like a kid again. So fun and it's awesome that they have the music videos playing a long with the songs, a blast from the past! The dancing can get a little crowded, but what good dance floor doesn't?!   Now onto the drinks. The bar is crowded but when you can get to the bad it's awesome. All the bar tenders are great and when you tell them to \"surprise you\" with a drink, they really do and it's always great! The bartenders know their stuff!  The one thing I didn't like was that I had a personal guestlist with my friends on it but they only had 1 line outside. My friends would wait in the long line but raven said they would go trough the line and ask if ppl were on the list so that they would get in faster. This was not the case. This is the only thing that upset me. Otherwise it was a great place and I can definitely see myself going back!",

My friends and I were scrambling to get party flavors thinking Raven Bar would only offer the minimal. But I am so glad we weren't able to get any! (We went to BK beforehand to get food, and desperately took some BK crowns for plan b...) When we entered, they had the exact party favors we wanted. 2015 tiaras and eyeglasses! You should've seen the looks on our faces.. priceless.   Even though we had a big group, we decided against getting a table. Online it said we only needed to get one bottle, but when my friend was contacted, she was told 2. No thanks, we don't need that much to have fun anyways.   For drinks, most of us got their Lychee Bliss, Ciroc peach vodka, Chambord, Cointreau, lychee, orange. I was really surprised they used real lychee rather than syrup! It was really good, and it was topped off with a lychee piece, a plus! My other friend got their Herbal Remedy, Zubrowka bison grass vodka, St. Germain, lime, apple, agave &amp; muddled basil. I took a sip and it was light and refreshing!   For the dance area, we went to the second floor. It was the perfect amount of people, not too crowded but not too empty. It was packed by midnight though. And wow, their type of music was totally in our zone. Literally, throwback Thursday. From 90's to today's hit, every song was on point!   A few downsides. They expected us to carry the champagne drink ticket till midnight. I wish they had a better way of issuing that, because my friend misplaced hers early in the night and we couldn't do anything about it. Security would've been helpful on the second floor, there was a guy smoking in the corner in the midst of the fog machine and it was gross.   Overall, it wasn't too bad but could've been better. In the end, we all had a good time.   P.S. They only have one bathroom! So the wait might take a while.  They have free coat checks on the second floor.",

Thanks, David, for giving me the upstairs tour, and adorable/charming Julien for all the ice refills! ;) Definitely true professionals who love what they do. You can see it in their eyes.

Cons - Sucks we had to wait in line just to get upstairs where the dance floor was.  - Bathroom lines are crazy upstairs (don't understand why only have one for each gender). - It really just wasn't my type of scene since it seemed like the crowd was around the ages of 25-35.

    "review_text": "Have you ever met someone who was so passionate about their job that they had the ability to make their work look exciting? The Raven has arguably one of the best bartenders in town. Watching David mix drinks is like watching Magic Johnson in the 1980's thread a pass; he's precise and does it with a smile. I witnessed this guy take five cocktail orders at one time, carefully make them, all while keeping the other patrons at the bar happy by chatting with them. The guy could probably be a pilot.  If you want to see perfection in the art of mixology, then watch David prepare one of his signature Vampire Slayers or a more traditional Old Fashioned. He's fast but never sloppy, and meticulous with peeling the twist and prepping the rim.   Not only is David good at what he does, but he's incredibly friendly and strives to make sure his patrons are happy; whether it's a simple gesture of greeting people, asking how your cocktail is, or if you're okay with the channel the TV is on. If you own a bar or are thinking of owning a bar, I'd go and observe this guy. More important than his knowledge of spirits is how he treats his customers.  I went on a Thursday for their happy hour. The prices were very reasonable; $8 for specialty cocktails, $4 draft beers, and $4 well drinks. They also have a menu for food from Triptych which they'll bring over from next door. Upstairs at around 9:00, a Video DJ spins and projects music from the 90's, not to be confused with a VeeJay (i.e. Bill Bellamy, Daisy Fuentes, Kennedy, Idalis, etc.) \u00a0He mixes music and the accompanying videos. Pretty awesome. I've never seen anything like it.  The bar fills up pretty quickly, which is to be expected with their drink specials and their service. The crowd was also pretty diverse, from tech people to Burning Man attendees who were doing fund raising. Seems like the type of place where you would feel comfortable enough to strike up a conversation with just about anyone.  My one complaint would be the server who didn't ask if we needed change for the food from Triptych. She just assumed it was hers to keep and off she went without even saying thank you.",

I decided to celebrate my birthday here as well, did my research, checked out their website, etc. I got intouch with the General Manager David, who explained the details of hosting an event here. Since this was my first experience having a table at Raven's Bar, I assumed in order to reserve a table you would need to purchase a bottle which you didn't, unlike most places! I ended up purchasing a bottle anyways, since I thought it would be well worth it. I love how they didn't try to rob you for your money when throwing a party here. They offer free coat check all night which is amazing!   Ok, now that you know Raven does not try to rob you for your money, I want to share my overall experience last Friday night for my birthday. A group of my friends and I arrive a little before 10pm, no lines no list yet, which was quick and easy. (I suggest getting there early to hold your table). I get to my table and they had a \"Happy Birthday\" sign in my area and signs saying \"reserved for Gracielle's party\" (totally VIP) we got our wrist bands to get upstairs. The bartenders were super nice and I must say the whole staff was too!!! Ok, not only did they make my party VIP exclusive, and special. David also gave me extra VIP cards for next time and a Happy Birthday card/Thank you note for celebrating with them! Wait, there's more, David also gave me a \"Birthday Girl\" tiara! Which I thought was so sweet and super cute!   I honestly, have never been in such an epic bar/lounge like this one! This place is awesome! The only thing I could possibly wish for is more restrooms and for them to renovate to a bigger bar. Because it can get really hot and extremely crowded inside. Other than that, the service is great, ambience is great, music is great, and of course the alcohol is great! ;)",

So I went to Raven Bar once in August when my friend was DJ'ing there and immediately knew I wanted to have my birthday party there (which wasn't until November!) Everything about the ambiance made it appealing to me -- I'm not a big fan of the club scene at all, and especially not for hosting my own birthday at one. That's why I love Raven because it's more of a bar feel than anything, with the upstairs almost like a little lounge.  Anyways, so I made reservations to host my birthday in November and the manager, Vince, was more than helpful. He booked me the upstairs private seated area two months in advance and not to mention everything was free. No charge for the table, no charges for bottle service, no mandatory spending amount -- nothing! It's not common you find a lounge with perks like this. Oh and I got there and there were two huge \"happy birthday\" banners in our section as well.. so sweet. Anyways, all in all, after my party last night I can honestly say it was one of the best nights out I have had.   Only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars was because of the music. When we first got there it was around 10:45 and they had been playing 80's club music for a good hour. Later I found out this was the DJ's specialty. I actually went up to the booth to ask him if he had more of a selection for the rest of the night. Around 11:30 the vibe changed to mostly top 40's and some random 90's songs (TLC- Waterfalls, lol). Anyways, I would have wanted more house music but it's okay, all in all it was an awesome night and it's always fun dancing to top 40's as well so I can't complain.  Great experience and I really suggest Raven Bar!",

Drinks are on the pricy side for their signature cocktails, but I think that their concoctions are worth it...my friend destroyed the lychee bliss..nearly chugged it actually because it was so good.  What I didn't realize until later was that there was a video DJ upstairs - basically it's a relatively small dance floor with music videos and a DJ mixing 90's rap w/ EDM w/ top 40 and old school pop. A very eclectic variety, but it was so fun just to goof off on the dancefloor with friends to songs old, new, and plain interesting. That mix PLUS the wall-sized projection of the music videos themselves AND the cool laser lights entertained us for quite a while. It did get pretty crowded and hot toward the end of the night, but again, pretty surprised that Raven turned out to be a really fun night!",

A mix of 80s/90s/early 2000s, hip hop, pop, etc. A lot of my favs. Plus I do love dancing!  It can get crowded, so if you'd like to dance the night away, get there early so you can get upstairs. There's a bar and dance floor there. They only let a certain number of people up there at a time, so the line can get a little long. Downstairs, it's a little more loungy, but it can get super stuffy when crowded. I found myself out in the smoking patio for the last hour or so since I needed air.  Not sure if there's a cover, but we were on a table guest list and got in for free. We did show up early though. Around 10p.  Again great music and a nice vibe. Given my old age, I almost skipped going to Raven since I felt too old for the club scene. I'm glad I didn't!",

My friends and I tried out a few of their signature cocktails made with fresh fruit juices and their beers on tap. \u00a0They have three full bars, a DJ with dancing upstairs and plenty of space for hanging out. \u00a0 I really liked the music they played - not too loud and created just the right vibe for a fun time, but then again I was here during the day when the space wasn't too crowded. \u00a0The drinks are very reasonably priced ($5 for draught beers) and they carry a good variety of wines, beers and liquor.   A huge plus are the super nice bartenders. \u00a0Not only did they remember the crazy complicated request from one friend but they were fast, efficient, funny and down to earth, \u00a0No attitudes to be found here. \u00a0A great place to hang out and relax with friends. \u00a0I cannot wait to make a return visit!",

The Vampire Slayer with Bulleit Rye, citrus, bitters and \"cherry-orange flavors\" was heavy on the last ingredient, but not totally out of balance. Similarly, the Anchors Away had a bit too much cherry flavor for more than one, but $1 off the signature cocktails was enough for us to look something else to try.   Unfortunately, the bartender got wrapped up in a conversation with another patron, so despite having 25 minutes before needing to leave for dinner (and despite indicating we were interested in another round), we had to eventually just ask for the tab and go. I'd hate to see what happens to service when the place gets more than 3 customers in it.",

    "review_text": "Maybe it's just (the grossly immature 10 year old in) me, but as we walked into Raven, I just wanted to start screaming, \"CAW! CAW!\" at the top of my lungs. \u00a0Fortunately for me, my friends, and everyone within shouting distance, I restrained myself, for fear of overly embarrassing the birthday girl. \u00a0(Side note: And no, not as some sort of mating call to attract the ladies, as my friend suggested. \u00a0Plus, if it did work, I would have some serious questions about those girls...).  Over the last year or so, Raven has, for better or worse, become quite a popular spot in SoMa. \u00a0The only reason why I say \"worse\" is that, despite having two floors, the place isn't all that spacious. \u00a0In fact, it gets really cramped really fast, so arriving earlier is better. \u00a0While we were able to walk right upstairs (with no cover), our friends arrived 45 minutes later and had to wait in line downstairs. \u00a0Thus, once you make it upstairs, stay there.   Since we spent pretty much the entire night on the upper level, I can't speak to what the lower level is like. \u00a0 Upstairs though, there's a good amount going on - more of a club-ish vibe, with a decently sized bar, a handful of tables, bathrooms, and a modest sized dance floor. \u00a0The highlight though might have been the music (and the lax dress code), which was mostly top-40 and hip-hop ranging from 90's hits to today.  If it weren't for how uncomfortably crowded the upper level got, and if my friends and I were still into the scene, I'm sure I'd be an advocate for returning to Raven. \u00a0It certainly doesn't hurt that there's a Mission Dog Cart right outside either. \u00a0In this case though, Raven Bar was just fine for a quick hit-and-run for a birthday party, and far more appealing than some of the clubs and venues we used to go to.  THREE AND A HALF rounded down.  CAW!",

(I just felt a great disturbance in the force; as if millions of women just sighed in relief and were suddenly elated. I fear something terrible has happened to my mojo).  A rather large group of us commandeered the entire back bar for a friend's B-Day Bash and that was pretty awesome. We were so thick back there that others attempting to use the bar really had to work for it.  The whole place was packed. The dance floors upstairs and down were really jumping; but they are a bit on the small side (which is why my awkward white butt stayed off it... Think \"Elaine\" from Seinfeld, but more spastically jerky, less rhythm, and none of her classy moves).  The two bartenders at OUR bar were really hustling and I was impressed with how fast they were shaking/pouring because there really were a lot of us and they kept up pretty well under the pressure. The prices were really reasonable and the tab at the end was much better than expected; so that just made the night even better.  The music was a pretty decent mix (which should tell you nothing because I can't dance, so what the hell do I know, right?) with a range of house and 80's on up. And, this will seem really weird, but it seemed as though the music got better and better as we drank more and more; I think the drinks might be magic...  ... come to think of it, everyone got better and better looking at the same rate - OMG, the drinks ARE magic! ...  I recommend - Go check 'em out.",

Cognac is typically not in any mixed drinks (for obvious reasons), but he made a special drink for my girl - which actually tasted great. I ordered drinks from ONLY him, because his customer service was one of the best I've seen at any club or bar. Management needs to promote this guy or give him a raise.

Mediocre bar food - that's not true, it was definitely better than the usual greasy bar food. Polenta stars, tuna tartare on fried wonton chips. I guess I shouldn't expect too much from a bar. It's also a bar bar - like from what you thought bars were like when you were in your 20's. I think this is a sign I'm too old for this place.",

    "review_text": "I chose Raven Bar as the venue for my birthday party because my best friend had her birthday here a couple of years ago and it was so much fun. This time around it was even better!  Booking a table is FREE, no bottle service is required, and you get to have up to 19 people on a private guest list for free entry all night! Reserving a space was super easy. I filled out an online request form 2-3 weeks before the event and I received an e-mail from David the General Manager a few days later. We finalized the details of the reservation and he answered all my questions through e-mail. It was very quick and easy. AND on the day of my party David came up to my booth and personally greeted me. I even got a birthday tiara and a card with 2 VIP passes.   My party was the Saturday after Thanksgiving so it was pretty packed. Me and a small group from my party arrived around 9-930. It wasn't crowded that early in the night but definitely filled up later on, but I had a pretty big group with me so we held down our space haha. There was a little bit of a wait for the line to go upstairs to the main dance floor but a friend of mine was able to talk to \"a guy\" who spoke to the bouncer guarding the stairs and he got a group of us to skip the line. I LOVE the music the play at Raven Bar! A lot of throwbacks. The drinks are average price for an SF bar but very good. One of the best places for Midori Sour.   All in all I had an amazing time and all of my friends they had a lot of fun too. I will definitely be coming back to Raven Bar and also recommend it to others!",

    "review_text": "I've been to Raven a handful of times now and it's been fun every time. The place is definitely not an upscale/Vegas type club with all the bells and whistles. As a matter of fact, its the exact opposite. The dress code is very casual and almost everyone gets in free with guest list if you show up around 10. It's not a very big place but it is two levels, which is nice if you want a change of scenery.   Every Thursday they have 1990s VS Y2K, playing 90s music upstairs and popular music from the 2000's downstairs. I managed to make it out one Thursday (July 4th weekend, so no work Friday) and it was pretty fun. It brought me back to my college days with the 90s music. Also, it's free all night long on Thursdays.  I love the music they play at Raven. Most clubs nowadays play EDM and there are so few that play hip hop, let alone old school hip hop. I like many just can't really dance to EDM unless I'm completely plastered, so it's nice that Raven sticks to hip hop.   Another great thing about this place is the tables are free as long as you request them in advance. But they do fill up quickly, so plan ahead! Bottle service is optional, but a pretty decent price.   The crowd here is fairly mixed in terms of ethnicity and age. I don't think there is one target audience, so that's pretty nice.   The drinks are decently priced, about $8-10 for a cocktail. They have a wide array of specialty drinks too, but I have yet to try them.   So if you are looking for a nice casual place to have a few drinks with your friends, dance it off to some hip hop with a mixed crowd, this is the place for you. Don't come here if you are looking for an upscale Vegas like club where all the girls are wearing skin tight dresses and heels. You'd have better luck at The Grand or Origin.",

If you are looking for a place to eat beforehand, because you know you will need the food to absorb things, I recommend Basil Thai Restaurant, which is like a 30 sec walk from Raven.   Since my party was 10+ people i emailed the bar a week before so that i could reserve a booth. The reservation process was super simple! I just emailed the bar and the next day i got a reply from the general manager, who was super nice and chill. Since Raven doesn't require a fee for reservations, minimum bar tab, or bottle service, it is very nice on your wallet. You can save the extra money for the yummy cocktails they offer. However, if you wanted bottle service you can always get it at the place too. The bottle service girl was super friendly, helpful, and showed some of the girls in my party a thing or two on how to have some fun on the dance floor.   The music was so-so. We went on a Saturday and the music selection was old school and top 40's. I am not a fan of the EDM or House music so I opted for the stuff i hear on the radio (instead of grooving in the car i can now dance it out in a club). We got to Raven at 10 pm and the old school music was a little too old school for us. Which was okay because then we could just focus on what drinks to get. Fortunately , around 12 am until closing the music became a little less old school and more of the recent stuff we all know and love from the radio. They also have a bigger dance floor upstairs, so you can strut more of your stuff.   Since it was my birthday celebration, i blacked out probably 3 hours after i got to Raven, so i don't remember much after i hit the dance floor. Surprise Surprise. However, the next morning all my guest told me how happy they were at the club and how cute and friendly all the staff at Raven was to all of us.   Bottom line: If you are looking for a club to go to, Raven should be one to check out! Great drinks for a very decent price and plenty of dancing room for all. Plus the staff was really great! Definitely coming back here again, but sober for the most part!",

When we asked various staff where he could be found we were scoffed at and told to wait. When David was finally located (in the apparent vast enormity of Raven Bar), we were told there was no seating available. We got 2 drink tickets for a group of 4 which just seemed like an embarrassingly charitable pat on the back.  At one point David came back and told us a table had just cleared up and that we would finally be able to buy a bottle (seriously? all I want is to GIVE you my money, can it really be this hard?). But surprise! By the time David had made his rounds and spoken to every single one of his friends on our way to \"our\" table it had already been taken. What's more? You cannot purchase a bottle when you do not have a table.   I'm never going back. This place is a joke.",

Theres no cover charge before 11 if you sign-up on the GL on their website, and its $10 if not. I really loved how friendly Christopher the bartender upstairs was and he engaged in great conversation with my friend and I before things got busier in the bar. The drink he made me was one of the best I've had in a while so that was a major plus! Once the crowd started picking up things got packed quick and we started noticing that it wasn't very diverse..

The drinks aren't cheap, the location is a little further from BART than I usually like to be, and I thought the description was a bit off. If Edgar Allen Poe and Humphrey Bogart were to meet for a drink, they'd probably go to Rick House, Local Edition, or even Vesuvio. But this place? Likely not.  It's an okay spot- it's trendy, and had a good bartender in the back who must have injected a RedBull into his forearm before coming in for his shift.

Guest list always fills up by Tuesday or Wednesday so I would recommend signing up early if you're trying to make guest list.   Last night we went to parlor first then hopped on over to raven at around 11:30pm. There was still a line and it took about 15 mins to get in. I had to use the bathroom so I asked the bouncer if I could run in while my friends waited in line and he was nice enough to let me in, but he held onto my ID for collateral. Fair enough.   It was pretty crowded from what I remember, there was a line to get upstairs to the larger dance floor. Upstairs is usually packed with people. The dance floor is off to the side at the end of the bar. It's pretty small but there's always a good amount of people dancing. The music is great to dance to, mostly 90's hip hop. I'm so glad it's not all EDM. I don't believe there's a DJ but they play music videos on the wall next to the dance floor. Pretty cool, although it doesn't always match up with the song lol.   They have a few tables downstairs and one section upstairs to book. Although it's a fun place to wander around and meet new people. They have an outdoors smoking section which is a great place to get some fresh air when it gets crowded inside. The smoking section is pretty well ventilated so it doesn't reek of smoke either.   Dress code is pretty casual. But you won't stick out if you decide to wear a dress and heels. They have coat check upstairs and bathrooms upstairs and downstairs. My friends and I will probably be back in the near future (:",

The crowd was not really my scene and they were playing throwback music. I love throwback songs, just not at bars/ clubs.   These kind of bars confuse me. Is it a bar? or a club? because the space is so small that theres no room for people that lounge and stand about and the people that want to dance. So then the \"dance floor\" gets all awkward because theres like the 3 drunk guys and girls that are just whipping their hurr back and forth...... into other people that are completely not on that level. hahaha.   Anyways yes so these bar/lounge/dance places are not the type of place for me. I used to enjoy these when I was younger but I have since moved on.",

The music was tepid. The place smelled weird. Most of all I thought the crowd was too old (No offence meant). Normally you'd find a mix of people across age groups but here I found almost everybody was above 30. Clearly that leads to a very different dynamic in a club and one which I do not enjoy too much.  They do have a lot of space so thats definitely a plus. I did not end up having any drinks (since I did not like the place at all) so cant really give my comments there.",

No bottle service fee, no minimum amount of guests, no minimum amount of drinks to get! Music to our ears, haha. But wait, I'm not done, it gets better! With a table reservation you have your own guest list, and everyone you add to your guest list gets in for free ($10 cover).   There are two levels in this place, the upstairs seeming to be the much more crowded area. Our table was downstairs where the dance floor was much more open. There are 2 bars downstairs so that was great. I think there is only 1 bar upstairs.  90's, 90's, 90's!! This place really takes you back with all the 90s music. They play music videos downstairs and I remember seeing Criss Cross, 2 Pac, Salt n Pepper, and Digital Underground (oh yeah, Humpty Hump, you know what it is).  We eventually went upstairs to dance because it had more people and a DJ. The music upstairs was a mix between old school and new stuff, we liked it. They go a little crazy with the fog machine IMO.  Due to all the perks you get when reserving a table I would highly recommend this place!",

Not entirely sure why but I couldn't even put my gifts in the car which was parked 10 feet away. A friend of mine just went outside to make a phone call and she couldn't come back in, even though she was standing at the door and had a stamp. 2. Luckily I got there early enough to not pay a cover or wait in line but my party got stuck in line and even though I was promised a certain amount of my guests would get in for free but security wouldn't let them in. Apparently the line outside didn't even move and not sure why they weren't letting anymore guests in. Didn't feel as if the place was at capacity. 3. Only one bathroom stall downstairs for the ladies even though the men has two! No need to say more, I'm sure you can imagine the line and wait.  The music was nice and we had fun but it could have been better if my entire party was allowed to celebrate with me.  Oh, and if you want reservations, please do it at least a week in advance!",

A wide selection from Top 40 hits now and from 1999. \u00a0It was a random mix but I had fun nonetheless. \u00a0The scene is fun and being in my mid-twenties, it was fun dancing and signing to to songs from when I was in middle school. \u00a0Songs from BSB, Britney Spears, Jagged Edge. It puts a smile to my face now as I am typing this because these songs are so old but once you hear the first note, you start singing along as if you heard it the day before. \u00a0Drinks are average, the bartenders are pretty quick and attentive. \u00a0Didn't have to wait too long to get a bartender's attention. Restrooms can get crowded. \u00a0Doesn't matter if you try the ones upstairs or downstairs, you will still probably have to wait.

There is a total of three bars, two downstairs and one upstairs so make sure to get your drink on. Music varies with the nights. The lighting is a little tacky and if there's a party, the Happy Birthday decorations and balloons just makes it worse. As far as the drinks go, they have a huge selection across all three bars but only the front one makes their specialty drinks. Herbal Remedy and Hazel Eyes were good but not outstanding.

It was about 7pm when a clutch of Yelpfolk about 12 strong descended upon the Raven Bar to enthuse and amuse. The bar staff were really cool about the sudden influx and there was plenty of space at the bar for us to sit occupy. I actually sat on a bar stool and talked to strangers, which was awesome. I love America.  The bar itself is really nice - the bottles at the back are nicely lit and arranged, and it was good fun to watch cocktails being prepared skilfully. The bar stool was extremely comfortable - I was there for a good couple of hours without fidgeting, which is quite something for me, and the back room, which I didn't really enter, seemed at once spacious and cosy - quite an achievement. I do wish I'd seen upstairs as the photos on the website look wonderful.  The toilets leave a little to be desired - a bit poky and rickety - but overall this is a really nice bar that I hope to return to next time I'm in San Francisco!",

First, the most positive thing about the place is the nice friendly bouncer who stands outside. Unfortunately, it is all downhill after him.   I shall be succinct: The drinks are weak. From time to time filthy transients made their way in to requests water or something while scratching as if they had pockets full of ants and we were all on alert to watch our personal belongings. The bartenders were only moderately friendly. In fact, they could not wait to go home, evidenced by the fact that at exactly 1:59 am they ordered us to put our drinks on the table and they stopped the music mid-song. \u00a0The DJ was pathetic. He refused requests and played the same house music beat over and over. At one point I offered the bartender our IPod so we could hear a decent song and he actually acquiesced!

I've been here on two different nights:  -Saturday: Packed. Make sure you sign up for their guest list early so you can get in for free. Otherwise, you have to arrive before a certain time to avoid cover or pay a discounted cover. Once it hits 11 the line starts getting crazy long though, so coming early is your best bet. They also restrict entry to the second floor when it starts getting too packed, and it gets difficult to find parking. -Thursday: They play some good old school jams, but it wasn't very crowded at 10pm (the upstairs was dead). However, there is no cover and plenty of parking.  I've heard Raven is also packed on Friday nights, so this is the place to go on the weekends if you're looking to dance to good hip hop music.",

Saturday.... now that's where the real party is at. Almost every booth is reserved for someone's birthday! And if you're the birthday guy/gal, you'll receive some VIP tickets I heard. If you're going Saturday, make sure to get on the guest list for that day before Friday... once it fills up the link disappears. It's free admission until 11 if you're on guest list, otherwise it's $10.   Drinks are a decent price. Not too expensive. I mean a glass of beer was $6 and their signature drinks are their mojitos (around $10?). I have to say those mojitos... are too sweet to my liking. But my girlfriends loved them and constantly had one in hand - whether it be a regular mojito or strawberry infused mojito etc. etc. The bartenders are nice and A+ for hearing our orders when wearing ear plugs!   It can get really crowded even though it's a two story place. Ground floor has two bars - one right when you enter and one all the way in back. And the second floor has one bar. Free coat \u00a0check on the second floor. But when it gets packed the security guard limits the amount of people that gets to go upstairs. You may have to fight your way up (;   Come check the place out! I guarantee you won't be disappointed! And if you didn't drive, don't worry. Taxis pass by the place all the time.

He suggested for them to coat check some jackets, etc. Unlike other places, they actually want you IN THE BUILDING! They played mostly your late 90's and early 2000's hip-hop music and this place gets crowded. I would suggest for you to show up around 10PM so, you wouldn't have to wait in line just to go to the upper level which was craccccckinnnnn'. This place is small as other reviewers had mentioned, but it isn't tiny. You have enough room to chit chat with your groups of friends while you shake your bootay. I'm glad I gave this place a try. Parking wasn't too bad either and there is a $10 cover. If you don't want to deal with any bullshitting bouncers, come here!",

Was pretty awesome.  Then I came here for evening fun, and had a great time too! And...realized that this was where Dragon used to be. Wow...I'm so old and out of it. o.O We came because the majority of the group grew up in the 90's, and we were swayed by the 90's theme. Got a little confused downstairs when there was no 90's music...then realized it was upstairs. Oh. Nice! \u00a0I think my favorite part of the 90's theme was when you saw young ones (like, early 20's) watching the music videos on the dance floor. Its like it was their first time seeing those!  Crowd here is pretty mixed. Drinks are delicious, and made well. Speaking of well...well drinks $3! SWEET.",

On Halloween it was dead and only upstairs was open, but second time coming, I didn't know this place was that big!!   - Friday night - after 11pm, it was $10. \u00a0But there's FREE coat check! So make sure to get here before 11 if you don't want to pay cover! - 2 stories, 3 bars, 2 dance floors!!! - Old school hip hop songs! How can you NOT like this place?! They also play music videos on a projected screen! - No dress code  - Outside patio if it gets too hot or you need to smoke  - Good crowd, lots of asians though - Drinks average $9  I think this bar has it all. \u00a0Good crowd, music, and pretty spacious for a bar, probably one of the biggest bars in SF.

Don't get me wrong - love the trance and rave music not so much the ones i hear on the radio but i just MISS the music i grew up with listening to before the trance. Being here made me feel like i was back at a high school dance - loved it. okay so yeah i think we get it that i love the music here haha moving on  APPARENTLY there's TWO floors... and bars on both main and top floor. Very convenient. There's a bigger? dance floor upstairs and i say that with a question mark because downstairs is kinda hectic when everyone is tryna line up to go upstairs...doesnt really leave much room for dancing.  The service here really is spectacular.. my not so little bbg celebrated her old ass here and had a table reserved for her peeps- nice! and there was a banner that said Happy Birthday - and two signs that said Reserved for the birthday girl. i thought that was really cute. OH and she got a birthday card? from the owners? not sure but from raven bar and A BIRTHDAY TIARA! \u00a0i mean yeah it's plastic but what better way to get shitfaced that a sign on your dam head sayin \"it's your birthday - time to fck shit up\"   I came early so i wasn't aware of this \"line\" that forms outside after 10. So good thing for that because it was a cold ass night in sf and although i was mostly covered - i was not at all warm walkin to the bar. SO YES GET THERE EARLY! Before guestlist and you'll find parking and no line but an open door for you to march right through!",

Another bar in the middle of the second floor, with a small dance floor in the front.  Highlight is their AWESOME music. Great classics mixed with newer songs. Play Icona Pop's \"I Love It\" and I'm all yours, baby. I danced my ass off and I wasn't even drunk. Aw yeah, even got some high fives from some bros.

Bartenders here put a lot of effort into your cocktail, it's not a typical well- drink-make your drink in 5 seconds- type of place. I agree with another reviewer that one of the bartenders looks like Ryan Gosling!   If you sign up for the guest list, it's free before 11pm. It is two stories.

I had just heard about the place on Thrillest, so with dining close by, it seemed like the obvious choice. In the pictures it looked like a cool lookin' lounge, but once inside, it seemed much different. It was loud and clubby (Soma style), and filled with young kids. Not really our scene. We decided to at least stay for a round, so our friend bought us 3 cinnamon whiskey shots. After a medium sized mouthful, I couldn't drink anymore....I'm sure it helped make my cab ride home blurry-- what was in those shots? Anyways, our friend also started chatting it up with someone who claimed \"it was his spot\", and bought us some free drinks, which he also claimed \"he usually doesn't do.\" Right dude, we really believe you.  Even though we weren't sure about the place, I glanced around and it seemed like it would be a somewhat cool place to go during happy hour or when it's been on the block longer than however long it has been open.",

To my surprise, the venue welcomed folks of all attire, from the skimpy dresses to the hoodies and sneakers. Yay under-dressed me (skinny jeans, boots, and a cardigan)!   Music was amaze-balls! 90's hits and flat screens in every view of the actual music videos! When the men weren't appealing enough my eyes were focused on those videos. Plus the crowd was great -- everyone was into the music and dancing. It's really a great atmosphere to just have fun with your friends, drink, dance, chat.   The cons... the inability to move at a reasonable speed between the upper and lower levels. Traffic jams were so bad it took us 10 minutes, including the line at the stairs, just to move between the levels. They need to find a better strategy to get people moving. Also, there were so many people upstairs that in some sections I thought I was going to have a panic attack from feeling claustrophobic!   I am not sure why the lower level is so unpopular... I actually thought it had a nice loungey feel.   I'd definitely come back with my friends to hang out -- but not to shop for eye candy!",

My favorite drinks were the Lychee Bliss and the Apple Poe. Even while they were making the Apple Poe, I couldn't wait to try the drink because I could smell the cinnamon in the air. It's so tasty! I also drank the Lychee Bliss prettyyyy quickly because it was so good and fruity.   Another thing I really love about the place is the music downstairs (where we had an area sectioned off). I feel like a lot of bars these days play electronic or house music but it's so much more fun to dance to Top 40 or hip hop/R&amp;B (as cliche as that may be). Raven played a good mix of all the above and I had a great time!

Cons: there isn't much space to move around (as in, the quarters are pretty narrow) and there are a TON of \"Asian bros\" - some of whom can be pretty aggressive (which may not necessarily be Raven's fault, nor is it specific to just one ethnic/racial group - I mention this though as this club did, in fact, have a predominant amount of Asian men there).

I love me some EDM, but sometimes you just want some good throwbacks, and Raven definitely knows how to do it right by putting on Backstreet Boys at the right moment.  BIRTHDAY SHENANIGANS Table reservations were seamless and David was very responsive. They even give you a private guest list for 30 friends (no cover all night).  When we got to Raven, they even decorated my birthday table / booth and David came over to personally give me a birthday card with some VIP passes for next time, AND a dedicated server for our table. Can you say A+ for service?  PROS: -Fun music (Fridays are 90's-Millennial throwbacks) -Easy (and FREE) to book a table -Free coat check (WHAAAT?!) -Funny bartenders (Thanks for the drinks, Zhu!) -Full bar with specialty cocktails -Drinks are reasonably priced (~$10) and it doesn't take forever to get a drink  CONS: -Tiny bathrooms (only 1 stall?!) but they were pretty clean for a lounge/club -No re-entry (what's the point of stamping our wrists?)  Like everyone else said, the crowd is mainly Asian, but that's not a bad thing. We know how to have a good time!  Overall, great vibe and a fun time. I'd definitely come back in the future!  PS: Sign up for the guest list to get free entry before 11pm! Otherwise, there's a $10 cover.",

Getting in was effortless, there are two entrances at the front and you can either enter to the first floor or make your way over directly to the second floor. There are also stairs inside the building by the back bar that lead you from the first floor to the second.   The bartenders were all PHENOMENAL. Great service and super friendly. They even offered us water when they figured we needed some. It's great to see bartenders take care of their patrons, it's in everyone's best interest really.   The music was PERFECT. Hip hop/top 40s. There is a dance floor on the second floor that was the perfect size.   The people were chill and everyone seemed to be on the same page: grab a drink, dance, enjoy the night.   The only not so great thing is that I only saw one bathroom upstairs, not sure if downstairs has one and its unisex. Which means everyone piles up if there's a long wait.   Next time I'd love to try some of their signature drinks.",

Raven Bar seems like a cool spot, but its strange elongated layout makes it super crowded. You will have a very hard time getting to the bar, and getting the bartenders' attention. Once you do, it might not matter, because the bartender might refuse to mix you the cocktails you were so desperately craving because she is too busy. Well, I guess a beer was quenching enough.   For some reason they are always hosting a lot of large groups for birthday parties and such.  The best part of the bar is definitely the upstairs dance floor.

    "review_text": "A friend and I had a joint bday celebration here last night (Saturday) and had an AMAZING time. We were searching to get bottle service at various clubs/lounges in SF and so glad we ended up going with Raven. Their prices are relatively reasonable as bottle service goes, and the email correspondence for reserving a table was very clear and detailed. I wanted our friends to get in for free, and I think almost everyone that came, was able to get in without cover.. If you have a party over 20+ the key is to have EVERYONE sign up for the guestlist by the Tuesday before the event.  Although we had a table, we still had to wait in line because the woman at the window had our guestlist - that was kinda lame, considering we had already made arrangements for bottle service. Either way, we arrived around 10:15, and the line moved quickly so it wasn't a big deal.   Music was SO BOMB. I'm def a hip hop &amp; R&amp;B fan, and I literally did not stop dancing the entire night - in fact, we ended up closing out the club. I can't remember the last time that I stayed at a club til lights on! Although I do like EDM, it's so refreshing to go to a club that doesn't play EDM. Dance floor was crowded, but not crowded to the point where you can't get your groove on. Who wants to dance at an empty club anyway?!   Didn't buy drinks at the bar, so can't comment on that. But I definitely can't wait to come back to Raven. It was my first time, and ooh wee, I am SOLD!",

    "review_text": "I've been to Raven a few times now. First time for a birthday celebration, and more recently just to go out. This place is suitable for birthdays, as you can reserve a table in their lounge and get free admission. It has a little something for everyone. Bars in the front, back and upstairs. Lounge in the middle, and dance floor upstairs. Fun mix of music from 80s-now with music videos to match.  Downsides are the few bathrooms this place has... One M &amp; one F bathroom downstairs, and 2 unisex bathrooms upstairs. The last time I came here we were hanging out upstairs, saw a long line for the bathrooms, so decided to try downstairs. When we got to the bottom of the stairs there was a line to go back upstairs. Had they told us at the top that if we go down we would have to wait in line to come up again, that would have been ok. But there was no notification. Thus we were stuck downstairs for the rest of the night.  By 10:30 on a Sat night the place is already pretty crowded with birthday groups. By 11:30pm this last time I went, this place was overcrowded. I expect when I pay cover for somewhere not to be stuck in a room like a sardine. Free entry, no problem. But this place charges $10 if you're not on the guest list, which is not listed on their event page (price or guest list). Thus this place is just OK.",

    "review_text": "Came to Raven last Saturday for a friend's birthday and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I was pretty hesitant to come cause I was sick and bars/clubs really aren't my scene in the first place, but a friend convinced me to go even if it was only for an hour since there was no cover.  We got there about 11pm and surprisingly there was no line so we were able to walk straight upstairs. You would think that them not having a line at a peak hour shows that they're not that great but how wrong you would be. We were able to walk straight upstairs and got to the bar right away. The bartenders upstairs were really cool, super friendly and they move quick.  What really endeared me to this place though was the music. Instead of playing the typical top 40s, they would play a bunch of music from the 90s and 2000s with a few more recent hits in there. Also the fact that they had the music videos for all the songs playing on a bunch of tvs and even projected on the wall of one of the sides of the upstairs dance floor.  They also had a small area setup on the first floor where my friend was able to do the whole birthday cake and song thing. Only downfall is that it's right in the middle of the 1st floor where everyone needs to walk past if they wanna go beyond the 1st bar, so I felt like we were in the way of so many people.   They also have a large smoking patio which was cool as I was able to sit outside and catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in years but because it was so large I wasn't surrounding in 2nd hand smoke with was great for me as a nonsmoker. One thing that did suck though was the fact that the upstairs only had 1 bathroom so there was a line for the men's and woman's. I saw a few people watching all the music videos while waiting and getting distracted so they didn't notice the previous person walk out so a few times people would just swoop and cut in there before they noticed.  Overall I definitely wouldn't mind coming here again if my friends wanna go out in the city. Parking wasn't terrible to find, only parked about 2 blocks away.",

    "review_text": "I went here since my cousin who was visiting out of town wanted to go there (his coworkers wanted to go). It's a cozy little bar, with 2 dance floors if you like dancing.  I honestly wasn't in a party mood that night, but it's a cute little bar. There's like two diff scenes here, if you like bar-bars.. stay downstairs, but if you like more of a club scene but not a full-on club.. go upstairs.   The staff here is cool. They might not notice who got to the bar first to order, but that's typical. Depending on the bartender they may make you a custom drink (I asked what mixed-vodka drink they recommend and Tammy made a good mix for me). The shots are also big here, unless my cousin's friend was ordering double shots. So I had to ask for a chaser (I never use chasers, might've been my lack of party-mode), anyways I wanted a juice chaser since soda makes me tear (haha! yea I'm odd). So the cute dancing bartender upstairs hooked it up with a chaser that goes with my shot. I learned that pineapple \"masks the taste\" of vodka. OH! Also when they were shooing us off when they were closing.. I ran to the bar to ask if I can still get a glass of water. The guy teased me saying he can't since they stop serving after 2. But he gave me a glass of water anyways.. complete with a slice of lemon! Dang.. ahaha.   Then by the end of the night I noticed I didn't have my card. So I emailed them and the manager responded even though he was on vacation. And they had my card all safe and sound! Yeayuh!  Also, when you call them.. they might startle you by greeting you by name. At least I got startled/baffled when they did it to me. (They have caller ID haha)  *whisper: I like this place better than Bloodhound (their neighbor)* haha  But yea, friendly staff .. cute little bar.. So if you like to drink and dance but don't like a lot of people.. this place is for you.",

They need to let less people in or charge more cover or something because the crowd takes away from appreciating how nice the place could actually be.   One particular time I was the, the bartender did make a good strong drink, but looked at me like I was an idiot when he offered me Ketel for a dollar cheaper than my beloved Stoli that I ordered and I politely declined. I appreciate him trying to give me a deal, but I drink what I drink, I don't mind paying more for it so don't give an appraising look for that. Or maybe it was because I was at a superhero themed party and dressed like catwoman in February. Either way, kind of rude.   It's a good place to dance, drink and lounge.

Drinks were yummy and came at a good price with good service - friendly and fast. The bartender made us his specialty drink on the house. It was a citrus drink with mint or possibly basil in it. Bartenders were pretty cute, too. ;) I tried another cocktail, the Castaway, I think, and liked that, too.  The venue has two floors. Downstairs: The bar is in the front and there's an open space for dancing/lounging in the back by the staircase. Upstairs: You'll find the dance floor, which gets quite crowded, in the front and the bar in the back. If you need to get some air, step outside to the side patio (on the first floor).  Come by 10:30 PM on Saturday night if any parties are going on; otherwise, prepare to wait. There were 5 parties the night I was there and friends said that 70 people were in line. Yikes. I'm not sure what the Friday night line situation is. I hear 90's night on Thursday rarely has a line, though, so you could always get your 90s fix then!",

Raven Bar's high standards for cocktails, modern and classy interior and great service stuck with me, so when it came time to plan my high school reunion, I had it in the back of my mind to throw the event here. Unfortunately for me and the rest of the reunion committee, we had basically no venue budget since our high school didn't assist with reunions. Luckily, Raven Bar came to the rescue. I submitted an event inquiry on their website and they got back to me right away. I explained to David our situation and he was able to reserve us the upper lounge for free, with DJ, as long as we could bring in $500 towards bar purchases. Communicating with David and his team was super easy via email, and something I truly appreciated since I had to plan the event remote from Las Vegas. They provided us with a separate entrance for our event, privacy for 3 hours (although we could have opted for 4 hours), signage for our event outside, and a personalized table-top cocktail menu with drinks that paid homage to our high school. DJ Mark was great at providing music video mixing during the event and playing a ton of songs from the late 90s and early 2000s. He also made sure the slideshow we provided was playing on 3 of their TV screens (while music videos played in the rest). Luckily, hitting the $500 bar tab was super easy since their bartenders make tasty drinks. I was really impressed at everyone's professionalism and would throw another event here in a heartbeat. If I lived in the Bay Area still, I would definitely break my rule of staying at home whenever possible, and come out here for their chill vibe, great music and thoughtful cocktails. Everyone had such a fun time at the reunion and we got so many compliments on venue selection!  (Sidenote: some folks did order food from Triptych and have it delivered to Raven Bar - the sweet potato fries were yummy!)",

    "review_text": "Coooooocktaaaaaaaiiiiilsssss!  I love cocktails. I would start every morning and end every night with a fruity concoction; I would hook up an IV of St. Germain to my veins 24/7 and I would hire mixologists for every party I threw if it weren't so expensive and unhealthy and likely to kill me. I believe you can find nirvana at the bottom of a martini glass, so for me, a cocktail bar is church.  Raven Bar is an above-average church with a charismatic pastor. And by that I mean the bartender we had was fast, attentive, generous, talented and extremely friendly. The drinks are ambitious but not quite in that Tier 1 of Cocktails I have for mindblowingly original, unique creations.  Between the two of us, my friend and I tried the Melissa's Peachy Lychee, Max's Herbal Remedy and The Raven. Max's was definitely my favorite. It featured fresh basil (sprigs of the herb were literally right in front of me) mixed with sour and sweetness for a heavenly aroma that fills your senses. It was so good, my friend ordered it again. The Peachy Lychee was very fruity and very sweet, but missing that extra kick. I think it might have been because the lychees came from a can and anyone who's eaten lots of fresh lychees can taste the difference The namesake cocktail had a really interesting combination of ingredients, but unfortunately, most of it was lost to the overwhelming flavor of the rum (particularly the cinnamon zest).  I agree with other reviewers' complaints about the space. Raven Bar has a long, narrow layout so it feels suffocating no matter where you are. Personally, I'd recommend sitting at the bar unless you really need privacy. That said, the interior is quite dark and romantic, with strategically-placed lighting creating a delicious medley of shadows into which you can disappear if you should so choose. I'd definitely recommend it as a post-dinner destination, particularly if you're on a date.",

They had also set up a nice reserved booth/table, and we all had an awesome night. There were at least 6 other birthdays going on at the same time, but everyone coexisted peacefully and weren't overlapping. Between the bar area, smoking alley, downstairs lounge and upstairs dance floor, there is plenty of space to have a great time. I hate going to bars that feel like a sweaty mosh pit.   No dress code was pretty awesome - jeans, flats, and a nice shirt/top seemed to be the go-to outfit, and no one looked trashy. I LOVED that there was a full bar staff (three bartenders), which meant we got drinks pronto and there was no elbow-throwing at the bar. We ordered a couple drinks off the menu (Lychee Bliss &amp; Castaway) and even got a show from our super-awesome bartender. I loved that they didn't seem stressed out and hurried. Drinks were strong, too!  Music was a little weird - all 1990's hits. After a few hours of N*SYNC and Backstreet Boys, even the excessive amounts of fruity vodka weren't enough of a distraction. If the night moved into more of a top-40, that would be spectacular. Doesn't stop me from coming back here, though. There are far worse things than BSB.   Unexpectedly great bar. I would definitely return!",

They play a mix of mostly 80s and 90s hiphop/pop music. There are some top 40 too. The music isnt really dance music. just a whole bunch or popular music from the past years. The DJ isnt the best. But I liked the music for nostalgic reasons.   This place is two floors, with a bar on each floor. Drinks average $10 each. The bottom floor is mostly for people with bottle service and reservations for booths. There is also a small outdoor hallway you can hang out on the first floor. The second floor is the main dance floor. One thing I did not like was that there is a line with a bouncer to get to the second floor. So you have to wait several minutes to get into Raven, and if you wanna go to the dance floor you have to wait again.   Crowd is mostly 20s. Most girls were in dresses and skirts (any kind, not just club wear) and most guys were in some type of collared shirt but on the more casual side.",

One of my friends arrived late and had too much to drink before arrival. \u00a0He was not aggressive just a little sleepy. \u00a0A bouncer asked him to leave, which I have no problem with as he was in no shape to be hanging out any more. \u00a0I went to check on him on the street and he explained that a bouncer called him a racial slur. \u00a0Now I don't know if this is true as my friend was drunk but I have not known him to lie like this in the past. \u00a0None the less I waited outside with him till the rest of our party could leave. \u00a0While standing on the sidewalk near the edge of their building I was startled by one of the bouncers at the door who had his STUN GUN out and was pointing it in our direction and had it turned on. There were no other people around, we were not yelling or making aggressive behavior, and I was babysitting my friend. \u00a0  THERE IS NO REASON TO PULL OUT A WEAPON!! \u00a0  20 min later asked us to move down the road and I explained that I had called a Cab and we were leaving as soon as it arrived. \u00a0The bouncer with the stun gun was still very aggressive and pissed at us, for almost no reason at all. \u00a0I would think that being a bouncer you would have some sort of professionalism in your job instead of waving weapons around.   At the same time as this was going on outside another bouncer approached my wife and two friends who were having a conversation and told them they needed to leave as you could not sleep in the bar. \u00a0None of them were sleeping! \u00a0They basically harassed the only customers they had on a Friday night. \u00a0  Avoid this bar at all costs!",

    "review_text": "This is my rave on Raven. First off, I want to say that Raven is probably one of the more considerate dance bars I've been to in SF.  Number 1: FREE coat check. No more freezing in the cold while waiting in line! SF winds don't play. Number 2: It was raining this past weekend and they were nice enough to have people line up in the alley where there were canopies so that people won't get wet. Number 3: If you were single during Valentine's Day weekend, you got a pink bracelet to let others know that you are ready to mingle! (Why don't more bars do this? It would greatly reduce the amount of guys getting shot down with \"Sorry, I have a boyfriend.\")  Alright onto the...VENUE Raven is two floors, both have a dance area. I like the downstairs area better because it has two bars, instead of one, so it's much faster to get a drink. Also, I love that they play all my favorite jamz from the 80s and 90s. I also can guarantee that you will hear a BSB and/or NYSNC song at least one throughout the night (I heard both and sang my heart out.) Like most places with a dance area, it gets sweaty, but they do try to pump up the AC every now and then (again, they're so considerate!)  DRINKS They have a specialty cocktail menu, with drinks starting around ~$10. I tried \"The Raven\", which was ok, but I also went to Local Edition the night before and their drinks were much tastier. They also have some fresh beers on tap, which they serve in mason jars. Nice touch.  ATTIRE Dressy casual. Raven is great if you feel like dressing up, or not. They don't have a super strict dress code. I like that.  Overall, would come back.",

People still dress up anyway, but you won't feel left out if you're not. Just don't wear shorts and flip flops. *Even though it was crowded, we didn't have to wait too long to get drinks. Bartenders were efficient, and not rude. (Drinks still expensive, but that's expected in this area.) *Free coat check  Things to note: -Predominantly mid 20s-30s Asian crowd. Thought it was because I went during Lunar New Year and all the Asians were out celebrating, but the second time I went, it was still pretty much the same crowd. More of a mixed crowd earlier in the night though. -Small, sticky dance floor. Dance floor gets crowded, people get drunk, drunk people spill drinks on you. Hence, why I don't like dressing up to go out. I'd say this is a bar/lounge with a dance floor. It is not primarily a dance club. -Although my friend got in free at 9:59, they made the rest of us pay $10 cover when the clock struck 10! No mercy. Be on time, or be on the guest list.

Luckily, we were on the guest list and got in for free though.. I'm all for that free stuff :P Otherwise, the cover is $10.   My friends and I immediately headed over to the bar in the back of the first level. Drinks here are pretty pricey! Each drink we got was about $12.. the drinks were pretty strong so I guess they were worth it.  The place is so crowded that when we tried to head up to the second floor, we could only do so in a 1:1 ratio. As one person came down, one person could go up. So my friends slowly ascended the stairs one by one to this seemingly magical second floor. It took about 10- 15 minutes to get my group of ~10 people up.   When we got to that second floor, we could see why they were enforcing that rule. It was SO crowded! But it was well worth the wait to come upstairs. The lights here (at least on the second floor) were really unique. They had blue spotted lights that made everyone look like aliens (lol) and other types of lights. Every now and then, fog would mysteriously appear around our feet too! They also projected the music video for whatever song was on on the wall!   Now what I was not expecting from this night was their music choice. It was basically all 90's music! And some from Top 40. My friends and I really enjoyed just belting out the lyrics we forgot we had committed to memory from those days :P They played songs like 1,2 Step.. and even Fresh Prince of Bel Air lol. Oh, and a lot of Beyonce too! Apparently every Thursday night, it'll be 1999 at Raven Bar.  Overall, I had so much fun here! I would come back again if I am guestlisted :)",

I wasn't sure how many people to expect (from 20-30) and wanted to scout a location that would be flexible with the number of guests without sacrificing space or experience--and Raven Bar delivered! I got in touch a few weeks in advance and made a (free) reservation for a sizable booth space. David Liu was in frequent contact up to the event and responded to my questions promptly and thoroughly.   On the night of, my 30 guests had plenty of space to socialize, drink (with access to three bars), and dance to awesome 90s music on the upstairs dancefloor or downstairs by the booth. Raven provided someone to help clean up empty glasses and be available in the case that I wanted to get bottle service (which I opted out of ultimately because my friends all like different drinks). This was probably one of the cleanest bars I've been to in SOMA!  I do recommend utilizing the free coat check because after about 11, the club got more crowded. The only negative aspect of the experience was that the 90s music provided by the DJ gave way to just beats by 1 AM, so I decided to call it a night once I couldn't belt out the words to Backstreet Boys any longer.   Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience and I highly recommend this venue for birthday parties, alumni reunion events, or just a great night out!",

I was able to email my guest list to him rather than use the web interface, which means I didn't have to paste 80 names in! It gets a bit too hot/ stuffy- but I had an amazing time!!!",

    "review_text": "When I first heard that we were going to hold our after party to celebrate my birthday at Raven, I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! My fiance was able to pre-arrange with the GM a nice booth to hold our party of 20 and they even had birthday decorations on the wall, and a birthday crown for me to wear. I was so very impressed! At the last minute we decided to not have my birthday cake at dinner and so we brought the cake into Raven hoping they could accommodate us. Again, David the GM, instantly sprang into action and grabbed a server to bring over forks, plates, serving knife, and even a candle for me.  The service at the bar was amazing also! The wait at 11pm wasn't bad and when one of the bartenders heard it was my birthday he bought my girlfriend and I a drink(and it was a double drink, at least). Later in the night, when I needed some water and I was about to pour some from self service bottle at the bar, the bartender instantly handed me two bottled waters without me saying a word. I don't remember receiving such friendly and warm service at a bar.  There are two bars on the first floor and because I was having such a good time dancing with my friends in front our booth near the back bar, I didn't venture upstairs, where my friends said it was packed like sardines.  The music all night was 90's, and mostly hip hop, which is fabulous for dancing and just having a good time. I think we all hear enough EDM these days to take a break from it once in a while.",

    "review_text": "I guess the secret is out because Raven sometimes get ridiculously crowded. Yet I still love this place. And I've been a little ashamed to say I've been here numerous times in the last few months. So often that my friends are commenting on my photos \"again???\". Yes. Again. Don't judge me. And just come drink with me.   There's something about the semi-divey feel of Raven, the casual attire, the random mix of music videos and songs, no cover, and lightning fast bartenders that gets me every time. No overpriced drinks, no pretentious people, no slutty dresses, and no painful stilettos.   Even though it's a bar, capacity reaches its limit so arrive early to avoid a wait.",

    "review_text": "For those of you who are looking for a bar that will provide you with a decent drink and good music, this is NOT the place. We went in to this bar after dinner at around 10:00pm and the bar was empty. We ordered quite a few drinks and every single one of them was weak. I can assure you my gin tonics were around 99.9% tonics with little to none gin. Some reviewers say their drinks were good. Well, a margarita can taste good too if it tastes like a lemonade but that's not what you are paying for. The bartenders are somewhat friendly but nothing to rave about. The music is great if you like the same music with a lot of repetitions. The DJ was unwilling to take our songs' requests which was kind of unusual. How could you be a DJ and refuse to take songs request? It's like a Chef refuses to cook. Understanding the bar was empty so it wasn't like he had his hands full. Given this bar is located in San Francisco and people have great choices to choose from I can't see why people would spend their good earned money there when they don't even have the very few basic things that a bar should have.",

    "review_text": "Novina was the bartender that catered to my group. She is pretty amazing at what she does. Makes GREAT drinks! Not a single disappointment. Also very friendly and chatted with us.   Raven bar has 3 sections - a front bar area - more like a long aisle, an inside cozy area - more suited for an intimate setting and an upstairs where its mostly a dance floor. This worked out really well for us because we mostly chatted over drinks in the back room and then in between our drinks, went upstairs to burn all those calories off - yeah I am only saying that now because I am sober! haha :P  Parking can be an issue but again where in SF do you not have parking issues!? right?",
