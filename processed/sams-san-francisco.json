Who knew? \u00a0Thank you Anthony Bourdain ! \u00a0   We have walked past this place on Broadway for years and never gave it a second glance or thought.  Arrived after 2:00 am on a Friday night and were lucky enough to score a table along the wall. \u00a0The place was packed.  Quickly glanced at the menu and \"specials\" on the walls and was welcomed by the waiter behind the counter. \u00a0 That guy was so on it !! \u00a0OMG ! \u00a0Love Him ! \u00a0 \u00a0What would you like mademoiselle? \u00a0 We ordered one hamburger, one cheese burger, fries and a slice of pepperoni pizza. \u00a0   Considering the place was packed and there were also phone orders coming in and walk-in's with to go orders... our order arrived very quickly and everything was piping hot and delicious. \u00a0 \u00a0Mike is truly a gifted cook and knows how to create the best burger ever!  We so enjoyed our visit and meal, we checked out Sam's again the very next night around 1:30 am. \u00a0Welcome back mademoiselle! \u00a0Love it ! This visit we sat at the counter and added a hot dog to our regular selections (one hamburger, one cheese burger, fries and a slice of pepperoni pizza). \u00a0  It was so fun sitting at the counter. \u00a0 WOW, taking it all in, so much to check out in such a tiny spot. \u00a0Let alone trying to people watch. \u00a0Ha! \u00a0   Love the souvenir t-shirt they have for sale commemorating Anthony's visit to Sam's and the episode footage from Layover they have playing behind the counter. \u00a0You felt like Anthony was still there.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Our second visit, the cook Mike did not disappoint, once again everything was excellent. \u00a0Even the addition of the hot dog to our order lineup was yummy ! \u00a0 Next time I want to try the fried chicken and fish and chips. \u00a0  Can't wait until our next visit to the city. \u00a0We are going to become regulars... I can just feel it.  Thank you for again for the best burgers ever and for making us feel at home from the moment we stepped in.",

OK, I hardly ever give places 5s, but based on my one time experience here and the cheeseburger, I have to give this place a 5. \u00a0Came in here based on the fact that Anthony Bourdain visited this place, and also the recommendations on yelp. \u00a0Just so you know, I had just eaten a slice of Lagos pizza prior to getting the burger, so I wasn't starving at this point. \u00a0  Rolled in around 9:30pm-10pm, and greeted the son of the owner (I'm assuming Sam) and ordered a cheeseburger. \u00a0They had Pursuit of Happyness playing at the bar TV (an old school 18\" tube mini-TV, talk about throwback).  I didn't have anything to drink at all that night since I had just gotten off of a plane, and I was just shocked at the taste of the burger. \u00a0It was juicy, cooked just right (not too well done, not too rare), and fresh off the grill. \u00a0It was a simple little burger, the patty wasn't too thick, and he asked me if I wanted everything on it? \u00a0I said \"ok.\" \u00a0I'm not quite sure exactly what \"everything\" was, but I figured I might as well try. \u00a0I *think* there was lettuce, and a tomato in it, as well as some ketchup and mayo.  Initially, I was thinking that this would just be one of those spots that was highly rated because of the sheer amount of drunk, post-bar-eaters who reviewed this place, but no, this place was really good to a non-buzzed, non-drunk guy. \u00a0The cook/cashier/one-man-show did mention that I came at a perfect time because he had just finished making the patties, but I'm not sure if that was true or if he says that to everyone, but I sure believe it based on the taste of the burger.

One time, while drinking at Vesuvio across the street, I suddenly had a serious burger craving and decided to give Sam's a try.   More than satisfying, the burgers here are among the best I've had, I kid you not. I actually like the decor and ambiance inside, it's just got that old school feel to it. Skip the pizza and go straight for the burgers. They're juicy and tasty. You can get whatever added to it: cheese, bacon, avocado, fried egg; or just stick to the basics. It's excellent however you like it.  The prices can definitely add up, I feel like it got more expensive after Bourdain gave them props, but it's really not bad. I've had much worse and definitely paid more. The joint is very small so it can be hit or miss. I've always found it to be a good idea to get my order to go, then head across the street to Vesuvio where I can knock down a couple beers while I'm at it.  If you're in North Beach, definitely check it out. If you're like me, you'll be returning for more and dragging your friends along with you.",

The burgers...phenomenal (again call it bias if you will), but after handing my $20.00 bill and purchasing a meal for both myself and my old friend from long ago.  Sure the Cheeseburgers and fries were steep in price for $6.50 a combo, but man I couldn't get over the fact that this place reminded me of an old burger joint I used to enjoy way back when in my old high school days. So kudos to you for making me a satisfied drunk with a hearty appetite. Another surprising thought is that, when I saw the owner I could have sworn he was gonna serve me some Halal and curry, but the logical side got me to throw out that stereotype, once the food settled into my stomach.

Ironically sitting next to me was the cop Sam from the R&amp;G Lounge in the San Francisco episode of \"No Reservations\". I ordered the double cheeseburger. When I was eating the hamburger behind me is an autograph of Anthony Bourdain. He wrote that the hamburger he had at Sam's was the top three in the world. Normally I don't write reviews on Yelp but his statement had me thinking about it. I'm not a burger aficionado. However about three months later I eaten several hamburgers after Sam's and I can tell the difference. First they individually make their own patties. The lettuce and tomatoes were crisp and fresh. And the bun was light and not stale at all. After eating the hamburger you don't feel sick at all with all that grease like most hamburgers. If I was really hungry I would have ordered another double cheeseburger. Prior to Sam's the best hamburger I ever had was in San Francisco Brewery Company, which ironically is now Comstock Saloon. I took for granted what a great burger taste like. In Sam's they take the three components (bun, patty, and lettuce and tomatoes) and turn it into a symphony of what a great hamburger should taste. In most places it's either one or two of the components that are done right but not all three, which is why I feel Sam's is special because they got all three components right. In addition their hamburger is not pretentious but straightforward like their place. I don't know if the hamburger at Sam's is one of the top three in the world as Anthony Bourdain wrote but I can say it is the best in San Francisco.",

I love learning about late night places to eat, especially burgers! \u00a0There seem to be a lot of places that serve late night pizza, so a place that makes fresh, fast burgers is a welcome treat.  The burger was great! It tasted charbroiled and they use sesame seed buns that I prefer on my burgers. It was hot, made to order, and they got my order correct (no onions, no mayo.)  I took away a star because of one reason:  When he asked if I wanted a drink, he grabbed a cup and put ice in it, but I needed a non-soda option, so he had to dump the ice back out and was quite irritated. They don't offer anything non-soda on tap (lemonade, tea, etc.) so I took a Snapple. Don't be mad at me because I don't drink soda. Ew. I know it can get busy, but thats the nature of the beast.   Other then that, I was very pleased with my experience, people (customers) were in good moods, it smelled wonderful inside, and my burger was juicy, charbroiled, and slammin. I'll be back Sams.",

I say this with sincere honesty because everything taste GOLDEN when you are over your drinking limit.   Sam's been around for as long as I can remember. \u00a0This used to be typical tiny whole in the wall, until it was made famous by Anthony Bourdain, claiming it as one of the best burgers spots in the city. \u00a0You would know Bourdain was drunk when he said that... watch any of his shows and you'll know what i'm talking about. \u00a0   Anyways back to Sam's... decent burger, yes, amongst the best burger spots in SF, probably not. \u00a0They also serve very unattractive looking Pizza slices (order them at your own risk) but anything goes when you're drunk and looking for something to eat on Broadway.  I'd probably recommend it if you're looking to get quick bite to eat, after a night of drinking. \u00a0However this is probably not worthy of a visit if you're looking to come just for the burger alone. \u00a0There are many other alternative locations in the city for that.

Before many neighboring restaurants opened and closing late, Sam's diner was one of the original \"hole in the wall\" business in North Beach to open to the early morning. His picture of his grand opening in 1968 is proven evidence too.   I infrequently come to the North Beach/Chinatown area in the evening. And just like everybody who reviewed this small place when he/she is drunk, I have joined the crowd when I came here after a \"get together\" at a bar nearby.   When I walked in, I saw a banner of his special for $6.99+tax. I get a cheeseburger, fries and a fountain soda. All the burgers are cooked in a flamed grill. The burger is greasy and cooked just perfect. He is very talkative and enjoy telling stories of North Beach of the yester-years. Stories of the past are priceless and I love listening stories of old San Francisco.   My meal: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/U768gBDU8XM3_cr-yJxwvg?select=g3ovjRPSnEe7lGrkgH2P2A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/U768\u2026</a>  This is a old-school diner with Sam is still operating an old-fashion cash-register (meals are cash only).

I'm sure it will just be twice as good obviously.   So I'm keeping it simple for this review. Just head in there for a late night meal.

It's a small old time diner that serves burgers and pizza. Didn't get the pizza but opted for \"The Bourdain Special\": Cheeseburger, Fries, and a Beer. (I got an Anchor Steam).  All you need to know is it's open very late, serves a no nonsense hot and greasy cheeseburger when you need it most (i.e. after you've stumbled in and out of a Chinatown/North Beach bars). I'm a mayo with fries kind of guy too, and they certainly obliged with giving me all the mayo I needed. The fries weren't the best, but they were freshly fried and piping hot, so no complaints from me.  Certainly a place I'd go to again and again under the right circumstances.",

You keep coming back because it's cheap and satisfying and memorable.   Sam (or whoever the friendly chap is behind the counter personally cooking each order) has no reason to advertise or brag about his product. It sells itself. It's a big, juicy, perfectly-seared piece of meat with all the appropriate fixings. A steaming hot and oily plate full of onion rings is the perfect complimentary side order. Something about eating this burger while sitting at the narrow, greasy counter and watching the game or scoping the yellowing memorabilia on the walls makes me incredibly optimistic about the human race.   It's good to have a friend in San Francisco. I thank my nighttime adventure partner Jon for introducing me to one of the tastiest no-frills burgers I've had in a city already filled with an exceptional selection of burgers.   P.S. I find it ironic, by the way, that a previous reviewer decided to post one of the few negative reviews while also saying he has eaten here more than 50 times.",

My friends and I actually tried to end the night early so we wouldn't have to fight for a spot at the bar or wait super long for our food, but when we came in, there were about 2-3 people eating in there and we were asked to 'come back in 20 minutes.' No questions asked, we left and had a drink up at Sip Lounge a block away. After about 30 minutes, we came back and the line was out the door lol. It's cool though, we didn't mind just hanging out for a little longer. There were no more seats or tables to sit at inside so we took the burgers to go and ate in the car.  I would recommend Sam's to those looking for a late night eat if you're out in the North Beach, Broadway, Financial District, or Polk St. areas. It's also pretty cool that their burgers were blessed by none other than Anthony Bourdain.",

The double \u00a0cheeseburger at Sam's is in Bourdain's top 3 burgers in the world list. So we were in the area. Let's go!   Verdict? Tasty! I actually liked it. Not too oily and it wasn't heavy in the cheese. The sizable meat patties were cooked just right too. While it was good, is it the best burger I've ever had? Nope. At $7 for just the burger this thing was pricey! But the size was relatively large. The Bourdain combo (double cheeseburger, fries and a drink) is about $10-11. I'm glad I tried it, and while the burger was good, the price doesn't justify a return. To many other places to try in the city.   I'd suggest getting your food to go. Sam's is super tiny. Maybe fitting 10 people max. The cooking space is on the side and really small too. I couldn't imagine how long it would take if it gets crowded. It didn't look too clean or comfortable to sit in there either.   Place opens till 4am. Popular with the late night crowd getting out of the bars and strip clubs down the street. =P",

    "review_text": "Mnemonic devices are very useful.   For example, as a musician you'd use Every Good Boy Deserves Favour to remember that EGBDF are the lines of the treble clef.   If you're a biologist, you may find Kings Play Chess On Finely Grained Sand helpful for remembering the taxonomical order of Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species.   If you're drunk as hell and have the munchies on a weekend night in North Beach, then you need to remember this one that I've created: BPBPBP.   These six letters are your guide to a pleasurable drunk dining experience at Sam's. Let's break it down.   Be Polite: The frycook is easily annoyed by loud, drunk, obnoxious people. The frycook stands between you and the sustenance you so desperately need. Therefore, the frycook's desire for peace and quiet shall be respected. A cook's kitchen is his sacred space, and this poor bastard has the rotten luck that puts his kitchen in the front window of a late-night dive full of drunken a-holes.   Be Persistent: The man at the counter doesn't take your money until your food is served. This means that they don't have much incentive to get your order right, or have it come up in a timely manner. You may have to repeat your order - or part of it - several times if you ever want to get it. This is largely because of chaos, as the place is full of drunken a-holes.   Be Patient: Many, many orders are being made, and probably half of them are being changed at some point. Don't worry - eventually you'll be rewarded with your food - and most likely before all the truly drunken a-holes.   By using BPBPBP, this drunken a-hole had a fully enjoyable experience at Sam's. Sure, I had to watch my friends get admonished for speaking too loud. Sure, I had to order my fish &amp; chips twice and my double cheeseburger three times. Sure, I was the last among my group to be served and the last to eat.   But when you're plowed and hungry after a night of countless vodka sodas, Irish car bombs and beers, a cheap-ass cheeseburger from Sam's really, REALLY, REALLY hits the spot. Even if the food is pretty awful.",

No. I think a couple of reviewers must've been drunk out of their minds, because I didn't find my burger tasteful. I don't know, maybe I came here on an off day?

Personally, I like that it's open late, not too far of a walk if you're drinking around Chinatown and North Beach, and the guy working the grill is really nice. Mr. Bourdain was right about one thing, SF is dubbed \"the two-fisted drinking town, a carnivorous meat-eating town, it's dirty and nasty and wonderful.\" Heck, he said this while he was in his drunken state filming The Layover.

Don't get me wrong, I've watched a few No Reservations and enjoyed them, I think he's about as genuine as someone who sells their personality for a living can be (which still isn't near 100%, just the nature of the business.) I don't hate on the guy. But this place seems like exactly what someone who is stage-managing a rich guy who is supposed to have \"urban working-class roots\" would pick to give them \"street cred\" and make them seem \"real\" or whatever.   Look man, it's a dive where they cook up junk food quick. As dives go it's a pretty good one, the owner/counter man /cook Mike seems a good guy, the food is pretty good. But this ain't no top 3 in the world, let alone in San Francisco. It's a good, basic sloppy diner burger served up quick. The fries are pretty good and you get a nice-sized plate of them. That's about it. Anything more than that, you've written in for yourself. Or you were just sloppy drunk and it was 1 am.  3* because that's exactly what the food is. Pretty good, but not great, at an average price considering North Beach inflation (10 bucks for a cheeseburger, fries and a soda.) Worth supporting just for being a local business with character in the face of encroaching chains and yuppie bullshit, but don't expect to be eating the moon and the stars here.",

I also came on the 4th of July (or very early on the 5th, rather). If you're in North Beach, after you've had just the right amount to drink and you're tipsy yet sober enough to do a Yelp app search that goes like this: Food - Filter - Open Now, you'll probably find yourself at Sam's.   Unless you COMPLETELY pass it, which is very easy to do. Then you'll probably find yourself at the white table cloth pizza joint down the street. Which will be closed if it's 2 AM.  But it's not hard to find this place. Just push past the tipsy-ness, look hard and you'll find Sam's. I was a bit skeptical about the food prep, considering this place looks suspect and from the 1980's, but I feel badly about misjudging Sam's.   The service was great, the food was delicious and OH MAN the price was right. SF needs to get over itself and have more reasonably priced food available. Take a page out of Sam's book.  Definitely, definitely going back for their burger. And not because Anthony Bourdain had it when he was piss drunk.",

Arrive. \u00a0Employee is outside smoking a cigarette and messing around on his cell phone. \u00a0  2. He goes back inside and begins refilling napkin dispensers. \u00a0No handwashing after phone/cigarette. \u00a0Oh, jeez. \u00a0Now he's refilling the condiment containers.  3. Eek! \u00a0He just took the lid off that grimy trash can with his hands! \u00a0(No hyperbole here - the trash can was caked with grime, both inside and out.)  4. \u00a0He takes out the trash, tosses it into the garbage truck in the middle of the street, and then helps the garbage man pick up a bunch of trash that fell out on the road.  5. Comes back in, starts making our food. \u00a0  Seriously?! \u00a0Okay, shame on me for eating the burger after watching all that happen (I had to know if it really was as good as Bourdain says), but there is no handwashing sink in sight, no gloves are being used, and the guy who made our burgers was literally picking up garbage on the street before he started cooking. \u00a0  He handled money before slapping some burgers on the grill, and I really don't want to know how my lettuce and onion made it on the burger (please oh please, let there have been tongs.)  I've been known to hit up some sketchy places for food in the past (see also: every pho restaurant, ever), but I *still* see them using gloves and washing their hands in the back. \u00a0  If not knowing where the food prep person's hands have been in the past 1 to 96 hours makes you squeamish, I'd pass this place up.

Decor is what I expected..reminded me of the greasy diners in Detroit/NY (which isn't a bad thing). \u00a0I got the 1/4 lb. cheeseburger and a Sprite and my tab came to $7...very nice price in SF.

I don't eat red meat, and the menu had a few options on it. When I tried to order- guess what, they didn't have any of them! I am wondering if they did but didn't want to do more than hamburgers, cheeseburgers or pizza at 2am.  I got cheese pizza and yuck. The \"chef\" grabbed a cold slice (with his bare hands) and stuck it in the microwave or whatever it was.  The fries were piping hot and yummy. My friends loved their burgers.  I must also add that weather they take credit cards or not is very confusing. Some signs said yes, some said no.  The place is very small and gets super crowded. It's hard to get in and out.

It was still early, about 9ish, so the late night bar crowd wasn't clamoring for the meager 15 seats in the place. We walked right in and were greeted by the owner's son (also the cook). He has an old fashioned cash register (yes, cash only in this joint) which he rings up your order and you pay as you order. He then throws your burger on the grill right in front of you and puts down the order of fries. This means nothing is left waiting and it's all hot and delicious!  It may not be the most amazingly crafted burger in the world, but it's a pretty damn good classic burger. Simple, not pretentious. This place isn't pretending to be anything it's not. We got two burgers, one single, one double with avocado, an order of fries (which was an entire paper plate full), and two beers for less than $25 bucks.   The guy behind the counter said that his dad opened Sam's 50 years ago and keeps it open just for memory sake. While we were sitting there an elderly man stopped in to tell the son that he used to play poker every weekend at the back table. Yes, this is a place with a lot of history and it looks pretty much like it did 50 years ago, but it's cool in it's own way. Definitely check it out!",

I do not know how this is accomplished. They must have some secret recipe.  The burgers and fries are fantastic, in that way which can only come out of a place like this. They are greasy. They are so, so greasy. And the grease is delicious. And the cheese -- I think for the cheese, they drain the grease off the grill and add some sort of yellow colorant, then let it cool down into a hard square, than slap it back on the burger. The cheese is delicious.  I usually get the pizza, and a beer. It is a shame that they don't have warm Pabst, because that would be the perfect beer for this pizza. But MGD works.  You have to be in a really indulgent mood to come here, understand. And a little twisted. Sam's is like the Power Exchange of food -- you have to be in that mindset that finds real carnal pleasure in banging the ugliest stranger possible.

Seriously, one burger and you're in with these guys like a fucking Coppola film.  Don't limit yourself to the burger here though. While it is truly amazing, try and expand your palette a little from time to time. My favorite meal is an order of the Chicken Nuggets with fries. Add in a soda and it's 7 bucks. You get 10 nuggets, fresh out of the fryer and they keep ranch in the fridge for those that like to mix up the dipping options.  The decor and experience as a whole is amazing. It's so unpretentious, unlike most hole's that know they're cool and milk it for every drop of hipster manna. Drinks come in red solo cups, the food is on paper plates, and the walls look like your best friend's attic threw up on your cool uncle's garage workshop. Mirrors with beer company logos on them sit next to framed art of birds casually flying above a Michigan lake. Behind the bar is a bevy of to go containers, an old cash register, a tip cup and a big metal thing with a sticker on it that says I HEART MILK.

It was 2AM, and my friend and I came from our partying nights to grub on a some delicious burgers. Parking was easy peasy since it's in the the middle of the night. There was a bit of a line since from yelp reviews, Sam's is quite popular. This is a hole in the wall joint owned by the sweetest men. There are little seats that can only fit 2 people, and a large table in the back for the big parties. Mind you that this is a CASH ONLY venue. There are funny signs that says they only accept cash and don't you dare ask for credit. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers and fries, BUT we were short 3 bucks. The person that was taking our order was super chill with it and gave us our meals anyway.   The burgers were delicious, on point. Moist with a good patty and moist veggies. Fries were crunchy and a smooth center. They have siracha! So you spicy eaters can enjoy. Water was free and the man that was running the orders was so sweet. He made sure that we were enjoying ourselves and our water cups were filled. The place definitely should be recognized for the people that are making the food and the food that comes a long. I will definitely come back (this time with more cash). Wonderful experience, wonderful customer service, and GREAT burgers. YUM.  Yay Sam's! (There was a sign that says it was ran by Big Mike. If Big Mike was the one that was getting the orders, You are awesome! Thank you!)",

The best way to describe sams as it would be the place in \"Aqua teen hunger force- the movie, part 14 (direct to blu-rock 4d senso crystal)\" where the down and out frylock, Master Shake and meatwad work, becuase their damn house burned down for like the 50,000 time. That sad look on meatwad's face? yeh, that's because he's throwing kirkland select meat patties (aka his brothers) on a grill. And Frylock- wtf happened bro? No laser eyes used on the shady mcshaderson homeless dudes asking me for food while im still eating INSIDE the restaurant. and master shake no longer has the flow- if you know what i mean.  Sams has food late night, the rest- well, not worth the price of admission. Sam's, sorry, you ain't no Sam-wo's....and no, you can't have a bit of my burger.",

We were at Coit Tower and it was time for some food so we played our usual Yelp game and filtered the best restaurants within a mile. From an eclectic list, burgers jumped out at me, and boy am I glad. They weren't open and wouldn't be for hours but the owner \u00a0(Mike) didn't mind opening just for us and throwing some patties on for my double cheeseburger anyway. We sat at the bar in this since 1966 establishment that Mike has owned since 1970. He recounted to us the days of past. Nixon was president and he served Marines hamburgers before they left for Vietnam. He remembered one Marine in particular who cried as he ate his burger and explained he knew he might not come home and that he might be eating his last hamburger ever. Minimum wage was 1.25/hr and he showed us a faded business card advertising hamburgers for 38 cents, a good night cleared $100 profit. If this wasn't enough...the burger was AMAZING! Seriously the best I've ever had the honor to sink my teeth into \u00a0and let the juicy meaty goodness conquer my mouth. If you ever find yourself in North Beach, you owe it to yourself to stop in and say hello to Mike.",

But a place like this, I don't care because I can see everything what's going on inside of the counter. But not at BK. I don't think i'd go BK any more. Or Mac.  This is the best Mo%$%^Fxxxin' burger as Tony Bourdain said. Even though he was so drunk when he was here. I wasn't.  It's grilled burger. A guy who cook burger, after he put a hamburger patty on the grill, that was it, he didn't touch the patty at all. Leave it for few minutes, and a little while after, came back and flip over, that was it. I didn't see the cook push the hamburger patty with spatula on the grill at all.  Very simple process. But, you'll get a most great dripping juicy tasty burger here at Sam's.  I got a double cheese burger. $6.50!!! 6.50 for double cheese burger is hard to find, and it's good, so good. Indeed the best burger in SF.  OK, there are good burger joint in SF that sit down a nice table, ask waiter to get it, and paying 17 dollars for a burger that grass fed black angus beef or Fxxxin' Kobe beef Mozafxxxer, shit, no, no, no, Hell no!  Kobe beef is great for steak, it isn't really good for a hamburger anyway.  I know that they have do burger great but it's not my kind.  This is my kind. It's a $6.50 simple burger that hamburger suppose to look like. Fries was good and hot.  Well, my top Five under 10 dollar burger in SF would be:  1. Sam's 2. Hall of Flame 3. Joe's Ice Cream 4. Hamburger Heaven  5. Bill's place",

The food is cooked so simply yet tastes so good. \u00a0I can't explain it; you have to try it for yourself. \u00a0To wrap up the ending, Mike's bro stepped in to relieve him and Mike went from our chef to our tour guide. \u00a0Needless to say, he's a super cool kat and will definitely hit up the spot to peep in and say hello and if I end up stuffing my face with a cheeseburger and onion rings, SO BE IT DAMN IT!!!!",

The joint consists of just a basic counter with a few sticky stools. Sodas (or water) are poured into red solo cups, freshly grilled hamburgers on a perfectly dressed and toasted sesame bun are served up on paper plates (alongside piping-hot, fresh fries -- if you please), and you and your former burger craving will leave, totally satiated for the time being . . . all without breaking the bank.   The folks who work here are also all incredibly nice. And, I really like that despite its appearance on national television (with a high approval from Tony Bourdain) and their high ratings on Yelp, it still maintains the flair of a neighborhood spot.   While they have random items (like chicken nuggets and pizza) advertised, even their owners will claim that those who know what's up at Sam's go for one thing: the super basic but super delicious burger. I've had their burger both after a few drinks and in the harsh, sober light of day and can attest to the fact that, regardless, it's legitimately tasty.

I like places that close late, especially ones with neat burgers.   However, the burger itself was what I'd call an average burger.

My soul needed healing.   And heal it did. A day after the fact, and I can't place my finger on what is so wonderful about Sam's, but I'll try to explain.   Sam's is located in North Beach, wedged inauspiciously between multiple Asian and Italian restaurants. You probably wouldn't go to North Beach for a burger, but you should probably go for this one.   The restaurant itself is tiny, dumpy and old. It's perfect.   The man taking your order is also the man cooking your burger, and he is as charming as the day is long. \"Do you want everything on that?\" he asks, rattling off ingredients. \"Everything,\" I say, \"except onions.\" He grins, \"One cheeseburger, extra onions?\" This pleases me.   The burger itself also pleases me. Juicy, delicious, flavorful. It's perfect. Let me be clear though. If someone had merely bought me this burger, and I hadn't visited Sam's myself, I probably wouldn't like it as much as I do. The experience of going to Sam's is as important, if not more so, than the quality of the burger.   The man gave me a side of ranch and a side of sriracha. I just wanted to hug him.   I was long gone into the night when I realized I had forgotten my red and black polka-dotted, ruffled umbrella. The man held it for me up front. When I rushed back in, he said \"We don't have anything of yours,\" and winked.   You want to go to here.",

The place may look dingy and out of date but it makes up for it in the food. The quality of the burgers are superb, juicy, hot, and ({--- example of a oxford comma) awesomely tasty. I have had the polish sausage there and I can't settle for anything else anymore. The fries are really good and the onion rings are...well...REAL ONIONS!

Intriguied, I knew I had to try it immediately. If a hole in the wall place, amongst all the seedy and dirty strip clubs in North Beach got Bourdain's attention, then it had to be good!   We went here after the gym around 7pm on a Friday night. Of course, there was no parking. I cruised along North Beach while my boyfriend went inside to order for us for takeout. He took a picture of a letter that Bourdain wrote that said \"THAT was a good motherfuckin' burger! Top 3 in the world!\" Well shit, this must be the best burger ever then!  Apparently there are very few things on the menu--so we got one cheeseburger, one hamburger, and one chicken sandwich. We also ordered a side of fries. When we got back home, my mouth was salivating. I opened up the bag, and it looked like a home made burger. I took a bite anddddd \"it was just ok.\" And letme tell you, don't order that chicken sandwich. It's not good. At all. Bland is the word that comes to mind.  Am I the only one that finds In N Out so much better? This place was fine, really cheap, but not worth for me to go back.",

Good thing I knew a couple of them let me in vehicle and drove off to washington park across from st. peters and paul sat in car ate my burger and fries. It was good the fries just got a little soggy from 20 minutes earlier but I can't blame Sam's as it was hot and crunchy when it came out.

    "review_text": "And the SHADIEST Business Award goes to...  Ok Sam's, SO Anthony Bourdain put you on the hot map claiming that you have \"one of the top three burgers in the world\". Props to you BUT there is absolutely NO excuse to RIP OFF your customers!   After partying at Bubble Lounge on Friday, we needed something to soak up all the copious amounts of alcohol we consumed. While my friends wanted Asian food, I convinced them to go to Sam's with the magic words of \"Anthony Bourdain\".  Sam's is a small, divey greasy spoon between the popular late night drunken eats on Broadway: New Sun Hong Kong and Vietnam Restaurant. They close at/around 3 am depending on the flow of traffic.   I placed our order with a younger guy who calls himself Fatty (Sam was also there): 3 Double Cheeseburgers and 2 Slices of Cheese Pizza. \"It's going to be $42.\" *scratches head* The total seemed high but I was buzzed and I didn't think anything of it because we've paid more for four people before. I handed him $42 (cash only) but never received a receipt. When you're buzzed, the ONLY thing on your mind is getting your grub on (ok, maybe that's one of two things) so the last thing on my mind was a scrap of paper.   When I woke up the next morning, I remember my friend (who's a Sam's regular because he DJs nearby) telling me that the cheeseburger with fries is about $6. I immediately checked Yelp to confirm. I referred to my Yelp friend, Nobu K.'s review on 1.16.12 which confirmed the Double Cheeseburger w/ Fries was $6.50. For the 3 burgers alone, our total should have been about $20. Assuming each slice of cheese pizza is at the market rate of $3, our total should have been around $26. Fatty OVERCHARGED us $16!!!  HELLA SCANDALOUS.   (Looking at Tom F., Ray F. and Joyce C.'s reviews, it seems this is a reoccurring problem.)  SHAME ON YOU for taking advantage of your vulnerable customers! Considering this, I don't even want to imagine what goes on behind closed doors.   P.S. - As far as Sam's being \"one of the top 3 burgers in the world\", I love you Bourdain but PLEASE lay off the moonshine!",

    "review_text": "So you would think after watching the San Francisco episode of Anthony Bourdain's \"The Layover\" that I would be running to Swan's Oyster Depot, La Folie or even Mission Chinese Food based on his enthusiastic culinary reactions at those places. But it was during his lengthy drunken binge on that show that I found myself drawn toward the idea of having a fat greasy burger at the tiny greasy spoon where he was ordering everyone around. Sam's is the place. You need not look any further for this kind of unhealthy eating.  I can only imagine how wildly satisfying one of Sam's burgers must be in the throes of a dipso-maniacal meltdown when you believe you are simultaneously the funniest person on earth and the saddest person on earth. I am ashamed to say I have had several of those moments in my life but not when Jamie W. and I came here. No, we came cold sober for a fat greasy burger. The space was exactly what I thought it would be - a big, worn grill working overtime in the window; a long, sticky formica counter; beaten-down stools; packaged food and supplies piled precariously everywhere; and oh yeah, Sam (see photos).  It was about 6:30 in the evening, and we were able to grab the last two stools at the end. I didn't even have to look at the dimly lit yellow menu on the wall. I ordered the $8 Double Cheeseburger with a $2.75 plate of fries right away (see photos). I don't think Sam asked me how I wanted it cooked. I guess it really didn't matter since it was beefy, greasy goodness with a ton of fixings - two slices of melted American cheese, a thick tomato slice, strands of red onion, and shredded lettuce - all slathered together with lots of mustard. Jamie just went with the $5.50 Cheeseburger, just the single patty, which I think didn't allow him the full-tilt gorging that Sam expects you to experience with his food.  Jamie also had the fries, and he didn't seem to mind that they were a bit dryer and crispier than I preferred since he likes squirting major splooges of ketchup on his. I'm not as much of a ketchup person, so I was choking a bit on the spuds wherever they may have come from. Along with our plastic red cups of Diet Coke, Sam decided to charge us just ten bucks each for our meals - which means I made it out like a bandit and Jamie, well...he was just sorry he didn't ask for another patty on his bun. So after all is said and done, do I think Sam makes the world's greatest cheeseburger? Nah... but with his positive attitude, Sam does a first-rate job with his little hole-in-the-wall spot on Broadway.  FOOD - 4 stars...no designer Niman Ranch, Kobe beef burger here...just a couple of satisfying patties full of greasy, guilty pleasure AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...it's a dive, plain and simple SERVICE - 4 stars...Sam does it all TOTAL - 4 stars...Anthony needs to come back after his stint at Betty Ford",

My friend got a regular cheese pizza for $3, which was a large slice, but $3 for plain ol' cheese did not feel right. The pizza was simply warmed up and given to my friend while I waited for my burger to be made, which meant the burger was fresh so that was nice. The owner asked if I wanted everything on the burger and I said yes. Besides that, we never interacted again until we said farewell when we left.",

While I can't speak for his cheeseburger (which looked pretty greasy and can you say heart attack is coming?!), my polish sausage was a bit spicy. I had all the garnish in there. But the onions were overpowering! I had onion breath still even when I brushed my teeth and flossed........  The health score is 94/100? That is interesting.

Driving down Broadway I look to my left and see a sign that says \"Sam's Hamburgers\" so I immediately pull an illegal u-turn and bam there is SF PD in a black n white. Well this must be my lucky day cuz he points at me but keeps driving.   I stroll into Sam's and pull up a stool at the bar. I meet this interesting character in a fedora and a Niner shirt. I order a 1/4 lb cheeseburger w everything add bacon and a side of fries.   As I'm waiting for my burger I look up at an autographed photo of my favorite Seahawk player \"Marshawn Lynch\". Now if I was in Seattle I wouldn't have thought twice but I'm deep in San Francisco and clearly looking at a die hard Niner fan.   Turns out this Niner fan is \"Sam's\" son and he has known Marshawn since he was 15. Now He has my attention and I press him for more. As he hands me a plate of steaming hot fries he begins to tell me a story how Marshawn sat on my very same stool the day the Seahawks were at the White House. At this point I don't even care if the food is good or not, I love this place!   Then my burger comes... It's massive and looks incredible. I take a bite and this is hands down the tastiest burger I have ever had. No lie if you ever find yourself in North Beach and your craving a burger make sure you take the time to find Sam's Hamburgers since 1966. If you're lucky you'll sit in the same seat Marshawn Lynch chose instead of meeting the President of the United States. That should tell you how good the burgers are.",

    "review_text": "#192 I wanted to know if Bourdain was either drunk or full of shit when he said Sam's makes a good motherfuckin burger that's top 3 in the world.   I'm happy to report that Bourdain was right. This place makes an awesome burger.   I ordered the \"bourdain special\", which is a double cheeseburger, fries and drink. I asked my new friend to hold the onions and tomato. The burger and fries took about 15 minutes to prepare. But, the wait was worth it. Upon arrival, I was on the edge of drooling; the two slices of cheese are perfectly melted between the two beef patties, the thousand island dressing isn't saturated throughout the burger, and the shredded lettuce is placed on the bottom of the beef patties-not the top.  Upon first bite, the beef is so tender it literally crumbles in your mouth. The beef is perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of salt. The meat is juicy; you won't be reaching for your water. Because the cheese is perfectly melted between the patties; its gooey texture and subtle flavor will leave your mouth watering for more even before you've had a chance to swallow. You don't feel weighed down until you finish and realize that you just wolfed down a double cheeseburger in less than 5 minutes.  Put simply, making good hamburgers should not be difficult. But so many restaurants manage to screw it up by overcooking the meat, not tenderizing the meat, not adding seasoning to the meat, or using snob beef like steak cuts to purposely cut down on the juiciness of the meat. \u00a0And then they disguise that mediocre burger by adding fancy sauces or fancy toppings to overwhelm the banal flavor of the meat and cheese.   Sam's burger is not fancy. It never proclaimed itself to be. Looking inside from their lone window. Ask yourself: Do you think this divey eatery serves organic beef? how about veggie patties? Of course not. Pearl's Deluxe Burgers will feed you damn good kobe beef burgers or veggie sliders if you're into that. Sam's just makes an awesome burger with simple ingredients. To me, that's quite an achievement in itself and in this day and age, shouldn't that be enough?   Seating for 8 at the counter. A few proper tables for groups and a small bathroom in the back. Cash only. $13.5r Bourdain special with beer.",

I actually was enjoying my burger until I saw the cashier/server (who was extremely nice and friendly) touch money, then make hamburger patties, then touch money again.

I realized when i was 11 I'm not Tom Cruise, or when I was 17 I'm not Ben Affleck, and I won't be living in pointed, cultivated environments as an actor for a living. Thus, when I dine out, or exist anywhere really, I'm looking for experiences that transport me. I don't have to be lifted off earth to Walden. No, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about one individual -- the ol' auteur theory -- having a pointed vision and making it happen, and never flagging. Most of the time, it's different chef names -- rightfully so -- that gets the street cred for this. Whomever Sam is... he's seated at the same table.  Sam's will never flag. Sam's has an idea, and you're either into it, or you're not. I don't rate my stars on table cloths, food sources, or appetizers. I rate my experiences on three things and always three things: if I walk into a place, and I could never leave (read: I'm both paranoid about dying, and interested in crafting immersive environments), would I be okay with the atmosphere (mainly the smell), the food and the people?   The fact that I've grabbed my own beer out of the back cooler and at the same time, yelled my order across the room to the front to the cook I realize these are two things that I'd want to see if I ran a place: self-serve and everyone gets to yell their orders.  Every single time I've bitten into a charbroiled darker and richer than hell burger at Sam's I think about it being my last meal. I think about taking that paper plate, creating a funnel, and letting the grease hit the back of my throat. That's real life cinematic magic.",
