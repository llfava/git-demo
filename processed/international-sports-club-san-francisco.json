The drinks are cheap (for San Francisco), seemed like everything was $5 and pretty strong. The bartender was also really friendly! It was spacious unlike other dive bars with two pool tables and a foosball table. The only down part was that it was cash only, however that may be why the drinks are much cheaper than other SF bars.",

Now and again it is good for the soul for me to break one of those rules, and it was at this bar that I broke the only drinking rule I have ever had in my life, and what surprised me is I do not regret it at all.  A rule is not a guideline, a rule is typically hard and fast. My drinking guidelines are something like this:  - never drink vodka, except in a bloody mary, and only then before noon  - if they have a signature cocktail get it   - don't ask for Guinness unless you know it's good  - draft beer before bottles  - cask before draft  - always get your round in  - if you don't feel like a drink have a budweiser or a miller lite instead  and so on. Nothing too tough, and if you miss a guideline once in a while, no big deal. My drinking rule, the one and only drinking rule I have lived by my whole life however, has always been something sacrosanct, invioable, a holy vow:  NEVER DRINK AN IRISH CAR BOMB !  That drink is wrong on so many levels. Why spoil good whiskey with Bailey's? why spoil a perfectly good Guinness by dropping the whole concoction in there? And why chug it like a man who has been under siege for twenty years?  And let's not even get into the name. I'll give you that as a coda for peace the drink is better than the real thing, but when you have seen the real thing and know what it does you don't find it that amusing.  Do you think we'll be drinking IEDs in some bar in 10 or 20 years time? We probably will, and they might even be available somewhere already.  Curiosity, and a line-up of about 12 car bombs, one of which had my name on it, got the better of me, and I had one at this bar whilst enjoying an absolutely magnificent night at this establishment with a bunch of good friends, and which was punctuated only by calls from a very very mad The Honey asking me what the hell I was doing at Michael H's bachelor party in SF when I should be home with her and the children in a Snowmageddoned DC.  The Honey is very much like the Car Bomb - the real thing as well as the cocktail. Explosive. Dangerous. She can hurt. \u00a0Handle with care or you will end up with parts of your body strewn all over the pavement.  As for the drink - my God it was good. Astoundingly, shockingly, appallingly good. Balanced and complex, sweet and hot, requiring not a little osculatoral dexterity. Worth it in every single way. \u00a0I must stop now.",

They also didn't have a foosball table or air hockey. Basically, I really couldn't see any reason to go to this place if you have Kennedy's right next door. What they did have was a drunken frat guy who decided, instead of waiting in line for the bathroom, to piss on the kegs that were sitting in the hallway. Classy! Also, their bartenders lied to us and said that the place had run out of beer and only had liquor left. Minutes later, we saw them serve beer to someone else. Why would you lie like that to your customers?  So basically, I cant say I got a good impression of this place. Oh wait, now I remember what this place had that Kennedy's didn't... at Kennedy's they served only beer/wine, but here you could get the hard stuff. In fact, we had come here specifically to get some Irish carbombs, but as I mentioned, we were told that there was no more beer. Lame! So, I guess if you're desperate to drink hard alcohol, you could check this place out, but otherwise, definitely stick with Kennedy's.

Okay, they may not ACTUALLY have lederhosen, but even if they did, which would be cool for sure, it would not make this place any more international than a chicken shack in Kentucky.   In addition to the swans and lanterns and dilapidated country flags hanging from the ceiling they have run down office chairs to sit in, a few pool tables and a horrible juke box that skips occasionally. I would say it would be more appropriate to call this bar irrational than international, but that is just me.   So why 4 stars, you ask? 2 reasons, one of them not useful at all, and the second quite useful indeed, so listen carefully!   Reason 1 - this is where I hosted my very last (Un)employment Tuesday. Not because I had a job yet, but because I was sick of enabling all of the lushes I know. Okay, that is a lie, I love enabling all of the lushes...I was just sick of planning it every week. 2 days after calling this wonderful event quits I actually got a job!! That's right, I am now employed! Look out world.....Drue has a job!!!! (Thank you SFMOMA, you have no idea what you have gotten yourself into!)  Reason 2 - PAY ATTENTION!!!! $2 beers from 4-8 everyday. That is 4 hours of $2 beers. 7 days a week. US dollars, in case you were confused. Good beer too, in case you were wondering if they were going to try to pass off the \u00a0\"king of beer\" or the \"champagne of beer\" as the deal of the century.   If that isn't useful I don't know what is.",

How did I get here? \u00a0Ok, that is a story in itself. \u00a0Originally, my plan for Saturday was to hang out with my friend in the afternoon (in San Jose) and get my coat of arms tattoo done at 4 (which I was looking forward to for almost a month now). \u00a0At 1130, I got a text from the artist telling me I needed to get rescheduled. \u00a0Fine. \u00a0  Called up my friend, \"You wanna go to SF instead?\" \"Sure, why not\"  During the drive up, we determined our agenda. \u00a0Dim sum was first because:  a) we were both Asian b) we were both starving  Also, we are  c) both more white washed than a pair of designer jeans  but that's just fun to mention. \u00a0Next on the agenda was Ghirardelli Squre, for some awesome sundae of course.  Once we arrived in SF, we heard on Wild 94.9 there was the New Year's Parade in Chinatown. \u00a0Wow, awesome, both Vietnamese peeps (who can't speak Vietnamese, of course) can reconnect with their roots and watch the parade.  After having lunch at a random dim sum place in Chinatown, we were headed down Columbus towards Ghirardelli and ran into this dive bar.  \"Hey let's have shot\" (it's 4pm at this time) \"Sure!\"  We walked in and sat at the end of the bar next to this older couple. \u00a0We ordered a shot of Grey Goose with a Coke backer (I always called it a chaser, but I guess I better get with the official lingo). \u00a0We tapped our glasses, cheered each other , and downed our shot like pros. \u00a0The couple next to us had a shot of Cazadores and that's when the fun started.  First she said her pet of 15 years passed away yesterday. \u00a0I consoled her and said she should celebrate his life in addition to mourning his death. \u00a0She mentioned the day before, her whole family and friends were having a party and even looking at pictures of the dog when he was a puppy, as if they were doing the wake while he was living. \u00a0Amazing.  Then we found out in a round-about way her and the guy next to her were lovers, not married, but he \"proposed\" to her with the promise to be forever engaged. \u00a0She then told me when she was 15, she described in her journal the perfect man and he fit the bill. \u00a0She was married a couple times before meeting him, but she believed if she treated everyone well, she would eventually meet her soul-mate.  It was all surreal. \u00a0I was buzzed, getting incredibly deep psychological advice and it was a perfect day in SF. \u00a0Everything she was saying was really hitting home to me. \u00a0Also, they were an older white couple, we were a younger Asian pair, and we were chatting up a storm so loud the entire bar was staring at us. \u00a0We were talking to each other like us four have been best friends for years.  I'd have to say it was the best day I had in a long time, so thanks for dive bars like this one and CHEERS to you Phillip and your soul mate!",

Most people see it as a place for drinks before or after a Bimbo's show, but if you want to drink hard liquor while shooting pool without being continually hassled or distracted by attractive women this spot has to be on your list. \u00a0It's on mine.",

They kept saying the PBR's were warm and they just put them in to get cooled in their attempt to get us to order something else. Finally we just said we would take them as is and they were totally cooled and 2 minutes later my friend went to order one and they said they were sold out. How the hell did they sell out when we were pretty much the first ones to order?!   Shadyshady. Also makes me think of this bartender at Monarch named Shady. Oh and their bathrooms don't have locks. Good job guys.",

Plus the service was great, one of the employees (maybe the owner?) was playing pool right next to us, and made sure we got orders in before happy hour ended. They filled our table with drinks and the average price was no joke, 2 bucks each.  Great place to go before seeing a show at Bimbo's across the street.",

The main thing that stood out for us was this: \u00a0$2.50 well drinks, cheap beer, and cheaper shots. \u00a0  There is a pool table, a few (and I mean few) cocktail tables, and a table or two outside. \u00a0There was no real international theme as far as I could tell, but that's okay, because I don't feel like anyone in there was looking for the theme at all. \u00a0I think they are in for the cheap drinks. \u00a0That's just a guess.",
