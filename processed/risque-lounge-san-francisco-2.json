Here's why this place is awesome:  -Kareoke! \u00a0English &amp; Asian songs. \u00a0Grab the mic and sing in front of the whole crowd -Bottomless (free) chex mix and Asian rice cracker snacks at every table. -Cups of dice to play Chinese drinking games -Decently priced drinks (2 shots of vodka and a beer for $25 pre-tip). -Comfy booths and tables. -Great service from bartenders and wait staff -Cozy and comfortable. Not crowded at all. -Very chill place to hang out if you just want a relaxing night out.",

The music was a mixture of rap,pop, etc so that was cool. \u00a0I saw this girl from doorway, and she looked familiar, as I called her name, she recognized me--I haven't seen her in over 14 years, we chatted for awhile. \u00a0There was a strange occurence, as I walked into the lounge, this girl grabbed my hand, I didn't even know her--eventually made more friends and bought some drinks for them.",

    "review_text": "This hidden lounge is right across the street from Tory Burch.  They call this place the \"high-end\" of Lot46 because its right above lot46.   they open from mon.-fri and sun. close on sat  their bartenders make awesome drinks, the place has decent decor but has a very comfort and homey yet modern feel to it. This is more of a infusion lounge, there are plenty tables available. They do karaoke from sun-thurs. they have a DJ night on every friday.their prices are slightly cheaper than anywhere else in the city. Its differently a spot to go to kick it with your friends or throw parties at!",
