    "review_text": "Writing a review of any bar is definitely not one of my stronger points. Though I love drinking beers, I do not go to a lot of bars to get hammered.  I do all my beer-drinking at the privacy of my home or other's home. \u00a0I also drink at Oracle Arena, my home of my Golden State Warriors...\"ha-ha, get it?\"  But this dive bar in the Lower Haight area is very cool and laid back. The bar is also located next to the popular hot dog place-Rosamunde Sausage Grill. Many of the people buy the juicy hot dog(s) and head next door to the dive bar for one of many rotating local and imported micro-brewed beers on tap.  I have been to the sausage place many times for lunch and on-duty. But this is my first time I have bought a hot dog and went next door to the popular dive bar on Haight Street. I had a pint of Anchor Steam, a San Francisco brew for $4.00. Add that brew with a pair of Coney Island beef hot dogs for $7.50, which is Rosamunde's Monday Special, you have yourself a meal.  As I was enjoying my meal, I was staring at the bar's funky and unique tap-handles from many various brews. Many beer-handles were used and served at the bar and some of them are now retired.   If you are a tourist, you can also buy merchandise at the bar too.   Grab a hot dog from Rosamunde and bring that hot dog next door to the Tornado Bar for a beer is your two-step plan.",

I'd rather walk down to someplace like healthy spirits, or city beer store, where there's a huge selection, and I can ask a question, get an answer, and walk away with a smile on my face knowing my business is appreciated. In fact, I'd rather go to some tight pants hipster bar in the mission, and drink PBR's with some pseudo punk kids in a shit hole that smells like puke.",

Having read some of the previous reviews, we were a little weary of having to deal with an asshole bartender, but that didn't happen. We decided, we ordered, and we paid without any incidents.

    "review_text": "I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said perhaps our last trip to SF was solely to visit Toronado. Once my craft beer obsessed husband showed me, his craft beer obsessed wife, the draft and bottle list, our eyes lit up. When an friends art show happened to be coming up in the city, we didn't hesitate. It also happeed to be SF beer week the weekend we decided to hit up the city. Although we came in at the tail end of it, we still got to see a decent amount of great stuff.  When we first arrived, the place was packed. Well, what we thought at the time was packed. There were no free tables or bar stools. The draft list was wiped out. And it was barley wine day. We almost felt like bolting. But, we decided to stick it out and ordered a beer while standing. Once I finished my Belgian and my husband his Pliny the Elder, a bar stool opened up and we snagged it. Now we were able to be in the mix and talk with the bar tenders better (which is part of the experience in my opinion.) I noticed a large amount of Russian River taps and couldn't help but hide the excitement on my face. Without saying a word, the bartender had to let me down. That was all from Russian River night, none of those beers were available. Needless to say I was bummed. He showed me the bottle list which has a few impressive vintage bottles, but ringing in at about 50 bucks a pop I hesitated. I ordered something else and went on enjoying my time. Shortly, a small glass appeared in front of me and a smiling bartender. He (and who I am assuming the owner?) pulled a 750 ml Russian River Temptation batch 4 out of the cellar, opened it up, and split it between us. I was floored. To share such an expensive and rare beer solely to cheer up a sour fan was incredible to me. I thanked them and savored every sip. The beer was remarkable, by the way.   By the time our other friends joined us and a few more brews had been downed, the place was even fuller than I could have imagined. Every inch of space was full. My head was swimming and my belly was full.   If you have any interest in beer or craft beer, this is your mecca. We sat and digested every little tap and picture and memento on the walls and were astounded at all the rare items they have and have had. If only I lived closer....",

B: you know, if you have a smartphone you can look up the beers instead of me explaining to you.  She then walks away before I speak another word nor have a chance to order. I ask my friend, do you think she meant to look up all the beers on the board online and then figure out which one is sour? Idk. Maybe she meant there's an app on iTunes that tells you what beers they have on tap for the week and gives you explanations. Idk. Well, a few minutes goes by until she approaches our end of the bar again.   M: can you tell me which 4 are the sour beers you mentioned?  B: I don't know what you want me to tell you.  M: I just wanna know which ones are sour, so I can look them up. \u00a0 B: (she pauses and stares me square in the eye) I don't know.   She then walks away.   Oh, did I mention they were not busy at all. I was very polite with my inquiries. Her retorts were short and snobbish.   I still wanted a beer.

After a decent trek through the city, I arrived at a crowded bar with no open seats and squeezed my way to the bar. \u00a0I am no beer expert by any stretch of the imagination...so when walking into a bar with 50+ beers that I have never heard of and know nothing about...is it abnormal for a question or two to be asked? \u00a0I asked bartender #1 for a Belgium style beer that wasn't too hoppy and was given the answer, \"Belgium is just a country, that could mean a lot of things.\" \u00a0  Well, why is it that when I go to any other bar across America with a similar question, the bartender immediately has a suggestion or three for me? \u00a0Eventually I got something and slipped away from the bar.  Finally a couple of guys left and two bar stools opened up. \u00a0I took one and was ready for beer #2, this time, from bartender #2. \u00a0I had been reading my Yelp app for suggestions, but then leaned my hand down on the bar, as I was checking out the taps to see what seemed appealing. \u00a0Bartender #2 comes up and asks - what I would like:   Me: \u00a0\"Can I try this?\" as I point to a tab. \u00a0  Him (snarky tone) \"do you want to SAMPLE or do you want to DRINK it?\"   Me: \"ummm I want to samp...\" as he cuts me off. \u00a0  Him: \"Do you want to drink or do you want to be on your phone?\" \u00a0  Me: \"Huh??\"  Him: \"Put your phone away if you want to order\" \u00a0*looks around at the other patrons for someone to agree with him...  Me: \"I am not even looking at my phone, it's dimmed, what are you talking about?\"  He then hands me my \"sample\" which is awful, so I quickly choose something else, drink it, close my tab, and depart never to return.  I understand that they were busy, but they were in no way \"slammed.\" \u00a0It was the most rude and least helpful bar service I've ever had, and my worst experience at any place in San Francisco.",

However, the list of beers available is so vast that for some - you'll be staring at the list with your eyes glazed. It gets even better when you and your friends have come up with beers from the menu and it's your \"round.\" So you'll go to the bartender, say the names of the beers and he'll tell you, all annoyed, that he's out of those beers ... and it's back to the list you'll go.  Or, you could meet up for a drink with a friend you hadn't seen for awhile before you meet up with other friends after. That's what I did! This is what a night like that is like -   Round 1 (for me) Me: Sorry I'm late. Him: What took you so long? I can't stay very long, but I'll stay and have a drink with you.  Me: How many have you already had? Him: This will be my third.  Round 2 Him: Fuck! I have to go! But I'll go after this beer.  Round 3 Us - drinking beer like water. Third round beers larger than the first two. Us, talking and talking.  Round 4 Him: What is that you're having now? Can I try some of that? [Proceeds to help me drink half of my glass.]  At the end of round 4  Me: Let's go out for some air. Him: Sure.  We head out. We talk for a bit more. He's talking about what I'm up to next. And then he's suddenly like - yeah, catch ya later! And he bolts off. I'm going - what the hell...!?  I reach my friends at a hookah bar. I'm ready to chill out, have fun. And then the hookah bar's feeling warm, and I can't breathe and ... oh shit! The beer finally hits me and - I'm fucked up. Suddenly I know why my friend split.  So, kiddies - the moral of the story is - beer is NOT water! And don't meet with a new group of friends after hanging at the Toronado (that is, if you don't want to ruin their night by having them take you back home early. Sorry guys! You're the BEST!).",

The bar tender is rough and stern looking. He has very long hair and deep bags under his eyes. He walks over to us, points and says, \"What do you want', after only being there 1 min, minute, none of us knew what we wanted. He walks away, nothing else said. We all stare at the big list of beers on hand.  The bar tender comes back, and gives us about 2 seconds to tell him the beer we have chosen. He has no patience for the confused or undecided. He actually told our friend, \"I do not have time to talk about beer\". She was sorry she even asked him a question. We drink our beers, pay and leave. The bartender doesn't say anything else to us. We still joke about that man to this very day.   Amazing beer list, great for the knowledgeable beer enthusiasts. Do some research, know what you want to drink. Ignore the rough crowd and smelly bar.

After struggling to get the bartender's attention, we were finally served and squeezed our way to the back room that was mostly standing with a few tables and booths lining the walls. The crowd was a bit obnoxious, but that was to be expected for a Saturday night. We were able to snag a small table and sat there sipping on our beers. Due to the atmosphere and crowd we decided to just leave our Toronado experience to one beer.  I know a lot of other reviews are raving about the beer selection, but I didn't really find it that \"wowing\".

I got my chocolate beer! hahaha It was decent, but not the greatest.   Plus, with a party of 4, we were able to find tables in the back to sit and chit chat (This was around 12:30pm--everyone was crowding around the bar area).

I rave about this place with the extraordinary selection of beers (best in the bay). I have been there a few times and get the Haight Street scene (no problem). Perfectly sandwiched between a sausage business on one side and a pizza place on the other. Eat, drink and be merry, right?   That's where we get started on my last visit. Busy friday night and we stop in to grab a few beers before a WCC basketball game at USF. Guy at the end of bar tells me to avoid the long hair bartender (Howard Stern wannabe) as he's a jerk. We know what we want so we order. No problem. We come back after the game and the bar is considerably busy. We order another round ($9.50 pints mind you - we know what we want) and no problem. It's the 2nd round that blew my rating down to a \"1 star\" for this place. It's very busy and LOUD and I was trying to get the attention of one of the other bartenders so I gave a slight whistle (remember it's loud)....at that point Howard Stern blows his friggin lid at me and was the biggest @sshole I have encountered in the last few years. He's lucky my buddy didn't jump over the bar as he was totally rude. He ranted and raved and stewed for 10 minutes or so. You would have thought I personally attacked him. The guy was a loose cannon and I was unfortunately the spark. As soon as this explosion went offf a couple of gals sitting at the bar that witnessed it told me how he was totally rude to them as well and that they were leaving (hint to owner = revenue walking out the door because of your employee's actions). I was with three friends so I wanted to stay and enjoy the beers and not this bullshit attitude we were all getting from this bartender. I apologized to him and the bartender I was trying to get the attention and continued to get lip from him. I waited my time to talk to the other bartender and he told me he was not offended at all and that it was cool for me to whistle. Good news is Howard left shortly thereafter since his shift was up.  I have read many other reviews on Toronado and it all seems the same...Great Beers (I would give them 5 stars)....hit or miss staff and many times arrogant and rude (probably need to clean some of them out and I would change my rating to a 5 star across the board).",

Located on Haight near tattoo shops, vintage stores and caf\u00e9s, Toronado's barn style half-door leads into a dark sanctuary for any beer lover. The wall on the bar-side is adorned with hundreds of stickers from breweries (we spotted amongst the mostly-local brew stickers one for Michigan's Bell's) and various beer-related ephemera, bumper stickers (pro-cyclist, -union, -legalization) and a poster that's everywhere around town for a tapping of Lagunita's next batch: Waldo's.  The bar has a reputation for being anti-tourist (ie. you'd better know what you want) but we didn't find this to be true. The bartender was annoyed when K ordered something not on the board but in fairness K had checked the website and it was listed on there.  The jukebox is kind of bizarre but fits perfectly and is wicked cheap.  We enjoyed Russian River's Blind Pig IPA and Deschute's Obsidian Stout while people and dog-watching (the bar is dog-friendly) and plan on grabbing a brew there again tomorrow. Definitely our kind of beer bar.",

The Toronado is an iconic legend in beer-geek circles, a prime mover that has been at the forefront of the craft beer revolution over the past couple decades. I had to make my pilgrimage.   Like many of the nation's best beer bars, it's a little crusty. It has been on Haight St. for 24 years, and looks the part. It's hard to imagine that the first time I came to San Francisco, in 1989, I walked right by this bar when it was in its first year of operation. Of course, I didn't know what I was looking at, and wasn't old enough to drink, anyway. Point is, this place has some mileage on the odometer, and was probably dive-y to begin with - so don't expect some sparkling, yuppiefied, Yard House/World of Beer-type tavern. No matter. You're here to drink beer. You're not here to see and be seen. You're not here to pick up girls. If you're a woman, maybe you could come here to pick up dudes, but you run the risk that some of them may be more interested in their beers than they are you.   Hey, I get it. When I'm drinking a Lost Abbey Cable Car (a rather rare, expensive sour beer brewed specifically for the Toronado), I don't want to be distracted. Upon seeing it on the menu, I was beside myself with excitement. But then I tempered my expectations, figuring they probably wouldn't have it. After draining a Pliny the Elder (because if you come to the Toronado from out of state, you *have* to drink a Pliny), I went up to the bar to try to order my Cable Car, bracing myself for disappointment...but none was forthcoming. Instead, the pearly gates parted, and the bartender produced the coveted 750ml bottle, and two tulip glasses. It just doesn't get much better than that. Sure, Cable Car isn't cheap beer by anyone's standards, but the experience was well worth it.   As tough as it is to follow Cable Car, we did so with New Belgium's La Folie, another perennial favorite sour beer that can't be had where I come from.   This place has a reputation for gruff, snarky service, but I didn't see any of it. For what it's worth, I thought the bartenders I interacted with were pretty cool. The bar felt comfortable to me, very much like some favorite beer bars in my home state. I think that generally, if you can speak a bit of the language of beer, you're fine. That also implies, don't act like an entitled jerk-off, or ask stupid questions like \"what's the closest thing you have to Bud Light?\" For that matter, I probably wouldn't try to order a Bud Light here, unless I was trying to be funny. And, I probably wouldn't try to be funny, either.  Cash only, so come prepared.",

What my ears pick up is the word tornado being pronounced like avocado and I immediately start groaning and whining about having to go to a place that is SO pretentious that they had to 'elevate' the pronunciation of their trailer-bane namesake.  If you've been to Toronado then you can imagine my relief when I got to the front of the bar and saw that  a. there really was an extra 'O' in the name and that really IS how you pronounce it and  b. the bar itself is far from the pretentious pomp-romp that I had been dreading.  Basically, Toronado is a beer drinkers bar. \u00a0They have collected beers and ales from around the globe and while it can get a little pricey (up to 12 dollars a pint if memory serves) they are offering a great opportunity to tour through Europe from the comfort of your bar stool.  It's also worth mentioning that the bartender (Johnny) was really friendly and chatty and at one point after he'd forgotten to bring me my drink he just put it on the house. \u00a0The only reason I'm leaving that last star off is that I'm a bit anti-hipster and there were just a few too many black haired fashion victims trying to discuss something 'significant' for my taste, but I'll definitely be going here again.",

I had had a really nice Bitter there a few months earlier, but couldn't remember the name. I had seen on the menu that they had Twist of Fate from Moonlight Brewery, but I was hoping to try something new.

Just look the bar tender straight in the eyes and ask for something similar to what beer you do like, or possibly a suggestion from them. \u00a0DO NOT ASK \"WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE BEER?\" This question will get you crap service, and rightfully so. \u00a0The bar is all about locals but even they understand that it's reputation brings in people from all over. \u00a0 \u00a0 Don't be intimidated and you'll be fine.

Not pretty in any manner. Random posters, stickers and signs thrown up. Darkly lit interior. Plenty of seating. Wood tables and stools. Man heaven is awesome.  Walk in through a half of a door. Not sure of the proper name. Kind of like on a barn or some old country farm house. Bouncer stands behind the half of a door (as we can CALL it!)., nicely takes your identification. You are immediately greeted with a giant sign above the bar area, listing all the beers. Think I injured my neck from staring to long and being indecisive. Fan of hoppy beers so opted for my favorite Hop Stoopid and tried a new one Denogginator by Drake's. Hit the spot.   When ordering a beer or many beers. The wait time can be a bit long if it is crowded, and the bartenders are not the friendliest bunch. KNOW what you are going to order, or they will move along. But they are more than happy to recommend something or offer a taste. In that area they EXCEL.   Plenty of room to SIT. You might have to come a bit earlier on a busy weekend night to score a spot. Toronado though is best enjoyed on a week night though with some close friends.",

Maybe it's like the first time I had rye bread, sauerkraut or Bud heavy as a 12 year old (didn't like it at first... but grew on me over time), but I wasn't blown out of the water.  Sure, it has a cool dive feel and it's been around for 22 years, but I feel like Toronado in SD has a better vibe, more eclectic crowd and a better selection of beers. Unless there was a hidden menu or something, the draft selections on their beer board was about half the size of one in SD.   Another thing that bugged me was the mood of the bartenders. I know they could care less what I think of them (which is part of the problem), but it just sucks when you ask a simple question, and the staff looks at you like you've got dick growing out of your forehead. C'mon, not everyone was born sipping Pliny the Elder out of their mom's teet... so cut some slack, huh?

I still remember the one time I asked what's new and what would you recommend, I was told, \"They are all good now what do you want?\" WTF?   I have come here for the Barley Wine Festival now two years in a row and I have to say, that that is my favorite time to come. It is an experience then. The beer selection is at that point great and has such a wide range that it does wow me at some point.

Haha. \u00a0He then joined our conversation and gave us a bit of his background, super nice guy! \u00a0Tell him what's up if you ever head in there.  Only bad thing, the bathroom was atrocious. \u00a0There was only one available because the other one was taped off, I have a feeling it was just too disgusting. \u00a0The floor was just soaked and it smelled so bad. \u00a0Oh well, dive bar, dive b-room right?",

    "review_text": "If you like beer....I mean good beer (not Bud, Miller, Coors, Heinekin, Becks, Corona, etc) the Toronado is like one of the 12 wonders of the world. \u00a0I discovered this place about 3 years ago and have been about 100 times since. \u00a0Recently I have become a Dad, so it makes it a bit tougher to get up there (I live in San Mateo). \u00a0As for the beer...about 50 or so taps at all times with all very good American craft beer, or specialty beers from all over the world (mostly Belgium). \u00a0They do not serve any traditional macro (mass produced beers). \u00a0The most macro you will find there is Sierra Nevada and Anchor Steam (both perfectly good beers). \u00a0They also have a menu of about 100 different bottles as well. \u00a0All the beers are served in the appropriate style glassware and they do NOT chill their pint glasses! \u00a0Happy hour is a dollar off most beers every day from 11:30am until I think around 4pm. \u00a0They have special beer events there from time to time with guest brewers giving lectures and serving their beers as well as special weeks and or months dedicated to a certain style of beer (April, I believe is Belgian Beer month, while the Barleywine Fest is held in February). \u00a0  As for the service and the food. \u00a0There is no food served at the bar itself. \u00a0However, they will let you bring in outside food. \u00a0They have a wonderful sausage place next door called Rosamunde. \u00a0They even make some of the best burgers in town on Tuesday's only. \u00a0There is a pizza place on the other side which is OK and a tremendous BBQ place accross the street called Memphis Minnie's.  The main style of the bar is a typical dive bar. \u00a0I wouldn't say it's dirty, but it isn't quite clean. \u00a0I've never seen any rats or anything, or food laying around on the floor, but it does have a dirty vibe to it. \u00a0It's quite dark inside with 3 graffiti laden bathrooms (which are quite fun to read while you do your business). \u00a0They have about 6 tables with stools in the main room plus a bar with about seatng for 15-20. \u00a0Plus they have a small even darker attahed room with another 4 large booths with tables. \u00a0The bar is decorated with classic brewarania material (lots of metal signs and lots of magnum empty bottles, plus a huge assortment of tap handles above the bar. \u00a0There is a jukebox by the restrooms with a very ecclectic assortment of music...mostly metal and heavy stuff. \u00a0They place gets loud...very loud, unless you are there in the early opening hours of the day. \u00a0The best time to come if you want to get a table and have some sort of peace and relaxation would be between 11:30am and about 3pm any day during the week.  The service is...well....all depends on your attitude. \u00a0If you come in acting like a smart ass, drunk or a very stuck up think you know everything type of person, you are likely to get the tradtional Toronado treatment (which is sometimes rude, brash or worser). \u00a0If you are a normal every day person..especially with a good sense of humor, you will really understand this place. \u00a0It all depends who the bartender is. \u00a0There are some that are really nice and a few that are pieces of work. The best story I have is of a yuppie couple that came in and sat at a table. \u00a0The woman speaks up and asks if the bartender can come and bus her table (they last lazy customer apparently didn't dump his food basket). \u00a0Well, the bartender tosses a wet rag, hits her in the face with it and tells her to go knock yourself out. \u00a0So, the service can be a bit iffy at times to say the least. \u00a0The staff, however, is quite knowledgable about beer and will probably lead you in the right direction if you have a question about beer. \u00a0The one important thing to remember is that it is cash only...I believe they have an ATM in the bar, if not there are several ones on the block. Parking is also quite tricky. \u00a0If you come early you have a better chance of getting a spot close by, if not right in front of the bar. \u00a0If you come later or on weekends, you will find yourself walking a few block from your parking space. \u00a0To sum things up....if you really enjoy good beer, you will leave here quite satisfied. \u00a0  A few regualrs on tap  Russian River Pliny the Elder Russian River Blind Pig Moonlight Reality Czech Moonlight Death and Taxes Moonlight Twist of Fate Anchor Steam Anchor Liberty Sierra Nevada Pale Ale Duvel Aventinus Radeberger Hoegaarden plus several others  Enjoy!",

Yes, the bathrooms are gnarly (but not as bad as Zeitgeist's), and yes the bartenders are surly. I sometimes think they're not surly ENOUGH, though, because all the clueless fucking Chads and Kimmies keep showing up, asking for their Bud Lights and Appletinis anyway.  The first time I ever set foot in the place, when I was visiting from Seattle, the bartender rolled his eyes at me when I asked him what style a particular unfamiliar local microbrew was, and then condescendingly explained what an IPA was, I got a little annoyed, but that happens lots of places because the concept that there are women who actually KNOW and LOVE beer is still a new one to alot of guys and they assume you are clueless.  I don't even try to go there during any of the fests except the Wet Hops one, because I hate being squeezed in with a million people.  On the flipside, when I had my birthday there, the bartenders (Paul?) came over and sweetly asked for a slice of cake too, and wished me a happy birthday and it was all peachy. And when a dozen beer-geek friends and I held a beer &amp; cheese tasting there once, \u00a0taking up pretty much all of the back room, they were nice as pie to us all and came over to grub some cheese with us.  I'm not a regular there (because it's not close enough to home), but I find that if you don't act like a choad and actually know what you want to drink and don't ask dumb questions, they treat you well and hook you up. So I guess that the T is sort of like an old friend who is really smart and fun but a raging PMS-y bitch at times. You love her, and she sometimes pisses you off. \u00a0But you never give up on her, and look forward to seeing her again. :) Oh, and proximity to an array of sausages from Rosamunde makes up for a multitude of sins.",

No food to speak of *in* the bar, but the sausage shop attached to it is aces, and the owners clearly have an understanding.  Try something you haven't had before. Don't tell me you've probably had them all, I've had a lot of beers, too, and I promise you'll still find something new. If it's quiet, talk to the staff, they know everything.",

The difficult part is to get to a bartender since it does get crowded; however, that is not a bad thing at all since it is a popular place to hang out after hours. The chocolate stout they have is really good best one I have had so far. I bought my girlfriend the pomegranate cider which smelled very fruity but had a sweet and sour taste which was very intriguing. The negative part of it was that a fly was in her drink. I do not blame them for it sometimes things like that happen but they did replace the drink. Secondly I had a Honey Saigon did not really enjoy it, should of just gone with a Hefe instead. Overall it's a cool place to come in here and then or if you want to just catch up with the boys.   P.S; The jukebox is at a very cheap price and has a good selection.

Second attempt wasn't until more recently with Andrei Z. \u00a0It was a busy night but enough room to stand near the bar. \u00a0This place is dive-y, no doubt. \u00a0I probably don't fit the mold of the regular but I definitely enjoyed their selection of beer. \u00a0The great thing about Toronado is the fact that they have so many beers on tap for reasonable prices. \u00a0The bartenders were friendly enough and we enjoyed our drinks. \u00a0That being said, it was very loud in there so conversation between a group would most likely lead to a slight yelling match. \u00a0It also stank of piss near the bathrooms but for some, that may just be a part of their charm. \u00a0  I'll no doubt end up back at Toronado but cheap beer prices only goes so far in my book. \u00a0I'd much rather have a comfortable place to enjoy said beer and pay a bit extra. \u00a0If you feel the same, check out City Beer Store.",

I tried to count how many taps there were the first time I was there, and it's something like 44 or so, not to mention about 4 more on hand pump, which hardly any bars in this country have. \u00a0Worth trying one if you're there.  So, yeah...nearly 50 A-level brews...about half or so are regional, like Russian River and Bear Republic, but I remember seeing a Dogfish Head Palo up there once, among others. \u00a0Really well-balanced selection...from pilsners to IPAs to Tripels - everything I had there over the course of about 2 years was absolutely fantastic.  The Cash Only policy ends up providing light entertainment by way of watching all the squares pull out their Amex cards, only to have that deer-in-the-headlights/Norma Desmond gaze after the bartender shows them a picture of Johnny Cash flipping them the bird. ;)  Oh, and as mentioned, you can grab eats from Rosamunde (which is right next door) if you're hungry.",

The large glass of beer is around 2 shots 40% Alcohol by volume. Med is around 1 shot.  Drink 3 large glasses and you are good to go for the night. Right next door to the Sausage Factory and a pizza joint. Yes, you can bring in outside food and drink your cold beer.

    "review_text": "I come from a state where beer is a religion, a way of life, and a cornerstone of the economy. I grew up on good beer that was cheap and available. Living in California the past 2 years has been a major shock. There is no good beer here that is cheap and available.  The Toronado was therefore refreshing, but not as refreshing as I'd like. California has the residual beer mentality that good = import, and therefore the more Belgians we sell in wine stores, bars, or upmarket restaurants, the more beer cred we get.  I experienced this disappointment with the Toronado list. Over half the spread was Belgian or Belgian style. For christ's sake, diversify.  The pro's: Moonlight and Russian River are both on the list. Happy hour is affordable and long-standing. Rosamunde's is next door.  The cons: Belgians are overrepresented. Little thought is given to stylistic diversity (there were no stouts and only one porter on the board when I stopped in). There is little thought given to regional diversity - not enough Californian brews on the board, and I only counted one Northwest brew (tragically, Full Sail Rip Curl - not exactly the best rep for the birthplace of the renaissance). No East Coast brews. What the fuck is going on? Divey/punkish atmosphere: take it or leave it. I grew up on traditional pub styles, but if you want your bars harder, whatever. Service: taciturn. Goth boy was behind the bar, I talked beer with him for a while when he wasn't busy. He didn't recognize my Alameda Brewing shirt (shame) and hadn't heard about the Lagunitas bust. On my second pint he nagged me for a tip in a snotty, condescending way. I tip at the end of my stay, not with every round. He lost the %20 I had tucked in the back of the wallet for him. More suckage is that they don't do tabs.  This is an acceptable beer bar, but the fact that it is the best in the bay makes me happy I'm going home in 3 weeks.",

This is evidenced by the existence of places like the Toronado, which I love, but whose beer menu is intimidating enough that I always make my husband order for me.   The Toronado serves up fine Belgian and local beers to the masses who flock there. I've never been there at night (I'm always ending up there in the late afternoon), but it's been busy every time I've been. It's nice and keeps the feel bustling and energetic, but it's not the best bar for standing. Anyway, if you want to get accidentally drunk on beer with a 2-digit alcohol content, I recommend the Toronado. It's got a low bullshit factor and a nice feel, and they play good music. Extra bonus is that you can get a vegan sausage from Rosamunde next door and bring it in to eat while you drink.",

Yea, I wasn't about that life.   A nice gentleman gave up his chair so that our group was able to sit at the festive bar. Super nice! I tried to be super generous and buy him a beer BUT...he already had one and the joint was cash only. Ugh!   We managed to find some cash and then got our beers. 4 beers for $20! Sounds great to me!

Don't bother calling the bar to see if they have Pliny the Younger available. \u00a0You would have a better chance at winning the lotto then to have someone pick up during SF beer week. \u00a0Besides, it's a dive bar. \u00a0I am not going there for their awesome customer service. \u00a0I am there because of their awesome selection of draft beers.   2. \u00a0Arrive before the bar opens to increase your chances at getting this beer. The bar opens at 11:30 am every day. \u00a0They tapped out of Pliny the Younger for the day in 43 minutes while I was there that day.  3. Everyone is trying to get the attention of the two bartenders. You need to be more vocal about getting their attentions to get the beer. \u00a0I mean nicely, not be an ass. \u00a0I saw people being nice and patient waiting for the bartenders only to get shafted by other customers who were more vocal and aggressive.   4. Don't be a dope and order just one for yourself. I have seen others order two at a time for themselves and have done it for myself. \u00a0The chances of you going back into that line to get the beer can be difficult. I brought another friend who wasn't that into IPA's and was able to utilize their services and acquired two additional Younger's.   Bonus - Foo Fighter's All My Life randomly came on during beer consumption. Almost peed my pant and went to heaven. MAJOR bucket list check off. Haha.",

The thing was we were not drunk, nor rowdy, nor disturbing anyone else. But were approached by the staff telling us to get the F*** out, just because we finished our drinks 5 minutes ago. We tried to reason with them and ask why we are being asked to leave, that's when things escalated. They started yelling at us and making a big scene. One of the staff even threw a coaster at my friend, as he was yelling at us to tell us to leave, then he proceeded to grab my friend and pushed him to the wall. Needless to say, they were acting more like THUGS than bartenders and bouncers. From what I have read in other reviews, seems like their rudeness is well documented.

The beer list is easy to read so you can take your time deciding what to order without having to crowd the bar squinting at handles. I love the bartenders. They're very no-nonsense, but not surly, and give this place so much personality. They will not hesitate to send you elsewhere if you try to order Budweiser (which indicates that you are an idiot for failing to see that it's not on their 12'x4' menu) or fail to observe very basic bar etiquette (regardless of where you are, don't snap at your bartender to get their attention).

This Toronado location pales in comparison to the San Diego one. It just didn't have the welcoming feel the other location has. It was like i should have felt privileged to be allowed in this bar. They have less taps than the SD location as well. Though, I'm sure if they had more it would have been filled with more belgian beer.

Go to place for Russian River beers (or any local Norcal beers) as well as a standout Belgium selection. Even got to taste the elusive Pliny the Younger during beer week last year. And definitely check out the Barleywine Festival - cannot be beat. Be prepared to go early, stake out a space/placemat, and sample some crazy strong beers.   And of course, being able to bring in outside food - so great - especially when there are so many great options closeby.",

I kid you not, after drinking all evening here, I woke up like freakn' snowwhite from her enchanted sleep. Mental note to future self: Drink more Anchor Steam;-)   The music kicked ass and I'm not sure what category this bar fits into...but it hangs somewhere between a classy dive bar (is that an oxymoron?) &amp; a beer galleria.  I actually think it's really cool that they do not sell liquor. Keeps the shot slamming assholes at bay (and if I was a regular here with my girlfriends, would prevent us from becoming the shot slamming a-holes).  I probably would have given the place 5 stars if the single bartender wasn't so overwhelmed &amp; if the music was at a lower volume so we wouldn't have to scream at each other. But the beer really did make up for those slight nuances. \u00a0  Overall, I'm glad I was introduced to this place. \u00a0Would definitely revisit on my next trip to San Fran.",

I only go on Tuesdays for the cheesebugers next door so Johnny is the only one I know. Don't piss him off. Don't do stupid things. I saw a guy last week put his beer on top of the jukebox right next to the sign that says, \"DON'T PUT YOUR BEER HERE, EVER!\" Expect the bartender to yell at you. That doesn't make him a bad person, it makes YOU a bad person.  Toronado is a \"dive bar\" yes but they only have the best beers there. Johnny is a veritable sommelier of beer. It's a high class dive bar, but in the couple of years I've been going there I've already seen a change. Tourists and yuppies are starting to show up. I saw a guy working on his laptop at the bar. It's not an Internet cafe, people. It's a bar. It's awesome beer. It's dogs drinking beer. Real dogs. No Irish Setters or Pomeranians. I'm talking mutts, pitbulls, and wirey terriers.  I'm not sure where I'm going with this. Whereas I want to see Toronado prosper, I don't want you there. I don't want yuppies, striped shirts, or tourists to take over the place. I want it to be a quiet, cool place where I can hang out and drink my Black Prince Porter. I want to drink next to a dog, an old man, and a rockstar.  Cheers",

One star for being right next to Rosamunde Sausage Grill which has some awesome grub btw and another star for allowing you to bring your freshly grilled sausage over into the bar and the final star going to a decent beer selection (read the current beer selection on the wall first so you'll be ready to order from the one bartender working the bar)  This place was packed. I dislike packed places where you have to fight your way to the bar to get a beer or fight your way through the crowd to get to the back.  My experience might have been better had I been there with a friend, but I was there on my own on a whim when I decided to go to the city after work from Berkeley.  Quick tip: Bring Cash! - It's a cash only bar  I may try this place out again maybe if I'm in the area or craving another gourmet sausage from Rosamunde next door.",

Thou shalt make every attempt to sterilize one's self upon departure, and not touch the door handle or the latch. Thou shalt do one's best to get back to the beer as soon as is humanly possible.  Now, that may sound like the bathroom is gross, and that I don't suggest using it. While I wouldn't suggest dropping the deuce there, I wouldn't suggest that you do that in *any* bar.

I then resign myself to the fact that I will probably just be boring and live off of Anchor Steam for the rest of my Toronado days.  However, upon visiting the joint on Saturday night, we were approached by no less than four men interested in the charms of my lovely roommate. (Apparently I give off a \"I'mtakenleavemealone\" vibe.)  Actually, wait.  I've changed my mind. This is a good thing. The men who have hit on her have all been attractive in the grungy hipster sort of way, and have taken her on lovely dates around the city.

    "review_text": "I am not a beer drinker--there I finally said it! \u00a0Having limited my alcoholic beverages to wine and sweet cocktails--my beer tasting at the Toronado broadened my deprived palate to now include beer (and my growing knowledge of it). \u00a0A good friend invited me to the annual Toronado Barley wine festival - bringing me back full circle--to how closely beer has been appreciated, elevated with toasts, names and \u00a0what memorable moments they carry.  It has been a couple of years since my Dad's first deployment to the Middle East, but the memory of family and friends gathered together drinking San Miguel beer (a pale pilsen lager so well suited for the buffet style of \"pulutan\" filipino soul food) eclipsed the worries and angst that generally accompanied such sending-off parties. \u00a0Food was also a way to unite because sharing a meal was giving another sense to remember the time together. \u00a0Yes I remember them all--fried lumpias, dry adobo wings, sisig, empandas, grilled Bangus (milkfish) relleno, deep fried pork knuckles with a spicy vinaigrette sauce, \u00a0and of course pancit!!! As a farewell gesture- a toast to my Dad's safe return included my the first time tasting beer--yup JUST ONE sip of it! \u00a0 \u00a0A bitter sweet moment- bitter because of how it tasted and sweet because I still remember my Dad's glistening eyes and approving smile. \u00a0It would be another year until we would all see my Dad again and celebrate his much anticipated return, with lechon that time around!  So on an invitation from a seasoned \u00a0Barley wine festival goer, I found myself at the Toronado- where people of all types- young and old, students and teachers, workers and the financially secure, women and men enjoying their glass of brew laden with mystical wishes that only plain water and honey could make . \u00a0 The beer was no longer bitter, it seemed to have 'grown' with a delicious and distinct taste. \u00a0Like wine, its complex bouquet left trails of orchard fruits plump succulent plums, pears and even melons from the flights of beer as they made their way to the eager tasters. \u00a0Glasses filled with colors of vibrant warm sunshine to glowing ember of sunset, each crowned with foams that peak off the brim or just slight like a layer of melting snow, \u00a0nestled on the frosted glass. \u00a0I saw them all at the Toronado- a deserving destination for anyone with a beer story to tell.  The highlight of my visit- was tasting \u00a0about 12 different varieties (and I was just having sips--from each one of course)! \u00a0One that stood out in taste was Sisyphus The boondock from Texas. \u00a0I was struck by the name \u00a0adding to the mystery of how zymurgists intertwine labor of love with the fruit of their harvest. \u00a0 Perhaps these ideas mirror life's sisyphusean cycle , just like one early evening at the Toronado ...  PS. \u00a0Now that I have access to a home brewing accoutrements- I shall name my first brew- Verre de l'Eau Vivant. \u00a0And that's not the Biere talking ;-) hmmm or maybe wait and taste it first!

Weekends this place gets hectic, what with the general lack of space and the Marina invaders, but during the week (and during the afternoon) there isn't a better place to grab a brew.   As for the bartenders?   Jenny in the afternoons is a chill lady, though she did seem a little stoned, and her dogs are fun to play with if you get the chance.   The Scottish dude at night is pretty cool, too. Just don't mess around - know what you want, pay respectfully, tip well.   Please note. This place is not for: \"brahs,\" ladies looking for Mudslides, people looking to dance or get laid, or Budweiser fans - the sorts of people that have given this unbelievable establishment the lousy reviews that's dragging down its rating.",

    "review_text": "Seemingly endless amounts of beer and wall to wall sausage? Nope this isn't a Thursday night frat party, but rather a pretty awesome premise for Toronado in the Haight.   My buddy brought me here a couple of weeks ago, and from the start Toronado did not disappoint. Any place that rocks one of those half-doors like you'd see on a cottage in the rolling hills of the English countryside (think Jane Eyre except substitute beer for passive-aggressive relationships and feelings) deserves mucho respect.  What makes Toronado great are the contrasts. This bar will take you up and down, back and forth, and leave you somewhere in the middle with a deep seated appreciation for frosty cold ones. On the one hand you've got the quintessential dive bar, but on the other you've got a few state of the art LCD TVs beaming the local sports game (Go Giants!). Then you've got the beautifully ornate tap handles on display vs. the gruffness and harsh lines of the intimidating yet surprisingly cheerful bartender. Finally, you're in the Lower Haight, but the jukebox can and will play all the best hits from the the Motown Era. Smokey Robinson and the Miracles anyone? Yes please :)  Oh, and did I mention the beer? I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shoutout to Westmalle Dubble, my first (and hopefully not last) journey into the wonderful world of Trappist Ales. I'm not much of a beer aficionado, but if I had to compare it to something I'm very familiar with, I'd say Westmalle is kind of like if you took Newcastle and filtered it through a double rainbow while a unicorn was jumping over the top, and maybe a Valkyrie is riding bareback on the unicorn because that would be awesome, right? Yea it's that good, and the glass, nay I say chalice, has a handy guide line on the side so you don't overdo it on the head.  Couple that with the 'go right ahead and bring in outside food' policy, (gotta have your brew with a brat from Rosamunde next door) and ding-ding we have a winner. Toronado, I know you're down in the lower Haight, but I've got nothing but love for you baby.  P.S. minus 1 star for cash only, how am I gonna save up for that power rewards hot tub now?",

Granted, I live half a block away so I come here all the time, but even if I didn't live in the neighborhood, it'd still be worth the trip when I'm looking to try some good beer.",

    "review_text": "A few things the uninitiated should know about Toronado:  It's located in Lower Haight, so the clientele are a jaunty melange of local tweakers, hippies (past their 'best before' date) and day drinkers. Also, because it was featured on Anthony Bourdain, you'll get to mingle with wide-eyed tourists and Food-Network-watching putzes. Stirring this hodgepodge together in a biker bar aesthetic is Fun. It's usually packed in here, especially if there's a game on the tube, but be not deterred. I generally spend no more time at the bar than is necessary, and head for the quieter room in the back where you might have a conversation with a CFO drug dealer that possibly sexually assaulted a Googler.   It takes all kinds, as they say.  For lovers of beer: welcome home. They serve a few dozen microbrews (both local and imported) and have at least 100 bottles. There are also a few stouts on nitro. I can't imagine a beer-thusiast getting bored with their offerings.   Bring cash.  Obligatory Title Pun: TORONADO/why don't you come to your senses?   Menu Readability: Look up and see a bounty of beer!  Need to mention: You can and should order a sausage from Rosamunde next door and bring it here.  What this place teaches me about myself: I don't distinguish 'day drinking' from 'drinking.'",

    "review_text": "For my 100th review, I knew that I needed to do something important - the review that I would have the most trouble with telling the whole story while keeping it relevant and honest. With this in mind, I decided that I would have to do the Toronado.\n  I have a long history with the bar. For the final years of the last millenium, my wife and I chronicled our evenings there on our online journal (yes, this was pre-blogging), and there was lots to blog about. We talked about the bartenders, the regulars and the invaders from the Marina who looked utterly confused when the folks behind the bar said \"No, you can't have a gin and tonic\" followed quickly by \"No, you can't have an Amstel Light\" and finally by \"No, you can't pay by credit card\". The Lower Haight was going through a fight for its very soul - battling against SUVs, gentrification, yuppie encroachment and the chain stores and shops that wanted to replace local establishments... and the Toronado was the point where the battle would be won or lost.\n  That was the late 1990s, and now in 2006, things haven't changed that much. During the days and weekday nights, it's full of regular Lower Haight denizens - and on Friday and Saturday nights, it's a battle between locals and folks from different neighborhoods (and tax brackets). Pauly, Johnny and Kirsten are still behind the bar, and Tad is still the best bouncer in the city - I mean, how many people can come up with a trivia question like \"Name the three characters from MASH that were there since the first episode\" on the fly? (The one that everyone misses is Nurse Kelley... she's the key to the whole series! - I think I won a beer for getting that).\n  So many of my life changing events - from birthdays to our going away party when we moved to Connecticut in 1999 were held at the Toronado, and while I lived just 2 blocks away in a tiny studio apartment with my wife and two cats, the Toronado was like my living room - where I went to relax and to entertain. During the big power outage when the state was plunged into darkness, the Toronado served the neighborhood beverages while Rosamunde turned on their big gas grill and served up sausages for the locals. Up until 1999, the Toronado was home.\n  The bar hasn't changed at all since then. The banner from the bar's first serving of Aventinus on tap is still there, and aside from the growing rack of empty 3 liter Duvel bottles on the wall, the bar is exactly the same.\n  The problem is that even though the Toronado hasn't changed in the past decade, I have.\n  I still love the beer - 46 well selected taps (though I wish they would rotate some of the taps more often - I love De Koninck, but there are other beers that should occasionally take that slot) and a bottle list that is beyond compare in this city and possibly in the country. I've gone there with judges from the Great American Beer Festival and been able to stump them with flavors they couldn't attribute to a specific beer style, let alone a brewery. I love the fact that Dave leased the space to an ex-Bartender to start Rosamunde. The festivals (Barleywine, Strong Beer, Belgian Beer, Oktoberfest, Fresh Hop and many more) are always amazing - the barleywine festival becoming one of the seminal barleywine events worldwide.\n  But as I get older, the music starts to quickly get too loud - and even though I used to be there two or three times a week in the late 90s, now that I am no longer a regular, sometimes I feel like a stranger. Certain new bartenders throw more attitude than necessary, giving non-regulars the stinkeye before reluctantly taking an order - which is a shame for a beer bar that beer lovers make pilgrimages to from all over the world. I'm not saying that you need to be nice, but you need to be respectful of your customers up until they make assholes of themselves.\n  Yeah, I don't wear t-shirts and ripped jeans any more and I live in a SOMA loft, but the Lower Haight is still in my heart, as is the Toronado.\n  Still, I would love for them to install a drain in the bathroom so I don't have to wade through the piss on the floor when I have to take a leak.",

    "review_text": "(Updated 12/6/12)  The Toronado has been a beloved institution in Bay Area beer-geek circles for a quarter-century. \u00a0The attraction, of course, is the best craft beer selection in town, about 45 drafts plus a large bottle list, specializing in Belgians and West Coast microbrews.  Atmosphere is divey, in a good way: \u00a0dark, rather Gothic, with a years-deep accumulation of restroom graffiti. \u00a0Bar and table seating. \u00a0The customers are a varied lot, with many serious beer buffs, mixed with yuppies and \u00a0a contingent of what someone once described as defrocked bicycle messengers. The staff know and love beer. \u00a0Can get quite crowded, even in mid-afternoon; and when the crowds build up, service (usually just one bartender) can be slow.   Upcoming special event alert: \u00a0the annual Barleywine Festival is scheduled for \u00a0Saturday, February 16, 2013. \u00a0The Saturday opening day is always a mob scene, but no Bay Area beer geek should miss it. \u00a0   No kitchen, but customers are welcome to bring in outside food. \u00a0My recommendation would be the Rosamunde Sausage Grill, right next door.  Dog-friendly (perhaps unofficially).  Convenient to public transportation, near the intersection of the 7-Haight and 22-Fillmore bus lines; a mile or so from the Civic Center BART station, and a few blocks from the Church Street MUNI Metro station. \u00a0Pub crawlers may want to drop in at the English-themed Mad Dog in the Fog across the street, or the Magnolia brewpub, about a mile to the west..",

In my two visits here, I've had an example of each. I can only respect them for enabling me to have those diverse experiences.  The last time I was went was a special night for the Russian River \u00a0Brewing Company's \"'tion Night\" where they had $3 versions of all of their crazy-ass beers on tap. This was cool - they head brewer was there as well. Some beers were good, and some were just plain wierd with strange micro-organisms in them. Still - I'm loving the opportunity presented.  Lastly, as everyone on here has already mentioned - you can take the awesome sausages from Rosamunde's Sausage grill next door into this bar and eat it here and stuff. too cool.

The beer paraphernalia all over the walls and ceiling show the colorful history of this place.  A couple drawbacks for some people, but not me - the bartenders have an edge to them, and can seem unaccommodating to those who don't know what they want. The menu can be a bit intimidating for those who don't know great beer. The place is really out of control on weekend nights - most bars are - so I know to avoid going there.

But my friend suggested I try Lindemans Framboise - a raspberry beer, light like a cider. It was awesome! Like drinking fruit juice. Very smooth. I would totally get it again! and again... and again.. It's so easy to drink! :D  Also sipped on a few other beers just to try them out.. and man, the KICK, the bitter BITE that beer gives me makes me scrunch my face. Sorry, I'm just a complete and total beer noob. I do not mean to offend - I am still learning!   Next time I visit the Toronado, I know what I'm getting!   Anyone else have some great suggestions for newbie beer drinkers?",

It is far to crowded, and to top it off, the bartender's at this bar don't give a rat's ass about customer service.  It's too bad that really this is the only bar in the city that has this kind of selection of beer on tap, because it's a great idea, but I don't think I should have to bring my money to an establishment that treats their customer's with disrespect, or constantly has creepy losers drunk at the bar who are slurring every word, and who are also rude to you, as if somehow they got onto the \"I'm so cool, I get shit-faced at Toronado.\"  Listen, if you don't like your job, find a new one. If you want good tips, be nice to your customers. I got a disgusting beer here, the bartender did not warn me at all about the fact that it was not a normal beer. I tried it and my friend tried it, and both of us thought it was disgusting. I had tried all the other Russian River beers before, I thought it would be good. Nope, and he wouldn't give me another beer for free.  Growing up here in this city, this really lovely city, I would hate for this to be a place where people visit from out of town. I think these bartenders should move out of my city, period. I have to question an establishment that doesn't have better customer service policies, especially when I see the many complaints down the list.   I'll just go to Chicago, they have like a billion places like Toronado there. Anyway, you've lost another female customer. I'll be eating my sausages at home with a pre-bought beer.",

This place, compared to the vast majority of those, was disappointing. The bartender behind the counter was a total douche. I waited in line for a little over ten minutes and several times he skipped over me to take orders from guys around me (yeah, it was noticeable). When he finally looked my way, I literally glanced at their tap list for two seconds to make sure I remembered my order (since it had been SO long) and he turned away and helped yet another dude. This had me so frustrated that when he looked at me again and I vocalized my order, I made the mistake of saying lambic instead of framboise (because framboises aren't lambics or anything) and the dude looked at me and was like \"Which one? Actually, I don't think we have any\" and just sort of stared at me as I frantically searched the damn beer list again to see where I'd gone wrong. When I realized my mistake and corrected myself, the guy had this smirk on his face (AKA, he knew EXACTLY what I meant, especially since there was only ONE framboise/lambic on the menu) and continued to stand there. Needless to say, by the time I got my beer and headed back to my table, I was ready to go. Did my friend and I enjoy the beer we got? Yes. Would I come here again? Probably not. I'm sorry I'm not a 6'4'' burly dude with full sleeves (enter sarcasm here)... but last time I checked, money is money, regardless of who is laying it down.",

The fact that I was able to get their attention within a couple of minutes indicated to me that they had the whole entire place covered already. Overall, I like the place. Kudos to Toronado and staff.  Added: I just learned from the bartender that if you order a British style IPA, it will be served at room temperature. Apparently, it's a British practice to serve beer at semi-worse temperature. Hot would be the worse, in case anyone was wondering.",

Toronado is in my favorite neighborhood in SF, is super chill, and has one of the best beer selections I've seen--I wasn't there during Pliny season but a friend (who, granted, knows nothing about beer) claims she saw Younger on tap. I don't doubt it. Vibe is definitely dive-y and no frills but it seems fitting when the emphasis is on the selection.  The only reason it's not 5 stars is because the occasional snob for a bartender can be off-putting. I personally haven't had any issues but have heard plenty of anecdotes that suggest otherwise. I actually have one particularly chill coworker who refuses to go the place because he got such a cold response when he made some sort of faux pas for a question about one of the beers on tap. Seriously, y'all, if you're looking to get into craft beer there shouldn't be an elitist barrier to jump over just because you can't distinguish your Cascade hops from Mosaic.

This was one of my favorite spots when I lived in SF and most often, I went by myself, which always leads to good conversations with the bartenders and patrons. My most recent visit was no different.   Sure, I was shocked that they now have 2 flat screen TVs, but aside from that minor change, everything is the same, just like it should be -- Divey, old, worn, and amazing beer.   The beer selection is second to none and the rotation rate is amazing. This place will have at least 5-10 beers you have never had, and may never see anywhere else. Add to that, the staff is always helpful (just don't get on their bad side...such as asking, \"what do you have that is like Corona?\"). In addition, the place is filled with unpretentious beer geeks and you will likely meet an interesting character and you may even make a new friend.   Happy hour is a dollar off until 6 (I think) and while there is no food, you can get a sausage at Rosamunde Sausage Grill next door (4 stars) or grab food at any place nearby and bring it in.   If you like beer and appreciate a bar that is a bar, come here. If you love beer and everything about beer, then you MUST come here. If you love beer and are in town and don't come...well, that would be like renting a car but choosing the \"no, I don't need tires\" option, or like walking Haight and not noticing the smell of pot, or like going to Naples and not having a piece of pizza...you get the idea.",

The Barleywine Fest (in Feb) is the best way to find warmth in the fog, and the Wet Hop Fest (during the fall harvest) showcases \"wet hopped\" beers redolent and rearing with volcanic hopttitude which have been brewed with hops no more than 24 hours off the vine. \u00a0The 'nado is also quick to showcase a particular brewery's best on a random weeknight with little or no advance notice. \u00a0Their website is updated rarely and inconsistently, which makes it challenging to find out when creative pourings are going down (better to check Beer Advocate or the Brookston Beer Bulletin).  You can bring food in from elsewhere (Rosamunde's sausages a favorite). \u00a0Finding table space is a challenge on weekends, once you've got it, you're in for a solid session.  The only real drawback is the in your face attitude, which eminates from behind the bar and is cold, abrasive and poorly played. \u00a0I've seen a couple thrown out of here on a busy night because they couldn't pull their ID's out quick enough. \u00a0 \u00a0  All in all, it's a dive with high shelf taste in beer. \u00a0The ambiance and attitude are trumped by the cheap quality on tap and it's remains a favorite and in the top three for a proper pint in the city.",

I'm giving 2 stars for the well-rounded beer lineup, but the service here is probably the ABSOLUTE WORST I've ever experienced in my entire life. I'm really wavering between 1 and 2 stars, but they do have a good beer lineup including some that you'd be hard-pressed to find anyplace else, although they did not have some key styles I wanted. No Biere de Garde in bottles or on tap. No Flanders Red in bottles or on tap, not even Duchess de Bourgogne. The board listing the draught options was nearly half empty. Maybe this was due to it being Saturday during SF Beer Week, I dont know, but I expected more from the famous Toronado.  Other than the beer offerings, there is no other redeeming quality about this establishment. A bathroom that doesn't require a Hazmat suit to enter would be nice, or how about being able to actually converse with the person sitting next to you without getting a sore throat from yelling over the obnoxious juke box. I wont even get into the gads of smokers (yuck, smoking is NOT cool) polluting the air since they are allowed to smoke right in front of the half door to the bar. Even if these things weren't an issue, the service is so severely awful, it ruins everything.  I know my beers. I know them well, yet the bartender - after completely ignoring me for a good 20 minutes despite many instances of eye contact - acted like he'd rather drink a pint of vomit then spend 1 minute taking my order. He went back and offered to help the guys adjacent to me twice before I finally had to wave at him to say that I was next. Was this gender discrimination? Maybe girls cannot possibly know enough about beer to get served before all the guys had been taken care of? Then when I did get his attention he acted like it was MY fault that he did not have anything to offer in the styles I requested. Jesus Christ, it's not like I ordered a Bud Light and wanted it split into 2 glasses and garnished with a lime wedge. I settled on 2 beers from the board, and he got my order WRONG, bringing me two of the same beers. The guy sitting next to me offered to buy the duplicate beer since that's what he wanted. Do you think the bartender made any effort to bring me the other beer I ordered? Oh HEEEEEELLLLLL NO! He was done with me, ripping the 20 dollar bill out my hand and then slamming my change down at the bar and storming away for good. Worst service I've ever experienced. There is no reason to ever treat your patrons this way, EVER.  Side note: I just happened to be here with 2 of my friends from a very highly-acclaimed, award-winning microbrewery, who were in town for some SF Beer Week events, one of which is the brewery owner (although we did not make this known - shouldn't have to). Our experience was certainly not good PR for Toronado. I think we all agreed that we'd probably not go back there, at least not the one in San Francisco. The San Diego Toronado is much better, at least the bartenders give a shit. I will still proudly wear my San Diego Toronado shirt. Even if I had wanted to buy a SF Toronado shirt, I couldn't, because the bartender was too busy working on earning his BIGGEST ASSHOLE BARTENDER title to sell me any merch.  Next time I'm in SF and want a good beer lineup, I'll go to City Beer Store on Folsom where they have an excellent selection and the people are cool and nice.",

I never had Pliny the Elder on tap, so I had to have one to compare it from the bottled ones. They even had Dogfish Head Worldwide which is impossible to find. We ended up buying all 7 bottles that they had left. We ended up trying and buying other beers because it was just too hard to find anywhere else.  The people and staff were great here and I couldn't ask for anything more. There was no trouble from customers as all were just there to have a good time. The workers kept our table clean and kept us entertained and never had us waiting long even though it was jam packed. The beer selection here alone is amazing.   They don't sell food here, but they do let you take in food from Rosamunde Sausage Grill from next door.",

    "review_text": "I had to change my review.   Toronado is a disappointment. Beers are great - no doubt that they have one of the best selections in the city and initially I loved the place.   But after last night - I'm not sure I'll ever go back.   Russian River -Tion night. The place was busy - but not busier than I've seen it on a normal Friday or Saturday night and they had more bartenders working - the problem was that the bartenders actually weren't working. They stood there pretending to do shit, taking shots, drinking beers, while people waited upwards of an hour for one beer. Not an exaggeration either - I've got nothing to gain from exaggerating about this.   People were waiting and watching as the bartenders looked at them then walked away. They even played what seemed to be a game among them or serving only certain sections of the bar at a time. One guy, who had been waiting next to me for about 30minutes ( I had been there for 30 and he was there before me so who knows how long it actually was) finally made his way to the bar and as the bartender walked by (doing nothing mind you), he politely asked \"Can I get a beer?\"  I could not believe what happened next. The bar tender went nuts - telling this guy to go \"fu@ck himself, everyone is waiting, why are you special, fu@ck you, you're not getting a beer now, fu@ck this/fu@ck that\" \u00a0It was absurd. I've never seen anything like it. What was crazy was that the bartender went on and on about how \"everyone was waiting and has to wait\" - but really, no one would have had to wait if the bartenders were actually doing their jobs.   Beer pouring was done so poorly last night. I got a pint glass that was seriously DIRTY and he filled it less than 3/4's of the way up and I sure as hell wasn't going to ask to get what I paid for because I didn't feel like getting screamed at.   The beer selection is pretty much unbeatable in the city. But I'll gladly sacrifice the selection and won't be going back anytime soon. I'll even be missing the barleywine fest - which makes me sad! But I won't be giving Toronado any more business until they get their shit together - which I don't think they will.",

On the one hand, it's a great place for hanging out with my friends and I've spent several nights kicking back and having great conversation (by the way, the smaller room in the back is better for conversation because you're shielded from the crappy and uneven sound system). I like that you can bring in food from nearby and that they are (usually) dog friendly. I also enjoy a bit of attitude in my bartenders.  But... it's all beer and I'm just not a beer drinker. Nope, I'm a good old-fashioned queer boy who believes that alcohol should come in mixed drinks with trendy or funny names. And while their selection of beer with trendy or funny names is admirable, I inevitably gravitate to the cider option because it's the only thing that isn't beer.  True story, on one visit I was lucky enough to be the first patron to order after the bartender had just bitched out some other guy who wanted a mixed drink of some kind. Seeking to balance the wheel of karma, or just because we were polite, the bartender decided to buy us our drinks.  On another occasion, I arrived just after there had been a fistfight involving another beligerent customer and a bartender. The bartender in question showed back up at the bar about an hour later with a nasty cut on his mouth that had been treated at the ER.  So at least it's rarely boring.",

Keeps a girl on her toes.  We met two random people by asking them what beer they were drinking. Rather than describing it, they let us taste, then they joined us at our table and we all became bff through the magical friendship power of booze.

It's much more hardcore metal and deep alternative/punk tracks. The floors and bathrooms are however, quite reminiscent of a dive bar's...

But if you arrive early enough, don't mind semi rude bartenders in a dimly lit, smelly and messy bar, then you're in for a surprise in that you'll be able to choose from a wide arrange of amazing beers at low prices.   You just have to realize that it is what it is. And I know this will annoy people, but it's cash only. Deal with it. The prices here are so low anyway that you're getting a lot for your dollars worth. So even walking in with a $20 on you should be fine for a few pints of beer that isn't your normal beer you find in bottles or on the shelf of your local market.   Another great thing about this bar is that you can pick up food from the places near it and just bring them in to enjoy while you drink your pint, The sausage place next door is a perfect combination for whatever you're drinking.  And let's just say you're not sure what is what. There is an easy to read board up that shows what's on tap and from which brewery it is from. While the bartender likes to get to the point, if you go in with your head in your hands and ask for a recommendation, they'll gladly narrow it down based on your preference.   Over all, this is one of the best little hole in the wall bars in S.F. for the vast selection of beer they have to choose from.

My girlfriend doesn't like beer and asked for a wine, which they didn't have a the moment. He offered her a cuv\u00e9e rogue (sour lambic) which he let her taste first. She loved it. I haven't found a single place in las Vegas that will let you taste the beer first. \u00a0  We had got there early, maybe around 2pm. So we were on happy hour. $4/per. As the afternoon wore on it started to get a bit more crowded. Our bartender's shift was up. I will say that our experience could have been a byproduct of a mid afternoon weekday because once he left and it started to get busy the new bartenders were not nearly as talkative.

He's based in Calgary, was visiting with Family and since we're part of the same global work group, it was convenient opportunity to catch up.   He had actually been to Toronado before, while this place was on my list for it's divey and huge beer selection reputation. No food is served, although you can bring it in. Please also note that this is a cash only establishment (ATM on premises) and that you need to order at the bar. That was fine by me, although one of the barkeeps could have been a little more cheerful when he handed me my IPA and mentioned that it was happy hour ($1 off my pint).  We snagged one of the tables on this relatively crowded afternoon. That was also due to one particularly loud guy and the fact the the Giants/Dodgers were on the bar TV. We enjoyed our conversation, our beer, and the whole vibe that Toronado throws out. I could be a regular here if I lived closer.",

The rudeness was absent from our experience but I could feel the rough edges of the folks who work at this place. \u00a0I appreciate being able to have access to such selection of brew at such low prices and assume that working there is not easy or exceptionally high-paying so I can let a lot of rudeness slide. \u00a0I didn't really experience any of it but perhaps it is because I was there early in the day (4PM)... \u00a0but then again, I can't stand being out at bars late anymore anyway so maybe I can understand the grouchiness; \u00a0working late at a bar with too many people beggin for beers would get on anyone's nerves. \u00a0  What I like about this bar is that they aren't trying to give you good service; they are serving the best beer in the world at cheap prices and they let you eat their neighbor's food inside, clean up after you and it's all good. \u00a0You want a high class bar with wait staff that dotes on you? \u00a0Go elsewhere. \u00a0  I will be coming back for another sampling when I get the chance.

I've generally had pretty good experiences with the tenders here.

It's fine, really - no actual complaints - but no actual accolades either. If it was my neighborhood pub, I'd definitely frequent - but \u00a0I wouldn't go out of my way to go here. Yes, there are about 100 beers here (not 1000's like some people below are claiming - sheesh, get a grip. The place is the size of a bus stop.), and most of them are interesting brews from all over the globe... but I've seen this sort of thing done better elsewhere.   There was no beer-o-the-week blackboard and no list of brews written down. The bartender I had didn't seem terribly knowledgeable, and yet, somehow, was still arrogant - not really sure how that works. Doesn't matter tho, \u00a0even if he was knowledgeable, it wouldn't matter since we couldn't hear each other: this place is loud. Really loud. Like, if there was no one else in there but me, my friend and the bartenders we STILL wouldn't be able to hear each other. That kind of loud.  There's a lot of reviews below about how this is how a beer joint should be, not a d-bag in sight, a perfect mix of beers and friends, la la la... That's cool. Really. I get it.

Anyway, the bartenders are great guys and very knowledgeable (Tony's the man) It's hilarious watching them give shit to morons who come in and try to order some crap like MGD, Bud, or euro macros like Stella and Pilsner Urquell.

    "review_text": "For context, I have been going to the Toronado since 1996 or 1997 and lived down the street for many years. \u00a0Instead of the typical review, I am going to break this down into two sections, A Very Short Review and Responses to Most of The Complaints in Other Reviews. \u00a0Let's begin.  A Very Short Review:  This is the Toronado. \u00a0They were serving micro batch, high quality craft brews when 99% of the people that drink them now were preoccupied with memorizing the verbiage on the Budweiser label and were excited when Blue Moon came out. \u00a0Make no mistake, the Toronado is hands down the most famous/important (and in my view the best) craft beer bar in the world, if for nothing else simply for the relationship to the craft beer movement itself (it practically started there) and the owner's relationship with many very high level craft breweries. \u00a0There are beers that are brewed only for this bar itself - try going there on an anniversary and you will see stuff that is impossible to get anywhere else in the world. \u00a0Try going there on SF Beer Week and you will see a new keg of Pliny the Younger for 14 days in a row (yes it lasts 45 minutes sometimes but that is 14 times what just about every other Bay Area bar that serves Russian River beers gets). \u00a0I was there in 2012 for the Russian River brewery day - Vinny and his wife were both there and brought the stuff of dreams... (large format and everything). \u00a0This part was not as short as I anticipated. \u00a0But I digress...   Responses to Most of The Complaints in Other Reviews:  \"The Bar/The Patrons/The Bathrooms smell bad\" - oftentimes this is true. \u00a0There is nothing like the fresh hoppy scent of a Pliny the Elder that arrived the same morning, on tap to clear your nostrils. \u00a0Have two, trust me you won't smell anything offensive anymore. \u00a0And also, it's San Francisco, a lot of things smell in San Francisco. \u00a0Lighten up.  \"It's cash only\" - this is also true. \u00a0Can you imagine what a mess it would be if they accepted credit cards?  \"They don't serve food\" - this is also true. \u00a0There is a vast selection of sausages next door and you can eat them at the bar (or anything else).  The Staff is rude/surly/mean/doesn't understand my request for a \"light\" beer - dude, you went to the Toronado and ordered a \"light\" beer? \u00a0Seriously? \u00a0We've been making jokes about you for the last 15 years but until today I did not know that you actually existed. \u00a0You're actually lucky that the entire bar didn't kick the crap out of you on the way out. \u00a0The bartender was actually extremely polite to you given the situation. \u00a0That's like going to the most famous BBQ restaurant in the country and asking for the \"light\" ribs. \u00a0That's like going to the most famous restaurant in Italy and asking if they have Chef Boyardee spaghetti and meatballs. \u00a0Don't go to the Toronado and ask for a \"light\" beer, or generally act like a jackass.  Yes it is true that when the place is packed to the gills with people, the staff does not have much time for each patron to make a painstaking decision on what beer to get. \u00a0When it's not packed, the staff is pretty cool. \u00a0If you ask intelligent questions and genuinely are interested in the beers, you'll be treated with respect if not outright friendliness. \u00a0Oh, and try leaving a few bucks tip - it works wonders. \u00a0And when it gets so busy that you can't move in there, try to figure out what you want beforehand. \u00a0That's really all you have to do for great service at the Toronado.  \"They don't have such a big/long/great/extensive beer list\" - yes, it is true that if you go to the Yard House, not only will it be cleaner and they may have more taps, but you're not going to find Cable Car at the Yard House. \u00a0Nor are you going to find Russian River's Toronado 2oth Anniversary Ale. It's about quality not quantity. \u00a0It's pretty easy to put 47 lager taps on your list, and I assure you that there's no difference in 98% of them.  That's all for now.",

The best beer I've had in the city has been at this bar - and the menu ROTATES. It's not always the same beer...so the beer lover in everyone can get a taste test of different \"fancy beer\" from all over the world.   Imagine, if you will, a bar decorated by hundreds of taps, random asshole-inspired stickers, and the rudest (see: quite lovable) bar staff in existence. This is Toronado.  I've been here countless times and I'll continue to come back. That means a lot considering I usually have to wait a decade or so to get a re-fill (and this is the only reason they aren't a 5-star joint, in my book). Yes, this place is popular (and when you taste the beer, you'll see why).   They also have a rad happy hour every day until 6 p.m. Something like $3 a pint if I remember correctly, but I can never make it there that early.  It's also nice that there's a sausage joint next door that caters to the vegan-class, and Toronado is happy to have the brats in their haus.   Plus-side: I've never had to wait more than two minutes for the bathroom. As a woman, I will worship a bar when this is the case.  (Funny quip: The last time I was in Toronado, the owner's wife was tending bar. She is a spunky character and anyone without a spine should probably stay away. She'll knock you down about 52 pegs or two and continue to curb-stomp your face...and that's why she rocks. I overheard her make a comment at the bar about Yelp.  \"While you're giving me a shitty review for my attitude on Yelp, I'll be kicking my feet up and watching my 50\" flat-screen in the comfort of my living room, so who's winning?\")",

Even though this is surely not my type of a place, and even if I lived in SF I can not see myself being a regular, \u00a0I can appreciate one of the best beer cards I have seen ever. Russian River is always on tap and the chances are you will find at least couple of brews from the region that are virtually impossible to find elsewhere. As for the service it has all been said before so not worth repeating but I can add that the bartender left his post couple of times to have a cigarette outside, leaving no one behind the bar.   Go here if you like beer, bring cash, get a sausage from next door, and enjoy the weirdness. Like I said...only in San Francisco.",

I guess that's a testament to San Francisco's love affair with its own elitism - \"If you're a beer snob, you'll LOVE this place!!!\". I've been to small town places with hundreds on tap, so I found it strange that there weren't that many, and not many local beers either, at least at the time. They do occasionally have seasonal menus (Belgian Beer Month, The Barley Wine Festival, etc). Delicious.  Still, it's a good selection of beer for a night out - around 40 beers is nothing to complain about. I always have a lot of fun there, too. Snag a table if you can and keep it all night. It gets loud and crowded, and if you're drunk it's even better. A pretty good place. And the sausages next door are an even cooler thing. So, it's not beer heaven, but it's a damn fine bar with no-nonsense bartenders (they're not the kind to get cute with you) and good drinks.",

We spent our first night in Santa Rosa completing our pilgrimage to Russian River and then headed to Haight St for our second evening. \u00a0We arrived to a very loud and very full bar. \u00a0Two of us snagged the last table in the back room while the other two ordered beers. \u00a0The couple with us was not beer drinkers and one of them made the \"mistake\" of ordering a red bull and vodka to be rudely responded to with \"Do you see an #I^*&amp;^^&amp; liquor bottles, man\" as the bartender walked away. \u00a0Not a great start. \u00a0 We finished our one beer and got out of there, sad and disillusioned. \u00a0  The nest afternoon, my husband and I had been at Danny Coyle's watching a Premier League game and decided to give Toronado one more try. \u00a0Upon entering, 2 \u00a0well on their way guys made some sexual innuendos to me. \u00a0No biggie, I can take care of myself. \u00a0I mention this simply because Stu, our bartender today, not only noticed, but subtly took care of it w/our causing a scene. \u00a0Not expected, but appreciated. \u00a0There were 2 bar seats this afternoon which was awesome; that's where you need to be in a beer lover's paradise like this.   I promptly ordered a Michelob Ultra, which rendered Stu a bit speechless, before I assured him I was just kidding and asked what he'd recommend. \u00a0He was super helpful and did not lead us astray. \u00a0We stayed for four pints and enjoyed both the beer and conversation w/Stu. \u00a0  Not only do they have ridiculous beers, but they are ridiculously cheap. \u00a0Apparently, service is hot or miss, but if Stu's working, you'll be treated well. \u00a0I'm so glad we gave it a second chance (though I do rec coming at on \"off\" time to best enjoy the place)!",

This, in a nutshell, is Toronado in the Lower Haight. Their Chimay Red is delicious -- got me f'd up pretty fast. Their music is an ecclectic mix of 80's hair bands and soulful rock metal.

If you have questions about the beer or beer styles get an app on beer or bookmark beer advocate. There is a wealth of information there and will answer your questions.   With craft beer being more popular then ever these guys get bombarded with an assortment of novice questions or folks with a credit card (cash only) or in decisiveness, making it harder for us to get a beer. And they deal with a ton of tourists  I've been coming here for awhile and see where the staff surface surliness may come from. Come in a few times and each time, know what you want, have your money ready, bring up your glass when you are done with your beer, and tip! Simple. You will almost always be rewarded with a free beer and the distinction as a \"regular\" than newbie.   Beer selection is always excellent, prices extremely reasonable and even better during happy hour. Beer is served at correct temperature with appropriate glassware. Oh, did I mention they have several beers on hand pump.   Go to Monks Kettle or any other beer bar and you will pay usually $2 to $3 more per beer, and have a environment not nearly as conducive as Toronado. Insiders tip.

I've been going to Toronado off and on since it opened in 1987, which is about 20 years before Yelp became popular. I have personally witnessed a few of the interactions which resulted in 1-star reviews here, and in each and every case, the reviewer would have you believe that they were not in any way at fault, let alone acting like jackasses or douchebags (or douchebagettes\u2122). In fact, I usually make it a point to look on Yelp to see the rather entertaining and predictable \"I was just quietly drinking my beer when the doorman beat me up\" stories the day after some incident.  Someone whining that they had an open PBR they brought in off the street snatched from their hand? LOL!!! The girl who whined that she got carded \"just for sitting at a table\"? LOL!! And the people who play the tired, well-worn race card saying \"it's mostly white people in there\" or implying that white people (whatever that means) somehow get better service? LOL!!! The fact of the matter is that I don't think I've seen a more ethnically diverse crowd in any bar in SF. Please put down the crack pipe...  Here's an example of fantasy vs reality. A month ago I was sitting at the bar near the \u00a0front corner. Two young ladies were sitting off to the left a bit. One of them curiously goes to the middle of the bar to order and returns to her seat at the bar (turns out she left no tip). When they finish those beers, the second girl goes to the middle of the bar, also leaves no tip, and the bartender rather calmly and in a friendly tone said \"gratuities are accepted\". One girl starts making a scene about how the bartender was \"yelling at her and pounding his fist on the bar demanding a tip\", and he was basically laughing at her utter absurdity and pointing out that he was actually being quite polite and conversational - which is true, I was right there! Finally she played the \"poor college student\" card, at which point he said \"you could buy a 6-pack and drink at home if you're that poor\". \u00a0I actually laughingly told the girl closest to me: \"Be sure to 'Yelp' about how much this place sucks\"...Sure enough, another one-star review the next day (3/26/12). LOLOL!!  Why am I leaving one star? Because Toronado basically sucks! It's racist! \"Ghetto doorman\" (talk about racist, LOL) might beat you up! They'll rudely card you for \"just sitting there\"! They will rudely confiscate booze you sneak in! They will make you leave after last call even though you still have beer in your glass! Oh, the humanity!!!",

And yes, if you didn't catch that up there... THEY DON'T SERVE HARD ALCOHOL. So don't complain when you get there cause beer is AWESOME. And if you don't like it, then you don't like me. And that makes me sad.  Also... They DON'T SERVE shitty american \"beer\". So if you can't go a night without your Budlight, I'm sorry. They only serve real beer here.",

Location: Middle of the street, on Haight, by Fillmore. Parking: Not too bad, but not good either. Beer Selection: Outstanding Alcohol Selection: Makers What?! Seating: Crowded, None Restrooms: About as clean as the ones in Falluja Bartenders/Bouncers: They'll get no criticism from me.  I was attending the birthday bash of a friend, and our crew of between 10-15 people consumed three 9-liter bottles. Yes, you read that right - they have them, we drank them. Unfortunately, that much beer also means lots of breakage and upchucking. This tends to upset the bar staff who are less than pleased by the outcome, so I don't blame them for being surly (as many have commented upon). The solution is to let them know right away, get rid of the breakage, and ask for someone to come mop up. When you do this they tend to be rather happier with you, and even invite you back.  Definitely a dive bar, really not planning on going back unless I'm in the neighborhood. Not because of anything they did or didn't do, but just because I'm not a big beer fan.",

Firstly, the sausage place next door (whose name escapes me) was terrific, right down to the New York get-your-food-and-get-the-hell-out attitude. We were then directed to take our sausages next door to a divey bar called Toronado.  We had a great time there with our beers and brats. Everyone there looked like they were from out of town. Standing room only, but we managed to grab a table and hover over that for a little while. The beer selection made me swoon, but I was careful not to hit the floor since my feet were sticking to it. I guess that gives the place character. Anyway, it was impossible to judge the staff on their service since the place was just full of twentysomethings and other lost souls, crowding the bar and creating that loud, roar-like TGI Friday's ambience. Again, character.  The bathroom was in horrifyingly bad condition, I refused to let my female friends use it, so keep that in mind. Other than that, nice little shady-looking bar with a good selection. And if you're like me and my friends, it's a great starting point for a bar hop.",

Know beforehand what beer you'll want -granted this may be hard to do if you don't know what they have.  2. Don't ask questions. They don't care and are mostly too busy to give any input on your selection. The bartender with the \"Go F@#% Yourself\" tee shirt sums it up pretty well.  3. Wear non-high fashion basic street clothing so you don't stand out and get jacked in the Haight, and in case the drunken guy spills his beer on you. \u00a0  4. Drink your glass of beer or three, pay, and then leave.  By doing this you won't have any grand expectations of this place and you'll fit right in.

I've been to the San Diego location a few times.But I think I like this location a lot more. The bartender was super cool and friendly. They have TONS of beer selection. We were there during happy hour. Dollar off beers! $3 for Blind pig?! Awesome! They even had Port Brewing Old Viscosity! If you are looking to enjoy a good craft beer, Toronado's is the place to be. It's not fancy or trendy at all which I like. The decor is grunge which is sick. I will def come back here if I ever find myself in Haight St San Francisco.",

    "review_text": "Where do I begin? \u00a0As someone who considers himself to a certain degree a connoisseur of beer, or less obnoxiously put someone who is always in search of a good cold one, I was intrigued by Toronado and its offerings. \u00a0I was not disappointed by the selection, but the overall experience left something to be desired.  Located on Lower Haight, a favorite locality of yours truly, Toronado is situated in what I feel is an ideal setting, with Ali Baba, Rosamunde's grill, and a plethora of other reasonably priced and tasty food options. Toronado has a wide range of fine Belgian and local brews, ranging from the more widely available Chimay, to the uber-sublime and floral Edel Weiss, which must be imbibed by any first timer. \u00a0  That said, a bar is more than just an establishment that dispenses booze, especially considering the range and variety of bars in the city. \u00a0Toronado may have one of a kind beers not found in any other bar, but does that overcome mitigating factors that tips it in the opposite direction? \u00a0I know it's already been said, the bartenders can be beyond curt to the point of brusque and curmudgeonly, and I've personally witnessed customers being snubbed for a number of reasons, some warranted, some not so much. \u00a0The demographic of the patrons also merits discussion, as the Haight attracts an eclectic mix of people, but can also be to the detriment of the environment of an establishment like a bar, and Toronado is a classic example. \u00a0While a crew of vigilante hog riders does add a certain element of anti-establishment social edge, a bar full of them creates a non-inviting and borderline hostile atmosphere. \u00a0That, and the entire space, not just the bathrooms, smells like an unplesant concoction of urine and pine sol. \u00a0Not good drinking times. \u00a0  So three stars from me, earned exclusively for the truly unique beers , and zero for the destination. \u00a0That said, what do you value? \u00a0Substance? \u00a0Style? \u00a0Both? \u00a0The choice is yours, choose and drink wisely.",

As a girl, I often feel conspicuous when I visit a bar alone, but I had a great experience. I chatted with an adorable gay couple for quite a while, then I chatted a bit with the bartender (who was the owner/manager) about the San Diego location. I bought an \"SF Toronado\" tee-shirt for my boyfriend. The bartender was so helpful in advising the correct size and style. Sadly, they didn't have any girl's tees. I would have LOVED an \"SF Toronado\" tee to wear to our location. The bartender gave me a patch as a consolation prize which was nice.   The rest of the review is pretty much on par with my thoughts on San Diego's location. The beer is out of this world. They get an A+ for selection, quality, taste, and for not having any crap on tap.   I never have problems with the service in San Diego and, as I indicated earlier, it was outstanding here as well. Even if it was horrible, I'd come here anyway. If I got punched in the face by the bartender every time I ordered, the pint would make up for it.   I'm sure the food is outstanding here as well. This is one of my favorite places to eat in San Diego.",

The crazy woman (owner's wife, apparently?) poured my first beer, and all was fine. \u00a0When I returned to the bar for a second round, she proceeded to ignore me for ten minutes, while helping even new customers who had just walked in before asking me if I wanted something. \u00a0She looked me straight in the eye several times, and didn't say a word, but returned to stocking glasses from the dishwasher instead. \u00a0Finally, when she was right in front of me, getting a beer for someone who had clearly come in after myself, I said something. \u00a0I just said \"Hey hun, when you have a chance can I grab an el toro deuce?\" \u00a0She proceeds to lay into me, saying \"you know how bartending works? \u00a0I ask you what you want to drink, and you tell me, and I get it. \u00a0I haven't asked you yet, so wait your turn!\"  She also mentioned how she had been bartending since 1979 in NYC, blah blah blah. \u00a0I let her know that I was born in 1979, and was a bartender myself, and that had she completely ignored me. \u00a0Long story short, I got my beer, and I tipped her 2 bucks for the outstanding service. \u00a0  The beer list is piss poor right now as well, half the spots on the board are empty. \u00a0Toronado, you need to get your shit together. \u00a0I always thought the fact that I love beer and know a fair amount about it would preclude me from saying this, but for the first time I was TRULY offended by the staff here.",

    "review_text": "I'd give it five stars if it didn't often smell of stale, spilled beer, but hey, I don't eat off the floor or in the bathrooms, so who cares?  I love that they don't serve food, which allows them to cater to all your beer needs. \u00a0Plus, they don't care if you bring your own food, and Rosamunde, next door, has some sort of deal going on with them that allows you to carry your basket o' sausagey goodness over and the folks at Toronado will return it for you.  Some folks might argue at the necessity of using the appropriate glassware for a particular beer, but I am always impressed that the bartenders will go out of their way to find either the glass printed with the name of the beer you are drinking or one that will properly showcase its flavors.  Service: I have yet to acquire a taste for at least one of the daytime bartenders, but I admit, as long as I can order more than one beer at a time so I never go thirsty, I could care less if he ignores me most of the time. \u00a0I don't go to bars to chat up the barkeep; I go to indulge in tasty libations. \u00a0At night, you'll always be treated well by Stuart, Alene, or Tad, unless you are a jackass, in which case, they'll be happy to have you escorted (read: thrown) to the the curb. \u00a0I like knowing that I can enjoy a beer without some jackass messing up the experience.  The beer selection on tap is definitely tipped towards the hoppy end of the spectrum, with some Belgians, Stouts, etc. mixed in. \u00a0If you like the malty side, check out their bottle list, with plenty of vintage selections, although the prices at City Beer are better. \u00a0As far as draft, reasonably priced beer goes, there aren't many better in my book.  Best of all, they are open 'til 2 A.M. every night of the week. \u00a0I love this place, and frequent it often. \u00a0Having recently moved to the bay area from Memphis and starving for great brews, I'm pleased to say it's across the bay from me, or I'd be there every day.  Fight for a seat at the bar or a table: it's worth it. \u00a0Just watch out for the crack dealers and thieves nestled in the shady alcoves on the way back to your car.",

Not all of the bartenders are like this. Whereas I was not able to get a single taster, my friend sitting two seats down from me at the bar was able to get two tasters without hassle from a different bartender.  With the amount of belgian beer they serve here, it's probably better to visit Mikkeller bar downtown. If you're not satisfied with that there's City Beer nearby to expand on your options.",

I suggest relieving yourself ahead of time, dusting off your kindergarden politeness skills, and coming during an off hour, so that you can treat yourself to one of the most diverse selections of beer in the Bay Area.   This is an excellent place to try out varieties of beer that are absent at most other bars (e.g. I tried my first lambic here) and to familiarize yourself with new brewers from this area. At its best, Toronado is like a daily beer tasting festival. At its worst, it is a difficult place to grab happy hour brews with your ten closest coworkers. But if you love beer and want to exercise your adventurous tastebuds/liver, Toronado is worth it.",

Three years later this is no longer a must-stop (and also never was a biker bar, Mom). Maybe because it's cash only (err). Maybe because it's too close (we live in Cole Valley) so we feel like we could come anytime..and then never come. Maybe because it's always SO packed. For whatever reason, we don't come here as often as we thought we would.  On Saturday night we came here for my friend Steve's bday. It was 8:30 so of course the place was packed. I scanned the list of beers for a non-ipa (or at least something not too hoppy) and landed on Anchor Steam. I know. So boring. But for a non-hops lover, not a ton to pick from. They do have stouts, yes, and they had two hefe type beers, and maybe it's my fault that I was being picky. But in all honesty, I wanted to be at Magnolia with a Kalifornia Kolsch in my hand.

I was very excited.  Umm..yeeeeeah. Not so much kids.  First off, we come in, smile at the patrons and make our way to the back. Now, I am all about being polite, and saying \"excuse me\" or \"thank you\" when someone does something for you. Apparently my manners are offensive to this crowd. I wait. Aaaaaaand wait for about 10 minutes before the bartender (who by the way was not serving anyone and saw me as I waved and smiled to lean and and ask for a recommendation) deigned to swagger on over to ask what I wanted. NICE. Thanks a lot bartender. You're an ASS. Luckily a kind patron who happened to be next \u00a0to me suggested the Cider and a nice Wheat based on my likes. Thank you kind sir!

Some of the other reviews complain about the bartenders being rude, but I haven't had that problem. I have noticed one or two times when the bartender has snapped at someone else at the bar who was doing some minor but agreeably obnoxious thing (I think the guy was waving at the bar tender for a long time... just obnoxious enough for \u00a0the reaction to maybe be justified but just minor enough for it to maybe be unjustified). In general though it's far from being a visit to the Soup Nazi, and after 6 - 10 visits I never had any issues with the service. I would even say most of the bartenders are friendly... in their own unique way.  The only thing keeping this place from getting five stars from me is that it is dive-y enough inside for it to actually detract from the experience.

(I live on Haight and she isn't from the city) This time I got incredibly rude service. This was on a weekday about 6pm so it was not busy by any means. The bartender (middle aged male with long curly hair) seemed to be deliberately ignoring us. And even when he did service us, it was in the rudest condescending way. My date (who has been a bartender for 7 years, and now manages a bar/grill chain) couldn't believe the way we were being treated. We brought back sushi (they do not serve food there and I have always brought food back in the past with no issues). The bartender was busy socializing most of the time, but when he did finally happen to walk to my end of the bar, and was asked very politely if we could get napkins.... He let out a notable sigh and gave us a serious look of disgust when handing them to me. Like previously mentioned my date has been a bar tender for quite a long time and we would never leave a mess or disrespect a bartender. The wait for the beers was absolutely ridiculous and took us nearly 20 minutes to get served (and the bar was NOT crowded... ...this was not a Friday night there) When I asked if we could switch our beers because they were warm, we were told \"No that's how they are supposed to be, you ordered it man\" as he rolled his eyes and walked away. I am still shocked that I left a tip but all my friends are bartenders (including my date) so I don't have the heart to not do that. If you get the right bartender then this place is awesome. But they just lost a customer who lives on Haight st.",

Good place for beer snobs and people open to trying new things. -There usually always people here during the night and it's a happening place on weekends. -Typical hipster joint. -It's connected to the restaurant next door so you can order food while inside the bar, that's pretty cool.  If you've been to Haight before ignore below the comments and maybe add two stars, because these is expected every where you go and you're probably accustomed general attitude of the area.  Cons:  -Cash only. -Ridiculously loud music, which you can't really hear everyone around you is shouting. -The interior area isn't very big and it's pretty much standing room only on the weekends. -Gets ridiculously crowded at night/weekends. -Disgusting bathroom. Expect urine/feces to be everywhere! -Pretentious vibe from most of the staff, bartenders especially. It's the hip thing now I guess instead of offering good services or educating your customers.  TIp: When ordering beer, know exactly what you want well ahead of time otherwise the bartenders will be dicks about it, hell if you take longer than 5 seconds to give them a tip, they'll give you that look like you're wasting their time. I was confused at some points I wasn't sure if I was the customer or if he was the customer. I ordered an item and the beer was all out, however the beer tap wasn't covered so to me it looked like it was available and all signs indicated that it was. Bartender looked at me like I asked him the dumbest question in the world before saying they were all out and moving onto the next customer. I then had to wait many minutes before I got serviced. Which was unfortunate because had he been a better bartender and covered the beer tap or scratched it off their list of beers like any semi decent bartender would have done, I would have ordered a beer that wasn't tapped out. It's stuff like this that rubs me the wrong way.  All in all I've experience much better dive bars and really aside from beer selection there's little reason I'd come here at least at peak times.

    "review_text": "A great craft beer establishment. \u00a0I come here every time I'm in San Francisco and am never disappointed. \u00a0What I usually do is come here either before or after my other favorite establishment in San Francisco, Zeitgeist, as the two bars are only about a 15 minute walk apart.  As a hop-head if I can walk into a bar see Pliny on the wall and still order something else, that is a very good sign. \u00a0 Last time I went about a month ago I ordered a Boneyard Nefarious and an El Toro Deuce IPA. \u00a0The Nefarious is a strong (10% abv) and well balanced Double IPA that comes in a Tulip glass, despite the light citrus notes I found the carmel maltiness to be a little too dominant. The El Toro Deuce Imperial IPA had a heavy body and I did not enjoy it as much as the Nefarious as it was even more malty and sweet. \u00a0Looking back I probably would have been happier getting a Pliny or Blind Pig, but if you don't try something new you won't ever truly know you palette.  Ok back to Toronado as an establishment. \u00a0It has your typical craft beer bar decor and there is an extra room in the back with additional seating, where the music is not as loud (as chosen on the jukebox near the rear of the bar). \u00a0The bartenders are typically busy so be prepared to say what you want from the board and have your cash in hand (this is a cash only establishment). \u00a0You don't come here for the service or conversation with the bartender, you come here for the beer. \u00a0That being said my wife and I came here on a week night last time and we were able to ask a few questions about the beers on the board to help us decide what we wanted to order. \u00a0  One last tip, go next door to Rosamunde Sausage Grill and get yourself something to pair with your beverage.",

Did I mention they rotate beers and let you taste them before buying? They always have one to two good Porters or Stouts on tap, which is rare, and the high alcohol content of many of their delicious beers is enough to knock you on your ass.   Other perks include the half door that greets you at the front, the hours of entertainment provided by reading the bumper stickers on the wall, the eclectic and often good looking crowd, and the bartenders who remember your names and drinks of choice, even if they can get a bit rude from time to time.   Tip: If you haven't already the Barley Wine Festival hosted by the Toronado is a MUST.",

    "review_text": "The Toronado's taps are among the best in the Bay Area, but you can have a more enjoyable experience if you remember a few simple rules. 1) Don't overdress. No one will be impressed, particularly the bartenders. 2) If you're hungry, stop at the excellent Rosamunde Sausage Grill next door and place your order. Beer loves sausages. You will be told to return in 5-10 minutes to pick it up. You are welcome to bring your sausage in a yellow basket into the bar as long as you clean up after yourself. 3) There really is a caste system at the Toronado; it's the \"regulars\" and everybody else. If you belong to the latter category, do not expect any conversation or pleasantries or any other sort of human interaction with the bartenders. Don't take it personally, they treat everybody this way. 4) Know what you want. There's a beer board at the back of the bar. Study it and be ready to place your order when the bartender acknowledges you. No questions, no conversation. Grab your beer, tip $1 and find a place to drink it. As you drink your first one, strategize about your second. A session beer, under 5.5% abv (I like Allagash White as my \"thinking beer\"), is a good start; you can always go higher with your next beers. 5) Get to know your neighbors. Unlike the bartenders, most of your fellow beer drinkers are quite friendly and more than willing to share information and beer knowledge. This can help you make your next beer decision. 6) Finally, try to pick a day and time when it's not likely to be too busy. Mid-afternoons are perfect, even on weekends. The experience is literally night and day.",

It's been a rough week, and sometimes a girl needs a fiendishly good I.P.A in a place where everyone leaves her to her own devices  I've been searching high and low for a gnome and was seriously envious of their little pointy hated friend shooting me a mocking smile from high above the bar. The wall is littered with photos, some aged and from what appears to be like decades ago. \u00a0\"Behind blue Eyes\" played, and my severely mopey countenance and increasingly inebriated ass identified with the selection, in a way that made me think these were my people.   My musings were briskly interrupted by the questioning yell of \"Steve?!? Nick?!?\" The half door by the entryway makes the ideal platform for Rosamunde, the hot dog joint next door, to try and pinpoint its wandering customers. The \"no dogs allowed\" sign is entertaining in an ironic way, given that there were two furry critters taking turns at emitting piercing howls.   Beers on draught are proudly marqueed high to the left of the bar. In addition to their list of draughts, they have an extensive bottled beer selection. Unfortunately, the available selection differs slightly from what is advertised on the website, so you may have to hope the beer you've had your eye on is still there. But overall, their selection is pretty goddamned decent, and almost all of their seats were taken when I popped in at 1:30pm on a weekday. Apparently everyone else had the same great idea of extending their lunch hour to down a few pints, although my guess is no one there really works standard nine to five hours in business casual.   I got extremely excited, I mean sexually, by how many hot scruffy dudes populated the place - and were genuinely nice. I had serious thoughts of blowing off the rest of my workday and my income, but I figured that wouldn't be the wisest or most appreciated use of my time. Another charming touch was the dude sitting on a barstool, burping his ABCs as his dog yelped in accompaniment.",

I would drop out of school and focus primarily from avoiding liver failure and trying every beer known to mankind!  Maybe its because I am use to the bro scene in north orange county with its L.A prices for drinks but Toronado is what every bar should be. I love the fact that they dont serve mix drinks and only except cash. Credit cards take a portion of the profits and people really shouldnt be buying boos with credit....  What other place can you spend $60 and buy rounds for friends for what seemed forever.......Keep those 4 and 5's on your menu toronado!",

Honestly if you give out beer, ppl will drink up anywhere, so those who like to drink so much and doesn't care about the surroundings. Go ahead. Well, I am a social drinker, so I don't really end up drinking that much. So I can honest give you a real hand review of this place unlike some others. First off, to first time drinkers, Haights is far from the most clean up area in SF. It's kinda a downer type of bar. The place only take Cash. If you have a Card, I wouldn't even try to use it, as it's seems like they might do something that isn't kewl with it. The good part about the bar is that the drinks are $4 for beers. The baretenders are far from clean, and totally smell like left over bong juice spit. \u00a0They are kinda rude as hell. The old man bartender can be such a perv to women. The women there are equally rude as the man. The size of the restroom is small, and smells even worst. Seeing that, it is a bar, and in the Haights. I let that pass. It's somewhat crowded, and most of the drinkers are young. Still, there are better bars than this.   Supposely it's the best beer in San Francisco, I kinda doubt that, but it's not the worst. Hours: 11:30 AM to 2:00 AM. Happy Hour isn't until 6:00 PM. You can pick from 50 Quality Beers on Draughts and 100 Bottled Bottles. Check it out, if you need a drink.",

Rockin' rollin' juke too, nice plus. A favorite for lazy Sundays and any other day, really.  2007 Update: It's a bummer to have to write this, as I have loved the Toronado for years, since it opened in fact. Amazing beer selection, for that this place has no equal. I've also put up with the surly staff--another case where this joint has no equal. Recently though I witnessed a case where one bartender really crossed the line, tossing a poor guy out on his ass for no reason. Fake-punk dude with lots of tattoos and an \u00a0angry-frat-boy attitude. The kind spoiling for a fight. Now I don't mind surly--hell I'm surly most of the time--but when did the Toronado's trademark surliness cross the line into anger? And I mean dangerous anger. This place is now downright scary.

But for me I just couldn't get over the sensory overload around me.  My fella went back on his own later in the week during the day and he said it was much calmer and it was relatively easy to speak to the bartenders and get some schooling on beer.

The bar is dive bar lovers dream. \u00a0In my opinion, only to be slightly bested by Zeitgeist. \u00a0Plenty of stickers around the bar, retired tap handles line the room and metal is usually blasting over the speakers.  I visited with a friend (local) for a few pints on a Tuesday night. \u00a0The place was pretty crowded even at 10 PM. \u00a0We stayed until closing and enjoyed plenty. \u00a0I think one of the main selling points for people is that Pliny the Elder seems to always be on tap. \u00a0I did not see this at any other San Francisco beer bars I visited. \u00a0  If you are into good music (not that pop/r&amp;b or clubby shit) that most places play today, know/appreciate your beer and enjoy $5/$6 pints, definitely stop in.",

It takes elbows of steel to wedge your way to the bar... if you haven't had a chance to review the giant beer board in the time it takes you to reach the bar, take a step back and let someone else go first. Some dude got all the way to the front and when the bartender gave him his attention the dude turned and looked up at the board and called out a brew. Smart bartender simply yelled back, \"I can't hear you when you're looking away\" and helped the next dude.  The bartenders are amazingly helpful and cool, even with all the yelling and screaming going on. Once they've given you their attention, they'll listen and give you small tastings if you ask.  So yeah, in one night I had beers that tasted like pomegranate, chocolate, coffee, yeast, and old leather shoes. Nice selection, folks.",

This is the only time I go to Toronado, and the only time all year I drink Barley Wine. People come from all over the country, aficionados of the \"premium high gravity beer\" circuit, and like any gathering with a following of super nerdy enthusiasts, just add alcohol and you have a rockin' good time. I'm not so sure I want you there, dear reader, but hopefully if you have a marginal interest you'll have forgotten about it by the time 2009 rolls around.  In case you decide to attend this overcrowded nerdfest, here are a few tips: standouts from this year's offerings: Gnarlywine 2006 from the Lagunitas Brewing Company and Cucupa Barely Wine from Mexicali. According to the spreadsheet they give you (I told you, geeks), we sampled a lot more than this but I, um, forget.

Never in my life have a been so turned off by a bar's negative atmosphere. Not even a good beer selection, pleasant company or kick-ass sausages from Rosamunde next door can light the way through the dark cloud of nastiness strewn by the bartenders. You just don't want to line the pockets of those people or the management that continues to hire these people.   I'm a friendly, chill person, so you can believe it took a lot for me to write this. Each time myself and many friends went to this bar we chose to give them the benefit of the doubt and approached it blank slate. And routinely, without fail, we met with piss poor attitudes of the waitstaff. A helping side of RUDE is what you'll be served here. And maybe you like that if you are into S&amp;M and \u00a0stuff.  You know, I get being bummed out when you are at work sometimes. But bringing it to paying customers also looking for a break from the difficulties of normal life is just completely thoughtless.

The crowd looks decidedly early-late 20s, hipster, with funky hairdos and tattoos to match. Not one shred of a pastel color on any of them.  Where the bar lacks in decorum, dress, or the like, they've channeled into their beer selection, which reads sophisticatedly by region and vintage in a way usually reserved for the haughty wine. If you don't know your beers don't ask the hard-looking bartender with the accent and arm tats, but the female one with the chunky blonde highlights, as she's much more amicable to the unfamiliar.  Happy hours make for cheaper beers, but not really by much. They should consider taking another dollar off to compete with other happy hours. Disappointed to find no trace of bar snacks, not even peanuts or pretzels. You'll be dependent on the sausage shop next door, and hopefully it's open when you're coming to this bar.",

Then there will be the people who love all the wrong things about it and hate all the good things Coppola did.   Well I'm going to try and be smart and love all the right things about Toronado. It is a dive. The place smells like bad Rosamunde Sausages and spilled PBR. The bartenders get impatient with you if you're a retard and will pretend not to hear you. And the crowd is definitely a mix of Haight stoners and old craft brew geeks. And the bathroom reeks of vomit and urine. But what is redeeming out of all of this? The tap list.  My boyfriend and I got to try the new Nectar Ales Black Xantus recipe, and felt so ballsy that we made crazy black and tans with Russian River's Blind Pig. I know they don't separate but blending the two tasted like heaven. Not many places offer great enough beer worth blending.  We had just come back from City Beer with a bottle of Midnight Sun's TREAT Imperial Chocolate Porter; lo and behold, Toronado had it on tap and it was amazing. Not often can we buy a bottle rated 99 on ratebeer and find it on tap in the same city.  I'm 100% behind Toronado. I'm sure it smells more the later it gets, but if you have enough of their amazing tap list, I'm sure you won't mind. What's there to hate about Toronado when you have Rosamunde next door, 10%+ beers on tap, and a lively if not slightly amusing clientele?  Word to the wise: Bring cash, and don't be surprised if you find someone lighting up their pipe outside.",

We came over to Toronado with our food from the grill (it's a cooperative joint venture, feel free to order your sausage on a bun and sit at the larger, more spacious tables in the bar, but be polite and order a beer while you're at it!)   Crowded and noisy, it's a typical beer bar with an extremely large assortment of beers on tap. Check the chalkboard up on the wall to find an option for everyone, even those that dislike beer (like me). Favourite brewery was represented (Russian River holla!), and they carry kriek and a pomegranate cider, both of which were mild on the beer taste and heavy on the fruit (my preferred drink!) \u00a0A waiter will come by and pick up not only your empty glasses but also your trays from the grill next door, so no worrying about running it all back.  Only one complaint, for which they lose a star: despite having several Russian River brews on tap, they were missing my favourite (Consecration!) \u00a0I saw \"Russian River\" written on the menu and got a happy little tingle in my pants in the hopes I could get my favourite beer, but sadly they weren't carrying it. I'm not sure if it just wasn't in stock or season at the time, or if they don't carry it ever, but I was quite disappointed (although I'll admit that it's self-inflicted disappointment, since I allowed myself to get all squee when I saw the brewery name). I was pretty happy with my kriek, but it wasn't Consecration!",

If you love beer, this place has 'em  AMBIANCE Packed on a Friday night, not quite rowdy, but there's definitely an edge to the crowd.   If you've been to a dive bar, then you know what it's like.  Still, it's more of a transient dive bar. I'm sure there's locals here, but it felt more like a destination dive bar than a haunt for people in the neighborhood.  THE BEER This place has beers! Lot's of them. And they are priced what you would expect to pay at a place that cares about their beer. Most things are around $5-$6  The beers are craft and awesome.   THE TIP If you can find standing room or a table near the front of the bar, stay there.  There are two bathrooms at the back. There's a seating area with a bathroom and a hallway at the back with a bathroom. In the middle of the two is a jukebox, and decent room to stand around. There's a reason there's room there, it stinks! The smell is pretty bad, or at least it's bad on a busy night.  WHY 3 STARS AND NOT 4 or 5? They have a ton of beers, and even \"holy crap, Pliny!\" But the beer selection just isn't enough for me to make it one of my more-favored bars.",

It just so happened to be the same day as their Barley wine Festival so figured it'd be crowded, and yes, it was. There were so many varieties of barley wine (close to 100 maybe? I can't recall but the barley wine sheet was two sided). Even, the board that lists all of their beers was down to about 10 to accommodate the barley wines.   Anyway, there were some hard core barley wine aficionados. After getting a sausage next door at Rosamunde's, we found a table in the adjacent room with empty chairs across from two aficionados. OK, so 3 hot and lovely ladies sitting across from these fellas, and did they bother to look up at us?!? UM NO! It was amazing how engrossed they were with their barley wine, sipping from their glasses, discussing how hoppy and malty each were, and ranking them on their sheet.  However, the table behind us was a complete 180 from ours. Talk about young, rowdy straight out of college kids. They were so loud and annoying, and one girl's laugh was just so painful to hear. *And who wears white jeans in the middle of winter?!? (that's for you, Amy!) Seriously, we downed the dogs so we could get the hell out of that room and back to the main bar area!   Back in the main area, we chilled by the front door and drank our beers. We started talking to one of the bouncers, who ended up giving us a few of his valentine cards (you know, the old school elementary school kind with the cartoon characters). I was happy to get one, even though it was a hand me down. Dude, it was a Scooby-Doo one! Love it and love you bouncer dude! It was another solid outing at Toronado!

Try other beers like Damnation and Death &amp; Taxes as well! They have sour beers too if you're into that.   There are pizza and wings you can grab at nearby restaurants. The tamale lady comes in around 11-12 and sells pork/chicken/beef tamales for $5. This is a must try!! They are so bomb!

They shouldn't have to have it since you can get it across the street anyway. They had Rochefort in bottles, Orval night with the distributor opening some seasonal bottles, I had Kwak on tap out of a nice eccentric Kwak glass. Many many beers on tap. A good beer pub should smell like a brewery a bit. I love the Torondado and God bless the Bay Area.",

He knew us well as the Toronado is like a dream come true. The crowds can get thick there at night and on weekends, but it's heavenly in the afternoon when the bar is emptyish. It's a beer-lovers dream come true.  Their offerings are many and well-chosen. It's remarkable that you can get so many great beers in one bar. And the bartenders will guide you well - I can't tell you how many fantastic beers I've had there simply due to the bartenders caring enough to make sure I know what sorts of special kegs have come in recently. I read some of the other yelp reviews - and maybe some of the bartenders can be a bit surly at first, but if you act like a civilized person, tip well and are interested in what you're drinking, you will be rewarded with some of the best beer guides around. \u00a0  And what's the most perfect neighbor a bar like the Toronado could have? Yup, a sausage shop. Go next door, buy a mouth-watering sausage, bring it back to the bar and enjoy one of the best drink+food combos possible.",

PROS: - Right next door to Rosamunde's, which has some great sausages you can bring into the bar to consume with your beer. - The bartenders are pretty knowledgeable on beer and provide complimentary tasters if you have a hard time deciding. - Excellent selection of beers.

Yeah, I like beer but from the menu you can't even tell what beers are the darkest or of what persuasion to make a good choice. Choosing a random beer doesn't work out too well for most of us.

So I take one for the team and approach the bar to order for all 3 of us. \u00a0The bartender kinds of looks at me funny, but gives a quick nod to indicate \"what do you want\" and I ordered. \u00a0A few seconds later, I pay the man plus tip and now I got 3 beers \u00a0and 2 hands so I have to make 2 trips. \u00a0When I go back to pick up the third beer, a guy at the bar starts talking to me like he knows me, but quickly he realizes that he has mistaken me for someone else. \u00a0So then I start to wonder why the bartender looked at me funny. \u00a0Do I look like a regular? \u00a0Am I dressed funny? \u00a0Do I have spinach stuck between my teeth? \u00a0I mean the bartender looked at me up and down before taking my order, so I am not sure what gives. \u00a0I guess that was just my experience at Toronado. \u00a0Second round went a little more smooth with the same bartender. \u00a0All in all, I liked my experience here and would return with a group of people, if for no other reason than to explore more of the area of Haight street.",

I went here twice on my recent trip to SF, both in the afternoon around 4-5pm. The place apparently stays busy at all hours with regulars. The first visit was uneventful. My friend ordered one round for us. We drank the round and left. It was a quality German hefeweizen. One extra star.  I returned a second time with a different friend who loves beer. After I looked at the beer list and made a decision, I got the attention of the bartender. I was standing behind a row of seated customers, so I moved to the end of the bar so as not to shout over their heads. (it's loud in there) When I got to the end and tried to order, the bartender yells, \"are you gonna stand over here or stand over there!?\" I was caught off guard by this, thinking I could stand wherever I wanted within earshot. I glanced around to see regular patrons cracking smiles, as I'm sure they're used to tourists receiving a hard time. Well, enjoy the show!  Since I'd now forgotten the name of my selection, I said \"my friend wants to taste something.\" My friend leaned in and said he wanted to sample \"Pliny the Elder\". The bartender brings over the sample glass then promptly gets out from behind the bar and walks off. The other bartender follows suit. ..... !!  I never got to order anything, but at least my friend got to taste his. We decided to leave when a couple minutes passed and it was obvious we weren't going to be served.  Speaking on their selection, they do have rare and local beers, but I've seen way better selection at bars in Austin (Draught House). Exclusivity doesn't make beer any tastier for me, sorry.  \u00a0 I didn't recognize but two or three names out of their entire beer list, and if I'd asked the bartender questions to guide me, he most likely wouldn't have helped because I'm not a regular or I don't already know everything there is to know about beer.

Antlers and deer heads, tons of Belgian beer paraphernalia line the walls. Poorly lit, with a metal bar top. It seems like they just went to a junk yard and threw this place together in a day.  I was slightly worried, because I had been warned about the service here, so I didn't really know what to expect. Our bartender was an older guy with a pony tail and terrible breath, didn't catch his name. He wasn't a dick, but I can see why people might not like the service they'd get there. He seemed very knowledgeable about the beer he served and seemed slightly nazi like about the glassware. Sort of odd, because it almost seemed like if he was out of the glassware he might not even give you the beer. I remember joking with a friend of mine that I was going to drink a Cantillon out of the bottle here, and he said that I would get kicked out if I did something like that. I completely understand what he means now.  The most impressive thing to me is that they store their bottles at the proper temperature. I've never seen that done before and it was a very nice surprise.  The selection here isn't really as great at I figured it would be, but if you're an average beer lover you'll enjoy this place considerably. They cover all their bases.",

    "review_text": "Great beer selection but some of the biggest pricks in the City work there. Ever since the owner's girlfriend or wife, whatever the unlucky bastard calls her, took over, most of the staff has turned over. She is one of the nastiest people I've ever met in the City (I'm pretty sure she's from Jersey). I usually peer in through the door, if she's there, I keep walking and head for the Geist.  The only two people that remain working there from the old days are the grouchiest guys that I know (we'll call them Captain and Tennille). Luckily for me, they're both friends of mine for almost 2 decades or I'd probably walk right out like I do when I see the owners other half.  Anyway, there are some great people that work and/or hangout there. Tad (short guy w/long hair&amp; glasses) is one of the nicest guys you'll meet, and Johnny Davis (Tues afternoon shift) is probably the coolest bartender in the City (has won numerous awards for this) and is a part owner of the currently burned down bar Benders.  One word to the wise, if the Captain (fat guy that waddles around) or Tennile (Howard Stern/Joey Ramone Lookalike) are working, treat them as you would the Soup Nazi. Do not approach the bar unless you have your order ready and by no means do it holding cash in your hand for them to see. When and only when you are formally acknowledged, order the beer and wait for them to state what you owe. Don't try to be friendly with them. If they make small talk with you (which they won't), then you can talk, otherwise just shut your snapper.  The night crew is different, but not many real neighborhood regulars go there at night. It's mostly a beer geek or Marina type crowd. The real crew can be found there at Johnny's shift from 11:30am-4pm on Tuesdays.",

I was glad I tried it and glad they had it on Tap.   I also tried a beer from Moonlight Brewing that was damn good and got to learn the backstory about how the brewer used to work for Schlitz. There were a number of other good beers on tap, Big Bear and others from Cali, but I didn't stay long.   They have a good selection of bottled beers as well and you can buy them to go. As I sat at the bar, some guy came in and bought up all the Pliny the Elder they had.   I must say, I wish there were as many German beers on tap as Belgians and as many American beers as both.

In LA and during my stint in the OC, we had the Yardhouse, which probably has more beers to offer than Toronado, an extensive food menu, and much more seating. But- Toronado has my heart, and I will continue to have a slight contempt for the chain, mass marketed concept behind the Yardhouse, though I will continue to frequent them for their massive beer selection. Toronado is dark, dingy on the inside, has limited seating and a pretty dirty, ghetto bathroom. Happy hour is also from noon to 6 pm everyday and they have an awesome selection of brews from all over- from obscure microbrews to delicious belgian ales and wheat beers. This place gets packed on Thursday, Fridays, and Saturdays and it tends to get hard to find seating. Also- they have a bring your own food policy, and with Toronado's proximity to Rosamunde Sausage Grill, as well as a yummy middle eastern and ethiopian place, you have the best of both worlds. Delectable \u00a0food and delicious beers. I have heard complaints about the gruff service, but I have never had an issue. I usually ask the bartender for his reccomendation and I seem to get better tasting beer, and better service that way.I have spent hours upon hours on end in this place, drinking beer after beer and getting more and more wasted. I discovered my love for the 10% ABV Maredsous beer from Belgium here.

When I get a beer by my place in South Beach I typically pay $6-$8 a beer, so this was huge for me!  For my second beer i wanted to try something different so I asked the bartender for a recommendation. At first he was kind of stand offish and told me \"they're all good, just pick something\". After I mentioned I wanted to try something and told him others I like, he steered me a bit which was appreciated.  I DEFINITELY found my new beer geek home!!",

Pros: 1.) Beer! \u00a0Toronado served Russian River, Drakes, Bear Republic, Sierra Nevada etc. long before these Bay Area breweries improved their distribution. \u00a0Toronado is a testament to the vitality of craft brewing in the Bay Area. 2.) The barleywine festival rocks your socks off. \u00a0Just get there super early. 3.) The bartenders are very friendly, as long as you know your elbow from your asshole and you don't act like a dipshit. \u00a0This is not a lounge, it's a bar. \u00a0Be respectful to the bartenders, tip, and you get your beer. 4.) No food. \u00a0This is actually a good thing. \u00a0I don't want to belabor the point, but Toronado is a bar; if you are looking for a brewpub, go to the breweries themselves.  Cons: 1.) Toronado attracts hipsters. \u00a0If you love beer as much as I do, you have to bite the bullet and just ignore the Che Guevara t-shirts and nut-hugger jeans. \u00a0Years ago, this type of clientele would be persone non grate at Toronado. \u00a0To quote the immortal Bob Dylan, \"The times, they are a-changin'\". 2.) Seating can be fairly awful, because of the reason above. 3.) The glassware needs some updating. \u00a0I'm not really a hardass on this issue, as long as the glassware is clean (which it is), but the snifters are pretty beat up and need replacing.  If you love beer, have an ounce of patience, and can put up with the hipsters, Toronado is a must.",

Yes, you've reached a small sub-division of beer drinker's heaven. \u00a0  Some bars in the Lower Haight are sometimes reviled for their lack of a license to sell hard alcohol but when you've got this many varieties of excellent beer to get through, you soon forget about that shot of Jameson or Gin and Tonic. \u00a0The selection is unique with Death and Taxes, Lagunitas Sirius and Anchor Old Foghorn all on tap, not to mention a great variety of German beers and favorites from the Northwest region. \u00a0If you're bored with the beer selection at your favorite bar, give this place a visit and you may come back more than a few times.  I don't know why the bartenders are aloof. \u00a0We could speculate on it eternally. \u00a0Yes, they can be reiminiscent of Seinfeld's illustrious Soup Nazi (No Lager for You!!!) if you ask the wrong or too many questions. \u00a0The only advice I can offer is come prepared. \u00a0If you have a question, try to mention a comparison to another brand so they think you know what you're talking about and always have a back-up in mind.  Yeah the space kind of sucks and if you want to sit down get here early but I think the crowds are just a testament about how great it is to be able to go somewhere and actually have a huge array of beers not easily found elsewhere in the City all in one location.

(Such tourists!)  The jukebox pumped out patrons' choices of gritty, thumping rock and I was impressed to see Grinderman amongst the choices. Go Aussie music!  We'll be back even though we only have four days in SF.   Although can someone tell me how such a divey bar with rockstar cred has such clean, white toilets?",

Niners game was going on which I did not care to see because I, in the midst of my travels forgot to fix my bench on my fantasy team and sat my whole squad basically. I was pissed, too worn out by this time to be mad though.   We sat and met a few good people, packed as it was everyone was cool, no hostility, just niners fans cheering on the team. Got a seat at the bar fairly quick, only because it was behind the tv, I didn't care.   It was a punk/Hippy/Hipster feel in this place, but that doesn't clash like it would in the hometown, they all compliment each other perfectly. Excellent squad of breweries and soldier beers to go along with them. Tons of tap handles and cool stickers covered the walls, I believe Deer heads too..? Definitely a good stop.

It's exactly as good as the other million reviews here say it is, so I'll keep it short and sweet and just provide some Toronado-related tips and tricks:  - Most beers are $4-$6, most on the lower end of that, but note that even though everything appears to be the same price, the glass sizes are not at all consistent, so that's kind of how they can afford to sell you a portion of Angel's Share for $5. - Disregard any reviews that have to do with service. If this place improved their service the beer would become more expensive. It is fine the way it is. - The table situation may look really daunting, but there is a lot of turnover.

Alas, every evening I've been in, the place has been chock full of carefully groomed wannabe bohemian types. You know the sort - look like a homeless person, but has a two bedroom in the Haight and works for Google bringing down $150k.  Clientele aside, they have a phenomenal beer selection. Excellent range of class beers you'd expect to find, as well as brews on tap from ultra-micro sources like Russian River. ('Twas here I first discovered Pliny!) and beers are served up at the correct temperature, in their correct glassware.  As I mentioned, the evenings I've been in there, the place has been extremely busy, and it took some time to get served. The bartenders \u00a0definitely had an air of snobbishness about them, and if you haven't made up your mind by the time they call on you, be prepared for a tongue lashing. Thankfully I had the foresight to look over their beer menu (note - it's not over the bar, but sort of at a 90 degree angle to it as you walk in the door, so it is easy to miss) but witnessed many a poor soul on the business end of it, when all they want to do was enjoy their night out.  Don't buy into the hype too much. Be prepared to deal with the bohemian wannabes (including some of the staff) and bear in mind it's a bit of a dump, but outside of that... a great place to check out for some tremendous beers.",

I've been here a few times now, at all different times of the day, and all different days of the week. I think I definitely enjoy the daytime drinking vibe in the middle of the week moreso than the Friday night vibe. Even if that means having to drink with a bunch of alcoholic fat guys who have nothing else to do with their time and money than to buy beer, at least they're spending it on good beer. The staff here is hit or miss. It's mostly a bunch of snobby rude beer freaks who get offended if you ask a question about any of the beers. Unfortunately for them, I take great pleasure in annoying the shit out of somebody. It's what makes me smile inside. If someone makes it blatantly obvious that they think I'm a complete idiot for asking what the difference in taste is between the Rodenbach Red Ale and the Iron Springs Epiphany Amber, then clearly I'm going to start asking even dumber questions purely to piss them off even more. That's just how I operate.   But once I'm done having my fun with the rude bartenders, I thoroughly enjoy my delicious beer and good company.

Yes, the bathrooms are dirty and need to be repainted. Just hold your nose and get out as soon as you can. They're slated to be painted again in 2011.  Yes, they play the same Rush song on the jukebox every night. Just ignore it. I usually do.  Regardless I love the place.  Here's some tips for newbies:  (1) Don't ask asinine questions. No one likes asinine questions especially bartenders at an extremely busy bar. If it's a slow night they'll be willing to answer for you.   (2) Be patient. The service is horrible, but it's worth the wait.  (3) Try something new or something you haven't heard of. If you don't like it, then that's okay. \u00a0It will still make you feel good.  (4) If you like dark beers, try the Maredsous 8 or the Aventinus. If you like Budweiser or other pissy American beers, try the Radeberger. It's a nice, light pilsner that will make you happy.  (5) If you're from the Marina, dress in a ratty pair of jeans and a t-shirt. Blend in. I know this sound really snobby, but the truth of the matter is that you're less likely to be served in a quick manner if you are dressed like you're a member of the Yale rowing team. When in Rome and all...  (6) Close the friggin' door when you go in and out. You weren't born in a barn, were you?  Follow these tips and you'll have a great night.",

Which brings us to the good stuff. \u00a0It's what you came here for: the beer. \u00a0They've got the goods, no doubt. \u00a0It's easily one of the best in the country for beer nerds. \u00a0Certainly not THE best, but among the top 10 probably, top 20 definitely. \u00a0Serious artisanal stuff from Belgium, a ton of west coast micros and even some random German and British stuff on tap, and all in good condition (no damned frosted mugs here!). \u00a0They don't mess around with much pedestrian junk, though of course it's not ALL good. \u00a0But the owner knows his stuff...it holds up to scrutiny from the most active beer hounds in the country (beer people come here from all over the world, in fact).  Another very cool aspect is that although they don't offer any food, you can BYOF from anywhere you want. \u00a0Lots of folks go next door to the sausage place, which is indeed quite tasty, but there's burritos and Indian food nearby too. \u00a0Heck, bring your own sandwich from home if you want. \u00a0This is a killer policy IMHO, because you can enjoy the beer you want AND the food you want, instead of being limited to the food they might have offered. \u00a0Falling Rock in Denver really needs to consider this option.  While you have to deal with the dodgy staff in order to get a glass in front of you, play it cool and you'll probably do fine...ever since I figured out how to behave here, I've never had any problem. \u00a0And it's worth it for the beer they're offering.",

    "review_text": "Went here for the first time this past Saturday which was a hoot of a good time. Went to get sausages first which were excellent and they let you take them into the bar to eat. A great partnership between the dank beer bar and the dank sausage shop directly next door. Was throughly amazed by their selection of beers upon entering. Looked over the menu for a while and noted the following brewery selections; Dogfish Head, Russian River, Drakes, Sprecher, Petrus, Chimay, Moonlight, Anchor, Anderson Valley, Speakeasy and more. I also noticed someone cracking what looked to be like a Belgium Longneck bottle of something heady. After a few pints, I saw that they also had a beer menu besides the one hanging on the wall. I may have missed out on some rarities, but I was not dissapointed with the selections we chose. Between the four of us, we each had 2 pints and shared sips of each others. Pliny The Elder, Midas Touch, Damnation, Death and Taxes were noted as being really fresh and tasty. The glassware selection and pairing was superb. The bar is not too large and from what I've heard really starts to fill up at night. Luckily we were there early afternoon, but I did notice it starting to fill up rather quickly. The lighting is somewhat dark and the decor was a history book of heady beers. They keep all their previous taps and I must say there are a lot of them. These were in addition to the 30-45 taps they currently were serving. My only complaint was the bartender could have been more polite and attentive. She didn't acknowledge me at the bar when I went up twice and served a couple others before me that came up after me. It would not have hurt them to have a 2nd bartender working either. Next time I'll be bringing my notepad to take notes on their selections and tastings.  If you visit San Francisco, this is a must stop when vising Haight Street. Check this place out in Lower Haight, grab a pint and a sausage and then head up to Haight Ashbury to check out Amoeba Records.",

To quote the email I received from Urban Daddy:  \"BrewDog's Sink the Bismarck, available for tasting this Sunday, 5-7pm, The Jug Shop, and this Monday, 6-10pm, The Toronado\" \u00a0 \"They only made 100 bottles of this monster ale, which means that Sunday's and Monday's BrewDog tastings are your only opportunities to drink it.\"  Sounded like an official event to me. And we were most excited to sample this quadruple IPA. We arrived to a packed house around 6:30pm, the bar was crammed with people. I'm thinking it must be a hot event. We make our way to the bar.  The female bartender had no clue what I was talking about. The male bartender was too busy to help her out. She pulled off 2 shot glasses of foam from one of the taps and slung them on the bar in front of me as she walked away.  I got the male bartenders attention and explained what we were there for, he quickly spouted off sizes and prices (which I couldn't catch above the din) and condescendingly explained that they don't do formal tastings, you have to buy (one of the sizes of beers I still had yet to catch) yada yada. Then walked away.   I would have gladly bought 2 pints of said IPA, but was so put off by the experience up to that point, it wasn't worth me flagging one of them down again and hoping they got it right. Which makes me realize why I don't go to hip bars anymore. I'm too damn old. and I got a man at home. who also loves to drink beer. at home. Thanks for being such a trooper on this failed beer run, G.   So who was wrong, Urban Daddy or Toronado? Or was it a third party, me?

It's not a big place; there's a small back room with some table seating. \u00a0The night we were in around 9pm, it was possible to get a spot fairly easily, and by the time we left an hour later, spots at the bar had even opened up. \u00a0The crowd was pretty mellow - a bunch of couples and small groups enjoying beer. \u00a0The table next to us was a flock of programmers getting drunk and discussing coding standards.

Unlike Blind Tiger, the clientele here is a lot more diverse - biker dudes, beer snobs, after work professionals, hipsters and locals. Beer list on tap was amazing - they had freakin Pliny the Elder on tap from Russian River. \u00a0Right there, I knew this place was special. \u00a0Beer list on tap looked to be about 60 in my estimation with a focus - but not all - on local craft brews. \u00a0A few well respected favorites like Founders could be found as well.  Please is an L-shaped bar with indie music playing with a long bar when you walk in and high tables along the other side of the wall. \u00a0There's a corner room tucked in the back near the bathrooms with a couple of tables for a larger group. \u00a0Everyone seemed to hang out front.  Walls are decorated with numerous and various microbrewery tin signs against a emerald green painted wall. \u00a0Like - and this is not a slam - a TGIFs feel is they were only beer signs. \u00a0I liked the look - and don't like TGIF.  Tucked in a cool little area of SF of various shops, stores, restaurants and bars. \u00a0Street parking not too bad. \u00a0Cash only bar. Or as the say here, \"Johnny Cash Only\"  Will be back",

My friends and I ended up getting the Chocolate Beer - so good. A dark beer, which I guess I'm not a fan of usually, but with chocolate it tasted so yummy and interesting.  Best tip is that you can bring over hot dogs from next door (Rosamunde Grill) and eat them in the bar. Everyone does it. Gourmet hot dogs + beer = perfect Friday night. There is even some staff member that takes away your hot dog trays and brings them back next door!!  Also, if you are not a fan of hot dogs, there was this lady with a cart that came into the bar, selling Epanadas. They were kinda small, but great if you don't wanna go next door for hot dogs/don't wanna wait for the hot dogs.   Place gets kinda loud though, so you have to shout. Also, it's hard finding seats here since everyone seems to come at the same time and no one seems to have the courtesy to get up once they're done.

I asked him for recommendations on other bars and restaurants in the area since my drinking partner Christina had just moved to town.   I have mixed reviews about the bartenders. The bartender Johnny was cool. He made sure to keep the beer flowing all the while chatting up the customers. There was a shift change while we were there and two bartenders came on to replace Johnny. The woman was pretty cool but ignored me when I asked to buy a shirt. The guy with the dreads was awful. He did not even acknowledge most of the customers. Truthfully I am really not sure what his job is other than to walk back and forth behind the bar looking bored and annoyed. Thankfully we got there when Johnny was working. We decided to head out and find somewhere else to drink after experiencing these bartenders.   Will I go back? Yeah.

Just don't ask for one of those ubiquitous domestic lagers or attempt to pay with plastic. You will be frowned down. \u00a0(There's an ATM in the back.)  If you lack much experience with beers other than the aforesaid lagers, you can ask the bartender or any of the regulars. \u00a0Most will be happy to offer advice on the various beers and ales on offer.  Toronado doesn't serve food, but until 10 pm \u00a0you can get sausages from Rosamunde Sausage Grill next door (q.v.) and bring them in to eat with your beer. \u00a0Just tell the person at the grill \"it's for next door\" and come back for it in a few minutes.  Several times a year there are special events, such as the Barleywine Festival. \u00a0If you're a beer snob, you won't want to miss these.  Caveats: \u00a0Street parking in this neighborhood is hellaciously difficult. \u00a0The duration of vacancy of a legal parking space is measured in seconds. \u00a0Take a cab or the Muni or spend half an hour cruising for parking. \u00a0As the Toronado's reputation has grown, so have the crowds. \u00a0Since the bar opens at midday, the afternoons or Sunday evenings are best for a less crowded experience. You'll feel like a sardine on Friday or Saturday nights. \u00a0When it's crowded, it can take a while to be served. \u00a0Be patient and stand your ground. \u00a0Eventually someone will see you and wait on you. \u00a0The better you tip, the sooner you'll get your second round. \u00a0IDs are scrupulously checked here, either by the bartenders during the day or the person at the door after 9pm. \u00a0Have it out.",

But if I were, I think this place would be great- it's like the cheeseboard of beers, so many choices it could be stressful. Located in the lower Haight, this hard core dive bar is filled with hipsters, hippies, and hipster-hippies (and no doubt some people who transcend any classification whatsoever ) completely at one with their myriad brewed creations. Oh it's dirty. And it's loud too. Oh and there's barely anywhere to sit and the bathrooms are filled with interesting yet entertaining graffiti. But that is indeed part of the charm. You come here to drink beer, and that is what you get. Not much else to distract your beer drinking bliss. I think there is one cider on the menu, which I tried and it was pretty good. So if you come here knowing all this, you won't be let down. Toronado does a good job at serving beer. Period. Quick update: I was at Toronado last night and brought in a bag of cherries. The guy checking IDs at the door told me that if he saw cherry pits on the floor that he was going to hunt me down later that night and make me memorize the phone book. Scary threat- make sure not to leave cherry pits on the floor!",

I kid you not. \u00a0Don't miss the barleywine festival. \u00a0If you didn't know, Barleywine has like 15% alcohol, and is basically really really strong beer, that is usually really really tasty.]  4) Go buy a gourmet sausage from Rosamunde grill, next door, and enjoy it with your beer at the Toronado. \u00a0Rosamunde rents their space from the Tornado, and the grillmaster at Rosamunde will even come bus tables in the Toronado every once in a while (though you really should bring the baskets back for the guy). \u00a0My Rosamunde review (and guide) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/g9LSMqUK5dkUcmpgTnU-dQ?hrid=hkxBnEpt1MAu_busmemIhg\">yelp.com/biz/g9LSMqUK5dk\u2026</a>  Attn: \u00a0wine snobs...the Toronado will make you love your beer with a passion.",

Toronado is an intense bar. Intense only because once you enter you are bound to get drunk. This place only serves beer and wine however the beer they have here is no joke. They have about one million (not really but emphasizing) beers on tap. I made my way up to the bar and decided to order two beers at once since it seemed \u00a0there was a long wait. I order two Magnolia's Proving Ground IPA and the bartender looked and me and asked if I have had this before, I said yes and he handed me my beers with a look of \"I warned you\" on his face. I chugged the first beer in 5 minutes and began on my second.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile my friends all began drinking and after trying multiple beers they found what is called the Denogonizer (sp?) which is about 12% alcohol content. Next thing I know everyone is feeling more chatty, people leave so we move in on a table there was about 10 of us in our party. Drink. drink. drink. go pee. drink. drink .drink. go pee again. ew there is puke in the bathroom, dont care go pee anyway. drink. drink.

Took down some He'brew Rye. I don't really understand the brewing process but it was brewed or aged(?) in rye whisky oak barrels.  Soooo good. Almost all the beers are under $5 and you could go here 100 times and drink different beer every time.  In fact in writing this, I decided I really need to go here more often. I haven't down the Rosamunde Sausage/Tornado combo yet, but it seems to be all the rage and goes together like fixed gears and tight jeans.",

When I entered the bar, I couldn't help but notice that everyone looked the same-all white men in their thirties with a grungy motorcycle look (which i'll grant is a good look but it was very noticeable to my female friend and I that we were the only females in that crowd).   The bartender pretended that my friend and I (both female - and we were the only females there) did not exist despite that the bar was not too busy. We asked a man sitting at the bar to order drinks for us to see whether we were being ignored b/c we were women, and he was able to get the bartender's attention pretty much immediately, and without really trying. That was very disappointing to us, and especially to my friend who is very into beer and who had been looking forward to checking out the bar for a while.  Next, the bouncer, who had already ID'd us at the door, specifically came into the bar to find me and ID'd me again. I am 28 (turning 29 next month) and do not look like I'm under 21. However, I am half Asian and I can't help but wonder, being the only Asian in the bar, whether I was targeted because of it. I left immediately after.  I told my friend about the experience and he told me that he had gone to the same bar last summer with his friend who is Mexican. The bouncer told the Mexican friend that he didn't like him because he looked \"sketchy.\" They immediately left.  Bottom line: This place has a great beer selection, but a pervasive sexist and racist atmosphere. Just consider that before you step in and support it with your hard-earned money.",

I chose the Point Reyes Porter, since I was in the mood for some malt and I was sentimental from a recent hike up there. My beer was delicious with a strong coffee flavor and served slightly colder than room temperature, as is appropriate for a stout.  The bartenders weren't what I would call friendly, but were totally efficient and served my beer from a hand pump within about 30 seconds of approaching the bar, which was very crowded.   While their facade may suggest they don't give a sh@* and just want to party, they give themselves away by serving their beer just right: the right glass, the right pump, the right temp. \u00a0  Overall, if I don't have a headache and I want delicious beer, I will come back to Toronado, and I will be psyched for another glass of deliciousness.",

They have so many hard-to-find brews on tap from awesome breweries such as Stone, Port (oh Pizza Port in San Diego, how I miss thee), Russian River.... the list goes on and on! Ever try a sour beer? I never have, until last night. Looking for the hoppiest IPA you can find? You can find it here [Make bitter beer face here]. What's also awesome is that each pint (or smaller if you get some of the very strong brews) are generally around $4-4.50, which is cheaper than getting crappy mass-produced beers at most bars. Awesome!  Okay so the place is a bit divey, but I think that's part of the appeal of this place. You go there to sample and appreciate beer, and have a good time with your friends. No nice decor, dj, or lighting effects necessary!",

To be fair an balanced I will only share facts first  1) Barn door to get in 2) Dark setting  3) Dirty bathrooms 4) Non proactive waitstaff/bartenders 5) So many beers, the staff has to look up some of them to see if they have it  My Experience  Even the 3 and 4 star reviews say the bartenders are rude, so when I ordered I made sure I was not \"annoying\" to avoid an attitude. I asked if they had Dales Pale ale and he said \"look on the board\". I saw more beers on their wall than their menu so that didn't make too much sense. I ordered a beer I've never heard of and left following.   I feel like reading \u00a0reviews prior helped me have a 2 star experience vs a 1 star experience. I personally enjoy asking questions about beers and learning about them. It's as if they expect their customers to just know about all beer before going there, however I feel like that's not reasonable. We learn about new beers by experiencing them the first time and usually by recommendation.   If you know exactly what you want and know they have it, this a cheap place to drink in SF, otherwise I do not feel like it's a great hangout spot.",

Same feel and vibe as the one in SD but with more history. It wasn't crowded at all on a Sunday night but that may be because the Niners had lost earlier that day in a play off game. They probably went home to lick their wounds.  We walked up and sat at the bar, bartender was friendly and attentive. We chit chatted about the beer and knowing the same people in the industry. Of course I started off with ordering a Pliny the elder. Coming here was a huge treat because of the beer selection Toronado is known for. For 3 days I had a hard time finding a good beer at the different restaurants and bars we had visited. Lagunitas was the best I could find. Which isn't bad but I like to have options. Toro is a true San Fran gem! I'm very spoiled to live in a city that has several craft beer options. I guess you can say I take it for granted living in San Diego.  Toronado is a must for any beer lover!",

I suppose any place that has over 30 taps is begging for a good review from beer lovers and in a way its deserved but it also depends on the selection of beer and this place has a great one.  There are also not too many places that you can order food from next door and bring it in. Now honestly this is pretty cool but it really just means that Rosemunde's is just the de facto kitchen for Toronado. That being said, there's nothing that goes better with a beer than a brat.

I highly recommend it and can't wait until next year's. You can sample 40-50 different kinds of barley wine and after a handful, you're toast! All of the beers there are high in alcohol content and reasonably priced so it's definitely worth the trek out if you don't live nearby.  P.S. If you've been to Ann Arbor and/or read my reviews from there, then this place JUST might beat Ashley's (eek, i never thought i'd say such a thing!).

The staff is on point- they're not ignoring you, they're taking orders in the order that people came up to the bar. They know their beers--- if you give them what you normally like, they will suggest something that you will love.   The beer is cheap and they are ALWAYS changing their menu. There are usually a few hand pumped beers. It's a good way to get to know your microbrews.  If you're hungry, they don't serve food, so grab food from one of their neighbors and let them know you'll be eating it at Toronado. I suggest the sausage place next door--- sausages and beer, you can't go wrong!  The people that come into this place are usually super-cool.

The bar tenders won't cup your balls, but they certainly aren't complete asses and will let you sample beers, ask questions, etc. They actually kind of LIKE what they do for a living (amazing, I know!). And the place has some pride of ownership instead of being a dingy dump like the one in SF.  The only thing that Toronado SF has going for it is the fact that it's one of a handful of places the City to get a wide variety of some really good, craft-brewed beers.

But if I want to talk with them, how am I going to do this?   The place is unbelievably live acoustically. Maybe they buy super reflective space shuttle tiles from NASA and put them on the ceiling. There is a side room which is also too loud, and a \"hidden\" room in front of that which is only opened during Belgian Beer days.  So here is my proposal, and I would chip in for this as I bet would a lot of other IPA lovers. Open the Belgian room, combine it with the side room, and put in some soundproofing so folks can hear themselves drink.  That is it. The 800 pound gorilla in the walk-in has spoken.",

When I asked him to repeat, he aggressively shouted the names at me. If it was not because my mate had already paid for his own beer, I would have left right there.   I came again yesterday, to give it another try. We were ID'd at the door. The guy was extremely rude. Then we go to the bar, and the bartender ignores us for like 5 minutes. This time I did leave before getting a beer, and instead went somewhere else.  Never again.  They have a huge selection of beer. That's the only positive thing. Other than that, it's a loud, smelly, dark place, with some really unpleasant service.   Go somewhere else, the area is full of nice caf\u00e9s and bars.",

Ambiance rocks, jukebox is killer, but it can get a little smelly towards the back on warm days. Great sausages next door to bring into the Toronado and Memphis Minnie's is across the street for some BBQ. One thing I'll agree with other reviewers is the fact that the staff can be quite surly, but can also be quite helpful if you follow normal bar rules, like not waving your money in the air or shouting for the bartender.

I'd go up several times a month and make an event of it, drinking the great, constantly rotating stuff that they had on tap.   After about August 2009, the tap turnover and variety has diminished. Now, I'm not saying the selection is bad at all; any place where you are guaranteed to find Russian River and Moonlight beers (without driving to Santa Rosa) is a big plus in my book. But they rarely have any significant turnover, and their selection has fallen behind other premier beer bars in the Bay Area.   What hurts this place the most is the surly, obnoxious bartenders. But enough has been said on them. I figure if I want to deal with a long wait and get treated like shit, I'll go to the DMV.   Despite this, the bar is always packed.   In short: great value, especially for a bar in the city, but the bartenders tend to be complete jerks. I used to be a big fan of the place, but now I go there maybe twice a year.",
