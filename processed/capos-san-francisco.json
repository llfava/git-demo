    "review_text": "Got a chance to try the Old Chicago with the stuffed crust, which we were told is exactly the same as the deep dish except for the extra edge stuffing. Needless to say -- amazing! The sauce was sweet without being overpowering, the crust was perfectly toasty, the meat was delightfully seasoned, the different cheeses created a wonderful flavor mixture, and the whole thing just looked photo-perfect to boot. I think this place takes the spot for my favorite deep dish pizza in the Bay Area, a few notches above Patxi's. I was going to say that you'll have to pay slightly more for the quality, but to my great surprise it actually looks like Capo's is cheaper! Compared to the $29.50 Patxi's 14\" Favorite which includes pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives, Capo's 13\" Old Chicago features provolone, Romano, Italian sausage, meatball, garlic, and tasty blobs of ricotta for $27 (or $29 stuffed). Factor in the complimentary soup (surely at least a $5 value) and you've come out significantly ahead. A true bargain for world-class eats! (One caveat: I believe the crusts use lard, so vegetarians won't be happy here.)",

We saw Capo's neon sign and peaked into the window to see a nearly packed house. Decided to try it out! What a great choice.   The service is friendly and very attentive. We were sat down at a comfy booth for two and our drink orders were immediately taken... no wait! Happy to have my Hendrick's on the rocks stat! We were handed menu's to browse and there was an assortment of anti-pasto, pastas, and pizzas. I decided on the eggplant lasagna and my partner ordered mostaccioli baked in meat sauce. Within a few minutes of ordering a courtesy bowl of pasta fagioli was brought to the table for each of us. It was yummy and helped warm us up for the delicious dishes that were to come.   The food arrived in about 20-25 minutes. The eggplant lasagna was perfect outside of it being a bit over sauced. But considering the sauce was perfectly balanced, that was just fine. The mostaccioli with meat sauce was incredibly tasty.The sausage they use is delicious! Oh, how could I forget, the portions are huge! Each dish could definitely be shared by two. After only being able to eat half the serving it was time to consider dessert... and by consider dessert I mean order it and devour it... I order my usual whenever at an Italian restaurant Tiramisu. It was served in a jar and the mascarpone was thick and the coffee flavor so nice. Probably one of the best tiramisu I've had in recent memory.  Left full and more than content. Will definitely visit Capo's again on our next trip to San Francisco!",

    "review_text": "Really a disappointing meal from Capo's. I wanted it to be better. High hopes for a great Chicago pizza experience. Almost all items disappointing.   Caesar salad - paste-like dressing. Strips of white anchovy and brown anchovy (why both?), stale croutons and hardly a sign of parmigiano. I've seen better execution a crappy chains. So lazy and undeveloped.  Mostaccioli in Meat Sauce: Barely any meat. Pasta overcooked. Disappointing sauce.  Cracker thin pizza: One would expect that when serving a cracker thin pizza they would take special care to make sure it wasn't dry and the cheese and sauce had enough flavor to hold up. Nope. Cardboard, which is so disappointing. Honestly, Dominos (and I do not eat dominoes btw) does a better job at cracker thin.  Old Chicago Deep Dish: Ok, this was the money shot. They had to do this right, right? And while it was the better of the dishes, wow it just wasn't good. No effort put into the sauce - just a gloppy, overly sweet tomato paste heavy sauce. No depth of flavor. Meat was a thin layer, the crust was lacking the buttery flakiness of a great Chicago pie. Dots of ricotta were the most edible part.  For the price he is charging, you'd expect so much better. All of that was $100 and it really was a waste.  I hope this helps people find their way to a better Chicago pie. So far in SF Patxis is the best I've had. I know people swear by Zacharies, but I don't get it.",

I also typically will only eat very thin crust pizza, however, I had Capo's deep dish pizza a few weeks back - forget which one but it had ricotta and sausage. I would say it was like eating a great lasagna without the noodles. So good! The pockets of ricotta added a little extra lightness. One slice is all you really need. They have a great lunch special too - I think for $10 you get soup, salad, and a slice of their deep dish pizza of the day.  Also, it's cash only, which would normally be kind of a pain if you forgot to bring cash and don't feel like jumping up and running across the street to the ATM. However, \u00a0they have an ATM inside of the restaurant, so they at least try to make it convenient",

Thick crust pizza usually isn't my thing, but I don't know what it is about the San Francisco Bay Area but you people sure kick butt over Chicago with your version of \"Chicago style\" pizza.  Capo's is another recent addition that again is topping my list of Bay Area favorites. The dark \"speakeasy\" environment is right up my thirst alley. A creative cocktail list that had me at 'Silencer\". Without getting into details, order it.  The appetizers are gut busting delicious. The meatballs are a meal by themselves, but the honey pork sausage was the winner. We loved them so much we made sure that the pizza we ordered were stuffed full of those suckers.  Yep, the salads looked great as well. But if you're concerned about calories then this place isn't for you. Give into your temptation and feast away at one of San Francisco's newest food Mecca.",

    "review_text": "This review is primarily for the atmosphere of the restaurant. We stopped in on a whim and thankfully it was early enough to grab a table immediately. The feel of the restaurant at first glance is old school Chicago, and they do a good job recreating the feel with the bar and big red booths. However, once we were seated and I had time to look around the place, it kind of reminded me of a Bucca di Beppo in terms of the overplayed Italian stereotypes/overdone mob style. Now I'm not one to pull the \"politically correct\" card but I did find it odd that instead of focusing on the Chicago feel, they turned it into a pro-mobster den, with images of Al Capone framed on the wall. Why do pizza and mobsters have to go hand in hand?   We ordered the antipasti plate, which came with meats and cheeses. Unfortunately the majority of the cheeses and meats tasted like they were Safeway brand. We also ordered the deep dish Old Chicago pizza and that definitely did not disappoint (and was well worth the wait!!). Plus, the pizza alone is so much food that we were able to take most of it home (yay leftovers).   BUT, when we got our pizza back in the takeout box, I couldn't help but do a double take at the pizza box cover. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive and need to loosen up a bit, but here's what I saw: a mobster's face with the city of San Francisco on his head, and various images of whiskey, beer, and pizza. Ok, I get the Beach Blanket Babylon reference (ha ha the city's on his head), but really? The whole thing looked really cheesy and something you would see at Disneyland.   I would eat their pizza again, but I could definitely forego the in-house dining experience.",

Very mafioso! There is a gorgeous art deco bar with an old school cash register and even a vintage phone booth in the back (you can make free calls anywhere in the US of A!!).  Food is served in large, family style portions - plenty to share with the whole table. They begin the meal with complimentary house-made soup that is warm and delicious. I ordered the Chicken Limoncello and it was perfect, tender and savory in a semi-sweet limoncello sauce. My husband got the Chicken Vesuvio and a cracker thin pizza with house made sausage. Our friends ordered a Chicago style deep dish pizza ... this was a ton of food and we didn't even come close to finishing it - but it made for the perfect leftover lunch the next day!   I haven't even mentioned the drinks yet. They have 3 special drinks as advertised on the mirrors behind the bar. My hubby had the Made-Man Manhattan and a Capone. I'm not a whiskey/bourbon drinker, so I had the bartender make a awesome lemondrop for me. It was so good I had another! They have quite the impressive drink selection and will make whatever your heart desires. \u00a0  Definitely going back and taking friends and family. Good place for celebrations (reservations are required though, so make sure to call in advance) or just to stop in and have one their delicious cocktails with friends or significant other.

But I was truly impressed by Capo's so I felt compelled. We didn't have the pizza (I'm a Zachary's fan, so I'll have to come back and see if it compares), but we shared the loaded garlic bread, wood-fired mostaccioli genovenese, chicken marsala, and wood-fired eggplant lasagna. All the dishes were superb and hugely portioned (we had 3 to-go boxes and were sharing these dishes amongst 4)--I've never had chicken marasala that rich in flavor!

For decades, the king of pizza (at least, deep dish Chicago-style pizza) has been Zachary's in the East Bay. No one could come close to the texture and taste of their crust, the deep flavors of their tomato sauce, or the smoothness of their cheese. Until now.  Capos serves several styles of pizzas, but the ultimate is the deep dish. The crust is dusted with corn meal and incredibly crunchy like fried dough. Their sauce is savory and spicy with chunks of tomato (as opposed to Zachary's even and blended texture).  But the difference is the cheese. Throw in some chunks of ricotta (I got the \"Big Jim\" Colosimo's Triple Double), and it takes the pie into a completely different category.  PROS - Best deep dish pizza I've ever had. Period. - Full bar with signature cocktails. - Great decor and furniture.  CONS - Pretty small, so get there early or go on off hours. - Cash only (as of 2013-01-18).

This is NOT it, and for Capo's to call their pizza Chicago style not only gives Chicago style pizza a bad name, it deceives customers into believing they're purchasing something that they're not.  It's comical to me that a place that wouldn't last for 5 minutes in Chicago gets a 4 star rating, but I realize that the sad fact is Californians (no offense Californians!) simply don't know what good pizza is. I've tried my fair share of pizza places in the Bay Area and found them all to be substandard, especially the ones that claim to be Chicago style. Old Chicago pizza in Petaluma is a joke and uses frozen sausage bits on their pizza, a practice that any true Chicago style place would scoff at. Capo's is a little better, but not much.   Their menu has a list of obscure pizzas named after Chicago mobsters and locations, a feeble attempt to look authentic. One is called the Sam Giancana, a psychopath who ordered the deaths of hundreds of individuals and was implicated in the assassination of JFK. \u00a0Great idea glorifying a guy that Chicago has been trying to forget about since he got his head blown off in the 70's, way to go! This particular pizza had a array of strange toppings including honey sausage which I've never even heard of on a pizza. You're not going to find any of these strange concoctions in a Chicago pizza place. The closest you would find is the classic Chicago supreme pizza...sausage, green peppers, mushrooms, onions. Every well known pizza place in Chicago offers this on their menu, and, of course, it's nowhere to be found on Capo's.   I recently moved to North Beach and was really looking forward to finding some great pizza. After all, it's Little Italy, I figured someone must know how to do it right. But sadly, everywhere I've tried has been a huge disappointment. My girlfriend and I dined in at Capo's and actually had a great server, but, as I see has been mentioned by many others, the hostess was terrible. Instead of greeting us at the door she just stared at us and waited for us to speak. Whatever, people have bad days and I don't expect much out of a grown woman who is a hostess at a pizza place.   My biggest problem with Capo's is that they're claiming to be something they're not. The renowned pizza chef Tony (what a joke, his other place Tony's in North Beach sucks too) has simply created a menu of pizzas that have nothing to do with  Chicago and called them Chicago style as a selling point. What kind of bs is that?  I realize that it's not feasible for most Bay Area residents to travel to Chicago and taste a genuine Chicago style pizza, but for those who get the opportunity I would highly recommend trying some Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, or Rosati's. After one bite you would realize there's simply no comparison and that Capo's doesn't even come close. For those who can't travel to Chicago I would highly recommend ordering a frozen pizza from Lou Malnati's. They send it in a styrofoam cooler with dry ice...it's fantastic!",

I heard of this place from tablehopper and we tried it one Friday night regardless of the fact that it's CASH ONLY. Pretty strange for a full restaurant. Anyway, the Baked Artichokes appetizer was incredible! Their Chicago style pizza is very good, but we ended up with left-overs for days. One slice of their deep-dish is plenty of food on it's own. I think this place would be great for a group, especially because they take reservations for parties of 6 or more, and their large booths sort of encourage big groups.",

Hi do you have a table No, attitude, etc, you can wait for 90 minutes or eat outside in the cold wind. fine, we sat on the bar, I had my baby strapped on me. So I didn't care I was semi standing.  So 1 star down for attitude.  Beer, $6 Peroni and $12 wine from tap. So a little pricey 1 star down.  We got a complimentary soup without asking. Which was nice so 1/2 star up. It was a nice soup but nothing to write about.  The guy at the bar was extremely nice and had good advice. So 1/2 star up.  Now for the pizza. We got the thin kind, not the chicago, not the cast iron as those take too long. The pizza was great. It came with eggs on it, the eggs were runny which went well with the dry pizza.  The cheeses were a decent mix etc.  So 4 stars, all is good. Give it a try but make sure to get a reservation.",

    "review_text": "Tony (of Tony's Pizza Napoletana and Slice House fame) has another winner. \u00a0A totally different spin and style, but extremely high-quality, delicious food. \u00a0We couldn't sit for dinner so we called for a take-out. \u00a0Our bounty for 3 people was a mixed green &amp; dried cherry salad, a quattro forni w/ prosciutto &amp; arugula, and a deep-dish Sam Giancana style pizza. \u00a0Good thing we drove an SUV to pick this stuff up as the payload we received from the restaurant was massive.  The salad was great- stretched fine for 3 people. \u00a0If we were sharing for 4 people+ it would have been thin. \u00a0I'd go 1 order for 2 people moving forward. \u00a0The quattro forni was delicious- this was essentially a very artfully constructed pizza-like appetizer. \u00a0I'm not giving it justice by saying that- it was thick and crunchy and really delicious. \u00a0However, moving forward- that plus a deep-dish pizza is a bit redundant &amp; some-what overkill. \u00a0But I will definitely order it again. Soon!  On to the pizza- this massive deep-dish was akin to slaughtering an animal- we had food for days! \u00a0It was 6 slices, but each of us could consume just one- they are THICK and layered with sausage and cheese and sauce and the crust was outstanding. \u00a0I ate the other half over the next two days...and it revived very well in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes. The pizza was really delicious and a tremendous contrast to the wood-fired masterpieces I have grown to know and love at Tony's Napoletana. \u00a0So different, but at the same time, just as perfect in its construction and compliment of flavors.  The menu is really intense and extensive at Capo's, and with 4 styles of each pizza to choose from, as well as numerous other pastas, chicken dishes, etc- it will be a while until I have a grip on what my favorite items are, etc. \u00a0But thats a discovery process I am seriously looking forward. \u00a0I'll be back again VERY soon. \u00a0Thanks for hitting another home-run, Tony!  PS- Cash only, don't forget.",

    "review_text": "It is with humble gratitude and smug pleasure that I hereby lay down the first ever review of the soon to be famous Capo's.  As long time fans of Tony Gemignani's other outlet of the same name (Tony's Pizza) we were invited by none other than the Capo himself to the soft opening of the new Capo's.  Tony designed the new place himself to be as close to something you'd find in Chicago during Prohibition as you'll see anywhere without visiting a museum. The bar is gorgeous and built from scratch. The entire place is walled in red brick. The ceiling is copper tiling like you'd see in Chicago or New York. The floor is cork tiles, which absorbs so much of the noise that would otherwise make this place a \"bomb\" rating in noise decibels. When I asked Tony about that he specifically got the cork tiling on the floor for that reason. He really has thought of everything in this new establishment and it's no stretch to say it is his masterpiece.  Whether you sit in the Capone booth which faces the front (Al never sat anywhere he couldn't see everyone) or one of the other spacious red leather booths the main draw of course is the food. Several items appear as they do at his namesake restaurant; you'll find calamari, meatballs, clams, and more for appetizers. For the main event the Chicago style pizza is dazzling. Not to be mistaken for only \"stuffed,\" you will find several styles on a thinner crust. The difference from other styles is the cornmeal in the crust and perhaps a bit of lard that is used to make the crust crispy. Combined with Tony's second to none command of sauce and toppings this might very well be the best pie in the country. Of course the debate about that will rage on for a long time to come but from someone who has been to a lot of places that are considered to be the best Pizza places in the country I think this might be the best. The deep dish isn't trying to be \"over the top\" like Paxti's or Zacharys or Little Star (although those are all very good in their own unique way). Here the pie is more simple in nature, true to its elements and heritage and totally authentic.   Try it and I think you'll agree. Capo's will take reservations unlike Tony's, but good luck on getting them. Rispettare il mestiere!",

    "review_text": "Ahhh, Tony G. - You get a long review because you deserve it! \u00a0  The nearly or indeed self proclaimed king of pizza in the U.S. \u00a0(He has won more awards than any pizza guy). \u00a0Has a pizza school. \u00a0Teaches pizza making. Lectures pizza making. \u00a0Touts pizza wisdom all over the land. \u00a0 Has a great pizza place called (what else) Tony's in S.F. \u00a0He Really is a pizza god to many. \u00a0Even me I must say. \u00a0So it is with such admiration to the craft and passion of pizzadom that I feel needs a true review. \u00a0Not biased, but I am sure overly critical. \u00a0But that is what being at the top gets you from a somewhat self obsessed pizza nut.  So here goes. \u00a0(Don't strike me down with your golden pizza paddle Tony!) Capos is his second restaurant I believe. \u00a0His First, Tony's is great. \u00a0A shrine to the art of pizza. And he is making some killer pies there.  Capo's on the other hand is an attempt to go after the \"Chicago\" pizza lovers. \u00a0In San Francisco you already have long time fans of chicago deep dish. \u00a0Zachary's in the east bay is quite the deal. \u00a0Little Star is my favorite in SF for deep dish. \u00a0Paxti's is a growing chain that is also pretty damn good. \u00a0 So Tony comes along and has to trump these guys. \u00a0Lets go OLD SCHOOL Chicago he says. \u00a0Small place. \u00a0Real old school tuffted red leather booths and lots of old Chicago props adorn the place. \u00a0GM is in a natty 3 piece suit. \u00a0And CASH ONLY. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0This is not cool in todays world. \u00a0This knocks a star off in my book. \u00a0Are you trying so hard to be OLD school that you think cash only is cool? \u00a0It's not. \u00a0it's a hassle. \u00a0Or are you to cheap to pay the credit card companies the 3% fee that 99 percent of all places pay, even little mom and pop places. \u00a0Either way, not cool. \u00a0If you were a true original that was around before credit cards were invented, then I can maybe buy it cause you are \"grandfathered in\". \u00a0But not here. \u00a0Sorry big T. ... You loose a star for this move.  OK, atmosphere will make any ex chi town oldy feel at home. \u00a0But this is maybe more of a Disneyland representation of Chicago than the real deal. \u00a0And some will be turned off by it. \u00a0But this is of course San Francisco, so a lot of his customers are tourists and they will dig it.  Now on to the pizza. \u00a0Well Tony went for FOUR types of Chicago pies in this place. \u00a0But he is the man to do it. \u00a0Lets start with the best. \u00a0The cracker crust pie. \u00a0This is more of a 'midwest\" pie than Chicago, but close enough. \u00a0It was \"perfect\". \u00a0Crisp, light, crunch. \u00a0Almost laminated in a good way. \u00a0Perfect sauce, cheese and toppings with a touch of char around the edges. \u00a0 This is a mastery of this type of pie. \u00a05+ stars for this baby.  Passed on the stuffed crust and the pan pizza. \u00a0so cant comment on them. \u00a0Went for the special 4 oven pizza appetizer. \u00a0A nice buttery crunch of a outer crust but a lot of white bread light doughy top on part. I ate the crunchy outer part. \u00a0 It was a nice different type of pie and worth the try for it's being different, but don't expect much and you may like it.  Then the Chicago Deep Dish. \u00a0This had a fairly puffy and thick edge and thin bottom. \u00a0I'm ok with that, but the crust did not have a buttery or flakey texture to it. \u00a0It actually seemed pretty pedestrian. \u00a0Now there are many types of pizza in Chicago. \u00a0Lou Malnati's seems to be the favorite, with a buttery flakey crunchy dough. \u00a0That is what I would consider to be the most classic. \u00a0A tender flakey pie like crust. \u00a0This was NOT that. \u00a0Was it bad? \u00a0No. \u00a0But not what I was thinking it should be. \u00a0A master pizza man should be able to make a better crust than this. \u00a0Sauce was robust but thin. \u00a0not chunky. \u00a0Fair amount of toppings and blend of mozz and provolone. \u00a0But for me this pie needed more cheese and toppings. \u00a033 bucks for a 3 or 4 topping pie better load up. \u00a0This did not. \u00a0  Also got a couple of italian dishes. \u00a0They were ok, but nothing great. \u00a0old school but I have had WAY better in SF. \u00a0So go for the pizza .  Service was good even though they made my pizza wrong and brought out a wrong pasta dish. \u00a0But I forgive that. \u00a0The manager was on it and apologetic and things like that can happen so I for one dont really hold that against them.  So my 3 stars is because the cash only thing is a joke. \u00a0The deep dish was good but not what i was hoping for. \u00a0 Your pizza dough-e-ness holds you to a higher standard. But the thin crust was spot on and your jewel. \u00a0  Tony, you can do better and have. \u00a0But that wont stop you. \u00a0 Your passion is what all pizza places can and should aspire to. \u00a0Many do and more are opening up every day across our great pizza loving country. \u00a0And you will have many more competing with you and your skills. \u00a0It's all good my friends. \u00a0More great pizza for us all to eat!  So the king of pizza lives on to flip pies another day. \u00a0This place will make him tons of \"CASH ONLY\".... \u00a0Keep an eye out for the Brinks truck with Tony's minion's guarding the \"dough\" with sharpened pizza cutters and golden paddles. \u00a0Cheesy, I know..n",

We then had the fire roasted bell pepper and seafood (crab, shrimp, and other stuff) pasta. \u00a0The bell pepper was great, and the the best flavors of the seafood were noticeable, not overwhelmed, by the pasta. \u00a0We also had the fried chicken, which was good for the taste buds (very), for the alcohol (details later), and for the heart (not). \u00a0Finally, given that this is a sister restaurant to Tony's, we had to try their actual pizza - so we finished off our meal with a Big Jim. \u00a0Topped with all my favorite toppings cooked to perfection, our night of gluttony reached a satisfied end.  On the drinks side, the Made Man is one of the best bourbon-themed drinks out there, next to Aviary in Chicago. \u00a0Delicious, strong stuff, which our food paired very well with.  Service was impeccable as well - I don't remember her name, but our waitress was incredibly friendly the entire night and shared many awesome stories with us. \u00a0This is a great spot for a group or casual dinner, and I'll surely be coming back here again.",

I judge my Chicago pizza by Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due in the city. Do not be fooled by the name of the franchised Uno Chicago Grill which is NOWHERE in comparison.  Capo's is good, at least equal to Giordano's in the Chicago area, lots of melty mozzarella, rich tomato sauce and a solid layer of spicy sausage. The crust approaches the ideal stand-up crunchy yet somehow flaky texture, not oily but with olive oil goodness (like a croissant is not oozing butter but tastes buttery).  I ate at the bar because it was pretty crowded and enjoyed the barkeeper's excellent service and humor. I also give Capo's a little credit for attracting interesting people to the bar for me to talk to.",

Can't recommend it enough.  + Our waitress was very helpful in narrowing in options + Complementary soup was excellent + Garlic bread was tasty + Deep-dish pizza was HUGE. Sent four patrons home fat and happy with leftovers to spare. - I was so full I didn't make it to the desert menu, not a bad thing.  Not only was everything good, everything was reasonably priced for the area. I have recently spent double our bill on Dine About Town dinners for two. The visit to Capo's was much more satisfying.   I did not get a chance to sample their drink menu so can't speak to that end of things.  I plan to return to try more of their offerings.  Note! Capo's is no longer cash only. My credit card suited just fine.",

I am a long term resident of the North Beach neighborhood and love everything North Beach. I eat at Tony's other place bi-weekly and I was pretty excited to try Tony's new place, as I had heard great things at Trieste over coffee in the morning. Unfortunately our waitress mistook our order... and accidents do happen, but we ended up with the polar opposite of our original order. What we did receive was an inedible gloppy mess of cold ricotta, spinach, and lots of tomato sauce on a lukewarm crust. Regretfully I had to say something which is actually pretty difficult for me.We were comped the food we did not eat which was appreciated. Honestly I went to Capos tonight and expected more. Yes we were comped for what we did not eat, but we spent time and money that we could have enjoyed in many other deserving NB venues. I think we deserved a little more...? perhaps a free glass of wine? a dessert ? \u00a0I wanted to have a great experience, I wanted to come back again and again and most likely I won't be back. I would be hard pressed to recommend Capos to anyone else with so many great alternatives in the neighborhood.",

    "review_text": "On Saturday, 10/25/14, my girlfriend and I along with one of my good friends and his wife ate at Capo's for dinner. We've all been to Tony's Pizza Napoletana and I must say we are all true fans! My girlfriend and I have been to Tony's a numerous amount of times and I've actually had the chance to meet and talk to Tony Gemignani. He is a true class act and a PIZZA GENIUS! I saw Capo's on the show Check, Please! I've been so eager to try Capo's so we finally made it happen.   Atmosphere/Decor:   The restaurant is super cool looking! There's a huge sign outside that is lit up and says Chicago Pizza Capo's Italian Dinners &amp; Cocktails. The interior of the restaurant is really nice. I like the brick walls and design of the restaurant. There are chandeliers throughout the restaurant. The red burgundy booths are nice and unique looking. \u00a0Everything in the restaurant looks very high end. The door that opens and leads into the kitchen is made out of the same material as the booths. The old school telephone booth near the bathrooms is so cool! Capo's has a really nice looking bar. We saw a lot of people sit at the bar so they could watch the World Series SF Giants vs. KC Royals game. There are cool looking pictures of real people hung up on the walls throughout the restaurant. I also saw some pizza boxes that had the famous Al Capone on them. Man this restaurant is off the hook!  Food:   Capo's starts you off with complimentary minestrone soup. I thought this was a great idea since it takes roughly 45-50 minutes to cook most of their pizzas. The minestrone soup tasted good. It was very light tasting. We all decided to go with the Old Fashioned Chicago Deep Dish Big Jim Colosimos Triple Double (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Provolone, Garlic, Pepperoni, Chicago Italian Sausage, Ricotta, Meatball, Mushrooms, Onions, Roasted Peppers, Bacon, Oregano &amp; Romano) and The Dillinger (World's Best Pan Pizza, International Pizza Challenge, Las Vegas, 2014) (Sharp Cheddar, Mozzarella, Provolone, Smoked Hangar 1 Vodka Cream Sauce, Marinated Chicken, Bacon, Brocollini, Artichoke Hearts, Red Bell Peppers, Garlic, Crushed, Red Pepper, Fresh Lemon.) The Big Jim Colosimos Triple Double was amazingly good and so tasty! All of the toppings were fresh. This is definitely a meat lover pizza! It's loaded with every single topping you can think of. This was definitely the best Chicago deep dish style pizza I've ever eaten in my life. All of the toppings inside of the pizza worked very well together. The small dollops of ricotta on top of the pizza were the icing on the cake! The ricotta was so fresh, rich, smooth and flavorful.The tomato sauce on the pizza had a nice flavor. It wasn't overpowering. The pizza was perfect!   On to The Dillinger. This was one of the best Pizzas I've ever eaten in my life and it's definitely in my top 3 pizzas of all time. Oh yeah, by the way, my other two favorite Pizzas are at Tony's other restaurant (Tony's Napoletana.) The Dillinger was sensational! The flavors were rich and intense. The first bite was truly orgasmic! The distinctive flavors will hit all different parts of your palate. All of the ingredients and toppings work so well together. The chicken was super tender and flavorful. The smoked hangar 1 vodka cream sauce tasted excellent! The pan crust will taste like nothing you've ever had. It has a nice buttery taste along with a good crunch and soft texture. This pizza is beyond divine and perfect!   Service:  When we walked into Capo's we were greeted by the hostess. She was very friendly and sociable. She checked me in for my reservation and made sure I received my points on opentable. You don't know how many times I've had to remind a hostess to check me in off of opentable so I could receive my points. I didn't have to say anything to this hostess. I literally saw her seat me on their computer screen. She went and made sure that our table was ready for us. We were seated very quickly and didn't even have to wait a single minute.  Our waiter Levi was very nice and personable. He had a great attitude and checked on us throughout our dinner. He made sure the Pizzas were to our liking. Not once did we ever have to ask for more water. Our waters were always topped off. Levi was an excellent waiter. The entire staff at Capo's was excellent. \u00a0 \u00a0  Overall:   Capo's is the next big thing in North Beach! There should be a line outside before the doors even open just like Tony's Napoletana. The pizzas at Capo's are truly amazing and delicious! The food and service was impeccable. If you're a fan of Tony's Napoletana you'll definitely be a fan of Capo's. Not only does Tony make the best New York style, Detroit, St. Louis and other various pizzas, he makes the best Chicago style pizza hands down! Tony is the best Italian Pizza Chef known to man! Hurry up and go give Capo's a try!!!",

Tucked away on Vallejo, I feel that an abandoned street has been reclaimed. \u00a0Capos is a gem. \u00a0From the moment you walk in you feel like you found a secret club hidden away. \u00a0The narrow dinning area is laid out nicely. \u00a0 the bar on one side dining on the other and an open space to the kitchen in the back, where you can see the marvelous oven that this yummy pizza is born from. \u00a0The classic red buttoned leather booths against a exposed brick background reminded me of a lost era. \u00a0The d\u00e9cor is an homage to an old Chicago. There is even a \"capone\" table which you must see. I don't want to describe it. You should see it yourself. \u00a0This is not the over done pastiche of Planet Hollywood. This is an elegant presentation giving San Francisco a finer dinning Chicago pizza experience and an homage to history. \u00a0Ask the wait staff about the lovely bar, and the incredible mural in the back!  Oh and the food? \u00a0Just do yourself a favor and get the Wood Fired Mostaccioli Genovese and a Fire Rosted Stuffed Bell Pepper. \u00a0Well that's what I got, and man I was happy. \u00a0I can't wait to try the Chicken Limoncello!",

    "review_text": "Review #800 goes out to Capo's!  This seriously was a special occasion since I'm known to celebrate my birthday for a whole month. This is the first time I celebrated almost 2 months later! Thank you Rodney H for setting this up! And Peter L and Bobby L for celebrating with me yesterday!  I got there early so I sat at the bar and got the Kentucky mule: housemade ginger beer, fresh lime, makers mark bourbon, angostura bitters ($12). I wanted something light and refreshing, so the mule was perfect! Plus I was watching game 7 of the World series, so I needed a drink!  Once everyone got there, we moved to a booth in the dining room. Of course, I requested a table within view of the TVs so we could still watch the game.  WINE: *Barbera del monferrato, marchesi di barolo, maraia, 2012 ($36) -Peter picked this wine. My only requirement was a red, so this worked well. I like full bodied reds, but this one had a little spiciness to it. It worked well with all our pizzas.  APPETIZERS, SALADS &amp; SIDES:  *Wood fired baked artichokes: in spinach and provolone cream ($13.95) -This is gigantic! I ordered it since a gf said I had to try it. It was creamy, savory and sooo good! I almost ate a whole slice of bread because it was so good! And I normally stay away from bread so I can eat more of the mains!  *Caesar with white anchovies ($9) -I wanted this to have lots of anchovy flavor, but it didn't. There were three slices of anchovies on the salad, but the dressing didn't really have any of that flavor.  *Caprese salad: house-made mozzarella, peppadew relish, roasted red peppers, kalamata olives ($9) -I actually didn't care for this. I wanted more basil and maybe a balsamic to cut into the richness of the cheese.  3 meatballs ($6) -Okay, I probably shouldn't have ordered this, but I really love meatballs! These were tender and meaty. And had lots of tomato sauce which was great since I love extra sauce.  PIZZA: I don't know what made me think I could eat 3 pizzas, but my eyes are always bigger than my stomach. By the time we got the pizzas, I was already full, but I had to try some of each.  *Old Chicago: tomato sauce, mozzarella, provolone, Chicago Italian sausage, meatball, garlic, ricotta, oregano &amp; romano ($26 cracker thin) -We originally didn't order this pizza, but I'm more of a fan of cracker thin, so I thought: Let's try it! The crust was great! Crunchy, but still chewy at the same time. Since I love tomato sauce, I wish it had more sauce.  *The dillinger (World's best pan pizza, International pizza challenge, Las Vegas, 2014): sharp cheddar, mozzarella, provolone, smoked hanger 1 vodka cream sauce, marinated chicken, bacon, brocollini, artichoke hearts, red bell peppers, garlic, crushed red pepper, fresh lemon ($37 cast iron pan) -This was the last pizza we got. Super bready, but the combination of the toppings worked really well together. And the inner lush in me loved the vodka cream sauce!   *Snap E Tom: mozzarella, provolone, garlic, pork chorizo, pepperoni, roasted red peppers, serrano peppers, crushed red pepper, tomato &amp; cholula hot sauce, ricotta, romano &amp; oregano (spicy) $38 deep dish -Giant slices of deep dish! I couldn't eat much last night but this was so good today for lunch! The crust was still chewy with the edges caramelized. Lots of sauce, cheese and toppings. Yum!  DESSERT: *Affogato: tahitian vanilla gelato topped with a single espresso ($7) -They gave us this on the house which was super sweet. I don't think it was cuz we were celebrating my bday because I don't think anyone told him. It was probably because we ordered so much food! Lol!  Great place to watch the game as the whole restaurant was super excited when the Giants won. We each got a complimentary glass of bubbly to celebrate!  Would love to go back and try their Quattro forni since they only make 20 a day! And with mushrooms, arugula &amp; truffle oil, it sounds like heaven!",

So Capo's deep dish is good (perfect sauce, perfect cheese, perfect toppings), but none of his Chicago pizza's have cheese in the crust, so I'll enjoy the pizzas, but still wait for my next opportunity to go to Due in Chicago to get my heart attack on a plate.  My husband liked the deep dish and gives this place 5 stars, but both of us preferred Tony's (same owner) thinner crust pizza's, so we'll likely go back to Tony's for pizza.",

We also enjoyed their cracker crust pizza. The stallion has chopped italian beef, red peppers and a horseradish cream. Full of flavor \u00a0yet light and crispy together the pizzas represent the yin and yang of pizza.   A great surprise \u00a0was the baked artichoke in a provolone cream sauce. Pickled artichokes bathed in a creamy cheese sauce. The acid in the artichoke's pickling liquid cut through the rich sauce and left me wanting more, much more!  Service at capo's is always excellent, they treat you like mom's favorite child. Tables are well spaced and booths plush and comfy.   If you haven't visited, you are missing out on the best pizza in san francisco. Like sister restaurant tony's pizza napolitana, the quality is excellent and really a great value.  Mange bene!",

The dining room is small and they don't take reservations for parties of at least 6 people. \u00a0If there is a line, you can place your order while you are waiting. \u00a0Deep dish pies take at least 30 minutes to bake so be prepared for the wait.",

My stars...(5=epic \"best of\") (4=really tasty and want to go again and again) (3=good and will go back once in a while) (2=fair, might return for a visit if there was some glimmer of hope) (1=avoid at all costs)  Go or No? \u00a0Go!  Tease: \u00a0 It's a Chicago style pizza and Italian food place in the heart of SF's North Beach.   Why I went: \u00a0Friends of ours recommend Capo's when we had a trip planned to SF with some other friends. \u00a0Given we were in SF, we felt going to a Chicago style place seemed silly. \u00a0But we were told it was worth it.  When: \u00a0May 2013  Food: \u00a0The Johnny Torrio Thick Crust Chicago Style Pizza is it! \u00a0Made spicy, it included sauce, cheese, sausage, Italian beef, giardiniera, and sweet peppers. \u00a0Man was it good! \u00a0So darn good, my friend and I ate so much we virtually got in food comas! \u00a0We also tried a sausage and onion thin crust. \u00a0The thick was a rockstar, and the thin was only an opener. \u00a0 The thick is honestly one of the best I've ever had. \u00a0The thin, very forgettable. \u00a0Don't bother! \u00a0All meals come with a nice brothy soup. \u00a0The cocktails were also superb! \u00a0They have all sorts of old and new school mixed drinks. \u00a0They also have their own blend of whiskey. \u00a0They have so many whiskies it's not even funny! \u00a0  Service: \u00a0Great! \u00a0I forget our waitress' name, but she was very good.  Hints/Final thoughts: \u00a0Best darn Chicago style thick crust pizza outside of Chicago...and even better than most in Chicago! \u00a0BRING CASH!!! \u00a0This is a cash only place. \u00a0It's super annoying. \u00a0I think it's so it keeps costs down and to give it an old timey gangster/prohibition vibe. \u00a0Thankfully, there is ATM in the place in case! \u00a0I recommend the management allows credit cards. \u00a0Our group would have spent more if they allowed it! \u00a0 My family is originally from Chicago. \u00a0I've had all kinds of Chicago pies from Uno to Lou Malnati's. \u00a0Capo's simply stacks up with the best of 'em! \u00a0 Get the thick, skip the thin!   Also, be warned, the place is small! \u00a0You may have to wait for a table!",

There was too much sauce which was over powering and worst of all, it was too salty, where I could even taste the salt bits. Well, according to our server, Rebecca H. \"maybe I'm just not a salty person because she eats it all the time.\"   That's a big no no, when you ask diners how their food is and you shoot back with a smart remark.

Known for their Chicago style deep dish pizza, they also have really good food besides deep dish.  I tried what they called the quatro forni. A bread that's baked 4 times in four ovens. It had Arugula, prosciutto, Parmesan and tomato sauce. Oh my word! was this heavenly! I originally thought it was a flatbread of some kind, but when it came out it was anything but flat! It was like a cake! Like a 4 inch thick cake! It was so good!  It looks like it would be something very heavy to eat because of how thick the bread is. But it was actually very surprisingly light. The bread was very warm. It was very soft and moist. Almost had the texture of say, a bread pudding but just not wet. The crust was buttery and crisp and had an excellent crunch to it that balanced perfectly with the tenderness of the bread. The bread was sweat and with the saltiness of the prosciutto and Parmesan made for a magnificent pairing of flavors. The garlic bread with melted mozzarella was addicting. I couldn't stop eating it! A complimentary soup came with dinner which again was very good. The pizza was also good. Deep dish heaven! I love deep dish, well I love pizza in general haha but Capos is definitely good!  Can't wait to go back and try other dishes",

There is no explanation for how good it is other than illicit substances were added. Which make you want a slice. And then another. And then two more.  Oozing with cheese. Buttery crust. Plenty of sauce.   So bad yet so good. Took all the willpower in the world to stop and save the rest. Leftovers didn't last long.  Was not the only one impressed. Grandma was too. And sis. Two very important opinions that should not be taken lightly.  Soup to start was delicious. And complimentary. Chicken broth, noodles and veggies. Nothing more needed.  Chicken marsala wasn't as memorable but that could have been because we were all eyeing more of the deep dish.  Made Man whiskey drink got me in the mood for more whiskey. Namely a Whiskey Crisp dessert with apples, pears, cherries and topped with vanilla bean gelato.  Got intoxicated. On flavor.  Red booths and vintage decor (including a working phone booth) were awesome. Same with the reasonable prices and friendly service.  Capone might have gone straight for another slice of pizza.",

    "review_text": "Holy food coma Batman!  Our group of three rolled into Tony Gemignani's second North Beach pizzeria, Capo's on a Sunday afternoon around 5:30pm with no reservations and were seated right away. By the time 6 rolled around the restaurant was already fully packed. The d\u00e9cor is awesome old school brick, custom tall red banquettes, and tons of black and white photos of gangsters everywhere. It's good to come here early and allow plenty of time for your food to arrive because deep dish can take 45-50 minutes.   Funny thing is, we originally came here looking forward to comparing the spaghetti with meatballs to Emmy's Spaghetti Shack and ended up ordering the following:  Baked artichokes in cream Old Chicago cracker crust: 2 different types of sausage Sam Giacana deep dish: sausage and meatball  The pizzas are cool because you can specify how you want them prepared, either deep dish, stuffed, cast iron pan, or Chicago cracker thin crust. If you get confused while you are ordering, just ask your server for recommendations.   We got through about half the artichokes when the Old Chicago came out. The cracker crust was delicious, and it's definitely more substantial than the Italian style thin crust that I'm used to. Since I don't see myself eating deep dish all the time (I won't be in weight gain mode forever), I will definitely be debating between Tony's down the street and Capo's for future dinner options when I'm in the area. This pizza was enough to feed the three of us by itself and we did a good job by almost finishing it when the deep dish was ready for us.   Once the deep dish Sam Giacana arrived we were completely intimidated, this thing was massive. Calling the cracker crust filling and then eating this pie was like comparing a Mini with a H1. Each bite was both crispy and filled with thick tomato sauce, meat and cheese, it was like crispy lasagna. We only managed to eat 2 slices total before boxing it. Our waitress had a great sense of humor the entire meal, and joked that we would have enough food left to feed us for days. I'm hoping it tastes even better as leftovers in the convection toaster since the flavors will have more time to blend together.   One tip: Cash only!",

Their main attraction is Chicago-style deep dish pizzas - they also offer three other kinds of crusts: the stuffed, the cast iron (which to my understanding is more bready), and the 'cracker thin' - which is more like NY-style pizza. They also serve appetizers, salads, sides, meat entrees, and pastas and have a full cocktail menu, along with beer and wine.  Since the deep dish pizzas take approximately 35 minutes to cook, we ordered a side of three meatballs. They were full of flavor and had a lot of sauce to pair with their complimentary bread and bowl of minestrone soup, which were also delicious.   As we waited, I took in the decor - it's a new restaurant with lots of old fashion fixtures and detailing, tin ceiling, lots of brick and wood, long bar, medium-size dining area with a combo of large booths, tables &amp; chairs, and the bathrooms are clean and new. The staff is knowledgeable, attentive and helpful.   Our pizza arrived sooner than expected and we thoroughly enjoyed it. A beautiful blend of flavors and textures - we had the Old Chicago which includes Italian sausage, meatballs, garlic, mozzarella, provolone, romano cheeses, oregano, and lots of robust tomato sauce. It's a very hearty pizza (one size offered, which was a large) and we could only fit one slice a piece. The rest we boxed to go - it felt like it weighed at least 7 pounds!  We are happy we celebrated Valentine's Eve at Capo's! Between the two of us, the pizza continued to last for another couple meals! Now 'That's Amore!'  PS: Cash only.",

We all got soup as part of the meal - others loved it...I'm kinda \"meh\" on soup in general...  We had one of the cool old school red leather booths. Ordered a lot of wine (served by a cutie waiter - who kept it coming!)  The night is a bit of a blue - but the next day everyone said what a great choice it was, so I call it a success.",

Well, that all changed last night in a single bite: the revelation that is Capo's Chicago deep dish.  We went with the Old Chicago since we figured it'd be best to start with their most classic pie. Rather than work the ricotta into the pie as Little Star does, they add it in beautiful little dollops of heaven on top. Result: crispiness perfection throughout the pie. Forget about the Little Star crust. Yes, it is delicious. This takes it to a *whole new level*.  Within bites I was a giggling mess. What?! How is this pizza this good?! I'm a changed man.  At the risking of sounding like I think everything is the best I shall describe the other delicious fare we enjoyed:  -spaghetti and meatballs: spaghetti is more like bucatini. Yes. Tomato sauce is the same perfection served on the pizza. Yes. I want it everywhere. -caesar salad: fantastic. Just the right amount of dressing, not too heavy. -tiramisu: yes! Get it! I can't recall having had more delicious tiramisu anywhere else in SF.  Serve all this up with really nice service on the phone despite the fact that the place was totally hoppin. The hostess Julie couldn't have been more accommodating in managing to get us seated at 8:30pm on a Friday.   YES!",

Quatro Forni -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F181w77z&amp;s=034097fecf78cb9309b2176292ce1f82b65320ec0928310a45b89e1aa29293ae\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/181w77z</a> Cooked 4 times in 4 different ovens w/ Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Garlic, and Oregano.

Secondly, do yourself a favor and get ANYTHING with sausage involved. \u00a0Their sausage here is literally to die for...sooo bumpin' with flavor. \u00a0 We had: +Stuffed bell pepper appetizer (which had sausage in it--amazing) +Old Chicago deep dish pizza (once again, more sausage and huge globs of ricotta)  Plus, they give you complimentary bowls of some sort of minestrone to start with. They don't have the greatest cocktail menu, which was kind of a bummer, but they did have some of my favorite wines (Qupe), so I ain't mad!  Overall, fun mobster sort of atmosphere and ridonculous deep dish pizzas! Oh yeah, and get there before 6 so you don't have to wait a century for a table.",

    "review_text": "Meeting with some old friends, I was the last arrival of our party of five at Chubby Noodle. \u00a0Walking in, the bar/restaurant only had a few occupied tables, a stark contrast to my last visit during the holidays. \u00a0My friends had drinks in hand when one friend grimly said \"The menu's changed.\" \u00a0My eyes studied their menu which did not have any of the staples that I knew and enjoyed. \u00a0In emergency mode, I called Capo 's and scored a table ten minutes later.  Appetizer 1) Baked artichokes - Creamy rich and heavy. \u00a0Not good for the health conscious.  Mains 2) Calabrese sausages and peppers - Definitely the most flavorful dish of the evening.  3) Old Chicago pizza (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&amp;select=FWruU9CdksoIf0R8dHIpRw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>) - Waiter's recommendation, this did not disappoint. \u00a0Heavy flavors were lightened by the dollops of ricotta cheese. \u00a0If you like sausage, look no further.  Side 4) Meatballs - Nothing to write home about, just okay. \u00a0Might be jaded by Tony's giant meatballs.  We were also given small metal bowls of their complimentary Minestrone soup (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&amp;select=Yg_TQ2_fOYUQm7wG_4gQRQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>). \u00a0 The feel is certainly less hectic than Tony's original spot and there is a huge difference in the fare here. \u00a0Things are more simplistic and heavy (read rich and hearty) which exemplifies the Midwest/Chicago palate. \u00a0There are several other menu items that catch my eye and would warrant another trip here. \u00a0 The food we ordered rates 3.5 stars, but rounding up a half star for potential missed items in their extensive menu. \u00a0 Oh, and if you are history buff and a fan of the Untouchables (black and white or Costner version), you could treat this like a mini museum of that era. \u00a0 Will be back.",

The four of us ordered one of each type of pizza (except for the stuffed). It was a bit ambitious but it was too hard to decide! We called ahead to order a Quattro Forni - the pizza that is cooked 4x in 4 different ovens. They only have 20/day and it was definitely worth it. The crust had a nice crunch but the dough was so soft and chewy. Our second pizza was the cracker thin crust - i was surprised at how delicious it was. The name says it all, it really is cracker thin, but imagine it warm, with cheese and sauce and whatever topping your heart desires. Our 3rd pizza was the cast iron pan. For that pizza we got the Frank Nitti and the ricotta on top was very delicious. The cast iron pan crust is similar to the Quattro Forni. It is more bready and very delicious. For our final pizza, we got the chicago deep dish. I honestly can't be very objective about this because by the time this pizza came, my stomach was beyond it's capacity. I can say the tomato sauce ratio was perfect and there a hint of sweetness which was perfect.   On top of all this pizza, we had the complimentary soup and a delicious side order of the meatballs. The Meatballs are delicious, i highly recommend it.  Besides all the amazing food, the decor of Capo's is awesome. They have the old time cash register, a phone booth that actually works (i saw someone use it!), leather booths, brick walls &amp; a high ceiling which makes the place seem bigger and more open.  Even though i'm still in a pizza coma, i'm looking forward to coming back to try their other dishes!",

As we approached Capo's my wife exclaimed, \"How does he do it! This place looks like it has been a popular spot here for decades.\" In fact, we were going to Capo's on the second night it was open. Incredibly, the staff seemed to be already in stride and the kitchen in peak form.   To start the meal, guests are offered a complementary bowl of white bean and vegetable soup that would make your Nona smile ear-to-ear. We ordered The Sam Giancana deep dish pizza--made with tomato sauce, Mozzarella, Provolone, house honey Calabrese sausage, Chicago Italian sausage, garlic, oregano &amp; Romano. It was so flavorful, the sauce so delicious, it would have made Tommy Dorsey forgive this pie's namesake for \"convincing\" him to let Frank Sinatra out of his contract (an offer he could not refuse).  The stylized Chicago-retro interior is replete with heavy nostalgic touches that include a vintage cigarette vending machine, period phone booth, gangster photos in oval frames and massive red leather booths. Somehow all these visually-demanding elements managed to sync harmoniously without seeming contrived or forced; the place is very cozy and intimate.   I look forward to returning to sip cocktails like the Wise Guy--made with Rye Whiskey, Fresh Lemon, Cracked White Pepper, Orange Marmalade, Agave Nectar, Fresh Oregano--at the bar while watching Tony's magic unfold.   Only one warning about going to Capo's: It's CASH only.",

It was served with the whole romaine leaves which I like, but I know some people don't like the stalk. The meatballs were a perfect consistency and tasted great and the marinara sauce is perfect! It is rich but flavorful and complimentary. We ordered the garlic bread thinking it was just a side but it was a whole plate! It was also very good. We skipped over their pasta and meat dishes and went straight to the deep dish pizza. I loved it! It was very saucy and very cheesy which I love! The crust was cooked to perfection and magically didn't turn soggy even with all of the juicy marinara sauce on it! This is by the same guy that owns Tonys down the street which has a more classic take on pizza and Italian food, so we knew that this place was going to be good, and it definitely lived up to our hype.

Worst case scenario, just park at the garage up the block on Vallejo.  I had their Wise Guy at the bar while I waited for our table. Quite refreshing and not too sweet. I'd get it again.  For our table, we tried the anchovy and sardine crostini, meatballs, a deep dish (Old Chicago) and a cracker thin (Johnny Torrio) pizza. The restaurant served us all complimentary soup! The crostini was a bit too anchovy for me, but the meatballs were superb! Putting some of that along with its sauce spread over some bread made for a great bite-sized meatball sandwich!   On to the pizza. The deep dish seemed like it had a cornmeal crust (just like Little Star, my fav). The sauce was a little sweet, and I could taste sausage in every bite. The mounds of ricotta on top was a nice touch. Kinda wished they cut the deep dishes slices smaller. I was definitely surprised by how great the cracker thin crust was. I absolutely love their crust! Wasn't that big of a fan of the peppers on top, so I'd probably choose another type next time.   We were completely over stuffed by the end of the night. Would absolutely come back and also want to try their other pizzas, especially the Quattro Forni which is only limited to 20 a day.",

Tony came in to cook for the event and even came around to say hi to everyone, and there seemed to be a constant flow of pizza and pastas. We got 3 drink tickets plus dinner for just $60, *and* there was a cocktail making contest!  Chris was an awesome bartender. We realized that he had actually served me when he was working at 25 Lusk and kept me company when I got brunch at the bar one day! He's still just as easy-going, fun, and great at making drinks as before.  Some highlights from the drinks/food I tried that night:  * The Wise Guy - 5 stars (Rye Whiskey, fresh lemon, cracked white pepper, orange marmalade, agave nectar, fresh oregano) Amazing! Everyone loved this drink. It was wonderfully balanced, tart but not overwhelmingly so, with a little bit of spice. A must-have.  * Thin crust pizzas I love the bit of grainy crunch (they told us that they add a little bit of corn meal to add that texture). This isn't your classic, softer neopolitan-style thin-crust pizza, but has a much more hearty crust and they were all still really good.  * Deep dish pizzas Compared to other deep dish pizzas I've had, this one has a much thicker crust. Looking at a slice, about 50% of the volume is in the crust! There was a pizza with all kinds of meat, but this one had too much cheese that tended to harden pretty quickly. There was one with a layer of meat covered by tomato sauce and a bit of cheese on top - this was my favorite! It was well-balanced, didn't have as much of an overwhelming amount of crust as the others, and I loved the tangy fresh tomato sauce.",

The crust is super thick and kind of dry. The regular deep dish is fantastic though and the cracker thin was seriously out of this world. I like the cracker thin crust even better than Tony's. It has some kind of cornmeal on it to make it extra crispy.   They have wines on tap, love the pinot noir, very drinkable and went well with the food.   Got the whiskey crisp for dessert, also great.   My absolute favorite part about this place is the ambiance. Its just so cozy and fun and they have these big snuggly booths for larger parties.

The bar has some great innovations on classic drinks too. Great place to chill out with friends, cozy up on a date or hang out at the bar just off the little italy strip. The appetizers are delicious and well proportioned. Main course are big enough to do a family style dinner or satisfy a fairly hungry solo. My table ordered the following and shared: - Wood Fired Baked Artichokes : Delicious and large portioned. Very saucy/cheesy though, a little much for me. (3/5) - Antipasti Platter : Again with the large portions, but very good quality meats. (4/5) - Baked Conchiglie : My favorite dish so far. Delicious red sauce with crab meat and shrimp. Perfect for a lighter course, but still filling and flavorful. (5/5) - The Dillinger : Deep dish pizza, but with a deviation from the classical variety you'll see at Zachary's or Little Star. Wasn't my favorite since I'm one for lots of tomato sauce on my Chicago style. (3/5)  I think this is going to be my go to place when I want to get out to North Beach, even to just grab a drink, and say hi. It's so hard to find places in S.F. that really take hospitality to heart, so I hope Capo's sticks around for a long time.",

We shared the garlic bread with cheese and mushrooms, Caesar salad, and The Dillinger pizza. The Chicago style pizza, although not my favorite (I'm a ny guy) is so unique and has a great crust from the cast iron skillet. It's a truly filling meal but one I would come back to time and again.",

Capo's defnitely sits at the bottom of the list of deep/stuffed pizza in SF (below Patxi's, Little Star, and Zachs). The pizza was way too salty, they use lard in the crust, and there were generally issues with the crust (too thick, not flaky enough). The top layer of dough on Capo's stuffed pizzas is crispy, whereas traditionally it should be soft. The fave pie at the table was actually a cracker thin crust one. The cocktails were nice and strong. It was really easy to make a reservation (avail. for groups of 6+). The interior was nice (Roaring 20s-esque), although the bathroom was sort of ghetto (had a bunch of cleaning supplies in the corner). Cash only. I'll be sticking to Patxi's for my stuffed crust fix.",

I don't remember what it was, but I loved it (always a good sign).   The garlic bread was *perfect*. Makes me feel like I've never actually had garlic bread before this place. Very crispy, with fresh cloves of garlic on top, just enough olive oil to melt in your mouth, and italian spices.   The salad was great. Perfect amount of everything, dressing was just right.   The pizza. (eyes roll back in head, writer forgets where she is for a moment). Okay, I'm back. The pizza was incredible, 13\", but seemed far bigger. We got the \"cracker-thin\" crust option, which was crispy but substantive, and we chose a meat pizza. I don't remember the name, but it had sausage and slices of beef on it. I did end up taking it off some of the beef though, because for me it was too much meat for me, personally (not to say it wasn't also incredible). They used sweet peppers and onions, and again, italian spices - not too much but more than most pizzas. Perfect!   Service was good. There was a giant table of dot-com people next to us that looked like they stepped out of a cable show, and they were a little loud, but it was a nice, festive atmosphere.   We ended up taking half of everything home - and that says a lot, because my husband and I eat like lions when we go out. It was almost as good the next day. Going back soon!",

Lots of people will walk in the door here and immediately be in heaven. \u00a0It has a very tasteful but obviously \"Italian Restaurant Template\" interior design: moody lighting, exposed brick walls and beautiful big red booths. \u00a0If you're a more discerning type you'll probably be mildly concerned that you're about have a dining experience more in line with Maggiano's but trust me, there's nothing to worry about. \u00a0Personally I think it's got a great vibe for what it's going for.  Most of the food is perfect comfort food preparations of favorites and served in massive quantities. \u00a0Seriously, you'll be just fine if you come in here, order one appetizer and one Deep Dish pizza for two or three people. \u00a0Their tomato sauce base they use in lot of the dishes and pizza is a bit more sour than sweet which according to my taste is perfect. \u00a0I've had a couple of the more conservative deep dish pizzas and they're awesome (I think I've had the Pepperoni one and one with a bit more meat?) \u00a0Just a side of meatballs is delicious because they serve as a sauce delivery device. \u00a0I've had the vodka sauce on Pasta here too and while it's not as immediately delicious as the others it's still enough to make me want to order it again.  Service is nice and attentive. \u00a0They were particularly nice the last time as they gave us a bunch of free appetizers to apologize for our reservation being delayed by nearly :30 because of customers sitting around txt-ing, Instagramming their food and drinking wine instead of gettin' the hell out.

The service reminds me of Europe in that the table is yours for the evening. They didn't rush us at all and actually left us to talk. When the server noticed we were finished, he watched us and waited for us to finish our conversation before asking if we wanted the check.  5. The server was totally honest about the portions and encouraged us not to order any appetizers or sides because our meal would be plenty. I really admired this honesty.

I can happily report that, ignorance aside, Capo's serves up some seriously mother-flippin' tasty deep dish pizza.  And not just the deep dish - although the San Giancano with the house honey Calabrese sausage is tremendous. The tomato sauce has a depth of flavor belied by its simplicity, a sweet savoriness that coats the mouth and activates immediate drooling. The crust is made with special flour and coated in cornmeal, a more than able vehicle for the thick load of mozzarella, sausage, and sauce lying above. But again, I repeat - more than just the deep dish is superb here. The cracker crust Jonny Torrio with Italian beef and giardiniera is perfection on a plate, tender meat and pickled peppers, folding the tongue into \u00a0a loving embrace. The calamari and salads brought over from Tony's Pizza Napoletana are just as pleasing, and the complimentary vegetable soup to warm the belly and whet the appetite has a clarity and flavor that's most appealing. The ONLY reason Capo's lands a four instead of a five is because I prefer Tony's Pizza Napoletana by just a hair - the larger variety of pizzas and the cocktail menu are slightly more to my taste. This is, perhaps, an unjust rating, and Capo's is well worth a five by any other standard. Tony Gemignani once again has created a masterpiece, a work of love and some ridiculously good eats.",

In my prohibition era-obsessed mind, the phone booth is where you give a secret password (for who knows what), &amp; the brick walls contain trapdoors (leading who knows where.) No need to worry, everything was copacetic, no funny business occurred, at least not while we were there.   Food, I'm sad to say, was not as exciting as the restaurant's setting.   We ordered:  -- spaghetti &amp; meatballs ($18): pasta was way too thick &amp; al dente. Meatballs &amp; sauce were a-ok, but the pasta ruined this dish -- \"big Jim\" colosimo's triple double: takes about 40 min to bake. Enjoyed the tasty crust &amp; generous piping of ricotta. Absolutely humongous. I only finished half a slice, &amp; I usually throw down a couple slices easily. There's a lot going on between all that crust &amp; three meats. I brought a slice home, &amp; it was even better the next day! -- complimentary minestrone: nice &amp; light. Tides you over if you're starving &amp; just can't wait for the main event   If I were to come back, I'd definitely try a different pie, served a different way (margarita on a cracker thin crust, perhaps?)",

Levi the bartender was extremely professional and courteous. We were promptly gifted some soup which should have been presented with a straw. I forget what it was called, something Italianish, but not minestrone. And it was more delightful than a massage with a happy ending on senior citizen discount day. Then came saut\u00e9ed spinach drenched in sweaty garlic and my side salad with cherries, nuts and blue cheese. The salad itself could have easily fed every customer in the restaurant. ..a spattering of extras from any given Sopranos episode. Then came our Quattro Forni, a four times cooked deep dish pizza hybrid that you must eat with a fork. They only prepare 20 a day. They accommodated our request to make it half vegetarian, half prosciutto. And they were not skimpy on the prosciutto either. Heaven served on a raised pie platter! To complete the meal I ordered one of their signature cocktails, the Wise Guy, a concoction of rye whiskey, fresh lemon juice, agave nectar, crushed white pepper, orange marmalade, yes marmalade, and \u00a0garnished with a sprig of oregano. Life changing! Levi kinda sorta filled me in on the measurements. If Jesus was a bartender, this is what he'd make you.  I don't make it a habit to venture out to North Beach, but with old school Italian respect for food and service, I will be changing my tune.   And now the Sopranos theme song is stuck in my head. Oh, and like the show the owner's name is Tony.  You woke up this morning Got yourself a gun Mama always said you'd be The Chosen One.",

    "review_text": "It's no secret our family has been big fans of Tony for years so when we heard about a second restaurant in North Beach opening up (an old-school Chicago style pizzeria) we couldn't wait to make our first visit to Capos.   The short quick review: Go to Capos, we loved it. Everything we ate was really delicious. It is fun, casual, small and intimate but has that upscale quality. You'll need a reservation and it is cash only but well worth the bit of extra planning. \u00a0We had the pasta fagioli,a light Italian broth with a nice kick. This was the special of the day I think. The first pizza was the QUATTRO FORNI, it's basically a nice thick pizza bread topped with sauce and cheeses cooked in 4 ovens (a meal in itself), then we tried a deep dish called JONNY TORRIO &amp; the cracker thin SAM GIANCANA. All are very different and all really savory. We loved them all. There were 4 of us so we took home leftovers for the next day on purpose. Gotta love leftovers! We have already made plans to go back and take friends.   A few more details...We made reservations a few days before and headed out for a fun night on the town with the kids. Parking was surprisingly easy for the city. There is a garage just a couple short blocks up the street. The attention to detail has always been a big part of the experience with Tony. Each booth is named after a notorious mobster and there are other fun things to take note of like the old phone booth and vintage cigarette machine. From the look and feel of the restaurant, to the service and the food, it's the whole package. \u00a0So when you go make sure to take your time to enjoy. Don't rush it not that kind of place but they do encourage a call ahead to preorder since some of the pizzas have a bake time up to 35 min. We spent a couple of hours lingering and enjoying the food over a bottle of Italian wine. \u00a0The service was wonderful with multiple people checking on us throughout our visit. The bar is quite impressive as well with an extensive whiskey menu. Very enjoyable experience, highly recommend checking it out.",

The place is a good size although if you are really interested in eating here, I suggest you go early. \u00a0The pizzas at minimum take 40 min to bake so most people at the restaurant are there for a good two hours. \u00a0Another thing to note...CASH ONLY. \u00a0Usually, this would defer me on going but I am more than happy to carry cash from here on out to get some delicious pizza! \u00a0They have four different ways you can order your pizza: Deep Dish, Stuffed, Cast Iron Pan and Thin Crust. \u00a0We ended up trying the Big Jim, stuffed style. \u00a0Man was it good and HUGE! \u00a0In the pizza there were at least 14 different types of toppings from veggies to cheese to meats. \u00a0What made this pizza amazing over all other pizza that I've ever had is the sauce! \u00a0Not too acidic and had a nice sweet edge to it. \u00a0I literally could have a bowl of the sauce alone and be very happy. \u00a0Plus as an added bonus, the crust was really really delicious!  My friend who likes to claim himself a pizza connoisseur, is madly in love with this place as well. \u00a0Sadly he says.... \"This could actually beat my favorite place, Pi in St. Louis/DC and I don't even live in SF!\"  The staff is really great and I highly recommend sitting at the bar if the tables are full. \u00a0Great way to make friends with the bartender as well as talk to the other patrons enjoying their pie. \u00a0  Make no mistake...I will definitely be back!",

Out of the four pizza crusts, I've tried deep dish and cracker crust. \u00a0I prefer the cracker crust, as it's light and lets the flavor of the toppings come through more. \u00a0The Old Chicago pizza on cracker crust is amazing.  Along with pizzas they have something called a Quattro Forni, which is quite similar to a pizza, but cooked in four different ovens to give the thick crust an amazing airy texture, but be crispy on the bottom. \u00a0We had the one with prosciutto and arugula and it was fantastic.   Everything else I've eaten here is top notch - the complimentary soup, the meatballs, the Caesar salad, and I have to give a special shoutout to the Antipasti Platter. \u00a0The freshly shaved prosciutto was the star of the show. \u00a0They have an old fashioned deli slicer in the front window and shave off slices of prosciutto fresh to order. \u00a0The flavor is fantastic and it practically melts in your mouth.

We started with the meatball side, garlic bread (with the works - spinach, truffle, oil, etc) and artichoke dip - it was all decent but I wouldn't be surprised to find the same food at a BJs or some sort of chain. For pizza, we did the deep dish Big Jim. It was just OK. Sadly, I wouldn't recommend this place or come back. BUT i will be going back to Tony's, which is why I was surprised this place wasn't up to par.  However, I will say service was 5 stars and portions are huge so there's great value here.",

(It says 35 minutes on the menu so a long wait is the norm).  So knowing both these things up front, had to problems.  The Service. We are seated by the hostess and given the run down. 5 minutes later we get drinks. 15 minutes later a waiter takes our order. 25 minutes later our pizza shows up. During the course of the meal I was asked if I wanted another Coke. It never showed up. I do not need my waiter to be friendly and interested in my day. I just need him to be around in a timely manor. After we finished our meal, we sat another 15 minutes before I was able to catch someone and ask for our check.  The Food. We got a deep dish pepperoni and garlic. The crust was fairly thin, the mozzarella was about an inch thick, add some pepperoni, whole garlic cloves and then a large helping of a very wet red sauce. You had to cut small pieces off because you we're chewing a ball if cheese. Flavors were all over the place and did not meld together very well.  A great product would have let me easily over look the poor customer service. We are reheating the left overs for breakfast. We will see if the food is any better the second time around.",

Being from Chicago, I was very excited to hear about Capo's and had very high expectations - which were not met.  We came early (6 pm on a sunday night) to avoid crowds and were seated pretty quickly. The booths were full so the 5 of us were seated awkwardly around a table. We ordered the artichoke appetizer, the honey and calabrese sausage appetizer, a deep-dish pizza, a \"quattro forni,\" and 2 pasta dishes. The artichoke dip was quite tasty and ridiculously rich (a theme which was welcome early in the meal but became a bit tiresome). The sausage appetizer was truly enormous - I don't know how many pounds of sausage came out, but it was staggering - and unfortunately had too much honey for my taste. Our waitress gave us an extremely detailed description of the quattro forni, and it was fine, but nothing special (I found it too bready, and I generally like bready!). One thing I do like a lot is the tomato sauce, which was very generous on the pizza. Overall, the deep dish was one of the better dishes I tried.  There were a couple of minor things that irked me: as many have noted, it's cash only, which strikes me as pretty silly for a restaurant in this price range. I understand that it costs money to take credit cards, but personally I feel like one thinks a lot about ordering another cocktail or glass of wine if one has to make sure to have enough cash. Maybe they're being considerate of our finances.  And be very careful when ordering here. When asked if the sausage is pork, our waitress said \"yes... it's a blend.\" We had to specifically ask if it had beef (which it did). Additionally, the complimentary soup has chicken broth, so it's out for vegetarians. As noted on the menu, most of the pizza crusts are not vegetarian either. And a baked pasta was ordered without cheese - it came without mozzarella baked on, but still with Parmesan sprinkled on it, so we had to send it back.  When we visited, one bathroom was out of commission, leaving only one available. This lead to that awkward situation where you have to watch the bathroom like a hawk and try to jump in as soon as it's free. Hopefully this was fixed promptly.  To be honest, I found the food to be a little on the salty side while we had it, but for the next day noticed that I was drinking tons of extra water, and having just had some of the pizza as leftovers, the salt stands out more.  Finally, the portion sizes are absurdly large. This makes it difficult to try different dishes. It would be great if half-sizes were offered. I understand that it may be harder (but not impossible!) to cook a smaller pizza, but it's just as easy to serve less pasta.  I'll definitely stick to the slice house!",

No longer worth it. \u00a0Anyways, we settled up, left our 20% tip as you always should. \u00a0And then walked out without so much as a goodbye from our server. OR.... And this is the other Kicker...

We knew there would be a wait, but I didn't expect as long of a wait. We were quoted 1.5 hour, and that's almost exactly how long we waited. Points for being accurate Capo's! They took our number and we went nearby for beer.  It took a long time to decide what to order, and several of the things we picked they were out of.  We ended up with 1 cracker thin crust, with different toppings on each half. I appreciate when pizza places will do that, then you get to taste more things:)  LOVED the cracker thin crust. The whole table LOVED this pizza. It was the big winner of the night.  After having the amazing meatball at Tony's, we got the meatballs (we were told they were the same.) They were good, but not as good as the meatball at Tony's.  A Chicago style was ordered as well, because, we came here, how could we not?  Not a fan, we made the mistake of ordering a pizza we thought had red sauce (this can happen if you've been drinking) , and it didn't. I like my pizza with red sauce. This pizza was too cheesy,and \u00a0too heavy.I couldn't even finish a piece.  They also have a great whiskey selection and good cocktails.  I would return, but only for the cracker thin crust!",

I put my name down, and the hostess took my phone number. I love that they do this because I always hate when some establishments make you wait around to be called. This way, my boyfriend and I were able to cruise around North Beach and take advantage of the time we had there. Something I wish they would have told us before though was that you can pre-order your pie!   While walking around the thought occurred to us that maybe we could pre-order since deep dish pizzas take around 30 minutes to bake. We went back to the restaurant and filled out a pre-order slip for the Sam Giancana, recommended to us by the hostess, and were able to continue our jaunt around North Beach. When we were called back to the restaurant we got our pie in about 10 minutes of being seated, which was truly perfect timing after finishing our complimentary soup. The pizza itself was pretty great, I loved the red sauce and the crust was perfect. Of course deep dish styles have a huge amount of cheese, so just be prepared for that. I would return here, but maybe at a less crowded time and I think I would definitely pre-order again rather than having to wait for so long at the table. You have to have a really interesting date or a book to keep you going. This is definitely a cute date place because of the nice interior and cool speakeasy-ish vibe.",

Al Capone doesn't usually come to mind when I think of an \"Italian Stallion\" but Tony Gemignani's newest restaurant, Capo's is inspired from Al Capone's Chicago of the 1920s. Walking into Capo's, the vintage scarlet leather booths, brick walls, chandeliers and \u00a0saloonish style bar was contemporary old school with a touch of sensuous swank: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FVrq1q6&amp;s=3867ebff144781d090e043bebe2b9f0ba111868f97c09bbe2d5e823d4abc27d4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/Vrq1q6</a>. The dining room is small with just 5 booths, 4 small tables, and bar seating (2 flat screens TVs) so don't come without reservations (phone reservations only).   As a 11 Time World Pizza Champion, I expected nothing less than stellar at Tony's new restaurant. In addition to thin crust pizzas, there's stuffed pizzas, Chicago deep dish pizzas, pastas, and rustic Italian dishes on the menu. The cocktails ($12) are amazing. Although most are whiskey and bourbon based, the Suicide made with white rye is perfect for those who favor clears. Be forewarned though, the cocktails were very stiff and packed quite a punch. I was buzzed after half and after two, I was ready to...oh yah, PG-rated. CASH ONLY (there's an ATM inside).  We started dinner with a complimentary Minestrone Soup which was ultra-comforting with tender veggies and al-dente pasta: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1029hVk&amp;s=3d7b5810749c98c60f29c933df8b38e14c3a1ba3026a748b81d683630dd9fe0b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1029hVk</a>. Enough to feed a family of four, the Traditional Calamari ($13.50) had an extra crunchy exterior crust and was tenderly sweet: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F13I8Ggf&amp;s=d07b13c7b1193bef74f73a7682260b1bbbb1812d1489f9126987147e28a8d235\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/13I8Ggf</a>. If one appetizer wasn't enough for a party of two, we also ordered the Baked Artichokes ($13.50) in a Spinach and Provolone Sauce: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F10293O6&amp;s=6ffd7d9c567e5d4ad9eafc9a7c35487ef18f7cd01dc193ae23048bc522d1e856\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/10293O6</a>. I didn't care for the artichoke hearts which were too sour for my taste but the decadent, oooey goooey sauce was sinfully good with the crusty bread. Not a fan of deep dish pizzas, we ordered the Sam Giancana Pizza with a Cracker Thin Crust ($20): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FXdHmQ1&amp;s=3e01a9c681f578f1c0d60bfc28c204cea47f945647d80da1926c78dfe4686806\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/XdHmQ1</a>. Even better than the thin crusts at the Tony's first restaurant, these crusts were dusted with corn meal which helped the crust stay crunchy throughout and helped cradle the m\u00e9lange of vibrant tomato sauce, mozzarella and provolone cheeses, duo of sausages and garlic. Using both the house honey Calabrese sausage and Italian sausage was genius as it gave the pizza a good balance of sweet savoyness.   Don't leave Capo's without ordering one of their rustic Italian chicken dishes. The Chicken Marsala ($20) was perfectly roasted leaving the skin crisp and the meat succulently juicy: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F13I8uxF&amp;s=21d9f743194faf8b4281ede89cfafc36aae06531b62153801258f61ac7db471e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/13I8uxF</a>. The mouth-watering marsala sauce had an amazing depth of flavor and earthiness from the chanterelles. Every time I go to Tony's, I can never get enough of his balls; his meatballs that is: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FYbM2g8&amp;s=9be43ce3e26a11b91056dc5ce3820e6b3f68236a6ecb5f5dc50844f1be2cefb7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/YbM2g8</a>. \u00a0A side of the same bountiful Meatballs (3 for $5) will leave you wanting more balls in your mouth. As recommended by our waitress, the Whiskey Crisp ($9) made me weak in the knees: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FV8iRG0&amp;s=b5bd2c3e1180b8497746f1eaf8ef749479175598f5ba95be35f8a355ef0bb1fa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/V8iRG0</a>. Like a thick, dense apple pie filling, the apple and pear mixture was spiked with 4 Roses Whiskey, cinnamon, caramel and topped with oats for that layer of crunch. Served alongside creamy vanilla bean gelato, it gave the dessert that cold and warm temperature contrast which I love.  Just as wonderful as the food is the incredibly warm, friendly, and attentive staff. Rebecca was our waitress and she was an absolute delight. Food service was timely and you can even call in your deep dish pizza order before arrival to avoid the 35 minute wait. I appreciated that the manager checked in with every table which is always a nice touch. Oh yah, it doesn't hurt that the entire staff is attractive. HOLLA! Opps, did I say that? =X  Parking is a nightmare in the area but there's a garage a block away near the police station on Vallejo or you can valet your car for $10.   Capo's definitely won my heart and tummy with their solid, delicious Italian eats and super stiff cocktails. And I'm sure it did the same for Mr. NSS because he got...  Sorry folks, I promised PG-rated remember?",

As for pizza, we ordered the cracker thin Margherita and Triple something for the deep dish. I'm not a deep dish fan, but I have to say it was pretty good in terms of the crust &amp; sausage. We all enjoyed the Margherita as well. The two pizzas were more than enough since the deep dish is super heavy with the cheese, sauce, and dough.

I liked the people here from the get-go. \u00a0After having dropped my girlfriend off while I parked, the maitre'd told me as I entered that he was worried someone would scoop her up in my absence (a common fear, rarely alluded to with such comedy.) \u00a0 The bartenders were simply delightful, taking the time to be personable and helpful to us even as garrulous regulars chatted them up while awaiting their next whiskey flight. \u00a0 The first waiter we saw came bearing a complimentary bowl of pasta fazool, a warm and tasty way to tune us up for the meal.  We knew there'd be leftovers, mind you. \u00a0A serve swept by with a large plate of garlic bread - had to have some - and then of course also one of the salads, perhaps to provide in our minds a mildly healthy counterbalance to the colossus to come. \u00a0The garlic bread, smothered in mozzarella, covered in roasted garlic, was a real treat, though we went slow on it. \u00a0The caprese salad featured homemade mozzarella slices, soft and plentiful, and a bright red and tangy heap of minced peppadews, a rare treat I appreciated even as my lovely companion did not.  Then came the pizza - a full hour after our order, and no wonder, given how much work the oven must have had to do to get this sucker baked through and piping hot on its arrival. \u00a0We went for a stuffed masterpiece with delightful, chunky tomato sauce on top, a generous portion of sauteed spinach below, and the creamy decadence of ricotta between layers of the crust. \u00a0The crust itself had heft and crunch, but was pillow-soft inside. \u00a0 \u00a0As we reached our point of triumphant gluttonous ecstasy after just one piece, we were sent packing to dream of leftovers for tomorrow's dinner and to plan for which gargantuan pie might strike our fancy during our next visit.",

    "review_text": "I'm giving this review 3 stars after waffling back and forth wanting to give 2 stars.  OK folks, this may be a long one.  I feel like I need to preface this by saying I ate at Capo's on opening night and while I expected some missteps I was disappointed by my overall experience that night. This being said the pizza was good and I will be back to try other items on the menu and give another review.  It took two days of calling to get a reservation. Even after following the directions to leave a number with requested date, time, number of people in party, and time to call back. They did not call back at requested time. We got a reservation and once there were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. This was the biggest problem of the evening. We ended up seated at a table in the bar side of the restaurant. A big problem with this table was that since it was regular dinner table height instead of bar height most people standing around at the bar did not notice people at the table until they were practically in our laps, or in one instance practically a butt in the face. More than once did I have to utter a \u00a0loud \"Excuse me\" and the date finally had to go to the hostess to have her say something to bar patrons. If they insist on having a table in the bar it really needs to be bar height. The hostess tried to move us, but it never worked out. Ultimately sitting here for the entire dinner ruined the whole experience for this first visit.   The restaurant is beautiful, from the cork floors, brick walls, red pin-tucked leather booths, vintage phone booth (and yes, you can make free calls in the US), and vintage cash register. The bar is similar in appearance to the bar at Tony's.  Our dinner consisted of the following:  Libations: Peroni $5  The following cocktails were on the house from Tony himself. Tony was very friendly and personable, greeting patrons whenever time permitted.  Suicide Koval Chicago White Rye, Fresh Lemon, Cr\u00e8me de Violette,  Luxardo Maraschino Liqueur, Amarena Cherry $12  Chicago Cocktail Courvoisier VS Cognac, Cointreau, Col de Salici Prosecco,  Angostura Bitters $12  Appetizer: Small plate of assorted olives  Complimentary Pasta Fagioli  Wood Fired Clams Casino-White Wine, Bacon, Garlic, Bread Crumbs, Romano, Lemon &amp; Parsley $12 I can make a pretty mean Clams Casino at home. This dish was good but at $12 for 8 of the smallest manila clams I would definitely not order again. I am used to going to any number of french bistros and ordering Clams or Mussels Mariniere and getting a big bowl for less than $20.  All pizzas are named in either reference to Chicago or to \"honor\" Chicago organized crime bosses. Pizzas are available in different crusts including Deep Dish, Stuffed, Cast Iron Pan, and Cracker Thin. Eating at a pizza joint paying homage to Chicago it was a no-brainer to order a deep dish version.  Pizza: \"Big Jim\" Colosimo's Triple Double Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Provolone, Garlic, Pepperoni, Chicago Italian Sausage, Ricotta, Meatball, Roasted Peppers, Bacon, Oregano &amp; Romano(Deep Dish) $33 The pizza was delicious with a full flavored sauce, excellent sausage, and extremely creamy ricotta cheese. I would order this again, but for the me this is a California take on a Chicago style pizza. I am a Giordano's girl through and through and there is no comparison.  Desserts: Spumoni $6  Tiramisu Savoiardi Dipped in Espresso w/a Hint of Rum and Frangelico, Layered with Mascarpone &amp; Whipped Cream $8  Once it was time for dessert we ordered only the Tiramisu. The dessert arrived and we were served one of each. Our mistake was not questioning why we got both. We wrongly assumed one would be complimentary after having the major issue with the table. But we were wrong and both ended up on the bill. After the fact I was grateful for the spumoni as the Tiramisu was a dud. It came served in a small mason jar which while it looks cute, it doesn't work for the proportions of the ingredients. There was not enough ladyfinger to compete with what was a way too sweet mascarpone.  Tony knows pizza and I will give them another chance once they've been open a couple weeks. On a positive note, the hostess told us to remind her of the problems we had and she will be sure to book us a booth the next time around. Stay tuned for chapter 2.",

The complimentary soup was fantastic,I'd go back just for it!  We ordered the Old Chicago deep dish with spinach instead of sausage... The verdict? Split decision. I loved it. Better than little star! My husband? Little Star is a 10 in his book, this gets an 8.9.  As expected, drinks were great. Had Unti wine on tap and a couple of cocktails.  We preordered our pizza earlier in the day of our reservation. They double and triple checked our order and everything came out perfectly.  Don't forget the phone booth!

We came in on a Thursday around 7pm. It was pretty full, but not packed. No one had to wait for a table.  I love the look of the place - the wood, the upholstery, the music, the decor... it takes you back to another time. The service was also quick and friendly. Our water glasses never got half empty. We were well taken care of.  I was a little put off at first by how close the tables of two were. It was a challenge to squeeze into my seat without grazing against the neighboring table. However, it ended up being quite the pleasant experience! The couple next to us got their pizza shortly after we sat down, and as they were also tourists and didn't have a fridge, the immediately offered us a slice each to share in order to avoid leftovers. They insisted, so we enjoyed their offer. They ordered the Old Chicago on extra thin crust, and it was to die for. They also gave some pizza to the couple on the other side of them as well. We became a nice little family and had a good time chatting before they left.  Despite LOVING the pizza they had shared with us (which I will now declare the best pizza I've ever had - seriously, cracker thin crust Old Chicago, get it!), we wanted to try a deep dish. We ordered the Sam Giancana. Do be prepared to wait a while for a deep dish, but it's worth it. Just enjoy a glass of wine and company in the meantime. This pizza is a true pie. We thought we'd be able to eat most of it on our own, but boy were we wrong. After we each had a slice, we split a second, and were completely stuffed, despite having most of the pizza left.  The crust on this thing was perfect. Soft, yet a nice crunchy edge. It was covered in the most delicious tomato sauce I've had. Sweet, but with a little spice to it. The sausage was also cut into nice large chunks, and it was a treat to bite into.  Overall, I loved Capo's, down to the pizza, the service, the wine, the atmosphere... You really can't go wrong here, whether you indulge with the deep dish (with many friends or prepared for leftovers) or with the cracker thin pizza.",

Walking into the dining room, diners are transported to Chicago in the '20s: exposed brick walls and tin ceilings with lots of dark wood.  With mozzarella, wild mushrooms, truffle oil, Romano cheese, arugula, and whole garlic cloves, the truffle garlic bread ($8) is to-die-for. \u00a0Rich and delicious, the wood fired conchiglie baked with dungeness crab ($19) is a hearty serving of pasta with mountains of crab. \u00a0  Fried and then baked four times in four different ovens, the quatro forni did not disappoint: its tomato sauce, mozzarella, garlic, and oregano were perfect. \u00a0With tomato sauce, mozzarella, provolone, house-made honey Calabrese sausage, Chicago-style Italian sausage, oregano, and romano, the San Giancana was fiery and cracker thin.  With mozzarella, provolone, tomato sauce, Italian beef, Chicago-style Italian sausage, hot giardiniera and sweet peppers, oregano, and romano, the deep dish Jonny Torrio pizza ($26) was a spicy masterpiece. \u00a0At almost 3 inches thick, a single slice will fill you up, but it tastes so good, you'll want more.  The service was friendly and attentive, and the complementary homemade soup made the 40-45 minute wait for the pizzas fly by.   Some tips:  - Capo is cash only. \u00a0Bring cash. - Come hungry. \u00a0Portions are huge. - Go with a group. \u00a0That way you can try more items.

We finally got around to it earlier today despite the neighborhood's challenging parking on St. Patrick's Day, no less. But we finally managed to score a spot WITH a broken meter.   Their menu offered a few pasta dishes, some sides but their main specialties are the pizza which comes in stuffed crust Chicago style and thin. I even saw someone with a hot sub and a side of criss cut fries. Complimentary soup is served to all guests which I enjoyed.   We both decided on the slice of the day as an entire pie seemed a bit too much for the both of us at the time. The stuffed crust slice accompanied a side salad and was fairly priced at $10. I found my slice to be slightly overwhelmed by the sauce and I would have liked a bit more cheese. Also the crust was a bit hard for my liking but I think this is because the slice of the day is most likely premade and reheated upon order. Our neighbors had a thin crust and it looked delicious and fresh. We also had the garlic bread with wild mushrooms, mozzarella and truffle appetizer was tasty and I think I might have even enjoyed that a tad more than the pizza itself.  Servers are fine however my water could have been refilled more often. After I had my last bit of the pizza my water glass was completely empty and the person refilling was nowhere to be seen.   I'd be willing to give them another shot however I think I will opt for a freshly made full pie next time.",

But we drove and drove and drove until we found a parking spot. There were plenty of good-looking restaurants everywhere, but NOOO, I really wanted to see what the hype was about.  For starters, this is a CASH ONLY place. It says so on the door. Okay, cool. So they want to be a little old fashioned. I'm cool with that.   The inside is gorgeous. Brick walls. Huge, ornate, quilted booths. Low lighting. It all looked good. But that's about where it ends.  We had many waiters and all of them had no personality. For a minute I thought maybe they were racist! Bad assumption, I know, but they were so bland! I practically starved myself all day because I was craving penne/mostaccioli pasta and all of its al dente chewy goodness. My boyfriend and I both wanted the same pasta plate (Wood Fired Mostaccioli Genovese.) It was about 4:15 p.m. What does the waiter say to us? \"Our pasta guy is not in. He won't be in until 5:00 p.m.\" Pasta guy?? If they were open, and they specialize in Italian food, shouldn't they have a \"pasta guy\" at all times??! I was so disappointed. We drove so much and I felt too defeated to get up and leave. So the waiter suggested the meat lasagna and said it would be enough for two. So we got that. It had absolutely no flavor. The best part of the meal was the initial complimentary soup and the two beers my boyfriend tried. They didn't even offer any sugar or have any available for my iced tea.  Maybe I'm being dramatic.

Because it's so filling, it's difficult to order anything else but a pie. \u00a0It takes about 45-50 minutes for the deep dish but in the meantime, they gave us complimentary minestrone soup, which was surprisingly flavorful and really hit the spot on a cool evening.  Anyways, no matter because all you need to know is to get Old Chicago deep dish.  Also good to know: cash only.  The decor here is really cool. \u00a0Really like the old school vibe.",

The only annoying bit is that Capo's is cash only. \u00a0What kind of moderately priced restaurant +bar is cash only?! \u00a0But even with this caveat, I will return.",

What I would skip next time is the Quattro Fromagi appetizer (they claim they only make 20 per day, so we thought we had to have it)...it was like a fried foccacia bread with a little cheese on it, quite dry and not at all what the menu description lead us to believe. Wine selection was nice, I had a grey goose and soda that could have used a touch more goose, but everyone else's drinks were spot on. \u00a0My only constructive criticism is the \"cash only\" policy...who wants to be in North Beach with that much cash on them in this day and age?

The vinyl booth seating was a nice touch, though not exactly the most comfy. Pizza is the focus here. They have 4 types of crust: deep dish, thin, stuffed, and cast iron pan. All the pizzas only come in one size. The deep dish was 8 slices, but even just 1 slice was filling. We had trouble deciding between all the combos they had, they all started to look the same after a while, but went with the Big Jim in the end. The deep dish Big Jim was sooo delicious-- meaty, lots of tomato sauce and droplets of mascarpone on top. We had leftovers and when the pizza cooled up in the fridge, we could see all the neat layers of meat inside. The minestrone soup and bread was delicious as well.  Remember to bring cash!! And a lot of it too. If we had more cash on us, we would've ordered more food. I think Capo's should seriously consider accepting credit card payments because they may potentially be losing business from more and more people who just don't carry cash anymore.",

    "review_text": "I must begin this review with a nod to the awesome service. The LF and I have had a trip planned to Napa Valley and SF for quite some time now to meet up with some of my family from Michigan. It was the occasion of their 40th wedding anniversary (!), and the trip started off in The Holy Land for winos. I searched out what sounded like a perfect place for the actual anniversary dinner in St Helena. The service there was sorely lacking (will review soon), to the point I probably would have walked if it wasn't for a special occasion. We stuck it out, and ended up having a decent dinner, not great thanks to the lack of professional service, but decent.  Well thankfully I was able to point out to my peeps what great service IS during our nearly 2 hour visit to Capo's. Immediately greeted by a smiling hostess, that escorted us to our super comfortable huge blood red leather booth. So as to hide the bloodstains from a possible mafia hit? This cool place has that vibe, especially because of the framed picture of Al Capone staring unsmiling down at us.  Our waitress was that perfect combination of professionalism, with loads of personality, and joining in on our comical banter when appropriate. Always at the ready with suggestions regarding the food and wine, and there exactly every time she was needed. A real pros pro.   I was alerted to this place by Dave G, and we had to try the truffle garlic bread he fawned over. This is without a doubt the best version you will ever have. It definitely was for me. It really is in a class of its own, and calling it mere garlic bread seems to be almost an insult to this divine creation. Creatively assembled with Mozzarella, wild mushrooms, truffle oil, Romano, and arugula, and whole garlic cloves. Arugula, it's a veg-a-ta-bul: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DYtAP3sFYMcg&amp;s=e406849597a38971d48afd336a38e3045f4d82a69d9c6477beee41f64ce8b187\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com/watch?v=YtAP\u2026</a>. I will forever crave this masterpiece.   Be aware that the portions are huge, and your waitress will keep reminding you, thankfully. That is why we split the excellent spinach salad four ways. Truthfully, it is probably suited to be spit for two if you love spinach salad as much as I do, but this is not the place to fill up on salad.   We arrived not starved, and were getting full with the above, but since it was the last day of vacay, lets get a pizza! Damn glad we did. My pushy niece insisted on The Farmers Pie. I have to admit, it appears she picked the hit of the litter. This wowed us all, even though we were getting full. Topped with tre foraggi, a superior spicy Calabrese sausage, bacon, wild mushrooms, 4 over easy Guam farm eggs, peppadews, and more arugula. Dang, what a gift from the Gods. We ordered thin crust instead of their specialty deep-dish, and it definitely did not suffer in it's thin state. Yeow, this was one superb Italian feast.   I have been coming to SF for over 30 years, and this restaurant will forever be in my must do rotation. It's one of those places that it's a good thing I don't live nearby, as I would be drawn here far too often.  Thanks for the heads up Mr. G!",

Well I will have to say this was the WORST pizza I have ever had.....no joke! We ordered two deep dish pizzas-margarita and one that we created with different types of meat and mushrooms. When both arrived they looked like a giant can of tomato sauce had exploded all over them! You couldn't see a single topping just GLOBS and GLOBS of extremely thick and overly sweet tomato sauce...............YUCK! No matter how many layers I took off with my fork there was more! It completely took away from the taste of any of the toppings!   We also ordered two Caesars salads...one arrived within 15 minutes and piled high enough for three of us to share. The other person in our party does not like anchovies so he ordered his own AT THE SAME time as us. We had already finished our salad and he still didn't have his. So we mentioned it to our waitress and she said nonchalantly it's coming\"....seriously??! The other salad did not arrive for another 20 minutes!! I also had to ask for more dressing and I am not one that loves a \"wet\" salad but this one was as dry as it gets and flavorless.   The only reason I gave this place an extra star was for the complimentary soup (some kind of Italian pasta soup) which was pretty tasty AND the fact that the maitre d Mario followed us outside and asked how everything was. Wonder if he could tell how unhappy we were with our food!  I am not sure how Tony Gemignani learned to make so called Chicago style pizza but perhaps he should take a lesson from Old Chicago Pizza in Petaluma that makes such amazing deep dish pizza that it makes me want to salivate just thinking about it!!  I will say the original Tony's Pizza is great but expect to wait 3-4 hours for a table on the wekends!",

Another good point is the now TAKE CREDIT CARDS (which wasn't the case when they first opened!). Stop by and let Capos take you back in time to the Chicago of old.",

    "review_text": "We came into Capo's for a late lunch on a Sunday, and the restaurant was mostly empty around 1:45pm. We were sat at one of their shiny red booths, and ordered a few dishes to share:  -Complimentary Pasta Fagioli Soup (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/capos-san-francisco?select=lt6kJuxQ7RT3A207v_AmLA#lt6kJuxQ7RT3A207v_AmLA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/capo\u2026</a>): Surprisingly tasty! I am not a soup person and actually drank half of this. I liked the pasta in here but avoided the beans. -Garlic Bread w/Mozzarella, Wild Mushrooms, Truffle Oil, Romano, Arugula, $9, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/capos-san-francisco?select=lt6kJuxQ7RT3A207v_AmLA#Bsq9E5uuCgH1my89C09tsQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/capo\u2026</a>): Yum! This was my favorite out of all the dishes we had, and I loved the mushrooms, truffle oil, and cheesy goodness of this version of garlic bread. A must order! -Fried Chicken (Bone-In Leg &amp; Thigh w/Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Bourbon BBQ Sauce, w/Side of Vesuvio Potatoes, $21, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/capos-san-francisco?select=lt6kJuxQ7RT3A207v_AmLA#33k5H2jGxDrJqjXlquVb6w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/capo\u2026</a>): Just ok. The chicken was tender, but there was still a tiny bit of pink by the joint areas (we didn't notice until we got home since we took a lot to-go). However, I really enjoyed the bourbon BBQ sauce. The mashed potatoes were too thick and the vesuvio potatoes (w/garlic, peas, lemon juice, olive oil) were ok, but nothing special. I wouldn't order this dish again. -Chicago Beef Sandwich (Traditional Italian Beef in \"Au Jus\" w/Giardiniera Peppers &amp; Mozzarella, $12): I only had a small bite of this sandwich but could taste that the beef was really dry. Also, the peppers are actually quite hot, so tell them to leave it off if you don't like spicy food. However, I wouldn't order this dish again. -Conchiglie Baked w/Dungeness Crab (\"Arabbiata Style\" Spicy Tomato Cream Sauce, Calabrian Chiles, Shrimp, Garlic, Smoked Provolone, $20): This dish tasted a little fishy/crabby to me for some reason, which ruined the overall taste. I loved the conchiglie though, and the texture of the baked dish.  -Margherita Pizza (Mozzarella, Provolone, Tomato Sauce, Garlic, Basil, Oregano, Romano, \"Cracker Thin\", $21): This was just ok- I didn't like the cracker thin version since it was too thin and crunchy for me. I wish we got the Cast Iron Pan version instead, but that takes 45-50 mins version the 20 mins for the Cracker Thin. I wouldn't order this version of the pizza again.  The service here was excellent, but I didn't like a lot of the dishes we ordered. I wish I had ordered a different pizza and crust instead since that is what they're known for. I've had Tony's pizza (their sister restaurant, and only a few blocks away) on my bookmarks for a while now, so I'd opt to go there in the future versus returning. However, Capo's is a good option to check out for Italian food, but just avoid most of the dishes that I ordered! Parking in this area can be tough, especially during the weekend rush hours, but metered street parking is available along with pay lots.",

Of course we needed to replenish the carbs.  Secretly convinced that their vegetarian/discretionary pescatarian eating habits would stymie my first Capo's experience, I encountered quite the contrary.  1. The Garlic Bread ($4) + Mozzarella ($2) + Wild Mushrooms/Truffle Oil/Arugula ($2) -Tony absolutely crushed it here. Huge portions with whole garlic cloves that costs just a tad more than a slice of pizza? Holy crap, I'm sold. I honestly see myself jsut ordering this for takeout. 2. Wood Fired Conchiglie Baked w/ Dungeness Crab ($19) -This did the trick for those of us who ran 13.1miles that day. As advertised, it was a hearty serving of pasta without skimping on the crab. 3. Old Chicago (Cracker Thin $22) -The cracker thin variety laden with sausage and meatball and finished with a dollop of ricotta on EVERY slice provided a textural symphony and resounding taste fermata. \u00a0Heck, it even tasted great as leftovers. *The meal started with some free soup. It was quite tasty but the soup maker that day was a bit heavy-handed with the salt.  Why wait 2-hours with no reservations possible for Tony's #1 when Tony's #2 (Capo's) is down the street, more accessible, and a perfect sit-down spot.",

    "review_text": "READ MY IMPORTANT NOTE AT THE BOTTOM (NOT THE CAPO) FOR A GREAT TIP  This place is run by the same guy that run's Tony's Pizzeria down the street. \u00a0You can argue which is the best in North Beach, but Tony will just smile all the way to the bank. You know what? \u00a0He deserves it. \u00a0He puts out a good product from the ingredients up, hires great servers (and hosts), and does his best to create a unique atmosphere. \u00a0If I was coming from out-of-town and wanted an experience in San Francisco's famed North Beach, this would be what I might hope for. \u00a0Certainly better than going to the Stinking Rose, Mona Lisa, or any other number of places hoping you don't know better. \u00a0I might even say the diners at Capos are more discerning, attractive, and fun loving than at the Stinking Rose. \u00a0:) \u00a0You judge for yourself.  As far as deep dish style pizza, a pound+ of cheese is not really in my current diet plan. \u00a0Is it worth the extra calories? \u00a0I'd say Capo's delivers a solid pizza. The crust at the back edge is really nice with the cornmeal crunch (helps the pizza not stick to the cast iron pans). \u00a0The sauce had a little bit of bite and was delicious. \u00a0So, thank you Tony. \u00a0But it didn't necessarily blow away any of the other pizza places (little star, patxi) with authority. \u00a0I think I might need an exceptional sausage (more fennel)?   Results: \u00a0We both ate one slice each, and I tore off another bite of crust to achieve satisfaction. (That comes out to ~$5/ slice--and being that each slice was a full meal, that's a good deal for me.) \u00a0And let me tell you: the to-go box, with four remaining slices in it? You will need two man biceps for that. \u00a0It was the heaviest to-go pizza box I'd ever hefted. \u00a0You might as well slap a 24 hour fitness sticker on that and practice curls all the way to your car/hotel.  One thing that is important to note--is the wait can be long--sometimes 1-2 hrs. \u00a0Why? \u00a0It's a popular place, but really, deep dish pizzas take 30 minutes to bake. \u00a0So make sure you come with someone fun to talk with. \u00a0Prepare a 1 hour conversation for the wait (maybe walking around North Beach--they will call you when your turn is up). \u00a0And for the table, if you're not very conversational, bring along a book or stream the Sopranos on your phone. \u00a0I would say--given the timing of things, a first date might be risky here--as we observed on the table next to us with two recent divorcees (drunken man, elegant asian lady). \u00a0You could literally hear her thinking \"this pizza better be worth it...\"  So, some tips: the restaurant, in a stroke of efficient elegance, allows you to pre-order your pizza once you are on the waiting list. \u00a0Instead of waiting 1.5 hrs to sit, sitting down to peruse the menu, ordering, then waiting 30 minutes for your pizza to arrive . . . our pizza arrived 10 minutes after we sat down. \u00a0Just enough time for the free pasta fagioli soup (not bad) and some crusts of bread (clearly designed to sate your hunger temporarily until the ovens catch up with your order). \u00a0Our pizza arrived a good 15 minutes before the divorcee daters' (and she was steamed!--effectively dooming that date to hug status). \u00a0But otherwise: \u00a0WINWINWIN. \u00a0you get your pizza faster, tony's turns your table faster, and the line outside becomes shorter. \u00a0  Finally, even though going with your honey is fine--maybe this place is better suited for a large party. \u00a0The booths (for four) are swank looking--very upholstered. \u00a0And there is a large mega booth that can probably fit 8--and you can even reserve in advance larger parties. \u00a0The pizzas themselves have six massive slices--and you can save on the hernia bills if you finish them and carry them in your tummies rather than carry them out in a box. \u00a0Meanwhile, the 2-tops (tables for two) have just enough real estate so you can see the pizza and just a little bit of your date. \u00a0Plus, as you've already figured out by now, the date tables are a bit close to each other. \u00a0 Close enough so you can hear the dating history of recent divorcees.  Cash only. \u00a0Valet for $10 (fortune cookie garage for less--about 1 block away).",

    "review_text": "North Beach has always been known for its Italian food. \u00a0Until recently though, it hasn't had great pizza. \u00a0Sure, there's Golden Boy, but I rarely have it before 1am. \u00a0And I never have it sober. \u00a0That said, it's good stuff. \u00a0With the addition of Capo's, and of course Tony Gemignani's other amazing restaurant, Tony's Pizza Napoletana, I can no longer say there's no good pizza in North Beach.  Yesterday was my first meal at Capo's, but I will be back several more times to work my way through the menu. \u00a0Although, only few days old, this place was running like a well-oiled machine. They nailed it. \u00a0  The look and feel of Capo's is unreal. \u00a0As soon as you walk in, you can tell this place is special. \u00a0My buddy and I sat at the bar, but I couldn't help but wish we sat in the one of the plush booths behind me. \u00a0Next time.  As for food and drink, I started out with the Made Man. \u00a0Whisky isn't my go-to drink, but I liked it. \u00a0It was expertly prepared by the bartender. \u00a0Our meal started off with a complimentary serving of fagiole and bread. \u00a0It was a light, but very tasty way to start off the meal. \u00a0Next up was the chop salad. \u00a0Iceberg lettuce, garbanzo and kidney beans, onions, olive and a very light and tangy oil and vinegar dressing. \u00a0Nothing special here, but it reminded me of the salads they served at old school Italian restaurants on the east coast.  For the pizza, we ordered the Michigan ave (cast-iron) and the quattro forni -- Tony's award winning pizza. \u00a0Quattro means for, and forni means oven. \u00a0This pizza was baked in 4 different ovens! \u00a0Both pizzas were amazing. \u00a0Tasty sauce and cheese, and amazing crust.  I rarely give out 5-star ratings, but Capo's is definitely deserving of one. \u00a0It's hard to think of anything that could be improved upon.",

As many have mentioned, this is a cash only establishment. \u00a0While this is the norm when compared to the nearby Chinese eateries, Capo's is also trying to establish their cocktail program which can run up the tab so I'm not sure this makes good business sense here. \u00a0I for one would be more conscious when ordering my alcohol here to make sure sure I brought enough cash to cover my tab. \u00a0Though ATMS are close by, I wouldn't feel safe withdrawing money after a glass or 2.

Ambiance : This place has a great vibe. \u00a0We loved the over sized red leather booths. \u00a0It felt like the business had been there for years and we had been taken back in time.  Service : The wait staff was amazing. \u00a0They were very attentive and there were plenty of them! \u00a0The manager came over to greet us and checked in on us as our check was coming to make sure everything was perfect with our meal.  Food : Like I said before we ordered too much. \u00a0We were asked to pre-order our pizza's since the deep dish take 30-40 minutes to prepare. \u00a0Really, I don't think it made a difference as we had to tell the waiter we had done so and they were fired up shortly after. \u00a0Capo's brings to you a complimentary pasta fagioli which was flavorful and delicious. The garlic bread oozed in cheese and garlic. \u00a0We also ordered the Quattro Forni which was a smaller version of their pan pizza cooked in 4 different ovens. \u00a0We did this as an appetizer. \u00a0While it was good, I would skip this going forward. Salads : The spinach and mixed green were both delicious and fresh. \u00a0If you haven't guessed by now, at this point we were all full. \u00a0But, our pizza's had not arrived! **The Pizza's** We ordered a the Frank Nitti cast iron pizza. \u00a0Frankly, the only reason I did not like this is the crust is just too thick. \u00a0We were afraid to order the cracker thin crust but, from looking at the tables around us it looked like a thin crust pizza. \u00a0The flavors were wonderful we just cut off most of the crust. The meat eaters made the best choice of the night. \u00a0They ordered the Old Chicago pizza. \u00a0It was amazing. \u00a0One slice is all you need and the pizza has 6 slices. \u00a0I have to talk about the sauce because so many places just have a sub par pizza sauce. \u00a0The sauce at Capo is filled with chunks of tomato, spice and it has a slight, and I mean slight, sweetness to it that rounds out the sauce very nicely. Yum!  If we want a deep dish pizza we will skip patxi's and little star and head to Capo's. \u00a0 Enjoy!",

The setting was great, the service was pretty good, and the food was excellent.   The free minestrone was pretty good, but the clams we had as appetizer were to die for. We had the Deep Dish pizza with the thick crush and it was amazing - I think I would offer Tony personally to clean his kitchens on the weekend free for a LONG time if he would teach me how to make tomato sauce the way he does - absolutely the best.   I can't wait to come back here and try more of the menu - plus, for a Thursday night, getting a table was a breeze!",

We started with the garlic bread topped with truffle oil and mushrooms, and the mixed green salad. The complimentary soup was also a nice surprise, along with the good looking server who brought it over - which was the little lift that my table needed.  We ordered the Old Chicago (sausage/meatballs) deep dish, which was quite filling and we took a few slices to go. \u00a0It was a beer (Goose Island Matilda) and wine night for my group, but the cocktail menu (Wise Guy) sounds inspirational for trip number two.  The service was stellar, and Tony himself, even came over and thanked us for dining in last night. Just another highlight. \u00a0The service and staff were super friendly, and helpful, whether in person or over the phone when making the reservation.  As for the interior, I did feel like a boss! Especially, sitting in one of the red cushioned booths. \u00a0All I really needed was a cigar and I'd be in a season 3 episode of Boardwalk Empire.   I've been looking forward to it's opening for awhile, will definitely be back in the near future and am adding it to my must do it again list.",

    "review_text": "Originally I had tried to come here on opening night only to be turned away. \u00a0I stumbled back in here for lunch this last Saturday and gave it a try. \u00a0They had a nice lunch special advertised for a slice of deep dish with a salad for 10 bucks. \u00a0A great deal already and it came with a cup of soup too. \u00a0The food was all pretty solid. The pizza which is the star of the place was very good and from what I've been told by the pizza experts I know, very much in the style of Chicago style. \u00a0  My problem is I've never been to Chicago and my deep dish roots are built from Zachary's. \u00a0So any hardcore proponents to the \"traditional\" style of things who might read this keep in mind I was just raised differently. \u00a0I didn't like the crust too much as it wasn't crispy and flaky like Zachary's. \u00a0I've learned Capo's is the way it should be so if you're into that then you will probably dig it way more than me. \u00a0As far as the rest of the pizza it was great and really nice they do a slice special. \u00a0I wish that was possible else where because I hate having to rally a group just to get some deep dish. \u00a0  The bar is really nice and the staff was polite and cheerful. They do very good cocktails as many places do these days. \u00a0I suggest trying the \"Wise Guy\" personally.   One other huge gripe I had was they only take cash. \u00a0Now I get the whole trying to make it seem like Chicago during gangland times theme but as far as only taking cash that's just ridiculous this day and age. \u00a0Especially then having to use the ATM in the back which has fees which then takes away from any value I just got from the special in my opinion. \u00a0Get over yourselves and take cards. \u00a0They take cards at farmers market stands I'm sure you can break down and take a card at your permanent venue. \u00a0You can afford a website you can afford to take cards.   If you want deep dish and a great cocktail this is the place for you just remember to bring your gangster roll.",

Big, overstuffed red leather couches, brick everything, comfy bar stools. It's a good thing the furniture is so comfortable, because you're going to need the support after you stuff your face with the best Italian food you've had in a long while.   Food: \u00a0Perfect. I wish they would open a day spa so I could bathe in a warm pool of their red sauce. Lasagna cut outs over my eyes, my hair wrapped up in spaghetti. Between two, we ordered garlic bread with mozzarella, the clams casino, a carafe of wine, and the meat lasagna.  -- complimentary minestrone- tasty and light, a nice way to start the meal. the noodles looked like the race car spaghetti-o's --Garlic bread w/ lasagna- perfect. studded with big pieces of melty roasted garlic, the bread was just the right balance of chewy and textured, not overly crunchy and flaky like you're eating garlic drywall.  -- Clam Casino- an antipasto, not a huge dish but packs a big hit. maybe 15 clams, each one filled with a fat clam on one side of the shell, and bacon on the other. They were perfectly cooked, meaty with just the right amount of chew. The broth was rich and great for dipping bread in -- Lasagna- If I ever find myself on death row, I might eat their lasagna as my last meal. It might even do the added benefit of killing me ahead of the gas chamber, because the portion is massive. It was enough for both of us, plus both of our lunches tomorrow (with a spare piece or two of garlic bread). Layers and layers of delicious pasta, perfect red sauce, and fennely, mild sausage.  -- wine carafe- because, alcohol. she said it was about 3 servings, but was really more like 4.5. plenty of wine for 2 people.   Grand total was $66 w/out tip. More than enough food for us to be plenty full, and enough leftovers for both our lunches the next day.   Protip- if it's not peak hours, bring a few more friends so you can try more dishes. It would have been nice to eat other things too, but they would have had to knock a wall down to forklift my fat ass out after.",

    "review_text": "Man on man do they have some GREAT food! I wish I could say the complete experience was the same, unfortunately it was not.  FOOD- Let's start with where Capo's excelled. Everything that went in my mouth was stupendous. We tried the Garlic Bread with Cheese, Old Chicago pizza (deep dish) some wine and the comp soup. The soup was far better than I expected it to be, actually it was one of my favorites of all time! It didn't have much in the way of pasta or vegetables but the broth had a mild kick to it which was well worth it to me. The Garlic Bread just completely melted in your mouth and was the perfect way to start the meal. The pizza was huge and covered with so many toppings that I could only handle eating one slice. Everything about it was top notch, the only negative I would say was the sauce which I liked.. But it was a tad too sweet. They do warn you when you're seated the portions are family size and they aren't kidding so don't over order!   SERVICE- It was Sunday night and we didn't plan ahead enough to make reservations. So we had to wait about an hour and a half for a party of two (The food was worth the wait) certainly not their fault for us not planning but just as a warning to others out there the place is small and the food takes a long time to come out so it could be a while before you get a seat if they are full. Service however was pretty bad. Once we were seated the server came by dropped off menus and took a while to come back. We had another server (possibly the manager) come by to assist with wine selection and drop off the wine. At one point we wanted to clear the table since there isn't much room so we asked the bouncer if he could bring a box. He took the bread and didn't return. Our server didn't come by for quite some time so we flagged her down to ask about what happened to our garlic bread and she condescendingly said \"you haven't got your pizza yet so they keep your boxed food in the back until you are done eating\". That's awesome! She just didn't need to be rude about it. It took about 50 minutes for the food to come out and in that time we weren't checked on once. A food runner came by dropped off the food and shortly following the server finally came and dropped off a check. She didn't ask how our meal was, she didn't offer dessert or coffee (which I was planning on getting, but didn't) and mind you she asked every other table around us but skipped us over. I was completely surprised that the she was that bad.  PRICE- Considering the amount of food you get its acutally pretty good, the Pizza, Bread, Soup and a Bottle of Wine came out to $73 and we had tons of leftovers. The only real negative thing I have to say money related is they ONLY TAKE CASH SO COME PREPARED!!!! It's really odd that a place that sells bottles of wine only takes cash, I understand small hole in the wall quick service places only taking cash but a place like this!? Very Odd.  All in all I loved the decor and ambiance , food was amazing but servive was subpar. I would gladly have given them 5 stars if their service was even a tad better. Basing most of my review off of food, you wont go wrong if your looking for AWESOME PIZZA!",
