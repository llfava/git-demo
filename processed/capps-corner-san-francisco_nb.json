    "review_text": "Magnolia Thunderpussy!   This is the first thing that comes to my mind when Capp's Corner is mentioned.   For those of you who are perhaps too young to remember, Magnolia's real name was Patricia Donna Mallon. She was a San Francisco burlesque performer, radio personality, filmmaker and restaurateur. \u00a0Thunderpussy operated two San Francisco restaurants in the 1960s. The one in the Haight, which bore her name, featured a late-night delivery service and erotic desserts such as \"The Montana Banana\". It consisted of was an unsplit banana, representing a phallus, served \"erect\" in a food service \"boat\" with two scoops of strategically placed ice cream, shredded coconut (care to guess why?), and a small dollop of whipped cream at the \"tip\". She created a host of other such delectables that, at the time seemed deliciously scandalous.  San Francisco columnist Herb Caen was an ardent fan of \"Magnolia\" and wrote about her often in his daily column for The San Francisco Chronicle. She was also very much appreciated by a legion of rock musicians and bands who came to San Francisco to record. Her catering operation would deliver her signature food items to any location in San Francisco at any hour of the night or early morning, and was hugely popular with the bands and their followers. She was also a big hit with the local \"Cannabis Culture\" who for obvious \"Munchie\" reasons, couldn't get enough of her fare.  Loved for her razor sharp wit, sense of daring and flamboyant imagination, she carved for herself a reputation of fun and free-spirit at a time in the Bay Area when all things seemed possible. Ah, the good old days!  During my time living in San Francisco, she was also a hostess at Capp's Corner - a cool family Italian restaurant here in North Beach. It was her name that got me in the door and the old school comfort food within this cool restaurant that keeps me coming back even today.",

He said it was not the best sauce he's ever had, but he comes from an Italian family (and we know all Italians love their sauce the best). \u00a0  My spaghetti came with an overflowing amount of mussels and three large prawns and the most delicious creamy pesto sauce I've ever had.

When you walk into Capp's, you feel like you just walked into an Italian family's dining room. Big smiles greet you (and even a kiss on the cheek if you're a regular), with a general air of \"welcome to the family\". Raucous Italian discussions outburst at the bar, where the bartender seems to know everyone who walks in.  The food, however, is very generic Italian with little culinary experimentation. I tried their special, the Chicken Canelloni, and it was pretty boring. It wasn't terrible, just unimaginative. I wish I could give 5 stars, but this is a food review.  Capp's is a great family place and definitely an experience, but I'd recommend it for the atmosphere and not the food.",

I'm guessing drunk because her teeth looked like she just drank 4 bottles of Cabernet. She kept forgetting to bring us stuff after we asked her for things and she was slurring her words and kept wishing us a Happy New Year. The food was mediocre at best. We ordered the veal tortellini, chicken parm, and the lamb. The pasta was a little overcooked and just not very tasty.   The prices are pretty good but I definitly won't be coming back.

Like, my Italian relatives who are total racists --wait, let me rephrase...my relatives who really like Italian food and that's why they only eat at Italian restaurants would love this place because it's like eating at an Italian person's house. No I will not articulate that further, if you don't know what I'm talking about that means you are clearly not a wop with dago shame.  Ok fine, what I mean is they give you a lot of food, it comes with shitty white bread and butter, the marinara could be better but it's decent, the Manhattan I ordered came in this tiny glass, and the red and white checkered tables looked like they had been there since this place opened 50 years ago. This place is less upscale than the Olive Garden but totally genuine and has great service.   We kind of had to wait a bit so the waitress brought us complimentary garlic bread and charged us for a bottle of house wine when the bottle I wanted was out and she brought us a bottle of Gabbiano Classico, which I actually really liked and went well with the food. I really like when I get great service without getting smoke blown up my ass if I can say that without Yelp HQ taking down yet another of my reviews (I cunt believe those cunts sensor me like that when they aren't busy licking Mike Z.'s old saggy ballsack). Our server (Courtney? I don't know if I'm remembering that right but she asked for our names and I told her Lauren and she ended up calling me Lorraine which, whatever, I'm totally fine with) was really sweet and generous but she did tell us basically to sit the fuck down at the bar and she'd come get us when a table was ready. She kept it real, like this place does with everything else. Also, she was majorly hot and I'd totally scissor her if she's reading this and interested. Not that I'm going to insinuate that I heard from someone who heard from a cop that this place has mob ties because that would be fucking stupid of me and totally untrue by the way, but if I did, she would be like the Adriana from the Sopranos of this place.",

Both were delicious, low cost and their was so much, along with the fresh sourdough bread and creamy butter, that we were stuffed and happy by the time we were done with lunch. Plus the coffee was top-notch. Therefore the 5 stars.",

    "review_text": "I'm a little biased towards Capp's cause I like the loud bar in the background and I used to work two doors down at Beach Blanket Babylon. \u00a0If you want a quite little dinner, then don't go on a night that there's a show down the block, cause it gets LOUD! \u00a0You'll be safe before 8 in the evening on just about any night though.  As far as food is concerned, don't go traditional Italian at this place. \u00a0The basics are not very good, don't do marinara or spaghetti with meat sauce or any of the usual stuff. \u00a0Get the special \u00a0or save yourself the headaches and get the Veal Tortellini which is epic. \u00a0The pasta is just firm enough to hold all the innards of the tortellini inside and the sun dried tomato sauce on top is just the right combination of spicy and tangy. \u00a0The portion is more than sufficient and depending on how much of the delicious Minestrone, made on sight, and house salad you eat beforehand, you may have leftovers. \u00a0Take it home! \u00a0I ate mine at about 2 or 3 in the morning as a insane dream inducing snack. \u00a0I love cold pasta late night and this was one of my better experiences.  If you are up for it, hang out at the bar afterwards with Terry and Rose. \u00a0Two great characters that add some fun and entertainment after a few glasses of wine with dinner. \u00a0Terry won't kick you out at the supposed 11 o'clock closing time and we managed to keep him there til the bar across the street started closing up. \u00a0I know some of the actors from Beach Blanket Babylon and they will be glad to entertain you with their antics and grab ass. \u00a0Be ready to be friendly or you won't have a very warm welcome and may get a few cross words. \u00a0Don't worry though, everyone is always welcome at Capps as long as you are ready to take and give a smile.",

It smelled delightful from outside, and the three of us were hungry so we decided to give it a shot. After a brief wait at the bar (bartenders were friendly and skilled) we sat down and eagerly eyed the menu. Ordering is made simple, two categories of entrees ($17.50 or $20.00) and everything else is included.   Between the three of us, Roasted Lamb, Veal Cannelloni and cheese ravioli was ordered. along with the entrees came a large tureen of minestrone soup and another large tureen of clam chowder (so good!) then there was salad and of course bread. Meat entrees also came with veggies and pasta on the plate. Trust me when I say you won't leave hungry!  The staff was great. We never had to wait for anything we requested, and I watched in awe as our waitress dealt with *very* rude customers with total grace. Leave your diet at the door and enjoy a lovely meal- bring friends for maximum good time (this place is not another cozy, dark italian place in north beach)",

There was a bartender that had an attitude of a nat. \u00a0When I expressed I wanted a drink that he didnt know how to make he just had this look like, \"Really?\" I explained how to make it then the glass was left with over an inch of empty glass to the top. Then you basically charge me $10.00 for a drink that was not even filled to the top of the glass. \u00a0Other people ordered drinks and they were charged $8.00 and they still didnt have the glasses filled all the way. \u00a0Maybe you should get smaller glasses. \u00a0OHHH WAIT.. You had smaller glass that a friend got a vodka and cranberry in and it was Very Cranberry with very little vodka. Then during the Bartender change over, The newer one apparently was a New hire and still learning.  The Food was nothing real special and very bland. Everything including the soup tasted like it was out of cans. \u00a0I don't mind canned stuff but you could add seasoning and spices. The Burnt garlic bread that came out was.. ummmm Burnt... But it did have garlic seasoning. =) I ordered t he soup, Pasta and salad for like $15.50 and the meat sauce was bland. But... The noodles were cooked well.  The Waitress with an attitude. Let me see Where do I start, \u00a0Where she asked us to hurry up and finish our food and drinks and was not going to offer dessert? \u00a0She wanted to tables for others that were not even there. She had short Black hair, White top and top heavy. She was very rude to some of the people in the party and her tone needed adjustment. \u00a0When I asked her name I think she said Sherry, then she said; \" \u00a0And you can call my boss tomorrrow if you want.\" So, She already knew she was rude. \u00a0She made comments to the other servers and they just laughed it off and her body language towards us was un acceptable.   We went here because we were going to BBB and I am not sure if the restraunt is used to just locals but I would never reccommend this to anyone. Such a shame.  I just called to speak with the manager He said he was John and He said he was sorry, as I was just expressing more detail and he said he was not going to fire her but he'll have a talk with her and he hung up the phone. \u00a0WOW these people have no manners or consideration.",

What a buzzkill! \u00a0I mean we were really psyched to be in a new city about to get some authentic Italian food in cozy Italian North Beach and it just wasn't good. \u00a0The food was bland and basic. \u00a0My ravioli tasted like chef-boyardee! \u00a0I hate chef-boyardee! \u00a0The sauce tasted like it came from a jar. \u00a0Real Italian cooking is based on the idea of using simple, fresh, seasonal ingredients. \u00a0This place tasted like everything was pre-made and definitely not fresh and flavorful. \u00a0I probably should tell you that I grew up Italian-American in New York, with AMAZING cooks in my family. \u00a0I'm very spoiled when it comes to Italian-American cooking (and my husband is too now, by association). \u00a0Needless to say, the place was cute, but it really was not an enjoyable meal because of the food. \u00a0We definitely would not go back to Capp's corner. \u00a0I can cook better pasta at home for an eighth of the price. \u00a0We just left feeling like we totally made a bad choice and wasted a ton of calories for our \"welcome-to-san-fran-north-beach-date-night-\u00addinner\". \u00a0I guess this place would be cool if you didn't know \"real\" italian-american cooking, but if you do, then don't bother.",

The waitress she was good busy as hell since the place was packed and she was the only waitress. \u00a0Suddenly she brought us soup , everything in the soup since is part of the family meal, all the ingredients of the soup were out of the can that automatically start giving me pain in my stomach. Than a hour later they brought was the salad swimming in sauce(dressing) there were so much dressing that was nasty to eat. The salad was complete with thousand island dressing and can beans and can garbanzo beans. We all start to be nervous about our meal that was about to come. When finally the food arrived almost a hour later, it was horrible the vegetables were swimming in butter and super soft. I order the chicken parmigiana what was full of marinara sauce and the chicken it self had no flavor it just taste like chicken. The pasta was over cooked and with marina sauce. I felt like I was eating in a all inclusive buffet, I even think that all inclusive buffet would be better. My husbands food was terrible as well he order the sole and was burned, my sister osso buck was so nasty that she tried and was not able to eat. The polenta that came in her plate was so horrible so horrible that I don't think I have words to describe.

The wine, by the way, \u00a0was Crane Lake (about \u00a0$5.50 a glass) \u00a0which sells at your local overpriced corner store for about $5.50 a bottle.",

Capp's, on the other hand, probably will be here forever, no doubt with the same original decor of a generation or two ago. This popular restaurant reeks of San Francisco history, its walls covered with fading autographed photos of old-time celebrities, including hometown hero Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe, who were regulars here. This is not a place for anyone in search of gourmet dining or nouvelle cuisine. The food here is hearty, wholesome Italian fare like Nana used to make every Sunday afternoon. Most popular are the $17 dinners, which include a huge tureen of decent minestrone, a salad bowl overflowing with crisp greens, beans, and beets slathered with a creamy Italian dressing, and pasta marinara and sauteed vegetables accompanying your choice of entree. Selections include calamari steak, osso bucco, baked eggplant, sausage with roasted bell peppers and onions, roasted pork loin, and roast leg of lamb, nicely pink and succulent. The $15 menu includes the soup and salad, but entrees are limited to various pastas. Fresh, doughy Italian bread is perfect for dipping into the soup or sopping up the nicely spiced sauces. Service at times can border on being insufferably rude. One suspects that the older servers here have been standing on their feet so long that their temperaments are permanently crabby. An ideal spot for families and groups. Sophisticated foodies definitely should dine elsewhere.",

Food: You start with a huge vat of minestrone soup for the table. It's delicious. Hands down the best part of the meal. The salad...ehhh. It's drenched in dressing that is very thick and cloying. Entrees: They are all over the map: I had simply fettuccine noodles with pesto. The pesto itself was good, but the noodles were a bit overdone, and subsequently settled in my stomach much like a brick would. My BFF had the marinara pasta, and she cleaned her plate. Another friend had the pork chops, which she had three bites of and said, \"no.\" Just to round it out, another friend had the seafood pasta, which she announced as one of the best dishes she had had recently.   So, there you have it. It's all over the map. The atmosphere is rockin' in here, and you can tell it's a San Francisco tradition.

We had dinner here for wifey's b-day. There were five of us, so there was lots of sampling going on. What we ordered was very good. They must've had their first stringers in the kitchen this night. I ordered the calamari steak with caper sauce. It was so tender and flavorful. Wife had the Veal Milanese, breaded also with caper sauce. She said it was the best, and I had to agree. I also tasted the tortellini, just awesome with a creamy yet light tomato sauce. Grand daughter ordered Veg Fettuccine. It was piled in her plate. Get this, she expected Alfredo sauce which wasn't on the menu, but the waiter took it back and had it added. How cool was that?  So where's the fifth star? The soup tureen was taken with soup still in it, and the salad was a too plain, just not enough stuff... not even any tomatoes or olives or peppers. AND the only dessert is ice cream. No pies, no canoli... not even any tiramisu. Funny thing, the host (great guy, been there forever), when we asked about canoli, laughingly told us to hit Cafe Roma's, a block away.

Capp's is a family style restaurant with pre-set menus where you can pick your entree and soup, salad and bread are included in the price (about $18-21). They have nightly specials, but were sadly out of clams when we arrived for our 8pm dinner reservation. I had the pesto linguini and the pesto was average (and abnormally green, artificial looking).  The servers are totally nice and the decor is standard old-school Italian with red-checked tables, white porcelain plates and a wooden bar. The food is okay, nothing artsy or anything that will shock you, but okay. This type of place is more about the ambiance than the food.   My Tips: - You should know the minestrone soup is not vegetarian it's made with chicken broth - The wine is not good, but corkage fee is only $10 so bring your own - Don't skip the salad, it is delicious - Entrees mostly consist of pasta dishes so make sure you are in the mood for something substantial  I am pretty picky so family style isn't always the best for me, but the experience was enjoyable.",

However, when my meal arrived, it looked good and all, but the lamb shank meat tasted as if it was cooked a few days ago.

The family style part of the meal is soup and salad, both of which I thought tasted delicious! First time in a while I've had beets in a regular salad. I do wish it didn't come drenched in so much dressing, but I still enjoyed it. The entrees were mediocre IMO. I got the chicken parmigiana and it comes with a little bit of pasta with marinara and veggies. My fiance got the pork chop and I think that tasted a little better, especially being with the mushrooms! Overall the place was okay, and I would return if I needed something close to the area.

My Dad's best friend happens to be Italian, and he swears by this place. I haven't been here in over a year, but i do have to warn people: This is an AUTHENTIC Italian restaurant. Italian cuisine is very light, robust, and rustic. It is not heavy nor rich, like so many chain restaurants have made it. Though I enjoy my fair share of cheesy, creamy alfredo, my skinny jeans probably prefer the lighter stuff.   This is where Capp's Corner comes in. Friendly service, cute kitschy decor (makes me think Michael Corleone is going to come out and bust a cap in my ass--I loves it!), and all around good food. I usually order the linguine with the mussels (I love mussels...and muscles) which is fantastic. I always have leftovers for a yummy lunch the next day. Flavorful yet didn't feel heavy--Wonderful! \u00a0I once ordered the chicken parm and it was a little too overdone for my taste--I don't recommend this here. Their soup and bread were great as well.   Final Verdict: For authentic Italian food in the Bay Area, Capp's Corner is the place to go, Come for the food, stay for the decor, that in itself is one helluva show. Really good food at a very fair price, in this economy, that sounds very nice.",

The server was warm and friendly initally, but developed a little attitude towards the end of our meal. \u00a0He actually brought to our attention what his gratuities should be and took the liberty to make the necessary adjustments.  Capp's Corner reminds me of a friendly and warm SF local neighborhood drinking establishment back in the good ol' days.",

And Capp's... \u00a0It's a bit touristy because it's right near BBB but that's ok because it's basic and authentic. \u00a0I love the random decor, especially the red and white plaid picnic-looking table tops.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs and I have a feeling it's going to become a new crave.  This place is not fancy. It's simple, friendly, tasty Italian. \u00a0It is very family friendly so it's probably not a good date place. Go with friends or family for a casual dinner.",

I guess the staff noticed our lost look because they immediately came outside to ask if we were the couple - with the baby - that was part of the group of four. They brought us inside, seated us immediately, asked about a high chair and took an order for my daughter (who is only a year old). Service gets five stars from me. I felt right at home.   Being a family style restaurant, all meals come with soup and salad. The minestrone was good, but I didn't have the salad (aversion to creamy dressings). As a table we ordered mussels, lasagne, veal tortellini and canneloni. Everything was delicious. We were all incredibly pleased with the meal (and the service!). I'd say my only comment is that the plate of tortellini lacked presentation. The pasta was just kind of dumped on the plate and smothered in sauce - no cheese, no basil, no veggies...the sauce was amazing, though.   Definitely coming back!!",

But, none the less, so grateful a find. It's basic, its unassuming, it's old world SF, and it's great food, elite service and they run it like a nickle balanced on edge. Nothing ever seems to go wrong, although, like any place that serves to please people, I'm sure this is not true,  The minestrone and salad is what keeps us coming back, and I'm not a soup/salad person. But the entrees, although not remarkable, are equally delicious. Just GREAT basic Italian/American fare. It's one of those, you know what to expect, service, food and wait wise places, and they never disappoint. Good spumoni too.",

The Osso Buco is classically done--braised veal shank that you can eat with a fork in a tangy tomato sauce &amp; tender diced veggies with polenta &amp; penne alla arabiata on the side. \u00a0Definitely satisfies the carnivore within. \u00a0I always overeat which causes me problems later in the night but that's what hubbies &amp; tummy rubs are for, no? \u00a0The Cannelloni is also a winner with ground veal &amp; ricotta in a pink sauce--creamy, cheesy, &amp; velvety. \u00a0Be ready to take home leftovers because it's too rich (in a good way) to finish in one sitting. \u00a0Oh &amp; don't forget the specials. \u00a0We had a roast half chicken in a marsala mushroom sauce that was so succulent &amp; tender that during our plate rotations (we like to eat family style) it was definitely the belle of the ball.  The clientele is definitely aging &amp; the communal atmosphere is changing over to separate tables--younger diners don't seem to want to rub elbows with strangers &amp; get caught up in fascinating anecdotal tidbits which is a shame. \u00a0Hopefully Capp's will still be there for next fall's Berkeley games so Capt Hook &amp; I can overeat ourselves into happy food comas when we're in town.",

Have heard about this place and walked by too many times. \u00a0Finally, we decided to try this place since we are running out of place to try in the area. \u00a0Maybe because it was a Friday before the show, the place was full when we walked in but it was warm and it felt homey. \u00a0The lady took our name and when I asked how long it'll be - she said she doesn't know it can be a long time but it will likely be very soon?!? \u00a0She's older and maybe confused...anyway, she suggested sitting at the bar while we wait, not a bad idea. \u00a0When the bartender approached us, we told him we were waiting for our table so we would like to look at the wine list. \u00a0He asked by the glass or bottle - we said both. \u00a0He gave us the menu which included the wine list, both by glass and bottle so not sure why it mattered? \u00a0  The wine list is very inexpensive - the lowest is $10/bottle and $4/glass. \u00a0We decided on a bottle of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo - $16 - think of it as a house red that are served in carafe. \u00a0It's light and easy to drink, probably good enough to have w/ the food. \u00a0The bartender asked for $ but then said he can add to our dinner tab if we wanted. \u00a0We were happy to pay first and leave him a generous tip, he was much friendlier when he saw the tips. \u00a0Happy Holidays to you too pal.  We must have waited an hour? before we were sat. \u00a0Another 15 minutes before we were a glass of water. \u00a0Waited for another 15 minutes and still no bread so I asked hubby to flag someone down. \u00a0The waiter and waitress and the busyboys are never to be found and they never give anyone eye contact. \u00a0We got the hostess to get us the bread. \u00a0When the waitress made it to us, she was apologetic and friendly but still she was mostly a ninja throughout the night. \u00a0  I can't keep track how long we waited for everything, let's just say a simple dinner took about 3 hours total. \u00a0We were not in a hurry but we really can't understand why it took so long for everything. \u00a0Except for the entree, everything is readily available. \u00a0The bread and butter, the soup and the salad. \u00a0The soup and salad were brought to us in a tin bowl, the kind you can find in dollar store \u00a0The minestrone was all celery and carrot with one kidney bean and few slices of onion and some Italian herb floating. \u00a0The salad was iceberg with canned garbanzo and kidney beans, julienne strips of beets and dressing. \u00a0  We decided on: linguine w/ clams and mussels in white wine sauce - it was ok, the clams and mussels didn't taste fresh - I do give them credit for serving it piping hot  leg of lamb - there were probably 5 slices of thinly sliced meat. \u00a0hubby said only the bottom 2 slices tasted like lamb. \u00a0he gives them credit for at least not over cooking it. \u00a0it was served with probably 10 pieces of rigatoni in marinara sauce and a spoonful of overcooked mostly carrot and few pieces of zucchini. \u00a0  Throughout our stay including at the bar - we hear the waiter and waitress asking for drinks to comp customers. \u00a0The table of 7 next to us got comp 2 bottles of wine. \u00a0When we got our check, we were given a 30% discount because we have been so patient. \u00a0While it was appreciated, the amount + more went back to tips.

I never order a soup, salad or pasta side dish on top of an entree because I fear the patronizing smirk of a server who gives me the once-over as I hide myself in black because I am under the delusion it's slimming.  Capp's cuts the crap. They give me the soup, the salad, the pasta side dish and enough bread to feed a small French village during the Resistance. No questions. No a la carte nickel-and-diming here. No way. They serve up each item in quick succession. They don't even mess with checkered tablecloths. They just paint the pattern on the formica. Now that's what I call efficient.  So they have a list of $17.50 dinners - all the pasta dishes sized up to be entrees - or you can have one of their $20 dinners - which are the even heartier meat and seafood dishes. Or you could go for one of the two luxury $25 dinners - osso bucco with polenta (really good!...and you'll be stuffed for days) or the grilled NY steak. For real cheapskates, they have the $15 soup/salad/house pasta combo with \"house pasta\" being code for penne tubes they must order by the ton.  Last night, even after having all those hoity-toity appetizers at Scott Howard during the Yelp Elite event, my friend Carlos and I were still peckish enough to come here. We decided to go for a $15 dinner with penne bathing in the creamiest pesto sauce I ever saw. I've never seen pesto combined with cream before, but hell, who's complaining? And then we decided to split the $20 Chicken Parmigiana dinner. You would think we were bulimic but no. Just two husky guys who don't know when to quit.  The veteran waitress, I'm convinced, can probably serve us with a blindfold on. Here comes the minestrone soup in the dented aluminum bowl. I don't care if the stock predates the arrival of Columbus, it's still the heartiest I've had as it's chock full of chunky veggies. Next comes the salad - which comes in a similar bowl. Iceberg lettuce leaves, tomatoes, cannelloni beans, sliced beets from a can - all of it mixed in a creamy vinaigrette. Reminds me of the school cafeteria. I start to cry 'cause I get all nostalgic.  Ah, here comes the creamy pesto penne and then the man-size serving of chicken parmigiana scorching hot. The side veggies, especially the big chunks of zucchini and carrots - are unbelievably delicious. Must be the stick of butter they obviously use when they heat 'em up.  Full. Uncomfortably full. Too full to go to the men's room in the middle of the restaurant. Capp's Corner never disappoints me. The name always makes me think a one-eyed pirate will come out with a concertina. Ahoy, me mateys. Argh. Maybe it ain't fine dining. But it is about the eating. And who cares? I'm a pig. An unapologetic pig. Go bore someone else with the Zone Diet.

The bartender and other waiter who was sitting there made us feel welcome. I was having a low blood sugar attack so I was extremely pleased that we had bread and soup waiting for us as soon as we sat down. Our waitress was sarcastic and funny! My chicken parmigiana was too bready, but I'm used to my dads where he doesn't use any breading. I loved the soup and salad. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal. \u00a0Would definitely visit again to try something different on the menu.",

    "review_text": "Had dinner here Monday night with a friend that was visiting from Italy who remembered this place and wanted to come here.  This place is old school, no doubt about it. \u00a0In a lot of ways, it's almost like this place is in a time warp, forever stuck in the 70's, 60's, or worse. \u00a0Sadly, this is also true in a culinary sense with the food here as well. \u00a0If you are looking for something trendy or sustainable, this is not the place. \u00a0However, if you are looking for a charming old school Italian restaurant in SF which is almost exactly the way things used to be (except for prices, LOL), look no further since this place is authentic.  All in all, if you take it for what it is, this place can be a fun and most enjoyable dining experience, especially with good friends. \u00a0It's certainly not fancy, but it can be fun. \u00a0Lots of old pictures and caricatures on the walls of celebrities over the years gives this place a true old school Italian/SF vibe.  My favorite dish here over the years has always been their osso bucco and like the other night, is what I always order. \u00a0Not trendy, but nicely cooked and tender while the sauce had a good depth of flavor. \u00a0As always, the dinner came with soup (minestrone), salad (I skipped the salad), and bread. \u00a0Years ago, it also included a choice of ice cream, but apparently that has changed. \u00a0What happened to the spumoni?  The one expression that keeps coming up over and over is old school. \u00a0The quaint little straw bottle chianti that she ordered was the worst wine I have had in recent memory and yet in this environment it all somehow worked. \u00a0Perhaps the alcohol from all the wine tastings we did earlier in the evening was a \u00a0factor as well.  Afterwards, we bounced around the neighborhood and said hello to all my friends in North Beach. \u00a0Definitely a fun night and very Italian or as Italian as you can get in SF. \u00a0Bella notte!  Capp's Corner is a true SF icon, may it last a hundred years.",

What my B.I.L. ended up admitting, is that he'd gone here for years with his father when he was as teen growing up in San Francisco, so his recommendation was based on pure nostalgia, and had nothing whatever to do with the food.  We'd never return for the food -- there are simply better meals to be had elsewhere, at exactly the same *type* of place -- unpretentious.   One star for the funny waitress, however, who couldn't reach to the back to serve one of our diners.

We ordered the family style chicken parm and our waitress told us for family style we get to choose 2 entrees which threw us off so we ordered the pork chop also to share. when we got the bill we were charged for 2 family style meals.. $50 with our drinks when we were under the impression our total price would be the $20 with drinks.   i asked the waitress to explain and she said that family style there only means we share the soup and salad and we each pay the $20 \"family style\" option. then she gave examples of families who come in and try to order family style for a table of 8.. obviously this means we were not the first to misunderstand their menu and she knew we didn't understand when she took our order and could have clarified then.   note to Capps: asking forgiveness rather then permission is not a good way to do business.. this may work for tourists but not return customers.   note to future customers: the food was very tasty and we enjoyed the environment casual dress laid back environment but for what you get $20 is to high.",

They enjoy Capps and are regulars so off we went \u00a0to dinner at Capp's.  Capp's at dinner is not cheap - it's kinda like the Olive Garden in that your entree comes with soup, salad and bread but you have to pay extra while the entree prices are already high to begin with.  The soup was kinda bland but a sprinkle of salt was good enough. The Salad was kinda bland also so off I go to my friend the always there for you SALT. Bread was Bread what can I tell you..... Nothing in the menu really caught my eye so I got the Shrimp Scampi but with creamy sauce instead and on fettucini pasta (WTF - no Angel Hair pasta!!). The pasta looked good but once again the taste or should I say seasonings were lacking.....off to Mr. Salt again.... It was the same situation with my daughter's alfredo fettucini.... Even my inlaws who love this place were constantly sprinkleing salt on every dish- I do not enjoy going to places in which I am paying for tasty food but I'm left with the job of \u00a0flavoring it so that it is tasty. The food should come out yummy already.....AHHHH Anyhow, the ambiance was kick back, loud though and depending on where you sit cramped. But as compared to most places in this city I would consider it spacious. The owner was nice - he came over and chit chatted with us a little.... They do need to put some updated pics on their celebrity wall cause man I don't have any idea who those people are....funny thing was we were for sure that their was picture of Elizabeth Taylor,Ophra Whinfrey and young Michael Jackson but as confirmed by the waitress we were wrong so go figure..... Bascially I've had way better Italian food and for less money!!!",

The restaurant was barely full, there were just a few other tables, so they weren't busy. The busboy was the only one on top of his game, and was very friendly. Not so for anyone else.

More a new wave California restaurant with a pasta dish. Or a nicely decoarated Trattoria that charges an arm and a leg, has a good wine list and decent Carbonara.   Capp's is the place you go for some good food, hearty conversation, friendly atmosphere and the feeling of being ten pounds heavier. Walking in you are greeted by a version of your grandmother and seated promptly. If you have to wait. There is a full bar right in front of you.  Order the family style meal. It is moderately priced. And you get way to much food. Salad, soup, bread, pasta, and then comes your main entree. This is how you do it! Save the over priced thin crust pizza with mussels and California goat cheese for another time.  And the TRUE test of this place. Wine is served in glass cups, not wine glasses.

When my gfriend and I arrived the hostess/waitress sat us in a corner table which is always nice and private. However, while we were sitting enjoying our \"meal\", she came back over to us with our check and secretly asked that we hurry up and finish because her boss/owner was pissed because we were sitting at this table they wanted to use for a larger crowd. Are you F'n kidding me! Is that my problem! We had just started with our entrees and you are pushing me out the door! Granted a table top of 8+ guests is more money for them, but WTF about the rest of us paying customers. I find it very rude to even ask a customer (in the middle of eating) to please hurry so they can sit others. The place had several other open tables they could have pushed together to accommodate the other party. Or they wait like every other normal restaurant does. I complained to the waitress and all we got were two weak-ass free drinks to enjoy at the bar. Plus they offered a free bottle of wine the next time we come in.

My friend suggested Capps after seeing it on Bay Area Back roads and trying it a few months ago. We walked the two blocks and walked in. It was defiantly that family owned been here since the gold rush vibe. Definite authentic feeling. Old head shots on the wall along with red and white checkered tables. The \u00a0bar was crowded with regulars and everybody obviously knew their name.   We were seated immediately. It took a minute for the server to come but when she finally did, she was very friendly. We placed our orders and waited for our drinks. First the bread came out. It was delicious!! I loved the artisan taste of it. Crusty on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. Every meal comes with minestrone soup and salad. The soup was good but the salad was amazing!! I love dressing and the garbanzo beans in the salad. Not something thats normally in a house salad but enjoyable. By this time I was already stuffed. I still had my lasagna to look forward to and was already leaning back in satisfaction. When our food came, I was surprised to see the large portions. We had already filled up on bread, salad, and soup, and I was not sure how we would finish our entrees. Even my friend who finished the pho challenge went home with leftovers.  I would defiantly go back to Capps in the future. I'm willing to overlook the parking situation in North Beach to fill up on the fantastic food at a fantastic price!! The bill for three of us including drinks was $81...I heard that its just as good for lunch for almost half the price.",

    "review_text": "Yeah...so the night started out like any other. Pondering where to go for italian food, me and two of my friends settled on Capp's, knowing little about it. We were delighted by the soup and salad course but the bowls that they were served in--ew! They were scratched up stainless steel mxing bowls. Anyway, so we ordered our entrees and then a forth friend was going to join us. When she did, we made the decision to share our three entrees with her, but they would not allow it. They wanted to charge her $12 for \"soup and salad\". \u00a0So we obliged and actually ordered another entree. \u00a0When the food came it was really nothing spectacular. I had the veal picatta and it was tough and the sauce had an off flavor. But, they hooked us up with dessert which scored them some points. \u00a0As we were enjoying dessert, I felt a small metal object in my mouth. Tainted food, you wonder? No actually my tongue ring had become undone. When I went to the bathroom to re-enstall it, it fell out of my mouth and into the drain. You should have seen the look on the bar tenders face when I asked him for a pipe wrench.",
