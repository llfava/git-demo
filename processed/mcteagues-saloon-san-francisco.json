If they manage to stay in business for a decade or so it will eventually acquire the authentic patina of grime it deserves.  I was on my way to another bar when I walked past this place, popped my head in and asked the bartender if they allowed dogs. While the bartender was telling me that dogs are OK I noticed David Allen Coe was playing on the jukebox. SCORE!  \"Hey Katie, call Gwynnie and tell her there's been a change of plans. I'll be back with Matilda.\"  So now I have my best girl (Katie) and my best drinking buddy (Matilda) in a bar that plays twang bangin country music and waiting for some good friends to show up. What's that, they have Shiner Bock on tap? I haven't had a Shiner in about 20 years and now that I've got that out of my system I can wait another 20. Racer 5 on tap? Oh hell yeah!  When I settled up my tab it was an embarrassingly \u00a0small amount.  YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE LAST OF ME!!!",

The rustic interior has so much western influence that screams like a first generation Chinese born in Walnut Creek: Am I White or am I Chinese?! I'm so confused!

Upon walking into McTeague's, I found a very spacious spot with comfortable surroundings. \u00a0The place is Irish &amp; Texas-themed, as one owner is Irish and the other is Texan. \u00a0I got to chat with Chris (the Texan owner) and found out he wanted the bar to be a home for us Texas Exes. \u00a0The bar had a lot going for it: Texas decor in the back room, Shiner Bock and Shiner Black on tap, and 2 smokers to cook up some BBQ.  We decided to hold our Christmas party at the bar to test it out. \u00a0Chris cooked up BBQ for our group that was pretty tasty... and yes, it was really Texas-style BBQ, not that crap California-style stuff. \u00a0Everyone who attended liked the space, the food, and the drinks. \u00a0There was a decent crowd, but there was plenty of room to walk around and mingle, unlike in Blue Light where you get packed in like sardines and struggle to get a drink.  Overall, I love the spot and plan on having future Texas Exes events there. \u00a0It's also in a nice up-and-coming area on Lower Polk. \u00a0Chris is laid-back and really easy to work with. \u00a0I also hear they do free BBQ on college football game days. \u00a0Next year, they are planning on adding another couple of TVs during football season.

    "review_text": "You may be asking yourself so why oh why did they need to open up another bar on Polk Street? Well there are many reasons but I can give you 2 good ones--a) Polk has the highest concentration of bars on a city street in San Francisco and it has to maintain its title and b) as a general observation (myself living in this area on and off over the last few years) I've noticed that Polkers--regardless of age, lifestyle choices, gender, income racket, you name it--seem to take a liking both alcohol and gatherings.Over opening weekend I saw many Polk regulars from all walks of life come into get a feel of the \"new family member\". Judging from everyone's reactions I can assume that it will be a welcome addition to the already active nightlife.    The bar's namesake and itself is a nod to a character from Frank Norris' McTeague and to an era of San Francisco history almost forgotten (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthrillist.com&amp;s=744c19b1c026b065764073b34121ce312ab9b422be6a5c725b12bc2046f3ea0e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">thrillist.com</a> has more on the history of its origins both the novel and the building itself). Thoughtful decorations like the lamps, a wagon wheel on the ceiling, the high dark wood booths with thick lacquered tables and a long bar with plenty of libations quickly add to the gathering spot aura this place has already acquired. This place makes the most of its length and can definitely accommodate more than a few healthy sized clans. There is a pool table in the back (with some plush seating there as well) and apparently they plan on hosting music there at some point. For now there is a jukebox with a picture of Marilyn Monroe resting upon it. Staff members I met seemed in the custom Polk fashion of being cordial if not down right friendly. \u00a0 \u00a0  The selection at the bar is a healthy one. I counted at least 20+ beer taps (with minimal repeats). Popular local favorites like Anchor Steam and Prohibition Ale were amongst those present and the LARGE display of liquor set along glass shelves, against stone brick work, led me to believe that they can cover more than just the basics. Someone mentioned something about a menu but I didn't see one. Regardless of that one quibble I can say that this place has a lot to offer. Go while it still has that new bar smell to it.  2 more quick things: they open at noon (earlier than most of the bars in the immediate area) and during the week Happy Hour is from 12-7. ($3 drafts,$3 wells seems to be special). Plus Friday afternoons around 4 or 5 have an extra bonus, free food. Last week's nibbles were smoked spicy chicken drumsticks and they were as big and good as you'd expect at a friend's BBQ. Yummy!",

Stopped in after a few drinks at Hemlock, because McTeague's happens to be one of our friends FAVORITE places ever. \u00a0The place was packed, the mood and atmosphere was alright, but I'm gonna go ahead and say I wasn't drunk enough to really enjoy myself here.  The drinks weren't too bad, decent beers on tap, and not too expensive. \u00a0The wait at the bar was a little longer than I would have liked, but understandable. \u00a0No soap in the girls bathroom left me cringing every time I walked out and back to the bar, and yes the jukebox that night played Tik-Tok three times in less than an hour. \u00a0WHO DOES THAT",

Plus, there is often plenty of seating, a lively, young crowd and cups and dice for your occasional drinking game. Overall, McTeague's is a great place to spend a Friday or Saturday night if you're looking for something fun and not too crazy.  The only -1? McTeague's gets very crowded at around 11:30 on weekends, so either come early or come prepared to feel a tad claustrophobic.",

Like best friends do, they are willing to back you up when the time comes.  By nature I'm a very relaxed guy. I like to watch football here for 6 hours and chat it up all Sunday long. A few weeks back though, I came as close to knocking out some teeth as I have in a very long time. A drunk, mouthy individual would not shut up. He just wouldn't, and he was directing his booze soaked ire to the left side of my face. For about 30 minutes.  The observant bartenders warned him. They told him he was pissing people off and needed to have a nice glass of shut the hell up. But would he listen? Nawwwwww, he was drunk. You know how that goes.  The bartenders who know me, know my demeanor, could smell something was wrong. The comments after the fact were that they'd never seen Justin like that before. I was ready to rip his head off. Perhaps me smacking his hand out of my vicinity and yelling point blank two inches from his face to shut the fuck up gave me away. I'm not positive.  Before I snapped and caught me an assault charge they 86ed him and sent his ass packing. That's good business right there, they recognized me as a regular and a fairly happy one at that. To evaluate and say hey, we know this guy and he's not like this. Something is amiss, we need to fix it. Well played, if it wasn't me that douche would have been pissing off another patron, I guarantee it.  I calmed down about 10 minutes after he bounced. We had a shot and laughed it off. I tried to buy but they were having none of it. I explained the sitch to maybe 10 bar goers who approached me and said \"Dude... you were super pissed..... what did he do?\" Luckily it went no further, McTeague's had my back and vicariously that means if you're a good customer who doesn't start shit, they'll back you up too.  I really appreciated that. Some bars will ignore and let the dust settle as it will. They treated me, a frequent visitor, with respect and remedied the situation before that asshole made me remedy it myself. I like McTeague's, and I like knowing that they care enough to take care of decent customers. I can honestly say I feel like they're my friends and I look forward to seeing their faces every time I roll through.   Much love Amber and Rick, much love. I'm sure Mr. asshole thanks you too, he got to keep his teeth.",

There was quite an eclectic mix of people which I always see as a good sign because usually that means its a bar that makes everyone feel comfortable, which it does. Ive been back since with friends to play pool at night and it was a consistently comfortable bar with good beers, friendly bartenders, sports and all the things required of a good local spot. Here's where I must rave about this place. The first day I came in famished from having not eaten all day. Scribbled on a piece of paper taped to the cash register was a sign saying \"$5 chicken tacos\". Then I see a man in the corner with a set up that looked like he brought everything from his kitchen. (Which now I would gladly welcome any day) I wasn't too sure this was going to turn out well cause I can be a bit of a food snob. Anyway best effin tacos ever! I've dreamt about theses things several nights since! The kind gentlemen even made ours after he had already quit for the day. So if you get a chance, they're a must!",

Came here after dinner with some friends as soon as the 49ers had clinched the playoffs. I really, really wanted to like McTeague's but the crowd totally turned me off.   Here's what McTeague's has going for it:  1) The price is right! For $16 we got two vodka soda's and a beer (maybe 2 beers- I didn't pay, so I'm not totally sure.)   2) I LOVE the layout! This place looks like it should be a ton of fun! The funky colored floor in the back is straight out of a Michael Jackson music video (though on a much, much smaller scale.)  3) Your bouncers are awesome. (Not as awesome as the bouncer at the Latin America Club- he's still my favorite) Totally friendly dudes.  Here's what scares me about McTeague's:  Now that I'm in the Tender-Nob, Lower-Nob, Whatever, the crowd is looking seedy. Fights are breaking out and I feel like a minnow surrounded by sharks. My friend and I started feeling a bit unsafe and left.",

We tried the Nachos but I wouldn't do it again unless I was really hungry.

We were enjoying our drinks and conversation when some guys came out of no where and started talking to us. We were polite but uninterested in their advances. At some point one of the guys drank my shot. As he started to walk away I asked him if he was going to pay for that and he finally left $5. My friend and I were completely shocked and of course we told the bartender and we asked him if he could replace the shot. Instead he got extremely angry with us and told us we had an attitude and that we had to leave. We tried to explain the situation several times and each time he refused to listen and walked away. It finally errupted into a full blown confrontation of me throwing my glass of water in his face, throwing my shot glass at him and knocking the glasses off the bar. I've never been so angry. All he needed to do was listen. I never use the race card, but if I were going to use it at any time this would be the time. He assumed that we were going to have an attitude and that we weren't going to tip so they didn't feel the need to give us proper custormer service. Worst bar experience of my life.",

McTeague is the title of a novel written by Frank Norris around 1899 about an eponymous dentist who opens a dental office on Polk St. in San Francisco. \u00a0I talked to one of the Litquake volunteers and he said the place wasn't chosen for its name but for its size.   This is a pretty sizable bar. \u00a0You wouldn't think so from the outside but it is inside. The main bar counter is long and there are booths and bar stools across from the bar. Plenty of seating for those who want to sit. Beyond the bar is another room in the back with a smaller bar, several more booths and more bar stools and big barrels as tables.   There are weird stuff on the wall as well as ceiling. There is a huge sign by the women's restroom warning people of phone thefts. \u00a0This place was crowded the night we came, as people were watching the Giants game. I can't speak about their cocktails because we just had beer here. \u00a0They have a lot of TVs, so it's a good place to watch sports. We saw people bring in food purchased outside the premises to have with their beer too. Not a bad place to get together with other Giants fans to watch the game and for nerds like us to compete in a literary quiz!",

I've also been there at 8:30 on a random Monday night, and even though it was almost empty, but to me, it's more enjoyable during the off-peak hours, because you really get to enjoy the atmosphere of the bar, and see then I start to understand why it's called McTeague (after the book) because of the nice wood decor and saloon vibe.

When we got there there, was a small line but we got to the front in \u00a0a minute or two, and were looking forward to a fun night at a local bar. That was until I was confronted by the most rude, unprofessional, and disgusting bouncer I've encountered in my life.   The bouncer asked me for my ID, glanced at it for a second, and proceeded to tell me it was fake - mind you I'm 25. I legitimately thought he was joking with me so I said \"you're joking right\".. for some reason, that one really ticked him off. He came right up to my face (to the point where I could smell the alcohol on his breath, which is an entirely different problem), and told me to get the F*** out of his doorway.   When I told him to take another look because I'm 25 and my ID is real, he grabbed me by the arm, threw me to the ground and told me he was going to step on me if I didn't leave the premises! \u00a0I don't care if this guys job is to bounce the door - \u00a0he has absolutely no right to physically throw a girl on the floor!  Neither I nor my friends are EVER going back to McTeague's saloon... no one else should either until they:  1. Teach their bouncers how to do their job and properly read ID's 2. Understand that it's against the law to have their bouncers drinking on the job 3. Fire the disgusting bouncer who thinks it's ok to physically abuse a potential patron for no reason  There are plenty of other great bars on polk with respectful staff, and really anything is better than McTeague's Saloon",

I fell in love with the book and when I walked past this bar I thought \"I MUST GO HERE!!!!  It's a lot bigger inside that I thought. Plenty of seating is always good! There was also an electronic juke box which made me a happy girl. They don't really specialize in fancy cocktails, so don't try to order one. My dumb ass asked the bar tender to make me something creative with vodka and she said \"Um, we're pretty much a beer and whiskey kind of bar.\" And my boyfriend made the \"haha, my girlfriend is kind of a ding bat\" laugh. Oopsie. The bartender was a good sport and made me a cocktail that was pretty good.   For our second round, our bartender was this dude with a voice like Macho Man Randy Savage. He was freakin awesome. I asked him if he had read the book, \"McTeague,\" and he said he tried but someone stole the book from the bar. I plan on going back and giving him a copy. Anyways, he made me a strong drink and I liked him. He was nice, even though he looked like he could kick my ass.  So yeah, McTeague's was cool. I would probably go here with my beer drinking friends and not my vodka drinking friends though.",

Now, during the night time setting, just jam like God knows how many, yuppies, douches, and jobbers into that same lack-luster bar setting, and what you have is what we affectionately refer to back East as a \"Hot Mess\".  I don't require much from a bar. And yes, there were more than a few pretty girls there, but good luck trying to holla at them. It's was too jam-packed to even get to the bar, let alone stalk some pray. No sir, these are not the hunting grounds you're looking for.   I don't know what my friends thought of the joint. They were three sheets to the wind, with their beer goggles strapped on tight. I'll be surprised if they remember even being there. I know that bars in SF tend to be a touch crowded and overpriced, but honestly, you can do a lot better that McTeague's. xD",

I've been here before a couple times and service was fine, but my latest experience really pissed me off.  I ordered a simple well drink. The bar tender told me the price ($7) and then I handed him my credit card. He told me the minimum was $15. I told him, I understand, but I would like to open a tab and in case I do not go over the minimum, I will pay cash. He took my card, whispered something to his fellow bar tender and then began helping other patrons.  After finishing the drink, I was trying to order a 2nd. The same bar tender was directly in front of me and I asked him for another. He appeared to nod his head as if he acknowledged the order but then walked off. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed he didn't see/hear me. The other bar tender was walking around on my side of the bar and taking orders. She took orders of everyone around me first, then stopped at me, asked me what I wanted, then walked away to the other side of the bar. This time, I knew I ordered a drink and was being ignored. Please keep in mind that the place was NOT crowded.   Finally, the original bar tender was back and it took me at least 4-5 attempts to get his attention, after he again helped everyone else around me. Finally, I said that I want to close out and that I will pay cash. When closing out, I asked him for an additional drink and asked for the total. He then said that the total was $15. I told him that I disagreed with the price change but he wouldn't budge. So, I told him, \"Thank You, I don't want the drink anymore\", paid cash for the 1st drink, took my CC and then immediately left the establishment.   Additionally, I do not know if it had any influence on how I was treated, but I was the only colored person (along with my gf). I can't help but feel that I was discriminated against since everyone around me was being helped.  Today, I found out that he swiped my card and charged me amount for the drink even though I paid cash that night. I never signed anything or authorized the transaction. I called the bank and they are issuing me a refund. However, the bartender took my cash and the CC transaction still gets counted toward their books. The bartender prob pocketed the cash, giving him a $7 tip for being a terrible bar tender.  Takeaways: 1. \u00a0Very poor service/pay little attention to customers 2. \u00a0No consistency in pricing. 3. \u00a0Use a credit card in case you have to deal with this BS. 4. Judging from my experience and some of the other reviews that I read here, they do not welcome diversity.",

Why did I wait this long to write this review? Well because last night I went again and remembered why it is my favorite bar. First, I asked them to change one of the tv's to a volleyball game I wanted to and they did right away without giving me a hard time.  Then, it was my friends birthday and they made sure to help us order a specialty shot for her to enjoy.  We were there earlier (7-9) and it was easy for us to enjoy be around the tv and for us to enjoy watching the game.  Although late night (10:30-11PM) the place will start to get really crowded and is not really my scene (I enjoy chill places where you can sit and enjoy beer and whisky). Overall this is a great place to be anytime during the day/for watching a game. Or if you want a fun packed night.",

The cool waitress who rips shots with customers didn't even ask us if we were being waited on--not a shocker. \u00a0When I asked the bartender if it's normal that the staff drinks on the job he responded \"yes\". \u00a0That's good to know?

There are multiple HD-TV's and the bar tender was very accommodating and gladly changed the games on each TV based on what people wanted to see.   The reason this place is getting 5 stars is because of Jesus' BBQ! McTeague's offers donation-based BBQ prepared by Jesus (their chef) that is simply delicious! Be sure to tip to Jesus!

Keep 'em comin!!!   Most of the bartenders were extremely nice and generous, except for one girl who had an attitude towards a couple of my friends over a small misunderstanding about the drinks. I didn't get her name, but she was obviously giving my friends the stank eye from the other side of the bar. The bartenders in the back of the bar were nice and we got drinks there instead. We'd rather have our money and our tip go to people who deserve it :)  Overall, we liked this place! Huge bar area &amp; there are plenty of tables on the other side.

Bartenders are awesome, and one of my favorites works here! :) Security is nice and they recognize you and your group if you come here as often as I do. One night we even skipped the line, but it could either be that (1) they remembered us, (2) we're girls, (3) we were already drunk, or (4) we were loud and annoying and they needed those people. Either way it was awesome. The crowd is great, it's a mixed younger generation crowd. Love the Polk area itself because you can barhop and it's the disneyland for 21 year olds. Around 11:00PM there is ALWAYS a line to get in and there's a good ratio of girls to guys (okay, maybe more guys to girls but I'm not complaining here, either). There's a bar area in the front with standing tables on the sides and a few booths, then a mini-dance floor in the back with a mini bar and a back area with booths. Okay for dancing, but I would suggest Vertigo for dancing instead. Overall, great location, great people, bartenders, bouncers and place. Woo!

It may be that I hover in the back near the pool table, and feel genuine joy when someone finally picks a good song on the juke box. Or, it may be that if you are easy to please, this is the bar for you. Lots of good beer to choose from, and even if you have to wait a second, the bartenders are normally pretty nice and make up for it.  I also like that the mix of people here is generally different, and most people are willing to get a little chatty over a game of pool. It makes it feel fun, without the awkward one-pool-table-competitiveness-vibe overwhelming everything. This bar is hard to peg...you can't really pin down the crowd with a generic catch-all, but that makes it pretty easy for you to blend in and have a good time with the people you came with.",

It has a good ratio of men: women, only I saw way more women this time. As you walk in, it looks like your typical saloon, no you will not see fur trappers, cowboys, soldiers, gold prospectors, miners, \u00a0gamblers, or rango. You will see people actually pretty dressed up for this place.  It's always full to where you bump into everyone, and hard to get to the bar area to order a drink. There are booths on the sides and has the western feel to it. There is a separate room in the back with another bar and you have to walk though a mini hallway where guys usually stand against the wall like hawks to see all the women pass by or the occasional couple who I just want to tell them, Dear couple intensely making out in my way, get a room, tsk, tsk. If you look closely at in the back there are more hidden booths.   I always have a good time here, theres only a juke box, which is good, but if you want more upbeat it's not the place to go for dancing. The prices are reasonable, last time I bought my friend a beer and I had a vodka tonic and it came out to be $10. So we proceeded with shot, shots, shots, shots and started to speak in another language, loudly, and that's when we knew we had too many. The drinks here are a million times better than at Mayes next door and there is no cover.   I met the owner the other day and asked him why they do last call at 1:15am, and he says because it is too full and the cops pass by. Everyone was kicked out by 1:45am, uber lame. Rewind, 30 min before, there was this douche who had a champagne bottle and starting dancing champagne showers and got all of us soaked. Thank you big and scary bouncers for kicking him out, much appreciated!",

I have not moved on from getting blind drunk and getting incomparably excited by the sound of listening to the backstreet boys.  This place is usually a good time, it depends on the crowd, how drunk you are, and if they oblige and play enough spice girls and backstreet boys.  Sometimes you have to wait a while to get served, which is entirely for the best in the long run because they pour strong drinks here. I go from basic drunk bitch to cerebral palsy from roughly half of a gin and tonic here. Also, as this place gets packed toward end of night, you can assume everyone else here is also on their last, drunken leg as well.  It's definitely a younger scene, which can make you feel as though you are:  a) a cougar \u00a0 and/or  b) an old desperate ho.  There is also one more option:  c) get so blind drunk that age becomes irrelevant.   I often go for choice C before making out with a random 23 year old. It's pretty promising, good way to find future husbands, ladies.  Overall, it's a good place to end the night on Polk, always funny, always full of characters... Just need to find some more men here who are a bit further away from completing puberty.  Cheers mcteagues, see ya again this weekend.

Part Irish pub, part west coast \"Saloon,\" it is a drinking sanctuary that accommodates all occasions and all crowds. Judging by the lines and how consistently packed it is nightly, it is by far one of the area's most popular bars.  Plenty on tap and drink specials for days, libations just never seem to end here. From the obligatory Guinness on tap to the Shiner Dark as well as cocktail deals, no one can or should go thirsty. I myself prefer a strong whiskey on the rocks, which they have plenty to choose from.  There is free pool, live music on occasion, and when in season, lots of sports playing on all the various TVs. It's a great place for Giants / 49er games and even better during MLS matchups. There is a small selection of pub food and even complimentary BBQ during weekend games.  When the crowds come and the ventilation suffers, that's when I'm out of here. Saturday nights around midnight can be a cluster of dbaggery, but then again, what place on Polk isn't inundated?",

In the main area they have a step up to a row of booths. They have a bannister along the step, 3 feet from the booths. If you sit down here, when its crowded, you will shortly have people standing immediately next to you doing an awkward butt shake at face level. Forget about trying to maneuver your way back to the bar, you have to navigate the shoulder-to-shoulder people and the bizarrely placed \u00a0and oddly long bannister.

However, It's a lot different at night on the weekends. The bar is packed on the weekends with twenty and thirty year olds that have not left their college days too far behind them. They are either working and would love nothing more than to spend their money on alcohol or they are unemployed and would love nothing more than alcohol. The lines can get a little long here, but its usually not too bad. There tables in the front, booths in the back, and some drink tables in the middle. No cover. Drink prices are average.  On another note, I came here once with my good friend, the black out queen. She has somewhat recently retired that crown, but she occasionally shows glimpses of her glory days. Today was one of those days and we could not be happier. At some point during the night she decided that paying for alcohol at a bar just doesn't really make sense. So, she got herself a beer glass, reached over the bar, and poured herself a glass from the tap. We paused...looked at her...and rejoiced in sweet, sweet victory. Somehow, she skated by on that one and I've never had a more satisfying beer. And I think at this point, my black out friend believed this was how bars worked now. So, she casually went back for more and she should not have. The bartender went off on her. We stood huddled together like little school children being scolded. Our eyes scanned the floor as if we were going to find our lost dignity down there. But, we didn't get kicked out. So, another plus because of cool bartenders!  Another bar that my black out friend did not get kicked out of.",

Said she'd get him to call and verify with me. Thursday rolled around and I didn't get a call and totally forgot. Friday morning I called back to make sure I'll have the booths - I was expecting about 12 people and figured most would like somewhere to sit. Same woman on the phone, remembered me, said the boss \"hasn't come back yet\" but still didn't think it'd be a problem. Ok fine, no biggie.   Saturday night! Dinner at 21st Amendment then on to McTeague's. It's my birthday, I'm ready for some birthday drinkie and good times with friends. Part of my group and I walk in around 9p (the time we reserved the booths for) and I notice every booth have people sitting in 'em. Two booths were reserved for someone else. Well this sucks. I let a bartender know whats up and he gets the boss-man. Boss comes up to me and is totally nice and understanding, I let him know of my phone calls.. etc. He gets us temporary seats and lets us know people he knows are in some of the booths and we'll get the booths when they leave (\"they were planning to leave soon\" he says) and then gets my friends and I a free round of drinks. He was very nice about it all and I have no qualms about it. By the time the rest of my group showed up we had at least one booth and tall table and a short time after that the second booth opened up.  Overall the experience was great. My friends who haven't been here before all enjoyed it and thought it was a pretty chill place. Will keep this place on my \"the list\" and return again!",

They also have a cool set of paintings that show dead people standing above coffins on the ceiling such as Kurt Kobain, Jimmy Hendrix etc.. so look up next time you are there!",

You literally can't move through the bar without brushing against someone. It gets so stuffy and gross.  However, it's not the worst bar ever. They play decent music, but no one ever dances haha. Probably because there really is no room to despite the large area. At least the drinks are cheap!",

There is something about costumes that makes the male species bolder....but not brighter.   I had a string of awesome conversations here. And by awesome I mean awkward, creepy, and a little perverted.   One gentlemen told me and my cheerfully-buzzed gal pal that he's with child....going into a detailed account of how he was given a uterus and has been artificially inseminated. I vaguely recall this being the plot of a bad 90's comedy...  The next gentlemen tried his hand with an insult, telling us over the loud music, \"You girls look like perverts!!\" Oh, really? His friend then told us that we should stroke his balls. No, thanks.   Then there was a very sweet man with a Pirate costume on, oh no that's not a costume? My bad. He told my (now beyond buzzed) pal that he once dressed up as a woman in college and was appalled by the way that men treated him in bars, and that he now has an increased respect for women. To you pirate lady-man: try bein' a lady in this bar!  Maybe its the throngs of has-been greeks who need to get their fix of the drunken antics among the 20 something crowd, or the girls who like to be fondled by strange men who gaze into your eyes as they walk through the crowd. To each his own!   McTeague's gets 4 stars for entertainment on Halloween, but my college days were well lived, and I don't think this is the bar for me.",

They had the American Outlaws there and hosted a bunch of people who emptied out a few of the beverages on tap.  The bartenders: Very witty. If you can't take sarcasm or aren't able to throw it right back...brace yourself if you decide to say something dumb. They keep the ball rolling and do a great job of getting beverages out quickly. &amp; when they're out of something know what you want as a back up. They do a really good job of making sure you get something to drink!  The beverages: At night they made me a bullet Manhattan on the rocks &amp; they made it mighty fine. At 9:00 in the morning I was served a delicious tequila sunrise. I will say it didn't feel right ordering a tequila sunrise there but I also didn't want to order an OJ. Pick your poison. Oh the noon time whiskey sour is delicious too! That's not a new drink. It's just a whiskey sour at 12:00. Still delicious.  The bar: Got prime seats at the end of the bar close to the door for the USA game. Also got prime seats at a booth in the evening. They've got great seating no matter what you're looking for. It's not overly decorated which is great because no one wants to be assaulted visually by cheap themed decor. I will say look up at the ceiling. They've got a few pieces of art work that's pretty cool &amp; there may be a chance for you to get educated on premier league teams.  The grub: Bring your own. There is a bunch of places you can take out from and they encourage it too. But don't be a Dirty D and leave your junk all over the place. If you ask nicely the staff will dispose of it for you if you can't find a trash can yourself.   Note: It's a Saloon. Don't expect table service or to get a novelty \"scorpion bowl\" with a plethora of fruit. You'll upset the regulars and the bartenders. And no one will feel bad if they kick you out.

If you are hungry, there are a ton of great little restaurants next door and across the street and you can bring your grub in to McTeagues. \u00a0We are big fans of getting hot fresh nachos across the street at El Super Burrito and bringing them in to munch on while drinking a PBR.",

I have to say I was not a Texas fan until after I hung out at McTeague's. That place is the place to go if you are a Texas fan. I believe the owner went to Texas. Any the place is decked out in Texas gear, as well as items that make me think of the west. It is definitely the traditional kind of bar. It is definitely spacious and really cool.   The beer selection is pretty decent. I was happy they had blue moon on tap, and that seemed to suffice. Their prices are reasonable. There really wasn't a crowd there, but I hear it can get busy on the weekends. Definitely a place I would come back to, to catch a football game or a hockey game.",

Management took no responsibility and said it was a common occurrence every weekend - personally, there are much better bars to go to where this sort of thing doesn't happen.",

It STILL smelled awful! There's this sour smell right as you walk in, it wasn't even crowded last night. Makes me think this smell never goes away..  For somebody who has a sensitive nose, I can't deal. There must be other places that don't smell so disgusting upon entry. =/",

I don't know a lot about the history, but I know it dates back to the olden days of the 1800's. \u00a0I can only imagine Polk Gulch at that point. \u00a0It's diverse and rough-and-tumble now, but to think of dirt streets and a whole continent between you and The East (and no airplanes)... \u00a0I think this place helps us retain some of our Old School Awesomeness.",

There seems to be some noticeable favoring there tho...I ordered the same drink as my friend...and, although I didn't mind AT ALL, there was like 5 times the vodka in mine than hers.  Juke Box was filled with oldies and goodies...no real top 40 madness which is nice and refreshing when you know just one block away you can get your top 40 groove on at Veritgo.

Got a vodka cran and it was $5 and tasted like cranberry juice. Eek! I asked the bartender (a guy whose name I forget but who was rad regardless) if he could spruce it up a bit, which he did gladly. In fact, after a few more sips, I had to request more juice to even it out.   My friend left his glasses here on accident, and when we called, they found them and set them aside. What great people!
