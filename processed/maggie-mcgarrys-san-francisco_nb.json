I liked the openness, with two different areas (and bars) and would imagine it's also a good place to come even when it's busy.  The bartender was an awesome guy. We ordered Irish Car Bombs, and didn't get the stink eye from him (which alot of bartenders will give you.....it's the \"oh, this idiot wants to chug chocolate milk\" look; which is understandable). One of our guys actually broke the shot glass (rookie) and cool bartender guy didn't get upset. Good guy all around  Only complaint would be pricing - seems a little high ($9 each for the bombs), but it's SF and rent is high you guys.

They both played great 80's music and had the crowd dancing the night away.  The dance floor is big enough and the crowd is usually great. I don't generally drink so I'm not sure about the cost of the drinks at this bar, but the first time I was there was my birthday. So my friends kept buying me drinks and I learned later that they were really expensive. So that is a definite downside.

Lots of beers on tap and a good selection of alcohol. \u00a0No food options - or at least I didn't see any.  Crowd was a mix of 20-30 somethings. \u00a0Good people watching and the 80's music kept me around while I enbibed with several beers.  Overall a fun place to go enjoy a brew and some 80's tunes.",

They have a good sized dance floor in front of the stage area which was full the entire night.   My biggest problem with this place were the drinks. I ordered two long islands ($12 each) for myself and a friend and both of them were incredibly weak. There is only one reason to order a Long Island, to get drunk, Maggie McGarry's seems to have missed that memo. The girl bartender at the cash bar was rude and slow even though the cash bar wasn't very busy.  The place was busy, but not it wasn't crowded to the point you couldn't move around inside. The main bar was packed the entire time and getting a drink took forever. There wasn't any wait to get in and they didn't charge cover at the time we got there (around 11).",

They not only sang the current hits (like Katy Perry's Teenage Dream), but they also sang oldies like Bon Jovi's Living on a Prayer! They were just kinda.. rude/obnoxious flirty. Saw them grab something out of a girl's hand and throw it onto the stage, and then refuse to return it to her. Uhhh.

For example, when I walk into a place, I like to be the only excessively tall blonde (ETB). It's my niche and should there be a guy who likes ETBs, I fit the bill and I serve my purpose.   It's an interesting situation when another ETB shows up. In my head, I imagine it playing out like this: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSWhhPWyWCv0&amp;s=653de2074f39597180508590b94467eb20eabadf5a604a7902d9663ae7a584ca\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com/watch?v=SWhh\u2026</a>, but in reality I casually walk by her and decide whether or not I am a) taller or b) blonder. This exact scenario acted itself out at Maggie McGarry's Saturday night but I proved victorious when I realized my adversary was a) wearing heels and b) a bottle blonde. Win!  Even if I had lost this competition (which rarely happens because I'm the human equivalent of Gigantor), I'd still think this place was pretty rad. The live band rocked, and I can't help but dance when I hear a great cover of \"White Wedding\" shaking the walls of the bar. For $15+tip I got three strong vodka redbulls, and they were served quickly by a chick with an enviable Irish accent.   This was also the bar where last fall my female roommate realized that not all girls are born with brown nipples and that pink nipples do exist. Five stars for quality music, tasty drinks, a lack of comparable ETBs, and being a great place to learn about anatomical variance in the female gender.",

Walked over after having dinner in North Beach and it was pretty busy. We pushed through the crowd to get to the bar, got our first round and made way to the next room over.  We were hangin' out and drinking and talking when all of a sudden... the freakin' wall opened!! I had no idea what was going on until I spotted the band. Unbelievable! The band wasn't bad. I have no idea what their name was otherwise I'd give them their Yelp dues... cover band that did a lot of Nugent and CCR... anyway.  Young crowd, good drinks, awesome wall openingness. All pluses in my book!   If there's one knock on this place, it's the fact that there's a bottleneck of people as soon as you walk in because of the placement on the bar. Not a huge deal though.",

Totally unexpected for my first visit, and the live music was awesome. When I arrived here recently during the North Beach beer run, the bartenders were still in good spirits even towards the end with dozens of drunken people yelling. That says everything for me.  This place is also fun and relaxing to watch football (American and non-American) during a lazy weekend. Overall, Maggie McGarry's is chill and a refreshing break from tourist-ridden Columbus Street.   Check it out.",

I couldn't talk to anyone in here, it was packed, and i continually felt like I was being stared at (not in a gay bar kind of way either). Glad I had one overpriced Bud here and got out and never will return. Unless said cover band plays some Guns N Roses or Lynrd Skynrd's Simple Man...because then, maybe I'll make an exception.",

    "review_text": "I always debate with myself whether to ever give a poor review. I'm a big fan of supporting local business, but then again, the whole point of yelp is to provide honest opinions about establishments, and the real duty is to the reader, not the establishment.  I went with some friends to Maggie McGarry's after seeing an ad for it on facebook on a Wednesday night to see KJ Paul for the first time. Given that North Beach has few Karaoke options, I wanted to support keeping these events alive with fun people, buying lots of drinks, and tipping like there's no tomorrow to show our appreciation. KJ Paul has some association with Glenny Kravitz, one of the best KJ's in the city  (Tuesday nights at Amnesia is the bomb!), and so, that was enough for me.  When we got there, the place was absolutely dead, everyone being next door at Grant and Green where things were hopping. (we were there as well, but wanted to do some karaoke after seeing some great live music, though given how dead it was, it took some convincing to get my friends inside)  Slowly things got going, and everyone was having a great time, with some awesome BEP, \u00a0and some cheesy karaoke antics (dancing, sing-a-long, cheering, etc). People started coming into the bar, to join the fun. But, all of a sudden no one was being called. We figured the KJ went to the restroom or something, and then after about 5 depressing songs, everyone in the bar was like WTF?  Someone said some people were being too rowdy. I didn't see it, but it would be nice to exit those people, and keep things going like any normal place would do. Why the collective punishment?  Then the explanation was that it's in the KJ's contract to take 20 minute breaks. I've gone to nearly every Karaoke place in the city, and never have I seen a KJ take a 20 minute break. Glenny doesn't do it, Purple at Jacks doesn't do it, Encore doesn't do it, The Mint doesn't do it, Festa doesn't do it, no one. No one bought it. One is that it was over 20 minutes, and two, it was obvious from the discussions that it was just an excuse to make people leave. \u00a0Or if it was true, it's completely a lame policy.  My feeling is that it's better to talk to people and explain the problem. At Encore, for instance, they have house rules (no singing out of turn, no swinging the mic, etc. none of which I saw happen here), and they'll just tell people, and people will follow them, or be exited, no fuss no muss. The show must go on!   Several patrons tried to talk to KJ Paul and the bartender sincerely in order to save the evening, since no one really wanted to leave. But no dice. After the third depressing Sinatra song, various groups couldn't take it anymore. They got the message. The place emptied out completely. It was as dead again. Some wanted to stay, but it was clear the party was over and it was hard to understand why.  Really sad. I don't know if it was KJ Paul or the Owners.   Several people had put in multi-dollar tips after putting in their song, and left them. I saw lots of people tipping for drinks as well. That to me shows complete lack of appreciation.  In the area, the other option for Karaoke is Bow Bow, which has always been fun when I went, though a bit cramped. The other bars we had fun at included Romolo, Grant and Green. After Maggie's we went to Gino and Carlo where we had fun with the jukebox and pool. Those guys were cool.  Sorry, North Beach has no shortage of options, so I'll take my patronage where there's no collective punishment or other nonsense.  Maybe it was an off night, but it's hard to muster a desire to find out.",

There's live music a lot and it's always fun to dance to. There are 2 seperate bars so it's never a long wait for a drink. The've got some tables that we usually end up using as a crash pad for a rest after dancing. The crowd is hit or miss, but I think that's pretty typical with North Beach. There are sometimes great pep's here, locals etc. Othertimes the b&amp;t wanders up from broadway or you get a lot of tourists so I guess that's my only complaint. Overall, a very good place to go out on Grant compared to the surroundings.",

I'm a bit new to the bar scene (just started drinking when I turned 21 this year), but I'm a good enough judge of knowing when I'm having fun, and I was definitely having fun. You could tell who the regulars were, and I felt a bit young having been the only person to sing a song from the past two decades (Cee-Lo Green's \"F*ck You\"? I was all over that like jam on toast) but even with the people who had clearly had more than I did were having a good time.

Nothing takes me back to college like drinking beer and singing along to a live cover of \"Livin' on a Prayer\". (Not that normally get the urge to feel like I'm in college - but it is fun every now and then.)  HOWEVER, my last experience here was less than enjoyable. (Although, I was considerably less inebriated than my previous visits here). Almost immediately after arriving, I grabbed a beer from the bar, and although I saw the sign that said $15 minimum, I figured we would stay long enough to have more than one drink. After realizing how crowded, hot, and stuffy the place was, my friends and I decided to leave. I went to close out my tab, and the bartender told me my tab was at $5, but since there was a minimum she had to run my card for $15. Now, as a former employee of a credit card company, I know very well that Visa &amp; Mastercard both prohibit merchants from charging minimums... so I told that to the bartender. She insisted that she couldn't run it for less than $15. Not true. Not wanting to argue any more, I ordered two more beers and shared them with friends... ordinarily I am a generous tipper, but since she lied to me I left her nothing. I don't mean to be the credit card ethics police, but I've been in the same situation at other bars and they've broken their ethically-challenged policy for me.  In the future I'll drink at places that don't make me spend more than I want to.",

Strong Like Bull has noticed that you've been working out to get ready for Spring. You look incredible. You make Strong Like Bull... Strong. Like Bull. That's right. Go ahead and look at yourself in the mirror. We know you like what you see. Cuz baby... WE like what we see. Dirty Girl. Strong Like Bull wants to make you feel the way you make us feel.

Within walking 3 feet into the bar we ended up meeting a few cool guys, one of them my friend ended up making out with later on in the night. We got a drink right away and this time the bartender actually gave Tiffany Y. alcohol in her vodka cranberry.   This bar was off to a good start. Next thing we know, a Sublime song is blasting from the back of the bar. We walked towards it and behold a dance floor and a live band. The band played all kinds of great music, with legends like Sublime to Weezer, I mean the works. I was in music heaven.   Needless to say it was a great night. I will most definitely be back to this bar. Live music, good beers, awesome company, can't go wrong here!",

I really liked their clean, red brick ambiance and thought the bartender was very pleasant and attentive. Our rounds of drinks were on point and once in a while we would take a glance at the small TVs to catch all the scores and highlights. I really enjoyed the vibe and the crowd was mostly low key and pleasant.  The disappointing part of the evening was someone who had to be escorted due to severer intoxication while another person puked outside where the nasty stench started to linger into the bar. Despite having a lot of fun reconnecting with my friends those incidentals were our cues to leave. Too bad we weren't able to stick around to check out their live music but I thought we left at a good time. The place didn't make the best first impression but I would consider going back if I'm ever in area with friends.",

Wanted to hit a nice pub in North Beach and the only one nearby that came to mind for some reason was Grant &amp; Green. Would you believe it was padlocked at 1pm on a Saturday? Freezing and wet, we found Maggie McGarry's next door, open and bustling with people who had the same mo as us. It all came back to me now - I had been to this place at least a few times before, back when I was much younger and the North Beach bar scene was actually a scene, but I had never been here in the daylight or even half sober. \u00a0  Net/Net: While I can't remember if Maggie McGarry's is a fun bar after dark, this place is perfect if you want to throw back a few (many) pints with some friends on a Saturday afternoon-turned evening.   Pros:  - Atmosphere: Clean, bright pub with a long bar for plenty of seating. Not sure if it was the joy of escaping from the storm, but everyone (service and patrons alike), just seemed really happy to be there. Bathrooms were unusually clean, too! (true, it was still early). TVs to watch the games, a juke box, and an extra room for groups or probably live music in the evening.  - Service: Bartenders were awesome! Friendly and hilarious, quick service, great Irish accents if you like that sort of thing. \u00a0 - Location: Excellent spot on Grant in North Beach. Tons of restaurants and shops nearby.   Cons: Can't think of any! Will be returning to Maggie McGarry's soon.",

Said gentleman turned out to be the owner. I had told him it was my first time at Maggie McGarry's, so he ordered almost every item on the menu for me and I essentially was forced into drinking bottomless glasses of wine. And I was not complaining! This made me a very happy girl. SOOOO HAPPY that once my friends met up at The House, I opted to stay at Maggie McGarry's a little bit longer! Ok, a lot of \u00a0bit longer.  The kitchen manager was a doll, too. Great conversation. We teamed up to play trivia. The trivia wizard was also a sweetie-pie. They were all just so \u00a0very personable!  I eventually parted ways with my new three friends (hugs were given to all, of course) and I finally met up with the gals SUPER LATE to dinner... but I was totally fine, for I had already eaten dinner with \u00a0the Maggie McGarry's owner, kitchen manager, and trivia answer grand marshal!

Was surprised on how empty it was for a Sunday Football day...it's okay cuz more weiners for me.....",

The bartenders are super-duper fast and friendly! \u00a0This is a must for any pub-crawl in the area, big space is a plus! They show early morning soccer games, I'm not usually a morning person but its cool to have a place to go for the die-hard soccer fans. \u00a0An Irish bar with real Irish people, now we're talking! \u00a0The hot whiskeys are amazing and so are the Irish coffees. \u00a0I'll be back soon. \u00a0Karaoke on Wednesdays is always a great fun. \u00a0Don't tell anyone who blows to come here, I want it to stay cool.",
