I had my favorite hamburger sandwich for lunch; about a pound of delicious burger between two big pieces of sourdough bread, cut in half. Add your own fixings. If it was dinner time, I would have had the veal piccata. Love it. Drop by and give them a new send off. Oh, I forgot. They are now located where the Old San Remo restaurant used to be. \u00a0San Remo was one of my all time favorites as a kid. My parents brought me here all the time. Great place, great location, lot's of memories. The new location for Fior D'Italia works as both are real North Beach Icons. Trust me, you'll love the place, the food and the service.",

Steak was overcooked.  Pasta was dry.  No one came and checked on us so we didn't get the opportunity to inform them that the steak was well done and not medium.  i'm always willing to pay top dollar for great food but the service was horrible and i guess i shouldn't have been surprised by the amount of tourist there.",

This was my first time along with my family, however my wife's family has been here plenty of times before with good reviews. I called a week prior to make reservations with the manager and he insisted that we would be able to be seated in a \"somewhat\" excluded room that usually fits a party of 12. Once arriving to the restaurant the tables were set up in the middle of the restaurant and no one knew about the reservation for the side room. The employees stated that it would've been too small for our party of 11. I was thought to myself well why was it offered? To include non of us are on the hefty side. To make things easier I agreed and sat where the tables have been set up.   The next issue we had was that we ordered 3 different appetizers (1 of each) and they must've assumed that we wanted 3 of each. They kept saying \"we will take care of you.\" \u00a0The appetizers were WAY more than enough and went to waste where they just pulled it away and never asked if we wanted to save it. Afterwards I asked if the appetizers served were 1 or 3 servings of each, where they answered 3 and caused us to be dumbfounded since no one ordered 3 of each. \u00a0However I feel no one complained due to the fact that two different families were still trying to get to know each other. On a good note the Calamari in Cesta and Salmone in Carpione were excellent dishes, however the Gamberoni allo Spiedo in Pancetta was very salty where we had shrimp left over.   The last issue here was a miscommunication. We asked the newly young if we were able to have a couple wine glasses. He states \"we can take care of you\" so he wraps 4 glasses, and quickly puts them in a bag and I said \"thanks!\" He seemed busy so he went straight to the register while I gave him a \"bye\" wave and said thanks again while walking off (he said nothing nor tried to stop me). Half the party slowly exiting he hands a receipt to one of my in laws saying \"heres the receipt\" and in law replies \"thanks\" and starts walking off. The manger replies \"someone needs to pay for the glasses.\" Once again confused, the in law hands me the receipt and I pay for that after spending $600 for dinner which I thought was complimentary.   I do have to admit my chicken breast was cooked very well, however the in laws said the food was mediocre compared to before the new ownership and the menu is half of what it was before. Just my 2 cents.",

Having a burger at an Italian joint is probably some sort of crime and I'm just having to pay for my crime by having to eat a bad burger. My wife had the Monte Cristo and it sounds like it was slightly better (maybe three star). It was still a disappointment considering all the good Italian Restaurants in the area.

I had the seafood pasta special. \u00a0Lots of seafood (clams, mussels, shrimp, bay scallops), pasta done just right, and the cream sauce was perfect. \u00a0I also had the opportunity to try the black risotto and it was cooked perfectly..

We knew they had closed and re-opened with new owners so we were hopeful - however the first bummer was the plastic label from the soda gun for Root Beer that was floating in my daughter's soda and the second bummer was the big piece of thick clear plastic that was in the middle of her bolognese. Of course, they didn't charge us for the bolognese and offered dessert on the house which was very nice and we could tell that our server was trying his best. The kids ordered the cannoli and that was not good either - and that means it must have been really bad because my kids don't turn down dessert easily. So to sum it up, I'm sad to lose our tradition but in a town with many great Italian options I'm sure we can start a new one!",

Hilariously bad jokes were made, but the staff and patrons were all in on it for good natured fun.   We then got our table on the restaurant side. They let us choose from a window seat or booth. We loved we had the choice and opted for the booth.   There are fresh cut roses on every table. That was a nice touch.   Our waiter was super friendly and walked us through the different dishes and sauces as they have a bunch of appetizers and entrees I wasn't familiar with.   We got the roasted peppers with anchovy cream sauce, shared a mixed green salad, bf got lasagna and I had the beef bolognese pasta. It was all delicious and fresh.

This was my parties first time going here and the waiter definitely recommended that we get the thanksgiving dinner which was 50 dollars per person. Worst decision! Had a group of seven and we each paid around 87 dollars (tip included because we had 7 people but definitely did not deserve tip).   Food 1.5/5: The food consisted of a halibut cake appetizer, pumpkin ravioli, turkey, and pumpkin pie. From reading the menu and reviews, I expected a better menu or more choices. However, our waiter told us that this was the food to get.   The meal began with a big piece of bread. Who doesn't like bread? But the problem was they gave us a huge piece of bread and did not tend to our order until literally 45minutes later. By the time, I got my meal I was already half full from the bread. We asked our waiter on multiple occasions that we were ready to order. Around the 20minute mark we flagged him again but he said \"No, you finish your bread and I will come back later.\" Although it was taken as a joke and their were really short laughs, he literally left our table and didn't take our order. We felt that this was very rude when we were hungry. Finally, after flagging him down again, he took our orders.   The halibut cake was just a simple deep-fried fish dish. Nothing amazing, I rather order another appetizer than eat this. Very plain tasting.  Pumpkin Ravioli: oh wow, never ate something so horrible in my life. \u00a0Basically ravioli with pumpkin filling. The taste was horrible. I love pumpkin but this seriously did not suit my taste. Basically eating pumpkin pie but worst because its in a ravioli dish. Literally, no one finished their 4 pieces of ravioli.   Turkey meal: Usually turkey is hard to cook so I will give them credit for making it edible. But nothing special. Just simple turkey with gravy.   Pumpkin Pie: Once again, just a simple pie you can buy at costco or make yourself.  Service 0/5: As mention before, waiter was horrible. The waiter also did not know anything about their wine menu. We asked him which one he recommended. His answer was \"they are all good.\" He also had to come back multiple times because he did not know which wine we ordered (almost gave us the 400 dollar wine). We also spent a total of 2.5 hours at the restaurant. Not because we were having a good time but because our food would not come out. Felt like Food hell. I was literally fighting to finish my food.  However, one thing to note is that we never tried their other food so this restaurant might actually be good but based upon our first experience, we will never go to this restaurant again.",

    "review_text": "Restaurant is charming and really nice inside - feels like a typical old Italian restaurant with lots of character. The wine list is nothing to write home about - actually pretty lazy, lots of Safeway bottles - but you could find something for everyone. My wife had the pumpkin ravioli, which she said was fine, but lacking salt and seasoning. I ordered the quail stuffed with sage and sausage. Big portions of the sausage looked underdone, if not raw, and the texture only confirmed my suspicion. It was bright pink, unlike the rest of the (cooked) sausage. I left it on the side of my plate - it was too sage-y, and I didn't really want more, so I wasn't going to complain. The waiter, when clearing our plates, asked if everything was OK, and I said that actually the sausage was underdone. He took the plate, and returned a moment later saying the Chef had checked it out, and everything was as it should be - the sausage was supposed to be that color, and it was only the dim lighting in the dining room that made it appear otherwise.   I actually found this pretty insulting. First of all, the customer is always right. Second, that sausage was seriously underdone. There was no question; it looked raw, and the texture of it was underdone. Third, it was still broad daylight outside, and the dining room was not *that* dimly lit. Fourth, sausage is not \"two-tone\" in color. If the Chef can't tell the difference, he's an idiot and should be fired. If he refuses to admit his mistake, that's just a food poisoning lawsuit waiting to happen. I didn't even want anything in return - no comp on the bill, no free dessert - I just wanted him to admit it was raw. If the winelist was amazing, or the other stuff on the menu was great, I'd consider returning and ordering differently, but since nobody in our party was thrilled with what they got, I see no reason to go back.",

I'm not one to complain excessively about food .. even my negative reviews here are tempered and balanced. But that this piece of petrale even made it out of the kitchen is proof that this restaurant, under new ownership or not, is already in grave danger. Awful .. \u00a0not fresh or properly cooked, splashed carelessly with some oil and adorned with the sorriest small portion of unappetizing green beans ever assembled. Honestly, the plate was a joke .. its appearance alone seemed a pointed attempt to discourage the recipient to ever come back here. Whoever was in the kitchen and allowed this to pass as edible, presentable, or just plain unoffensive, should be told to switch professions. Fior D'Italia may be the oldest restaurant in San Francisco .. but that tenure is about to end if they keep this up.   The service was fine .. a real shame that a competent waiter would be forced to bring a meal like this to the table.  1/5/13 - Following up a few days later. With perspective and having had time to process the experience reasonably .. I stick by my assessment that this was the worst, most poorly presented, unappetizing piece of fish I've ever been served in a restaurant. Read my other reviews .. I never express such extreme distaste. Simply awful.",

    "review_text": "My family had a lovely time at Fior D'Italia on Christmas Day. \u00a0One of us usually likes to host and cook a big meal, but since my stepmother had a stroke a few years ago, she can't make it up the stairs (and we all have stairs) so it's simpler to go out to dinner. \u00a0Based on our experience at FDI, we may make this our holiday restaurant.  The restaurant is very pretty and light, with lots of huge windows and beautiful Christmas decorations. \u00a0I especially liked the tin ceiling. \u00a0Our waiter was charming and attentive, as were the rest of the staff. \u00a0We had brought champagne with us and it was carefully put in a chiller and served to us in flutes.  Our appetizers ranged from oysters to Caesar salad to minestrone. \u00a0I loved my oysters, but heard that the Caesar's had a little too much dressing. \u00a0The bread that was brought out was probably the best bread I've ever had in a restaurant. \u00a0A delicious crust with a tasty sourdough middle - yum, especially when dipped in their olive oil. \u00a0  We switched it up again on our main courses - an assort of pumpkin ravioli, fresh pasta with pesto, chicken, etc. \u00a0We all enjoyed our meals and were regrettably too full for dessert.  There were only a couple of missteps that I will point out - there was no valet on duty when we arrived for our reservation, although the sign was out. \u00a0We had to ask for butter several times, and finally, even though we had made a special effort to let the restaurant know that my stepmother uses a walker and we wanted to make sure she wouldn't have to walk too far, that was not heeded and there was a lot of confusion when we arrived. \u00a0No big deal, but when you call the restaurant 2x to confirm the table location, your wishes should be honored.  Definitely worth going back to!",

I watched other waiters working quickly and checking their tables frequently, whereas I watched our waiter walk around and talk to his coworkers instead of checking on us. I didn't even get my leftovers boxed because I knew it was going to take him forever to do it. We were done eating for a good 30 minutes by the time we got our check. It was to the point where even the host noticed we were just sitting there waiting on him and went to go get him. To me that's just very bad service so we of course tipped him very low. I probably wouldn't come back here.",

First of all..no one was at the front.. we just waited until someone show up  The servers did not seem happy to see us since we were walking in close to closing time; no one even greeted us. We felt like we were unwanted.. but whatevers.. we were so hungry, we just ignored it. We got seated and quickly ordered their lasagna and pesto pasta. We literally finished in less than 20 minutes since we were starving [wasn't even 10pm!]  Our server's mood brightened up; he was much nicer in the end as he cleaned up our plates. He made a joke, saying that he will see us tomorrow and dont be late.  The bf was not happy. Wouldn't come here again",

I had their ravioli de zucca, which was delicious. Some restaurants that make this same dish go a bit heavy on the butter, but this place made it very light. I didn't get that oily feeling. My brother had the linguine with clams and loved his dish. My mom had their house salad. My dad had their linguine with meatballs. My parents enjoyed their food. The portion size is just right compared to Scoma's, which are huge and their dishes are in the 25-34 dollar range. If you're looking for good italian food at an affordable price come here.",

    "review_text": "We arrived at Fior D'Italia about 6:30 pm on Saturday, September 28. No reservations. They were just finishing up a wedding reception, and weren't open for supper until 7:00. We were told it would be about 45 minutes and that they had to clear 7 and 730 reservations. Since we could smell the garlic, olive oil and wine, we decided it might be worth the wait.  The restaurant clearly caters to locals and regulars. We sat at about 7:50, but they seemed to somehow make room for everyone who came it.  We started with the shrimp wrapped in prosciutto, which was frickn awesome. Garlic, olive oil, salty - and served HOT. Delicious. My wife had the saltimbocca, which was excellent. I suggest about 25% less sage, since that was the dominant flavor, but it was rich and flavorful. Pounded thin, cooked in butter, olive oil, with a nice sauce with broth and wine. Very tasty. I had the Osso Bucco, which is one of my benchmark dinners at an Italian restaurant, and Fior did not disappoint. There was no gremolata, but the broth was rich enough with the right flavors that I found it did not matter. Tender and juicy, full of flavor, with just a little pink. Again, full of rich flavors. In both cases, supper was served very hot, so the food had obviously not been sitting out before it was brought to the table.  We had dessert, but for the life of me I can not remember what we had - so I would probably say that it just did not make an impression.  Overall, even though we had to wait for a table, they made room for walk ins on a busy Saturday evening, the food was excellent, and the service was fast.",

    "review_text": "Where Italian food is concerned, people have different likes and dislikes. It's not easy to keep everyone happy. \u00a0In my humble opinion that's why many of these TV programs featuring restaurant \"makeovers\" involve Italian restaurants. \u00a0I think that Italian chefs use recipes handed down for generations and have very personal touches. \u00a0If you order dish \"A\" in a place and order the same thing in another place, they may have the same core ingredients but the flavor palette may be entirely different.  I have a friend who thinks genuine \"Italian\" food starts and stops with spaghetti and meatballs. \u00a0The Fior D'Italia doesn't eschew those \"American staples\" but has enough variety to suit anyone and everyone. \u00a0I went there the other night for the first time since Chef Gianni took over the place and reopened (hence I'm treating this as a new review rather than an update). \u00a0 \u00a0Service was spot on attentive, bread hot and water glasses filled and coffee replenished. \u00a0I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever. \u00a0I was impressed by the fact that one of our party, a vegetarian, was able to get a \"special\" dish just by asking the waiter (Donny) politely if it was possible. \u00a0No problem.  I always read the bad reviews just to get a sense of how a place clicks. \u00a0I noticed many were because some coupons from a few years back aren't redeemable under the new owner. \u00a0 I remember the old owner - a heck of a nice fellow but \u00a0prone to giving out coupons and free dinners (I had a free dinner there myself several years ago). \u00a0That may be patriotic or civic minded but it impacts negatively on the bottom line. \u00a0Personally I would never expect a coupon more than a year old to be honored and don't think anyone else should either. \u00a0Kudos to Chef Gianni for trying to make things right \u00a0with people that do try to use them.  I had a mixed green salad for starters and the saltimbocca (literally jumps in your mouth) for the main course. \u00a0The presentation was excellent and the taste was very exquisite. \u00a0This dish could be very bland in the hands of an unskilled chef but Gianni's kitchen did a outstanding job. \u00a0There were some potatoes and asparagus to complete the dish - not so much as to waste but definitely enough to satisfy. \u00a0My wife had the veal chop (Cotoletta alla Piemontese) and it was huge. \u00a0My companions had the vegetarian \"special\" and a chicken dish (Petto di Pollo) respectively. \u00a0I didn't sample any of their food but I noticed that very little if any was left on their respective plates. \u00a0I declined dessert but one of them ordered a chocolate gelato and let us have a taste. \u00a0If you like chocolate ice cream, you will love chocolate gelato.  The Ambiance was classy but comfortable and pleasant. \u00a0It's upscale but doesn't over do it. \u00a0Staff was attentive and friendly. \u00a0The food was hot, tasty and delicious. \u00a0The menu has been cut back from what it was but that's a good thing as it allows them to focus. \u00a0The bar seems to be a local neighborhood hangout. \u00a0I understand they serve finger food but I didn't try any so my \u00a0comments are based on my experience. \u00a0The menu is Northern \"Italian\" style with pasta, soup and salad courses \u00a0separate items on the menu.  For a special \u00a0treat and a wonderful meal, Fior D'Italia can't be beat. \u00a0Thanks Gianni! \u00a0I'll be back!",

For dessert, we had the cooked pudding, which was bland, but the sauce was good.  The service was very good and the waiter was funny without being awkward.

We started of with drinks and calamari, then moved into the good stuff, dinner. I had the rack of lamb and my wife had the veal picatta. Both spot on. Wine list was good, but not great. A few more Sonoma County wines on the list would have been a plus.  All in all, a very good evening. The only reason I did not give it five stars was the three dogs that where inside the bar when we walked in. They where still there when we left. Dogs in a restaurant?

There were six of us in our party. We were seated in a booth with two additional chairs which was somewhat uncomfortable but we were fine with that. Our waiter seemed very busy and finally after almost 20 minutes came over to take our drink order. We ordered martinis and wine. He brought back the martinis but the martinis were the wrong ones he totally forgot the wine for almost another 10 minutes. By now we are at the 25 minute mark the restaurant was very busy. Finally the wine came and he placed our food orders most of us had pasta I had the halibut. Everyone's food came except my halibut and he apologized saying it would be out shortly so another five minutes passes while my friends are going ahead and eating I'm sitting with just my glass of wine. Then the ma\u00eetre d' came out and also apologize saying the food was on the way he apologized and said there was nothing more he could do please except my apologies which was very nice. Then my halibut came and I was relieved because we had a dinner theater show afterward so now I could start eating my friends were already at least halfway through their meal. The first bite of the halibut was okay but I noticed it was a little tough. The second bite I couldn't even pull the halibut away from the rest of the piece because it was 100% completely raw inside. I had to send the raw fish back it looked like it had been poached in hot boiling water for no more than maybe two minutes it definitely had not even been inside of a saut\u00e9 pan. When I asked another waiter if he could help us and explain my fish was raw he immediately looked at us and yelled at our table \"Who's your waiter?\" And walked away. I understand when restaurants get busy and things go wrong in the bar or the kitchen it happens we understand but the rudeness of the waitstaff and the fact the food wasn't even properly prepared was not cool. it finally came back out another 10 minutes later. By now my friends had completely finished their meal and I am just starting mine. we're now late for a dinner theater by almost half an hour so the entire experience from my side was somewhat ruined and I know my friends felt bad as well. Mostly because I recommended the restaurant. I'm not sure I would go back after being treated this way. San Francisco has so many restaurants with grateful wait staff and properly cooked food. I will say the Pasta Fagioli soup is to die for, comes in a very large portion crock, large enough for a meal actually. Next time I'll just have that, IF there is a next time. What a shame.....",

To start, we got the pancetta wrapped prawns and the calamari. The prawns were AMAZING. Make sure to save some of the bread to dip in the garlic sauce afterwards!! The calamari was really good as well. It came with lemon and two different kind of sauces. Very fresh and very delicious.  For dinner, my mom and I split the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese and the Bucatini Amatriciana. Both dishes were superb. The \u00a0Tagliatelle alla Bolognese is a fresh house made pasta with a meat sauce. The pasta was perfectly a'dente and the meat sauce was great. \u00a0The Bucatini Amatriciana is a \"dry\" pasta (not housemade?) with pancetta in a spicy tomato sauce and it is soooooo good.

The first thing that kinda through me off was when they served the bread I asked for some garlic to put in my olive oil for dipping and he said I could not have any because it would insult the chef. Which I thought it was a little strange when it is only for dipping. Then when my seafood pasta came out we asked for Parmesan cheese he said we could not have any. I have never been refused either of those items at any Italian restaurant I have been to. We then had desert which was the Tiramisu and a pudding with fruit on top. The desert was delicious.    \u00a0 Then our check came. I gave the sever my coupon. He looked at it and said that I could not use it. I was very upset about it so he took it to the manager to see if I could use it. He came back with the manager and the manager said that he does not have to take because that they changed ownership. So we went around and around about this coupon. He told me that he would give me a little off my bill. I said whatever and do what you gotta due with a pissed off attitude from me. He then came back and gave me a better discount which made me a little happier. It was a little to much drama over this coupon that should have never happen. It was a Monday night and there was mane a quarter filled up. I explained to the manager that he should be happy that people are coming in to use there coupon because it brings in business that you would normally have. I think it is a great promotion idea from the previous owner. The coupon was good only from Monday through Thursday for food only.My advise to people that have this coupon is to not even waste your time and try to use it there unless you want to battle with the manager. Like I said , other then the drama that happened , the food and the service was good.I would have rated it a 3.5.",

So sad and disappointed, we so wanted this to be a good experience. However I can't stress enough how gracious and friendly the service was. We sat at the bar first and ordered mussels and a couple of martinis. The drinks and bartenders were great (very reasonable happy hour BTW), but the mussels came out COLD...I mean even the butter sauce was cold. Decided to hope for the best with dinner. We got a great table, again the staff was a class act, it was such a shame to be so disappointed with both our entrees. The chef agreed to do a chicken parm (not on the menu). That was wrapped up after two bites and went to the dog. It was bone dry..just not edible. We also had the butternut and sage raviolis and brown butter sauce. This was totally dry and had no sauce. Jeez was the sous chef off that night? Then the clincher..I asked for some type of cream sauce to try to save this dish, the waiter came back and said the chef refused. WOW. I asked for it on the side and finally got it for my now cold dish. I don't know what is going on in that kitchen, but at this rate I would be surprised to see them open next week. The two stars are for the staff ...cheers, guys, you are the best.",

The reservations were for 6:00 so we arrived on time and entered through the bar door and escorted over to the restaurant's entrance where we met with the host who is a amiable and friendly guy. The ambiance of this restaurant is pleasant and the noise level here was reasonable. It was not crowded at all at this time of the early evening. We were seated and the waiter quickly arrived and took our orders. I had the veal picata which came with potato and sting beans, the wife had the chicken with the same sides and my son had the fish. We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms which were good/ Dinner also comes with bread and there is olive oil for dipping. The food was presented well and tasty. For dessert we shared tiramisu and my son opted for vanilla ice cream. I also ordered a capuchino to go along with the dessert The tiramisu is served in a sundae glass and doesn't look like the traditional cake I am used to but more like a ice cream dessert. It was okay, not what I expected though.The price for dinner including a mixed drink and a glass of house chardonnay was very reasonably priced. The waiter was efficient and the other waiter staff were all good. There is valet parking for $9.00 which is very nice. Overall we had an enjoyable experience here",

I went in to have a holiday cocktail and re-visit a restaurant I frequented many times prior to their closing. \u00a0The place was empty on a Sunday during brunch hours. We sat at the bar and was greeted by a young man who took our order then went to the back and brought out an elderly gentleman who made the cocktails. Nothing fancy champagne cocktail and a 7&amp;7. The bartender ? stated the man who made our drinks was the owner. That surpised me as the recent SFChron article on the re-opening stated it was a couple (who appeared much younger in the photo than the man who made are drinks). The restaurant now has a bar menu and we ordered 2 small plates which were fine. The place was freezing cold and no one came in while we were there. But, the killer was when I got the bill I was charged $30.00 for 2 champagne cocktails (which were made with splits that were placed on the bar). I still kick myself for not calling this out! I eat out alot and I know what drinks are costing these days and as a native San Franciscan I patron alot of restaurants that have been here for a long time and wish that they continue. I don't know if this restaurant will pick up but for a Sunday during brunch an empty restaurant is not a good thing. I wish them well but won't be going back.",

When we got there, the place was practically empty.   No wonder. The service is awul. As soon as we sat, the first thing the waiter said to me is \"you look tired\" -- wow, thanks for the compliment, buddy! (I should have replied with: \"You look like a 60 year old man waiting tables in an empty overpriced restaurant.\")  Since I had already spent $25 to eat at this place, I let them know about the coupon/certificate before we ordered. The host/manager comes over and says \"management has changed, and we will no longer honor that deal.\"  Hmm... interesting. I have, essentially, a contract saying that it never expires, for an establishment with the exact same name and location as they have, and they are saying they don't have to honor it.  Well, the meal would have been over $100 for the 2 of us anyway, since the food is so overpriced (minimum price for a meat dish is like $30+), so we decided to just take our business elsewhere. Instead of getting the chance to (a) honor our ALREADY-PAID-FOR certificate; (b) win over a repeat customer for the future (we are relatively local); and (c) have us bring additional big-spending business associates there when they visit for company matters... instead, they got ZERO dollars from us   (it was a blessing in disguise, because we went and spent $130 at Le Trappe, the Belgian food/beer place a few blocks down on Columbus, which was a great little discovery...)  From the fact that a nearly-empty restaurant still treats their customers like crap and won't honor existing agreements, they clearly don't care whether they get your business... so I suggest you just don't give it to them.

There was a bit of a mixup at first and our waiter (Gill, who was very sweet and helpful by the way) told us to order only from the list of items that were excluded from the offer (which was a very small list) but once we sorted that out we ordered our actual items and received some bread and drinks very promptly! Gill also made a delicious wine recommendation. Also the maitre d was very attentive and apologized about the menu mixup and stopped by a few times to see if we were enjoying everything.  In addition to the items we ordered from the deal, we also ordered fresh oysters and some cocktails. The Suffering Bastard is delicious. My boyfriend got it and I almost wanted to order one along with my wine. :P The oysters were also very delicious and fresh but out of the 6 we got, two had some grit. It was also super awkward as I was picking shell bits out of my mouth when the maitre d stopped by and asked how we were doing so I had to cover my mouth and just be like, \"MMMMHMM, GREAT, THANK YOU\"   But besides that, everything was delicious. The ravioli I had was awesome. My boyfriend liked the gnocci but said it wasn't as good as his mom's (but that is biased obviously, I enjoyed it and thought it was good). Everyone there was super friendly, attentive (but not overly so) and helpful and made the experience wonderful!   Also, at the time of day we went (5:30-6:30 or 7ish) the sun was coming through all the glass windows and it cast everything in such a lovely glow. It was beautiful. I really enjoyed the whole atmosphere and even though the neighborhood outside isn't particularly visually appealing (there was some construction and street cleaning going on) it looked lovely that day from where we were sitting.

Trust me on this one don't believe in everything you see and hear on TV because you end up looking like a gullible fool like I did. Sadly I came here today for my birthday and let me tell you it is not all that. Shit Olive Garden is better than this place. Let me first start off with the shitty service. The waiter comes and takes our order and as he's taking our order he gets a snappy attitude because my cousin is asking about the meat sauce. Then he doesn't check on us, doesn't refill our water, and then proceeds to take our appetizer and doesn't ask if we are done. Then the food is absolutely awful. We waited an hour for our food no joke and when we finally get it it's cold, bland, and just tasted disgusting. Then when they sing you Happy birthday and bring you the dessert you think it's free but they surprise you at the end when they charge it to the bill and your like wtf most restaurants give you a free desert on your birthday. \u00a0Well not this place. Lastly not only is the staff snobby and looks down on you in utter disdain but the clientele does the same thing. We walked in and immediately we got that uncomfortable vibe like we didn't belong there. Then the wtf are you doing here / disdained judgemental looks started throughout the whole night which made the experience even more unpleasant. I felt like I had gone back in time to the 50's when minorities are trying to get a meal at a diner but instead get passive aggressiveness and hostility from the staff and clientele. I smell prejudice. \u00a0I mean what did I expect when we were the only Latino family there and everyone else was middle class white baby boomers and their fucking parents. Disgusting!!!! Never coming here again. Shitty service, shitty food, and shitty clientele and way to over priced.",

Olive oil tasted freshly pressed. We ordered fresh oysters and pancetta wrapped prawns. Delicious. Careful of the Tabasco sauce on the oysters.

Plus, my parents held their engagement party at Fior D'Italia. From the moment I drove up and the moment I left, I was disappointed.  First of all, there was a sign that read Valet Parking, No valet in sight. I waited a few minutes and then decided to leave my car in front of the restaurant (with hazard lights on and the keys in my hands) and look for the valet. NOT A GOOD SIGN. The valet parker came out and finally parked my car.   I walked through the bar and was not impressed. Then I walked through the dining area and it dawned on me that I have seen more exciting dining rooms in assisted living facilities. My big mistake was thinking I'd just give it a chance.  My dinner order was simple and very Italian: A Caesar salad and lasagna. How can that be messed up? The salad was over dressed and not tasty. When they served the lasagna, I took one look and thought OMG! Grossly over cooked pasta with grayish looking meat. Absolutely no appealing presentation..slopped (in lack of a better phrase) on a boat plate.. Tasteless. Seriously?! This is not Italian food and those who enjoyed it must be from another planet.  Service was slow and not very professional (like the valet). The Maitre'd seemed totally oblivious to the diners. I had to ask for my check after not even eating half of my plate.   I was born in SF and this experience really upset me. I know they have changed owners. It is sad that people read about past glories of this restaurant, visit it and have to deal with poor service and even poorer food.",

The five people in our party each had different entrees, and all enjoyed their meals. My rustic grandniece had rabbit and pronounced it excellent. Rabbit, for cry in' out loud! Poor wee critter.  A few Yelpers here said the staff was rude. Not my experience at all. I was greeted like an old friend. Everything was served promptly and courteously.
