But I like to think I don't do things in half-measures and it was cocktail o'clock.  I ordered up a La Floridita and some oysters. My friend restrained herself to a cocktail and a salad. The oysters were quite nice! My cocktail was a bit icy though. I hate when people don't double-strain. I don't like chips of ice in my cocktails that are served up (ah, bar snobbery).  The early afternoon hours contained the lunch stragglers and an odd man or two at the bar. We opted to sit at the bar to take in the French decor. It kind of reminded me of my fave Figaro Bistrot back in L.A. but on a grander scale.",

True French Atmosphere but the cuisine is a bit mixed American and French, been there a few times, once was with my Dutch friend who thought he was in Pairs for a moment. The absinthe just added more to it after the awesome duck confit. The bar is always packed, so many selection from absinthe, wine list, mixed drinks, It is a cool, trendy like with culture mixed restaurant, not even mention about the food...   I give 4 stars because it is a bit $$$, but surely worthy it :-)",

    "review_text": "Totally stealing words from the Frenchies: c'est magnifique! Came here for the first time this past weekend for Sunday brunch. I spent the weekend with the parents and god family, and typically when I'm in the city on Sundays I do brunch in the Castro. However, that really isn't the whole family's sort of scene.   Being the Greeks that we are, we're a very impatient group and this place was able to seat the six of us right away. Note: we got there around 11:15-11:30-ish, right after it opened (and it was already pretty full). They scooted two tiny tables together and I sat in the crack, which after I tasted my mimosa was quite fine with me. Their bloody marys also looked really delicious. The place has that quaint chic french cafe look to it inside, which I love.   Now here's the best part- the food! I had THE most amazing banana blueberry souffle pancakes. I am the queen of pancakes, mainly because I love carbs (and who doesn't), and these guys did not disappoint. I skipped the whipped cream, and I'm so glad I did. The pancakes were were very sweet all on their own. Add bacon to the side and you could call this a meal for two. Everyone else had something different and no one had a bad thing to say. My dad's a diabetic and he was the happiest camper in the group.   I'm not gonna lie, I never saw the check. I don't even think it came to the table- someone did one of those sly \"here's my card on the way to the bathroom\" moves. But I know that my meal, which did i mention I could've split with someone, was maybe $15-17 with the bacon.   This place is the perfect hangover brunch locale, even if you have to walk a block or two to get there (we did). But on a perfect San Franciscan day... no one minds walking, esp if this is where you end up.",

Absinthe Brasserie is the place to inject some flavor and romance into your life.   *Sip on their famous Galapagos Cocktail, savor some wine.  *Sample the creamy Castelbelbo cheese from Piemonte, Itlay with earthy marcona almonds and crusty raisin bread...so good that it enticed my carb-loathing date to go for seconds and thirds.  *I absolutely adored my choice. Roasted Rack of Lamb with zucchini-yogurt pur\u00e9e; squash, eggplant, pepper hash; crispy squash blossom. The lamb was perfectly medium rare, the outside surprising crispy while the inside was juicy and succulent. The sauteed eggplant and squash was perfectly seasoned. I tried a bite of my date's Manchego &amp; Chorizo stuffed Mary's Chicken...flavorful and tender, but I'll let him yelp that. :) \u00a0 *For dessert, the Gianduja Soft Chocolate and whiskey parfait with almond molasses toffee sauce was surprisingly complex in flavor. Separately, the chocolate mousse, whisky parfait, ice cream and toffee sauce were all quite good. Together, the flavors mingled together into an orgasmic explosion of flavor in your mouth.   Tip: If you are on a date, be sure to request booth seating. To touch, feed, whisper, share delicious morsels...that is the art of seduction.",

I had the skirt steak and can I just say....is it bad form to the lick the plate? Just kidding, but it was that good! My friend had the chicken and I'm pretty sure she felt the same way I did.

However, the last time I dined at Absinthe, we had an intolerably rude waitress who spilled ice water in our eggs and just shrugged like, \"shit happens. Deal.\" While I'm pretty laid back, when I'm paying $12 for an omelet, I'd like to actually eat it; not test its buoyancy. To their credit, Jeff, the GM, apologized profusely, sent me a gift certificate and offered to buy me and my friends a round of drinks the next time I was there.   After a year and harboring a mildly obsessive girl crush on Jamie Lauren (second only to Elizabeth Faulkner), I decided to venture back for dinner. From the moment I opened the door I knew I was home. I missed the fabulous bar, the gorgeous tiles, the comfy banquettes and the retro cocktail menu.   I'm also glad to report that the menu has been vastly improved. Jamie (we are on a first name basis) has broken out of the classic Brasserie mold with some surprising additions and new presentations while retaining the hearty satisfaction of bistro food.   The beet salad was an absolute dream: roasted beets with burrata and micro greens. My dining companion, who incidentally doesn't eat beets b/c he doesn't like them, devoured half the dish. Did I mention it has burrata?   Since Jamie just won her last challenge on Top Chef using scallops, I decided to try her grilled scallop entree. I was definitely impressed with the texture of the scallop none of the chewy stringiness that I normally associate with scallops. The sun-choke puree with it was creamy and delicious as were the baby artichoke hearts.   For dessert we shared the warm chocolate tart with salted caramel sauce, macadamia brittle and bruleed bananas. It was good but there definitely was not enough macadamia brittle.   I am definitely back to being a regular at Absinthe. Thank you Jamie for making an oldie a goodie. And for being the hottest girl on TV! \u00a0swoon!",

I like the way the seating is set up in the restaurant you don't feel super close to other diners. The pretzels are delicious as well as the pork chop and the Coq Au Vin.  Also of course they have a huge variety of tasty drinks which are all beautiful and very tasty.  Great for a special evening or just drinks and a quick bite.",

    "review_text": "It was my parents' anniversary earlier this week, and they were kind enough to invite my sister and I along for the celebratory evening. (I know. They must really love us.) We celebrated over dinner at Absinthe Brasserie &amp; Bar in Hayes Valley, before walking over to The Orpheum to see the Broadway rendition of Billy Elliott.   Absinthe, which serves upscale French-American and Northern Italian cuisine, is a definite gem in the San Francisco dining scene. The soft lighting and the fun Belle Epoque decor give the place the vibe of a trendy and sophisticated French bistro. I've been there for brunch before, and the service has always been friendly and attentive. There's a nice bar in the front of the restaurant, and while we stuck to white wine the other night, Absinthe also offers an impressive selection of creative and whimsical cocktails.  When it comes to eating out at San Francisco restaurants, I pretty much just do whatever 7x7 tells me to do. Therefore, I was thrilled to try out two Absinthe specialties that have been featured on 7x7's various \"Best of San Francisco\" lists. First, we ordered the soft garlic pretzels with Vermont cheddar mornay sauce (#36 on the 2011 Big Eat San Francisco: 100 Things to Try Before You Die) as an appetizer. I was admittedly kind of surprised that something as simple as pretzels made that exclusive list, until I took my first bite, and realized that these pretzels, soft and fluffy and topped with garlic and sea salt, are not just simple pretzels. Trust me. Just try them.  We also ordered a shared plate of Black Mission figs with cheese, toasted walnuts, and arugula. Our waiter told us that this dish had just been added to the menu this week, now that figs are at the peak of their season, and the combination of flavors was superb.  After the pretzels were such a success, we decided to trust another recommendation from 7x7 when it came time for our individual orders. Absinthe's French onion soup was listed on 7x7's 2010 list of The Best Bowls of Soup in SF, so everyone at the table ordered a small crockpot filled with a perfectly-executed blend of broth, onions, bread, and melted Gruyere. Definitely one of the best bowls of French onion soup I've ever had!  For my entree, I ordered the halibut, which came with a jalapeno-basil corn pudding and a succotash-esque combination of fresh corn, red potatoes, and mushrooms, all in a brown butter vinaigrette. The fish was cooked expertly, and the summertime corn was sweet and flavorful. The rest of my family ordered the pork loin with black truffle jus, the coq au vin, and the potato-crusted arctic char. All of our dishes featured fresh, local, seasonal ingredients, and let's just say that there were a) no complaints and b) a lot of clean plates.  We had our hearts set on sharing a slice of German chocolate cake to round out the meal, but we sadly realized that we were running late for Billy Elliott, so we had to hightail it out of there and head over to The Orpheum. I guess we'll just have to go back soon...  All in all, Absinthe Brasserie &amp; Bar is the perfect place to stop for dinner or drinks before strolling a few blocks over to the Symphony Hall, the Opera House, or the Ballet. With the delicious food, the attentive service, and the classy ambience, Absinthe is one of those restaurants that makes any night feel special.",

I was impressed by their long wine list and creative cocktails list. \u00a0All the cocktails had interesting and unique names. \u00a0I got the one called PERFECT PEAR. \u00a0It was Vodka, pear brandy, lemon juice, sugar, &amp; a splash of orange juice ($9). \u00a0This one was more like a girly drink. \u00a0Not too strong and tasted very delicious. \u00a0My friend got the one called SWEENEY ($11). \u00a0It was Whiskey, walnut liqueur, &amp; quince saba. \u00a0I sipped it and it was strong........  For the food, we started off the Fresh Onion Soup ($8.5). \u00a0OMG, it tasted so good. \u00a0It was so rich, flavorful, a lot of melted cheese (even more than the soup). \u00a0Since the soup was kinda thick and heavy, I recommend to share with your date. \u00a0  Then I got the DUCK with wild rice hash and spinach ($30). \u00a0The presentation of the dish was nice. \u00a0The duck was amazing. \u00a0The meat was juicy, tender, moist and well-flavored. \u00a0The sides were also tasted good. \u00a0   My friend got the 10oz Rib Eye Steak ($35). \u00a0It served with mash potato and greens. \u00a0The portion was perfect for a guy. \u00a0I did not taste this one but my friend finished the whole dish within 15 minutes.....I can say the taste must be good too.  Too bad we did not have rooms for dessert....hopefully next time I can try it. \u00a0  Overall, I had a great dining experience here. \u00a0I would definitely to go  back to try the brunch there.",

    "review_text": "The food was good, the cocktails were \"meh,\" the service was TERRIBLE!   SERVICE: Our waitress came to ask us if we were ready to order dinner within two minutes of sitting down- \u00a0we had yet to order drinks or even get waters at the table so we said we could order drinks and oysters at that moment, but we needed a few minutes to look at the menu before we ordered dinner. Generally, when this happens the server returns in a few minutes to see if you're ready to order. The first and second time she walked by our tables (our menus were neatly put to the side of our table to indicate we were ready to order) I assumed she'd be back- on the fourth, fifth, and sixth time in the next 25 minutes I could only chuckle. Finally, I flagged her down and ask her if we could place an order for dinner. There was no \"sorry I kept you waiting\" or \"it's crazy in here tonight.\" Her cold presentation didn't help matters. Once we got our food she never returned to ask how everything was. Though she was absolutely around- just didn't actually acknowledge us.   FOOD/DRINK: Cocktails- I had heard very good things about the cocktails here. They were WAY too sweet. I was so excited for a great cocktail- it was just disappointing. I took a couple sips and had my fiance finish it- he'll put anything away.   The oysters were good- though only came with mignonette- I like with horseradish and cocktail sauce.   My fiance got grilled swordfish- EXCELLENT! Fresh fish, with fresh summer vegetables that we perfect cooked- just the right about of crisp to the veggies- where they taste cooked, but not mushy.   I got a Cesar salad- nothing fancy here, but that happens to be the way I like a Cesar- cold, crisp, anchovy-y dressing.   We got a blue cheese with honeycomb for dessert- oh my god. Freaking awesome!  It's a shame the service sucked- and frankly, I think it was a tad over priced. Yes, we got cheese and oysters. But, I didn't even get an entree and we didn't have a bottle of wine, just two cocktails- our bill was about 150$ (that may have been after the tip, but still). \u00a0I am giving two stars because even though the food was great- I really wouldn't go back because of the service- and for the price, the service should have been impeccable.",

With his mother in town for Mother's Day, we finally made a reservation. We started off with the antipasti plate with cured meats, pickles and delicious toasted bread. Perfect to share with three people as a starter.   Drinks: Pimm's Cup, Manhattan and Mojito.   My main was seriously one of the best meals I have had in my life: Duck breast on red curry carrot puree with sauteed spinach (I asked to replace the Swiss chard) and black garlic farro risotto. The meat was so tender and juicy and its seasoning simply delicious. The combination of flavors and texture - risotto vs. puree - was genius. I indulged in every bite and was almost crying that I couldn't finish it all.   We'll be back!",

    "review_text": "When I arrived at Absinthe last night the place was a madhouse. \u00a0It was impossible to get to the bar to get a drink because of all the annoying amateur drinkers. \u00a0You know the type, slightly older crowd, may get out to a bar once a month and know nothing of proper bar behavior, hog the bar even though they're not drinking, etc etc. \u00a0Anyway, after about 10 minutes I managed to get a drink, (a very tasty Sazerac) and proceeded to wait on my friend to arrive. \u00a0  Then around 7 something magical happened. \u00a0All of the annoying people left, and what remained was a nice lively atmosphere filled with a cool crowd that was totally different than the cacophony that existed only 10 minutes prior. \u00a0 As I was sitting down on a barstool one of the waitresses came up and thanked me for being so patient. \u00a0She informed me that it was the evening for the Nutcracker at the opera house which explained the huge crowd. \u00a0I found this not only useful, but highly professional. \u00a0(Absinthe management, the waitress with the very short hair in the bar area last night should be commended for her professionalism) \u00a0  Shortly after my friend arrived and we got a table in the bar area. \u00a0I had been craving a good croque madame for a while, so that's what I ordered. \u00a0I was then informed that the croque madame was on the \u00a0bar menu, which was only available after 8 PM. \u00a0I found this pretty annoying since A) I was sitting in the bar, so what's the point of having a bar menu if it isn't always available in the bar and B) how hard could it really be to throw a croque madame together 30 minutes prior to the \"official start\" of the bar menu being available. \u00a0Looking over the normal menu, I settled on a NY strip and fries. \u00a0The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and was an excellent cut of meat. \u00a0The fries were ok, but left a little to be desired. \u00a0At $29 I felt the price was about right for what I got. \u00a0  So to recap, Absinthe is a great place to grab a drink assuming you don't arrive during the pre-opera or symphony rush. \u00a0Their bartenders make an excellent cocktail, their cocktail menu is full of great classic cocktails that have long since been forgotten by most places, their bar is stocked with one of the best liquor selections in the city, the staff are highly professional, and the food is top notch. \u00a0Were it not for the bar menu situation, this place would easily receive 5 stars in my book.",

She even double-checked with the chef to be sure I'd be okay. She was helpful, knowledgeable and sweet.   We sat in a beautiful booth, shaped like a corner love seat. The outdoor tables made me think of Europe. It is a bit loud - but the decor is beautiful and very old world French. Check out the ceiling in the bar area, and notice the detail on some of the beautiful mirrors throughout.  My husband had a delightful cocktail, the Galapagos, to start which was sweet, sour and light. For starters, he ordered the garlic mini pretzels, which smelled and tasted wonderful - he loved the way the cheese sauce brought out the garilc and crunch of the pretzels. I had the fried chickpeas, which were hea-ven. Salty, slightly spicy, smelled just a little of curry. Eating them by hand was a treat.  We both chose beef for entrees, but it was a hard choice - the swordfish and lamb also looked wonderful. But it was also AN AWESOME CHOICE. His Wagyu beef was so tender it broke apart with a fork. They braise it for 24 hours so it melts apart. Imagine a delicate, slightly sweet, caramelized-on-the-outside brisket - but then imagine it so much better. I had the Angus filet, which is the best filet I've ever had. It was tender, a little sweet even, perfectly medium rare. I saved half, mostly so I could enjoy it a second day. Both came with beautiful compliments of potatoes and broccoli rabe that balanced and enhanced each flavor of the dish, bringing out the subtleties in everything on the plate.  We had no room for dessert, but were so satisfied and impressed with what we had that we didn't feel cheated. Highly recommended.",

There is an area that is good for group and can be pretty loud but as you walk through the restaurant, there are intimate settings as well in an area a little quieter. The lights are very dim and can be romantic if you're into that.   Spicy Fried Chickpeas: this crunchy garbanzo bean snack is decent but I will probably go with a different appetizer next time if I come back.   I had the Rock Cod entree and it was just okay - nothing to scream about. But it did go well with my glass of Albarino wine ;)   For dessert, I had the Chocolate Pot de Creme and Caramel Panna Cotta. Both equally delicious... so creamy and very filling! I was completely stuffed after this meal.   All in all, I probably won't go back but there was nothing wrong with this restaurant, it just didn't leave me begging for more.",

    "review_text": "I just recently came to Absinthe for the first time in my 6 years of living in SF. In the past two months I have been there three or four times; below are the highlights:   1) Me and the bf wanted something different for breakfast. READ: not dim sum (I do love you, Good Luck Dim Sum). We considered it a brunch date and were willing to spend up. We started with the French onion soup. Sigh, it was beautiful. I also had the grilled cheese portabella sandwich and he had the breakfast sandwich. Mine was a bit greasy on the bread, but his breakfast sandwich was fantastic. I instinctively ordered a bloody mary and neglected to explore the extensive cocktail menu. Note to self, don't show up with a hangover. The bloody mary was spicy; just the way I like it. Added bonus, picked onion garnish. Mmmm. Brunch was a little pricey, but worth it.   2) The second time I was here was at the end of a day-drinking escapade. Me and my compadres saddled up to the bar to explore that cocktail menu I bypassed the first time. Collectively we had the Galapagos, Wonderlust, and and Joy Ride. They were perfect. Then, there was the differentiator...the pretzel bites. I heard they were named as one of the \"top 100 dishes to try in SF\", or something like that. I believe it. They were heaven. Melting, buttery, salty, deliciousness. HEAVEN!!   3) Brunch again. The good sir ordered the Croque Monsieur. It was okay for me, a standard open faced sandwich. I had the duck confit ragout. It was beautiful. The flavors were not impressive, independent of each other. But this is one of those circumstances where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.   So, while Absinthe should be treated as a rare treat because of the price, I can see why you would keep coming back. The menu doesn't change often (not at all since I have been here) but if you came here for the French onion soup alone, it would be worth it. Needless to say, I will be back.",

The absinthe drinks were enjoyable to have. Great GREAT service. Lively scene. We ordered the Persimmons salad, French onion soup, Beef Tartare &amp; raw oysters. Loved it all.

The walnut bread was pretty awesome as well.  We ordered the cauliflower soup.. but it came about 30 minutes too late and by that time, I just wanted to get to the entree. Had to flag down a bus boy to find out what was going on with the soup and told the server we didn't want it. 5 minutes later it comes out and they practically try to force it on us. Talk about uncomfortable. Can't really fault the waitress since she was on her break, but her backup could have done something.  Oh, and no refill of water for the 30 minutes between the cheese plate and soup fiasco.. Good gosh.  The burger was.. not good. I don't understand how a burger is pink throughout and so horribly dry. I may as well add bland to that too. We also had the rib-eye. Pretty good in its own right though a tad over-sauced and a touch salty. At least it was cooked medium rare as ordered. Loved the potatoes and asparagus though.  The chocolate pot de creme was good. Better that it was free but it still couldn't right the previous wrongs.  Food 2.5. Service 1.5.",

    "review_text": "Pre-dinner, having reviewed and practically memorized the menu, I planned to go easy during the actual meal and order an entree (pancetta and herb stuffed chicken) and a glass of wine. I had one too many pastries and lattes that week and decided that I was going to be 'good.' Later that evening, sitting at the table with my foodie glutton crew at a restaurant whose very name has been tied to anything from a psychoactive drug to poison, that intention quickly went astray.   Soup: I wanted to order the french onion soup which everyone seems to love, but I couldn't resist the ginger scented squash puree. It was your typical squash soup with a twist. The spiced creme fraiche and the toast almond shavings were a nice touch !   Shared Plate: Green garlic flatbread. \u00a0With meal item contenders such as roasted bone marrow and escargot, this was probably one of the most mundane shared plate items that could be ordered. Instead, this item ended up being one of the highlights of the night. The fava leaves, ricotta (tastier and saltier than expected) and olive/lemon oil made this appetizer so delicious !  Entree: Grilled Hereford ribye (so much for the chicken). Cooked medium rare and served alongside vegetables and celery-root puree, this was very good. I also had a taste of the famous grilled scallops which were great. I also enjoyed tasting the pan-seared Char (like a cross between Salmon and Trout) which came at a surprise as it looked like a Salmon but tasted more buttery and delicious than any Salmon I've had. I liked the Char more than my ribeye.   Dessert: \u00a0I was bummed out that they did not have the pear sorbet (I love all things pear) that night but I got to try the chocolate-banana tart and the panna cotta. I would definitely recommend the choc-banana tart as it was heavenly. The panna cotta was just okay; upon my first bite, the lemon gelee and thyme were overbearing and it was just a burst of \u00a0unexpected sourness ....if you order this, make sure to really dig into the panna cotta.   Drink: Blain-Gagnard, Chassagne-Montrachet '04. Selected by my foodie friend Alexei S. who has since made me a lover of white burgundy! They have quite an extensive wine list here.  The service was excellent! Very helpful and attentive waitress.   Would definitely like to return for brunch or a late night snack !",

Imagine the butter and toppings that come on your typical garlic fries, except now they're smothered all over five mini pieces of warm pretzels, paired with a side of vermont cheddar mornay..a warm and gooey cheese sauce. For $8, Absinthe will be my go to for bar snacks and quality mixed drinks. Try the 21 Hayes, it's refreshing and goes down like water (dangerous?).   Rest of the Apps: - Meatballs- only ok, nothing too special--I'd skip them next time.  - Poke- nice, fresh flavors and I liked the crunch of the macadamia nuts too.  Entrees: - Duck with coffee crust,wild rice hash, parsnips, spinach, huckleberry jus- so moist, so tender! I honestly forgot about the coffee crust until writing this review, so clearly the coffee flavor was not very apparent. The duck skin was crispy and the sides were good, but nothing to write home about.  - Burger- didn't get to try the actual burger but my friend said it was awesome. You can add on a bunch of toppings (fried egg, caramelized onions, gruyere, etc.) and it came with a big side of fries (mm, carbs).   Dessert: - Meyer lemon tart- not very tart, and the basil meringue was an odd topping. I wasn't too much of a fan of the pairing, but the tart itself was good. - Winter squash cake- the cake itself was not very sweet, but the brown butter ice cream added just the right amount of flavor. I enjoyed it! - Vanilla cheesecake- actually went very well with pineapple. We couldn't taste a hint of the cilantro mentioned on the menu, but it was okay. To be honest, I'm not very much of a dessert person so I'd probably skip on the course the next time I come.  I'll be coming back just for those pretzels!! Well deserving of their 7x7 spot.",

Good place when you're in the grab a cocktail and just chat it up with friends mode. - More historically classic cocktail menu with drinks like sazeracs and sidecars. They even note dates of the original cocktails: ex. classic Absinthe cocktail from Famous New Orleans Drinks (1940), by Stanley Clisby Arthur - Bartenders are professional and old school as well - Ginger Rogers: like a mojito but with gin. I'm a bit scared of gin but asked the bartender to give me a gin starter drink and this is what he poured me. No overwhelming junipery taste so was ok with me. - Huge location: spanned a few big windows when we were passing by. The bar is only in one of those big rooms, but nice to have some space.  Lowlights (my flip side to highlights): - Menu has predominately gin drinks: If you're not a gin (or absinthe) person and you want a specialty drink, you may be hard pressed. I'm a vodka girl and asked for a drink with vodka and they said they didn't recommend it. ;-)  OK location to stop into if you're in the neighborhood.",

We wanted to try a few things so started with chickpeas and olives. Both tasty and went nicely with the cocktails. Then onion soup (fantastic) and gazpacho (fair). For dinner we shared the fish with current reduction and roasted vegetables. Actually bland. Except for the onion soup, we didn't enjoy anything enough to finish our plates.  I actually left the review when I got home last night and still feeling the effects of the drinks. Given some time to think about it it, without the drinking it was pretty mediocre.   I enjoy visiting Hayes Valley and it was a close walk to the symphony. So the location is perfect. The waitstaff was efficient and friendly. Maybe we ordered the wrong things or the menu needs an update. Pretty boring selection.  As far as the atmosphere, it was fine but again, nothing to rave about. So after my morning coffee and a clear reflection, I'd say this was it for me. Not wowed.  Finally, having dinner with my two childhood friends was wonderful and nothing horrible happened.",

My husband and I are wine enthusiasts and since we have had the wine previously we knew what to expect.

She removed the bottle of wine right away. \u00a0Within a few minutes the sommelier came to our table and proceeded to tell us in a very loud voice so the surrounding tables could hear that \u00a0the wine was O.K and that we probably did not know what we had ordered but that perhaps we needed to explain what we wanted and expected in a bottle of wine. We were very surprised at her reaction and felt her aggressive manner was misplaced. My husband said he had ordered the bottle before and that this particular bottle tasted sour. He then suggested giving us the wine menu and that we would order something else. She did promptly did just that. Towards the end of our meal our server said the wine glasses had not been washed properly and that that might have been the reason we tasted a sour taste. I don't pretend to know if that's the truth or not but we know the situation was not handled properly as one might expect at a fine dining establishment. \u00a0My suggestion to the restaurant is that I think it's rather silly to accuse your patrons of being ignorant on any topic. Rather apologize for the inconvenience and move forward. It's better than leaving a sour taste in anyone's mouth so to speak.",

Now, on to the cocktails and food (off the limited bar menu since it was late): * GALAPAGOS  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- [4/5 - Lubricious. I love citrusey cocktails, so my taste buds caressed this one with zeal.] * SAZERAC  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- [3/5 - Comes highly recommended, but I'm not much of a whiskey person. My friend, however, loved it.] * SPICY FRIED CHICKPEAS  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- [4/5 - Fun bar food! I was kind of hoping for chickpea french fries like the ones at One Market, but this was good to munch on while chatting over cocktails before the real food finally arrived.] * FRENCH ONION SOUP GRATINEE  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- [4/5 - It's french onion soup.. not hard to fail this one - was good.] * SPICY RABBIT MEATBALLS  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- [5/5 - Rabbit Meatballs, Rabbit Meatballs, Rabbit Meatballs. Who'da thunk those fluffy little furballs could produce such soft, juicy, succulent meatballs that tickled the senses.] * SKIRT STEAK FRITES  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- [5/5 - After a series of rather bland/jaw-gnawing steaks at random other places, I was uncertain. Gotta admit, I'm not usually so thrilled to be wrong... but yes, yes I was. Delicious!] * TAHITIAN VANILLA CREME BRULEE  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- [4/5 - Yum!]  Of course, we ended the night with two absinthes. I had a classic emerald green French, and my friend a brownish-toned Californian (I think?).   Had an excellent night! Definitely looking forward to going back to explore the dinner menu.  NOTE: I asked about the hot dogs mentioned in 7x7's list of things to try and they informed me that they have a new chef, so they're no longer on the menu.",

Caught a few fumes courtesy of the SUV running while parked in the valet spot out front, loading patrons. \u00a0Seriously, this is 2009 in SF. \u00a0Let's not sit in our SUVs spewing noxious fumes, k?  Ordered a couple Galapogos cocktails-$9 (top 100 item consisting of pisco, lime, and grapefruit juice), and were quite impressed. Vibrant, bright, yet deep flavor, with a sweet finish from the brandied cherries. I Ethan-ized the drink by muddling the cherries even further.  French onion soup gratinee was superb ($8.5 for lg), and the baby romaine salad ($11) was reminiscent of a Caesar with black peppercorn dressing, and anchovies. \u00a0Very creative touch adding fried cheese to this dish. \u00a0I used to make fried cheese growing up, and despite being such a simple thing, this is one of my favorite flavors--wonderful connotations and very evocative. \u00a0So the cheese really put it over the top. \u00a0  Fries were...ok....served in a glass, and with tri-sauces: malt vinegar, dijon mustard, and rouille. \u00a0Sauces were good save for the rouille, which was bland, and needs to be replaced by a house-made ketchup. \u00a0Fries are also cut too small, tiny in some cases, making many of them more difficult to eat. \u00a0  Service was adequate at best. We had a server who apparently found it difficult to crack a smile on that gorgeous Friday night, and went to great pains in explaining to us why the speciality hot dog would not be available until late that evening (it apparently takes up so much room in the kitchen preparing the dog, that it would just be too difficult to offer it for dinner). \u00a0Who knew hot dogs could be such trouble-makers!  All in all, a very good experience, and I will most definitely be back to try many of their intriguing dishes and cocktails, although I doubt I'll be getting the scallops (only 2 in the dish for $30).

I had scoured Absinthe's menu online prior to going and while I was undecided about my entree, I knew that the gazpacho would be mine. And it was magical: cool and sweet, with a nice crab and cucumber salad nestled on top to offset the flavors. I loved it. I dreamt about it. I am genuinely tempted to go back and get a larger portion of it in the next week.   My pork confit was equally as impressive. I had been waffling between the pork and the risotto entrees, but our server was great at the big sell: \"Order the confit, and I guarantee you'll leave with a smile on your face.\"   I did. Imagine the most tender ribmeat that you've had, without the bone. It was the sort of pork that dissolves on the tongue, and it paired extremely well with the corn and fava bean garnish.   My roommate was comparably happy with her dishes. She declared her french onion soup the best she had ever had, and she had a bit of a dilemma with her entree. Upon seeing her large portion of chorizo and manchego stuffed chicken, she decided she would only eat half. Twenty minutes later, she joined me into Hall of Fame status of the Clean Plate club.   I was a bit surprised that the only (minor) misstep was the much-touted Galapagos cocktail. For all the hoopla surrounding it, we both found it to be much too sour and overpowering to be enjoyed with food. The Ginger Rogers made up for it, as it was refreshing and light and paired nicely with my gazpacho especially.   We came for our monthly girldate and we definitely were the minority among business dinners and slightly awkward romantic dates. I'm not overly concerned though, my date still came home with me.

Here we were, 4 young college kids sitting at the bar of a really bougy restaurant...of course we didn't know that much about drinks! Though we were clueless about everything, Eric was really patient and really helped us in deciding what drinks to get. He clearly explained the subtle differences between scotches, absinthes and beers. Listed below are the drinks that I ordered:  *Pernod Absinthe - 68% from Paris *Duplais Absinthe - 68% from Switzerland *Chimay Draft Beer - 5oz.  The main reason why I suggested to come here was because 1). I wanted to try Absinthe and 2). I wanted to see Absinthe made by drip. \"Drip\" meaning that the bartender uses a tank of water with a small faucet attached at the bottom that allows water to be dripped on the sugar cube that is placed right above the poured Absinthe. The dissolved sugar from the dripping water makes the initial color of the Absinthe go from green to a cloudy green/yellow. I've got to say, I preferred the Pernod over the Duplais. The Duplais had a stronger herb and licorice taste than the Pernod. The Pernod was smoother, which is something that I prefer even if the flavor wasn't as strong.   Among the drinks that I ordered, I also got the Homemade Hot Dog which was one of 7x7 top 100 list. The hot dog wasn't that spectacular. I had it with a 5 oz. glass of chimay beer which is what they had on tap that night. The beer was a nice amber color with great body. I only wanted a taste, so I thought having a 5oz. option was perfect!  But anyway, whether you want to try Absinthe or just go to a nice place to grab a drink, definitely come here, sit at the bar and ask for Eric. He'll take care of you.   Eric alone would've gotten this place 5 stars from me - only a 4 because I didn't expect one serving of Absinthe would be $15-19!",

We didn't eat a whole lot of food, but what we had was good. The main plates, as we could see from other people's tables, are rather large-portioned, so we opted for a couple small plates to share. However, if you're a large eater, I don't think you need to worry about emptying your wallet here for food -- it would be the drinks that break your bank.",

It was an experience in intself...interesting and fun drink. We ordered a couple of appetizers and they were deeeelish! The spicy chick peas were unique, tasty and healthy. The drink selection is so long, you can spend an evening trying to figure out what to drink. The crowd was sophisticated, edgy and fun. We were lucky to have good seating at a small table in the bar area (not the dining area) where we faced everyone and got to do some people watching. Service is great too...knowledgable staff that knew their drink and food menu!! Highly recommended.",

I've been on 2 first dates here, and both times I was very impressed. The menu has something for everyone, and bustling/busy feeling of the restaurant made me feel sorta special that he went out of the way of making a reservation.   My suggestion: start with some cocktails (21 Hayes for example), then do a wine pairing for dinner. We started with the hamachi crudo (amazingly sensual and seductive), and the Maine scallops (good, but a rip off). I thoroughly enjoyed my arctic char (topped with potato chips to seal in the moisture and add a crunchiness), and he had the t-bone (scarily big). We were totally stuffed.   YUM.   Don't forget to dress to impress.",

    "review_text": "My family and friends made it out here a few days ago. I have been wanting to try this place for about a year- I'm very glad I did.  We had a reservation for 8PM, but they seated us as soon as we arrived- which was 7:20! We got one of the best tables in the house- tucked away in a corner, right next to the window. It was so much quieter and intimate. One of the hosts was not very kind. I am a host myself, so I understand that sometimes other things are going on- but this woman did not speak a word to us. Whatever, I wasn't going to let that get to me!   We sit down and begin to inspect the myriad of dishes! We could NOT decide. Our server took about ten minutes to get to our table which is pretty bad for a restaurant, but it was fine since we were so indecisive. Also, I empathized since I saw she had an entire section to herself.  She finally made it to our table and she was pretty nice. We ordered so many damn starters. 1. Beef Tartare: 2 stars. I'm sorry, but this was probably one of the worst things I've ever had. Ever. 2. (Mexican) Ceviche: 5 stars- and this is coming from a Peruvian. This was DELICIOUS. Why so small?! the chips and guacamole were perfect as well. 3. Crispy Pork Belly: 4 stars. Once you get over the texture, you kind of die in the best way possible. 4. Olives: 5 stars. These were like.. the best olives ever. I don't know how. 5. I'm pretty sure I'm missing something. Drinks:  3 Pisco sours: 3.5 stars. A little too watery, but they were strong enough. We were pretty annoyed that the server failed to mention how they charge for the eggs they use to make this concontion.  G&amp;T: So strong and good.  ENTREES/SIDES: 1. absinthe burger- I HAVE FOUND IT-- the BEST burger I have ever eaten. I'm not kidding. the patty was huge and fresh. I split this with a friend- a very good call, since we were on the verge of pregnant bellies by this point. 2. French onion soup: 4 stars. split this one too. so damn good. 3. Mac and Cheese:5 stars. You need to get this! the cheese combinations are spectacular. 4. Salmon: 4 stars.  5. Duck: 3.5 stars  Desserts were okay. I would pass. All in all, I'm glad I visited. we all left five pounds heavier and lighter in our wallets. I can't say I'll come back for more beyond the mac and cheese and the burger, but it was a fun and drunken experience.",

They have 3 doors and the only one which allows you in is the one right on the corner. \u00a0Huge amt of cocktails and they're generous with the booze, not watered down. \u00a0 We tried the Yellow Jacket on the chalkboard and it was citrusy with some absinthe. \u00a0Midway thru the drink, the ice cubes have diluted out the citrus flavor and you 're left with the licorice taste of the absinthe. \u00a0It was strong enough to make me and BFF's hubby (who's double my size) a bit dizzy. BFF's hubby tried the Perfect Pear &amp; hubby had the French '75. \u00a0I didn't like either one.  The French bread was delicious with a nice crunchy crust. \u00a0Hubby asked for 2 more servings of it and needless to say, by the time our entrees arrived, he was stuffed as was I. \u00a0 We tried: 1. French fries, $6. \u00a0Slivers of delicious skinny fries served with ketchup and a garlicky aioli (yum) 2. Poke $17. \u00a0A timbale shaped round of chopped poke with topped with orange roe. \u00a0 3. Onion soup - a thick, gravy-like soup. \u00a0Lots of onions, not too salty. \u00a0BFF's hubby wanted more cheese &amp; thought this soup at Cafe Jacqueline's was better.  Entrees: 1. Blk Angus rib eye $35. The meat was tender and very tasty. \u00a0The serving didn't look very big 'tho. \u00a0Came with vegts and whipped mashed potatoes which were 'OK\". 2. Arctic Char $27. \u00a0Came topped with one thin layer of sliced potatoes. Cooked to perfection, very moist. \u00a0Served with leaves of Romaine, dressing. \u00a0I didn't like the olive sauce with it 'tho.  3. Duck breast $30. \u00a0Tender and tasty. \u00a0  Desserts: Only the boys found room for dessert even if not all finished their entrees. Choc pot de creme $9. \u00a0The waitress told us it's their most popular and easy to see why. Milk choc flavor with a spoonful of creme on top. \u00a0I thought I was too full but managed to eat 1/2 of hubby's dessert. \u00a0It was that good! Panna Cotta $9 - pear flavored with crunchy stuff on top. \u00a0It reminded me of almond jello. \u00a0Preferred the pot de creme.  Our water glasses were constantly filled but staffed needs more training as the water person would reach across the table for our glasses when it would've been better to come from behind you.",

    "review_text": "A \"brasserie\" is formally defined as \"an unpretentious restaurant...that serves...simple or hearty food.\" \u00a0Hayes Valley's Absinthe fits the bill for the most part, \u00a0though I was left a little bit disappointed with certain parts of the meal.  The beef tartare was absolutely wonderful and the perfect way to start off. \u00a0Loved the texture, plus it was nicely chilled and the finely chopped green apples, red onions, and cornichons added a delicate crunch. \u00a0The seasoning was just enough, not too overwhelming. \u00a0Good plating too.  My wife had the Mediterranean Sea Bass and since we tend to make every dish \"family style,\" I was able to try a fair amount. \u00a0The sea bass \u00a0was also wonderful. \u00a0Yep, I'm actually saying this, but the brussels sprouts were delightful (egad, I'm slowly learning to like brussels spouts). \u00a0I can't say enough about the sunchoke pur\u00e9e. \u00a0It was creamy, smooth, and sweet. \u00a0In short, totally awesome, the wipe your plate clean variety. \u00a0The sea bass, of course, was nicely done as well. \u00a0Crispy on the outside and soft and flaky inside. \u00a0  Sadly, the Absinthe Burger fell well short of expectations, so much so that I contemplated downgrading my rating to three stars. \u00a0On the plus side, the burger was cooked perfectly. \u00a0Very few places actually get it when you ask for a \"medium rare\" burger. \u00a0Absinthe does. \u00a0My burger was perfectly bloody and juicy. \u00a0Also, the meat was loosely packed. \u00a0The softness reminds me of Marlowe's burger. \u00a0Unfortunately, thats where the comparison ends. \u00a0The meat itself lacked that meaty, \"beefy\" taste and aroma that I like. \u00a0I'm not sure if Absinthe's cows are grass fed, but I find grass fed cows to lack a certain element, so you have to add the right amount of seasoning to make up for the loss. \u00a0Unfortunately, the burger just did not have that \"wow\" factor. \u00a0The egg on top was pretty dry and uninspiring. \u00a0Actually, the meat had a prevalent \"white vinegar\" aftertaste that I didn't really care for. \u00a0As my better half explained after she had her share, \"That vinegar taste, I think it's something people will either really like or really dislike, nothing in between.\" \u00a0I guess I just don't get it.  The Earl Grey Pavlova dessert brought me back in. \u00a0Very subtle flavors with the appropriate level of sweetness. \u00a0Nicely done.  Still, a very good meal overall. \u00a0Add to that good ambiance (a little bit too noisy) and good service, then that's a winner in my book. \u00a0Good to see that the relatively new Chef Keough used his Michael Mina background to maintain Absinthe's overall quality. \u00a0I'm aware of Absinthe's solid reputation for weekend brunch, so I will make it a point to come back for that at some point.",

Had brunch with my cousin, and made a reservation for Absinthe.  Once you walk in, it felt like being in France; really upscale, clean, ambiance was wonderful, and it smelled amazing! We were seated against velvety red seats, and along the walls is a mural of people eating and having a good time in a restaurant (i assume it would be a restaurant in France).   Our waiter was the only waiter that was servicing our area (towards the back eastern side of the restaurant), and didn't really have happiness in his smile, but was overall very courteous and attended to our needs.   I begun with a champagne cocktail, Bucks Fizz (orange and strawberry juice with champagne). I tasted more of the orange, citrus, and yes CHAMPAGNE! Looking at the menu, everything sounded delicious - my cousin viewed the pictures on YELP to help decide on what to get.   We ordered the Stuffed Marscapone French Toast to share, separated in three stuffed wedges; it was divine - it was not overly sweet, cinnamon made it somewhat like apple pie, the sliced almonds added a crunch, though - I did not really taste the marscapone come through, and it felt like bread pudding after a while as it sat. Overall, a really delicious dish. I ordered the Duck Confit Ragout (poached eggs on top of a bed of potato cakes with duck breast and toast on the side - somewhat like eggs Benedict); there wasn't that much duck breast, I sliced a piece for my cousin and she noticed how little duck there was - overall a really tasty dish. My cousin ordered the Crab Omelet (omelet stuffed with shredded crab, with fried potato cakes that were really crispy and toast on the side); it was very filling, but did not have enough crab meat.   Though there were minor flaws in the food that I ordered, taste and service was exceptional. Will I revisit Absinthe? Of course!",

I know that a meal may not compare to those two awesome things, but I do believe that Absinthe was worth the wait! \u00a0I have been wanting to go for forever, and finally go the chance to on Wednesday night. \u00a0I have to admit, though a handful of friends have been way before me and liked it, I thought that it may have lost its touch as other players have come onto the scene since Absinthe's presence years ago. \u00a0But boy was I wrong!  We both went with cocktails which were perfectly made. \u00a0I loved my Citron Vokda Lemonade, so refreshing with a hint of ginger (like a fresh ginger ale). \u00a0We were little piggies with our starters and ordered the Soft Garlic Pretzels &amp; Spicy Pork Meatballs. \u00a0The garlic pretzels were my fave! \u00a0I'm normally not a pretzel girl but these were like little pillows, not salty at all and just the right amount of garlic and butter. \u00a0The mornay sauce wasn't rich either. \u00a0The meatballs were moist and delightful but weren't spicy. \u00a0I liked how they provided crostinis as well. \u00a0I was starting to get a little full, but had to attack my 10 oz. Ribeye as much as I could. \u00a0I requested medium rare, but got more medium. \u00a0It was still grilled well and juicy for medium. \u00a0I usually get filet mignon but god did I miss the fat flavor from ribeyes! \u00a0The potato puree, creminis, roasted romano beans and bordelaise sauce was a great compliment, but I think I would have preferred a different veggie to the beans, but still wonderfully done. \u00a0He go the Braised Wagyu which was packed with fatty flavor and the braised taste of course. \u00a0It was fork tender, but for me, I preferred the grilled ribeye. \u00a0So I had to give him a lot of my steak, but no birthday would be complete without dessert, right? \u00a0So, we mustered up some courage and gained some stomach room to try the Buttermilk Panna Cotta. \u00a0It's not like a traditional one, as it's parfait style with roasted strawberries, basil meringue and strawberry crumb, but it was amazing! \u00a0I never thought about basil in dessert, and it worked so well. \u00a0Loved the light parfait twist on this. \u00a0So it was an amazing dinner...so much so...that we made reservations for that Sunday for brunch as well!  Same great service and we actually sat at the table next to the one from Wednesday night..a corner side by side booth-ish seat..loved it! It was a hard choice to choose what to get, as all the dishes sounded amazing. \u00a0He got the Absinthe Burger and I got the Duck Confit Eggs Ragout. \u00a0No garlic pretzels as a brunch app tho..aww man! \u00a0The Duck Confit needed to be cooked longer as it was a teeny bit tough, but it was still very good. \u00a0Loved the potato chive cake the duck and eggs were placed upon. \u00a0And the eggs, perfectly poached! \u00a0Loved the wild mushrooms and the light bernaise sauce. \u00a0His Absinthe Burger was cooked well..with an egg as well (no need for cheese then). \u00a0It was so juicy and flavorful. \u00a0Nice little frites to go with it as well. \u00a0  The indulgent week has ended, so a little more dieting now. \u00a0But I had two amazing meals at Absinthe and can't wait to go back.",

    "review_text": "I have a love-hate relationship with dinner dates. They are a terrible choice for first dates. Frankly, it's uncomfortable to sit across a table from someone and have forced conversation and awkward pauses.  However, if I've been seeing someone a while, I think a dinner date lends itself to creating a shared, intimate experience. If that's what you're after, then Absinthe is a good choice. The ambiance is sophisticated but laid back, with enough chatter to know you're in a popular, busy restaurant.  We were originally seated at a standard table for two, but I kept eying the semi-circle booths that seem perfectly designed for couples. It's just like me to really want something I can't have, so as soon as I saw a couple leave, I asked the server if it was okay to switch tables. He obliged; I tipped him well later.   As for the food, well, it's like being on an episode of Top Chef. My scorecard would note the fancy presentation and give extra points to the Manchego and Chorizo-stuffed Mary's Chicken. It comes with these shelling beans on the bottom. I have no idea what those are, but they taste great and have less filling.",

(\"Where should we meet?\" \"Absinthe?\") It's also the home of Jamie, one of the chef's from Top Chef - which is kinda fun. (BTW, Absinthe: \u00a0I \u00a0love the policy of being able to put in my name, then give you my cell number and have you call me when you are 5m away from seating. It's a simple idea, easy to execute, and I've never seen another restaurant do this... )  I've never had the wine here, strangely enough for me, so I can't comment on the cellar or the stock - but I have had quite a few cocktails at this place. (Alright, shush!) The Manhattan's were perfectly executed, just the right amount of bourbon, and my barometer (BAR-o-meter, get it? haha....oh, never mind), the dirty martini, was as good as I would make myself...tremendous way to end a work week.  Food was, as expected, brilliant. For a starter, the deconstructed oyster shooter was flavorful and fun, and every entree I've had there so far has been grilled, baked or tossed to near perfection. The wait staff is fun and friendly, and (as I found out the other week) can take a joke, so that's key.   The atmosphere was fun - but a little too fun, which is why I subtracted some points. The place is tiled and paneled, and the end result is an echo chamber - even a moderate crowd makes the place disturbingly loud and noisy, and on a Friday and Saturday night you may as well break out those noise canceling headsets. I never complain about s**t like this, btw, but it's really over-the-top here.",

It is outstanding!! The meat is grilled just right--juicy but easy to bite into. The fries are so cute: cut into small pieces--smaller than any fries I have seen. But it is not like hash browns if that is what you are thinking about right now.  The second time I went there for celebrating my graduation! See? Special!! We ordered a lot this time: including the burger:)) haha! I like their platings-- not pretentious but still with taste. I will post some photos because it's been half a year since the meal, i don't remember all the names of the dishes we had.

We began our meal with a waiter who seemed fabulous, unfortunately it was time for him to take his lunch and we were stuck with another.. Service, for me, is a Huge part of any dining experience, literally, McDonald's or Fleur de Lys, could be ruined or championed by their service. I dont like any dining experience (aside from the longish Coursey McCorseyson snooty ones) to take more than 2 hours.  As for the Foodstuffs;  For our starters I got the French Onion Soup and it was the *best* I've ever had.. my boyfriend had the chilled corn puree which was very nice.   For our mains we had the pork confit and stuffed baked chicken.. both we fairly.. fair.   After our mains were finally cleared, we didn't have the patience to wait another half hour to an hour for desert, which I've heard, is quite good.  I may have built the place up too much before getting there.. I will go again for their bar, and will have to give it another go for brunch, but the dinner service for me is out.  Sadly.. \"Meh\".",

My dining experiences have been different - in terms of occasion, ambiance, and the dishes themselves - but there were all good, I've never been disappointed with this joint. \u00a0It's reliable, cozy and always satisfy my needs - whether it be just to catch a drink, go for a mimosa/brunch, or sit down for a good bistro-type meal.  Higlights:  1. I really love their bubbles and french wine (especially the Rhones) selection - seems pretty appropriate for a french-style bistro. 2. The absinthe burger - always fresh and hearty - make sure you had the fries to go with. 3. When it comes to the onion soup, Absinthe's onion soup is in the leading pack. \u00a0To me, it combines all of the tastes that I look for in onion soups - silky and sweet with a bit of nuttiness and tang. 4. I know that 7X7 raved about the Galapagos, but my real favorite is the sazerac. \u00a0I think that Absinthe does a better job than the Alembic... 5. The bar area - you just meet a lot of crazily interesting people there, including Eric the bartender himself. 6. \u00a0Attentive staff - they are so efficient and have deep knowledge on food and all the drinks that they serve.  Absinthe is a true institution in the Hayes Valley area. \u00a0It's a shame that I can't go as often as I want to (anybody has a vacancy that I can rent near Hayes Valley?)",

A drizzle of their syrup and you are good to go! -virgin bloody mary- really good, I can tell they use clam juice. Part spicy and salty, one of the better ones ive had- garnished with my favorite, green olives and picked mini pearl onion -french onion soup- really good, nice n hot- we were both fighting for this! -duck confit over poached eggs- really delicious, although the hubby complained it wasnt hot enough. the duck confit wasnt salty and paired really well with the crispy potato pancake beneath it and the richness of the runny poached eggs.

Started out with the hamachi crudo. \u00a0Fish seemed very fresh, and the vinaigrette on top brightened it up nicely, with the greens on top giving a nice crunchy contrast to the tender fish.  And then onto the liberty duck breast for the entree. \u00a0It was a coffee crusted duck breast cooked to a very nice and even medium rare. \u00a0Accompaniments were the apple-turnip puree, duck jus, sage and miscellaneous veggies. \u00a0This duck breast was fantastic. \u00a0Cooked just right, if you hadn't told me it was duck, I might've thought it was a well cooked piece of beef or lamb. \u00a0Very tender and juicy. \u00a0Puree was good, if maybe there wasn't enough of it. \u00a0Veggies were standard, I guess, but good.

I've never thought that frisee would make a good salad by itself, but wow, the runny yolk makes a fantastic salad dressing, and the house bacon goes so well with the whole salad.  The pan seared arctic char is just perfectly prepared and delicious. The skin is crispy, the meat so tender.   The dessert was kinda weird I must say....the mission fig crostata with fennel icecream. First of all, figs are out of season, not juicy and sweet anymore, so this dish is not successful because the figs are not great. The pastry shell was nice, but the whole pastry lacks of flavor. The fennel icecream was new to me, very interesting, my indian friend loved it.  If you like girl, sweet kind of cocktails, Citron lemonade is probably the only option you have here. All other cocktails are pretty strong, both in alcohol content and spicy flavors. Somehow most of them have some extra kick. So people either love them or hate them. Citron lemonade is the safe way to go.  Our waiter...he needs to sober up. The dude was weird from the beginning to the end.",

For dinner I ordered the Coq Au Vin which was perfectly cooked and the sauce was wonderfully rich. My boyfriend ordered the Duck Breast and Mac and Cheese on the side and he could not stop raving about both. The service was pretty good but nothing over the top and the atmosphere is quaint and not too loud \u00a0(the restaurant was only 3/4 full though) but basically the best part of the experience was the excellent food. Definitely recommend.",

    "review_text": "My luck must be changing for the better since my last review, because the last 2 times I have been to Absinthe, not only has there been a table (or spot at the bar) available, but the ideal table has been available! I think all the hostesses read what I wrote last year and are on a mission to make my life better.   That being said, on top of what I wrote last year, I've had more opportunity to try a variety of drinks from the cocktail menu, and have been impressed each time. Any establishment that makes up original cocktail creations and has numerous items that satisfy my every cocktail need and desire is a place I'm going to enjoy. It's also a place I should probably avoid on weeknights. In any case, the bar is stunning, and this is a perfect spot to get fancy, delicious drink with a friend, which is the primary reason for giving it the additional star.   I also was very impressed by their cheese selection. Cheese is kind of my thing. For the last 4 years I've carried a cheese list with me in my wallet at all times so that if I ever try a great new cheese, I can write it down. When I saw 2 of my top 4 favorite cheeses on the list at Absinthe (epoisses and la tur), I'm pretty sure I squealed. Loudly. Not only was the cheese delicious, but it was served with plenty of great bread and nuts so you actually felt satisfied by the end of it.   Again, my only complaint is the price. Great atmosphere and good food is certainly worth paying for, but c'mon absinthe, $16 for asparagus and burrata? Well, I guess if you have enough cocktails, you stop caring as much.",

I tried two of their entrees:  1. Grilled Steak Frites(mixed green salad, green peppercorn jus) 2. Roasted Mary's Chicken Breast (mascarpone polenta,rainbow chard, whild mushrooms, sweet onion jus).   My favorite is the Grilled Steak Frites. The marination of the meat blended so well the peppercorn sauce. They work together so well that stimulates your taste buds, at the same time, the meat was tender and juicy.   If I have to say one bad thing about this place is probabily gonna be its location. Parking is definitely a concern. So plan accordingly. \u00a0Besides that, I am looking forward to going back and try more food from the menu.",

We were told it would take until 8pm to get a seat for our party of 9. We received 1 text that our table was ready, almost an hour earlier than we were told at 7:03. We bolted back to the restaurant, and got there by 7:09, but the hostess said she had called and texted 30 minutes prior. 1) this was 90 minutes earlier than we were told we could be seated, 2) we received NO CALL and the text was at 7:03. Even if it was a technology mishap, she acted as if we were lying even when we showed her our phone log. Neither hostess was willing to try to accommodate us, in particular they refused to put us back on the list. Maddeningly rude, and we took our $$$ ticket to a restaurant that is staffed with sweet and welcoming people. I'm sure Absinthe doesn't really care that we left and made their night easier by getting rid of a large party, and likely (unfortunately) they will do just fine in the future, but they lost 9 customers permanently tonight, and everyone we can tell about them. I work in food service and there's a lot of things that can be difficult or out of my control on a given day, but how I treat customers is fundamental to my job and there is never an excuse to be condescending the way this woman was.

They weren't serving brunch :(, a bit disappointed, but I guess they only serve that on weekends. We ordered a bowl of their french onion soup ($9) , a side of their brussels sprouts and squash with feta ($7), and we shared the Absinthe Burger ($15) with mushrooms and gruyere chese ($1.50 additional each).   Food was amazing. The french onion soup is absolutely delicious and a must order. The brussels and squash were a perfect side, and a side it is, portion is extremely small. But the brussels and squash were cooked to perfection and the feta cheese was a great touch. There was a puddle of oil left at the bottom of the dish when we were finished, a bit unappetizing. The star was the burger. Since they knew we were sharing, they cut the burger in half and served them on separate dishes for us and even split the fries. A very nice gesture. The burger was extremely juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare. What I hate most is a dry overcooked burger patty. But this was the complete opposite. The bun was soft yet toasted just on the outside. The mushrooms and gruyere cheese were a perfect touch.  The food was delicious, but when we received the bill, this meal was $44 for 3 dishes, 2 of which were sides. Pretty pricey. Expect to splurge a bit. It is definitely not a daily dining place.  They do offer an entire list of drinks. It's a great place to dine and drink.  Service was just as amazing as our food. Our waitress was very nice and informed us of all the specials of the day. She was very friendly and brought us waters immediately. She checked on us frequently especially since it took us a while to decide what to eat. She brought out the soup and side first. When we were done with our appetizers, she brought out our burger. Our waters were never left empty and refilled very often. When we went to go to the bathroom, she would come by and fold our table napkins.  My first time dining here was a brunch experience. We came later and I guess we beat the brunch rush since we were seated immediately. I remember ordering a benedict which made an everlasting impression, which led me to revisit Absinthe another time.   They have seasonal pancakes on their menu. Which I will definitely have to try next time for brunch. I definitely would recommend coming for brunch as they have more appealing dishes on their brunch menu than their lunch menu in my opinion.",

The day before the family was exhausted from dealing with the Big Bus Tour and Sausalito. I hooked up with a friend that I know from World of Warcraft. We were heading to Lers Ros Thai but we got across the bridge way faster then we were expecting and need to burn time while we wait for him to show.   I am a fan of Absinthe youtube videos. And that makes me a fan of Absinthe. So while walking and seeing a bar called Absinthe I was sold!!  First thing I noticed was the smell. It smelled like old feet. Or Cheese.... old cheese. Or maybe feet cheese if that is a thing. I am not looking it up to find out. Smell and all it is the kind of place you want to go if you like the bar atmosphere. Unfortunately I had the kids and wife with me so there was no tomfoolery this time. At this point I was realizing that I have to make a road trip with the crew to San Francisco.   It seemed that everywhere you look there was a bar. And bar serves beer, and I drink beer. That is a match made in something... I am sure  But back to this place, you don't go to a Bar called Absinthe and not order Absinthe. Family with you or not, you have to bite the bullet!!!  I do not know what I ordered. It was good, a mix drink with absinthe I am told. I doubt it was the worm wood kind... but it was tasty. I didn't get a buzz though, and I can't find the drink in the menu that is listed online, so I can't tell you what it is called. Wifey ordered the Perfect Pear and enjoyed it. We ordered apetizers since we were eating somewhere else.   **Update** While looking through my phone I realized that I actually took a picture of my drink and the Absinthe Cocktail menu. (I couldn't find the Absinthe Cocktail drink menu on the website) I got the Corpse Reviver #2. They don't have #1. Maybe the drink was too strong, or maybe they got better at making the Corpse Reviver and called it #2... or maybe they don't have all the ingredients to make Corpse Reviver #1. And probably the obvious option, there never was a #1!!! It was good, I like lemon juice so I chose this one. The menu had over 14 Absinthe to use from. I figured the mixed one was safe with family.... i will be back!!!***  French Fries with smoky ketchup. It was good. Hard to ruin fries really. It happens but not here.   Soft Garlic Pretzels with Vermont Cheddar Mornay. Also a good think to eat with a beer. I didn't get a beer.... I really need to make a return trip.

Looking around, there were sooo many options so I pulled out my handy-dandy YELPbook aka my phone! Seeing as this place had over 2k reviews, why not?! Upon walking by, I see (I really do mean SEE, not TASTE) really fancy looking drinks in cute glasses (IT LOOKS SO GATSBY-like to me, I lahhhh it!) and of course, I knew I wanted to order that pretty looking drink.. Waited about 15 minutes for a table and then the shenanigans began....  1. GALAPAGOS - A guava flavored cocktail. Much to my tastebuds, it was quite refreshing but you can tell the alcohol was hidden in there SOMEWHERE. Ended my sips with 3 brandid cherries at the end, yum.  2. GINGER ROGERS - If you like Gin and Tonic, this is definitely the way to go. Taste just like a soda with a minty, lemon flavor!  3. PERFECT PEAR - A delightful, sweet tasting cocktail. Almost as if I was drinking a dessert wine.  4. CORSPE REVIVER #2 - DEAR GOD, NO. No. No. What a pretty looking drink, but ehhh, my taste buds and liver was not feeling it. The taste was just disgusting to me but I guess you can't always get a nice, sweet, tasting, cocktail...  As for our food order, we went with many appetizers...  1. THE SOFT GARLIC PRETZEL - Really strong garlic flavor.. tiny but hey it's pretzel. BRING ME MORE.  2. FRENCH FRIES - Honestly, you can't go wrong with french fries... it was thin cut shaped fries served with 2 sauces: the aioli and a bbq ketchup flavored sauce.  3. BEEF TARTARE - MMMMS, the garlic bread chips served with this was YUMS. Not spicy to my tastebud, but my friend thought it was a little.  4. PEI MUSSELS &amp; MANILA CLAMS - MMMMMS, LEMON &amp; CHARDONNAY sauce... DEFINITELY must get!!! The mussels and calms were savory and absorbed the sauce really well.  Overall, I had a good time but looking at the menu, I probably would not come back for dinner. Just happy hour/the bar area/ and to try their breakfast menu.",

When I arrived with my boyfriend for brunch one Sunday, there was no host there to greet us. Whatever, I figured we could wait. It got awkward though the longer we stood there - you'd think that one of the servers or busboys or other staff wandering around us would say something! Even something small like \"someone will be right with you\". That was annoying... and awkward, but I already said that.  When we were finally seated, the man who served us was very friendly and attentive, and he was knowledgeable about the menu. There were some terms I was unfamiliar with since they were in French, so it was nice to see that he knew what he was talking about.  I opted for the squash pancakes, which were really good, but very sweet. The portions seemed a bit smaller than expected at first glance, but this was not an issue since the food was very full of flavour. The duck ragout - which my bf got - was also very tasty.  All in all, some parts of the experience were fab and other parts I would hope to omit next time. I've heard this place is good for dinner so I think I'll be back sometime to try it out. Bit pricey, but that's fine since this probably isn't a place I would frequent very often - I like the atmosphere more for \"special-er\" occasions :)",

    "review_text": "first time last night...and the food was great but what won me over for the 5-star rating was the service. everything was pretty much on point. nice, helpful waitress, efficient support staff, and food came out in a timely manner.   there was only two of us, but we tried to sample as much as we could stuff ourselves with...starting with a wonderful FRENCH ONION SOUP GRATIN\u00c9E \u00a0that is probably in my top 3 possibly top 2 FOS ever. The FRIS\u00c9E baby leeks, lemon vinaigrette, house-smoked bacon,fried duck egg, fines herbes, caviar was also very good with the bacon chopped chunky enough to really have a bite to it. The FENNEL &amp; MARINATED ARTICHOKE FLATBREAD shaved onion, Persian fetta, cerignola olives, roasted garlic was probably the only miss that night. While okay, I felt the artichoke overwhelmed everything else.   For our entrees, I had the much talked about ABSINTHE HAMBURGER Marin Sun Farms ground beef, a\u00efoli, baby lettuces, red onion, house-made pickles with smoked gouda and fried egg added for $1.50 ea. And my friend had the LIBERTY FARMS DUCK BREAST black garlic farro risotto,swiss chard, red curry carrot pur\u00e9e. We both enjoyed our mains, and I have to say that I really appreciated the chargrilled flavor on the burger. It is probably the first restaurant burger where I got that taste of a burger cooked on an outdoor grill. That being said, it's not my fav burger of all time, but I'd put it in my top 5 at the least. The bun, while tasty, couldn've held up better. I was reduced to putting it down and eating it with my fork and knife before the half way point.   We had to also have dessert so we got the CHOCOLATE BREAD PUDDING Candy cap mushroom ice cream, Nutella, coffee gastrique and a fruitier dessert that I can't remember but also liked. The Chocolate bread pudding wasn't quite what I expected and while I thought the whole flavor composition was good, it was more cakey than I was hoping. I guess I just prefer a more traditional approach to bread pudding.   Absinthe definitely deserves a return trip. I'm hoping to try their brunch next which my co-worker raves about.",

    "review_text": "Came here for a friend's birthday a couple weeks ago. It was packed on a Saturday night, and valet was worth it (when is it NOT worth it in SF?!).   We were served a couple of a couple of amuse-bouches. One was curried chickpeas and olives. Oh, we were also served bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, but tell me why they only dropped off a plate each of oil and vinegar to ONE side of the table? By the time it made its way to our side, there was nothing left.   First course: pretty much a Caesar salad or French onion soup. Both were delicious and I really liked the salad--even with the anchovy on top! My only qualm was that they only served the salad with ONE anchovy! They were actually pretty good and I ended up eating the whole thing before trading with my SO and then realizing there was only one...whoops. The French onion soup was good. Nothing to write home about.  Second Course: (So...I don't remember exactly since none of the dishes really stuck out to me, but...) there was a Vadouvan risotto (vegetarian), halibut, and pork. I was able to try all three (I got the halibut for myself), but the pork was the best, I think. It was very tender and delicious.  Third Course (dessert): A some sort of deconstucted cheesecake or some nectarine or peach sherbets. I ordered th cheesecake, which was OK. It had a taste that wasn't too my liking. The sherbets were not so good. I'm glad I didn't order it, but people at our table liked it. *shrug* They were a little too tart for me and the scoops were huge.  This was a lame review, but it's because I honestly didn't really like the place that much and if I did, the dishes would stick out in my brain much more.  Again, nothing to write home about, but it's worth a try...",

The food was great, but not so great as to warrant such a steep bill. Well... I went back with friends on Friday and, either something has changed /or/ I was desperate for a good meal, because gosh-darn-it if that wasn't totally worth every penny.  In addition to two delightful cocktails and some friend chickpeas, I ordered the Slow-Cooked Pork Confit. The pork was flavorful and tender, no knife required, place atop a gooey bed of cheese grits with house made bacon. I inquired just how /house/ made the bacon really was, and it turns out they do not butcher on site... but the bacon was good enough that I am prepared to forgive them.  My fellow diners each order amazing dishes as well, but perhaps the dish most raved about were the Beef Cheeks. This particular diner tried them at my urging and after tasting remarked \"I didn't know meat could be this tender.\" Such is the amazing power of the beef cheek.  Absinthe, you've won me over...

This place was recommended by a friend who joined us, \u00a0we shared all the apps and the main courses, so we got to sample everything!   Appetizers  The roasted chickpeas- Good, light, very nice to munch on while we waited. Beef tartare - Bold Flavors, VERY delicious, man, I wanted to lick the plate, it was that good. We actually considered ordering another. Pork Belly - Can't go wrong with a good pork belly, \u00a0perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth good. Nom.   For dinner: First: Pork Skirt Steak - This ..it was good. It came with beans, \u00a0honestly pork and beans is a bit boring to me. \u00a0I'm glad we shared plates, this as my entree would have bummed me out. \u00a0 2nd: Roasted Leg of Lamb: I HIGHLY recommend this dish, \u00a0I cannot put to words how HEAVENLY this plate was. The lamb PERFECTLY seasoned, \u00a0cooked to a perfect medium rare, \u00a0the black garlic jus realllllllyy added to the lamb, \u00a0this was phenomenal. \u00a0 3rd: Wagyu Steak : Already you know you are getting a high quality dish, but man this was cooked to perfection, it didn't even need the sauce the meat had that much flavor. Apparently there was bone marrow, \u00a0I didn't see any so it must have been in the sauce. Either way, \u00a0a great way to end the entrees. \u00a0  For dessert, we \u00a0ordered the sorbets, the pot de creme, and the goat cheesecake.   Okay, so I got the pot de creme, but i had a bite of the goat cheesecake, \u00a0and damn, I wanted that immediately. Don't get me wrong the pot de creme is delicious, rich, and perfect for the chocolate lover, but the moment I got a bite of the cheese cake that was it. \u00a0Sold. \u00a0   The ambience was dark, very intimate, \u00a0I loved the decor and the dark finishes. \u00a0I had a great, great, time at this restaurant and will definitely come back for more the next time I find myself in San Fran :)",

The waiter was nice, kept winking at me, but I thought it was a little unprofessional when he moved some plates out of the way to put a dish down, he accidentally touched my fork. We both saw it and perhaps he was too embarrassed, but he did not bother replacing them. Watch out as you walk back from the bathrooms, there's a blind corner where servers come out of the kitchen and they get pretty angry if you get in their way. It's convenient to the symphony, but if you aren't going there, it makes parking a little difficult on those nights.  I would definitely go back for drinks.

Jessica P. and I shared an assortment of goodies. \u00a0The butter lettuce salad, not bad, standard simple salad. \u00a0The frites were excellent, light and crispy and not in the least bit greasy. \u00a0The fruit plate was good, it's pretty damn hard to mess up a fruit plate, and I liked how they had figs and papaya as well as the standard berries, grapes and pineapples. \u00a0The vanilla bean creme fraiche was an excellent touch and I wished I could order a tub of that stuff to bring home to bathe in it. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0  I had the soft boiled egg with sage croutons and that too, was excellent.  We also split the Wild Mushroom Goat Cheese Flatbread which, as well, was nice, crisp, non-greasy and delicious. \u00a0  I left brunch feeling not as disgusting as I usually feel after brunch. \u00a0This ain't no \"Chicken Fried Steak at the Pork Store \" kinda feeling. \u00a0There would be no food baby later. \u00a0  This was great news as we went to the 'burbs afterwards so I could try on bridesmaid dresses for my sister's wedding without feeling pregnant.  I have nothing bad to say about Absinthe. \u00a0I'm sad it took me 6 years of living in the city before going in and devouring a gourmet meal at reasonable prices. \u00a0Brunch, of course, is cheaper then dinner, so for a measly $3 more then Stacks down the street, you can get a better quality breakfast.",

Brunch: I had the DUCK-CONFIT RAGOUT, for such a small dish it was very heavy. The waitress was kind enough to split the entree so me and my girlfriend didn't have to share a plate.

    "review_text": "I've been threatening to go to this place for long time. I was in the mood for some french fries so I grabbed the missus and we headed out to Hayes Valley.  We frequent their little sister Arlequin and they have some awesome fries, so I had high hopes.  The fries met and exceeded my expectations. Very different than the fries at Arlequin. Arlequin has some sort of coating on them that makes them crunch and I don't even know how to describe them. They're divine.  Absinthe's fries are more of the shoestring variety, but are very potatoey and crunchy, yet there is some softness inside. Double fried, I'm guessing. You just want to plow through the whole bowl without stopping.  Oh, but they have other food, too. I had what I thought was a uniquely prepared chunk of rib meat from a cow (it was braised) and I scarfed that thing down like it was my last meal. I don't even recall what the wife had but it was also top notch. Their mac and cheese was delicious, despite the lack of truffle oil. Ha ha.  Absinthe is a bit pricey, but then everything in San Francisco is pricey. Absinthe won't be an everyday place for us, but despite the high price it is also high value. One of the best meals I've had in the city.  PS I see that some people here complain about the service at Arlequin. I can report that on our visit it was perfect. Attentive but not pushy. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu. I also noticed that service is a real team effort. A server delivered some dessert to a table near us and on the way out she glanced at our table and took some empty dishes with her on the way out. They were performing like a machine that night.",

Now this is where its an up and down review for this great place. Our waitress informed us that they don't serve their famous pretzels on Sundays until after 5:30, even after we explained to her how far we drove, she said no. None of the people in our party had a good vibe about the waitress, she would talk to us, but never smile and while talking she would just look somewhere else, it seemed like she didn't want to work that day, we noticed she was the same way with other guests. \u00a0We ordered the 3 different raw oysters (2 ea), they only have two, but they are SO GOOD. We ordered the spicy fried chick peas and the rosemary jam crispy potatoes, our waitress forgot the put in the orders, half way through our brunch, we reminded her about the chick peas and potatoes, she brought out the potatoes at the end of the meal, but not the chick peas. I had the open face sandwich with a fried egg, this was ONE OF THE BEST sandwiches I've ever eaten, UNTIL a fruit fly came crawling out of the sandwich. Now, its understandable that this does happen in restaurants, not their fault. Our waitress asked if I want to replace with something else, I didn't lose my appetite, but was on the borderline of being full and didn't want to waste another meal. \u00a0The manager apologized and took the sandwich off the bill. Our guests also had the Duck Confit, French Toast, and the Croissant, along with several cocktails. \u00a0Our brunch was outstanding, but after walking away, our guests had the same feeling, we wished our dining experience was a bit better, the food was great, but we don't like to pay for subpar services.",

Shaken &amp; served up with sunken brandied cherries.  So yes, based on the ingredients it's quite tasty and I can confirm that it's a good cocktail.

He scraped off about 2 tablespoons of the stuff before eating the burger.   The big fail of our meal was my open-faced Smoked Trout BLT. Again, someone was going crazy with the aioli in the kitchen. The trout itself was swimming it, creating a really unpleasant sloppy texture to the star of the dish. Under the trout was a so-so fried green tomato, then some tasty bacon, then lettuce, then a layer of avocado, then a slice of bread which got completely lost underneath all that stuff. And, oh yeah, there was a little pickled onion on top of everything, and the sandwich was accompanied by a nice salad of fresh greens -- also overdressed. Overall, there was too much going on, and it just didn't work.   With so many other great dining choices in Hayes Valley, we will not be visiting Absinthe again.",

I had a French 75 (champagne and gin, I think) as well as a couple rounds of Scarlett O'Hara (bourbon, Southern Comfort and...cranberry juice?) We kept the hunger at bay with their signature skinny fries and dipping sauce. I didn't have any absinthe; not a big fan.

Absinthe menu items scale between the $10-25/plate (above average). I would recommend this place for drinks and brunch because the social atmosphere and how close the spot is to other bars and other cool venues.  But back to Absinthe, I've like to note their brunch menu especially since it is so liked by locals and tourists alike!  I've had their french toasts, pancakes, and eggs and bacons - all excellent choices.  What I enjoyed about Absinthe was the attentive customer service and how the interior of the restaurant reminded me of a French Bistro in Paris- just lovely!  In conclusion, Absinthe is a great solid brunch option!",

Usually the wait is so long that we just sit at the bar (of course, it might not be so long if I ever called in advance).   Butternut squash soup is the best I've ever had, and this winter I tried butternut squash soups at over 10 different restaurants. Kale salad is also wonderful. My boyfriend had a steak or a pork loin or something that was also very good.  I can't say that the wait staff is the best I've ever experienced, but I like to sit and have long dinners so it's nice not having someone pestering us every 5 minutes.",

We grabbed a spot for brunch this Saturday before the rush and ordered up some sparkling cocktails (the bellini is excellent, btw) and futzed over the menu. \u00a0We made our selections and checked with our waiter to make sure we had chosen..... wisely.  We had! \u00a0We shared a cinnamon sticky bun that was buttery, flaky pastry covered in candied sticky walnuts. \u00a0YU-HUM. \u00a0My ricotta-stuffed french toast with berries and cream was amazing. \u00a0The two-and-a-half inch thick toast was brioche-y and had just enough crisp on it to withstand the syrup accompaniment. \u00a0The ricotta was perfect with the berry compote and spoonful of cream on the side. \u00a0I cleared my plate completely, carbs be damned!  My friends opted for the savory and their breakfast sandwich (huge slices of toast cradling an over-easy duck egg, spicy andouille, and salty cheese) and two eggs any style (with potatoes, toast, and bacon) were great to sample. \u00a0The duck egg sandwich was CRAZY rich. \u00a0The bacon, OH DEAR GOD, THE BACON.  This bacon was thick, chewy, crispy, and done just right. \u00a0It tasted like a campfire. \u00a0So perfectly smoky. \u00a0Best bacon I've ever had. \u00a0Ever. \u00a0Write that down.

Went with friends for brunch and amongst we got the Croque Madame, Egg white omelet, Croque Monsieur, some mimosas. There was definitely some butter indulgence in the food :) Overall good vibe and a good brunch experience. But nothing spectacular (probably for a vegetarian)  I believe for dinner we got the spicy fried chickpeas (good), the risotto (decent) and the halibut (good). I am not convinced the food quality is up to par for the price. The dining experience at other French restaurants in the city is much more appealing.",

We got there about 11:15 and it was really not crowded, which was awesome because by time we left, it was pretty packed. if you can, come early.   We got seated and the ambiance was great. The menu looked great so we decided to share a sticky bun and ordered fries for all of us to share. The sticky bun was nice and tasty, but the fries were cut very short that it was close to being hash browns. They came with 3 dipping sauces which was cool, but when you dipped these fries into the sauces, you are close to dipping your fingers in them. Did I tell you that we were sharing the fries? One thing they can change is have longer fries - knocked one star down.   We then ordered our meal...duck confit hash, griddled corn cakes, croque monsieur, and 2-egg any style with sausage. Everything tasted yummy, but nothing really stood out. It was like we could have gotten the meal from somewhere else. Also, they kinda messed up on one of the orders - my friend ordered the 2 eggs any style with the toast and potatoes, but he only brought out the egg and the sausage.

I needed to drop some fat and look good in general but the driver was my 20 year high school reunion. I've been so good at watching my treat intake that I've even surprised myself.  So, when my friend brought me here for brunch as a surprise, my initial reaction was \"Oh no! There goes my self restraint!\" But that quickly changed to, \"I should treat myself for being so good!\" And that was the start to a great day. I completely enjoyed and had whatever I wanted. It was all so delicious... One would think we were having dinner by how many courses we had: drinks, a starter, our entrees and then dessert and coffee.   We had reservations on OpenTable and were seated promptly in a cozy corner booth. I like the space, very airy despite the dark wood all around. The table was a little small and we were close to our neighbors--cozy but we didn't need to talk over eachother either.  Oysters with some bubbly was a nice way to get our appetites going. I was definitely ready for my Croque Madam (with the egg) -- oh it was so good. The bread itself was to die for. I don't even remember what the bf ate because I was so focused on my own plate. We also ordered fries (due to peer pressure) since everyone else had them on their table. Well worth it.  After savoring and eating all of my breakfast sandwich, I was ready for dessert. I had the figs and ice cream and bf had some cheeses. He was sooo happy. We both were.  So why 4 stars and not 5? Well, we had our dessert and then were kind of \"dropped\". People forgot about us and we had to call to someone to get water and coffee refill. It's like dessert didn't matter. And we had a show to go to, so we needed our check and couldn't find anyone--our waitress had disappeared.  Overall, the meal took about 1.5 hours with most of the lag from the dessert point on...

Funny thing is I pass by it all the time and see how packed it is with the pre-symphony crowd. Either them or the garden variety douches into volume level contests like a room full of Rob Fords. The bar scene is hopping even on a weeknight but with a discernibly older crowd like the mouthy overweight woman behind me wearing a beret. With her diffident male companion in tow, she kept wondering out loud when I was going to vacate the bar stool and kept heaving vodka-infused sighs hoping I'd leave. I didn't.  Yep, I was at the bar not drinking but looking to grab a bite since it's been such a long time. The menu didn't look hugely different from my last visit, standard French bistro fare with West Coast twinges of flavors (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1aLCnN7&amp;s=2a123aa846cc97b5ad21952a4161f2d905f76b42bf4ab05380cfe8349e463bac\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1aLCnN7</a>). I wasn't looking for anything fancy really, and I've had the burger once before, so... But before that, I was in the mood for a little starter thinking some mixed greens would be nice until my gaze targeted the $9 Crispy Skin Pork Belly, which were pan-seared slices with a maple glaze and a green apple &amp; Bosc pear chutney (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F17DFKv0&amp;s=f373ddf24c9e387cf5df4c7f2aae9ca778eec90796c930fef4e2a6daa28289a2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/17DFKv0</a>). It was good eating and ever so small a portion to justify being in the \"Snacks\" category on the menu.  As I was fending off the predatory breath of the woman with the beret, \u00a0I received the $15 Absinthe Hamburger, which got bumped up to $18 due to a couple of extra toppings I ordered, a fried egg and melted Gruy\u00e8re cheese. The medium-rare Angus beef comes from Storm Hill, and it came with baby lettuces, red onion and a slathering of aioli on a soft bun (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F181BeXA&amp;s=0669450e9ba843ef4ef92c4b75ed0684a025c3b71de25c51e873944cee95c16c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/181BeXA</a>). It was pretty satisfying for a bar-bite dinner, and it was surrounded by a passel of bistro-style French fries that were irresistible to finish (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F181BeXA&amp;s=0669450e9ba843ef4ef92c4b75ed0684a025c3b71de25c51e873944cee95c16c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/181BeXA</a>).

FOOD - 4 stars...the 2nd-best burger in Hayes Valley &amp; the pork belly is tasty, too AMBIANCE - 3 stars...nice bar (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F18GINxh&amp;s=c005748705085c33efe30b523011f5423a9b63dde301190e7eb77ecbedff9e38\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/18GINxh</a>)...quite a torrent of tourists and locals come into this darkened place, so the douche factor can be high SERVICE - 4 stars...quite attentive despite the distractions TOTAL - 4 stars...Absinthe may not make the heart grow fonder but it makes the belly grow fatter",

Unfortunately, they give you 5 which really annoys me when I am at a dinner of 2. THEY SHOULD GIVE YOU AN EVEN AMOUNT SO YOU CAN SPLIT IT EVENLY! \u00a0 Also, the garlic pretzels are delicious and you will definitely remember them...especially when you are going home to make sexy time and the aroma of garlic pretzel is in your face.

Started off with the French Onion Soup Gratinee ($5). Definitely savory. This soup would be magical for a hangover (at least for me, since I love ingesting sodium if I am recovering from a night of drunken debauchery). Wonderfully onion-y. Then I ate a Grilled Cheese &amp; Heirloom Tomato Sandwich ($14). One word: pesto. Pesto + mozzarella, who could hate that combination? Comes with a side of arugula salad. Ate the whole thing. We also had a side of Fries ($6) to share between three of us. The smoky ketchup was unique. In a good way. Ended the meal with a gorgeous Pumpkin Pudding (forgot the price). Pretty sure it was seasonal, and it definitely tasted as beautiful as it looked.   'Twas a wonderful dining experience, and I love Hayes Valley so the loc is a cherry on top. \u00a0I'll be back.",

Beef tartare - better than when I had it in Paris! Burrata - hands down our favorite dish of the night. \u00a0The burrata was super creamy and was complimented so well with the figs and flat bread it came with.

The cocktail list leans to the tad daunting side, but there's history about them, which makes it fun. The food in a single word was \"superb\". Done properly, great plate presentation and texture was fantastic. I wish I could remember exactly what I had off the top of my head what we had to eat that evening to tell more about it.   The reasoning behind the quartet of stars comes from my most recent experience with the place. It was an afternoon of soaking in what little sunshine we get here in the city, and in our stroll my friends and I decided to stop in for a bit of a cocktail hour before we went our separate ways for the day. \u00a0To be succinct, visit the restaurant for the cocktails they do, not for something you've had before. I thirsted for an Aviation, and my friend Wanted the Corpse Reviver No. 2. For the both of us, they were failures. I'm by no means a cocktail snob, but both of these are classics, with very distinctive profiles to them. I did contemplate the idea of sending the drink back, but in watching the bartender make it, their process was questionable at best. Creme de Violette is a finicky spirit to begin with, so a little goes a long way.   On a more positive note, our server was fantastic. She has the patience of Job, and our group really needed it.   Nevertheless, I will be back again, but for wine, lunch and dinner. Only on a night where I'm looking for a touch of absinthe to my drink will I give the bartenders another go.",

Service was a bit slow but perhaps that was because we kept peering through the menu when we were in fact ready to place our orders.   I ordered the Heirloom Tomato Grilled Cheese w/ macadamia nut pesto which had a side of house made potato chips and a cocktail. He decided on an order of 2 Eggs Any Style. My grilled cheese could have used a bit more cheese and the potato chips were crunchy, oily and cooked just the way I like it.   I'll need to come back to try their dinner menu.",

If you are just hanging out for a drink, try the Spanish coffee, and watch their skillful bartenders set it ablaze, and afterward you can still taste the smokey aroma from the drink.

Well all of the decor and pictures inside this place all have a touch of green or absinthe in them, and I am a big big fan of themed restaurants and bars, especially now that absinthe is finally legal in the US!!  And why else should you go here??? BEST FRENCH ONION SOUP EVER. I mean that. After going to Paris, and having what they call there \"onion soup\" because duh, you are in France, so you wouldn't call it \"French Onion Soup\" there! I thought I could never come across French Onion Soup that compared to the ones I had there, but Absinthe, you are now my one stop shop to bring me to French Onion Soup heaven. It is pure bliss. That cheese just melts in your mouth...every single morsel you want to savor...you even find yourself picking off some of the cheese that got baked onto the soup dish because it just is that amazing. I could eat their French Onion Soup every day if cheese didn't have that many calories. And the onion amount and flavor of the soup itself was just spectacular. If I had only had one bite of that soup that wouldn't be enough because once you start eating this soup, I promise you, that you not only will need to be prescribed some sort of medication because you will form an instant addiction to this soup, but you will find yourself completely content the rest of the day just for having tried this soup.  I feel like I don't need to say much more than that, but since I love food, and obviously you do too for reading yelp reviews here it goes. My Dad after biting into one of their in-house made pickles said, \"WOW\" and just stared at the pickle, thinking that maybe the pickle would do something magical since it tasted to magical in his mouth. He said it is the best pickle he has ever had, and let me tell you, he LOVES pickles. He was however, pretty disappointed in their crab salad sandwich...even saying that it deserved 2 stars which is pretty low for my dad....  BUT my french onion soup and my croque monsier sandwich definitely picked up the slack the crab salad sandwich left. My dad ate half of my sandiwch because that soup and sandwich had so much delicious delicious cheese in it, I got full pretty quickly! My brother LOVED his hamburger as well, but really fell in love with their french fries which have to be ordered on the side, but with different dipping sauces those bad boys are almost as addicting as the French Onion Soup is!  My mom got the crab legs and a salad and she left brunch that day saying how incredibly prefect that brunch was for her. How it was exactly what she wanted, and exactly what she envisioned. Although after one of those Death in the Afternoon absinthe cocktails, maybe we all enjoyed are food a bit more than the average person :-)",

He came to our table often enough, but not too frequently. \u00a0He was a nice, mild-mannered man who had great suggestions if we had any questions at all. \u00a0The cocktail list was amazing, my Atlantic char was cooked to perfection, and the sides accompanying both of our dishes were just as flavorful as our entrees. \u00a0Absinthe is my new favorite restaurant and I can't wait to go back. If you're looking for a less expensive night out, I've heard that their burger is one of the city's best. \u00a0The lively bar scene is also reason enough to come here - check it out.",

The hostess called my sister's phone, but she was standing right next to her and didn't notice her. My sister didn't hear her phone because we were inside RIGHT NEXT to the hostess, but she gave our table away anyway. I'm sorry, how do you miss a 5'11 woman with bright purple hair? We had to wait another 20 minutes or so just to get a table ready and by then it was 5pm and we had to leave by 6:15 to catch \"The Book of Mormon\" on time. The hostess didn't even say anything and she kept talking to the blonde lady with the side bun who continuously kept looking over at our table. Yes lady, you are not very slick when looking at people.   The waitress we had told us she would rush everything for us and would give us the bill after everything was put in. We waited about 15 min for appetizers and then it took another half hour for our meal to come. In the meantime my friend and I had ordered another drink after placing our food order, but it hadn't arrived even after we demolished the appetizers. We inquired about it and she blatantly forgot our drink order. She seriously said, \"Oh yeah..do you guys still want them?\" Well no shit we want them if our food wasn't there yet. By this time, my brother was not the most gracious, but that ticked him off even more.   I understand the restaurant was busy and that we had to be in and out very quickly, but I have never been so annoyed with people in my life. I'm the type of person who tries to be nice at restaurants 'cause you should never piss off people working with you food, but holy shit was I irritated.",

    "review_text": "Oh dear, when I think of this restaurant my heart just melts.  I went here two nights ago with my girlfriends to celebrate my friends' 25th birthday, and we ordered a couple of things. I tasted the: -cup of white asparagus soup -whole-roasted golden trout -beef tartare (the whole table shared this)  I have to say ever since I left this restaurant I haven't stopped thinking about the beef tartare. I'd never had it before, so I was a little unsure of eating raw beef, as well as tasting a bit of the quail egg yolk that topped the beef slivers, but oh. my. goodness. It was phenomenal! Really well seasoned, and had a stack of crostinis on the side. I'm sure beef tartare is generally really tasty, but Absinthe just steadied this standard.   Now, for the soup I got- so so creamy!! I'm not someone who normally orders asparagus, but this was off the charts! It was just perfect! The oil drizzled over the soup was a great complement, as were the delicious, perfectly toasted croutons that were placed in the middle. Just so warm, and creamy, but not too creamy. It really gave me the feelings a warm fireplace would.   The trout, erm...eh, was not great. Honestly, the trout on the plate wasn't really delicious but it was just blah..just okay. Everything else on the plate was the only thing that kept me eating the trout. Basically, there was a huge flavor imbalance between the trout, and the other things on the plate: the tasty mushrooms, haricots verts, (I believe it was asparagus) puree, and zingy lemon-beurre noisette. If not for those, I don't know how I would have been able to eat the bony, bony trout alone.   To add, I had a spoonful of the risotto, and that tasted pretty good too.  So. Order the beef tartare, but steer clear of the trout -very clear. Its not worth the mercury or the money.",

I had the Coq Au Vin for dinner and it didn't disappoint. It was excellent.  My GF had the Veggie platter, which I didn't think would be a great choice and it wasn't. It wasn't bad, but not mouth watering.  The waiter was awesome. Very nice, informative and caring about how our meal and experience was.  The only downside was how slow they bring your next course..  This is why I didn't give it a 5. I would def go back again if i Lived there.",

    "review_text": "The hostess was lovely; our server, Natalie, was uber professional; and the table busser was great. \u00a0Unfortunately, however, our brunch experience at Absinthe fell short in the food, beverage, and sanitation categories.  We both ordered a dungeoness crab sandwich and shared the dandelion green flatbread. \u00a0The flatbread was yummy, but the sandwiches were lackluster at best. \u00a0The fresh, flavorful heirloom tomatoes were the best part. \u00a0The fact they were more or less devoid of crab-yumminess was a bummer; but they were served on dry haogies, which was more disappointing. \u00a0  My boyfriend inhaled hoagie particles (from the inside of the bread) twice... you know, because it was the sort of bread that doesn't have enough substance to hold itself together or toast in a way that would yield a slight crunch or resistance as teeth meet crust. \u00a0Correct, there was no crust to speak of. \u00a0We agreed perhaps the downturn in the economy has forced Absinthe to Safeway's bread isle.   We both had a Bloody Mary. (No, we don't always order the same thing; he had coffee and I didn't ;) \u00a0The drinks came in 8-10oz glasses and must have been filled 3/4 with ice before they were poured. \u00a0There could not have been more than 4oz of liquid in them. \u00a0And for $9 each, that's kind of a joke. \u00a0But, more importantly, they were watered down. \u00a0  In my opinion, a Bloody Mary should be flavorful, meaty, and packed with a punch (flavor-wise) - not necessarily super spicy, but its gotta have zing! \u00a0And when it's the first thing I've had all day, I kind of expect a tiny buzz in my head or in my knees. \u00a0So, they were weak... and flavorless, and if you don't want to take my word for it, my boyfriend was equally disappointed and he's in the know... tended bar for 10 years at two well-known establishments in the city; and worked with Marco, who was the original bar manager and wrote the cocktail menu for... you guessed it... Absinthe! \u00a0Oh, and the Guardian voted one my man's cocktails Best in the Bay in 1998. \u00a0I digress...   The drinks were disappointing. \u00a0And so were the remnants of red lipstick on my water glass. \u00a0Ick.  Sorry Absinthe :(  Oh! \u00a0I should add, we did say something about the bread... and our drinks were taken off the bill. \u00a0We were very impressed - good business, but given 2 stars = \"meh, I've experienced better,\" we can't add a third for that. \u00a0We have definitely experienced better.",

My brother and I started with 7x7's 2011 ranked \"soft pretzels\"- which were nothing short of amazing in my mouth. They're great with or without the dijon-like dipping mustard, which proves the sauce isn't too powerful because I usually HATE dijon.  My father had the french onion soup and romaine hearts salad for dinner. He devoured them and claimed it was delicious! My brother, too, loved his \u00a0Absinthe Burger, and needed to be reminded that we were in a nice restaurant and to \"slow down!\" He seemed less impressed though with his fries, as he left most of them on the plate- which is rare for a boy of 19.  I ordered the duck with apple-turnip puree and a side of brussels sprouts. It was excellent! Tender, flavorful, and the puree was a true original. My sprouts were a solid size accompaniment and grilled up perfectly. Not only did I coax my brother to try the duck, but he exclaimed it was \"awesome!\" A true compliment from a boy who would only order \"the burger\" in the world's finest establishments.  This place gets hoppin' with an older crowd, and reservations are probably recommended. We arrived around 5:30 without one and waited a mere minutes before we were seated, however had we gotten there a half hour later I doubt we would have found a table.",

I went for brunch and I had blueberry pancakes-which I thought were seriously amazing, and an omelet...forgot what was in it :0)  I also had the absinthe lemonade and it was actually very bitter and sour, not sweet at all. The food came in a timely matter and hardly anything was noticeably bad.   BUT I had to park far and there's a convenience store close by with homeless people outside asking for change. One of them tried to scare me to and from absinthe :\\ not cool.   Oh and for anyone who doesn't quite know how to say absinthe in the french tongue , it's pronounced \"ab-sont\"",

    "review_text": "It was my first time eating at Absinthe Brasserie last weekend. I had heard from a few friends that the food was quite good and that I needed to check it out and I do not regret following their advice at all!   The food was very well prepared and SO flavorful. To be honest I hadn't had such a flavorful meal in a long time and it wasn't for not trying. We had the chicken liver mousse as an appetizer, then shared some gnocchi and the monkfish, and ended with a milk chocolate mousse dessert with salted caramel sauce that was to die for. I also ordered a pretty decent rhum cocktail that our waiter recommended.   The chicken liver mousse was really well made. It didn't have too strong of a liver flavor but still was plenty flavorful. The gnocchi could have been very boring as it seemed to be a pretty simple dish but it was amazing. The sauce had mushrooms and some herbs in it that just flavored the dish perfectly. The monkfish was equally good, although it had really different flavors. The fish was very fresh and served with a delicious potato mash. Although the portions didn't look plentiful, we had more than enough. I just wished I had kept some bread to dip in the sauces remaining from our dish.  I was hesitating in getting dessert as I felt pretty satisfied and from my experience sometimes dessert just ruins a good meal because they are not at the level of the savory dish. I took a chance with the milk chocolate mousse and I was pleasantly surprised. It was a perfect way to end the meal.   Service was also excellent. Our cute waiter was polite and smily and knew just when to come to the table.  I will spread my good word about Absinthe and hopefully get to come back soon!",

    "review_text": "I love my little bit of French in San Francisco. Absinthe is open late, serving primarily locals and the symphony crowd, and has wonderful prompt service. They tend to be quite busy around 11pm, so just make sure you don't mind waiting for a minute, but in my mind, those few moments it takes for them to clear a table is worth it.  Even food to go there is worthwhile in my opinion. I wanted to eat light, considering the time I was wanting to consume food (way too late for me to eat just about anything) and so I ordered two of their delicious sides. Roasted beets and a wonderful bok choy with a little EVOO and garlic. Sounded perfect. Except that when I went to use their restroom, the server came and found me, explaining that because their evening had been so busy that the beets were no where to be found anymore. I opted for their thin crust mushroom pizza instead. Carbs. Yeah, I know. Not ideal as one of my best girls would say. Just not ideal. But I was hungry, and at some dirty dive down the street. I was interested in some sort of luxury to balance my bizarre evening out.   The pizza was wonderful, light, thin, flavorful. Lobster mushrooms and goat cheese, with the perfect amount of each, piled (literally) onto a petite eight inch pizza, just perfect for one person, me. Salted greens adorned the top. I thanked the staff, said my goodbyes to those working there who have mutual friends, and began my brisk two block walk back to the bar, pizza in hand. I consumed most of it while walking, making sure to carefully shove it into my mouth while darting inbetween relentlessly crazy cabs, so as not to drop any of the salty sweet goodness. Love the back kick of the mushrooms after you've gotten through the cheese. Just really fantastic.  Walking back into the bar, barely any pizza left in hand, I sat down and began to drift back into the scene I had been previously engulfed in. Thanking my lucky stars Absinthe was there to quench my need for foodie satisfaction. I looked around and realized that without my salvation break of the pizza, I would have been slightly annoyed by now with the hipsters. But it's amazing what sixteen bucks will buy you these days. It bought me peace of mind.",

    "review_text": "I'm torn about dropping my review from 5 to 3 stars since I'm a regular at Absinthe and have been since I moved into the neighborhood 3 years ago. Since my first review, I have frequented Absinthe for cocktails and cheese and have probably tasted a good 80% of the cocktail menu by now, as well as stopped into too many times for dinner.  With the departure of two of their great bartenders and the (soon to be? already happened?) departure of head chef Jamie Lauren, a recent visit to Absinthe for dinner with friends this past weekend gave us a mediocre experience.  The cocktails were still very good, so I'm happy to say that the departure of two bartenders hasn't harmed Absinthe's reputation in that category! :)  We took ordered the marinated anchovy bruschetta as a starter since it was new on the menu - 2 orders since there were 4 of us and the waitress kindly warned us that one order was 2 slices. The beet puree smeared on the toast was far too sweet, almost like a jam and covered up any hint of the anchovy. The burrata that covered the top was even worse - bland, formless and tasteless - it neutralized the dish even more. We were all extremely underwhelmed and this was a huge disappointment since I have never had ANYTHING that underwhelmed at Absinthe.  We all ordered the french onion soup which is still good, but after my recent trip to Paris, I'm biased against American-made french onion soup ;)  Their were some new entrees on the dinner menu, but nothing that sounded tempting, so I got the pork confit, which I first reviewed 3 years ago and is one of my favorite dishes at Absinthe. Something went wrong. The pork wasn't tender and melt-in-your-mouth. The corn grits and shredded greens it sat on top were way too salty. Two of my friends got the perogies which were okay, but nothing to write home about. Other friend got the bass and he said that was okay.  I'm terribly disappointed that the food at Absinthe has taken such a dip in quality and inventiveness. I'm not sad to say I won't be recommending a dinner at Absinthe as a must for my visiting friends, nor will I be coming back here for dinner anymore.  Absinthe, you break my heart because you've simply become my cocktails and cheese stop in Hayes Valley :*( How will I replace you?",

By contrast, we don't go to the same nice restaurant for cocktails twice in the same 6 months back in Boston.   Drink wise note to others: Absinthe tastes like minty, burn-y, concentrated hatred.   While having a mixed drink with it sounds compelling at a place by the same name, pass on it unless you enjoy drinking hatred. If you do, good on you. Otherwise, get an incredible drink with a proper brown liquid as the main attraction and you won't be disappointed.   Two notes: anyone showing up for a meal and having sticker shock didn't go in with the right expectations. This place is not cheap. The meals were incredible however - not a dish had was bad. Make the date worth it by prepping for the price.  Last thought -- I went back and forth on the 4 to 5 stars. The drinks and food make it a 5, the layout is definitely a 5, but the service when accompanied by the price keeps it back down at a 4 in my experience.",

I won't say much about the food except that everyone finished their plates - and I mean everyone! (I was worried that some of the family friends who are older and only prefer Chinese food would not like the food, but clean plates everywhere!) The sea bass wasn't dry and came with amazing risotto, and as far as I could tell, everyone enjoyed the stuffed chicken and steak frites. \u00a0It was difficult to decide between the Chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me or the Cr\u00e8me brulee - but that's the beauty of sitting around friends: you get to order different things and share! \u00a0Umm, speaking as a chocoholic - the Chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me was like heaven in a bowl - YUMMY!

But it seems that there is a sudden rash of really awkward service wherever I lay my head (or actually, my butt in a chair or banquette). And I'm sorry to say that Absinthe, despite many wonderful years of food and drink, has been lately providing some itch to that rash.  A brunch reservation. A quick seating at an out-of-the-way corner table. A friendly welcoming server. But then....the dirty spoon with my coffee. The water glass with vivid lipstick marks. I sigh: it's a Saturday busy brunch, after all, I should cut some slack, right?  the cocktails come, and they are delightful. There is a little wait on one out of the three, but the waiter swings by to apologize. We toast. We sip coffees. We chat. We order.  And then we wait.  And wait.  And wait.  Now, I know there are always times when kitchen time and front of house time get out of sync. But when I wait a full forty minutes between placing an order from a three-top until our (very simple) orders come to table, I feel a bit miffed. Add to that the dirty spoon &amp; water glass, and I start to think: \"what is going on here?\"  The food was, as always, delightful: onion soup, frites, duck confit hash, smoked sturgeon, a cheese plate, all as delicious as always. And I can't say that the service was poor: our server was affable and accessible, although the lack of comment or action or apology on the wait was unsatisfactory. And when the couple at the table beside us was seated -- and served -- during the waiting period we had, it didn't help me feel great about things.  Nevertheless, I still love Absinthe. But I would love to know that the next time I come with a reserved table, I can assume my food will arrive before the next mealtime rolls around on the clock.  Food? Four tasty stars! Ambiance? Four comfy stars! Service? Two cranky stars!  Overall? Three gentle, long-suffering stars for Absinthe!",

And although I still appreciate their fine libations and food, I was less than thrilled by the snooty, apathetic bartenders working tonight. My friend and I saddled up at the bar around 5pm. After 10 minutes of being ignored by the bar staff, we finally asked for a cocktail/wine list. Even after our simple request, it took another 2 minutes or so for that to arrive. It's a bar with a famous cocktail menu, after all (don't you think they should have a few cocktail/wine lists on the bar?). After perusing their extensive beverage options, I finally ordered an Old Pal (sort of a variation of a Manhatten). The drink arrived a few minutes later and it was liquid perfection. These guys clearly know how to make great drinks.   But still... the service was so undeniably cold and detached. Not once did the bartender ask how we were doing or if he could get us anything else. Even when he delivered the drinks and we said thank you, he just sort of walked off. The too-cool-for-school attitude was really noticeable and really tarnished our whole experience. I'm paying $10 - $14 for a cocktail at your establishment. So don't make me feel like a jerk about it.  In any case, if you can stomach the cold service, I would still recommend coming here for a tasty adult beverage. And make sure you order some of their fried chickpeas. These tasty goodies are more addictive than crack.",

The service is spot-on. The cocktails are to-die-for (seriously, they have some pretty fly bartenders there). The brunch is fabulous, particularly the side of bacon. Seriously, I dreamt about it for many nights after.   I had the eggs benedict on corn cakes, and this hinted back to my mother's deliciously buttery corn cakes. The corn cakes actually stand up to the poached egg and hollandaise sauce better than english muffins, so I'm a new convert.  And don't forget the side of bacon. I certainly haven't.",

Cute as a button corner brassiere was packed to the rafters for brunch, but two seats at the bar opened up before we could even make our way to the hostess.   I started out with a Sazerac (what else would one drink at a place called Absinthe I ask) and my companion had a Bloody Mary. Both drinks were good. \u00a0  On the bartender's recommendation, I ordered the Duck-Confit Ragou and my friend opted for the Levain French Toast. Both were superbly executed and quite delicious. I especially liked the layered textures of the Ragou- crispy/crunchy cake, shredded duck, fluffy egg and creamy sauce. It was an excellent choice.  While my friend stuck with traditional cocktails, I explored the specialty menu. The Ginger Rogers was not nearly gingery-enough for me. It tasted like a gin mojito, but a good one at that. The 21 Hayes was a delicious, refreshing cucumber-gin concoction that I would order again in a heartbeat.  All in all Absinthe offered good food, drink and company on a busy Sunday. I'd definitely return!",

The service, while courteous, was extremely slow. \u00a0We had to wait for 35 minutes before the food was served. \u00a0Good thing we weren't in the mood for a long, leisurely brunch (save for the need to feed the meter) or we would've been terribly upset.

    "review_text": "i love this place!! great drinks and great food.  i initially came here for a private party they had appetizers and drinks. the food and drinks were so good for this event that i bookmarked it to come back for a true meal experience. so if you're looking for a venue to host a little party, they do a great job here! they even have a separate room/area with its own entrance to make it more private and quite than the normal dining hall.  i came a second time just for a drink. the bartender was very unfriendly and every unenthusiastic or helpful. when we asked what he recommended from the classic cocktails he gave us such a vague bland generic answer i should had just closed by eyes and pointed randomly at the menu. he seemed so bothered by us coming to the bar and ordering a drink from him i'm glad we only had time for one drink. i wouldn't want to have to spend a moment longer around this guy or BOTHER him anymore than we needed to. the drinks were fine. i wasn't as impressed as when i cam for the private party. we had old fashion and sazerac.  i finally came around a 3rd time to have a sit down dinner with drinks. IT WAS AMAZING.   Drinks: for drink i had the uptown manhattan. LOVED IT. i will come back just for this. one of the best manhattans i've had. my BF got an old fashion which tasted much better than the bar visit. maybe a different bartender?  Food:  french onion soup- BEST FRENCH ONION SOUP EVER. i dont even like french onion soup. for two reasons 1) most are super salty 2) the cheese is usually one giant chunk and not that great. absinthe knows what their doing when it comes to french onion soup. ORDER IT. TASTE IT. LOVE IT. and do it all over again YUM  beef tar tar- very fresh with an egg on top. not super flavorful when it comes to herbs and spices etc. but just the right balance so you can enjoy the fresh ingredients.  garlic pretzel- this was good but not great. i wouldn't say its a must order. i could go to the mall courtyard and get a pretzel. but the sauce was yummy to dip with!  osso bucco- SUPER YUMMY and tender. they even give you a little special utensil so you can dig out the marrow from the bone and enjoy that as well. DELISHHHH highly recommend   coq au vin- had no idea what to expect when ordering this because i've never heard of it before. but when it came out it was like a chicken stew? came in a iron pan with lots of gravy/sauce surrounding it. it was great to eat with some bread. really flavorful and had unique flavors that i never excepted. if you're looking for something saucy. order this!  burger- the fries were really good. this tasted like a really yummy gourmet burger. i was so full from eating all the other food that i couldn't finish the burger. i took half of it home and ate it for lunch a couple days later and it was still good. the patty is really well seasoned and full of flavor and the bun was soft and yummy. i just got it plain with no added toppings and that was plenty burger enough for me.   overall i really enjoyed the dining experience i had here. highly recommend making a reservation as this place is very super busy. especially because its near all theatre, symphony, etc. definitely a MUST TRY and wanting a good meal with a good classic cocktail  i would give this place 5 stars if the bar experience was as good as the dining experience. i saw previous yelpers mention that they also had a not so awesome bartender. minus 1 star for the bartender  I WILL BE BACK!

Foodie details:  The braised beef cheeks were tasty, as was the lamb. \u00a0My pork confit, however, was the acknowledged winner on the table. \u00a0Wifey's mushroom pasta was a distant fourth---it felt like a halfhearted attempt to put something vegetarian on the menu. \u00a0The cheese selection is excellent, although the firmer cheeses were clear also-rans to the soft cheese selections. \u00a0The frisee and the country pate were amazing, and Wifey raved about the French onion soup, which is apparently a house specialty.  Unnecessary personal details:  Wifey and I went with another couple who we've known for some time, and who happen to be reverse negatives of Wifey and I. \u00a0To wit, with respect to the other couple: the wife is a lawyer and avid horsewoman, funny as hell, loud, and occasionally uncouth, while the husband is quiet, sharp as a whip, and sneakily funny in his own right. \u00a0In short, transgendered versions of Wifey and I. \u00a0Sorta.  This couple has such a long history with Absinthe that the sommalier knows their taste in wine. \u00a0In contrast, it was our first time. \u00a0I certainly understand the allure, and the food was excellent. \u00a0I continue to struggle with the classic SF conundrum: at this price point, there are literally dozens of excellent restaurants in this city, and I would be hard-pressed to explain what differentiates those restaurants, or why one would go to one such restaurant instead of another. \u00a0There are also scores of restaurants in the city that are far less expensive, but serve food that is only moderately less fantastic, and I often wonder if you're really getting your money's worth dining at pinnacle restaurants.  In typical lawyer fashion, I raise these issues not because I have a solution for you, but rather to ensure that you, too, are aware of these problems. \u00a0What you do to resolve them falls into the realm of \"business strategy,\" and I wouldn't presume to tell you which resolution to take. \u00a0As your counselor, it's my job to ensure you have all the information you need to make a fully informed decision, not to make the decision for you. \u00a0You'll get my extremely reasonable bill at the end of the month. \u00a0As always, call me anytime if you have questions.",

And honestly, how many places take brunch reservations for 12??  French food for brunch is vindicated!  --------------------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------------  This review is for brunch only...  I LOVE brunch but I love a meaty, hearty brunch. \u00a0And after this experience at Absinthe, I realized that French brunch/breakfast just may not be right for me. \u00a0So, the cuisine probably drives my review more than anything. \u00a0I found no problems with the service and found it to be quite nice. \u00a0The brunch menu (items with a stronger egg orientation) was relatively limited, and there were no brunch items that seemed particularly compelling. \u00a0So I was then forced to move into the lunch category (sandwiches, salads and burgers); sandwiches (even a Croque Monsieur) can be on the small-ish/light-ish side for me, so I went with a burger. \u00a0I was quite disappointed with the burger which I found to be mostly bun (and a greasy, focaccia bun at that) and without much burger. \u00a0My friend who I brunched with was not very impressed with her runny eggs and sausage.  On the positive, places that take brunch reservations are always nice if you have a large group. \u00a0And the place is nice and open.  I probably made two tactical errors - I should've had a champagne beverage (seems as though there was a wide selection) and fries (I had them ages ago and they were delicious). \u00a0  I'll definitely go back for dinner; French food for dinner is very different from French food for brunch.",

For starters we got the country pate and persimmon salad. \u00a0The pate was very hard and didn't seem like it was just made, I also could not taste the apricot that was supposed to be in it and what prompted me to order it. \u00a0The salad was underflavored, not much more else to say here.  The beef cheeks were amazing, very tender and full of flavor, the sweet potatoes with them were smoky and very aromatic but undercooked. \u00a0 The scallops were good, the sauce and mushrooms were amazing but they were a bit tough, I've had them more tender and that was what we expected. \u00a0  We had coffee and no dessert, the coffee was good, and hot which I like, some places just give you something that's just warm and I hate that. \u00a0  The service was good but a bit rushed, the bus boys were coming by all time to clear the table which was a bit annoying. \u00a0  I still love this place and would come back, but the execution on some of the dishes needs to be better.  Came here for brunch twice and loved it, a great place to get some amazing drinks and creative food for brunch. \u00a0The menu definitely leans towards foodies with elegant and complex dishes that still are perfect for brunch.",

    "review_text": "To celebrate our 5 year anniversary yesterday, we started with brunch here at Absinthe. We've been wanting to come here for a while now based on the reviews from Yelp. It came as a pleasant surprise seeing the executive chef Jamie Lauren on Top Chef (one of our favorite shows). Because of that, we've been rooting for her because if she does good, then you know the food here has to be good. Good thing she's been doing awesome in the competition so far. We were really hoping we'd be able to meet her because she's been our favorite competitor. Gotta represent the bay!   For starters, I would totally recommend the French onion soup. After reading the reviews here on Yelp and smelling the order of the table next to us, it was a definite must order for me. Hella good! It was really hearty and covered in cheese. How can you not love cheese? Every spoonful was like a cheezy scoop of ecstasy. We also had the pommes frites (fries for the layman's). Frites were aight, they're just expensive fries to me... For our main course, I had the croque monsieur (based on your Yelp recommendations) and Amy W. had the duck confit hash with poached eggs. The croque was the shit. Again, cheese = pure goodness. The Gruyere hit the spot. I don't care if a croque monsieur is just an overpriced grilled ham and cheese sandwich, the croque here was delicious. The duck confit has was good, but couldn't hold a candle next to the croque.   Towards the end of our brunch, to our surprise, Jamie Lauren came out and ended up sitting at the table next us and was chattin' it up with the people there. Soooooo cool. Not that we were trying to ease drop but we couldn't help it. She couldn't say much about the show because of a confidentiality clause, darn. I wanted spoilers. We ended up talking with her a little bit before we left and of course took a pic. She was totally cool.   So, awesome food and we got to meet Jamie. How can you top that?",

We went here after seeing the Nutcracker, and this was the perfect spot -- except for the fact that at least a dozen other people also mozied in after the Nutcracker.   The food was great, and they let us order off the bar menu from the dining room. The French Onion soup isn't something to joke about, it's really, really good. The Brussel Sprouts were good too, and you could really taste the bacon.  I would give them five stars, save for:  - The waiter taking away our wine glasses after asking if we want water. Wine and water can be complementary! - The french fries being really hard to eat -- they're really small. Though note the dipping sauces for them were great.   All around good place though. I'd definitely go back.",

So first off, $18.95 for a two-course meal is such a steal, especially for a nice restaurant like Absinthe. I ordered the croque monsieur already knowing that probably wasn't worth my money but my friend ordered the pork tenderloin and the other choice, some pasta dish, did not seem appealing to me at all...  Sandwich tasted good, but I could have gotten that elsewhere for cheaper and just as good. Pork Tenderloin was a different story. It was like magic in my mouth... I totally regret not getting this but I didn't want to order the same thing as my friend. Apparently the pastry chef is top 10 in the nation... and the apple pie panna cotta was just \"pretty good\" for me. Again, I think it's just a preference type of thing. I'm not a huge fan of apple pie, and the dessert was like a deconstructed apple pie. \u00a0I mean, if it had chocolate, I'd probably go crazy.

I brought my boyfriend here for dinner on his birthday and all of the food was absolutely delicious (and great for a vegetarian like myself.) and we loved the drinks (their Sazerac was amazing).  Although it is an up-scale restaurant, you can still manage to have a dinner for two with appetizers, drinks and dessert for under $100, which is quite less than I was expecting to spend. Unfortunately, the service was not as impressive as the food: I had made reservations and it still took them 45 minutes for them to seat us even though a handful of people walked in and were sat immediately. It wasn't until my boyfriend asked how much longer it would be that they finally sat us.  I'm not sure if it was because my boyfriend and I are in our 20's and he thought we weren't going to tip well, but our 'waiter' was completely inattentive and kind of short with us. It took him at least 10 minutes before he even got to our table and when he did he never even came to check up on us or see how we liked our food. Overall I guess I would say the food and drinks are well worth the price but don't expect to get adequate service if you are young and middle class. I'll probably still end up going back because the food was delicious.",

The puree added the slight sweetness needed to accompany the lamb. The meat was tender, not gamey and cooked just as I ordered - medium rare. The pork dish came with beans and seemed a little dry. For the most part, the food was OK. From what I've heard, I guess I expected more, wasn't impressed. Coming back again to try give their brunch menu a try.",

    "review_text": "I was totally ready to 5 star this place even before eating here. I LOVED Jamie Lauren when she was on Top Chef and was heartbroken when she got eliminated. So having said all that, I was very disappointed that I wasn't impressed by this restaurant, especially since I picked it for my birthday.  French Onion Gratinee - Everyone on yelp seems to love this soup. Jamie was known to make great soups on Top Chef so I had to try this one. I'm happy that it was well seasoned. So many times French Onion can be too salty. I loved that there were strings of cheese through the soup and the bread went well with it. I'd say it was good, but not amazing.  Slow Cooked Pork Confit - served with butter beans, bacon, wilted nettles, and roasted tomatoes. I really wanted the scallops but the patron sitting next to us ordered it and it looked pretty small. I decided on the pork and after one bite, I regretted my decision. The pork was dry even though it still had a good amount of fat on it. How did this happen? The beans and even the BACON couldn't help. I was so sad!   Grilled Hereford Ribeye - served with celery root puree, baby root vegetables, and bone-marrow butter. This was a generous piece of beef but for $32, it would be tragic if it was small. It was cooked well and still juicy and flavorful because of the amount of fat on it, unlike the pork. Jamie is also known to do purees well and this one was good. The celery root puree was exactly what I'd imagine her making on Top Chef and so it was the highlight of the night.   Buttermilk Panna Cotta - with a meyer lemon gelee, huckleberry compote on top, and lemon thyme tuile. The gelee was really sour especially for a dessert that I couldn't actually concentrate on any of the other flavors. The huckleberry compote looked and tasted just like mashed up berries. We scraped the gelee off and focused on the panna cotta. It was much better towards the bottom but still not memorable. We enjoyed the chocolate sauce that spelled out \"Happy Birthday\" a lot more than the actual dessert.  Maybe it would have been better if Jamie was actually there that night? I checked their website and it said she was in Miami for the South Beach Food and Wine Festival. =*(",

    "review_text": "Absinthe is where many of my relationships have begun and ended. One of my first real dates was here and as such, Absinthe has gained the reputation of being the place I go to get my heart ripped out. Yet...I keep coming back. Stupid or nostalgic? Your call.  I have fallen in love, fallen out of love, argued loudly, cried quietly, hid in the bathroom, serenaded my lover, and dumped wine on my date at this little gem. Every boy I've ever dated, loved, lost, slept with, regretted sleeping with, or considered falling for has had his moment (or moments) here. At least I'm consistent.   There's the cocky surgeon with bad table manners, boy who only eats caesar salads and french fries and says things because they sound good in the moment, there was the doctor that never took his eyes off my chest when he talked to me about how smart and funny I was, there was my first love who had the red sports car and leather pants, there was the guy who I adored but was married (talented liar, too), the winemaker, the lawyer(s), the dj...you name it, it's taken me to dinner here.  I love Absinthe so much that all the bad date juju in the world can't stop me from returning again and again. Sipping champagne at the \u00a0bustling bar is a great beginning or end to any night. Brunch is outstanding, small plates are to die for. The burger is one of my favorites. The upbeat atmosphere and pleasant waitstaff are huge pluses. There is always a fabulous prosecco or cava on the menu.  Absinthe is an institution. I think it's where I left my heart. If you'd like to make a reservation, I will gladly meet you there. Unless you're married. And if you see me here, feel free to interrupt. I'm probably on a bad date.",

I did apps and drinks with my little sister this past Friday night and we had a fantastic time. Our server KICKED A$$ - great suggestions, had the right balance of letting us enjoy our evening vs. being attentive, and pleasant to chat with.  COCKTAILS I had the Wonderlust, she had the Covered Wagon. These aren't your grandma's drinks - be prepared for booze :) Flavors were great - mine had just a touch too much absinthe for my taste, but maybe my tastebuds were just overpowered to that flavor that night, because I could tell there wasn't much in there. These, if nothing else, are the reason you come here - tear this drink menu apart! These drinks will cost you $15+ at the closest thing to it in Chicago...  APPS Caesar salad w/ homemade dressing - fantastic Spicy pork meatballs - are the BOMB - I could eat these every day We hit up a cheese plate - Big Woods Blue (I've had better blues), the Flagship (tasty firm cheese) and the Hudson Valley Camembert, which is creamy like butter. Like the meatballs, I too could it this every day. In fact, I could eat this on top of those meatballs. (looking at you chef - make up a dish with those ingredients!!)  Whenever I visit SF again, you'll always be on my radar. Two visits, two great experiences.",

We wanted a restaurant noted for food, ambiance, and service - this appeared to be the one. I relied solely on Yelp reviews - which is a safe bet for the most part; except this is that one big exception.  Before I tell you about anything, the food is spectacular here. The Butternut Winter Squash Bisque was impeccable and my french onion soup was beyond all my expectations (they actually make it themselves, they don't make it from some concentrate like most other places). The main dish that my wife was great - a bit rich and overwhelming. The burger I had, great... but I've also had burgers as great at dive bars (in fact, the dive bars have way better burgers). Desert... oooohhh, didn't even make it to that point.  While the food is good - that's all I can say. The service would be complemented at the mention or note of them being Aloof. Perhaps I'm being too polite, inconsiderate, maybe better. We were the first peopled to be seated in their dining area and showed up ahead of time. Other people quickly occupied the rest of the area. Our appetizer was provided relatively quickly. Afterwards, we waited for 35 minutes... and waited. All other tables filled, they had already been served their appetizers and given their main dishes... we waited. It was then we had to hail down another server (not our waiter/waitress) that we inquired if we will ever get out food for the night. Ah ha, within 2 minutes we had our food. Finishing up our food knowing the glaring lack of service. We went to finish up - there are a few other things we could have requested... oops, couldn't request them at all as the waitress never checked up on us at all. So much so, our empty plates lay in front of us until some unrelated individual came and picked them up. At this point our mood had soured to a point in which we wanted to get desert... maybe that'll cheer us up. Being given the desert menu, we had to wait for another 30 minutes until they returned to ask \"what do you want.\"  Knowing the hostile situation, we gave our credit card and asked for the check promptly.   I'm sorry, this is the one time I will be the worlds most horrible tipper - I have have had impeccable service at IHOP... but this place leaves so much to be desired.  I will never ever set foot in this establishment. For food with nothing to make it stand out and service that is by far the worst service I have ever experienced in my years.... never.  I wish them well in ruining other people's nights.",

I vowed to try her restaurant as soon as the show ended, and I finally made it out there for brunch this past Sunday. Both B2B and the Giant's game were going on and yet somehow, I found a parking space within a block of the restaurant, so it was meant to be that I try this place out.   In my mind, Absinthe is the definition of a classy French bistro. The walls were adorned with hand paintings and the tables were dressed perfectly in long white linens. The service even matched the ambiance as I had a pretty handsome, European server (with an amazing accent) waiting on me. The menu had a great variety and featured a lot of items that I recalled from the show. I was impressed by the cheese pairings and the varieties of oysters that were also offered. A Spanish cheese selection named Mont Enebro was an absolute dream!! I would never think to pair goat cheese with anchovies, and raisin toasts, but MAN O MAN, it blew me away! I also ordered the Duck Confit hash, which was decent and the Panna Cotta with a Meyer Lemon gelee and huckleberries which was a great, refreshing end to the meal.   Overall, I was truly pleased with the experience at Absinthe. The waitstaff was great and the food was upscale, yet still very comforting and hearty. If I ever need to be whisked away to a European bistro, I know Absinthe is right around the corner to fulfill that need.",

It has been 10 years since we had last dined here.  Well, apart from being so NOISY from raised voices of a crowded room (you cant relax and enjoy here), the quality of food has seemed to have slipped badly.  We started with a couple of choices from the many cheeses they have to offer, but the brie and the cows milk we selected were nothing excitable. I then had the half dunenous crab in shell, and although cooked perfectly, it was simply bland which was extrememly disappointing. They need to learn how to flavor this when boiling. Partner had the french toast and gave a 7/10. Any cocktail they make with their own house-made sweet-and-sour etc has a strange, almost cheap, taste to them. Also their Lemmonade is dreadful. \u00a0  Ended with the french onion soup and that saved the entire meal - delicious!  I'm giving 5 stars for our servers and the water boy, then taking off 3 for the mostly 'blah' food - what happened Absinthe?",

We could only get reservations for Sunday afternoon but according to my fellow yelpers brunch is a great time to go.   And it was! We had two other couples with us and we all immensely enjoyed our meals and each others. Some of our favorites ...Biscuits and Gravy, Grilled Corn Cakes, Wild Mushroom Omelet, and the Hamburger. The fennel sausage they make is bursting with savory flavor, the coffee gives you that warm fuzzy feeling inside, and the french fries are crunchy, salty, and soft in the middle.   Next Dessert! We ordered and shared the Chocolate Banana Tart, Scharffen Berger Pot de' Creme, and the Grapefruit Sorbet. The Chocolate Banana Tart was a trio of Chocolate tart absolutely to die for, the salted carmel banana delicious, and the banana ice cream creamy and tasty. My Pot de' Creme smooth chocolaty heaven, intensely delicious but not heavy. The sorbet was good, just not my thing (no chocolate, not interested)   The Service was great. A little slow at times but this place is ALWAYS packed. We could see it from our Inn across the street and there was a long line waiting for it to open. Our waitress was attentive and very accommodating. My friends burger was rarer then he expected (when you order a medium rare burger from a real chef it actually comes out medium rare). He took the blame when talking to the waitress but she was very nice and even said she thought it was a little rare too. The ended up bringing him a whole new plate. The prices were actually surprising reasonable. $160 for brunch for 6, plus 3 desserts, and drinks..not bad.   If I were to have one complaint it would be that I thought my bloody mary could have been more flavorful. All in all a wonderful experience that I will definitely have to have again!",

    "review_text": "There is no PG-13 way to put this: Chilled corn puree (soup) is orgasmic. It's not of the naughty variety, but might cause your eyes to roll back in your head from pure pleasure.  Party in your mouth. Field day for your taste buds.  It doesn't stop at the corn either... Scallop &amp; Clam chowder is balancing act, perfected. Delicate scallops nestled between petite clam shells in a creamy &amp; rich, but not the least bit heavy, base. Unexpected halibut kept me taking mini bites so as to savor every last tender flake, morsel, drop, drip, lick. The server returns to the table, ready to clear my plate, asks (to my seemingly empty plate) if I am finished to which I respond, hesitantly, \"yes, otherwise I am tempted to lick the plate and it just doesn't seem appropriate\" *flashes a smile* He reminds me there is some bread left on the table I could use to soak up the last bits (but what fun is that!?!).  Complements to the chef. (Way to go Jamie!) It's pure bliss.  Ambiance caters to any occasion and is way more PG-13 than my tango with the soups, but you still might want to leave the young'ns at home and enjoy this for yourself (and your lucky hot date).  Strawberry gazpacho, I'll be back for you! *****  Treated myself to strawberry gazpacho before diving in to some ginger-infused cocktails, nibbling melt-in-your-mouth olives (why don't other places serve olives warm? Oh, the difference!), and a duck confit salad... \u00a0 what can I say? It didn't blow my mind like the corn puree but did not disappoint. The silky texture throws you a curve, I just missed the ball.",

For dinner, I had the absinthe burger and added a fried egg and cheese. It was delicious, and the meat was cooked perfectly. I also had a side of french onion soup. It had great flavor.  For dessert we did the 3 different cheeses, and those were so good!  Can't wait to come back!",

    "review_text": "Absinthe had long been on my radar as a place to try ever since I saw Top Chef and Jamie Lauren (Top Scallop lol). \u00a0She has since left and as such any chance of meeting her and trying her food lest I drive down to her new place in LA.  Overall, the food was good, just neither great nor memorable enough (even when taking the overpriced menu into account) to really warrant a return visit in the future. \u00a0In fact, the lack of memorable food is what will impact the length of this review.  Started with coffee, pretty good but too pricey for regular coffee in my opinion. \u00a0However, props for the real sugar cubes.  Fruit Plate: \u00a0My friend and I debated between this and cinnamon roll, we chose poorly. \u00a0For close to $10 we got a couple of slices of fruit neatly arranged on a LARGE plate with a little bit of vanilla cr\u00e8me fraiche. \u00a0While the fruit was fresh I could have used a lot MORE (1 slice of kiwi = booo!)  Banana-Pecan Pancakes: \u00a0Another swing &amp; miss; 3 pancakes the size of my palm with 3 slices of banana on top, 2 pecans on top, and a smidge of chopped pecans in the actual pancakes themselves. \u00a0I was so depressed when I saw such an anemic plate that I ordered a side of bacon! \u00a0Plus though on the real maple syrup for this and the French toast.  French Toast with Pear and Mascarpone: \u00a0The friend dish, 4 slices of overly-cooked (read dry) French Toast and a large half-poached pear with a dollop of mascarpone in the hollowed out pit area. \u00a0Meh!  Sides: \u00a0Scrambled eggs and bacon. \u00a0The eggs were good, really good, and probably the highlight of an otherwise unmemorable meal. \u00a0The bacon was cooked right but too skinny, I likes me some hearty bacon!  In conclusion, there are soooooooo many other places I will try before I return to Absinthe. \u00a0In fact, I ate at Ella's a week later and their pancakes...NO comparison!",

But, couldn't promise after that. We got there \u00a0a little after 9:00 PM and were seated right away.   Place was packed and roaring with people.  It took us a while to order. The service was not as attentive as I like or am used to. However, our waiter was efficient when he was around. We each got a drink (Extra Dirty Grey Goose Martini and something called a Ginger Rogers). Both drinks were strong and delicious!  We started with the french fries with dijon mustard, thyme-infused malt vinegar, and rouille. They were nicely salted and crispy. My friend ordered the large french onion soup and I got the Grilled scallops with sunchoke pur\u00e9e, slow-cooked artichokes, baby fennel, and wilted chard. Soup was superb and my scallops were the BEST SCALLOPS I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE! Perfectly cooked and spendy ($30 for 4 scallops!). But, well worth it.   An additional star for the Jamie sighting! :)",

Circular booth so that the boy can put his arm around you.   We both ordered the pork rib eye and passed on the appetizer for fear that we could not accommodate dessert. The pork came out perfectly cooked on a bed of mashed potatoes and a side of sauteed veggies. Mine was HUGE but as a woman in a tight fitting dress, I tried as much as I could to finish. I got up until the bone before I was about to pass out. For dessert, we shared the pumpkin custard. It was like a deconstructed pumpkin pie with graham crust shavings on top and pumpkin custard on the bottom. Yummy.   Highly recommend this place for dinner and or date. Very romantic setting w/ ample amounts of booze.",

    "review_text": "I had the pleasure of dining here on a Saturday evening for a friend's birthday. \u00a0Although this corner gem isn't that spacious, they set our party of nine at a nice long table in the second room in a more quiet part of the restaurant.  My night here was exceptional from start to finish. \u00a0The service is impeccable, and everyone working here has enthusiasm including the guy who scrapes your crumbs off the table and the girl who refills your water glasses. \u00a0  We chose from a three course menu selection. \u00a0They added a personal touch by printing my friend's name for her birthday on all the menus. \u00a0I started my dinner off with mixed local greens, Asian pears, pecans, brioche crisp, goat cheese mousse, with medjool date vinaigrette. \u00a0The goat cheese was so creamy and smooth and the vinaigrette was light in flavor- just perfect. \u00a0The potato-mushroom-leek soup, with green garlic and brioche croutons was pretty tasty too and teaming with fresh flavors. \u00a0For the main course, I had potato-crusted arctic char with Little Gem lettuce, yellow wax beans, red radish and ni\u00e7oise olives which were minced in a line down the center of the plate (an interesting touch of presentation and addition to flavors with each morsel of fish). \u00a0It was my first time indulging in char which is closely related to salmon and lake trout. \u00a0It was tasty but nothing that \"wowed\". \u00a0For dessert I had the cara cara orange parfait with yogurt panna cotta, cara cara orange sorbet and pistachio crumble. \u00a0This was an interesting concoction of dessert flavors and by far the most delectable orange confection I'd ever enjoyed!  The wine and spirits selection here is one of the larger selections I've ever seen. \u00a0The menu is contained in a small binder. \u00a0It's likely there is a wine here to suit anyone's palette. \u00a0The martinis are quite smooth too. \u00a0Unfortunately, it never occurred to me to try any of their absinthe cocktails. \u00a0There was an exorbitant amount of wine, prosecco and champagne being poured around our table.  This is definitely a splurge but worth the experience in a dramatic ambiance with dark wood paneling and rustic style interiors with some slight modern touches.",

Those addictive suckers make the dish worth getting and we had to ask for more taro chips because we finished those before we could finish the ceviche itself. -Omelette - Had lobster bits inside with green garlic. Pretty solid omelette but nothing wow factor   Service is whatever. The busboys were way more attentive than our actual waiter but it was probably because it was super busy. Either that or she just didn't think we'd be big tippers so she didn't bother.   Overall, a really good brunch.

We were shown to a table by the windows, to further enjoy the sun. I had the fried green tomatoes, an eggs benedict type dish but with tomatoes under the eggs. It came with the most perfectly done potatoes one could ask for. The mans got the ricotta french toast, which was also heavenly. I also got the lemonade which I think has ginger in it?

I oftentimes wander by or ride by on the bus past the establishment only hoping that the green fairy actually delivered more actual green into my pockets so I can dine here.

Our host was gracious, our server was attentive and hey, throw some linens on the table and a cocktail in my hand and I'm all growns up by 11 am. Most of the time I'm in Hayes Valley it's for a cheap shopping thrill or some pizza ;-), so this was a plus.  I started out with a \"Death in the Afternoon\" cocktail even though it wasn't even noon yet, but hey, I'm a professional. And I did not die.   The food arrived at the perfect time and the array of plates was impressive and presented well. I had split several yummies with Jen I. and enjoyed each one.  Sometimes brunch is meant to be meat and grease, sometimes it's meant to be sea salt and chanterelle mushrooms. \u00a0I sampled the fried green tomatoes which was a bit salty for me, but very rich and filling. The pommes-frites beat out Frijtz any day in my book, and the mushroom flat bread was the perfect level of crisp. The buttered lettuce salad was just a salad, which they so kindly split up into two plates for us without asking--I like that. It was tasty nonetheless. I have to have some veggies!  Wonderful upgrade from the usual cacaphony of downtown or the Castro in the places we visit for brunch.   Oh, and just because we eat and drink like ladies doesn't mean we can't get a little sassy and crass over lunch--kudos to our server for keeping up and humoring us.",

    "review_text": "We had a great time at Absinthe. We ordered the oysters and 3 different cheeses and the fries to start with. The cheese with the blackberry pur\u00e9e was everyone's favorite and the fries came with an outstanding smoked ketchup that none of us tasted before. \u00a0The lamb and coq au vin were both the winning orders for the table. The pork cheeks and the salmon were the other entrees and they were just ok which is why I'm rating it 4 stars overall. The pork had an overall good flavor but was pretty dry tasting. \u00a0The salmon was pretty boring and nothing special. \u00a0The German chocolate cake was fantastic. We also had the buttermilk panna cotta. I normally love all panna cotta but this one tasted very tart like a yogurt because of the buttermilk and I did not care for it. The cocktails we tried were great, the Ginger Rogers was like a ginger mojito, the have \u00a0was delicious as was the French 75. We also tried a French absinthe at the end of our meal which was really good and we loved the service we received.",

    "review_text": "It took me almost six years to finally get to Absinthe, and I preface my review by saying I came in after 11 and ate only off the bar bites menu. I wasn't super hungry, so I just got the French Onion soup and a side of French Fries.  Absinthe Hot Tip #36: Use the French Onion Soup as a dip for the fries.   I'd heard a lot about the place being a cocktail destination, and me being distinctly a beer and whiskey guy, figured I'd give the gold standard - an Old-Fashioned - a shot. It was flawless. The best cocktail I've ever had. The bourbon wasn't overpowered and it perfectly balanced. Yes, I think I'll have another. And another...  So yeah, to the question of desserts, now being prepared by Luis Villavelasquez, formerly of Citizen Cake. I have to admit that he and I know each other through a mutual friend, so I'm a little biased, but we had the panna cotta with strawberries and sweet basil, and it literally blew mind out the back of my head onto the fancily decorated wall behind me.   Yes, I think I'll have another. But next time, I'll come in for dinner service.   PS - I know that given my male status my chances are nil, but Steffan was right, Jamie Lauren is uber-cute.",

I had not been here before so it was nice to eat here finally. I was not impressed with their house pate. It was blend. I loved their French soup. I would not come back unless I've eaten all of the other French restaurants in the city. Having been to France a half a dozen or so times, it's hard to impress me with French food.

Historically, the service was excellent, the food pretty good, and the bar program excellent and well celebrated for it.  However, as of late, I've noticed a slip in the service that has reached a tipping point today where I simply won't return.  My girlfriend an I walked in and told the hostess that we wanted to sit at the bar for a quick snack and a drink or two. We were told to \"belly up,\" to what was obvious upon looking at it, a completely full bar. The hostess didn't care to observe this, or more pointedly, didn't care to bother herself with a solution or even an eta.  We sat by the door.  We then proceeded to watch as two more couples walked in and stared at the bar as well. At no point did the woman at the desk feel that maybe managing her dining room was important, so we stood up and walked to hover around some guests to protect the seats we felt should be ours, and others followed suit. An excellent outcome; make patrons feel like vultures are circling.  We then waited 20 god damned minutes for the bartender to notice us. He didn't. We finally got one seat thanks to a patron, who noticing our plight made sure we got her seat.  The bartender finally took notice when he attempted to seat two of the later arrivals in some clearing chairs ahead of us and Jenn spoke up. He replied to this by saying \"Hey, I don't know you or them, but they had a drink.\" Maybe we would have had one had he ever noticed us waiting for 20 minutes to order one.  Top it off? As I attempted to complain to the host when we decided to leave and go elsewhere, another employee got pissed that I interrupted him.  Won't be back.",

Unfortunately, she didn't come around that often.   Another issue, was the flat bread on the menu said it had artichokes but when it came out there was asparagus on it instead. My companion flagged down the waitress to figure out what was going on and the waitress kept looking at her like she had three heads. She didn't understand why we were questioning the asparagus. Finally another server walked by and overheard the exchange, he advised that they had changed the flat bread but hadn't updated the menu. I think that's kind of important to mention when someone orders an item off of the menu. After all asparagus and artichokes are two very different vegetables. Better yet, you should update your menu.  Aside from the flat bread issue, everything else was fantastic. Three of us ordered the special pork tenderloin that they had that day. It was one of the best dishes I've ever had. So yummy. We also got the mac &amp; cheese and potatoes off of the sides menu to share. I could do without the potatoes, they weren't anything special but the mac &amp; cheese was pretty good.   This place is a definite must try...just hope that you get a better server.",

    "review_text": "So...I have heard all sorts of things about how Absinthe has \"fallen from grace\", how they have \"bad service\", that the food is \"not that great\", etc.   Good thing I like to make my own decisions, because everything negative I had heard about Absinthe was 100% *wrong*.   let's start with the fact that my date and I were almost a half hour late for our reservation - we did call to warn them it was going to happen, but when we got to the door, we were immediately ushered to a waiting table, and the hostess and server were amazingly nice and polite about it - not seeming the slightest bit put out (although I felt bad regardless).   We started off with a couple of classic cocktails from their amazing cocktail list. I had the Blood &amp; Sand, my date had the French 75 - both of which were mixed to perfection, and were absolutely delicious.   Then we got into a small oyster tasting...everything was fresh, tasty, and presented quite nicely.  We were both in a \"must eat steak\" mood, so I knew that we were going to get a nice vintage bottle of wine off of their list, and our server had the sommelier come out to assist me with picking out something to pair with our meal. The sommelier was extremely friendly, and knowledgeable, and he worked with my palette choices/leanings, and I decided on a beautiful '98 Castello di Verduno Barolo (a Tuscan/Piemonte Nebbiolo based Italian red). For the price point, it drank like a much higher end wine, and both my date and I were extremely pleased with the selection.   For a mid course, we shared the artichoke and chantarelle/crimini tart, which was baked to perfection. I could have eaten about twelve of those things myself!   Then, as the wine opened up, our main courses came. she got the 7oz Filet, I got the 10oz rib eye - both came with beautiful reductions, more 'shroomy goodness, beautifully sauteed spinach, and an amazing slightly curried potato gratinee. To say our steaks were cooked to utter perfection would be an understatement. We were both blown away by the quality and amazing taste of our meals.   To finish we split a berry sorbet, and I paired it with a tasty little Moscato di Asti.   That was the meal - everything was perfect in terms of taste, portion size, etc. Beyond that - our service was IMPECCABLE. We never had to lift a finger to pour our wine, to ask for water, or even when my date got up to use the restroom, the server was ALWAYS there to refold her napkin for her. And on top of all of that - both my date and I noted that the staff that night was exceptionally gorgeous. We wanted to take our cute, pigtailed server home with us ;)  All in all, our Absinthe experience was amazing, and I'll surely return to explore some of their other offerings. I'd been in once before with some other friends that had reservations, and I sampled some of their cheese plates and their lamb - but that was a much more casual and impromptu visit, so I didn't want to review them at that point. This last meal was worthy, and Absinthe is worthy of high praise. Do yourself a favor...ignore the naysayers and give it a shot yourself...I think you'll have a great experience!",

    "review_text": "I learned about Absinthe by watching Top Chef Season 5 where Jamie showed off her amazing culinary skills. I've wanted to eat there ever since, so I chose it for my birthday dinner. My S.O. and I made a reservation several days in advance, and we were seated promptly in the back private dining area.  We were originally seated at a table that was in the most highly trafficked area. It felt like we weren't fully in the room, so we asked to move. They kindly offered us the next table over that was a bit more in the room. That was a comfortable solution. The service left a little to be desired, as we waited what seemed to be too long for bread and water and for our server to take our order. Overall, it seemed like our server was either too busy with other customers or that she would have rather not been working that night. She wasn't as attentive as I would have wanted her to be.  Here's what we ordered:  We couldn't resist indulging in some cocktails. My S.O. got a gin-based drink with orange and angostura bitters from their cocktail list. He also got a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon to go with his dinner. I got a couple mint juleps and am really grateful that they were able to make this drink that isn't available at most places, as it's one of my favorites. 5 stars for the drinks.  - Escargots in shell -- I felt as if I were Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, as I got to use snail tongs to hold the shells in place so that I could get to the meat. I was so nervous that the shell would go flying across the room, but I succeeded in eating them without incident. They were perfectly cooked in a butter/garlic sauce. And the sauce was perfect for dipping the crusty garlic bread and other table bread.  - Saffron &amp; cinnamon braised lamb shank -- This was my entr\u00e9e. Wow. I've never had lamb shank that was quite this succulent. The meat jumped off the bone just with a glance. The flavors complemented the meat well. I do think I would have preferred a crunchier side than the Israeli cous cous because it was also really soft. I think the plate would have been slightly better balanced with something like rice or al dente cous cous.  - Grilled Hereford ribeye - This was my S.O.'s entr\u00e9e. I tasted the ribeye, and it was perfectly cooked and flavored.  For dessert, we shared the Scharffen Berger chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me, cr\u00e8me chantilly. Perfect amount of chocolate -- smooth texture. Since we had made a note in the reservation that it was my birthday, they brought it out with a candle and \"Happy Birthday\" message. I appreciate that touch.  Overall, dining at Absinthe was a great experience, and I would return again for a special occasion or just to get a signature cocktail from the bar.

I couldn't have been happier with my night out. Upon entrance, the bar is the first thing you see; loud, crowded, people blocking the walkway, but smiles and laughs all around. Beyond the chaos and fun though, lies a quieter and demure dining room. A white table cloth, dim lighting, and a rounded velvet booth set the mood for a great evening.  THE ORDER:   - Mixed Local Green Salad ($13). The mildly sweet poached apples and whipped-fromage blanc really made this simple salad over-the-top special. I also appreciated how they automatically brought the salad out on two plates since they knew we were sharing.  - Beef Tartare ($16): SO GOOD. Flavorful, fresh, and just perfection on the delightfully crisp crostini bread.   - Coffee-Crusted Liberty Duck Breast ($32): The duck was tender, flavorful, and the whole dish worked together very well. I don't know if I tasted the coffee, but I liked the concept nevertheless. Great variety of textures with the wild rice hash, spinach, and almonds.   - Braised American Wagyu Zabuton Beef ($35): Gosh, doesn't the name just sound amazing? I think I prefer my Wagyu beef without the braise, but it was still pull-apart tender and money next to the garlic mashed potato puree.   After many silverware and plate changes later, and a delicious Ginger Rogers cocktail and dessert, easily one of the best meals I've had in SF. Each dish got better and better and I became more and more impressed. Our server was extremely knowledgable about everything on the menu, was very accommodating to our allergy concerns, and remained professional and friendly throughout the evening. Of course the restaurant is a little pricey and the portions can be small for certain dishes, but for what you get, I think it's completely worth it! I had a wonderful time and highly recommend for a special occasion!",

The Wife and I were going to see a show at the Davies hall on a Saturday night, and we hadn't made any real plans to eat beforehand. \u00a0I did a quick Yelp! search and found Absinthe and called to see if they had an opening for two in 10 minutes. \u00a0That we returned from our trip to Paris the week before also made us pine for the French menu (for the souvenir, of course).  The hostess was remarkably efficient, she pointed out that there would be some cocktail tables open soon, and she could squeak us in if we were there in 10 minutes exactly.  We were seated promptly, and we ordered drinks from the \u00a0pretty good wine list. \u00a0Our water glasses were always full, and while it is a bit noisy from the crowd, it wasn't too distracting (except for That Lady in the corner announcing how she's okay that her 'friend' married a stripper, and he's happy, and she's happy for him that he, after all, chose to marry a stripper...).  They bill themselves as French/California, and that's a good description. \u00a0For appetizers, we had a selection of fresh (non-pasteurized) cheeses (which I love) and had an alternate toast that didn't have walnuts. \u00a0  I had the pork and The Wife ordered the coq au vin. \u00a0Both were excellent, and served hot. \u00a0One really cool bonus, after we ordered, the waitress asked if we had a showtime to make. \u00a0We told her we did, and they put a rush on it without spoiling our experience.  We didn't have time for dessert, but maybe next time. \u00a0It's moderately pricey, but only because we had a bottle of wine, and it was definitely worth the experience.",

    "review_text": "I really love Absinthe. It's become a very special spot for me and my boyfriend after having a perfect track record of special occasions and romantic dinners here.  French food, wine, and dining culture are near and dear to my heart. I was fortunate enough to travel there a lot as I spent a large portion of my childhood on the south east coast of England -- just a short ferry trip from Normandy -- and my dad is a not-so-secret francophile. I grew up eating pates, stinky cheeses, all kinds of \u00a0fresh breads and pastries, and even getting a taste for wine. My dad told me that it would serve me well to learn about the finer things in life... and he was right!  Sadly it's not always easy to get a taste of France in San Francisco. New York, yes, but it doesn't really exist in the same way here. Sometimes I get homesick and feel like nothing here scratches that itch. Absinthe is an exception! It's a brilliant casual yet sophisticated setting in the classic bistro style. The menu is flexible so you can have a modest meal or have a grand experience, as you wish.  To start the meal, it's hard not to order the chicken liver pate. It's just so good! It is quite filling though so I wouldn't order it expecting it to be eaten by just one person. Again, It comes in the traditional bistro style -- served with toast and fruits softened in a glaze. I love having some with the crusty bread they serve as well, as it's nice to vary the texture from the pillowy toast to the chewy crust of the other bread. The steak tartar is my boyfriend's favorite after he got over the initial shock of eating a raw egg yolk (even though the raw steak didn't make him bat an eye).  For mains, the ribeye steak is hard to beat. I also love the potato crusted salmon. It's hard to pull me away from these two, but I've had and enjoyed chicken and pork dishes as well. The WINE, can't believe I almost forgot. I generally order a bottle of a dry Burgundy or Cote du Rhones. The recommended Burgundy is delicious, but there is so much variety it would be hard not to find something to your taste. Sometimes I'll start with a glass of white as it's a nice accompaniment to the richness of the liver pate.  The desserts are generally lovely. The last time I was in I enjoyed a goat cheese tart, that was sort of similar to a cheesecake made with tangy goat's cheese, but it was just fantastic so I feel that comparison doesn't do it justice. Complemented beautifully by a glass of Sauternes. Can't go wrong with that combo! And of course there are so many cheeses to choose from. I could go on and on, so let's just say I always leave here full and happy!  It's not all perfect however: we've had the cocktails not work out so well on occasion, so now we generally give them a miss and head straight for wine. The overflow seating area on the far side of the bar leaves A LOT to be desired in terms of ambiance. I'm willing to wait longer to avoid sitting in what feels like a lobby or a restaurant at an airport. (OK, that's pretty mean, but I really do not like sitting there.) So much of the experience for me is the look and feel of the main dining room. The full experience.  For anyone familiar with and fond of bistro style dining, found of course in France, but also quite popular in New York -- Absinthe is hard to beat for San Francisco. It doesn't have to be super fancy, the prices are reasonable and the menu is flexible enough that you don't HAVE to break the bank to have a nice time. It is a lovely spot for a special occasion dinner however, when you want to mark the event and really treat yourself. The food is lovely and classic, and the service is warm and polite.   Absinthe is a real gem and I plan to have many more romantic dinners here for years to come!",

We gulped down delicious glasses of Grenache while noshing on the new love of my life, fried chickpeas, tasty salads, mini-pretzels, and comfy french fries. This broad was stuffed!

I'd take all my dates there. The early 20th century French design, gourmet cocktails and instrumental music always conspired to create a night of enchantment.   I remember this one Saturday night in particular, when I took a date there, after dancing the night away at a Downtown club. \u00a0Electricity was in the air because we were going to see Madonna in San Jose the following night. As we passed by a pawn shop on Market, on our way to Absinthe, we noticed that they were playing \"Desperately Seeking Susan\" on an old TV/VCR combo in the window. Somehow the night seemed like it was orchestrated just for us. \u00a0  Arriving at Absinthe, we took an outside table (because it was a warm summer night) and ordered oyster shooters and a bottle of champagne. After swigging the creamy oysters and peppery Bloody Mary shooters, there was something so refreshing about that champagne.   We just sat there, drinking, talking and laughing, as people do when they've only known each other briefly. \u00a0Somehow the time just escaped us.   But at some point a limousine pulled up right in front of us. \u00a0A woman finally emerged with short hair, pulled back in a chignon and wearing a ball gown. \u00a0She reminded me of the singer in \"Diva.\" \u00a0Unable to find a table (it was particularly crowded that night), she asked if she could join us. \u00a0We obliged and she ended up ordering another bottle of champ and telling us about her night -- she had just come from the Opera. \u00a0She also entertained us with stories about her friendships with local celebrities and politicians. \u00a0  At some point she asked us when we were getting married. \u00a0That was a little awkward, since we had just met, but she just kept trying to convince us that we're perfect for each other and that we must tie the knot at City Hall asap. \u00a0But before that, she thought that we should join her on her yacht for a cruise the following morning. Somehow we didn't think we'd be up till late afternoon, but she gave us her card anyway and told us to call the next morning.   When the bill came, she tore it from our hands and insisted on paying for everything. \u00a0 We refused, but she wouldn't have it any other way. Finally, she gave us a ride home in her limo. \u00a0  It was truly a fairytale evening and I don't think that it could have happened anywhere other than Absinthe.",

The berbere spice blend and the texture of the chickpeas was absolutely perfect.   I still dream of them.",

    "review_text": "I've had my eye on this bar/restaurant for awhile now. When expectations are this high, it's easy to be disappointed. But disappointed I was not.  The beef tartare was THE BEST. My friend, a self-proclaimed beef tartare connoisseur, says that it's definitely in her top 5 in SF (though apparently can't beat Marlowe's -- gotta try that spot next).  The burger is one of the cheapest entrees on the menu at $15 (+$1.25 to add gruyere cheese), and freaking fantastic. We got it medium and it was cooked on the medium-rare side, which was A-OK with me. It did come with some of the skinniest fries I've ever had, if that's your thing.   The French onion soup is also supposedly famous here. My friends and I shared a bowl. It looked just as a French onion soup is supposed to look, topped with copious amounts of melted cheese and chock full of tender caramelized onions. My only complaint was that I woke up the next morning PARCHED. Make sure you stay hydrated if you eat this, as it's super salty!  But the real reason for my high rating was the chicken liver mousse spread. I thought Range prepared this well, but Absinthe blows their rendition out of the water. It was so so so so creamy, I was literally scraping the mason jar for the remains when it was finished. Addicting. I would come back just to eat this again and again.  On top of all that, the dry martinis here are out of control. Who knew gin martinis paired so well with French onion soup?",

    "review_text": "Cute cozy corner restaurant, cramped seating and reservations are a must. \u00a0We started off with wine and the complimentary french bread which I liked very much. \u00a0For appetizers bf had the Frisee, it had a good amount of little bacon chunks with some type of coating on it, tasty but not sure what it was, baby leeks (hard to chew), and tasty caviar on top of a rich fried duck egg. \u00a0I had the french onion soup - served in a cute mini soup tureen and it was intensely good. A rich broth, not too many onions and lots of crusty cheese melted on top with a nice piece of french bread at the bottom. \u00a0Before our meal came, a horrible stench overcame the restaurant - smelled like dead fish and everyone was looking around. \u00a0I can't repeat the comment that my bf made but I sure hope that whoever ordered that horrid fish sent it back because isn't good fish not supposed to smell fishy? \u00a0Anyway, we endured the foul odor for about 5 minutes before it dissipated. For dinner bf had the stuffed chicken, good but not great. \u00a0I had the hamburger. \u00a0Asked for it to be medium well and got it rare, too rare! \u00a0I like rare but ordered it mw so bf could have some but he thought it looked to raw and didn't want any. \u00a0The ground beef was almost tasteless, lots of grease on the bottom of the bun but the bun itself was good. \u00a0I had the french fries too, a BIG metal cup with a paper cone inside to hold a good amount over the top. \u00a0They were good but very small, short &amp; skinny and served with a few different condiments, even some infused malt vinegar. \u00a0Not our server, but one of the employees came over and took our plates away, okay, fine but I was still eating my fries and he took them too, I'd hardly touched them! \u00a0I could have asked to take them to go but it was obvious that they wanted us out of there to get ready for the next reservation. \u00a0The bill was high, I think they overcharged us for the drinks because the prices didn't match what we saw on the menu. \u00a0Too bad we came on and \"Off\" night because we went to see \"Wicked\" afterwards. \u00a0Perhaps I'm just spoiled but I love to have an over the top meal before seeing and over the top show, especially in the city.",

For a first timer to hit the 10th anniversary party, it was the perfect soft opening to their environment, their service and level of culinary performance.  I was invited along with a friend of mine to attend the party and although we arrived right on time, the place was packed. \u00a0I fell in love with the interior of this charming invocation of Southern France replete with deep crimson velvet couches and dark wood touches throughout. \u00a0The white linens on the tables were but a quiet indicator that food was indeed the showcase of the establishment.  I wandered over to the bar where the bartender asked if I wanted some absinthe. \u00a0  \"Isn't that illegal?\" I queried, remembering an episode on food network how people drinking absinthe abroad had horrible reactions to the wormwood concoction labeled distinctly as the la Fe Verte. \u00a0I was hesitant, but since the opportunity offered itself, I accepted.  The drink itself was presented with flourish, a bit reflective of the green tea ceremony in Japan. \u00a0After he finished, I tried my first sip tentatively.  It was strong. \u00a0And refreshingly cold. \u00a0And hinted of licorice.  \"This is it?\" I found it good, \"Almost like licorice!\"  \"This is Swiss Absinthe,\" he replied.  In addition to the good drinks, we were fed beautiful little hors d'oeuvres, my favorite being the little scallop with caviar on top. \u00a0I had to take a picture of it........absolutely exquisite. \u00a0In addition, little lamb hamburgers made their rounds, but I was in no mood to open my mouth wide to take a bite. These apparently came from the sister take-out cafe, Arlequin, located next door.  After spending time in the dining room, we filtered out to the main bar, where my friend knew the bartender, who turned out to be an extremely charming man; quite social and communicative. \u00a0He then in turn introduced a friend of his, a sharp handsome Brit, who then fell into conversation with my friend. \u00a0I was feeling rather cloudy (such was my absinthe drink) but in a good dreamy way, so I was quite content in leaning against the counter and smiling dizzily at everyone. \u00a0  Funny, then I ran into someone I knew. \u00a0Small world.  I'll be back for their brunch as well as their famed Neiman hamburgers next. \u00a0Excellent service, the waiters were extremely attentive-cordial-communicative and knew exactly what was on their menu. \u00a0Bartenders top notch and the host/hostess were accommodating and nice. \u00a0This is a classy establishment and it resounded quite so throughout, which would indicate my favorable review.",

The only negatives: 1) I didn't like how the restaurant was set-up. \u00a0We had dinner reservations, but the dinner dining is divided into two areas. \u00a0There is the main dining room, but there is this small section behind the bar area (separated by a low wall) that also is for dinner. \u00a0We were placed behind the bar area and it feels like you are in the bar with all the noise that comes over. \u00a0Also, the music didn't jive with the setting. \u00a0That could be because we were hearing all the music for the 'bar area' and not the main dining room. \u00a0Make sure you request to sit in the main dining room. 2) Our waiter forgot our glasses of wine that were supposed to come with our entrees. \u00a0He seemed to disappear for awhile, so we had to ask someone else to bring our wines.  Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to try dessert. \u00a0Delicious food though and we'll be back!",

Not that the food on the plates we ordered had any issues...if I was home, I would have licked my plate.  Started with oyster shooters. Do it.

SO SO SO SO SO DELICIOUS.  Hubby Entree: Coq Au Vin. NOT your regular braised chicken. Seriously smooth, rich, creamy jus sauce smothered all over tender/juicy chicken. Homestyle cooking taken to another level, indeed.  Desserts: Holy crap! The most amazing, German chocolate mousse cake EVER. I will not give away too much about the dessert-just please trust me, you need to have this. Honorable mention goes to the Butternut Squash Cake-yum!!!

I highly recommend the Spicy Fried Chickpeas and the Sweet Yellow Brentwood Corn Soup (on the menu Fall 2010). \u00a0The Kurobota Pork Rib Eye also had delicious combination of flavors with the cheddar grits and braised red cabbage. \u00a0I tried the sauteed Dungeness crab; this was my first time with Dungeness and I doubt I'd try it again. \u00a0The presentation and flavor was amazing, I just think that the restaurant has so many other dishes that have more personality (and of course less work/mess to enjoy!). The Olive Oil &amp; Chocolate dessert combined elements of comfort food (an ice cream sundae!) with new flavors and textures.",

    "review_text": "Came here for my birthday brunch with some friends last weekend. Luckily we made a reservations because the place was packed! Service is absolutely fantastic here, because we were seated half an hour after our reservation, the hostess apologized and took care of our desserts!   I started off with a cup of the french onion soup and that was delicious. We decided to all share everything because none of us could decide what we really wanted. We got the banana-blueberry souffle pancakes, ricotta stuffed french toast, and the wild mushroom omelet. The omelet was nothing spectacular, the french toast was actually good and very interesting. My favorite was the pancakes - so fluffy, soft and full of flavor! I also had the Absinthe Lemonade -which I didn't care for..because it was on the bitter side.  For desserts we shared the chocolate pot de creme, thai coconut sorbet, and a strawberry dessert. The desserts were not spectacular in fact we all thought it was all too sweet. Overall, the food and service combined made it a great experience. Will def. want to come back here to try their lunch/dinner menu!",

I believe it is owned by the same group that owns its neighbors, Arlequin Cafe, and Arlequin Wine. I had been to the Cafe many times, a casual number at your table type of place with a great rear patio, but never here.   The great thing about Absinthe that is perfect for its location near the performing arts centers of Louis Davies Hall, the Opera House, etc., is that they are open late. So you can come here before a performance, or after.   The Bar is always lively and full, the tables are brass topped, and the dark wood decor gives it that old school feel. The service was good, with an old school waitress who was professional, and the rest of the staff attentive and on top of our needs.   We came here for a late night snack about 9:30pm, after another event nearby. We tried the 1/2 sized French Onion Soup ($5.50) and the 1/2 sized Butternut Squash soup ($7). These were followed by dishes in the appetizer group, like Beef Tartare ($16) and a Fuyu Persimmon Salad ($14). We supplemented these with a couple of cocktails.  Food was very good, service great, and a nice casual, but city vibe ambiance.",

The seasonal dishes are delicious, the service is thoughtful and attentive and the Absinthe burger is awesome. My family and I eat here about twice per month before the opera and they take great care to get us on our way before 6:30pm.   The menu changes with the seasons and rather than breaking it down by dish I'll just say I'm always happy with the onion soup (which is available year-round) and the wine list is is balanced nicely with French and new world selections. The Sancerre is a good value.   The table bread is a whole wheat or multigrain sourdough from Acme bread and it's dangerous delicious, you may over-indulge if you're a bread 'n' butter fiend.   The swordfish is my favorite entree I hope they have it again come spring. Absinthe is a great choice for an early supper before symphony, opera or ballet. They also host a great bar for a cocktail or a glass of wine and you can order from the bar menu if you don't have a reservation.",

Not like I would try it if they did... I've seen people's reactions after taking that shot.. haha. \u00a0Given it was my friend's birthday, we decided to come here for her birthday brunch since she's a fan of breakfast foods. \u00a0Parking can be difficult around Hayes Valley, but luckily for us, we were able to find metered parking about 1.5 blocks away! \u00a0  Upon entering, the restaurant has an old parlor feel to it. \u00a0There wasn't much of a wait when we arrived, but we had reservations anyway. \u00a0We were seated right away and within a few minutes, our waiter came by. \u00a0We ordered the Duck Confit Hash and the Absinthe Hamburger with Guyere cheese and fries. \u00a0Since we were sharing our dishes, our waiter had the awesome suggestion of splitting our burgers in half for us, and putting the duck hash in the middle. \u00a0Brilliant idea! \u00a0Service was a little slow...It took a while for our food to come out to us. \u00a0As soon as the food came out, I essentially devoured the duck confit hash... It had sooo much flavor and was absolutely delicious! \u00a0I would recommend this dish to everyone who goes here. I almost wish I had it all to myself instead of just half =P \u00a0Our burger, cooked medium rare, had the bare minimum on it (everything extra was $1.50 EACH... so we skipped on it), but was still delicious. \u00a0It had a really good flavor to it or I was just really hamburger deprived lately... \u00a0The fries were okay... I've had better. \u00a0If only the fries weren't broken up into small pieces... It was as if we got the bottom of the batch of fries =( \u00a0The fries came with 3 dipping sauces - an aioli, dijon mustard, and malt vinegar.   Overall, for our 2 dishes and a side of fries, it came out to be pretty pricey for being brunch ($38 before tip)... but I enjoyed my meals, which is the most important factor. \u00a0I would love to try their dinner menu... but maybe when I get more money =P \u00a0I can see it being a very cute romantic spot for a date, so guys definitely keep this place in mind! ;) \u00a0  Because the tiny details count for something, I think it's awesome that they have coat/purse hooks on the walls near the tables. \u00a0Why don't all restaurants have that?!",

It was just okay.  The ambiance was great. Great area, cool bar area, really cozy seating area that was perfect for a date. Aside from not meeting my food expectations, I would give the place 4 stars.  However food really is the important part, and it just wasn't that great. I really wanted it to be great too. We started with the house made hot dog, which really wasn't that great. I could make a sausage sandwich just as good on my own. The homemade sauerkraut was great. We got a good cheese plate as well, but I've had better cheese plates honestly. My boyfriend got the pork shoulder and it was actually pretty stellar, but to his point, that's a pretty hard dish to mess up. I got the pierogies which just weren't that good. The veggies with them were cooked perfectly, though, I will admit.   All in all, just not close to the best food I've had in San Francisco. Also, our waitress was just a total phony. She was all chatty and pretentiously suggesting cheeses and wines in the beginning, and then completely ignored us at the end of the night when we wanted the check. She was too busy speaking french with a table of men who looked like better tippers. Cheesy.",

This place has great street presence and that ultimate drew me in. The interior is excellently appointed. The decor, the staff, and the service is just brimming with class and style without an ounce of snootiness or pretentiousness.   The bar is AMAZING. The selection of classic liquors is in all price ranges and taste profiles would keep me coming back on a far too regular basis if I lived nearby. Additionally, their knowledge of classic cocktails and proper preparation of such, dating back to the birth of the industry is refreshing. It creates an atmosphere that can spirit the mind away to passion and emotion of a long lost time.   Not only is the liquor top notch, the execution flawless, but the quality of garnish itself is so impressive as to warrant frequent patronage. Unlike many places, they actually provide a full menu of their alcohol selections. The staff is also well versed and can provide the information necessary to guide you in the direction of a selection that you will be pleased with. The wine menu is extensive as well.  Whether you are looking for a romantic dinner for two, to treat yourself to an upscale lunch, an upscale night out for cocktails and appetizers, or just stopping in for a quality drink after work, this is your place.",

If you eat in the bar area it can be very loud. Also, the faucet in the men's bathroom sink is so close to the edge of the basin as to make it annoying.

My mom got two eggs with bacon and raved about how the bacon had some kind of delicious maple flavor. I got the Croque Madam and it was sinful.

The second bottle was a denis mortet. \u00a0I'm not sure what kind it was, but it was AMAZING. \u00a0I felt a separation anxiety come on when I had my last sip. \u00a0You'll spend a pretty penny on this wine, but it's well worth it for any special occasion. \u00a0(I assume you're coming to Absinthe on some sort of occasion. \u00a0If you're not, then you're too wealthy to care about the price -___-). \u00a0  ----- The ABSINTHE ----- Ok, I didn't have any. \u00a0Not because I'm a chicken, but because I don't like the flavor of black licorice. \u00a0It was interesting to watch people take down the drink (in forms with water, ice, sugar, and all kinds of weird contraptions on top). \u00a0Seriously, it's not because I'm a chicken (chaaachi chaaachi chaaachi).",

The restaurant has that classic old San Francisco restaurant look w/ dark woods and a sense of history. \u00a0The bar area is in front. \u00a0We walked through it to the back where our friends were seated and had already ordered. \u00a0They reassured us that the waiter was wonderful and he was. \u00a0His name was Brennan or Brendan and he had a faint brogue. \u00a0He was masterful. \u00a0He encouraged us to order from the top of the mesu, the appetizer section, as it would be faster. \u00a0Alan asked about the hamburger and was told it would be out in 8 minutes. \u00a0We both ordered hamburgers and they were out in less than that. \u00a0They came well prepared, w/ thinly sliced red onion, a large piece of lettuce and pickle spears affixed to the top. \u00a0There was a pile of crispy fries and some catsup. \u00a0The hamburger was good, but I think Absinthe deserves to be lingered at and inhaling a burger and fries doesn't do it justice. \u00a0Next time--and there will be a next time-we will arrive earlier to savor the experience. \u00a0But for now, we felt wonderfully cared for by Brendan and the valet. \u00a0Our car was parked right in front of the restaurant when we returned to pick it up after the concert.",

The beef tartar was amazing, little almost translucent morsels of raw beef each coated in the seasoning and oils as to not clump together when you put it on the crostini.

We brought in a cake from a neighborhood cake maker and our guests were served hors d'oeuvres and champagne. \u00a0  The space was perfect for us- initimate and classic. \u00a0Our guests were comfortable mingling at tablets and sitting on the settees. \u00a0  It goes without saying that the food was wonderful. \u00a0We had food that ranged from seafood trays, to sliders, to chick peas. I think our sliders were a little undercooked but when we complained they were immediately replaced with fresh, adequately cooked sliders.   I will keep Absinthe private dining in mind for future events as our experience was a positive one.",

Depsite how attractive everything on the menu was, i decided to order the burger...actually, everyone at our table decided to order the burger.  The drinks are pricey, but they do their job...so, less is more in this case (and that's the last time you'll hear me say that in reference to drinks)  I ordered my ($15) burger medium rare with gruyere and spicy caramelized onions (for $1.50 each) and we shared an order of fries.  The burger was delicious. So, so juicy. The meat was incredible and literally (well, not literally) melted in your mouth. \u00a0The meat was served on fresh baked brioche, a perfect choice given how juicy the burger was and how well brioche stands up to a little liquid. The killer here was the side of house made pickles. As i've mentioned in other reviews, I love vinegar and anything that is submerged in it for some period of time. \u00a0These pickles were amazing. So crispy, so vinegar-y, so full of flavor and and spice. A perfect way to cut through the richness of the burger.  The fries were pretty good, especially when dipped in the smokey tomato ketchup.  The entire menu is impressive, and i'd love to give this place another whirl when i'm in the city. The food is expensive, and i've had equally delicious burgers for less...however, this one is worth a try at least once.",

    "review_text": "My wife and I arranged to have someone watch our kids on a recent holiday weekday night. During this particular week in December, \"Colors of Christmas\" is being performed at the Davies Symphony Hall, and \"The Nutcracker\" is at the War Memorial Opera House. With these shows within an hour of each other, many ticket holders make an evening of it with dinner before their scheduled performances. Needless to say, many of the nearby restaurants are pretty full. My wife and I also decided to make it an evening of it, so I planned ahead and made reservations before \"Colors of Christmas\" started.   Not sure I have much more to add from the other 1200 Yelp reviews, but I will say I'm glad I made reservations as the bar and restaurant was full, and walk-ins were being turned away.   Our Order (sorry for the poor quality of the photos, low light limitations of the iPhone camera):  -Hamachi Crudo (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/353bun0151fMbR3ut2d-nw?select=5tAbSDYlSI629wXYOv7q4A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/353b\u2026</a>): slices of buttery hamachi was topped with thin slices of peppers, drizzled with a citrus oil, then sprinkled with sea salt. Peppers added a very subtle kick, added with the tartness of the citrus.   -Pan-Seared Scallops (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/353bun0151fMbR3ut2d-nw?select=wcL7tOTwVWzT8PEDO1lUdA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/353b\u2026</a>): prepared with bacon, wild mushrooms, greens, black-truffle butter, on top of a caramelized-onion pur\u00e9e. Nicely-sized scallops, tender and soft. My wife thoroughly enjoyed this dish.   -Braised Beef Cheeks(<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/353bun0151fMbR3ut2d-nw?select=ZczpQzX73zrjcfEBASawiQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/353b\u2026</a>): This was served with maple-syrup-glazed smoked yams, saut\u00e9ed kale, and horseradish cr\u00e8me fraiche. Although a steak knife was placed on the table for this dish, it really wasn't needed because the beef was fork-tender. The smokiness of the yams mixed well with the glaze of the beef cheeks. I really liked this dish!   Dessert? Of course!   -TCHO Chocolate Pot de Creme (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/353bun0151fMbR3ut2d-nw?select=4AkRwKsFn4iMISdYM1-eYA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/353b\u2026</a>): Topped with a Cr\u00e8me chantilly. Firm, but smooth and rich without being too overly sweet. Chocolate taste comes through very well in this dessert. You'd want to roll each spoonful between your tongue and the roof of your mouth.   Kabosu Lime Mousse (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/353bun0151fMbR3ut2d-nw?select=T3tsBQEP8qOA8F4opekv1g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/353b\u2026</a>): The mousse was in the shape of a fat tube, on top of a green tea biscuit, surrounded by little meringue balls (4 inches long, 2 inch diameter, thanks Mona C.!). \u00a0The mousse was dense, but refreshing after the beef cheeks.  Our server was very friendly and attentive, always cheerful without being over the top. \u00a0Very attentive bus staff as well, clearing the empty plates in a timely manner.  My wife is a big fan of Top Chef, and she asked our server if Chef Jamie Lauren would be available to drop by our table. \u00a0Being a very busy night, with a large party in the back, we didn't expect her to come out. \u00a0But to our surprise, she came out and stopped by our table.(<a href=\"http://static3.px.yelp.com/photo/9esmZsftwgTFg2_SlJnWYw/l\">static3.px.yelp.com/phot\u2026</a>). \u00a0Very friendly, very personable. \u00a0My wife was thrilled to have her drop by and had a nice chat with her.  Very pleased with the start of our evening here in Absinthe, and set a nice tone for our evening at the Davies Symphony Hall.",

    "review_text": "Overall, a great dining experience but with a couple of missteps that prevent me from giving Absinthe the full 5 stars:  (1) Ribeye steak was cooked to a true medium rare as ordered but came out lukewarm, which was unfortunate. Otherwise, it would've been close to perfection. The vegetables on the side added nothing to the plate but the fries (we substituted fries instead of the fingerling potatoes) were kick-ass.  (2) Service was inconsistent, alternating between attentive (at one point, we had 2 servers) and invisible (there was a long stretch between courses when we were ready for more cocktails but ended up having to put the order in with a busgirl).  (3) We had brought a nice bottle of Cakebread cab and when the bill came, I asked my husband how much was charged for corkage. He skimmed the bill and didn't see it on there, and we thought, \"Wow, what a nice gesture!\" We figured that since our table of 4 had each ordered a pre-dinner cocktail and an after-dinner drink (at least $80 worth), they had extended us courtesy corkage. But alas, the server apparently overheard our chatter and informed us, \"Oh, I forgot to add the corkage, I need to make sure to add it in, because the sommelier audits us all the time, and I would get in trouble.\"   Ummmm, okay. Can you say \"awkward\"? I understood where he was coming from but it should have been handled a little more gracefully for a restaurant of Absinthe's caliber (and prices).  Now for the good (and hence the 4 stars): As eveyone has stated, French onion soup was amazing, as was the scallop and clam chowder with bacon (although the bacon flavor was almost overpowering). Kampachi (yellowtail) crudo was extremely fresh and tender. Duck confit was above average, but I've had better (at Fringale). Pork confit was good, mushroom risotto was delicious but very umami so stay away if you can't handle too much savory.   Loved the brasserie atmosphere and the cocktails (complex but subtle flavors, in particular the infamous Galapagos), although I've heard the main dining room near the bar can get crowded. We were fortunate to get a table in the quieter, side dining room, which I will request on future visits (yes, I do plan to go back!).  And like everyone else, what drew me here in the first place was seeing Jamie on Top Chef. Loved her personality and cooking on the show -- down-to-earth and elegant, respectively, and it was reflected at the restaurant.",

I came here to meet some friends who were having a later dinner and ended up having a 4th dinner of my own.  First of all it's a absinthe lounge -- and within minutes I had original old school Van Gogh juice in front of me, with a sugar cube over a metal frame to dissolve to taste. It was good. Tasted like black liquorice but got me in that absinthe mood. I like mine with a lot of water-- like some people drink scotch.  Someone at the table was getting fresh oysters so I felt inclined as well. 3 Marin Miyagi's at 3.25 tasted divine.   I then proceeded to get a single cheese order of the Bayley Hazen Bleu. Served with some sort of fresh honey or sweet spread with gourmet multi grain bread-- it too was to die for. A real upscale bleu.  I had to get an encore round of oysters, and tried the Kumamoto which are a smaller but sweeter sea creature. Also great but I like the Marin Myagi's because they are saltier... An oyster should taste like the sea right?  A little pricey at $40 for just a cocktease of their menu but well worth it! Loving this place.  Tried someone's risotto -- pretty god.

He simply looked me up and down and rolled his eyes. Feck off. Seriously feck off. It's feckin 10am.

When I was finally seated, it took forever for a waiter to come over to take my drink order (the person I was meeting there was already seated) then it took forever for the drink to come or for him to take our food orders. My drink finally arrived just before our entrees. After the food arrived the server was attentive but by that point I was a little irked. In his defense, I do think he was covering a disproportionate number of tables. I will forgive a lot of great food but this was just ridiculous. I've also eaten at the Boxing Room and Comstock Saloon recently and Absinthe definitely has the worst service in the restaurant group.   Can you start serving the duck confit, the stuff my brunch dreams are made of, at one of your other restaurants... please?",

    "review_text": "Since I was on lunch, The Wonderlust and Sacred Heart and the effects of the \"green fairy\" will have to wait another time...*SIGH*  My friend and I came to Absinthe for an early lunch last Friday, 5.28 at 11:30 AM. We had reservations and were promptly seated.  FOOD: We each got the French Onion Soup and shared the other items:  *French Onion Soup Gratinee ($4.50/cup): YUMMY! The beef broth was rich, savory, and very comforting. The onions were perfectly caramelized to bring out the natural sweetness of them. It was topped w/ a cube of toasted bread and gruyere cheese which remained crispy in the broth and gave it a good texture contrast. The melted gruyere had a distinctive savory taste w/o overpowering the broth and the sweet onions. Overall, a perfect start to a meal.   *Frites ($6): It was only good for the first 5 minutes when it was still warm and crispy. B/c it was packed into a paper cone in a metal cup, all the pent up heat caused the fries to become very soggy and mushy. My friend and I weren't very fond of the three sauces provided. The Dijon mustard was more like Chinese spicy mustard and was too overpowering for the skinny fries. Same goes for the malt vinegar which only seems to work better with steak cut fries or a cut that has more substance to it. The rouille was more like red pepper aioli; it was too heavy b/c there was no citrus to balance the richness.   *Croque Monsieur ($11.50): YUMMY--Buttery, Crispy, Salty and Savory! The bread was perfectly grilled; buttery and crispy on the outside. The ham was salty but balanced out with the savory and creamy melted gruyere. \u00a0   *Absinthe Burger ($12.50 +$1.50 each for gouda, caramelized onions, and fried egg): OMFG--I think it quite possibly one of the BEST burgers I've ever eaten! The thick patty was perfectly grilled to a medium and was AMAZINGLY juicy, moist, and melted in my mouth. The gouda added just the right amount of bitterness to offset the richness of the beef. The egg didn't do much since the yolk was thoroughly cooked and the onions were too vinegary as opposed to being sweet. The bun was toasted on both sides which allowed it to stay crisp. If you are burger connoisseur OR a carnivore, Absinthe's burger is A MUST TRY!  SERVICE: It was ok. Our server was very robotic in nature and once noon hit, he became very S-L-O-W. He would come to \"look\" at our table to see how we were doing as opposed to just asking. When it came time to pay the bill, it took nearly 15 minutes to do so. This is not a place to have a one-hour lunch at, so plan accordingly and expect to spend about 1.5-2 hours here.   AMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: Reminiscent of the rolling 1940s; classically retro. There's 2 dining areas. The dining area near the bar is more casual and more suited for brunch/lunch. The dining area in the back is more sophisticated and gloomy w/ dark burgundy drapes at the window, dark tan carpets, white linen tables, and red velvet-like chairs.   CROWD:  Stuffy, much older crowd.   PARKING: Street parking.  Can't wait to come back here for dinner, so I can get my \"green fairy\" fix!",

Atmosphere and Service: \u00a0 This is the root of my dissatisfaction with Absinthe. \u00a0 \u00a0My wife and I spent our anniversary dinner staring at the armpit hair of the man at the next table. \u00a0 He rolled in wearing a *sleeveless* plaid shirt and a baseball cap. \u00a0(In his defense, \u00a0he did remove his cap after the second cocktail). \u00a0 Naturally, \u00a0the sort of fellow who wears a sleeveless shirt to a grown-up restaurant is also the fellow who makes bold arm gestures while amusing his date with tales of derring-do.  I'm a fool. I showered, shaved, and dug a jacket and tie out of my closet, \u00a0when clearly sandals and a \u00a0paint-spattered, sweaty t-shirt would have been fine. \u00a0   Make a note everyone - You needn't hose the barnyard muck off your wellies before heading down to Absinthe.. \u00a0 \u00a0Hell, \u00a0they'll probably even valet park your urine-soaked shopping cart if you tip them a nickel or two.  Atmosphere: \u00a0Fail.  Service: \u00a0Fail, \u00a0but much more subtly.. \u00a0 \u00a0It's cold and foggy, and I'm headed to a fancy dinner, \u00a0so I'm wearing my expensive overcoat. \u00a0 No coat check, no surprise. \u00a0 \u00a0I'll \u00a0just fold it up and put it \u00a0on the bench next to me, and hope Thumbs the Busser doesn't spill anything on it. \u00a0 Oh, \u00a0I see there are coat hooks here? \u00a0Why didn't you say so? \u00a0 No, \u00a0that's okay, \u00a0miss server lady, \u00a0you just stand there like a stunned deer while I get up and push past you to hang up our coats.   Do you get a basket of bread with the table? \u00a0I don't know. \u00a0We never got any, \u00a0while other tables did. \u00a0 \u00a0Our first server seemed a bit unclear on the composition of a menu cocktail.. \u00a0 \u00a0 and then was even more confused when my wife had a question about \"the chicken\" entree.. \u00a0 LOOONG pause.. \u00a0\"Oh, you mean the Coq Au Vin ?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Yes, \u00a0sweetheart, \u00a0coq au vin is made with chicken. and wine. \u00a0Coq.

Vin. \u00a0 It's the only one. \u00a0Took the orders, \u00a0and then she disappeared. \u00a0 \u00a0 The next guy came over to let us know he was taking over, \u00a0 and then similarly disappeared. \u00a0Our entrees hit the table alongside empty cocktail glasses. \u00a0 I had to flag the chap down to order wine. \u00a0 \u00a0Poor form, \u00a0particularly if all you care about is inflating the final bill. \u00a0Alcohol sales are your best margin, you dolts..

    "review_text": "Absinthe may just be my new favorite restaurant. My loverman took me here for our 6 month anniversary after not being able to get reservations in time for Gary Danko. All I've heard were good things about their food but it was mostly for their brunch menu so I wasn't sure how good the food would be. I always judge a restaurant by their dessert menu and I was not feeling theirs at all. \u00a0We had reservations at 7:30 and we arrived a bit early. My loverman gave the hostess his number so they could call him while we took a walk outside. Less than 2 minutes later, they called us. We ordered two appetizers, two entrees, three glasses of Prosecco, and Absinthe.   Escargots In Shell: I never knew what the big deal with Escargots were about since I ate it all the time as a child at home. My loverman never had it before though so we ordered a dish. It came with all these fancy utensils (much different from the fingers+toothpick method I used at home). I had a blast watching him trying to eat them. While they were good, he also remarked that they didn't taste like anything special.   Porcini &amp; Potato Flatbread: AMAZING. I wasn't expecting much and I hate potato but this was probably my favorite dish out of the whole night. I could barely tell there was any potatoes because they were thinly sliced and blended in with the cheese. It was kind of oily if you care about that sort of thing.  Wild Mushroom Farro \"Risotto\": I love that they used Farro to make this dish since I hate rice. It seems like the only options I ever have at restaurants are fish or risotto. I usually always order fish so I thought I'd try something new. I could barely finish my plate and I got the rest packed up to go but they left it on a counter for me to pick up after I was ready to leave and I forgot it! \u00a0  My loverman ordered some steak type dish that he loved. He tried to get me to try a sliver of it but that was not about to go down. I did try a fried green tomato off his plate since I've never had one. He thought they were deep fried pickles at first. Haha.   We didn't even end up ordering dessert since we were bursting at the seams. It ended up being the longest dinner we've ever had, 3 hours! Our waitress Kimberly was super knowledgeable and I felt like we were in a culinary class when she was speaking. Haha. If you're on a date, request a booth seat. I wish we had gotten one but then again, I hate sitting next to people while eating. Haha.   Warning: Apparently if your bill comes out to be over $100, they charge you like 15% extra on your credit card just to make sure you have enough funds to cover the bill.",

Being a previous vegetarian for 6 years, I recently moved back to eating meat for health reasons, but still being environmentally-conscious of what I'm eating (yes yes, I know such a San Francisco thing to do as Anthony Bordain would say)  I appreciated that Absinthe is very specific of where their meat comes from and fully discloses on the menu, which made it easier because I will only eat meat that is locally sourced.  My boyfriend said they were known for the cocktails. \u00a0Although almost all the cocktails are made with gin. \u00a0I HATE GIN. \u00a0I got the one cocktail that looked like it didn't have a trace of gin. \u00a0Citron Lemonade which was made with Hanger One Buddha's hand vodka which was really good.  We started off with some Point Reyes oysters, which I had to admit, at $3 a pop, weren't that great. \u00a0Maybe I was eating them wrong, but I hate getting shell in my mouth when I eat raw oysters.  We then got the rabbit meatballs which were great. \u00a0They weren't too \"game-y\" and they came in a great marinara sauce.  I ordered the coffee crusted Liberty duck which was AWESOME. \u00a0It was cooked medium rare which looked almost like beef. \u00a0The taste was ORGASMIC, at least in my opinion. \u00a0Very juicy and delectable, the coffee crust gave the duck a very nice bold flavor.  My boyfriend had the chicken which was also really good.  We finished off with a Quince Tart with olive oil ice cream. I was actually really looking forward to tasting olive oil ice cream. \u00a0The taste was more like a light vanilla flavor which was very refreshing. \u00a0The tart was also good but the crust was a little too hard.  I'm definitely a fan. \u00a0Absinthe met my expectations as they were high for someone who was on top chef.  As a previous vegetarian, I noticed there was a very SMALL amount of vegetarian options. \u00a0I don't recommend if you don't eat meat.  The place is pretty popular, I also recommend making reservations.",

Because of this and good reviews on Yelp, we were excited to make this meal the 'special' final meal in San Francisco and our splurge for the trip.  Maybe if we hadn't set the bar so high in advance we wouldn't have been as disappointed. I contend we would have been soundly disappointed nonetheless.  The highlight of the meal was the cheese plate we ordered to start the evening off-- the place was dark and hip and everyone in the place was 'beautiful,' as my (equally beautiful) companion remarked. The cheeses were great and the portions were very generous. Best of all, they were each paired some sort of sweet condiment to compliment the cheese-- the accacia honey and quince paste were especially delightful.  The cocktails were also good and their presentations and whimsical names and descriptions (think the Peterman Catalog) added to the fun.  Our entrees ranged from bad to only above average. We ordered halibut which came with a sweet-but-spicy corn-and-chili sauce, and the fish was cooked well- moist but flaky with some sexy brown searing. It was tasty and prepared competently, but if it seems like I am damning it with faint praise, perhaps that tells you something. We also ordered a risotto featuring macadamia nuts and fresh vegetables, ingredients that the chef should have trusted more to carry the dish. Instead, butter and salt overwhelmed the dish and made it a chore to finish despite a healthy appetite.  The wine recommended to us was good. The pana cotta was smooth buy watery, and overwhelmed by sickly-sweet strawberry syrup-- we couldn't finish it between the two of us. pana cotta should be creamy and firm and subtle. This was only creamy.  The absinthe, enjoyed as an aperitif, was fun. The accouterments and the fanfare made it memorable. I discovered that I enjoy a visit from the green fairy, and my dining companion discovered that she did not.  A note about service: I cannot fault the service in the least-- we felt attended to without feeling overwhelmed and we got good advice on wine and expert tutelage on how to consume absinthe. If the Chef and the Dessert Chef were on a summer vacation together or it was an off day, that would account for the ambivalent experience we had, but I would sooner explore other fine restaurants in San Francisco before going back to Absinthe.",

The restaurant itself is nicely decorated but not over the top fancy. The business casual vibe creates a nice comfortable not too stuffy atmosphere. The service was stellar with a very attentive waiter and several runners that kept our water and wine glasses full.  The wine list is ridiculously fancy with everything from a $40 Paso Robles Cab to an old world $2,000 Grand cru. Let's just say I was happy with my Paso cab.  The Tome de Bordeaux goat cheese starter was light, creamy yet firm served with some rustic \"healthy\" bread. Along side was some fennel jam that was presumably dabbed with crack and honey.  The show stopper for me though was the Liberty Farms duck breast crusted in coffee topped with huckleberries and surrounded by wild rice and greens. This dish was nothing short of out of this world good. The portions were perfect, the jus sauce was just the right amount of sweet and the duck was oh so tender.  My wife went with the filet mignon and it was perfectly cooked well presented and simply yummy.  For dessert some moscato and a glass of panna cotta that was decent but pretty basic in comparison to such an awesome entree.  So yea we'll definitely be back when we feel like dropping some dough on a lively dinner.",

    "review_text": "Very disappointed. Four of us for dinner and none of us was happy. I ordered a medium hamburger. It was very rare, almost inedible. \u00a0Someone else ordered the filet medium rare. It was over cooked and \"stringy\", not a lot of flavor. It wasn't a great cut of beef. The green garlic potatoes tasted like powered mashed potatoes. They were really kinda gross in both texture and flavor. \u00a0The color reminded me of the green food coloring frosting used on store bought sugar cookies around St. Patty's day.   The salmon was tasteless and had a consistency of sawdust. The French onion soup was very sweet, cloyingly so.    Maybe the kitchen was having a bad night. \u00a0The service was excellent. The cocktails were great. But the food was just not good. And when there's so much just not right with your meal, it's difficult to send it all back to the kitchen to fix it. So we're disappointed and I have to really wonder about all these 4-5 star reviews. As someone said, it's not that it cost so much (it did, this place is expensive), it just took so long to park that it's just not worth it.",

Throughout that season, my man and I longed to try her scallops. She was always making them!! So often that an exasperated Fabio was caught on camera exclaiming, \"This is Top Chef! Not Top Scallop!\"   Anyhoo, our Absinthe experience was a good one. The French Onion soup (the best I've ever had) was well-seasoned and perfect, considering the chilly evening weather. The oyster shooters were also lovely. Go Bloody Mary! And the main course... the scallops. They were so delicious that my picky fiance declared them the best he'd EVER had.   Service left much to be desired, and the dessert menu was lame. We didn't order any. Rare, as I'm such a dessert junkie. But boy, were the savory items yummy!  I look forward to returning.",

I came with some friends for sort of a midday snack and we ordered fried chickpeas, baked mac and cheese, parmesan popcorn, and the oh-so-famous soft pretzels. I personally thought the parmesan popcorn was way too mild in flavor, I could barely taste the parmesan at all. The baked mac and cheese was awesome, but of course, how can you really mess up mac and cheese?? The fried chickpeas were ok, but I think I could also make the same dish and it wouldn't cost $4 for a teeny tiny little cup. And the pretzels - very good, but when you think about how they cost more than $1 for each little pretzel stick it really makes you cringe. It comes with a cheesy dip as well but... not 7x7-worthy, necessarily.   In summary: too pricey and not exciting enough. Pass!",

The atmosphere is very intimate and elegant. My friend and I weren't really in the mood to drink so we didn't order any cocktails. They have an extensive list of amazing cocktails, so next time, I'd love to try one or two ;). We started our meal with the mixed local greens with asian pears, pecans, brioche crisp, goat cheese mousse and medjool date vinaigrette. This salad was just delightful. I really wish my bf was there that night because this salad had his name on it! Everything about it was perfect; more specifically because of the goat cheese mousse. I was really looking forward to trying the medjool date vinaigrette but the flavor wasn't pungent enough to really identify the date flavor. It was still yummy though.  For our entrees, we had the coq au vin and the sole. My coq au vin was great, but nothing out of this world. The Burgundy and jus together made a lovely sauce and the crostini that accompanied it was great for dipping. My friend's sole was perfectly cooked and the citrus fennel brown butter went beautifully with it. The wine list was very nice, so I had a phenomenal grenache and my friend had a nice chardonnay. For dessert, we had the german chocolate cake with milk chocolate mousse, pressed coconut, and candied pecans. I had very high hopes for this but it didn't really live up to my expectations of any german chocolate related dessert. The candied pecans were amazing though.   Overall, it's a very cute little place with amazing service (and valet!!). I'd love to come back here to try the cocktails and more things from the menu.",

    "review_text": "I came to Absinthe with the expectation that someone who could make it onto season 5 of Top Chef could produce fantastic food. Jamie was one of my favorites from the show (perhaps a close second behind Fabio) and so I was eager to see if she was worth her salt.   I started with the butternut squash puree soup. It was fantastic. It reminded me of Jeanty At Jack's tomato soup, in that it was perfectly seasoned, appropriately light for a pre meal whetter of the appetite, and preparing for a delightful experience. It was lovely, and the best part of the meal. It all went down hill from there.   My date and I shared the fries with dijon mustard, vinegar and rouille dips as our appetizer. Nothing overly exciting or original there. The fries were nice and crispy, but the sauces themselves lacked anything special. I've had better fries at Fog City Diner, but that's setting the bar pretty high.   Next came our mains. I had the ribeye and she had the scallops. How disappointing they both were. My steak was cooked perfectly at the requested medium rare, but it lacked flavor. How amazing it could have been with a touch of salt and pepper. There was a marrow butter on top, but the flavor there was too subtle and got lost in the taste of the meat, which is to say there wasn't any flavor to begin with. The veg under the meat was quite good, however, as it soaked up the sauces better than the steak itself. The celery puree on the side of the plate was a random addition, not adding anything to the dish in terms of taste, but perhaps simply being a beige attempt at unique presentation.   My date's scallops were also perfectly cooked, but unfortunately just as tasteless as my steak. Again, however, the veg that garnished the dish was really quite good. The artichokes in particular were the best thing on the dish, but only so because they offered much needed flavor to the bland composition before her.   For dessert, I had the chocolate banana tart, and she had the panna cotta. The panna cotta was good, and an excellent finisher to any meal. The lemon and thyme gelee topping added just the right amount of acid to the tartness of the custard, and the blackberry gracing the top helped to round out the flavor. My tart was also good, but a little too heavy for an after dinner pallet cleanser. That was of course my fault in choosing that. However, I was surprised to find that the tart itself was actually a small cake with a somewhat creamy center, with no attribute resembling what I know a tart to be. The banana ice cream on the dish was pleasant, but could be bought at any super marker. The slices of banana on the plate, encircled by dashes of butterscotch and caramel, were as bananas tend to be, and there was nothing interesting going on there.   For $113, I could have gone to Boulevard instead and spent the same amount but had a much better meal. It was not worth it, and I do not plan on going for dinner at Absinthe any time in the near to distant future. I do, however, want to attempt a trip there during lunch at one point. Considering the rather tasty veg on each of our plates, my date and I decided to come back during lunch, when the price isn't stupid-high, and try the vegetarian items on the menu, like the farro risotto. Perhaps Jamie should think about ditching the proteins for a vegetarian restaurant, because it seems she doesn't know how to actually prepare meat properly.   In conclusion, the soup was amazing (a la Jeanty At Jacks), the fries were mediocre at best (certainly no Fog City Diner), for the price of the meal the mains were sub par (just go to Boulevard if you're going to spend that much), and the dessert was certainly nothing spectacular, but not horrible (think a cross between Chez Panisse and McDonalds).",

    "review_text": "I've yet to enjoy the bites at Absinthe, but I'll tell you what - they know how to make a mean cocktail.  I don't know what it is about Absinthe, but they seem to capture an amazing energy inside the doors of their Hayes Valley eatery and drinkery. It's warm, it's cozy, the bartenders are super nice, and the crew enjoying drinks, bellied up at the copper bar, are always in a swell mood. If life has you down, it's hard not to get sucked in by the great vibes bouncing off every wall of this place.  I forget the name of their newest bartender, but it's a local mixology staple around San Francisco. He's been all over, and he definitely has a legion of fans following him around the city. Not sure if he's planning on bringing his own creations to the menu, but I don't think Absinthe needs it. With over 30 pages of specialty cocktails, beers and wines to choose from, it almost seems silly to add anything else at this point. Whatever you're in the mood for, they have it. Aperitifs, hand-shaken and stirred cocktails, IPAs, digestifs and wines from around the world are some of the things you can expect from their overstocked library of adult libations.   Speaking of drinks, this one's for the fellas: if you're on a date and want to wow your guy or gal, order the Spanish Coffee. It's like Cirque du Soleil behind the bar with firey wine glasses and cinnamon embers flowing like fireflies. Good stuff.  The drinks can be a little pricey, but nothing we haven't seen at other bars of this caliber around the city. The affordability is neck and neck with Rye, Rickhouse, Alembic and any of those other fancy schmancy saloons that have muddled their way to alcoholic infamy.",

    "review_text": "I suppose you could say it was inevitable that a distinguished British detective like myself would end up at Absinthe. The place practically beckons for quiet mysteries whispered through dimly lit booths and I happen to be all ears, professionally so. I didn't expect to be there nursing a bloody shiner, though, drowning out the throbbing pain in my skull with a well-received Riesling. \u00a0I have been booted from the force (see the Seasons and Moffitt Caf\u00e9 case files) and am officially no longer on the Case of the Missing Papaya Diamond, but a chap like myself will still follow the clues when they present themselves. It just happened to be that the clues presented themselves in a street brawl with an organ grinder and his pet monkey. The organ grinder didn't appreciate it when I refused to drop a shilling or two in the monkey's little fez and how I went on to claim that their rendition of Moonlight Sonata was an uncivilized assault on the senses. One thing led to another and I found myself with a screeching monkey clawing at my head and a portly organ grinder attempting to jab me in the face, all accompanied to an organ's death cry as I was trying to smash it on the pavement. But the clue was there.  During the scuffle my peripheral caught sight of the blonde bird (as reported in the Trace case file), disappearing into Absinthe. No mere man can forget a woman, nay, a lady, that stunning. The lead in my case. The dame in distress. A shapely embodiment of great genetics and a gentle motivator for myself to attempt a treadmill again. In that brief moment of distraction I received the bloody shiner. A lucky strike I suppose, but we'll just tell the mates at the Yard that it was something more chivalrous than a barbaric slaughter of Beethoven that brought this on.  So there I was, hid away in a booth at Absinthe, scouting the room for the lady who know haunted my thoughts. It was at this point that the server gave me the menu, I saw the word \"steak\", and promptly forgot why I was here in the first place. It was a splendid meal, indeed. To start, I received what can only be called the best gourmet pretzels ever graced on a plate, accompanied by a melted cheese that the chef must have loved making as much as I loved eating. The steak was accompanied by perfectly prepared asparagus and creamy mashed potatoes, a statement of side dishes done right for future generations of self-entitled youngsters trained by reality cooking shows. At some point during the meal, the server handed me a note, saying it was from a Southern, blond lady with important information. The note must have served as a napkin, as I found it stained with gravy at the end of the meal. She was since long gone, but on the note, or what was left of it, was what I needed to see.   Bangers!",

I was so looking forward to trying Absinthe during Dine About Town. Three course meal for $35 at a fancy restaurant- what a good deal! Unfortunately, I've been had. I went to Absinthe's website today to look up their address for tonight and see if they posted their Dine About Town dinner menu. I noticed they mentioned their Dine About Town lunch menu but not their dinner menu. I called and sure enough, they are only doing Dine About Town for lunch. Not only did \u00a0Dine About Town and Absinthe fail to inform diners beforehand but the woman I spoke to have me so explanation at all. At this point, I don't really care if it was Dine About Town or Absinthe that dropped the ball. An apology and explanation is Customer Service 101.",

    "review_text": "I came here on a Sunday around 2pm with some friends, and we were luckily seated right away. As we were being seated, I was basically drooling over everyone's food as we passed by their tables. Everything looked delicious.   We were given a brunch menu, and I ordered the Absinthe Burger and Buck's Fizz. Service was a little slow, but our waiter was very nice and professional. My burger was very juicey and tastey. I ordered it well done but I came out more medium done. I do with that they put a little more Aioli sauce on the burger - I could barely taste it. By contrast they gave you a ton of red onions, but those were easy to pick off. The description of the burger said it came with house made pickles, but it was actually a slice of a pickle skewered on top of the burger. It was a good pickle - sweet and a little gingery. It just wasn't between the buns like I expected. The french fries were thin and perfect, and served with a little dish of ketchup which was nice to not have to request.  Buck's Fizz was a pretty average, not very sweet despite the grenadine.  This place wasn't cheap but I feel like it was worth it for a special treat. The food was delicious and there were plenty of other things on the menu that look like they are worth trying if you have some spare cash. Their drink menu also looked fabulous but I stuck to the champagne due to a nasty hang over the day before. I would definitely stop in if you're in the area.",

Sitting in the busy, well tended bar provides a level of buzz that is almost intoxicating (this could have been the wine combined with my amazingly beautiful dining companion). \u00a0  As a treat, my companion surprised me with the scallop appetizer, which was served with pea puree and sea salt. \u00a0It was so yummy. \u00a0So subtle yet complex. \u00a0Sigh.  The food is very solid, higher-end brasserie food (oxymoron, right?). \u00a0I loved the snails (prepared in the traditional burdundy style, they serve with a lemon, which is a nice touch) and the french onion soup. \u00a0My companion had the burger, which was really good. \u00a0  Jamie Lauren was the executive chef when I was last there. \u00a0She has now left, so I do not know what the impact has been on the menu. \u00a0Based upon what I have seen of her on top chef all stars (Does she hate to cook??), it seems any impact she would have had on the kitchen would have been minimal. \u00a0And Carlos is still there.",

I would walk by this place often, check out the menu, and daydream about how much I would like to eat here someday.   Six years later, for my 30th birthday dinner, some of my best friends made it happen. (OK, granted I chose the menu and put down a $250 deposit to reserve our spot three months in advance... but all told, this dinner was meaningful because of the presence of my friends. Also, full disclosure, they paid for everything)  We had a prix-fixe menu (personalized for the occasion!) with several delicious selections, shared many a bottle of wine, our own table, and overall, had a great time.  Vanessa Harris and team were definitely accommodating and endlessly patient with me, what with my propensity for emailing via my phone (sometimes after a few drinks, I'm not gonna lie), the multiple last minute changes to the number in my final headcount and such, and they deserve a lot of credit for why this night ran as smoothly as it did.  This is probably the last time I'll ever do something so extravagant for a birthday dinner (well, until I turn 40), but this was a great way to close out the most eventful decade of my life!",

Joanna was really efficient about getting things set up and in order. the reservations and whatnot were a cinch and all i had to do was make a deposit of $250 (which would be deducted from the bill the night of the dinner).  we all arrived pretty much on time and didn't have to wait for our table. sometimes large parties like that get pushed back if the restaurant tries to fit a smaller party in earlier in the night (i used to work at a restaurant, so i know). the server was really nice and did a good job at timing the food so that we didn't feel rushed nor starving at any point. glasses of water were refilled often and he was super attentive. sometimes with large parties in which the gratuity is already added to the bill, the servers slack off a bit, knowing that they have a guaranteed tip coming their way.  the food was prepared nicely and everything seemed to be to everybody's liking. due to the large group we had a three course pre-fixe, in which i chose one of three differing menus (varying by price and entree options). i found this to be convenient for the restaurant as well as for myself so that i wouldn't have to narrow down options from their regular menu.   this is a great place for large parties.",

    "review_text": "Great food, ambiance and service! My dad and step-mom took me and my boyfriend here to celebrate my birthday and we had a great meal.  Strawberry Gazpacho: surprisingly delicious! I wasn't sure about the flavor combination (crab and cucumber salad with strawberry) but it was light, frothy, cool, slightly sweet and a fun pink color. The crab added some nice texture and the flavors worked well together. It was heavenly. I would go back and just have a bowl of it for lunch.  Steak Tartare: We were lucky enough to be there on a rare night they had a special - steak tartare with meat from Marin Sun Farms. It was very good.  Escargot: they were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of garlic and butter, served in the shell. Great introduction for my bf who had never tried them before.  Pork Confit: This was the highlight of the meal (besides the strawberry gazpacho). The meat literally melted in my mouth and the corn was a nice sweet touch that complimented the rest of the plate. I highly recommend this entree.  Dessert: we had 2 cheeses (blue d'auvergne and l'ami du chambertin), which were both good. I have a huge sweet tooth, so I ordered a white watermelon parfait, which was a bit bland and disappointing. Luckily, I mentioned on the Open Table reservation that it was my birthday so they brought out a complimentary blueberry tequila sorbet, which was amazing and had a very strong flavor.  We had a nice bottle of cab with dinner, but the cocktail menu looks amazing and I would return just to try some drinks, along with a bowl of the strawberry gazpacho and some cheese.  In short: try the strawberry gazpacho and pork confit.",

    "review_text": "As soon as we walked in, we were seated - Hubby made reservations early on and mentioned it was our anniversary. Before we were even seated, the front of the house wished us a \"congrats\" at least three different times. Overall, the experience was amazing. We arrived hungry and ready to order everything.   I ordered one of their popular drinks that I was curious about, since I read about it in Yelp - The Galapagos. There were two \"mysterious round objects\" on the bottom of my glass which I thought were either olives or blueberries...wrong! They were brandied cherries. Obviously, I didn't feel the need to bite into these round objects! Ha!  We started with their pan roasted mussels and clams which were in a chorizo, white bean broth - and we had to order their frites that came with a side of dijon mustard (didn't care for it), thyme infused malt vinegar (yum) and roasted bell pepper aioli (SO GOOD).   What to order, what to order. We wanted to try their soups since Chef was a self-proclaimed soup genius, \u00a0so we went for it. We ordered the celery root soup and french onion soup. So fantastic! I'm not a big onion lover (or liker), but the french onion soup at Absinthe was delicious. The celery root soup was good as well, very mild but comforting.   For dinner, I stayed true to my pledge to try grits for the first time so I ordered slow-cooked pork confit over house made bacon, collard greens, and cheese grits. It was very good but sadly our entrees took way too long to come out and after the starters, I was inching towards \"full status\". Hubby ordered their braised beef cheeks with smoked yams and sauteed kale. Damn, those yams! I couldn't stop eating them off his plate! And the beef cheeks were good too!   As full as I was, I had room in my belly...more like a desire...for dessert. We shared their cookie plate which included blood orange meltaways, double-chocolate-chipmalt cookie, chocolate hazelnut sticky bun, and Oreo cheesecake bites...HEAVEN! The double-chocolate-chipmalt cookie were mini versions of my fave cookie - the chocolate duet from Panera of all places. So I was especially happy. And they wrote Happy Anniversary in chocolate on the plate - nice touch! Thanks Absinthe!",

The food and drinks are simply phenomenal here, and if you really dislike something, they will try and fix it for you. I have only really done their mixed drinks - I try to stay away from the wine list because it's extensive - but my favorites are usually the ones on the chalkboard. Also, I really love the Wonderlust, which is a mixed absinthe drink.  A place like this would be more for a night on the town. The bar is really loud and fun, but you can always make reservations to sit in the dining room which tends to be more quiet. I would say that this is a dressy place, but my boyfriend and I love to just walk in. :) They are always really nice.  Also, I thought this place could not be anymore amazing than it already is, but it can. They serve brunch here on Saturdays and Sundays that is to die for. The Duck Confit and French-toast Brioche are both exquisite.  By the way, they have the BEST french onion soup. I almost never go here and not order it. :9",

While I would love to have a formal meal here, I have enjoyed my time at the bar.  The cocktail menu is fantastic. I love the names, and I love the drinks. They are definitely designer, with a designer price tag, but they don't shy away from the liquor in these drinks. The first time I went I had the Perfect Pear, which was a lovely drink. Last night, I ordered the Galapagos: pisco, pepper syrup and some other liquors mixed together and served a la Manhattan style - complete with cherry at the bottom. It was a stiff drink, but very good.  Last night we ordered the house made hot dog, and the first three starters: fries, marinated olives and chickpeas. I expected the chickpeas to be more crispy throughout, but only on the outside. The house made hot dog was specifically ordered to cross it off \"the List\". It was good - unique in that they make a \"house made\" hot dog, but I would never want to order it again. And, any other sausage place would serve a better dog. The sauerkraut was good; loved the caraway seeds.   This place just has an elegant feel, but is casual enough for you to sit and enjoy some appetizers and drinks in the bar. The crowd is mixed, and lots of ballet-goers hit it up before the show. Overall, a great time with good people!",

I got some grapefruit juice and wild mushroom omelette that was so good, even though the mushrooms got tiring after awhile. Most of the table got the breakfast sandwich which I would recommend as after having a bite or two of theirs I wanted more! And I love that my water was always filled. A sign of good service to me.   The service is great. One of the girls thought that she found a piece of a fingernail in her dish (it really did look like it), and we told our waiter who promptly got the manager to look into it. After doing some investigating, the manager realized it was bits of dried pasta that fell into her dish, but still took her meal off of the bill for the scare. He was courteous, professional, and warm about the entire affair and that was greatly appreciated.   And because we were there for my sister's bachelorette, they came out with this very sweet dessert plate for her at the very end (see picture).

That night we ordered: -French Onion Soup (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic1.px.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FsOzTcLnWPdUNGrC0HgrrIQ%2Fl&amp;s=1998f828f6376b7f9c80262173c82d5c34c53c060f6564d5739e7fcab6e66e52\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">static1.px.yelpcdn.com/b\u2026</a>) -Escargots in Shell (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic1.px.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2Fx9mWsxJTPOZq8wGaQ6snPw%2Fl&amp;s=3b45d1a00c53290778ff93f2aac4ea92853fe779a6bf6e664085269e193e7bd2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">static1.px.yelpcdn.com/b\u2026</a>) -Rabbit Rillettes (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic1.px.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2Fw2wEsVLB04x1ShoJwSmrPQ%2Fl&amp;s=08f23a1538c90957dd259636c3169e8083c6164e69b920bd3845a9891a8df0c3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">static1.px.yelpcdn.com/b\u2026</a>) -Sausage &amp; Cornbread Stuffed Mary's Chicken (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic1.px.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FEZ_JAKZe7LjazOvzwdbjZg%2Fl&amp;s=b8ae52ca870631ecba04c90df2f59fcea34636af26d70a4d74f71b8c0e3e5a1d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">static1.px.yelpcdn.com/b\u2026</a>) -Galapagos Cocktail (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic1.px.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2F6EW2J9ufQPEg05VtGtyqsw%2Fl&amp;s=5b8f8103aef6e7803237ee5493805bf7acad9dde8dfca45da07fe9038d5dca67\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">static1.px.yelpcdn.com/b\u2026</a>) -Old Havana Cocktail (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic1.px.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FFNn4pe5akVkUxW8yPBHC_g%2Fl&amp;s=f339a988724de0311d370f70502238b73ad7471145be22954a4fa0ed539162cb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">static1.px.yelpcdn.com/b\u2026</a>)  **The Good** My favorite dish of the night by far was the Sausage &amp; Cornbread Stuffed Mary's Chicken. This fantastic dish included apple parsnip puree, brussel sprouts, and cranberry gastrique. The chicken was extremely tender and juicy, and the cranberry gastrique was mind blowingly delicious! What was surprisingly amazing was the brussel sprouts. Normally I am not a big fan of veggies, but they were so crunchy and extremely luscious that they kept me eagerly eating more and more!  My most highly anticipated dish for the night, the French onion soup. While it didn't blow me away like the chicken dish, I did find it quite enjoyable. The taste was quite rich and simply delicious. The soup base is full of onion and was very flavorful. The cheese is gooey yet firm on the top and heavenly divine.   **The Forgettable** After getting a good buzz from our first stop and feeling quite adventurous, I was game to try some new dishes I've never experienced. \u00a0That's where the escargots and rabbit rillette came into place. The escargot was in a garlic herb butter sauce that offered an interesting texture and flavor. They were a bit chewy and rubbery for my preference and nothing spectacular. The rabbit rillette was a lot saltier then I was expecting, and reminded me of sweeter version of tuna fish.   I ordered the Galapagos cocktail mainly because it was #45 on 7x7's 2009 Big Eat SF List. I was very hesitant to order it after reading the ingredients, and after taking a sip I instantly knew I should have followed my gut instincts.  Service - I remember telling our waiter when we ordered the French onion soup that we wanted to share a large bowl. When the soup came I asked if we can each get 2 small bowls to split the soup. Then he apologized and said we couldn't split up the soup because of the makeup of it. Rather we should just take turns with the soup. Had we known this we would have just ordered two smalls bowls, thanks for nothing! Also, the service here is EXTREMELY slow.  Summary (2 stars): Don't believe the hype. Most of the dishes are ridiculously overpriced. Service is slower than the snails they serve!",

I'd read some reviews saying that portions here are on the smaller side, so when that dish came out I was like O_O. Barely ate half of it, but SO GOOD. There was this one bite of pure skin and it was heaven - crispy, salty, and paired with the red cabbage and jalapeno-cheddar grits = MMMMMMMM.  Definitely a great choice for a special dinner or when you've got some extra cash to blow. Great for groups or dates!",

    "review_text": "You know how you hear about how good a place is but just assume it's hype or you have a great business event at a place but assume the regular menu food isn't as good? That's totally what I did with Absinthe.  Really can't think of anything I haven't liked when dining here. Finally made it to dinner here recently after having only been during lunch and for business events.  We were celebrating the some good news and wanted to try lots of dishes so we avoided the larger plates and focused on the soups, salads and smaller courses. We ordered far more than we need to for two people and really indulged.  We started with the French Onion Soup and the Strawberry gazpacho, which turned out to be two of the best things we would have. While not vegans we were amazed and happy to learn that the gazpacho was vegan and made with no cream. It was so wonderful, I'm already planning on going back to have a big bowl of it for lunch.  I think the name french onion soup is funny since it's just onion soup outside of the US but this was one of the best onion soups we've had the US. It was a rich broth without being too salty which is a huge problem with most onion soups, the crouton was nice deep bread and the cheese was perfect in it.  Then we had the frisee salad with a duck egg, lardons on the side since the spouse doesn't eat meat. It was a HUGE salad, really a meal in itself.  Then we had the Escargot in shell. The meat of the snail was tender and soft with a nice earthy flavour.   For our entrees we had the blue nose bass and the beef cheeks.  Beef cheeks seem to be the new hot meat replacing pork belly as the must have high fat tasty flesh choice. That said, the beef cheeks were amazing. They were maple-syrup-glazed and served with smoked yams, saut\u00e9ed kale, horseradish cr\u00e8me fraiche. Horseradish creme fraiche is one of the best things ever and a perfect compliment to the beef cheeks.  The bass was tender while still being firm and the Winter squash puree, wilted chard and pecan brown butter vinaigrette all just brought out the flavour of the fish.   I really like that the vegetables that accompanied the dishes were all as well cooked and flavourful as the proteins.  We then had a cheese course which the cheese snob French spouse loved and declared to be very good.  The true test of the place came in dessert with the very simple pot creme which seems to be something American French restaurants have a hard time making. Usually they come out to liquid and too sweet but the chocolate pot de creme was just the right texture and flavour.  Having now eaten here a couple more times I think Absinthe is a great go to place for a first date, a special night or just as an occasional treat.",

He couldn't stop singing praises about Absinthe's libations and noted that he frequented the place quite often since he had dated one of the bartenders. We knew his suggestion could be trusted after seeing him pull out a special pack of imported beer for a German family that were regulars at his New Orleans bar. Obviously he cared about his customers enough to go the extra mile, let alone not to steer them in the wrong direction!  So, since my wedding date and I were dressed to the 9's on Saturday, we decided to stop in for a few drinks &amp; a snack while waiting for the reception room to open up. And... the bartender couldn't have been more right! The cocktails ARE top of the line.  After having a crappy sidecar in NYC that left a bad taste a-lingering, I was ready to put Absinthe to the test and see if they could wash away the bad experience. Absinthe ended up rising to the occasion and had me on Cloud 9 once I sipped that well-crafted drink to the last drop. Yum! With a perfect 10 cocktail like that, how could I not order up another drink?? So, I pointed to one that I saw a server delivering to a table, which was like a cross b/w a caiparanha &amp; a mojito (its name starts w/ a \"C\"), but better!   We also shared an order of fries that came not w/ ketchup, but thyme-infused vinegar, Dijon mustard &amp; rouille for dipping. What a lovely alternative to the norm and the fries were long gone once it was time to head out.  Hats off to that bartender in New Orleans. He sure has excellent taste!!",

Being located near Van Ness and the San Francisco Ballet makes parking a little difficult at night but with a little patience and a few circles around the block, you can snag free residential parking.   The first time I came to Absinthe was for the girlfriend's 21st birthday brunch. We were seated in a nice cushy, round booth that had enough space to fit a party of four. Ordered the duck-confit ragout and eggs benedict. Both were absolutely delicious and surprisingly not to heavy for brunch. Midway through I asked the waitress if there was any special for the birthday girl and they were nice enough to provide a scoop of vanilla ice cream with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate. It even came with a candle place right in the middle of the ice cream.   The second time was with a larger party, without reservations for dinner. The wait was approximately 40 minutes and we were seat at a very small round table in the bar area of Absinthe. Ordered the Sacred Heart to eat with my Spicy Pork Meatball snack, Duo of California Lamb, and Absinthe Hamburger with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and Vermont cheddar cheese. Don't judge me I was so hungry after the wait I needed to sample their pork, lamb, and beef. And I am thankful I did because Absinthe did a fantastic job cooking the protein and flavoring it. Even the Sacred Heart was a surprisingly sweet, yet tart absinthe cocktail. \u00a0I will definitely be back again and again for the food and drinks.   What I recommend:  -- Absinthe burger",

We ended up using our bread plates, which they promptly took away after another round of appetizers. Finally, we all held on to our plates for dear life and fiercely protected them against the invasion of the dish snatchers. 3) The bar was backed up so much it took 40 minutes for my friend J to get her second drink. 4) Overall I think the food was really good, but the price tag was a little stiff for my poor little wallet.  Here's what we pigged out on last night: 1) Soft Garlic Pretzels with Vermont cheddar Mornay - hot, soft and chewy. It was yummy but not outstanding. 2) French Fries - I have always loved Absinthe fries, especially with the smoky tomato ketchup. 3) Spicy Pork Meatballs - don't know how they tasted, since my boyfriend ate his, then stole mine while I was distracted with a dish-snatching situation. I am told they were divine. I will probably go back just for these. 4) Maine Scallops - these were pretty good, but 3 for $15? That's just a little too expensive for me. 5) Beef Tartare - my second favorite dish of the evening. The cornichons were diced and mixed with the meat, providing a nice tangy taste and crunchy texture. 6) Absinthe Hamburger - also ordered a fried egg on top. It was a good burger, but nothing really stood out. 7) Masami Farms Pork Loin - now this, this was AMAZING. Juicy pork loin, crispy pork belly. The sauce was divine, and we sopped up every little bit with bread.  Will probably head back once in a while, but not a go-to place for me.",

Oysters: I don't even like, normally, but the Pt Reyes were friggin tasty.  Lamb: This was my entree and it couldn't have been done better. The meat was perfectly cooked and the vegetables were..perfectly cooked. I need to find another word. Lamb is from California, too. I don't mind the gamey, lambey taste, at all, in fact I like it, but they said this wouldn't have it, and they are right. So, non-lamb-lovers would eat this too. I loved.  Coq Au Vin: Too smokey for my taste.   Panna Cotta: Buttermilk with strawberries and basil creme. The best panna cotta I've EVER eaten.   We also got one of their cheese plates but it was too mild -- our bad.  For a butt-ton of food and a little wine it was around $150, after tip, etc. (Special occasion and a zillion courses for two people, so that felt like a deal.)",

Maybe they all came during brunch, or ... I don't know, happy hour. I'm not sure, but the dinner experience was far from good and far more expensive than I would ever pay for a place like this and food of this caliber.   We arrived as a group of 6 and were seated after 30 minutes of waiting despite having made a reservation and not going during \"peak\" dinner hour. We were seated in the back room and the hostess came to hand us our menu's. After that I think we didn't see anyone for at least 15 minutes while we were waiting to order some drinks.  After the drink orders were in, we ordered an appetizer and some food. The appetizers came quickly, but it took almost 30 minutes for our food orders to come. Two orders were wrong, one order had cheese for someone who was lactose intolerant even though it was specified for that dish to have no cheese and one pasta dish was cold.   It took another 20 minutes to resolve the issues and by this time our dinner party had been at Absinthe for almost 2 hours before we even really started our meals. There was just so much waiting.  I think this place is overhyped, unfortunately and the bar needs to be set a bit lower. Our total bill came out to be $90 per couple and all we ordered were two drinks, two entrees and split an appetizer. That's pretty outrageous.",

I ordered the Duck Confit Ragout which sits on poached eggs, a chive potato cake and toast on the side, I truly fell in love!!!!!!!!

It was very busy and there was only one bartender who handled all of the bar and all the drinks for the restaurant and that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

The food we ordered was good, not spectacular but high quality. \u00a0I think it would have been better if we had received when we were still hungry but the food took about an hour to receive and many others were seated after us but go their food before us, so at that point we weren't so much hungry but past the point of being hungry... And not in the best of spirits.  The brunch and drink menu are both quite comprehensive and good selections are available. \u00a0The choices are also various in ingredients and unique in flavors. \u00a0I liked the variety and style of the food.  The service when we were first arrived was a bit low, as the host was a little rude when we put our names on the list to be seated...we did get a seat at the bar but the bartender took about 10 minutes to even take our order...

The decor is of class without being snobbish. \u00a0The service is of the same regard.  I started my morning out with a shot of espresso. \u00a0Strong, black and tasty, just the way I like it. \u00a0  Their creative cocktail list gets me going at 11AM each time. \u00a0Many of the cocktails point to their origin or accolades which I found to be a nice touch. \u00a0My last trip I ordered the Sazerac which features rye whiskey, absinthe, and bitters among other components which I now have forgotten. \u00a0It was boozy and delicious. \u00a0  We have ordered and split the whole crab each time and were never disappointed. \u00a0Served with drawn butter, this is fun, family style, get your hands dirty kind of fun. \u00a0  I ordered the croque monsieur both time for brunch as I rarely have an opportunity to have this great sandwich. \u00a0This place does it right; oh so tasty.  Two others in my party had the prime rib. \u00a0I thought it was very tender, flavorful and exceptional. \u00a0Easily my mother's favorite cut of meat, I heard her go all the way to 'best I've ever had.'  I tried a bit of the heirloom tomato BLT. \u00a0For a BLT, I found it in a category of its own. \u00a0Just a combination of great ingredients, fresh heirlooms, thick cut bacon and top notch bread. \u00a0Really, really good.

Their menu offers both classic dishes and more unique restaurant specialties that are definitely worth a try!  We started with the potato and duck croquettes and the garlic soft pretzels. I'm not usually big on croquettes or duck, but these were done perfectly with a crispy exterior and a creamy potato inside. The duck filling wasn't too gamey, and the sauce on top really brought it all together. The garlic soft pretzels were almost like garlic bread bites and the texture of the pretzel was perfect. Both were on the heavier side, but they were elevated at the same time.  I had the grilled octopus entree, which came with a great puree to complement the octopus. The octopus itself was the most well-cooked octopus I've ever had. The texture was not at all rubbery, and it ended up being almost tender like fish or chicken. The char flavor was perfect and the greens on the side brightened up the whole dish. We also shared the mac and cheese side, which kind of made our meal over-the-top rich, but I loved the cheeses they used in it.

He loves smoky flavors, and the mezcal is fantastic in this drink. \u00a0Pretty much all of their cocktails are solid. \u00a0I have never had a bad cocktail here. \u00a0They have fantastic bar bites, and classic, straight forward bistro food.

    "review_text": "Five years ago this week, Absinthe once again became legal to sell stateside.   The herb-infused liquor was banned in countries worldwide due to the supposedly hallucinogenic effects of the wormwood, one of it's main ingredients.  Celebrated the occasion by starting at this landmark Hayes Valley bar for a guys night out pub crawl. The crowd for a Thursday night was Marina-like without the attitude. Pretty loud at the bar but you could still hear. Even though it's classy looking while being a little dressy, the atmosphere was unpretentious. The dining area did look a little more \"business\".   I liked how the hand-shaken and stirred absinthe cocktails weren't too herbal-y or menthol-ish. Who wants the taste of a ricola and coke or mouthwash and tonic?   Their sacred heart ($11) made with tequila, limoncello, lime was refreshing. The sazerac ($9), a classic and essential New Orleans cocktail, was good too. Here, expertly crafted precision trumps a heavy pour.   None of us had any hallucinogenic effects but I'm sure anyone after drinking several of these would suffer from a case of beer goggles.

I was on the verge of desperation and planning to go thru my recycle bin like Charlie from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory frantically buying/opening chocolate bars in hopes of finding the golden ticket! \u00a0As i was about to put on the plastic gloves, I decided to send an email to Absinthe, cross my fingers and hope for the best...of course, with very low expectations as most places are not responsible for lost/stolen cards.

I am thoroughly confused about why this place is so recommended, packed, and on 7x7's top 100 list.   We tried their \"infamous\" hotdog featured on 7x7's The Big Eat SF, one of the things you have to try before you die. And honestly... I could definitely die without trying it. Priced at $12, I thought it would be mammoth-sized or at least spilling out of its bun due to all the deliciously complementary fillings... ENK! Wrong on both levels. It was a normal sized hotdog that came with mustard, ketchup, and onions on the side. Okay... well the sausage had to at least been good right?... It was bland. Let's just say I'd choose the $1 hotdogs at Costco over Absinthe's hotdog anyday.   The fries where pretty good. They're shoe-string fries that come with 3 dipping sauces: mustard, vinegar, and this delicious orange radish sauce. (I doused my hotdog in that sauce which in my opinion barely saved the hotdog.)  On to cocktails ... contrary to popular belief, I did not enjoy the Galapagos. Maybe I'm not a huge pisco fan.. I don't know but it just smelled and tasted like tequila with 3 tapioca balls on the bottom of the cocktail class (can anyone tell me what the hell the balls were for?). So if your a tequila fan, this is the drink for you. The Ginger Roger's was yummy but yummy in a i'm-on-vacation-tanning-by-the-pool kind of way. It tasted like a mojito made with a splash of ginger ale. Not really what I had expected.   So how was my overall experience? Just like the drinks, not really what I had expected after reading all the good reviews.",

    "review_text": "We came for the Dine About a Town Lunch menu on a weekday. I tried to make the reservation for the weekend originally via OpenTable. However, when I called in the day of (Saturday), they said they tried to call me and tell me that they don't do DAT on weekends. I never got that call or any message so it was lucky I was running late that day.   Anyways, I came the following week on a Tuesday with 2 friends for DAT, an $18.95 two course lunch. I got the GRILLED PORK TENDERLOIN which was a small portion (cut into four small pieces), which was delicious. It was nice and juicy. I didn't like the panna cotta dessert although I think my friends did. It just tasted too cheesy for me and reminded me more of cheesecake than panna cotta. But maybe that's how it's supposed to be here...  My other friend got the DAT menu with the CROQUE MONSIEUR, which was a Black Forest ham sandwich. This was more like a lunch! The portion was definitely bigger than my pork so she shared some with me. It was good! The ham and the cheese sandwich (although simple) definitely hit the spot.   My last friend ordered from the menu and got the burger, which she enjoyed. I didn't get to try any of that, unfortunately.   My overall impression of the DAT lunch menu is that the selections were not great. I mean, there were 3 entrees to choose from but the pork was so small that I would have been better off just ordering straight from the regular menu. And skip the dessert if it's the panna cotta. This lunch wasn't that worth it but I think I'll have to come in for a real meal so I can possibly re-review this place. I felt like I got a preview of what they may have to offer but I need to try some of the other things!   One last note though... Our server was a bit too persistent with our orders. For example, she asked if we wanted anything from the bar and suggested some drinks. We said no thank you. She went on to suggest (it felt like) 10 other drinks. No thank you. We were having lunch in between class and really didn't want a drink! We already said we wanted water only. That should be enough.",

For desert I went for the vanilla creme brulee that was also as good as I ever had. \u00a0Went 'traditional' with the cocktail: spicy bloody mary. \u00a0This is probably the only food item that I can say \"i've had better elsewhere\". \u00a0Too thin and definitely inferior to that of Foreign Cinema.

Ambiance- Located at the heart of Hayes Valley it was amusing to see a mixed crowd. \u00a0The majority are obviously well dressed wealthy people but there are a couple tables with t-shirt wearing funky young folks. \u00a0It's fancy without being stuck up.  Price- Not a cheap price for sure; but for $35 per person we felt like it was a good price considering we ate really well. \u00a0That covers the cocktail, 2 starters to share by 4 people, entrees and 2 desert.",

There was a ton of mushrooms and just the right amount of cheese that it didn't over power the other components. The plate comes with these amazing potatoes. I'm not sure what the potatoes are called, but they were similar to chunky homestyle fries. They were crisp on the outside and very flavorful. I love their generous use of herbs here.   Great decor with big cushy chairs. The only thing that freaked me out was the absinthe green monster that was painted into all of their murals.

I drank Pastisse every night that I was in Paris and tend to miss it here in the States unless I just serve it at home. Service is impeccable, however prices are a bit high and it is incredibly trendy so it can get pretentious and overly packed in the evenings and weekends.

    "review_text": "How you have taunted me with your green sign and promises of licorice flavored liquid. Hehe, my boyfriend and I didn't try any absinthe today (seeing as how some of the stuff they offer we already have at home!) but we did enjoy the cuisine!  A recap of the wonderful meal (and yes, just two of us ate all this...I think we'll pay for this with bigger butts and thighs)  1) Spicy fried chickpeas: Think of this as a fresh version of your favorite wasabi pea snacks. Except with the wasabi or peas, and instead you have crispy, spicy chickpeas that leave flavor lingering on your tongue and lips. Mm.  2) Oyster shots: Large oysters in the half shell with shots of Bloody Mary mix. Mmm. You couldn't really taste the oysters and lemon anymore, but these shots were zesty!   3) French fries: Comes in a large silver cone/cup, with three different dipping sauces (malt vinegar, dijon mustard, and rouille). The fries were both crispy, stringy, and thin - good! And salted just right. I couldn't stop eating them.   4) Escargots - Served hot and buttery, with lemon, and with toasted bread triangles. The tongs and skewers are cute and make eating them less messy!  5) Country pate - The pate is made of pork, not goose (sadness!) and has a rather sweet flavor to it. If you like lighter, sweeter pate, this is ideal for you, but my boyfriend and I like the heavier, fattier goose or savory pork pates, so we didn't enjoy this dish as much. Came with toasted bread triangles as well, mini pickles, and mustard.  6) Beef cheeks - The meat was SO tender and fell apart. Potatoes were creamy!  7) Grilled scallops - A little heavy on the herb crust, but the scallops were tender, and the winter squash puree was SO GOOD! I kept scooping it up with my spoon and licking it. Mmm.  8) Mushroom flatbread - I wasn't a fan of this, the whole thing tasted a bit..gamey?? I think it was the goat cheese..and I normally do not like goat cheese..  The service was okay, our waiter was fairly quiet and didn't interact with us as much as we're used to other waiters, but overall, a very very pleasant and fun meal!",

    "review_text": "I could have sworn I reviewed the Absinthe Brasserie and Bar. It was near and dear to my heart at many of Happy Hour Celebrations and Lunches over the years of working in the Hayes Valley area.  While I am not a fan of Gin, Absinthe inroduced me to cocktails I couldn't say no to. The 21 Hayes is Gin, cucumber, Pimm's, lemon, sugar, cucumber slice, onion and splendid. The Corpse Reviver #2 is Gin, Cointreau, Lillet Blanc, absinthe, lemon, lemon twist and introduced me to Absinthe cocktails.   While enjoying cocktails at the bar, I highly recommend trying the cheese plates - you can mix and match your picks in 3 or 5 selections. They also have oysters, which I am a huge fan of - but have yet to try here.   The french fries are good as a snack, but the Absinthe Burger is the real deal. Start with the Angus Burger and add on some smoked gouda, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, gruy\u00e8re or even a fried egg. The burger is not your average patty, so be prepared or split for a great mini meal.   I'll have to come bring my guy here one day, he loves the word Brasserie, Gin cocktails, Oysters, Cheese Plates, French Fries and Really Tasty Burgers too.",

I chose one of their popular dishes, the Pork Osso Buco. Delicous. The meat just fell off the bone. It came with root vegetables. A hearty meal. I ate almost all of it. For dessert, we had the strawberry tarragon pavlova. Don't know what that is? Neither did we. We ate. We loved it. Very flavorful and not too sweet. What a wonderful place. A great place to get full.

Upper-middle class crowd, but I come in jeans and tee to meet my dad for dinner any way.   Great service, waiters working for their tips, and managers picking up any slack. They got us in and out fairly quickly; even though there's an annoyingly huge line of onlookers without reservations watching you eat, waiting to dine themselves.  Absinthe seems like one of those places that is so into being 'of the moment' that their food sucks or lacks love... not the case. I ordered stuffed chicken breast with vegetables. I honestly expected it to be just so-so; something I pick at and probably don't finish. But I cleaned the plate!   I have this problem with these pseudo fancy restaurants in San Francisco that they either over or under season their food. Sometimes I bite into my asparagus and think, \"did they taste this when they made it? Or go straight from recipe?\"  Moist chicken, tasty brussels sprouts, and enough on my plate that I can finish all of it and then take off walking quickly without getting sick.  Full bar + Easy walk-to location + Good food + good service = one of the better restaurants to impress your hot new date.",

A colleague and I decided to be adventurous after a long day at a conference/training Fortunately, we share an appreciation for classy ambiance and delicious food. Absinthe provided both. We made rezzies via OpenTable the night before and scored a rezzie at 7:30pm. Great, diverse crowd upon arrival - the ambiance, food, service created the perfect experience.   Let's talk food...  Cauliflower Soup. SO good. I could've eaten two bowls of just this and I would have been happy. Velvety, piping hot, and topped with brioche croutons. I'll need another bowl of this when I return.   Beef Tartare. Perfection. The \"accroutements\" of green apple, red onion, cornichons, and quail egg yolk created a festival of flavors when paired with the crostini. \u00a0Deliciously indulgent.   Local Sole. The fish was cooked perfectly - moist and juicy - and accompanied by sun dried tomatoes, beans, brussel sprouts, and braised artichokes with a light lemon-based sauce. So freshing and hearty at the same time.   Ice Cream. We opted for a trio of cinnamon, browned butter, and vanilla. Together, the flavors blended well although my colleague and I agreed that the browned butter was the standout.   If I had to choose a last meal, this would be it. I can't wait to go back.",

I waited until I've tried both dinner and brunch menus to write the review and I wish I had half star options because the brunch was 3 stars and dinner was 4 stars. Maybe my expectation was too high from the anticipation, but I was so underwhelmed for the brunch menu.   French onion soup: good, but the french onion soup at chez maman is better  Croque Monsieur: not sure what I missed, but it was very ordinary, even when soaked in my favorite thing in the world...runny egg yolk!  Shrimp salad roll: The description sounded amazing. Tobasco aioli, avocados and malt vinegar chips. I tasted no tobasco, came with no avocados and it was just shrimp with mayo in stale bread. The chips were not vinegary at all. What a waste of money (sad face)  Fries: skinny fries with winning aiolis.   Spicy pork meatballs: moist and flavorful  Coq au vin: this chicken is out of control. I'm pretty sure if I can cook chicken like this, I would be married by now.   Oh I can't forget about the booze. They are fancy pants when it comes to cocktails and it comes with a very extensive wine list. Service was great. My coffee cup was refilled about 5 times. Will come back for dinner again!",

It was good, but it wasn't OMG GREAT. \u00a0I judge a lot of brunch places on their lattes. \u00a0What's a brunch without a good, hot savory latte? \u00a0My soy latte came out in a huge bowl cup and it was steamy hot, but it just wasn't that satisfying. \u00a0Not enough espresso punch to it. I'd much rather head over to Blue Bottle around the corner.  I had the ricotta stuffed french toast. \u00a0It sounded awesome. \u00a0The portion was huge with 4 very thick slices of toast and berries on the side. \u00a0The first slice was good, but not melt in your mouth good. \u00a0Anything after was just OK and it became real repetitive. \u00a0It was also quite heavy. \u00a0Great concept and presentation though, so I give them props there.  My bf had the wild mushroom something omelet. \u00a0There was a TON of cheese which masked the mushroom flavor and the eggs weren't amazing fluffy or anything. \u00a0He did order a side of the Benton's bacon which was lightly covered in maple syrup which I found very delicious.  Our friend had the fried green tomatoes. \u00a0I didn't try any of it but she seemed pretty pleased and her plate was clean afterwards.

At some other places, the beef tartare is too mustardy for me but this was just right!  Any of the drinks are strong and taste delicious so you can't go wrong here. Again the drinks are pretty strong, just the way I like it :)  As for the entrees, I had the monkfish and it was done perfectly but my bf and I felt that the menu for entrees was too simple?

The BAD: 1. \u00a0One of only two meals I ate in SF (over a 5 month period) where I had nothing to put here. \u00a0  Overall, absolutely great meal, and a breath of fresh air after underwhelming meals (at least for the money spent) at Fleur de Lys and Gary Danko.",

The super loud and hustling bar section filled with beer fragances, the medium noised bistro sounding resturant seating section, and the quiet, more romantic dim lighting section.   We ordered:  *Snacks Soft Garlic Pretzels $8 (2 od 5) - was ok. I read other reviewers and they were disappointed. I guess I was pretty disappointed too. Garlic wasn't in baked in the pretzel. Just came out as finger sized pretzels. Nothing special other than it came with small tub of rich melted butter mashed with some garlic. And the garlic wasn't even that strong. I wouldn't recommend it. Try something else. *Masami Farms Pork Osso Buco $27 (4 of 5) served with white bean stew, baby root vegetables, citrus gremolata, pork jus - was good. The pork meat fell off bone. I liked the tiny texture and taste details on the plate. There was a crunchy sprinkle of something that blended very well with the soft pork pieces. The white bean stew was soft, and also complimented the pork very well. I thought this dish was well-executed. Green garlic mash *10oz Rib Eye Steak $35 (3 of 5) served with green garlic-whipped potatoes, grilled asparagus, green peppercorn jus - Steak good but not a wow. The cut was thin, would have been nicer if it was thicker. Mash potato was made from green garlic and gave it a wonderful color. Again, plating was very pretty.  *Opera Cake $10 (4 of 5) espresso custard, chocolate ganache, almond jocande cake, orange - was superb. Layers of delicate flavors. Every layer had a different flavor and texture.  *Cinnamon ice cream (free because it was birthday celebration) (2.5 of 5) - \u00a0was fresh and strong. Like eating a Big Red Stick of Gum. Creative but cinnamon is not my favorite.  Overall, I give a thumbs up to the main entrees and dessert. The pretzel listed on the 7X7 2012 Big Eat should be removed from the list. And make sure you have time to look for parking. It took me 20 minutes to find parking.",

I've been here for brunch, dinner &amp; drinks/appetizers, and here are my favorites:  Brunch:  - Deviled Eggs - best deviled eggs I've ever had in my life. - Duck Confit Ragout - what other people WISHED they had ordered. Get it. You won't regret.  Drinks/Appetizers:  - Soft Garlic Pretzels - warm (REALLY WARM), chewy, pretzels w/cheese dipping - Parmesan-Garlic Popcorn - warm, greasy &amp; addicting - Spicy fried chickpeas - there's a bit of heat in these  I like the bloody Mary (virgin), but I tasted my friend's Ginger Rogers, and I could barely taste the alcohol (that's a sign of a good drink, to me).  Dinner:   I've had the lamb &amp; steak here &amp; would highly recommend both. Consider yourself warned, however, that the portions are ginormous &amp; very heavy, so make sure you are starving before you get dinner here.  Desert:  Chocolate pot de creme is the only way to go :0)",

On this most recent visit, I ordered the gazpacho to start while my friend ordered the duck leg. \u00a0The starters were well portioned. \u00a0The soup, which seemed to be rather popular that night, was not what I was used to. \u00a0It is basically tomato soup with some diced avocado, a fried squash squash blossom and drops of balsamic vinegar. \u00a0I was worried that the soup would be too acidic but when eaten with the avocado and sweet vinegar, the combination was delicious and balanced. \u00a0A situation where the sum was greater than its parts. \u00a0My friend really enjoyed the confit of duck.  For the main course, I ordered the halibut while my dining companion ordered the cannelloni. \u00a0Okay, so this is the reason for the less than five star rating. \u00a0The portions were TINY, as in appetizer-sized portions. \u00a0The halibut could not have been more an 3 ounces and came with 3 or 4 small shrimp and 4 tiny mussels. \u00a0 Seriously, where's the rest of the fish? \u00a0For being one of the most expensive items on the menu for and for being the reason why our entrees were taking so long to be served, I expected so much more. \u00a0The only time I've seen portions of this size is when it is part of a 5+ course meal. \u00a0Aside from being slightly salty, I did enjoy this dish and just wished there had been more of it. \u00a0The cannelloni were on the small size as well and my friend did not enjoy them at all - taste, texture or \u00a0flavor. \u00a0  To end our meal we decided to order a selection of three cheeses - Humboldt Fog, Flagship and the Ossau Iraty. \u00a0The servings of each cheese was sizable and the cheeses were delicious! \u00a0It came with a basket of walnut bread. \u00a0The waiter was kind enough to wrap up what we could not finish as he knew we really enjoyed these cheeses. \u00a0A snack at intermission, perhaps?  The staff here are very accustomed to the performance crowd and getting people seated and served in plenty of time to make curtain time. \u00a0Service is very efficient and professional. \u00a0The restaurant is dark and feels cozy even though seating is spread out amongst several rooms.  A solid choice with good food and service.",

I already knew I was going to love this place before I looked at the menu.   We arrived a little early, so the three of us ordered cocktails at the bar, I tried the Chuauca, which tasted just like a shot of Apricot Liqueur chilled over ice up.. and my friends ordered one of the drink specials of the night with Absinthe. I tried Absinthe for the first time and -- I'm not sure if I'm a fan..it tastes similar to black licorice, but not as good.. ;-)   Once we were seated, the service was incredible! We each ordered something different--the Market Vegetable Plate, the Arctic Char, and the Sole. The Someliar came over and helped a couple of us figure out the perfect wine specifically to match each of our dishes. It was very nice. We finished off our meal with the Butternut Squash Cake-- which was similar to carrot cake but even better and not as sweet! I loved it. Absinthe is a classy joint.

I'm only going to be raving about how awesome and tasty and amazingly great service this place was, so let's just get to the facts.  #1 - MAKE A RESERVATION (use opentable, it's so easy). We made a reservation for 5pm, and as soon as we arrived, we were seated promptly at 5pm. Those with reservations also get seated in the better areas (less noise, more cozy and intimate). Usually (as many will note) that the wait here is pretty long. So don't forget to make a reservation!  #2 - Go with a half glass of wine. There's so many to choose from... this is an AWESOME way to get to try a ton of their wines. And it keeps the bill low, too.  #3 - Start with the spicy fried chickpeas and flatbread. OMG melt in your mouthe gooey ooey amazing sensations. \u00a0The flatbread for sure is a MUST HAVE.  #4 - ORDER the French Onion Soup. I guarantee you this is the best french onion soup you'll ever have. The broth was perfect, the cheese amount was just right... I didn't feel like I was going to get a heart attack after, either, like I normally do with other french onions.  #5 - The burger is OK - tempting because of the price, but I wouldn't recommend it as the best dish ever. And if you do order it, skip the caramelized onions. I would DEFINITELY add sauteed mushrooms if you like mushrooms, those were delish.  Those are my 5 quick tips. I'm sure you'll enjoy as much as I did! I plan to come back for sure to try the Duck Confit, Escargot, and Pan seared scallops.... :-)",

At first I wasn't wowed by the menu, but found I was too quick to judge. My boyfriend and I split the large french onion soup which they brought out in two bowls. It was delicious. I wish I had ordered the large for myself. I'm used to french onion soup having a foul smell (even though it tastes good), but I didn't seem to have that problem here. There was just the right amount of gooey cheese on the top, and the bread in the soup was soaked just enough to still be chewy. For our entrees, I had the pork Osso Buco and my boyfriend had the duck. I've had Osso Buco once before at another place. It was fantastic and I was hoping the one here would be just as good. They did not disappoint. The pork was tender and perfectly seasoned. My only complaint was the portion size! I could have wolfed down 3 portions, it was so good. The duck was a little too sweet for my taste, but my boyfriend loved it. We finished up with the squash cake and German chocolate cake. We had to wait a while for dessert, but the waiter made it up to us by taking the squash cake off our bill. My only (actual) complaint was the waiter refilling my boyfriend's $15 drink without asking first if he wanted another. Of course, I was the only one complaining. We loved the food and would definitely come back.",

Our waiter for the evening was a nice enough guy, but I actually liked his substitute better. \u00a0When he went off on a break, a waitress came by to take our orders and tend to our table initially. \u00a0She was really friendly and a little more sociable with us (not to mention pretty cute too). \u00a0For the winos out there, their selection of bottles on hand is very impressive. \u00a0The choices are plentiful with a huge price range, and their cocktail menu certainly holds its own as well.  We didn't order the Soft Garlic Pretzel appetizer since unfortunately, we didn't realize it was the hot item on their menu. \u00a0Sadly, I begged off on the French Onion soup as well since I didn't have the space for it, but I see that other Yelpers have liked it quite a bit. \u00a0No matter though, since I'm sure I'll be coming back sooner rather than later to knock both of my to-eat list. \u00a0Now I just regret that I took a while to finally trying Absinthe (the restaurant, not the alcohol...definitely tried that before...haha).",

Just not out of this world.  Had the large fresh squeezed orange juice--kind of expensive at like 6 bucks a glass, but it was tasty orange juice, to be fair.  Also had a soy cafe latte and IT WAS HUGE. \u00a0Came in a cup without a handle, totally traditional feeling. \u00a0Tasted good, but needed sugar since it was a little bitter and frothy.  The menu is pretty interesting looking with neat sounding breakfast food and lunch food too (like burgers). \u00a0The deviled eggs sounded good but it had smoked salmon and I don't care for that so I opted not to get it. But I did see a lot of people around with it.  I started with the french onion soup since the reviews said it was good: it was. \u00a0very tasty and yummy. \u00a0Not too strong a flavor and not too much overpowering cheese or bread. 4.5 STARS  Then I had the duck confit ragout over a potato cake with poached eggs. \u00a0It looks neat like a eggs benedict and it was good. \u00a0The duck was good, the everything was good. \u00a0I got the bernaise sauce on the side and I'm glad because I didn't love the combination since the bernaise is just so heavy and thick. \u00a0I don't know if I have to have this again but it was ok. I ate half of it and that was more because I didn't think the calories were worth the effort it'd take to burn it off later. 3 STARS  The french toast was ok. \u00a0Had really sweet stuff on top and the bread was super bready and eggy too. \u00a01.5 STARS.  So it was a mixed experience. \u00a0I hear the burgers are really good and the overall feel of the place is cool. \u00a0I'd try it again, but to be honest, I'm more of a Curbside Cafe girl. But that might be because I love their french onion soup and corned beef hash and french toast dishes like no other!  It's on opentable: make a reservation, it's worth it.

The menu has a nice assortment of oysters.   The Croque Monsieur with an egg (technically Croque Madam) is rich &amp; delicious - not soggy like some places.   The assortment of cheeses are intriguing with well paired accompaniments. Try 3 on each visit.   The Scharffen Berger Chocolate Pot De Cr\u00e8me with cr\u00e8me chantilly is rich &amp; creamy - would be heaven if the chocolate was darker. I miss the Creme Brulee &amp; Chocolate Tarte with salted caramel.   Chocolate Cherry Baked Alaska with beet cake &amp; cocoa nib paper sounded more intriguing than it tasted.   Master mixologists create the cocktails.",

Took the Mr M there for his birthday last night and we had a great time - romantic booth for two - a french wine that knocked my socks off, bone marrow appetizer with a parsley salad that I could have had a giant bowl of to myself, scallops for me, lamb for him, absinthe for the mister and of course the decadent warm chocolate banana tart for dessert.   What I think I like the best is that fact that I am not bombarded with a huge plate of food for dinner - it is enough that I can enjoy but not feel stuffed - even the lamb shank was on the smaller side but delicious and so slow cooked my husband pulled the bone out and the meat fell all over the plate.   Another great meal!!! Im so moving into the back room",

After much thought, and the narrowing down of a long, long, long list of places- I finally decided Absinthe was the perfect spot to celebrate my boyfriend's 25th birthday with him (my treat)! I'm still quite happy with my choice, though it doesn't go down as one of my favorites.  I made us a 6:00 p.m. reservation for Tuesday evening, which was hardly necessary; the place wasn't all that busy. We were immediately seated in a corner table, which was cute and romantic. The ambiance in the main dining room is quite nice, and perfect for a romantic meal.  Our server, though not overly friendly, was attentive and like-able enough. He was kind enough to go over the drink menu with us, suggest some favorites, and give us the time we needed to make our decision. I ordered the 21 Hayes. Although refreshing, something about an onion as a garnish turned me off. Additionally, I'm not a big fan of the parts of cucumber (at least, I think it was cucumber) that eventually settled at the bottom of the glass. Those last few sips were less than delightful. The boyfriend ordered the Sacred Heart- and absolutely loved it. I liked it as well, though I'm not a huge fan of the anise taste.  To start, we ordered the meatballs. These were melt in your mouth delicious! I wish I would have just ordered these for dinner! The cheese crostini that comes with them are delicious as well.  Although aiming for a fancy meal, he ordered the burger and added Gruyere and the spicy caramelized onions. This $18 burger did not disappoint! He states it's the best burger he's ever had in his entire life (and he would know- he eats enough of them)!  I ordered the Mahi-Mahi with Prawn. Although flavorful and delicious, I can't believe I spent $31 on this dish. I wouldn't order it again on the value principle alone.  We had a lovely meal, but I'm not sure Absinthe won me over. If you're in the Hayes Valley area, it may be worth checking out, but if you're willing to expand your geographical area, I can think of other places that have won me over.",

I ate the leftovers (cold) for breakfast the next morning. \u00a0Standing up. \u00a0In front of the bathroom sink.  The burger TOTALLY satisfied my craving, and was made from grass-fed beef, which seems much more usual in SF than in NY. \u00a0(I can't figure out why NY restaurants are so ass-backwards with the grass-fed beef thing.) \u00a0It's rather pricey and doesn't include fries (mercifully, really), but with a hunk of gruyere on top, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, that burger hit the spot and was worth every penny.  My sister had a gorgeous roasted veggie sandwich along with homemade chips. Not as gloriously satisfying as my burger, but delicious nonetheless.  For dessert, we went light with blueberry tequila sorbet, which was served with agave katafi (new to me, reminded me of shredded wheat and provided a nice foil to the smoothness of the sorbet) and lime \"jello.\" \u00a0This was such a perfect summer dessert, not at all heavy, and we loved the combination of textures.  Service was not great-- slow-- but it was an off time and we were extra impatient because of our hunger. \u00a0I love the neighborhood it's in! \u00a0I just regret not going back to get one of their cocktails!",

We got seated right next to the bar and the entire restaurant was LOUD. It took a while to get service and when we did it was mediocre which was the total opposite of what we'd experienced all over SF.   We both got drinks which were definitely yummy! I can't remember but I know mine had prosecco and his had gin.   Food:  country pate earned a good review from my husband but not a great one.  big eye tuna crudo had delicious flavors but was 4 tiny bites.  chocolate pot de creme was ok.  we shared a salad and something else, neither of which I can remember so they clearly didn't leave an impression.   I'm not sure what exactly it was that made the experience less than I was hoping but I was unimpressed. Total bummer but live and learn!",

The mushrooms were cooked to perfection, and the fresh melted Guyere cheese gave it a nice light and smoky flavor.   Service was good, we were seated immedietly, despite the fact we arrived at the height of Brunch/Lunch hour. \u00a0The price range was what I considered to be a median price range, especially for a semi-upscale place like this. \u00a0Affordable, and word to the wise, portions are suitable for sharing!",

It is a little more well known, popular, and trendy than what we usually choose...but they only had a 25 minute wait list and we got a seat at the bar within about five minutes. The bartender was really helpful and personable once we got his attention. In fact, we ended up just staying at the bar even after our table was ready.  First off, the prices really threw me...appetizers, soups, and salads ranged from about 5 to 15+...with main dishes in the high 20s...and drinks in the 10-15 range...not what we had planned for the evening.  We started out with drinks...my daughter got a strawberry/gin/absinthe cocktail, which she loved. I got a ginger drink that actually had zero taste of ginger at all...it pretty much tasted like a weak mojito. \u00a0The drinks were expensive and a little on the small side...lots and lots of ice in mine and a tiny glass for hers. \u00a0  We passed on the expensive main dishes and opted for several side dishes. We got the pretzel bites with mornay sauce, a cup of the French onion soup, and the baby field greens with strawberry and rhubarb and candied walnuts. \u00a0  The pretzels were good and the mornay sauce was delicious, but you only got four small pretzel bites. \u00a0  The salad was delicious but, again, small. Although $13, you could not have had it for a meal...it just wasnt big enough. The candied walnuts were actually candied pistachios. The salad was fresh and tasty, but disappointing for the price.  What bumped this up to four stars from my original three was the French onion soup...hands-down, the best French onion soup I have eaten in decades. \u00a0I dont know what they do to it, but it is onion soup nirvana! We had only ordered the cup...and we did everthing but lick the bowl clean...trying to scrape out every bit. \u00a0However, if you like tons of actual strings of onions in your soup, you will be disappointed...I dont know if they strain it or, more likely, puree it, but it is smooth...no chunks or strings of onions.  A pleasant evening...but our three appetizers and two drinks, with tip, ran us $70...a definite hit to my vacation budget!",

I've always wanted to try this place. I am a French cuisine virgin, and I thought this place would be the perfect place to start.  Anyway, the place looked fancy and elegant, as expected. \u00a0I initially wanted to be in the bar area, where the atmosphere was more lively. But since there were 8 of us, and they don't do reservations for the bar area, I just opted for the quiet, more intimate dining area.  First order of things: Cocktails. I ordered the \"Wanderlust\", and ended up not really liking it. I forgot that Absinthe has that licorice, medicine-y taste that I'm not fond of. Wanderlust has Absinthe. I kinda thought it started growing on me after a few sips. But maybe it was because the drink was pretty strong and I was starting to get buzzed, or because I was thinking that for $12, I better freaking enjoy it. One of my friends got a Mojito- like drink which was pretty yummy, and another friend got the \"Perfect Pear\", which I wish I ordered instead.  We got the pretzels to start. NOM!! Soft, fluffy, flavorful, cheesy and garlicky little tidbits of NOM-ness. Plus, you dip it in this velvety, cheesy, buttery sauce that I wanted to take shots of.  Coq Au Vin.  I've decided that I will order this, pretty much 4 days before our dinner reservation. Of course, I made sure I figured out the proper pronunciation so I can order it confidently. Yes, I was that excited. I did not feel a bit remorseful for the $27 I paid for it. Chicken was fall off the bone tender. The sauce was rich with flavor. It comes with chunks of potatoes and carrots, for it is a stew. The dish also comes with some kind of cheesy garlic toasted bread to dip in the sauce. All in all, I've never had stew that good in my life!  Everyone else raved about their dishes. There was Tuna Tartare, Mac n cheese, meatballs and the Absinthe burger. I heard the meatballs were melt-in-your-mouth good and the Mac n cheese was the best she's ever had. I may have heard my friend groan after her first bite.  We really liked our server. It's a shame I forgot his name, but he was an older gentleman who has a hunched back posture. He was very polite, sincere, sweet and funny. If I was filthy rich, I'd hire him as my butler.  I will definitely make another trip to Absinthe with my bf for a fancy date night!  And uhhhh, guess what? We ended up at a freaking club at the end of the night after all! Damnit!",

This was during DAT and I thought we'd be able to take part with the lunch menu. \u00a0Little did I know that the lunch menu offering was only available M-F and when we got there, we were presented with brunch menus.

Now, I didn't have the oppty to have the scallops, which Jamie seems to be quite famous for, but I would venture to guess that it would be pretty damn good, based upon the duck confit hash and griddle cakes. \u00a0  And last but not least, the lovely bartender who makes a mean bloody mary!",

While at the Ballet I got out my trusty iPhone equipped with the Yelp app and went to work. \u00a0Once I saw the name \"Absinthe\"... I was in. \u00a0It made me think of days spent with my old roommate who ordered wormwood and attempted to make absinthe in our basement.   Absinthe Barasserie had a nice vibe.

We started off with the coffee cake, which came to us in a paper muffin wrapper, served with a side of berry jelly (cranberry, we both thought, but we weren't entirely sure). \u00a0The coffee cake wasn't quite to our liking, as it was a bit dry and dense, not quite as moist as we'd both imagined it would be, and instead of having an even layer of streusel topping, there were just some drops of streusel topping baked into the top of the muffin. \u00a0Next time, I'll pass on it.  We shared the griddled corn cakes with chard, poached eggs &amp; tasso ham hollandaise &amp; the wild mushroom omelette with carmelized onions, truffled pecorino &amp; fresh herbs. \u00a0Though we liked both, we agreed the wild mushroom omelette edged out just a bit.  I was expecting more of a masa, corn studded corn cake, but the base of my brunch selection was more corn bread-like, but with a heftier and sweeter consistency. \u00a0The chard was nicely seasoned and wilted, and the tasso ham hollandaise was slightly spicy. \u00a0The twist they put on the standard eggs benedict was really tasty, and surprisingly light!  We both really liked the wild mushroom omelette. \u00a0Nestled within the layer of soft, fluffy, buttery egg was a deliciously plump medley of wild mushrooms, with slightly sweet carmelized onions, fresh herbs and truffled pecorino. \u00a0Truffled anything is way tasty, but this combination was wonderful! \u00a0I secretly wished I had gone with my gut and ordered this dish instead, but had been swayed to order the corn cakes so we could sample both. \u00a0At least I now know what to get the next time I go =)  Great service, nicely appointed dining space in a cute neighborhood, and a delicious brunch! \u00a0The ambience was ruined a bit because of a large, raucous dining party seated to our left, but we just ignored the rabble-rousers!",

I started with the French Onion Soup Gratinee. If you like French onion soup, you must try it at Absinthe. The melted gruyere cheese on the top was a thick, gooey barrier to the goodness lying within. After breaking through the gruyere cheese, you reach sweet caramelized onions in a rich, savory broth. What was even more surprising about the soup was the large toasted crouton that remained crisp till the very last spoon of soup!   My boyfriend had the Absinthe Hamburger (Marin Sun Farms ground beef, a\u00efoli, red onion, lettuce, house-made pickles, french fries) while I tried the Masami Farms Pork \"Prime Dip\" (horseradish aioli, provolone, buttermilk-fried onions, pork jus, french fries). We both agreed that although the burger was good, it wasn't particularly memorable or outstanding. The burger was served with a very generous portion of tasty frites.   The Prime Dip really stole the show. Thin, tender slices of pork loin were complimented by the sharp bite of horseradish aioli and the crunch of buttermilk-fried onions. Dipped in savory, rich pork jus, this made for a really delicious and memorable sandwich for which I would return.",

The cheese plate was good and the fried chickpeas were phenomenal. \u00a0  Everything about the experience was practically perfect -- except our server. He was a grouchier, blonder Lou Reed. I'm not sure what the issue was but he gave curt answers to our questions and yanked out a menu that was under a plate and silverware which caused it all to clatter and slide across the table as he ran off. He was the most pleasant as he was turning our table over to another server.  We saw another couple who had also just wed at City Hall so my guess is Absinthe might be one of the go to places right after couples tie the knot. It's a great place to celebrate and feels very SF.",

Not much flame and flavor was pretty underwhelming.

The Antipasti had 6 to 7 different types of meats. We all agreed the Antipasti was our favorite between the two.  Between three people we shared two entrees: The Roasted Chicken, which was not spectacular, I think next we'll go for the Pork Confit. But the Grilled Scallops are a MUST! Perfectly cooked with the most tastiest baby leeks ever! and the secret clincher was the Artichoke puree! we LOVED the Artichoke puree. We also had the Chicory Salad: the bleu cheese was very strong in this dish, but none the less very satisfying.  The restaurant Wine Connoisseur came to our table to help us pair a bottle of wine to our dinner. Boy was he spot on! We had a bottle of the Sauvignon Blanc by Toraine. The wine was so aromatic and it rolled off the palate so well. Top notch.  We didn't have time for dessert, unfortunately. We went to the Adele and James Morrison Concert.  - - - - - - - -   We came back for drinks three hours later! The bar was open late! I love their drink menu, Ginger Rogers and Daedalus! The General Mgr was hanging out too, super nice guy! We were hungry so we ordered the Absinthe burger made with Escancia meat. Awesome burger. Fries had great dipping sauces as well.

Absinthe Lemonade - Fresh squeezed lemon juice, ginger syrup, cranberry juice, and ginger ale. \u00a0Lots of ice. \u00a0Very gingery and tart. \u00a0The cranberry is very minimal and provides just a hint of taste and color.  French onion soup - People are right about this. \u00a0The broth has such a deep beef and onion flavor. \u00a0The bread was pretty soaked so there was only a slight crispiness to the edges. \u00a0The gruyere was plentiful and baked to a perfect brown.  Croque Monsieur - I really like how every restaurant makes this differently. \u00a0They still follow the standard bread, ham, and gruyere but to be able to have different interpretations of such a simple thing is so wonderful! \u00a0The thing that stood out most about this one was the bread and how it was toasted. \u00a0They use Acme Bread's levain bread which is great because it's more porous which allows the melted cheese to seep in.  Duck confit hash - Although this wasn't bursting with flavor, the eggs were perfectly poached (runny yolk, slightly crusting, and cooked whites). \u00a0Unfortunately this was the least favorite dish.  Banana-blueberry souffle pancakes - Very fluffy. \u00a0For some reason I kept tasting a hint of lemon. \u00a0The whipped cream really made the dish because it's not too airy.

WOOT! =)  We started out the night with some drinks and the spicy chickpeas. I got the French 75 - a sort of modified gin and tonic. It had gin, lime, a lemon twist, some drunken maraschino cherries and topped off with champagne. Fancy! I loved it. The spicy chickpeas came out in a little ramekin and smelled delightful. They had a slightly spicy note with a hint of curry. I loved how they were crisp on the outside, yet tender inside. MmmMmmm! In between, we were served a bit of bread - I thought it was sorta weird that it came out cold, but my girlfriend liked it.  For our first plates, my girlfriend got the French Onion Soup and I went for the duck confit. The soup was delicious - she said it was about a thousand times better than what we were served at Bijou in Hayward. I thought the duck was absolutely amazing! The first time I had duck confit was in Paris at this little cafe that didn't have an English menu. I pointed at the \"Confit de Canard\", not remembering enough French from high school to even begin fathoming what it would be - and was treated to an excellent preserved leg of duck. This one brought me right back to that little cafe, but it was so much better! The salad that was served with the duck was equally amazing - sweet and bitter perfectly balanced. The only part of the dish I was confused about were the fingerling potatoes. Their presence didn't really add much to the dish and the texture kinda made the rest of the plate a little awkward.  I've had an obsession for Jamie's scallops since Top Chef, too. Unfortunately, like the judges, I wasn't so impressed with hers. But then again, I think it might be some sort of scallop superiority complex - nothing I've had really meets up to it. This one wasn't bad - I just think I'm not much of a medium-rare scallop sorta guy. That being said, the scallops were served with some thick cut bacon (sweet, smoky flavor), mushrooms (nice and earthy), some greens and a mustard-type sauce. And with this dish, I'm officially off my scallop kick - I really want to try to Braised Beef Cheeks if they're on the menu next time =P My girlfriend's stuffed chicken was excellent, by the way. Tender and juicy with really good flavors.  We ordered two desserts - the pot de creme and the cashew-chocolate bar. Awesomely, when I made my reservation through OpenTable, I made a note that it was our anniversary. The pastry/dessert chefs were nice enough to pipe \"Happy Anniversary\" on both our dessert plates - yay! The pot de creme was delicious - rich, but not heavy or overly sweet. The cashew-chocolate bar was pretty good, but I didn't detect much cashew in it. The persimmon ice cream was a nice touch considering I don't like persimmon. =P  Service was good - there was no rush even near end of dinner service. I LOVED the ambiance - good lighting (read not too dark) and an excellent selection of jazz.  Overall I have to say that this was a pleasurable dining experience from start to finish. I'd definitely come back to try out a new menu and would recommend this place to anyone. If you have a date, the private dining room is a definitely plus since the rest of the restaurant seemed a bit noisy. Woot! =)",

    "review_text": "Absinthe was rated in the top 100 restaurants in the Bay Area for 2012 so I figured I'd check it out when I went through Hayes Valley. It's a very elegant restaurant for sure, with a nice dining area and a decked out bar with drinks for any hour of the day. But it's definitely aimed for people with more refined taste buds in their mouths and more dollars in their wallets than me. I went for brunch and sat at the bar with a friend since the dining area had a long wait. The man next to me was ordering Oysters, Bloody Marys, and a whole host of other dishes and drinks that I probably wouldn't normally see, and definitely afford, for a brunch. I stuck with a simple Stuffed French Toast while my friend got Dungeness Crab Omelet, with the latter definitely being more delicious than the former. If the prices for everything weren't so high, I might have gotten a mimosa as well.   All in all, the food was pretty good but the price and elegance of the place makes it a restaurant that I can't see myself frequenting too much or introducing to other friends my age (early 20's). But wait half a decade and this could become my favorite place in Hayes Valley.",

The cocktails were good, although a tad pricey. \u00a0I definitely recommend the Ginger Rogers. Excellent drink! \u00a0  Unfortunately the bartender was extremely rude to us. I asked him if he had a favorite cocktail. His response \"Bacon.\" Confused, thinking he misheard me, I said \"No, do you have a cocktail that you'd recommend?\" He then proceeded to go into a long rant about how he can't recommend drinks without knowing a person and if someone asked him what to drink he'd tell them to have a shot. He also somehow managed to mention his ex wife in his long rant. He was either drunk, just a jerk, or both.   Honestly, I'm not too needy as far as customer service goes. However there is no reason to go off on a customer for asking a perfectly reasonable, friendly question. We even tipped well! That whole experience really soured the mood for us. I don't know if I'd go back there. If you go, do yourself a favor and don't talk to the bartender.",

Woo me please, with all the hype, buzz, and top chef mania. No question that the food is going to be good, but let's see how good. The menu is not terribly vegetarian friendly but you will have options. In addition to the main menu, there is a bar menu where you can order the likes of oysters, sweet potato fries, and burgers.   I found the salad menu very pleasing and went with a chicory salad with cinnamon pecans, Gorgonzola and spiced pears. Sharing a plate of the roasted beets with arugula and goat cheese was also very good. Entrees range from stuffed chicken with pancetta &amp; herbs to farro risotto with caramelized onions &amp; mushrooms.   Nice cocktail list. \u00a0Be brave and try a little absinthe. If you don't know what you feel like the $8.5 glass of Prosecco is a great choice and goes with most of the menu. Another plus for Absinthe is their cheese menu (slightly over priced, but amazing selection). Order single, double, triple or grab a taste of all cheeses ($95).  Rounding up dinner with a complimentary sweet touch of ice cream and chocolate for me friend's Birthday celebration. Thanks! Good food. A little pricey (but a nice treat). Spotty service (changing or servers, and a bit slow). \u00a0  ** How to drink your absinthe**: when drinking your absinthe: use the ice to chill the absinthe if you would like. Pour the ice water over the sugar cube and spoon to dilute and add sweetness. Stir and sip. (still pretty potent).",

I recommend reservations for this place gets packed. Because I was a first timer my friends and I ended up just sitting outside on one of these nice summer evenings we've been having recently to avoid the 45 minute wait time. The outside was pleasant and completely dog friendly and despite being on the outskirts of the restaurant we were very well taken care of by our waiter and the other staff. I thought it was a great environment to enjoy some catch up time with friends.   Right away we ordered cocktails off their menu, most were ~$9. I thought the Ginger Rogers was great and the pleasant pear was refreshing. My friend ordered one of the Absinthes and I was pleasantly surprised at how Not harsh it was to drink. Licoricy and minty at the same time with a kick at the end of your sip.   We decided to just enjoy the cocktails over an assortment of snacks to share as oppose to entrees. The plating of the food was enjoyable in itself, cute sized portions presented artistically on their dishes. We enjoyed a wonderful cheese platter which had 3 types of cheese paired with fruit, jam, or some other garnish to enhance its flavor. The fries were some of the best, perfect crispy and came with 3 dipping sauces to make a frie fiesta. The chickpeas were surprisingly tasty, a spin of wasabi peas sort of. Tis the season for tomatoes so we had an assortment of heirloom tomatoes tossed beautifully and tasting like summer. Yum! Aside from the appetizers, we munched on their bread and butter which was just as tasty in itself.  This little sneak peak of Absinthe makes me craving for more, I can't wait to drag someone here for dinner with me!",

The only thing I do liked is the bartenders with the accent that understood my accent and had the ability to read my mind, providing a hangover worthy cocktail as well as making me a new one when I spilled it the first time.  The place otherwise is in need of a renovation. It looks desperately sad and tired. Sad cheap tiles too but the most urgent issue is the need for sound control especially in the bar area which gets extremely and annoyingly loud.  Compared to another old establishment, take Zuni, the fairly high level of noise is more charming and less annoying maybe due to the people or the cool, less desperate vibe.   The fries and food in general is also lightyears better at Zuni.",

The drinks are simply superb. \u00a0To begin, the bartenders are just a dream to work with--knowledgable, solicitous, and immaculately mannered. \u00a0I never fail to tip them generously. \u00a0And the choices could rule the world--you have everything from the perkiest Champagne cocktails, velvety Ports and Madeira, age-old brandies, and an encyclopedic wine list.  The list of cheeses will make your mind reel and your palate as greedy as Enron. \u00a0They have everything from creamy chevre to intense blue to Swiss rarities. \u00a0As a cheese lover, I could probably try the entire selection in lieu of a real supper (which they do offer). \u00a0Wait, in France, I do believe a simple meal can comprise of cheese and fruit... \u00a0As I have always thought, nothing beats French avant-garde ideas (Enlightenment, French Revolution) and America should not snub their nose at them.  The desserts are marvelous. \u00a0Some, like the Scharffen Berger chocolate pot de creme, are tailor-made for my perennial sweet tooth. \u00a0The lavender creme brulee is intriguing with its waft of linen-clean lavender married to silky cream and sweetness. \u00a0Or try the chocolate-banana tart which comes with warm caramel sauce.  The service is impeccable. \u00a0I have come here dressed to the nines and more casual and, like most San Francisco establishments, they treat me with class and courteousness either way. \u00a0A fantastic place for a date.  Alas, the reason I can only give Absinthe 4 stars is because their main course entrees are just okay and do not match the rest of the menu in temptation powers. \u00a0It is a curious, but unfortunate thing.",

If you have a secret guilty love for refined carbs and a maybe slightly less guilty love for cheese, especially cheese sauce, then you might just love these too.  For the main dish, I had chicken with some kind of filled pasta and tomato sauce. I was drawn to this dish mainly for the pasta (secret guilty love for refined carbs, remember?), but it was actually the chicken that was the best part. I can't even put into words how great it was.

SERVICE: Fantastic. \u00a0We got reservations through OpenTable, and AC indicated that it was for our anniversary. \u00a0The maitre d' wished us a happy anniversary and we were quickly seated at a corner booth just off the bar. \u00a0Both the maitre d' and our waiter confirmed that we were going to an 8pm show, and our waiter provided us with complimentary glasses of champagne for our special occasion. \u00a0The service ran smoothly, and we were able to enjoy our 2+ hour meal without the need to feel rushed to make our show.  FOOD: Everything we had was wonderful. -- Gazpacho: A simple preparation executed perfectly. \u00a0The soup really brought out the flavor of the tomatoes, and I found it much better than the more complex versions that have cucumber, celery, peppers, etc. \u00a0The fried squash blossom was done in a tempura style and was a nice addition. -- French onion soup: Just right for a cool evening. -- Steak frites: AC enjoyed hers very much. \u00a0Cooked perfectly with a hint of rosemary (?) on the crust. -- Goat cheese and leek pierogies: I was a little wary of ordering pierogies, which I think of as a simple Polish/Pittsburgh type of dish, but these were fantastic. \u00a0Nice and crusted on the outside, warm and fluffy inside, and on an excellent bed of mushrooms, spinach, and butter. -- Cheese plate: I would highly recommend the Stilton and the Perail de Brebis. -- Chocolat pot de creme: Rich, velvety chocolate. \u00a0What else can you ask for? \u00a0Ours came with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on the plate. \u00a0A great way to end a meal.  DRINKS:  -- Domaine Allimant Laugner, Brut Rose of Pinot Noir: A nice, refreshing way to start off a meal. -- Sazerac: The glass is rinsed in Pernod Absinthe, something I've never tried before. \u00a0The drink had a little bit of a licorice flavor. \u00a0It was not overwhelming like ouzo, but just enough to make you want another sip. -- Citron lemonade: AC enjoyed this. \u00a0One of those drinks where you barely notice the alcohol.  ATMOSPHERE: Sort of a modern, French-American brasserie scene. \u00a0The crowd was everything from Young Republican (guy in khakis, a blue shirt, and a yellow and blue striped tie) to Pre-Theater Dressy (lots of suits and even a tuxedo) to Early Evening Bar Hopper (guy in a slim but not overly tight black v-neck). \u00a0Being fairly close to the bar it was a bit noisy, but not distracting.",

The deviled eggs were delicious with the smoked salmon, roe, and capers! \u00a0I usually don't order deviled eggs, but my friend wanted to try it. \u00a0It was very flavorful, rich, and creamy. \u00a0  My main dish was the smoked trout BLT which came on a buttered, toasted slice of brioche. \u00a0Two strips of perfectly cooked, crispy bacon with a cornmeal battered green slice of tomato. \u00a0It was also served with a light side salad. I tried a bite of my friend's kurobuta enchilada. \u00a0It was good and the sauce a bit of a kick. \u00a0At the end of the meal, I felt quite satisfied. \u00a0  Come have brunch at Absinthe for a low key, leisurely meal. \u00a0Afterward, take a walk around the neighborhood. \u00a0It's a nice area.",

We ordered the following:  HEIRLOOM-TOMATO &amp; MELON SALAD hearts of palm, Persian fetta, wild arugula, aged balsamic - Delish... interesting combination of flavors, but it somehow worked.   NIMAN RANCH SKIRT STEAK black garlic potatoes, braised artichokes, green peppercorn jus - Friend got this and I got a bite. It was very flavorful and tender as can be.   ALASKAN HALIBUT sweet shrimp &amp; mussels, saffron-chorizo broth, crostini, rouille - Didn't get to try this, but I have tried food with the chorizo broth before and it is fab fab fab!  CLISSON peach jam goat's milk, sticky, creamy, fruity Union Laiti\u00e8re de la Venise Verte, Bordeaux, France - Creamy yummy delishciousness!  BUTTERMILK SPICE CAKE Lillet sherbet, Capricious goat cheese, pickled blueberries - Pass on this one... it just doesn't work. The spices are good... the sherbet is great and perhaps if there was more of it to melt onto the cake... it might help... it was just too dry.   PETIT ENTREMET 6. malt-milk chocolate &amp; Guinness, smoked vanilla &amp; lemon, carrot cake &amp; fromage blanc - Tiny yummy morsels...   Papaya Sorbet - This was the one I thought I would not like at all and turned out to be the best one of all. It is not super papaya tasting at all. I would go back just for this!  Overall the food was great... service was good. I had a cocktail, but can't remember what it was called... I just know that it was DELISH!   This is a great place to go on a fun date (kinda loud... not for first dates... unless you really aren't into him. LOL), or to hang out with friends.",

    "review_text": "Nice things first: the food was pretty tasty. \u00a0The rest: well, we were seated quickly for our not-overly-crowded Tuesday night reservation. \u00a0When our server returned for drink orders we were informed that the bar was unable to make one of their three signature (\"chalkboard\") cocktails. First sign of trouble. \u00a0I ordered one of the remaining two, but the server quickly returned to advise I couldn't have that one either. \u00a0(How can the Owner allow the Manager to allow the bar to to not stock the ingredients for the signature items customers encounter first during their visit?!) After that I didn't order a drink right away. \u00a0In time we ordered our dinners. After waiting ten minutes for my smallish water to be refilled, we received our tasty appetizer. \u00a0After waiting ten or fifteen minutes, at least twice more, for my water glass to be refilled, with no server visits to see how we were doing during the 40 minute wait for our food, I finally went to the bar to order a drink. \u00a0The bartender seemed nice, and I thought maybe I should have sat in the bar. \u00a0The drink, a rye manhattan with a twist, was fine, and I brought it back to the table. \u00a0I don't think my server ever noticed. \u00a0Someone did offer to bring more bread, which never came. \u00a0When the main courses finally arrived, one of my companions who had ordered Coq au Vin received a Croque Madame, which wasn't even on the menu (though it looked and smelled very good). \u00a0To the staff's credit, a Coq au Vin appeared in a mere minute or two. \u00a0I guess what I'm saying is that while the Chef is putting out pretty good food (though short of extraordinary), the manager does not seem to demand the bar stock what they put on the menu, does not demand the bus keep water glasses full, and permits an inattentive and inaccurate staff. \u00a0In a city like San Francisco, it generally means you probably won't bother visiting again.",

Finally yesterday I bit the bullet and tried them for the first time.   You get 5 small chunks of pretzel bread brushed in garlic butter and sprinkled with chunky salt along with a dip of melted cheese. Seriously good.

You lose a bit of the ambiance sitting in the bar but the menu is the same as the dining room. We started out with Absinthe to drink which I guess is part of the experience. It was nothing special except a little buzz before dinner. The service is slow, but I guess that's part of the experience. The food was fantastic. I had lamb loin and my date had beef cheeks, which were fantastic. The portions are not huge but with the entree and the bread it'll fill you up. We tried the Olive Oil ice cream for dessert with was bizarre and tasted oily. I wouldn't order it again but would say it's worth a try just for the novelty. This is definitely a splurge place, but great food, great wine/drink. Overall it's a great place to impress a lady-friend or celebrate.",

Later, we both had the Uptown Manhattan. Very good with 4 Roses bourbon, Carpano and Orange peel with those delicious little cherries! ($12). For food, started with a country pate. Good but a smallish portion for $15. It had pickled veggies on the side and some toast. We split the Absinthe burger ($15). Not a huge patty but cooked perfectly and tender and juicy. We added cheddar cheese for $1.50 more. Pricey no doubt but you are in SF, right? \u00a0   Wines by the glass range from $9 to $18 and a few \"library\" picks at the $30 level. They focus on French and Euro wines here with just a couple CA. products on the list. Service was top notch here. We will definitely be back!",

Drink are easily said a good reason to delay.   Seated, with immediate acknowledgement from our waitress, we had additional drinks come. We ordered oysters (YES! The anti-seafood/shellfood protestor did slurp one!), french onion soup that was hands down the best I've had, garlic pretzels (close to trumping The Monk's Kettle...gasp!), and their short ribs, braised in pinot noir.

Entree b) Absinthe Burger with sauteed mushroom and a fried egg (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/353bun0151fMbR3ut2d-nw?select=zuilbmyuCJdL8gL7CmQoRw#zuilbmyuCJdL8gL7CmQoRw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/353b\u2026</a>) - Ordered medium rare, the beefy taste was strong and loved the runny fried egg oozing on the soft bread. \u00a0The bread/meat ratio leaned towards the bread side a bit.  c) Duck Confit Ragout - Looking like a benedict-like breakfast meal, the flavors were good and, again, there's nothing bad to say about runny eggs.  Dessert (shared) d) Strawberry Pavlova - Most tempting dessert with fresh strawberries fully in season now. \u00a0The licorice flavor was a bit overwhelming.  Four stars for the food, but two stars for the experience and service. \u00a0Our brunch lasted a marathon 135 minutes, almost as long as a foreign movie, with 20 to 30 minute gaps between dishes and ordering times. \u00a0The diners from the two nearby tables arrived later than us, yet ordered and left waaay before we were done. \u00a0For me, the topper was that there was no birthday candle(s) despite my above mentioned conversation with the reservationist; we sheepishly sang \"Happy Birthday\" to the two guests of honor, again with no acknowledgement from the staff. \u00a0My friends didn't have anything bad to say other than one questioning about the timing of things. \u00a0Wanting to share my previous four-star experience with them, I was sadly disappointed and left with a slightly bitter taste in my mouth.",

Good selection of cheeses, including Humboldt Fog and Mt Tam - $9 per cheese I know I could just buy the same blocks of cheese and eat them at home for less or wait to visit a cheese shop like Mission Cheese, but sometimes instant gratification trumps frugality.   * Sangria - $10 The sangria did not taste good.

For $3 per oysters, I'd like something more plump. Well, maybe it's not the restaurant's fault. After all, it's not the oyster season. :( My fault for ordering oysters in May.   It's a beautiful restaurant where you feel sexy and are treated like royalty (with a tab that only a royal can afford.).

I've heard brunch on weekends is busy so I made a reservation on opentable but it was unnecessary since it was after 1. Parking can be tricky in this hood but I scored a sweet (free!) spot on Hayes a few blocks down.  I loved the selection of mimosa type drinks. I had a Monk's Fizz since I love grenadine. It was tasty and not too sweet. I wanted to order a death in the afternoon but since I drove I decided against it. Most of their brunch options include eggs which I can't eat so I ordered the grilled cheese with mushrooms &amp; bacon. The sandwich was very greasy. Disappointing. The house made potato chips were good but combined with the sandwich it was too much grease/fat for me to handle. I would love to come back for dinner but I'll be extra careful what I order.",

Die-hard fans of \"Top Chef,\" we HAD to eat here to support our season four favorite, Jamie. After several other friends had made it up to Absinthe, with rave reviews, we finally caved and made the trip north.  With reservations at 8:00, we were starving by the time we actually got to the restaurant. We ordered some appetizers and small plates to start off. I was impressed with the spicy fried chickpeas--they were something unexpected and a nice start to the meal. The escargots were pretty good, but not great. (Of course, I'm spoiled by Bistro Moulin here in Monterey and Chef Didier's amazing escargot.) The apricot sage country pate was amazing--by all accounts the best thing we ate all evening. Our entrees were quite good--she had braised beef cheeks, I had the Manchego and chorizo stuffed chicken (a great combination!). While we were tempted, neither of us had the scallops, Jamie's signature on \"Top Chef\"--maybe next time.   Had we ended our dinner here, this would have easily been five-star dining. Unfortunately, we stayed for dessert . . . and I hate to admit that I was a little disappointed. We ordered two desserts--the figs and the soft chocolate--and both were pretty lackluster. The figs were poached in Fernet Branca which seriously overpowered the figs, and the whiskey mousse on the soft chocolate was a bit odd.  Our service was great and with a great dinner menu--and equally enticing lunch menu--we'll probably be back. But next time we'll skip dessert.",

The night started with four memorable drinks- the 21 Hayes (a smooth variation on the Pimm's Cup), a Ginger Rogers (a bitter Mojito with the perfect amount of ginger), the signature Manhattan, and the Galapagos (a Pisco based martini with grapefruit and brandied cherries) - all very much worth their $8 price tags.  We then moved on to oyster shooters (with, hands down, the best, boldest, bloody mary mix I've every tasted) and fried chick peas (imagine spicy, crunchy, mini falafel). \u00a0After that came the second round of appetizers, Garlic Escargot, \u00a0Clam and Scallop chowder, and Bleu Cheese with aged balsamic and walnut toast. \u00a0I want to take a second to recognize this chowder - as someone native to the east coast, I'd like to think I've got a discerning tongue for New England clam. \u00a0This was the best soup I've had in my life. \u00a0Ever. \u00a0Rich, tender clams (still in the shell) paired with crisp bacon, delicate, buttery scallops and firm potatoes all served in an elegant dish with a tiny fork and ample spoon. \u00a0GET THIS SOUP.  The meal just kept getting better - with main courses like Pork Confit over red cabbage, Scallops (yes more scallops) with wild mushroom and bacon, and perfectly cooked lamb with chickpeas and cucumber relish. \u00a0 Desert was on par as well, every selection offering creative blends of flavors sweet and savory - olive oil ice cream with chocolate ganache and pop-rocks was interesting, but the chocolate pot was the winner. \u00a0I can still taste the coca an hour later.  We didn't make it around to the actual Absinthe, though I am promising myself a quick return. \u00a0Bottom line, you won't be disappointed.",

The bread still withheld its crispiness long after being immersed in the broth. The soup is a must for French Onion Soup fans :)  For dinner two of us got the scallops and the other had the steak tartare. The scallops were delicious and well-balanced with everything else on the plate. The Steak Tartare was quite filling, even though it looked small.   Between the three of us the total bill came out to around $100. I was definitely expecting it to be a lot more.   Overall the service was great, and the atmosphere was enjoyable and cozy. It was a little crowded around the bar, but do you expect any less on a Friday night?",

I dodged him a couple of times, but he got me when I wasn't paying attention a third time. It was nice that he was so attentive, but he should've known what I had or at least remembered that I'd said no thank you.  So what do I like more?

    "review_text": "I've wanted to try Absinthe for years-literally years. They've been around since the 80s. I was a bit disappointed when I finally got a chance to check them out the other night.  Ambiance: Mr Q and I were crammed into a small table close to the bar. It was very noisy and waiters were rushing back and forth chaotically. Not romantic.  Prices: Um. Not what I would call reasonable for a \"bistro\" type restaurant. $14 for a small salad ? $14 for a plate of brussel sprouts cut into quarters? I don't mind paying for great food but at those prices it should be spectacular if you are paying entree prices for the appetizers.  Food: \u00a0I had the Quince salad ($14). There was something horribly salty in either the dressing or salt had been applied liberally to the finished product because it was extremely bitter/salty. I asked Mr Q to try it and he couldn't taste the salt so when the waiter came by I didn't mention anything. Mr Q took another bite and said \"WOW..I just got a mouthful of the salt you were talking about\". Sigh.  I also ordered the Sea Scallops ($30). I joked with Mr Q that I'd probably end up with 2 scallops on my plate. WRONG..I got THREE. Woo hoo! They were cooked well but they were supposed to come with braising greens. There were no braising greens present, just mushrooms and pancetta.  Mr Q had the Beef Cheeks ($26) and a side order of Brussel Sprouts ($14) that we shared. If I ever came back here, I would probably order the beef cheeks since it actually seemed to be a substantial amount of food. The brussel sprouts were OK to me but Mr Q expressed disappointment.   We shared a chocolate Pot De Creme for dessert ($9). It was good. I also ordered one cocktail called Velvet Hive that was delicious.   Service: \u00a0I hate it when waiters ask if you are ready and when you're not ready they don't come back for another 20 minutes. We saw amuse-bouches being brought to other tables but did not receive any ourselves. We got our appetizers in a decent amount of time but it took *forever* for our entrees to be served. Then there was a delay clearing our plates, and yet another delay after we ordered dessert. I had finished my drink midway through dinner and the waiter waited until after our plates had been cleared to ask if I wanted another one. At that point it was too late.  Since Jeanty at Jacks is closed, I'm still on the hunt for a cozy French bistro type of restaurant. Absinthe did not fit the bill.",

The cheese plate was nice, and our waitress did a great job picking the right stuff to fit our requests.   For my main, I had the coq au vin - red burgundy wine-stewed chicken. Mixed with bacon, chanterelle mushrooms. Served on perfectly-toasted crostini. The flavor wasn't the richest coq au vin I've ever had, but it was very tasty.  I also tried the local petrale sole, in the meyer lemon sauce with brussels sprouts. This was light and fresh, but not overly-memorable.  Finally, I had a piece of the steak with criminis, creme fraische whipped potatoes and black garlic jus. This was also nice, but not overly-memorable.

So needless to say, however much I watch Top Chef and rooted for Jamie Lauren to win, I wouldn't dare in a million years to come to Absinthe just so I can talk to her in person.   No, I came here because I hear the food is good and my friend wanted to take me out for my birthday at a nice brunch place. And you know what? Most of popular brunch restaurants in SF don't take reservations and I have never felt it justified to wait for an hour for some fluffy French toast, no matter how fluffy they are.   Absinthe was crowded when we arrived! Not sure what symphony/ballet/opera plays on early Saturday afternoons, but almost everyone there was above 60, dressed nicely. The place looked very old-school and I felt classy.   I thought I'd skip the boring usual breakfast stuff and ordered the deviled eggs instead. something different. it had smoked trout or something on top, with a pinch of caviar. For $16, I get 6 halves of eggs. All were too salty, and not quite filling.   My friend had the smoked sturgeon (apparently both of us were in the smoked-fish-for-breakfast spirit) and crostini. Smoked sturgeon came in thin little strips, and didn't have the bright red color of smoked salmon that I am used to. I didn't ask her how she liked her dish, but for about $15, she didn't looked stuffed either.   So we got a side of scone with home made preserves to share. The scone was alright. It was kinda crumby and the cranberry jam was fine, but nothing spectacular.   Overall, it was quite expensive for brunch, about $50 for two. And I didn't feel wowed. Maybe I should have stuck with the boring usual french toast.",

I think that the menu is put together oh-so-perfectly. \u00a0I loved that there was a dish that included braised celery....hmmm, confronting her enemies perhaps? \u00a0 Scallops were the shit, and it was nice to actually get to reach through the TV screen and taste the food I had been droooling on for weeks and weeks prior. \u00a0  Cocktails! \u00a0Wow what a unique list!   Oysters - simple enough, and a great set up. \u00a0We also grabbed a small portion of the sauteed crab - a little rich but wow was that some sweet goodness.   That squash puree soup - I think she may have done that one on the show (or something similar) was a party in my mouth. \u00a0  The booth we got was ever so romantic...perfect ambiance and lighting. Thanks for an amazing date Absinthe!",

    "review_text": "Absinthe pays homage to Ernest Hemingway's novel &amp; the cocktail he invented of the same name, \"Death in the Afternoon.\" I've spent many afternoons completely knocked out after particularly libatious Sunday brunches, but I've been more nice than naughty this month, forgoing (some) sugar &amp; (many) cocktails; My rendezvous with \"The Green Fairy\" will have to wait, but I anxiously look forward to it.   This past Sunday, I had a reservation for a late brunch with the BFF at Absinthe. We were led to a corner table with tons of privacy &amp; a great view of our tres chic surroundings.   Foods: - \"two eggs any style\" for me: a quartet of perfectly buttery eats--soft scrambled eggs, roasted potatoes w/ a dash of onion marmalade, toast &amp; thinly sliced grilled ham. Simple &amp; flavorful. - egg whites over fried pork on tortillas for the BFF (can't remember the exact name.) He was very happy with his meal. - we shared brioche french toast with a spiced mascarpone &amp; apple maple syrup. So fluffy &amp; not too sweet. Highly recommended for the table. Total: $42  It's very cool that Absinthe has not let it's popularity get to it's head (have you seen the crowds? the wait? the nearly 1500 reviews?!) Not a hint of snottiness or impatience (from the host or our waitress) that I've seen/experienced at equally bustling restaurants. Five stars for their service.   Sidenote: the brunch online menu differs a little from the actual menu (i.e. no fried green tomatoes, which I had my heart set on.)",

After spending time searching for the right place that was Michelin starred, she threw a wrench in my plan and chose this place. So... we went.   The food was very tasty, I got the duck and the portion was ok. The tartar is a must and won't give you the runs. The drinks were nice and strong, and the service was great.

We were going to make reservations, but were told that the earliest available time was 10pm. \u00a0So, we took a chance and went down there anyway at around 7:30. \u00a0Hoping to get seated sooner as a walk in. We lucked out. \u00a0We put our name in and waited for about 20 minutes before being seated. \u00a0Nice.  Dress code is casual. \u00a0I saw everything from cocktail dresses and suits to jeans and baseball caps. \u00a0Take a taxi. \u00a0Parking, like everywhere in SF is a challenge. \u00a0I don't live or work in SF, \u00a0but if I did - I'd toss my car off the Golden Gate Bridge and never drive again.  Again, we lucked out and got a nice table that was somewhat private. \u00a0  Absinthe gets a lot of the \"Opera\" crowd, so the best times to go, I assume, would be during a show time. \u00a0This is probably why we were seated so quickly. \u00a0Looks like it gets real busy before and after the shows. \u00a0Anyway, the bar area was packed and lively.  We chose one of the cheese plates for an app. \u00a0It was great. \u00a0The French may be ready to wave the white flag and ridicule people who do not speak their language - but, they do know cheese. \u00a0Sorry to any French people out there, but it is true. \u00a0You know it. \u00a0  My wife ordered the french onion soup, which I tasted. \u00a0The soup was insanely good. \u00a0For dinner, I got the Absinthe hamburger. \u00a0Okay, now before you start yelling, \"You idiot, you ordered a freaking hamburger at a high end place like Absinthe!?\" \u00a0Let me tell you, it was one tasty morsel of a freaking hamburger....and, believe me - I know hamburgers. \u00a0Trust me. \u00a0  Further, I had a dirty Martini that was very good. \u00a0My wife ordered a fancy mixed cocktail that the waitress recommended, that was equally great. \u00a0Also, there are plenty of nearby stores, etc. to walk around after dinner.  We want to go back again. \u00a0Soon. \u00a0Great place. \u00a0Great food. \u00a0Just avoid the \"Opera\" hours.\" \u00a0Enjoy.",

    "review_text": "I took my wife here for dinner last night, following a daytime performance of Wicked - sufficed to say, it was a special occasion - and Absinthe lived up to our expectations.   We decided since it was early (5:30 pm), we'd take our time and really savor each course. We started with a half dozen oysters (2 of each of the west coast variety). They came with an Asian inspired mignonette that was very good - the oysters were of the highest quality as well.   Next, we had the French onion gratin\u00e9e. One of the best onion soups I've had. Ever.   We followed that with the Green garlic flatbread with fava leaves, house-made ricotta, ricotta salata, lemon oil. This was a great combo. I especially loved the house-made ricotta. Overall, savory and delicious.   Moving on to the mains... I had the Slow cooked pork confit with butter beans, bacon, wilted nettles, roasted tomatoes. I can't say enough how great this dish was. The pork was done just right, and what fat was left on the meat was amazingly flavorful, and just melted in your mouth. The butter bean, bacon and nettles that accompanied were also very tasty. i enjoyed this dish so much, that I just finished eating the leftovers for lunch... just as good the second time around.   My wife had the Pancetta-&amp;-herb stuffed Mary's chicken with Brussels sprouts, fingerling potatoes, lacinato kale, roasted shallot sauce. This dish was also great. The stuffing was actually between the breast meat and the crispy skin. Not what we expected, but still really great. it seperated the flavors quite nicely. Roasted shallot sauce and the spouts really added a lovely finish to the dish. I will be having these leftovers for dinner.   The sommelier had suggested a great red wine to accompany both our dishes, and met our price point - Domaine Gallety 2005 Ricolte. \u00a0We noticed it's distributed by Kermit Lynch, so we will definitely see if we can get some from his shop.  We finished the night with the Scharffen Berger chocolate Pot de cr\u00e8me  with cr\u00e8me chantilly . This was delicious - the perfect ending to a perfect meal.  Although Jamie did not win Top Chef, her skills are definitely amazing, as was proven to us last night. \u00a0I will definitely be returning for more!",

Apps! - Oysters (the Japanese name ones): super tasty, but pricey too at $3.50 each. - Those spicy chick pea thingies people on Yelp liked. \u00a0Good but not great, especially when compared to: - Garlic Pretzel rolls or something: these were the WINNER. \u00a0Turns out that soaking hot soft pretzel dough in oil butter garlic and salt makes for a really tasty appetizer. \u00a0Reminiscent of the (in)famous garlic knots at C&amp;O Cucinca in Marina Del Rey in Los Angeles. \u00a0Oh yeah, they also served these with some cream sauce that we kept around and dipped the regular bread in... so yeah, that was pretty bomb. \u00a0DO IT. - French Onion soup: like the other Yelpers said, it's money. \u00a0We got the larger portion, which they split for us. \u00a0But EACH of the \"'halves\" they gave us were large enough (and of course rich enough) to split between two people.  Full frontal dishes: - Pork Osso Bucco: this was so tender the person who ordered this proclaimed \"never has a knife been more superfluous.\" \u00a0 She was right. \u00a0We ate this with spoons. \u00a0Just fatty and rich enough and a generous portion too. - Absinthe burger: the meat was just good, but when served with cheese and egg, it became downright magical. \u00a0(Two of us independently proclaimed the cheese and egg to be most virtuous.)  - Sole something: this was super mega tasty excellent according to the person that ordered it.  Desserts: HFS save some MFing room in your prissy little Francophile stomach, because it's TFing worth it. \u00a0Why did I just attack France? \u00a0Anyway: - Chocolate pot de Creme: as you'd expect a creamy thick chocolate pudding is really tasty. \u00a0But this one gets the slightly-darker-than-usual balance just right for a winning combo. - Black forest cake: this was the SURPRISE WINNER. \u00a0Now, going by the name you'd expect this to look like well, a slice of well, cake. \u00a0It didn't. \u00a0It looked like a supremely perfect choco wafer cookie. \u00a0I don't know exactly what they did, but somehow they combined frosting type stuff, cake type stuff and crust type stuff in such a perfect ratio that any cross section of this thing you ate came out perfect with just a hint of satisfying crunch. \u00a0They also served it with pitted cherries that looked fascinatingly like pitted olives, some toasted almonds, and a pleasant surprise - moderately tart cream that was a perfect balance of the perfect chocolatiness that was the \"cake\"' / stick thingy. \u00a0See photo, it'll make more sense.  Service was excellent, and it was fairly pricey overall, but pretty awesome when you consider we had a full dinner at 11pm.",

I came here with 2 friends and we got 3 cheeses to share, 1 beef tartar, the mushroom pot pie and the absinthe burger to share.  The cheeses were excellent. Great appetizers and you really cant mess up on cheese. The restaurants don't even make the cheeses, so Absinthe really cant take credit for this dish but I'll give them credit for having a good cheese buyer.  The beef tartar was decent. It wasn't the best I've had, but it also wasn't the worst I've had. The beef was cut a bit thicker than I would have liked, but the flavoring was decent.  Mushroom pot pie was a huge disappointment. It looked really good and my friends and I were excited to try it. However, in the end it was just a glorified mediocre cream of mushroom soup inside of a pie. My friends and I weren't fans.  The famous Absinthe burger was another disappointment. I always hear people talking about this burger so of course, I had to try it when I was here. We got the burger and added the smoked guyere cheese to it. The burger was bland and nothing special to rave about.   Excellent service. We had a fantastic waiter with a wonderful personality. \u00a0  All in all, the food was ok, but Absinthe does have excellent service and ambiance.",

Then we moved on to some scallops, which was also good, I liked the green garbanzo beans, balanced the flavors of the plate, and gave it an aesthetic touch.  My dinner plate was the trout, it was deboned and pink inside. Perfectly grilled and crisp on the outside, but the inside flavor wasn't too memorable. \u00a0I think i recall it tasting a bit like salmon.  I was drinking the Cava all throughout. I think it was very pleasant, we sat right outside, and I liked watching all the patrons coming in and out of the place.   I think it wasn't too memorable in the sense that I feel like I've had these plates everywhere else. It's a nice neighborhood joint, but not anything too outrageous or intriguing.

Star deduction 1 - price. \u00a0To be perfectly honest, Absinthe is pricey but not TOO unreasonably so. \u00a0However, when you are 2 graduate students, these prices can at time approach ridiculousness. \u00a0The 2 of us ordered 4 drinks, fries, 2 entr\u00e9es &amp; 1 dessert for a total (after tax + tip) of about $140. \u00a0You be the judge.  Star deduction 2 - service. \u00a0When we got to the restaurant, the head host/manager sat us immediately but he didn't look at us &amp; all he said was \"follow me.\" \u00a0I wouldn't think twice about this if I hadn't seen him treat other patrons totally differently - smiling &amp; chatty! \u00a0What about us makes us different? \u00a0Our waitress treated us well but she definitely paid less attention to our table than to some of her other customers.  I had a great time &amp; a good meal (hope the boyfriend felt the same way) but the experience could have been better. \u00a0We would consider Absinthe again for special...really special...occasions &amp; for their hot dog (it's featured on the 7x7 list).",

Do people do that?) I was told that it would be AT LEAST a 30 minute wait and that we would still have to sit in the cafe. Not like there is anything too abnormal about all of this but it was just the attitude.  We decided to go to Stacks down the street. I was looking forward to throwing down around $20 for breakfast when our friend arrived, very disappointed. She said she had heard so much about Absinthe and would be broken hearted if she didn't go. So we went. And got a table. In the cafe. 45 minutes later.  After all that we were seated and waited about 10-15 for a waiter to come and take our drink orders. BS at a restaurant like this. I didn't even want to drink but the menu was so tempting I ordered a champagne and white peach puree mimosa. Pretty unexciting for $10. Though I do want to come back and try some of their other enticing drinks.  We started with the deviled eggs - they were OK but could have used a lot more smoked salmon and caviar and a lot less egg. They were $16 for 5 halves... come on, don't skimp!  Next my sister and I split the burger with mushrooms and the duck confit hash thing. Both were pretty good to OK. The burger wasn't spectacular. Duck thing was interesting although I never tasted any duck.  My friend got the French toast with spiced apples and this was by far the best thing on the table. Seriously amazing. Although soo sweet it was more dessert than breakfast. Yum.  So all in all.... I expected more. Definitely expected more from the service. When we left the hostesses just looked at me and I had to say Thank You to them! Oh and I love Top Chef and Jamie seems cool so I wish it had been better though, and I really wish she would have come out to great us.   Oh and $45 for breakfast is just wrong.",

Something about the restaurant looks mysterious and chique from the outside but when you get inside it falls of, slumps, and reminds me of a cheesecake factory.   But lets not get lost on the details of ambiance. There are real gems on the menu(s) and we should first start with the cocktails... Ginger Rogers WE LOVE YOU... reminds me of a Gin Gin Mule, probably the same thing from that famous bar in Burma, the Galapagos was terrific and had a wonderful character. Nice selection of Absinthes on the menu of course... The Wonderlust was delightful and made me want to sing I'm a wonderlust king by Gogole Bordello, briefly that is.   Oysters, we stuck to the local fare, Tomales Bay and Point Reyes and they didn't disappoint, neither did the charcuteries plate that was piled high with various cold cuts, pickled goodness and other sundries. All in all I kept thinking to myself, this is good, a 3 star affair, but when the entree arrived we went up a notch as I began to scarf down my own duck leg confit and my girlfriend's braised beef cheeks. The waitress was right, it's not beef cheeks, its bloody beef butter! Soft, fork tender, rich and wonderfully topped with vidalia onion strings this was the right hook I was hoping for.  I've heard good things about their breakfasts, I'll have to try that one day, but for now I'm quite satisfied with their dinner.",

Since she raved about this place, I was eager to try it.   We started with some fantastic cocktails, which they have a huge variety of.   We shared escargot, beet salad, and french fries. All were fresh and delicious. The bread was fan-freaking-tastic too.  Of the eight of us more than one of got the scallops, and lamb, one person had the duck, and one had the burger.   Everyone raved about their food.   I am not normally a huge fan of scallops, but after remembering that Jamie Lauren was known for them, I had to order them.  So glad I did!!! They were cooked perfectly, the sunchoke puree and spinach was wonderful. The flavors all worked so well together. It was also the perfect size, I am a big fan of restaurants that actually serve real portions and not mammoth plates of food.  The dish was absolute perfection. I savored every mouthful.  It was so good, I was kind of sad when I finished it.   For dessert we shared: TCHO pot de creme, the cookie plate, and a cheese plate.   The pot de creme was luscious, and being the fan of cookies that I am, I adored the variety of mini cookies. All were fantastic.   Even though this place has a hip vibe, and they were busy, it wasn't too loud to talk, which I think we all appreciated.   It is a little pricey, but they serve local, organic, and sustainable food, (not to mention high quality) and you have to expect to pay a little more for that.   Service was good, waters were kept refilled, plates were cleared efficiently, and drinks were replenished when wanted.   All in all ,a great dining experience. I will definitely return at some point.",

They go to the farmers market weekly to ensure that their mixed greens are the best of the best. My dad eats the mixed greens plain (no dressing) to fully experience the mixed green taste. Anyways, we were blown away by this salad. Granted it's only a simple salad, but everything was so fresh and so delicious. Definitely get this.  Between the 5 of us we tried the portabello grilled cheese, duck ragout, and a few other dishes. All were good, but the duck ragout is the one that stands out to me the most. Delicious chive/potato cake, poached egg, and (lots of) duck. So good.  Anyways, all in all, this was the perfect place for brunch. I will definitely be back!  Be sure to make reservations.

We each ordered the french onion soup (got the cup size and it was enough). It was very delicious and one of the best we had. Very authentic. I had the potato crusted artic char and my bf had the duck confit. The fish was moist &amp; delicious. The salad that came with it was very yummy. I like the vinagrette on the salad. My Bf love his dish a lot. It was very tasty. Looks just like the photos posted on yelp here. For dessert, we ordered the strawberry panna cotta and when it came out, it was written \"happy anniversary\" on the plate. That was nice. The panna cotta was delicious and light. My Bf had coffee and it was good strong coffee. Altogether, the bill come to about $85. We had a $50 gift certificate from a friend and used that. Overall, we had an awesome anniversary dinner. The service was great and so was the food. Will be back again to try other dishes. Or better yet, stick to the same dish since we love it so much :) GO LOOK at my photo I post up for the artic char (4th page). No one else posted a pic of it and looks like I was the only one.

We thought we'd just have a drink or two, but wound up snacking a little.  I ordered the French Onion soup - something I always order at *brasserie* type places. Oh my - it was really, really nice. The broth was complex - meaning, both of us kept taking little sips wondering what we were tasting. Was there a teeny hint of tomato? Vermouth? It had a slight sweetness, but it was meaty also... It was good. My drink was a special called a Halo. Honeyed vodka and candied jasmine. The sugar rim was jasmine-y. I'm a rim licker, whenever I get a drink with a sugared rim, I try to lick all the sugar off as inconspicuously as possible. Jasmine sugar?! Shut the front door!  My friend is a cheese making fool and ordered the imported French raw sheep milk cheese and swooned over it for an hour - she's a slow eater, and the longer she takes the better it is.

When we arrived, the place was still packed (it remained that way throughout the whole time we were there). The atmosphere is charming. With it's art deco floor, it reminds me of a speak easy french bistro (if there is such a thing). We weren't seated until about 2:30 but the bar was a nice place to chat while we waited for our table.   Their brunch selection isn't huge but we all enjoyed what we had. I had the ricotta french toast and mike had the standard american breakfast (eggs, sausage, toast). Our friends had the absinthe burger and the mushroom omelet. The ricotta french toast was fluffy and the ricotta filling was perfect with the fruit compote,whipped cream, and syrup. Yum, it was like dessert for breakfast. Mike's brunch was also pretty good-the sausage is house made and was really tasty.   The dessert, the chocolate tort looked amazing and it was huge! My only complaint was their tea was a bit bland. I should have gone for the coffee!   Great place to have brunch with your friends or even on a date. I can see why this place is a local favorite!",

The deal was sealed when we realized we were right in front of an open parking spot!  We shimmied up to the bar and started contemplating drinks, then were approached if we'd like to get a table in the dining room instead. I have to say everyone was as nice as you'd expect in a 5-star establishment. We were dressed in jeans and jackets, while everyone else in the restaurant at the time was 20 years older than us and wearing formal jackets and ties. Oh well, the staff didn't treat us differently. In fact, our waiter was excellent. He was deferential yet casual, and even made a few jokes as the night progressed.  The drinks are quite tasty (and of course you have several options with absinthe). I had the Peju, which was smooth and tasty. The brut champagne is also one of the best that I've had, and I'm not particularly a fan of sparkling.  And the dinner? The food is very good. I'd say the weakest part was the cheese plate (I can't remember which cheeses we got, but one of the goat cheeses is extremely pungent and difficult to palate). The fried chick peas were quite good, though kind of simple with Indian spices. I had the pappardelle, which was well-rounded and very filling. The lamb and chicken were also well flavored; everyone was happy.",

Instead I had the Pork Confit sandwich and was quite pleased with the portion size. The homemade potato chips that came with the sandwich were slightly salty, but were crispy and delicious.   The pork in the sandwich was tender with good flavors. And the wilted greens accompanied well with the confit. As a stand-alone dish, awesome. As a sandwich, bad idea. Even though the bread was grilled, the grease from the pork and greens turned the sandwich into a soggy mess. Picked up the sandwich, grease ran down my fingers and hands. Took a bite, grease gushed into my mouth and down my chin. After that, ate the sandwich with fork and knife and avoided the soggy bread. Overall, the sandwich was not a very enjoyable experience. And my stomach agreed.  Service was slow. Friends who ordered the DAT meal waited long for their courses. We saw the server with desserts. But just as he approached our table, he turned away. Few minutes later, a busboy came over to clear our dishes. Then we waited. *Tick tock* The server returned with the desserts only to turn away once again. He came back with spoons but without the desserts. Errr. Took off again, and minutes later, finally desserts on the table.  If I do ever come back, I'd like to try their brunch. Hopefully 3rd time's a charm.",

    "review_text": "Went here before the symphony at 7:30p on Friday - waiter was good about asking if we were going to a show and getting us out in time. We had made reservations awhile ago.   I'm pretty sure their menu changes...that being said...  We had 4 different types of raw oysters and they were all very fresh, varied from each other, and clean (no shell pieces, thank goodness...)   Their pumpkin bisque was yum, lemongrass flavor came out as well as a bit of spice. I'd say this was a 4/5. BTW, complementary bread was so good, the carb avoiders I was with ate more than 1 slice and loved on the butter, as well. Marinated Mixed Olives were great! Fennel slices with the olives. Had many different types and they varied in texture and flavor. Yum. I had the coffee crusted liberty duck breast which was very flavorful (little too flavorful for me) and a bit chewier than I liked but still very good. My friends had: osso bucco (had a taste and by far the best of the 3 entrees) and steelhead (healthy choice tasting...)  We had this squash cake for dessert that was very good. The cake didn't taste like squash and had an interesting outer crusting. It came with bourbon ice cream (which one of my friends insists on being really good -- thought it was sweeter than I liked) and some other cool looking things that tasted good. Coffee was good, as well.   Hung our jackets close by to our table. It got busy and someone that worked there took our jackets and began walking away before my friend caught her to let her know those were ours. She must have been confused. You may consider just keeping your jacket with you.",

    "review_text": "We had a perfect late night meal at Absinthe which started with some very smooth martinis at the bar while we waited for our table.   We shared the mac and cheese which was delicious. It had a nice crust but the mac and cheese was perfectly cooked with a creamy cheesy balance.   I had the coq au vin which was definitely not the coq au vin your French grandmother would make. The ingredients of the dish were combined after cooking each individually which allowed each component to be perfectly cooked. \u00a0The chicken was perfectly cooked, the bacon pieces were crunchy. The pieces of veg were still slightly al dente. The sauce had an amazing velvety richness albeit a bit on the salty side.   My partner had steak which was perfectly cooked and very tender.   The sommelier also recommended a perfect bottle of red. \u00a0When the waitress said she was sending the sommelier over to help with our wine selection, my heart sank a bit - am I going to have to pretend I actually know what I'm talking about when it comes to wine!? But she was awesome. She was super friendly and just asked some basic questions: red/white? Full bodied/fruity? How much do you want to pay? She brought over the perfect bottle of red and explained the history behind the vineyard. We loved her! And well done to Absinthe for having a female sommelier!!!  The service was top notch. Very friendly and laid back. \u00a0Our waitress was awesome. It was my friend's birthday and she brought out ice cream with a candle on top.   Super fab restaurant!",

We walked in on a Sunday afternoon (in November) right at lunchtime and figured we'd have to wait - it's not very big and has tiny tables - but were pleasantly surprised when a couple of seats opened at the bar right after we walked in. \u00a0I ordered a Bloody Mary and the Levain French Toast. \u00a0The Bloody Mary was good, though not the best I've ever had. \u00a0Bonus - I could definitely taste the alcohol. \u00a0The french toast was wonderful. \u00a0It is made on an artisan bread and then covered in currants and slivered almonds. \u00a0The honey maple syrup was pretty light given what it is, and was the perfect compliment to the tartness of the currants. \u00a0It comes with butter but I didn't even use it because it was not necessary. \u00a0I didn't think I was hungry but it was so good I finished all three slices.  I switched my drink to my very favorite - a sidecar. \u00a0It's an old fashioned cocktail and sometimes bartenders do not know how to make it, but this guy did not disappoint. \u00a0My companion explored a few of the specialty drinks and overall was pleased with the flavors of the drinks she chose.  The one thing I wish we had ordered - and will definitely order next time - is the Spanish Coffee. \u00a0It's a specialty of the house and we watched the bartender make several of them ... it looked divine.

    "review_text": "I'm conflicted about Absinthe. On the one hand, the bar, on a recent Saturday evening, was vibrant and full and good fun. The drinks were interesting (especially the absinthe-infused concoctions, like the \"Sacred Heart\") and the bartender was attentive and witty. It's a good spot for observing the activities outside on Hayes Street, and it has a really cozy, intimate brasserie feel.  On the other hand, the restaurant proper feels a bit stuffy, the crowd is older, and the room is slightly peculiar in its layout. (I found myself making weird eye-contact with other diners near our table, because of the configuration of the tables.) The food is good, if a little bit pricey. (I had the Steak Frites - good, though not the mouth-watering meal I had been anticipating.) And our server was inconsistent, quick to take our drinks order, but then she disappeared without telling us anything about the food menu - and I had to hail her over later to order our main courses. Surprising, in a place that clearly aspires to be a high-end eatery.  Summary -- I'll be back for drinks and people-watching in the bar. For dinner, there are better choices. (Indeed, there are even better French Bistro choices in San Francisco.)",

    "review_text": "Overrated. Still reeling from a disappointing dinner last Friday. Absinthe has been on my to-eat list as some friends had mentioned that it is always \"consistent\"- a characteristic that's not an easy feat for any restaurant, so I was intrigued. Too bad it was such a letdown.  Was excited to check it out with a girlfriend for dinner after work. She was at the bar for 1/2 an hour before I showed up. Wanting to pick up her tab as she had been waiting for so long, I was surprised that it took what seemed like forever for the bartender to even walk over and acknowledge me (what if I had wanted a drink?) and even more surprised when she told me she had waited at least 15 just for him to lay out a cocktail napkin and greet her. Here's a beautiful single girl sitting at the bar, ignored when it wasn't even that busy! He's an older bartender who may just be numb to everything. Didn't seem friendly, no smiles, a barely-heard 'thank you' as he dropped off the check. I gritted my teeth as we headed to our table. What a start.  Highlight of the evening was the warm hostess...and the runners/bussers. Once we got to our table, service was spotty at best. Our first server was just...blah. Took forever to take our order, busy handling the adjacent table of men who were seated after us, as I jokingly asked if it was because she liked them more than us. A few cordial exchanges, order-taking...then just like that, poof- another server took over out of nowhere for the 2nd half of our night who was just as unmemorable. I don't know if the staff there is just complacent given it's always steady and busy there.  Just goes to show again how much service contributes to an experience. I eat out all the time and let's just say it's rare for me to cringe this much thinking about how much we spent on a so-so meal (though the garlic pretzels were the highlight) and so-so service. Also I lost street cred with a friend who had trusted me up to that point to always pick great spots..up to this point.",

Before I get carried away in my obsession with this place, I should comment on the star ratings for food, service, and ambiance. (jackin' the style of the last reviewers comment)  Four Stars -Food :Scallops- were tender and scrumptious, but the pairing of the greens made the plate a little mushy &amp; didn't have much depth. The other dishes that I have eaten here: Ricotta Stuffed French Toast (5 stars)..super fluffy and thinking about it makes me turn into Homer Simpson (mouthwatering style). If you decide to get the oysters...you must get the Kuma Mottos! They are creamiest oystas that I have ever had...super DELISH!   Service- Bar staff, Waitstaff, Hostesses, and kitchen staff are extremely efficient. E.g. -Quick, Knowledgeable, and they bring me simple syrup for my sweet tooth for cocktails (needed for the Pear Cocktail)  Ambiance- 3 Stars...I feel bad giving 3 stars, I just wish it wasn't so damn noisy and that's someone complaining with a deaf ear! haha Other than that, the decor is French bistro feel and cozy!

The absinthe menu was impressive (for obvious reasons).  I had the summer squash and corn flatbread, which was VERY good and light. It was well cooked and not overdone and I devoured it within 2 seconds because it was so good. I also got the frise salad and enjoyed it too. The house cured bacon was amazing and it was well seasoned without being overwhelming.  The restaurant has a lot of regular customers, which I think says a lot about it. Overall, a good experience!",

Even paying corkage fees instead of buying bottles of wine we didn't escape for less than $80 a piece on the bill...all said and done. \u00a0  But the food is amazing. This weekend I had the Coq Au Vin and my date had the duck. Amazing, especially the duck which involved BIG hunks of duck breast. I didn't think there were ducks big enough for what was on the plate. So...yeah I want more. And it was so savory, like the beef of poultry.   Our server--Kimberly--was awesome! And I told her I'd call her out by name. She was helpful, knowledgeable, conversational, and cool. I like it when servers are cool.  Some of the tables here are really spacious and put in a lovely and quite back space while others are jammed up by the front door--so that may make eating here a bit of a crap shoot. If the chefs found a way (other than ordering a burger) to bring the price point down to a real $$$ instead of $$$$ I could call it a go-to spot for once or twice monthly nice meals, but as it stands it's a little pricier than some of my existing favorites.   This is all personal preference though...you should absolutely go to Absinthe for yourself.  P.S. Get dessert. I'll be in for drinks and dessert again soon, even if I space dinners farther apart. The yogurt panna cotta &amp; orange sherbet parfait with pistachio crust is hella good.",

Maybe because I brought my kid in and needed a high chair- but the waiter had zero qualms letting me feel like my baby and my business was not appreciated. \u00a0It was 3pm in the afternoon on a Saturday and there was plenty of tables. I didnt think it would be an inconvenience to have my kid there on a casual Saturday afternoon.. but I was wrong. Our food order was forgotten and took a long time.. once it came out the steak frites entree was cold and my hamburger was rare and the meat crumbled apart when I cut the burger in half- turning it into just a bunch of raw meat on my plate.  However, the french fries were good and the bussers were helpful and friendly. Disappointed and a little miffed, because I truly used to love my experiences here. I really used to love coming here and sitting in the lounge, but the hostess placed my friend and I in the lounge this time and I felt unwanted. I expect better service for an hour half casual Saturday with a bill of $120. Perhaps the hostess should have put us in the main dining room, if kids are an issue? Not sure, but Im pretty sure that I am the customer and that shouldn't be a problem. Just dont bring your kids and maybe your service will be better. Definitely NOT KID Friendly.",

I had one of the Absinthe drinks, just because I've heard about Absinthe for decades and have never tried real Absinthe before. \u00a0I wasn't that impressed. \u00a0I'm sure its good...the presentation seems to be accurate, with the slotted \"spoon\" and the pitcher of water to pour over the sugar cube, but licorice drinks have never really been big to me. \u00a0Bars in France have little appeal to me as well, as all of them seem to be wanting to serve me some licorice-tasting liquor which they claim is the best around :)  For starters we had the fries, which were very good...done and seasoned to perfection, and the warm marinated olives...okay, but nothing to write home about. \u00a0  I had the frisee salad, with the sunny-side up duck egg and bacon cubes similar to something Jamie did on Top Chef. \u00a0I have to say that the dish was well intentioned, but the presentation was poor...it was a HUGE mound of frisee, with no other lettuce texture to break up the \"fuzziness\" of the frisee. \u00a0The duck egg was good, and the warm yolk coated the frisee, but there was just too much lettuce! \u00a0Buried at the very bottom of the dish were very large, good tasting chunks of bacon, but the chunks were so large that they could not be supported by the frisee and always sunk to the bottom. \u00a0The flavors were good, if they were only able to be eaten in closer \"proximity\" to each other, but that was really not possible. \u00a0It was a bite of egg, a big mouthfull of frisee and then a chunk o bacon.  My main course was the beef cheeks, which were stupendous. \u00a0They were melt-in-the-mouth delicious and everything on the plate really went well together. \u00a0I'd definitely go back, but not for the salad.",

Sometimes a little mushy though, so those who aren't a fan of chickpeas should stay way.  French Onion Soup - This was traditional and decent. It was missing my favorite part though: the bread on top.  Scallop &amp; Corn Chowder - Rich, but really good. It had smoked bacon, potatoes, pieces of fish and clams. The soup tasted great with the clams, but it was a little too rich for one person.  Strawberry Gazpacho - Very unique with the sweet based strawberry. When I saw this on the menu, I thought this would be weird but I was pleasantly surprised. Also has crab &amp; cucumber salad and basil and is pink!  Dried Apricot &amp; Sage Country Pate - The pate was made well, but it wasn't outstanding to me. I love spreadable soft pate, but this was more like a roll. Also had house-made mustard, watercress, cornichons, and crostini.  Liberty Farms Duck Confit - Nicely cooked duck with a delicious salad. All around a great dish with cherry vinagrette, shaved fennel, and mixed cresses. Warning: a slightly bitter salad.  Manchego &amp; Chorizo Stuffed Mary's Chicken - Chicken was cooked well, but the stuffing was interesting. The highlight was the shelling beans and the grilled shisito peppers with aioli underneath.  Slow Cooked Pork Confit - Best dish of the evening. Came with yellow corn, house-made bacon, fava beans, tarragon, sweet-corn sauce. The pork was perfectly cooked and fell off the bone. YUM.

    "review_text": "Best burger in S.F.??? \u00a0Quite possibly... \u00a0It is the best one I have had so far...and I am no foreigner to bacon cheese burgers  Overall: 8 Service: 9  Ambiance: 8  Food: 8 Food (for the price): 10  Bacon Cheese Burger (package) : 10  Burger Meat: 10 As leftovers: are you kidding? \u00a0There weren't any Zert: N/A Charity: N/A   Summary: The burger was GREAT as was the service. \u00a0They have a good selection of wine and it is reasonably priced. \u00a0The fries were good but were too short to do much with; if they were twice as long (the same length as most shoestring fries) they would have been perfect since they brought four dips for them (mustard, vinegar, ketchup and a spicy sauce of some sort.)  Memorable items: The burger. \u00a0The burger. \u00a0The burger. \u00a0The meat was good enough to eat on its own, they cooked it the way I wanted, and the smoke gouda cheese was a great touch. \u00a0They use Marin Sun Farms meat, which is incredibly tasty. \u00a0They could do something a bit more creative with the bun (I know everyone is doing ciabatta but that is because it compliments burgers...or why not try a sour dough bun - your burger would be awesome with sour dough). \u00a0The service was also very good. \u00a0Even though they were packed (it is a big place so there is never that much of a wait) we found a high-top at the bar and ate there. \u00a0I always love it when a server doesn't blink twice or tell me \"that is going to cost extra\" when I order something that isn't on the menu. \u00a0Seriously, if I am going to order a bacon cheese burger when there is no bacon mentioned anywhere I am well aware it will cost me extra. \u00a0Our server was great and only asked me how I wanted it cooked. \u00a0THAT is great service! \u00a0This might be one of the first times I have had a burger that cost $15 ($12.5 plus cheese and bacon) where I didn't feel like I got taken. \u00a0 I don't know when the standard burger price went up over $10 but in most places it isn't worth it..  So far, this is the best bacon cheese burger I have had in S.F...and I have had many. \u00a0I actually started at Zuni, since I heard their burgers were great but was informed that they don't serve them for dinner until after 10pm otherwise the grill would be overwhelmed with orders. \u00a0Well Zuni, let me learn on you a bit of economics...it would be better to offer it, even if you have to charge more at dinner time (so that the grill doesn't get overwhelmed with too many orders), then to tell me I can't get one at all. \u00a0So, instead of having us stay and spend over $200 for food and drinks you allowed us to leave and go somewhere else...which we did...and ended up finding my favorite burger in town. \u00a0I would like to say that I would come back to try yours but with Absinthe being so close, theirs being $12.50 compared to your $15, and them serving it whenever I want it I am going to have a hard time not visiting them again when we are in the neighborhood looking for lunch.  Check out my other burger reviews....I know my burgers and let me tell you - this one is INCREDIBLE!!! \u00a0If you are passing through the city and want a great burger, this is the place to go. \u00a0I am not happy that all burger places seem to think that $10-$15 is now the accepted price for burgers but at $12.5 (extra for cheese and bacon) this one of the few that I find to be well worth it.  @Mikey S... I am having a hard time with your review, which was from only one day ago. First of all, this is an incredible burger. \u00a0Maybe you don't know anything about burgers and that is why you didn't like it but I know burgers and I know meat and this one rocks the house. \u00a0Maybe you were looking for a diner style burger, which this one is not, but there is no way to say this burger wasn't at least in the \"good\" category, no matter what else disappointed you with your experience...of which I also find suspicious. \u00a0When the meat has enough flavour to eat on its own (which this one does) than you know they are using quality meat which usually leads to an excellent burger. \u00a0You state that you had a burger, scallops and a glass of wine for $80 and that wasn't worth it to you. \u00a0Well, the burger is $12.50, which is well worth it. \u00a0The scallops are $30 which seems high to me but that is why I only eat seafood up the coast where it is not only more reasonably priced but usually more fresh. \u00a0That makes your meal roughly $45 at this point (if you got cheese)...which means you had a $35 glass of wine? \u00a0I was surprised to find that they had a great selection for under $10 a glass so I am not sure what you were doing ordering in the $35 range...especially if you didn't know specifically what you wanted. \u00a0That being said, maybe $65 would be a bit much for your scallops and wine but to lump the burger in there as not being worth it or not being good is criminal.",

When the fries finally came the waiter, Keith, did not even apologize and blamed someone else. Not to mention he had \u00a0a major attitude.  Then we ordered the burger with egg on top, and for the second time in 1 month, the egg came on the side. \u00a0This is the most ridiculous thing. If 2 people are sharing the burger with an egg, the server should ask if we want the burger cut in the kitchen or if we want to cut it ourselves. But why the hell would the egg come on the side? \u00a0 This isnt breakfast! When we ordered it on the second visit, we specified to the waiter that we want the burger NOT cut and with egg and cheese on top. \u00a0The dish did not show up this way and when we called him over, he again had a major attitude and made us feel like it was our fault. \u00a0  He just took the plate and didnt even tell us what he was going to do: new burger with a new egg? Or same plate and they put egg on the burger? Didnt even say he would be right back with corrected dish. We were left guessing.  Then, the manager showed up and asked us what was wrong. She was super nice and apologetic about it and said we would get our dish immediately. \u00a0This is the only reason I am giving this place 1 star.   It's a shame this has happend because we go to the ballet a lot and always come to dinner beforehand. Now I am going to give my business to another restaurant in Hayes valley that deserves it and appreciates its patrons....",

We let our server help recommend our courses.  The soft garlic pretzels are a must and the french onion soup is delish. The roasted beet and burrata was well balanced but sadly skimpy on the burrata.   We shared the coq au vin as a main (apparently this restaurant is famous for it), which I had never tried previously. It was rich and flavorful... but ultimately chicken is chicken. I wouldn't get it again.  For dessert we shared the german chocolate cake and the pot de creme. Both were rich... too rich to finish... but delectable.   Seems like a nice spot to come before the ballet or opera.",

Well-balanced &amp; restrained without sacrificing interesting &amp; unique combinations. Over the course of the night the three of us tried five cocktails and they were all excellent. * Wine - A ridiculous list, obviously, but with plenty of options at a variety of price points. I always look for a bottle whose price I know to gauge what the markup is, &amp; from what we could tell, it looked to be a very reasonable 2x. The sommelier was knowledgeable both about the wines as well as how they would pair with what we were eating &amp; made spot-on recommendations both times based on what we told him. * Salads - So good. Generally I like a good salad during a fancy meal, but in this case, I might recommend skipping it so that you have room for... * French onion soup - The best I've ever had. I wanted to die, it was so good. The only drawback, really, is that it's big &amp; rich enough to almost be a meal in itself, which was kind of a problem once I got to... * Coq au Vin - Oh. My.

I originally was going to do brunch at NoPa with two friends, but that fell through so one friend and I went to Absinthe instead as a back-up, but it ended up being the highlight of my day.   The burger as I said was delectable. Good quality meat, ordered it medium rare (it was really rare! but that's ok) but the toppings (fried egg, cheese, and tomato) were all an additional $1.50 add-ons. I am sorry but I come from a place where tomato and onion are standard and should be included with every burger. Charging extra for a tomato is just plain greedy people.   Second qualm, the service was not that great. Waiter seemed disinterested, only seemed like he was there to collect tips and was not really interested in helping us, or providing excellent service. He didn't check us on the entire meal expect when he brought the check.   I will revisit this place, and I will order the burger again, but I'll be damned if I pay $1.50 for tomato again. That's just dumb, as I already said above :)   I also hope I get a different waiter. That's it.",

    "review_text": "My partner and I had an excellent and enjoyable evening here! We loved it. Very nice atmosphere esp the lighting.. created a lush romantic setting. It did remind us of our time in Paris.   We had reservations via OpenTable so no waiting. The bar area was very busy, dining room less so but it was 7pm so still early. We had perfect table in the corner. Loved their wine menu.. amazing variety, lots of French wines and others from around the world. Priced from $40 I think to well over $500. We had a Bordeaux, Chateaux Dutruch Grand Poujeaux.. one of the better red wines I've had. I must have been lucky picking this one since there are many many many to choose from and I'm not familiar with most of the wine on their menu. But you can't go wrong with Bordeaux (plus it reminds us of Paris again). Loved that a sommelier came over and poured the wine for us. Fancy! :)  We started out with the pretzels based on Yelpers. They were Ok, not sure they were worth the $8. Loved the sauce though.. we asked for more bread so we could dip them in it haha. For main course I had the pork shoulder and he had the coq au vin. Both were presented well, pretty dishes. And tasty as well! One quibble.. we both thought they were a little salty. A minor complaint though. Since we were not too full yet, we ordered the brown butter panna cotta with pears... I had not been previous fan of panna cotta but this made me change my mind, so delectable!  We had a great time! Service was top notch, impeccable. Everyone from the hostess to the wait staff to the person who filled our water to the sommelier.. they were all very nice, very capable, very professional.. and most importantly, esp in a French restaurant.. very nice and not snooty. Oh, and we really like the Hayes Valley neighborhood. Lots of nice things to see on our walk from Nob Hill (actually our first time in the neighborhood). My partner has bias against French places.. but Absinthe may just have redeem the French for him haha. Vive la France!",

Anyway, the service is chipper and efficient. A variety of absinthes are available, as are several cocktails that include it. I had no idea which absinthes were more treasured than others, so I ordered one of the mixed drinks (the Wonderlust, I believe). Delicious! Not overly sweet, which kills most cocktails for me.  The duck rillette had a marvelous texture, served over their unique French-style bread. Greens with a tad of vinagrette topped it, and added a bite necessary to cut the fattiness.  Their French Onion Soup was one of the best I've had in the City. Tons of caramelized onions, and the gruyere on top was stringy and gorgeously browned.  Finally, the Croque Monsieur was arranged very nicely, with the sandwich cut in two and stacked, with a side of mixed greens. Lovely!  Spendy, but I would try it again, as their menu appears to change rather frequently.",

It tends to be a nice place that I've wanted to try in the City, and just haven't been around to yet. This way, I don't have to wait for some guy to bring me there - I can just bring myself there!   Made a reservation (I will admit dining by myself is lonely, but definitely great for accidental eavesdropping)  Ordered the following: Sacred heart - which was tequila, citrus, and absinthe. I could taste the absinthe - that anise flavor was a strong aftertaste, but I did enjoy it! Doubt it was the hallucinogenic kind.  Soft garlic pretzels - Absinthe is known for this dish. I definitely ordered it because I want to try it. It wasn't amazing, because of the cheese sauce. I just didn't love it as much I really hoped that I would have.  French onion soup - someone had said it was an amazing dish...and it was! I enjoy a good french onion soup.  Duck with wild rice hash - duck was amazingly cooked. Very little fat on it because it was all rendered out. The wild rice hash was great as well because it had some pieces of duck in it so it tied well together. There was some sauted spinach, but there was also some raw spinach. That was weird to me.  German Chocolate cake - YUM! It came with this coconut lime sorbet that was different, but it wasn't the best either. I REALLY had wished for some chocolate ice cream or vanilla.   Overall, loved the place. Drinks and food was great. Ambiance - mostly romantic, but good for dates and dinners.",

To be honest, when you put something in that little comment box in OpenTable you think, \"yeah right, like they'll actually get this or read it.\"  When we arrived a little early for our reservation we were not quite hungry yet as it was an early reservation to accommodate the matinee performance. The host pleasantly understood and pushed our reservation out a bit so that we can grab a drink at the bar.  The drink menu here is fantastic. If you're not an expert mixologist, then you'll enjoy trying something from their large cocktail menu. And if you have your favorites, they'll have the right liqueur. We had some unique martini's and enjoyed each of them.  When we did get seated for dinner we passed many of the less appealing tables and got seated in a very personal two seater booth where you get to sit next to each other. Having already smelled many of the wonderful dishes we were very excited to begin ordering. We started with some cheese and another round of drinks and ultimately ate our way through multiple courses into dessert! It was some of the best food I have had (pork confit, risotto, pate).  As we awaited for our dessert, I was pleasantly surprised by the attention we received all evening and specifically when the plate arrived with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate.

While we waited for a table to be cleared we took a seat at the bar. We listed off four separate cocktails and the bartender delivered post-haste. She was friendly and efficient with the cocktails matching the service. Tragically, it was all down hill from there.  When we were seated the waitress didn't give us the impression that she wanted to be serving us. She couldn't manage a smile and was short on words. If they had specials that night we certainly weren't informed. It was a long time between our water being brought to the table and our orders being taken.   As the food was delivered we were notified that there had been a shift change and a new waitress would be taking over. We would only be graced with her presence twice during the rest of the evening. She never checked to see if we were enjoying our food. Perhaps most unfortunate is our cocktail glasses from the bar sat empty on the table for the entirety of our meal. Considering we were at Absinthe on the recommendation of their cocktail list the establishment lost out on at the least four more cocktail purchases.   After sitting at the table with empty glasses and plates, the waitress failing to return to our little section of the restaurant, the busser asked if he could clear our table. He saw my companion had his credit card out and it must have alerted him to the fact that we hadn't been offered our check yet, because he groaned, walked away, and came back with dessert menus. It was a commendable acknowledgement of our situation and we discussed pulling him aside and giving him the tip.   We declined dessert and I watched him head off to the cashier and say something. Roughly five minutes later our waitress returned and also asked if we wanted desserts. We repeated our \"no\" and she turned away. We assumed she left to bring us the check, but it was at least five more minutes before she came back.   Our dinner took nearly two hours with roughly 30 minutes of that being actual food consumption.  I had the lamb shank, and it was fine, but not memorable enough to make up for the lousy service.",

We ordered from the bar menu (it was close to 11:30pm) and got the smoked salmon, french fries, hot dog and chaource cheese - of course they all had fancier names than that but it is what it is!  The thinly sliced toast that came with the smoked salmon was scrumptiously crunchy and went well with the sour cream concoction paired with the salmon. I enjoyed that. The shoestring fries were a little on the salty side and not that impressive. The hotdog was aiight but like most \"homemade\" sausages, the texture was a lot more rewarding than processed meat franks! It kind of crumbled in your mouth. Sounds weird, but it was like: ooh real meat.  Last but not least, the Chaource cheese - this came with some walnut/raisin bread and some grapes. We had just watched Pan's Labyrinth the night before so something about those grapes felt sinfully forbidden. And I ate them. Every last one of them. And they brought out the sweetness of the cheese. (I never thought I'd say that). Creamy cheese with a strong flavor that came in a burst and gently faded away on your palate.   Yeah. I dig cheese.  The service was good, the company was wonderful, the cheese quite delightful. Not sure I'm quite sold as a fan yet, but I guess I'll have to go back to decide!",

But i was sure, it was from the bar and was alcoholic. Just a little disappointed that I couldn't enjoy the burning sensation that comes with most alcoholic drinks. =P  There were 3 in my party, and we shared the mussels and clams dish as an appetizer. Delicious! The sauce was so good I kept sticking my spoon in there and enjoyed it like it \u00a0was soup. I tried my best to not be seen by the other diners who were enjoying their sophisticated dinner. I was a little embarrassed, but what do you do when it's that good?  I had the chicken with cornbread stuffing, and it was amazing! There was also the bass and the pork confit, and the bass was very lightly flavored and pretty yummy. The pork was on the more intense side, almost too sweet for me. I thought Mary's chicken (I think that's what it was called) was just perfect. The skin was lightly crispy, very well flavored, and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. The brussel sprouts were sweet and cooked to just the right amount of.... crunchy ? mush? Whatever it is, it was GOOD  We did order a dessert, and we really wished we picked something else. We ordered the sorbet, citrus sorbet or something like that. WOW was it bitter or WHAT. It was a couple of scoops of this sorbet stuff and some agar cubes or something. The sorbet was VERY very bitter. It had a lot of grapefruit, but I think they put more of the skin than the fruit itself. We took a few bites trying to decide what we should do with it, and we could not get ourselves to eat it any more. The waiter saw that we put our spoons down after few bites and offered to take it out of the bill. The service was great, I think they may have had someone new, training. She snuck in behind one of us to clear the pepper and salt and it was kind of funny to watch her squeeze between the wall and the person sitting, and trying to be sneaky.   Yummy food, good service, the food was a little slow but the waiter said they were backed up a little. It was a busy night, so it's not a big deal.",

We too had heard the Absinthe burger is Right Up There for a perfect gourmet burger in our fine City so in the name of duty we hightailed it over there to road test it for ourselves.   It was a great burger, but there were things about it that were off, and we all know when a burger is described as perfection, EVERYTHING about it must follow and work in harmony together. With Absinthe, the bun did not cooperate with the fabulous Niman Ranch meat, blue cheese, spicy onions, lettuce etc, which created something of a challenge to eat. With that said, I still thought it rated pretty high up there, though not nearly as perfect as I'd heard.  I dig the atmosphere of this place however. It feels \u00a0so cozy and old school San Francisco. I'll be back but maybe on a hunt for a different experience than what the burger offered.",

The chive-potato cake has a hashbrown kind of crunch to it, which went perfectly with the poached egg that drizzled down &amp; into the duck confit.

We may have been a tad underdressed and we were definitely the youngest ones there. I think this is the reason why we were seated in the back hah.  Despite this, we were still treated well. Our server was really nice and attentive in an appropriate way. Very accommodating.   The prices here are pretty steep but quality is wonderful. I chose to get the grilled cheese/portobello sandwich, soft garlic pretzels, and a Cintron Lemonade to sip on. My friends got the Masumi Farms Pork \"French Dip\" and a Guadalajara cocktail while the other got the grilled chicken/prosciutto sandwich. Later on, we shared a German chocolate cake based on our waitress' recommendation.   It didn't take too long for our food to get to us although my appetizer came after my meal. It wasn't a big deal.   Soft Garlic Pretzels - expensive little things, but the best pretzels I've had in my life. Buttery and delicious. It's like, high quality finger food. Even the cheese sauce was amazing!  Grilled Cheese/Portobello Sandwich: Delicious. Expensive at $14, but it's a huge sandwich and it comes with a huge pile of house made chips. I was only able to eat half of it because it was really heavy (it's a very buttery sandwich).  Grilled Chicken/Prosciutto Sandwich: My friend had the same issue I did, but he seemed to enjoy it very much.  Pork \"French Dip\" : This sandwich was different in the way it was prepared, but my friend liked it a lot. The fries overwhelmed him, but they're good quality fries (remained crispy after sitting for a while).  Cintron Lemonade: Hangar One Buddha's Hand, ginger syrup, fresh lemon-lime juice, ginger beer &amp; a topping of cranberry juice. Looks as girly as it sounds and tastes just as nice.  Guadalajara: I forgot what was in it because it wasn't my drink, but it was pretty good. Looks even girlier than the drink I got, but it tasted much stronger.  German Chocolate Cake: We chose to get this based on the recommendation of our waitress. We're glad we trusted her because it was the best German chocolate dessert I have ever had in my life. The mousse is very light yet strong enough in flavor. The coconut inside was delicious and complimented the dish well. The caramel sauce was amazing and the toasted pecans really added texture and a subtle nutty sweetness. Amazing.  GREAT PLACE but madly expensive so expect to spend a pretty penny on some great food.",

The Cava is the most reasonable bottle on the menu, but there are so many other options to explore. They had like 15-20 different Chablis! Like, if you looooove wine, come here! However point is, it was lunch and we ordered a ton of random items to share. So in short, we ordered a reasonably priced bottle of Cava to compliment everything. It did NOT disappoint.  The service was good. Nothing stand out. Ok, our server kind of seemed like he may have been having a bad day, but when I asked my boyfriemd what he had thought, he said he thought the service was fine. So, yeah.

Ambiance is fun and inviting; service is typically friendly and efficient, and servers may ask if you are attending a show (so they can put a rush on your food/drinks).  If you were to only order 3 items from this delectable and numerous options menu, the following would be my suggestions:  1) The burger and pomme frites are top notch. Can't ever go wrong with that pairing, as the burger is juicy and cooked to perfection (Medium).  2) Mac and Cheese - This simple dish has such a bold and sinfully good taste, and comes in a very hot dish. The cheese is literally sizzling upon arrival. Oui Oui!  3) Garlic pretzels - At minimum, you need to order 2 of these. One for me and one for me! Just Kidding.. Ok,ok... one for him, I guess :-) I don't know what they do to these pretzels to make them so darn delicious and tasty, as the pretzels are served warm and are soft and the outside is crisp, and the butter, oil, garlic sauce makes you want to lick the plate clean. Ridiculous, I know, and I fully admit to doing that, and proud of it)!! The cheese dipping sauce is also served warm and just as divine!  Go ahead and sit at the bar area and enjoy the following above items if you can't get ressies or don't feel like waiting for a table. You can also ask for the sourdough bread and butter (and sea salt), as it's highly addictive as well. Special cocktails (my fav is \u00a0Ginger Rogers- Gin, fresh mint, ginger syrup, &amp; lemon juice, 9  topped with ginger beer) are available, as well as a wide variety of wines and select beers (on draft) if that tickles your fancy. \u00a0Dessert menu includes creme brulee, chocolate pot de creme, and banana sticky toffee pudding.

    "review_text": "Ambiance was dim and romantic. Waitress was decent. The beau and I started with 6 oysters-- each of us had 3 different types of oysters. Oysters were alright. I've definitely had better. I had some sort of peach cocktail that the waitress suggested tasted like biting into the sweetest pear ever-- I don't know what kind of \"sweetest pear\" she's had, but it wasn't sweet whatsoever. The beau had a mojito and he nor I were not pleased. I've had better mojitos at elephant bar.  We ordered a cheese plate and it was excellent. We also had the French onion soup which the waitress said was the best she's ever had, but I would have to say it wasn't all that great. It was yummy but not the best. Maybe I'm not so much a French onion soup kind of lady.  I ordered the sole, which was kind of disgusting. Salty on some parts and bland on other parts. It was too mushy and unappetizing. \u00a0Definitely would skip this place.",

    "review_text": "I've been here a few times for brunch and one time for lunch.  BRUNCH: Each time for brunch I ordered the seasonal fruit and poached eggs over duck confit - except one time I ordered some poached eggs over black beans and (I think pork?), which was a mistake, not because it was bad (though it was salty), but because given the choice you should ALWAYS choose duck confit! The duck is moist and sooo perfect.. I don't even really care about the little potato pancakes underneath, which have been too salty at times. The seasonal fruit is always awesome and never just an assortment of boring grapes and unripe melon but blood oranges, mangos, and all kinds of wonderful things.   LUNCH: I went with friends during dine about town, but I ended up ordering off the regular menu since I dislike panna cotta. I ordered the grilled cheese and portabella sandwich, which also includes fennel, little bits of broccoli, and pesto. I added bacon (duh, Absinthe has some of the best bacon ever). It was very delicious and the buttery grilled bread is reminiscent of a sandwich at Tartine. The server we had was the sweetest and checked up on us a lot. My only complaint is that a coke should never be $3.25.. ever.   Anyways, I wish I could afford to drop $30 on breakfast or brunch more often!",

    "review_text": "This was the 2 hour vacation away from my life. \u00a0I roll up casually after getting of the glamorous 21-Hayes bus, my splendid coach with so many horsepowers. \u00a0I'd taken it at the most appropriate time, right after people are getting out of work, around 6pm, on a thursday night. \u00a0Most are just rushing to get away from the insanity, some are on their way to find insanity.   In my fabulous couture attire (jeans and a little black dress with running shoes), I glided in a smooth as a ballerina. \u00a0I could see everyone turning emerald green with envy when they saw that I was carrying and owning the very latest and most practical school wear: \u00a0the backpack crammed full of every girl's beauty essentials. \u00a0The 17 inch macbook pro, practically unwieldy in the possession of such a small Asian as I, and yet I flaunted it, I worked that runway known as Hayes Street. \u00a0I made them look at my fab-u-lo-si-ty. \u00a0  When I entered, the hostesses immediately knew what I wanted: \u00a0a seat at the bar. \u00a0Next to me was an LV wielding Opera fanatic that ate the tiniest oysters, on the other side was a jet-set record producer who had flown to 3 continents in the past 4 days. \u00a0Oh. \u00a0Darling. \u00a0Let me tell you. \u00a0Being fabulous is never easy.  A glass of the savignon blanc. \u00a0The bartender was very good at listening and soliciting the story from every weary patron. \u00a0An order of fries. \u00a0And escargot. \u00a0I was in heaven. \u00a0  Now the fries are unlike any other fries I've had. \u00a0They are nearly chips because they are so crispy. \u00a0I would have liked them a bit more limp. \u00a0A bit more mealy. \u00a0And the batch given to me were the end scraps, the crispy, super-fried bits. \u00a0They tasted good, but the texture was a bit too crisp for me. \u00a0I like the middle bits of the fries. \u00a0Tender, slightly soft in the center, that kind.  The escargot came out in a little skillet, covered with toast and a few lemon wedges. \u00a0I've never had them with lemon wedges. \u00a0It was still not salty enough though the flavors of parsley was fresh and fragrant. \u00a0The garlic was nice, though I like it really garlic-y. \u00a0And the shells. \u00a0Without tongs. \u00a0So I had to use my fingers to hold the little suckers in place while I dug out my bounty.  I am giving this 3 stars because it was an A-ok experience. \u00a0I think it could have been better. \u00a0But I didn't have time for it to be better. \u00a0And I don't think they had the space. \u00a0The place was hopping! \u00a0I will come back and actually try dinner. \u00a0I've heard it's quite good. \u00a0Oh yeah. \u00a0I wanted more bread with my escargot but I was too shy to ask because the place was really packed and I obviously wasn't spending as much on booze as the 2 groups next to me.  No sf health on the bill. \u00a0that made me smile.",

    "review_text": "You know what we are missing in Austin? We have everything from 7-course prix-fixe dinners, to some of the best Mexican food ever, to Polynesian food carts that serve intestines. But do you know what we are truly missing? A place like Absinthe.   Absinthe was Jen's choice for our Saturday brunch. We had reservations for 12:30, and even though we had to walk farther than we had planned because we bolted off the L bus when we suspected the guy next to us was preparing to shoot up heroin, as soon as I walked through Hayes Valley and its rich collection of home decor shops and arrived at Absinthe, I knew I was at home.   We arrived exactly on time, and were informed a booth was almost ready for us. We replied that was fine, and spent the next five minutes milling about a PACKED house. Jen told me this was normal, as not only was Absinthe just known as a fabulous restaurant all around, it also was a popular pre-show venue. Normally we'd sit at the bar, but I'm not lying when I said it was packed. Even the bench up front was occupied by a girl with a boyfriend who was clearly out of her league. I was just thinking he must've been on a whole lot of absinthe to be with her, when the hostess found us and informed us it was taking a lot longer than expected, and the people weren't leaving. I told her to tell them I was there, and kick their lolly-gagging behinds out. She laughed, not knowing I was only half-joking.   I decided to take in the decor while awkwardly standing around. It has a very warm, sumptuous look about it. I recall a lot of jewel tones (such as the maroon walls) and I loved the hardwoods and brass accents. It immediately reminded me of my favorite brunch spot in Boston, Stephanie's. Any place that has champagne on ice as a decoration is OK by me.   Finally, our corner booth was ready. The mural behind us on the wall was a nice touch. We settled in and ordered two bellinis (White peach pur\u00e9e and champagne). Great starter cocktail. I know it wasn't the most imaginative drink on their menu, but Mama was a little tired from all the gay bars the night before, and a bellini was the perfect ease-in drink of the moment.   Our appetizers included a flaky, buttery croissant with butter and jam, but the real stars were the deviled eggs. The presentation of the smoked salmon, salmon roe, and capers was just delightful. The flavors were perfect to get the appetite going. I could probably have eaten a dozen more, but we had oysters on the way.   At least I thought we did. Our orders of the Duck-Confit Ragout (Wild mushrooms, chive-potato cake, poached eggs, b\u00e9arnaise sauce) and the Absinthe Hamburger (Storm hill angus beef, a\u00efoli, red onion, lettuce, house-made pickles, and French fries) arrived next. My duck confit was cooked perfectly, and I appreciated the variation of textures with the crispy potato pancake and the soft, poached eggs. The meat portion could have been a little more generous, but overall it was excellent. Jen has become quite a connoisseur of hamburgers as of late, and remarked this ranked as one of her faves. I could tell by the thick, juicy patty she was right. (Sidenote: Can I make \"Juicy Patty\" work as a drag name?)   Our oysters arrived sometime in the middle of our entrees, which was odd. There were three different varieties, but we both agreed the smaller, sweeter versions were our favorite. However, consuming the raw oysters alongside our more savory meals did create an odd juxtaposition. We would have liked to have cleansed our pallets between the two.   Dessert--I opted for the Chocolate Pot De Creme (Valrhona Nyangbo chocolate, cr\u00e8me chantilly) and their suggested wine pairing of the Lustau, Dulce, Moscatel Sherry from Spain. The chocolate was divine, and not too sweet, allowing the sherry to add that layer in. Jen could not resist ordering the Persimmon Sticky Toffee Pudding with buttermilk vanilla ice cream and poached apples, mostly because 1.) She has rarely seen it on a menu, and 2.) It's one of her mother's holiday specialties, and she wanted to see how it stacked up. Final verdict? While it was indeed enjoyable, it wasn't quite up to the homemade version. But if you're looking for a particularly British-style dessert, this one is perfect.   5 Stars. 5 Stars all the way, except...service. A few points: 1.) A complimentary drink as an apology for our longer than anticipated wait would have been appropriate, but was not offered; 2.) The timing of the oysters was unacceptable; 3.) We were charged for an extra cocktail we did not order; and 4.) Empty plates languished far longer than they should have. It's all relatively minor stuff--and our brunch wasn't torpedoed or anything--but it explains why I had to deduct a star for an otherwise fantastic brunch.   I'll admit it. We don't have a truly upscale brunch spot like this in Austin. So... Dear Austin,   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We need a place like Absinthe. NOW. \u00a0  Thanks in advance,  Nathan.   4 Stars.",

You can sit side-by-side in the dim lighting on a plush banquette in the bar area so as to avoid the full-on face-to-face. You can order a cracked crab which is a hands-on project so it takes the focus off of the convo and onto what you do best together - being sensual- ripping apart the crab, pealing off the shells, pulling out the meat, dripping it in butter, feeding it to each other.. You can drink wine, nibble on caviar, drink more wine, touch each other on the thighs, get the coq a vin and say the word 'coq' over and over again, and drink more wine. If you are lucky and there's not to many people around when the scharffen berger chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me arrives you can put a big spoonful on your tongue and then give him a long deep kiss..

Thankfully the trip was quick enough to get the much needed food in my belly.   We started with the butter lettuce salad and knowing we were sharing it the waitress brought it out split on two plates. Smooth butter lettuce and crisp slices of watermelon radishes were paired with a cider vinaigrette that was only slightly acidic - very easy on the stomach for a Sunday morning.   My friend's ricotta pancakes were perfectly done with a toasted outside but soft cheesy inside. The caramel apples lent a nice sweetness to the dish without overpowering it with sugar.   I couldn't decide between a bunch of other delicious sounding dishes but finally settled on the\"breakfast sandwich'. Fried duck egg, raclette and andouille sausage on grilled brioche was a nice twist to a classic favorite, although I felt \u00a0the sausage was a bit too salty for a dehydrated weak stomach. After seeing every other table order a burger I was wondering if I missed the \"big hit\".   An order of brunch potatoes were the much needed carbs our stomachs needed. Thick cut, roasted just enough to keep the outside crisp and the insides tender, starchy and yummy.   After stuffing our faces and 3 cups of coffee later, we were recharged and ready for some Hayes St. shopping. Absinthe offers a bustling atmosphere that reminded me of the energy found in similar NYC brasseries - Les Halles, Balthazar, Pastis - it's stimulating for a Sunday afternoon meal. It gets crowded so make reservations or be prepared to wait.",

Food was delicious, I had the duck that was cooked to a perfect medium rare and had a great sauce. The rice hash was very different and I thought I wouldn't like but was a great accompany to the duck. I usually eat only a portion of my meals when going out to eat but had to devour this one to the very last bit of sauce on the plate. Definitely a place I would like to take the bf to on a special night or when we want to splurge a little.",

    "review_text": "Had a fantastic dining experience at Absinthe and I only wish there was something like this in San Diego. The ambiance is small, but comfortable. We had an excellent little table next to a wall that felt intimate, even in the lively restaurant. Our server was nice and very knowledgeable, especially about different kinds of Abinsthe and when it came to recommending them.  We started with the Chickpeas and the Pretzels. Chickpeas were fried perfectly crispy and nicely spiced. These are delicious and a PERFECT bar food. I could snack on these all day and night! Pretzels are bite-sized, soft little salty, yeasty morsels, accompanied with an excellent cheese double-dip-me-please sauce.  I had an unforgettable dinner here, which unfortunately is no longer on the menu. It was Sea Bass, sunchoke puree, roasted brussel sprouts, and a vadouvan-caper beurre noisette, which is fancy-talk for a friggin-delicious butter sauce. I loved everything about this dish: how excellent the fish was cooked, how perfectly everything was seasoned, the creamy sunchoke puree, and most of all, the friggin-delicious butter sauce.  Hubby devoured his Filet that came with fried garlic chips, melt-in-your-mouth mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was delicious, and cooked just right. For dessert, we had a Butternut Squash Cake, which I wouldn't recommend, although it is also off the menu now. Cocktails were all very good, especially my St-Germain infused one, but do try the Absinthe. Our waiter gave us excellent recommendations and we highly enjoyed it.",

Cocktails are awesome and they have an extensive list, I mean, binder of choices :-) I have yet to have dinner here, but if it's as good as brunch then I'm sure it'll be great. \u00a0  For brunch if you're feeling savory try the burger with all the fixings, its delicious, but you'll need a digestive nap afterwards. If you're feeling sweet try the ricotta stuffed french toast. Also, I took my mom here (yes, I'm a shameless Italian mama's boy) the other day and she had the crab sandwich with bacon and thoroughly enjoyed it.   If you sit at the bar the bartenders are usually pretty cool and fun to talk to if they aren't running around like crazy.  If you're in need of some coffee to help you burn through all the yummy food you just ate, try closing out your culinary delight with a Spanish Coffee. \u00a0They really good and a lot of fun to watch the bartender make (think fire, melting sugar, and burning cinnamon, YUM!!).",

I am a hands-down Top Chef fan. \u00a0I, being the devoted follower of all things \"TC,\" decided it was time to check out Jaime's culinary skills at Absinthe. \u00a0  One of my galpals and I wanted to make a night of it. \u00a0We ordered champagne, apps, entrees, and dessert. \u00a0We wanted to really check Absinthe out. \u00a0  Apps: 1. \u00a0The smallest oysters I have ever seen in my entire life. \u00a0It was about the size of my thumb (just the tip). \u00a0I was shocked that they charged $3 per each oyster. \u00a0Had we known, we would have never ordered 6 of them. \u00a0Rip off! 2. \u00a0French fries with aioli, was absolutely delish! \u00a0I could have eaten handfuls of those fries. \u00a0They were seasoned perfectly, potato-y, and altogether lovely.   Entree: 1. \u00a0I ordered the halibut with sunchokes. \u00a0It was BLAND. \u00a0No salt, no pepper. \u00a0I had to cover my entire plate with S &amp; P and finally I could taste the fish. \u00a0The fish was cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside, silky on the inside, but without flavor, who cares?  2. \u00a0She ordered the lamb shank. \u00a0I am not a huge fan of lamb, it's way to gamey for me, but even so, I still tried a bite (because I'm a daredevil), and it was alright. \u00a0She said it was \"falling off the bone\" good, I believed her.   Dessert: 1. \u00a0After stuffing our face with mediocre food and apps, we wanted to end our meal on a high-note. \u00a0Glanced through the dessert menu, saw the lychee sorbet, thought brilliant! \u00a0It came on a bowl with these tricky crunchy bits, that I still have no idea what they were used for or why it was on the sorbet in the first place. \u00a0The dessert was NASTY! \u00a0It was bitter and left the most funkiest aftertaste. \u00a0The waiter saw our disposition and asked if everything was alright. \u00a0We told him that our sorbet was not good and he suggested ordering another dessert (on him). \u00a0He recommended the panna cotta, so we obliged. \u00a0At that point, whatever. \u00a0 The panna cotta was again, weird. \u00a0It came with strawberries and graham cracker (so far, so good), and PESTO! \u00a0Come again?!?!? \u00a0What the sam hill...  It was like eating cheese pesto with strawberries. \u00a0  I sighed. \u00a0She sighed. \u00a0We laughed and shook our heads. \u00a0It was time for the check. \u00a0 It was about $77/person. \u00a0A bit pricey given how \"not good\" the food was.   I will say this much, the service was outstanding, too bad the food doesn't compare. \u00a0  Will I ever go back there again? \u00a0Maybe for the pappas fritas, otherwise, NEXT!",

I suspect that is rather unusual, but so it went).  My friend had the French Onion Soup which smelled delicious, but was probably not vegetarian. \u00a0There are very few vegetarian dishes offered, but I had the mixed local greens salad which was really good.  Likewise my friend had the Dungeness crab which he seemed to enjoy while I really liked the the Roasted Baby Beets and Quinces, quite good!

We shared the pretzels with cheddar mornay, she had the burrata and I had the beef tartare. Everything was just OK. The burrata was pretty delicious because well it's burrata and there's little you have to do to make this more \" melt in your mouth\". My beef tartare was very \"herby\" too much taragon and parsley and there's a better version over at Wayfare Tavern for the same price.   Overall. this place in Hayes Valley is great for drinks but you're better off diving elsewhere in the area.",

We showed up about 20 minutes early for our reservation on a thursday night, but they were very accommodating and seated us right away, so 1 point for them!  The restaurant vibe was great-- a little loud overall but where we were seated was quiet enough. Our service also was really great, 5 star service.  We ordered to start the fried chickpeas, french onion soup, caesar salad, and the garlic pretzels. All of them were really really good, but honestly... those garlic pretzels were out of this world. Like, in the running for best thing I've ever eaten. Just thinking about them right now is making me want to go back!  Two of us ordered burgers and then our other friend got the coq au vin. The chicken and the sauce was really good-- I only had a bite. The burger was good, but honestly it was nothing special.   I think when I go back I will probably either sit and the bar and just eat those garlic pretzels like there is no tomorrow, or I will order a different entree.  Overall: 5 stars for service, 5 stars for the appetizers, and 4 stars for the absinthe burger. (I'd love to give this a 4.5, but overall it was a great experience so I'll bump it up to 5)",

Our waitress was knowledgeable and patient and explained what exactly absinthe is more thoroughly than I think any of us cared to know, but still very nice of her. She recommended cocktails and checked on the gluten content of the liqueurs for my gluten-sensitive friends. I got the Galapagos cocktail and it was perfectly strong and sweet.  We ordered the soft pretzels as recommended by 7x7 and they were truly to die for. Might be the best bread product I've ever eaten.   Entrees were good, although one of us ordered a Caesar salad which turned out to be 4 leaves of romaine hearts with a slice of Parmesan on top...not nearly enough for dinner. I wish our waitress had given some kind of warning about the size of the salad.   Coq au Vin, stone fruit salad, and the swordfish were all really delicious, but my friend who ordered the hamburger didn't seem as thrilled about her dish as the rest of us were. Other than our poor friend with the 4-leaf salad, portions were big and it took a little effort to clear our plates.

I'm so used to bars that are very light on the alcohol when they pour, this place will not let you down if you're looking for something with a bit of a bite!   We ordered some cheese to start, a little pricey but definitely good. Be sure to use all of the ingredients that they put on the plate, they are paired with the cheese for a reason!   We then split a filet, which was served with potatoes, some spinach, and a beautiful sauce. SO delicious. By far my favorite part of my meal. If it was socially acceptable to lick the plate, I would have.  We finished our night at Absinthe with their \"napoleon\". Don't order this if you're looking for a traditional style napoleon. This was unfortunately the only part of my meal that I didn't think was absolutely outstanding. We knew it was a unique variation of the treat, but I didn't quite care for it.  Service was lovely, lighting is both edgy and romantic. A little loud towards the front where the bar is, much quieter in the back where the seating is. Be sure to make a reservation as the place is pretty busy. We made ours on OpenTable and ate here after going to the symphony. Check this place out if you're around the area!",

We had a dinner reservation as the place is extremely popular at night and sat at a two-top in the dining area behind the bar. \u00a0We passed the owner of the Boxing Room on our way to the back - he must give Absinthe a thumbs up as well because it looked like he was loving his soup.  The list of cocktails is extensive but our waiter helped me decide on an absinthe drink called the Sazecar (I think that's the name). \u00a0It was good and strong. \u00a0The Citron Lemonade is also good, light and fresh.  Our appetizer was the delicious soft garlic pretzels (also on the 7x7 Big Eat SF list). \u00a0For $8 and five little bite-sized pretzels, they are probably the most expensive pretzels around but with the melted Vermont cheddar on the side they are nearly to-die-for.  We then shared Roasted Beet and Green Apple Salad. \u00a0Well done and I recommend.  As for entrees, the Coq Au Vin (chicken) and the Pork Osso Buco are musts. \u00a0Both were devine and I would eat again.  Absinthe won me over and except for the loudness of the bar feeding into our meal, I will go again.",

    "review_text": "During Dine About Town 2012 I made a reservation at Absinthe Brasserie &amp; Bar. The list of restaurants during Dine About Town is longer than I will have opportunities to try, but just the name alone drew me in. I've always wanted to try absinthe (the drink), so I figured this place would have some options.  First, let me give you a suggestion: arrive early. The Hayes Valley neighborhood is a very nice area to walk around in. There are some restaurants, bars, and stores to look in (I saw other places I want to try), and a nice little parklet on Octavia a block away. A second suggestion: take MUNI! Absinthe isn't far from the Van Ness MUNI rail station, and then you don't have to worry about parking, feeding meters - or drinking &amp; then needing to drive.  Walking around the exterior of the restaurant, the first things you notice are the golden logo on the glass, and the Private Dining room to the right. This looks like a great venue for a private event, with entrance, restroom, and bar separate from the main restaurant.  Walking into the restaurant, I was immediately drawn in by the color scheme, very warm &amp; inviting. This seems like a great place for a date or a business brunch, and I saw both types of diners the afternoon I went.  I've never had absinthe before, and the menu listed many options. I asked my waiter for help. He explained that different absinthes have different strenghts of flavor. The main flavors in absinthe are anise (like black licorice), with a background floral note. He suggested a mid range absinthe from France. A glass is served to you, ~1/3 filled with absinthe; this particular one looked clear like vodka. A slotted spoon with a sugar cube in it are placed on top of the absinthe glass. A separate container of chilled water, and a glass of ice cubes are also supplied. You very slowly drip chilled water over the ice cube, dropping sugared water into the glass. The absinthe clouds to a milky white color, called the louche. The waiter explained that normally you'll end up with double the amount of liquid in the glass. He said the best thing is, taste at various points to figure out how you like it (you can always add more water, but you can't take any away). My taste was approximately doubling the amount of liquid, using up virtually all the sugar, and 2 ice cubes. Everyone's different. I don't love black licorice, so I didn't love this drink, but I can check that off my bucket list. I'd like to try some of the absinthe cocktails on the menu as well.  For lunch, I had pan roasted Mary's chicken breast. You could say it's hard to mess up chicken, and it's also hard to distinguish your dish from another. But this chicken was excellently prepared, moist inside, with just the right thin crunchy exterior. Very tasty. It was served on a bed of mash potatoes which were rich, creamy &amp; delicious, and rainbow chard with mushrooms that were flavored with the chicken jus. I ate everything on my plate. This is one of those dishes that sounds deceptively simple, but getting it to taste just right is difficult. This was excellent.  For dessert, they served a roasted white chocolate panna cotta with raspberries &amp; a cocoa nib crumble. It had the consistency of a vanilla pudding, covered with some crunchy chocolate bits &amp; raspberries. Not heavy, just a nice finish to an excellent meal.  A very tasty meal at a fine restaurant. Service was excellent. I had a nice chat with the couple next to me about other Dine About Town experiences. Their dinner menu looks a tad expensive, but their brunch &amp; lunch menus look reasonable, and of course the Dine About Town menu was a great deal.  - Adam",

    "review_text": "After a great dinner with friends in Hayes Valley, it seemed only appropriate to drop into one of the more famous, albeit crowded, bars in the area for a smart cocktail. \u00a0Absinthe features Jaime Lauren, one of my favorite contestants from the Bravo show Top Chef, and has become a local hero for her energy and creativity in the kitchen. \u00a0While we only really came for the absinthe loaded drinks, I was excited at the potential of being able to meet her.  Absinthe is known for serving up some excellent absinthe cocktails and it was my first change to try some. \u00a0I ultimately ordered a drink without the green stuff but did get a chance to try it via friends' cocktails. \u00a0I haven't quite warmed up to the unique flavor and effects but can see myself enjoying it after a few tries. \u00a0I ordered the \"Scarlett O'Hara\" which consisted of Willett Single Barrel Bourbon, Nardini Amaro, and Leopard Brothers blackberry liqueur, with a lemon twist. \u00a0It was extremely tasty and the twist was peeled on the spot, which added an additional layer of quality and freshness to the cocktail.  Since we were occupying a table, we decided to order some fries to nibble on. \u00a0The fries were delicious with their bell pepper aioli, Dijon mustard, and vinegar dipping sauces and I really enjoyed the small cut with perfect crispness. \u00a0However, the fries were cut a little too small for my tastes and were a little difficult to eat.  While we didn't get a chance to meet Jaime, we did get to enjoy some really great cocktails. \u00a0The service and ambiance were extraordinary and it as a great venue to hangout and catch up with friends. \u00a0I'm not sure whether absinthe has quite grown on me yet, but it was definitely an interesting new drink. \u00a0Absinthe is every bit the awesome, classic bar that many have raved about, and despite the inflated cost of the cocktails, worth every penny for the unique experience. \u00a0Come for dinner and you just might be able to have your picture taken with San Francisco's own Chef Jaime!

    "review_text": "This review is of my dinner during Halloween weekend. Better late than never, right? we were a party of three without a reservation and were sat in a reasonable amount of time. The table was in the bar area, which had the smell of vanilla candles. Looking around, I couldn't spot the candles, so it may have been a guest with heavy perfume. i't was somewhat heavy handed and distracting when we first got it. Once our drinks and food came, we were able to forget the candle smell.  The service was ok. They sat us and the server wasn't able to get to our table to take care of us right away. The service was otherwise fine. It was kind of full in the bar area (Halloween weekend people, so there were a few people in costumes too) so it was difficult to tell how busy the rest of the restaurant was. The only misgiving I have was for the server who told us, after the fact, how we are supposed to taste the wine when the wine is corked. It was well intentioned, but we just felt awkward afterward.  My kudos go mostly to the food. We started with the chickpeas, oyster shooters, and pretzels. The oyster shooters were some great call backs to bloody marys that used the brininess of the oysters. The pretzels had a smooth, creamy mornay that made be miss those big pretzels in malls and movie theaters. The potato crusted arctic char was well seasoned, had a crispy golden potato crust, but overcooked for my taste. Pork rib eye was great. The red cabbage was just the acidic touch that helped cut through the cheesy grits and juicy pork. What I liked about the vegetarian plate was that it was even artfully plated. Just doing a Veg Plate is one thing, but to take the time to conceptualize the plating shows that the kitchen really cares about making the food a part of the experience.",

    "review_text": "\"What's a brasserie?\" my partner asked. \"I don't know, isn't it French?\" \u00a0I leave the French, Spanish and Russian words to him.  Brasserie: an unpretentious tavern that serves drinks and food  I can see this place being \"unpretentious\" in the SF sense because the furnishings are classic, not unusual or unique. \u00a0But the restaurant is beautiful, the decor alone making it perfect for an elegant date night.  What took it over the top was the outstanding meal.  --- FOOD: Summer Menu 14 ----  Crispy Skin Pork Belly: 5 stars. The crispy outer layer had a perfect heft to it, like crunching down on a chunk of honeycomb, then having the fleshy fat fill in your mouth around the perfectly tender pork belly meat. Every element on that dish contributed to the complexity: \u00a0from the tangy pickled root (fennel?) to sweet cherry, perfumed arugula, and whipped fennel cream like a soup I would slurp up if I had a whole bowl of it.  California Swordfish: 5 stars I asked the server to help me decide between this and the Potato-crusted Salmon. She said \"Oh, the swordfish. All day.\" The smell of the dish preceded it as it approached: a sweet adolescent char, telling you that a grill was used but not excessively. A perfect browned seared crust makes a knocking sound when tapped with a fork, flat and evenly brown and caramelized hard, not soggy. When I took a bite I was shocked, \"Is this sashimi?\" from the way it burst in my mouth. But it was perfectly cooked, juicy, just heaven. \u00a0The plate was swirled with umami-filled sauces - a golden corn pur\u00e9e, orange pepper cream, and the juicy red peppers were amazing.  Roasted Leg of Lamb: 4.5 stars Mascarpone polenta, porcinis, zucchini gratin, charred tomatoes, pine nuts, black garlic jus.  German Chocolate Cake: 3.5 stars Good, but tasted much better when I jettisoned the coconut layer under the cake. Also, the candied roasted pecans stole the show.  Buttermilk Panna Cotta: 4.5 stars A lovely light refreshing dessert, not too sweet except too much Basil cream on top.  Perfect with the Moscato slightly fizzy dessert wine  ---- FOOD: Fall Menu 14 ----  Wonderlust: 5 stars Delightful cocktail in a martini glass, containing creme de violette, absinthe, and lemon juice.  Sazerac: 4 stars  Heirloom Tomato Salad: 4.5 stars The melons were sweet, countering the piquancy of arugula, and cradled by the glob of soft crescenza cheese.  Beef Grilled Black Angus shoulder: 3.5 stars Good quality beef, standard, would've been better if the mashed potatoes and mushrooms had been dressed in a more intriguing sauce.  Caramel Panna Cotta: 4 stars Bruleed marshmallows with a delicious burnt caramel cream and spiced apples in the bottom.  Goat Cheesecake: 4 stars Light and not too sweet, not as creamy as crumbly.",

I didn't expect the bar area to be so crowded, but we managed to get a drink pretty quickly anyway while they readied our table. (We were a bit early).   My boyfriend was a bit worried as the valet parked his car right out front and what seemed to be a little too close to the curb, but from what I could tell after dinner the rims weren't scratched (big deal on a new GTI.)  My boyfriend ordered this insane Chipotle-infused vodka which I accidentally sipped and regretted it (yuck!) But he liked it so I'm not marking off any points for that.   We sat and ordered the fried spiced garbonzo beans which my boyfriend was crazy about but I was impartial to them. He then got the French onion soup which he said was delicious. Entrees: the bf got beef cheek (WEIRD) but very delicious and I got the cornbread- stuffed chicken which was tender and yummirific. The plate could have used a bit more of that squash or whatever sweet puree was on the side of the plate, but overall it was delicious.  Now here is where Absinthe really earned their 5 stars: the dessert.  I had this mind-blowing coffee ice cream with some kind of pastries and candied brazil nuts and OMG I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  Alas, I didn't see the bill, so I can't say price-wise how it was. (VERY expensive I'm sure!)   I would have hated to sat in the front room with the bar because it looked cramped and was kinda noisy. Not sure if that area is for walk-ins or what (we booked ahead on OpenTable). But I really enjoyed the service, the fun painted walls, and the overall ambiance.  Not sure if I'll be back for dinner because it's kind of a \"do it once and check it off your list\" thing (and the $$$ factor) but I'd definitely love to try a brunch here.  Merci bcp!!",

And hey, I always love a place that doesn't get upset when I dump a glass of water on the table (accidentally, I swear!) :o) I ordered two eggs scrambled that with awesome rosemary potatoes, two pieces of toast (slightly overdone and no butter, odd) and homemade fennel sausage. My friend had steak frites, which (on my one bite) tasted awesome, and when I go back there, I'd most likely order that and the french onion soup which looks super yummy.  Long story short, had a great time, will definitely go back.",

It's warm, intimate and beautifully decorated; I felt so relaxed and at home. We had a reservation at 8:30pm and when we walked in they took us right back to out table.   The really good:  I have never in all my life had a better french onion style soup. I was having a very hard time looking civilized as I attacked it with my spoon at an extremely rapid pace. I may have gotten some soup bits on the couple next to me the way I was flailing about.   The average:  It's not that the service was bad because it wasn't; however, the timing of the meal was not done properly. We waited for what felt like an eternity for our main entree which was frustrating because we needed to be somewhere.   The bad:  How do I put this without sounding crass; the chair I sat in felt more like a torture mechanism than something somebody on a Friday night should be enjoying dinner on. Afterwards, my ass felt as if it had been used as a punching bag.  3.5 stars",

My now fiance took me here on our first date and it was the perfect atmosphere for it. It has such interesting menu choices and gorgeous, unique drinks (absinthe is in several cocktails, hence the name) that getting a great conversation started is easy.   I've also taken friends &amp; family here when they've come to visit us and they always say \"oh I feel like I'm in a big city here\" (I know, sounds silly but when you're raised in a farming town...)   Anyways specifics; the Sacred Heart drink is my fave with absinthe but my fiance would argue that their Manhattan's are the best drink offered. The french onion soup is something you'll crave and come back for and OH the mini pretzel bites well...you just have to try them yourself to understand!   The ONLY con, and it's just a fact of life really is that it's crowded ...all the time! So if you're just stopping in for a drink it can be hard to find a place to sit. However they'll take your cell# and call you when they have something (awesome!) while you walk around the very cute shops surrounding the restaurant.",

We were unable to make the secured reservation, but the host was very accommodating and we were still able to be seated fairly quickly.  The Brunch menu hits all the regular stops, and I ended up diving into the Banana-blueberry souffl\u00e9 pancakes. It had been some time since I had these griddle coins, but it brought me back to childhood memories of Sunday mornings and cartoons. ( Why do we stop watching these?)  Soft, fluffy, and the bursts of fruit within were fantastic. Not being one to indulge too much in the sweeter things in life, I was supremely delighted with my choice.  Another great dish that I was able to sample from a friend were the biscuits and gravy. I'm a sucker for this dish, and while I was trying to avoid it, I was really glad she ordered it.   It's a dish that will stick to your bones, and keep you smiling through the day, and this dish did just that. The gravy is a creamy blend, and it soaks the biscuits thoroughly. Take the plunge, and get this.   The freshly squeezed orange juice is a morning pick me up, and overall I can see multiple brunch visits in the future. Plus, it was nice hearing the other day that one of the Top Chef contestants is the executive chef here. Not bad.",

Now, back to the incredible food -- wow!  The soft garlic pretzels with Vermont Mornay melted cheese to dip in are a must-have starter that are to die for (and you might if you eat more than one, they are small so its OK....) \u00a0 Other high end cheeses are on the menu including Hudson Valley Camembert and Bog Woods Blue Honeycomb. \u00a0Two in our party ordered the Brentwood Corn Soup which was excellent.   For entrees, I have tried the Mahi Mahi with citrus-brown chili butter, apricots, endive, as well as the Za'Atar Spiced Lamb Shoulder with cous cous, Zucchin gratin, and charred tomatoes, each was a bespoke delight.  Another great starter (which is almost large enough to order as main) is the Hawwain Albacore Poke Tune with Habanero Chili, Fried Garlic, and Sesame Oil. \u00a0 \u00a0Incredible.  In summary, the food is worth the service, crowd, and parking hassles.",

    "review_text": "My experience at Absinthe has a curious genesis.  Weeks ago, I bought a pair of tickets for Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Amore (The Elixir of Love) at the San Francisco Opera. \u00a0Elixir is my most favorite opera of all time. \u00a0Period.  The Girlfriend said that she would take care of dinner reservations. \u00a0First she got reservations at Farmer Brown, Tenderloin-ish, but not too far from the Opera House (15 minutets by foot)  Two weeks before the opera, I had an audition at the Opera House, not for SF Opera (I wish) but for Berkeley Opera. \u00a0As I was boarding the BART train in Rockridge I noticed that my photocopy of my audition piece was missing one page. \u00a0I had to make a detour to copy shop on Market. \u00a0As I was walking to Opera House in my audition attire (a suit) I walked past Farmer Brown's. \u00a0It's Tenderloin sure enough. \u00a0Then I started having reservations about our reservation. \u00a0I have no issues with the Tenderloin but to walk in that area on an off-night for most theaters while wearing a suit (and the Girlfriend in a dress) in the dark doesn't sound like a good idea. \u00a0So I promptly shot out a text message to my female half that read:  \"Farmer Brown's, you sure know how to pick 'em.\"  She quickly canceled her reservation and placed a new one at Absinthe, she found the restaurant from a listing on the SF Opera website.  On the night of the opera, we were running late. \u00a0According to the Girlfriend I was being \"snappish\" (I swear I wasn't...Dammit). \u00a0We got here just a little bit late for our reservation. \u00a0Once seated, the tenor of the night changed.  It became awesome.  Over an appetizer of french fries we discussing if it was sacrilegious of us Oaklanders to proclaim these fries to be better than the ones at Luka's. \u00a0But those fries, while awesome in their own right, were quickly eclipsed by the main course. \u00a0The pork confit was, scrumptrilescent, as in \"there is no word good enough to describe it... so I am going to make one up right now...\"  The pork was tender and the sauce was perfect. \u00a0But there was one little element of taste I couldn't figure out until a server explained it.  Server: \"You know, we use duck fat in the confit.\" Me: \"Aahhhhhrrhhrhrhhrh.\" \u00a0*drools*  Yes, the duck fat totally made the dish and my arteries are probably still clogged. \u00a0Gotta do some cardio.  We made it to the Opera with plenty of time to spare. \u00a0That performance was easily \u00a0metaphor for our evening; it started out just a little bit rocky, but it ended great.",

My boyfriend ordered the Estancia burger with smoked Gouda (which was an extra $1.50 for a slice), and housemade pickles. \u00a0It was pretty good, and, the meat being from Estancia, put us back around $12. \u00a0I didn't mind that. \u00a0What I did mind was the local Halibut with asparagus and cauliflower. \u00a0This was truly a disappointing $29 entree that the waiter recommended. \u00a0The fish was dry and lacked flavor. \u00a0The saving grace of this dish was, sadly, the vegetables. \u00a0I'd recommend skipping the fish here and maybe trying the risotto or one of the small plates. \u00a0Those sound more appetizing.  We also ordered a cheese plate with Grevenbroecker (blue cheese with balsamic), Tome du Haut Languedoc (goat's milk cheese with hibiscus jam), and Pecorino Pepato (sheep's milk cheese - sharp and probably my favorite of the cheeses). \u00a0All three were really tasty, and we finished every last crumb of the cheese and accompanying bread. \u00a0It's never good, however, when the highlight of the meal is a cheese plate!  I wanted to give Absinthe a higher rating, but I just can't justify being happy paying over $100, including tip, for a meal and service that was just blah.",

So I just ended up getting the Perfect Pear cocktail (very delish) and some smaller nosher plates I shared with a friend. We got the country pate appetizer, escargots, prawn salad. and an order of their shoestring fries (these are sucky photos, sorry). Everything was very very good, especially those little escargots, which came to the table all hot and sizzling in a cast-iron pan. They give you these funky escargot holder thingies to facilitate their extraction, and I must say they were quite delectable! The shoestring fries, with their various accompanying dipping sauces were excellent also, but I wish they'd been a little longer--I felt like a pig reaching in there every second. Prawn salad and pate were very good, also--everything tasted very fresh and well-prepared. Other people had the trout, chicken, and a bunch of other stuff, which I forget, but I think we all uniformly enjoyed our food. I must say the service was top-notch; even when we screwed up on our math with the bill and was kind of arguing with our waiter about it he was perfectly pleasant and retained his equanimity til it was all sorted out. This is not a cheap place, but I do believe I got my money's worth. It ended up being a great evening out with friends.  UPDATE: Forgot to mention that they were out the halibut that night, and it was something that two people from the party had wanted, so that was kind of a bummer.",

Not only was she unpleasant to start off with, she didn't even bother to ask if my BF wanted a second drink (his glass was empty the entire time we were munching on our snack bites). She did however, manage to eat a meal and take a shot in front of us. The final straw was when she presented our check with a mouth full of food... Thanks a lot! Extremely unprofessional!!!!!

I am a sucker for monochromatic twinkly lights.   Once lured inside, you see a lovely, quaint set up. There is a nice bar area with cute little tables by the front window, where couples and friends sit enjoying the vast array of special cocktails, wines, and cheeses. We decided we will definitely return some day for drinks and cheese.   If you are there for dinner, as we were, and if you have a reservation, they seat you right away in the dining area, which is farther back or on the side of the restaurant. We were seated at a cozy \u00a0booth in the back. My husband would have preferred to be up front in the bar area by the window, but he hates booths, so this wasn't a surprise.   The excellent service continues throughout the night. The wait staff is always there when you need them, but not overbearing. Our waiter was also quite knowledgeable about the menu and every single ingredient in every single dish.   The food: I actually loved the scallops. The dish was less about the scallops than about what they sat upon, which was a scrumptious and savory blend of wild mushroom, caramelized onions, and some sort of heavenly onion puree. MMMMM, mmmmm MM. So good.   My husband had the lamb, ordered medium. It was also delicious. This dish is very influenced by East Indian and Mediterranean flavors and spices. The base of the dish is a bed of perfectly prepared and flavorful chickpeas, upon which sits the lamb, on top of which sits a bed of salty and pungently flavored cucumbers. \u00a0Together, this makes for a perfectly balanced bite.   The drink menu is large and impressive. I ordered a half glass of champagne for my birthday, and my husband had two cocktails (he enjoyed the degalis \u00a0but not the second one, whose name he can't remember right now).   The dessert did not disappoint. We ordered the pot de creme, which was creamy, cold and sweet. The coffee was also quite good. Next time, we will try to be a little more adventurous and order the mince meat dessert.   I also forgot to mention, the frisee salad was warm savory and comforting. The hamachi was fresh, and topped with just the right amount of Indian - influenced spices. Yum Yum .   Overall, we were very impressed by Absinthe. The ambiance, the service, and the food were all outstanding. I plan on returning again with a friend for drinks and to try their substantial selection of fine cheeses.",

    "review_text": "It was our final night in SF and my BF has always wanted to try real absinthe, so we came to this place with high hopes!  First off, The list of absinthe that they offer here is almost endless! So many choices! Since, we were totally new to this experience, the waitress was glad to give us a recommendation.  WOW...after a glass, my BF felt cross-faded hahahaha! I had a tiny sip, and it was HANDS DOWN the strongest thing i've ever tasted. All for the experience this one. It was awesome!  The food was also very very very good. No complaints except for the AC; the restaurant was hot and humid, kind of uncomfortable, especially after drinking.  All in all, SF has done us no wrong, We were so impressed, and cannot wait to plan another trip up there in the summer.",

    "review_text": "I came to Absinthe on a recommendation from my mother after she had a wonderful experience. I made reservations for two for 5:45 p.m. on a Friday night. We arrived about 15 minutes early but were seated immediately. We actually ended up waiting about 15-20 more minutes for a server to even come to our table to greet us, which was a little nerve racking for me. I totally let this slide, though, since we were early. However, there weren't many tables seated at the time and I don't really know what the hold-up was all about.   Our server eventually came over after another table was seated near us (thankfully?) and we ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and a cheese tray with three cheeses: Blythedale Camembert (the first cheese I've ever tasted in my life that I actually thought was disgusting), Beemster (my favorite), and Pecorino Ginepro (delicious). Each cheese was served with a different jam or spread and delicious house-made walnut bread.  We both ordered the hearts of romaine caesar salad, which was absolutely delicious and probably one of the best caesars I have had. The garlic croutons paired with the wonderful dressing were top-notch and I really enjoyed it.  For my entree I had the potato gnocchi, which to me seemed to be the only vegetarian entree even though a yelpy insight exclaimed that \"vegetarians go nuts for this spot.\" It doesn't really matter because the gnocchi was delicious and I ate every bite of it without complaint. I loved all the different kinds of mushrooms in the dish. An option was also to add Italian black black winter truffles to any dish for $10. I would have loved to do it, but it just seemed even more excessive than all the food we were already ordering!  After ALL OF THAT FOOD, we ordered the chocolate Pot de Creme and a shot of espresso. This was a delightful way to finish everything off because even though I don't normally eat dessert, I was glad we did because it was wonderful and the espresso was just the right touch with the chocolate.   Even though the service might have fallen short in the beginning, we ended up having a wonderful waiter that was checking on us constantly and he did a fantastic job. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a special meal at an upscale restaurant.I would definitely go back if there weren't so many other restaurants to try in San Francisco!",

The French onion soup tastes just like the ones I have had in France and the poke is so un-French but totally delicious! The char entree is like a deconstructed nicoise salad and is phenomenal. Tried the duck and coq au vin as well and they are both good choices too. Brunch is pricey but definitely worth a try as well!",

All of the waiter attention was on us practically... obviously a plus. We started with the cauliflower soup and shared the french dip. A pork sandwich that was sooo tender and still pretty juicy is impressive. They put the au jus sauce on the side for us to dip and that was damn flavorful. The fries were a little over fried, but no worries, I still ate them. I must come back for dinner one of these nights!",

The pretzels for appetizer is a must. So soft and savory. Yum! I also had a coconut corn soup. It was on the sweeter side. A hint of Thai. I didn't like it as much.For the main course, I had the Breaded Chicken Paillard. The side salad that came along with it was delicious. I wish there was more of it. Two big pieces of chicken. Well, big for me. I couldn't finish it. It was juicy but I felt that it was a little on the heavy side. Then finally the Chocolate Pot de Creme. It was not too sweet or heavy. Just perfect. I want to come back for dinner to try out the rest of the menu!   The restaurant seems to go on and on with space. I'd think it would be good to have a little gathering there in their private dining area.",

    "review_text": "Came here to celebrate Valentine's day with my gf. \u00a0We've been passing by Absinthe's for many years and always look into the window and see a crowd of people filling the place. \u00a0We've decided to celebrate Valentine's day one day earlier so we didn't try the special four course menu they offered.  For dinner we had caviar service, hamachi crudo, mushroom pot pie, lamb t-bone, and finished it off with earl grey pavlova and grapefruit sorbet.  The caviar service was Tsar Nicoulai Osetra and for $75 it was a pretty good deal seeing as how most places charge $90. \u00a0Even though I doubt I was short changed on caviar, I wish it would have come in the standard jar/packaging instead of dumping it all into another bowl/jar. \u00a0They did use an ivory spoon so kudos to knowing that as too many places just uses silver. \u00a0  The hamachi crudo was excellent. \u00a0Slices of hamachi with blood orange, radish, fennel, and vinaigrette. \u00a0This dish had an excellent sweet and sour taste to it and somehow finished it off with a bit of saltiness. \u00a0Even though it's a bit pricey 5 pieces of $17, I highly recommend it.  The mushroom pot pie was flavorful and filling. \u00a0The crust of the pie goes really well with the sauce and the truffled essence. \u00a0The gf had this dish but if it was me I'm not sure I would be able to finish it because it tasted very heavy. \u00a0Nonetheless it's not every place that serves a mushroom pot pie.  The lamb t-bone was excellent. \u00a0Perfectly cooked and seasoned, it was soft and juicy. \u00a0The bit of yogurt on top of it complemented it very well. \u00a0Additionally the farro was extremely delicious. \u00a0I'm not sure I've had it before but the way they made it, I enjoyed it very much. \u00a0To finish it off the beets were also excellent.  We also ordered fries and I think we could have skipped this since it was too crunchy and pieces were too small. \u00a0The ketchup and the aioli weren't great either.  For dessert the earl grey pavlova took a major point away as it was extremely disappointing. \u00a0It was blah. \u00a0There was no earl grey flavor whatsoever. \u00a0 \u00a0The grapefruit sorbet was okay but the tarragon syrup messed it up.  Ambiance at Absinthe is great. \u00a0It has a vibe of a bistro in France with music playing softly in the background. \u00a0We asked to be switched one from table to a booth and they gladly did so for us.  Service was not bad but not great, just okay. \u00a0The waitress took our orders but I was disappointed as she seemed to be friendlier and personable with others and I heard other waiters and even heard her introduce the menu a bit to others while we didn't get any of that. \u00a0  Anyway it was a great way to celebrate Valentine's day and perhaps we'll come back another time.",

In addition, my boyfriend and his friends were at the bar browsing the menu for alcoholic beverages as I was attempting to reserve a table and the staff was also very unpleasant.

    "review_text": "Great brasserie-style food serving dinner at hours which make NYC ex-pats feel at home. \u00a0If you don't grab an early bird special with octogenarians before the Opera, then you are famished by the end of a Verdi and ravenous if having seen a Wagner. \u00a0This place gets the French classics spot on and deserves 4 stars for that. \u00a0The huge list of artisan cocktails and, more importantly, \u00a0the rare (for San Francisco) sophisticated late night dining experience bring it up to a 5th.  French Onion Soup Gratin\u00e9e: Possibly the best French Onion soup I've had in town! \u00a0The broth is savory, the onions melt away, the bread has a toasted presence but is not overwhelming and the cheese is just the right mix of gooey and crispy. \u00a0The cheese isn't baked on top and oozing over the sides, but I can forgive that minor detail.  Steak Tartare: The meat was pretty darn good, but I've had better quality around town (Harris' and BIX). \u00a0However, I do appreciate the innovation. \u00a0A lightly poached egg is used instead of raw to give a bit of egg white texture and flavor. \u00a0The haba\u00f1ero adds much stronger kick than traditional onions or capers. \u00a0I barely noticed the mint though. \u00a0Overall, a nice revamp of a traditional favorite without traveling too far into the avant garde.  Duck Confit: This leg rests in duck fat for over three days to produce an extremely rich and crispy treat. \u00a0A tad small to make a meal out of, but great snacking material. \u00a0They were right on the mark for this classic.  Hamburger: Not sure how they did this, but the outside was extremely rich and seared while the inside was perfectly medium rare as requested. \u00a0The veggies were fresh, but nothing memorable. \u00a0The aioli was by far a better topping than ketchup or mustard. \u00a0The bun was a tad too dense for my liking.  Oyster Shooter: Had to get this since it looked cool. \u00a0You are presented with a single oyster on ice, a wedge of lemon, a shot glass of Bloody Mary mix and a shot glass of vodka. \u00a0How you take it is totally up to you. \u00a0I added the oyster and lemon to the Bloody Mary mix and topped it off with vodka. \u00a0Pretty strong! \u00a0Way too much liquid compared to oyster meat. \u00a0I think it would have been nice if a trained professional arranged the proper ratios... or maybe I just need more practice.",

    "review_text": "3.5 stars.   I finally managed to get my butt into Absinthe last night, and I'm slightly disappointed by how 'American' the food is. I was kind of looking forward to food with more French flair. Here's what we had:   Two Kumamoto oysters. At $3.25 each, the oysters aren't cheap, but they make a succulent and refreshing appetizer, perfect for whetting the appetite.   Pan-seared scallops. A poorly presented dish, in my opinion. Also, even though the scallops themselves were perfectly done, and the roasted vegetables were tender and delicious, I don't think all the components came together particularly well.   Liberty farms duck breast. This dish was very flavorful (emphasis on very). I liked it better than the scallops, mainly because the creamy farro risotto it comes with was sooooo so good.   TCHO chocolate pot de creme. The classic lives up to it's hype. Rich, creamy, and ultra-chocolatey, it's everything a chocoholic like me dreams about.   Overall, I think Absinthe may be overhyped. I do not enjoy being at a table that is a mere foot away from two other tables. Also, the restaurant is incredibly noisy, which is not ideal for a serious date. The food is good, but the main courses could use more subtlety and refinement. Finally, the service here is friendly enough, but a little on the slow side.   Would I come here again?   I'd like to try the cocktails at the bar. I'm not sure I would return for dinner.",

I think I can eat it all day every day. Great appetizer!  - Scrambled eggs with potatoes, toast and sausage Standard breakfast plate with an extraordinary quality. The eggs was perfectly fluffy and perfectly seasoned. Potatoes were lightly crisp on the outside and wonderfully warm and soft on the inside. I recommend you dip the sausage in their almond-maple syrup.. soo tasty! *drool*  - Brioche French Toast Not only is it pretty to the eye, it is so extremely kind to your tastebuds.. AHHH!

    "review_text": "I have dined at Absinthe a few times since I moved to San Francisco, and each of the times has been a solid, worthwhile experience.  The last time I was there was on Wednesday for dinner. \u00a0It was before a show at one of the performing arts locations nearby, so it was pretty busy. \u00a0I arrived with my friend; we did not have a reservation, but were told it would be 40 minutes or so. \u00a0We had a drink at the bar, and after what felt like less than 40 minutes we were seated in the dining room. \u00a0Having dined here a few times, I prefer the dining room over the louder bar-seating area, so I was thankful that we were being placed in the dining room.  My dining partner and I started with spicy fried chick peas. \u00a0These were good, but not really necessary for the meal. \u00a0It was something to eat before my French onion soup arrived. \u00a0Mmmmm, I love this and try to get it every time I dine here. \u00a0Large crouton, lots of cheese, and a delicious broth. \u00a0For dinner, I had one of the \"share plates,\" the seafood stew, as an entr\u00e9e. \u00a0This had one very large scallop, manila clams, and PEI mussels in a bacon-bell pepper nage with crostini spread with herb rouille. \u00a0Uhhh, the herb rouille blew my mind. \u00a0Like a heroin addict on mid-Market, I wanted more, more, more. \u00a0The seafood was cooked perfectly. \u00a0The size of the dish was so-so; I don't know that I'd want to share the plate with anyone if I ordered it as a \"share plate.\" In the past, I have had the hanger steak here, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  My friend had the acorn squash soup for a starter; it looked delicious. \u00a0He followed it with the burger, which came medium; personally I would have bumped that up to medium well.  I know I will be back to Absinthe. \u00a0I still need to try to the Sunday brunch at some point. \u00a0This restaurant is a solid choice for the Hayes Valley area. \u00a0As for the price, you don't have to spend a ton here, but it is always tempting to do so. \u00a0For me, it's worth the price.",

I ordered the french onion soup and the wild mushroom omelet and had citron press\u00e9 to drink (how refreshing to get some real French lemonade!), and my boyfriend got a scone and something else. We appreciated how the waiter brought an extra scone for free (they were 'smaller than usual'), and of course all the food was fabulous. The omelet was a liiiiittle on the salty side but still some of the tastiest mushrooms I've ever had!  The second time we went, we got a table in the second room. It was a little bit more crowded so the service wasn't quite as prompt, but it was worth it when my ricotta-stuffed french toast showed up. The portion was HUGE but I ate every bite (despite my protesting stomach) because it was so delicious! The ginger lemonade was fantastic, as well... I think I had about three of them.  I'd really love to come here for dinner sometime, but it's always packed!",

    "review_text": "I'd been wanting to try Absinthe for awhile, but haven't had the opportunity. Well, I needed a mid-week nice dinner spot, and Absinthe had an open reservation. Overall, I was really pleased with the place. Absinthe excels at being exactly what it's trying to be: a nice french-style brasserie with excellent cocktails and a romantic atmosphere. I don't think the restaurant is trying to be the next sensation. It's trying to be really good at the basics, and I think it does pretty well.   We arrived early and had cocktails. My date ordered a dark and stormy (which was good), and I ordered a cocktail which I cannot find on their online menu. I do remember that it was rye-based, had some sort of liqueur, bitters, and a flamed orange twist. It was served in a coupe, and was excellent. I thought I was getting some variation on a normal old fashioned, but it was interesting and new.   We sat down, and Kimberly was our waitress. She was great throughout -- talkative (discussing Downton Abbey) and professional. We told her we wanted to have a \"fat kids\" night, and asked her not to judge. She told us she'd only judge if we didn't order enough food. Again, she was great.   We ordered three \"snacks\" -- spicy fried chickpeas, garlic pretzels, and spicy pork meatballs. The first two were awesome. The chickpeas were really interesting bar-type pop 'em food. They had some sort of moroccan spice. The garlic pretzels were divine and came with a great white cheddar sauce. The meatballs were fine, but nothing special.   For entrees, my date had the 8 oz filet mignon, and I had the 10 oz rib eye. Both were excellent. His was tender and marbled, and mine was very flavorful. The jus they covered the steaks with was really flavorful and yummy, and we both replaced the mashed potatoes with frites (which were standard, but good).   With the entrees, I had the Sandler Zin and my date had the Lang &amp; Reed Cab Franc. Both were good, though I slightly preferred his cab franc. But since he was driving, I got a third of his glass anyway -- score for me.   For dessert, which was COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY, we split the awesome german chocolate cake. It wasn't what I thought at all. It had milk chocolate mousse on the outside, with coconut and pecans on the inside. It was lovely! And left us super stuffed.   The atmosphere only added to the experience. Dark, very French, with a nice dining room din that almost adds to the sense of privacy and intimacy in the place.   The total bill was like $140 (exclusive of the cocktails, which I paid for at the bar). The prices are at the high end of what I think is fair. Still fair, but only barely. Kimberly earned every dollar of a 20% tip, which is no small amount at a nice restaurant.   In all, a really great place. You'll definitely enjoy it.",

Evidently this place is pretty popular. \u00a0One nice thing is that they do not seat anyone until they open, so there's no additional wait time beyond the waiting for food. \u00a0Hostess seemed a little pretentious, but they often our. \u00a0Our server was helpful and polite.  No matter what you get, definitely start with the French onion soup, as it is fantastic. \u00a0Very little bread, which I enjoyed. \u00a0Lots of Gruyere cheese, which added a better flavor than most French onion soup cheese. \u00a0  I ordered the dungeness crab omelette. \u00a0Great choice, although I like a thinner egg for my omelette. \u00a0They don't get chintzy with the lobster, as some places do. \u00a0It was flavorful with great big chunks. \u00a0The garlic spinach and mushrooms was also a wonderful addition. It had some hearty, smoky wheat toast and seasoned potatoes on the side.  My friends got oysters, which looked good although I did not partake. \u00a0My friends also ordered the duck confit ragout. It had a poached egg and a delicious potato under it. I had a bite and it was very rich and decadent. \u00a0Being the novice foodie I am, I forever have pronounced confit as \"con-fit\" so don't make that error (\"con-fee\"). \u00a0I also learned that confit means that the duck is cooked in its own fat. \u00a0Pro tip for those who want to look like they're in the know, unlike me, I guess. \u00a0Another friend also got the crispy pork quesadilla. \u00a0It was a little shocking to the palate with the unexpected Latin flavor, but very good as well. \u00a0 \u00a0  All in all, I wish I had a bigger stomach so I could have also tried the brioche French toast or the croque monsieur.

We got the pumpkin custard, which I have to say will go down in my personal foodie history as one of the best things I have ever eaten. The custard itself was smooth and sweet in a gentle, subtle way, and it was presented on a plate decorated with - wait for it... root beer maple syrup and a carrot reduction. Garnished on top of the custard were thinly sliced carrots that had been magically transformed into candy brittle, as well as little tapioca things that had been created with lime juice, gelatin, and the marvels of modern culinary science. Amazing.  In other words, I have never before tasted something so utterly creative and original - and delicious. I haven't been to Absinthe for the full dining experience, but based on drinks, dessert, and service, I definitely give it full marks!",

Ordered the duck. I've never been done wrong ordering duck. And yes, it did do me quite good. Two poached eggs on top of duck on top of 2 hash-brownish-medallions? Oy vey vey ohh. BF got the shrimp roll, which I kind of snuffed initially, but it was good! The shimp was barely cooked, fresh and oceany. UHHNN I like it like that! I also got to take a lil nippy-nip at the grilled cheese. mmMUAH! I am so getting that if I ever come back for brunch.  Also, service was pretty legit.

    "review_text": "A group of us had brunch here today at the delightful Hayes-Valley spot Absinthe Brasserie. The plush red velvet banquettes and red decor made me think that we had time-warped to Paris. Ah to be in Paris.  For brunch, we started out by sampling a morning bun ($3.50). This pastry was springy with a light dusting of sugar and came with a small dish of strawberry jam. Delicious.  Another good starter was a plate of deviled eggs. Hard-boiled egg halves with bits of smoked salmon and topped with caviar. How decadent this tastes.  The lamb sandwich I chose was thin, tender slices of lamb (not at all gamey) on top of a slice of thick brioche bread, a slice of cheese and sauteed orange and red peppers all topped with a over-easy fried egg. When you stuck your fork into the egg, the yolk oozed slowly over the sandwich. The thin frite-type fries had a spicy Berber seasoning that was reminiscent of BBQ spice. Hearty sandwich and, for sure, a winner.  Another member of my party, J, ordered the classic burger. This was a hefty, soul-satisfying sandwich for a carnivore. The plain frites that came with the burger paled in comparison to the spicy fries. You might need to up the flavor with the ketchup.  C ordered a trout sandwich which she enjoyed. She ate it so fast I can't really describe what it looked like.   For B, the traditional Croque Monsieur (ham and melted cheese sandwich) on sliced levain bread was very hearty. Instead of the side green salad that was on the menu description, the server kindly acquiesced to substitute it with some slices of potato with onion relish. This French version of a ham &amp; cheese sandwich was a hit.  Sunday brunch at Absinthe is bustling. They have very good food and an ideal people watching spot on Hayes Street. You can gaze at the beautiful mural walls and Parisian pictures imagining you're in Paris, enjoy an apertif or mimosa or two, as well as gaze at all the interestingly dressed pedestrians who stroll by.   If you find yourself in this neighborhood or receive an invitation to dine here, do not hesitate. Embrace your inner Francophone feelings and say, \"Oui!\"",

    "review_text": "It's a wednesday night and after work I'm getting my haircut at the wonderul oxenrose. I thought it would be a good idea to try out Absinthe since its right down the street. I had only been to Absinthe for brunch about 3 or 4 years ago, so I didn't know what to expect for dinner.   My sister and I are avid watchers of Top Chef and we're fans of Jamie Lauren on the show so we were excited to try out her restaurant. I was finished with my haircut appointment early, so I headed over to Absinthe to have a drink at the bar and wait for my sis.   For a Wednesday evening, they were pretty busy, but as I came to learn, the server said it was actually a really mellow night. The bar was completely packed and the host said I could sit at my table to wait. Personally, I would have rather waited at the bar instead of sitting at my table all alone for more than a half hour, but I understood that they just didn't have the room, so I sat at my table.   After about ten minutes of looking over the drink menu, someone finally came up to me and asked if I wanted something to drink, and only because I was obviously looking around to get someone's attention. Hmmmm... makes me think that if it apparently was a slow night, what service would be like on a busy night? Who knows.   I had the Pegu Club, which was pretty refreshing although not that strong. The cocktail menu was pretty extensive and there was a lot of choice... which almost made it difficult to choose a drink, but I guess I'd rather have more choices than not.   Once my sister arrived, we looked over the menu and decided on 3 different appetizers and one entree to share. The line up: French Onion Soup, Duck Confit, Antipasti platter and the Scallops.   French Onion Soup was delish! Not overly salty and the onions were really sweet. It needed just a tad more bread, since it barely had any, but we just used our table bread as dippers. The Duck confit was tender, a tad on the dry side and salty, but if you ate it with the side salad of ancho cress and apples, then it was perfect. (disclaimer, I really don't like salty things, so it really is just me)  The Antipasti plate was large and really could have fed more people than just the two of us. A lot of selection on different salamis and cured meats with pickled veggies, definitely a go to plate for meat lovers. YUM.   Our last savory course was the scallops. Maybe its just me, but every time I order scallops, I'm always under impressed about the amount they give you and the price they charge. We chose the scallops because on Top Chef, Chef Jamie was always getting great reviews of her scallops, so we thought it would be a definite winner. The dish was great, the sunchoke puree and the grilled artichokes complemented the scallops wonderfully. Only caveat is that you get 4. I know, I know... its just me, but I had to be honest.   For dessert we had the warm chocolate banana tart with malted banana ice cream. Perfect way to end our meal. The tart is really decadent and rich and the banana ice cream which the pastry chef, Irene Cotreras, makes in house is absolutely fabulous. I only wish they gave you more ice cream. Does anybody else feel that way? I always feel like the ice cream servings are never enough at every restaurant... haha.... again, its just me.   Overall great restaurant, good meal. We left really satisfied and happy. \u00a0Cool place and a great vibe. I'd give it 3.5 stars and will have to try brunch again.",

For brunch I got the Duck-confit Ragout and husband had the basted eggs. \u00a0The Basted eggs were good, perhaps a little too smoky? for me. \u00a0The Duck-confit ragout was AMAZING. \u00a0Duck was excellently done, the whole dish was just very well put together and extremely enjoyable. \u00a0The portion sizes were impressive too - They obviously weren't cafe size, but they were good and filling.  Service was spot on and we had a reservation so thankfully we didn't have to wait at all. \u00a0There was a pretty big line waiting for it open, but once it opened everything moved fast. We had 11am reservations and by the time we left close to 12:30pm, the place was packed. It was a difficult getting out.  Mimosas were good - we prefer them a little stronger but nothing worth mentioning.",

    "review_text": "Boyfriend once bit a woman's breast at the bar here. \u00a0In a playful/ drunken idiot trying to flirt way, not a slasher/ date rapist way, at least as he tells it. \u00a0She may have a different version. \u00a0He and his friend were asked to leave. \u00a0So he went to his car and got sick. \u00a0Three hours later he was passed out in his ride with his head out the window. \u00a0A passing homeless man woke him up, saying \"you really should go home.\"  This was before we met.  It definitely wasn't the food that made him sick.  Absinthe is a great place. \u00a0Boyfriend introduced me to it early in our relationship (luckily they didn't ban him for life or anything) and we used to go there often. \u00a0He loves all their oysters and I was crazy about their coq au vin. \u00a0  We went there for the first time in a couple years recently. \u00a0Reading the menu, I didn't see the coq au vin. \u00a0I assumed I had overlooked it until an exhaustive search of the menu, list of specials, and even the drink list failed to yield results. \u00a0I asked the waiter who informed me that the a new chef had taken over nine months ago and both the coq au vin and cassoulet were gone, to the chagrin of many. \u00a0I didn't have high expectations after that, but I was happily proven wrong. \u00a0Our food was different, but just as good as ever.  Boyfriend had the hamachi. \u00a0I was persuaded to try some of the raw fish for only the second time in my life. \u00a0I obviously don't love sashimi, but even I could appreciate the complete lack of fishiness and the surprisingly sensual texture of the flesh. \u00a0He also had four tiny Olymipa oysters which were great, as usual.  I had the sea bass. \u00a0It was served with the skin, which disappointed me. \u00a0Sea bass is my favorite fish because it's so un-fishy, but cooking it with the skin on made it way too strong for my taste. \u00a0It was what the bass came with that left me so satisfied. \u00a0The grilled romaine perfectly underscored the flavor of the fish. \u00a0And the carrot and bacon hash was delicious. \u00a0I could have made a meal of just that (if there were much, much more), it was so good. \u00a0  To top it off, the potatoes it came with were nothing short of the best I've ever had. \u00a0Not the preparation, which was just a simple sautee in butter, but the potatoes themselves. \u00a0They had more potato flavor than I've ever tasted in a potato. \u00a0What home-grown tomatoes are to store-bought, those potatoes are to the ones you usually get.  I don't really remember how it was in the past, but on this visit the staff were all great. \u00a0The waiter in particular was incredibly congenial, exchanging pie shop recommendations with me and informing us that we could have a half salad (I love when waiters aren't just concerned with their bottom line).  The new menu looked great and someday I'm gonna try their entire cheese tasting menu for $99. \u00a0  We had a great time and, as far as I know, no breasts were bitten.",

    "review_text": "Absinthe, a delicious green liquor that seems to warm you and has you seeing fairies. As a restaurant for brunch I felt it having a similar happiness effect. We found this place using the Yelp iPhone app and searching brunch while wandering around Hayes Valley. It was a Sunday and buzzing, but we still managed to snag a table right away walking in at 1pm.  I wanted something different, I mean I can always get my usual 2 eggs over-easy with bacon and toast. It's pretty much the same everywhere, no better, no worse. So I glance at the menu and I see duck confit hash. Yes.  Two perfectly poached eggs sit atop a bed of duck confit hash, two slices of toast and some veges on the side. Maybe it was the bellinis but brunch here was delicious!   My friend also got the french onion soup, which normally I hate because french onion soup always tastes a little sour to me. But it was really good here. The cheese on top was gooey and yet slightly firm on top.   Not to mention that this is the restaurant of Jamie from Top Chef. A great experience. I would definitely revisit to try food from here again",

We weren't disappointed!  We came by after 10pm and decided to take a table in the bar since we weren't sure how much we'd be eating. \u00a0We were immediately impressed with the drink and wine lists - P had a mixed drink with an aged tequila that was super smokey and delicious. \u00a0I tried one of the champagne offerings and was pleased. \u00a0We ordered spicy fried garbanzo beans and oysters as an app and were amazed by the intense flavors of both, though were surprised at the small size (and number) of oysters served. \u00a0We went on to order the house-made hot dog (I know...but Chicagoans are curious when a dog appears on a fine dining menu!). \u00a0Simply put, it was amazing!! \u00a0I still have cravings for it every now and then. \u00a0P didn't think he'd like it because it's not a Chicago dog. \u00a0But even he thought it was spectacular.  After this, another round of drinks - red wines for both of us from their extensive house list - and we dared to try dessert. \u00a0We chose the most intriguing one: \u00a0it consisted of mascarpone, basil and strawberries and was surprisingly delicious. \u00a0I only wish the basil flavor had been more intense - to balance out the sweetness of the strawberries. \u00a0But the creamy, herby sweetness was well worth it. \u00a0  The service and ambiance only enhanced the dining experience! \u00a0Good attention to detail, cozy, French-inspired decor, attentive but not pushy service and knowledgeable waitstaff are all pluses. \u00a0  We will definitely be back for more...likely will try a proper dinner meal there since we know what these chefs are doing with apps and dessert!! \u00a0And, given the restaurant features locally-grown, seasonal ingredients, it'll be fun to find new \"favorites\" as the days grow shorter and the rain comes.",

(Perfect for a group of 6 girls)   They have great selections of cocktail and wine (although I didn't have any for that night, but girlfriends raved about their drinks)  For Appetizers we shared:  -Spicy fried chickpeas: really tasty and reminded me of eating popcorn chicken from Quickly's.  -Hamachi Crudo: the best appetizer of the night!  -Beef Carpaccio: Delicious and fresh!  For entree I had the grilled skirt steak (cooked rare) with a cup of french onion soup gratine. The soup was sooo yummy, but I was fine with the small serving because it gets rich after a while. The steak was so juicy and flavorful that I finished the entire dish! \u00a0  For dessert we shared the Olive Oil ice cream. Interesting flavor and it turned out to be sweet and refreshing.

Leave it to my best bud to get a reservation here, and boy was it worth it!  Best french onion soup EVER! Sure it comes in a small little cup the size normally reserved for JELLO pudding cups, and costs as much as 6 of them, but it's tasty as could be!  Drinks here aren't shy at all, and very from pleasingly sophisticated to put hair on your chest strong. I guess with the restaurant named after an exotic imported brew steeped in mystery, you can't expect anything other than excellent right?  Other menu highlights from the table included the Braised Beef Cheeks and Slow Cooked Pork Confit. Pork Confit definitely got a solid nod of approval from everyone at the table, being buttery soft in texture. The beef cheeks were similarly moist and soft, but didn't quite have the same appealing flavor as the pork.",

Then a bottle of Sancerre from the very expansive, import heavy, wine list.  For my entree I ordered the Bacon wrapped Stuffed trout. Served whole, stuffed with artichoke, capers and other goodies, wrapped in bacon, roasted and covered in a buttery sauce. It was delicious however the richness was a little overwhelming. And a side note, don't order this if you mind picking small fish bones out of your mouth. My friend had the coq au vin which she enjoyed, but didn't rave about.  For dessert we had the bergamot tart, and pot de creme. Both were ok.   Excellent service, good food, and great funky french bistro atmosphere, but overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to return.

In addition to about a dozen different Absinthes, the cocktail and wine lists are expansive--and fairly expensive. Most impressive, however, is the way they served my gin (I chose the locally-distilled No. 209) and tonic. The two greatest risks when you order this simple drink are bad portioning and lousy tonic (like the sugar-water that comes out of those dreaded mixer guns). Both pitfalls are avoided here, with our pleasant server bringing to our table a glass of ice, a carafe of gin, and a small bottle of Schweppes tonic water.  You might feel a bit under-dressed if you arrive in jeans and a tee-shirt, but the entire staff will make you feel welcome nonetheless.",

    "review_text": "A blind date took me here. I was excited because as I was talking about the place with a few of my friends, I had heard only great things about this place. So in I went with an appetite and high hopes.  We started off with a drink each: I got something with pear, and my date got the 21 Hayes. Both were delicious; not too strong with lots of bright and contrasting flavors.   My date proceeded to order the Hamachi Crudo for an appetizer, and I got the Absinthe Hamburger with a fried egg and spicy caramelized onions, and he got the ... you know, I don't remember. But I'll post pics.  The Hamachi Crudo was absolutely amazing. I couldn't believe so much flavor could come from such a small, but beautiful piece of sashimi. The balance of sweet and savory was perfect, and the texture of the sashimi was perfectly balanced with the richness of the oil. I could've eaten two plates of that for dinner and would've died and gone to heaven.  The burger was AWESOME! Juicy, flavorful patty. Egg cooked perfectly; had that satisfying moment when you break the yolk and it slowly dribbles down. The bun could have been thinner; it was pretty dense and swallowed a lot of the flavor. And I wish the caramelized onions were cut thinly instead of large chunks. They kept slipping out when I would take a bite, and I eventually gave up and put them on the side. There was just no nice, clean way to eat the burger, and I eventually dissected it into pieces and ate it with a fork and knife. After all, I WAS on a blind date, and didn't wanna look like an animal. The fries were okay; they were cut thinly, and I'm more of a thick, \"natural-cut,\" steak fries kind of girl.  The level of attention to detail, the professionalism from the staff and the ambiance was great. Even though it was slightly dark and formal, it still had a casual feel to it. I saw many people in shirts and jeans, and it was fine.  Will definitely come back to try some of the other entrees. If I were rating on the burger alone, it would be 4 stars, but the Hamachi saves this review. 5 STARS!",

We got the cookie plate for dessert, which was very yummy, but I only really enjoyed 2/4 cookies. The wait staff is very accomodating and honest about their food recommendations. It can get very crowded so make a reservation, try to get into the farthest room for the entrance so you can have a quieter, more intimate, dining experience. You should also try to come early to get street parking (just have a couple of quarters and arrive before 6) and just walk around the area (there's a couple of small, interesting shops) until your reservation.   For the ambiance and quality of food/service, prices here are very reasonable... but I haven't found the time or money to head back. Sigh.",

Great place to brunch with friends or go on a romantic dinner date.  During brunch, I tried their Duck-Confit Ragout: wild mushrooms, chive-potato cake, poached eggs, b\u00e9arnaise sauce. AHHHMAZINGGG! Such a clever dish that was essentially a twist on the traditional eggs benedict (potato cake instead of english muffin). The potato cake had a hasbrown-type of crunch to it, which paired so well with the PERFECTLY poached eggs and b\u00e9arnaise sauce (didn't taste as heavy as hollandaise, IMO).

The pate wasn't very spreadable but the kumquat complimented it very well. Delish! 3. Pork loin: tasty and cooked to perfection. The loin had a nice sear crust, came with a piece of pork belly, and the sauce was flavorful and not overpowering.  4. Arctic char: (my favorite) seasoned well, the fish was moist and delicate. The thin potato crust gave the dish an amazing texture. I usually avoid anything with olives, but the olive tapanade complimented the dish very well. Disliked the green beans; tasted old and fibrous. \u00a0 5. Mushroom pot pie: truffle and mushrooms, a great combo. The pot pie looked huge, just wished there was more flaky pie crust and less gravy. Gravy could've used more thickening agent and mushrooms for the price of $27.  6. Trout: FYI trout was cooked whole and served with the head on. The trout was nice and fresh. 7. Passion fruit panna cotta: \u00a0yummy!!! \u00a0Love the tartness of the passion fruit and panna cotta was luscious and creamy.  8. German chocolate cake: looks divine, but too sweet and rich for my tastebuds. \u00a0  Cons: 1. Parking 2. Service, Slow. Slightly over 3 hr dinner for party of 4 3. Bread was cold and dry; wished it was warm and toasty especially for the long wait.  4. Adding a few more dishes to the menu.

I had already looked at the menu a million timesn before coming but it still took me a little while to decide. This is what me and my bf ended up getting:  Country Pate: The rustic pate, overall was a little bland for my taste, but  combined with the marmalade and mustard and bread it was delicious!  Big Woods Blue: I'm a cheese fanatic so I HAD to get a cheese on my \u00a0bday! Huge blue fan, so this was a must. It came with some yummy bread and we mixed this with the pate dish.  Chicken entree: just realized that they no longer are serving what I had..but hopefully their current chicken dish is similar! I think all that was different were the sides. I usually don't opt for chicken on special occasions because it can be a little boring, this chicken was AMAZING. Oh so moist and tender! The sweet onion jus paired with the fluffiest polenta I've ever had and yummy veggies were pure bliss.  Bf had the absinthe hamburger which he said was pretty good, but I was too in love with my chicken to try it.  We had the pumpkin custard with streusel and lime for dessert which was also amazing. They aren't serving it now, but I hope it comes back! They put lime on top, which I wasn't really a fan of tho...  2 of the best dinner hours ever spent :)",

Out of everything I tried, the only thing I really liked was the duck confit share plate. \u00a0Everything else I tried was ok but not great. \u00a0The fris\u00e9e salad was probably the worst dish of the night. \u00a0The salad dressing was bland and on top of that, there wasn't even enough!  The dessert was a real afterthought too. \u00a0The blood orange creme brulee was \"different\" but not in a good way. \u00a0Rather than being in a ramekin, it was a ice scoop shaped creme brulee but didn't really have a caramel crust.  Service wise, Absinthe was a real downer as well. \u00a0Besides the Maitre D who was very nice, the rest of the wait staff was not very attentive. \u00a0The sommelier didn't bother to pour our wine and the waiter rarely even checked on our table.  Finally, this is not a criticism but be aware that this restaurant is very noisy so be prepared to talk very loud or else you won't be heard.",

We started with a couple of the \"house cocktails\", Perfect Pair and the Ctron Lemonade. \u00a0 \u00a0They clearly do not water down their drinks! \u00a0Plenty of alcohol in these babies. \u00a0I had to have a second one. \u00a0These were really good, a bit sweet. \u00a0 I'm normally a whiskey guy so this was a nice surprise.  For the Appetizers, we had the soft garlic pretzels with the cheddar mornay. \u00a0Beleive the other posters, don't miss this! \u00a0 We also had the crispy skin pork belly. \u00a0Wow, seriously good... \u00a0Crunchy skin and soft but meat pieces of pork belly with a very simple sauce. \u00a0  Dinner, Coq Au Vin and Pan Roasted Monk Fish. \u00a0Both were tasty, not dry. \u00a0The chicken was moist, tender, and brined. \u00a0The fish was perfectly prepared. \u00a0Texture was firm, almost lobster like, but moist. \u00a0My wife loved it. \u00a0And we also had the side of mac and cheese, don't miss this either.  Dessert... \u00a0What a selection. \u00a0We had German Chocolate Cake and the Carmelized Squash Cake. \u00a0Both excellent, but i'd definitely go back for the Chocolate cake, \u00a0And neither was heavy.  Generous portions of food, well prepared, service outstanding, and nice ambiance. \u00a0We were in the back room and it was fairly quiet. \u00a0The main room with the bar can get pretty loud. \u00a0One of the more enjoyable two hour dinners we've had in a while.",

Maybe caught them on a good day, but I don't think so. \u00a0Everything had improved and the wait staff was all new (at least since my last visit). \u00a0So I'm way-upping my review. From 2 to 4 stars. (and one whole star should be dedicated to the mixed cheese plate. 1 word - Yum-ee. I mostly had an issue with the off-hand staff - the current crop were luverly! Very attentive and made good suggestions and actually seem to like both their job and customers. \u00a0We had a great time.  OLD REVIEW:- Lunched there today. \u00a0Since when does \"decaf\" get pronounced with a high-pitched attitude? \u00a0Bad waiter makes for a bad tasted in one's mouth (no matter how tasty the pork sandwich!). \u00a0Anyway - my companion was unfazed by the rudeness - me, well me too except I am then delivered a burnt espresso. \u00a0Ok I know - only a froo froo finds espressos can even be burnt - but it can M'lords &amp; Ladies, it can! (And talk about bad taste in yer mouth! Yeuch!)  Anyway back to Absence of manners! \u00a0I should have called him out but honestly - he looked like a wee bruiser! \u00a0Pshaw Absinthe, pshaw!",

The dinner: already 2 cocktails in before dinner, the food was not likely to be anything other than supremely delicious. Though the veggie options were slim, the option for the night (fried squash) was heavenly. My fiance had the burger, of which he devoured every last morsel.   Too many drinks + such a satisfying meal meant no room for dessert. (though this just means we have a reason to return)  I'm hoping to try the brunch soon!  Make a reservation. Go here.

While waiting at the bar, my friend and I ordered a side of French Fries to munch on and I also got a house lemonade. \u00a0I have to say that the house lemonade was quite different. \u00a0Never had lemonade with ginger ale. \u00a0Pretty good. \u00a0As for the French Fries....It's one of the best I've had. \u00a0I like shoestring fries! \u00a0These fries are fried to perfection.... not soggy with the right amount of crunch. \u00a0The smoky tomato ketchup that it came with was ohhhh soooo yummy. \u00a0Best ketchup ever! \u00a0Before we were able to finish our French Fries, the hostess came and told us that they has our table set. \u00a0yay.  After we go to our table, our server came to greet us and took our order.  I started out with the French Onion Soup Gratinee. \u00a0I must say that this is the second best French Onion Soup I've had (first place goes to a restaurant in Las Vegas). \u00a0This soup has the right amount of spice and the cheese was very tasty and toasted.  My friend had the Beef Tartare and it wasn't as tasty as he like, but overall it was still pretty yummy.  For our entrees, I ordered the Coq Au Vin. \u00a0The dish smelled really good when they set it in front of me. \u00a0The chicken in this dish was very tender and juicy. \u00a0 The meat literately falls off the bone. \u00a0I would of loved this dish if the chef wasn't so salt happy. \u00a0After about 3 bites, the saltiness really kicks in. \u00a0This dish is way salty.  My friend ordered the Liberty Duck Confit. \u00a0The duck meat was very tender and juicy as well. \u00a0It was very tasty, but again the chef was salt happy. \u00a0This dish was also way salty. \u00a0  We ended the meal with Apple Pie Panna Cotta. \u00a0This is a pretty delicious dessert and a good way to end our dinner. \u00a0To my surprise, the dessert wasn't that sweet, which is how my friend and I liked it. \u00a0  This place would of gotten better ratings if the food wasn't way salty. \u00a0Best dish of the night was the French Fries...",

    "review_text": "Wow, I was completely blown away by this place!! I would rank Absinthe as one of my top three food experiences in the city. The service wasn't great -- the hostess had a worst case of the bitch-face that I've witnessed in a while, our waitress was friendly but absentee and the busboys were ill trained, but the food, wow, the food was fantastic!!  To start things off, Absinthe lived up to its name with an expansive list of creative cocktails. I had the Galapagos, which consisted of kaffir-lime leaf muddled in pepper syrup, Barsol Pisco, lemon-lime and grapefruit juices. I was expecting a bit more lime leaf, which has an extremely distinctive flavor, but the drink was very yummy nevertheless. The boyfriend had a Manhattan and thoroughly enjoyed his beverage. The night was off to a racing start.  The restaurant has a seasonal menu with large plates, small shared plates and eclectic cheeses and raw bar. We decided to play it safe and share the beef tartare, the sous vide pork loin and the burger with gruyere.  The beef tartare, we both agreed, was bar none, the best that we've had the pleasure to enjoy. If you're a fan of steak tartare, this is a must order. Heck, even if you're a bit freaked out by the idea of raw beef topped off by a raw quail egg, this will make you into a believer. The preparation was simple -- violet mustard, green apple, red onion, cornichons and the quail egg yoke, and the flavors welded together in the most wondrous fashion. The beef, I'm guessing, did not go through a meat grinder and was painstakingly chopped by hand. The result was truly worth the effort because it simply melted in your mouth. It was super fresh and didn't have any raw taste to it at all. I can wax poetic about this dish for paragraphs and paragraphs, but you get the idea. Order it!!  Not long after we polished off the tartare and sat starry eyed, still trying to savor the last bits of flavor on our tongues, our entrees arrived on the table. I took stab at the burger while Orin dug into the pork. The burger was juicy and the beef tasted fresh and of obvious high quality. The accompaniments were simple, just lettuce, tomato and onion, between a brioche bun. I would say this was the second best burger that I've had, right behind Gamine. The fries were skinny and crispy. Burger and fries, you can't go wrong.  The pork loin was absolutely fabulous. Even though the meat was sous vide, the chef put it under the boiler to crisp up the skin because it was crunchy. Pork belly is basically a less threatening way to describe bacon, but the meat was slow cooked to perfection and did not taste fatty at all. The carrot puree and the black truffle jus accentuated the sweetness of the pork. All in all, I would say 9 out of 10.   In a quest to exercise caloric austerity, we skipped dessert, not that I'm complaining because we were stuffed to the brim. I saw the table next to us ordered a custardy-looking concoction and they thoroughly licked the jar so I'm assuming it was good. I was so happy to find a restaurant with such a high level of food across the board because our last few date night restaurants were a bit disappointing. Absinthe is well worth the price and a true SF gem. I will definitely be back!!",

After putting in my name with the hostess, I anticipated a 30 minute wait but was quickly surprised when 5 minutes passed and we got our table. The vibe is very french Bistro- small high top tables, loud bustling feel. Their breakfast cocktail list is as long as most places regular lists- I opted for the bloody mary but they had various mimosas that looked delicious too.  Was a bit surprised that the brunch menu was a little underwhelming- at least compared to their dinner options. Not much for someone watching their weight (I have to squeeze into a wedding dress in less than 45 days!!) so I went for standard breakfast fare: eggs &amp; sausage. Had that not been an issue, I would have gone for the french toast.. yumm.  Service was okay, the front of the house was friendly and welcoming. Will be back for cocktails again soon.",

An altogether solid place for a meal in SF -- kind of like that go-to corner restaurant in that make believe, romanticized, \"Midnight in Paris\" world you imagine you'd love to live in.  Pluses: * The snacks. I can't even explain in words how freakishly amazing the Soft Garlic Pretzels are, and the Spicy Fried Chickpeas are addictive.  * The portion size is big. Not just big-for-a-French-restaurant big, but actually large enough to be filling for an average eater. I couldn't even finish my delish Market Vegetable Plate. * Their desserts are really spectacular, if you are into unusual flavors. The Chocolate Pine Nut Mousse with fig marmalade, bay leaf ice cream, and sherry vinegar caramel was unbelievable. Each flavor on its own was amazing, but combining the flavors in different ways for each bite made for a really memorable dessert experience. * Attentive, but unpretentious, service. Our server was friendly and down to earth, but still knowledgeable and professional in that way you expect from a higher end restaurant.  Minuses: * Busy, which makes it slightly cramped and a tad noisy. But, the atmosphere is really part of the fun. * Limited vegetarian options, which I've found it kind of normal for a French restaurant. But, what they do have is perfection.  Absinthe was my go-to restaurant, for both brunch and dinner, for a couple years, but I eventually got bored with the food. This was my first visit since Adam Keough took over as Executive Chef, and the menu once again pulled me in. I'll definitely be back more often, and I recommend it for anyone looking for great food, or just snacks and a cocktail.",

    "review_text": "Shocked I haven't written a review for Absinthe before. When I lived in SF from 2007-2008, I came many times with a friend who lived in Hayes Valley. Absinthe is the kind of place you go when you want to feel a little bit special; when you don't want to feel like an animal at the trough just filling up because you have to. It's an experience, and you'll pay for that experience, so come to terms with that up front.  Step off of the busy main street of Hayes and you're in a classic French bistro. It's a little darker, cooler (or warmer depending on the season), and calmer than where you just came from. The waitstaff is top notch. Starched aprons, genuine smiles, and real manners. The menu is fairly sparse -- which I love because I don't want to spend my whole night deciding -- and everything is fantastic. Simply decide you're in the mood for.   There are always specials but the regular items are great too. I've come for dinner and lunch and had the same experience of feeling taken care of and having a special meal. It's quality time with family and friends which is more important to me than anything. The huge wood bar with mirror and glasses behind is so tantalizing, you'll want a cocktail, and the desserts are incredible. So don't come when you're in a rush. Settle in and let yourself enjoy Absinthe.",

My friends and I took part in the annual San Francisco Bay to Breakers event and wanted to enjoy a delicious brunch together and relax after the race. Our reservations were for 11: 00 am but we were stuck on Muni for over an hour trying to make it to the restaurant. We called the restaurant and asked for them to hold our reservation anticipating that we would only be 15-30 minutes late. Well, when we showed up over an hour late, our reservation was still held and we were seated right away. Kudos!!   We were all super hungry and all of the entrees being served to the tables next to us looked absolutely delicious. We started off with fries, mimosas, and orange juice. The fries were really thin, the size of onion strings and were served with three different sauces: hot mustard, vinegar, and a yummy ketchup mayonnaise type sauce. We scarfed those down super quick, but not so quick that we were not able to enjoy their delicate deliciousness. The orange juice was fresh squeezed (double kudos) and the mimosas were good.   Two of us ordered the wild mushroom omelet, which was served with fried potatoes. Both friends really liked the omelets and the potatoes and were hardly able to finish their meals as the portions were so big (triple kudos). I ordered the crab salad sandwich and my other friend ordered the banana-blueberry souffle pancakes.   My crab salad sandwich was none like I had before. The sandwich was served in a soft baguette with cheese, fresh tomatoes and a light citrus sauce, which is atypical of a crab sandwich, which is usually grilled. The sandwich was a nice surprise because it was so light and flavorful! Perfect for the hot weather. The crab meat was mixed with tiny cubes of different colored bell peppers, which made the sandwich festive. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal!   My friend loved her souffle pancakes too!!   We all gave Absinthe a grade A and would definitely come back again to eat.",

The food and drinks are phenomenal and would give a strong five-star for the culinary experience. \u00a0Dining experience was less strong on the busy Saturday evening, with an overworked bar and forgetful service.

Also got delicious warm olives.   I was happy to find someone else who liked super sweet wine, so we had a bottle of reasonably priced Gewurtraminer, yumm. We started with spicy fried chickpeas, which were delicious snacks. She had the mushroom and chestnut soup, very flavorful. The warm brussel sprouts with celery root puree and cippiolini onions were meaty and filling, with fried bacon pieces. I did not realize my friend was a vegatarian, though on the more liberal end of non-meat eaters... She wanted the cornbread stuffed chicken (without the chicken), and the pan-seared scallop with mushrooms (without the scallops), so we split two entrees, with the balance of the protein coming to me. Chicken was good, scallops were great. \u00a0I think I won in this deal...  We went with the chocolate pot de creme, super rich and delicious and totally worth it. Went well with the glass of Grand Marnier, which was discussed and never ordered, but came anyway (back to the forgetful service remark). Oh well.  All in $110 per person...",

While the soup was out-of-this-world rich and delectable, the beef tartare was a mildly underseasoned and underwhelming appetizer. I think the fruit may have detracted taste from the quality of the beef, but I digress as my culinary knowledge is mediocre at best.  Onwards! To the entrees where we had the Coq Au Vin and the Duck Breast. The Coq Au Vin, in all its buttery glory, had a sultry and velvety Burgundy sauce that seduced my taste buds on its way down. The chicken was tender and moist, the veggies were slightly undercooked, and the crostinis on the side were drenched in butter (pro for me, con for the gf). On the other side of the table, the Duck Breast came in two premium cuts cooked perfectly and with crisped skin wonderfully accented by the coffee crust. The bed of wild rice hash w/ almonds contrasted textures in a delightful way and the spinach was a convenient way to get more fiber into my day's intake. :)  With stomachs bursting yet satisfied and Lion King tickets burning a hole in my pocket, we happily made our way over the Orpheum to conclude date night.",

A group of friends and I came here for a Sunday brunch and had a great experience.  I found the brunch menu to be rather limited (only 3 egg dishes?) but every dish we ordered was delicious. The Grilled Cheese (I added Bacon) was one of the best I've had before. The Open-Face Leg of Lamb Sandwich was a very creative twist on your average Eggs Benedict. The Pork Enchilada was rather disappointing, which I probably should have expected ordering Mexican food at a French restaurant.   The service was just alright for me, our waitress was not very friendly",

The intimate space was perfect for the gathering of family and friends, with beautiful and classy decor, great food, and excellent service.  The staff brought out an endless supply of delicious Oysters, Crab Cakes, and bite-size Croque Monsieur sandwiches. The bartender also mixed some nice cocktails... which were even nicer in the wedding reception setting, when you didn't have to pay whatever this place normally charges.  Our three course dinner was great as well... I went with the Root Vegetable Soup, Atlantic Char, and Chocolate Pot. All delicious and it tasted great when washed down by the Wine we had brought in for the reception, something that the restaurant kindly accommodated us for. Overall, a very nice experience at a beautiful private room nestled down the street from the popular main bar. I would come back to eat and drink in the main dining room for sure!",

I glanced over the menu and decided to get some food afterall.  We got the ABSINTHE HAMBURGER: Storm Hill Angus beef, a\u00efoli, baby lettuces, red onion, house-made pickles, french fries and SOFT GARLIC PRETZELS: Vermont cheddar mornay  Burger-bun was over charred, meat was tender but under seasoned, overall a modest burger but nothing to rave about  Pretzels-the best I have ever had! Super soft yet yield a great bite, well seasoned and that sauce is on crack!   For drinks, we ordered a variety to share which included Ginger Rogers, Galapagos, Citron Lemonade, Havana and 21 Hayes)  Ginger Rogers was by far my favorite. The rest were strong and unique but I didn't understand what all the fuss was about their drinks. The balance was lacking and flavors weren't appealing.

    "review_text": "Absinthe originated in Switzerland. However, it is better known for its popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century France, particularly among Parisian artists and writers. Due in part to its association with bohemian culture, absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists. Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Vincent van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, and Aleister Crowley were all notorious \"bad men\" of that day who were (or were thought to be) devotees of the Green Fairy.  Absinthe was portrayed as a dangerously addictive, psychoactive drug. The chemical thujone, present in small quantities, was blamed for its alleged harmful effects. By 1915 absinthe had been banned in most European nations and the United States. Although absinthe was vilified,[2] no evidence has shown it to be any more dangerous than ordinary liquor. Its psychoactive properties, apart from those of ethanol, have been much exaggerated.  A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, when countries in the European Union began to reauthorize its manufacture and sale. As of February 2008, nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries, most notably France, Switzerland, Spain, and the Czech Republic.[3]  (experpt from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAbsinthe&amp;s=9b9f320d15ac8916a6fef2bd26cc05e02a28d412ffbd9df12b22fd380c628171\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab\u2026</a>)  Absinthe the restaurant/bar was a nice place to be. Hip, French culture posters adorn the the dimly lit, inviting interior. Having never had Absinthe, if there ever was an opportunity, now was the time. It turned into quite a production, three glass containers, a straddled, perforated cheese wedge thing across the main glass, a sugar cube hovering above that mysterious green liquid.  Our friendly server then explained how you are supposed to consume it, drizzling the water across the sugar till it dissolves. The drink itself was strong, but you can dilute to taste, be careful tho, too much and it turns to a white, ugly mess (as opposed to a sexy green)  The crowd was cool, younger people and some older with money. It was not too pretentious. Overall a good place if you happen to be in that area.",

We got the garlic soft pretzels, coq au vin, duck breast, baked mac &amp; cheese, and charred cauliflower. Everything was delicious. My absolute favorite though was the charred cauliflower!

Note: Seating for those waiting is NONEXISTENT or if there was any, awkward.   The bartender was difficult to flag down and when did we ordered two drinks: The Galapagos (supposed to be one of their famous cocktails--something top 100 must eats in SF) and their perfect pear. *phew* Their drinks were STIFF. I think one of those could knock a light weight out with one sip. Later on, I ordered a Blood and Sand which was alcohol-taste free, but boy did I feel the pangs of its wrath the next morning. Not cool.   When we were seated, my friends tried the famous $12 dollar hot dog and were extremely disappointed. According to them, it \"bland\". I stuck with their shoe string fries and didn't think they were bad, but they \u00a0definitely aren't as good as Wine Merchant's white truffle parmeasan fries. \u00a0  I left spending quite a bit and wondering if maybe we should have stayed at Hotel Biron instead; at least they have decent snacks.",

    "review_text": "My wife ate here four years ago. Her review can be best summarized thusly: \"Sucked.\"  So I never really made the effort to try this place. However, like many in SF, I read Bauer pretty religiously, and he mentioned not too long ago that there had been a chef change, and this change was definitely for the better. So when one of my best buds from SoCal came up to visit, I decided to give this place a shot. My wife demurred, saying she never wished to eat here again - that's how bad of an impression it left on her.  My experience here was the total opposite of hers. It is, likely, a result of the chef change, but the food was fresh and delicious here.  I love beef tartare with all of my heart, and anytime I see it on a menu I have to try it, so we went with that, along with the hamachi crudo, as our appetizers. The crudo was very good, especially with the blood orange on it. I always appreciate citrus, and the flavors blended perfectly here. The tartare was good, but perhaps not as good as I wanted it to be.  For mains, my bud ordered the lamb T-bone, which disappeared not long after the waiter put it down. I did manage to get a taste of it before it was devoured by my friend, and it was perfectly done. My own main was \u00a0the skirt steak, one of my favorite cuts, and the skirt here didn't disappoint.   For drinks, my friend got an overpriced and underwhelming glass of absinthe, but the sazerac he ordered later more than made up for that. I also had that sazerac, as well as a mujer verde. Both were pretty awesome, to me.  The one major ding, other than the tartare, was the service. It wasn't bad per se, but the waiter was just kind of a douche. He was kind of inattentive, and also seemed personally hurt that we didn't order any of the specials that he theatrically described to us.  I did try to convince my wife to give it another chance, but she's since become a vegetarian...so I doubt she'd like it.",

    "review_text": "My wife and I have been to Absinthe many times over the years, usually before or after a San Francisco Symphony concert. It's always been really good, although hard to get a table on an event night. We were lucky last Saturday night when a 6:15 slot freed up on OpenTable in late afternoon and I grabbed it. There seems to be a lot of disagreement about whether the place is on the rise or the decline, but this was the best meal we've ever had there.  I had the shellfish stew and it was terrific - a mix of mussels and clams plus a jumbo prawn in a rich broth with red bell peppers. My wife had the butternut squash soup, and while the taste I had seemed a bit sweet she said that the swirled-in mint cream offset that sweetness nicely. She almost always orders coq au vin there, and she said that it was as good as ever and maybe better. I tried a small piece and it may have been the most tender chicken I've ever had.  I ordered the Liberty Farms duck, and it turned out to be delicious. The coffee crust worked well, the huckleberry sauce had just the right touch of sweetness, and the \"wild rice hash\" was the perfect complement. Of top of that, the two slices of duck were thick; each one could have easily been cut in half and been a full portion. I ended up taking half of my entree home to enjoy the next day. We were too full and too rushed for dessert, but the coffee and espresso were outstanding.  Absinthe appears to have some sort of team service set up; most of the dishes were delivered by other servers but then the server who took our order swung by quickly to make sure that all was OK. I still had my stew dish at my place when one of the servers headed toward us with our entrees; she immediately backed off and asked another server to clear our table. Many restaurants would dump the entrees on the table and then worry about making room.  Finally, as one would expect for a restaurant in the Civic Center area, after we let our server know that we had an 8pm Symphony concert she ensured that we made it with some time to spare. Yes, the place is crowded and noisy on an event night, but excellent food and service are more important to me. I'm eager to go back and try more of the menu, but on the basis of this fine dinner and with a lot of fond memories of past meals, five stars is entirely appropriate.",

I'm slowly making my way across the French restaurants in the City and Absinthe has been on this list for a while.   It was a Tuesday night, so we had no problem getting a table at 6pm, although there were a lot of people in there already as I think they do a good business with the pre-theater crowd. My friend got stuck in traffic coming up from the south bay, so i was seated for maybe 30 or 40 minutes at the table before she arrived, but service was great from the start. They have a great drink selection, I really enjoyed mine that was made with muddled cucumber, but interestingly, there was no visual sign of cucumber in it.  I started with the pretzels, which are really good. I found the sauce a bit thin, but it was still delicious. The menu is interesting and while normally i wouldn't have any trouble finding any entree to order at a French place, I felt that a lot of what they had included accompaniments that weren't to my preference. So for example, I love duck confit, but this was served over pasta with raisins and mushrooms. So I ended up ordering the corn soup and the mussels/clams appetizer. I really liked both of them, but the mussels dish was definitely on the salty side, or it may have been the crostinis that came with it that left me drinking 5 glasses of water. My friend got the pork tenderloin which I tasted and was really good - not the least bit dry, much more the texture of a steak. The bread they served was good and no desserts jumped out at us. Service was good all along, until the end. it seemed like we were done for a while before our waiter came back to check on us/bring the check.  Overall, I liked the food, but wish they had more traditionally-prepared dishes and definitely a chocolate souffle or something similar for dessert!",

We had some late night bites-- and split a salad, which the waiter split into 2 plate AND added an extra fried egg on the second salad - which was a very cool gesture. \u00a0While the service was a bit slow, the food was spot-on as were the cocktails. \u00a0Definitely like this place for a late night meal/cocktails or brunch.",

I had heard so much about it that I was willing to wait. Once we came back 45 minutes later, our table was still not ready but luckily 2 seats opened up at the Bar. I love eating at the Bar anyways.   We started off with these amazing deviled eggs that were made with smoked fish...with a tiny dollop of caviar....OMG were they good.   My brother had this amazing open faced breakfast sandwich with a fried duck egg, andouille sausage, raclette (cheese) on top of brioche and I had the Duck Hash with 2 Poached Eggs with a side of ever so fresh arugula.   I have to say this was one of the better brunch's I've ever had, even better than some of the places I have been in Beantown.",

    "review_text": "Dropped in here with a friend after a concert at the nearby Davies Symphony Hall; Absinthe has a nice decor as well as a very extensive alcohol menu (nearly 75 pages!) Since I had eaten dinner already, I ended up ordering the spicy fried garbanzo beans ($4); the portion size was pretty small, and they were a little bit overly salty, but they were crispy and still flavorful. I also opted for sparkling apple cider, which was crisp and refreshing. For dessert, my friend and I split an order of their cheesecake - this was perhaps one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had. Unlike the typical bakery or grocery store cheesecake that's exploding with sugar, this cheesecake had much more of a cheese feel to it (I think it was goat's cheese?), and was topped with blueberries and crumbles. It was also a little pricey ($10 for a small piece) but was worth it!  Giving Absinthe four stars here for the wonderful dessert, drink, and decor, but can't really comment on the food outside my order of the fried garbanzo beans.",

We were, in short, impressed. Nothing we drank wasn't the utmost in deliciousness, and nothing we ate wasn't equally tasty.  Although I saved our receipt by which to remember the occasion, I don't remember remember exactly what my companions had. As for me, I had the Ginger Rogers cocktail, which was cool, refreshing and gin-riffic. Along with that, I had some delicious french onion soup gratinee and a mushroom risotto (no longer on the menu). All delicious. All the time.  Not to mention, the service was great. Our waiter was very classy and fleet of foot. He was very knowledgeable about the cheese selections and had some excellent recommendations for the cheese plate we ordered as an appetizer.",

For my entree I ordered the 7 oz Grilled Black Angus Bistro Filet with sour cream &amp; leek whipped potatoes.

It's a popular choice with theatre go-ers so book early if you want a nice experience before you head to the Opera House or Music Hall. \u00a0But they pace your dinner well so that you finish in good time. The menu is somewhat limited, but we had no trouble finding delicious things to order. I can highly recommend the steak and the lamb shank. Both were perfectly seasoned and cooked. H enjoyed the oysters and I the ravioli. \u00a0The drinks were also good and the only disappointment was the dessert menu, as we couldn't find anything appealing on it!

The bartender was pretty impressive with his ability to handle the sheer volume of complicated drinks and do so without ruffling even slightly at the sometimes bullish crowd.   Our server seemed a little irritated that we had drinks when we came to the table and the service was a little slow on her end, but not so much that it ruined the experience. We felt a little pressured by her to order drinks from her as well, and we weren't interested.    The food impressed me; I might go so far as to say that the Absinthe burger (with smoked gouda and caramelized onions) might very well be the best burger I've ever had. We also had the bistro filet which couldn't compare to the burger (it needed more flavor), but it wasn't bad; the roasted garlic-whipped potatoes and asparagus that it came with were delicious.   I'll put this on the list of places I look forward to returning to on my next trip to San Francisco.",

Also of note is that it is so hard to find an interesting desert in SF. \u00a0Every French restuarant has a pot de creme, a creme brulee, etc. \u00a0They actually had two desserts that were interesting ... the one I had was a butternut squash cake which was absolutely amazing, and different. \u00a0The madiera pairing with this was perfect ....",

    "review_text": "This is a very nice place that I could imagine would be a hip spot to take a date.  Instead, I went with my wife after we were stuffed beyond belief from dinner and were just trying to kill time before a movie at the nearby AMC Van Ness. So what else is there to do but eat?  I read about the soft garlic pretzels on 7x7, so i figured we should stop by here to try them.  So as not to look poor/weird, I decided we should order something more than just the pretzels, so we also got the spicy fried chick peas.  The chick peas were very tasty, though once they cool off they get a little too chewy and not very pleasant to eat (I guess that is true with most fried food, but the difference here is probably that these aren't tasty enough like most fried foods that make you want to wolf them down immediately before they get a chance to cool off).  The soft garlic pretzels were indeed worth the walk from the theater and were very delicious. They were nice and hot, slightly crispy on the outside and very soft and chewy throughout. They came with some kind of cheesy dipping sauce that was also addictive and delicious. To give you an idea of how good they are, whenever there is an odd number of items in a dish, I always make polite to pretend to offer the extra one to my wife and she always concedes it to me, which is one of the things I love most about her. However, when I pretended to offer her the 5 and last pretzel here, she gladly accepted the offer.  Service was very nice and polite too, which was surprising since all we ordered was two snacks and a soda.  My only beef is that it was a little pricey for 5 little bites of pretzels. Otherwise, it was a very nice place that I wouldn't mind coming back for to try their main menu of food.",

That's ok because we waited at the bar, and had some cocktails, I had a Bloody Mary which was delicious.  When we were seated our waiter quickly brought water and took our order immediately.  We first ordered 15 oysters.... Which were so amazing that we ordered another 15!!! The soft garlic pretzels w/ the dipping cheddar sauce was amazing that we too ordered another one. I don't think I've ever had a better pretzel. The French fries with Parmesan aioli was crispy, shoestring fries which are my favorite. The baked Mac and cheese was creamy yet crispy on the top. The pork meatballs were tiny and a bit spicy but I can handle the heat. We also had a cheese plate with the frommage, cheddar, and blythindale... I'm a fan of soft cheese because I like to spread it on my bread... Seriously once you take a bite, your eyes will roll back into your head. To end the meal, we had coffee and desserts. Us four shared the passion fruit mango mousse w/ carrot cake and the deconstructed Napoleon... Amazing.. Our waiters regularly filled our cups w/ water every time it was low..

The adorable Hayes Valley eatery proved to be the perfect pick for our post theater meal. The interior was romantic and cozy, with warm colors and soft yellow lighting. Plush booths and small tables encourage you to sit back, relax, and enjoy your meal.  Started the night right with the massive drink menu. Page upon page of the finest liquors, spirits, cocktails, and wine. SO much to choose from! Curiosity killed the cocktail question - we had to order Absinthe for the table. Green fairy or not - this sweet liquorice liquor is something worth trying!  Appetizers included cracked crab, french fries with 3 sauces, and house made bread. All were delightful and served in perfect portion size.  Second was the Fris\u00e9e, baby leeks vinaigrette, house-smoked bacon, fried duck egg, fines herbs, and caviar salad. Prepare to be surprised by this salad - the dressing creates a dish that should not be missed!  For the main course, I ordered the Pan seared local halibut, sunchoke pur\u00e9e, pea leaves, baby carrots, sugar snap peas, sorrel &amp; lemon thyme fumet. It was perfectly cooked and well combined with it's accompaniments. My boyfriend had the grilled whole trout, garbanzo beans, salametto piccante, wilted chard, grilled lemon, herb oil. It was a tasty trout, but definitely not for a dainty diner.... the fish's face was a big part of this plate!  By far the best entree was my mother's order, the Slow cooked pork confit, yellow corn, house made bacon, fava beans, mint, sweet corn sauce. Tender and tasty - it was the most mouthwatering moment of the meal.  There is only one way to end a savory Sunday supper...... by topping it off with something sweet! The Scharffen Berger chocolate Pot de cr\u00e8me is irresistible - a thick, creamy, chocolate bowl of pure bliss. \u00a0  Service was a huge highlight of the night. The attentive, thoughtful, and knowledgeable staff helped us enjoy every minute of the meal. All of our courses were well timed - we never felt rushed and were able to enjoy each delightful bite. So happy I finally found out what all the \"fairy\" fuss was about - Absinthe Restaurant and Bar is a San Francisco treat!!",

Thank you for another wonderful meal, oh highly priced city that I dream of affording some day....",

My pocketbook prevents me from coming here as often as I'd like to, because when I come here I splurge quite heavily on the meal, drinks, dessert and of course the cheese plate. The drinks here are seriously some of the best in the city, especially if you have a predilection toward classic cocktails and variations thereof. I've only come here for dinner (before a movie or a concert or another bar) and so far every meal has made my eyes roll so far back they came up the bottom. I love this place...",

I have been to Absinthe three times and it has never disappointed. I have ordered drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts and each time, everything has been wonderful. Flavors were all there, and the food was cooked perfectly.  On my recent visit, we had the spicy fried chickpeas, lamb kefta skewers, and country pate plate to share as appetizers. I had the local sole as my entree, and the other two in my group had the pork rib eye chop and one of the steak dishes. We also shared the ice cream and sorbet selection as a dessert. As I said before, everything was great. I can't even choose one thing to recommend.   The drinks are mixed well. Service is awesome. They don't do that miniscule portioning like some restaurants in the same price scale do. Really, Absinthe can do no wrong.",

The cocktail list sounded AMAZING and I was sad I didn't look at it before I ordered my mimosa. I had originally planned on eating brunchy type food, however, earlier that morning I ran quite a long distance and for some very odd reason my body was craving meat. \u00a0Naturally, I went with the hamburger. \u00a0I added gorgonzola to it which was quite a good choice. \u00a0I was semi disappointed because all that came with it was the hamburger no sides. But the hamburger was very good! Luckily we ordered fries....which were super yummy. \u00a0They were very thin and crunchy. \u00a0Other people at the table ordered an omelette and sandwiches which they said were good. \u00a0  The service was par. \u00a0Nothing spectacular but no complaints. \u00a0Everything came pretty quick from the kitchen and it was all as ordered.   Overall, I would definitely come back to try dinner...I hear that the scallops are to die for!",

They have a wonderful new chief who has great skills.  The ambiance as always is great: Busy hustle bustle fun. Not too loud not too crazy.  Great wine and cocktail list....come on any restaurant named after that crazy absinthe (and I do mean crazy) has to have great cocktails. Wine list really caters to people that dont want to blow their cash on some crazy priced bottle...prices were pretty reasonable.  Food was really good too. Great fried chick peas, great heart of romaine and very nice coq a vine ( they use mary's chicken which is my fav). Deserts were so so in my opinion.  Service is good fast and efficient.

If you don't want to have to wait in line outside for 60+min, and you want to have a confirmed reservation for brunch on a weekend day, then come here.  The food was just alright, I have definitely had better, but I have also had to wait in line at these other places (except for foreign cinema, great food and they take reservatons)  We order the french onion soup to start, I really dont know what all the hype is about, yes the soup was good, but way too much cheese for my taste, then again i've never had french onion soup prepared that way so maybe thats just the way it is  steer clear of the duck, my friend got the duck confit and I got the brunch roast (which was..you guessed it, smoked DUCK breast with steamed lentils and swiss chard). The confit was a bit dry, it was like eggs benedict with duck. my smoked duck was a bit better, but it definitely wasnt typical brunch fare and still a bit on the chewy and dry side (just a bit though)  the chocolate pot de creme, as you have probably seen from the rest the yelpers, was almost a home run, it was good, chocolately, light, sweet, yummy, but its akin to chocolate mousse you could find at any asian bakery (sorry to be blunt)  the bloody mary olives had pits in them, i have never had them like that in my bloody marys, and its not a good idea, the absinthe sangria was good, and perhaps this place deserve (and probably received) its rave reviews for their bar menu more so than they deserve it for their brunch, i cant comment on the dinner menu  there's a reason why this place takes walk-in's so readily for weekend brunch, there just isnt enough demand for this place, and now i know why",

We also immediately spotted the prices. A plate of 3 cheeses for $35 and a regular drink $12.

    "review_text": "This is hands down, my new favorite restaurant in SF! Every dish at Absinthe was better than the last and trust me, we tried a bit of everything. Not one person in our group was disappointed with anything they ordered. Here's a quick recap of our meal: Spicy fried chickpeas- delicious little snack to munch on while you wait Soft garlic pretzels- OMG, these were AMAZING. We wanted more, more, more! Maybe order 1 order per person. As good as the chickpeas were, the pretzels blew them out of the water! Potato mushroom leek soup- wonderful soup, very creamy and full of flavor. The large is plenty to share if you intend to pig out like we did. Selection of 3 cheeses- Had the Humboldt Fog, Mt Tam and Fromage de Meaux all 3 of which were wonderful. Again, this is probably ideal to share between at least 3-4 people. We were 3 and were feeling full before our entrees arrived Potato-Crusted Arctic Char- I absolutely loved this dish. thin slices of potato were carefully laid across the top of the Char and baked(?), it tasted like a delicious hash brown on top of fish. I know that might sound weird but it was amazing! I liked that it was served with what was basically a salad which kept the dish from being too heavy Pork Osso Bucco &amp; Coq Au Vin- didn't try either of these though my friends ordered and loved both of these dishes. None of us were able to finish our meals, not for lack of trying but because we needed a tiny bit of room for dessert (it's worth it!) Meyer Lemon Tart- Very lemony, if that's your thing you'll love this dessert, I liked it but I'm not a huge fan of lemon desserts so I didn't eat too much of this one. The rest of the group managed to put it away Vanilla Cheesecake- Delicious, and just the right size. I was half expecting a fat slice a la Cheesecake Factory and was pleasantly surprised to receive the perfect, reduced guilt sized mini cheesecake. The cilantro doesn't add much to this dish but the macadamia nuts on top are amazing. I would try asking for extra macadamia nuts if they allow it to ensure there are some in every bite. Winter Squash Cake- Best dessert by far. I loved everything about the winter squash cake but the brown butter ice cream really holds it all together so be sure to proportion your bites just so :)  Can't wait to come back!!",

The food was incredible and so were the drinks (well, ok, except for Death in the Afternoon, that shit was TERRIBLE). When we jokingly told the waitress that we hated the drink (which, of course, was entirely my boyfriend's fault) she immediately brought us a drink menu and gave us great recommendations on better drinks (those gays love the fruity ones). \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Our waitress' name was Kimberly. She was amazing. Seriously, if you go to Absinthe, ask to be seated in her section. And tip big, she deserves it.

This was my third time at Absinthe and it was just as superb as the last two times.

    "review_text": "So my bestfriend took his girlfriend here for some drinks on her 21st bday. I have always heard positive things about this place and was looking forward to seeing what this place had to offer. Unfortunately it offers nothing enjoyable. Since there was a larger group of us and we just wanted some drinks and simple fare we made a reservation instead of showing up and taking over the bar.  We arrived and were seated quickly. As soon as our waiter greeted us and found out we just wanted drinks and maybe some light food he sighed in disapproval. Wonderful. After going over their extensive spirit list I found the scotch page. First I ordered a round of Macallan 12 year for my best friend, another mate and I. 10 minutes he comes back and says they're out. No biggie, its a great scotch and these things happen. I then go for the glenmorangie original. More time passes and once again he tells me they are out. Dafuq is this? So I end up ordering a younger scotch and just leave it at that. He brings the girls drinks which I didn't pay much attention to however they claimed that none were remarkable.   The bday girl orders some cheese and olives and I ended up ordering their burger.So after about an hour of of being at the table and having my scotch I get my burger, my horribly expensive, dinkey, dry burger that was ordered medium rare. It wasn't bad, there was just no flavour. I didn't send it back because our wonderful shiney bald headed waiter looked like he wanted to spit in my food because of his disdain for possibly not getting a big tip.   The best part of my meal was their fries...o I'm sorry, pomme frittes. I forgot I had to be pretentious for a bit. Very well cooked, crispey outside and nice and cooked on the inside. It was the only thing that saved my meal.  So the bill comes and the total is $180. We leave a generous $35 tip and leave. Before I do I use the restroom and on the way I walk by him and another employee and he's bitching about the paultry tip we gave him. Needless to say there are many thing I could have done at this point, told him to @#$% off, complained to the manager, asked to see the money that we left and taken the tip back. No, I consider myself a gentleman and just walked out and decided that I would rather spend my money somewhere else in the future. There are many good eateries in the area and I am not missing out on anything by never going to Absinthe again. Cheers.",

This restaurant happened to be right across the inn we were staying at during our get away in the city. He's eaten here before and wanted to try it out again. So we stepped in around 9pm and did not have to wait too long to be seated.   We were seated by the bar, which is probably due to our lack of reservation. The view was quite interesting. Seeing a bunch of drunk people on dates was a sight to see. \u00a0Some were nervous, some were doing well but there was one couple making out like crazy. It was entertaining until it became really crude. They were to the point that even I was even grossed out - let's just say my tolerance level is high. Heck, I didn't even bat an eyelash to Two Girls, One Cup.   The waitress didn't really care for us and ignored us most of the time. She even made me feel like I was bothering her the whole time. I'm not very demanding, so I was really surprised by her demeanor. Every time we said thanks, she just looked away. She even rolled her eyes at one point when we asked for our drinks that she forgot to give us. The service was lacking and made the whole experience mediocre rather than spectacular. There was a lot of attitude for no reason, whatsoever.   The food was amazing. It was their saving grace. I ordered the Waygu steak. My boyfriend gave me the go ahead to order mushrooms; I interpreted his permission as to order black truffles. He meant regular mushrooms but he didn't mind that I went all out. The steak was simply mouth watering and the creme fraiche mash potatoes completed it so well. The veggies were amazing and cooked to perfection, all the while the fried onions and black truffle added an additional level of flavor and texture. It was really delicious. We ordered a pot de creme-like chocolate dessert and we were fighting each other for the last bite.   The food is amazing and I will definitely come back for the food and hope for better service.",

It was very busy and there was only one bartender who handled all of the bar and all the drinks for the restaurant and that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
