Three of us stopped in and decided to share two of their beer flights. At a little north of $10 the sampler of 4 beers was a little on the expensive side but not by too much.  To go along with our beer, we ordered some of their seasoned pretzels and garlic fries. The fries were hardly garlic and barely fried. It was a very small plate (about the number you get in a small order at McDonalds). They were clearly frozen fries that were way under cooked and dusted with a tiny bit of garlic.  They fries were bad enough but then the pretzels came. Imagine a 10oz tumbler filled with a handful of stick pretzels sprinkled with seasoned salt. A hand full of pretzels for $3.50. Total rip off.  The beer was good enough but the snacks wrecked our visit. I won't be back.",

We weren't hungry at all as we had eaten less than an hour ago, but wandered in here with the hopes of doing a tasting of some beer from some local \u00a0Cali breweries. \u00a0So my review is all about the beer.   The setup of Beer39 is pretty cool, very open and pretty cool for people watching. \u00a0 The interior is sleek and the bar is very comfortable.   And that seems to be about the best of what I experienced.   I was underwhelmed.   The beer selection wasn't that exciting at all and those tending to the bar weren't very helpful in guiding us to some of the most popular California beers on the menu. (I had mentioned we were from Seattle and were beer enthusiasts and were looking to try some great Cali beers.. and the bartender just kind of looked at me with a blank stare..)   I guess I shouldn't have had my hopes up for a bar that was in the midst of a tourist trap.   We selected our beers for our tasting (and a cider as the other choices were very boring). \u00a0The bartender slapped them down in front of us and went down the line telling us what they were. As soon as he was finished. I forgot. \u00a0And had to ask him again. (It drives me nuts when bars do tastings without some sort of coaster or something to place under the beer... heck even a post it note is fine. \u00a0I'm drinking alcohol here people... how in the heck am I supposed to remember what beer number one was by the time I get to beer number five??? \u00a0Seriously!  Anywho...  We \u00a0finished our tastings and ordered a couple of pints (we dubbed it \"the third one we drank as of course neither of us could remember the name of it) \u00a0and then hit the road for the long drive back to Seattle.   I LOVE beer as does the other half.. but I was so underwhelmed by the place that I can't even remember the beers we ordered even after the bartender lifelessly told us what it was again.   Completely non memorable establishment that is more than likely only still chugging along due to the fact that it is in a tourist location. (Fishermans Wharf).",

Couple of friends and I couldn't decide which group to choose for the sampler tastings, so we just got all three flights of the beer tastings. Twelve 5-oz. tastings for $30-something. WE LOVE BEER SAMPLERS!!!  I also bought a couple of kick ass Stella reusable bags. They will now be my lunch bags for work.   This place also carries those kick ass looking steins with the fancy tops. They are relatively cheap but then you'll find that it's because they are not made in any of those cool European countries.",

They had a great selection of beers, knowledgable and friendly staff, clean bar, nicely decorated and affordable drinks.  The beers were also local which was great because I've never been to San Francisco and was really excited to try some local beers.   Kevin was definitely a great bartender and able to manage the multiple tables he had while being the only one working. Was impressed with this place :)",

A rather odd waitor came up and dropped off Drink and snack menus, then came back took our drink order in about 3 minutes so very quick service....at first.  The Beer here is very good as were the Garlic fries we ordered. 16oz Beer was 6.75 not bad and well worth it. Garlic fries were some of the best I have had and you get a huge pile for 5 bucks! The atmosphere is nice and they have lots of vintage beer signs and other odds and ends,   So here is the NEGATIVE... Our waitor was very short with us like he didn't care to be there, not polite. He at one point was falling asleep in the corner NOT OKAY! The other waitor there was however on top of things and running around trying to compensate for the lazyness of the other guy. It took 15 minutes after we asked for our check to get it then anoter 10 to bring it all back.  I would go there again for the beer and fries, just hope our next visit is better.",

The food was a bit on the expensive side for what it was so we just ask to see if we could get some French fries to hold us over until dinner. The guy was nice and said sure we could get you some fries. So we get our two beers and took awhile waiting for the fries but that was fine. The fries came out and get its a small tiny amount of fries. They were typical frozen bag and I'm sure we got the bottom of the bag....you know the ones that are only like an inch long. So my friend ask for some ranch and they say they don't have any when clearly they have a whole salad section on the menu and the people before us had ranch on their salad. Anyways it is what it is but then the check comes and its $9 bucks for these fries. Crazy! I wouldn't tell anyone to go to this place and I will never be back.",

The beer selection was not as great as i was hoping. There was about 7 - 8 beers on tap and the rest bottles (which I could get at any liquor mart.)
