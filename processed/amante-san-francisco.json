All most all of the patrons were old white dudes...but that might be explained by the bartender with her tits out for days.  They have a $15 card minimum, which on principal, is enough to never make me go back.   Their only redeeming factor is in-house infused vodkas. On the day I stopped in it was pineapple...freshly infused pineapple vodka. I had it with soda water, $7.  Overall, not a bar I would visit very often except to check out their newest vodka.",

Amante was a fun little spot. It was pretty busy when I got there, but luckily my friends had snagged a table.   There are quite a few tables along the wall and then some seating at the bar. They play a good selection of music, but they play the music really loud. I had quite a few moments where I was trying to talk loud enough that my friends could hear me and the music would stop and I would still be yelling haha. This is not necessarily a place to go chat with friends, but definitely a relaxed place to go chill. I would think that with the music they were playing that people might be dancing, but no one was dancing either.   As for the drinks, I had beer, so I can't comment on the mixed drinks. The beer was reasonably priced and even at the busy moments in the night, the bartenders were fast! This place was good at keeping the drinks coming. Also, if you are sitting at a table they have wait staff that will take your drink orders. Although at the busy times in the night it was faster to go get a drink from the bar.",

    "review_text": "Any respectable bar has to have character and that Amante does in spades. Like most places with unique character, a patron has to know the time they prefer to hit said bar and naturally that depends on what yer interest is. If you're looking for a mellow atmosphere to be able to have convo with your cocktail, then it's best to get in on the early eve' side of things. Otherwise be prepared to run into droves of those looking to \"get their North Beach on.\" If you're not comfortable in a bar unless you're \"pre-soaked,\" and requiring the requisite population of \"man-tastic\" and \"shorty cakes\" well then Amante may not be yer thing.  Went in before a dinner rezy for a quick cocktail. We were at first skeptical, thinking that we'd either stepped into a private Italian bar or J-Lo's boudoir. It's like a mini-Vegas, Ratpack-era bar, with mirrors, a stage and blue-walled interior setting the tone straight away. Huge \"A\" for -what else- Amante. \u00a0The place was seemingly dead. If you mistake Amante for Sleepy Hollow, you're making a big mistake; the place can get crowded in a flash when there's a band or with night owl revelers. Bartenders don't mess around when mixing drinks, preferring to offer a healthy dose rather than watering down like most places. Wiz is one of the best bartenders in the city and -to boot- has a great Ipod mix \"soundtracking\" the background for you. Clientle range from old school, eye-patch wearing fifty-somethings, to neighborhood fidi's looking for an option after Tosca or before they move on to do more serious damage. Don't be surprised if you see someone bringing their under-the-arm ankle biter in; most anything is tolerated as long as one behaves. Or, misbehave without getting up in anyones grill...especially Wiz's.",

We got to the bar kind of late for a friends birthday. \u00a0My friend ordered our drinks- 2 cocktails and 2 beers and we all stood around chatting and waiting for them. \u00a0He gave my friend the total when the 2 beers were on the counter and ran the credit card, and when my friend asked about the two cocktails the bartender said he'd made them and put them on the bar, and we must have taken them. \u00a0Since we were all still standing right there waiting for our drinks we explained that this wasn't possible, and he then escalated the situation and accused us of stealing them to get free drinks. My friend calmly explained that no, he was standing right there, and we didn't grab the drinks, but the bartender continued getting more and more worked up and yelling at us. \u00a0He ended up pouring out the two beers we'd purchased in a dramatic fashion, and refunding my friends card, only after loudly making a scene and being rude to us. \u00a0If it were up to me we would have left, but since we were there for a birthday we had to stay. \u00a0So I, standing right next to my friend he was just rude to, proceeded to order the exact same drinks/ pay for them/ give them to my friends. Now I must add that this was a very crowded bar. We were not paying close attention after we ordered drinks.. just standing around and chatting as friends will do in bars. \u00a0So maybe someone grabbed them from the bar, or maybe he forgot to pour them, but the bottom line is that type of treatment was uncalled for and tacky. \u00a0I would have expected better from a cool bar like this. We could \u00a0have afforded many many drinks from that place, and are not in the habit of stealing drinks when going out with friends. \u00a0Chances are we would have gotten drunk and bought way too many drinks from here had the rude fellow behind the bar not killed everyone's buzz.

    "review_text": "There are (surprisingly) lots of hot guys here. Since it's North Beach, they probably all turn into drunk, chauvinistic barfighting frat boys after 10 p.m. but I was fortunate to get here earlier than that. The bouncer was extremely friendly to me while maintaining a decent intimidation factor with other, less soft and cuddly individuals.   As for the cocktails, I drank a lot of somebody else's delicious mai tai (yum!) and I had a couple of decent, strong vodka sodas purchased for me while waiting for Boy to finish parking. Speaking of parking- you'd have to be stoned out of your mind to think you'll ever find parking in North Beach. Anytime. But especially on a Friday night. There is apparently a parking garage nearby, next to the police station. That would have been USEFUL and COOL to know beforehand.   Amante is extremely large and has plenty of comfy, cushy seating. It was the perfect place for our Friday night happy hour. The only complaint I heard (aside from the complaints about our noisy friends) was that drinks were hard to come by and not that great. I'd come back and I'll most definitely use Amante for large groups in the future.  One more USEFUL tip: when a striped shirt with highlights is walking down the street in North Beach with his equally striped shirted, highlighted mantourage, it's best not to yell, \"pop your collar, Motherf*cker\". Just take my word on that. (Hi, Amanda!).",

Adding insult to injury, their sound system was horrible with nasty distortion on the high end like the tweeter was blown or something. To compensate, they had to turn down the overall volume way low.   The crowd is typical North Beach. There was no reaction when the classic club banger \"Can't Stop, Won't Stop\" by the Young Gunz was played, yet they went stone crazy like it was 1987 when Van Halen's \"Jump\" came on. Wow, just wow.  In their defense, the female portion of the crowd was quite attractive.

I hurry past the nonsense to meet my friends at Amante.  It's so damn close to all the lights that Amante isn't really a true escape.

I had some too-drunk issues earlier in the evening, and I appreciate the speed with which I was delivered my water and how nice and accommodating the bouncer was.

I like that you can buy food from Chubby Noodle (cash only) while having a drink here or get pizza later a few doors down. And when we needed a taxi fast, we were able to get one right away! Will definitely be back here!",

I ask if it is first come first serve, he states that it is but he would like us to move. I again say we do not want to because you cannot see the game from the other open tables. When we refuse his request for the third time he tells us to leave... Loved this place I have been going here for two years almost every week. I will never go again!

My friends and I ordered a couple bottles of Chardonnay and tapas. The food was delicious- we had the pepper prawns and the pork shoyu ramen bowl; I especially thought the roasted corn in the soup was a nice touch. Our bar tender was very attentive and our food came out quickly after we ordered. He also kept the water coming which was extremely appreciated.  The place was pretty packed, so we started out at the bar but we were able to move to a table once our other companions arrived. Very fun place.

I think there was some \"cowboy\" party that infiltrated and one of them proceeded to shove his ass in my face. When my friend asked him nicely to scoot over, he literally got in her face and told her to \"chill out\"...really? Next we were almost molested by a miserably drunk guy who was practically spitting all over us.  I remember this place as being a lot nicer...it just seems grittier. I also recall that there was a cocktail server who used to take orders, and somehow this was distinctly missing. The whole experience just reminds me why I need to NOT come to North Beach for the nightlife any time soon again....strip clubs, drunken fights- ahhh the nostalgia",

This was by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had. When paying for the tab we asked our server if he would split the tab up 8 ways on different cards. He agreed that that was fine. He came back a few minutes later to retrieve our money and my friend that hands him the cards says we have $40 cash and 7 cards and he was like no, no I just want to run the cards and not take the cash. So then my friend was like ok well there are only 7 cards instead of the 8. Well, our server still divided our bill up 8 ways on the 7 cards. So when he came back to retrieve our signed receipts, kept asking where the last receipt was. He started getting all perplexed and was like no there were 8 slips. My friend, re-explained what she had already told him about there only being 7. He then proceeds to tell us that we were a bunch of drunk girls and didnt know what he was talking about (it was 830pm on a saturday and we had each only had 1-2 drinks as well as dinner the 2 hours we were there) and that it wasn't his fault. He started getting a horrible attitude with us and yelling at us. We were NOT trying to screw him by any means and wanted to make it right but he would not listen to what we were saying. THEN, to make matters WORSE, the OWNER, yes OWNER comes over and yells at us saying that this issue was taking away from the other customers and that we needed to get this issue resolved. Ok, I am sorry but please do NOT yell at US for your server making a math error!! So, instead of leaving we were STILL trying to make things right, so we head over (just my friend and I who have BOTH been in the service industry) to where the owner and our server were to try to resolve it. We asked him what was the difference owed. Our server then tells us that he would like us to \"get the hell out of there and out of his face.\" Seriously?!?! 8 girls that ALL live in North Beach, that come in there quite often are now NEVER going back there. That was the rudest I have EVER been treated at a restaurant in my life. We will never be going back there and I am definitely going to make it a point to tell everyone else I know not to ever go back there as well.",

Enjoy the atmosphere here, people are nice and trying to have a good time. Most of it is a younger crowd but you'll always run into a few oldies.",

    "review_text": "No cover! Horray!  On a drunken Saturday night, the weekend before St. Patrick's Day, we skipped out of King of Thai Noodle bar through the crowded sidewalks of North Beach and found ourselves inside Amante.  Large place, with a large bar (makes getting a drink much more pleasant), and seating! Classier than I was expecting (from North Beach, and in general), with ambient lighting and boppin' music. Seating definitely upped the place a couple stars for me. After a 2-hour trek through Lands End and Golden Gate Park earlier that day, the last thing I wanted to do was stay on my feet the whole night.   Went up to the bar and asked for \"vodka with pieces of fruit in it\" because that's what was recommended on Foursquare. The bartender probably thought I was a little mentally challenged, but if he was, totally hid it well and said, \"Well, we have pineapple infused vodka, you want to try that?\" It turns out that that was exactly what I wanted to try!   Ordered it on the rocks (will try martini next time) and took some sips. It went down really smoothly and was definitely pineapple-ly. I decided to make it even more delicious by asking for a glass of Sprite (for free, yay!) and mixing it in. It was very yummy.   Drinks not too expensive (beer was only $5!) and we chatted over the loud music. Really awesome place to chill with a big group if you're in North Beach for non-strip club reasons.   Only gripe: the bathroom only had 1 stall. I don't think it really bothered my friend, though. She took a look at the line and decided the men's bathroom would be just fine for her. The guy who arrived shortly after she went in was pretty surprised/confused when she came out!",

I typically order the fries which come with a side of ranch dressing and ketchup. Some of the best fries I've ever eaten. I think they drizzle crack on them to make so addicting.

It is a high quality drinking establishment, with its ample standing space, plenty of seating at the long bar and cushioned seating as well (couches and such).  The only issues that I ran into was flagging down the bartenders, which I put down not to their ability but the fact that it was a long bar and lots of people waiting on drinks.  Once I did however I had a drunken conversation with one bartender who had just come off duty; another bartender came by and jumped in. Together they gave me an awesome list of bars/restaurants that aren't tourist traps in my neighborhood: North Beach (they do exist!). \u00a0 Beers were reasonably priced (5 bucks a Guinness), and the only hard liquor I had was a pineapple/mango vodka infusion (chilled) was tasty, but I can't really vouch for their drinks otherwise.  Also, they're close to Golden Boy Pizza, if you get hungry.",

We must if spent $150 &amp; tipped almost $100- bartenders do that.- plus the \u00a0discounts were alright. But we knew it was the owner so we were cool.  Suddenly someone notices Madison who will always look like a puppy, and for @5 min she was passed about the bar..  Apparently someone complained. Cuz we were thrown out by the owner we had just spent a bunch $$$$ on. No explanation. Just bye now you with the dog.  Jerk.",

I really liked the crowd that this place brought--serious, not too trendy, but fun-loving, save for a few frat boy types that somehow ended up here and tried to tell me that because I asked for a cigarette for my friend (since I don't smoke and she is shy) that I would have to do some sort of sexual favor (\"do all of us\"), which one of them first said would have to be done to his friend who gave me the cigarette, and then he changed his mind and said \"all of us,\" circling his hand around to about five men around him, all of whom were much more attractive than him, and who were not seconding his suggestion. I sort of told him to screw off and he did. Misogynistic asshole.   Overall then people are interesting and nice, though, but a few too many foreigners here for a regular sort of spot. It's a once in a while place. The bar itself was scattered with cute Australian men the night I was there, save for the eldest of them who was a bit creepy and invited me to have a seat. Luckily I already had one elsewhere and was passing by.  Drink prices were good, too. $6 for a sidecar served up tasty like a sweet tart with a sugared martini rim.",

    "review_text": "I recently came across this place when meeting a buddy for a drink. It's located in North Beach on Green street by Golden Boy pizza. We actually came here for the noodles \u00a0at Chubby Noodle, which is located inside the bar. I've walked by this place a million times and it never occurred to me that there's small restaurant within the bar. We came for the noodles but stayed for the drinks once we realized what a cool bar this is.  For starters, the staff is very very friendly. I met who I assume is the owner when we sat down. I'll review the noodles another time as this bar definetely deserves some attention.  The coolest thing about this place is that they infuse their own vodka. The time I was here it was pineapple infused and it was absolutely delicious. I'm a huge vodka fan and usually drink it straight or martini style so I was really pleasantly surprised. I've had flavored and home infused vodka before. I was just kind in shock that a local dive type bar would go through the trouble of doing this. It's not a complicated process at all, but It's cool that a business chooses to distinguish themselves from the herd.  We were there for a couple of hours and I will definitely \u00a0go back. The bartender was really nice and the mix of people that trickled in as the night progressed was pretty cool. Not too many douchebags and a nice mix of good looking women. All in all we had a great time and I was actually surprised by the atmosphere considering the touristy location. The fact that we could also snack on some pretty awesome noodles and other good fare didn't hurt.",

    "review_text": "Not fancy, not a dive bar. Best part of this bar is the Chubby Noodle food (separate review). But they also have very good prices for drinks, especially for this neighborhood. The house made pineapple infused vodka is tasty and something different from the usual, though that's really the only thing on the drink menu that was unique. They also have some good seating options: high tables with views of TVs (good for game watching), a comfy booth/table with curtains near the door (though not good if you're tired--I fell asleep there once), and outdoor tables that make for great people watching on this section of Green.",

    "review_text": "Being right down the street from home, this bar serves as a good happy hour spot. A mellow Friday evening with some lovely Yelp buddies, I enjoyed the early evening crowd.   At 6pm there was plenty of comfy seating, no loud music to shout over, and several big screen tvs to view the baseball game. I had no problem ordering my drink, which a rum &amp; diet coke ran me roughly $6. Not too bad, and the bartender was quick to serve me. If you want some snacks to go with your munchies, they have appetizer dishes as well.   The crowd was a mix, and I actually enjoyed the fact that I could have a decent conversation with friends, unlike the usual loud bar shouting scene. No thrilling stories attached this review, but just the pure facts of Amante :)",

I already had lunch but my eyes were drawn to some woman at the bar plate looked yummy, wait smelled yummy; I did not have as a clear imagine as I wanted too since I was sitting at the window, but ease dropping on the food conversation and sounded like they LOVED IT!   The bartender there went out of his way to bring me some more water at the window! What The! SWEET! It was rather slow later afternoon nonetheless I have never experienced that kind of service from any bartender! 5 stars for that.",
