    "review_text": "PENTHOUSE, WHERE THE MAGAZINE COMES ALIVE...   Every wo(man)'s fantasy is to devour an epicurean meal while watching beautiful feminine curves with twin peaks and bountiful hind mounds swing gracefully around an elongated pole. Ok, maybe just my fantasy (along with millions of guys) but if anyone could make that happen, I thought the posh Penthouse Club &amp; Steakhouse could.   Gnawing on sub-par food while botox-injected females BOOTY SLAP the floor like they're tenderizing a piece of meat was neither classy nor appetizing. I'm sorry but are we auditioning for a Yay Area rap video?  Self-taught, Chef Mike Ellis comes from the one Michelin starred Dry Creek Kitchen (Healdsburg) and is hoping to gain a Michelin star for Penthouse. From the pedestrian presentation, the lukewarm food, mismatched ingredients and flavors, and poor execution, it looks like they have a LONG way before they can even be considered a contender for that highly coveted star.  F O O D *FOIE GRAS TERRINE w/ Sweet Potato Preserve, Brioche &amp; Fleur de Sel ($24) - 2 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DV1b8JEtcwLz_rXiEBwpag?select=JJlk1VIASpp3yM7gg_EwJg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DV1b\u2026</a> Failing in both presentation and execution, the foie gras terrine lacked a luxurious buttery mouth-feel. The out of place sweet potato preserve gave an odd, unappetizing sweetness when paired with the foie gras.   *MASAMI WAGYU TRIO: Pork Belly, Sirloin &amp; Cheek ($69) - 2 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DV1b8JEtcwLz_rXiEBwpag?select=eFuTva0KfoNmvDn6wbntOg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DV1b\u2026</a> A special of the night, Masami wagyu beef is a Japanese wagyu and American angus crossbreed. Being free-range, Masami has less marbling but still possesses full on wagyu flavor.  --PORK BELLY: The best part of the tepid trio but not a success. The pork belly had a good meat to fat ratio, however, was NOT braised long enough to achieve that melt-in-your-mouth texture. An acid should have been used to balance the richness not a sweet pea puree. \u00a0  --SIRLOIN: Underseasoned, the Masami was nothing like the ones I've had. It was slightly tough and very chewy reminiscent to sirloins I've had at middle of the road restaurants.  --WAGYU CHEEKS: Properly cooked cheeks should be like butter on your tongue. These under braised cheeks were like a brisket and beef shank hybrid. Lacquering the cheeks was an overwhelmingly salty wine reduction making them even more unpalatable.  *BLACK TRUFFLED CREAMED SPINACH ($8) - 4 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DV1b8JEtcwLz_rXiEBwpag?select=AbUhz2XRg7Yig1DAbzHkbg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DV1b\u2026</a> The best part of the meal, the creamed spinach was decadent and sinfully good with the crown of crisp melted cheese.  *PARMESAN &amp; BLACK TRUFFLE FRIES ($8) - 2 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DV1b8JEtcwLz_rXiEBwpag?select=qvINDMhGg9rRkdej353vDQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DV1b\u2026</a> Arriving lukewarm, the fries lacked a crisp throughout and the earthy truffle essence was nonexistent.  S E R V I C E From the cute Asian doorman (Hi, Andy!) to the wait service to the managers, everyone was welcoming and had a smile on their face. Although green and unpolished, the dining wait staff was friendly, attentive, and eager to please (may change if busy).  * * *CREDIT CARD USERS BEWARE* * *   Per our waiter, it's \"company policy\" to take (not look but TAKE) your ID when paying with a credit card. This made me very weary especially when our waiter was gone for a good 10 minutes with my credit card and ID. Additionally, I checked my online account activity this morning and found I was charged $3.67 MORE than what I signed for. Not a big amount but nonetheless SHADY!!! MINUS ONE WHOLE STAR.   T H E \u00a0G I R L S (not as pictured in promotional pics online) Nothing extraordinary that can't be found in a SF dance club (average was 6/10) but we had our favorites. Naomi, the ebony beauty had a banging body with a personality to boot; she can definitely work that pole. The engaging Cameron made my friend's bf weak in the knees with her alluring brown eyes. As for the other girls...let's just say, Joan Rivers inspired face lifts, awesomely bad frizzy hair, termite infested thigh high stockings and booty munching butt floss did not help their cause.  A M B I A N C E / D E C O R Elegance meets trendy nightclub (like Gold Club), the key imprinted carpets and trio keyhole door takes you into the main entry way with a beautiful cascading diamond chandelier and luminous lighting.  Dine upstairs in their 60 seat dining room with beautiful white draped booths with a stripper adorned pole (no bare boobies upstairs). Then, go downstairs to the main floor for more booty popping action while popping bottles ($295-$21,000) and making it rain with your life savings. If you come from Generation (Y) Broke like myself, you can make it rain with your lunch money.  P A R K I N G Difficult street parking but valet parking is available.

    "review_text": "We decided to try the food before the Grand Opening and came in to enjoy Executive Chef Mike Ellis' food creations on Tuesday evening. The space is nicely remodeled and looks very modern. Penthouse is definitely not your average dark &amp; dingy strip club. This place screams luxury and fun, and this is coming from a woman!  The kitchen is open and has bar stools situated right at the open counter, so you can watch some of the creative cook work while also enjoying the entertainment on the main stage. We were mainly there for the food, but I have to say, the entertainment does not hurt in between courses!  Mike started us out with some oysters topped with caviar. They were refreshing, delicious, and a great beginning course with our glass of bubbles. We then had a trio of seafood appetizer. A perfectly cooked shrimp topped with a slice of tangerine, succulent crab meat topped with avocado puree, and fresh diced hamachi with tomato. Each component had very nice subtle flavors that didn't overpower the other two.   Our first main course was uni crusted cod topped with a curry coconut emulsion and ginger carrot puree on the side. The fish was executed to perfection and all the flavors together worked up a culinary storm in my mouth. This was hands-down my favorite dish of the evening and my boyfriend concurred.   The second main course was black truffle roasted chicken with fresh corn grits and chipotle jus. It was served with three different cuts from the chicken. The skin was super crunchy and the meat was juicy. I don't like grits, but I loved these! It was a very hearty, homestyle cooked dish that went great with the paired chardonnay that the chef suggested.   For the third main course (yes, we ate a lot that night) we each got the duo of Rosen Colorado lamb - a rosemary roasted bone-in chop and a 36-hour sous vied shoulder with fava beans and carrots in an orange black currant sauce. Both cuts of lamb were tender tender tender. They were to tender that I even ate all the fatty parts, which were absolutely delicious! Second favorite dish for the night! I'd order this again anytime. Lamb gets executed well in few restaurants - hats off to the executive chef at Penthouse! This dish paired very nicely with the A by Acacia Pinot Noir.  My boyfriend got the 28-day dry aged bone-in ribeye with chimichurri sauce and I got the grass fed filet mignon with shallot confit and sauce Diane. We were both getting full at this point, but not full enough to not devour both of these beef dishes. The chimichurri sauce was the best we have ever had and really enhanced the juicy ribeye. My filet mignon was tasty and rich and the shallot confit added a nice sweet touch to the dish. We had the Jordan Cab with the meat dishes.  This was one of the best food experiences I have had in a long time! Every single dish was eaten in its entirety and the bits were scraped off the plate with our forks. I would have licked the plate had I been at home. Executive Chef Mike Ellis has created an amazing and versatile menu that is guaranteed to please anyone's palate.",

Most expensive cover I've ever paid. But we thought hey lets give it a shot we always pass this place and have never gone in.  The place was dead. Bad sign. My bf and I got some drinks and sat stage side.   The first couple girls were thin, I mean realllll thin, like anorexic thin, like anorexic and a meth problem thin. The last girl was so hideous I just didn't know what to do. My bf and I were in shock and we just kept looking down or away. You know it's bad then cuz I will typically look at any naked woman and be appreciative, but this, this was just horrible. I'm not trying to talk shit or be mean but I was seriously just completely shocked at this last dancer. Such masculine jaw and frame, I just couldn't believe my eyes, it was painful to watch, she was trying hard and the other two people sitting stage side were completely ignoring her as well. I normally always tip at least a buck or two out of courtesy because I mean these girls are getting nude for your entertainment but good lord!! I was resolving to at least throw out a single when she just up and ran off stage.  At this point I just felt bad and we tried to slurp down our drinks as quickly as we could so we could leave. An Indian girl tried to get us to get a couples dance. She was pushy and totally uninterested. We tried to decline politely but she persisted ad we finally just up and left.  Do yourself a favor and walk 5 mins down the street to Hustler. Prettier girls by far, better and more enticing environment. You'll be much more pleased.",

So what happens?  30 minutes to come around and take \u00a0our order. 30 minutes after the order was taken, we're told they don't have enough meat to make burgers. 8 of us ordered burgers (but only because they didn't have filet mignon) and they only had enough beef for 4 orders. good grief. an hour later our food came out. I had ordered my burger RARE because I was warned they overcook things. it was way over well done and salty as hell. I barely touched my burger. good thing I ordered a side of jalapeno mac &amp; cheese! It was edible, even though it tasted like jalapeno cheddar Cheetos.   Here's the kicker.  On a Thursday night, the restaurant empty and only our group (keep in mind we had a reservation!) dining... THEY RAN OUT OF UTENSILS.

Some friends said they haven't seen a place like this every since their return from Miami.   There's two levels. A dining area upstairs and the main floor downstars. Along with a 2 story pole. A two story pole. During dinner, some girls would climb up and the birthday boy would go over there and give them high 5's. Plus, the girls below liked it when we made it rain from upstairs on to the stage below.   * 28 DAY DRY AGED 16oz BONE-OUT RIBEYE ($58) As fitting as the NY Strip sounded, you can't go wrong with ribeyes. Fancy for being topped with a chimichurri sauce and an onion confit. The broiler it was cooked in didn't get hot enough to create that addictive char. Not the best steak in SF but given the amenities better than I expected.   Thumbs up on the corn grits, roasted mushrooms, black truffle fries, and black truffle creamed spinach sides.

    "review_text": "When I first heard of this place, I thought to myself -- a Michelin chef at a gentleman's club? I must give it a whirl! So, 3 weeks after they opened I headed up with a few friends for dinner &amp; entertainment.   This review will encompass 2 aspects: DINNER and DANCING.   DINNER - 4.5 stars Our server, Mike, was phenomenal. \u00a0He had a ton of personality and was quite attentive. \u00a0  Between the four of us, we each chose different dishes and tried each others. I'm very pleased that we did too - because this improved my opinion on the dinner. \u00a0  *grilled marinated asparagus - REALLY good. \u00a0The meyer lemon &amp; poppyseed dressing (dollops on the side of the plate) paired really well with the egg, manchego and asparagus. \u00a0I'm not sure how I feel about this as a starter (because it's not a salad) - but would make an excellent side.   *flash seared hamachi - delicious. The hamachi nigiri comes on top of a spooned out portion of avocado adorned with julienne jalapenos and a tiny boxed bowl of ponzu on the side.   *terrine of Sonoma foie gras - quite good. The brioche looks more like texas toast than anything but the sweet potato, fleur del sel and foie gras marry nicely. In fact, after reading the other reviews before going - we had to laugh (while enjoying this) at the girl who said the sweet potatoes added an unappetizing sweetness. \u00a0Foie gras is usually paired with something sweet...  *lamb - WOW. \u00a0This was the star of the entrees as far as I'm concerned. \u00a0I only wish I'd ordered it for myself! flavorful, juicy, delicious...   *buttermilk fried chicken (special) - moist on the inside, flavorful on the outside though not very crispy. \u00a0Mind you, I only had a bite of this.   *pork belly (special) - perfect.  *trio of beef ($69) - This is what I chose and would never choose again. Well, maybe the beef cheeks - those were suuuuuuuuper tasty. \u00a0It reminded me of eating my mom's stew though, which given the location, was slightly odd. \u00a0;)   The second part of this trio was the sirloin. \u00a0I asked the sirloin be cooked medium rare. \u00a0When Mike came over to see how we all were doing I had to point out that it wasn't medium rare, but medium well. \u00a0(<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-G8GPQA8Ha7w%2FTdWmrZzk9sI%2FAAAAAAAAAI4%2FXKnNSSqOMuA%2Fs1600%2Fsteak_doneness.jpg&amp;s=4dac8218c3b873f5869f0d833f1fe2c77a4f7dc59aae5e21adb1731e65e36c92\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">1.bp.blogspot.com/-G8GPQ\u2026</a>) I felt awful sending it back but when you're paying $70 for 9 oz. total of meat... it ought to be perfect, right? \u00a0He brings it back and asks me to check -- this time it's just medium, but you know that? \u00a0I'm certainly not going to send it back a second time - so I take a couple bites and then pass it along. \u00a0After going downstairs, I realized the cooks in their open kitchen must've been distracted by the ladies on stage. ;)  Finally, the beef belly with celery &amp; broccoli purree &amp; crispy rice left me wishing I'd requested the pork belly instead. \u00a0The beef belly was just not my thing. \u00a0My girlfriend and I both thought it was just way too fat. \u00a0The boys on the other hand seemed to like it. \u00a0I did manage to eat one piece that had some meat on it and was REALLY good.   *fresh corn grits - OMG --- best I've ever had.   *truffle fries - calling them truffle fries is generous; There just wasn't a strong truffle presence. \u00a0  *mushrooms - This was the one thing on the table I didn't try because i became full. \u00a0  *espresso -- it's espresso -- it was good. \u00a0Although, my friend had to ask for a zest of lemon and they don't have raw sugar or even cubes. \u00a0  We all were drinking Jameson that night and let me tell you -- weakest pours ever. \u00a0The Jameson/rocks were so watered down a child might've mistaken it for apple juice. \u00a0 I recommend you order it neat so you can properly gauge what you're drinking. \u00a0  DANCING - 3 stars Before paying for dinner and leaving, we were asked if we wanted a table downstairs, so I said yes. \u00a0What was nice was that it wasn't some scheme where you say yes and then you're stuck with some mandatory minimum or bottle service. \u00a0It just meant we had a table reserved for us. \u00a0 We were greeted by a really pretty girl in a green dress whose name escapes me -- but that could very well be due to how quiet she was talking. \u00a0It's quite loud in there - so use your big girl voice!  The table they reserved was near the main stage and met with your typical, comfortable chairs and a tiny table. Behind this main are and near the bar was a smaller second stage where girls just looked like they were practicing. There's also a third \"stage\" on the 2nd level w a glass floor.   Each girl took their turn with 1-3 songs and only a few of them even used the pole. \u00a0Even less had any enthusiasm which was highly disappointing. Possibly more disappointing than the dancing, and perhaps a reason for it - the music was AWFUL. \u00a0It's not a club - I don't want to hear high energy music or see them try to dance to that. \u00a0Are you kidding me? Lame.  AMBIANCE The place is beautiful - there's no doubt about that.   I look forward to seeing how the Penthouse Club &amp; Steakhouse progresses especially as a restaurant.",

From the outside your automatically going to thing that it's your typical dirty strip club but wow when I stepped in I felt like I was in an episode of Miami Vice.   The interior is very fresh, the hosts and hostesses are very friendly as well as the kitchen staff. Went upstairs and had dinner, I had the beef carpachio? (Sorry I can't spell but it's yelp who gives a F on spelling haha) Anyway went down stairs to have some of fun and boy did we ever. Let me put it this way if any of you are champagne fans these guys have an excellent selection...from middle class to I'm an ignorant FFF and I'm buying out the bar! From a cheap bottle of rose' to Ace Of Spades..(Including MAGNUM size) they can convene to your champagne wishes. The hostesses are hotter than the dancers that's why I gave it a 4/5.   The service here though is top notch..I wont go into detail but let's just say I had some cups of the rose and lost a $500+ car remote to my vehicle. The next morning when I realized what had happened I called up and they said they had the keys and they'd place them in their valet box and that I could pick them up anytime. These guys saved me hundreds! which is totally the opposite when you think of a strip club but it was true! Anyway came down picked up my keys and still chopped it up with all of the staff great great people ladies and gents please come check this place out. To be honest this is my favorite spot to eat I really don't consider this a strip club. I'd honestly take a first date here because it's THAT CLASSY!",

As a person that experienced shady service and complete disregard of courtesy, this will not be a flattering review.  The story: \u00a0Large group of us (17-18 or so) booked a 3 course dinner and bottle service. \u00a0The email and phone-call exchanges occurred for several weeks prior to our event. \u00a0We finally chose the menu, paid a deposit and proceeded to get everyone amped up for a fun night on Broadway.  The Drinks &amp; Dinner: \u00a0Drinks were on par price wise, my bill was over $200 and I thought that was generous given that we ordered several shots and drinks (just on my tab). \u00a0So the bartender should get 5 stars.  ---The Food: First Course was lobster bisque, decent. \u00a02nd Course was Steak, pretty normal tasting, not too flavorful and certainly not worth the price. \u00a0The dessert was some chocolate cake that was okay but tasted as if it were store bought.  The Service from Management: \u00a0I understand it was a Friday night in the City, but it was completely empty when we were eating and we wanted to make our way downstairs for our bottle service to watch the show. \u00a0Management disagreed with allowing us to bring our group downstairs! \u00a0They said that they could provide our bottle service upstairs only, where there is no action, no dancing, and even LESS PEOPLE!!!  There was a manager that could pass for an awful Robert Downey jr look-alike; and he \u00a0was a jerk to keep this PG if you know what I mean.  Key Points:  --Not willing to work with us at all --Their club was super empty at 11:30pm  --We had been told that we could go downstairs and then the one manager said no it was just super lame sauce. \u00a0Why have one manager say one thing and another says no? \u00a0HELLO!!!

That moves me from lust to smitten.  So any club that hires that kind of dancer wins my support. Plus the space is clean, modern and friendly. Only occasionally do they have one of those announcer fellows who sounds like he came right out of a bad movie (Let's here it for Caannnndy). The bottles are expensive, but not much more than bottle service at a bar. The patrons, for the most part, aren't that kind of gross sleazy variety you sometimes see in some clubs.  And if you show up when the place isn't fully packed, you might find yourself talking to someone who is not only beautiful, but actually can hold their own in a conversation.

It's like a club at times.  There is a bar if you prefer sitting there, and a few TVs usually showing some sporting event. The waitresses are friendly too. Shots all around is the norm. Downstairs snack foods were only okay and is on the saltier side. I will return to try the regular food upstairs.  When leaving, a poet's words always resonate, \"Excuse me (excuse me), But I might drink a little bit more than I should tonight, And I might take you home with me if I could tonight...\"",

Our waitress (the ground level near the bar) was very friendly, attentive and professional! \u00a0We had two rounds of drinks and both times didn't wait long for them. \u00a0She was great and her smile was a big plus!  All the performances were entertaining. \u00a0The interior design of the club is trendy, but the tables seemed small to serve large steak entrees. \u00a0I will update my review after going back to try their lunch and dinner.",

I tell people to think outside the box. \u00a0The only problem is that sometimes you're so far out, \u00a0you forget what the box is suppose to look like.  Stick to what you know, good food. \u00a0This establishment is a giant leap back from the quality we expect from you.  Sincerely, A saddened fan",

    "review_text": "It's Grand Opening Night on Thurs, March 15th   A great friend of my boyfriend's, who owns a few night clubs in SF, gave us an invitation VIP pass to Penthouse Club. Sure, why not when it's free. And of course, the boyfriend would love to go especially when it's a strip club. I was kind of sketchy at first, but hey, why not enjoy the night and make him happy.   We did not come for the food. We just wanted to check out the place. The invitation on the pass says it starts from 9pm. We got there right at 9pm. There were two lines to get inside - paid tickets &amp; VIP passes. We were a few heads near the front entrance. The lines got longer &amp; longer. The security/bouncers did not let anyone in until after 9:30pm'ish; because there was also a '7pm' invitation for dinner. It was already packed inside. They let you in, only if you have a bottle/table reserved. Why did they make two events from 7pm &amp; 9pm. Very unorganized. The staff manager &amp; security were very apologetic for the people waiting in line. It's nice of them to apologize in person. We didn't mind because we got a free VIP pass anyways. 2-star for the wait.   We finally got inside. The interior looks nice, modern &amp; upscale. It was my first time here. There are two floors. The first floor is where all the action entertainment is at. The second floor is the dinner area with a little action. My bf says this place used to be \"Showgirls\" and it still looks the same to him. They did no renovations to the place except for new furnitures, accessories &amp; lighting. It still looks great to me. 4-star for the interior.  There were a lot of girls working. Mostly average. Some pretty. Some skinny. Some short. Some with thickness (but not too thick). The girls really work you to give them money. Outfits were mostly lingerie. Some scandalous. Some club-ey. A few sexy dresses. This is only top-less. Not all-the-way. 3 stars for the girls.   My bf &amp; I walked around and got bored. The cranberry-vodka was too weak. Decided to get a table in the front where all the action was at. We were lucky to get a table right after a group left. A couple of our friends joined us. We got a champagne bottle service. It did took awhile for us to get our champagne. They did add in the tip &amp; taxes to the bill. We also ordered a bar menu item. It's some kind of bbq chicken wings/drummettes appetizer. Boy, that was awful. It was cold &amp; dry. Yuck. Do not order this plate unless you're super drunk for food. 3-star for the bottle service. 1-star for the the chicken wings.  Our host, Andy, who works on the floor was awesome. Very top notch service it seemed. 5-star for him. My bf tip him good. A couple girls came to our table. Mostly just all conversations. They were cool &amp; sweet. And yes, I got a lap dance right at our table because of my bf!! He enjoyed it a lot, but the girl didn't really give me a good lap dance. Had better =)   Overall, it was okay. Not a fan yet. We actually did enjoyed our time. It wasn't bad nor great. We would come back again. My bf wants to try their dinner...but since we didn't like the chicken wings bar menu item, I wonder if it's any good...we shall see. If we come back for the food, my next review will be about the food :)",

    "review_text": "For any of you who saw this club before the remodel, you will not believe that it is the same place. Without a doubt, this is the sexiest club in all of San Francisco. Or, as I overheard another patron say during one of the soft openings, \"This is more Vegas than Vegas.\"  The Penthouse Club and Steakhouse has created a space that is enticing, welcoming and comfortable for women. The grand opening was spectacular, and I would say at least half of the people in attendance were women. This club has succeeded in creating a sexualized space where those who would not normally frequent a gentleman's club feel comfortable.  The upstairs VIP and dining area is stunning. Sitting at one of the enclosed dining booths offers an intimate dining experience. Depending on your preference you can adjust the curtains for more or less privacy. And, here comes the big shocker, the food is fantastic. Who knew that a gentleman's club could offer such a great menu, and one that pays attention to the importance of supporting local farmers? I don't eat much red meat, and fortunately this menu has a lot to offer for the non-steak eaters. I had the hamachi starter, the corn grits, and uni crusted black cod, They were all fabulous. As a Kentuckian, I am particular about my grits, and am thrilled to have found a place in SF that does corn grits their due justice.  As for the performers, in my opinion the Penthouse and the Gold Club have the best looking performers in all of San Francisco. As the new club in town, I have a feeling that the Penthouse is going to be the place that pulls the best exotic dancers as they will want to be a part of this incredible space.",

I've never been to Vegas, but I imagine it's like this. Lots of blue and purple uplighting and shit. Free food. Can't complain about some smoked salmon crostini, oysters, and sushi on the reg. $8 Coors Light bottles. This is actually a detriment, and my homie's purchase elicited a disappointed *smh* response. You get stamped for re-entry, just go to one of the many neighborhood liquor stores. Photo op with pornstar. Nicole Aniston was hosting. Make your profile pic the envy of every furry-palmed neckbeard on your friend's list. Even better, have your photographer friend pretend there's a camera malfunction so you can go supercreep and cop a longer feel. Good-looking dancers. Less variety than some places. Seems like the club is \u00a0concentrating on that \"tallish skinny girl with c cups\" look. You can grab some ass for a dollar (I grabbed four by my count).  I'm pretty sure the club \"makes it rain\" to encourage similar behavior. I'd advise against following suit.  It was cool. Oh, and the lusty lady is just down the street if you don't feel like wanking it in the men's room like a normal person.",

    "review_text": "Went on a Tuesday for a Coworker's bachelor party. I don't know much about strip clubs but I have been taking pole dancing classes for a few months now and the dancers were a bit disappointing. The majority of the dancers were doing moves that we learned in day one of my pole dancing class. There was only one that I was impressed with and gave her money which was exhilarating. \u00a0Otherwise I wasn't impressed.   I don't know maybe because it was a Tuesday night and the real entertainers come on the weekends or it could be that I'm not impressed by half naked girls two stepping around a pole.   All and all, after splitting the bill, with food and shots etc it came out to be $135 each for a party of 7. This did not include a lap dance for the groom which was $30 for a performance that lasted less that a minute. This was incredibly disappointing because, after months of learning similar dancing techniques, I feel like I get a better show of dance skill and polemanship at a $35 dance class that last 1 hour and a half and is only a few blocks away.  This all seems like a big rip off to me but maybe I'm not thinking about it correctly or maybe I just need a penis to do the thinking for me to make this place seem like it's money well spent. I will never know.",

    "review_text": "The topping on the cake is seeing my credit card was overcharged nearly $40 on last night's meal...Sorry Penthouse, because of that you're being dropped a star. \u00a0   After seeing pictures and reading articles about the newly designed Penthouse Club and Restaurant, it left me eager to see the place and get a chance to try the foods of a Michelin rated chef (yes, I was really here for only the food). \u00a0I made reservations for our party of four through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&amp;s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">opentable.com</a> for 6:30pm last night. \u00a0Verdict? \u00a0Penthouse failed. \u00a0  FOOD: *American Kobe Beef Carpaccio ($15) - \u00a0Pass! \u00a0Thin slices of beef were topped off with deep fried capers, onions, and a horseradish gremolata and accompanied with toast points. \u00a0The dish had very little taste, the gremolata tasted as if it was simply garnish, but for once I enjoyed capers (probably because it was deep fried and I thought it was bacon). \u00a0The toast points? \u00a0They were simply toasted halves of white bread.  *Kobe Beef Trio Special ($69) - The way the dish was described and my grumbling stomach led me in the wrong direction ordering this dish. \u00a0The trio included 3 oz. of beef cheeks topped off with a baby carrot, 3 oz. of sirloin topped off with an onion, and 3 oz. of belly sprinkled with a rice crisp and topped off with a celery/broccoli puree. \u00a0The dish came out at best warm, but was more along the lines of room temperature. \u00a0The meat contained little flavor and lacked the kobe tenderness I was expecting.   *Black Truffle Creamed Spinach ($8) - Delicious and the BEST part of my meal. \u00a0The creamed spinach was creamy with a crispy top layer. \u00a0Definitely recommended!  *Parmesan &amp; Black Truffle Fries ($8) - Ok, but yet another dish that didn't come out hot. \u00a0The fries tasted like traditional fat fries with parmesan shavings.  SERVICE: The staff was nice and hospitable. From the door guy, to the hostesses, to our waiters, everyone was great. \u00a0We were constantly checked up on, our glasses were topped off with water, and even the restaurant manager came over to say hi. \u00a0It does make me wonder if service was so great because we were the only party in the restaurant for a long period of time. \u00a0The only flag? \u00a0Our waiter took my friend's ID with her credit card while he ran the transaction. Why? I'm not sure, but he was gone for almost 10 minutes.  LAYOUT: Beautifully done! As you walk into Penthouse, you are greeted by ladies at the podium asking if you're there for the club or the restaurant. \u00a0The restaurant is located upstairs in which you're led up by an elevator (I wish there was a stairs option). \u00a0There is a bar and a pole in the middle of the area for all to see. \u00a0Do note, the dancers do not go topless in the restaurant area, only downstairs.  The club is located to the hallway down the left. \u00a0The club has two areas: *an upper area which has a bar, cage, and area we were told is for bottle service *lower level is closest to the stage with a 40 foot pole  PARKING: Somewhat difficult to find, but valet or a paid lot across the street is available. \u00a0  If you get easily offended, you should stop reading now...  TALENT: By using the word \"talent\", do note, I'm using that word lightly. \u00a0With the exception of a few, they were below average. \u00a0During dinner, the girls were C/D grade talent, but as the night progressed it got a tad better. \u00a0  Most girls didn't know how to work it and underutilized the pole (cmmon, you ladies are stippers!). \u00a0During dinner, we watched how LITTLE effort the girls were putting into dancing. \u00a0To many of the girls, it wouldn't hurt to live at the gym a couple days a week. \u00a0If you put your bodies out there, please, give us something we WANT to look at.",

So for my 25th birthday (2days ago), I decided to stay away from the club scenes and do something completely different and amazing...STRIP CLUB! All my friends love the idea and we were all super duper excited about it!  Little did we know.... the only reason why i give it 2 stars - at least we got in for free.  None of us had a good time at all. Now here is why:  There's nowhere to sit! Maybe it's my inexperience in strip clubs, I had no idea that UNLESS you get bottle service or dine with them, you won't get a seat. Now how am I supposed to get a lap dance if I cant sit! I had a party of 7 people so we were just walking around, standing by the bar, getting sent upstairs for \"upstairs seating\". But when we went upstairs, we were told that unless we dine with them, we can't sit either! wth? Thank god one of the guys (maybe a manager) let us sit at a small area... it was already a buzz kill at that time. My other group of friends hadn't had dinner yet, so they were seated to have dinner. 2 of them planned on eating, the other two were trying to get a drink. When the waitress was trying to take down their orders, one of my friends told her he wanted to get a \"makers mark\", the waitress said \"ok, I'll be right back\" and never came back. Later when my friends were checking on the order, they were told that the order was never put in and the kitchen was closed! WHAT? my friends were really upset because they paid to get in to have dinner and they were told the kitchen was closed when they already ordered!   Girls - no disrespect but 6/10. There were only 5 of them walking around and 1 on stage.   We wanted to come here and have a good time, have some drinks, have gorgeous females sit on our laps and motor boat us in the face (rated R). Instead, we were pissed off, tired of complaining and ready to go home.... It was NOT a great birthday, by the time we realize we might've made the wrong choice, it was already 1am. DAMN IT! Will I ever come here again? ummmmm.... no.",
