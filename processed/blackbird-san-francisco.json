I look forward to my return! \u00a0Thanks Blackbird Peeps!",

Both drinks could be gone as their drink menu seems to change a bit over the year.   They have a good pooltable in the back with booths where you can relax with groups of friends. The clientele is mid-20s up to 40s, mostly well-dressed. It's not only men, and I would say this place (on non-weekend nights) has a pretty good mixed crowd.

    "review_text": "I suppose that I have been reaping the benefits of this steadily improving bar for a sufficient length of time that a review is due (my first since moving back to SF!)  Four stars, and I mean it. This bar is a much needed breath of swanky air in the Castro. Between the hip and low-key decor and the (much improved since opening) drink menu, come here for a casual night with friends during the week or for a place to see and be seen on a weekend night.  The bad:   It gets crowded, really crowded, on weekend nights. So crowded, in fact, that I've turned around (with much difficulty) and walked back out the door. I suppose there isn't much that can (or should) be done about this, but there it is.   The good: Where to begin?   The bartenders are all generally nice and personable and quite good at making the drinks currently on Blackbird's menu du jour (try everything on the menu once). Since their opening, when a number of the specialty drinks were downright terrible, they have greatly improved the selection; everything has been worth trying recently, in my experience. My current favorite: the Leather Bound Book (seriously, keep this one around. I'm begging you!). The drinks take a bit of time and effort to make, but they are absolutely worth it and the bartenders are no slouches. The specialty drinks will run you from 8-10 bucks, the beer from 4-6.   The atmosphere is relaxed but classy, something the Castro is lacking. Why is it that the gays can't have nice things? Blackbird either doesn't know or doesn't care, because it certainly delivers regardless (to be clear, this is *not* a \"gay bar\". It just happens to be in the Castro and has a rather mixed-orientation clientele. All are welcome!).  The pool table in the back provides endless entertainment, whether you're playing or watching the tipsy patrons attempt to play.  The owner (manager?) seems to be around the bar most nights (at least the ones I've been there). I haven't had opportunity or reason to speak with him (which is a good thing, right?), but that he's there is comforting and probably goes a long way in maintaining their good standard of service.  Improvements:   Consider keeping the ingredients used in the specialty drinks around post-menu-change. It's really disappointing to find an amazing drink and then have it disappear in a month or so. It may be impractical, but I would think of it as a value-adding treat and thank-you to your repeat customers.   More seating. I don't know how, but I figured I'd throw it in here for posterity.",

I had the Earl Grey Black Currant Vodka infused concoction and I may have been a wee bit to big for my britches ordering it. While good, is was intense in flavor and very stong, very Earl Grey-y. I love Earl Grey in tea form w/ some milk and sugar, but once the flavor is intensified and added to alcohol, woo-wee, hang on tight my dears. Oh, and cash only, my drink was $10 so thank goodness I had an extra $1 for tip in my pocket or I may have had to drink quickly and skeddale (for fear of being slighted by the bar staff, you know what I mean).",

I would consider this place a nice blend between divey and classy. The drinks are great: they have the menu of specialty cocktails on a big board on the side, which is amazing considering I am almost never able to find the menu at the bar when I go to most divey places. \u00a0They aren't necessarily the cheapest, but I expected just as such from a place like this one. This is also a place that you can go not just with friends but also with a significant other for a cocktail or two. There are plenty of tables where you can sit down and have a nice conversation while still being able to hear one another. Granted it's harder on the busier nights such as on the weekend, but it's still possible. There is also a pool table in the back, which is a nice touch. Overall, a nice place to grab drinks in the Duboce area!",

It has that mix of great laid back ambiance, inventive drinks, and a mixed crowd that you strive to find everywhere in sf.   drinks: The have a scroll up on the wall with all their available drinks - most of them invented cocktails. I've tried silk road (decent) , batida (interesting use of coconut milk, tasty, definitely didn't taste the alcohol), and root of all evil (its scotch, so.. yeah. possibly a little weak though). I also tried their blueberry infused vodka which I'm pretty sure they make in-house - yummy with some soda water. They have these little jars with their oak-aged alcohol which they use in some of their cocktails - i want to try next time!  The bartenders are really knowledgeable and friendly - they can make almost anything you want. Also, during happy hour (5-8PM weekdays), they have cheap well drinks!   other: It can get pretty crowded in there, but it's definitely got a friendly vibe. Because its located at church and market it really has that mixed crowd of people venturing away form downtown and also those coming down from castro. Theres several tables against the wall and some tables towards the back. I always think this is a great place to start your night off of drinking because you can either head to the castro or the mission to continue.   writing this review made me want to go there tonight!",

Blackbird has the perfect lounge setup: a long venue with dim lighting and plenty of tables, chairs, and sofas along the wall. It's crowded but nowhere near suffocating, and if you migrate to the back, you can actually hold a decent conversation without making yourself hoarse. In the back is a pool table for those who like to pass the time hitting balls with sticks, as well as a photobooth ($5) for those who want to take selfies but don't want to be publicly judged for it.  The only downside is that it's CASH ONLY.  At the bar, you'll find paper menus that contain most of their drink options. However, for the real deal, they have a full menu on the wall to the left side of the bar.  (GET THE) $9 NEW ORLEANS COFFEE, offered on draught, which is made with bourbon, Joyride cold brew coffee, chicory tincture (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blackbird-san-francisco?select=VwPKpBRCT74aM6FVGoBDtg#KKWWlEea3KFrmC1iiU7uOQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/blac\u2026</a>). Superbly smooth with woodiness from the chicory.  (GET THE) $10 POACHED PEAR, served up, which is made with pear-infused gin with honey, lemon, and Lambrusco. It tastes like grape juice (thank the Lambrusco, a red grape wine) or a dessert wine, though I would prefer it over a moscato any day ahaha.

Like any bar, it's never going to be completely noise free, but it's quiet enough that you can hold an actual conversation.  Sophisticated enough to be cool, laid back enough to come as you are. Blackbird, I love you just the way you are.",

I had no idea it existed. It is in the spot where metro used to be, after metro had moved out of the spot Lookout is in now. So, its pretty close to BOC. The door woman was nice. Inside, it's a bar. There was some very low music playing, something countryish or I don't even know... I couldn't hear it. Even though it was Saturday, there was not even a pretense of going for the music. There was a pool table or 2 I think. It's not pretentious or yucky looking, just middle. I don't know how the drinks were. If you like going to drink with friends, and just stand there and talk to your friends and drink, then just stand there and drink some more, go here.

They have a pool table (I don't watch the hot dapper people of San Francisco take shots, I have no idea what you're talking about). Awesome riding distance from my house.   It's also sometimes difficult being at Blackbird: The awesomeness makes it sometimes very crowded - like, elbow nudging crowded. Their cocktails can be really sweet and a bit pricy. I like serious, old school style where I can taste what's in the drink. They have a touch of that style, too. San Francisco bars are typically really good at this (yet another reason I heart this city hardcore). The crowded makes for hard hearing when socializing. The pool table's nice to look at, but good luck ever getting to it, because, ya know, there's one.   Weekday neighborhood bar?! YES! Thursday-Sunday or sometimes just later at night? OOF. Roll in with a crew or roll in early. And then, let's drink something tasty!",

A female bartender made our drinks, and she was very eager to answer any questions about the many fascinating ingredients used in their signature cocktails. I had the Blackbird Cobbler (Tawny Port, Frangelico, OJ, Apple Butter, with an orange zest) which I proceeded to make love to. It was devilishly delicious and SO complex...the layers just kept going and going! Next I had the Bitter End, which was so beautiful we had to take a photo. The egg white froth was perfect - what a sexy looking drink. And the flavor - whoa...once again, great layers, refreshing on the front and slightly bitter and tannic on the end. So so pleasant. My companion had the Northern Star which was really well balanced and layered, and something else with overproof Bourbon that he described as a \"man's drink\" - quite liquor driven but delicious. Atmosphere was great, not too hipster-y, but filled with 20-30 somethings drinking micro brew beers and well-made cocktails. And there's a pool table in the back if you wanna do more than just drink.  Only cons were we wished the lights were lower - it could be even sexier than it already is, and one of the bartenders (maybe a barback?) was absolutely hammered drunk and being kind of obnoxious...really unprofessional. Luckily his female coworker made up for it. New menu comes out in April - can't wait to go back and try the new round!!",

The only thing is it takes FOREVER to get a crink when they are packed because the special drinks take a long time to make and they always seem under staffed.  So go early and grab a seat by the window and treat yourself to a special drink; they all rotate and I suggest being adventurous.

The interior is tasteful and modern, but the main reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because the cocktail I was served (\"bols and sand\" I think it was called) was absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced at $8.",

He passed away earlier this month and, in memorium, I felt the need to drink a Manhattan. Based on location/time constraints, Yelp indicated that this would be the best Manhattan I could acquire on the night that I needed one the most. It was a good 'un. Not as good as Grampa's, but I think he would have approved with the care which the bartender took and the results that care yielded.

Enter Blackbird. Blackbird is smack in between Lucky 13 and The Residence, just down the block from Du Nord and The Mint, and a stone's throw from the muni underground, J Church, F train, and 22 Fillmore. Blackbird is also discreet, minimalistic, and well-appointed, with seating a-plenty and super friendly bar staff. Did I mention that above all else, I believe in hot men and happy hour specials? Well, that too. And there are plenty of both at Blackbird. The Speakeasy Tallulah Blonde is just $2 and the house wines are $5 during happy hour, 5-8 p.m. daily.   I also believe in day drinking. Blackbird opens at 12 on weekends and 3 on weekdays. I never have to be sober again. Score! My belief in hot men is strengthened when the hot men in question can't get me in trouble. Since the crowd is largely gay at Blackbird, I am safe AND I have eye candy. Double score! Blackbird is a true neighborhood bar, smack in the middle of Market Street. Down to earth, easy to swallow, and no attitude whatsoever. This is something I can get behind.",

Unfortunately, it seems to be everyone else's favorite bar in San Francisco, given the crush of people here on a weekend night.   I'll give you a quick rundown, though it's hard to have specifics since the drink menu changes seasonally (which should itself be a big plus).   - Seriously delicious cocktails, crafted with care, at relatively reasonable prices ($8-12).  - Fun crowd. I'd say it used to be pretty mixed, but has gotten gayer since Churchill opened up. Once it hits a certain critical mass of gayness, the straight guys feel uncomfortable and the straight ladies follow them. So yeah, pretty gay, at least on Fridays and Saturdays.  - Decor is cool.  - Great bartenders with off-menu drinks. I regularly order a rye old fashioned, and they do a bang-up job of it.  - Sometimes the bartenders have a bit of attitude, to be honest.  - CASH ONLY. Sadly.  - Very busy on Fridays and Saturdays, though clears out around midnight as people leave for dance-type places. Come early to get a table, or come late to avoid the crowds.

The one with pineapple and espresso liqueur is unique and worth a try if you like novelty drinks.  Blackbird is such a gem and I'm very happy we found it.   My one gripe is the shaky wooden tables.

I will hit the bar probably every 20 minutes; no I am not going to tip every single time, but I will tip you every couple of visits. However I hate when bar tenders feel entitled to a tip. The first drink I had was not great at all, and as I was walking to my table to set the drink down the bartender says kind of rudely...\"DON'T FORGET TO TIP THE BARTENDER LADIES\". umm, excuse me? you get $1 and can shove it because the drink you made was garbage. But then I went to another bartender who made me a long island THAT WAS AMAZING! &amp; I wish I still had the dollar i gave the other bartender so i could give this bartender more. There is only one stall in the ladies room, 1 stall and 2 urinals in the dudes. Overall this wouldn't be my first choice of places to go, but if everyone was adamant about coming here I would not fight the crowd. Oh, and they also have a pool table. So I guess, other than than one bartender who makes sucky drinks its a decent bar.  Also, there is no DJ or anything like that, but there is music playing in the background and this place does have a nice ambiance.",

It's an unassuming little place from the outside, as is the fashion in San Francisco... inside, they did a wonderful job. It's stylish and hip without being too intentional; doesn't do the \"LA\" thing and try too hard. Wood finishes and natural tones... it works.  We ordered two drinks from the specialty menu, at random, and both were delicious. Not only that, they were reasonably priced. We had a nice time, enjoyed a chill crowd, had a drink, and left to meet another friend at another venue. Truthfully, when I move back to San Francisco, this would be my new go-to place on a slow night. I'd love to shoot pool, have a drink, hang out, mellow... it's a good vibe.  I'm a believer.",

By the way; about 2 hours into our visit it was mentioned to me that the bar \"might be\" a \"gay bar\". \u00a0Okay - it's near the Castro, so that's just going to be part of the crowd. \u00a0If you can't deal, don't go. \u00a0That being said, the overall vibe is definitely not that of a \"gay bar\" at all \u00a0- the place is just a stylish, hip spot. \u00a0Enjoy.",

    "review_text": "When my friend invited me to join her and her friends at Blackbird for drinks last Friday night, I wasn't quite sure what and where she was talking about. But she did mention drinks so what the heck! While it took a little while to find this place (look for the bird wearing a top hat) as well as parking (look for anything), we finally made our way into the bar.   It was relatively crowded, but not overly so - there was still room to move around without bumping and grinding into your fellow patrons. The place was well lit and clean. In terms of the customers, there was a good mix of the typical San Francisco demographics. The drink menu was written on butcher paper and taped up behind the bar. The noise level was decent - and I had no trouble hearing my friends. After taking in the sights and sounds for a moment, I headed off to order drinks.   On the plus side, the bartenders was very friendly. The wait at the bar wasn't too long. I was surprised to find they had Sudwerks beer on tap since that's more of a Davis/Sacramento thing. The dirty martini and the Manhattan I ordered was mixed relatively well. No complaints from my friends - other than they didn't serve Grey Goose.   On the down side, I was surprised that a place that wasn't trying to be a dive bar didn't take plastic. Given the prices for drinks weren't on the cheap side, you'd think they'd let you swipe. Let's face it, we all end up drinking more than we intend to but we usually only bring enough cash to pay for what we intended to drink.   One interesting feature of this bar is the newspaper \"wallpaper\" they have up. While it looks good aesthetically, native San Franciscans (like yours truly) might find the headlines an interesting read. Some of them bring back memories of local events from years past.   Anyway, the drinks were fine and a good time was had by all so I would definitely go back.",

    "review_text": "Edit: 02/03/2012  I won't post Shawn Vergara's (Blackbird Proprietor) email publicly, but I do want to say that my \"one star\" has moved to a \"three star\" because of it.  This bartender has been suspended \"for being overly aggressive\" (Shawn's words) and will remain on probation when he returns. He was probably having a bad day, but that's no excuse for the behavior we experienced that night. I do hope his behavior changes; I know his behavior doesn't represent everyone working at Blackbird.  I do believe this was an isolated case. I also believe that Shawn is truly concerned about our experience at Blackbird, and that he has acted to ensure that your experience continues to be good.  I'll give Blackbird another try, and the drinks--at least three more tries!  ----- A respected bar turned sour tonight as a group of people were physically assaulted and kicked out by the bouncer at 1:40 AM on a Sunday morning.  Sounds typical, since most have had a lot to drink by that time. But there's no excuse for treating people this way. I understand how bartenders and bouncers had a hard time all night and simply want to go home. But not at the expense of people they just served.  I witnessed an innocent woman being forced out by some \"bouncer,\" pushed backwards through the doors with both hands at 1:45 AM. That kind of treatment after spending a lot of cash (they don't take CC's) on drinks and tips for these owners and employees. Only to be treated like crap at a time they felt like closing.  I also witnessed a few people with iPhones recording things from the sidewalk, and then the bouncer stepped away from one argument (woman pushed out) to starting another by physically grabbing phones. These are customers, not criminals. All they wanted was last call politely. Not with violence and rudeness.  I won't ever return to Blackbird. Plenty of other bars around the city to try. If this is the way they treat people at the end of the night, what's more in the meantime? There's no way I'll return to this offensive place. No thanks.",

Empties out around midnight since it's usually the first stop on a night out for most of the people.  Cocktails are a little pricey, but always tasty.  Sidewinder was ginger beer and mezcal mostly, didn't really taste the other misc. stuff. The spring of basil atop was nommy once you mash it into the ice.

He seemed genuinely excited that I was letting him be creative and do his thing and the end product was AMAZING! Seriously, one of the best drinks I've ever had.

I'm kind of a cocktail snob, so I was super excited to see, on their giant butcher-paper drink menu, that the bar uses Laird's Applejack in one of their signature cocktails. Laird's can be tough to find (or, at least, it was in Boston. I'm a newbie to SF, so maybe that's not the case here?).  My favorite drink in the world, a \"vintage\" cocktail called the Jack Rose, is also made with Applejack, so I asked the bartender for one.   She didn't know how to make it. Which is absolutely fine. I don't expect that every bartender know how to make relatively obscure cocktails. But she was totally bitchy about it, and acted like it was either something I'd made up in college, or some chain restaurant cocktail that doesn't exist in \"real\" bars.   So that sucked and made me feel stupid.   I could have just told her how to make it, but I ended up ordering whatever cocktail it was that had the Laird's in it, and it was pretty good. Very autumnal. So, three stars for the drink. No stars for the bartender's shitty attitude.",

Specialty drinks will run you 8 bucks, a pretty good deal considering the quality ingredients and amount of time that goes into making each cocktail. Can't afford an $8 drink? PBR is only $2.50.

So I guess I have to downgrade to domestic beer if I want to stick to a budget.  I have been to this place a few times during Happy Hours and saw no signs advertising their Happy Hours or their specials, I didn't notice any signs but a big blackboard menu listing well &amp; fancy drinks, although some of them very tasty; I've ordered a few of them.  I would go to this place maybe a few times a year. \u00a0With $12 I can have 4 beers at Toad Hall, Badlands, or Midnight Sun and see just as many cute guys, besides, I do need the variety or would get bored if I always frequented the same place.  I only found out last night that they do offer Happy Hour Specials, only by asking, otherwise it's promoted and most people don't know about it.  Here's some quote:  \"We do offer well cocktails with 1 liquor and 1 mixer=soda or fresh squeezed juice for $3. \u00a0We also offer for \u00a0Sours $4 made from scratch. \u00a0Tap Beers range from $3-4.50 depending on what you order. \u00a0House White $4 or Red $5. \u00a0Bud/Bud L $2.\"  I think you should definitely try this place for yourself and I think you'll like it.",

I'm used to ppl shoving their way up front, drunkenly spouting off about god knows what or being just plain obnoxious. Hmm, I could get used to this chill scene...  To make matters better, the bartender chick w/ specs was super friendly and took care of everyone who posted up at the bar. She even made me an off the menu drink that was pretty damn delicious. I also ordered up the La Flama Blanca (Luxardo Maraschino Liqueur, Pineapple Juice, Cinnamon Syrup, Del MaGuey Vida Mezcal, Boston Chamomile Bittahs, all topped w/ fresh ground nutmeg) which was like a Red Hots themed cocktail. When it came time to snag one last drink, I finished off the night w/ a most delicious Bitter End (Rum, Ruby Red Grapefruit Juice, Lemon Juice, Maple Syrup, Swizzle Bitters &amp; Egg White w/ a mint leaf garnish). Drinks are obviously their strength here.  Decor is modern &amp; stylish, while still rockin' the down-to-earth vibe. The crowd also couldn't have been nicer... maybe that's just the fag hag in me talking, but hittin' up this gay bar was definitely fun.  TIPS: +Bring cash, cuz this is a cash-only bar. ATM is in the back in case you forget. +Be prepared for a short wait. I was surprised to find there was a bit of a line when I got there.",

Something more than well liquor slung with some nondescript mixer with a lime thrown in.   Blackbird's specialty cocktail menu is short a simple, and I hope that's the way it stays. We visited last night (a very busy Tuesday!) and sampled almost one of everything on the menu. All of them were good, but the aged bourbon drinks were a tad strong.   Everything was carefully crafted, tested and consistent.  And the prices are very, very reasonable. $8 for most cocktails, $10 for the aged bourbon ones. Mixed drinks are a reasonable size, but not as substantial as you might expect. (Think \"sipping drinks\" that you should imbibe slowly and as thoughtfully as they were created.)   Beer ran from $5 on up. This may sound expensive, but considering the quality of the drinks, it's really not. If you're looking to get toasted on cheap liquor, head somewhere else.   Along side Cantina, this may be my new favorite \"fancy cocktail\" bar in San Francisco!  Also note: Clean bathrooms, an eclectic mix of seemingly nice people, a charming and tastefully decorated space with plenty of places to sit, stand, lean and hang out.

It's a cocktail sanctuary where you go to sip on your favorite libation and relax. At night, the lights are dimmed and the atmosphere becomes boisterous. Dozens of people congregate around sipping their drinks, and it can feel crowded.  Nonetheless, the cocktails are consistent, inventive, and delicious. Bartenders are knowledgeable and polite. They can get busy later at night but they're very responsive in general.   During happy hour, there are drink specials such as $6 old-fashioneds and $6 margaritas, $6 du jour cocktails (which they had a choice of two the day I came in), and $4 wells. Beers are equally cheap.   So depending on what mood you're in, go in the early afternoon for a more chill experience or late at night for a livelier scene. There's a pool table in the back to take the edge off too. And enjoy your cocktail.",

    "review_text": "Blackbird is one of the best bars in SF right now. Its relatively new ('09 is when it became the blackbird post a remodel and new ownership), and ever since its stock has risen while the Castro has gone kind of toe up in reputation among the younger crowd who wants to avoid badlands-esque joints.  First off, is Market and Church really the Castro? Blackbird goes beyond the typical Castro vibe. Its a neighborhood bar that is just that: a real bar, with real locals, and real drinks (although some are a bit too sugary for my taste). I think deep down we all wish that this 'neighborhood' was our actual lives... because the real bar is really awesome, the real locals are really hot, and the real drinks are really good.  The place feels like a dive bar that somehow caught on and became trendy and hip. The crowd is stylish and put together, but also laid back enough to have that after--venturecapitalist--work vibe.  Pool tables in the back are a nice touch. I love the walls plastered with SF history through newspapers, and the brown butcher drink menu done on paper rolls pulled down off the walls. Another great touch is the actual mild mix of straight guys and the dash of females that find themselves frequenting the spot of the summer. Other positives include a decently regulated door, a huge drink menu, fresh ingredients, friendly bartenders, and the occasional latenight tamale lady.   Don't know where to go tonight? Go check out Blackbird before everyone else in SF realizes how legit it is. Or they start charging cover. Or someone adds a dancefloor. Or they get rid of the pool tables for a Rupaul competition stage.   ...not that I don't like Rupaul competition stages...",

    "review_text": "As someone who prefers to drink at restaurant and hotel bars, \u00a0I have to say Blackbird is my favorite social spot in SF, and not just because it's a most welcome haven in greater Castro where one can get an actual cocktail (and not just a mixed drink). \u00a0The second time I came in, there were gaggles of people at the \u00a0bar, but Brent not only remembered my drink of choice (at the time it was a Blood and Sand), but what type of scotch I take. \u00a0Since then I've started roosting there 2-3 times a week, often before flying south for dinner in the Mission.  What makes this bar unique is that it's a natural habitat for two very different species: those who want to grab a bottle of Miller High Life and shoot pool with their buddies, as well as those who prefer to discuss French symbolist poetry over a Death in the Afternoon. \u00a0In a town where birds of a feather tend to flock together, this is a refreshing change of scene.  A few things you should know about the aviary before you alight upon a stool:  - The crow bar is not a gay establishment. \u00a0Sure there's a fair share of coxcombs preening in the window on any given night, but it's not exactly La cage aux folles either. \u00a0The crowd is always mixed, and it's actually not a bad place to meet people.  - Right now the bar is CASH ONLY but there is an ATM available.  - The discerning ornithologist should know that if you don't ask for spirits by brand, they are going to pour WELL liquor, even in their specialty cocktails (and it's not the kind of place that has Bluecoat and Bulleit in their well, either). \u00a0 I made that mistake my first time in the bar, then quoth this raven \"Nevermore!\"  - Take a gander at the menu, and you'll notice that just about everything is on the sweet side. \u00a0 Even their version of the Negroni (generally a bitter drink) borders on cloying. \u00a0This is not to fault the bartenders in any way, since the clientele seem to like their drinks that way. \u00a0However, if you prefer your cocktails on the dry side, just ask. \u00a0You won't ruffle anyone's feathers. \u00a0And nothing says you have to order from the menu. \u00a0Most of the bartenders are happy to wing it if you tell them what you like.  - When it's busy, don't even think about ordering anything \"up\" unless you plan to perch at the long shelf adjacent to the front door. \u00a0Otherwise you will end up wearing most of your $10 Paloma cocktail.   - After a long day of work, TIffany is a regular Florence Nightingale, both for her barside manner and her uncanny ability to concoct potent elixirs to ease your every ill.  A welcome addition to the neighborhood, and a strong 4 and a half stars. \u00a0A little more variety on the menu (add one or two clean, balanced cocktails) and a better wine list (although, seriously... who comes for the wine?) would make it five.",

Location: The best of locations, right on Church and Market and accessible to anyone and everyone using any means of transportation. And most importantly, walking distance for me.  Space: Beautiful, hip decor. I like the fact that they hide the pool table, because, seriously, pool tables at bars are unsightly. There's newspaper wallpaper, exposed lightbulbs, a beautiful bar, and red accents all throughout to illuminate the otherwise dark bar. I love the seating styles and the front of the bar, from the outside, looks pretty nice.  Ambiance: A good, diverse crowd. Everyone was friendly enough. There were a good amount of homos, lesbos, people of color, white folk, men, women, young, old (I'm not kidding) and specially, beautiful people--almost as if it were planned. I don't remember the music though...  Service: Great service! Specially Nancy, she was great. Attentive, fair with prices, took suggestions gracefully and knew her stuff. She made some great suggestions that worked out splendidly.  Food/Drink: Great drinks! Sure, specially because I know exactly how I live my cocktails and the bartenders followed my instructions quite diligently and put some great insight and suggestions of their own. We had a Manhattan, a Cosmopolitan and a Vesper. They have Lillet Blanc and actually use Cointreau for the cosmos! You can't ask for much more. And most importantly, it's cheap!  Overall: After a tragic experience at my favorite bar, Amber, this is probably heading to be my new favorite bar. Great service, great ambience, beautiful and well thought-out space and, most importantly, great drinks.",

I don't dig that the place is cash only. I mean, really? Who carries cash these days? They do have an ATM machine in the back- which charges $2.50 for withdrawal.   Boyfriend ordered whiskey &amp; coke- and I asked the bartender to surprise me with a tequilia-based drink. (I love me my tequila!) I'm not a huge fan of sweet, and told him so. I think he took that and ran with it- because the only thing I really ended up tasting in my drink was bitters. I had about two sips before I decided to give up on it.  The crowd is eclectic- but primarily gays and hipsters. I dug being out of my comfort zone and we met some great people at the table next to us.  I don't dig the height level of the tables- our knees were knocking in to them the whole time. It's kinda awkward seating.",

Some were so special, they had been aged for years instead of months! Boy does that add some extra flavor to your drink. Not sure if I am a mature enough drinker to handle the oak and medicine-like flavors, but it's fun learning to appreciate. If you are a Negroni or Fernet fan, Blackbird's versions will hit the spot!  Not quite ready to dive into fancy cocktails that are a bit younger (like, straight from the tap), the Pilsner is quite good. And it's served in a giant mug. Can't go wrong with giant mugs ;)   A little chickadee (not a Blackbird but something like it), told me that these guys are going to make some updates to the joint later this year, perhaps incorporating bar bites into the menu...

We exchanged words and he finally made me a drink that was not a gimlet but I drank anyways because I didn't want to deal with any more attitude. \u00a0This has actually happened to me a couple of other times, and I have recently clarified with bartenders elsewhere. I think the recent cocktail scene has confused people a bit. Cut it with the attitude....I don't bring it and a bartender certainly shouldn't. I gave the place 3 stars because I used to like it and the first bartender made a drink any bartender should know how to make and had no problem with me nicely telling her how to make it since this is a common problem I'm having....otherwise it would be 1. By the way, the only places that aren't confused by me ordering a tequila gimlet are bars that have old school bartenders and patrons that don't need a menu to order a drink!",

My drink had a bit of gin and cardamom which I thought was an odd mixture but turned out to be just great. Everyone was friendly and the place had a decent sized crowd, not too many people and not too little. I will definitely be coming back to this place.

I loved the cool, cartoony artwork on the walls so much that I asked the bartender if they were for sale. They were but for well over $1000!  My brother picked out his favorite kind of alcohol (it's something I can't remember the name of, fruit flavored and yummy!) and the bartender created a delicious concoction with it.

The butcher-paper menu offers intriguing specialities with ingredients you won't find in your average bar. Normally I like to stick to my same drink, but I had to experiment here.  I really liked the cucumber-infused Pimms Cup. And the light and citrusy Early Bird satisfied my newfound fondness of St. Germain. My only gripe is that my Dark &amp; Stormy should've been a well drink at their happy hour price - but here it was $8.   - Pool tables in the back.  - Narrow but spacious with a good amount of seating. - Not overly crowded, although I was here on a Monday night so I can't attest to the weekends. - Cash only.",

Farmer's Daughter - very nice, sour lemon, not too sweet, refreshing  Ghost Ship - also very nice, green tea flavor, not too sweet  The Temptress - universally panned by the entire group of 6, taste was reminiscent of cough syrup, finished as a shot divided among two people as no one wanted to drink it but didn't want it to go to waste either  The Chieftain - overwhelming taste of smoke, like drinking a camp fire, not balanced out by other flavors  Where There's Smoke There's Fire - a light smoky flavor, not as intense as The Chieftain, followed by medium heat, interesting but not terribly satisfying  Given that I disliked many of the cocktails on the current menu, I'll probably wait for it to change before revisiting.",

Since I first came by in January, it's definitely gotten more crowded (though you can still push your way through the crowd and if you're paying attention, snag a table even at 10pm on a Saturday).  The crowd is an interesting mixture of Mission/hipster and Castro.   Still love the dark setting, old fashioned lightbulbs hanging by the wire over the bar, dark wood paneling, artistically cut/broken up wood board partial ceiling, and I really really like the tables that are essentially slabs of concrete that someone went to town at with a sledgehammer.  The bartender was definitely a little abrupt - I said \"I like something light and refreshi-\" and he immediately said \"Early Bird.\" I asked if they take card and he just said \"Cash only\" and stared at me. No chit chat, no smiles. In the end I really did like my drink, but he could've been a little friendlier.  Shout-out to the cool dude checking IDs at the front - very chill, friendly, and I loved these awesome tattoos he had on his knees: one was the face of a lion/tiger, the other a dragon. Really unique and quite bad-ass.  Cocktail menu: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blackbird-san-francisco?select=31G3NnrZiU2rwDbUFW1oqA#31G3NnrZiU2rwDbUFW1oqA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/blac\u2026</a>  * The Sumo Wrestler - 3.5 stars (Evan Williams Bourbon, Nigori Sake, Yuzu. $9) I watched the bartender make this and he adds \u00a0some sort of jam/marmalade to it! Really interesting. The flavor was very good, but bourbon always comes out too strong to me as a base. But for a bourbon drink this was quite good.  * Early Bird - 4 stars (Vodka, St. Germain, Lemon, Soda. $8) Light and refreshing, nice tart taste, just what I asked for. Nice!",

They had a bunch of interesting drinks and I had the hot toddy which felt like a warm cozy tea. The bartenders were very friendly and paid a lot of attention to the drink they were making and did not rush anything. I also tried the Manhattan which was a bit too strong for my taste, but for people who love strong drinks, it should be right up their alley.They also have quiet a few non alcoholic options - mocktails/sodas. Also, check out the pool table in the back. The only annoying part was it's cash only, so be ready for that.",

It took until my 6th or 7th time going here to realize they had a cocktail menu, which, while nice, none of the drinks are really my cup of tea.  I like it because i can come here and have a few beers, play pool in the back (i love the fact that there's a change machine right next to the ATM), and hang out for a couple hours. It seems like a lot of people use this as a starter bar, because around 12:30 it starts to clear out and you're not fighting for a spot at the bar and you can find a seat more easily.  Anytime someone suggests meeting at a bar in the Castro, this is the one i prefer.",

Did I try any of them?NO. And you know why because when you wait close to 20 minute just to order, with really rude and equally miffed patrons with their elbows crammed into your spinal cord when you finally get waited on 1) I personally felt like an asshole asking a severely overwhelmed bartender to make me some intense specialty cocktail 2) that drink probably would tack on another 5-9 minutes to the equation. I know cause while waiting I took great interest in watching various drinks being made with care, and with no bullshit , they looked AMAZING. I hate words like mixology and foodies , but the people who work here are totally talented I could see. And I blame them not for this hellhole . I should have known starting with a line at the door, for a bar, on Market Street, a cartwheel away from Lucky 13? REALLY? The space is realllllly dimly lit. Maybe too dimly lit I have horrible eyesight and I'm aged. Some chick was screaming multiple times about doing meth /being on meth /offering people meth. I was not aware meth is the new social drug but apparently I'm wrong . I'm so out of touch at 32. You can't hear anything when you are trying to talk. The whole thing is just a NO, I won't be back. BUT shouts out to the bartender, brunette guy , tattoos , beard, not sure if you are team Penis or team Vagina but it was an absolute honor to salivate over your hotness for 25 minutes. When you furiously shook things to create alcoholic magic it touched me in an absolutely sacred place. I will dream about you ...forever. But goodbye Blackbird, fare thee well, peace in the middle east y'all",

Cheers for sure~  I came here for a friend's birthday and we managed to squeeze our group of 10+ people along the small tables in the back, despite not having a reservation. Even though the interior echoed really loudly, my friends and I enjoyed the atmosphere and would come back again for drinks in the area. I need to try the photobooth and/or play a game of pool next time!  In addition, the bathrooms are single rooms and actually kept pretty clean. This is always worth noting in bars. ;)",

Then, if you've not done so yet, you should check out Blackbird. There drinks are always top notch quality, and you'll enjoy sampling each and every one. They even have the drink menus change, so you can always try something new.   It could easily be a 5-star place, but there are only a few problems that I've always run into.   Now, everyone knows that when something is good, everyone will eventually find out about it and overwhelm it. Unfortunately, that's the case with this bar. The first is that this place is crazy busy all the time. 9 times out of 10, you'll find yourself waiting in line to get in. Sometimes it can be pretty fast, but you should be prepared to wait about 5 of 10 minutes. Once you get inside, you'll see that the place is packed and that you'll be waiting in line again for your drink. If you find something on the menu that sounds yummy, there's a definite chance that the wait will be worth it. Just be sure to watch those around you. You'll most likely run into people who will maybe jump in front of you. Just keep those elbows ready to push them back. :)  The second issue is that, every now-and-then, I run into a rude bartender. It seems that they have a bad day, or just don't completely understand good customer service. They either help everyone else around you without even glancing at you, or they help you but with a bad attitude.  I'd suggest visiting them, and perhaps trying it out a little early in the night to avoid the crazy mob scene.",

Poached pear is more tart due to the red wine. &amp; Pimms cup is there to satisfy your sweet tooth! Just watching the bartender crush the strawberry will make you salivate!

The cocktail I had was excellent and service was friendly and polite. However I am writing this review as I feel like I have been ignored several times during a busy night. I've done everything in the bar etiquette book in hopes of ordering a drink without being an annoyance to the bartender. I was right on the bar between two seated patrons. \u00a0I waited a solid 30 minutes without even a look while the area in front of \u00a0him was getting served like crazy. \u00a0I had already tried earlier in the night with the same bartender but I was behind someone for about 15 minutes before he gave up so I gave up too. \u00a0Yet strangely my friend who was dressed slightly nicer than me walked up and was able to order our drinks with no issues. \u00a0He didn't wave money or yell the guy just noticed him. \u00a0 The bottom line was I liked this bar at one time but this second adventure put a bad taste in my mouth enough to write this review. \u00a0I was disappointed because I really wanted to try his drinks and enjoy them because I liked the care he put into everyone. \u00a0But it's just hard to enjoy anything when one feels ignored.  As a follow up I was written to and received a very sincere apology regarding my experience. \u00a0I am always impressed by this and look forward to giving Blackbird another try.",

It's interior is very cool and modern, the clientele is pretty, the bartenders are great (a few from the Transfer, which used to be my ultimate fav before it was taken over by the gross BOC), there's a photo booth and pool table which are both necessary bar things, in my opinion...yet there's something about this place that makes me never want to go there.   I can hardly ever hear the music it's so low, the table between the benches is too big so you can never hear the people sitting in the chairs across from you, it's a little pricey for happy hour, although I realize it's hard to compete with Castro insanity prices, and even though I enjoy the cool, sometimes the people there are just too cool for me.  It's possible this place just might not be the bar for me because I go to bars to 1. talk to my friends, 2. listen to music, and 3. relax. It's also possible I need a hearing aid and shouldn't go here expecting it to fulfill my dive-y needs.

I had the day off and made it to the bar around 4ish but did the rest of the folks make a beeline straight from work to the Castro, knocking aside anyone who stood in their way of getting after work libations?   I wouldn't be the surprised because the bartenders take their time to make the delicious cocktails. \"My Clementine\" was a delicious citrus concoction with a subtle hint of honey that masks quite a bit of clementine vodka. Beer drinkers have no fear for they have a fantastic list of brews on tap ranging from Alaskan Amber to the ever delicious Brother Thelonius. Beers during happy hour run you between $3-5.

Straddling the line between casual and sophisticated, Blackbird is a place where everyone can feel comfortable. And more importantly, enjoy well-crafted cocktails and microbrew beers.   Much has been said of the specialty cocktails, and with good reason. They are really good! The hand-drawn menu recalls a time of yesteryear, as do some of the exotic ingredients. Who even knew there was such a thing as \"tobacco bitters?!\" The bartenders are all knowledgeable, friendly, and highly-skilled in the art of mixology.   The daily happy hour is amazing, and a great introduction to the Blackbird scene, though at times incredibly crowded; something to keep in mind if you're looking for a quiet place to relax after work.   Another nice touch is the revolving artwork by local artists, which usually incorporates some sort of San Francisco imagery.   Attractive on multiple levels, Blackbird draws a very mixed crowd, though its proximity to the Castro generally means that the gay crowd is well-represented. But this is almost always balanced by the presence of plenty of other gay-friendly folk, all enjoying the warm, welcoming enclave that is Blackbird.",

Though I knew from its Castro location that it would not live up to the standards implied by its logo, Lady Pestlebottom and I happened to be wandering by and decided to stop in for a drink. It's not often we're in the Castro, you know. For good reason - the crushing and overwhelming modernity of it all.   It was not as terribly obnoxious as most Castro watering holes, but I found the decor uninspiring, the patrons bland and without style or character, and the overall atmosphere loud and busy, yet boring. The last time I had patronized this particular space was when it was somewhat of a sports-oriented dive (albeit a clean sort of dive). The place is completely unrecognizable now. It's terribly, horrifyingly \"hip,\" as many here have pointed out.   The beer selection consisted mostly of craft beers which I've never heard of (so hip!), so I decided to be adventurous and try the one named after moving-picture actress Tallulah Bankhead. It was adequate. Lady Pestlebottom ordered some overpriced, fruity libation which she enjoyed, which she now conspires to make at home (just as I did with the delicious and even more overpriced cocktail at the even more nauseatingly hip Bourbon &amp; Branch).   The barmaid was very nice, so that's something. It was an alright place to stop in for one drink, but we do not feel compelled to return.",

He called me back right away and let me know that he could reserve a spot for my group and I. This place was perfect because it has a pool table and photo booth in the back which (in my book) is always a plus! The space is narrow but has a lot of seating space for several groups to enjoy their time. The drink menu is tasty and the all around vibe of the place is great!

Sounds like a manly drink right? WRONG. It comes in a coupe... google it and tell me you don't think it's for a pinky out kind of drink .  Anyway, it was quite tasty, so I got over my insecurities of holding a girlie cup pretty quick. Happy hour from 5-8? Sold! I'm also intrigued by the awesome beer selection. They have Black Butte on draft which is one of my favs. Come check this place out. It has a great vibe and I can't wait to return.

We found a nice area of the bar towards the front but on the side, away from the throngs that come in to order drinks. So we got to watch the mixologists in action. And they are indeed mixologists! They mixed those drinks with such care and artistry. And the drinks we had were soo good! I tried one item from their menu, the Pimms Cup and that was so good! $9.. that's amazing value. And my favorite drink Sidecar was only $8! Usually you pay $10-14 in the city!  Vibe of the place was very laid back, a good mix of people. Young, old, gay straight, men, women. I'm a fan!",

But sadly, this last experience makes me wonder what happened.   Strike 1: I ask the man, who we later learn is the bartender, propping open the front door, \"Is the bar open?\" He responds, \"Well, we are now.\" [Not the best way to welcome your first guests. No smile. No eye contact.]  Strike 2: The same guy hands us a couple of menus. Based on experience at other bars, I ask another question, \"Is it OK if I order drinks not on the menu?\" He responds, \"That's a really bizarre question. Look behind me, this is a bar. You can order whatever you want.\" [Again, what was with the attitude? We were the only 2 people there.]  Strike 3: He gives us a minute, which gives me a moment to talk with my wife. That's when we notice all of the fruit flies feasting on the garnishes and fruit lining the bar. [Are those yesterday's garnishes? Are they fresh? Did you not notice the fruit fly infestation prior to opening the doors? Sorry, I don't want that in my drink.]  It's ironic that the front window says, \"Leave all pretensions at the door,\" when there was a whole bunch of it behind the bar.  TL;DR - The bartender was very rude, we were grossed out by the flies, we didn't order a drink, and we politely excused ourselves.",

One where we might occasionally make out after a few drinks (but I won't go any further, I swear!).   This is a great cross between being divey/chill and trendy/fun. It's a very long and narrow bar with lots of seats and tables (made out of bark?) all down the left-hand side. There are some old school red diner booths in the back that sandwich an old pool table. Some of the walls have old school SF Inquirer front pages (and by \"old-school,\" I mean JFK and WWII style). Other walls have paintings and funky lights.

The drinks here are good, especially taking into consideration of the fresh ingredients they have available for the drinks. \u00a0I did notice that the bartender was able to make my drinks, and if he didn't know he quickly found out from another bartender (my Kentucky mint julep for example), and learned my shot later, buffalo sweat, was bourbon and Tabasco. \u00a0I will say the bartender was rude at one point, and is part of the reason why knocking them a star. \u00a0If you start out asking me what I'm ordering, and then immediately turn to the person next to me and flirt with her before coming back and asking me what my drink is again, I'm not going to be a happy camper.  The other point I didn't really care for was when the place got packed. \u00a0It was really hard to move throughout the bar, and it took a fair amount of time to get through the crowd to actually get another drink.  The crowd here is mixed, yet is certainly well-balanced from what I could tell. \u00a0For this seemingly being a straight/gay bar, it seemed to lean slightly more towards gay scene. \u00a0In any regard, a few guys certainly caught my eye.  All-in-all, another great bar to hit up when it isn't packed. \u00a0I would certainly check it out even though it is a few blocks away from Castro.",

Now, when you're at the top of your class, you know it. Especially when it's super crowded, certain bartenders have been complete dicks. You can cut them some slack via artist's temperament, but, I just don't think any unprovoked situation warrants assholery, and I'd suggest they restrict entry better if there are too many people for them to handle. Obviously that doesn't dent my feelings about their booze, but I've seen the behavior enough to confirm it happens and I don't like it either.

My companion commented that it has the \"outside, inside\" feel, like Blue Bayou restaurant at Disneyland. I cannot affirm or deny this \u00a0claim as I've (gasp!) never been, but I nonetheless agree. The suspended ceiling of uneven planks and rough-hewn stone tables make one side of the space feel sort of like being at the beach, while the gorgeous wood bar on the opposite side is evocative of a classy old saloon circa Gold Rush era SF. As DID as that may sound, it all works together really nicely, and comfortably. Oh, and I dug the current paintings, as well.  All I can say about the drinks (as I didn't try any of their signatures), is that their well selection is completely acceptable, and they were served with care.

As all my good friends on Yelp know, I love birds...how could I not love a place to imbibe with a bird theme called Blackbird? :) \u00a0Fantastic place and also just walking distance from Lucky 13 which is within stumbling distance for when you want to explore the darker side of barhopping. \u00a0In a crazy way, the two complement each other perfectly. \u00a0As always, I am eclectic and refuse to change.",

And to be very honest, I've never enjoyed a Manhattan more than Nancy's.   Black bird was very enjoyable, because all around me, there was something cool to look at. People were doing their own thing, Tom Edison style bulbs lit the mahogany bar, a simple menu written on parchment, and warm red accents added to an overall encompassing environment. Very nicely done.   Don't taint this place or I'll cut you. Only reason I am dropping down a star is because of the clientele; there were some drunk a holes. Not totally Blackbird's fault but I would have cut them off sooner. \u00a0Still, amazing.",

The bartender was amazing (man... I wish I wasn't so flighty on names...) and let us know about all the best ingredients. Gin, Campari and vermouth with a little orange zest.... simple right? Not really.... Apparently, he's a fan of the negroni, too so he filled us in on what he thinks makes the best negroni which I found to be very educational. Which led us to trying several different types of negroni to determine which we liked best... and we did find a winner.  Beyond the awesome negroni and bartender, this place is really nicely decorated inside with red leather seats, white walls, and cool art on the walls. I really enjoyed being there. It was open enough (tall ceilings!) that even with a bunch of people, it didn't feel stuffy which is important if you're like me and hate crowds.  On thing I can say is that I will be back to try the Apple Cart (Applejack, rose vermouth, cassis, lemon and lavendar) because that just sounds A-MAZING but didn't sound like it went too well with the negroni feast we were having!

    "review_text": "I'm somewhat ambivalent about my experience at Blackbird. My Yelp friends all seem to adore it, so perhaps the evening that I popped in was uncharacteristic of the true Blackibird experience.  We dropped in on a Sunday evening after having dinner at a neighboring restaurant. At the time, Blackbird wasn't very busy; only a handful of patrons were consuming libations at the bar. We took our seats and the female bartender provided us with some menus to peruse.   Immediately, after looking at the menu, Blackbird ushered in memories of Noble Experiment in San Diego. It showcased similar types of unique cocktails that one can find at the forbidden Noble. You know, Noble Experiment, that rather ostentatious hole-in-wall (literally), at Neighborhood, that is overrated? To Blackbird's credit, I didn't sense an ostentatious ambience; rather, the only thing I sensed was a less-than-courteous demanor from the bartender. She seemed consumed with tending to her friend(s) that happened to be customers, and we, as I took it, ended up being nothing but distractions to her social life.   Nevertheless, we each had two cocktails. In all honesty, I wasn't very impressed. I remember ordering The Shakedown, a bourbon-inspired cocktail, and wasn't wowed. I moved on to the Silly Rabbit and was also underwhelmed. I don't know, perhaps ordering these types of specialized drinks are just not my cup of tea. Paying upwards of $10-12 for a cocktail should be memorable in a good way. Sadly, the drinks I had at Blackbird weren't. Maybe I should just stick to those drinks that I know will do my liver right everytime: \u00a0a vodka pineapple or margarita.",

I love their cocktails...Earlybird is my fave (lemon/vodka/st.germaine). The bartenders were nice and were really fast. And I love the fact the women's bathroom never had a line! Hah",

    "review_text": "The cocktails here are very tasty, perhaps relying a little too much on being 'unique', and at $10 each they are a little pricey. I would recommend Blackbird as a good place to stop in for one drink before moving on or heading home. This is in part due to the awful seating available. The low tables are exactly at knee height. This means you have to spread your legs far and wide to be able to lean in across the table - that is if you intend to have a conversation over the loud background noise.",

The bar tender was so inattentive I had to talk the bar-back into pouring me a drink...which DID get the bartenders attention for some reason, funny because my pretty face and fist full of cash sure didn't.   2 Stars for having booze.  -3 for not being the Expansion.",

It's really different from what the Metro was, however, for being a dive--it comes with a great ambiance, style, and a nice retro feel to the place.  The photo booth is a good place to document those drunken stories.  We entered it three times, that night.  It's a nice crowd, some trying too hard--but some, who looked like they'd be well equipped to try a few things... on you.  Blackbird, I will be back.",
