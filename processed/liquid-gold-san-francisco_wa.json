Obviously my expectations were high, but fortunately for me this place met - nay - EXCEEDED them.  Liquid Gold not only has excellent selection of local beers on tap, but they have several fridges of tall boys to buy and carry out OR enjoy right there at the bar (with corkage fees of course). Many of the beers I saw in the fridges I have never seen elsewhere too, which gives this place some serious points.  If you like City Beer Store, then you'll enjoy this place as well. CBS may have a larger selection of purchasable beers, but Liquid Gold has a better draft line in my opinion. Also, pound for pound (drop for drop?) I think LG has a better selection of beer given their space.  Finally, the owner, Tim, seems like a very genuine guy. He's always been exceedingly friendly, helpful and very willing to bring in beer that you want to see on his shelves. He's a local boy, too, so you know he's got his finger on the pulse of the beer industry of the area.  Final word: Liquid Gold is exactly what this neighborhood needed!",

The intense then jubilant atmosphere was like nothing I've ever experienced, add to that, friendly knowledgable staff serving 30 locally brewed beers and selected wines. \u00a0Champagne was pouring the second Giants took the championship with a 3-2 win, CLASS! \u00a0You ask, what can beat that? Well....  2nd visit, 3 pm on a Monday afternoon! \u00a0The owner, Tim Lee greeted me warmly. \u00a0He was with a sales rep introducing selected wines from a winery in Paso Robles. \u00a0Being one of a few patrons in the bar (door just opened), Tim asked if I would like to participate in doing some tasting of the wines the sales rep brought. \u00a0An offer I cannot refuse! I love wine!! I got to taste one of their rare Chardonnay they sell on tap, a Cabernet and Sangiovese. \u00a0All delicious and tasty! \u00a0I hope Liquid Gold will be serving these wines in the future.  3rd visit, Friday night, me and a couple of girlfriends came here to have a few beers and wine before dinner. \u00a0They each had 2 beer flights. \u00a0A tasting of 4 different beers suggested by the knowledgeable staff depending on your taste. \u00a0I had their Cellars 33 Chardonnay on tap. \u00a0Loved it! \u00a0They even had a bubbly on the menu that night. \u00a0All tasty and delicious. \u00a0  I love the comfort of the bar. \u00a0Although I prefer the bar seats, they also offer a cozy couch and a long table with bench seating for bigger groups. \u00a0The vibrant atmosphere and decors from a map of San Francisco, \"415\" area code sign, to the black and white photos along the long wall of the bar gives it a \"homey\" feeling! \u00a0  Liquid Gold also offers \"to go\" beers. \u00a0They carry a huge selection of rare and specialty beers in their large refrigerator located in the back of the bar. The 30 beer taps and wine selections are changed constantly so I know I will be back for more tasting.",

    "review_text": "Liquid Gold is a great neighborhood beer bar and shop, located on Hyde. Our crowd of 4 people found an easy spot to settle for a nightcap. The space is basically long and narrow-- the bar itself runs along a majority of the right wall, with a majority of seats along the bar. I don't know if this would be the best spot for a large group-- we were there on a Thursday evening, so the crowd situation was very easy to manage. However, I couldn't imagine a group of 6+ people being able to sit comfortably and converse as a group.  As you would guess, they have a great selection of beers on tap, as well as an extensive fridge of bottled beer. A digital menu shows their offerings, although I found it a bit difficult to read (Perhaps I'm getting old).   We only stayed for one drink, and \"last call\" was announced around 10:30, so this isn't a late-night spot, but more of a post-dinner spot. \u00a0I didn't take tons of time to peruse, but the bottled beer selection was extensive. I can imagine that it serves the Nob/Russian hill clientele very well-- especially after shopping at Trader Joe's across the street.",

    "review_text": "Finally, it's open! \u00a0 When I first went to Mikkeller bar, just after it opened, I was incensed at the frou frou glasses beer was served in. \u00a0Beer in wine glases... \u00a0 Age teaches you many things (if you're willing to learn, or else you become one of those horrid old men walking down the street cursing the world, aloud) and one of them is to recognize an Issue, and when to simply accept that something isn't going away. \u00a0Frou frou beer glasses aren't going away. \u00a0I'm not even going to waste time on the idea. \u00a0Liquid Gold is one of those new beer bars with Frou Frou glasses.  Lots of beer to choose from, from several taps behind the bar---although they don't produce any of their own, and I didn't notice any cask capacity, and didn't think to inquire. \u00a0I confined myself to IPAs, amazed to discover the range available just in that one style---and one I thought I knew! \u00a0The staff, one of which was the owner, was quite friendly, pleasant, and easy to talk to. \u00a0And it turned out that one of our bar stool neighbors was an employee of Drakes, and so even more beer knowledge was available for the asking. \u00a0 All in all a very fine afternoon, and then, as we left, around five, the bar began to fill up.  It's a long, narrow space with high ceilings, bar on one side, bathroom and cooler in the rear. \u00a0It's all done in a battle ship gray paint, with a vinyl coated wood bar that looks gray as well. \u00a0The cooler is amply stocked with bottles of beer, not limited to that which is on tap...  And that is the one gripe I have with this bar.  Wine is available ONLY by the bottle. \u00a0And if you buy wine, or beer by the bottle, \u00a0you have to pay a corkage fee as well. \u00a0Now why is this? \u00a0 Corkage fees exist to allow businesses to make some money off of those who insist on bringing their own wine to a restaurant, and to discourage customers from doing so, especially this close to wine country. \u00a0Why is a bar that is selling beer, and wine by the bottle, with its own mark-up, also adding a corkage fee? \u00a0I don't understand, and I DON'T like it. \u00a0I'd take away a star if there wasn't so much beer available on tap, such that I don't see any need to buy a bottle. \u00a0 If this wasn't a Beer Bar, I'd also be miffed that I can't order wine by the glass, but it is a Beer Bar so expecting wine is something like eschewing Rum at a tiki bar.  So, all is well and I wish this bar good success and hope to make it one of my haunts.",

Actually it reminds me of that place a lot. It's just far enough from the hustle and bustle of Polk, but just close enough that you can walk to a more crowded bar.  It's unfortunately only open until midnight, but that's just another reason why I think it would be great for a quick date / meet up. I had my Uber driver drop me off here, and he asked me if I was going to Trader Joe's. This was around 8 30 pm on a Saturday. No, sir, I am not. I am going to the bar across the street.

You can get a beer flight for $12 and either pick what you like or have the experts behind the bar cater to your taste profile.  The owner is attempting to keep mainly local brews on draft. I was hoping for a wide variety that may include other regions and I was not disappointed. 2 IPAs blew me away and were better than my current favorite, Alpine Brewing Co.'s \"Nelson.\" They also have a large fridge in the back where they sell lots of high end stuff by the bottle.

For that, I really want to give five stars but kept it at three due to being priced higher than it should.   Basically all pours are 12 oz. (believe there may be a couple that are 10 oz.). Totally get that--some beers, whether due to rarity, high ABV, ingredients etc. are going to be different prices and different size pours. The issue here is the brews that are more widely produced (and retail for $8 a six-pack) should be a $5 or $6 16 oz. pint and instead are a $7 or $8 12 oz. pour.   End of the world? Absolutely not; especially considering some of the great beers they bring in. But in general, it's priced too high for me to be able to go as much as I do other places of its ilk. Being a brand new place, there's a chance those prices dip down once they establish themselves and build revenue.  At any rate, a very nice addition to the neighborhood and worth checking out.",
