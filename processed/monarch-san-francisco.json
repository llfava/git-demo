The crowd downstairs is there for the music which is a plus. Great vibe. Highly recommend it especially if you are looking to get down.",

    "review_text": "My BF &amp; I were apprehensive about visiting Monarch because a friend described it as \"divey.\" But we were both pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed it and Monarch turned out to be a bar favorite during our latest trip to San Francisco!   We popped in on a Monday night to hang out with a bunch of co-workers and were greeted by a friendly bartender who introduced himself by saying \"I make a mean Tom Collins.\" While he mixed up our drinks we sang along to a fantastically fun mix of 80s and 90s tunes. There's a ring for an aerialist that hangs in the backdrop of the bar and we remarked on how cool that would be to watch during a busy night. While hanging out my BF &amp; I took some photos in their totally free photo booth. After you take your four poses, the booth emails you your photos AND it prints out a copy. We have a great souvenir from our visit there and kudos to Monarch for having such a super marketing tool! We didn't get to check out the nightclub downstairs but we're pretty sure that the bar upstairs is much more our style.  My friends warned me that Monarch was located in a seedy part of town but not being from San Francisco, I didn't know what that really meant. I walked there with my BF and a co-worker and I will definitely say that this is not an area that you want to be walking around alone. We ran across a few sketchy characters during our journey there. While waiting for a cab we noticed that one out of every 10 cars driving by was a cop car and on that particular night there was a shakedown across the way. At least you know if something goes down, there's lots of five-O in the area!  Yelp 365 Challenge: #190/365 (The Trip To Sketchville)",

There is no dance area I see upstairs. \u00a0Just a bar, and a place to \"lounge\" in another room. \u00a0DJs appear to be building their skills in the craft and you see their electronics out in the open, as oppose to usually they are high on a podium jamming. \u00a0The place is small, so the point seems to be just to mingle. \u00a0  Downstairs is where the club dancing is more capable. \u00a0There is a DJ and bar there as well. \u00a0The dance floor is more like your downstairs garage or basement with pillars in the way. \u00a0They have a crystal ball and light works to jam the night with appropriate loud sound system. \u00a0I would say Monarch is good if you don't like large crowds and huge event scenery clubs.   The beer(Heinekein was $4.00 a bottle). \u00a0  The worst part about this place is the location. \u00a06th and Mission is not exactly a safe place to be in San Francisco especially at night which is likely the times open for this place to meet people. \u00a0So go with friends.",

So if you are looking to get a table for a group you will want to get there early. The decor is beautiful, which is one of the things that enticed me, but overall I was really unimpressed with the staff. The bartenders apparently can't multi-task for shit because if a decadent drink was ordered the entire bar line came to a standstill while we waited for the bartender to make ONE drink. Having bartended in the past myself, to me they came off as inexperienced. Second of all, one bartender charged me one price for my drink and when I went to refill from the other bartender I was quoted a different price. When I quoted what the first bartender charged me I was accused of lying! As we waited for the performer to arrive the bar filled up and the crowd seemed sort of preppie. There was even a bachelorette party that came by. So with the crowd we saw that may be why we were treated the way we were. The downstairs staff seemed to be equally as unfriendly. \u00a0As promised, the ring performer was appearing that evening, and was outstanding. Now that I have gone once, to sort of check it off my list,I would never go back. There is too much competition in this town to afford crappy staff.",

Well I can confirm maybe it is only the best sound system if you are right in the middle of the dancefloor, in front of the DJ booth, getting tossed and pushed by the massive crowd. I can hang with crowded clubs, but you usually just need to hang out on the sides so you can actually chill/not feel claustrophobic. However, the speakers are all pointed to that point spot in the middle, so if you are on the side, the sound literally sounds awful.  It can be fun, but IT HAS NO AIR CONDITIONING DOWNSTAIRS so it literally feels like a sweaty pit of hell when its really crowded. That's not sexy at all.   And to LeVanna whining about getting pushed out of the club.... Maybe don't act like such a n00b and get so drunk in a place where you are not savvy on the streets.",

I remember having fun, but wanting to leave soon after. There were definitely a handful of creeper guys, and the music was filled with trance-y type beats. I guess I just wasn't feeling it at the time...or maybe waking up at 7am and drinking at 11am till whatever time it was that we got here, was just too much.

Don't know why people are complaining about drinks being expensive...they were $11, that's pretty cheap nowadays. And they were tasty.   Top level is broken into two sections, separated by a wall with cirque du soleil-inspired contortionists. A bar, and a lounge area, with plush seats and video projected onto the wall. Very mellow.  Downstairs is a club area. $10 cover, no big. Decent space to dance. At one point I had to briefly leave to meet one of the girls who had parked nearby and who wanted an escort through the neighborhood. Bartender covered my drinks for me while I went to get her.

Was it my new glasses? My cardigan? When I got to the door of the Monarch, I felt like I'd reached a nice, little oasis in the middle of a neighborhood that was trying really hard not to give a ****.  The inside of the Monarch looks like a dark, Victorian mansion upstairs and a little Space Mountain'ish downstairs. It wasn't crowded the night I was there, so I was able to get a drink quickly and cruise around looking at the place. I really liked the different areas to hang out in and appreciated all the couches and comfy chairs.   I was there to see a couple of DJ's I like, so I'd bought a ticket for $18 ($15 + service fee). It honestly took me a little while to figure out what I was supposed to do because the stairs to the lower area were kind of blocked by a rope, but there was nobody around for a Will Call and the doorman didn't seem to know anything. I eventually just walked around the rope and went downstairs. I'm happy to support the local music scene, but I could've just come to this event without paying just as easily. Kinda weird. It would have been nice to have somebody at the top of the stairs by the rope.  The crowd at Monarch the night I was there was a little mixed. There were some really friendly folks, some random people spacing out, and a bunch of other guys and girls who were a little douche-y. Lots of cutting and pushing at the bar by guys in suits and girls massed up in groups who would pull their friends in like some sort of amoeba. However, once I got my drink, I was able to find a place to hang out that was comfortable without dealing with those people again.  The Monarch has a cool space, a great sound system, some really nice people behind the bar, and an almost laid-back vibe that I liked a lot. I'll definitely be back in the near future!",

Come on, people in street are as SF as fog and the Giants!  We enter into a stylish bar with tunes planing and a few people chatting away at the bar. The first thing i noticed was the huge selection of booze! i like to think i am experienced in the world of spirits, but i was dumbfounded by the selections. We bellied up to the bar and cruised the menu. Lots of beer in the bottle and a good selection of cocktails that sounded good!   Make a long story short because it starts to get a little fuzzy from here on out. we ended up staying past 11:00pm! An happy hour drink turned into many cocktails!

Upstairs, the decor is more steampunk, with the main bar at the entrance and a lounge behind it with victorian couches &amp; tables, where you can listen to anything from Eighties Pop to Psychedelic Funk, depending on which DJ is spinning that night. Now they've added a new space behind the lounge, the \"Emperor's Drawing Room,\" with a second bar. It has a more intimate feel than the front bar, definitely the place to settle if you're planning on conversation over drinks.  The drinks are a little more pricey than a lot of other places in the neighborhood (especially the fancy cocktails), but you definitely get what you pay for, and the staff are all very nice (and nice to look at). Speaking of the neighborhood, it really isn't scary like some other reviewers would have you believe. I've walked alone from Monarch to wait for MUNI at all different hours of the night and never had a problem. Be aware but not afraid--it's SOMA, not the Tenderloin.",

The cover for the downstairs party was $10 which wasn't too bad. There were 3 or 4 DJs playing in a row and they were awesome, playing a mix of hip hop, dub step and trance.

    "review_text": "I have attended Monarch several times since they opened last year and have always enjoyed the music and the crowd and had a rarin' good time with my crew. However, the club's employees are not responsible for any of these things. The clubs employees are responsible for creating a safe \u00a0environment for patrons, making sure no illegal activities go on, and making their customers feel comfortable returning to the venue for another artist's show. Based on my past experiences at Monarch, I can safely (now that I am off the clubs property) say that they are not interested in doing any of these things.  Last friday I attended a show at Monarch with several friends. We were all enjoying the show, but after it started getting packed decided to go outside and have a cigarette. While I was standing in the area of the side walk designated as a smoking area, 'Rick' one of the doormen pushed another customer on the ground in front of my feet. I do not know what originally provoked this, but the reaction was clearly overly violent. Rick the doorman, who is tall, broad shouldered and weighs perhaps 200 lbs, had grabbed a slim younger customer and thrown him on the side walk. The boy was covering his face and trying to get up, but Rick kept pushing him back down to the side walk. After he was allowed to get up and leave I walked back to the entrance of the venue, shaken, and showed the doorman the stamp on my wrist and calmly said to Rick 'I would appreciate it if you respected your customers physical space' (direct quote) Rick pushed me and said 'You're done!' at first I didn't believe what was happening and attempted to walk through the door. He pushed me again and said 'Get out of my doorway!' My friends came back out to ask why I was not allowed to go back into the venue to see the act I had paid for, at first trying to be reasonable. Rick told both of the boys with me that they weren't allowed back in either. Met with more shouting and pushing, tempers began to raise. After asking if he thought this was how you treat paying customers, Rick pushed my friend into the street and said 'I'm OPD! You can't touch me! If you don't leave I'm going to call my boys around the corner to f#@% you up!'. We did, eventually leave but not before calling the cops and reporting the 'security' guard for aggravated assault.  I understand that Monarch is in a bad area of town, and that additional security is perhaps necessary. However, nothing about Rick's behavior made that corner a safer place. At best he scared away 5 frequent customers, at worst he committed aggravated assault. I realize some people will be inclined to think that there was just some misunderstanding, and perhaps my friends and I were more incapacitated or more belligerent than described here. However, I have also witnessed the 'security' guards at Monarch taser (yes taser) a man on the dance floor repeatedly while he was lying in the fetal position in the corner of the dance floor. In another incident, my friend was standing in the wrong part of the side walk while smoking and was likewise refused re-entry without any warning. This are just the events I personally witnessed and I am sure there are many other stories concerning this security guard's abuse of power as well.  I would strongly encourage the owners of Monarch to hire a doormen from a different security company (Rick claimed to be the manager) which focuses on protecting a venue's customers and property as opposed to demonstrating what little power they have by use of physical violence. I would also encourage any customers looking to enjoy electronic music or any promoters or artists looking to create a comfortable, fun environment to go elsewhere.",

    "review_text": "Beware of the small female bartender with short black hair and tacky black eye makeup. My friends and I came here last night night for a birthday party and it should have been a red flag when said bartender didn't know how to make a simple gin martini. Gin shot? Gin and tonic? I'm sorry, do I need to write my order down for you? My goodness it's literally one of the easiest drinks to make, gin and vermouth, that's it's. I let it slide as it was a Friday night and they were relatively busy, which is a complete overstatement. I'm not quite sure how things escalated, as I was sober (refusing to drink her disgusting concoctions) but she ended up holding my credit card ransom behind the bar. I had my ID in hand ready to close out and she's telling me I've never ordered a drink. Excuse me, I've returned two of your drinks and have politely asked you to remake them. On top of that, I repeated myself enough times telling you that I'm not trying to be rude or offensive, I just want a proper drink that doesn't taste like bleach. Clearly Gin is not her forte, but when I'm paying $12 for a martini, I want a martini.  Anyways, a very kind gentleman sitting at the bar next to me informs me on this sweet little piece of information: she's been taking shots being the bar all night. It's fine to indulge here and there but when you're drunk at work, sweetie please, are you still in high school? Return that horrific outfit to 2007 and take a quick lesson on professionalism and class. One thing led to another, and I'm sure I've said nicer things in my day, but the bouncer and eventually the owner had to come over to make this difficult woman give me my card back. So tell me, rude bartender, what's more embarrassing for you? Your security guard giving you a stern talking to and snatching my card back? Or your boss telling you he's seen you on the cameras all night and that you're fired?   Regardless of this colorful story, Monarch is worth it when you don't have to deal with rude and drunk bartenders who are aging less gracefully than their mothers. Kudos to the rest of the staff for handling the situation properly;I give them 5 stars.",

I came here for a friend's good-bye party. It was a very laid back get-together. And Monarch was just that. The place is super casual, you don't have to wear typical club clothing. A lot of people wear jeans, shorts, a regular sweater, etc.   There are two floors to this place. I was only at the top floor. It was small and cramped and more suitable for chit-chat. The underground floor is supposedly more club like (dancing). I didn't go downstairs because there was a cover charge-- I didn't have to pay cover for the top floor.  Drinks are the typical price, I paid $7 for gin and tonic.  What I really had a problem with was the location. The area was so sketchy. I parked on Howard and 6th and had to hold on to pepper spray for my one-block walk to Monarch. When I had left yesterday night, police cars had blocked off a section of 6th St. because someone got shot.",

They bring in incredible talent (not just electronic, but live music too), have an amazing sound system, tons of room to dance, inexpensive drinks, unpretentious staff...it's pretty much tits all around.  But here's the BEST part about Monarch: if you just want to have a nice cocktail and chat with your friends, the upstairs bar has a great cocktail menu, plenty of seating, and music is played at a low enough volume that you can actually hold conversations. But if you guzzle a few of those Manhattans and suddenly feel like dancing, head downstairs into the nightclub area and get down! It's like 2 bars in one - what a great concept. BOTTOM LINE: Go.

I'm from Cleveland and that price is just redonkulous! You can get a hand-crafted, incredible cocktail for $15 at home, so maybe you can see why I think $12 for a shot of tequila is a little much. (Just my personal opinion, here...)  The upstairs won me over with its vibe and *gasp* free Photobooth! How much fun is that? We pretty much dominated that thing for at least 30 minutes straight. I also loved the ring swing hung above the bar for the dancers. There weren't any while we were there, but it would have been amazing to see one.  Then we walked downstairs and it was dark, cold and damp. The vibe was just off. Don't get me wrong--I love dive bars. This place was just trying to hard to make a basement seem trendy. I would have much rather stayed upstairs and skipped the weird, trance music and weird people dancing in circles.  I will say the bouncers here are awesome. As we were waiting for our Uber Cab outside, he stayed around us and made sure no one messed with us. I guess this isn't the best area of town and knowing that, he made sure no creepsters walked up to us for any reason. He did not go inside until we were safe in our cab. Love that!",

I was a wine bartender and a club bartender during that time. I KNOW when I am being cheated. A super-weak cranberry vodka is not seven goddamn dollars. That's the price of a mixed cocktail in an up glass, darling, not half a shot in 10 ounces of cranberry juice.  So, WAAAAAAY overpriced. Also, I did the standard thing of covering my drink with a flyer while I was dancing--it still got taken. The bartender lady was nice enough to give me a free drink, this time with enough alcohol to actually taste. So kudos to her, but take away points for the staff who threw away my drink. And by the way, if you're going to have a night that is geared towards those who like dubstep AND the darker side of life (goths, for example), as your flyer suggested, I would really appreciate NOT being scoffed at by what looked like your \"regular\" crowd. It felt like fucking high school, a gaggle of girls and one guy all crowded together doing the \"sneer and giggle\"--looking at those of us who came to actually dance and enjoy the music with derision in their purposefully sidelong glances before turning back to each other in their safe haven of \"cool\" and giggling mockingly in so high a pitch I swear only bats should be able to hear it.

But wait, I haven't gotten to the best part! \u00a0There's a gem of a bouncer there. \u00a0I unfortunately don't remember his name, but it starts with a T... \u00a0He's a real charmer, that one.  - When I balk at the $20 cover, he tells me \"it's not that much money, just pay it\" - When I reply that I'm a student, it's the end of the night and I just spent the last of my cash on a cab specifically to Monarch and 2 $12 drinks, and that I don't have $40 in cash just to get me and my girl friend downstairs for an hour, he says:  \"why don't you get a job? \u00a0I'm a student, and I have a job.\"  Wow. \u00a0Well sir, I do have a job. \u00a0Two, actually, and I don't appreciate your tone.  He then proceeded to hit on me. \u00a0My girl friend and I were so disgusted that we put down our $12 drinks, 3/4 full, and walked out. \u00a0Mr. Bouncer had the gall to wink and make a kissy face at me as I left. \u00a0I want to find out where else that guy works so I never have to go to his bars again.  So if that's what you like for a Saturday night, go for it! \u00a0  And to the bartenders: you guys really are great. \u00a0Move to a different bar and I'll follow you.",

Where else would I go? Nonetheless, SF.   Meandering the streets of SF and feeling obliterated to leave Supperclub, I had the urge to head to Monarch. Odds were 10 to 1. Gambled with my friends and my conscience of what I had left after a few drinks to figure out how the club scene would be. Since its only been open for a few weeks, I didn't want to make the poor choice. Well, why the hell not?!   I was taken aback! Monarch was a different vibe. Upstairs was more open. Fresh and lots of room, air to breathe and you can check out the crowd while tunes of rhythmic melodies streamed throughout the top floor. The place so far was inviting and so tasteful! Newly renovated and the color scheme of everything fell into place. I was loving every piece of it. The upstairs was definitely more of a lounge feel. Quiet yet elegant in such a casual setting. The upstairs DJ booth is tucked away in a window-like display before heading down to the rest of the venue below. My friends and I worked our way downstairs to their dancefloor. Downstairs was more packed yet still more room to get yourself to dance. They have the DJ set and stage nearby the downstairs entryway and bar area. Shocking they have stools and chairs to sit down if you care to rest a bit. Spectacular venue. Uptempo, mix crowd and the music is jumpin'!! Grade A in my book. You can't go wrong with the place.  Luckily, I found out they had Miguel Migs and Julius Papp spinnin' the evening we went. House music and $5 cover charge?! Not so bad. If you come in earlier before guestlist closes, FREE. Drinks are hit-or-miss depending who pours your drink but I won't complain. They do have one bar upstairs and the other downstairs. However, it's a CASH ONLY bar, but they do have an ATM machine. Unfortunately, the night we went it wasn't working. Love the place anyway, so that doesn't take away a star! Experience was fun! Security kept crowd control under wraps, so there was no problems whatsoever.  I was feeling exhilarated when I swayed my hips from left to right and my feet was dancing to the groove with everyone! Lots of eye candy! I may have found a new joint to dibble dabble my tush to and fro the next time I visit. Penciled into one of my go-to spots!",

Techies will be playing Cards Against Humanity, the bar will have flowing drinks, and there will be a DJ playing some music, often matching what is going on downstairs.  Downstairs, you're going to find an amazingly sweet Void Acoustics horn-mounted Sound system, the first of it's kind in the City, and one of the first on the West Coast, voted one of the top ten sound systems in the United States by a respected dance music writer. The sound cannot be understated, it has absolutely no dead spots throughout the club and sounds crisp, punchy, clear, and will toss you around the dance floor... if you can find any space. The dance space is frighteningly small for the amount of power the sound has. There is a small-ish VIP section (that gets in the way of everything, as they usually do), and cocktail waitresses will randomly walk through the crowd balancing a bunch of drinks on a plate, causing you to suddenly freak out when they push by.  Some amazing talent comes through here, including Dixon, Ame, DJ Tennis, Carl Craig, and other great deep tech/house DJs, but you're going to have a tough time finding room on the dance floor and the identity crisis the entire club has really makes it tough to stand and vibe out with the room. The sound nearly makes up for it, but I have honestly yet had a time there where I didn't feel like I was swimming in scene-ish hipsters who are looking to be seen rather than have a good night.  They sometimes throw afterhours here, including a brand new one that happened on New Years Day this year, so I feel like the aim of the club is to be one of those great dance spots for discerning ears, but I can't help but feel disappointed that the great, if packed, club space has to be attached to the hipster bar.",

I danced for a couple of songs and then decided to go outside and smoke a cigarette with my friends. As we were all going inside I was the last one in the group and I flicked my cigarette apparently to close to the door and the bouncer took a huge offense to that and decided that i was no longer permitted inside. Obviously I was not happy with that and put up a huge fit and because I'm a rather large man at 6'5 I was swarmed with bouncers that threatened to beat me if I decided to make another move towards the club. I asked all of the bouncers why I was being kicked out and none could give me a real answer.... besides the fact that I was with an attractive girl that was already inside and they decided that I was threatening to all of them.  I will never personally go back to this club because of the terrible service, not so good music, and very drugged out crowd that was very clearly too fucked up to make a good scene... the bouncers were clearly used to dealing with very fucked up and drugged out people and when they actually came across a sober man that stands up for himself they didnt know how to act besides abuse the power they were given,   DO NOT COME TO THIS CLUB UNLESS YOU ENJOY BEING MISTREATED.

It was pretty empty when we first got there (right before 10pm), but in the next 30-45 minutes, it got pretty full. A mixed crowd in terms of style but also more casual and laid back. Some were dancing, others just standing around. The music was a mix of lounge/downtempo but then the DJ started playing a weird mix of hits from the 60s, 70s, 80s - and not really danceable stuff for most people. I'll dance to anything so I was having fun, but my friends that are more into hip hop and top 40 were not feeling it. \u00a0So as a result, we left and went to another place.   But overall, I liked the dance floor area. It's a decent size though there's limited seating and a stage. I'm not sure how hot or crowded it could get and how that would feel, but it wasn't bad when I was there. Parking in the area is okay though you might have to circle a little or park a little further away. Inside there's a coat check for $3.

I grab a tequila concoction of sorts that tastes heavenly and plop my bum down on one of the nicely styled Victorian-esque plush couches. Then as I think I'm fairly satisfied and set on this early evening out, I look up to see this amazing acrobatic show by a woman spinning in a ring. Yow-sah! They obviously crossed their Ts and dotted their Is when working on the concept and the delivery for this place, yes, yes I would say they just about nailed it. Congrats guys, congrats indeed.",

I was skeptical of the location, having seen at least three other concepts fail in the same space over the years, but this time they might have hit on something just right.  The upstairs bar is set against a beguiling wall art piece that resembles a monarch butterfly, or at least that was my interpretation. There are enough seats to allow for proper lounging as well, and if you're really bored you can continue walking in circles scoping the eye candy (especially on DJ nights).  If you consider the other definition of monarch, then the name could allude to a slightly ego-driven entendre towards well-made cocktails and music reigning supreme. Then again, when I found out that Tadd Cortell (who opened Cav) is one of the guys behind this place, mixed in with Chris Smith (of Om Records fame), then it's entirely possible that the future thumping dance scene down below will truly rule.",

And even within one evening, Monarch can be two completely different places, depending on your mood. I gather that if you attend on certain nights and delve into the deep recesses of its psyche (or the basement) it becomes a terrible club with awful people and awful music. But so long as you stay upstairs, Monarch is a perfectly pleasant host!  I arrived with a large group of coworkers on a random Monday night. The stereo was playing all 90s hits, which I was 85% a fan of. The bar was dark, and old and authentic. Now my memories are a bit fuzzy, but I recall a lot of wood, and boudoir-esque wallpaper. There's a huge ring hung behind the bar for an aerialist to perform. Tucked in the corner is a FREE photo booth for all your picture taking or secret making-out needs. The lighting is dim yet dramatic. Monarch is a little dirty but a lot sexy!   Now they have a large number of specialty cocktails at Monarch, but I can only speak to one, The Darkness. Do you know how much fun it is to go up to the bar and say \"i'll take The Darkness\"? It KINDA made me feel like a badass. Made with Buffalo Trace bourbon, bitters and I don't recall what else, this drink was seriously good. So good I had three of them. Everybody else seemed to love their cocktails as well, but I was NOT about to switch away from my cup of amazing.   In a city that I visit so rarely as San Francisco, I often don't want to go back to places I have already tried. However, I would gladly go back to Monarch, so long as we could stay upstairs.",

Okay, I said, and gave the bartender my credit card. He said the minimum charge was $20. Okay, I said, I'm sure between the three of us there we would meet the minimum.  Finished our first round of drinks. Ordered a second round of the same, plus one bottle of Anchor Steam. Said I was ready to close out my tab.  Was presented with a tab for $44. Hmm, that didn't seem quite right, so I politely pointed out the error.   Was asked what I had. Told the bartender: Two Jack and ginger ales, two plain 7-Ups, one bottle of Anchor Steam.  It seems to me that the correct handling of this situation would have been to apologize for the error, and fix it. Instead, what I got from the bartender was, \"By MY calculations, that seems right, but what do YOU think it should be?\"  Hmm. By MY calculations, if one Jack and ginger ale cost $8, then TWO Jack and ginger ales should cost $16. It was Saturday night so there was no happy hour pricing or anything like that. That leaves one bottle of beer unaccounted for. $44 - $16 = $28.  By MY calculations, I don't think I should be paying TWENTY-EIGHT FREAKING DOLLARS FOR ONE FREAKING BOTTLE OF ANCHOR STEAM!  I calmly asked how much the beer was. The bartender said it was $5. I calmly said that by MY calculations I owed $21.  He put $21 on my card. I did not leave any tip. Mind you, that wasn't for the initial error; it was for implying I was either:  a) stupid b) a liar c) a stupid liar  Well, I'll tell you what: MY calculations made more sense even after I'd had two admittedly strong drinks. I'll tell you what else: by MY calculations, not coming back here again.  If you do come here, I recommend that you pay with cash. They've proven to me that you really have to watch them.",

The second time I got berated by the black security guard I forgot his name for standing infront of the club waiting for a cab while also being told to buy more drinks or leave. So there i was trying to leave and then he told me to get off my cell phone because he knows that neighborhood and its unsafe for me to be on the cell phone...but then tells me to go down the street because i was blocking the entrance and down the street was more unsafe to wait for a cab if you ask me. I need to go back and find out his name because he is on my shit list. Way shitty and unprofessional for business and clientele. I will only go back there if my friend is djing again or to find out the security guards name.

You walk into a fancy schmancy room where you can romance your date on the couches upstairs or head downstairs to the more crowded area and dance like no one is watching! I LOVED it. The music and DJs were great. My group had an amazing time, and we're all in our 20s.  Cocktails had the perfect amount of alcohol for me, but it wasn't TOO strong. I would advise the bar tender to put in more alcohol if you want a stronger drink.  If I ever found my way to this place again, I'd be back.",

The concept behind \"Beats for Lunch\" is that you go clubbing over your lunch break instead of just sitting at your cube. On the way out you grab the bag lunch provided.   I won't go into details but props to Monarch for hosting this event every month. The upstairs (ground floor) is a laid back bar. Downstairs in the basement past a heavy curtain is the club.   I know that Monarch is supposed to have an awesome sound system. I'm not that familiar with sound systems but I can say in my inexpert opinion that the music sounded good without resorting to being body-shaking loud which I appreciated. Is that what the technology is supposed to do? I liked how my ears weren't ringing afterwards since I had to go back to work.  The DJ was fun and everyone had a great time.",

Also, not too pricey for drinks, they know how to make some good cocktails like real mixologists should. I'm pretty sure the bartender I saw working last night (Thursday) has arms of steel from crushing all that fruit and mint. He crushed like he meant it, which I had to applaud with a nice tip.   As for the music/club venue: it's in the \"basement\"--which usually isn't the best sign (I've been to LiPo, that place is where you go to leave part of your soul.)  We came here to see MoshiAudio's free show with Loquat playing a live set. And at first, you're taken aback: will the lead singer's voice even carry in this basement venue? But then the first note is hit and you realize, \"holy shit. this place has badass sound!\" As it should, since it was just voted by 7x7 as the best sound. It holds up to its rep.   Anyway...with good drinks, and bartenders that serve without attitude, and a decent sound and venue to shake my ass, I'll definitely be stumbling back (and out of) this place again.",

Pro-tip: there is cover for the dance floor downstairs, but they take it downstairs. It varies but the night I went, it was $5 before 11, $15 after. Unfortunately when I got into the bar around 10:40, I thought I was ok. We went down to the dance floor at 11:05 and had to pay the extra $10. C'est la vie. I recommend if you come early, head downstairs, pay, get a stamp, and then come hang out upstairs for a bit.  I think concerns about leaving your car in the neighborhood are overblown. I parked on 5th and Mission and walked a block up and felt perfectly safe. Full disclosure, it's a main road and they start sweeping at 2 AM, and I'm a bigger guy so I tend not to worry too much about my surroundings.  Drinks are strong and reasonable. My date got two vodka tonics and a mojito from different bars, all reasonably strong. I got a sidecar and could definitely taste the Marnier. They don't gyp you.  There was a very eclectic crowd, people from all backgrounds and \"scenes\", which I really liked. I'm too used to being surrounded by a pretty monolithic Asian crowd, so it was nice seeing different faces around.  CHECK OUT WHO IS PLAYING THE NIGHT YOU GO. The nightclub downstairs was stuffy and hot, but still fun. The DJ they had spinning was terrible, but in all fairness I'm not a big house guy. Too much monotonous UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ. I wasn't alone as I saw a lot of people sort of standing around, unsure how of how to dance to the music. I can tell that with the right DJ, the place would be popping.  The DJ upstairs was actually pretty awesome, mixing in top 40s with old timey Motown with his own little flair. I wish he'd been running the show downstairs.  I'm altogether too used to going to Vegas-y clubs like Grand and finding a place that didn't suck was awesome. Definitely coming back.",

No, they aren't cheap, but that's simply the price you pay for a visit to one of the top clubs in any city.  But... I have to knock a star off for the douchebag factor that overruns Monarch on weekends. The club has blown up, lately attracting Marina &amp; Bridge-and-Tunnel types with some seriously entitled attitudes; I've experienced so much pushing/shoving (with no excuse me or sorry), sexual harassment, and other generally belligerent behavior that it's a huge turnoff--to the point where I've stopping coming at peak times.

Walking down a sketchy street into a lounge/bar that itself has split personalities.  There's a classy bar in the back with fancy drinks, a more divey bar out in the front and a sweaty dance floor down below.  I enjoyed chilling in the back bar and moving around the place. There are some couches out back and front, great if you want to transition to a more laid back lounge environment. There were strange colored drawings of naked people plastered through out the bar (not that naked people are inherently strange, but these drawings looked like something a 14 year old boy would sketch), which were a fun conversation-piece.  The DJ in between the two bars (where I suppose the aerialists were supposed to be, but they were not present on Wednesdays) spun some fun low-key house music and by midnight, the dance floor was in full swing. Although, when when we started dancing around 11pm...we were the only 3 people on the dance floor. Not sure if upstairs dancing would have happened on a Wednesday night had we not started it.  I wanted to go downstairs and check it out, but I wasn't keen on paying a cover fee. The one gripe I had was one of the employees wouldn't let me go downstairs to check it out for a few minutes to see if I enjoyed it. I didn't want to pay a cover for an environment that I don't even know, let alone a band that I've never heard of. I just wanted to go and see what the vibe was like downstairs before I committed to paying a cover charge, but she wouldn't budge. Later on, when the security switched...I asked the other guy and he let me go down and see, which was nice. I didn't end up going downstairs.  Anyway, this is a fun place. It does have a split personality, but that's accepted in places like San Francisco. It's a mix of classy, divey, dancey, electronic...but best of all: it's a super fun environment to hang out with friends or meet new people.",

    "review_text": "Yelpers are hilarious group of people. \u00a0I decided to take my time and review this place because some of these people feel so entitled to everything the record has to be put straight.  Upstairs: Perks: super \"chic\" bar. \u00a0The prices might be \"high\" but you get what you pay for, REAL cocktails that are unique in the city [This is not a normal bar or a dive bar... go to OMG down the street]. Awesome decorations, good music, great scenery. \u00a0Also, FREE PHOTOBOOTH!! \u00a0Just be careful! \u00a0People can see your pictures outside :) \u00a0The Happy Hour is dope, the bar staff is amazing, the cocktails are DELICIOUS, and every day there is a special event going on for different drinks, new drinks, or awesome food. Cons: Can get really crowded (if you aren't one for crowds) Music can get a little loud and anti-loungy. And that's about it.  Downstairs: Perks: Oh where to start. \u00a0Audiophiles will LOVE the VOID ACOUSTIC AIR MOTIONS V2 that they have. \u00a0It is the cleanest most neutral sounding sound system in SF. \u00a0None of the levels ever overwhelm each other and the speakers are always tweaked to perfection. \u00a0Standing in the middle sounds amazing. \u00a0Talent is always on point. \u00a0They bring in the best in underground music (sorry Tiesto, Ke$ha, Trap Expert Taylor Swift, or Skrillex don't come) the world has to offer. \u00a0It's predominantly House and its sub genres, but they have dubstep/trap on Tuesdays and some tech nights. \u00a0Mondays are live music. he bar staff is awesome and, my god, are they attractive as [censored]. Like DAMN. \u00a0Its a small and intimate setting with great music. Cons: Its a small and intimate space, so if you don't like small places with a lot of people, it can be overwhelming. \u00a0That's it.  If you are worried about paying $20 or $30 at the door... buy pre-sale tickets... DUH! \u00a0I have gone to normal clubs and had to pay $20 to get in for a SF based, top 40 DJ (playing the same kind of terrible music I hear on the radio) on a terrible sound system and dealing with a whole lot of douche nozzles..  Also the security staff here is awesome as long as you aren't an a-hole. \u00a0I've been too drunk and smoked too close to the door and all they say is \"please sir, can you stand by the wall past the tree\"   Monarch IS the best club in sf. Haters gonna hate cause Yelp gives them a place to feel like their opinion is important. \u00a0They are just like the magazines that freak out if a celebrity gains 5 pounds. \u00a0Get a life.",

Seriously, there's not much in bars for non-drinkers (this is amazing news, I know) but with a free photo booth where you can grab your pals and haul them in to snap a pic or two went a long way to beckoning me back to Monarch. Also, the copper bended pipes coming out of the double tuba fixture was something kinda special as well.  Downstairs there was dancing and random projected old timey movies. Seems to be the thing now, and while I wasn't totally jamming on the downstairs vibe, it's probably much jammy-er when there are more bodies bouncing to the beat.   A word to the wise. Or rather, unwise. The cops stopped a group of my cohorts on the way to the bar and told them not to turn down 6th. This little stretch of road ain't exactly \"hang around in a dark alley\" kind of neighborhood, so if you're feeling sketched by the whole thing it may be worth cabbing it.",

    "review_text": "This was the last stop for a 21st birthday party I planned, and my group of 28 absolutely loved the venue.  Christy is in charge of the group events and VIP bottle services. She's so nice and extremely organized. I had a great time planning and reserving a spot for my group with her. All you have to do is either call or even e-mail her and she'll get back to you asap.  If you are planning an event at this venue, make sure to inform them about a party bus (if you are using one) or have your party bus drop you off a few blocks away. The bouncers wouldn't even talk to me or any of my group members when we first arrived because our bus was there. However, when I was emailing Christy, I let her know that we did have a large vehicle and had permission to enter despite this! This is a HUGE TIP for any event planners out there.  The club up top was pretty crowded (this is around 10-11 pm), but the club was pretty spaced out. There were a lot of people there, don't get me wrong, but the lights were cool and everyone was just kinda jammin' out on their own. The band that played (... Valentine?) was awesome. The sound system, as expected, was amazing (I read reviews on it beforehand).  Overall, the night turned out great and I am so happy I chose Monarch as a stop. I found it on the site: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsosh.com&amp;s=04a2fc502da60b1629cfac7d6c6d550add1119c04870a29139018ff0390774b3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sosh.com</a>.

What a delightful surprise, then, was Monarch, a classic space now envisioned as a rather hipster-forward cocktail bar up top, with dance space on the floor downstairs.   It's the little touches that make this place work well, from the performance hoop dangling in the negative space beyond the bar to the hand-crafted libations they're spinning here. I've not spent any time in the dance club below, but then again, that's not really my bag. What I did do was settle up against the bar for some lively chatter and a cold one or two. And in a pinch, that worked out just fine.",

Bottle service available, corner VIP couches, stage for dancing. Yup they have it. They are open everyday and the music is different every night.   I like the decor of this place. I didn't really expect it judging from the outside where there are bunch of homeless people loitering. Wait, I'm not sure if they're that but this part of the city seemed sketchy to me.  Did i mention the photobooth? You can snap a photo of yourself for free with prints and also have it emailed to you. I think we took like 5 since no one was there anyways. Strike a pose there's nothing to it, VOGUE!   After a drink or two, we called it a night and left. Nice place to kick it with good friends.   Good times!",

Plus, there is a free, photo booth for you to mean mug and throw up faux gangsta signs or test out that sexy face you've been working on in the mirror. Either way, it promotes good times and the ego!  Oh, and plenty of fernet. Can't forget that. (Unless, you actually forget that.)",

DRINKS - Rasputin: pleasantly refreshing! I just remember raspberry, mint, and some whiskey was involved. The big plus was the mint. It was decently strong. - Rickshaw: my friend got this drink! This seriously tasted like grapefruit juice, but it packed a kick so don't be fooled.  PRICES I think the special house drinks were $10, which is a bit steep but that's SF for you.   ATMOSPHERE Top floor was more loungey--there's huge couches all around with big tables. There seemed to be a dance floor on the bottom, but since we didn't want to pay to get in (or to check our coats + bags), we opted to chill upstairs. Apparently there's some kind of trapeze acts on wknd nights too, but we didn't stay long enough to see. Gotta come back!  LOCATION Since it's SOMA, the walk there is a bit sketch so come with a large grp of friends! It's easy to miss cos it sits between 2 adult book/video stores, haha. Close proximity to downtown and BART.  EXTRAS Photo boot ftw! It wasn't crowded at all and it comes with pretty backgrounds. Remember the last pic will be the biggest one, so pose accordingly for that",

The atmosphere on a Sunday night is calm with good music and not much of a crowd, so you can really enjoy each other's company without feeling as though you've been packed into a sardine can. \u00a0  The two bartenders were great; they were quick with the drinks, had big smiles, and a fun sense of humor. The bar is pretty well stocked and should be able to make most patrons quite happy with the varied selections.  Above the bar is an eight foot (roughly) circular hole in the wall, and hanging inside the circular hole is an acrobat's hoop on a secure lanyard with carabiners. \u00a0I asked the gal behind the bar if it's ever used and she said \"Yeah, all the time on the really busy nights\".  I think I'll come back to see that on a Friday or Saturday \u00a0:-D  The bar, the tables, and the bathrooms were all clean and well kept; always a good sign. \u00a0There's a back room with a large projection screen, a couch, some chairs, and a small bit of dancing space. There's also a downstairs, but I didn't venture in that direction and can't speak to what you'll find.  It's a good spot, we had a lot of fun, the drinks were good, and the bartenders were friendly/funny. I recommend dropping in for a drink with friends.",

It's got all the proper fixings of a dark bar gone fancy with their short list of house created concoctions.   I particularly enjoyed the Negroni, a beverage that's sure to get you off your bar stool (whether intentionally or not). The only rule for this classic cocktail is blending only liquids with alcohol. With a cocktail sans a non-alcoholic mixer, it'll likely put hair on your otherwise unhairy chest.   As for the rest of the cocktail menu, it's a handful of other potent items, so if you're searching for something respectable, this is the place. Sadly, the hoop that hangs over the bar and presumably features contortionist or swinging lassies was devoid of said sirens. Better luck next time!",

From a hoop aerialist that performs above the bar on the weekends, to a photobooth that captures the magic of the superbly concocted cocktails perfectly, and to a bottom floor that will blow your mind and not your ears.  Yeah - if you want to know what's up in the city when it comes to sound-systems - look no further than Monarch. Their downstairs boasts a gorgeous custom coned sound system imported from London, that has perfected sound to a science. It directs it exactly where you want to hear it, while still allowing you to speak to friends. Absolutely genius. Right now they host a slew of on point DJs on the weekends - but going forward they're even looking to hosting more live musical acts as well - so stay tuned.  For a swank, yet casual happy hour spot during the weekday - make your way on over to Monarch. For a late night weekend dance spot - Monarch is still the supreme reigning spot. And down the road if you want to check out live music - stay on top of Monarch.  Trust.",

Maybe ask downstairs.\"  So then you walked downstairs, confused, wondering who in the hell has never heard that song before and head through the deserted dance floor to the DJ booth. There, you get ignored for 3 minutes before this guy behind her is like \"Oh, she's not that kind of DJ.\" Ooooooooookay?  This place is all house/edm music. That's fine, just not my cup of tea, but wouldn't that be better suited for some warehouse with candy kids? I mean, when you're blacked out, the music doesn't matter, but as you're getting there and trying to dance, this place is weird, and doesn't match. I just did not like it at all.. I feel like I got tricked. And with a $20 cover? It's just not worth it.

Because a cop may or may not appreciate the value of a cadre of cocktailiers &amp; business owners (the Monarch fellows) committed to bringing prosperity &amp; propriety into a section of the city, doesn't give them the credence to turn people away from said business. This is what happened to a group of friends that were on there way to meet us at Monarch. Now if those cops want to come into Monarch, scope the scene, tip the tenders for the Fernetiquette and have a shot with us... that might've been the more balanced approach. Whether they've noticed or not... there's trouble a brewing all over the city... so to judge Mission &amp; 6th to turn away people is boggling my brain. They must not have experienced the hap happenings of Monarch. If they had... they would've joined our friends.   Don't heed to their unwarranted call... go to Monarch. Five years from now it'll all be gentrified. Maybe they don't know about the Monarch butterfly and they're thinking the name of the place means \"Mo' Narc.\" Maybe? Wait, shouldn't they like that?  Astute bartenders. Astute tunes. Astutely crafted space. For the same reason young professionals &amp; hipsters love going to dive bars in the middle of gentrified nabes... you should enjoy going to Monarch as it's not a dive bar and it's a dive-y section of town. Repeat: not a dive bar. Other reviews are noting it's a dive bar. First sign of being a dive bar is when your first step into the dive bar your foot has a fair chance at getting stuck to the floor -- and the same goes for the first time your elbows hit the bar. The only reason you'd be stuck at Monarch is the refined cocktail menu &amp; your eyes may get stuck on the strapping gents tending bar. This is as a nice of a bar as you need, unless, well, your interested in cufflinks being mandatory.  There's definitely a caustic tone to all of this, which I suppose is due to this cop situation. It has nothing to do with the gentility of Monarch, the essence of Bon Jovial. I was in SF for a week, and the highlight night of my time there was my night at Monarch -- because of their smiles, kindness and their likelihood of handing us tiny glasses of Fernet.",

Bartenders were very friendly and did their job very well with serving drinks that were mixed just right. The dancer in the bar upstairs had some legit skills! I ended up spending most of the night downstairs, which had a cool underground feel to it, with a dance floor that could have been just a tiny bigger but I didn't feel to squeezed. I really like the free self-serve water on the side of both bars upstairs and downstairs, it contributed to no hangover the next day!  I met at least 10 people when I was there, anywhere from locals to visitors like me. The music was great, very chill progressive electro or something in that matter, not annoying at all.

I was going to show my stamp and/or ID again but the bouncers said, \"How could we forget you?\" *Flattered* hahaha  The music was just eh for me. I'm more into songs with lyrics. This is probably a place for people who are more into trance. Since we weren't feeling the music, we weren't really dancing, so we ended up leaving to go to The Grand instead, which was way more fun.

We've both worked high end restaurant jobs with full bars for a few years now so we have an idea of what to expect.  After trolling all over SOMA for what seemed like an hour for a decent place that was actually open on a Sunday (dumb), we gave up and said what the hell to this place. We both wanted to dance and heard about the downstairs area. It was a ten dollar cover at this time but again, we just wanted to get down already. I asked how busy it was downstairs and the doorman said it was \"alright, tonight\". I should have asked what kind of music they had playing cause my friend did not like techno which turned out to be the selection of the night. Oh well. Our bad.   We suck it up because again, we wanted to dance. There was a decent crowd. Fairly mixed it seemed. We felt a bit younger than everyone else (mid twenties-early thirties). I wanted a drink so we hit the bar. This is where I get annoyed. We make ourselves visible in the very CENTER of the bar and try to get the bartenders attention. This dirty blonde-haired woman takes a few minutes before coming up and saying she'll be with us in a moment (we've been right in front of her the whole time). A moment passes, and another, and another. I notice she has taken up orders somewhere else with people who appeared after us. She is not busy at all. Just cruising through, making drinks. All I wanted was a friggin' beer. Just pop the cap so I get back to the floor, damnit. I ask this other guy (not sure if he was tending or was a barback) if I can get a beer and he just says. \"She'll be with you in a moment.\" Ultimately takes like 10 minutes to get a beer. I could see the fridge too. Just wanted to jump over and get it myself. Ridiculous.  We go back to dancing for another half an hour or so. Now we need to pee. I've been fairly buzzed since coming in as I was wise enough to prefunk at home before wasting too much cash on drinks. We got to the bathroom and notice the Mens bathroom has guys and girls in it and it's crowded. Don't know what they were doing but it seemed, well...a little more time consuming than just peeing or washing up. We decide to go to the ladies which is COMPLETELY empty. We both go to a different stall. A moment later the bouncer is banging on the stall door telling me to get out (I'm a guy). I come out with my fly still unzipped. It's the bouncer from the front door upstairs (not the one at the downstairs entrance). Tall black guy with glasses. He gives me a wave of sass and I tell him I'm sorry but I gotta pee and the other restroom had guys and girls in it just screwing around. He escorts me to the other bathroom and delivers the same treatment to the folks standing around doing whatever. I'm totally peeved at the attitude he gave me. My friend and I pee then bounce.   I'd just like to say that a small \"M\" for Men and \"W\" for women isn't the greatest for declaring the bathrooms in a dark club full of drunk people (drunk people in a club!? No shit!) This bouncer needs a spanking. If it's such a big deal, you don't need to be such a DICK Tracy about it. Go work at the DMV if you want to be that way to people. -1 star for slow service. -2 for the douchebag bouncer. Seriously, I came here to have fun. I didn't cause trouble so don't start it with me.",

A nightclub? Yes.  Depending on what day you walk in, it's all of those things and more. You may see acrobats above you. You may get a fantastic drink. You may hear loud pumping music or (like the last time I was there), a fantastic 90's soundtrack. You may see a dog walking around. You may get your photo taken in the photobooth. You may not know quite what is going on, but here you are.  I like this bar a lot, just because it is so weird. The bartenders know their stuff and will make you a fantastic drink. I ordered something with gin (basically I said, \"I would like a drink with gin. Bartender's choice.\") and he came back with a great cocktail.   There's a dance floor below if that's your thing. I happen to enjoy just sitting in their loungy-type areas in the back with a great cocktail in hand, talking to friends. And that can happen here for sure.",

    "review_text": "Up until last weekend I thought this place was pretty good. The sound system is great,the clientele was okay, and the acts were sometimes stellar.  Last Saturday night, a group of my friends and I decided to see Jimmy Edgar. We expected to pay $10 at the door because the Facebook event and the flyers said it would be $10 after 10:30 pm.   When we arrived the door people said it would be $15. After a few moments of arguing about the price, it was only until I pulled out my smartphone to show them the event price that the door people would let us in at that price.  It seems incredibly SHADY that this would happen.  The door people said it was because the owner wanted to regulate the amount of people coming in - which is a poor way of covering their asses.",

    "review_text": "I'm not the sort of person who goes to clubs. \u00a0Its not that I dislike the concept, but more that I can't dance, possess no sense of style whatsoever, have been cursed with a totally unwelcome case of male-pattern baldness, and (even worse), exhibit an extraordinarily high tolerance for alcohol while possessing very little money. I'm more of a dive bar guy; the dimly lit haunts of writers, grad students and other n'er-do-wells, where conversations flow as readily as boilermakers, a place with no cachet, few hipsters, even fewer North Face Jackets, and largely uncomplicated drinks. So, naturally the only thing that'll get me to go to a club is the promise of cheap beer, and this week the Monarch had that in spades, with a one dollar pint celebration of their new tap system. \u00a0Yelpers take note: If you want to pigeonhole me for whatever reason, I, like the spirit of Charles Bukowski, am wherever cheap beer can be found.  Monarch is a nice looking place. Redwood and pine meet in curlicues upon a crushed velvet backing behind the front bar (or is it the back bar? No matter). Lights spring out from a double-headed sousaphone chandelier complete with mouthpiece, stained glass windows illuminate models of spanish galleons and one of the ninety-nine luftballoons. The other bar features faux-books and Edison Bulbs (the decorative shorthand for hipness), and you can look back out through decorative windows to the silty grey light of the City.  Its pretty goddamned loud as the DJ spins through house music, R&amp;B, and whatever other selections he chooses, but that doesn't stop technocrati twentysomethings from congregating, playing board games ranging from \"Cards Against Humanity\" to an artesinal, hand-crafted \"Connect Four\". They drape themselves over lounge-chairs, and sofas, leaning in to speak, leaning out to laugh, exuding the intentionally unhip vibe crafted and seemingly designed by this city of upstarts.   The much-vaunted cryogenically cooled line system was just fine, the beers were properly-poured, and the thrill of a one dollar pint, of leaving a 100% tip on every drink were not lost to me. As I sat back with my fourth, I leaned back and looked around, realizing that Monarch is for the \"Woo\" people, for the Google crowd, for those who make more in a year than I will in my entire life what a dive bar is for me: a place for conversation, for drinks, for solace from the outside world. Testing this hypothesis, I turned to the man next to me, and asked him \"So, whats your story?\" a line which usually is the start of a friendly conversation in a dive bar. His response: \"I have no story, I work for tech\". I've been wrong before, but never that wrong.  Overall: Three Stars. Lovely place, but not my style.",

    "review_text": "There is absolutely no need to pay a $21 cover to attend this downstairs club (upstairs lounge is free). It's not bad but it's also not superior to plenty of others that offer guest lists all over the city.   The ground level has interesting light installations and an overall trendy decor. However the downstairs dance floor is rather plain and VERY VERY HOT and stuffy. You don't even need to be dancing to start sweating bullets.  Tonight's DJs were deep house. It was nice but not terribly exciting to dance to. Overall, this was one of those rare times that I didn't enjoy dancing the night away.  I might pop in for a drink in the lounge if I am in the area but as long as there continues to be a cover and no guest list, my friends and I will not return for the club.  FUN FACT: There is a photo booth in the lounge but it was broken when I was there. Broken photobooth for young women is the equivalent of offering candy to a child and then withholding it. Ignorance is bliss my friends.   NOTE: If you aren't familiar with SF, this street has high crime levels (it's safe for you, just not your stuff). So if you happen to drive and park by the venue, don't be an idiot and leave nothing visible in your car or it WILL be broken into. I wouldn't lalagag on my smartphone either, it will get snatched.",

Thank you Dusty Rhino btw!), good flow, good ventilation (somehow, can't figure out how though), water by the bar if you are dancing all night, great zones too.  Zone 1: the upstairs bar. meet, mingle, view of people coming in.  Zone 2: lounge behind the bar. talk, laugh, flirt, drink that drink you bought in Zone 1.  Zone 3: the downstairs dance floor. great sound (although also requires a good DJ so look ahead). great coat check, fast service at the bar downstairs, dark enough to feel like no one would 100% recognize you, but can still scope out your attempts at fly dance moves. (Gangnam not included)  FYI: cab it. don't park in the area or stroll too far in any one direction.",

Downstairs, the club is packed with a wall of sound where local SF talent come to play. \u00a0It can get a bit crowded and hot downstairs, so its great that you can take a breather and relax in the lounge area. Reasonably priced drinks. Can get crowded and hard to get a drink but hey isn't it like that in any popular bar/club in any city. Place is small enough to not be too intimidating. \u00a0Love it!",

We arrived and it looked like somewhat of a decent nice looking lounge. There's two parts, so the top where the bar is with a small dance floor in another area and downstairs where the halloween party was supposed to be. \u00a0We were told by the guy in the front who was checking IDs that it was opened yet. \u00a0Hm...not opened and it was like 9:45p? \u00a0  So my friends and I waited and we were like, let's check this out! \u00a0We walked down to the basement area to find out they WERE opened!! \u00a0With 10 minutes left of the open bar, we took about 5 shots back to back and ordered a drink to sip on for the rest of the night. \u00a0We were NOT going to be buying drinks tonight...  There were those that dressed up and those that did not. \u00a0You could order bottle service if you wanted and the crowd seemed to be enjoying their time. \u00a0People were really nice because they happily took our photos when we asked them too.  Coat check was only $3 bucks so that was cool! \u00a0I was praying that they would have a coat check.  Overall we had a lot of fun. \u00a0No creepy dudes were hitting on us, I didn't get my ass slapped by a stranger and we all kept it classy and danced to the music that was more techno....So if you want to party at a smaller location, this is for you! \u00a0No large over crowded bars and dance floors!  I wouldn't come back again simply because of the location...but on a plus note, they were only half a mile away from OSHA Thai!!! \u00a0My nights always end on a happy note when I get to eat there :)",

    "review_text": "People that give this place anymore than 2 stars must be smoking some of the stuff being dealt around the corner. Seriously.   Came here on a Thursday with my girlfriends in hopes of getting a good drink and dancing off a little stress. When we first walked in, I was thought to myself, \"where's the rest of the place?\" The upstairs is tiny, offering a few bar top tables and a long bar. They did have a free photobooth in the back near the bathroom, but the camera position is weird and every shot came out bad. Plus, it has a green screen which the computer puts hideous backgrounds on. The printer wasn't working either, so we weren't able to get any printouts of our terrible pictures. Not really a bad thing I guess.   Finally I asked the bartender where the club was and he said it was downstairs. I looked over to see two people standing at the entrance to the stairs going down into the club. I walked over and asked the girl if I could just go check it out and she said that there was a $5 cover. Now, I'm certainly not cheap when it comes to clubbing, but since I couldn't hear anything coming from the \"club\", there's no way I would even pay $1 to go in. After trying a little harder, she let me go down and what did I find you ask?   AN EMPTY CLUB!   5 people total, including the \"dj\" who was either getting warmed up, or had a twisted idea of what type of music is acceptable for a club since the BPM was probably no higher than 70. As for size, Vessel, which I consider to be an extremely small club, is bigger than Monarch. The back room on the second floor of Ruby Skye is bigger than Monarch. No bueno my friend.   I won't even talk about the neighborhood. I actually don't hate the folks at Monarch for opening up on Skid Row. I'm sure that the Tenderloin will be a lovely place one day. Unfortunately, Monarch probably won't make it long enough to see that happen.",
