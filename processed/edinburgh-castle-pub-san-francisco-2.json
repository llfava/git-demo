From the outside, you'd think that this place is just another one of those loud crowded \"hey I'm cool because I go to bars in the Tenderloin\" scenester hellhole bars. And while it is filled with hipster douchebags, the inside was a pleasant surprise. Tables line the wall instead of being in the middle of everything. Pool and darts on another level so you're not throwing sharp objects directly at scene mullets. Who would've thought that the layout of a bar should make sense!  They have a wide variety of beers on tap, including PBR. On Tap. That doesn't make sense to me, but if that's your bag, they have it. Their tonic apparently tasted \"broken,\" and I don't think they use actual Coca-Cola in mixed drinks, but my 15 pints of Newcastle tasted fine. The whole place smells like vinegar which made me want to have some of their fish and chips, but I did not partake.  The jukebox is pretty good, too.",

If I'm such a hipster why don't I just loooooove Edinburgh like all the rest of the hipster flock? As of right now, 47 of the 340 reviews of the Castle mention hipsters taking over this place, and yea, I'm not that impressed. Take THAT people that call me a hipster.  Now there's nothing wrong being a hipster and there's nothing wrong three stars either. I find the place to be pretty solid, the usual makeup for a decent pub: jukebox, pool, lots'o'beer.  I think Edinburgh has a nice setup too with booths, tables, dim lighting, and a long bar. I dig the tall ceiling giving it a very open feel. I guess I'm just not amazed to the point of seeking this place out consistently. Been here on a few Friday/Saturday nights, had some beer and whiskey, the purpose was served.  I'll probably be back, and you know, maybe some day I'll fall in love with Edinburgh. If you see a 5 star update from me it's likely I went and met some hot hipster chicks which will drastically alter my opinion. There I go labeling 'hot hipster chicks' all hypocritical like, sorry, but if you're going to have a label it could be a lot worse than that one, I'm just sayin..",

You can easily get into the party or just chill out upstairs if you want to relax.   That having been said, the amount of hippster/emo smug in this place is over-whelming. There's quite a bit. I usually try to avoid these types of places but the damn music is too good. I just don't get the whole scene, in attempting to be unique you're being just like everyone else. Grow up.   Also the bar staff is not friendly. My buddy left a two dollar tip on one drink and a bar man said \"go fuck yourself\". At the right bar that would be humorous but in a loud club when the guy says it under his breath failing to make eye contact, it's just bitchy.   If the bartenders smile I'd give this place 4 stars.

Edinburgh Castle is practically a San Francisco institution. \u00a0Chances are you've ended up here at least once before you even knew where or what the Tenderloin was and before you knew beers better than Newcastle or Boddy's. \u00a0You've done the requisite cab battle outside and probably didn't even know there was an upstairs. \u00a0  In any case I usually find this a great multi-purpose bar. \u00a0It's close enough to downtown that it's a decent meeting point for visitors yet you've ended up here on random weekend nights with your friends so it's a bit of a locals place too. \u00a0The seats can be cramped but that all makes for a more intimate feeling. \u00a0It's relatively neat but with that layer of grime so it feels like it might be a dive. \u00a0The beer selection isn't the greatest though they do have a good range of the United Kingdom's finest offerings. \u00a0The Black Prince Porter is a welcome selection if you're looking for something dark and have long ago divorced Guinness. \u00a0The trivia night is solid and a good outing. \u00a0You know you won't win anyway and the questions are decently difficult that you can give your cognitive acumen a good workout while killing brain cells.  Probably the biggest gripe is the food. \u00a0Everyone seems to tout the fish and chips but I found them sub-average at best. \u00a0The breading was too soggy and soft and it seemed to not only dwarf the fish but also ruin the flavor of the veggies. \u00a0Just like any other bar you really enjoy it becomes a quasi hipster colony on the weekends and competition for a cab after last call could be an Olympic event but weekday nights or three day weekend Sundays are still great.

Walking back down Geary, I saw so many way fancy bars and was glad that we'd gone to such a casual laidback place.

The evening was an hour or two of slow service, poor food, and rude and obnoxious patrons. \u00a0This didn't feel to me like any Scottish pub I have been to, more like an American bar filled with Scottish items and young Americans who thought they were acting Scottish.

Reasonable priced drinks and 2 DJs having a 60s and 70s spin off - dream bar!  There's a fair bit of seating, also enough room to throw down some shapes on the dance-floor with seriously injuring anyone.  Pizza store conveniently located outside for eats after the bar closes.

I like them dark and dingy, with ample amounts of beer flowing from the tap. I especially enjoy those pubs if some dark rugged Scotsman is getting me a drink - hellooooo Gerard Butler!  But strange things are afoot at the Edinburgh C....there aren't any of my brooding Heathcliffs hanging out at the bar, nor are there any loveable football hooligans wandering around drunk.  Instead, there are just lots of hipsters hanging out and looking way too cool for more than staring contests. I enjoy staring contests. In fact, I generally win them. But not in a pub.  I haven't been there on trivia nights, so maybe it's different. Maybe one day I can wander in on a Tuesday and fall smack in love with a lovely gentleman quoting Robbie Burns...but to borrow from that masterful poet about my exit:  \"And like a passing thought, she fled  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In light away.\"  We got the hell out of that place and instead chose to roam with the cracked-out crutches guy on Geary.

I like the more social downstairs area (where the bar is), but the upstairs seating allows for more quiet conversation, perhaps even introspection on quieter nights.

The environment is great, there's a good beer and whiskey selection, and the prices are reasonable though not surprising given the required transit through the Demilitarized Zone known colloquially as \"the Tenderloin\".  The following rant is directed mostly at Captain Sullen Sullenberger aka The Dyspeptic Scottish Barkeep (hereafter S.S.). When I order a drink from this guy, I get treated like the person who (presumably) ran over his dog (repeatedly). At this point, I wish I had. Sullen is the middle aged male bartender (owner?) who over the years has become an enormous poopy pants. To be fair the static-emanating music system, which almost blue-screened my frontal lobe, can give him a run for his money. (Just between us, neighborhood bars in the Tenderloin don't need club music even if the hipsters claim otherwise.) I guess if S.S. really is the owner, game over man, game over!  Seriously though, I don't need to be screamed at \"There's nothing free here!\" and glared at like Dick Cheney in a peyote-fueled drum circle as I take a tonic water that had been served twice to me for free earlier in the night by the much more pleasant Happy-Hour shift barkeep. He had even said \"cheers!\"  In previous years S.S. has been \"chode-like\" aka dickish about ejecting people playing games on the upper level at the end of the night, ruder than other bartenders I have interacted with in similar situations. Perhaps I'm old fashioned, but I don't think it's unreasonable to take 2 extra mins to finish a pool game. I also don't think it's a paradigm shift to treat your customers with some basic respect. When I return the following year and he's still there, I know the same thing will happen. Last night was the final straw. I will throw my lot in with the Irish Bank, Owl Tree, or some other haunt much closer to the AGU epicenter.",

I came here with a few girlfriends after having an annoyingly trendy experience at Jade Bar a few blocks down, and this was a refreshingly perfect counterpoint. Wonderfully divey, mostly empty when we got there but apparently hopping on Wednesday and weekend nights, and great bartenders - very attentive and friendly. My boyfriend had some questions about the huge array of scotch they have, and was thoroughly schooled on the topic by the knowledgeable and helpful bartender.  Apparently they get their fish and chips from a place around the corner, and the fish is light and sweet while the chips are crispy and yummy. Perfect, perfect! We got a couple of pitchers of Smithwick's and enjoyed ourselves immensely.   We will definitely be back, both for dancing and for the trivia night on Tuesdays.",

There is one bar, and there are servers, both of which are punctual and ready to serve. The restrooms are pretty dingy, but you will not notice 2 pitchers in. There is a pool table and dart boards, both of which I don't think I've ever used. There is a jukebox, with some fantastic tunes. And there are...........Fish &amp; Chips.....delivered direct from The Old Chelsea around the block. Listen, I'm not kidding, try the Fish &amp; Chips. They might be the best Fish &amp; Chips you've ever had.......yeah, I said it  DO: Eat the Fish &amp; Chips Drink Magner's on ice Drink Radenburger by the pitcher  DON'T: Forget to eat the Fish &amp; Chips Physically touch anything in the restroom Lean on the railing upstairs Forget that you're in the Tenderloin",

Let keep in mind that this is a local (somewhat dive) BAR...not a fancy touristy venue.   * Drinks \u00a0= Cheap. They have a large bar and usually 2-3 people working behind it so you won't be standing around for too long (except on the really busy nights) before you have a drink in your hand.   * Music = They play great music from almost every decade (50's-present)   * Environment = I like my places intimately lit, especially with x-mas lights. This place does the ambiance right. Plus its pretty large. You can chill at the bar, sit at a table, shoot a game of pool, or have a chat with friends upstairs.   * Crowd = You pretty much get it all, from the working professional to the modern day hipster. I don't like places that cater towards one type of people so I appreciate the diversity. Plus judgmental people suck.   * The last star is just for being a damn good bar. This isn't a fancy lounge. It's a low key place for those who want a cheap drink, listen to good music, hang out with friends or possibly meet some interesting people. I think they set this place up perfectly for just that.",

    "review_text": "I told Frank eventually I'd get around to this review, but I've never had the time to fully log into Yelp and get around to it. Last time I saw Frank, I was \u00a0with two Texans and we (being me and Frank) were trying to convince them about just how big Yelp was in San Francisco. Back Ithaca ways where I am, I barely even knew about Yelp.   But this review is not about my history on the other side of the coast; it's about the greatness that is Edinburgh.   You see, Edinburgh sells itself to me on two principles; it's got charm, and it's not crowded full of a crowd that at most bars could be charitably described as \"lively\" and less politically correct given the name \"preposterous morons\". While some of them show up during the infamous Quiz Night, I make it my business not to, because if I wanted to be around people shouting incorrect answers, I'd go to a campus political demonstration.   Edinburgh is perfectly located around three blocks from my apartment, and is small, and has reasonably priced drinks, and the jukebox is killer. There's all the Joy Division and The Jam and weird obscure funk tunes from the seventies anyone could want, depending on mood.   Plus, Frank is probably the best bartender who I've known in all my days. I'm only twenty-three, but I've cruised enough bars and spent my fair share in the trenches of alcoholism to know a good bartender, and Frank is bad ass. In between a sharp with and tons of amusing stories about knocking head in his years as a bouncer, he makes a mean screwdriver and actually gives a rat's ass if you like the bar, rather than just throwing a drink at you and scowling over a pile of sorted napkins. He certainly improves upon the experience of Edinburgh.   The other part I enjoy about Edinburgh other than location, price, and bad ass jukebox, is how easy it is to bring friends there. Some bars, you have to introduce, you have to say \"this is such and such a place, you gotta understand the kind of people who hang out here\". Edinburgh is the least pretentious bar I've seen, and for the west coast, that there is an accomplishment.   Since coming to San Francisco and having been dragged too and fro all across drinking holes by all manner of malcontent, I can say that Edinburgh is easily my favorite out of all of them.",

Other times, don't care for it so much. Too loud, and last night the guy wouldn't make me a sazerac. A sazerac, a good, honest, New Orleans-invented old school drink which is basically a huge shot of rye. Then when I ask for a rye and soda, we find out he's out of rye anyway. *No* rye? This is a full bar, correct? Not one little bottle? I'll still come here to kill time, but otherwise I'll do my serious drinking at KoKo's, up the street. PS: I think the \u00a0writer-owner of this place has done great things for SF's literary scene. So, I hate to disparage the joint, but as a professional drinker (I write about alcohol and one of my editors was with me last night and we were talking rye) it bothered me.",

A lot of it I've tried to block out. Black out. Whatever. MAKE IT GO AWAY FOREVER. But, for your reading pleasure, a few BENIGN snippets...  One of only three times I've ever cheated on my diet was after Edinburgh Castle. I don't even know how I ended up there. I went to some party at 12 Galaxies and then all of a sudden I was at the Castle, nearly tumbling down the stairs... THERE MUST BE A HIDDEN VORTEX BETWEEN 12 GALAXIES AND THE CASTLE, THAT'S ALL. So how to straighten myself out? Go next door and EAT A PIECE OF FREAKIN' PIZZA. Augh. It stopped me from THROWING UP, but if you don't eat dairy, and then you DO, it ain't pretty -- what FALLS OUT of you, that is (and nearly during the cab ride home; ack!)...  I also came here with my ex of 9+ years, when he decided to come torture -- oh excuse me, I mean, VISIT -- me for a weekend a year ago.   ANDREW: (whine) \"I don't get it Lisa, whatever happened to us? Bartender! SHOT OF JAEGER, PLEASE!\"  LISA: (sob) \"I don't know! We had to do this! You know it's true. Please just let it be. Bartender, ANOTHER SHOT OF JAEGER!\"  ANDREW: (sniffle) \"You realize, after I leave here this weekend it's gonna be different. When I leave here I'm gone, I'm REALLY gone... BARTENDER! MAKER'S NEAT! STAT!\"  LISA: (sob) \"You've been gone for a long time now. We both know that. BARTENDER! GOOSE ON THE ROCKS!\"  ANDREW: (sob) \"No, I mean it's REALLY over. You know wernevergonnabethusaaammme... Naheven... Fruh... Bahtendah...\"  LISA: \"Shottajaaaeguuuhhh...\"  And that's pretty much how that night went, on and on, until we were both so disgustingly drunk that we were sobbing and puking all over each other and pretty much had forgotten why we ever found each other attractive in the first place.  Actually, I guess that night was a success.  ANYWAY! Edinburgh Castle = augh. But then -- hey! I went there last week. I did, once again, get WAY TOO DRUNK. And I was WAY TOO SLOPPY. But it was actually drunk and sloppy and GOOD.  My boyfriend's band was slated to play a show there. Just a few nights before, they discovered they needed to do major surgery on the lineup. The Castle was pretty accommodating of their situation and it turned out to be a good night. It put a positive, less shameful spin on my history with Edinburgh Castle. They wound up with a happy ending and a good crowd of friends and newbies alike. Thanks, E to the C!!!  But all those warm fuzzies aside, I guess they DID still wind up with that very-drunk-girlfriend-of-the-guitarist. To which I can only say...  I'M SORRY! DON'T PLAY AT EDINBURGH CASTLE AND TELL ME TO BE THERE AT 10:00 AND NOT GO ON UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT! I will drink WAY TOO MANY $3 pints of PBR in that span of time and be WAY TOO MISLEAD into thinking I'm \"taking it easy.\"  I cannot be trusted. We still have that history, you know...

    "review_text": "You will hardly ever see me at this place on any night but Tuesday. I mean, I don't live in the Tenderlion, and for my money, there are not many places worth coming to there unless you are from the 'hood yourself.   But Tuesday nights are different. It's the trivia night, and this place has earned its solid spot on the list of good San Francisco's dives largely because of Tuesday trivia.   It gets pretty packed, too. The word of mouth has it that this is the best quiz night in town (arguable statement), but in the 4 years that have been coming here, it is consistently popular.   For fairness sake, I have to admit that Carl-the-quizmaster needs to ease on the amount of scotch he consumes PRIOR to the quiz - otherwise his already mumbly diction becomes incomprehensible slur, sometimes reminiscent of that of Jesse Jackson. And, Carl is starting to run out of quiz topics after holding the gig for 3 years or so. Maybe there is someone else willing to do the ungrateful job of the quizmaster? I know I ain't.  As for the bar itself, it's a pretty huge place with surprisingly little seating space. There are chairs upstairs all right, but then you have to haul your own beer from downstairs, navigating amidst the drunks and pool players, as it can be a long wait for the waitress.   As San Francisco's only Scottish pub, the Castle does have a native manager/bartender and a decent selection of single malts. The manager, Alan, is a grumpy fellow, but he kind of grows on you after a year or so of regular visits. If you've been coming here for 3 or more years, you might even get a steely half-smile from him once a month or so.   The scotch selection is good indeed, but shots are overpriced as everywhere, so it's better to stick to beer, which they have a pretty good choice of as well. There is fish and chips on the menu as well - it comes garnished with grease and vinegar and lovingly wrapped in the yesterday's Chronicle. On trivia nights, do yourself a favour and run over to Chelsea shop round the corner and just get yourself the food, since that's exactly where the Castle fish and chips come from. You can see the Chinese owner bring a batch of them to the pub every now and then. I understand he happens to own Edinburgh Castle as well, which shouldn't come as a surprise as most of San Francisco is indeed owned by the Chinese.  The walls are decorated with obscure Scottish memorabilia, such as a throwing log, old parade banners and lots of pictures of militaristic Scotsmen in funny outfits.   What else can I say? The place has its share of local scruffy intellectuals, many come on their bikes and skateboards. Girl scene is very patchy - some nights, there might be some rare beauty-brains types, while on most others, this place is teeming with ton-of-funs from the lower Nob Hill surroundings.  Men's bogs deserve a special mentioning here. Girls, beware: there is NO wash basin there (except, oddly, at the stall), so think twice before shaking a guy's hand at this place. There is, in fact, a plastic bucket of filthy water with a faucet over it right outside, but I have not ever seen anyone use it to wash hands. I know I haven't.  The urinals are tightly close to each other, European style, without any kind of a divider. Most guys usually wait outside if one of them is occupied, but I normally barge right in for the second one. There is nothing like a feeling of brotherhood when you stand there, your left arm snugly pressed against the right arm of your fellow urinator, especially when he jerks it gently for that final couple of shakes.   \"You shake it more than twice, you are playing with it\", once an ex-sergeant told me. But I think I digress. I'll see you at the next Tuesday trivia. I'll be sure to shake your hand.",

The Gifford Lectures in Natural Theology, held annually at the four major Universities of Scotland: Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St. Andrews. \u00a0Past lecturers include Hannah Arendt, John Dewey, Paul Tillich, and Hilary Putnam. \u00a0Its stated purpose is to promote the study of God through the natural sciences. \u00a0Which basically means the lectures are totally fucking ineffable and full of shit. \u00a0  \u00a0 2. David Hume, empiricist, luminary of the Scottish Enlightenment, and one of Edinburgh's favorite sons. \u00a0Contrary to popular belief, Hume was NOT full of shit. \u00a0Yeah, I went there, you Kantian bitches can take your fucking Categorical Imperative and shove it up your ass.  3. A portly, bearded redhead who shaves his back and wears a tartan plaid kilt which conceals a monstrous Scottish banger in casing.  Unfortunately, none of these three things can be found in Edinburgh Castle. This shouldn't surprise you -- it didn't surprise me. \u00a0Let's face it, I'm a philistine who thinks Scotland is a nation-state on the Iberian peninsula. \u00a0And by the way: is there a reason why \"Edinburgh\" is pronounced Ed-in-brah? \u00a0I'm not one to generalize, but do the Scots just fucking HATE phoneticism? \u00a0Or are they simply trying to drive me crazy, like the rest of you bitches?  So you will not see Hannah Arendt drinking herself under the table. \u00a0You will not see David Hume tossing his Guinness into Bishop Berkeley's face (Idealize THIS, motherfucker!). \u00a0And, regrettably, you will not blow on any bagpipes, kilted or not.  What you WILL find at Edinburgh Castle is a charming, two-level dive with a multitude of banquettes and booths, a shrine to shoegazing author and poet of the heroin drip Irvine Welsh (Welsh? \u00a0In Edinburgh? \u00a0Sorry, my ignorance is appalling), the smoothest beer on tap (Smithwick's), and a killer jukebox that contains, among other notable albums, Screamadelica by Primal Scream and Protection by Massive Attack. \u00a0  Bands habitually play in the room upstairs. \u00a0To the Castle's credit, the cover charge for the show is collected at the entrance to the room, and not the entrance to the bar -- now that's pretty fucking righteous.  They also serve food, though your choices are restricted to standard english pub fare (fish and chips, onion rings) and in fact these deep fried delicacies are actually made at Old Chelsea, the chipper on Larkin.  If you will allow me the indecorous use of The Royal We, WE met a Pretty Male Friend and a Pretty Female Friend here for drinks. As is customary, our conversation turned ribald once the booze started flowing. \u00a0We earlier established that PFF would RATHER fellate an unwashed penis than suck on someone's toes -- don't ask me to explain this, it made no sense to me either, bitch is crazy.  Me: Okay this is interesting. \u00a0So PFF I have another question for you. \u00a0Let's say you have a foot on the one hand, and an anus on the other. \u00a0Which one would you -- PFF: [flustered] Okay! Okay! \u00a0I'd suck the foot! PMF: Hmmm. Me: And now why is that? PFF: Because assholes are dirty. PMF: [turning his head away from the table to snicker] Me: Well have you ever had -- you know? PFF: [shocked] Oh no! \u00a0I've never had anal sex.  Me: Really? PFF: Really. That's where the shit comes out, it's not meant for... Me: For what? PFF: .... Me: Not meant for fucking? \u00a0Is that it PFF? \u00a0 PFF: [blushing] I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Me: [mock indignance] UGH! \u00a0You're a fucking homophobe! \u00a0I hate you! PMF: [laughing] PFF: [laughing] I'm sorry -- I love you! Me: Jeez, why couldn't you tell me you hated gay people before we became friends? PFF: [wounded child eyes] Me: Okay seriously, look, anal sex is PLEASURABLE. \u00a0I mean, it's a little dirty, sure, but sex is dirty anyway.  PFF: I can't do it! Me: Yes you can. Just make sure you've got a lot of lube. \u00a0Oh and some fingering is good too. Loosen the fucker up. PFF: ... Me: And if that doesn't work, find someone with a small dick. \u00a0You won't even know it's there.  Sodomy is the new black and I'm bringing it to a BAR NEAR YOU!",

I mean concert space. I later learned that the place is frequented by Irvine Welsh which is appropriate (acclaimed Scotch thug writer; skip \"Trainspotting\" and read \"Filth\", a true horror story in the vein of \"Heart of Darkness\"). The Castle strikes me as a bar right out of Welsh's books, sans the violence. The place is dark, dank, and surly (in a charming way).",

We walk in and sit at the bar for 5 minutes with no bartender in site. \u00a0Finally, bartender walks up and asks what we want. \u00a0I can tell she's obviously not overjoyed that we walked in kinda late so I gather my buddies' order and we get 4 shots and a beer. \u00a0I put it on a card, close it out, and we sit and talk for about twenty minutes. \u00a0She proceeds to pass by us and wipe the counter down numerous times and even pushed her rag into my friend's arm before asking him to move it. \u00a0Okay... we get it... we should leave soon. \u00a0But the music is still going and people are still sitting. \u00a0We're talking about girl drama, and my buddy is venting to me about a girl that basically broke his heart. \u00a0She walks by and interrupts with \"It sounds like you guys are talking about dogs. \u00a0Would you mind taking it to a table?\" \u00a0I told her we'd be glad to take it outside and that I regretted tipping at all.

    "review_text": "When people ask me what my favorite bars in SF are, I don't really know how to answer; nothing springs to my mind. However, when I'm at Edinburgh, I always enjoy myself, which I guess is what counts, right?  Edinburgh is home to a couple great club nights (1964, Nightbeat), but even on off nights, it's a fun place to grab a couple pints. There are plenty of seats at the long bar, booths, and upstairs (if they have it open.) I always hear how back in the day, they held 1964 in the now closed room upstairs (and curse the fact that I couldn't see that at least once.) Also has a dedicated smoking space up in the front, which is often as packed as the rest of the bar.  The bathrooms are pretty disgusting, thankfully I don't need to spend too much time in there nor actually touch any of the fixtures. But I guess it's kind of fitting for the ambiance of the bar to have dirty restrooms. Reminds me of the 'worst toilet in scotland' scene from Trainspotting.  Can't forget to mention there are also bartenders walking around taking orders for more drinks. What's better than being able to get more beer without having to lose your seat and/or squeeze in between people at the bar?  Definitely a must if you're in the TL.",

The fish &amp; chips are spectacular, the place is nice and grimey just like I like 'em.

Yes, it's quite large and seemingly welcoming, with what seems to be plenty of seating as you walk in but the comfy seating is upstairs and out of the way. The bathrooms are horrendous, I've come in on one night and found one toilet literally being used regardless of it's obvious state of disrepair. Girls giggling and shitting on shit and piss and then pulling their underwear back up over their tights. Hipsters. The booze isn't bad, I don't mind a bar that serves Guinness on tap but then again, so does a few bars in the Loin.  I do remember one fond night, however, where we were surrounded by hipsters outside and my friend (wearing a kilt) decided that for true authenticity he should remove his underwear and promptly did so. In view of all the outdoor chicks and dicks (wearing girl pants tight over their junk, removing all further usage no doubt) who gaped and glared as if the mere disposal of underwear was unheard of. Just because you wear yours OUTSIDE of your clothes doesn't mean everyone has to be forced to wear them. Sometimes a little air flow goes a long way, if you get my meaning.",

We confusedly handed him our IDs wondering, \"is he just pretending to be the bouncer?\" After he engaged us in a quick friendly chat, we sidled into the mostly empty bar and occupied one of the cool booths on the side. I think we were too late for happy hour but the drinks were pretty cheap anyway - like $2.50 for PBR on tap. They also have an upstairs balcony area, a free jukebox, and a pool table. And I can't get enough of their fish'n'chips delivery service and super-friendly staff! The \"waiter\" (another young guy who didn't look the part) kept politely asking if we needed more drinks and he promptly took our fish'n'chips order and brought it over to us along with some sauces.

I was all ready to revel in the pseudo-European pub/American bar mix, knock around a few balls on the pool table, muse over the antique-y Scottish knick knacks, move my hips to Tom Jones and Bug-Thugs-N-Harmony tunes, trying not to put anyone's eye out with darts, and generally just chill with a pint of Hefeweizen.  I did all that but decided I must partake in the famed fish n' chips. I was told they're greasy. Perfect to soak up the beer I had. So I order them. A couple of girls order food around the same time as me. I go back to my group, knocked some more balls and moved to \"What's New, Pussycat.\" What a great song. And boy, do I suck at pool. Can't even hold the stick right, and I'm sober! Hit the white ball into the pocket a couple of times. My friends try to be encouraging, but who are they kidding? I SUCK! \"Superfly\" comes on the jukebox. Then the Clash. Fantastic, my kind of music.   ...WHERE THE FUCK ARE MY FISH N' CHIPS?  Seriously, after what felt like an eternity, I had to go ascertain the whereabouts of the fish n' chips. I was like, how long does it take to fry a freakin' piece of fish? A sign posted over the bar says \"During busy times delivery of fish n' chips may take up to 30 min.\" I look around, there are only 4 groups tops. It's been like over an hour! I'm literally aging over here. My friends tell me they're actually made up the street at some joint, and a Chinese guy brings them over in batches. Then I recall seeing said Chinese guy coming through with a box a little while ago. I go to the bar, and I see the girls who had ordered around the same time as me eating their fish n' chips! AHHHHHH! Did I miss the boat? I go over to the bartender, who seems kind of moody, and say I'm still waiting for my order. He tells me it should here soon. Fine. Whatever. I wait some more.   Finally, Chinese guy's here! He brings my order and a friend's order. I open it and it has 3 pieces of fish, and I ordered 2. My friend's order also isn't what he ordered. I was like, I ain't giving it back, I don't care whose it is, I get this extra piece for waiting that long. It better be the best damn fish n' chips EVER.   And actually, it wasn't bad. Batter pretty crispy and meat pretty soft. I didn't care for vinegar on the fish. The chips were less satisfactory, but by then I was so hungry I could eat shit. Next time? Just go up the street and get it directly from the Chinese guy yourself and bring it to the pub.",

Because of the upper level, this space is good for music and literary events and includes a pool table in the back gaming area. There is generous but not fancy table seating. I prefer the bar (when I can get to it) packed with things Scottish like sports banners, books, coins, and of course, liquor! No kitchen, but orders can be run from a nearby fish and chips place that will deliver your feast in newspaper just in time for the next beer....",

    "review_text": "Behold...The best bar in SF. From the moment I first stumbled into this bar I knew I was in love. The smell of fish and chips filled the room. The taps were all filled with my favorite kinds of beer. The Jukebox was obscure to say the least and ready to be bullied. The bartenders were all nice. I see stairs that lead up to a second floor. So I pass the pool table, dartboards and I make my ascent to the second floor. Wait. What's that? I hear the subtle sound of rock seeping through a tiny door. I open the tiny door to reveal... A rock band playing live in a tiny room above the bar. Awesome! Edinburgh Castle I want to make love to your face.  Now your probably wondering. \"Is there anything bad about The Castle.\"  That's funny you should ask because there is one big problem  TOO MANY HIPSTERS!  There are more tight jeans here then at a Motley Crue concert circa' 87. I was at the jukebox and someone had put on a Miles Davis song. A very attractive hipster girl comes up to me and says, \" Oh my god this is Mile Davis, I love Miles Davis. Did you put this on? Because I love Miles Davis.\"   OK   #1- I didn't put Miles Davis on. I was born in 1981 and I act accordingly.  #2- You don't like Miles Davis. You pretend to like Miles Davis because you think it will make you look cool and hip.  #3- Your not cool and hip. You come across as a condescending douche. Now wash your clothes and get your own personality.  Sorry about that rant. Anyways this place is a great bar. If you hate hipsters you might want to subtract a star. If you are a hipster you might want to add a star. If you don't know what a hipster is you might want to go to Wikipedia.  Wow this is a terrible review. Ignore everything I just said and just go to the bar. Try the Fish and Chips.",

If you are a beer drinker and into the darker stouts and porters, I'd say get a Moylen's kilt lifter. Five dollars for a pint and 8% by volume is one of the best bangs for your buck, and it tastes great. The over all ambiance is on the hipster side, you'll never find a lack of skinny jeans and thick glasses, but I've never had a problem there. There is an indoor smoking section so nicotine addicts wont be left out in the cold, and an upstairs area that allows for better seating. It is still very much a bar with no real dance floor or music to jam out with. They appear to take credit cards at specific times but never during prime time, so you need to rely on one of the two ATM machines they have, or go across the street. Always a fun place to relax or a hot spot to go mingle on a Friday night.",

Really, though, you should stop by edinberg sometime for a few drinks in the afternoon or early evening, or on a night without the DJ's, because their juke box is the reason I'll return again and again to this rad pub.  The jukebox is kind of hard to figure out at first, because the list doesn't seem that comprehensive... that's because by default it just shows you a bunch of top of the charts junk, but if you click on search you can find just about any song you should be allowed to force others to listen to. I'm a punk but had no problem finding all my favorites. The catch: the more rare tracks cost you two credits instead of one (aka 1 dollar).   Edinberg also has the best selection of beer in the area to my knowledge (And I live two blocks away! And I'm an alcoholic!). There's one bartender that's not so good there, but the rest make delicious mixed drinks. The staff are interesting and nice. There are also tables, and cocktail waitresses to come around and take care of your next round without you having to stand up, which in some birthday or celebratory scenarios is a big plus. There is a smoking room so you don't have to freeze to death to get your nicotine fix. I wouldn't exactly call Edinberg a pub except that I'm pretty sure the English bartender owns it... its kind of just a big, nice, wooden bar. \u00a0  Three cheers and five stars for this rad bar!",

Scots are embarrassed to be seen in a theme pub... and one that harks back to home... rather than the alcohol fuelled camaraderie seen in Irish bars, the first time I came here there was almost a hint of shame about the Scots drinking their pints in here.   \"eh... yeah, ah'm only stopping in oan the wey hame fey work likes... I'd go somewhere else but this is oan the wey ken?\"  I am still trying to get my head around the concept of a Scottish theme pub. Thankfully these are not as prolific as the quintessential Irish bar. Still, the same rule applies : Scottish theme bar findeth Scottish people inside. That would also now include me. I always feel pressure that I am not Scottish enough, having left when I was 17 and not having that stick of patriotism that inspires so many. Don't get me wrong - I get bleary eyed when I hear a tune from the old country and get excited about any reference made to home... otherwise you wouldn't find me in a Scottish bar hoping to hear some familiar inflections. It's like an aural hug.   Trivia night was good - I love me a good pub quiz so that and some fish and chips (haven't had any better in the bay area... not that that actually says much)... but need some broon sauce... it's just not the same otherwise. Sorry folks but I won't hold that against you - I was spoiled as \u00a0a child.   I'll go back too - I like the booths on the 2nd floor and the fact it hasn't been uber crowded on the occasions I have had the chance to visit.",

One step inside and you realize that this is pretty much the exact setting for a place within the tenderloin district. \u00a0It is British themed in a sense, and it looks as if it were built at the time that the English were still ruling the colonies. \u00a0It's no coincidence that you can't spell Edinvurgh Castle without d-i-v-e.  However, any real man knows that there's just four things a good bar needs--a good beer selection, pitchers, glasses, and seats/stools for when you've had too many and don't want to have to fall to the ground. \u00a0Edinburgh Castle does well on both accounts surprisingly, but the overall cheap, rustic atmosphere is what makes it work.   Some notable points:  *The only faucets are found within the stall of the bathroom, so if you use the urinal and someone's in the stall, you have no choice but to wipe on your pants. \u00a0 *The ATM spits out $10 bills. \u00a0  If you're looking for a night to go here though, go here for trivia night. \u00a0It starts at 8:30 on Tuesdays, and the entertaining \"MC\" takes you through seven rounds of questions, from Kevin Bacon topics to current events to music. \u00a0Prizes include free beer, as well as cold hard cash.

A healthy amount of beers on tap, and the scotch and whisky collection that is adequate if not good. Felt a lot of the draught beers were flat which happens but is disappointing. I will say all the people behind the bar seems to be having a miserable time. At least fake a smile here guys!  The decor around the bar is really peculiar. There's a mismash of skulls and other weird decorations. For the vibe that was being sent by the music and lighting it's out of place. Kudos to the DJ who was spinning with records.  I'm personally not a fan of the vibe it sent off. I'm not sure if all nights are similar to this (loud music, lots of people, stressed out staff, etc) if it is then I would not go back or recommend it. If you are young, want to be surrounded by a lot of people and got a mild club feel then go. Personally I won't be back as it's not for me.",

The downstairs tunes are courtesy of a solid and diverse juke box which is occasionally preempted by a live DJ.   Tuesday night is Trivia Night and it holds a reputation as one of the best in the city. Fish and Chips are the only thing on the menu and they are rushed over in their newspaper wrapping from a nearby Fish and Chippery. Beer selection is outstanding and my beer-drinking brethren tell me some of their on-tap offerings can't be found elsewhere.   There is a pool table and some pinball machines in the back and a piano in the front room. They have the worst dart board in San Francisco. It is just awful, as are the bar-provided darts. If you haven't figured it out yet, this is a pretty big bar, and can easily accommodate you and your twenty closest friends.   I can't recall if I've ever had to pay a cover to get in. Normally, a cover is only charged for the live music upstairs. Staff is solid and always seems to handle the big crowds with ease. There is limited table service, at least on weekends. Overall, highly recommended. And yes, that super-cute bartender does have a boyfriend \u00a0- and an equally cute identical twin sister.",

Especially the young lady sitting at the end of the bar making-out with an older gentleman who's arm was elbow deep into the back of her pants. Nothing like public finger bangin'. If that wasn't entertainment enough, she then proceeded to climb onto the bar to dance...or something, but ended up knocking off a few glasses and bottles instead before the bartender told her she had to get down. Dangerous, I know, good thing the older gentleman had is dirty paws planted tightly on both of her breasts to help her down!",

I still don't get it... I have to be hammered to enjoy this place. I came here twice, one time to film a scene for a short movie and the second time because my friend was having a going away party. The first time was bad enough, but when I actually stayed to experience the bar during the second visit.. agh. An incident happened when I quickly made my way behind the DJ booth in order to get to the bathroom because it was so crowded and nearly impossible to maneuver my way around. It was an open space, so it's not like I snuck behind the DJ or was scandalous about it. However, immediately after that, some guy working for the DJ GRABBED my arm and yanked me back and yelled in my ear, \"HEY, DON'T DO THAT!\"  This quickly ruined this already cheesy night for me and put me in a terrible mood for the next 20 minutes we were there. It made me angry enough to confront the guy to tell him that was uncalled for and way too aggressive, especially when I wasn't fleeing away from him or anything. He quickly apologized and although I still didn't think it was necessary for him to grab me, I felt better and left the bar in a decent mood. Anyway, come here if you're down for crowded places and cheesy white people. If not, steer away from the Downtown scene and head to the Mission.",

About a dozen people are hovering around on the sidewalk indicating that the inside is probably pretty packed. The door guy has a bored look on his face as he checks your I.D., while you stand in a cloud of smoke being expelled by skinny jean clad 20-something-ers.  As you walk in, you think back to the 1st time you were at the E.C. What was it, '98? '97? A long time ago, when it was brightly lit and filled with average Joe's out for a post-work pint. Tonight, it looks like a frickin' hipster bomb went off, because all you see are shag hair cuts (circa 1982), studded belts, horizontal stripes, and Vans. Whatever. You're there, it's been a long night and a drink is in your future.  While the clientele has changed, you notice that the bartenders have not. Rough around the edges, the handle-bar mustached bartender gives you something close to a \"What'll it be?\" Your friend looks scared. While he does seem a bit intimidating, you flash a smile and keep it simple. No pink drinks here. This is a beer and shots kind of place, so you order a couple of Fernets with ginger backs. All paid up, you grab your drinks and step aside for the loaded couple who are practically falling over each other and you. A couple of frat boys who seem to have lost their way to the Marina make a sloppy attempt to chat you up. Not in the mood, you find your way to a big booth and toast your friends at the sheer luck of finding seats on such a crowded night.  Overall, as your crew starts to get a little boozy, voices growing louder and louder, you notice little things about the E.C. You see it for what it is. A dive bar. There's a red lantern candle on the table giving off a nice rosy glow. The music is really loud, which is why you can't hear anything significant from your friends conversation. You like that he drinks were pretty reasonably priced, and once you got the bar keep to crack a little smile through his handle bar 'stache, you think that the staff is almost friendly. You also realize that their service style is not completely inappropriate considering the crowd of inebriated hip kids around this Tenderloin bar.  You yawn. It's really late. You look over to see your incredibly drunk friend weaving and wagging her finger in the face of a tall hipster guy who has a mildly amused look on his face. Yep. Party's over. It's definitely time to leave. Once you get outside, standing in the cloud of smoke that's still lingering, you think to yourself, \"That was actually pretty fun. I'll be back.\"",

Before they had a vehicle to transport their gear they would use mine putting me there around 8pm waiting for them to play a show which they say starts at 9 but really doesn't get goin till around 11. \u00a0Some of the times i have been here I have only had one beer since i had to drive all the equipment back to the Mission. However more recent times the band has found a new way to transport their goods. I get there 30 minutes early just long enough to order a few drinks and walk around socializing. They just got a new sound system going which sounds great.   Pros  * Only $5 to see a band * bands play upstairs away from the rest of the bar * very spacious   Cons * Parking is horrible if you are trying to park, but if you are just unloading gear you can go around the back * That damn puddle of God only knows that i slipped and fell down on the last drunken time i was there (people laughed, it was sad)  I love this bar. I have brought my parents to this place to see my boyfriends band. My boyfriend brought his family including his grandma. People are friendly. People are dancing. It is a everyone coming together kinda place.  4 stars would have been 5 if i had not slipped on that puddle.  -------ps--------  September 28th, 2007  Better Than Aliens Tempo No Tempo Red Rocket My Second Surprise  will be playing a show come check it out if you have nothing else going on!",

My only reservations about this place are there's a roughly 3:1 guy:girl ratio on the busy nights, and the crowd can tend toward people who wear leather or ripped clothing, or otherwise put some effort into looking tough.",

Well, I made my way up to Geary St., avoiding some hookers, and some other ne'er-do-wells in the shadows, and made it to a castle enshrouded in mist: \u00a0Edinburgh Castle.....Pub.  Yeah, I didn't expect to see an actual \"castle\". \u00a0Looked fairly tourist-trap-like. I peaked in the windows and saw a few people, but it was fairly dead. \u00a0I decided to man up and give it a go. \u00a0I headed to the bar. \u00a0Other than the barkeep, I was the only other person in this fairly expansive area. \u00a0I must admit, I did like the space. \u00a0The bar was old and woody. \u00a0I saw a grip-load of brews on tap. \u00a0Yes, there were some from the Old Country, but there were many local microbrews. \u00a0I saddled up to the bar, and went with a \"Death &amp; Taxes\" ale, and later a Lasgunitas IPA. \u00a0I watched the muted Olympic cross-country skiing race, as the bartender watched some sort of British movie awards show.  The bartender was nice, mellow, and treated my loner-self well on an evening when I was in the dumps. \u00a0After his award show, he muted his show and popped in some music. \u00a0The first song sounded Celtic, but I couldn't place it. \u00a0Next, there was a Cowboy Junkies song I had never heard of (but my ears gravitated toward), and then he played a T-Bone Burnett song. \u00a0In other words, this bartender was a phenomenal DJ. \u00a0All in all, the music, the brews, and the company turned my evening around. \u00a0I'd go here again in a heart beat.",

Over the years it has slowly and steadily gone down hill.    \u00a0 When they started doing club nights, I though that would be a good addition, I was wrong. The Castle has transformed from a TL locals/ average joe's type of pub and turned into an unwelcoming hipster bar. The current trivia MC is horrible, no sense of humor, unpleasant, a speech impediment( not good to have when running a quiz) and basically a jerk. Service had always been poor and somehow it has gotten worse. The space is cavernous but poorly utalized, always cold and they have no regard to maintain it, rather just let it continue to deteriorate. Prices have climbed, it is mind boggling how a TL bar can charge $6 for a standard pint. They are by FAR the most expensive TL bar you will go to, Hell they might be the most expensive bar in 1 mile radius. Alan seems tired as if he no longer wants to be there.    \u00a0 They still bring in the fish and chips from the Old Chelsea, and I stand by saying they are the best in town. So with fond memories and the fish and chips, I can muster 2 stars. It pains me even more to say I will never intentionally go there again.

It's so predictable that friends who don't play trivia have stopped by here on a Tuesday to say hi.   Yes, the quiz is tough. Luckily (well, for me), my teammates are damn smart, so we usually do well. (Don't be mad.) I'm just there to add my two cents in the picture round. And drink lots of beer. My complaint would be that it tends to go loooong. It starts at 8:30 and usually isn't over til 11. It seems like Carl (the quizmaster) is trying new ways to make it go faster, but it's still lagging.   They have a limited staff -- one waitress (Kim) to serve the entire place (and the quiz usually has 20+ teams), but she's on top of it. Tip her well! As for the guys behind the bar... I've never seen them crack a smile. If you want fish &amp; chips, they are brought in from a place around the corner on Larkin. It could take a while, so if you're starving, you'd be best off just running over there between rounds and grabbing them yourself.   If you do want to check out the quiz, be sure to get their early. Tables go fast, and if you get there at 8:25 you'll find yourself standing.  Also, if you come here on a Tuesday, but aren't there for the quiz, beware. We tend to take it pretty seriously, so if you're loudly talking at the bar while Carl is reading question, the folks around you will probably shush you. Don't get offended.

This place also has a full bar, decent jukebox, a pinball machine, open upstairs section (rumor has it live bands play up there) great Tuesday night trivia and good happy hour specials. \u00a0If you are a smoker there is a ventilated smoking room complete with beat up piano. \u00a0I've been known to wail on the poor beast and sing like a wounded seal with emphysema driving the rest of the smokers outside (usually after too much Kilt Lifter and Fernet).  On the weekends during the day they have free pool and pretty good bloody marys. \u00a0One of the bartenders makes a mean \"porn star\" dirty martitni which he makes by muddling olives and ice together. \u00a0It's the money shot of martinis.   Bring a small flashlight and check out the bar sometime. \u00a0It is resin poured over old British pence. \u00a0The newest I found was from 1968 and the oldest I found was from 1899. I've been known to pick up some Mexican food from Mid City Foods down the street, bring it in and enjoy some Kilt Lifter and Fernet with my dinner and gaze at the coins with my key chain flashlight, occasionally striking up conversations with random people.

I will jam to No Diggity any day of the week (no doubt!)  The part of me that hates it...well, it's in the TL, so you have to politely decline offers for crack or sexual \"favors\" from tranny hookers on your way to the door (or accept those offers, I don't know your life; no judgments here). There was a $10 cover on a Saturday night which I think is lame sauce. The place was suuuuuuper crowded, in an uncomfortable, \"I'm in the middle of a sweaty concert crowd\" kinda way. Even that wouldn't be SO bad if the crowd wasn't full of groping fiends. Come on, bros! Me squeezing by you in a crowded bar so I can make my way to the toilets is not an invitation to touch my heiny! But that's the kinda crowd that frequents this place on a weekend evening, I guess.  There's also a patio (?) area for smoking but that smoke smell does not remain in that area. If you're sitting near the door to the smoking area, be prepared to get your daily dose of second-hand smoke. Pretty disgusting for a non-smoker like me.

If I am going to go to a place that feels run down and old and has an irresistible charm nonetheless I want that charm to be authentic not created in a focus group and processed with a dive bar coating.

I want odd bartenders and even odder patrons and I want pool, a juke box, and food that probably shouldn't be served from a bar. Check to all those things and more.  Edinburgh Castle is a no frills dive bar that has feels like a pub you would find somewhere in Scotland or London. I have gone on trivia nights on Tuesday which I would recommend to everyone. The host is funny and doesn't take the game too serious but actually runs a really great game. The bartender I have had is always this kind of surly older gentleman but he will get to you eventually. The beers are super cheap as you would expect as well, especially on tap.   The area around Edinburgh isn't the greatest but people who don't look like tourists or don't have their money and cellphones dangling about in their hands really won't ever have a problem. Its the secret those of us near the tenderloin keep to ourselves. There are actually some really great places over here and if the yuppies are too scared to venture here because of what they heard about an area then its all the better for us.   I haven't been there for the apparently packed Friday and Saturdays but there is always room to meet up with friends or grab a seat at the bar when I have been here.

Why? Several reasons; 1. Cuz I like whiskies. While I usually don't participate in the Scotch vs Bourbon rivalry, when I want scotch this is the place to go! I brought my twin sis from NYC here cuz we share the same love of whisky and have the same nose and lips. Are they related? I'd go with nurture over nature on this one. The cocktail waitresses and bartenders are sweet, they let us sample two different scotches before each round of scotch on the rocks. Too bad I don't remember which I liked best. 2. Live music. I even played a show here once and would do it again. Like the Hemlock or Elbo Room, you can drink in one room and if you feel like paying a small cover you can catch some local music in another. Though I think this may be only one or a few times a week.  3. Rockin juke box. Band upstairs sounds boring, I'd rather have another scotch on the rocks.  4. Fish and Chips. I always say there needs to be more watering holes that offer food, a fine distinction between restaurant bars. Fish and chips are super sustenance.  5. Pool table, and a substantial variety of beers on tap, always a bonus. 6. Smoking area. Well, there isn't one, but guess I can't have everything. five outta six stars.",

They have a good selection of beers and hard alcohol with your usual average drink prices. With the normal busy bar scene, the bartenders were pretty nice. One bartender couldn't remember how to make a drink, but gladly asked me the ingredients and proceeded to making it. As we ordered more drinks, they become fairly generous and therefore we had stronger drinks (yay!).  Food? Yes they have food. Fish &amp; Chips, that sort of thing, but it comes from a place down the street. According to the sign it takes a little longer due to that.  Overall the place was clean, and busy as any other dive bar would be. The usual bathroom situation for women: a line.   What I take away from this experience: \"hipster\" black rimmed glasses that eat your entire face up are overrated. they don't make you cooler...",

It took me a year to get over that before I could start eating them again, (and this is coming from a person who has eaten at Tu Lan *despite* having a degree in public health!)",

The Guinness here is very tasty, not too cold, and it takes about 5 minutes to pour which is always a good sign. The bartender was cool and the music tolerable (mostly b-sidey Clash-sounding tunes).

Pluses include indoor smoking patio with a piano you can play freely, a pool table, darts, lots of booth and bar seating, an upstairs lounge area, clean bathrooms, and delicious fish 'n' chips. Not joking, these might be the best fish 'n' chips I've ever had. Even my British friends agreed they were pretty amazing. I just wish they came with tartar sauce.  One complaint (that really has nothing to do with the bar, and everything to do with sketchy people) a friend got her purse stolen while at the bar (and there were hardly any people there at the time). Just be careful with your things as this may not be the best of areas to leave your valuables unattended. The bartender felt bad and tried to help in the search, but there was really nothing she could do. Lesson learned.

Though my friends and I had such a fun time and I had just been there the weekend before to encounter tons of foreigners who bought me plenty of Fernet and cokes, which was cool in and of itself, but still, nothing really came to mind that made this drinking experience different than any other. But then I decided, maybe there was something awesome about Edinburgh.  We pranced over after checking out a couple places in NoPa to discover that the bouncer wouldn't accept my friend's passport as her ID. We started to get sad, but then he said he was just kidding! Oh man, this guy's got jokes. Next, we walked in to find that there was a $10 per person cover charge. Sadness reinitiated, as paying covers suck and we only had $6 between the three of us. But then, lo and behold, this bouncer accepted our $6 offering and let all three of us in! Childbearing, periods, and lower pay aside, being a woman has it's perks.  Heading inside we approached the bar, ordered three beers and went up to the top level to look down over the fake rooftop awnings above the main floor. It's such a cute and fun atmosphere, you have to be a real beezy to not at keast enjoy that.  The night continued, hip hop came on, and the drunken white girl in me had to make an appearance. Enter the first bouncer who gave us good natured grief about the passport, commence grinding / dancing / actin' a fool, but who cares it was so fun and he didn't seem to mind.   As we walked down to the main floor for another bevvy, my friend reached into her purse and pulled out a pair of those funky false hill billy teeth, so naturally I put them in and started dancing more. I, and anyone who came within one foot of me, could not keep a straight face. Yes, we were all surely tispy and reading this you may think I'm an attention whore (which I am), but it was hilarious.   All in all, an awesome night. Cheap drinks, great music, entertaining staff. One of my favorite TL bars and not too many pretentious hipsters, so that's a major plus.",

Those greasy fish and chips hit the spot, and the beer selection is good. \u00a0Good jukebox but it needs more trashy, glam, punk rock selections IMHO.   As far as the service goes, it seems like everyone else I go in San Francisco: the bartenders are lame but the cocktail servers are always really cool and kick-ass chicks that are always ready with a wise-crack and comped drinks. As a former bartender/woman in the service industry and fellow sassy, kick-ass chick, it is always cool to deal with/order from these gals.  (Also, there is another reason I've come to like this place but I cannot spill because I do not need the competition. ha, ha.)  ****edit 5/24**** Upgraded to 5 stars because of the kick-ass time I had last night at the '1964' party. \u00a0I had no idea what it was and when I followed the baby hipsters with the entire Urban Outfitters window display on their backs imagine my surprise at some kick-ass 60s blue-eyed soul and dance music blaring away. \u00a0As I am a dancing fool and a sucker for good music, I tore it up on that floor. \u00a0Now I know and will wear appropriate footwear next time. \u00a0And I even managed to hold down a snicker while dancing b/c, God bless 'em but, those damn hipster babies do not have one iota of rhythm in their skinny little 20 year old bodies. \u00a0But who cares? \u00a0Dance on with yo bad selves!",

What's that got to do with anything? The place is cool, straight up. Like anywhere in the city, it's bombed on a weekend night, but the bartenders have never given me so much as panicked service, and they do seem to follow a fair and respectable queue at the bar. The upstairs serves as a lucky-if-you-are sort of area, a nice respite. Shows can be intimate as well, but I never really mind that.  I too had a bit of an \"episode\" with the fish and chips, what my aunty might call \"the boots\" (and yes, that's onomatopoeic and biophysical).

They allow people to bring in food so generally I stop by the Thai House Express and get carry out. The Castle also has a pretty generous selection of beers and some hard liquor. Definitely worth braving the 'Loin on Tuesdays for trivia night.",

I've seen emo kids, hipsters, punks, and business people, all merging together to grab a few drinks and hang out in the evenings.  The bar is dark, with wood all over the place. The old rickety stairs are kinda scary, but they're cool in their own way. Leading up those rickety stairs is a cool little space where I've seen some great bands playing. Usually a lot of local flavor there, and the people watching the shows are always there for the music, and not because \"someone said it would be cool.\"  I went here once for a pub trivia night...it's kind of a joke. I mean, it's fun, but it's super loud and you can't hear the announcer and typically, it goes on for nearly forever. It's definitely something you can't do if you work early the next morning.  Overall, cool place. Drinks are decent and usual price. Sometimes hard to get a drink at the bar, but that's usual. Oh...and you can order fish and chips to be delivered there. Great on a cold evening with a nice glass of beer. :)",

I have to give the nod to Edinburgh though cause the shows are way cheaper, there is room to move around and the crowd isn't completely oozing hipster sleaze attitude! Good beer selection, fish &amp; chips available till 11pm served UK style in a newspaper &amp; the pizza joint next door is one of my favorites in SF! The only 2 complaints are the dart board is so hard that maybe 1 out of 3 darts will stick and there is always a weird smell when you first walk in. Of course all this is really meaningless after a couple of beers to the head.",

Anyway, great divey sort of bar. Endless supply of 1664 and the fish and chips they bring in is extra greasy and good. Fun bar to go to at any time.   I've noticed more of a hipster infiltration as of late though. Nooooooo you punks! Go back to the Mission!",

In terms of demographics, I think it's mostly partiers from the Polk Gulch that wandered a little too far into the TL.  One reason I'm hesitant to go back is the smell. There is a smoker's lounge in the front of the bar, and the scent definitely wafts back into the regular area. But besides that, there was also a very distinct vomit/urine smell that permeated the whole place. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was just one of those nights, but I'm not sure it's worth going back to find out.",

The selection is very large.   *Did I mention a pool table? How about a dart board? Well, yes, they have that too.   *They're choices of beer are impressive...all though Midas Touch is no where to be found.. **Hint -Hint***  And don't be frightened because it's in the TL...people are harmless, I think it might be from the contact high folks get from standing close to the cannibus club right next door.
