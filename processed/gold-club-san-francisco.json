It was a lot less seedy than I'd assumed, but a strip club is a strip club and I still didn't feel all that comfortable eating from the buffet. Truth be told I did have some sliced fruit and a cookie and I was totally fine afterwards. If you do eat there, you really can't beat the price of $5.00 for an all you can eat lunch buffet while watching naked girls.   From what I saw, the strippers weren't pushy like I've seen some girls do at other clubs. If I was a guy, I'd think this would be a plus. As far as drinks go, I stuck with beer because the bartender made my cocktail really weak.; so weak that I wasn't even sure if she'd actually added any alcohol. Grrr!  I didn't think I'd have so much fun there like I did because my self esteem is so shitty and I thought I'd be hella insecure, but it was different being around friends. I especially got a laugh from one of the strippers being fascinated with my breasts. (I forgot her name, but she was the best stripper there! She was doing all types of Cirque du Soleil stuff on that pole! It was no surprise she'd made the most tips). She kept wanting to grab them and take dollar bills from them with her teeth. So, she gave me the name \"Big Titties\" for the duration of my time there which she kept yelling out every time she saw me.   Definitely an upscale venue I'd recommend to both men and women and/or couples.",

This was the buffet spread the Friday we were here - fried chicken, BBQ ribs, sandwiches, salads, steamed veggies, mashed potatoes, and desserts. I probably missed a couple of items but you get the gist. I really liked the fried chicken here. For a buffet, my pieces were nice and crispy on the outside but still moist on the inside. I suspect there is a faint dribble of honey in the batter that makes it extra yummy. The ribs, while a little tough, were delicious too. Remember again, this spread is setting you back only your $5 cover. Paired with salad and a brew from the bar, I was a very satisfied diner. Which is interesting when you remember you're not in a restaurant and you notice the ladies with their acrobatic skills in front of you...  ... think of it as a meal and a show. They were truly talented and professional - nothing sleazy at all. In fact, you could almost say it is Cirque du Soleil-esque. That is until you leave the dimness and anonymity of the club and re-enter the brightness &amp; traffic of a Friday afternoon in downtown SF. Good times.",

They remodeled a few years ago with better seating and d\u00e9cor so it looks more like a classy nightclub than a titty bar. It's a little off the beaten track from the other clubs, which I like. You don't have to deal with the seediness of the Tenderloin or the drunken craziness on Broadway (though that can be fun sometimes). \u00a0They're in SOMA, convenient to BART, the mega mall, an a bunch of other places. \u00a0Oh, I just found out that they let you in FREE when you flash a convention badge (they're practically next to Moscone Center). \u00a0I wish I knew that when I went to Wondercon.   For the most part the girls are all \"7\" or better. They're a couple \"butter faces\" and maybe one or two cover models. \u00a0But this is coming from me: I'm not incredibly finicky, I like all women. \u00a0One of my favorites is Yoko, of Asian persuasion with nice curves and very \"hands on.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  My last visit was on a Sunday night. It was nice and mellow. I usually sit at one of the tables next to the bar. \u00a0Sitting next to the stage hasn't really appealed to me. Sure, it gets you closer to the dancers, but the experience and be hit or miss. Some dancers don't get close to you at all and totally ignore you.   They just added a hanging tapestry for acrobatic acts. I haven't seen one yet. I think only one girl does that right now.  The girls do $20 table dances but I normally get 2 lapdances for $60 in the curtained corner area. The dances aren't done in enclosed booths like Centerfolds.  There's a VIP area upstairs for $10 more. I don't really go up there much. To far from the energy on the main floor. It's cool if you want more privacy with a girl.   Being a topless place they can serve drinks, but they are way overpriced. I paid $7.50 for a Corona. (-1 star) It's what you'd expect from a place like this.  One last thing: bring lots of CASH.

The $5 buffet lunch is one of the best deals you'll ever find anywhere in the FiDi/SOMA area, and definitely makes it very worthwhile even if you don't like to watch topless girls dance around. \u00a0The food selection this time around included salad, fried chicken, spare ribs, steamed veggies, and some delicious mashed potaters and yummy cookies.  The crowd was more diverse than I thought it would be--that is to say I expected to see a bunch of old pathetic men. \u00a0Instead the crowd here was what you would expect to see at any other establishment in the area, including several groups of just women around. \u00a0  I'd been in one strip club in my life before this past Friday, and it wasn't a bad experience since we'd had \"coupons\" for free entrance and lap dances. \u00a0So, the idea of paying $60 for a few minutes of having a girl pretend that she likes me didn't appeal a great deal to me. \u00a0I can only recommend it for people of similar tastes for the Friday lunch deal, otherwise the strip club connoisseurs can review the rest.  All in all then, Friday was as great a lunch experience as any as I'd ever had before, though I can't give it ***** in part because of a lack of a promised Luis lap dance.  Also a tip, it's extremely dark inside, so be wary when you step outside in the afternoon on a sunny day--it's like staring directly into the sun.",

It was only five dollars, so I wasn't expecting much. Went in, paid 5 bucks (they weren't kidding)! Stood in line for the buffet--the line wasn't that long. The buffet isn't HUGE. There are around 12 items on the table. I didn't get the salad, but I heard it wasn't that great--tastes like store-bought salad.  I grabbed some fried cheese. I didn't know it was fried cheese initially (I thought they were fried tofu, to be vegetarian-friendly, haha). I'm glad I got them because they ended up being my FAVORITE item. The fried chicken was also pretty good. It was very oily, fatty, juicy and tender. Not bad at all. The cookies, however, were disappointing. They are not good at all! Maybe I've been spoiled by all the good cookies I usually get at French and Italian bakeries! But c'mon--I can make better cookies than the ones here. Oh well, I can't complain, keeping in mind that this is a five-dollar buffet. The tiny chocolate thingies were delicious though. I wish I had gotten more of those.  Okay, for those not looking to read about food, but rather the strippers... I wish I had enough experience to review them. I don't because this was my first time at a strip club. Some of the music the club played was a bit weird--didn't match very well with the dancing strippers. For example, I don't think \"Super Bass\" by Nicki Minaj is exactly appropriate. I don't think the strippers were trying that hard either, they didn't do anything too fancy, except for one. Can't blame them, especially with people concentrating more on the food than them during lunch!",

    "review_text": "I haven't been to a lot of strip clubs in my time but a couple of weeks ago I was required to since I was in a bachelor party. I ended up leaving the club at 2am thinking, \"why the f**k don't we come here more often\". Now, you may be thinking I was talking about the naked women but that was actually at the very bottom of my list of pros.  Here's a quick breakdown of why I like this place:   * The $20 cover keeps the barrier to entry at a nice level (less crowded).  * The music was freaking fantastic (and no they didn't play U2 all night).  * There was a noticable lack of douchebags (strange for SF on a Saturday).  * There was air conditioning and plenty of seats so it was very comfortable.  * Getting a beer was super easy (the drinks are all $8)  * It wasn't all guy customers, there were girls there as customers as well.  * There were really attractive women dancing. (see, I put this at the bottom of the list!)  Seriously though, I am giving this place five stars because it was one of the easiest nights out in SF in a very long time. Compared to going to Harlot or Slide, this was a breeze and we all had a great time just shooting the shit, while having a few beers.   In the future it'll be very hard to decide to go to a regular club in SF at 11pm on a weekend night, you just know you're going to deal with more hassle than you do at the Gold Club. Nice job Gold Club, you paid attention to the word \"club\" in \"strip-club\" and did a great job.",

In response, the fatty in me said, \"I'm there!\"   We got there around 11:30am and were one of the first people to go in. Make sure you come early so you can grab a table! Walking in, I realized that the venue was a lot classier than I assumed it would be. We beelined for the buffet in the back and started piling our plates. They have salads, sandwiches, beef (yum!), fried chicken, fruits, and cookies! What more can you ask for with just $5?   The tables downstairs are smaller and can fit around three people. We went upstairs where there were bigger tables. It's pretty dark upstairs, so it might be hard to see what you're eating.   Food aside, the strippers weren't all that great. I can't really complain since it is lunch time, right? Most of them didn't seem like they were too into it and some did some questionable moves. (As a girl, I didn't find some of these moves \"sexy,\" so it makes me wonder if guys find those moves sexy too...)  Now I can say I've dined at a strip club for just one Abe Lincoln! ... not that it's something I would openly talk about, I guess? :p",

The dishes were salad, vegetables (carrots, lima beans), cooked broccoli, pasta, chicken wings, lemon bars and snicker doodles.   The salad and vegetables were basically what you get at the supermarket. The cooked broccoli was actually cooked and seasoned well. The pasta was eh. The chicken wings were good but small. The desserts were too sweet. All in all, lunch was good since it was only $5.   There were girls dancing while we ate, which was interesting and a little awkward as we were the few females there that weren't employees. I think the strippers were tasteful. I liked that they didn't get completely naked...or I would have felt a bit disrespectful as I ate (don't know why).   There was actually a good number of guys enjoying themselves...  Why do some guys feel the need to throw money hard enough at the strippers so that it hits them?   It was an interesting experience that I don't think I'll be repeating. However, it's still a very tasteful place.",

The buffet ends promptly at 2pm and they clean up and put away the goods pretty quick. You pay $5 per person at the door and they take card~ alcohol will cost you more inside if you order any.   I wouldn't recommend going with a large party for this place! \u00a0I came with six people and we got seats but only had one little round tables for all of us. They couldn't accommodate more tables because \u00a0it was pretty packed and all the other tables were being used. That made it difficult for us to eat with 6 plates.   The fried chicken was pretty good and the whole experience was oddly satisfying being eaten in a dim setting with entertainers going around.. \u00a0I'd come back again for shits and giggles if I'm in the city.   It's definitely worth checking out atleast once :)",

    "review_text": "Not impressed at all. This review has nothing to do with their buffet.  Why you should care:  Pros: The atmosphere, lighting, and music equipment look to be where your money goes. Other than that, this is no different than a typical nightclub - in fact you may see more nudity at a night club.  Cons: came here for my birthday, the wife arranged this a as a tradition she does every year. We were greeted with a reasonable cover charge $20 each (women included in case you were wondering). Beyond that there was a gentleman in a nice suit who let us know that it was so busy, that it was bottle service only at a table. My wife spoke to the manager a couple of times before coming and never knew that this would be the case. Not end of the world, but though I'd share that in this review. It may be the end of the world if you're not the type of person or group of people to want to share a bottle of Jameson for $275.  Watered Down Drinks: With the gentleman in a suite understanding we'd much rather leave than pay that amount, he made some arrangements to have us seated at a table anyway. We ordered drinks, me a Jameson on the rocks, my wife a red wine, and the couple we were with ordered red wine. I kid you not, the drinks were watered down to the point that the red wine looked more like Kool-aid than what they were advertising for $8. This didn't discourage our friends, who ordered another red wine and happened to fine a piece of what I'd like to think was cork, but given the dim, highly colored lights, we literally couldn't see what it was.  Horrible Lap Dances (non-vip): My wife got me a lap dance in the bottom room there - two girls at once. To be honest, it was very robotic and the girls were obviously trying hard to be sexy but given there is no nudity during this, it was kind of odd and unsexy. That's right, the girls crawl all over you and don't expose anything. In fact one of the girls top was coming off and she said \"i could really get in trouble for this\" to the other girl. Pretty sad considering this was a strip club.   The main stage strip dances are borderline burlesque: The girls go on stage, do one song fully clothed, then do another song fully clothed, then on the third song, they, no joke, will take their top off for about the last 20-30 seconds of the show. Again, not sure what the point of coming to strip club is, if the girls don't strip.  That was my bad experience, interested to know if others felt the same way, I wont be making a trip back here but I'm sure the Gold Club doesn't care about that.",

Carry on.  I finally had free time today and paid a visit with my bf during lunch time. I. Was. Floored. Is this real life? I was expecting amazing food with 3's, maybe 5's tops, for the dancers. But these girls were surprisingly super fit, athletic, and gorgeous.   For FIVE DOLLARS, you get a DIY salad, fruit salad, RIBS, CHICKEN WINGS, pizza, and a nice assortment of dessert dishes. AND A FREE SHOW.   The taste test was superb. Salad and fruit were definitely fresh. The ribs were tender, but not fall off the bone tender. For five bucks, you can't complain, though! The chicken wings were definitely their best asset (among other assets there, har har har). SUPER CRISPY PERFECTION. I can see why others have said it rivals San Tung. As for the flavor, I was hoping for that same sweet and tangy delight, but there was not as much flavor packed on. I would've been happy with any hot sauce to dip it into, though. Then again, I wouldn't want to be touched by people who ate spicy chicken wings if I were the dancers. The crispiness is still unimaginable! I can only imagine the business they'd make with just opening up a restaurant.  It's a fairly large place, but for some reason or another, today was super packed. We found seating upstairs, but it's really dark. Does dim lighting make your food taste better? Haha, I have no idea. But there's a smaller pole upstairs, so we enjoyed a show. One girl was AMAZING. As in she leapt up on that pole and her feet were on the ceiling. Hats off to these gals, they sure know how to rock it. These ladies have 0% body fat and they're confident, so it makes for an even better show. They also play good music and it's not outrageously loud.

I don't go to a club looking for a sleazy dive where people try and pick up girls or the dancers for a good time. We have plenty of bars around town for that. I go for a nice relaxed, safe place to unwind with friends. You need to be able to enjoy some drinks, look at beautiful women, and maybe have a nice conversation while she sits on your lap.  The Gold Club really delivered in all areas for me. The drinks were good and not watered down. They had some food, but generally I think eating at a club lessens the experience. You might as well just rent a video of a girl dancing while eating dinner at home.   The girls were fantastic. Each one was lovely and the few I talked with seemed very nice. Everyone in my group said this was the place we were coming back to next time.

I am not sure if it was the time that we went, but the girls were ok looking. \u00a0They were definitely all in great shape though, but none of them impressed me with their dancing skills. \u00a0They kinda reminded me of Brittney at the VMAs, but not as lethargic. \u00a0I was thinking this is an off-peak time so the on-peak must really be top notch entertainment.   *One tip for the strip club. One of my friends use to room with a stripper and he taught me the mentality of a stripper. \u00a0They are there for your entertainment and feed off your energy so the more energetic you are towards them the more fun they have. \u00a0They actually do get bored up there if no one is hooting and hollering. \u00a0So ladies and gents, cheer for your favorite stripper!",

I can appreciate... and I can TOTALLY hang with the boys.  I really liked the atmosphere, dark and sleek, not sleezy. But not overdone like the clubs of Vegas. I would have given a solid 5 stars if it weren't for the management not letting us sit up front. Since we were a mixed group of girls and boys they put us off to the side, and one of my girlfriends who was a regular was NOT having it. Seemed kind of silly on their behalf since the place was virtually empty and we were spending lots. Respect.  Quesadillas and chicken fingers...mmm....  I met some nice girls, including one who danced for my friend after we had a fun conversation about her sweet little nephew...getting to know the girls is the part we don't let the boys see.

I've heard about how some were so flat chested that any girl could become a stripper. More so, some might even want the lunch buffets to be Monday through Fridays!   So why should you come here? If you're not too shy about seeing close to nude girls while you gnaw on your fried chicken drumsticks and eating like a pig with your coworkers, this is a dirt cheap spot for lunch in Downtown. Although some of the girls are not so attractive, some of the girls here can actually put on a show. I remembered two dancers would actually climb up the strip pole that's two stories tall, then slowly dance her way UPSIDE DOWN with spins and flips and spits fire (I'm kidding about the last two, but she does spin).   In addition to the fried chicken, sometimes they serve ribs!   Well, Happy Friday to you if you decide to come here for a lunch.",

    "review_text": "3.5 stars...  Gold Club is one of the nicest strip clubs I've been to in my life. The place is clean, everyone working there (not just the dancers) were very friendly, and the decor and layout is top notch. If you go during the day the admission is only $5. If you can make it on Friday from 11:30-2pm there's an all you can eat buffet which I hear is pretty good (it's certainly the best deal in town for lunch anyway). The prices of the drinks here are a tad high but definitely reasonable for a strip club. I stuck with beer so I have no idea how good of a job they're doing with the mixed drinks. The chairs around the stage are very comfortable and the girls aren't that pushy when it comes to asking for you to buy lap dances. The ladies here varied but no one was ugly and a couple of the girls were flawless. \u00a0The personalities and approach methods of the girls also ranged quite a bit. I got everything from the Latina who just brushed by me asking if I wanted a lap dance to the skinny Russian girl who came and sat her boney ass on my lap to flirt and get me to buy her a lap dance, to the short Chinese girl who came and sat beside me and seemed more interested in a friendly and lighthearted conversation more than anything.  The two things I noticed about Gold Club that were really messed up in my opinion is that their ATM has a $10 fee and that the regular $20 lap dances take place right at your chair. If you want more privacy for your lap dance expect to shell out more to go off to the side. Every strip club I've ever been to has been $20 for a lap dance that lasts 1-1.5 songs and is off in a separate more private area so this was definitely not a welcome chance of pace.  The worst part of the strip club was actually not their fault but the laws of California. For that I won't take any stars away but it bears mentioning. The first is obviously the fact that strip clubs in CA aren't fully nude (this is common in many states though). Some states have ways around this by not serving alcohol, I'm not sure if there are any fully nude dry strip clubs in SF though. The other more obscure law that is the most f-ed up thing I've ever heard of is California's 6-foot rule. This means that if it's a club where alcohol is served a dancer is prohibited from being closer than 6 feet from a patron once her top is removed (I don't know how this law applies to lap dances). This means that if you like a dancer and want to go sit up by the stage, the dancer will not only not give you any personal attention if you've got a stack of ones handy, but she'll actually move away from you once you come and sit by the stage. How do they make tips you might be asking? Well lap dances aside, people just take their money, walk up to the stage and throw the money on the stage and then walk back to their seat. If this isn't the most ass backwards rules in Otrip club history then I don't know what is. Forget prop 19, they really need to do something about this.  Overall it was a nice club, just get cash before hand, come during the day for a nearly free admission, and keep the messed up laws in mind.",

There was one girl that sat down with my BF when I was talking to some guys about sharing a table, and when I came back, she looked at me, but didn't move out of my seat. \u00a0So we just looked at each other, and then finally she made room for me. \u00a0And then she tried talking to me and stroking my hair. \u00a0I got the feeling that I was being molested, and all I could see were her saggy boobs and teeth that desperately needed braces. \u00a0I felt like we had the ugliest girl in the club talking to us. \u00a0Finally she went away. \u00a0I think she was an overly aggressive stripper. \u00a0Seriously, if we like you, we'll make eye contact. \u00a0There were way prettier girls than her, why did we get stuck with her trying to talk to us?   We finally got a few tables in the VIP area, that had a good view and were secluded. \u00a0And so our group just hung out and ordered some food and watched the show. \u00a0The food surprisingly was good, we had crab cakes, calamari, and pot stickers. \u00a0I don't know if I was starving or what, but I almost at the whole pot sticker plate myself. \u00a0  All in all, not a bad time. \u00a0The girls weren't unpleasant to watch, and minus the one that needed braces, most of them were friendly but not overly. \u00a0They knew their place, esp. with a group of 3 couples, as was our group. \u00a0And for that, I tipped our waitress 40%, as she was sweet, and nice and not in our faces, she let us enjoy our evening and continue our drinking.",

One star deducted for STRICT rules (apparently, where you sit in the VIP area had a direct affect on which body parts you can touch.. and I'm a girl!) One star deducted for average looking, stiff, untalented, B-O-R-I-N-G girls (the only chick that could actually move looked 40).  Leaving two stars for a decent sized club setup and Delicious chicken fettuchine alfredo!

    "review_text": "Not really a fan of these places but compared to the one I was at a month ago in Ensenada, Mexico for a bachelor party, this place is a lot more classier with way less fear of catching a venereal disease from a simple lap dance. \u00a0Was told the gals here are hotter than at the other local clubs but it appears to be that way within the club when it got later into the night. \u00a0There was literally a shift change somewhere in between 11pm and 12am. \u00a0Maybe the early dancers went on to dance at the other clubs as most patrons do get liquored up as the night progresses and boobs all start to look the same.  It's probably a given that drinks here are pricey. \u00a0We had a bottle of Goose for $350, then 3 of them from the bar for $34.50. \u00a0Seems like the bottle is the cheaper way to go until you realize the dancers sit with you and start drinking it too so when you're paying them $20 for a dance, it's actually costing you $30 after pouring them a drink. \u00a0 \u00a0  The downer of the night was when one of the dancers called my boy a jack ass. \u00a0He had her sit on his lap for at least 20 mins and eventually he didn't buy a dance. \u00a0One of them got butt hurt, I wonder which one, haha.   Overall, you're paying for a service and you get it here, from the valet to the doormen, to the hosts to the waitresses to the dancers who seemingly start to have the same name as your ex-gf when you ask them. \u00a0They'll be who you want them to be for a price.",

I'm not sure, but I think losing my strip club virginity in the name of searching for cheap fried chicken might be one of them!  If you go to Gold's during friday lunches, they have a buffet. After paying the $5 cover, you can enjoy salad, ladies, fruits, ladies, roast beef, ladies, cookies, ladies, and fried chicken. Salad includes chick peas, cherry tomatoes, spring lettuce leaves \u00a0mix, and ranch dressing. Fruits include cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, pineapple, and strawberries. Roast beef comes with a horseradish sauce that isn't that bad. Fried chicken was pretty good, but get there early if you like dark meats.   The place was pretty packed and they opened up the VIP lounge area upstairs. There was a good mix of people there for the strip club, and the people who were there for the food.   As it is a strip club I am reviewing, I am obligated to say: yes, the girls here were hot. Yes I would be greeted by bare boobs when 5 seconds earlier she was wearing full lingerie.

The girls are a mixed bunch.. most do not really know how to work the stage and the poles. \u00a0They have really good buffalo wings--served with carrot and celery sticks and bleu cheese/ranch dressing!!! \u00a0The wings made me forget for a minute about the awkwardness I felt when I realized I was the only non-working girl in that joint.  My roommate finally chose the girl he wanted to receive a lapdance from--this cute Misty-eyed Asian chick with natural boobs. \u00a0She did a great job maintaining eye contact (I am a big proponent in making eye contact while dancing!) throughout her lapdance. \u00a0Lapdances here can range from $20-$300s.. depending on what kind of shoe you'd like.  I made a mistake in chatting with one of the girls upstairs while her customer cut in front of me... I told her it was my birthday and she gave me a hug... later on, she totally was pressuring my roommate and I to buy a lapdance from her. \u00a0At that point, I was already tired and was sad that I didn't have a birthday cake on my birthday. \u00a0I was not feeling the carrot cake they had on their menu, so we left to search for my birthday cake.

First off, you'll notice more than half the reviews here spend more time talking about the chicken than they do the women. There is probably good reason for this, it seems you can actually get the chicken.  I can't lie, most of the girls here are beautiful, model-quality girls. The problem is, girls like that don't want anything to do with you unless they think you've got $1,000 to drop. \u00a0Ironically, I did. After an hour or so, a duo of gorgeous ladies approached me. I took them up on their offer for a VIP dance, to the tune of $200. \u00a0Of course they don't tell you that in order to get a VIP dance, you also have to pay $10 to get into the VIP area. I'm not going to nag about $10, but it is irritating.  To be fair, the girls were very chatty, polite and funny. The dance was OK, nothing special. I don't know if this is typical for the place but for $200 they didn't even pop their tops off... HELLO, that is why guys come to a place like this... \u00a0I had a few more words with the girls, then split.  I'm only giving this place as high of a score as I am because the girls really are amazingly gorgeous here.

Condor is more intimate and that one Lola girl who danced for us privately was amazing. I didn't get any amazing lap dances here at Gold Club. But maybe b/c I didn't go for the private lap dances that are like $300. I got the $80 lap dances for 2+ songs.   The ladies here definitely are prettier than Condor. They all pretty much can work the pole. It was fun to just put dollar bills near the stage. The strippers will even get close to you and move/dance for you since you are tipping. I got to put dollar bills in their thongs or bras too. They love people doing that!  I got 2 lap dances from 2 Asian girls. I really like this petite skinny Asian girl who first danced for me. She was very friendly and sweet. I was too buzzed to remember their names. The 2nd skinny Asian girl was taller, but still pretty. Both of their lap dances weren't all that. I had better at the Condor. They gave me the lap dances upstairs but wasn't private. Nothing kinky happened here, unlike the Condor.

It is topless only, and I've never heard of anyone getting anything more than a private dance, but if you're looking for sex in a strip club you've got bigger problems to worry about. Took a 15 person bachelor party here, the chicks were pretty cool, and we didn't get thrown out - whereas O'Farrell's or New Century probably would have been a disaster.",

I usually dine on Fridays with some lovely co-workers and we either eat at Chevy's, Kate O'Briens or 21st Amendment. but today I rebelled! Instead I went dining with a different co-worker and we went to ......  5 Dollar Fridays!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Wait, let me say that again. 5 DOLLAR FRIDAY'S!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What's that you ask? Well I'm sure previous reviewers have explained it thoroughly enough but I'll try to add something new. It's quite simple really. You walk up to the door where the nice door man opens it for you and ushers you inside. I guess if you look young you get carded (there are mostly naked girls inside after all). I must look old because I've never been carded here :( You hand over 5 bucks (and if you're feeling generous a tip) to the cashierette. Then you walk on inside.   Head straight back to the bar because that's where the buffet is, grab some food, find a table, sit down, eat your free lunch buffet and watch some girls shake what their momma gave 'em.  Here's a few points. First off when you hear the word buffet don't imagine Vegas. Instead imagine a small, intimate pot luck. There isn't a whole lot here. Every time I've been it's the same thing, cut fruit, salad, fried chicken, some pasta or rice dish and a brownie. Oh, they never run out, but the menu isn't varied.  The other point is; 'Holy construction worker Batman!' This place is full of em. I personally happen to like construction workers so all the better for me to entertain myself with man watching.  There's plenty of suits in here too and my friend and I weren't the only girls either. There's always at least half a dozen non-dancers in here enjoying the 5 dollar lunch buffet and watching the show or watching the men watch the show.  Today there was some talent! There was this one girl who did amazing things on that pole. I can't really tell you anymore because I would feel like I was divulging some ancient strip club secret of the variety that  is highly valued, prized and protected. Suffice it to say, you should bear witness to this wonder!  ....then I came back to my desk at my Corporate American job, acted like nothing exciting just happened and wrote this review.  I'll be going back!",

I mean, how many people can say no to a $5 buffet filled with FiDi famous fried chicken?   After some initial apprehension, I went to GC for the first time on Saturday night for a birthday party ($20 cover, guys and girls - bologna!). I was about six or seven sheets to the wind so it was blurry, butt and booby filled evening of making it rain dolla bills on the enthusiastic and flirty dancers. Pretty pricey if you ask me: I paid $14 + tip for a water and a G&amp;T.  Today we went back for the $5 lunch buffet that I only ever heard of from the boys at my old job, talking in some kind of code in the elevator to see if the other was going that day. Today, I was immediately transported to a nightclub, but sober, watching a bored dancer flop around on stage. But it's the lunch shift, so what do you expect?  The food was p legit: lots of fried chicken, quesadillas, pulled pork sliders, salad, fruit, veggies, potatoes, etc. The crowd was a mixed bag of young and older guys and ladies. I felt a little strange catching glimpses of old guys getting grabby with PYTs, but hey, to each their own. I was also really hoping for Korean BBQ as mentioned by other Yelpers, but it was a no go.  In short, go daytime if you like cheap food and a show, go nighttime if you're looking to party in a classier establishment than the T&amp;A's on Broadway. The end.",

With the exception of this one really shady establishment on Bourbon St. in NOLA, this was my first legit strip club and I was not disappointed. It's almost surprising how many reviews I see from friends that I wouldn't have expected to run into in such a place, but there seems to be one solid thing in common...  The infamous $5 Friday buffet.   Stepping through those double doors almost makes you forget that you're in SF, surrounded by tall buildings full of people working. Apparently they remodeled a little while ago, and the place has a much more Vegas-like vibe to it now. While I can't really compare, I like how it looks! I made my way over to the buffet, where I filled my plate with artichoke salad, fried chicken, and fruit. There were a few other things on the table, but I'd recommend sticking with the chicken! Now I know a strip club buffet sounds sketchy at first, but everything looked great!   Unfortunately... the worst part of my trip here was finding a place to sit. Most of the smaller tables (for two) had been taken, and the medium size tables were reserved for larger parties! My friend and I ended up sitting at the bar, which wasn't TOO bad, but I felt like I had to order a drink (it's rare for me to complain about that!)   After eating, I made my way over to center stage before the time on the parking meter ran out. While the overall ratio of male to female was about 1:1, I was the only girl seated up by the dancer... and I guess that meant I got extra attention! Good thing my pal gave me some cash to tip!",

I was drunk maybe I just told the guy at the front that I am gay.. maybe they let me in for free.. I dunno! My girlfriend and I just sat at the table watching our guy friends have fun.

(ok, not to my knowledge anyway) so I asked a close friend of mine to go with me. I mean, it's a win-win situation: $5 Friday fried chicken buffet lunch. Full bar. Tits and ass.   Getting a lap dance from a hot girl named Felicia (or Bianca, whatever her name is) wasn't even on my bucket list for this year.

Now, on to the food review. The fried chicken was good. Crispy. Seasoned ok, but I thought something was missing, probably a little more salt. Since we came here close to 2pm, they were clearing out the buffet table already. Drinks on the other hand were strong as expected, but it took awhile for them to serve us.  Multi-tasking isn't my thing when I'm outside of work, so between the fried chicken breast in my hand and Felicia's breast on my right cheek, I'd say my brain was pretty much confused as to where to put my complete and undivided attention. \u00a0All I know is, Gold Club, you need to turn up your AC a bit. \u00a0It got a little, um, stuffy in there.

The girls aren't all that if anything i saw about 2 or 3 hot girls but hey everyone to its own taste and over all they are pretty( \u00a0with rarely for strippers not alot of the fake boobies). The place is really classy and very friendly staff our waitress could tell i didn't want to be there so she made conversation with me and even gave me a free beer( keep in mind they are 7.50 for a corona!!!!! wtf ) after a few drinks i loosen up and enjoyed my time alot of the girls wouldn't approach my friend given the fact they thought i was his GF so it was fun playing fetch for him lol . They are friendly dancers not the pushy type, my friend ended up getting a $100 lap dance from one of the chicks in the VIP area n he said it was worth it, over all if ur a first time strip club goer , bringing the girlfriend along, of just looking for a classy place with a nice show i recommend it",

Anyway, this privileged upbringing along with a very brief (1 week) stint as a cocktail waitress in a gentleman's club has made me somewhat of a doyen of strip clubs. \u00a0That and I just read \"Candy Girl\" by Diablo Cody which made me see those hardworking ladies in a whole new light. \u00a0Black light, that is.  Although I was mightily impressed with the setup for the 5 year anniversary (free booze! \u00a0free food! \u00a0 free boo...oh, those aren't free)- I was not in the least bit impressed with the talent. \u00a0Although I'm a big fan of the Xanax, I am not a fan of girls who want MY DOLLAR BILLS ingesting it immediately before going on stage and moving as if they were swimming in a vat of KY Jelly. \u00a0Sure, some of them have some mad pole skills (I said POLE), but on the night of this anniversary, I expected their A game. \u00a0Not their C(omatose) game. \u00a0Sure, the circus acts were kind of neat- trapeze/hanging pole/hanging scarf things- but are those going to be there the next time I come? \u00a0Huh? \u00a0Also, if I place a bill on that bar, I expect to slide that crispness into a g-string that was so lovingly chosen, not have some girl scurry for dollar bills at the end of the song. \u00a0Making a few turns around the pole and staring at yourself in the mirror is not considered \"work.\" \u00a0Sing for your supper, ladies! \u00a0Also, has the \"I'm going to take your money out from between your teeth with my boobies\" gone away? \u00a0I mean, I got boobs in my face, but they weren't from any of the hired help. \u00a0Also, although I should be grateful for the free booze, I was disappointed when they took my champagne away before I finished it. \u00a0  I hear the lunch buffet is fabulous, and I may come back for that, but I can't imagine I'll come here for a fun night at a strip club. \u00a0If the girls on stage aren't having the time of their lives, how can I?",

That's gross,\" some of you might initially think but it's actually worth trying.  My coworkers planned to go for lunch so we came right around the time they opened at 11:30am. We were one of the first groups there so we were able to grab a table more towards the back. The buffet tables are set up on the side towards the bar. We lucked out on the fried chicken as others here have mentioned it's actually good. They had a salad bowl with 4 different dressing options, onion rings, sweet potato fries, tator tots, and build your own cheeseburger. The quality today wasn't that great, but for $5 it wasn't that bad either. Plus you don't really come for the food (at least I wouldn't), it's more for the experience and show.  There were a variety of dancers that we got to see during our time there. They switch out after every song, and most of them had pretty hot bods and different personalities/skills on the stage. They make it look so easy too! A lot of core strength is needed to climb up that tall ceiling high pole! Don't be afraid to walk up to the stage and tip em if you like what you $ee!  Our waitress came often to grab anything she could from our table to make more space and made sure we were ok with drinks. There's a 1 drink minimum per person and it was $5 for well drinks or a beer. So all in all $10 for a buffet, a drink and entertainment on a lunch break in the middle of FiDi is a pretty good deal. I wouldn't come often, more so for bringing a first timer or for shits and giggles.",

Michael had already had something like 4 (four!!) Scooby Snacks!! All I know about the drink is that it is sweet (bleck!) and syrupy. I, on the other hand, love drinks straight up without a chaser. No sugar for me, just on my tits.   So we sat there for a while watching the girls on stage and also the ones walking around. The first to approach us, Akina, was Thai, but didn't stay long. Two other girls also approached and I actually bought a lap dance for Michael from one of the girls who's name is Nina. Boring!! I could tell he was bored, too, so I turned my attention elsewhere. There was an Asian girl walking around with long hair and huge assed tree tattoo on her back. She went on the stage next, and OMG!! I dragged Michael up to the stage...Of course there were six other Korean women at the stage throwing money at this girl. She was gorgeous and totally hot! She came crawling up to me and we had this total eye contact thing going. Michael tried to put a dollar bill into her g-string and she shied away, telling him that she wanted ME to put one there!!

As for the talent themselves, most are middle-of-the-road, hard-working pole dancers. \u00a0They know they're not going to get rich off the lunch crowd so most are aimlessly walking around and dancing asking for lap dances. \u00a0There was one girl (I really can't remember her name) but she really gave it her all and incorporated actual dance/gymnastic moves during her routine. \u00a0Also her eyes still had sparkles of life in them unlike most of the dead gazes that stared into the crowd. \u00a0We tipped her a lot and as we were leaving she yelled out, \"I HOPE SANTA BRINGS YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANT!!!!\"  Overall I'd say that after doing this about six or seven times I've had my fill of the action but I strongly encourage every citizen of SF to engage in a little lunch time debauchery.",

(plus 1 drink minimum)  After a long, FUN night of partying and staying at the W, my girls and I decided to continue the fun and go check out the lunch buffet at Gold Club.  The food was surprisingly decent! They had salad, fried chicken, bbq ribs, corn on the cob, pasta, fruit, cookies. The ribs, chicken, and cookies were my favorites   Even though it's lunch time, the girls go on stage and do their thing. They were all attractive, but not super hot. I'm sure they save those girls for the busy night time. None of the girls came up to our group since we were all girls, but they approached the many groups of men that were there. We were the only female customers there except for one other.  Quite an entertaining experience and all for under $10! Well worth it!",

We tried asking to order the chicken even tho it wasn't lunch, and the waitress said no! :(  Normally it is $20 cover, but thank you Yelp! for the free check-in offer! Also thank you to the nice doorman who let me + 2 boys in all for free, even tho the boys couldn't check in on their phones. NO COVER for everyone? this night is sounding good so far!  The club itself is kinda hard to find, its sign is pretty low key for a strip club, and its located randomly in the middle of normal businesses open for daytime. The decor inside is dark and classy. The menus literally light up, because its so dark inside you wouldn't be able to read it otherwise. I took a picture of the menu, but failed to capture the lighting effect :( But it was very cool!  Obviously not all the girls there were hot. Some lacked energy, and some really needed to do some squats...But there were a few ladies that caught my eye! I'd say the girls were about 50% HOT, 50% OKAY. None of them were seriously beat with the ugly stick or anything. There was one chick in particular who climbed to the top of the pole and was doing tricks that require skill, and not just simply being seductive. I got a lap dance from Nicky, she's part Puerto Rican and Viet, and has a SICKASS tattoo on her back that says \"only God can judge me\" in Viet. She was cool :D  Some girls would periodically come over to our table and \"flirt\" with us, but it wasn't too the point where it was annoying or overbearing.  If you're ordering food, be aware that it will arrive around 30m-1hour after you actually ordered (for obvious reasons :P) Their food is actually restaurant quality tho which is a plus.  Overall, I'm glad my first strip club experience was here. It wasn't ghetto. There wasn't a buncha creepy guys everywhere. I saw hot girls that could actually dance and work a POLE! Nobody was rude to me. Oh and recognizing so many items from Victoria's Secret is always fun!",

And yes, you might just run into a coworker indulging in more than just the food. (It's only awkward if you allow it to be) But all that aside, you seriously can't beat the price!  Fill your plate with leafy green salad, crispy fried chicken, tuna pasta, churros, rice, fried egg rolls, melty ribs, creamy mashed potatoes, steamed veggies and bread. Then, find a seat either on the main floor or upstairs and enjoy your meal...and the show!  AND if you check-in via Yelp on Sunday or Monday, you get 1 free admission...just sayin'",

Well, sit back and allow me to describe what awaits you at a typical weekday lunch at Gold Club, SOMA's finest adult entertainment/$5 buffet in one...  Did you catch that? A $5 buffet. Yes, the food is mediocre at best, but after heavy drinking the night before, an all-you-can-eat spread of fried chicken, ribs, mashed potatoes (I think that's what they were...), fruit, and chocolate chip cookies on the cheap was welcomed with open arms. I suggest avoiding the tub of ranch dressing. If it seems counter-intuitive to spend your hangover lunch in a bar/strip joint (aside from the fried food), let me assure you it is not. A really dark space with soothing music and slow-moving company? C'mon!  Enter: Phoenix, a testament to womankind and the star of our visit. Without giving away all of her moves, let me just tell you that this girl shimmied up a 20-foot pole in seconds and touched the (high) ceiling with the sole of her 10\" platform shoes! Girlfriend's got some skills. And *most* of the dancers were pretty with nice bods and respectable moves. They also didn't seem to mind a group of girls who were obviously there for kicks and cheap fried chicken gawking at them. In fact, the whole staff seems very welcoming, since this spot gets a lot of business from the SOMA/Fi-Di lunch crowds.  Last, but not least, this trip was educational. Apparently (who knew!), a lap dance is some seriously serious business. I could see one in action in the VIP lounge and it looked pretty gnarly. Never seen one of those before. Surprises abound at Gold Club!",

People are all nicely dressed which adds even more class and level to the place.   I take a star off because of their bar tender - he had some serious attitude issue and he definitely doesn't fit in this whole atmosphere and ruins the great vibe the place has.

That being said, I don't think I'll be coming back to The Gold Club (although I hear the food is decent!) \u00a0Don't get me wrong, there are some lovely girls here (and some not so lovely but it's subjective so at least there's something for almost everyone) but to be quite frank, it was boring. \u00a0  If I'm going to go to a strip club (and lets face it, if they expect any sort of tip from me) I want to be entertained! \u00a0These girls weren't dancing...they were prancing around a pole half-heartedly...I've seen more entertainment at a senior center (you've not been entertained until you see a new, single male resident enter a senior center...the women are like vultures!!) \u00a0But in all honesty, I'd much rather go to a Burlesque Show for quality \"sexy\" entertainment.  What this place is good for is having a decent lounge environment. \u00a0In terms of strip clubs, it's classy. \u00a0The waitresses are nice and even the strippers walking around asking if you want a massage or lap dance are kind, even when I say no thank you.  But I can get that in several other places around the city (yes, lap dances and massages aren't specific to strip clubs...just go to any Yelp DYL!).  Maybe, just maybe I'll make it back here for lunch...but I'm more likely to be entertained by drunk Yelpers who are exhibitionists and do it for free....;-)",

Well, too bad, because it's awesome, and we're all just trying to tell everyone to let them know that this is the best Friday lunch deal in town! For the price of a Subway footlong, you get entry to probably the most \"high - end\" strip club in the city, and a motherfucking buffet with motherfucking coconut shrimp. And tons of other stuff. They had fish and chips, roast beef, salad, brownies, all that. That'll leave you enough to get a $10 cocktail! Which, for a strip club, isn't that bad.   It'll also leave you some cash, so you can shower those hot ladies with paypah! The girls here are pretty hot! Most of them were on the slender side, though there were one or two thicker ones in there. Surprisingly, only saw a few fake titties. (This was the daytime shift, so I'm sure the scenery and \u00a0lineup is subject to change.) Overall, some really hot girls, none of whom looked extremely plastic-y or anything. Most of them could work the pole pretty well, too!   The club itself is pretty big. The decor is nice, sleek, and modern, which is different from the strip clubs I'm used to going to in SF hahaha! The ambiance is classier than most, but it is SO dark in there! Seriously, I almost bumped into a bunch of people on my way to the bathroom. (They're pretty nice for a strip club, too.)  Overall, I really dug the Gold Club. The buffet is a great deal, although I think at regular hours, it's 20 or so bucks to get in, which is kind of standard for a lot of clubs in the city. The girls are gorgeous for the most part, but if you are looking for a more \"hands on\" strip club experience (interpret that any way you want, I'm sure \"hands on\" means different things to different kinds of strip club patrons) then I don't think you'll get it here. Alcohol means topless only, and The girls seem like they take their time hustling and sweet - talking, whereas at some places, it's like, Swooop! \"wanna buy a dance?\"   So yea, it's a relatively classy joint. They serve breakfast, for christ's sake. God, I would love to chow down on some French toast while watching half - naked chicks grind onstage. No, that's not sarcasm, but that's just me. Anyways, if you're looking for a dirty, explicit show, tons of contact, and beaver in your face, then this isn't the place for you, but if you're looking for some hot girls in a non - sketchy atmosphere (it's the only strip club in SF that's not either in NB or the TL) then come on down to the Gold Club, and remember to tip your hardworking dancers!",

The club is dark, there are two floors, women everywhere, and mostly top 40 beats (could be better). The club is mostly full of men and some are creeps who check you out while receiving a lap dance from a stripper. Some strippers are WOW, others are meh. Some got moves, some don't. When it comes to the food, the fried chicken and salad are the best part of the buffet. If you check in on Yelp, you get 1 free drink valid only on Monday's and Tuesday's, guess I saved that one for later.",

Awesome comes to mind, but falls short. \u00a0\n  I hear people talk about the objectification of women, how terrible strip clubs are, how they are degrading and immoral. Yeah... objectify? No, those women have more control than any man in that place. They are master manipulators of the male psyche, and the power of the female form trumps any supposed power ever bought or implied. I was surprised the first time I came here at how non-sexual the event was for me. It was almost like an ecstasy experience - sensual and raw, everyone together, experiencing this thing you can't quiet describe, the act of being revealing something about your inner self to one another. The music pounds, and the lights flash. Everyone is happy. Your mind short circuits a bit, and you can't get rid of the permagrin. Everyone can appreciate the female body - everyone. \u00a0Add some fried chicken, and the best home-made chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted, and you have the Gold Club's Friday lunch buffet.

I don't get it, what's wrong with wanting to appreciate another pretty girl?!?!? Anyhow, I digress.   Two weeks ago, during our normal Friday night debauchery at a nearby club, I mention to my friends that I wanted to go to Gold's Club. It was no surprise that I got the usual, \"Are you serious?\" look but they agreed (alkie makes it so much easier).  On Friday, October 29, 2010, my friends and I (guys and girls) went to GC a little before midnight.   You have to excuse my knack for details as I walked into GC after 4 LC's and a beer, so I was a bit inebriated to say the least. \u00a0  COVER:  $10 for guys and girls.  DRINKS: I spent $10 on ONE beer! Seriously?!?!? Oh yah, the waitresses will swoop up you drinks before 1:45 AM, so you better chug your drinks by then.  STAFF: Professional and friendly for the most part. However, when my friend had her foot resting on the stage after \"Making it Rain\", the bouncer who told her to keep her feet off the stage was rude about it.  \"THE LADIES\": I was NOT impressed at all. I remember seeing about 5 or so dancers and most seemed stone cold and didn't really seem to have any interest in what they were doing. If you want people to \"Make it Rain\", at least FAKE IT!  The worst part is 4 of the 5 girls were NOT even remotely attractive and had absolutely NO T&amp;A. BOO!!!  CROWD: More upscale mixed crowd than your usual sleaze bags you see at the Strip Clubs on Broadway.   MUSIC: Hip-Hop, R&amp;B, and Pop.   AMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: GC is the classiest and cleanest multi-level Strip Club in SF. Like I said, I can't remember all the exact details, but I do remember the sexy dim lighting, plushy chairs, and dark purple d\u00e9cor and gold accents. There are two bars; one at the main floor and one in the VIP area upstairs.   My biggest gripe is we couldn't find the women's restroom. Every time we thought we found the restroom it was the men's restroom. Seeing how frustrated we were, one of the employees said we could use the men's restroom.   PARKING: Street parking can be difficult; however, it isn't hard to come by before 10 PM. They also offer valet parking.   I doubt I would ever return to GC again (not even for the $5 lunch buffet) b/c I can simply open my closet door and pull out my ironing board if I wanted to look at something flat. Sorry...",

For $5 you get entree to the darkened world of beautiful women in skimpy lingerie and 6\" platforms.  We've been enjoying our times here the last couple of months but lately a few things we've been noticing. A lot of the great dancers are disappearing! After talking to some of the gals there it seems that Friday is not the best day to work. Guys come and eat but don't tip to well or don't want to be bothered while they gnaw on their chicken (moist and tasty) and tacquitos. Are the dancers hiding out downstairs until they clear the buffet?  Another thing to watch out for. The daytime cocktail waitresses aren't very pleasant and will rip you off if your not paying attention. A classic example is they don't have change for your drink order. Now, this is an important part of cocktailing, taking drink orders, delivering the drink and carrying enough change to carry out simple transactions. Twice we have had a waitress say they will bring back the change then never come back. You then have to chase them down to get your change. Another example is you get a $3 Coke and they will try and offer you less than normal change - your distracted, there's loud music and your looking at some dancer on stage and they hope you just say 'yes'. You tip them another $2 and then realize a minute later that she just more than doubled the price of your \u00a0god-damned Coke!   I like to take care of those that serve me and specially those that serve me well, but that shit don't fly. New rule at the Gold Club in the daytime, go to the bar and get your drink. Besides you get to see more that way!   What's strange is that in the evening, the waitresses are generally real friendy, smiling and upbeat. I usually end up tipping them real well and buying them drinks.  Some of our favorite dancers on Friday's are Jezebel, Layla, Charlotte and Tara.  I want to give this place 4 or even 5 stars, great food, some real cool, hot dancers and even a great security team but the daytime cocktail service is a big downer.",

Yeah, its pretty much the best thing ever.  Not sure how the food would look in non-strip club lighting, but it tastes okay, and it is definitely $5 + titties good.  I cannot try harder to convince you to go here. Seriously, a group of us from work try and go every Friday.  It's also important to note that though the B team is definitely on stage for the lunch hour, there is sure to be some talented stripper to scurry up the 2 story pole and slide all around. You know you gotta go!",

You'd think it would be dead at noon on a Friday, but this place gets super crowded. The line for the buffet wraps around the whole first level.   Yeah, there were strippers too. They were a mixed bag - some were super enthusiastic and others lacked energy. Guess that's what you get for the lunch crowd, right?   P.S. Try the chocolate chip cookies. SO good!",

    "review_text": "Back in June of 2010, one of the first things I did upon arriving in the great city of San Francisco was attend my first Friday lunch at Gold Club. The sky was uncharacteristically blue, but once indoors, the black out curtains highlighted the promise of writhe women and fried chicken.  For $5, my new buddies and I devoured, piece by piece, the crispity moist breasts served with a side of spaghetti, hummus, steamed broccoli, chocolate chip cookies, churros, and the proverbial curry.   This last Friday, as I celebrated my bittersweet farewell from all my new friends, Gold Club was no different. The mishmash array of random edibles satisfied on all accounts, the women were naked, topless, and happy to grind and a cold lunchtime beer washed down some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. So when Ruggy asks me again what I'll miss most about SF, Fridays at Gold Club will top the list. And when Christina asks me what makes me cry, I'll probably say goodbyes.",

I sat at the stage first to get a feel for the place and check out the girls. Every where you look there is a awesome looking stripper. Now don't get me wrong they were not all 10s but there were enough 8s and 9s to make up for it. drinks I had were especially good... The waitress was fantastic... I had breakfast and ordered the steak and eggs, epic meal!  I plan on going back this weekend!",

Yes, $5 lunch buffet. \u00a0Technically, $5 cover and then FREE lunch buffet.  Yes, get the fried chicken. \u00a0It's really, really good. \u00a0I was trying to figure it out - I think they brine the chicken and then incorporate honey into the batter. \u00a0It's sweet, but the good way (like adding maple syrup to your chicken and waffles). \u00a0The other options at the buffet aren't terribly exciting, but the chicken is definitely worth more than $5.  There were a few particularly impressive pole dancers (/climbers/flippers/crazy stunts) but for the most part the girls were working for tips. \u00a0Which, you know, makes more sense for them but is less entertaining for me. \u00a0I'd rather see stunts on the pole than crawling around on the floor. \u00a0There was also a big difference between the \"lap dances are fun and I'm clearly enjoying myself and having a good time\" patrons and the \"I'm a regular who comes in on my lunch break and am keeping this a secret from my wife\" patrons. \u00a0The latter making me uncomfortable. \u00a0But that's the kind of stuff you have to expect from coming to a strip club for lunch!",

The Buffet: Fried Chicken is awesome, Salads are always quality, they usually have another meat option, last time I went it was Pollo Verde and it was fantastic. Don't skip their cookies, those are good too. Drinks not included.  Do your self a favor and go up stairs, you get a better view of the talent and are removed from it at the same time while eating.   All in all, this place is pretty legit, though not for the faint at heart.",

    "review_text": "I don't always take cabs around the city, but when I do, it's to make it on time to a $5 all you can eat lunch buffet at a strip club.  *FOOD* Expectations:  - All around mediocrity that hopefully won't give me food poisoning - The much raved about fried chicken is basically KFC in sexier ambiance covered in sexier looking grease  Reality:  - My tastebuds are pretty much racist against all fried foods because to me they all taste more or less the same. That said, I'm pretty sure Gold Club's fried chicken is coated in half batter and half unicorn magic. I got myself 3 FULL PLATES of just fried chicken wings and that's not just because I'm cheap and wanna load up on my $5 worth. - Speaking of getting my $5 worth, I easily did that with the first scoop of fruits. I mean, one sad ass cup of fruits in this costly hippies playground of SF is $5 (what the hell am I doing in this Dilbert's cube, I wanna be a fruit farmer) - Selection otherwise was small as expected, but everything was at least above frozen meal quality. There was some braised unknown meat next to the fried chicken that tasted pretty legit, along with the cookies. The churros would've been better if they weren't filled with some mysterious jizz tasting thing.  *SHOW* Expectations: - Something closer to a zoo  Reality: - Hot girls, a lot of 8s and there might've been a 10/10 ginger unicorn. - Every one of the girls could move like spiderman, half of them literally climbed like 20 ft up the pole and just chilled there like we were in zero gravity. I basically have zero chance trying out for a gig at this R-rated cirque du soleil so I just watched and ate my fried chicken.  *OTHER TIPS* - Any beverage (including water) you order to down the chicken and re-hydrate post-drools is an extra few bucks. Not a big deal since overall you still get much more than you pay for, or you can just be cheap and get a free drink afterwards from one of the million startups around the corner (what I did, at least I tipped on the meal) - Lunch buffet is every weekday from 11:30AM to 2PM. 1 hour of lunch and show is actually more than enough time to enjoy your break. And I probably didn't need to tell my cab driver I'm in a rush to get to a strip club by 1.  Gold Club has easily become one of my fave weekday lunch spots in the city. I will be that one fully-dressed chick regularly sitting off stage with two plates of fried chicken.  (Don't ask me if my name is Emily. My name is not Emily. I'm fully-dressed with two plates of fried chicken and no acrobatic moves.)",

I knew I didn't want to be in that scary kearny section again. So I came across this spot and we agreed this was the place to go to after din din.   \u00a0So came in style yet again and the door guy greets you by shaking your hand , that threw me off but not in a bad way. Nice looking men (staff) in suits at this place. The cashier in the front were blah but whatever. The host shook my hand too ,wow you guys are classy. \u00a0The waitresses were very nice and looked hot enough to dance as well. \u00a0   \u00a0 The lay out is pretty cool. Its a two story club, they have the main stage and two side stages, almost has this go-go club feel to it. Just like the Hustler club, they have a nice variety of ladies for all kinds of tastes. No thick girls but still healthy looking. You had a few real pole dancers that knew how to work the pole and very flexible. All the girls were friendly and didn't bug to death for dances. I don't like lapdances and whenever I said no they were still cool with it and still kept talking to us.    \u00a0 The drinks were made well. They also swoop up the drinks fast when it's last call. I really enjoyed this place and this will be a regular stop for me whenever im in San francisco!",

I can't review the bottle service or any of the above $20 dance services, but the stage area was just fine. Love the big leather chairs w/ swivel bottoms; very corner office. Chatty waitress brought drinks promptly (surprising on a Friday night). Only three girls did serious pole work (snaps to you ladies), but the floor action was enough for me.   The dancers are cute c-cups with dewy skin; not crazy athletic or full nude types. This suited me just fine, but you shouldn't come here expecting to see obviously fake breasts or magic city booties. Overall girls are on the skinny side, with a whole lotta leg (of course).",

    "review_text": "All I can say is wow, I'm impressed.   I've been here thus far on two occasions. The first was for a friend's birthday. It was a weekend and after bar hopping, we thought it would be entertaining to go to a stripclub. The cover fee was $20, which I thought was a bit steep, so it had better been a good show or I'd been quite bitter. Surprisingly, my stingy bottom was ultimately impressed. The girls were all so fit and acrobatic that even for a heterosexual female, the show was utterly entertaining. I was also impressed by the number of performers and variety between each girl, it seemed like there was a girl to cater to almost every taste. Needless to say, found a greater appreciation for strippers after this night.   Months later, a friend of mine came across the reviews for this club on Yelp. We were all amused that this club seemed to be famous for their afternoon show/buffet on weekdays. Also, it was only $5. I was almost speechless, this had to be too good to be true, so of course I went to check it out. After going on a Friday, which is known for their fried chicken lunch (which all the Yelpers are raving about), I became a believer. First of all, it was a full house, on a weekday afternoon, impressive. Second of all, the show was still of great quality, decently young women who were still impressively acrobatic. Third, the food was of pretty good standard. How is this possible. For $5, the buffet included a DIY salad bar, fresh cut fruit, a protein dish, fried chicken, a pasta dish, a side of garlic bread and a small selection of pastries. Since this club is located near the financial, I saw a handful of people coming for their lunch breaks. And I completely understand why. \u00a0Heck, I would have easily paid $5 alone for the fruit in the area. I guess I too have found my new lunch spot.",

You actually get a lot for $5 -food, cover, and boobies! Sorry fellaz, lap dances are sold separately. I know it may sound weird to eat and have strippers dancing it front of you. But really, its not that bad! I mean, at least they're not FULLY nude! Now that would totally make me lose my appetite! And plus, the strippers don't bother you when you're eating.  Speaking of food. For $5, its totally worth it! The only reason why I came here was to try their fried chicken. I heard they had good fried chicken and wanted to see for myself. I thought it was just okay. A little too crispy for me. Not enough meat and too much skin. Too bad they didn't have any hot sauce. Next time I'll bring my own. They also had steamed vegetables, hummus and pita breads, salad, pasta, steamed vegetables, this beef dish, fruit and dessert. OMFG, their brownies were delicious! That totally made my day! Despite ordering a Malibu pineapple for almost \u00a0$9.  As for the strippers...some of them were pretty cute. This is actually my second time going to a strip club. I thought the strippers here were much cuter and talented than the ones at Center Folds. Just sayin. Watch out for Keilani and Lily. They REALLY know how to work that pole!   Btw, my friend told me there was an attendant at the men's room. Be nice to him. He makes sure you don't smell like stripper when you go home. \u00a0I also have to mention their ladies room was also clean. The entire place seemed pretty clean. Being a germophobe, I kept waiting for someone to wipe down the pole. I only saw one stripper do it \u00a0(which was Keilani). Good job girlfriend! \u00a0haha.  Thanks Gold Club for waking me up from my 5 month Yelp slumber. I'll definitely be back when I have another Friday off. ;)",

I left my id and credit card in my drunken stupor and had to go back during the day shift on a weekday to pick it up! Oh yes, easy access to BART. There are many unoccupied ladies there during the day...even at 12pm there were like 15 chickies hanging out.  I was suprised to find: people really do order food there, the bathrooms are clean, there is a glass smokers room and they do make up creative names! Our cocktail waitresses name was Franny Pants, she was sweet. The 20 minutes I was there during the weekday trip titties were NOT bared on stage. Guess no one was contributing so she kept them under wraps.  Since this is my first experience at a club I don't have much to compare it to.

I heard good things about the buffet but didn't believe it at first. After eating here, my mind has changed. I didn't have high expectations coming in but left feeling good about my visit.  The buffet itself is free but there is a $5 cover charge to get into the club. When I went inside, I was actually surprised that it was not filthy and actually pretty clean. There's plenty of lounge chairs and some round tables so you can eat.  The food is delicious! There was salad, ham sandwiches, and desserts. However, like others have said, the chicken is where it's at. The skin isn't too fried and the chicken is not too salty. The meat itself is tender and not too chewy. Unlike other clubs, alcohol is served (at least during lunch hour)! The beers are priced at around $7 which is pretty pricey but expected.  The dancers were pretty impressive. They performed pole moves that actually look hard to do and would need some practice. It was entertaining and certainly brings a different experience to the usual dining experience.   My only negative is that our waitress demanded a tip. I didn't really wanna give her one but gave her $1 just to be nice.  All in all: Strippers + Great Chicken = 4 Stars!",

Why guys? Girls just wanna have fun! Even the Gold Club girls understood why we were there and they were all cool and mellow about it, why can't you guys?!   Yes, we were asked for \"private time\" several times by the Gold Club girls. But others understood that we were there just to have fun and started talking to us as \"one of us\". Yes, the girls are very nice and friendly. Not trashy at all! They have class.  The buffet, don't expect too much, but I assume most people who go to the Gold Club don't really go there for the food. I'm not saying it is not good, cause the food they serve is pretty tasty (I mean, it's free!), but the diversity of the food is very little (4 different kinds of dishes). But then again, it's free!  The drinks are really good ($4 during the entire day, until 7PM) with a good amount of alcohol in there (no, they are not cheap, just because it is happy hour!).  Honestly, I had my doubts before I went here, but it's really worth it and very classy! Girls (&amp; guys of course too!) just go here with a group of girls and have fun!

Creepy ass old shriveled up men should not be allowed to walk around this place thinking they can buy any female in the club, including those that do not work at the club and are there as paying customers. \u00a0It's also extremely bad form for one of the ladies that works here to be giving out the real name of a female customer to such creepy ass old men just to get a few extra bucks in her g-string. \u00a0The ladies use aliases for a reason so why would you think it's okay to give out someone else's real name when it's clear that the person requesting it has no business knowing what it is? \u00a0Thankfully the situation was resolved with a few choice words and didn't have to be escalated in the absence of any security to handle this creep.  Again, this was an isolated incident and I still have fun every time I come here and think it's the best gentlemen's club in the city. \u00a0I look forward to coming back to spend Friday afternoons with my friends drinking, eating at the buffet, and handing our money over to the ladies who provide some great entertainment.",

    "review_text": "I probably won't be back because it's so dark in here, and my pupils are incapable of adjusting fast enough, but the $5 Friday lunch buffet is a pretty good deal. The food is pretty mediocre, reminiscent of college cafeteria food, but no one should be complaining because... come on... it's a good deal. When I went, there was fried chicken, sausage pasta with fajita mix vegetables, salad with some sort of creamy dressing, chocolate chip cookies, various pre-cut fruits, and rice with something (but that something never actually appeared on the table). Yay for super processed and generic food en masse!   The women here are better looking than the strippers I've seen in North Beach, but they're pretty lazy and lack acrobatic prowess. There were only a few interesting acts. Most of the women simply walked around with a sense of awkward purposefulness, and it was clear that they were thinking too hard about their next move. There was no natural flow of movement, very little grace, and only a few impressive aerial feats. The crowd was surprisingly refined for a strip club. Most people were chatting amongst themselves and occasionally looking at the performers. I'm glad to say that there weren't any sleazy men trying to hit on any of the other patrons. ++",

First, this place is a bikini bar, not a strip club. The bottle service we got had really poor choices and everything was overpriced. The table we got with bottle service was just a regular table on the main floor.  The girls are so-so. Nothing too pretty. They also are all wearing bikinis and demand 400 dollars for a \"topless\" dance.  At the end of the night, I walked out and realized the smartphone I had taken out of my pocket was gone. The bouncers wouldn't let me go back in to get it and claimed they couldn't find it.  The phone was turned off right away so it can't be tracked so this seedy place is a mecca for smart phone thieves who know exactly what they're doing.

Fried chicken 2. The ladies  And that's in order of importance. \u00a0And seriously, what a STELLAR COMBINATION, right? \u00a0Buffet + strip show? \u00a0And we're not even in Vegas? That's right!  $5 cover on Fridays between 11:30am-2:00pm gets you a free lunch buffet. \u00a0And the beautiful girls, of course. \u00a0On the day I went, they had fried chicken, roast beef with some type of nasty horseradish sauce, a mixed greens salad, fruit (whole apples, and sliced up pineapple, strawberries, watermelon, melon), and cookies. \u00a0The food was just alright. \u00a0To my extreme horror, the fried chicken was not especially tasty - bland and boring! \u00a0My cookie was also burnt, but I liked it that way. \u00a0  We got to sit upstairs in the lounge area with tables, and the space was pretty comfortable. \u00a0We had a good view of the stage and the ladies. \u00a0For some reason though, I felt like the show was pretty tame. \u00a0I guess I was expecting fireworks or full nudity or something outrageous, but maybe because it was the middle of the day on a weekday, so maybe that's why the ladies and general vibe was a bit more mellow and toned down? \u00a0  But anyway, overall I thought it was pretty awesome that for $5, you can get unlimited food (albeit, the food's not that great) and a topless strip show. \u00a0The crowd was also pretty mixed, and we saw some groups of women there for lunch too. \u00a0  Heh, if you work downtown, it's definitely something different than your run-of-the-mill FiDi/SoMA/Downtown lunch spots. \u00a0And for that, it gets that extra 0.5 stars just for being differently awesome and awesomely different.",

But the ladies were good sports and fortunately I was surrounded by a gaggle of drunk male coworkers who were offering up bills in abundance and inevitably, covered my butt for my tipper negligence.  I love this place, it absolutely obliterated any previous impression of what strip clubs are like thanks to any/all made for TV movies featuring the \"seedy strip club\" and it's parade of scary ladies.  The Gold Club is not the image of some sticky floored, smoky, titty bar that Hollywood has burned into our (my) consciousness. Nay, it is powder smelling, ambient (yeah, I was there early-ish so it was still crowd free), cozy, clean and comfortable. \u00a0The dancers vary from the sleepy slow rollers on the verge of a yawn to the gymnasts who slink up the poll in the middle of the stage and shimmy down, showcasing their athletic prowess and outstanding sex appeal. The ladies are all attractive and I would imagine any male patron (and probably a lot of females as well) will find a young lady to their liking. I can't tell you how many times I turned to another woman sitting near me and said \"I really need to work out\" because the ladies here have sick bodies. Total inspiration to order P90X or cough up the cash for a gym membership. But I digress...The drinks are around $9ish but thankfully my male cohorts had me covered in that arena so who am I to complain? I understand that the food is good and the friday lunch is a great deal. And as a bonus, getting there early-ish got me in free.  No longer a virgin to the strip club scene, I have done my google searching on strip club etiquette and now feel totally prepared to tip like nobody's business.

    "review_text": "So, the last time I was in a strip club I was dragged by my straighty girlfriend/roommate to go see Heather Hunter pop it, bend it over, and slide all around it... at a janky Tenderloin place with Chewy Gomez (from the radio) introducing the ladies as I sat at a table in the back with my bag of to-go Indian food... Afterward, we went back stage and got a poloroid picture with Heather (which my roommate used as her Christmas card that year). who my roommate later called 'Wholesome.' She was quite sweet and engaging actually, but we were at a strip club, and though my experience in this venture has not been by any means vast, it seems pretty much a no brainier that a girl stripping for your money is going to be nice to you.  Now, how does this relate to the Gold Club, you're asking yourself? Well, if you've read this far, stick with me.  Fast-forward 10? years, and I'm sitting at my desk at work minding my own business, when my straighty female co-worker says to me, \"Hey, you have to come with me to the Gold Club for lunch and my gay friend Nathan's birthday.\" I say, sure, fine, cause I've heard there's an all you can eat friend chicken buffet for $5, which is sounding just about right for my budget AND I like gays!  After being carded and paying our $5, we enter the club. It's like walking into a set for a movie that takes place in a strip club. You've seen the movie, and now you can go there in person, but, in the center of the club is a group of about 20 gay guys, with a few lesbians and straighty girls peppered in, eating lunch and watching a chick work the stripper pole on stage. Every time the girl would perform some super human acrobatic feat, the group would erupt in applause and cat calls.  The buffet was great for $5. Let's be real, it's not Las Vegas or even Princess Cruises, but it's better than Lee's, and when was the last time you got out of Lee's for under $6.00? And Lee's certainly doesn't have an atmosphere that comes anywhere near the Gold Club's. So, the Gold Club is a WIN, and Lee's is NOT.  Now, the stripper pole.... I know, you've been waiting for this part and your patience is about to be rewarded. I give the stripper pole a good 5 stars all on it's own, This pole reaches up 2 full stories, and these girls are NOT afraid to climb it to the top.... And an extra star to the girl who came out and wiped the pole down before beginning her routine.... Know that your attention to detail was surely appreciated!  The only BOOOOOOO is the $3.00 ice tea I ordered that came in a small plastic cup and was mostly ice. Now, I don't mind that it cost me almost as much as the meal and admission, but don't go skimpy on me! I know you're trying to make up for the cheap meal, but it's ice tea. Giving me 3 times as much in an actual glass isn't going to effect your profit margin, believe me. But, I wasn't surprised so it's not enough for me to grade down for it.  I do wonder if it's a requirement that all the girls wear the clear see-thru-plastic platform pumps...   Now, don't be confused. There are some straight guys that come to the GC on a Friday for lunch and a few of the really awkward ones will straggle up to the stage and sit down staring googly eyed at the jiggling bits of the girls dancing on stage as they toss out dollar upon dollar. Of course you sit there and wonder how they don't see the true point of the place or appreciate the artistic nature of the girls' performances, but it makes the girls more money and they don't seem to mind so you can kind of forgive it. But it is a little weird to watch, truth be told.  Will I go back? Yes, but I hope it's full of gay men again hootin and hollerin for girls doing crazy acrobatic pole tricks!!",

Talk about a winning combination... spicy tuna rolls, quesadillas and hamburgers, coupled with upscale \"performance art\" and a full bar? Win, win, win!  The interior is very clean and leaves zero room for grimy vibrations. Nice lighting, friendly staff and an above-average array of Tuesday afternoon entertainers. When you roll through for lunch, cover is a fat goose egg... so you get a lot of bang-for-your-buck, so to speak.  I didn't have an opportunity to revisit the location after the sun went down, but I can imagine it only gets better from here. \u00a0Being that this fleshy display of greatness is a little on the steep side... it's not for everybody. I'm a firm believer in the anecdote, \"you get what you pay for,\" however, so I didn't mind shelling a few extra duckets for quality. If you're shopping for copper, I wouldn't recommend you blow your two-week paycheck at Gold Club. If you're looking to peel a dimer and have some expendable cash flow at your disposal, you've just hit the Emerald City.",

    "review_text": "Came in here for their $5 buffet. So I got here a little after 11:30am, paid the $5 cover and was seated next to the stage. The buffet was next to the bar. So as one eats the girls continue dancing on stage. The girls pretty much leave people alone until the buffet part is over. And the buffet really draws a lot of people. Each week they will have the fried chicken with other things, last time I was here was sliders with pasta.   After the buffet, like your typical strip joint, girls would walk around engaging in small conversation in hopes for a lap dance.  The buffet consisted of mainly desserts, humus with pita, celery sticks/ tomatos, smoked salmon, beef stroganoff, salad, steam vegetables and some fried chicken. The food is OK, what one would normally expect for a $5 meal. Drinks are not included, so my soda came out to be an additional $3 plus tips, Fiji water was $5 a bottle. \u00a0  The place itself kinds of smells, don't believe they ever clean their carpets. Smells kind of like an old hotel's lounge area. Other than that the place is fairly clean. With a man in the restroom helping one wash their hands. Even has 2 smoking rooms.   The Friday I went there were 16 different girls dancing. The girls were fairly fit and a couple very attractive. The only thing is the girls only take off their tops and no touching at all from the customers or the girls. And once the tops comes off, they don't come near you. Dances are $20 in the general seating area, 2 songs for $60 in a more private area and $120 for 3 songs in the private booths on the second floor. Then there is also the Sky Lounge which one could play whatever music one wants in a sound proof room for 30 minute rates.",

Minuses:  *Getting major attitude from an Asian cashier at the front desk when asking for the address/cross-street. \u00a0She was definately not hot enough to be so nasty. \u00a0And not in the right area code for the pronounced lip-liner-only-look. *Hey, if we girls need to pay the same cover charge as guys, how come we don't get candies and cigarettes and a towel guy in our bathroom? \u00a0Maybe because we don't fund the lap dances. \u00a0Maybe we would if we got candies and cigarettes? *Happy Hour specials are limited to a specific list of drinks. \u00a0We got dinged on this because we assumed it was all drinks. \u00a0Get your drinks from the bar like a fellow Yelper recommends.  Special Notes:  *Ladies, the bathroom is very clean and smells nice. \u00a0Both mirrored doors to the left and right are bathroom stalls. *Don't drink drinks that make you go to the bathroom a lot and miss a hot leg hug on your friend. \u00a0(Maybe next time JL x 2) *Getting there at 8pm allows for plenty of street parking, but you risk having to sit through the kind of shitty dancers for a couple of hours.  Go! \u00a0Enjoy! \u00a0I highly recommend!",

    "review_text": "A woman, a gay man, and two straight guys walk into a strip club... No, it's no the beginning of a raunchy joke... it was the beginning of my Friday night.  I'm not your typical guy when it comes to strip clubs. \u00a0I actually hate them \u00a0(Despite that statement, I'm one of the straight guys BTW). I think they are pointless, silly and a big waist of money (and self esteem). \u00a0But, when the rest of the group wanted to go to the Gold Club because the bar we were planning on going to sucked, I had to go along with the group. \u00a0I begrudgingly paid my $20 entrance fee and ordered my first of two overly priced watered down drinks.  We were greeted by the standard wave of scantily clad women at the door, smiling in a way that makes you feel as if you actually have a shot with one of them... Girls of course who are only working in such a place to put themselves through law school. \u00a0While these girls were your typical mixture of woman, a type for a variety of tastes, I was quite surprised to see the quality of girl on stage.  I don't really want to get into a review of the women working here because i feel like it would be far too demeaning and chauvinistic. \u00a0I will say that \u00a0I remember feeling bad for one girl who was on stage and all the men in the front row got up in the middle of her act and left, not having thrown down or stuffed a single dollar into her sparkly g-string. \u00a0I almost wanted to toss some money onto the stage to make her feel a little better, but I didn't.  It was at this point when one of our group (the other straight guy) decided it was time for a lap dance. \u00a0Not for himself, but rather for the one person who had been eying one of the barely dressed women harder than all of us... the one person in our group who could not shut up about wanting a lap dance from this particular dancer who had caught her eye... that's right, her eye... the woman in our group (lets call her \"Rachel\") \u00a0had been talking about getting a lap dance all night. \u00a0  Rachel could not have been more happy when the dancer finally made her way to our table. \u00a0She quickly sat on Rachel's lap waiting for the next song to begin; Rachel was giddy with joy. \u00a0During the performance Rachel could barely contain herself as her hands roamed freely across the landscape of the dancers body (something typically not allowed for the male patrons). \u00a0I'm sure the song ended far to soon for Rachel, who at this point was probably wishing for the extended version of Free Bird rather than a trimmed down version of Bawitdaba. \u00a0The dancer got up, smiled at us all and did her best to get a new customer at the table. \u00a0But we didn't want to demean what her and Rachel had just shared together, so we declined.  Soon after Rachel's dance we decided it was time to leave. \u00a0All in all we were only there for about a half hour. \u00a0I would normally say I didn't get my money's worth... \u00a0but seeing the joy that we were able to bring to \"Rachel\" seemed to make it all worth while. \u00a0If strip clubs are your thing, then I'm sure you would enjoy The Gold Club. \u00a0But for me, I don't think I'll be back.",

That blew me a way; how cool is the idea of boobs and chicken wings? I had a few opportunities to meet a few of the strippers outside the club and engage them in conversation - really nice and entertaining ladies. I discussed things with my wife as they went along and asked if she would be interested in joining me for an evening to check out the club. She was cool (cause she is straight awesome), and away we went. I reserved dinner for us on a Friday night and it was on!   First thing is that when I say \"reserved dinner\", I mean it! They seated us and broke out a table cloth and handed menus with a lot of GREAT meals. Very high class cool stuff. The wife and I greatly enjoyed our meals (and our adult beverages) while watching women writhe on stage. Something I would have never imagined could be so fun! The women in gold club are fantastic to look at, watch dance, and talk to! They will sit with you and talk and not just hustle for a dance and leave. Tons of fun! They also don't seem to be afraid of a woman being with you; in fact they make it a point to offer a dance for the wife each time. No problem for me! Such a phenomenal time; the wife also had a great time that she probably never imagined! I am so proud to be married to such an amazing woman - and thanks to her I got to have \u00a0(and may continue to get to have) a wonderful time in a wild environment that appeals to my ADD best!!    \u00a0Do yourself a favor.

I just got back from their famous $5 buffet (hello, BUFFET?) and it was pretty awesome. I had never been to a strip club before (I'm 24 - what a loser) so it was a double whammy. Food, boobs.. and bootie.  The buffet was better than Hometown, but still pretty average. The bucket of ranch kind of looked suspicious, so I didn't prepare a salad.  But Fridays here are the greatest psychology lesson and just REALLY fun. It was probably the greatest lunch hour I had. The pole work was impressive, my favorite part however is when the strippers make their platforms click.  It puts a little POP in my day. Fierce, bitch... fierce!   BTW, greatest quote of the night... set up is I went here with another fellow gay and our mutual fag hag.  Gays love the boobs, however anything else is pretty terrifying  The stripper is doing some sort yoga-like position on the floor. Her legs looked like the entrance to the \"Moulin Rouge.\" She started squirming across the floor... I turn to our fag hag, \"Is that what a girl looks like when she is doing the deed?\"  She gives me a weird look, \"Uh, yeah? I think so? OH WAIT, you guys wouldn't know - would you?\"  We all let out a chuckle. Maybe you just had to be there.",
