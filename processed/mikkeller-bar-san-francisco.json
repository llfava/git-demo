Their food menu is small and largely consists of wheat based items and sausage. I didn't end up eating here but stopped by for a couple of drinks. As far as booze goes, you have 42 choices of beer and a few wine varieties to choose from. I actually tried their cab...don't make fun...I wasn't feeling the beer. It wasn't very good but that's my mistake!  You don't come to a place known for their beer and order wine. Shame on me.   If you're a fan of craft beer than you'll love it here.",

However, after managing to pick a few (delicious) specialty beers from their extensive (draft) menu, I think it may warrant many more visits anyway.   I had a few, so I'll admit my memory doesn't completely serve, but I had a particularly delicious Black IPA called Space Invader; I highly recommend. I also tried one of their wild yeast beers, and it was a flowery explosion of how beer should taste.   HIGHLY friendly bar tenders, surprisingly attentive service for the large crowd, yet plenty of space to accommodate it. Another first-time note that always informs the response is the bathroom situation. After drinking a few beers, (depending upon your bladder capacity), your highest hope is a lineless bathroom. Especially as a human of the lady-persuasion, this hope cannot be more desired. Despite the thick crowd, the bathroom was BARREN. Hells yes. There are multiple stalls and multiple sinks, and cleanliness was not left wanting.   Upon my next visit I'll be sure to check out the food situation. My thinking is that any place with excellent beer that also offers food must also have excellent food.",

If I start raving about the beer here, I won't be able to stop, so let's just say they have a veritable bible of a beer menu. Required reading, fa sho.  But don't think that beer is the only reason to visit Mikkeller. They have a solid food menu that pairs nicely with beer, too. Food came in big portions, relatively quickly, and the kitchen was flexible with requested modifications. Loved the prison-style metal trays. The bratwurst was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and thick. They give you a HEAP of fries, which make for good beer-munchies food. Another party next to us had the sausage platter, which looked phenomenal. I was pretty envious. The banh mi sandwich was surprisingly traditional with the style of bread and toppings, with the exception of the char-siu-style tofu. The tofu was bit on the sweet side, a bit crispily charred, and surprisingly meaty tasting.  The bartenders are friendly. The d\u00e9cor is nothing adventurous, but it's still cozy and charming, with dim orangey lights, lots of wooden furniture, metal piping, and paintings that make me think of the Earl of Lemongrab from Adventure Time. The high roof makes it feel quite open.  Will have to return for the sour room downstairs and sausage platter.",

The force behind Mikkeller fought the tide and their risk was rewarded with a full house of thirsty beer lovers in one of the worst hoods of SF (which isn't saying much these days.) Been a few times now. Most recently the menu was a tad unbalanced on the hoppy and pumpkiny side. 5 IPAs, 3 PA, 1 APA, and 3 pumpkin or fruit beers.  What about some old fashioned English bitter? Or something a tad more malty? I mean I've been quaffing hoppy brews since '92, and how the tide on buttery Chardonnays suddenly changed, I'm predicting a crash in hops soon as well. I'll welcome that. In the meantime, Mikkeller, please offer one session beer. Please.  As for the food, the sausages were outstanding btw, even a tad better than the famous Rosamunde on lower Haight I dare say. The PEI mussels left much to desire though, I would steer clear of those scrawny guys for the time being. Hope to return soon.",

At the time, I had mostly enjoyed my dinner. We started with an order of fries and lil' smokies, as well as a couple of beers. Yum! We then shared the kale caesar salad with anchovies (pretty good) and an order of their ribs. The moment I put the rib to my mouth I noticed the overwhelming smoky odor. Not unusual for such an odor to be present, but the smell was so strong it took my breath away. I went through with eating it; however, it was chewy and tasteless (minus the smoky flavor). Fast forward to 3:00 a.m. and I am praying at the porcelain altar revisiting that same smoky taste. Remarkably, it was even stronger the second time around!

Would have loved to check the place out but the front of house staff member denied my boyfriend and I entry because as non-American tourists (we're from Australia) we apparently needed to show our passports and not our drivers licences. This is the only place we've encountered in San Francisco and the USA to have such a ridiculous requirement.   Based on a brief google sesh, it appears that CA law requires ID checks to ensure a person has a bona fide form of identification. Last I checked, non-US drivers licences are pretty damn bona fide (so long as they are legit and valid!) US domestic airlines accept our licences at the security gates!  Train your staff, or stop hiring d-bags to work your front door. Or if the whole passport requirement is unique to your venue, tourists beware, this joint won't be worth it unless you intend to wonder the streets with your passport.   Luckily after trotting out of the joint annoyed and amazed, we wondered over to the Press Club a few streets away. The Press Club is a swanky wine bar that also serves a great selection of craft beer. We had a lovely time splashing our tourist dollars there instead.

To make myself sound pretentious: I went to the original Mikkeller in Copenhagen over the summer and the bartenders there were excited to say that Mikkeller Bar was going to be opening in SF, they were even wearing the shirts. They then asked me if the Tenderloin was a nice neighborhood. I explained the current state of affairs and they explained that the original Mikkeller had a similar location.  But alas, it is totally worth going to Mikkeller even if you are a bit concerned about the location. I have not been hassled in the surrounding areas at any of the times I have gone, ranging from a 3 o'clock late lunch to a 10:30PM night out.  The bar upstairs fills up pretty quickly, but you can put your name in with the hostess and wait for a table if you desire. There are TONS of fantastic beers on tap, all served at specific temperatures thanks to their nifty tap system. They focus primarily on the Scandinavian beers but have a lot of US and other countries' craft offerings as well.  The secret gem is the sour room downstairs. They have two special taps only available in that room. The sour beers will require some taste retraining for some, but they are a great change of pace from the current IPA, Hop Heavy offerings of most craft establishments.  But that's just the beginning, Mikkeller's food is actually awesome too! Bacon wrapped cocktail hotdogs (weiners typed just sounds so creepy) deep fried, smoked sausages, pastrami sandwiches all offerings that pair perfectly with the assortment of beer.  I have taken tons of friends here and even took my mom to the sour room. No one has been disappointed. I highly recommend checking it out!",

The beer is good. \u00a0My gripe with this place is with the management in SF, not the staff. \u00a0Maybe its because this is a high volume establishment on the edge of the tenderloin? \u00a0Maybe its because the general manager was having a bad night? \u00a0Accidents happen and so do beer spills. \u00a0While handing my friends their beers, I accidentally spilled my own. \u00a0After helping clean it up, I noticed no one was around behind the bar. \u00a0Usually one would expect a replacement beer poured without reservation. \u00a0Instead, I received attitude from the general manager and a flat out refusal for a replacement beer with logic along the lines of \"Why should I absorb that? That will cost us another beer.\" \u00a0Well, I'm thinking - it will cost you a lot more than that: my business, my friends business, my recommendation, and possibly anyone reading this review too. \u00a0If that's the type of attitude that management wants to teach their employees, I have other places I can go. \u00a0Forget this place and the manager's bad attitude.",

And, \u00a0I mean, how can you NOT love a place that lists their brews by what temperature its served. How very European! I didn't ned up ordering what I thought. I had visions of a frosty Mikkeller Orange Yuzu Glad I Said Porter (Grand Marnier). But having downed several whiskey/rye cocktails earlier in the evening, I decided to try the Jolly Pumpkin Bi\u00e8re De Mars. It has a sour bite that makes it go great with sausage. Since sausage was on my brain, that part of my plan worked our perfectly. I really loved the fries (uber crisp) and my bratwurst (juicy!). But my dining pleasure was thrown completely off track by my dessert. The taste was good, but the texture was just off. I was tired that night, so it may just be me being cranky, but I'm pretty sure it was only listed It as a chocolate creme brulee. When I went on line later, the menu said cookies and creme (although the description sounds like the cookies will be on the side). Cookie crumbs folded into the creme might explain the grainy texture I encountered. Might. I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites, and believe me, I do NOT skip dessert. Bad dessert roughly translate to 1.5 stars missing. One more star is gone because of a reserved table. Again, I was tired, so maybe I am just being cranky. I have no problem with reserved tables. I've reserved a few in my time for sure. I just find it suspect that a group of the staff took over the one in question. For some reason that annoys me to no end. My friend and I found a seat elsewhere, and truth be told, it was too big a spot for us, but I can't help but think it might have been better off used for paying customers. And yes, it colud have been a special occasion, or it could have been a work perk, or any number of things that make that perfectly legit. I just happened to be tire and a bit cranky.If you add that up, this is really more of a 2.5 rating. And, depending on if I had been at a less tired/cranky moment, it might even be more if a 3.5. that said, please fix the dessert if you haven't already. You can't mess with dessert. I'm not sauting through the Tenderloin again for bad chocolate.",

During my vacation back to my hometown of Brooklyn, I visited Torst. Which was cool, but Mikkeller IMO is a better space, more easier to get to and I preferred it over the two. Pretty funny for me because I like beers of Evil Twin better!  + Great food. I thought this was top notch. + Pretty awesome beer menu. Unique guest taps, lots of representation and served at right temp. + Environment is optimal IMO. Large bar area, spacious and a variety of different types of seating. + I thought pricing was apt. Neither insanely high or low.  This is probably the best proper modern bar I've visited in SF.

I arrived here and looked at the beer menu, and instantly felt like an amateur. I hadn't heard of ANY of the beers on the menu. The bartender recognized my look, patiently asked about what beers I do like, and proceeded to describe different beers he thought I might like. The beers I chose, with the help of the bartender, and later a waiter, were all really delicious. I'm no connoisseur, but I know what tastes good.  Another thing I liked was the honesty of the servers. They wouldn't flat out tell you a beerwasn't good, but sometimes they helped guide me away from beers that I might not like as much.  It is a bit pricey, and the beers came in strange different sizes, making it hard to figure out how much you have had, and it did attract a yuppie crowd- but that sort of stuff is pretty par for the course in places like these.

    "review_text": "Great new bar in downtown SF.  The Good:  - \u00a0I really like how the bar is organized. Lots of seating. And there a good places to stand as well. I really like the back wall with the ledge. It's a bit quieter back there so you can have a conversation.  - Service has been decent in my experience. At times it has been slow, but multiple times when a bartender sees I've been waiting to order, they would acknowledge me and say they'd be right with me, which they were.  - Pretty good food, especially for a bar, but not as good as Monk's Kettle.  - Nice modern atmosphere. I really like the brick walls and the extremely weird pantings.  - Pretty spacious, so it's good for groups.  The Bad:  - The Korean wings tasted decent, but were pretty small.  - Beers can be pretty pricey. Average ~$10 for 250ml.  - They often run out of beers. Every night I've gone (even non-busy days) they'd run out of a few beers. But at least they have a relatively large selection.  Summary: Cool bar in a good location (it's right by Little Delhi!) but it's no Monk's Kettle.",

    "review_text": "*In spirit of Oktoberfest*  If you remotely love/like beer at the same level as I do, then you must step foot into this place. \u00a0This place is incredibly serious about their brews. \u00a0May have Danish roots cuz the place has a very Euro industrial feel, metal railings, dim lighting, no windows and communal bench seating. \u00a0The menu even list the beer pours in metric. \u00a0What the hell am I getting into with a 25cl pour?! \u00a0  I also know how serious they are when their Beer menu categorizes their beers according to what temperature it is going to be served. \u00a0This is unheard of in most American bars. \u00a040 degrees for light brews such as Pilsners and American Lagers. \u00a045 degrees for Pales, IPAs and some Belgians. \u00a055 degrees (cellar temp)for most darks like Stouts and Porters and also Barley Wines. \u00a0  And the breweries that they offer can vary across the board from a Berliner Weiss brewed in Quebec, to Cellar Maker Brewery across the street here in SF. \u00a0Don't come here already drunk or the menu will read like a chemistry text book. \u00a0Also utilize this place for flavor education as opposed to buzz development, even though the buzz is inevitable if you spend time and/or money here.  I sipped off several glasses here, from fruit beers to dark stouts, all wonderfully legit. \u00a0But my stand out was a Brewfist Imperial Stout that was aged in Grappa barrels. \u00a0At $12 it was 8.7% alc served in a full wine-like glass 25cl. \u00a0It was an intense massage on the palate with deep roast, wine-y fruit and layered bitterness. \u00a0I can still taste this.  Food wise, the menu is quite small but very beer compatible. \u00a0Mostly small plates and sandwiches but everything is made in house and very craft worthy. \u00a0Makes the beer sipping that much more fun.  S &amp; P Fries $6 \u00a0Hand cut fries fried crisp (almost too crisp) but so good with the brews. \u00a0The malt vinegar mayo was a great twist. \u00a0Never understood dipping fries in mayo, but always loved vinegar doused fish n chips. \u00a0This worked big time! \u00a0Made me forget about the Heinz. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mikkeller-bar-san-francisco?select=IjAbyIvcgQQuR2C8tV_PDg#IjAbyIvcgQQuR2C8tV_PDg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mikk\u2026</a>  Salt Cod Cakes $12 \u00a0Nice proper texture but the filling remained quite salty. \u00a0I know it is \"salt\" cod, but that is the trick. \u00a0You have to pull some of the salt away to get a nice experience. \u00a0I'd skip this next time.  Sausage Sampler $45 \u00a0A monster aluminum cookie tray is generously laid out with 5 of their current sausages along with the paired condiment for each sausage. \u00a0This is important as each condiment rounds out the sausage experience. \u00a0For example an Apple Slaw for the Chicken-Fennel Sausage is great. \u00a0So is the classic pairing of sauerkraut with a traditional Bratwurst. \u00a0One I enjoyed was their take on a Muffaletta where they take a Mortadella Dog and pair it with an Olive Salad and Provolone. \u00a0And don't be timid on mixing different condiments with different sausages, you may find a surprise combo. \u00a0Rye toast rounds out the platter. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mikkeller-bar-san-francisco?select=dC1pxCvjT77q-Z70QdUqjw#dC1pxCvjT77q-Z70QdUqjw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mikk\u2026</a>  Don't really care to hang out in this part of SF (union square area), but I most definitely would brave it for this beer joint. \u00a0I am just that serious about my brews. \u00a0Cheers!",

    "review_text": "Beer, oh how I love thee, let me count the ways...  I've been hearing good things about this place ever since it opened on the very edge of the Tenderloin (my least favorite part of SF) and I finally got to check it out recently on two separate occasions.  Close to BART and other public transportation so there is no need for driving and trying to find parking and after a few beers from Mikkeller, you'll need to take public transportation anyway.  Come here on a weekend and finding an open spot at the bar or at a table may be a challenge. Come here during the week on a holiday Monday and you'll have no problem finding a spot. I got to experience both and of course, I preferred the night where I could walk right up to the bar and order a beer.  The staff knows their beer so feel free to ask them any questions about the beer on the menu. Beers are categorized by the temperature they are served at and are ever changing. Mikkeller uses a \"flux capacitor\" gas blending system - one of only a handful in the world - allowing them precise control over each and every beer making sure it's served at the proper temperature. Fancy! Speaking of fancy, expect to pay some \"fancy\" prices for your beer depending on what you order and unfortunately, as far as I know, they don't have a happy hour here to save you a few bucks  Hungry? They have food here at this here gastropub. That's where the gastro of gastropub comes in. I haven't tried much off of their menu except for their bacon wrapped mini hot dogs, which were quite tasty. They do have burgers and other gastropub items which I'm sure are quite tasty, but I'm mainly here for the beer and I will most certainly be back for more.",

Like any gastropub the place is loud so you'll be yelling dinner talk. Also, the prices are more than I'd prefer for beer and food, albeit really good beers.

    "review_text": "Ahhh...I didn't know this bar has its roots in Copenhagen. Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen. Love that city. Ever since Danny Kaye played Hans Christian Andersen and sang about the ugly duckling to the little bald boy who grew up to become Moby. OK I made up the Moby part, but I do recall the beer being quite tasty in Copenhagen. And the food, too. That's what Mikkeller does right by Danish standards - balance the quality of the beer selection with that of the food menu, which is definitely better than your average bar bites or at least the bites I recall when I was sober. I came solo one evening knowing that I'd be elbow-to-elbow at the bar.  It didn't turn out to be too bad as a couple of young, increasingly drunk Germans were downing shots in pints to the left of me and a young couple was to the right too enamored with each other to notice my presence. The place was fairly packed, which appears to be its normal state, and the three bartenders were kept busy. The beer selection is overwhelming (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FX7yROp&amp;s=ee33edec3602121ac3902fbfa341ea1f048944760a7c6f0ee8e89e1bcb21b932\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/X7yROp</a>), so I randomly chose the $7 Table Mountain Double Burgundy Farmhouse Ale with Black Currants (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1rz7dTN&amp;s=977815cfa764a1b59db2f13bb3e5065d4e2a4adb9dd18dad8e4ebb49b51d09e3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1rz7dTN</a>). Lucky pick. It was delicious like a fruity stout. To go with it, I ordered the $14 Loukanika, a foot-long Greek sausage of pork and lamb topped with cucumber, mint and a dollop of caraway yogurt (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1nPESuw&amp;s=e1330164ba614beccabaef633ef163460e84931872d2b4c426a692e5faeceaee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1nPESuw</a>).  Quite tasty with a nice oompah flavor. It came with a bag of heavily seasoned fries that seemed to encourage excessive beer drinking (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FX7yHGR&amp;s=5d309b9c685b0e8aa3c0b828d12b6a8671ec51ac0700cde5bd0035b48c65692b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/X7yHGR</a>). It worked. In fact, I was still feeling peckish, so I ordered the $11 Millionaire's Salad, quite a yummy plate combining hearts of palm, butter lettuce, avocado, mango and hazelnuts into something really delightful (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1mXfsoz&amp;s=31c4faf89b1b3e0162ec2550da06cad6b06a7feacda94772241d1fd89d8aa618\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1mXfsoz</a>). And of course, I needed another beer to wash it all down, this time a $9 Jolly Pumpkin Oro de Calabaza, an oak-aged golden ale that hit the spot (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1qIb3xU&amp;s=2b39663f15bb1ae10c583549abcab79a1aea9452fcf9e62c41440dbe164da5a4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1qIb3xU</a>). Meanwhile, patrons came and went as I held court on my bar stool. I'm sure I felt just like that little bald boy in Copenhagen when I came in, but I left feeling like I could sing a chorus of \"Wonderful, wonderful Mikkeller!\"  FOOD/BEER - 4 stars...better pub fare than you would expect with the millionaire's salad a winner...food and beer are well matched AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...Danish modern but pretty crowded...be prepared to dive right in SERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty decent once you get their attention TOTAL - 4 stars...if you are hesitant about bars like I am, you may want to check this one out on an empty stomach",

BEER SELECTION. Impressive, not your typical SF beer menu that consists solely of every brewery within a 25 mile radius. I'm all for local brews, but it's nice to see something different! We did ask the bartender for recommendations, and I think I get a little snobby when they recommend easy, popular brews - I want to try something new and different, man! Mini-rant aside, they're well stocked here.  HALF SMOKE SAUSAGE. Stuffed with smoked beef and pork, and covered in chili, onion, and mustard - definitely the favorite of the night, not too sloppy but tons of flavor, good if you have an appetite!  MUFFULETTA. A mortadella dog topped with provolone, olives, and salame - very pretty, not too heavy, on the lighter side of the menu, but still good.  Prices aren't low, but you're in the heart of SF, you'd be hard-pressed to find a deal. Definitely worth checking out for HH or even for a quick bite if you're in the area.",

There's also a \"sour room\" that I don't believe is open yet down the stairs, where they will eventually feature a bunch of sours that will be sure to tickle your palate if you're into that kind of thing (I'm not, but Boyfriend is waiting with bated breath for it).  Overall, the bartenders are really nice and the vibe is pretty relaxed. There's a nice mix of business people grabbing a drink after work and tourists because of its location off Powell, but everyone for the most part just seems to be enjoying a brew.

The ambiance is great - with high ceilings and enough space, it doesn't feel cramped, too dark, or too loud. They have a wide selection of beers on tap with interesting and unique flavors, at reasonable prices. The food tends to be priced on the above average side, especially for the quantity of food that you're getting. Typical gastropub prices; it's not terribly overpriced but the drinks are certainly a better value for your dollar than the food is.  I got a saison beer and the AleSmith Nut Brown Ale (English Brown Ale) and they were both really delicious.  For food, my friend and I decided to order two of the sausages and split them. They are a great combo with the beer, and fries or salad are included. At $14 a pop, they are certainly not cheap; in comparison, Rosamunde's are usually $6-7, but without topping and without the side.  Texas Ranger ($14) - All-beef, fried onion &amp; jalape\u00f1o and chipotle ranch. If you like spicy foods, you'll like this one. \u00a0The fried onion &amp; jalape\u00f1o definitely give it a nice crunch and a kick. The sausage was good, but a little on the dry side and it could have been much bigger. (Not sure how to word all of this part of my review so it doesn't sound dirty, but get your mind out of the gutter ;)) It was just barely wider than a Slim Jim.  Half Smoke ($14) - Smoked Beef &amp; Pork, Chili, Onion, Mustard. This was juicy and had a good smokey flavor. I liked the addition of the chili. It was not over-complicated with too many toppings, and you could really just enjoy the taste of the meat.  I'd definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area - it's a bit tucked away on Mason but really close to Union Square and the Powell St. BART. I think it's one of the better food / drink establishments in the area as far as bars are concerned, and really easy to get to via public transit. I'll be back for more delicious beer and food!",

    "review_text": "Man i've been wanting to hit this place since I heard it had opened last year. Huge fans of Mikkeller - their beer, artwork and style are second to none in my humble opinion. We finally found ourselves in SF for mine and my wife's 12 year anniversary - super hyped!  Located just off Market on Mason Street (outskirts of the Tenderloin), you would almost walk right past it if it weren't for the lit up Mikkeller sign on the side of the building. Very unassuming from the outside, but once you step inside you are greeted by a rustic yet refined look and feel to the joint. The back wall left alone in all brick, the clean and simple European minimalist design, and walls adorned with Keith Shore artwork let you know that you are definitely at a Mikkeller bar.   Their draft system is clean, efficient and gorgeous stainless steel placed perfectly within a quad bartop that is powered by the Flux Capacitor draft system that keeps each beer style at its proper serving temperature - meaning your BA Imperial Stouts aren't served as cold as your IPA's, your Wild Ales served at proper temps to bring out the ultimate amount of funk and unique characteristics, and to assure that your Pilsner is served cold and crisp to pair perfectly with a sausage sandwich and crispy double fried french fries. Genius!  Quite an eclectic crowd - my wife and I heavily tattoo'd and casually dressed seated right next to business men in suits and ties and women dressed up for a night on the town in nice dresses and heals - it all works out quite well somehow. There is open bar seating and reserved seating as well, which can be a bit tricky - where there was open seating (first come first serve) our first night in, the next night it was reserve seating. I think this is a little confusing for the guests, but we were able to get seated within our first drink both nights.   We were fortunate enough to get a full tour of the inner-workings of the bar by Cellar Master Ford, who showed us the renowned Flux Capacitor system, where they cellar the kegs on deck, their cask system, and answered any questions we had with enthusiasm and a smile on his face. I tried my best not to geek out too hard! We also had tremendous service from our beer server Natalia, who not only had knowledge of all the beers being served, but knew about the cheeses we paired with our beers as well (names, origins, and types of cheeses) - as most know, you often get a blank stare when asking your server what cheese are in front of you when they are brought to the table.  Mikkel was in town for a dinner/beer pairing in the Tivoli Sour Room (reserved for special events - located downstairs) so to honor his visit, the bar had 42 taps of all Mikkeller beer on tap. It was beyond amazing. Beers I never thought I would try on tap were literally at my fingertips. 7 Spontan varieties, 5 Beer Geek varieties, Black Tokyo Horizon, just to name a few. I was blown away!  Overall we had extremely high hopes and left the bar far from disappointed. In fact we had a better experience than we could have imagined. Special thanks to Cellar Master Ford, and one of the finest beer servers in the business (and i've been in this industry for nearly 20 years) Natalia. The two of you along with the rest of the staff are top notch and have a true passion for good beer and proper hospitality. We can't wait to visit again.  Cheers!",

Beer and wine only, with an extensive beer selection, and limited wine choices. Service was slow but friendly. I think they were short staffed and busy. I ordered the bratwurst, which was a generous portion, but unfortunately contained pieces of cartilage. My friend said her chicken breast dish was bland, but worked since she was having her stomach issues. We shared the cherry &amp; chocolate bread pudding which tasted decent but lacked in both the major ingredients in most of my bites.  My bill was over $50 with tax and tip, which seems a bit much for a mediocre food and dining experience. It would be nice if they included happy hour.

We sat at a hightop and with others sitting on either side of us and it was almost impossible to have an audible conversation. No worries though, we were both too busy stuffing our faces the majority of the time anyways.   The salt cod cakes demonstrated why they deserved a spot on that aforementioned list. While they brought back very fond memories of eating fishsticks as a kid, they were certainly more sophisticated. I could've had multiple orders but then there was mac n cheese... While it's true it's hard to mess up mac n cheese, this was especially good. On top of that, we had the S&amp;P fries (as you can see, we were pretty concerned with our waistlines this particular evening). With these three dishes, we were full and satisfied.   Of course, the beer here was great. I had never seen a beer menu divided by temperature and went with what I was comfortable with, the Mikkeller Tenderloin Wit.

My story starts with a vacation to the Bay Area and a special date night in San Francisco with my man. We checked into our hotel around 3PM and we were so hungry--too hungry to wait for dinner. My guy wanted something gastro-pub-ish so I busted out my trusty Yelp app and searched for one around us. Well, as always, Yelp knows what's up, especially in SF. Don't question. It pointed us to Mikkeller Bar, which is very unassuming from the outside--so much so that we almost missed it.   Anyways, it wasn't busy since it was a weird time of day and week to be there. I liked it! No TVs to be seen, just a peaceful vibe. We ordered a ton of food, including the cheese and meat board, the fries, olives and the bacon-wrapped mini hot dogs. We also ordered one of their two red wine selections, which was delicious, but way overpriced--almost like you're being punished for not drinking the beer. Anyways, the FOOD! I have zero complaints. The fries were all kinds of perfect. And you can't go wrong with bacon wrapped mini hot dogs. The cheese and meat board was great because we got to select what we wanted, that way we knew we'd love everything. But I loved their little mini-pickles! And the warm olives were great, although I think the ones I make at home are better.   Overall I really enjoyed the food. Mikkeller Bar reminded me of a few gastropubs out in Cleveland, but way, way more expensive. Hence the lack of the 5th star. The wine was way too overpriced, even for SF. The rest of the selections were good and the price hike made sense... I mean, you are in San Francisco. But it was a delicious experience overall and Yelp pulled through for us in a big way with Mikkeller!",

It wasn't the most comfortable of seating but we were happy to take anything. Their selection of beer on tap is quite large (nearly 50 kinds) and they have them all classified and serve them at their optimal drinking temperature. This is all part of their custom \"on the fly\" gas blending system that ensures that their beer is served at the correct temperatures for you to enjoy all the flavors you would normally miss from a standard tapped pour. Honestly, I couldn't discern the difference. In addition they also have a wide and eclectic menu with options like spicy giardiniera, muffuletta sausage sandwich, and sour cherries and sweet chocolate bread pudding. I personally loved the soundtrack: 1990's hip-hop. Between the food, the drinks, and the atmosphere, it's easy to see why Mikkeller Bar is a popular place.",

I'd done plenty of that the night before, stupid W Hotel! *grumble grumble*)  We wanted some beer (ahem, hair of the dog) and a bite to eat. I opted for the red ale with the eggplant parmesan sandwich and a side of fries. He went for the brown ale, the beef dip sandwich, and a side of salad. The winner? My eggplant parm with his salad. Both beers were delicious. Service was incredibly friendly, and prices were about on par with typical gastropubs.

Regardless, I enjoyed this place enough, but I'm not positive my visit could really warrant more than three stars. To begin, we were a little exhausted to say the least, coming to the end of our trip and wanting to squeeze in some time with friends that had moved to San Fran. We were a little confused when, on the way here, we went through the most unsavory area that we saw during the entire trip. But, that trip was worth it when we were met with the cavernous interior decorated with the signature Mikkeller artwork that I immediately warmed up to. Having only one beer here, though, doesn't really give me a good idea of the place. It was a good beer, but that's all I can really say. Our server was also pretty \"meh\" and didn't seem to REALLY enjoy our banter. The rest of the patrons here didn't seem to be having the most fun either.   Maybe it was just an off day, but I wasn't thrilled. I'm sure we'll keep Mikkeller in mind when we're in town again, but I can't guarantee I'll jump at the opportunity to come back.",

You might just breeze past this place sandwiched near the corner of a busy intersection and a live music venue but you'd be missing a gem. Walk in and you're greeted with an industrial style, open space with its own heaping portion of red brick and steal I-beams. The focal point is the U shaped bar at the center and where your attention should be when you sit down. A craft brew specialist, Mikkeller Bar has a plethora of Californian micros on tap and they know their beer. All served at the proper temps and in the proper glassware, you know you're in for an experience as soon as you've ordered your first beer.   Also billed as a gastropub, Mikkeller Bar doesn't disappoint with food either. A small but tasty menu awaits you and your tastebuds. I had the roasted chicken breast and I can tell you that I've rarely had chicken this good and so well prepared. Both juicy, tender and delicious, the crisped skin is the perfect pair to the breast meat. Although a small portion by normal US standards, it's just right. Paired with a maque choux, mild red chile sauce and grits it really hit the spot. \u00a0If I had one critique it would be that the grits were slightly runny for my taste but for a restaurant so removed from the grit bastion of the south central United States, I was impressed.   I certainly see this place being a big hang out spot on Fridays after work and a great place to bring a group if people for good food and good beer.

I once managed a beer bar, and let me tell you, Mikkeller is something special, and I was salivating at the idea of going to a bar dedicated to their brews. I had high expectations, but even then was impressed with their beer list. It's not organized by style so much as it is by the temperature served. It might not be the easiest for a novice to navigate, but it's proof they know their shiz. I was very happy with my selections.  Food, however? Not so much. I think we might have had false expectations of this place being more of a restaurant than it actually is. I had a reuben with fries. The reuben was pretty burnt yet my fries were cold. I could have sent it back, but didn't. I can't knock them off a star when I was being a silent sufferer.

That's normally what you pay for a glass of Beer in SF, but hardly any places carry the wide selection that Mikkeler does. Not to mention that Mikkeler brews their own beer as well. So for the price, it's a great deal.   Mikkeler's Bar is, imo, a hidden gem in Union Square. Not toursity at all. I like that they also have an accompanying restaurant, which I would like to try at some point. My friend and I sat at the Bar which practically glistened with handles of beers on draft. Just take a seat and order! The staff is very knowledgable when I asked for a few suggestions to start off.   My beer was tasty and the cheese/charcuterie platter was pretty good. Our server tried to find a good cheese/meat pairing for the beer. Overall, very impressed!  I can't wait to come here for a beer tasting at some point!",

Ambiance was perfect. \u00a0Cool and modern, and a bit industrial while still friendly, without being over-the-top nor for this 58 year old beer and small plates food lover. \u00a0  One of the best things about the place was Kerri, our server. \u00a0Very knowledgable about everything on the menu...she went to great lengths to make sure she brought us beers that matched our less-than-clear descriptions of what we liked. \u00a0Kerri is awesome.

But since it was technically the first day of my vacation, I knew my only option was to get back on that horse. Wanting something easy-drinking, I opted for a bottled blackberry cider, which was pretty fantastic. It was served a bit warmer than I would have preferred but I like to drink everything ice cold. I didn't get the impression from our stoic server that requesting a glass of ice would go over well.   The menu featured sausages pretty prominently so I ordered the half smoke, a beef and pork link topped with mustard, onion and chili. It was every bit as delightful as it sounds. The cup of fries that came with was a generous portion of perfectly fried and salted spuds.   Those on the prowl for a beer-loving gent will certainly find more than a few at Mikkeller. During a semi-busy Friday afternoon lunch, there were exactly two women in the whole place, myself included. Also, the tunes were on point.

A friend and I stumbled in here one rainy evening after reading the EaterSF article about the top new joints in the city. Even though we already ate at AQ beforehand, we thought we'd come and have some drinks.  When I go to places like this, I always try and make sure I drink the beer made by that establishment. The first drink I ordered was a Mikkeller Double Eye PA... 14% ABV! That was a lot stronger than I anticipated, but definitely loved the flavoring of it. I'm also a sucker for IPAs.  Next drink I got when I came here with a coworker was their Beer Geek Brunch Weasel stout. Something I would definitely order again.  Next, our bartender said that if we liked stout-y drinks, he had a recommendation for us... The Gudel\u00f8s, which he said the literal translation meant \"without God\" (and $1 from every bottle sold of this beer goes to the Athiest society of Denmark or so... I can't remember specifically!). I wanted to try the beer but did not support where the $1 was going... :P This stout beer definitely went down very smoothly! I wouldn't order it regularly (one bottle cost maybe $20ish?), but it's worth trying.  Also, if you're into very hipster San Francisco locales, you'll love this place. Everyone was pretty friendly though, and they all looked like start-up workers.  I definitely want to come by sometime to try the sausages!",

The layout seems pretty nice, with a fair number of separate as well as communal tables, and some space up front (where you can't get food food but can get almonds, pickled vegetables, and of course beer).   The beer was fantastic, it almost goes without saying. I was really impressed with how organized they were right from the get-go, with plenty of very friendly servers everywhere. The only opening-day kink that we experienced was that one person's bratwurst got lost in the shuffle - which was more than compensated for by a plate of pickled vegetables (I especially liked the tomatoes and cauliflower - the mushrooms were not as much of a hit to me, but still interesting) and smoked marcona almonds (these were pretty divisive - I found them too salty and almost bacon-y for my taste). I liked all the sausages - we also tried a roast pork sandwich with cheese on it. Both were very tasty, but a little greasy - as my companion remarked, there's a reason pork sandwiches don't normally have cheese. I would have liked the fish/potato cakes to be more potato, less fish, but the sauce that came with them was good.  All in all, I look forward to going back to this very-conveniently located bar!",

    "review_text": "Mikkeller Bar is located in a very \"colorful\" part of San Francisco. By \"colorful\", I mean you can probably find the entire spectrum of poop and all colors of the unicorn piss on the nearby sidewalks.  \"Uhhh, where are you taking me?\" asks Mr. NSS. \"You said you were hungry weren't you?\", I replied.  \"Yah but I want to keep my bunghole an exit not an entry\", he said. \"Don't worry, I have protection\", I replied.   Once you get past the seedy streets, you will find a yipster oasis at Mikkeller Bar. It's surprisingly spacious with rich dark woods and exposed brick walls. Seating is first come, first serve. By 5 pm on a Wednesday all the seats were taken at the booths, communal table, and at the bar so come early!  Beer lovers will rejoice with the extensive beer menu. Hardcore drinks will *sigh* because there's no hard liquor offered. And, there's only two wine options, one white and one red.   What brought me here were their Salt Cod Cakes which was on the 7x7's Big Eats List. If fish isn't your thing, they have an array of sausages but they come at a hefty price tag of $14 each! Yah, everything is expensive here. Also, on the menu are small bites (peanuts, olives, fries), charcuterie, mac &amp; cheese, sandwiches and entrees (mussels, chicken).  The Salty Cod Cakes ($12) were delicately crispy on the outside and moist on the inside: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1xT8FDY&amp;s=d595dee75e06cc3c3f78e9d4f2f0b0950dbc5df7b538a468abeb0a844ccd9ab0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1xT8FDY</a>. It's reminded me of crab cakes but more potent and saltier (not too salty). The dill, parsley, and lemon remoulade was delightfully creamy with just the right amount of citrus to cut through the richness. The salty cod cakes were good but not life-changing as 7x7 would make it out to be. Then again, that list is nothing but a marketing ploy IMO.   We also ordered the S &amp; P Fries ($6) which were served with a malt vinegar mayo and ketchup. Like solid fries should be, they were hot and crunchy throughout. The malt vinegar mayo was a standout and made this snack addicting.   I ordered the only white wine they had which was a chardonnay for $10/glass. It was ok; refreshingly crisp to pair with the gastropub fare. I wish they had more wine options because not everyone is a beer drinker.  Service was hipster fine; friendly but not overly so. We promptly received our food and drinks so no complaints.   Mikkeller Bar is not a place I would come running back to because I'm not a beer drinker and the area is sketch especially at night. Then again, that's why I always carry protection: my barbie pink stun gun. Like boss.",

The pickled veggies, frites, and half smoke were delicious!   Service took a while at first but they were pretty busy so I'll forgive that the initial drink order took a while.   Nice open bar area with tables in the front that seat 4-6 people. Crowd is definitely hipster/techie. Lots of flannel/plaid, beards, and \"I (heart) TL\" hoodies.

People usually stay here for a while because they have an assortment of beers. You might have to hover to get a spot.

We ordered the BRATWURST and the SAUCISSON A L'AIL. I am personally a fan of the latter because the dog was topped with caramelized onions. The fries were bomb but could be better with truffle fries.  This is a great place to go with a small group of friends since it gets packed on the weekdays.

This is THE place to sample and savor flavors.  The on-draft selection is massive and the bottled selection even more-so. Both are constantly changing so I find it worthwhile to ask the staff about what's new. Speaking of the staff, they always make me feel welcome and are always willing to talk beer, give me suggestions, and bring samples for you to taste.   The last thing to note about the beer, which is something I've only encountered here, is that the on-draft selection is grouped into 'temperature' categories based on what temperature the kegs are kept at. Since this is a place to explore beer flavors this is perfect - keeping beer too cold hides the flavors. It's a small thing, but it shows that these guys really are passionate about their craft.  The atmosphere is designed for conversations - no TVs anywhere in the building! I've seen it a little too busy for my taste on a Friday night, but only barely (compared to what 'busy' means in most SF bars it's practically intimate).  They do also have some great food; everything I have had has been fantastic. Of special note is the Macaroni and Cheese with Bacon which has thick square chunks of bacon - unbelievably great. Overall, it's high quality heavy gastro-pub-grub which is appropriate given the reason you are here is to enjoy it with some (potentially heavy) beers.",

Tables had already pretty much filled up, so get there early if you have a party. I was able to snag the front section, and I put my name down on the host's iPad and he said I'd get a text when the table was ready. Awesome.  While you wait, you have complete access to order food and drinks, so it doesn't really matter where you sit. I ordered the evil twin low life pilsner, as recommended by the waitress. It was good. I also ordered the nuts (very smoky), sheep's milk cheese, and a stuffed pork/beef sausage. The food was mediocre. I wouldn't say it was the most amazing thing in the world. And why was my \"stuffed\" sausage look like a skinny hotdog? Not fulfilling at all, and it was $14. I could have purchased a larger hotdog outside for $1. Sad. The nuts get boring after a while... after all that smoky flavor, you have to wash that taste out of your mouth after a while.  I will say the wait staff is awesome, and there's an endless list of beers on tap to choose from, ranging from $6-8. Most people come here for the beer anyway, the food options are a plus if you're starving like I was. I was allowed to sit down with myself as I waited for my sister, which was another plus.  I would come back here again -- the vibe is good and they have a variety of tables and barstools to choose from.",

Beers are served improperly -- everything in the same small (.25L) chablis glasses. 3. They don't post the beers where you can see what is offered; you have to seek out a hard-to-find beer menu. 4. Rather than seat or serve you, the wait staff directs a newcomer to the back wall behind the bar, where other patrons give conflicting advice on how to actually secure a glass of beer. Additional attributes which don't bother me, but might bother some: 5. Location -- in the T-lion, not Union Square. 6.

Unfortunately, what I had envisioned this establishment to be like vs. what it actually is like, were two very different mental images.   The design both in front and behind the bar is chic and minimalist, if you can imagine what I mean by that. \u00a0I appreciated that aspect of it. \u00a0The bar was also much more spacious than I was expecting. \u00a0Not exactly a selling point for me.  The clientele, a mix of self important hipsters and loud bougy 30-somethings, really ruined the experience for me.  There were a number of beers on tap, however, my first pick was already kicked.  Any who knows Mikkeller should know that you won't find their beer in a store for under $5/ bottle, therefore don't expect to pay less than almost double that for most of the brews on tap. \u00a0Price doesn't factor into my rating at all.  Also, this bar unfortunately borders the Tenderloin neighborhood. \u00a0Please refer back to my Hilton Union Square review for a LMGTFY link in case you are not familiar with the Tenderloin.

This place, however, seems to be a very good place for a social get together to have a couple of beers. It seems very trendy is in the tenderloin and not a great part of it.

That first time was when they were still in soft opening, and a friend made me check it out on the basis of one rumor. He drove up from San Carlos, he was so excited.  Interior is beautiful and selection has been amazing every time. Pricy, for sure, but when I get the chance to try crazy shit like elderflower sour beers I am flat up in heaven. Actually, whenever there's a tap list that changes daily and has any sort of solid selection of funky and sour beers I'm in heaven. But this place goes above and beyond.  Food is good and bartenders are super friendly. I've had their cheese platter and while I generally shy away from complimentary almonds (for this specific plate) they were smoked and seriously the bomb. I hate nuts, but I loved these.  Only con: location. Bouncers at door and there's never an issue directly in front but I've been made a little uncomfortable walking back and forth to my car.  tl;dr: Absolutely worth the visit, but be wary of the location and expect beer to be on the pricier side.

None of that mattered. The beers up in here are absolutely stupid pristine. I tasted five varietals (yes, they deserve the same verbiage as wine) and sipped two pints, the experience was beyond enlightening. Oh Jaysus, the cask ales simply soak in the goodness. I could literally taste the whiskey and port in the barreled pours; the imperial stouts were a little too powerful for my overwhelmed palate, but incredible nonetheless; in their totality, the pours werre nuanced, artisinal and absolutely crunk. So are the dope slingers who pour 'em. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable and understandably patient, which is so important for an ol' boy from the boonies who couldn't decide what to order in the first place.  Gastropub appropriate?

The menu is limited but the food is above average for a place like this. Nothing amazing but good quality and well prepared. I little expensive for what it is but this is downtown SF after all.   I went to Mikkeller last Saturday with a group of friends. We'd all been there several times before. We all liked the place, that's why we keep going back. This review has to do with the service we received.   The place was packed. We squeezed into a tiny space at the bar. We were finally able to order beers. The friend who was closest to the bar was handing each of us the beer we ordered as they were placed on the bar. As he reached for his, the fifth and final beer he inadvertently knocked it over. He immediately got the attention of bus staff and even helped them to wipe up the mess. He then asked an employee behind the bar if he could get another beer. To which he was told no by a gentleman who identified himself as the general manager. When we asked for his name we were told Bob Demoise. Bob said \"you paid for a beer, I served you a beer\" When my friend politely pressed the issue he said \"if I pour you another, I'm out a beer.\" All five of us were floored. First of all, \u00a0unless his last name is Mikkeller he's not out anything. Second of all, it's common practice in the restaurant business to replace a spilled drink.  So yes, the general manager saved his employer a six dollar beer (which probably cost them $2). He also lost 5 regular customers who will never be back. Figuring that each of us spends 40-50 everytime we go, that $6 beer just cost Mikkeller bar thousands of dollars over the next few years. Penny wise, pound foolish.  I own a retail business. I can't tell you how many times I've replaced something for a customer that they broke or damaged. I didn't have to, but I knew if I didn't, I'd risk losing their future business. Hundreds of dollars later is worth much more than $10 today. I guess being in SF and having tons of tourists as customers you can treat them like crap, they'll never be back anyways.

They've got wine -- 2 reds and 2 whites, a super decent food menu, and a tres chic ambiance with lots of room for groups and solo drinkers at the bar. So, next time the boyfriend suggests Mikkeller, I won't put up a fight. At all.  Obviously, they've got a bunch of classy beers with Mikkeller's own brews highlighted. The Lambicus single-yeast wild ale was incredible! Not too heavy, bitter, or sour. Just lovely.   For food, I had the organic chicken two ways (breast &amp; braised thigh) with cheesy grits and chili jus. Perfect beer-pairing meal for $16. We also ordered some sausages ($14), which looked pretty epic. And the fries...ideal. Thick &amp; belgian style with ketchup &amp; aioli. Yep, aioli is now a standard accoutrement in SF.   Service was smooth, though prices are a little steep for a beer bar. But! For this neighborhood, it's worth paying a little extra for the classy, spacious digs and quality sips, I think.",

It's at the edge of the Tenderloin, so you go straight from sketchy to wood and metal European-style awesomeness.   The beer is delicious, and every style imaginable is on tap. The cookie plate was meh on its own, but I couldn't pass up the chance to have Milk Stout and cookies. They have sours on tap now, but I'll definitely be back when the sour room is finished.   Note for the ladies -- Mikkeller has arguably the best bar bathroom in SF. Spacious and nice. I have to give them the fifth star for being straight classy, makes me want to blindfold out-of-town visitors and deposit them directly in the bar.",

    "review_text": "Mikkeller Bar is a yuppie's beer-and-small-plates dream, and that's probably why it was very crowded on a Friday night. The interior is hipster chic and features high ceilings and exposed brick, so don't be thrown off by the Tenderloin location.  There is open bar seating both on the ground floor and the basement; the downstairs bar is a bit hidden, but keep walking past the bathrooms and you'll find a quieter, bright room. They told us it was an hour wait for a 3-person table, but our table was ready in 20 minutes. It was not much of a table, more like awkward seats hovered around a knee-high metal block, but it got the job done.  We had the Prince Edward Island Mussels ($12) and the Sriracha Chicken Wings (~$13). The pickled onions and chorizo with the mussels were tasty, but the actual mussels themselves were quite small. The chicken wings were spicy, but I wouldn't necessarily say they emphasized the unique Sriracha flavor.  I'm not a beer person, but my friends' beer (recommended by the waiter) was very interesting and had an aftertaste that was reminiscent of popcorn. Cider here is very overpriced (bottled, yet each is ~$12), so I wouldn't recommend it. Bring your casually pretentious, craft-beer-loving friends to Mikkeller, and they will be impressed!",

The SFism of the bar is very apparent here as it's a totally different place and vibe. Speaking of the latter Im sure because it was opening night, it was packed to the gills. Luckily we didnt have to deal with any line since we went and had dinner first. Ran into a bunch of folks I've seen before. Ex servers at Atelier Crenn/Trappist, one of the Trappist Co owners, and some folks from Saison. It was a crazy mix of food industry, hipsters and beer lovers all around. The bar and food seating were packed all night so we missed getting any food. Walking up to the central bar the staff were pretty sharp and got my order right away. Spontanale, Mikkeller Tripel, and the Lil' Mikkeller is what we had. Having just come back from Belgium and Copenhagen recently, it was a good reminder of what I just left. The selection is excellent and there are many things to try including the food. Looking forward to it mellowing out a bit after a while before I go back though. Still an excellent debut. Certainly anticipating all the brews to come.",

When I first discovered (or, 'was led') to Mikkeller, the word hadn't gotten out. They'd recently opened and seats were plentiful. Not so much anymore. The good thing is that the wait is not so long as to drive you mad but if you'd been here before, say, last September and you're just now returning, you're going to be in for a surprise. People have spread the word and the people who are here are thirsty... which is good because there's plenty of good beer.  The taps run the gamut from light to dark and the staff is knowledgeable about what's good for every particular taste. I've enjoyed wild ales, brown ales, Goops (not related to Her Boniness), as well as all the typical tastes (served in the proper glassware) one would expect. If you don't find what you're looking for on tap (sad trombone) opt for a bottle selection. It's just as vast. But, there's more! Food. While I would never suggest coming to Mikkeller for dinner, eating while you're here's not a bad idea. To compliment your beer, look into the cheese plate (decently imaginative selection with accompaniments) or the pork sausage made with garlic &amp; caramelized onions, served with fries and salad. The price is right. It tastes good and the selections pair very nicely with whatever beer is curing what ALES ya.* But, if you're just in the mood to sit in a dark (not so quiet anymore) bar, drink excellent beer, talk to a good friend, or just be one with your thoughts, you (and the rest of SF) will want to come here to do so.  *I'm a regular comedian.",

We went to Mikkeller Bar for a 4:00 drink and ended up having to run to the Ferry Building for a 6:00 engagement. We completely lost track of time in this wonderful bar.  Mikkeller has a gorgeous space, with light wood and brick and cool whimsical art on the walls. It's large with several tables and a central bar, with counter seats facing a formidable line of forty-two taps. We sat front and center at the main bar, and service was great.  The beer selection is tremendous, featuring a wide range of Mikkeller's own beers, as well as interesting beers from around the world. It was my first time at Mikkeller's, so I stuck with their brand for my two rounds. I had the Tenderloin IPA and the Beer Geek Brunch Weasel. Both were outstanding. The IPA was top notch, substantial and hoppy, and the Beer Geek Brunch Weasel was a delicious, rich imperial oatmeal stout brewed with civet cat coffee (that super expensive coffee that comes out of a cat's ass). Jon had the Bavik Petrus Aged Pale Ale and the De Struise Cuv\u00e9e Delphine, which were both unique and tasty. The Petrus was a sour, which isn't really my thing, but it was great for a sip. The Cuv\u00e9e Delphine was firmly up my alley, a full-bodied stout brewed in a bourbon barrel. All our beers came with perfect heads of foam. Either the taps are special or the bartenders particularly artful.  We munched on some meat and cheese to avoid getting too drunk, and this was a nice snack. We had prosciutto, pork rillettes, and Valdeon blue cheese, and all were fantastic. The platter came with toast, almonds, mustard, cornichons, and like a sweet/spicy fruit chutney. Meat and cheese portions weren't particularly big, but there was plenty to munch on and it was all good.  Mikkeller's has a full food menu, and I'd love to come back to eat and drink. I could've stayed at this place all night. The beer and atmosphere were just perfect.",

Mikkellar Bar prepares to celebrate its one year anniversary on Saturday, Aug. 9. Here are a few reasons why you should visit:  LIL' SMOKIES ($13): bite size pieces of hot dog wrapped in bacon, mild Chipotle BBQ sauce on the side. Simple appetizer, done right. Excess oil had been drained off, each bite was hot but not scalding hot as to singe my lips. Great bar food.  ST. BERNARDUS PRIOR 8 ($9): long one of my favorite Belgium ale's, it was served oddly enough in a wine glass. Not sure what that's about, but it was served appropriately at cellar temperature.  DE STRUISE BOUWERS BLACK ALBERT ($13): One of the best Belgian beers available right now. At 13% ABV, it's also meant to be enjoyed at a leisurely pace. Once again, the bartender served the beer appropriately at cellar temp.  The bartenders were cool and, as noted in the correct serving temps of both my beverages, know their beers well.   Final tips:  -There are a handful of gluten-free beers available, as listed on the parchment looking menu -Check out the Draft List- Several local brews available, many unique to Mikkellar -Lunch special daily from 12-4 pm: Beer &amp; Brat for $12.",

Sour cherry bread pudding - out of this world; only dessert on the menu but owner's wife is a pastry chef so it is no joke.   8 beers between the 2 of us and these yummy foods for right over $100, great deal. good food, good service, nice understated industrial beer garden decor.

Everything was awesome - obviously amazing beer selection, really great decor and atmosphere, and clearly a popular place already.   Unfortunately my friends and I are probably never going to come back after how rudely the unprofessional hostess treated our group. The four of us waited at the front podium for about 5 minutes for the hostess, since clearly it was a busy night and we wanted to get a table and order food. After she didn't appear, we wandered inside, where a waitress confirmed for us that we should wait by the podium. The hostess had by then returned and was talking to a group of 3 who had just come in. After taking their name down, she took ours. I informed her politely that we had arrived before the group of 3, which the waitress we spoke with confirmed to her. She just stared at me and sort of nodded. I asked what we should do in the meantime and she said to find a seat in the back and that she would come get us when a table opened up.  Unfortunately that never happened. The group of 3 was seated directly next to us in the back, and after coming and flirting with them repeatedly, the hostess took them to a table after about 40 minutes of waiting. She never once looked at us or acknowledged our presence, or the fact that we had been waiting longer. We waited in vain for another 20 minutes before giving up and leaving.  I totally get that this place is new and probably working out some kinks. I'd recommend they hire a more professional hostess as a part of that process. Till then, we're definitely not coming back.",

    "review_text": "I stumbled upon this place while looking for somewhere not too touristy to eat in downtown San Francisco. It's a beer spot that serves food that goes well with beer (like sausages). The atmosphere is wooden with dim lights.  I ordered the milk stout in a bottle because a lot of people were talking about it on Yelp. I don't know why that let me ignore my rule of always getting something on draught when it's there. Draught is always preferable to me because it's more rare--a bottle can be more ubiquitous since it's a easy-to-ship-bottle. Anyway, I thought that this packaged beer was alright. Maybe it was because it was served slightly warmer than I think it should have been. It's like when you put in a bottle in a refrigerator for about 30 minutes and the outside of the container is cold but the core of the item is not yet.  The sausage I got was tasty. The fries were more memorable. The prices are decent. I wouldn't mind trying this place out again if I'm looking for a beer/food refuge in downtown SF.",

You know there is a pre-requisite to being a cool-as-sh#t bartender: (1) must have a grizzly bear beard (2) must have hipster swagger (the bigger the beard, the hipper the swag)  We had a beerilicious time! Don't know what beer to try? Tell them what you'd like to eat and they can pair one for you. \u00a0  The food menu is equally superb...we snacked on a few items while playing a game of scrabble, chatting up the bartop neighbors and air-strumming along to a most excellent music playlist featuring the likes of everything in between Nirvana to ALT-J (you will want to check out the latter if you're not already familiar-you're welcome ;)  Here's a rundown of our choices: ++++ spicy giardiniera...they pickle everything in house and it is tart and tasty, not so much spicy, but the thin slices of garlic and serrano peppers tangoed on my tongue. +++++lil smokies...these were cut pieces of an all-beef hot dog, big enough for a slice of bacon's width to wrap around twice and then dropped in an oily bath...you'll never want an undressed hot dog again for.the.rest.of.your.life. +++the salty cod cakes...these mimicked crab cakes nestled in a small pool of remoulade dressing. These were my least favorite, a bit on the salty side, but when eaten with the giardiniera: \u00a0mmmmmm!   I had a couple of really great beers. I highly recommend the raspberry triplebock, but hey, what do I really know about choosing beers? Still working on that pre-requisite and having a hard time growing my hipster BEERd :D",

I probably did yell it because it's loud in Mikkeller...and I had 3 of these.  Only downside is that they will totes close on you even if their business is booming. They had a few tables of people and four or five people at the bar and shut down promptly at midnight.

As a few others in my group have mentioned, the food wasn't thrilling. I had one of the brats which was pretty decent but, I ended up ordering myself into a carbohydrate overload. \"Let's get some pretzels to share...\" we're drinking beer right? \"Oh and a bratwurst too...\" turns out brats are accompanied by a giant roll and a side of fries. \"What should we wash this all down with...\" obviously ridiculous amounts of beer. Just something to think about if you're grabbing a bit while you're there. Plus you can skip the giant pretzels as they're hard and pretty dry.  Overall, you're here for the beer and that's where your focus should be.

But at $7.50 a pop and 7.7% alcohol for 35cl. Not so bad if you ask me. I also ordered the chicken wings as I love chicken wings. The korean ones were better than the spicy ones just because of the crunch. Oh and going back to the beer, the coconut was just a mild aftertaste.

The lighting is warm, the exposed brick makes my heart pitter-patter, and the BEER -- always a great, rotating selection with a few fantastic SF-only Mikkeller brews. They hold special events with some frequency, like sour fests (speaking of which, check out their bottle selection, especially the sours!), dinners with beer pairings, tap takeovers, and that annual Zwanze Day celebration courtesy of Cantillon.   Don't know what to get? No problem. The bartenders have been, without fail, friendly, approachable, and great with suggestions. They'll pour you a taste so you can be sure you like it before ordering. Hungry? The food's pricy, but their fries and reuben are delicious if you're ever too lazy to leave the bar and venture outside. Looking for friends? Well, the crowd here tends to keep to their own groups, so I kinda prefer The Trappist in Oakland for a cozier, homier, more neighborhood-like feel, but I've also met some interesting folks visiting SF from out of town.  (And I really don't get the complaint about women not pouring beer. What? How many times have you been here? There are multiple female bartenders, although I think more of the bar-backs are male?)",

There seems to be plenty of space to sit, both at the square bar counter in the middle of the space if you are alone and at the cool wooden tables if you are with a group.   From where did all the friendly servers who staff this place come from? Seriously- best bartending I have encountered in a very long time.   The beers, of course, are top-notch. It can be rather overwhelming to choose where to start, but you at least know that you will be drinking down something delicious. The most impressive beer I have tried there so far was a smoked sour! Stunning! Apparently, there is a sour room downstairs. Must go back for further investigation! The menu choices are also selected to pair very well with the vast assortment of beers available- things like bratwurst, pork chops, sandwiches, and the like are on the menu.  To note: reservations are not taken for tables. The acoustics of the space keep the noise level down, so it is a very great thing to actually be able to hear your friends' conversation!

Mikkeller Bar is a modern looking, immaculate, and spacious pub with dark polished wood. Even their bathrooms (located down a flight of stairs) are immaculate and spacious too! I easily got talked into a mid-day beer to go with my cod cakes. Opted for a low alcohol beer (4.7% ABV) since I was headed back to work and got the Magnolia Kalifornia Kolsh -light, crisp with a clear golden color. The salt cod cakes were perfectly crispy on the outside with tender and flavorful fish inside. My neighbor kindly shared some of his S&amp;P fries which were a perfect compliment to my beer and cod cakes. Yummy!   This is a great discovery in the TL - definitely try this place the next time you are near Union Square :)",

Instead, we went in and were \"greeted\" by a waiter tapping his watch and telling us that the kitchen was closing soon. The service didn't get any friendlier and the food was mediocre - I think they tried to get too fancy with the ingredients on what is essentially basic bar fare.

As for the beers I had a few and my problem is price. It is hard for me to enjoy something if I think I've paid too much for it. Pay attention to the size of the servings here. There are 25cc, 33cc, and 50. 50 would be a standard beer at most bars. So, for $7-$8 it's not cheap but for SF not terrible. However... when you order a $9 beer and it's half the size ... that's a problem. Even a strong beer is 1/2 the alcohol of a spirit so you are paying A LOT. You can say it's from a cave in Iceland or an island monastery but in the end it's just a good beer. Give it a try and bring $50 for beers but it won't be a go to spot unless you are a serious beer connoisseur.  Also, this isn't Europe. So when you give a guy a little glass of beer that's not cool either. So, all in all it's good new place but it could add a less expensive option so that the people who get dragged in there by beer snobs can get their 5 Trummerl Pils for $5.50 each and relax.",

Eight months later, we finally made it!  The space is very cool--dark wood paneling, chrome taps &amp; hardware, &amp; a sort of T-shaped bar that provides more spots for bar stools (plus additional tables &amp; chairs in the open space away from the bar). Service was great, &amp; the bartenders were able to answer all of our questions about the various brews &amp; offer suggestions that were spot-on.  I was quite happy with the beer selection. I feel like SF beer menus are often overrun with IPAs, &amp; this one had 42 taps with plenty of variety (plus a bottle list), ranging from more approachable beers to slightly more interesting / funky ones. I appreciated that they were divided up into serving temperature lists because it seems to roughly correlate with ABV, &amp; I was looking to stick with lighter ones that day.  The one down side that my bf &amp; friends mentioned was that when they came the first time, the place was absolutely packed &amp; so loud you could barely hear the person next to you even if you were basically standing on top of them. For that reason we went early (about 5:30) since it was a Saturday &amp; were able to easily snag seats at the bar. However, as the night went on, the place actually seemed to empty out a bit rather than fill up, so we were able to enjoy pleasant conversation all evening without yelling. Not sure if that was an exception, but I hope not!  Love it -- will definitely be back!",

It was deep, dark and delicious, with a double-digit alcohol content.   Food:   - Salt and Pepper fries  Nothing special (not peppery enough), but tasted great with the house-made hot sauce.  - Salt Cod Cakes  Consistency of a crab cake, though a little softer. Garnished with a really tasty arugula salad.  - Camembert and sharp cheddar  Pretty small portions for the price, but the pumpernickel crackers and amazing crushed, candied walnuts on the side made up for it.",

Some very interesting brews such as an IPA with juniper and pine needles and an English Porter with a hint oh habanero. Sausages are excellent and the cheese selection is very good but limited. Not crowded before 6:30 and even after still better than Toronado as far as seating. Much quieter also. Toronado is louder/divier while Mikkeller is a bit upscale. Depends on your mood where you go. So great to have this new option near Moscone Center. Toronado has more of the beers you know and want but Mikkeller has beer you cannot find anywhere else. ALL styles I and others tried were superb. 6 stars. :)",

The atmosphere is nice too, somewhat quieter than other beer bars, and the wait stuff are knowledgeable and friendly with pretty fast service.

It is your own branded place, paying $13 a glass for the Mikkeller \"Spontan\" sours, that are not the highest rated, seems a bit crazy, even for San Francisco prices. Even their Bruery guest tap beers were not that expensive. The \"Spontanframbos\" was very good, but this was no Cantillon or 3 Fonteinen, so not worth $13 IMHO.",

I enjoyed the Mikkeller Pilsner and enjoyed looking over the menu which included not only Mikkeller brews but great beers from all over the world. So thankful Yelp pointed me in this direction, since I've learned the story behind this organization I'm even more pleased I had the opportunity to try it.",

The only downfall is the neighborhood. \u00a0While I was walking on my way to Mikkeller, right outside the bar, my husband and I saw a homeless guy pulling his pants down while exposing his rear end (total eclipse), and urinating in broad daylight - I almost turned around to leave but I noticed Mikkeller's door man approached the guy and asked him to leave the area immediately.  The bar itself, its very cool. \u00a0I like the style and the simplicity but the space is rather small. \u00a0The bar its too big and it doesn't give enough room for people to stand or sit. \u00a0They should have made it smaller so there would be more room to add chairs or for people to stand - just a personal opinion. I guess I should stop complaining and just go back but on a day that's not crowded (which its probably in a few months since this place its relatively new).  The beer is amazing BUT the glasses are way too small. \u00a0A small wine glass for a beer that cost 10 bucks or more. \u00a0I mean, I understand if there are a couple of beers that need to be serve using these type of glasses but every single beer at the bar? I like the place but I don't like the area or the beer glasses. \u00a0I can ignore the area but I can't ignore the beer glass - please, make the portions reasonable especially if you are serving a 4-5% beer.",

The corned beef was EXTREMELY salty and over cooked to the point where the edges were as hard as a rock. There was practically no sauerkraut or dressing.  The worst part of my experience wasn't the sandwich however.  As I came back from washing my hands of the huge amount of grease that came with the sandwich I found my sandwich missing from the table. Apparently the busser thought my barely-touched sandwich was as bad as I did and couldn't stomach seeing it at the table. Much to my chagrin when I complained to our waiter about the sandwich he told me I should have told him earlier before the sandwich was eaten. I told him I would have if it wouldn't have disappeared.   As a small consolation the waiter offered to buy me a beer, too bad I don't drink. He knocked a beer off of the tables tab which was nice but didn't nearly cover the incredibly overpriced $16 sandwich.  I don't blame the server I guess, as he did at least try.

The food, really tasty, great compliments to the beverage choices. An excellent lunch or dinner location.  But you didn't come here for the food or ambiance did you? I sure didn't. I came the beer. Rarely would I use the word \"overwhelmed\" to describe my impression of a beer list. That said, it sure does fit here. A massive draft list, an equally impressive bottle list. Mikkeller keeps many of its unique beers on draft and bottle, making this a great source for those hard to find, going to run you 50+ per bottle in a high end store selections. Sometimes they even have them on draft. Orange Yuzu Aren't You Glad I Said Porter... Barrel aged? Why yes, yes \u00a0I will. The entire Sponten series in bottle? Oh please yes, Another 40+ taps and bottles? I don't have this much self control. So I went back. Three times in two days. Color me sold, I'm in love with this place.  If you're looking for a break from the west coast style beer (They do have some of that too, though often with a twist), or have never experience Mikkeller, this is the first stop you should be hitting in down town. However if you're just a beer fan, then get going even faster, because you'll want the extra time to pick from the cornucopia of beervana.",

I'm a sucker for saisons and sours lately and both I tried were fantastic. To only have a few on the list I recognized made the entire experience exciting and informative.   I went twice during my stay, once for just beer and once for dinner and beer. The communal tables are a little weird (\"hi new friends, sorry we're late, lemme listen to every world you say\") and it's a little bright in there. The service was helpful and helped me choose quickly which sour and saison I'd like the best. If they are spot on with their recommendations, then who cares about a pretentious attitude?

Beyond MIkkeller and Evil Twin, I found a number of other great breweries on tap, the most notable being Beachwood Brewing and Firestone Walker, the latter whose PIvo Pils is an affordable option and also just a beautiful beer.   I didn't try much of the food, but had the good fortune of going in on the day when the Bavarian pretzel was available and it was the best I'd had stateside.

We luckily found some bar seating behind the bar along the wall and only had to wait a couple of minutes. It was crazy packed so we had to flag down someone to take our order. Food came pretty quickly.  - Merguez: the sausages were pretty good, just a tad dry for my taste, the pepper salsa was a good compliment, and the fries were fries - Korean Wings: not much flavor and for $12, I expected more than 7 tiny wings and a daikon salad",

    "review_text": "I met some friends here yesterday for a drink and an impromptu meal. \u00a0We went during prime-time (7pm - 9pm), so this review should be read with that context in mind.  Aesthetic: Well lit, clean, and beautiful interior. \u00a0At the time, it was jam packed, so there was little to no seating to be had. \u00a0There are tons of booths and communal tables, but if you are going to be here during peak periods, definitely make a reservation! \u00a0We did not, but were able to get a couple of delicious beers while we waited for a spot at the bar. \u00a0We managed to do so after about 20 minutes.  Beer: \u00a0Exceptional list of beers and ales. \u00a0The establishment has several house made beers and two different bartenders were able to make great suggestions. \u00a0The prices were really no different than any I've seen around town and each beer we had were really great. \u00a0Definitely no complaints here.  Food: \u00a0I had a Chicken and Grits plate and it was ridiculously good. \u00a0Ridiculously Good. \u00a0It is hard to find good grits in SF and I loved the corn/red sauce that came with the dish. \u00a0Just the right amount of fire in that dish and the chicken was some of the best I've ever had. \u00a0My friend had the Fish and Chips and was not disappointed, either. \u00a0Not a bite left on the plates afterward. \u00a0Excellent meal for the price, as well.  Customer Service: \u00a0We sat at the bar (which is U-shaped) and it looked like there were at least four bartenders working the area. \u00a0We never sat long without having someone check in on us and all questions we had were answered courteously. \u00a0I'm not sure if the staff has worked together too long, and it appeared that there was some stiffness in their general disposition, but I would stop short of interpreting their demeanor as unfriendly or rude. \u00a0  Notes: \u00a0I love Metallica, Slayer, and even Megadeth as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure I'd have a playlist of those bands during dinner hours while people are trying to have conversations. \u00a0Maybe that's just me, though. \u00a0Also, I noticed that different bartenders would alternate between pouring beers and drinking sips from glasses that they just cleaned and poured. \u00a0I was hoping that maybe they were tasting for quality because there are so many different taps going? \u00a0If not, it just looked unprofessional. \u00a0But again, I might be picky about this kind of thing.  Overall: \u00a0I would definitely come back, though I would make reservations. \u00a0Three of us drank and two of us ate, with a bill coming in just under $100 bucks. \u00a0In SF, that's a deal for a good meal with great beer, if you ask me. \u00a0I wouldn't be surprisd if this place gets VERY popular, especially if their food stays as good as it is now.",

But when I found out the famed brewery's bar would be walking distance from my apartment here in San Francisco, I cried big crocodile tears of happiness.  Okay, so I didn't cry but I may have screamed.  I was there the first week they opened, when the throngs of fellow beer geeks and drive-by patrons made it difficult to actually enjoy my beer. And then I came back to show off our shiny new Danish craft beer bar to visiting enthusiasts. Most recently though, I've returned solo to just sit in this beautiful room drinking beautiful beers while chatting up the knowledgable barkeep.  As you would expect the beer list is always impressive - on every occasion I'm in, I find something new to try along with several personal standbys. As for food, they do it well. However, the menu focusing on housemade sausages is definitely spendy - I get around this by ordering the S&amp;P Fries, which are perfectly golden, crispy on the outside yet instantly all melty, and served in what anyone would consider a ginormous portion along with malt vinegar mayo. For $6, you'll feel like you've been briefly transported to the streets of Brussels. Those fries!  Music is well-curated with appearances by bands such as The Killers, Depeche Mode, and Daft Punk (and not the new album, thankfully). And the restrooms? Unusually immaculate.

There is plenty of \"standing\" space, where all you have is a wall shelf pretending to be a table to rest your drink on, while you chill back and send out your vibe people-watching.  I really hadda drop a deuce while I was here. I had McDonald's on the BART train on the way up. Since I was already BART-filthy and my clothes needed to be burned anyways, I figured why not drop heat at this bar instead of ripping ass all night? So i headed downstairs, expecting a graffiti-filled mudhole of a bathroom.  Nope. To my surprise, clean. A clean, quiet bathroom. With more than one shitter. Hell, it was so clean I almost bare-assed the toilet.  One thing though, no paper towels. Instead, you get that weird airblade thing that sits there on the wall, tempting you every time to just stick your dick in it just to see what it feels like.  F it. I sacrificed my clean hands and touched the damn door knob. I had to get back on BART to get home anyways.",

Lol, we wished we went next door instead, didn't seem as pretentious... Or at least the vibe there felt that way. No judgement really, just kinda felt a little out of place. Beer was ok, ordered the house brew, the pale ale was decent, nothing to rave about. Not sure if I'd come back here. Staff were very friendly and place was clean however can be quite crowded and tight spaces.",

    "review_text": "Friday night and this place is BUMPIN!! Doesn't take any reservations to my knowledge so if you want a nice spacious booth, come early or be prepared to wait for up to ~1hr. If you \u00a0are in a party of two you may have better luck snagging a few seats near the bar / community table areas. The hostess was super nice when we asked to get on the wait list for a booth (we were a big group, 6 people). She let us know that it would probably be about an hour and that we could roam around until a table opened up, and then she would come and find us. My friends and I circled around the bar and man it was packed! We ended up going downstairs and the noise level turned down a few notches. There was another community table down there along with a smaller bar area serving Mikkeller's collection of sour beers. However you can order ANYTHING from the full menu (and pay) and they'll bring it down to you! Good way to beat the crowd ;) It only took us a few minutes to get all of our beers. My friends and I then mosied our way back upstairs when our hostess promptly called out to us to say a table had opened up. Hardly half an hour had passed. WIN!   FOOD -Awesome selection of house made ground/seasoned/stuffed sausages! Drooooll. I had the Saucisson a l'ail (pork, garlic, topped off with caramelized onions). Generous proportion of sausage, hot, and full of flavor. Comes with salad or fries. I chose the fries and that also came in a generous proportion. I was pretty stuffed by the end of my meal.  DRINKS -Tons of drafted beers to choose from. I went for the Passion Pale, a pale ale with mangoes and passion fruit. It wasn't fruity at all, moreso hoppy than fruity.  -Friends had the Jolly Pumpkin Oro de Calabaza. -Huge list of sour beers to choose from as well.   AMBIANCE -Orangey lit ambiance. Lots of people and lots of talking. Fun place to go for small groups, especially if you wait around for a booth.  -Friendly and helpful staff! Our waiter checked on us at all the right times, when we were ready to order more drinks, when we finished our meal etc. Service was fast and great!  First time there on a crowded Friday and my friends and I walked away feeling satisfied and happy. Will come back again and try their other beers! :)",

    "review_text": "What's better than drinking a Mikkeller beer? Drinking a Mikkeller beer in a Mikeller bar - with all the offerings on tap, and what looks like some pretty damn decent food to boot.   I'm a big fan of these interesting, diverse, and flavor-packed beers. To seek them out in bottle form is usually a journey that requires trips to specialty beer stores. But with this addition to the SF beer scene, you can simply stop in and quaff some frosted barley pops in an upscale gastropub setting, paired with hearty portions of food.   The place can get crowded, and that's good for their business for sure. I was unable to sit when I visited, but wandering around with a tulip of some heady brew in my hand was just fine with me. As an avid fan of interesting beers, it's nice to have pretty much everything from this diverse line available in one place.   Mikkeller makes some damn good beer. You should drink some here.",

The selection of beer was incredible and I was able to try a few that I had never tried before. I went at about 3PM since I needed a break from walking around. The bartender was really helpful when I was selecting a beer and I also had a cheese plate, which was delicious. I loved the sleek Scandinavian decor. I also had a nice time chatting with the other people in the bar. This will definitely be on my list the next time I go to SF!",

I'm a fan of salt cod and was excited to try the salt cod cakes but they were disappointing - the texture and flavor were not as delicate as I had hoped and they were too salty. My boyfriend's half-smoked sausage was better. Crowded but not too noisy at 7pm on a Friday night in December, we were lucky to snag some seats by the back wall.",

Fries: Really nice crisp texture and they tasted fresh. \u00a0Came with a side of malt vinegar mayo and heinz ketchup. \u00a0  Tofu Banh Mi: Slightly underwhelming. \u00a0It came with large slabs of tofu. \u00a0I wanted a bit more of the pickled vegetables in it and the sauce soaked a bit through the bottom bun, making it soggy. \u00a0Decent flavors, but nothing that exciting.   Decent beer list. \u00a0I was hoping to see more of the Mikkeller Beers. \u00a0The beer menu may have been a 50-50 split between Mikkeller and other breweries. \u00a0Beer prices were about $1-$2 more expensive than they should be. \u00a0  3.5 stars, rounded up to 4, because I'm sure i'd come back. \u00a0  P.S. \u00a0The bathroom is downstairs by the bar. \u00a0Don't do what I did and exit through some double doors and walk up the stairs hoping to find a bathroom at each floor I arrived at, but ultimately arriving at a roof access door. \u00a0The bathroom is not on the roof.",

Came here the other night with my hubby, place \u00a0was packed~ about 15 minutes we finally got a seat @ the bar and about 15 minutes later we finally got noticed by the one lady beer tender~ so 31 minutes into arriving I finally get to sip on my beer it was great! So why only 2 star?? I happened to pay with plastic n tipped with paper. A couple of days later when I was doing my bills I noticed the someone had added a tip to my bill which I didn't appreciate and was very unprofessional!!! If I leave you a cash tip why would you charge me a tip on my cc?? Thats not only wrong but I think its illegal as well. \u00a0 I tried to contact Mikkeller with an email but no response very unprofessional guys! Oh well, me or my people will not be coming back! P.s. the door guy and beer tender with the long hair were awesome!",

And even tho I haven't tried the food, the menu looks pretty yummy.  The outside, meh, but when you walk in this place is amazing, different too other local bars and the best part, not as touristy as you would think since it is in the heart of union square and the shopping center.  My first time, I came to catch up quickly on a Thursday night with a friend from grad school. The place was packed and we couldn't sit down, but we hung around the bar and quickly ordered some beers. I had the tenderloin IPA and I loved it. On a second occasion I was supposed to meet my friend and her boyfriend for dinner, but the wait was about an hour to get seated so we decided to go across the street instead, but we all wanted to try it together so badly and this past Friday we took it off the list. We came for happy hour and luckily got seated super quickly near the bar. I again ordered my IPA and, even tho it is a bit loud In here, my friend and I had a great time and conversation. We discovered there was more seating downstairs as we'll so now we know!  One thing I loved was the service and the atmosphere of course. Totally different to other brewery like places. Our server was great and super friendly. He kept coming to talk to us about the beers and ensuring everything was great and that us ladies were having an enjoyable time.  No kidding, I live in the corner and this place will indeed be one of my top choices for date nights, happy hours and just whatever my friends and I have going on, at least with those that enjoy a nice, tasty and classy beer. Still need to come and try the food...looks yummy!",

Very crowded on a Friday night and hard to maneuver around the central bar/tap area. We ended up asking for a table which they said would take about an hour to open up. We ordered beers downstairs and once we came back up (say 20 minutes later) a table opened up and we were seated! So lucky given we had about six people. The booth fit us all comfortably and the grub was pretty good! Definitely a small menu specializing in sausages and other easy to eat foods.   Definitely pairs well with the beers they have on tap. Around 8 p.m. the crowd lightened up and it was easier to walk. So if you were to stop for a late beer that might be a better time to go.   They have a lot of unique European beers that are hard to come by, so if you're a beer connoisseur this might be of interest to you! Glasses are a bit pricey, but this is San Francisco after all, and San Franciscans love to eat and drink!",
