First of all the owner is all glaring at me because I kept wanting to play drinko instead of ordering a \"real drink\" I suppose. if that's your problem then why do you have the game up anyway?!   Second of all, they would not give me chaser. No chaser, barely gave me any water and that too was given very hesitantly. I just wanted a jello shot! They wouldn't even let me switch it out! I had to use a water bottle I luckily had in my purse.   This was on Super Bowl 2013 game day. They have a bunch of snacks laid out. My friends and I drink really slowly and we had the whole day so we were ordering slowly too. Owner gets pissed at us and tells us to get away from the food if we aren't going to order. DOOD!!! We've been playing drinko for the past 10 minutes! My friends ordered 2 beers too. Still glaring at us for eating. At this point we just got so sick of the attitude we just left. I love my 49ers and I'm not about to ruin game day because of some rude bar owners who don't know how to treat customers with some respect. If they had asked politely in the beginning, we totally would have ordered a lot more.",

Plus there's TONS of seating. \u00a0A strangely novel concept, but much appreciated.  Bartender - super nice.  I'm a Tour Manager for a company that specializes in 18-35 year-olds and I'm in San Francisco every couple of weeks. \u00a0For an entire year, I've been looking for a place to take my clients on a Sunday night. \u00a0I experimented with various bars in various neighborhoods. \u00a0Each time, the clients would stay for one drink and then bolt for the door. \u00a0Finally, I just picked a random bar close to the hotel, so everyone could just walk home if they wanted to leave early. \u00a0That random bar happened to be the Hot Spot. \u00a0The clients LOVED it. \u00a0They could play their favorite songs on the jukebox, play pool in the upstairs loft and casually mingle amongst themselves. \u00a0Most of them stayed until closing. \u00a0I've recommended it to all my fellow Tour Managers.",

For once the bar bathroom wasn't that bad which can be rare on a Saturday night.   No complaints for this spot. It wasn't overly crowded but not dead either. I shall assume it was mostly regulars who seemed to be a nice bunch. The bartender was really friendly too. We will surely come back when in the neighborhood and needing to quench our thirst.",
