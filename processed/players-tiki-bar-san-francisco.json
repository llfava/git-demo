They have a pretty good beer on tap selection, and the bartender, Shayn, made great cocktails as well. Definitely recommend it for the view and the service - just go to the Players Bar and find your way to the very back. Seriously though, it's in the very back of the place, through a full arcade, and its worth finding your way back there.",
