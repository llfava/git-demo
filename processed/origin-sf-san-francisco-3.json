They will cut off the line at a certain point once they reach a certain capacity.I was really close to the cut-off point.   Anyway, I got inside sometime past 10:30pm. If you're not on the guest list or if you get in past 10:30pm, you pay a fee. I paid $20.The place itself looks really nice although it was kind of small. I thought the interior was actually pretty nice. Place overall was really packed. TOO PACKED.  The bathroom was nice and clean because of staff being on duty pretty much the whole time, waiting for a mess to happen. They're also pretty nice and helpful. The line for the bathroom is also long but, as a girl, I had ample time to look at myself in all the mirrors they had lined up along the walls. The guys don't have the same luxury.   Bartenders are very attentive and nice. I got a Pineapple Malibu for $10 which is the usual expensive price paid at other clubs. The music of that night was mainly EDM. Some songs are cool but would have wanted more variety. The girls at the club are cute! They wore glittery leotard things that night and mostly hung around and brought sparklers and bottles for bottle service tables.   There is only really one dance floor. You can dance on the top floor but half of it is a smoking area and the other half is a balcony with little couches. Not much space there but not much space anywhere really.   Overall experience was okay. Everything was pretty cool but personally did not \u00a0like the playlist that night and hated how incredibly packed it was.",

We put our names on the guestlist for the pre-launch party, and went in around 10:30 p.m. It was pretty empty because people don't usually go until 11 or 11:30 p.m., but it was fine. We got to see the whole club without having to trample over people.   The club is SUPER swanky inside with bunny go-go dancers and all, and they are all so gorgeous. The decor and lighting was very nice, and reminded me of a smaller version of a Vegas club. I'm not sure how much cover usually is, but try to get on the guestlist if you can.   Well drinks were like $12 and that blew my mind. So if that's any indication of what the prices are here, I'm guessing cover will be like $20 or so? But anyway, the bartender was super sweet and pretty as well. There are just a lot of attractive women in SF, and I kept thinking the whole time that my guy friends back in Seattle would LOVE this joint.  Crowd was pretty diverse: mostly Asian Americans though. This would be a nice place to celebrate someone's birthday because the booths/tables are very nice, and of course, they bring out your alcohol with sparklers.",

Initial impressions of the place were good. Numerous Armand de Brignac displayed prominently on the foyer bar, great decorations and decor. However, as I walked around I noticed a few things lacking: You could see into the men's restroom, and with that -- the mirror which reflected the backs of the gentlemens peeing @ the urinals. You could see some of the unpainted plasterboard in the ceiling. I did enjoy that we could sit around at the foyer area though.   Guys and girls situation is pretty much similar to The Grand. They probably have the same criteria to let people in.   The music was good, but not spectacular.  Prediction? They will ride the hype train and either Origin or The Grand will change management within the year, probably for a hefty sum.",

She even refuses to step foot in.  A group of friends and I were down the street at boom boom room when one of them mentioned coming into origin because he wanted a change of scenery... and boy, did we get that. We, group of 6 all not Asian but diverse, walk over and stand in line; immediate turn off. Once in, after $20!, a friend grabs me and whispers \"bruh, we are the minority\".   Literally, a sea of Asian people.... I felt like I was in japan or Vietnam again. I had only been to origin twice (once for the grand opening) and it was somewhat diverse but we literally made a game of it. We, buzzed not drunk yet, scanned the room to find out we were the only non-asians in the club. \u00a0Rumor has it that origin is the same owner as the grand, which now makes sense, but not my cup of tea. My friends are about as diverse and eclectic as it comes but we straight up felt like black sheep.

    "review_text": "Well it was my birthday, and they wouldn't let 2 of my friends in. Let me just say this: This is not Las Vegas. Enforcing such a strict dress code, especially when you first open your doors, isn't going to get you anywhere fast. So, it was my birthday celebration, and we called ahead to make sure about the dress code.  They said nothing about \"white-bottom\" sneakers being non-dress code compliant. So we go in line, and we see some guy in front of us with \"white-bottom\" sneakers go in ahead of us. Ok, cool, no sweat. The bouncers let that guy in, one more guy with \"white-bottom\" sneakers shouldn't hurt, right? Wroonnnng.  They told one of the guys in our group to step of line because of the white on his shoes. Are you fucking kidding me?! We noted that, \"hey, you just let in someone with these same shoes, wtf.\" And the bouncer responded, \"Oh well, I have something with him.\" The fuck is that supposed to mean. Blatant favoritism? Yeah, I get it, maybe you're friends with that guy. Special exceptions happen, but how do you think that reflects on other customers when you deny them something so small? Who the fuck looks at shoes in a dark club anyways!? It's not like his shoes were grotesque or something the city gutter expelled. \u00a0In fact, they were new. They weren't athletic sneakers, or some dorky running sneakers.   The thing that gets me most is that we even called ahead to make sure about the dress code. So the customer service on this end is pretty shitty- despite explaining that it was my birthday and we all came here- for this club- all the way from Newark/Castro Valley.  In my experienced, the people make a place. We all decided to ditch this place and go to Ruby Skye. Because Ruby Skye doesn't treat people like this, and they even gave me earplugs and wished me a happy birthday.   Note to Origin: This is San Francisco. You're leasing this place right next to a produce market. What sense do you have trying to enforce Las Vegas Club standards on us? What sense do you have being so rude to your own customers? If you really want to be successful, I'd take a look at Ruby Skye. They let almost everyone in because they understand good vibes come with good attitude and happy people. Origin, you should change your mannerisms, because the weight of 1 bad review isn't something you'd want on your yelp page- and you just upset about 15 people that night.",

If you wanna be somewhere a lil more chill than maybe get a table upstairs otherwise the main lounge where u first enter is probably the least crowded.  If ur jus tryna go in line then be prepared to wait or get there mad early...its a long ass line  If you wanted to compare to the grand, id say everythin bout the grand is better...the parking...a lil less crowded...larger venue...easier to get drinks at the bar...smaller line for bathrooms (origin only has one friggin bathroom...even the guys line is long so pray that u never hafta take a dump...not that ud ever wanna take one in a club)  Overall the club is jus aite to me. Its nice but everythin overpriced as usual and they seriously should get another bathroom.",

Also when other people are crowding your table they don't do much about It. As for the crowd everyone knows it's all Asians. I thought this was an exaggeration but sadly it's true there are lots of very fobby Asians at this club.

I came here on a Friday night with a group of friends and luckily, we found a parking spot right across the street! There was no line at all cause we were early so we just pre-gamed before heading in.   I thought the security guards were really friendly! One of them even said \"hope you have a good time\" to me :) The bartenders were also very nice and friendly when my friends and I were buying drinks   The interior was really nice but the dance floor was kind of small. The mingling area has a lot of couches which I like cause if you're dancing in heels all night, it's nice to have a place to sit and rest. It's also not too loud so you can actually hear the conversation you're having with someone.   Music is a mix of EDM and top 40. I wish they'd play more hip hop tho!",

    "review_text": "I've been to Origin about 5 times since its first grand opening and the club has been a major disappointment. The only reason why I come here is because my girlfriend and her friends do. This is because I have been witness to immense amounts of sketchy behavior that the club owners have perpetrated. The most recent was when I signed up for the Saturday guestlist a day in advance and was told by the Asian bouncer that my name was not on the list. My male friend who signed up next to me also was told his name was not on the list. So therefore we were gyped out of $20 each even though we were at the front of the line 45 min before guestlist closed.  Additionally, the crowd at this place sucks. I'm talking about ratchet people. Twice already dudes I didn't know have wanted to fight me for no reason (probably cause girls they are interested in approach me). One of the times I told the security guard about a guy who keeps talking shit to me and the guard just laughed it off and continued flirting with one of the hired dancers.  The music here is not good. It's the worst combination of EDM and top 40 possible by Djs that don't know how to mix. The drinks are watered down and overpriced. The bathrooms are spilling with urine on every surface and the dance floor is sticky and grimey.  Origin, I am extremely disappointed of your staff for its shady tactics and for management for not doing a better job. Hopefully I will never have to come here again. Stay far away from this place and go to Raven.",

We waited for about 30 minutes and still couldn't get in before 10:30 so we paid. I'm not sure if it is everyday but the dresscode was definitely strictly enforced so gentlemen be sure to wear DRESS SHOES nothing with sports logos or casual logos. I guess since it was a saturday it was more packed than usual but it was so full that they started giving out vouchers to the grand so people would leave and allow them to let more people in.   Once we got inside, the interior is definitely very nice and I really liked it. However, the size of the floor is small. It was so packed that people couldn't get onto the dance floor. \u00a0 Drinks are pretty expensive so I recommend pre gaming at least a little before you go in. Crowd is pretty much 90% asian and probably still in college so keep that in mind.   If you are planning to come to this club be sure to dress to impress and probably consider going on a friday when there is less people. If you are not arriving at least 10 minutes before 10 you probably won't be getting in through the guestlist.",

Most importantly, if must go, head over in the next month or so when everyone is talking about it because this place won't be around in 6 months.

    "review_text": "This is supposed to be the new \"hot\" club in town -- I would just say lukewarm at best. \u00a0  Here are some things to consider before you come and waste a Saturday night:  Line: the bouncers intentionally hold the line - I got there at ~10 and wasted at least 30-40 minutes in line and paid $20 in cover. If you want to make guest list, I would suggest you get there at 9:15. Based on the novelty of this club, the line will go well down the street.  Dress Code: Dress to impress. DO NOT wear white soled tennis shoes. It's better to not risk it and wear nicer shoes, boys. The bouncers are incredibly inconsistent regarding this policy because my friend got turned away and then I saw a bunch of guys in the club wearing tennis shoes with white soles.   Bouncers/staff: Overall I thought the staff at Origin was pretty lousy. It started off with bouncers hassling my friend for wearing tennis shoes with white soles. I tried to remedy the situation and actually have a conversation with the bouncers -- they blew me off even when I was on the verge of tears. The staff that was supposed to clean up the place really shove their way through, unfortunately. Bartenders make drinks wrong.   Bathrooms: The lines are ridiculous, even for men. It's nice because the women's bathroom has a line and there's a lady there to clean up any trashy barfing action. But really 4 stalls for a club, isn't enough. Also the bathrooms are really in an awkward position underneath the second floor/balcony right before the entrance to the dance floor.   Music: Pure EDM - no hip hop, top 40. If you don't like EDM - stay at home.  Venue: \u00a0The venue itself is in Japan town, bordering the Western Addition - which isn't the greatest part of town. The club is oddly designed -- one front lounge/bottle service area, two bars, small dance floor, and an upstairs area with standing room and tables. It felt that they spent more than 50% of their club space to dedicate to high dollar bottle service. But the majority of the tables were empty on a Saturday night -- which is a really bad sign. \u00a0  Dance Floor: Small. People are especially pushy and the dance floor is surrounded by empty tables. I got stepped on multiple times throughout the night. \u00a0They like to blast foam / confetti, which just turns into a giant mess. The lighting on the dance floor is seizure worthy.   Crowd: Asian, enough said.   Drinks: They don't own shot glasses because all your shots and chases come in little plastic cups. You know the kid you drank out of when you were 17 and excited to drink underage at a frat party. Bartenders are medicore and the bars could be better staffed. 2 bars - one in front when you come in which clogs the incoming traffic and then one on the dance floor.   In summary, Origin is well below mediocre and needs much improvement regarding how they manage their line, music, and ambiance. They call themselves a boutique nightclub, but fail to be elite or fashionable.",

So now I'm just more disappointed than anything, because I actually like frequenting The Grand. They've always treated me and my group well.   The level of \"service\" here at this establishment however, is definitely not a priority to them. I was in line with my friends from out of town, checking out this new spot for the first time, only to be embarrassed. I understand the guestlist ends at 10:30, most do. But I was let in at exactly at 10:32pm and didn't make the cut, even though I was in line way before the cut off. I had to apologize to my friends because that's just not how you want to start of the night! Then when we got in to use the ATM to get cash, the man at the door was beyond rude. He made me and my friends answer all these questions before giving me my ID back, which I get... but sheesh.. THAT many questions? He even asked me for my driver's license weight. RUDE. But that wasn't even the worst of it. He held my friend's ID above his head, out of her reach and said, you can have it back if you can reach it. WTF!? Maybe it was a joke... but we just stared at him in disbelieft until he just said, \"fine.. here\"  Then at the bar with their overpriced drinks, which is whatever because that is to be expected, they didnt have apple juice!? It wasn't like I was asking for something ridiculous like blueberry soda! This normally wouldnt be a big deal.. but it just kept adding up and I kept feeling bad that I suggested this place to my friends.  Another little tidbit that I feel like they should be aware of is their consistency. In the bathroom, I noticed that the attendant would let some girls into the bathroom together and some she wouldnt. My friend was wearing a jumpsuit and needed help taking it off so I was going in with her but wasn't allowed at first. I had to explain that in front of all these strangers that I had to help her undress to urinate! At least she let me in afterwards....   Sorry for the rant yelpers... but I just feel like there are better places to go in the city and in the Bay Area for that matter. For a new establishment to treat their guests this way is just ludacris. Don't they want business? All I'm saying is.. if you want to impress your friends or if you want to take them out for a good time.. try another place.",

Like I said, place is small so it gets hellaaaaa crowded. There's two floors, but the second floor isn't much -- just a couple of tables and a bar. Dance floor is on the first floor, and it gets so crowded that you can't even move that much. Crowd is also definitely Asian, haha, just sayinnn! Girl bathrooms are clean and there's mirrors along the hallway, which is nice.   I do like the music here, though. A lot of top 40/hip hop/bit of edm. Good mix.

Just an observation, and a very accurate one at that. \u00a0  In case you haven't put it together yet, me and the two guys I was with are white. \u00a0Very white. \u00a0Also I have to add that I have worked in this club/bar industry so I am aware of the asian population, I'm just simply stating how my first experience is. \u00a0  So were met by our hostess and she shows us to our table which is basically right to the left of the entrance, one of the tables right in the middle of the lounge area in front of the bar, so we were surrounded by people all night. \u00a0Great seating and was very satisfied with the seating. \u00a0Hostess brought us our bottles of vodka (girls choice) and a couple buckets of beer to quench our thirst (not to mention the fifth of Jack we cashed on the way in on bart) while we waited for the girls. \u00a0The hostess was very tentative and the bartender (asian chick) was very kind and quick w some more shots (Jack....c'mon now, obviously).  Girls FINALLY showed up. \u00a0(JK Jane \u00a0don't kill me if your reading this). \u00a0They ended up showing up with more girls than I expected, exceeding the number of ppl i put down for our table but since they were girls I think security said 'Fuck It', as they usually do in an instance such as this, at least with me its always like that.  Cashed most of the bottles (mostly us guys) and basically had a great night, don't remember the last two hours really but the music was good and dance floor was packed. \u00a0DJ mostly played the typical EDM pop hiphop mashup thing, which you should expect at most SF clubs unless they specify that they play serious house or only hip hop. \u00a0Giant sea of black hair and even made some new friends in the dance floor. \u00a0I just have to say one last time . \u00a0Me and my boys were the ONLY WHITE PEOPLE (blonde for that matter) in the club apart from I think all the hostesses, a bartender and maybe a couple of the security. \u00a0So if your looking for a club that is very mixed or any other particular race/demographic then go elsewhere.  However I don't think you should go elsewhere cause the place was poppin. \u00a0Overall my experience was great, table price was very fair and I will definitely be back very very soon.",

    "review_text": "Oh, Origin. For being a swanky new up and coming club in SF, it does live up to its title. And it's being built up to have a good reputation for the layout and service of it. Everything is brand new, modern, and sleek. The interior design creates a nice ambience similar to Vegas, which I think they were aiming for. However, this is NOT Vegas, so the guards should stop acting like it is.   Before coming to Origin I read up on the reviews of the place. New club, gorgeous, diverse/good music, prices are okay, staff was friendly, especially the guards. That's definitely a plus for any club. If the service was anywhere near fantastic then any business would flourish with a good reputation. That reeled me right in. I thought this club might be different with some good mixed reviews stating the same positive things. However, when I got there, that picture completely shattered.   1. The demographic consisted mainly of Asians this night. There was a group of guys ahead of us that had problems with the bouncers and got pulled out of the line. After a couple of minutes, the guard comes up to us and takes 3 of my guys harassing them outside of the line. Seriously? We were 2 separate groups. The other guys even said they didn't know my friends. One of the guards had the audacity to come up and tell me, \"If you have something to say then step out of line because you won't be getting back in.\" Origin's 15 minutes of fame with me just went out the window. Strike 1, Origin.  2. The club is still brand new, opening just 6 weeks ago. For some reason this meant their website was still being built up. As a business, if you're going to have a grand opening everything should be ready to go. Especially your website where guests can find important information! Like the dress code for instance. The reviews on Yelp said that the dress code was not that strict or there wasn't one that was enforced. Okay, good to know especially if you're a guy. Four of our guy friends could not get in because of their shoes. From the reviews I've read people have went in with sneakers and super casual clothing. I guess they decided to change it for this weekend and NOT inform anyone because their website is \"coming soon\". \u00a0There is no honor system here. We informed the guard that there is no dress code information on their website and reviews have said it was not enforced. With a sassy attitude he replied, \"For sure it's on there\". Strike 2, Origin.   3. Someone didn't thoroughly think through the interior design when planning this. One word: tiles. A lot of the flooring has tiles. This is a club. People get drunk. People spill shit on the floor. There are girls in heels. They will slip and fall and if one of them is sober enough to remember...can you say lawsuit? Seriously, I saw 4 girls slip and fall all in the same spot within 30 mins. One poor girl fell so hard that she had to ice her knee the whole night. I hope Origin was able to compensate her with something. Maybe a drink to get her more drunk to forget the whole incident, dodging any legalities, or a lap dance to numb her knee pain. Strike 3, Origin.   In conclusion...this is an unorganized new club with abrasive guards who have no idea what they're doing. Even if the inside is a walking death trap for ladies in heels, it's still gorgeous with a nice ambience. And that is the only reason why I gave it 2 stars.   PS. Did I mention coat check is $5 per item? Yes, per.",

This place is the old rasazales(sp) which was my spot because it played really good live jazz and had a great wine selection...can you see me getting old that i prefer a jazz club over a night club? But still decided to give this place a chance.  The decor is beautiful. It looks like a great new venue. Two stories and the main dancefloor is in the back. I was really impressed. The drinks are $12...for well or grey goose....guess what i was drinking? But really $12 for a drink? I was expecting $9-10 but $12....well that set me back a little bit. So now being older and wiser, with older and wiser friends we decided to get a bottle...because with 5 seasoned alcoholics...a bottle makes more sense economically. upstairs are $300, the ones on the side are $500, and the ones closest the entrance are $1000... We wanted the $300 table but they were sold out...  The music started off really really really good. Lots of old school hip hop...a few \"thats my jam!!!\" came out...then they switched it up to house...i love a little house now and then...but when 3/4 of your crowd stops dancing...its time to go back to hip hop. As a sign of my age...when #selfie came on and those young girls screamed like they just saw Justin Bieber walked in...it took a lot for me not vomit. But i took a deep breathe and realized that i am on their territory. I did my time as a 23 club hopper in short skirts and 4 inche heels, a half a pound of make up and about 2 AMF's deep.   Things I have learned as i get ready to exit my 20's Pay the $20, pre game, and forget the free entry If there are 4+ adults...get a bottle . Its more comfortable to dance all night if you are not wearing sky high stiletos.  This place is actually a lot of fun and i would not mind going back on another night...",

Generous seating areas in the lobby. Parking's not hard, but that might just be me - lucky and local.  After several nights out at Origin, one time sober, one time not buzzing enough, several times a mess, it's safe to say the crowd is great but the music...this thing called EDM plays all night and it sounds like noise, noise and more noise. Like I mentioned in my TIP, this is not EDC. As for Asian boys with spiked hair? I haven't really noticed. But Asian guys with the comb over look or new mainstream hipster cut, they're around. The older guys dress nicer, the younger guys dress more casual (IMO). Bartenders are fast with the drinks, but we all know shots are the way to go.  I am absolutely a fan of the interior and the vibe this place is going for, but I think they might need to work on those lines and how they decide to charge. We rolled in here at 1AM and they still held up the $20 cover. No comment on the security guards so far. 6 shots in 45 minutes. Holding onto our youth! If you've never been, it's worth checking out.

They do a quick ID and bag check, see if your name is on the list, and in you go. There is a $5 locker option. No re-entry even if you got in earlier with a stamp. Makes sense since the club got pretty crowded around midnight. Drinks/shots are about $10-$15. Typical prices in the city. The bartenders are extremely nice! They definitely deserve a nice, big tip.   There are multiple lit mirrors leading into the women's restroom. The dance floor was spacious and there was plenty of seating area if you got tired.

    "review_text": "This is my first low rating on Yelp, I wish I could go negative.  My review is just about the beginning of the night..while waiting in line to get into Origin, one of the African Amercian bouncers sporting glasses told a friend to \"fix her face\" because she didn't hear him the first time he was telling the crowd to move the line closer to the wall.  When she understandably said \"excuse me?\", he became very aggressive and had a disgusting attitude, saying that he was telling her to \"fix her face because you need to fix your attitude\", further going on to say that he is being absolutely sincere because he is smiling at her. The entire crowd was shocked at this point, but of course no one does anything because people don't stand up for strangers these days.  You do NOT tell ANYONE that his/her face is messed up, especially for such a small offense. This angered me so, that a little bit of power can turn a guy into an asshole and misogynist.   He has NO respect for girls, telling all the girls who stood up for my friend that they can leave if they weren't okay with what he said.   There was no apology and in fact, he became ruder and ruder the more support she got.   I refuse to support a nightclub or business that allows this type of OFFENSIVE, IMMATURE, LOATHING man to mistreat guests and disrespect people in this way without remorse or apology. I am never coming back here, and would tell my friends the same. It doesn't matter how nice the club may be on the interior or what kind of company it attracts if its bouncers are ABSOLUTE SCUM and willing to hurt others for their own ego.  Never got a chance to go in, don't care.  One of my other friends, a guy, also got his face destroyed by the bouncers here. He was pinned down while his face was being smashed by another bouncer. What the hell kind of place is this? Do the owners even care?",

It's been a while since I've been clubbing on a weekly basis so I don't know any of the newer clubs that have been around since 2008. A buddy of mine suggested I throw a joint bday here this year with our mutual friend, so I agreed. There was probably about 20 of us and we decided to get a few bottles upstairs.   Note that this was before the grand opening, so we showed up around 10:10pm and got in with guestlist. People started showing up later on and it got pretty crowded, but honestly I was pretty drunk and did not remember too much. I just remembered there being a lot of Asians and young ones at that. The table upstairs was located on a walkway, so we had a lot of people trying to walk by which was annoying. Bottles cost anywhere from $350-$500 for the normal stuff (Jameson, Fireball, Greygoose, etc). The nice part is the bottles are pretty big. The Grey Goose bottle was Costco sized.  My second time to Origin was also for a bday party. This time it was the grand opening and by 10pm the line was down the block. Luckily, we had bottle service again so we walked right in. Even though the line was outrageous, the club itself was completely empty. They were obviously holding the line so people would have to fork up cover. Our table this time was by the dance floor, which was horrible. The space was tiny and fits 6-8 comfortably but we had about triple the amount of people. I was sober enough this time to speculate the crowd and music. They play a lot of EDM and some hiphop. There were a lot of guys looking like they wanted to start trouble and girls pushing their way through the crowds. It was VERY crowded and a lot of the club goers were just rude.   With that said, the club itself is very nice. They try to make it like a Vegas club, having foam come down from the ceiling and the wide array of disco lights. They claim to keep up classy by making guys dress in collared shirts, no sneakers, baseball caps... but it doesn't really seem to do the trick as the crowd is far from classy. Drinks are pricey as expected. I have not been back since and did not plan to until this weekend since I have another bday to go to. I'm kind of dreading it already...  2 stars mainly because of the crowd and the fact that they hold up the line so no one gets in free unless you get there at 9. Drinks are overpriced. Nice club atmosphere, but not enough to make me want to go back.",

If I can see the facial expressions of people at the other end of the room, the lights need to be dimmed.  * The music was garbage. Heavy focus on top 40s and overplayed hits, some rather outdated. \"Call Me Maybe\"... so 2012. \"Levels\" may have been the best song played all night.  * The female servers were all very attractive and very exposed in their Playboyesque outfits (fishnets, black leotards, and black bunny ears). However, at least one of them had a serious attitude problem. Our server seemed irritated all night. She shoved past people rather than asking them to step aside. She bumped into my friend and caused him to spill his drink all over my foot either. She either didn't notice or didn't care and definetely didn't apologize.  * The table area was not regulated at all. It was only elevated half a foot above the dance floor, so it was really easy for people to duck under the railing and climb up. Great if you want more friends to join. Bad if you don't want randos encroaching on your space.   * Nobody controlling who danced on the podiums by the DJ. No one wants to watch creepy underdressed guys getting all handsy with girls or girls in super loose rompers shake their asses. At least no one I know. Letting guys sit on the podium doesn't make the club look bumping either. IMHO, save it for club-employed dancers.  * Dress code not enforced. A lot of people were in sneakers, T-shirts, and daytime clothing.   * The foam was gross.   * The confetti kept falling into the carafes at the table.  * The floor in the hallways and at the table areas was covered in small bumpy tiles. Very uncomfortable under heels.",

I'm really hoping the hype/line dies down after it's not the 'new-kid-on-the-block' anymore.  I've never ever left the house while it was still light out for a club. LOL. Left the house around 8:45 (to be safe and make it before 9:30). Needless to stay, I was really early there are other bars you can hit up and pregame before heading here though.  Line was set up and 9:30 and the line grows crazy fast after that. Their online guestlist is a little wonky. I signed up and didn't get an email confirmation (I doublechecked it was the right date and everything!). The bouncer wasn't gonna let me in, but it was still so early (9:45) and I was one of the very few girls lining up so early, so he gave us a ticket. Talked to a few other people and they ran into the same issue. Fix your damn site! Woulda been stupid if we had to pay to get in even though we signed up and it was before 10.  THIS CLUB IS THE MOST ASIAN CLUB I'VE EVER BEEN TO. It's a pro or con depending on what you prefer but there was seriously ZERO diversity, it was mind-boggling. Drinks are $12 each. They are fast though and there isn't really a line for the bar.  I like the half lounge, half club set up. Plenty of seating for the old and tired. The dance floor is small as EFF- literally packed like sardines. Sweaty.  Overall as a club I like this place because 1) there's plenty of seating, 2) bathroom line wasn't ridiculous and kept clean (and lighted)!, 3) it's really pretty inside, 4) they had good music (mostly EDM), 5) their security was on point. I saw three people getting kicked out and I left at 1 AM.  **If you're a noob to the city don't park towards the Western Addition side, it gets sketch within like 3 blocks of here.

I was there with two friends and we happen to be in between two groups of large groups of guys in line. The bouncer pulled everyone out of line and said there was too many guys. We were with neither group and still got forcibly removed. Again I do not recommend patronizing a place with this type of shady business practices.

I arrived by midnight to avoid the lines (yes, there's a cover charge for $20 a person). As you walk in, there are fancy furniture and couches to chill/socialize with friends over a martini.   They make their drinks pretty strong, just the way I like 'em! The music totally hits the spot... EDM &amp; top hip hop songs! I felt like I am in a rave, at the same time in the club.   There's a second story where you can see people dancing on the first floor with cool light strobes across the room with fogs and bubbles bursting in the air. Pretty fun.   The bathroom lines are insane. There was an incident where my friend left the bathroom and this drunk Asian dude just pushed him for no apparent reason and next thing you know he wanted to start a fight. I broke them off to prevent more conflicts then the security guard kicked out my friend out of the club (wtf??). We explained what happened and then he apologize for kicking him out when it wasn't his fault The guard was nice and apologetic, though.   Overall, good club despite of what happened near the end.",

I thought less people would be here that night (6/21) because it was EDC weekend haha. The line also moves REALLY slow too! Oh yeah. I was standing in line when a bouncer was offering free tickets/vouchers to get in The Grand (another nightclub in sf) for free.   SUPER small dance floor. Either there was A LOT OF PEOPLE that night or it was the small dance floor. Yeah... it was the dance floor. I could barely dance, yet alone stand without people trying to get through.   Oh yeah... IT IS WAY TOOOOOO BRIGHT IN THERE!! :(  Overall, okay experience and would come earlier next time!

Went to Origin for the second time on a Saturday night and got in line at 9:20 to make the 10:30 guestlist. Nope. Was still standing in a ridiculously slow and long line at 10:30, and at 11:30, my friends and I were told the club was at capacity. We were at the front of the line, but there was still a huge line behind us. \u00a0Yup, stood in line for 2 hours to get into a club (and didn't get in). Never had any club experience like this anywhere. \u00a0Either you need to let people in at an appropriate time or make sure people make the guestlist. \u00a0If you're gonna make people wait in line and pay a $20 cover I hope it's worth it. For a club with mediocre DJs, poor service, and awful management, the cover and intentionally slow-moving line are ridiculous. And free tickets to The Grand if we don't make capacity? PLEASE, girlfriend. Needless to say, by that point, Origin was clearly not worth the wait or the cover. Headed to Bootie instead, where it is always a hit, even with a $15 cover.  Only giving this place 2 stars because the first time I went I had such a fun night. The EDM was alright, drinks were alright, atmosphere was great. \u00a0Really had nothing to complain about other than the ridiculous cover. It was a Friday night, the line to get in took a few minutes and the place wasn't too packed. \u00a0Unfortunately, it really doesn't make up for anything.  Tip: if you really need to see what the (over)hype is about, get there before 9:20 on a Saturday or go on a Friday.",

Yes, that is indeed a very personal statement but if there is one silver lining, I'd say Origin's bouncers are polite and considerate. Other than that, I am so not target audience for this place and it'll be a miracle for me to come back (Mighty, Monarch and Public Works are top of mind if I want to dance).  In conclusion;  If you consider 'clubbing' as paying $20 cover to dance to Top 40 remixes, this place is for you.  If you like dance floors surrounded by a balcony full of men starring down at you, perhaps seeking their next prey, this place is for you.  If you like being told a table is $1,000 (which is maybe ok in LV or Miami) - and only find out that you can get a table for substantially less once inside - this place is for you.  If you like your shots of vodka to come with two ice cubes - this place is for you (and kudos have better shot handling skills than me, my throat just don't swallow with chunks of ice while doing shots).  If you have good enough balance to not fall ass up on wet fake stone tile floors, while rocking 4in Malonos, then this place is for you.  If you like being surrounded by a barely-old-enough-to-drink crowd dry humping like they have no where else to take it to 3rd base, this place is for you.",

    "review_text": "Alright. I have been wanting to go here so I can write a review haha. What I do for Yelp. I just like writing a thorough review because I hate searching through incomplete ones. Here is what you have to know.  Guestlist You can guestlist online on their website and get in for free before 10:30pm. I got there around 10:15pm and there was already a huge line of cheap asians and I knew we werent gonna get it. My friend got there a bit before 10 and was able to get in but the line was not moving. It was amazing how after 10:30 the line started to pick up again...well it is $20 for cover and luckily I had some cash. If you dont, well it looks like you are buying someone drinks at the bar to make up for it. So if you really want to get in for free, be in line at 10. If you know you are coming later, might as well show up like a cool person at midnight.  Parking Parking is pretty tough around Japantown. As you drive toward the area, it actually gets pretty ghetto. We parked a few streets down because anything closer, we would be circling for days. Since I get there \"early\" parking wasnt that bad but if you wearing them heels, hope you work them.  Attire Girls dress up here. It is like the Grand and you will see girls in tight dresses and heels and full on hair and makeup. Man brings me back to me younger years haha. Guys all dress the same and I bet they enforce the no sneaker whatever policy. It gets hot in there when you dance so dress skimpy I suppose. They have a coat check and I believe it is free. If not, well pay for it or have fun holding it.  Crowd Yes the crowd is practically all Asian. I am totally fine with that haha. Actually all the dudes look the same. The classic spiky hair tall face. I did feel like a grandma since they seem like they just turned 21. I swear if you are a girl and is older than 25, you will feel like a massive cougar and you shouldnt be here. Luckily I am 24 and I am still hip with it and can hang with these kids. No but seriously, dont come here if you already feel oldl. The dudes look young and are probably older but I saw so many young scrawny faces haha  Music Ok so I got in around 10:45 and I had a good 45 minutes of pure awesome legit ass music. They were playing my hip hop with Lil Jon and Chris Brown Loyal. Man I was soooo damn happy I couldnt believe this place was doing it for me. I knew that it would play edm so this was a pleasant surprise. Then when 11:30 came on, my face died and it was edm the rest of the night. A few rare times they remixed a song I knew but the night of music could not be salvaged. It is ok, it was time for me to go home anyway haha.  Club So it is pretty small in here. I expected it to be bigger but I guess the smaller it is, the better so it looks packed and poppin. When you enter, there is a bar with tables but most of the time they are empty since no one gets service. I ended up sitting here throughout the night and if they kicked me out, I sat right back in cuz grandma was tired. There is another small bar on the right of the dance floor. The floor is small and you will see a repeat of the dudes. You can go upstairs where there are more tables and a bar. You will also see a line of creeper dudes looking down and spying on their prey. Overall the place looks nice and it is just fun to dress up and have fun. People dont creep here as much I dont believe so that's cool. Im not sure if I would come back since I just wanted to experience it.",

I like the layout a lot, it flows well. \u00a0When you first come it, it feels like a lounge. \u00a0A bar awaits you to the right as you walk in and there are couches set up to the left. \u00a0If you want to just hangout and enjoy the bar, you can do that hear. \u00a0Upstairs is table service. \u00a0In the middle there is a hallway that takes you the back room, where the action is. \u00a0  The dance floor is a decent sized in an open space so it feels roomy, unlike other clubs in SF. VIP tables surround the dance floor with one bar the left. \u00a0A large LED screen is directly in front of you over the DJ. \u00a0The sound system is good, and they have lights, lasers, confetti drops, foam drops, the works... \u00a0Music is top 40, so not too EDM heavy, and not too Gangsta, just right.   Bottle service is always fun and honestly they do it right here, well other than the high bottle prices...even for SF standards, over $800 for 2 bottles of Jameson, liter size. \u00a0  It is the HOT SPOT right now and its been pretty packed. \u00a0Hopefully they can maintain this buzz until the actually really open! haha",

I like the set up, and the ambiance of the place. There is a second level with a bar and tables for table service, and the entrance area also consist of a bar with a small seating area with nice couches and table service.  The bad part is the ratio is really bad. \u00a0I believe there's probably seven guys for every one gal. \u00a0OMG. \u00a0So, if you're a gal seeking attention, and want to meet a ton of guys with testosterone raging, then you have come to the right place. \u00a0If you're a girl, you will feel on top of the world here... regardless of your size and physique. \u00a0  The music started off a bit slow in the beginning. \u00a0It was hip hop and lounge music... which is fine. \u00a0Then the EDM stuff starts off at around midnight just when everybody is drunk. \u00a0The good thing good about Origin is the music stops at 2am, compared to other places that stops at 1:30am.  As usual, you will see a bunch of knuckle heads, and angry drunks as the night progresses. Boys will be boys pretending to be on top of the world, and girls pretending to be beauty queens will seek all the attention they can get.   What a comic strip!

We had to argue for awhile before they went back and checked our table for what we actually ordered. Not sure if this was an intentional mix up to trick drunk patrons or if it was an honest $600 mistake...but either way it seems pretty irresponsible and unacceptable to me. Especially with the hard time they were giving us about getting an itemized receipt, and then arguing with us about what we ordered.

You're something special, and I'll keep loving you no matter what.   Origin is half lounge, half dance club, and 100% asian paradise. This is my weekend mecca, where I drag my friends to the line at 10:00 to get through free at 10:30 just so I can fist pump to some EDM. The first half of the club has some nice couches, and a fireplace where people can chill. The next half of the club is a big dance floor, with a second level for more table service. The bartenders are pretty awesome too, always hooking it up with strong drinks and are super quick getting the drinks out. I don't necessarily remember paying more for drinks here than other clubs in SF.   I'm really not sure why people don't like this place, I think it's because of the wanna-be Vegas vibe that it gives off. My only complaints are that the place is become too popular, which means that I have to wait longer in line to get in, and that because it's getting more popular, it attracts more and more guys. Whatever, I still have fun.",

Now, onto my favorite part -the music! I'm here for the music and to dance and Origin, in my opinion, plays the kind of stuff that I want to groove to. It's a mix of edm and hip hop, which are two of my favorite genres! And what makes this place even better is getting in for free with being on the guest list! It can't get any better than this =)",

    "review_text": "I go clubbing in Sacramento too much and I came to SF looking to have a good time with old friends, and I was very disappointing with my experience at Origin.  I had high expectations for this place, but it's pretty mediocre. First off, the crowd is not diverse whatsoever, it's literally ALL ASIANS, most of them being FOBs to no disrespect. The crowd just sucks. I got there at 10 which is pretty early, but the guest list closes a 1030, so I didn't want to have to pay for this club and I'm glad I didn't. There was nobody here at 10pm on a Friday, the weekend after finals. I'e girld thought I'd allow this place some time to fill up a little bit, but people didn't start getting here till midnight, and same goes to the dance floor, \u00a0no one starting dancing till 12.  The girls. They don't dance. They just like stay in their group of 3-5 and just bob up and down. Girls here are super lame. I was talking to this girl for like 30 min, she was feelin me, I asked her to dance. She said she didn't know how to dance, #dealbreaker, and to my credit although I was drunk I didn't see her on the dance floor for the night (update for my fans)  The venue. Compared to most clubs, this place is pretty small. You walk in, there's a small lounge area with couches, then a hallway with the bathrooms that leads to the dance floor. It's a simple setup, but it's just too small for me. There's a upstairs overlooking the dance floor that is small and has booths only, for the chumps that wanna waste their money on that. There's a small outside area where you can smoke which is the same area of the guest list line there may not even be space.  The music, was actually super poppin. They had a mix of EDM as well hip hop, both the DJs were really great. If it weren't for the crowd, I would possibly come here all the time. For example, that \"i'm in love with the coco\" song, he just played that part of the song because the rest of it is bad. And then he transitioned to some EDM.   2/5, #notgoodenoughtocomeback",

This venue may look pretty nice as you walk in but damn it is pretty small on the dance floor. \u00a0$20 to get in after 10:30? hmmm I def don't think this was worth it. \u00a0  I liked that there was a lot of seatings at the front next to the brightly lit bar. \u00a0 We walked with the crowd down this small hallway that led us to the dance floor. \u00a0OMG it was like crazy packed... like I would get shoved because people were trying to get to the other side. \u00a0Maybe it's been a while since I've been to the club but I thought there should be more moving room. \u00a0There was also a big bar area on the left of the dance area so that is nice to not have to go to the front again. \u00a0  I was able to just walk upstairs, I guess it wasn't just VIP? \u00a0Or they just dont care, but that was a breather, not having as many people upstairs. \u00a0Got boring, went back down. \u00a0There's just too many guys at this club. I mean that would be great if you are looking for one.  I was able to dance on top of a box next to the dj, woulda been cool if they got more of these, although, keep in mind, you shouldn't go up if you are drunk as hell. This girl fell right next to me.  Likes: -Pretty - lots of seats (although I hardly sat) - nice brightly lit bathroom with lots of mirrors  Dislikes: - Pricey - Too crowded - Too many guys - Dj/song sucked..idk what he was playing but I heard the same song like 3 times...-_- really now, you're out of songs already?

I looked at other reviews where they said they played 100% EDM after midnight but that was not true. Perhaps it was NYE's DJ, but he was great, he mixed hip hop and EDM non stop. This was one of the best club nights I've had where every song was good. And I was sober btw.  Coat check: $5? Come on, that's just mean, but still, supply and demand baby.  Decor/Size: The entire dance floor was a little small for NYE, but that's expected, I'm sure it wouldn't be so crowded on a normal night. The 2nd floor area seems to be a hangout area as there isn't really much room to dance. Caution: The glass+metal frame fence seems sketchy, don't twerk on it ladies.  Crowd: If you don't like Asians or you'd prefer a club filled with caucasians and blacks, you've come to the wrong neighborhood. But for my NYE expereince, it was about 20% caucasian with maybe 5% black/indian/middle eastern  The floor: This is why I'm rating this place 3 stars. While dancing on the 2nd floor I noticed parts of the floor were made of this bubbly and shiny white surface. and what do you know? It's slippery, like REALLY slippery. I didn't fall, but I slipped and almost did. I did see another person fall though. If you look at the club's entrance to the dance floor, you'll see it is covered with floor mats. Why? Because under it is the same material. The club knows this is a problem but has not yet put out the money to fix the problem. I really wanted to give this place 2 stars to grab their attention but because everything else was great, here's 3 stars.  Drink prices: $14 for patron shots, that is all I got that night",

    "review_text": "I went here last night (Sat, 10/18) and I must admit that I had low expectations. San Francisco clubbing generally disappoints me - Booty SF, The Grand, etc. I got there around 10pm and there was already a HUGE long line stretching around the side of the building. Sorry, are we at XS or Hakkasan in Vegas?? Nope, actually we are in the Fillmore on a semi sketch block...anyway....  Luckily our group had a table so we only waited outside about 30 minutes before getting in without cover. I'm not sure if this place is worth it for a $20 cover as I believe girls have to pay that in addition to guys. The guest list gets in free before 10:30 but that means you probably need to be in line at least by 9:30. My backup plan for the evening was to go to 1300 Fillmore just down the block for some cocktails.  Once I got inside I was pleasantly surprised - the interior is really nice and trendy and more reminiscent of something you'd see in Vegas versus anything in SF. There are A LOT of tables in here both on the upper and lower floor. Despite the huge line outside the inside wasn't that crowded minus the dance floor. The DJ was ok, nothing special...not sure if they have better DJs on other days.   Overall, this was definitely one of the classier groups of people I've seen in SF. All the girls were dressed up nice in clubbing dresses; I saw very few people dressed inappropriately. And then there was a sea of guys in light blue button up shirts. I think they enforce some sort of a dress code so no sneakers or hoodies allowed.   And, oh yeah, this is definitely an Asian club so if you aren't Asian under age 28 or with Asians you'll probably feel just a tad out of place.",

The dancefloor was small and hardly contained any dancing. The ratio wasn't bad but the crowd was just awful. As a fellow asian, this place was 95% asian and you know what we're really good at? Pushing and shoving. I had an awkward time, the DJ music selection was pretty poor, he just played Top 40 which doesn't always translate to dance-able music. No, playing the theme song to fresh prince of bel air was not a good idea. After midnight, they switch it up to EDM but the crowd remained motionless for the most part. My friend got bottle service and his table was at the front of the club where there is no dancing or view of the DJ booth and light fixtures. Pretty lame. The club caters to the bottle service customers but even so, they do a poor job. So I also made the mistake of leaving the club before I intended - I assumed I could get back in because I had a stamp on my wrist. Nope, the stamp on your wrist just means that you paid to get in.

You should pre-game or go bar-hopping in the Fillmore beforehand if you don't wanna spend a ton of \u00a0money on some dranks.  The first two hours played top hip-hop songs and then some good ol' edm bangers like Calvin Harris, Alesso, etc. The crowd is pretty Asian, it was a lot of guys the night I went, they all came outta nowhere. 80% Asian crowd, \u00a0I would say. If that's your type, you would be in le heaven. \u00a0It gets pretty crowded later through the night that makes it a little harder to walk/dance through the dance floor.

Yes, the bouncers will embarrass you if you try to cut the line even if you step out for a few seconds.  The club itself is small but there's an upstairs so it doesn't get too crazy. I love the lounge area, there's ample seating for you and your friends to chill and sip on your drinks with your pinkys up. The dance floor is remeniscent of The Grand, sort of a circular layout with the the upstairs balcony overview of the crowd.   My not so favorite feature of this club is the tile flooring upstairs for the bottle service area. Extremely slippery especially since spilled drinks and party fouls bound to happen. So all you ladies in those 5 inches heels, be warned!   The crowd is pretty chill, of course mostly asian pursuassion, and plethora of guys. All the single ladies, now put your hands up!

At the end, there is some foam or confetti falling down as you dance. pretty cool.  The crowd: pretty chill 20 somethings and few in their early 30s? Not too many creepers.

This is just so they can charge you cover 3) If you are in line and in the front by the door and it's 10:25, don't expect to get in, they will keep you out till 10:30 and you will have to pay $20  4) I went in to pay, they required an ID to use the ATM so you don't sneak in, I paid got my stamp and the guy had no interest in giving me my ID back, instead was just ignoring me the whole time 5) Bottles are over-priced but the thing that gets you even more mad is that you don't have your own space, instead you get a little corner and they rush you to leave the table (i thought bottle service is all night?) so it's open area, 2 hours, a bottle of cheap vodka, $600-$800 and perks of being bugged to leave 6) One male and one female bathroom downstairs  7) This place is owned by the same owners as grand (dying now) and they close the line at like 11:30 so people cant get in anymore whether you are paying or on guestlist, so they send you off to grand to help their other businesss...shady! 8) Security guys are on a power trip, thinking they can anything. They don't let you in, and they DONT LET YOU OUT! When you try to leave ,they put you in a line and let you out one by one. WTF, I want to leave, let me out!  9) Alcohol is pricey but its a club, nothing different.   Anyways,  I want to go on, but because this can go on forever...I will let you decide whether you want to go. This place is a joke. If you read this and you are trying to find another place to go to replace the usual Sloane, Raven, Grand, Temple, etc. I'd suggest going back to your original places, because this is not the place to go to.

After you're in -- it's smooth drinking from there on. The venue itself is clean, new and has that Vegas feel. The best thing about this place is the mix of hip-hop and EDM. It's a healthy alternative between full blown EDC and ghetto ass grabbing pervert dancing (aka Sloane) scenes.   Drinks are medium priced ($10) but well worth the alcohol content. There are two bars and tons of bottle service. For now, this place is classy enough for most -- I just hope it doesn't turn into too trashy (as most nightclubs in SF do).",

First off......ridiculously long lines. Second.......rude ass bouncers. Third....... $20 cover which you'd most likely have to pay because you won't make the glist. Fourth........ that $20 spent on mediocre EDM/Top 40 shit. Fifth......... even the bathroom line is pretty crazy. etc.............  One thing that was nice though was fast drink service...but other than that, it's all pretty negative.",

    "review_text": "I was here yesterday at their opening night hosted by MetroWize.   I loved it. The design was modern/upscale. Drinks were good, standard club prices, and the music was a variety of top hits and edm.  Right when you walk in there's a full bar and a couch area. There is a small hallway that leads you to the dancefloor which is pretty spacious. The bathroom is located in that hallway and its pretty small, so I am expecting a lot of crowding around that area.  I believe there is a second floor, although I did not make it there for various reasons....  Hopefully this club will bring a lot of business to the restaurants around the area! There is a korean place right in front (opens late) , and safeway, panda express and subway are a couple blocks away ( although they close pretty early).  Surrounding area: no parking, but its ok ! no drinking and driving please. \u00a0I dont recommend walking past geary and fillmore near the 22 bus stop. It can get pretty dangerous, and if you are thinking about the McDonalds near by... I am telling you now its a terrible idea. The bf walked past a gun shooting the other day.. imagine how it can get at night.",

Arrived around 9:50p and wait to get in was 5 minutes and guestlist = free admission. \u00a0Hecka awesome. \u00a0Ed the bartender gave me a round of free shots when I got to the empty bar. Freaking awesome. \u00a0The dance floor was spacious. \u00a0Rediculously awesome. \u00a0Bathroom line was never long. \u00a0Unbelievably awesome. \u00a0  Crowd was like 95% Asian. \u00a0In my opinion, not so awesome. \u00a0However, I brought my own white boy to throw in the mix just to diversify the party goers.  A previous review I read said there were a lot of seating. \u00a0True,but they are reserved for bottle service only.  Kudos for having fun at this place!",

    "review_text": "Disclaimer: This is my first time writing a review for a club! \u00a0It probably won't be as nice and flowy as my food reviews, but fragmented like all the half-memories. \u00a0Jk, I remember enough to write a legit review.  Tip: Get there early!!! \u00a0The line is super long and hardly moves at all. \u00a0We got there around 10 and had to pay cover, $20 cash only.   Music: Mostly EDM, none of those super girly pop songs :D  Space: Tiny dance floor, though I've been in more packed discomfort at the Grand before. \u00a0There's a pretty cool staircase to an upstairs area, but everyone up there looks like lame spectators when you're on the dance floor. \u00a0  Ambiance: I am not a fan of their soap bubbles and confetti because the soap sticks to your hair and it makes the confetti stick too, so everyone always ends up looking kind of ridiculous after these showers. \u00a0The lighting is good, with lots of strobe lights and color, though sometimes it's a bit too bright (and you know, everyone always looks better in shadowy lighting)  Crowd: Interesting that it's right next to J-town and close to a Panda Express--crowd is very Asian, fairly good-looking, creepers are neither touchy nor tenacious (they go away if you ignore them; no need to run away and bury yourself in your group of friends)  Dranks: It's still very noisy at the bar area, but the drinks are good. \u00a0For the high-dose alcohol, I'm sure it was worth whatever it cost.  Conclusion: Not bad! \u00a0Recommended if you like Asian people and don't mind brushing off the soap and static-y confetti.",

Line was pretty long, but we managed to get in after waiting about 10 min since we were in a special line.  $20 cover, and the drinks were somewhat pricey (around $13 for a cocktail). Music was largely EDM, and the restroom lines weren't too long. Way too many people on the dance floor though.",
