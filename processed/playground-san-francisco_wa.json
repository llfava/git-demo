If you are to come here, either come super early before the crowd comes or book a karaoke room upstairs. There have been times where my friends and I waited for more than an hour for a table. When people start drinking, they usually don't want to leave.   When you finally do get a table, first thing you should do to start off your night is by ordering rounds of soju and beer. Then when you slowly get hungry as the night progresses, take a look at their food options. It will look 100x yummier, I promise. Just be careful and push away the impulse to order the whole menu.   Some things I recommend ordering - 1. Kimchi Fried Rice - A MUST. It comes out on a sizzling platter too!  2. YANGYUM CHICKEN - Fried chicken on a whole new level.  3. La Bokki - Ramen AND rice cakes? Yes please!  2-3 hours of drinking and eating, and STILL want to stay? Book a karaoke room upstairs and sing the night away...with more drinking of course..... ;]  RECIPE OF A GOOD... NO, GREAT... NIGHT",

I saw Playground featured on Check Please and thought that it looked like an awesome place to celebrate my graduation so, on a whim, I decided to have my party there. Ehhh.  The plan was for us (20 of us total) to have dinner, and then enjoy 2 hours in one of their private karaoke rooms. We ordered a ton of food which was all average quality at best. Their banchan was limited and boring. The corn and cheese appetizer reminded me of something you would eat if you were super broke and were scraping up random things in the kitchen in hopes of creating a meal. I understand that this is a karaoke joint, and that I shouldn't have expected authentic, delicious Korean food but simply put, most dishes were flavorless and bland.  After an unsatisfying (but reasonably priced) dinner we headed upstairs for 2 hours in their larger sized private karaoke room. Although the TV was small and outdated (I mean it's 2011, why no flat screen?), the room was huge and comfortable which was nice. I found their song choices to be seriously limited which was a disappointment. None of the songs I had secretly practiced at home the week beforehand were available. Boo.  The biggest disappointment however came when the bill for our karaoke room was presented. They charged us for an extra hour in the room because we were there 15 minutes after we were supposed to depart. The kicker: they didn't even bring us our bill until then!  Based on my experience I would NOT go back. With authentic Korean food available around the corner and plenty of karaoke bars in town why would I?",

The four stars are not necessarily for the food exactly, but for the experience. I probably shouldn't even being rating Korean food since I don't really know what good Korean food by any standard. We got some chicken wings, seafood pancakes, and the big soup consisting of like 20 things including tofu, hot dogs, spam, ramen noodles, rice cakes and I don't know what else. It was $30 for the whole thing, but 5 of us didn't come close to eating all of it (with all our other food) and it was pretty good, although i can't believe I was eating a soup with hot dog, spam, and ramen. I feel like I should have been drunk first, not getting drunk at the same time as eating it.   As far as drinks, we got 5 small pitchers of soju (buy 4, get 1 free) - lychee, yogurt, strawberry, mango, and pineapple. Yum! Also, enjoyed some yung ju(?) shots - some combination of a shot of coke, a shot of soju and beer like a bomb. It's fun and not the worst tasting thing.  Good times at Playground. Servers are great too - served our soup for us and mixed it up at the table.",

Playground is a super cool spot with a few private rooms for karaoke. It's open until 2 Thursday-Saturday and is a great spot to throw back a few drinks and exercise those vocal chords! One of the great things about Playground is that they serve alcohol in the rooms (unlike other places like Do Re Mi who disallow alcohol). They have a phone in the room for you to call down and order both food and drinks (and the occasional cup of water)!!  As for their food, I've only had it while in the karaoke rooms, but they do have full service dining. They offer Korean/American food. The chicken wings were pretty good (but somewhat pricey), potstickers were pretty standard. The owner of the place is a super cute Korean who sometimes works behind the bar. She was soo fun and even took a couple of shots with us :)  5 stars for fun and good times, +1 star for having \"A Whole New World\" (Aladdin), -1 star for not having \"Part of Your World\" (Little Mermaid) nor \"Blister in the Sun\" (Violent Femmes), -1 star for making me spend a pretty penny (several hours in the karaoke room gets a tad pricey).",

The atmospher of this place was pretty boring and bland. \u00a0The music was on ultra low the tv's were non-functional, the decore was pretty sad and they use cheap plastic chairs and tables from IKEA. \u00a0 When we finally were seated down, it took another 10+mins and a lot of flagging down waiters/waitresses to take our order. \u00a0 The drinks came out pretty fast; however, the Flavor Soju we ordered had no taste of SOJU at all. \u00a0In addition, they filled the pitcher of Flavor Soju with lots of ice, which really watered the flavorless Soju even more down. We finally got our food and it wasn't anything specatcular honestly, probably couold have gotten better tasting food from Denny's right below and at a more resonable price. Due to the lack of service and crappy drinks, we deciede to ask for the bill, but this was no easy task. \u00a0The waiters/waitresses would just keep passing by our tables, telling us they would come right back for about 10+mins. \u00a0I finally got annoyed and just yelled out \"CHECK PLEASE\" and from the tone of my voice, they finally reazlied I wasn't going to wait any longer. When we got our check, surley enough they MESSED UP ON THE BILL. \u00a0There were items on the bill that we didn't order and we were charged for it. \u00a0So I advise anyone who decides to go to this abysmal place, review your BILL!!! \u00a0Sucks that tip was included for the size of our party, because they DO NOT DESERVE A DIME!  In conclusion, if you want: 1) Flavorless Soju 2) Seat on plastic chairs 3) Slow service 4) High Prices 5) Boring atmospher 6) Chance of being ripped off Then Playground is for you!",

Also, it's the same generic videos playing in the background, which can get kind of annoying. Food was also good, and they have a phone where you can call down your orders. Service was prompt and the wait staff was all very friendly. No complaints in that department. Yogurt soju is a must, and they have a lot of flavors.   Finally, the price. They have a food/drink minimum for the rooms ($25pp), so we had to order a lot more bottles of beer and yogurt soju to meet our minimum.

While the music books don't have all the songs (and, I will grant you, they get sticky), sometimes you can search by artist or song title and find it, even if it's not in the book!  Yogurt soju is, of course, good (a little weak) and no one has complained about the other drinks.

Great place to do karaoke. \u00a0It seems a little sketch at first, because the karaoke rooms (only 3) are all tucked away in what would be the attic of the building, and away from the restaurant/bar area downstairs. \u00a0But once you get past that part, the rooms are pretty good! \u00a0A little musty/barf smelling when we first walked in, but then our noses adapted, and everything was great from then on.  Totally reasonable prices for karaoke - $30 per hour, plus a $10 min per person (but more if you stay longer than 2 hours). \u00a0They have a pretty good selection of songs, and the service is very good. \u00a0Soju was delicious, but not too strong.  I thought the owner lady was fantastic. \u00a0Super friendly staff - nice place! \u00a0Now if I could only get over the fact that I felt like an old hag when I was there... definitely more for the younger crowd!

For the price, I expect more. \u00a0I mean come on... how do you mess up frozen yogurt (which comes sprinkled with fruity pebbles ... at least that's what I think that was). \u00a0And thank you for the fried platter, which probably came from the frozen food aisle.   As a bar, I suppose its okay if all you are really here for is soju and korean beer but that's pretty much all. \u00a0The service, quite frankly, is the worst and why I am giving this place one star. \u00a0Come here if you are looking for inattentive and rude service (at least my experience on this particular night). \u00a0I am surprised by the number of good reviews here and maybe I'm in the minority. \u00a0But I have rarely come out of a restaurant so displeased. \u00a0  Oh yeah, the owners should look into cleaning the ladies' room a bit more thoroughly. \u00a0It's gross especially since food is being served here (at the restaurant I mean.... obviously not in the bathroom! What I'm trying to convey here and it may be because I'm not a writer is \u00a0that this is an eating establishment and cleanliness is important to me!). Then again, maybe they can get away with these bathrooms because this place can be considered more of a bar.  will not be recommending this place to anyone who asks me where they can get korean food in the city.

Completely not possible here at the Playground because everything is overpriced! Since when does a plate of dumplings (the cheapest thing on the menu) end up being almost $10?? After getting settled in and over how much everything cost we proceeded to try and get the waitresses attention for a good 10 minutes. Then...we waited a longass time to get our food which was served in 10 minute increments! First came the Jiajiang noodles (pretty standard, not bad), then the Soondoobu (GROSS and unsatisfying!), then the chicken (ok). Ugh.   In a horrible mood I hoped that the large yogurt soju and OB beer would save the day but although the yogurt soju was good it could not redeem this extremely disappointing experience.   Sorry Playground...the next time I have that yearning for the Korean bar experience I will have to resort back to the East Bay where they do it right.",

The food looked yummy, the waitstaff looked friendly and so my bf and I came here late one night after work.   It was totally not what it looked like on TV. The staff was friendly, but no where to be found. I think the waiter and waitress were overwhelmed at how busy it was. There were people waiting, empty tables not cleared and people waving the staff down to get service.  dark, dim with blue neon lights, tv screens with Korean Pop and blasting the latest R&amp;B/Rap .. not too loud so conversations can carry. People were obviously smoking in the karaoke rooms above so it stank like cigarettes and my coat, purse, hair and clothes stank like cigarettes when we left.   The food is great though. I wish I came with more people so we could have tried more. Fried Chicken Wings with Special Sauce - Cripy, juicy, meaty, nice salad on the side.. yum! BiBimBap in the Stone Bowl - It was yum, but I've had better. Maybe the stone wasn't hot enough, the rice didn't crisp up as much as I would have liked it, but the ingredients were fresh. Jajangmyeon - yummy! had the beef and potato instead of the seafood. authentic, but I think the one downstairs, down the block at San Wang is better.  thumbs up: food, portions, good for a fun group thumbs down: slow service, cigarettes",

The fried plate of fries, mozzarella sticks and nuggets was devoured quickly. Bottle service is actually pretty reasonable, and the waiters are great as well!

I mean don't go there in your evening gown, ladies) and the food is good, alcohol abundant and the music is nice. \u00a0 It's very.... blue. \u00a0The lighting is blue... and well, it's very blue.  The menu is quite expansive and has something to please everyone. \u00a0For those not familiar with Korean food, you will have trouble figuring out what's what - but try something different from the regular Korean dishes like Bulgogi and other typical stuff. \u00a0That stuff, you can always have somewhere else that is known for those particular dishes.  At Playground, you get to eat other foods that are usually eaten in Korea but with a twist of some sort. \u00a0For instance, their fried chicken is extremely tasty - and fried to perfection, no grease, just all hot and juicy. \u00a0It accompanies a beer like none other. \u00a0They also serve this unusual variation of the Chinese/Korean \"Jja jang Myun\" - - on a plate. \u00a0This one is rather spicy due to the jalapenos that grace the plate, so if you are prone to running for the bathroom or panting like a dog at the first hint of hot peppers - - this might not be for you. \u00a0I happen to be someone who has yet to encounter anything remotely \"TOO SPICY\" - so bear that in mind. \u00a0Their \"al jjigae\", also quite spicy, was very good. \u00a0I've also had a variety of other foods while there, though I can't remember them right now - and all have been good or better. \u00a0And we can't forget the corn cheese or cheese corn - whatever it's called. \u00a0A sizzling platter of corn bathed in butter, and covered in cheddar cheese... it's a small heart attack on a plate, and greasy as anything gets but quite yummy. \u00a0As I always say - you're eating out, get over your diet. \u00a0\"Diet who?\"  I have not tried everything yet since they reopened - but give me a few months... I am there a lot, it seems.  Their alcohol choices are great. \u00a0They have a full bar as well as a wide variety of sojus and beers. \u00a0  This is a nice place for casual dates, gatherings with friends, or just hanging out on any given night of the week. You can go to eat, drink a little or enough to be carried out. \u00a0Be careful with that fruity mixed soju stuff - - it can kill you if you begin to believe you're sipping on juice.  They are opened late on weekends (until 2 AM) and I believe they close at varying times on certain weekdays. \u00a0Their hours are posted on the door... go look, don't ask me. And when you're there - check out that fried chicken, I tell you. \u00a0Good stuff!",

We also ordered a couple bottles of flavored soju. All the flavors that we tried were good! Definitely coming back!",

Overall, pretty good fun. They offer alcohol as well (in the lounge downstairs). YOu may also use a phone to order food (the phone is inside the karaoke rooms).  they have decent selection of korean/english songs, some chinese/tagalog/japanese songs. i don't like pressing the buttons to select songs though, I wish some day they will make it all computerized.   the corn/cheese thing was pretty good, it is free but u need to ask for it.",

Their dukbooki ramen was NOT good. The sauce was very orange and the ramen tasted like Maruchan cooked and plopped into orange spicy sauce. Nonononoo. I understand ramen isn't very fancy to begin with, but this place --- Just no.  I've had my fair share of good yogurt soju from Vegas, San Diego, along with Toyose added to the list. This place was WAY too sweet. They used syrup to mix their drinks. The green apple tastes exactly like Midori, yet sickenly sweeter. The yogurt soju was missing the slight carbonated Sprite taste which is definitely necessary in the recipe. Orange soju, pineapple soju, peach soju, strawberry... That's half the list and none was up to par.   I guess the only part I liked was the fact they accomnodated 15 of us. The waitress looked pissed most of the night, but the waiters were quick and friendly. I also enjoyed the Korean music videos.  Overall, no. I'm going back to Toyose for strawberry soju or aloe soju with real fruit bits in it. Delish!",

I'm assuming bc after we ordered a Glen Livet neat and a bitters and soda he was befuddled by attempting to punch in the order meanwhile my dry mouth was becoming more and more thirsty. We had to point out the Glen Livet 12 (no big deal), he was looking for bitters on the spirits shelf, and when it proved too challenging I said a 'club soda' w/lime and the Glen Livet came in a shot glass.  Poor guy was so nervous or had been recently yelled at by someone he was so skittish and we just wanted a drink. Relax, buddy you're at a bar. Try, \"Hey guys how are you?\" while throwing down 2 napkins in front of us w/a smile. Get our drinks (When you're serving you want to get their order in first, but we were 2 of 3 ppl at the bar and #3 had his beer -there is no one else around)  I hope to come back to experience great food, hot chicks and more relaxed bartender who has been properly trained in customer service.

    "review_text": "How do I loathe thee? Let me list the ways.  Starting with service. When one walks into a business, it's always nice to be greeted with a semblance of hospitality or at the very least courtesy. Neither one was found when my friends and I came in after we reserved a private room for karaoke. We were greeted instead by a snarky host (who obviously would rather not be there. ) Before we even got situated we were asked to sign a contract. Say what? A contract? All I wanted to do was sing, not sign my life away. Be forewarned, that when you agree to use the private room you're guaranteed to spend more than $30. It's not enough to pay for the room at $30/hr, you also have to spend $20 PER PERSON ON TOP OF THE ROOM RATE. My friends and I were naive enough to assume that the contract meant $20 minimum on food and drink was meant for the group. Oh no, we were greatly mistaken.   Let's talk about the reason we even went to this place: the karaoke. If you came here expecting karaoke with the background vocals to diffuse the flaws in your singing voice, then hit the road Jack because you're not gonna find that here. Everyone's going to hear the nuances of your lovely (or not so lovely singing voice) so drink up liquid courage before you take center stage. If you don't speak a lick of Korean, then the song choices are cut to about 1/3 of the entire library of songs. From the 8 or so song books found, only 3 of them had English songs in them. Finally, be warned about the oh so sticky pages. If we're paying more than $30, the least we can expect is cleanliness. Sheesh. Sure they have a handful of top 40 hits, and a sprinkling of alternative and some oldies here and there, but after 2 hours it all sounds a bit redundant.   Now for the food. My friends and I ordered the standard munchies like garlic fries, popcorn chicken, and pot stickers. Although they weren't horrendous, they weren't spectacular either. I can get better versions of the aforementioned munchies for a fraction of the price at a local boba place. The thing that really got my blood boiling was the $20 fruit platter. $20 for a fruit platter isn't all that ridiculous for a restaurant you say? Well if ALL THE FRUITS WERE FROM A CAN, then yeah it is. It really fucking is. The least they could have done was cut a couple of fresh oranges or throw a handful of grapes in there. But no, that might have been too much effort. The only saving grace was the soju. I recommend the yogurt and lychee ones. Can the soju compensate for all that was lacking? No, not by a stretch.   My friends and I ended up spending $36 each for three hours, six appetizers, and four rounds of soju (two small and two large.) We ended up paying for only 2 hours because of the misunderstanding with the food and drink minimum fee. Still, there was a disparity from what we were expecting from other people's reviews and what we actually got.   So if you want a grand little time with your friends while singing some tunes and sipping some soju, look a little bit harder. I can't imagine a worse experience than what my friends and I had.",

They offer soju cocktails in a good variety of flavors in 2 sizes, small ($14) or large ($25), but what stands them apart is a fully stocked bar that has it's own area and seating if you just want a drink. Yes you can mix! Soju + beer + wine + vodka + whiskey + gin + etc... = A GREAT (UN)FORGETTABLE NIGHT!!!HAHA if you catch my drift.  They also have karaoke up stairs (you can order drinks and food while singing your heart out) can this night get even better?! (~$30/hr FYI, and I recommend calling in advance to reserve a room) I've only been in the karaoke rooms once, I usually go for the tables.  Yes it can! Their food is pretty good, I would rate them 3-4 stars. What's memorable is their cheesy corn and potato salad banchan and OMG IT'S FREE?! They also offer a good variety of dishes to go with your alcohol like korean style fried chicken (perfect drunk food), stew pots (great for sharing), noodle dishes, rice cakes, your typical korean dishes, etc. And the more you drink the better the food tastes!   All their dishes range from $10-$20. Expect to spend around $20-50 (on the pricier side for me).  Service was ok. Don't expect them to stop by your table and ask how you're doing. It's more of the waving down kind of service. But they respond quickly.  They usually play kpop on a giant projector and on multiple tvs. Distracting for me because my eyes are always drawn to a TV screen no matter what is on.  Parking shouldn't be too bad to find. But if all else fails, there's a garage that closes late (If I remember correctly, it's only $1/hr :O Does that even exist in SF?!)  I used to come here more often when I lived down the street. But now I live closer to other spots like Toyose and the Spot. But I miss that cheesy corn. :( Maybe it's time to return.",

You can still gaze dreamily though like the true Asian (or non-Asian) fan you know you are.  The drinks are okay priced but the appetizers and food are totally overpriced for what you get. Nonetheless at 1am you are hungry and you will pay for it. But beware! Last time I ordered a dish and asked for \"very mild spicy please\", and what came was this dark red covered dish. I was like \"What? Mild spicy my arse. There is no way anyone could think this is mild spicy.\" Even our Korean friend was like \"Whoa, that's kinda spicy.\" You serious? The only way to even make this thing edible was to ask for a cup of water and then wash off the sauce in the cup of water. It was a cup of red after like 2 seconds. Wow. Then I asked the waiter, and he goes to another waiter, probably the head waiter, and then he comes and goes like \"That's mild spicy\", then he walks away. The only saving grace here is that at the end the head waiter guy brought us some sweet, cold yogurt right before we paid. Great. Not really good customer service, but at least he gave us some type of compensation...if only he had apologized or something. Normally places will offer to take it away or waive it from the bill if they prepare it wrong, but nothing here. So lesson learned, don't order food here unless you want some atomic red goodness that burns the taste buds straight off your tongue.   UNLESS, it is happy hour (5-7pm everyday), where well drinks, beer, soju, soju cocktails, and appetizers are 50% off. Then it's semi-worth it to order appetizers and maybe some soju. ~$5-8 per appetizer and $12-14 for delicious soju cocktails. The soju cocktails are pretty much why I'm giving this place 3 stars. Get the soju cocktails.   Bottom line: 1) Come during happy hour 2) Get (any of) the soju cocktails 3) The sweet potato fries are not what American's think of as sweet potato fries. They are more like skinny sweet potato chips (maybe 1/4 inch wide by 2-3 inches long each and 2 mm thick) that have powdered sugar sprinkled over them. They aren't bad, but just warning you that they aren't what most people would normally expect. 4) Don't expect fast service or even food being prepared to the way you ask, unless maybe if you speak the native language, but even then I don't know.",

My friends were a bit anxious and we proceeded to walk in as the clock hit 5:00pm.  First impression, this place looks cool. The ceilings are high and they have large windows that let in natural light; the cool part about this is that the place showed a blue-ish hue that made the atmosphere really relaxing. There were multiple TVs on the walls so it wasn't too difficult to watch the game.   Anyways, after my group barged in, I apologized to our server, but he didn't seem to mind in the slightest. He gave us a few menus but the only thing that we looked at was happy hour menu. Oh man, everything was pretty cheap (especially if you split with 8 people). We started with an order of popcorn chicken, 2 bottles of soju, and a lychee ice. The food came out relatively quickly and it came in a pretty large portion. Just a heads up, I thought the lychee ice would be a drink, but it's literally a good amount of lychees laying on a bed of ice.   Everything tasted really good so we ordered 2 more orders of popcorn chicken and a plate of dumplings. At this point, I had sobered up, but the rest of my friends were ready to KO. Strangely, since my friends were so quiet, I could tell that the other patrons in this place were also quiet. I thought this was a little strange, but nobody complained that we were a little loud when we entered.  Overall, if I knew that this place existed, I would come here instead of bottomless mimosas. You can get full and drunk for such a low price here! Oh and the service is really chill and helpful",

It was my first Korean BBQ experience, and I was impressed with the different delicious sides that come with the meal -- (can only remember a few. forgive me, for I am not too familiar with Korean cuisine) creamed corn, spicy vegetables, etc.. Everything was fresh and good, but the only part of the meal that kinda let me down was the main part -- the meat. Not the best, but decent, I guess.   Service was excellent, by the way.   I really like the concept of this place. Karaoke room / restaurant / bar. Perfect combination. Next time I'm definitely going to tear up the noraebang!",

Anything that appears on \"Check please, Bay Area!\" automatically earns my respect, especially when everyone on the show gives it the best reviews ever. And, what can be better than singing kareoke, downing beer, AND eating all in the privacy of one room?  Since I'm official party planner for most events (I suppose), I called to reserve a room, which is thirty bucks an hour with a minimum of 10 bucks per person. They were very good about giving me the room, and it was a good price for a two hour session. Upon arriving, I was able to easily let them know that our party was going to be one less person and it was no problem. However, they ask that you give them your credit card just in case there might be some kind of \"damage.\" I thought this was a bit odd, I mean, how much trouble could you get into while singing kareoke? As soon as I handed my card over, she handed me some tambourines, which I think is pretty dangerous when you consider the number of Filipinos who would give their right arm to have these things during kareoke. Me being one of them.   We were led upstairs to a small, but big enough room for our group of eight people. Our waitress was very lovely and nice, and showed us how to use the remotes for the machine, both of which were in English and Korean. We ordered drinks, and when she said we were ready, we could order through this black phone on the wall, which made this place even more awesome.   And I guess once we got through the cool quirks about the place, that's when the breakdown happened. We ordered a pitcher of Hite beer, and the next thing we knew, they came up with a bottle that looked like a huge soda liter. Upon first taste, it was flat, and this led my friend to say he didn't want anymore, so I had to chug that whole bottle by myself (I am not above chugging beer that will go to waste). The food looked good at first, especially the Dolsot bimbimap which was hot and just plain good upon arrival... it's really the only thing worth mentioning. What I expected to be better was the bbq short ribs! I mean, they were good, but they were just .... mediocre. That's how I can describe the food. And I was slightly buzzed, and this didn't really stop me from judging the food.  All in all, I probably wouldn't go back to Playground unless invited, or maybe just for dinner. But I loved the service and attentiveness, especially since we reserved a room. The kareoke is most definitely a highlight in this visit, especially since their selection is wide (it goes from Top 40 to World to beyond!). I recommend it if you've got a group of friends who want to try something different.",

Also my favorite Korean bar and my favorite place to go NRB (Korean-style karaoke in a private room)....because you can order food and booze.   The food is fantastic - I recommend the bibim mandoo (dumplings in a Korean spicy sauce), tang soo yook (sweet and sour pork), gganpoong saewoo (shrimp in a totally different Korean spicy sauce), jjajangmyun (noodles in a black \u00a0bean sauce) and dooboo kimchi (kimchi, tofu, and sauteed veggies). The prices for food are more than reasonable, same for soju, and unlike most other Korean bars, they even have various liquors if that's what you prefer. The service is always fantastic and I love how if you order lots of food, you get free food or soju.  This is my go-to place for taking out of town visitors. In fact, my brother-in-law who is from Portland has had his last three birthday parties here. I think on the last one, everybody had such a good time, nobody remembers it. Thanks Playground!!!  UPDATE: Went to Playground with a bunch of non-Koreans, most of whom had never done Korean-style NRB. We were having too much fun but our reservation ran out so we went downstairs to Ssisso and did beer towers. We had so much fun that my wife and I both lost our phones. Thanks Playground!!!",

But honestly it wasn't their fault that they gave us that room, because I only said that 13 people were going to come. (Wish friends RSVPd better so I could have reserved the bigger room) But glad they all came because it sure felt like we were HOT sardines in that room!! The day I found out we had 16-18, it was too late... LOL then I guess their AC broke, but that didn't really make us stop the crazy Performances and the Soju, Beers, and shots just kept coming. I liked their shot menu, because you can actually pick which type of Hennesy you wanted. Not like other places that just charges you $10 for cheap drinks.   But the owner and the waiters were really nice to us, probably because we were Really nice to them. That at the end, they felt bad that our AC failed (oh they gave us a Fan that totally helped and one of my friends used as a prop in her performance) and that a lot of our orders got backed up, that they comped us a lot of food/drinks. The bill was surprisingly lower than I thought.   Regardless of all the bad things, this place was REALLY fun and totally worth it. Oh the Yogurt Soju is a must!!

Know Before You Go: 1. karaoke also available upstairs - THESE GO RIDIC FAST! \u00a0Sometimes you have to reserve a few days in advance, or, if you're interested in same day, you might end up getting a 12 AM reservation....and ain't nothin' wrong with that!  2. a bit pricey: average $15 for an entree. \u00a0share with a friend\\",

OK, you get it, right? \u00a0Sorry. \u00a0The rest of the plates with more on them were much much more. \u00a0The YAKULT and alcohol thing was amazing to Stephie, but she wonders why they didn't know what YAKULT was. \u00a0They knew it only as yogurt. \u00a0  Basically the place does not equal the price. \u00a0That's the only complaint.  Word of advice if you're gunna hit this place up anyway.... watch them make your drink. \u00a0They will try to skimp on the alcohol. \u00a0Just look them dead in the eye and politely ask for more. \u00a0Because you are an alcoholic after-all, which makes you no fool when it comes to that shit. \u00a0Right San Francisco???!!! \u00a0Right.",

Someone once told me \"Karaoke\" is Japanese for \"tone-def\"   \"Playground\" must be English, for \"Haven\" I get it, I get it, this place is THE spot for after work, socializing,  and happy-hour antics.  Playground tries to create a relaxed and \"playful\" environment,  with three exclusive karaoke rooms and traditional Korean kim-chi kissing foods!  I'm a sucker for \"Soju\", if you haven't had it, you are missing  the grand taste of \"Angels tears\" (yeah, it taste like that)  I love the \"Yogurt Soju, The Lichee, and yeah even the Soju bombs\". It's a decent place to pregame for lawless nights in the city. Korean foods and curries, are amazing, the help and wait staff is friendly.   Here's what I got:  \"KALB\" which is the, Korean short ribs marinated in a house soy sauce. and \"KANPOONG SAEWOO\" which is deep fried prawns battered in a sweet &amp; spicy garlic sauce... it was spicier than I envisioned.   Just because I'm \"nosy\" like that, I peeked over and even saw some dishes with octopus and steamed buns, and other stuff, which would make you want to explore the menu more. The staff was friendly enough to explain the dishes... and I was courageous and daring enough to eat them!  I think my favorite part of this place, Is WATCHING THE KOREAN MUSIC VIDEOS ON THE SCREEN while it is being projected on a wall above!  C'mon you know your addicted to Korean Dramas too! ;)",

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  You're gonna say I'm crazy, you're gonna say I'm smoking crack, hell, you might even wanna lynch me, but I'm gonna say it: Playground is the best Korean restaurant in San Francisco.  *ducks*  I mean, c'mon, it's embarrassing when a glorified bar puts out tastier kal-bi than 95% of \"legit\" Korean BBQ restaurants in the City. \u00a0Combine that with the impossibly tasty Yang-nyum chicken (and the similar Kan Poong shrimp), a kick-arse Jjajang-myun, that creepily delicious little corn-and-mayo-and-cheese panchan, and an overall volume level where I'm (surprisingly) not the loudest @$$hole in the room, among other things, and I say you got a winner!  I would've given this place 5 stars, except for 2 minor things... well, 2 minor people, actually. \u00a0First, there's this one waiter is leaps and bounds sh1ttier than all of the other super-cool waiters and waitresses. \u00a0This guy always half-asses everything, never takes orders correctly, doesn't bring you stuff that you ask for, and always pretends not to hear or see you when you're trying to flag someone down. \u00a0I'll knock off only a 1/2 star for his antics, since it's easy to just work with any of the other uber-nice waiters and waitresses instead of this guy. \u00a0  The other 1/2 star off goes to this one \"waitress\" that I've seen only once (luckily). \u00a0She was kinda condescending in that smiley bitchy way, and instead of worrying about the understaffed tables, she just stayed behind the bar. \u00a0Don't we have a bartender to do that, miss? \u00a0That was longest Korean dinner evAr heh. \u00a0But only -1/2 because I never saw her again. \u00a0Thank God.  5 stars for the food, atmosphere, and service; -1 for 2 lousy servers. \u00a0Playground's a real winner. \u00a0I'm just sad that they're not open for lunch anymore.  P.S. Screw Toyose. \u00a0Playground's where it's at.",

I actually found this place using Yelp, but I wasn't convinced and went to check out the place for myself before booking the venue. My bf and I checked out a few of the karaoke places in the vicinity starting at Playground and we looked at about 3 or 4 other places (including Do Re Mi and the one that is kinda underground). Playground turned out to be the cheapest option. It was booked for that Friday and the only slot they had open for Thursday night was from 8-10pm. I figured this would be good because we could have dinner, sing and then head elsewhere to continue the birthday festivities. I would definitely suggest making a reservation to make sure you get a room for the night you want to go.  There was 13 of us in their biggest room. We fit pretty comfortable so I wouldn't suggest putting more than 15 people into the room. The waiter would periodically come up and take our order and we could also use a phone to call down. We all had a great time. The food was really good. I can't remember anymore exactly what we had. I do know we went with a bunch of finger foods for everyone and there were enough vegetarian options for my vegetarian roommate.   The drinks were perfect for my birthday. I was dreading being one of those just turned 21 yr olds with their head over the toilet by midnight. We had about 8 carafes of soju. We tried the yogurt of course but also had lychee and... mango, I believe. This was almost 6 months ago so I'm having a hard time remembering. The yogurt was the favorite of the night.   The karaoke was fun. Their selection was good enough to keep us occupied for the 2 hours we were there. We definitely found a few favorites and were belting out some horrible singing by the second hour. Only problem with the room is that it starting getting really hot. We tried to open the door a few times, but were told to close it. I guess no one else wanted to hear our singing. I like the little disco light you can turn on as well haha.   Price-wise I'm not really sure how it went. The stipulation was that every person would have to order $20 worth of food. It's not something they strictly enforced, although I'm sure we were much over our limit. I think each person paid about $30-$35 and that's considering that the birthday girl (me) did not pay.   I would come back here. For the food or for the karaoke, but mostly for the soju :]",

I really should give you 10 stars, because my friends and I owe you much more that a stellar review, but Yelp has this 5 star limit which really gets in the way of my morning after apologies.   I am pretty sure I am not allowed back to this playground, but I am glad I got to play, so thanks for making my friends birthday so memorable and at the same time erased from many of our memories.   Upon entering this playgrounds foyer you will find a whole lot of Christmas lights, a phone, some plants that look real when you are drunk but look very plastic in your kitchen when you are hungover. Do not try to rip the lights off the wall and steal them. The strand is long and wraps around the entrance into the establishment, where you will be seen. The phone, however, can be dismantled. Actually I take the comment about the phone back, as I believe it is no longer there.   Once you pass the foyer you will find a hostess who will take your name for a private karaoke room upstairs, before shooing you to the left to wait in the dining/bar area where you will partake in their yogurt/soju fuck you up the ass secret weapon drinks that taste harmless but are about as harmless as a cute little hungry tiger. You will possibly break a few shot glasses, and possibly add a few more to your home collection.   Eventually you will be let upstairs to one of the rooms of varying sizes and shapes and be herded in like cattle on slaughter day. You will have a book of songs that you will not sound good singing even if you think you do, complete with a video monitor of videos that make no sense whatsoever in relation to the song. You will prop the door open, without getting in trouble because these people are VERY accommodating, and scream and drink more aforementioned cocktails until some of you are drunk crying, some are dry humping, some are white man dancing to Madonna and others are looking for even more shit to steal. Then, after you are told to leave you will do just that.....possibly while forgetting to pay the bar tab, but that is any ones guess.   Once you are safely outside with friends you do not remember seeing you might almost get in a fist fight with a tourist who thinks there are cactus in Japantown and thinks you are one of them and wants to take your photo, but you will not remember it. You will only remember how awesome it was to scream Total Eclipse of the Heart with the birthday boy and wake up the next morning with a voice just as hoarse as Bonnie Tylers.   5 stars to Playground for letting us in and letting us stay, even if it was just that one time!!",

Yeah, it's great if you're good at singing Korean songs and once in a while Chinese and Japanese songs, but for me, an American born Chinese, I tend to stray from that territory and want to sing some English tunes, you know. \u00a0I'm not sure if they know this or not, but we don't live in the 1990s anymore. \u00a0People like Celine Dion, or Ace of Base ain't exactly chart toppers these days. \u00a0The selection of English songs are mediocre at best, although I'm sure they have up-to-date Korean tunes and probably up-to-date Chinese and Japanese tunes also since my eyes seem to overlook Mika Nakashima songs that I remembered coming out in 2006, or was it 2007, whatever, one or the other.  I think what San Francisco needs is less Korean/Chinese owned karaoke joints and more Japanese owned karaoke joints because the Japanese get serious when it comes to karaoke-ing. \u00a0If you've ever been to Japan (I have) then you would know what I'm talking about. \u00a0Even in a country where English is not the dominant language, the song selection at a Japanese karaoke place far exceeds any Asian-established karaoke box in San Francisco.

Boisterous crowd knocking back 40 oz Korean brew. That was the vibe, which may not be all that bad, but we had come for the food,... and, uh, not-so-good.   In general, the food, particularly seafood, wasn't fresh. The noodle soup came in a broth that, while spicy (good, in my book), tasted like it came out of a \"instant\" packet. The side dishes were probably the highlight and they were ok.   It appears to be a family-run operation and all of our servers were courteous and considerate.

We got the regular flavored yogurt soju, delishhh... it goes down SO easy for those of you who cant drink, and they keep it really cold with an extra ice bath, so it never gets to a nasty warm. The waitstaff was extremely friendly and even offered us board games and a deck of cards... mind you... this is 11pm on a wednesday night. Both my friend and I had to work late that day, and our reservations at zushi puzzle ran a little late, omakasae style usually does. We were very pleased to find a restaurant that was open late on a weeknight. Not only that they serve FROYO! hehehe ... it was funny but the waiter brought me a big bowl of plan froyo with fruity pebbles on top! It was actually really good!

First off, I have to say I am very surprised with the complaint of bad service. Playground is not your Alexander steakhouse if that's what these guys are expecting the service to be. My experience for the many times I've been here has been great. I booked a private karaoke room at Playground to celebrate my birthday and since then, it's been a relationship that I can not seem to break &amp; the funny thing is, what wow'd my and made my night so memorable was the staff, the people there, and the SERVICE! The little green bottles of soju and the tall tubes of yogurt soju started the night well! We ordered alot of food but what was most memorable was the fried chicken, seafood pancake, and this corn cheese mixture. \u00a0There were no complaints, devoured it we did.   After our time was up we were advised that another party had reservations...we were bummed as we weren't ready to leave BUT the person helping us asked if we would like to have a table set up down stairs to continue our night...OF COURSE!  Well the rest of the night was a little crazy with a mix of everything in between.  One thing I have to say is Playground is something special. For all that has not been here, come experience the fun for yourself and don't let these snobby people deter you from a great place as you can see...my service was...........wait for it...wait for it........AWESOME!

If you are looking for respectful fair service with a descent song selection, real music videos and a place that is appreciative of your business, take your dollah bills to Pandora or Yamasho, or better yet E-plus in South San Francisco!  This place had a minimum order of $25 per head, plus the room charge of $30 an hour for a dirty room with a poor selection of music, and sticky pages/sticky floors that left me using an entire travel sized Purell after I left.  Food was terrible also. The popcorn chicken tasted like dry old chicken breast. The batter was somewhat crispy, but the dipping sauce was a very sweet mustard. i was hoping for some ranch, or bbq, or buffalo, or pepper, or chili sauce. ya feel? The topokki was also too sweet.  WORD TO THE WISE, if you're celebrating a birthday and your friends want to poke their heads in to say Happy Birthday to you, make sure you go all the way outside the venue to have them greet you. If they come into the venue with your party, they will be charged the $25. Essentially it's like a cover. We only had a core group of 9 ppl. We had 12 ppl come and go, and we were charged for the 12 people at $25 a head plus tax and gratuity. They also do an automatic gratuity of 18%. never coming back again.

They treat you like family - all the time, every time. \u00a0They have a full bar, regular and flavored soju, and a variety of beers. All you need to do is bring good company - and if you didn't like your experience at Playground, maybe that was the problem! \u00a0  Our regular order generally includes some combination of the following: the spicy shrimp dish (which isn't too spicy), kimchee chigae, la bokki, and yang nyum chicken. I especially like the fire chicken (I can tolerate very spicy food so this may not be for everyone, but it's got \"fire\" in the name, so you've been fairly warned). My wife goes crazy over the cheesy-corn dish which is complimentary (part of the \"pan chan,\" which is the set of side dishes that comes with all the entrees).   I disagree with those fretting about the price of the food. \u00a0Korean food isn't like your typical hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant, this is in SF, the entrees very well porportioned, AND you get the side dishes. I've never left hungry or upset about the bill.  We've taken a lot of friends to Playground, whether they are SF natives or just traveling through - everyone has loved it as much as we do.

There are 3 Karaoke rooms They seem to be in good condition the floor is dirty on the way to the Karaoke room the bathroom are Okay not the cleaness. There are two korean girls that are nice. They are always busy so they do not have a lot of time to talk with other people. I hung out at the playground until 9:00pm I was the only guy sitting at the bar gthe whole time. the crowd are not the best There was a disco light at the bar to make it look like it is a dance club but it not a dance club it jsut there for the music video.

I even had a second helping. Then comes the drinking. They had 1.6 liter bottles of hite and ob and all of these flavored soju's. I tried the lychee, grape, pineapple and strawberry. The Lychee by far was the bestest. The grape and strawberry sorta tasted like cough syrup after awhile. I didn't try the yogurt, which I read was pretty good. Didn't try kiwi since i'm allergic to the real ones.   Then the singing. It was an AABA idol contest, so it was actually hilarious to watch law students and lawyers sing.

All I could do was just sit there staring at the dishes drooling with a max capacity tummy while downing Hite beer and Soju.  You know it, after that we all head upstairs for the Norebang!!

But I just wanted to turn y'all on to all the costs involved.  If you eat dinner in the karaoke room, which is the only way to experience this place, IMHO, you have to spend $10/person/hour for each hour you stay in the room. The room itself is $30/hour. So that adds up to about $30/person/2 hours for food, drink, and room reservation.  And the food was pretty good. I recall having tongdak (fried chicken), nengmyun, haemul pajeon, and some cocktail soju and beer. I do remember that the nengmyun was not that great because it was very hard to chew until much later, when the soup was able to soak into it and soften it up. I damn near choked. Also, the phone was broken (and I've been dying to use a phone to order stuff at karaoke lounges since I went to Japan.)  The room was big enough for 6 of us.  So if you're willing to spend $30 on 2 hours of food/drink/entertainment -- which when put that way, seems *very* reasonable -- Playground is the place for you. You just need to carefully order so you don't spend too much, but just enough. And then you're golden.  BTW, for the karaoke nerds looking, they use Ziller machines.",

It's actually the first place where two people asked us if our food was good (we barely touched one of our plates, since we were getting full) and if we really liked the meal or if something was wrong with it. I was stunned, since at many places before this one no one bothered with that type of question, especially when the food was below par.  While we waited for our food to arrive, the waiter brought some snacks which were yummy. Bean sprouts, pickled radishes, corn with cheese, and couple other things to munch on. Nice touch. Then our food came and it was just delish. The seafood soup with noodles had nice soft-shell crab in it and big chunks of octopus. The portion was so big that we barely got to my hubby's seafood noodles.   This place is definitely worth checking out!",

Karaoke is always good when you also add alcohol and food in the mix.   We ordered the yogurt soju that seemed to be a lil stronger than most of the soju I've had before which was good. For food we had the korean pancake, fried chicken, and fried calamari. Hands down the fried chicken paired with the mustard sauce was my favorite. By the end of the night my plate was full of chicken bones. Overall a good place to have some fun and enjoy some good eats. The room walls seemed thin though we can hear people singing in the other rooms.",

    "review_text": "Soon after I posted my initial review, I got an email from J.C. from Playground. Here is what happened: March 25: Got first email from JC apologizing, explaining how they work, rates, asking for name of the person who took our reservation, etc. One thing I would like to note is that he pointed me to their website and saying how the rates is on there. I call BS on that. I googled Playground and their website didn't even show up. It's not even on the yelp page. That's some poor SEO (search engine optimization). JC offered to send me a $40 gift certificate, for me to give them another chance and to 'update' my yelp review. For the record, in my initial review, I never said I will not be coming back. I just said the karaoke part sucks.  March 31: JC sent me another email, as a follow up (I didn't respond to the first one). Hey, it takes time for me to contact my friend who did the reservation with Playground; she was pretty pissed off about it, debating if I should even contact her about it at all. In this email, JC seems to sound desperate. \"And please remember to mention your YELP complaint! \u00a0We want to fix this! :)\"  April 2: JC sent me another email, this time with Playground's email address and again reminding me to send them my address \"so that we can send out the gift card to you asap!\" Sounds a bit too desperate in my book, what exactly are they 'planning' \u00a0to send me in the mail. And they didn't mention about getting the other information (date, time, who took our reservation, etc.). They just want to send me a $40 giftcard?! If they have money to give away, might as well put it towards to hiring a better web admin \u00a0to manage their site, and make sure all the information are correct on it. Makes me reluctant to give them my address. I should also note now, that when I got this 3rd email, I was at a wedding and was a pissed off of how they, Playground, keep on nagging. Ok it's my fault for reading emails while at a wedding, but seriously, 3 emails in 1 week?! At this point, I wrote back saying I'm at a wedding and please stop the emails.  Sometime in mid April (Yelp doesn't have exact date stamp in their messaging area, nor did they send me a copy of my message to Playground): I wrote back with my address. I replied within the same email thread in Yelp.  Early May: I wrote another email \"I sent you my address 3 weeks ago and I have yet to receive the gift certificate that you said you will send to me. I am going to update my review of Playground soon. Did you ever intend to send me that gift certificate?\"  So there's that, why the sudden disappearance from yelp? I never really wanted that $40 or else I would have reply back with my address to the first email they sent me. I'm not some starving frugal girl out there trying to score as many things for free as possible. It's because how they dealt with this situation, emailing me trying to rectify the problem and then disappearing, that made me decide not to ever come back to this place again.  Playground/JC you have lost some valuable customers, from me and my friends, and possibly my friends' friends. Well, you have lost some of us as customers the first time around (karaoke). We are all in our 20's, have jobs, some in grad school, live all over the Bay, and we are one of your target customer groups.",

Old songs. Will not ever go back. A friend had reservations there, and I promptly told her how bad Playground is to cancel reservations. \u00a0And in line with their greedy track record, they charged her.   Venue:  -Not much to see besides a janky disco ball light.  -Bathroom door doesn't work. -Sticky song book pages . -Only one of the books had the English songs, making it hard for others in the room to pick songs.  Karaoke Equipment: -Not one of our (American) songs selected had a music video. The two hours we were there, we only saw one music video (Gangnam Style). -All the songs were old  Food: -If you're drunk and hungry, the food is _maybe_ soso. -Drinks were the typical soju concoctions.   Service: -The server was more than happy to keep the food and drinks coming. -Kept dropping by at the worst times to ask if we wanted more food/drinks, but really only there to do headcount. He checked frequently (every 10-15 minutes). -Want to step outside for air? Sure, but expect questioning upon re-entry: Who are you? What room? You just saw me leave a minute ago. No, I am not a different person for you to charge and add to the minimum.  Value: -HORRIBLE. Ended up with 9 people, but they charged us for 14 people, because friends dropped by (didn't eat/drink or sing). When we complained, Playground offered us a free shot, but that doesn't make sense at all. We were angry because we forced to consume 14x$25 worth of food/drinks when we only had 9.",

Being on a soju kick, my friend and I decided to give this place a try since I've read on Yelp that it is also a good place for Karaoke. Dimly lit, neon blue lighting, and Korean music videos playing, this place definitely makes you wonder...do you eat here, do you karaoke here, do you pick up a five dolla-holla here, or all of the above?  What we ordered:  - 1 bottle soju: Nothing extrodinary, just regular soju  - 1 large bottle of yogurt soju: Huge carafe, definitely stronger that the ones I had the night before at VIP Oriental  - Jjol Myun: Very good, noodles were cooked perfectly! Good portion size too.   - Tofu Soup: Friend ordered, looked pretty standard.   I'll have to say that with regards to food, Playground delivers. The banchan was decent including the cheese corn (which was $10 at VIP oriental...yeah, ridic for $0.75 canned corn with cheese on top).

I reserved one of the private rooms and it was a little expensive ($30 an hour + $25 minimum food/drink per person) but definitely worth it.   It's a karaoke/bar/restaurant so don't expect a classy, gourmet meal...think more along the lines of awesome korean bar food and lively bar atmosphere. That being said, the spicy fried chicken, korean spare-ribs, fried dumplings, and kim-chi paired really well with the soju. (I remember thinking I was too full on a couple of occasions then taking a swig of soju and then nibbling a little more and vice versa...needless to say I had more than enough to both eat and drink.)   The only thing I can think of that would make this place better is a more reliable a/c system. It might've just been our room but it did get a little toasty at some points in the evening. Also, as it is a business, the proprietors are not shy about cramming as many people into those rooms as possible. I originally reserved the room for 12 people and was relieved, after I saw the room, that only 7 were able to show up.   All in all, an awesome place for silly, drunken karaoke fun. Just make sure that if you're a little claustrophobic that you limit your party to 10 and under.",

If you think karaoke is not your scene, guess again. Yes, its freaky that its next to a Denny's in Japantown and private karaoke rooms are above the 'restaurant part' of Playground, but keep an open mind for those not familar with the f-up Korean style. Its easy! all you need to do is 1. Call and a nice woman will reserve you a private karaoke room based on the number of people in your group (CALL AHEAD!).  2. show up and pick up the 'bat phone' immediately in the karaoke room and voila, in a flash your order of drinks (I recommend yogurt soju, yum yum) \u00a0and any food you may want (hold off until you are nice and sauced, then order zhazhang myun or something) 3. pick some songs (there are korean and mandarin songs too) and plenty to start belting out in english too!

    "review_text": "My Friday night here was a night well spent.  +1 for bringing food into your karaoke room. Ideally, you order through the phone, but our phone was broken, so we had to go downstairs and put in the order. But this method is infinitely preferable to just sitting and waiting around for food, because you're biding your time singing karaoke. You don't even notice how long it takes! (and at this place, not long at all!)  +1 for having neng myeon. I seem to never end up at a place with neng myeon when I go out for Korean food, so I was pretty stoked to have it here, especially considering how hot it was the day we came.  +1, -1 for food overall. The dduk was really tender and fell apart while I was trying to pick it up, not rubbery and chewy like I've had at some places. It was super fresh. The yang nyeom chicken was okay, but I've had better. The haemul-pajeon didn't have much haemul in it, if you ask me. But the boy loved all the spring onions. The mandu was tasty, and enough for all of us to have two each. I think next time, we'll pick food that is easier to pick up with chopsticks though, because even the nengmyun was a little difficult to eat while karaoking.   +2 for service. The guy who served us was super attentive, and made sure that we had bowls and spoons for the neng-myun and that we had enough water, soju, and beer. After we had started to get into the swing of eating and singing, I told the boy to ask for the tambourine downstairs. He came back, with nary a tambourine, and said they didn't have one. The server came back a few minutes later, and asked if we needed anything else, and I asked him for a tambourine, while the boy said, he'd already asked for one downstairs. He said, if the lady downstairs didn't have it, then we probably don't have one available. I thought that was the end of it, and resigned myself to a tambourine-less night, when two minutes later, the lady comes in with my tambourine! I was stoked.  Reservations for karaoke rooms are good for Friday or Saturday, but make sure you keep it or else they charge your credit card anyway. Rooms are $30 an hour, with a minimum of $10/person/hour on food and beverages ordered in the room. It can get pretty pricey, and last night was $40/person for 2 hours, but it's a good time. One stop for Korean food and karaoke! I'll be back.",

Appetizers, drinks, desert - you name it and I was more than happy to plop down my mastercard.   We arrived and notified the host we had a reservation. The male host tells us \"that table *points* will be free in 15 minutes, than its yours\" A few minutes later, the group gets up...and a female hostess sits someone ELSE at our table! Luckily another table opened up seconds later.   We sit down and we're not oblivious to not see that we are 3 of the 6 non-asian people here. No biggie - I'm from Fremont, its not new. Then the following happened. A COMPLETE STRANGER- never met her before, an Indian girl I believe, walks up to us and says:  \"Heads-up guys, I think they're racist here if you're not Asian. We waited like an hour and the waiter wouldn't take our order, we had to go GET him.\"  Thats not how you want to start a big evening. None the less, our waiter arrived and took our drink order. In the mean time, we would order our food and sip some soju while we waited for two others to show up.   Fifteen minutes later the other two guests arrive and order. Being a busy night, our food arrived 30 to 45 mins later. Being a polite bunch of joes, we wait for the other two to get their food. So we wait....and wait...and wait...and wait.   This is now too much to bear, its been 25 mins since my food arrived. I'm starving and there is no sign of the waiter so we decide to eat before it gets cold. The other two are STILL waiting. We turn our plates into a mass of chicken bones and sticky stuff. Its now been OVER 45 minutes. The other two guests still have not received their food. We're irritated now. They ordered 15 mins after we did, how is the delay over 45? Shortly after, the waiter showed up with their entrees and said one of them was on the house.

As the night went on, the stars decreased...  When my party and I arrived we were immediately seated in our 20-person karaoke room where the room was really small to fit our 20-person party but we managed. \u00a0The hostess immediately instructed us on how to order through the phone (like room service style) and how to operate the karaoke machine as well as show us where the titles were listed in english in the karaoke book. \u00a0That was great.  Now, onto ordering. \u00a0I quickly ordered food and drinks for some of the people in the party as others were still looking through the menu. \u00a0I of course had to order for myself. \u00a0The food took a bit long but out of the food I ordered I only received one order as well as no drinks for myself. \u00a0I guess it was water for me at that point. \u00a0Anyway, I was always in and out of the room as even more guests arrived. \u00a0Our so-called 20-person room only fit about 10-12 filipinos while the rest of my guests ate at the bar downstairs or at their own table.  So while most people received their food, I was still waiting for my last dish and yogurt soju but to my disappointment nothing showed. \u00a0It was not 10:30 and time for us to leave. \u00a0We received the check and to my disappointment, the drinks I ordered were on the check but we never received it. \u00a0They immediately fixed that error. \u00a0When we received the check again we were surprised to see that the check was in korean and not in english. \u00a0How were we supposed to know if the check was correct. \u00a0It was time to go and we just paid it all.   I left hungry and buzzed. \u00a0The bartender was cool but there was only one and so she was bombarded with a ton of requests. \u00a0I really wanted to love this place as I heard some great reviews but my experience was only subpar.  The party manager was the best part of the place and then the karaoke was next in line. \u00a0The soju that I drank from a friend was cool but the food would have tasted good had I received my food in the first place.  Sorry Playground, I'm not coming back with a big group. \u00a0However, if I did come back, it would definitely not be with a group of 20.",

My guy friends came a lot over the semester and became good friends with one of the bartenders, but I haven't decided if they're really friends or if it's cause they buy copious amounts of drinks from her..... either way she and all the workers are nice... but since it gets really busy they can get slow. Also there's somethin about the dark walls +neon lights + TVs + loud groups (incl ours) that gives off this buzzed atmosphere....so it's def not the most ideal environment for a date or something like that~  My roommate also had a bday party here and got a room upstairs for noraebang....they let us fit in like 20 people but it was def crowdedd~~ A few wks ago my friends came back and managed to crank out a $300 bill that apparently sobered them up....",

But the real gem here was the fried chicken. \u00a0I really like 99 Chicken in the South Bay too, but it seems like 99 Chicken's specialty is that sauce they put on it, which I am not a big fan of. \u00a0So comparing the non-sauced 99 Chicken and the fried chicken at Playground, the fried chicken at Playground wins hands-down. \u00a0I don't know if it's the batter that they use to fry the chicken or something else, but it was so good that we were considering to order another large plate for the table, but since we were all watching our girlish figures, and since it was already 2:30 am, we decided not to do that.  The waiters were quick and attentive to us, and with so many people in the place, and the fact that it was so late into the night, everything came out pretty quickly.

I think my favorite one was the lychee flavor.  Playground also has Karaoke, but I prefer Yamasho over Playground. \u00a0My friend tried to book a room here for Karaoke for a birthday party. The room is $30/hr, however they require a $25 drink/food minimum PER PERSON. Not really sure how I feel about that. I guess if you are eating dinner here, it would be fine, but that's steep for just karaoke.",

    "review_text": "All I wanted was to feel like I was back in Seoul again. I miss pocha-hopping, while gorging on delicious anju (booze food). Playground has everything from traditional Bibimbap to the tasty snacks I miss so much from the food tents in Korea.   Happy hour runs from 5pm-7pm. 50% off drinks and selected pupus/anju. -The happy hour food menu prices are quite reasonable, ranging from $4 to $10.  After my terrible experience at Udon Mugizo (see my previous review), I decided to drop by Playground for a little fun. It was my last night in town, I wasn't going to let that Toaster Strudel chick and crappy udon bring me down.   Unsatisfied from my sad bowl of udon, I decided to order a bottle of CHAMISUL SOJU ($12, $6 during happy hour) and some munchies.  - We polished off 3 bottles of soju.  ***If you buy 4 bottles of soju (or mixed soju drinks), the 5th one is free! But you have to order it all at the same time.  OJINGEO TWIGIM/FRIED SQUID TEMPURA (sm order $11.95, lg $14.95; $7.50 HH):  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1t8M42A&amp;s=c23c3519f245fbaf5847059064892eacf73ba18c410a5862697e7502287110d2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1t8M42A</a> Meaty pieces of calamari in a light crunchy batter. This was the perfect snack to go along with my refreshing crisp soju.   COMPLIMENTARY BANCHAN:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1vtMyGp&amp;s=75c77821988d5df89884b6ab3d477d2cab66384ecf4cd5f50963c01cdd486d31\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1vtMyGp</a> You can always tell if Korean restaurant's food is going to be good or bad, just based on how much effort is put into their banchan/side dishes. This bar did not disappoint. You could tell that the banchan was made with love. - We had a variety of veggies: bean sprouts, jangajji (pickled jalapenos and daikon) kimchi, danmuji and broccoli. The kimchi was my favorite. Just had the right amt of spice and ripeness. - My vegetarian friend loved their broccoli, they gave us more upon request. The bartender eonni was super cool and friendly.   COMPLIMENTARY CHEESE CORN: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uYMbCe&amp;s=31fdde2c7ecad2299d0e2078bb3d48e6dc7d167bafadb0aa8cb616d9a84183fe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1uYMbCe</a> Their infamous crack corn. Not sure what is in it exactly, but it's tasty. Canned corn, mayo and processed cheese never tasted so good! We couldn't stop eating it!  Thanks Playground, you saved my would've-been crappy last night in SF. I'll be back again, trust.",

    "review_text": "Ok. Soooo....in case you haven't noticed, I'm white. Yes, it's true. Shocker, I know. I'm like the whitest white person around, except for maybe, umm, dunno. I'm it. Luckily I was raised in northern California and not some really white place. By that I mean we had Mexicans too. So then I went to Cal, and there were lots of different kinds of people there. By different kinds of people I mean Asians. And some Indians.   So after 3 years, I had pretty much had enough of all that Berkeley diversity, so staying true to my Whitey McWhiterson roots, I moved to Germany, otherwise known as \"The Whitest Place on Earth\". Yeah, I know. I'm so brave...moved there all by myself to be with the white people. (Side note: I'm not actually German - I'm Irish/English/French/Italian/Polish Jew - i.e. a mutt)  But..slowly but surely, all that white started to get to me. I started to remember that there are actually other cultures, colors, cuisines...etc. I went to Japan, and started to miss Japanese food again...and finally I decided to return to our fair city. Thank god, right? I mean, WHAT would you do without me?   So...the other night I find myself at Playground, and let's just say we had been pre-drinking. And pre-eating. So I didn't really get a chance to enjoy the food here, but the few bites I had seemed good, and the service was great. Let me just say that I would be a raging bitch if I had to deal with that many drunk people on the regular.   Euge rolled up and immediately started ordering the bottles of Grey Goose, but I really wanted yogurt soju. Somehow I ended up alternating shots of soju and vodka...let me just say, this is a VERY VERY bad idea. Do not try this. Fast forward, and I realize (this is where all the white talk comes into play) I'm in the distinct minority. And that made me very happy. It's such a flip-flop from about 1.5 years ago, and it's why I moved back here. Don't get me wrong, I like white people too...but it's not really representative of the whole world. And here's where my kudos go out to Yelp - for bringing everyone together. For all of y'all's bitchiness, alcoholism and gossip-mongering ways, Yelp has a pretty cool community of relatively open-minded, friendly people, and I really appreciate it. No, I'm not drunk right now, and yes, my hormones are fluctuating wildly. What??! You want a piece of this?   So there was more drinking and many rooms of karaoke (norebang) madness. They gave us free food, we drank a ton, Ed and Omar were freestylin' it, Joy was ROCKING OUT (seriously, Joy, you are the clear star of the evening in my mind) and at one point I was screaming some song into the mic and I knocked over a whole pitcher of water onto my legs and apparently all over Jeff. Good times.   Why the three stars then? Well, the soju wasn't mixed very well, and kind of sucked in that regard. The decor is scary but I guess par for the course. I don't know. It wasn't perfect. The remotes in the rooms are all in Korean, which I obviously don't speak. Short of keeping Euge on a leash all night, I had no way of working those things.   Special thanks to Steph for being such a great organizer, and boo to the jerks who came through and tried to get out of paying. It was for a good cause!",

I thought that was super friendly of him considering that it was almost 2 in the morning aka closing time and most people would be irritable and annoyed of drunk people by that time.   I would recommend the short ribs, cheese corn and jajangmyun (black noodles) for those drunken nights. Each has their own unique flavors and you get your protein, carbs, vegetable, and dairy in all in one meal.   Overall, food was delicious, service was amazing, and I give this place a YASS!",

People often overlook the Korean food they actually serve here. The food is really good, the Korean flavors are on point. I, especially, like the cheese corn appetizer they serve here (I always ask for seconds!). I can't remember the name of the entree I've had here, but it's some sort of rice noodle thing in a spicy red sauce. It's yummmmmmmmmm!   Atmosphere: The handful of times I have been to Playground, there has either been someone who was so drunk they puked all over themselves or someone who was so drunk, they had no idea who they were yelling at. This place is constantly packed and I don't recall a night when they were not.

I happen to be Korean, so the food hit home, but all our other friends who were there are non-Korean and loved it too! The food is mostly typical Korean food, except for a few rando's like the cheese-corn, which will please your Americanese cuisine-loving friends.   But the best part is the private room karaoke. After laughing at how confusing it is to turn on the TV (instructions are in Korean), you can belt your heart out to almost any American pop song you'd want to sing. Of course there are some songs they don't have, but there's enough to keep everyone happy. And when you want more beer, you just pick up the phone and they bring it up to you! (You still have to pay for it, unfortunately.) The room was $30/hour, and splitting it among 15 friends made it super-reasonable. They lose a star because they charged us for the extra 10 minutes we spent trying to get everyone out of the room--it just made them seem a little cheap.",

Flavored soju was ridiculously sweet- nothing special and very very weak- we tried the strawberry and yogurt. \u00a0Strawberry was better. $25 for a large flask, $12 for small  Panchan only consisted of kimchi, radish, sprouts and cheesecorn.

The service was hit or miss. Very hard to get more drinks sometimes or to get empty glassed, bottles, plates cleared out. While I was waiting to flag down someone, I spied a sizzling plate sit idle on a table for 15 min before they delivered it. That sucks.  What I like to do is watch the KPop videos. Its too loud in there (or music is too soft) to really be able to hear the vocals, but the videos are fun to watch. Mostly because of the backgrounds + costumes or scenery or it seems like the all the videos have all the same girls. until it loops to Black eyed peas ... Also, they have the play list on repeat because we saw the same videos in about the same order over multiple visits.",

I was very happy--last night I had a three-way birthday celebration here with two of my friends and a large group of our friends (max 18 people)....granted, our group actually did start on our dinner late, but service was quick with getting our dishes out to us.   Let me say, the food was AMAZING. Very good, authentic Korean food--big portions, too, so our group shared the dishes family-style. Great quality jajjang myun, coroquette, bulgogi, bibimbpap, etc. Lots of little pre-dinner dishes. I was very happy with the dishes, and my friends were, too.  Karaoke was also lots of fun and did not disappoint--I was a little worried before I went to karaoke because I was not sure about their selection in Japanese songs...but they had a good mix of Japanese songs, similar to the karaoke place \"Cafe U &amp; I\" back in Annandale, Virginia. The \"new releases\" are several months behind, but that's a given since that's how the specific karaoke song provider has worked in the past. Nonetheless, I was satisfied with the selection, and my friends thoroughly enjoyed singing songs from the English selection.  Last but not least, the soju recommended by other Yelpers--also did not disappoint! We tried the yogurt soju, peach soju, and strawberry--all three were very VERY delicious, although I feel I have more of a preference for the yogurt one since I liked its creaminess.  Definitely highly recommended place--for parties, or a small dinner--great service, great food, great fun. =)",

We started to walk down to a local ramen shop but, when we got there, they had closed at 9:00PM. We walked a bit further to find Playground. We figured, why not, let's try it. So we walked up the suspect stairs to find a hole in the wall karaoke bar/restaurant. Kind of reminded me of the places we go to in K-Town in Los Angeles.   We ordered a pitcher of Hite which came in a big plastic bottle... almost the size of a 2 liter. Pretty cool. We also ordered the Rice cake with ramen and fish cake in spicy sauce as well as the chicken wings. They were both really good. It wasn't THE best rice cake I've ever had but it was satisfying for that late night crave. The wings were the best. It was fried lightly and had a sweet and spicy sauce about it. Just a wee too much batter but was still quite tasty.  Great for those late nite food cravings!!",

I may be wrong being that i am not Korean, but i have tried other restaurants such as Toyose, Han Il Kwan, My Tofu House, Muguboka, etc. and i found Playground being the best i ever had. The only down side is that their prices are a bit more higher then other Korean places, but in the end i still prefer Playground as the place to go for my Korean cravings.  Service is great, staff is very friendly. My server, I remember was Jason. Jason's approached our group with a bright attitude and was very happy to serve us. Not being Korean i asked for his suggestions. Although i don't remember what exactly were the names of the things ordered, i remember they were delicious and was very pleased. Also, he always came and checked on us to see if we need anything else. Usually at Asian restaurants, especially Chinese, the food is great, but the service is just okay. But coming to Playground, besides the food being awesome, the service was also awesome. I feel comfortable coming here and I always have a very fulfilling dining experience.  Also, the portions of food are huge. The only place i've been to with cheese corn being a side-dish.   The atmosphere is another thing that really attracts me: k-pop music playing in the background, club-like feel with dark lighting and neon lights, and a bar. It is just an overall great place to chill, have a pitcher of OB or Hite and chat with friends. They do have a Karaoke room upstairs but i have never been up there.

AMBIENCE: This place is set for sit down meals, has a full bar, and also karoke rooms upstairs. \u00a0It's awesome! \u00a0Definitely a place for night time more so than the afternoons, though. \u00a0They play a lot of korean pop music here. \u00a0It reminds me of my college days when my roommates would blast that kind of music on a daily basis. Hahahaha. Located right across the Peace Plaza in Japantown. \u00a0 When all else fails for finding parking, there's a parking lot across the street. \u00a0$4 bucks for 2 hours or so i think? \u00a0Fair enough with me. =) \u00a0  SERVICE: The servers here are great! \u00a0The lady, especially, is super nice and helpful. \u00a0The male servers here all wear GIANTS/Playground jerseys which I think is super awesome!",

Tons of food at dinner, some great, some okay, and some things gross (black sausage), came out to $27/ea. including drinks.   The karaoke side of things was the best- we had a private room, stuffed in 20 people (they'd warned us that it would be 'compact' with more than 15) but size was fine, good song selection, huge screen TV, booths, nice sound system, and lots and lots of 55oz OB Korean beers.   Best songs of the night- britney's \"Toxic\" and group sing-a-long to \"Aquarius\"!",

If you get a karaoke room, it's $30/hour with a minimum spending purchase of $20/person.   We got an 8-10 person room on my most recent visit and that was a little cramped for 10 people. The table was even more cramped, barely big enough to hold all the food and drinks we ordered. Somehow we made it work though. We ordered a hella ton of dol sot bim bim bop, some bulgolgi, cheesy corn, and a lot of beer and soju. Met our minimum spending requirements and had a great time singing out hearts out to the extensive song choices. Afterwards, we went downstairs to the bar and continued drinking. They've got a good collection of beer and soju. If you really want to mix it up and have a good time, ask about their soju bombs.   The only thing that really bugs me is that they are pretty strict about your room count. If you call and reserve a room for 10 people, they expect 10 people and will charge for that. I wish they were a bit more flexible and understanding if only say 9 people showed up.   Overall though, Playground is a very fun place to eat, drink, and sing.",

    "review_text": "Two things of which I think San Francisco lacks sorely: Karaoke and Korean Food.  Thankfully at Playground, one can have both. It isn't going to be the best Korean or the best karaoke experience for many who know this scene well, but it will serve as the one of the better venues to serve the lethal Asian combo of soju and singing.  Noraebang, i.e. Asian (or Korean) style karaoke is a private room voice belting affair that is addicting and fun for all American Idol finalists and window cracking vocalists. There is no pressure of the public crowd or the random stranger filming you from afar (#1). Instead, it's all about friends, food, and fun.  The song selection at Playground is decent. For the two rooms I got to check out, the sound system and the music videos that come with it are dated and a tad ghetto. (#2) There is a limited variety of English songs and a hell of a selection on Korean songs (but of course!). Please, someone invest in some quality wireless mics. Those wires are so 1990.  Most Korean food in SF I've had has been very mediocre and Playground's offerings aren't doing much to deter me from that conclusion. All the jungol stews, banchan sides, pajun pancakes, myun variety of any kind has been lackluster at best. But instead of talking about the stuff I didn't like, here are a few things I think would work otherwise:  * Cheese Corn. Don't have them zap that ish in a microwave in a plastic bowl. Have them serve it on a skillet. Trust me, it's *way* better this way.  * Yogurt Soju. Sure it's cute and yogurt-y, but if they douse enough cham-cha-reum in there, it's game over for you lightweights.  * Bulgolgi Fries. Southern California's Carne Asada fries have nothing on this beast. Extra cheesy with layers of kimchi make this heart attack of a platter, one worth having.  * Mul Mandu. Boiled dumplings. They seem handmade, which is surprising for a club/nightlife type spot. Smooth skin, tasty filling, it is an excellent choice for folks wanting something semi-traditional without going the pubby food route.  Lastly, the service is good. They're an amiable bunch, which I can't say is the case for many other similar places in the Bay. Hence, if I absolutely must do Korean anything in SF, it's more than likely I'll end up coming here. Big ups.  ___________ (#1) Unless of course, you decided to sing with a bunch of strangers. Roofies isn't just a drug, it's a way of life for some folks.  (#2) Relax. It's nothing like Do-Re-Mi (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/do-re-mi-music-studio-san-francisco\">yelp.com/biz/do-re-mi-mu\u2026</a>).",

Soju is pretty disgusting, so now that I'm no longer underage and have access to that magical elixir known as tequila, I stay away from it. In fact, I think the last time I had soju, I was still underage and probably at Pojangmacha (also on Telegraph Ave., not sure if it's closed down as well).  Ended up at Playground last night and had flashbacks of college, except this time no one ended up barfing up their tong dak and dduk bokki or starting a fight outside.

In all fairness to the restaurant, I probably should've said something the moment I noticed a problem with the food. Janet, the hostess/owner, has been nothing but courteous and accommodating whenever I'm there with friends and I'm sure she would've taken care of any problems immediately.  Well here we are nearly half a year later and after a number of return visits back to Playground, I'm happy to report that night in February seems to have been an isolated fluke. The service still (understandably) lags when things get busy at night, but the food has been top notch. A number of their dishes are much better than many, if not most of the Korean restaurants in the area. Quite an exceptional feat for a place that's known more for being a drinking spot than an dining destination.

When it comes to unleashing my inner rocker (or diva, depending on song selection), I'm more familiar with the 'white guy' version of butchering pop songs than I am the Asian version. What does that mean? Well, I typically find myself at bars, surrounded by drunk frat guys and sorority sisters who seemingly only know five different songs.   -Love Shack -Friends In Low Places -I Will Survive -Bohemian Rhapsody -Baby Got Back  But now that I've had a crack at grippin' the mic like our brothers and sisters to the east, I've got a newfound love of karaoke. Nothing beats having 15-20 rowdy friends packed like sardines in the same room, making collective choices on what to sing next. No more sitting through 50 year old Gloria Gaynor songs or listening to some ass wipe completely shit on the grave of John Lennon... it's all about gelling with your buds and singing in unison!  Playground has a pretty swell setup in the upper karaoke area. Three rooms, all differing in size, and running at about $30/hour. Not a bad deal considering you get a private room JUST for you and your crew.   They also have a pretty great selection to choose from. Though I still haven't found anyone with Ice Cube's \"It Was A Good Day\" on karaoke (automatic 5 stars for the first place I find rocking it), they had some pretty unusual offerings... like Lonely Island's \"Jizz In My Pants.\" For the uneducated (all four of you), enjoy: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4pXfHLUlZf4&amp;s=1477cb1bd2017ddd926099462f802cc16514f84f62b2c8be980044fb1435a179\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com/watch?v=4pXf\u2026</a>  The best part is that if you get a little parched from banging out soul jams, you can just pick up the phone from the room, and they'll deliver you icy cold brews in three shakes of a lamb's tail! Pretty cool, huh? You can also order grub, but I wasn't very hungry, so I can't comment on that end of the deal.  Overall, a pretty unassuming, but really fun hang in the middle of Japantown.

Me, I prefer a microphone, about 10 shots of soju, and the company of about 20 of the coolest Yelpers in SF. No one snickered when I, again, royally screwed up \"All Out of Love\". (silent tear).  Playground is more of a Korean restaurant these days than a karaoke destination, but there are 3 rooms upstairs that can accommodate about 10-15 people per room. Now, there are about 20 negative things I could say about Playground, ie. It's expensive, the drinks are watered down, and it takes a Rhodes Scholar to run the remote control. However, these were minor distractions because the company was so freaking good. Yelpers, 5 stars. Playground, 3.",

The food was solid - had the kalbi, spicy pork, and Soon Tofu soup. \u00a0Tasty, but a bit on the pricey side.  It seems pretty busy, so I'd suggest reservations. \u00a0The nice part about eating in Japantown is the parking garage, which is right across the street from the place.  I was there with a party of about 15 - 20 people for a birthday, who were either downstairs eating or upstairs crooning away in the karoake room. \u00a0For $30/hour for a private room, it was cheap given the number of people we crammed inside. \u00a0The staff was super accommodating given the fact that we kept floating from the room to the bar to the main dining area. \u00a0  After a fun night of karaoke, food, drinks, and laughs, I left with 3 thoughts:  1. \u00a0Outkast's \"Hey-ya\" repeats the words \"Shake It\" about 100 times. \u00a0Andre 3000 must have been under some serious drug influence to sing that song.  2. \u00a0Please do not sing \"Last Christmas\" at a birthday party. \u00a0It just dampers the mood. \u00a0  3. \u00a0Why do Asian karaoke videos have the most random images that have nothing to do with the song? \u00a0(e.g. animals, fountains, streets, naked babies on the beach).

The rooms are pretty clean and comfortable as far as karaoke rooms go, and the service was friendly and eager to help. Expect a completely asian crowd in the bar/restaurant area.  The selection of music was decent for American songs. The only downside was the order was only by song name and not by artist. And the best part of Playground is that you can order food and drink (+alcohol) from the room easily. It comes up without delay. $12 for a large bottle of yogurt soju is a good deal! Just be careful because it goes down easy but can slap you in the face in the AM.  Bottom line: with drinks, uninhibited singing, and a fun group of friends, you'll have a good time. Reserve ahead of time. They require a $10 per person minimum charge in addition to $30/hr for the room. Not bad, actually. Those prices are pretty competitive with any other karaoke place, and you can have food and alcohol in your room.",

I didn't eat any of the food here, but we did reserve a room here to celebrate my friend's recent birthday. Unfortunately, despite our reservation we stood around the packed waiting area of Playground for about 20 minutes. It seemed like more than that but maybe it was because of the constant crush of drunken bodies trying to get by us in the narrow waiting area. (Worse was the drunken idiot who seemed to purposefully splash his drink into the area and got my white coat wet.)   There was a sign on the wall saying that only something like 10 people were allowed upstairs at a time. (That seemed like a mistake since it was ridiculously low for three rooms.) Anyway, the weird part was that there was a steady stream of people going downstairs at all times, as though they were exiting some upstairs clown car.  Once we had our room we had a great time. My favorite random topless Tahitian man dancing video even made an appearance during one song.  The most memorable moment was probably when my friend got down to U Can't Touch This complete with Hammer dancing (sadly no Hammer pants).",

The appetizers we got were decent and I would like to try other things because I like Korean food.  For karaoke, I came with 3 other friends so we split the $30 between us 4 and of course our meals were separate. When we came in, we were literally the only ones there. With that, I expected service to sort of be on top of it because we were the only ones they needed to attend to. We got our food 30-45 min in so we were stuffing the food down our throats while putting in songs because we were running out of time in the room. A little stressful.  There is a phone in the room that you can use to call and order downstairs but I found it easier to walk downstairs instead of waiting for them to answer the phone. I went to ask how much time we could stay in the room because we got started a little late and the guy didn't even know what time we got there. That made me a little mad especially because we were the only ones there!   So the two stars come from good food, and in the end my 3 friends and I did have a fun for the most part.

Me and my friends ordered the fried chicken and the server was super nice and gave us a honey mustard sauce to go with it which was even better than eating it plain. We also ordered soondubu here and it's quite good as well.  The service here is excellent and this place is pretty hip to me. I love all the korean music videos that are played on the flat screens.

When you want to relax with some friends and have a few beers while eating tasty Korean food, this is the place you want. \u00a0While there may not be the full BBQ setup with the fan and grill, that's not why you come to a place like this.  Seoul has thousands of places just like this, and LA has hundreds. \u00a0But for the Bay Area, there aren't many that hit the spot like this.  And for mixed crowds (that include non-Koreans), I should point out that everyone that worked there seemed to speak perfect English. \u00a0But if you want something, you need to just raise your hand and ask. \u00a0Most people get the wrong impression and think service is bad at places like this, but all you need to do is ask. \u00a0If it's late and I'm eating and drinking, I don't want some waiter coming by every 5 minutes asking if I need anything else - I'd rather be left alone with my cheese-corn (much better than you think) and dduk-bukki (rice cakes in spicy sauce).  Haven't tried the noraebang (karaoke rooms) upstairs (yet), but I'm sure there will come a time when I have no choice.  PROS: - Open late, full bar - Pretty extensive menu - Fried Chicken is pretty good - spicy, crunchy (like the Colonels USED to be) - Staff is friendly (although not all that attentive), and they speak native English  CONS: - Parking on the street is tough, but there's always the Japantown Parking Garage - Not the best Korean food you'll find (but that's not why you go here)",

Nothing about out meal was good. The short ribs were ok..but nothing great, we ordered the BBQ pork...fatty and not good...and the chicken which was super dry and in super small pieces. It honestly did not taste much like BBQ.  The service was terrible as well. Our waiter took our order, and never returned until he gave us the check...not even a refill on water! Oh and don't order hot tea...it tastes like dirt water, and is served in the same plastic cup they serve water in.  Also, make sure to pace out your sides as they don't refill them.

When we wanted to order a large bottle of beer to share with our table the waiter suggested Hite, which turned out to be one of those almost tasteless korean beers whose large bottle is comparable to a Tide detergent bottle.

It was a bit pricey but about the same as most karaoke places I've been to.  well it was kinda a small room for the group we were with but it was still big enough to suffice. the food was excellent but definitely pricey lol i think we spent more on the food and booze than anything. they had a variety of flavored soju so that was a big plus to me. their list of music to sing to was pretty large but i think the need to add more into other areas than just English and Korean. we had others that could of been singing in Japanese and Tagalog, so i think they could benefit by providing more updated songs in all languages. was a bit disappointed that they had nothing in Spanish....not that i know many songs but still need to represent lol.  it was a great place to gather with friends and sing with our tone deaf voices while drinking soju and enjoying random conversations and sing rediculous songs. It was a blast so i recommend this place if you're looking for some karaoke, though i suggest a large group since the price so you can all slit it and make it cheaper on yourselves lol.",

Despite how busy it is, service is always great and our orders don't take a long time to come. Whenever we come here, it is a MUST that we get the Yogurt Soju and Seafood pancake. DELICIOUS! Last night we had a huge party and ordered a lot of other dishes and drinks. I love it when you order a lot of things at Korean places, they give you some free stuff (service) and it's always really good too. Last night we had fried calamari and potato cakes. yummm! \u00a0I like how aside from their full Korean menu and soju drinks, Playground also has a full bar. \u00a0Prices are really reasonable too. 3 shots of Henny Priv and vodka tonic was $32. The proprietor, Janet, is great and super nice! Thanks for trying to accommodate our large party and checking in on us even though you were totally swamped with everything else and hooking us up every time we go there!  I have never had a bad experience at Playground. Looking forward to the next time we come here again!",

    "review_text": "I would say this is a 3.5 - but I don't believe in half stars. I've used other Karaoke rooms before and would say the following:   1) Although it's cool to have a restaurant/karaoke place, I don't like the fact you are enforced to buy food and drink. I mean, I would buy a drink anyway, why make it an issue and a $10 minimum  2) The $10 minimum doesn't really matter as the majority of the food is over $10 anyway. Neither me or my friend were particularly hungry, so we ordered a combo plate for just under 20 smackeroons. Pretty poor quality food and definitely not worth the price. Should have stuck to 3 or 4 drinks to go over the minimum.   3) 18% enforced gratuity. Really? For the enforced food and drink order? That's mean, people.   Overall, I love karaoke, so I had a great time, but it was expensive. I've seen multiple reviews saying the food is great, but that isn't the experience i had, so maybe it's worth trying something else next time but to be honest, I am not sure if I buy into the novelty of restaurant/karaoke - not when I am forced into both at the same time. It makes for a night more expensive than it really should be. The English song list is pretty small as well - maybe if they expand their selections I will be more tempted to go here over Do Re Mi.",

I had to get up to talk to a waiter everytime I wanted something (for water, for glasses for the water, to order food, for soju...excuse me is this self service? i wasn't aware..) . The music is too damn loud for anyone to hear you say something the first or second time. \u00a0Expect to be given a menu by a waiter, only to have it be taken away by the manager before you order, a manager who's \u00a0going to brush by you and act too busy and important to care if you're trying to bring to his attention that you haven't freaking ordered. Service get's a 0, because it didn't exist.  Their potstickers are like how non-asians make potstickers. They're fried on all sides, the skin is puffy and just not very palatable. A 2. Wouldn't order it again.   I also ordered number 35, which was some sort of fried chicken with spicy garlic sauce. which was delicious.skin was crispy, the meat was juicy, the sauce was yum. \u00a0Hearty portion. i give this a 4.   The heralded soju cocktails were pretty tasty and not as watered down as some reviews suggest, but they ARE pricy. I'd rather go for the much cheaper plain soju and get plastered sooner .",

    "review_text": "I'm torn because I really do love this place but the quality is suffering and the staff need to know.   First what I do like about this place: 1) The food and atmosphere are top notch! 2) The service is good! Friendly staff! 3) Pricing is not the cheapest but the place is a bit higher quality than hole in the wall places like Do Re Mi (which I still love and visit regularly also). \u00a0 This is a place to have a bday party. \u00a0They are flexible with pricing so if you don't exactly meet the food or drink limit they don't make it a big deal unless its way off. 4) The yogurt sojus. Keep them coming. 5) Tambourines. I love when karaoke places include stuff like that in the room. Adds a new dynamic (and if you don't like them you don't have to use it.)   The things that I did not enjoy as much: 1) Things have not been maintained well over the years. \u00a0I came in a 8-10 person room which is spacious but one of the microphones had duct tap at the bottom and cracked horribly anytime the mic was passed around or not handled carefully. \u00a0This is a high-quality karaoke establishment and a new microphone is $99, please throw this dying microphone away. \u00a0You are worsening the experience for good paying customers and they will think twice about coming back. 2) All the song books are reallllly thick because they have songs for about 4 different languages in them. \u00a0If I was running my own karaoke place (a dream of mine) I would go to Staples, buy some binders and split this in 4 books. \u00a0Think about how much more enjoyable this would be for the customer. 3) The American song selection is ok but not amazing. \u00a0I love when karaoke places have a list of songs in the back of all the new and latest songs. Makes things easy and fun. Again think about the customer. 4) We had 2 song binders and one of the girls in our group refused to use one of them because she said it \"smelled like piss\". \u00a0Being the person that is running the party, I just switched binders with the other side of the table. \u00a0Only halfway through the party while I was flipping pages did I find one of the pages soaked at the bottom (under the plastic sheet) which made the white page gray at the bottom. I smelled it and it really did spell like piss. \u00a0  To conclude: Please properly maintain your song books, microphones, and other equipment, Playground. \u00a0This is not the cheapest karaoke place and we go here for the quality. \u00a0We depend on you and want to give you our money for a nice night out.  I will probably hit up The Playground again in a few months and will update this review if things improve. \u00a0In the meantime I'm going to scope out some new places.",

The banchans were decent, but I wish that they would have given some refills on them through the course of the meal.

It's a Korean karaoke bar that offers a great selection of American music in the middle of Japantown and it also serves Korean food and drink. Put that into your cultural pipe and smoke it!   First came here with a group of co-workers, and you know how us accountants do - we like to get pretty tipsy. The soju was great of course - i recommend yogurt, lychee, and especially mango for those who like the sweeter stuff. Also try mixing the sojus together for new tastes as well! Also go for the chicken wings (dry).   It seems many people don't remember what they do here, which is great. :) I mean, how could you? You're singing, you're drinking, you don't really have that much food...  It gets pretty pricey here - a room is $30/hour, soju is $25/big carafe, plus food which is usually in the $teens. last time i came, we ended up paying $60 each for 5 people. Then again, we were there for 3 hours. V^.^V  Be careful when you come down those steps if you're drunk. They wind and will add to the drunken effect you are experiencing. b^.^",

Walking up to this joint was a little confusing. I wasn't sure if I was walking into a diner or a bar or a karaoke lounge or what. I was greeted by bouncer and then seated by a hostess. So I suppose it's a combo of both? The place looks like it's lit by bug zappers as everything was glowing neon blue. The screens were playing unfamiliar K-Pop. The bathrooms are hell-holes. And you had to yell to your friends who were sitting a foot away just to hear them over the drunken shouts of your neighboring patrons. That said, I had a grand ole' time!  It looked like there was a full bar area in the corner, but it seemed that most others sat at tables while sipping on soju and snacking on Korean tapas style plates. They auto-brought a couple common dishes, one including corn and melted cheese. Simple....but amahzing (bonus points for who can tell which Fall2011 show that's from). We also ordered spicy dumplings, which I hear were to die for (my delicate palate doesn't appreciate the fiery touch of that sort). But the main reason we were there were to sip on the various choices of Korean vodka. We got the Yogurt and Mango types. Yogurt: A+, Mango: B-. If you're a n00b to the soju-movement, be careful. It tastes like a common Caprisun, so you drink a million shots. Then it just HITS you like when your father catches you watching late night HBO (that really happened to me when I was 5).  The place isn't for the dainty or faint of heart. Be ready to deal with some ish, but you'll definitely have a good time if you're up for it.",

While the weekend crowd can be young, as in barely out of college kids, and the environment may resemble more of a lively soju bar with food being an afterthought, weeknights are typically quiet. Its a good place to have a very casual group dinner if budget is a concern, and you don't mind the K-pop videos playing in the background.  I like the food even if it's not the most authentic Korean fare. There are some unique dishes like The La Bokki, which is a stirfry consisting of ramen, rice cakes, and egg. A spicy chicken topped with cheese is surprisingly, a good combination. You'll also find things like the standard korean meat entrees, tofu stews, and noodles on the menu. For sipping, they have quite a few flavors of yogurt soju which I prefer over the clear, rubbing-alcohol variety. If you're like me, try the aloe or lychee flavors. Both are not overly sweet and very yummy. But don't forget, they are alcoholic beverages.",

In addition, my friend's girlfriend had to make a second reservation to secure a room on the designated date because for some reason (to which we are still in the dark about), they gave away the first one.  I'd rather spend my cash at Do Re Mi, thank you very much.",

I came here to celebrate my cousin's birthday and we did it up with yogurt soju, hite beer, and several entrees. The pricing of the entrees concerned me, but the banchan and size of the entrees made up for the price. We ordered:   -Haemul Pajeon: seafood pancake with green onions and assorted seafood -Yang Nyum Chicken: fried chicken seasoned in a special spicy house sauce - Kanpoong Chicken: deep fried chicken battered in a sweet and spicy garlic sauce -Bibim Mandoo: spicy dumplings filled with pork and vegetables and meat  The pancake was a tasty way to start of the meal: crispy, savory, and slightly salty from the dipping sauce. \u00a0Both kinds of fried chicken were battered and crispy, but covered in a slightly different sauce. Both sauces were literally, FINGER-LICKING-GOOD! \u00a0The dumplings were also tasty, but there was a slight disparity in stirfried veggies-to-dumplings ratio (ALOT of veggies were leftover).   Definitely a fun place to go if you're craving alcohol + chicken wings. Don't be scared by the prices! The chicken wings are worth it.   Note: We only came here for dinner, not karoake. \u00a0The dining room was really dim and had K-pop blasting on a floor-to-ceiling projection scene. A plus if you're into Korean girly boys and soap operas, like I am. A negative if you like adequate lighting and intelligible music.",

Fast forward 2007, the Playground has transformed into a restau-bar with a dining area at the main level while providing various Karaoke private rooms at the upper level.  My cousins and I joined the Karaoke loving Yelp community for an hour or so of serenading, enjoying a nice bottle of Cab, and \u00a0a few soju shots. \u00a0The Karaoke event \u00a0was a sweet proposition: \u00a0songs and drinks for charity.  The rooms were quite stuffy, a functional ventilation system would have been great. \u00a0The equipment's interface and instructions were all in Korean characters. \u00a0Technical equipments though, are intuitive for this geek, characters or not, I somehow knew what to press, and as we started the evening, the three of us immediately got our Roke system going.  The private room setup reminded me of the Karaoke places in Tokyo, although those in Tokyo are more hip, industrial and definitely high-budget looking.  It was interesting to note that they served potent and sumptuous looking food in each room. \u00a0Too bad, I was not in famine mode, otherwise, I would have indulged. \u00a0I enjoyed seeing Luis M, devouring the soup, and made a mental note: \u00a0to return and try the various soup dishes.  After one too many songs rendered, we opted to slip away, hail a cab, and checkout what was in store at Rassales.",

The yogurt soju was tasty, but I have to say I'm not sure how much soju was in the batch we received - it was pretty mild in terms of alcohol content.   On the karaoke front, I found their song selection to be pretty decent - based on other reviews I thought it would be a lot worse! We also scored a tambourine midway through our reservation, and I have to say that really added to the experience.  Things preventing Playground from having a 5 star review:  - We arrived on time but had to wait 15 minutes for the previous party to exit our room. We were told we could have an extra 15 minutes in the room, ourselves, but they ended up kicking us out at the original time.   - When we made the reservation, we got one of the smaller rooms and were told we could fit 12 - 13 comfortably in that room. Um...this is a bit of a fabrication. We were crammed in there (thankfully we only had a group of 10). The booth only seats 8, and they had folding chairs for extra people, but those people have to either sit with their back to the karaoke screen or block the door (and therefore move every time the server needs to enter the room).   - The song books are a bit cumbersome since they are multilingual and poorly organized. Instead of being alphabetical by song, it would be better to have them alpha by artist (especially since a lot of the song titles are misspelled and therefore possibly in the wrong alpha order).  So, a few minor complaints - but overall a fun time. I love the private room experience and I have to say it's a relief not too put up with prima donna karaoke participants or snooty KJs!",

Also if you park in the parking garage the parking is really cheap. Only 5 bucks that is great for the city.

HAPPY 27th BARFDAY STEVE! Thanks for the Tuesday hangover! *evil eye*  While waiting for Milo to open we decided to grab some drinks at Playground. We ordered several Yogurt Soju and Chamisul Soju (green bottle). Soju is similar to vodka but a little bit sweeter.   The Yogurt Soju is my fav as it has a creamy consistency with a tangy sweet flavor. Be forewarned, soju is a C-R-E-E-P-E-R. You may not feel anything for a while, then the next minute. BAM, you're blasted!  While we were downing shots, we got hungry and Jun came to the rescue. He gave us complimentary corn cheese (like cream of corn topped with melted mozzarella cheese), fish cakes and kimchi which are all part of the complimentary banchans when you order dinner. After going into town like savages, he kindly gave us a platter of mozzarella sticks and fries on the house; super sweet of him.   After everyone was nicely buzzed we went to Milo next door, only to come back to Playground 15 minutes later. Yes, we were hungry drunks.   F O O D As a disclaimer, the food did taste better because half the table was drunk.   *BIBIM MANDOO: Spicy Dumplings Filled w/ Pork - 4 STARS Jun brought us a platter of the bibim mando, Korean fried potstickers tossed with a spicy cabbage slaw on the house! The mandoo's skin was perfectly crisp and the pork filling was savory and juicy. The slaw was crunchy and had a nice fiery kick.   *HAEMUL PAJEON: Seafood Pancake- 4.5 STARS One of the BEST pajeon's in SF. Unlike other restaurants, Playground's pajeon was perfectly crisp throughout and not soggy. The bits of squid was nice and tender and not chewy. The soy vinegar sauce gave it a zing.  *KYOCHON: Fried Chicken Wings - 4 STARS The fresh-out-of-the-fryer wings were fried to a golden brown. Super crunchy on the outside and succulently moist and juicy on the inside, I wanted the whole platter to myself.   *KIMCHI BOKKEUMBAP: Kimchi Fried Rice - 4 STARS The rice was infused with the kimchi juices imparting a tangy kick while still maintaining an al-dente texture. The over-easy egg with the runny egg yolk added a deliciously creamy decadence.  *JJOHL MYUN: Cold Spicy Noodles - 4 STARS The cold spicy noodles had a nice toothsome chew with a fresh crispness from the cucumbers.   *KALBI: Korean BBQ Short Ribs - 3.5 STARS I'm a kalbi whore and though the kalbi was thick and succulent, it was missing that quintessential grilled char marks to give it smokiness. \u00a0  *BUDAE JJIGAE: Ramen Noodles in Spicy Broth w/ Sausage, Spam &amp; Ham - 3 STARS Served tableside on burner, the budae jjigae is a Korean stew of ramen noodles with a hodge podge of \u00a0meats. Perfect for a cold winter night, as it's comforting, hot and spicy. It was however, my least favorite dish of the night though as the meats tasted very processed and artificial.   S E R V I C E JUN ROCKS! From the moment we walked in to when we left (and came back), Jun was there to tend to our every drunken need.  He was very friendly, attentive, and down-to-earth. One of my friends wanted another bowl of the complimentary Korean Egg Drop soup and instead of just bringing a bowl, he asked the chef to make us an entire pot of it...on the house again! Awesome.   A M B I A N C E / D E C O R Contemporary and dark with K-Pop music videos playing on the big screen. There are 3 private karaoke rooms upstairs ($~30/hr). They also serve food and alkie to you in the private rooms.   P A R K I N G Street parking. There's also a parking garage across the street which closes at 2:30 AM on weeknights and 3:00 AM on weekends.   It's not very often that I've received such awesome service from an Asian restaurant. Jun totally made our night. Though he's allergic to alkie, I made him promise to do a shot with us when we come back to Playground. Jun, we're holding you to this! :)   GOM BAE!",

The octopus bokkum was nice and spicy and we tried two different styles of soondea (bokkum and regular) as well as the chopjae. I have had better Korean food but the entertainment (k-pop videos) kept my attention.   I'm usually not impressed with restaurants that have TV blasting, but I could not stop watching these Korean music videos. I was mesmerized by this flamboyant gay boy group and I thought \"wow Korea has come a long way.\" Living in Phoenix kind of shelters you from what's going on in Korea in regard to pop culture so it was \"educational\" for me to watch these videos.   We also ordered the 1.6 Liter OB that came in a plastic bottle and a large carafe of lychee soju. Boy was that soju sweet! Not my favorite but the trashy OB beer made the night. Overall, a great place to take a group of friends for dinner/entertainment.",

I love korean people!!   Located upstairs right across from the Japantown center! $30 karaoke rooms! \u00a0It tends to be a bit small for super large groups though!  Played the Titanic game and flick the bottle cap games several times!  Yogurt soju beats Pineapple soju + OB Beer.  Complimentary soju bottle on the house!   Supposedly we were getting too rowdy and noisy so a group of koreans next to us told us to TONE IT DOWN.. we were all like eh?!?!?! It is a korean lounge... we were so confused but alcohol didn't stop us!  Janet our waitress was awesome!! She even offered me a cup of froyo with cereal at the end of my visit to eat while i drive back home to san jose! It was so sweet of her! How could i deny some frozen yogurt?!?! It was a good balance of creamy and tarty.. perfect to wake me up from the buzz i was trying to get rid of!",

This is something I always get when I come here. I like to go with friends because I hate mixing the black bean sauce noodles and serving it myself haha. Other dishes I like are the dumpling/rice cake soup, regular dumplings and even though it isn't a real dish, the corn and cheese plate. It's a bit pricey but I always leave happily satisfied so it's totally worth it. They're only open for dinner, so if you come here during the weeknights and early enough on Fridays, it's easy to get a table but otherwise expect a wait because it gets packed fast. Service is good, sometimes a bit slow, but the people who work there are always friendly. There's one girl that's always working when my friends and I come here and even though she doesn't know us by name she'll come up to us and make small talk before she takes our order. I'm just sad this place isn't open for lunch.",

Soju was on the stronger side so not as fruity as I would like.   Service was good for how busy the place was.

Minus the fact that I got punched in the ear and four days later it still hurts =(  I really wasn't expecting much when I heard we were going to a karaoke place in Japantown but it ended up being amazing.  The bottom is a bar/restaurant and you go up the stairs to the karaoke rooms. The rooms are $30/hour with a 2 hour minimum. The rooms have kind of low ceilings so if you're any taller than 6 feet that might be a problem. They have a million songs to choose from and its really easy to work the remote song chooser thing. Later in the night we randomly realized we could turn the lights off \u00a0and it becomes some dark room with crazy lights like you're at a fucking rave or something.   The food is really expensive for what it is but I think they gave us a free plate of food at the end of the night since it showed up out of no where but we were so drunk we didn't really eat a lot of it. If it was free then I feel really bad. Sorry!!!! I would stick with the Asian food since I think the American food is all frozen and way over priced. Its something like $13 for some fries and mozzarella sticks.   The tab ended up being something ridiculous with each bottle of Grey Goose being $130. Every brand of vodka costs the same amount though but I swear it started tasting worse and worse as the night went on. Shouldn't it taste better and better?! I also tried sojou for the first time and it tasted okay. I read in another review it wasn't authentic tasting enough but everyone seemed to like it.   The service is amazing. The bartender was the nicest person I've ever met! Holy shit she was so sweet and gorgeous and she had the biggest engagement ring I've ever seen. I kept complimenting her on it haha.   Street parking was easy to find and there was a good amount of people there for a Wednesday night. Oh and you can also just call and order from the phone in the room and they'll bring it all up to you! Super easy.  I'm not the biggest fan of Japantown but Playground definitely makes up for it.

I've there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that soju with korean people often leads to blackouts. Many many blackouts.  We sat down and ordered a bottle of soju, and KFC (Korean Fried Chicken). The soju came out first and we started drinking. Shortly after, the banchan came out. There were quite a few dishes. This place had a lot of them, probably equivalent to the korean bbq places in LA's K-Town. In southbay, cheese corn costs money. Here, it's included.  The fried chicken came out next. When the fried chicken came out, they cleared the ban chan since they were mostly empty, and brought out more without us even asking for it.  So about this KFC... if I didn't know any better, I would say the sauce was more of a Chinese sauce. The chicken itself was decent. Overall, I much prefer southbay's 99 Chicken, or Irvine's BBQ Chicken. I didn't particularly enjoy the sauce here too much.   Well, that's all we really came for, so after we finished the chicken and soju, we called it a night.  This place is good for late night munchies and I enjoyed myself here. This place kind of has a dirtiness to it that I don't think I could appreciate if I were sober. Thus, late night, and only late night. Maybe I'll be back for the noraebang.",

We got charged over $300 for the night, then the owner charged us $30 for bringing an outside beverage (costing way more than the beverage), when no other karaoke place does that. Lost my friend's jacket, then called the cops when he refused to be charged $30 more when they lost his jacket. Who does that? Call the cops on a customer who couldn't find a jacket??!? After all this, she yells at us and tells us we are not welcome ever again. Why? We didn't yell/make a scene/throw up on her. We weren't even drunk. We just didn't like being charged while they lost our belongings. Just because we're not korean and don't speak korean, doesn't mean you have to act discriminatory towards us! Do yourself a favor and frequent a friendlier, cheaper, and cleaner place than Playground. You'll end the night on a happier note.",

It's a Korean style mix drink that'll creep up on you! And we usually get their fried chicken!!! OMG! Bomb chicken! We also come here because we like their complimentary corn cheese. Playground always has a good crowd of people with good music. It's hard to get good service here due to the fact that they're always so busy. The owner is so young, nice and pretty. She gave us water dumplings on the house and sometimes the waiters give us soft yogurt on the house. \u00a0Price wise, I feel like they are slightly overpriced, but it's worth it \u00a0because they are very generous when I go with friends. =)",

    "review_text": "A long time staple in Japantown for karaoke, dinner, and casual hangouts, I've been to Playground regularly over the past few years.   My friends and I however, had a sub-par karaoke experience last Saturday evening (on 3/1/14) that I just have to make a comment that I don't think I'll ever come back here in my own right.  We got a reservation for 1 hour of karaoke (from 9pm- 10pm) for our group of 7 people. We got there early so were hanging out in the bar area since around 8:30pm. Come 9pm, I started looking around for the host so we can prepare to walk over to the karaoke room, since that's when our reservation technically started. However, there were no hosts in sight. 5 minutes later, still no one approached our party to alert us that our room would be ready. at 9:10pm, we see a group similar to our size come down the steps. I figured that would probably be our room, and finally locating a host, I approached him to ask, to which he replied \"give me a couple of minutes to clean up, I'll grab you guys.\"   Okay.  At 9:15pm, we were finally rounded and escorted to our karaoke room. So I figured they're just used to running slightly behind schedule with the reservations, and that we'd have until 10:15pm.   Nope, not the case.   At 9:45pm, our host said we had about 15 more minutes left, to which I replied \"but we started 15 minutes late.\" He rudely said \"no, you guys were seated in here at 9:05pm\" which I KNEW was incorrect. Since the rest of my friends were drunk and singing away, I told the host \"I was watching the clock when we sat down. I'm sober\" to which he snapped \"I am too. I'm working\"  That's not how you retain customers. And for that reason, I'm taking our karaoke fun elsewhere.",

We wound our way across the city and ended up here.  The hospitality alone gets five stars. We sat at the bar and were lucky enough to be served by Janet, the owner, who responded to our \"anything but intestines\" food order with two incredible entrees -- sauteed beef with onions, and the best sweet and sour shrimp I've ever had -- plus corn+cheese and some Korean appetizers. I eyed the Jurassic fruit plate next to me; we should have skipped dinner and gotten here earlier.  After a few minutes we noticed the private karaoke booths overhead. All booked for the evening but good to know there's another dimension to this place beyond good food, service and atmosphere.  Thanks for a great cap to the evening...I shall return.",

The food and drinks are never going to be stellar and the sound systems never going to be as good as a stage system but its still great fun for a private party. \u00a0And of course you get to sing a hell of a lot more than an open mic place.  the english song selection is decent, but get's upgraded to great if you go with a group that can sing Japanese and Korean. \u00a0Festa has some korean songs but not many.  I can't stand the remote control. \u00a0I know I'm asian and supposed to be good with this stuff but I still don't know how to work that thing and I've been there 3 times. \u00a0I think the problem is its drunk proof - meaning you have to be sober to operate it. \u00a0that and one of the controllers is written in Korean? japanese? I can't tell.  As far as private rooms go this is probably the best bet in town - I know there are rooms with no alcohol, but nobody's getting me in a room for a few hours with no booze and singing.  if you're planning on going during prime time - get as many people as you can to go with you or they will pimp out the room to a higher bidder.  The highlight of my visits there was bumping into one of the Mythbuster guys in the room next to ours - awesome.",

Everything kinda looked the same with the same colored red sauce. Most dishes were decent and affordable and the corn with cheese side dish and the other many side dishes were $15 per person, lots of leftovers, it was a fun playground.

They ask that we meet a food/beverage minimum of $20/person - 4 dishes, 3 pitchers, and a large yogurt soju did the trick for the nine of us.   The big problem, though, was that our group was late for our 7pm reservation and so we asked the host if we could extend our reservation through 9:30pm. He said yes since the next group wasn't til 10. At 9pm, a he was no longer working and a different staff wasn't aware of the extension promised to us. Then they explained that they wrote down the next party's reservation wrong so the next group was actually coming at 9pm. We kindly left the room, ate our food on a ledge, and paid the bill.

The soju was WEAK I frequent alot of korean bars and this one was by far the weakest mix and we told him to mix it strong too! The food was pretty good, we got the bulgogi, popcorn chicken, fried oysters, calimari, and kim chee fried rice.  The reason why this place only got 3 stars is because the SERVICE IS HORRENDOUS. We had to wave our arms like crazies to get his attention and the waiters took forever to respond and get us togo boxes or the check.

We got a 7-8pm spot and was required to put a credit card on reserve. we got kicked out right away at 8pm :( Be aware of their minimums:  6 person min must spend at least $20 on food and drinks/person (even if only 5 show up, you pay for 6) $30/hr for the karaoke room  good food. yummy flavored soju. service was great (you use a phone to order). definitely would come back again because it's the only karaoke place that let's you eat and drink in the room! although i'm not sure it's such a good idea now, since i almost choked while singing :D",

Playground is a bit pricey, but not bad as it honors reservations and accommodates large groups relatively well. \u00a0A decent backup or alternative to Do Re Mi if you are hankering to do some karaoke in the Japantown area with a few bucks to spare...or enough friends who don't sing but like to tag along (*points and smiles* THAT person knows what I'm talking about!)  3.5 stars",

They sure know how to deliver the spice...something I have missed in some other Korean restaurants. We started off with the seafood pancake and it was tasty! I then had the spicy Playground Seafood Noodles and they were savory, but the squid was overcooked.   We brought our own wine, so I didn't taste the soju cocktails, but the bartender was certainly busy the entire time we were there making them. I wish more ethnic restaurants had better wine lists, but what can ya do.   What cracked me up was the videos they had playing...it was like Korean MTV and I guess trying to inspire people to go upstairs and sing karaoke. I'm sure after plenty of soju cocktails that would be no problem by many!  Don't expect service to be attentive, so relax and just enjoy the food.",

Looking through the menu, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. \u00a0That is usually the case, but this time, we seriously over ordered for 3 people! \u00a0It was leftovers galore.  Their side dishes were good, but nothing quite memorable. \u00a0They provided corn with melted cheese, which was atypical as a side dish.  We ordered up Soju and Jun, who was one of the waiters, hooked us up with an additional round of Soju. \u00a0The Yogurt Soju was the best! \u00a0Thank you!  I loved the black bean noodles! \u00a0It was saucy and mixed with chunks of chopped beef. \u00a0Must order!  Their Garlic Fries were spot on. \u00a0I like the crushed up, textured garlic mixed in with the batch of fries.  Their Bulgoki Beef needs improvement. \u00a0It was not marinated well enough and the onions were not grilled to a great brown color that I tend to admire for grilled onions. \u00a0Avoid.   As for the Seafood Pancake, it was a bit too doughy, but I like the well-sized chewy octopus inside the pancake!  Last, but not least, the Sweet and Sour Chicken dish was fried well with a crisp and had a good sticky sauce to it. \u00a0It was feasible. \u00a0  There is Korean music and video in the background and the atmosphere provides a laid back, dining vibe.  Come here to play! \u00a0After all, it is a Playground!",

It wasn't crowded and the karaoke hadn't started yet, but not to worry there's plenty of Korean music videos on the big screen TVs! We ordered a bulgogi and japchae which was plenty for two people. They bring you the regular Korean small plates - I have to say I missed the potato salad and the various types of kim chi - but you do get this yummy creamed corn with cheese that I could have nibbled on the whole night.  I'll have to go back during the karaoke rush hour. It's not quite the same quality of Korean BBQ places in San Jose, but it'll do when I need my Korean fix or my husband needs his karaoke.",

I love the atmosphere here: the K-Pop, and the overall energy of this place makes it a great environment to kick back with some flavored Soju (the yogurt one is still by far my favorite one) and O.B. with some friends. They also offer karaoke upstairs, but I've never actually tried it.  The food is absolutely delicious. I particularly enjoy the fried squid plate with the special sauce. Excellent flavor, big portions and it tastes great with the drinks. Another bonus is the complimentary dishes they give out like the cheese-corn.  The only drawback is the bill you get at the end of the night, but I don't mind paying a premium for great food, great drinks and a great atmosphere during the party hours of the night (10pm -2am).

There's nothing like channeling your inner divo or diva and belting out your favorite songs in front of a group of friends or strangers.  The thing about karaoke is that everyone has their one \"go-to\" song; mine being Boyz II Men's \"End of the Road.\" There's nothing better than when the chorus hits and you just are so moved by the words that you get on one knee to sing your heart out. \"It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to youuuuu.\"  The requirements of a good karaoke place is privacy, good snack foods, variety of drink options and a thick and current song book.   Playground satisfies all those requirements. You can make reservations for a private room with all your friends in attendance. Soju flows by the bottle and definitely provides you with enough liquid courage if you are feeling a little shy. There are enough Korean food options to satisfy your drunk munchies. Plus they have a pretty current song book; they have a great mix of new songs and oldies.

Overall, the place gets pretty busy and serves up above average Korean Bar Foods. \u00a0Their Soju and beer are well priced but their call drinks are definitely on the pricey side (I think Goose on the Rocks set me back $10 or $11). \u00a0They have a good amount of seating but I reco coming with a larger group and sticking around a bit to enjoy some Soju, Beer and Korean music (+ the music videos). \u00a0Upstairs are several Karaoke rooms you can reserve (min order is required). \u00a0Good place for to pre-party before hitting the clubs or you can just stick around and chill (stays open till 2AM Thu-Sat).",

On my first night here I had some kind of noodle with seafood stir-fry. It was yumm-o. But if you're drunk on soju...that won't matter.   minus one point for it being a swing-less, slide-less, jungle gym-less playground. And if ur not into the whole Asian crowd-thing...then steer clear. Very packed with drunkies on Saturday night.",

I guess its fate that my 500th review goes to a restaurant where I've had some of the most memorable (not all favorable) experiences.   If the party doesn't start at Playground, it most always ends here. You can always expect large crowds of people looking to get smizzled on the weekends. The large flat-screen TVs and projector play a mix of Korean pop and various chart-topping music videos to keep the mood fun and entertaining.  The waiters always do a great job of tending to all the drunk, belligerent tables while maintaining their cool. They're quick to clean up and good with accommodating all party sizes.  A typical night for my friends and I goes something like this:  - Get seated. Immediately order 3-10 bottles of soju, depending on how large our party is, along with 1-3 pitchers of beer. - Order french fries. - Order doobu kimchi. - Order fried chicken wings. - Someone always gets a diet coke. - Depending on how drunk we already are, order Budae jjigae (spicy meat stew) or Odeng tang (fish cake soup). - If my cousin is here, order a pitcher of yogurt soju.  Sure, our bill at one point came out to $1500...(it was an unprecedented amount of people...) but that's what happens when the bottles keep coming and the fun keeps poppin. Until someone throws up...then the party is over...sometimes.",

The service was pretty good because after all they have to deal with whole a lot of drank people. I'll be back to finish off with our Soju taste testing.

Definitely on point when it comes to value. Nothing super special or unique, just good, solid Korean food.  Their karaoke set up is great here, plenty of room to fit a large group (I think we had about 20) comfortably. They also let us bring our food and drinks up with us, which is nice because then we didn't have to wait for everyone to finish eating and could keep drinking the rest of the night!!

It wasn't too crowded inside when we came in, and the waitress was friendly. \u00a0Extensive menu, and I saw that they had..... soju cocktails!!! Yay-yuh, but we'd have to save that for a group's night out. \u00a0I ordered the seafood champong (I can't ever resist a spicy seafood noodle dish) and the bf had a omrice (omelette on top of fried rice smothered in ketchup).  Prior to the food, we had complimentary miso soup (with tons of green onion, just the way i like it), small plates of pan-chan, and a plate of.....corn cheese!!! My god was that addicting. \u00a0Corn? good. Cheese? gooooood. Put the two together? DAYAM gooooood.  The champon was SUCH a good deal for lunch at $7.95. LOADED with seafood (squid, 5 HUGE pieces of shrimp, mussels, and a whole baby crab), veggies (onions, zucchini, carrots, cabbage) in a oh so yummy spicy red broth and chewy chewy noodles. \u00a0I could've split this with the bf and we would've been good cuz he ended up eating like 1/4 of the omrice and boxed it to go. \u00a0I didnt taste it cuz it had ham and I'm trying to avoid meats but it looked yummy enough. \u00a0They also have a lot of other choices for lunch specials under $10 like bento box style lunches with korean bbq, fish, tonkatsu, jap-chae, bi bim bap, etc. \u00a0They also have your typical Korean drinking food (seafood pancakes, fried chicken, cheesy chicken, dduk bok ki, stir fry seafood + veggies, etc)...  Overall the experience was really good and the lunch was awesome and really delicious. \u00a0Total bill for the two of us came to $17 and we had a table full of food. \u00a0 I can't wait to come back at night for some late night munchies and soju drinks.

This place is awesome to have a great time and be obnoxiously loud with your friends and everyone around you wouldn't care too much. There are lots of drinking games you can play here and they promote it by providing the games!   Service: Great service! They always come by checking to make sure you're ok and if you need more drinks/foods or whatever!  Food: The food here was just ok. One thing I did remember is that they serve food pretty late and that's just perfect to soak up the drunkenness.  Drinks: Soju - all flavors of it in carafes. Beer - Hite, Korean beer of choice.  Overall:  This is a great place to come hang out and have a bunch of drinks with your friends. There are karaoke rooms upstairs available to go sing your heart out and have some more drinks! For a party of 10 and pounding down approximately 20 bottles of Hite, 8 carafes of soju, lots of food, and a few hours of karaoke was around $550 with gratuity included. Having a blast and a night to remember for a lifetime, priceless!   There are cops driving around here late at night. Just be smart about it, we had designated driver.",

When I'm craving Korean food late night, I usually go to Arang because it's the cheapest. This place isn't as cheap, but their dishes are humongous so it's a fair trade. It's definitely a lot hipper, trendier, diverser (I know that's not a word) than the old days of Sonic, but it's still just as loud. Service was polite - just what I expected from a typical Korean restaurant. I think I'll be coming back here for more.  JONASAPPROVED!",

This trendy place is located right smack in the heart of J-Town, and it is normally really crowded at night. The decor contributes to the ambiance of the place, as there are small and big tables, a bar area, and continual K-pop music videos playing on several big screens in the background. What better way to hang out than eat, drink, and watch sexy Korean girls dancing on the big screens in the background?  I have been here several times, and the food and service has always been great. The seafood pancakae (panjeon), seafood tofu soup (soon dubu), and corn smothered in cheese are some of the great dishes that can be had here.  Did I mention that the Soju here is awesome too?  Bring a large group of friends here to pre-party (before your rendezvous with your other friends in downtown SF) and I guarantee you'll have a night filled with delish food, great music, and awesome people!",

It also helped that the staff accommodated 30+ loud and hungry Yelpers hopped up on yogurt soju shots with style and grace.  The food is pretty good here and we had an impressive spread, including kalbi, soondae, Korean Fried Chicken, fried shrimp, soldier's stew (with ramen, veggies, hot dogs, and a ham-like meat that tasted like vienna sausages). The banchan was fresh and very tasty, but there wasn't any pickled daikon, which was a bummer.  But the main attraction at Playground is the norebang (a.k.a. karaoke), and Yelpers dominated their three upstairs rooms for most of the night. Song selection is dominated by Korean songs, but there was impressive collection of English songs, as well, especially from modern rock artists like Radiohead, Muse and Weezer. Hip hop selection was seriously lacking, but the fact that I could break out my own rendition of \"The Bends\" more than made up for that.  Because of Yelp, I've eaten more Korean food in the last three months than I have in my entire life. It's been a delicious and educational experience, and I'm glad Playground could fulfill both my culinary and attention-whoring desires.",

    "review_text": "My friend was hosting his birthday dinner/karaoke here so a bunch of us were there to celebrate with him.  Reservations were made pretty early so we were accommodated accordingly. My friend ordered the food and the soju so I didn't look at the menu. I know there were plenty of spicy shrimp platters, one or two orders of spicy beef, and one seafood pancake. We also had lychee soju, kiwi soju, yogurt soju, and mango soju.   Food was good although they were all made in varying degrees of spiciness. I think that was an accident because at one point, my mouth was on fire. I didn't think that the food was insanely special, but I liked it. I don't remember the prices because I don't go here enough, but I remember that most dishes here cost $12 or so. With that in mind, I do believe the food is overpriced. Four dishes would already cost $50 and I know that way more was ordered.  The soju is good. Each flavor was great, but my favorite was probably yogurt. Soju is a must. I believe it's $13 for a whole bottle or something.   Karaoke was fun while I was there. They have a huge song list and in different languages. The rooms are cool in the way that it's closed off.   I don't know the details of karaoke room prices here, but I will review based on my understanding of what happened that night. We were given a room and charged for three hours. While you're in that room, you have to order a certain amount of food. The friend that organized the event was under the impression/was told that the food from the dinner would transfer over to the room...but it didn't. So they had to order more food.   I left before they needed to order more food but I was told later that night that the total cost of everything (dinner, drinks, karaoke, more drinks, more food) came out to be $600 because of a misunderstanding.   I was also told that birthday boy tried to have another friend's card cancelled so he could pay in their place. He was denied this because the person ringing them up told them they'd get in trouble. I don't understand this.   Has potential but ultimately disappointed everyone because of shady service. The birthday boy was so upset, he told me he was never going to go back. I don't blame him!

Aside from the Yoju, which looks like milk, goes down like milk, but will eff your sh*t up like Everclear, Playground is a karaoke/drinking/dining establishment that harkens back to the neon-loving 80s. The space is cold and cozy all at the same time and the decor manages to be cafeteria meets massage parlor. The karaoke rooms are upstairs, but I bet you can do a lot more than karaoke in them if you know what I'm saying.  All in all, not entirely my cup of tea, but just fine for a birthday karaoke party for 40 of your most embarassing friends. It's a good thing I'm not a regular here or they'd probably recognize me next time I came. And they'd give me that \"your-friends-stole-our-tambourines-and-fake-\u00adplants\" look. Then they'd ask me how my friends who left sobbing are doing. And then they'd ask if I cared to pay the rest of the Yoju bill we walked out on after our last visit. What a nightmare that would be!  But seriously, Four Stars for gracious service and that delicious Yoju. In fact, we're going to add a splash of Manischewitz, rename it YoJew, and serve it as our signature cocktail (in a martini glass, natch) when somebody finally breaks down and marries me :)",

The bottom floor is a restaurant/bar where the management tries to cram as many people as they can to serve food. \u00a0I'm sure it's a fire hazard but who cares?! \u00a0You're going to have fun regardless!  There were +20 people total, and I sat at a table with 9 of us and we ordered:  -Various flavored soju: $13 for a small carafe, $25 for large. \u00a0Yum! \u00a0They might be girly flavored but it will creep up on you if you drink enough! -Bulgogi: can't go wrong with this dish. -Dolsot bibimbap: hot stone pot rice, again, hard to mess up anything with crispy rice. -Japchae: Sweet potato flour cellophane noodles, stir fried with various veggies. \u00a0Plenty to share. \u00a0Very tasty. -Kalbi: beef short ribs. -La bokki: (ra bokki) this was supposed to be ramen noodles mixed with duk bokki (thick rice cakes) in a savory red sauce. \u00a0This was my fave, I *love* the chewiness of rice cakes and the sauce that it was cooked with was so good that I would spoon it onto some rice and eat it that way too (carb overload much?). \u00a0Only complaint was that there was no ramen noodles! \u00a0  Everything came with your typical ban chan like kimchi, bean sprouts, etc.  With all that, plus 2 bowls of rice and 2-3 carafes of soju, our bill came out to be a little less than $20 per person, tip included. \u00a0The hostess was really friendly and so were the servers, albeit extremely busy. \u00a0There were at least 2 other people celebrating birthdays that night too, so the whole atmosphere was really festive with lots of singing and chugging.  Afterwards, we made our way upstairs to the karaoke room. \u00a0I don't know how we packed that many people into what felt like a 6x6 room, but it happened. \u00a0The charge was something like $20 minimum per person, so I'm sure they made a killing off us; nevertheless it was fun.  Bottom line: go with a bunch of friends, grab a bite and drink downstairs then karaoke the night away. \u00a0Just be sure to make reservations first!",

(It's also good for your digestive system!) \u00a0Warning: \u00a0Don't try to to make yogurt Soju from some Yoplait mess. \u00a0LOL. \u00a0Believe me. \u00a0A friend of mine tried with horrible consequences.  That corn cheese stuff is disgusting AND delicious at the same time. \u00a0You should try it! \u00a0As for service, it's decent. \u00a0It might take awhile for them to notice that you need some service, but they spot you, they are pretty nice and get the stuff to you as soon as they can. \u00a0The crowd was also pretty chill. \u00a0Make a friend in the long bathroom line! :D",

    "review_text": "EDIT: This is more like 4.5 stars, but should really get bumped up to that 5th because of the great friendly service we had! Even after we paid the bill :) -------------------------- Playground was the venue for the first unofficial Norebang Night, in which this restaurant/bar/private-room-karaoke joint morphed into Club Steph. I do have to declare that it was a SUCCESS! \u00a0Not only because of the fabulous Yelpers who came out to eat, drink, and sing...but because Playground was so kind and accomodating to our rambunctuous group! \u00a0The owner Lisa and her niece Janet were wonderful! It also helps when your right-hand-man is Korean and related to the owners :) So the deets of the night and some helpful bits:  Dinner for 20? \u00a0Delicious and out in a flash. Highlights: the Korean Fried Chicken whose skin is a little bit more battered than other Korean joints, the Sun Dae Bokkum (blood sausage), that soup w/ the sausage/luncheon meat/veggies/ramen, this tofu w/ pork belly. Sorry I cannot be more useful than this. Let's just say that they do a decent job w/ food.   Drinks - yogurt soju? Check. Fruit flavors like strawberry and kiwi? Check. The usual Koeran beers like Hite and OB? Check. Bottle service? Check.   Karaoke! Upstairs there are 3 rooms of varying sizes (think S, M, &amp; L) to accomodate their \"capacity\" of 37. Please note to you norebang-newbies. This is definitely Korean style karaoke because:  1) The remote controllers are all in Korean. You will have to use your ingenuity to figure them out.  2) The system and the song books are the kind where they get a new batch of songs periodically and just include new inserts. This means that navigating the book is a little tricky. *Tip* In the book, there's a large English section, but there are also English songs at the end of each section of new Korean songs. 3) The roofs of the rooms are kind of slanted; maybe they figured Asian people are short anyway. I guess they never met Ed.  But dude, there were plenty of karaoke standards and favorites: Bon Jovi, Journey, Madonna, disco, Britney, Xtina, Mariah, CELINE!!!, and surpisingly plenty of 90s rock. \u00a0And if there is one single reason for you to go to Playground for your karaoke needs, it is this:  In my research, this is the ONLY private room karaoke joint in the city that has a bar. At $30/hour, this is a pretty good deal...and if you want to plan your own little party, just call them up and they are more than willing to work something out. Playground is definitely a great place to rock the mic and PLAY!!!",

Since my friend can't really handle alcohol so we just ordered a bottle of fruit-flavored soju, a diet cook, and a seafood pancake.  Like most Korean places, it came with a generous section of kimchi and various appetizer, which were really tasty. I was particularly fond of the corn and cheese they provided for us; it was really yummy!  It's a bar, nonetheless, and I have to rate their drinks right? The favored soju, honestly, tastes like some medicine for kids. I've had much better tasting ones elsewhere so I won't recommend their favored soju cocktails.  It was a Tuesday evening that we visited so the place wasn't crowded. But they had the music on so loud that me and my friend had such a hard time hearing each other. I suppose that's something they should consider improving?",

We all got drunk on the tasty yogurt soju (tasted like dessert, and we took turns doing refill patrol) and the karaoke selections included entire English, Japanese and Korean sections. Unfortunately the remote control was in Korean so our drunk asses had to figure that out very carefully and despite the instructions posted on the wall, we couldn't figure out how to change the pitch and stuff.

Later they realized they misread the schedule. \u00a0That was strike 1.  The other thing was the room size. \u00a0The room for 20 is really more like a tight fit for about 15. \u00a0The 16 of us squeezed in like sardines...  The room was also incredibly stuffy and hot.  Enough bad, here's the good.  The food is good, the Soju is GREAT (just go for the $18 bottle!) and the song selection actually isn't that bad. \u00a0I read from others that it is lacking, but it worked for us and we ended up having a great time.  The room was $30 an hour, and the rule is if you stay for over 2 hours, then it is a $20 minimum per person. \u00a0It actually isn't bad at all cash wise.  Also, the staff was extremely kind and quick. \u00a0Janet was very very helpful once they realized the mix up. \u00a0All in all we had a great time, and I would go back, but knowing now a few more things about it, definitely don't invite over 15 people and don't wear anything warm.",

The potstickers and chicken that i did have, however, were AWESOME. Seriously, that chicken was sooooo good. I will definitely be coming back and ordering both of those dishes again.

Some people knock the food because it's not the best Korean food ever, but the atmosphere and service (not to mention downing several pitchers of flavored soju with friends) more than make up for it.   Each time, my friends and I have ordered some standard Korean fare (bulgogi, dolsot bibimbap, jap chae, etc.), along with several pitchers of flavored soju (flavors include yogurt, lychee, pineapple, mango, peach, blueberry, apple and more). One of the great things about this place is that, along with the traditional complimentary small plates, they also give you unlimited cheese corn (layers of cheese melted on top of corn).   During our most recent visit, we ordered 5 pitchers of soju and they gave us a 6th on the house; furthermore, we told them that we really like the cheese corn, and the guy kept bringing out more for us.  This place also has private karaoke rooms, though I've yet to do that. I'm sure it would be a lot of fun with soju flowing in the room.

Popcorn Chicken - $6 This was actually my favorite dish. \u00a0Really crunchy and the portions are big.  Ojinguh Twigim (tempura squid) - $7.5, not bad either, but it was mostly the fried flour here. The sauce that comes with it was pretty flavorful and probably the best of any tempura soy sauce. This dish is good to much on for a group, because it was definitely too much just for the two of us.   Overall, LOVE their happy hour deal.

Getting seated was very easy. Initial wait staff interaction was very satisfying, a friendly server came quickly and volunteered what he thought was the best dish on the menu--#17, deep-fried shrimp. We also ordered the bulgogi, and a noodle dish. The initial side dishes that I love Korean restaurants for were, here, meagre, only 3 dishes, and included a cheesy corn dish I am not familiar with from other Korean restaurants and tasted so-so. We ordered strawberry soju, which was as delicious as other Yelp reviews have stated.  When our food was delivered we quickly found it to be astonishly bland, a first in Korean dining. The bulgogi was lightly spiced and very dry. We ordered some extra kimchi to help liven it up, but by this time the waiter was preoccupied with setting up a large table and completely forgot. The fried shrimp touted by our server tasted like an entree off of a cheap Chinese diner menu, okay but for Korean food highly disappointing. The noodle dish was good, though unexceptional.  The volume of the restaurant began to rise dramatically as a few large parties arrived. I didn't mind this, having been clued in by the reviews that noise and brouhaha was de rigeur for this restaurant. When wanting to leave it was difficult getting the staff's attention to bring our check, an annoying postscript to a forgettable, disappointing meal.

    "review_text": "I guess I'm trying to start a family/cousin tradition where every time we get together, we partake in a night of karaoke. So when my East Coast cousins came out West, I chose Playground for our fun.  While the place is more of a restaurant, the three karaoke rooms they do have are quite comfortable. There's a large room big enough to accommodate about 15 people and two other smaller rooms for parties of 6-8. The rooms could be a bit more ventilated as the act of karaoke really makes you work up a sweat.  Luckily, Playground serves a wonderful assortment of soju and beer to cool you off. The yogurt soju is delicious... it's like an alcoholic version of the little Asian yogurt drinks I drank as a child. Mmm...And they deliver it right to your room via phone call. You can order off the food menu too. The spicy fried chicken? Not bad not bad.  The selection of songs is pretty good. They have a variety of Top 40 and old school but I'm still forever searching for Bob Marley and/or Tears for Fears. But at least I got to sing along to Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" so I was a very happy camper.  So three hours of singing, an order of chicken, two beers and two carafes of soju came to $32.50 (tip included) per person in a group of six. Not horrible at all.  Here's a tip: Order some pitchers of hot tea to soothe the throat between songs.",

Yeah, that's what I thought ;P  Having never been in a private karaoke room, I was curious to see how the night would turn out. My cousin's girlfriend was celebrating her birthday so she had a reserved room till 1:15 a.m. and a bartender that would bring drinks to the room. It was super convenient to just telephone the bartenders, that are located on the main floor downstairs, and let them know what you needed - be it more drinks, food, napkins, etc.  Karaoke is pretty standard - they had a huge book, organized by song name, to pick music from. The tv's were huge, flat screens and they played random Korean music videos and shows while you were singing.   Overall, this place is a solid 3 stars. The bartenders were very attentive and speedy when it came to bringing whatever was needed to the room. The boy and I ordered a few drinks and they were pretty strong, so it's safe to say that they pour with a heavy hand.",

I suppose if you really want to sing to your friends but absolutely cannot muster the courage to sing at a bar, try it out. Better yet, go buy Rock Band for your Xbox.  The restaurant part of the event was OK, but I can't really imagine going here just for dinner. I'm betting there are better places to go for Korean foods.  Yes Soju is good.

Saturday rolls around and since most of us were a little late I called in a little earlier to see if they can hold our table until 8:30pm. We got there right on time but the hostess said she already gave half of our table to other customers. We finally got seated after 30 minutes. The owner was really nice, she kept apologizing for the wait and she even gave us a free bottle of green apple soju. So nice!!  The prices are a little high but come on now it's Korean Food...it's expected. I got the seafood pancake ($14.95) and couldn't even finish most of it. Everyone basically shared with one another so it was family style. Since it was my late birthday dinner we HAD to order soju.   Yogurt Soju (L) $25 Mango Soju (L) $25 Strawberry Soju (L) $25 Hite Beer (2) $12 each And Green Apple Soju (S) on the house  Yup I was pretty messed up after a few shots of flavored soju. Yogurt and Strawberry Soju is sooooo goood!!! It's a must order if you want to get your drink on. \u00a0  Flavored Soju:  apple blueberry kiwi lemon lychee mango orange peach  pineapple strawberry yogurt  Playground also has karaoke rooms on the 2nd level. $30 an hr.

I couldn't taste the alcohol at all! and also.. who the hell puts ice in their flavored soju.. i kept chucking down ice... The service was soo bad we didn't even finish our last bottle of bekseju, so when we got the check.. that charged us for an EXTRA bottle of it.. Luckily one our korean friend caught that!

I'm not sure if they did that for taste but it didn't work for me.   The squid tempura is so greasy and rubbery. Obviously it's not fresh squid. The batter is ok, could be better.   Garlic fries lack salt. Portions were really large for appetizers but that worked great for us.   The Soondubu was great though. Tasty and not too spicy.  Service - Our waiter was nice and very accommodating.   The place could use some better lighting.

The ceiling is slanted on one end, so you can easily bump your end. The karaoke tunes are pretty current though, with some new hits (Some Yeezy) and some of the classics. Our 2-hours wasn't really enough. The room actually has a phone down to the kitchen/bar so you can order your snacks and/or drinks without leaving the room.  The soju we had was crazy good. We started off with strawberry, then yogurt, and then finished off with at least 2-3 carafes of lychee. I think the lychee is the way to go. The soju hit everyone pretty hard, but it was damn tasty.  For snacks, we had the bulgogi, the korean fried chicken, and the garlic fries. All three were really good. The garlic fries tasted really good for some reason. The garlic is roasted I think and there's some sort of seasoning that makes it really good, maybe they sneak in some MSG? Whatever it is, we went for a second order.  our last few hours were at the bar, getting more snacks and drinking HITE.

The chicken kinda tasted like ging dou gwat (bbq flavored pork chops at a chinese restaurant). Their fried chicken and fried appetizer platter are good sobering up munchies. The atmosphere is pretty loud as korean music videos of 2ne1, snsd, super junior etc are always playing. Great place to play drinking games and they also have karaoke upstairs.

After all, karaoke is only possible with the help of liquid courage.  My biggest gripe would be the song selections. I wished the songs were a bit more updated and the song menus weren't so confusing to look through. I probably would have rated higher if the song selections had more variety and weren't so stale. By stale I mean songs only your parents would sing drunkenly to after mahjong in their living room. Mic and sound quality was mediocre.

Ordered: \u00a0fried chicken, kalbi, bulgogi, seafood pancake, seafood udon, beef japchae, house bean/meat sauce over noodle, and fried potsticker. Total incl gratuity: ~$200  Food is pretty good but prices were a little steep. \u00a0I guess I wasn't that surprised as Korean food tends to be on the pricier side. \u00a0We ordered an array of items and shared everything family style. \u00a0Of the items we ordered, I'd say the fried chicken, japchae, and house bean sauce over noodle were the most memorable. \u00a0The fried chicken had a nice glaze and the meat was moist. \u00a0Japchae was really sweet, saucy, and slippery - just the way I like it. \u00a0I really liked the house bean/meat sauce over noodle. \u00a0It was so yummy. \u00a0Definitely getting that for myself next time I'm back there. \u00a0Not impressed with the bulgogi as it was rather dry.  This is a good place with decent food to come chill with the \"homies\". \u00a0I've come here for karaoke on a few occasions in the past as well but it's been a while. \u00a0Since it's such a popular spot amongst the friends, I will be back, however I don't know that I'd come back craving any of the food except for that one noodle dish.",

    "review_text": "As you can tell from the Playground's metadata, the best times to stop in are on the weekend. I went on a quiet Monday, but considering I pretty much loathe people in general, everything worked out just fine because it was comfortable and empty.  Stopped in with some friends after class in J-town--around 9:30pm--to have a few beers and be on my merry way. A few more friends decided to join and expand my mind with a variety of soju and Korean foods that I would be hard-pressed to recite or even pronounce correctly. Of note was the yogurt soju, cheese and corn plate, and \"ribs\".  Overall decent eats and drinks, service is prompt and attentive if not a little on the timid side. The lighting is dark like a midnight bowling alley so everyone looks much more attractive than they really are; maybe that's why people were staring at me...or maybe they were just squinting to see if I was a person or a hat rack. I guess I'm fine being interpreted as either so long as you don't hang one of those douchey flat caps on me.  I can't vouch for the karaoke rooms, but hear they're a good, cheap time for a group. Speaking of prices, don't come hungry because the food is insanely expensive in my opinion. You can order a Korean beer bottle the size of a fire extinguisher for about 12 bucks, but the simplest appetisers seemed to weigh in between 15-20. I think I'll stick with the free peanuts at the bar, thank you. At least they have a lot to choose from and the portion sizes for many dishes was fairly large.  Bottom line: a great place to stop in with some friends for a couple drinks or with a few more for karaoke. Grab your appetisers or meal elsewhere if you'd rather put your dollars towards drinks; the food here will consume your wallet. One of the few places open in J-town Monday nights!",

Now, the food, however! \u00a0Great! \u00a0It's some of the better Korean food I've had in San Francisco.  First off, they have soondae! (Blood sausage: I think some other reviewer called it gross...yeah, it's an acquired taste but I love it).  Then, they also have a pretty good haemul dolsot bibimbap (seafood mixed rice in a hot stone bowl...don't touch the bowl). \u00a0The one at Ohgane is better, but this is good.  Also, a very delicious ahltang (codroe stew) with tofu. \u00a0Nice. \u00a0Not too spicy, and lots of codroe. \u00a0  We also ordered some fried mandoo (for those who are more used to Japanese food, gyozas), which I love. \u00a0I was too full to eat more than a couple.  Near the end, after we had sat there for hours eating and drinking, they gave us fried octopus as \"service\" (free). \u00a0I realized at this meal that what is different about octopus at Korean restaurants is that us Koreans tend to prefer octopus that definitely has a more \"fishy\" taste...so it might not be for everyone, particularly those who might not like fishy seafood (which always amazes me; what's the point of eating seafood then?).  Oh, yeah, the banchan. \u00a0This isn't a big banchan sort of meal, so don't expect a lot of the small side dishes. \u00a0There's a few, but it's not a huge spread (after all, this is a norebang/drinking establishment). \u00a0However, I do like that corn/butter/cheese thing they serve. \u00a0It's so Asian let's-take-American-processed-food and make it weirder.",

It was pretty empty at first, but I gotta give them slack since it was a Wednesday. \u00a0Eventually, I think they filled up half of the place.  The place would have look better if I was drunk. That is all.  There's only 3 rooms for karaoke and I imagine it gets crowded during the weekend. Book ahead! Two complaints. One: \u00a0the machines don't offer an option for a singer to sing simultaneously with me. I need help with singing and it was kind of hard without it. Two: the songs are organized alphabetically by song titles. I wished it was by artists! It was very overwhelming.  Now, on with the food. I ate so much that I totally went to a larger notch for my belt. I was ridiculously full and almost considered hurling. But I didn't. Food was surprisingly good. I got the seafood pancake--not the best I've had, but pretty darn appetizing. Tried all of my friends' food and all were equally good AND SPICYYY. Also, the waiters got confused about our orders and ended up giving us an extra big bowl of noodles with crab. Freebies are awesome. And oh yes, the corn and cheese were tasty.   Lastly, I have to note that the waiter spilled a pitcher of water near us. Um, I screamed terribly loud and I am ashamed. I forgive them because they gave me a pack of Melon gum every time I asked thereafter.",

Now, subtract the rental tuxes along with a few of the dresses, up everyone's age or give them McLovin cards, and - hey! - you're at Playground.  The menu is a mix of newer (cheese corn, fried chicken, omelets, soju cocktails, etc.) and older (altang, doenjang jjigae, jjajangmyeon, golbaengi muchim, etc.). Other things like budae jjigae and froyo (\"plain\" flavor only) x Fruity Pebbles make appearances, along with just a few exclusive items, identified by names starting with \"noriteo\" / \"playground\". Funky things can come \"service\", like cheese corn, fried chicken, etc.. Sansachun is available, for the aficionados.  I've been here with group sizes ranging from just 2 people to the entire restaurant (rented, reserved... I didn't a$$k). The whole restaurant version had mics for people to sing (and give speeches - whatever) among the dining tables rather than having to go to the private rooms.  The waitstaff are in baseball t-shirts, some saying \"Playground\", some Lincecum.

If it wasn't for the food, I would've gave this place a 1 star.  This place isn't setup for non-Korean speakers/readers. The remote controls were in korean.. the waiter was korean but didn't know how to read korean to help us with the remote. There isn't that many English selections to choose from... Also the system is pretty ghetto... the tv was broken for 15 minutes until they reset everything.. All the videos were the bootleg ones with weird backgrounds.. we were singing to guys doing hula and some naked kids running around th beach... (yes I'm not kidding. WTF!).... for what it provides the hourly rate was pretty expensive.   The food was pretty good though. One of the main reasons why I picked this place in the first place was that it's one of the very few karaoke places that have private rooms and serves alcohol. We ordered the usual korean selections like galbi, black bean noodles (their noodles were chewy just the way I like it!), spicy rice cakes, bibimbop (not very good, it was cold), cold spicy noodles with egg, seafood pancakes (yummy!), and corn with cheese (this was free).  Honestly with the limited song selections, it's really not worth it.",

Usually, people commit for karaoke but most then cancel at last minute so you are screwed with your downpayment. Then, the private room for 8 people was actually a kind of creepy attic transformed into karaoke with very old karaoke equipment. Food was not that good and impressively overcharged, same as their cocktails. We had just 4 large plates charged 20$ each, same for the fruit plate. The plates look large but actually there is not that much. Large dumpling plate were like only 10 dumplings...

A friend of mine sitting next to me was looking over the bill and mentioned, \"Man, this place is pretty pricey for what you get. I have gotten more food and better drinks for that price.\" (Which is very true BTW)!   The owner was behind the bar and started yelling at my friend, \"If you have a problem with the price, you can bring it up to me. I am the owner and if you don't like the prices here, then you can leave.\" She then kept going on and on how she has been the owner of this place for over 8 years blah blah blah! She made all 10 of us sitting at the bar feel very uncomfortable and unwanted at her \"establishment of 8 years\"!   Afterwords, I mentioned to the owner that she should have handled the situation differently because she made it very awkward for everyone sitting down enjoying the night. She had no remorse at all and stuck her nose up in the air like she was better than us.   I WILL NOT RETURN!!!!!! And I do not support any restaurant in this beautiful city who treat their customers in such a manor.   Thanks for nothing other than my over priced Jameson shot!",

All in all, a great way to spend an evening with friends. \u00a0  My only two knocks against this place:  1) \u00a0The food kinda sucked. \u00a0Example: \u00a0we were served a chicken and cheese dish that looked like a 21-year old bachelor's wet dream, except it was cry-your-eyes-out spicy, the chicken was barely warm and the cheese was chewy. \u00a0It's a karaoke bar, so no big foul here.  2) \u00a0Playground really maximizes the space it was built in, which is a nice way of saying there are short ceilings and weird angles everywhere. \u00a0I had to bend over in the private room to sing, and again while doing my thing in the restroom. \u00a0Heads up.",

What we order everytime is: La bokki (sp?) and fried dumplings  Those are the staples i have to get. Let me warn you now, that their food is EXTREMELY spicy. Not bearable spicy, but crazy spicy. I have to always ask them to make the weakest spice level they can, and when they do its still spicy, but the perfect amount.  I think mentioning the staff is super important too. They're always friendly and sweet. I can't say that I try \"different\" foods all the time, and they've never been the one to make me feel awkward about asking questions or for their suggestions. My favorite part is that they're open late, about 2am on weekends they still serve food.   Even better, when you finish your meal there is a karaoke place around the corner thats open till about 4 or 5am. So you can end your night there burning off those calories from playground :)",

They didn't skimp on the seafood either. - Seafood pancake: Greasy grossness with barely any seafood. - BBQ Chicken: Good - Beef ribs: Rubbery - Lychee soju: Generous  But it wasn't the food that was so bad. It was the general grimy decor. It was the dirty furniture and floor. It was the loud, crazy K-pop videos being played on full blast, which--entertaining as they were--were just annoying after a while. The service was okay, but that didn't really make up for everything else. Don't come here.",

    "review_text": "Yummy sojus and Korean dishes, karaoke rooms that can hold groups of 15 or so, and a full bar--what's not to love about Playground? And is why it gets 5 stars!   I've been to my share of karaoke places in SF and LA, and have to say, I think Playground is pretty much one of the best in the city.  Here's a breakdown (most) of the food and drink:   * Soju - The yogurt and lychee are some of the best I've ever had. Though the lychee was better, and didn't appear too potent.   * Fried chicken wings (w/ and w/out spicy sauce) - YUM!! Both were perfectly crispy and seasoned well. The sauce ones battle the ones from one of my fave late night Korean eateries...like how it wasn't so tangy, and just spicy. \u00a0Orders were generous, too!  * Kimchee pancake - Perfectly fried and not so doughy. One order was huge, that our big group could have gotten away w/ ordering just one since we had so many other dishes.   * Deokbokki - Another dish done JUST right. Spicy, but not overly so where I was burning my tongue, and the bean cakes and fish cakes were the right texture.   * Jap chae - Our group of 15 KILLED 3 orders. We could have easily ordered a 4th one because it was such a favorite. Overall pretty tasty.   * Access to a pretty full bar - Mentioned this last because it's a big deal when karaoke places especially for the ones in J-town where drinks are typically limited to soju and beer (or some you have to sneak it in..haha).   Service was efficient and fairly quick. The phone to call instead of going downstairs or waiting for them to come to your room is a nice touch. \u00a0  Song selection was pretty extensive with a fair amount of new releases in terms of American language songs. There were also menus and menus of Korean, Chinese and even Filipino songs (I guess they do like to sing karaoke, too!). The menu selection/programing wasn't too hard to figure out, though we had a designated programer who's a regular at Playground.   There you have it--go to Playground because as far as I can tell it might be the best karaoke room/bar in the city, and the prices are fair. You can dine in the dining area, and just have drinks there, too.",

I suspected we were in trouble when we walked up the stairs and were greeted with \"Korean Fusion\" - fusion with what? I was about to find out.   From the sickly kimchee sides to the overly cooked and greased up main courses, it was a ghost of what I was use to from my travels. I would say it was fusion between Korean cuisine and the local McDonald's. Hell even the bean paste had more of the consistency of spicy ketchup than the nutty heat I was use to. Bean paste, come on guys, you can buy quality a few blocks away at the local Korean market.   The ambiance was equally cheesy with bad neon and vinyl seats. I know the place doubles as a Karaoke bar, but I've been in Karaoke bars in Korea (and sung with the best drunken business man) and this place misses by a mile.   The only reason I did not resort to a 1-star was that the wait staff did a good job with food coming out in a reasonable pace and was attentive to our needs. Too bad they had so little to work with.   If you are looking for authentic Korean cuisine/ambiance, it's not here.",

The jap chae is flavorful but it only has noodle, a few beef pieces and zuchinni. At least the noodle is chewy. The rice cake, on the other hand, was overcooked. It was mushy so it doesn't stick to the sauce very well. The sauce was watery, so the dish in general just doesn't hold together. At the end of the night, I was super thirsty. The meat was meh...

It was still pretty early in the night, like 10ish, and so our group sat down at one of their loungey tables. I ordered a round of birthday cake shots to celebrate our friend's birthday, and they took SO LONG to make them. I watched the bartender serve all these other people standing at the bar, and did not see any signs of them assembling our drinks. After a while, we got up from our table and was going to leave after politely canceling our order, since we hadn't really committed to staying, but the girl stopped us and said they were making our drinks now. So we embarrassingly sat back down.  I was almost afraid they screwed up the drinks because I thought the drink might be a little obscure, or maybe they took so long because they were looking up the recipe online. Then there was an issue with splitting the check because two people didn't have cash so they had to use their cards. The issue was that they charged both of them gratuity because we were a party of 6, and I guess our cash hadn't totaled up to be enough to cover? I don't know what it was, but it caused some unnecessary confusion.  The only thing I like are the sofas. They also play a loop of obscure hip &amp; hop karaoke videos on the tvs in the bar area, and sometimes a familiar jam comes on and it's like heyyy but most times, it's like oh I've heard of this artist, but not this song.

Because it was a weeknight, there weren't that many people but usually it is pretty packed on weekends. The lighting is dim so it had a nice feel to it.  I ordered the Dolsot Bibimbab: rice, mixed vegetables, beef, and egg served in a hot stove with spicy chili paste on the side (except I didn't have them put the chili paste on the side since I can't handle spicy). After getting it, I mixed it so the egg would cook. It tasted so good and I would definitely order this again. At $12.99 it was super affordable compared to everything else on the menu. I was filled!  Service was okay. It could have felt more attentive but our waiter did fulfill any of our requests instantly.",

I thought the wait for a private room was a bit long, but I realized why once we had our own. They have every song that you can think of! I'm a jukebox-a-holic so this was like the ultimate jukebox experience for me, but no dollars required. The best part was the telephone, which you can use to call in orders for anything on the menu. I had a really great time and I will definitely go back.",

(unless you go to that hostess bar in the shopping mall...)  $150 for a bottle of Grey Goose. (cheap for bottle service). JjaJjangMyun and chicken wings are good here. Yogurt soju is by far the best of the cocktail soju. Call ahead to reserve a room, otherwise you won't get one. For some reason, by the time it hits 1 AM, this place is dead.  Anyways, I stopped going here as much as I used to. Even though the ahjuma (woman owner) is super nice and always gives me free bottles of cocktail soju and fruit dishes, I always end up spending way too much (hence, the \"service\" -- yes, Korean people call free shit, \"service\", no wonder I'm so cheap). Give me a Karaoke room with bottle service and Korean food and there will be no question that the bill will be astronomical by the end of the night. I've had to take out lines of credit to cover those bills! Nevertheless, Playground holds a special place in my heart.",

You work for your tip, you dont bully it out of a 5'2\" girl. Ive never had worse service in my life. Completely outrageous and dishonorable staff and morale. I actually tipped the bouncer because he was kind enough to help my friend. When i have a friend in need, im going to make sure they are alright. That is my priority. They had no concern for that. If i wasn't bullied i'd give a tip. I paid to cover everyone but a guy who did not even serve us just could not wait even a few minutes. Don't think you'll confront me and I'll cower.

    "review_text": "Full confession: I've only been here twice. But both times (in the last two weeks!) have been absolutely memorable, no doubt because of the endless carafes of yogurt soju brought into our private karaoke rooms. Yes, you heard that right.  Dinner: Don't go for the standard kalbi / bulgogi you find in every other Korean restaurant; go for what sounds unfamiliar. The food is great, but it's the kind of spicy that knocks impatiently at your door the next morning, know what I'm saying? And that corn and melted cheese concoction they give you for free? It's probably good for you -- but only in a cosmic sense.  Karaoke: okay -- it's not the kind of selection you get with those expensive MagicSing contraptions, but you don't get served soju at home. Still: private room, disco ball, an actual tambourine you can shake, particularly at that \"And I need you now tonight [cha-ching!] / And I need you more than ever [cha-ching!]\" bridge of Bonnie Tyler's \"Total Eclipse of the Heart,\" and you've got it made. Tons of English, Japanese (Tommy february6 even!), Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Indonesian songs.  (Hint: Check out the Tagalog songs, because it somehow includes Fiction Factory's \"Feels Like Heaven\" for all you New Wavers out there.) Pack a room with friends, and at 30 bucks an hour, it's a relative steal.  Soju: good lord, the flavors. Yogurt, lemon, strawberry, plain, and more -- all sufficient to make a tonedeaf person like me pick up the mic and try to sing Franz Ferdinand's \"Take Me Out\" and *nail it*. That's what Playground does to you.",

CLEANLINESS: 4/5 SERVICE: 4/5 FOOD: 4/5 - Yogurt Soju - OB Beer - Bul-go-gi  We initially came here just to drink some soju and beer, but we ended up ordering a dish of bulgogi. The bul-go-gi was really good. It was full of flavor and was not dry at all. It was moist and tasty. And of course the meal came with the mini Korean plates that they give you in the beginning of the meal. It was my first time seeing some kind of corn dish, but it was okay.   As for alcohol, we ordered a glass of yogurt soju and a \"pitcher\" (more like huge bottle) of OB beer. It was my first time having yogurt soju, and I have to say it was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of hard liquor, such as soju by itself, so this was a surprise to me. You can only taste a hint of the alcohol, which is what I prefer. Then we had some Korean beer, which was similar to Corona... but better.   The location of this place is sort of hidden in the Japantown buildings, but it's on the top floor which is nice. It's a pretty small place, so I assume this place can fill up quick. Overall, it was a chill place, and I had a good experience.",
