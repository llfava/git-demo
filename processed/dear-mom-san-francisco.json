We had a bar in mind but while we were looking for parking, I saw this place and decided that we needed to check it out.  The place itself has modest decor. Dim lighting via interesting, hanging light bulbs, chalkboard menus, wooden furnishings, games, a photo booth....honestly the most hipster bar I have ever set foot in. It's also rather spacious with a good amount of seating. It was pretty packed for a Sunday night so we sat at the bar.   Service was friendly and patient. Really chill people who seem to have a lot of character.   I ordered a pint of Anchor Steam ($8) while my friends got Anchor Porter ($9) and water respectively. We also ordered a Spanish Chorizo pizza ($13) for us to share.  The beers were good. I rather like Anchor Steam. The pizza took a little over 10 minutes, but it was quite tasty. They bake the pizza and then pan fry it to make the crust a little crispier. I like that a lot. This is a pretty small pizza though so don't expect a party size.   I really like this place a lot and I do plan to go back one day. Really chill place!",

    "review_text": "Don't be fooled by the title, it's unfinished, the full title is actually: \"Dear Mom, We're a Bunch of Hipster Dickheads\".  I know that sounds harsh, but these people were inexcusably rude.  My boyfriend has been dying to hang out at this bar for ages, so when his birthday rolled around, he decided to make a reservation. He didn't want to risk it getting lost or confused, so we actually walked to the bar to make it in person. This is when I should've noticed the first red flag.  [To preface this, this was NOT a busy night. It wasn't really late and there weren't a million people to attend to.] It took forever to get anyone to talk to us. Everyone who worked there completely ignored us. I stood at the bar in case I could speak to the bartender when he came to ask me what I wanted to drink...mistake, he never asked me what I wanted to drink. I just stood there trying to get his attention like an idiot, until my boyfriend finally just stepped in the path of the server who was ignoring and walking right past us, and asked about a reservation.  They had him write all his information down, told him for the 20-30 people he expected, they'd have to book him the back room, and then said they'd call to confirm.  A whole week passes, no call. My boyfriend calls every single day, can only get through to answering machine, and still no call. However, we weren't THAT worried since it doesn't usually work like this: If it's not confirmed, we won't even bother to call and tell you that.  So finally it's his birthday, we all show up, to bring massive business to this place, and OOPS, they LOST THE RESERVATION, and they gave the room to someone else.  Okay, any decent, professional business would try to compensate for this somehow. Or at the very least apologize profusely. But not Dear Mom! I guess they're above that.  Instead, they pointed to a table that was pushed against the handicap ramp and video game machines (hence making two sides of it inaccessible for anyone to sit) which didn't matter because for our party of 20, they provided us with exactly two chairs; and they told us we could have that. Actually, \"provided\" is a loose term as that would've required they'd put in any effort at all. The two chairs were already at the table.  Then, they proceeded to completely ignore us for the rest of the night. That's how they treat someone on their birthday, bringing tons of business to their bar, who bothered to try to make a reservation.  TL:DR- Don't bother making a reservation here. Don't expect any kind of kindness, politeness, or the bare minimum of civil customer service, even if it's your damn birthday. What you'll get instead is unfathomably rude and disinterested service, if it can even be called \"service\".",

    "review_text": "Hmmmmm, this review is a toughie. Swung by with my brother and some friends last night after having heard that Dear Mom was going to be another SF hotspot. Severely dissappointed in the result.  First the pros: door man was so easy that he didn't even check for ID's. Drinks are served at dirt cheap prices. The interior is a vast space, though there is no interior design to speak of. You've got Foosball tables, pool tables, video games and a massive Connect Four game. Oh, and a photo booth too. All the ingredients for a decent time.  Now the cons: the crowd...just wasn't my scene. Like, at all. Was there even one remotely attractive female there last night? I don't think so. Instead, it was a hodgepodge of hipsters and alternative types. Oh, and there was some random guy walking around all night with his skateboard, so I guess if you're a skater, this would be a good spot for you too.  In reading the comments, I note a distinct sense of disdain for hipsters in this city. I'm not going to hate on hipsters...they need a place to hang out too.  But what can I say? I guess I'm just a mainstream kind of guy. I like my ladies in Size 0, 2 or 4, in mini skirts and heels and with a Chanel or a Birkin. I don't go for Size 12's with multiple eyebrow piercings and 13 tatoos. That's just me.   And so, while freely admitting that this place probably just wasn't meant for a guy like me, I'm going to say that I can't recommend coming to Dear Mom. Especially given it's out-of-the-way location.  And you can trust me on this one; I'm an Elite. ;)",

Nevertheless, we ordered the Papa Fritas and Buffalo Burger. YUM the Papa Fritas ($8) are cut potatoes with cotija cheese, chile, tapatio aioli, green onion, cilantro, and lime. The tapatio aioli makes this dish AMAZING. I already know I'm going to have specific cravings for this later. The Sriracha Buffalo Chicken Sandwich ($12) has lettuce, onions, tapat\u00edo aioli, and scallion sour cream... served with waffle fries.

The ambiance is pretty casual, yet I feel like everyone in the place \" had it going on!\" They also offer a very unique assortment of bar bites. Aside from your typical grilled chicken sandwich, the menu items were very creative and not necessarily typical of bar food. For example, I ordered these fried chicken wraps, but they were actually fried chicken wrapped in an egg roll with Asian spices. Very delicious. My husband ordered the nachos. Again, they were not tortilla chips and melted cheese...they were more like breakfast potatoes mixed with cheese, peppers, and some other stuff. Very good and interesting. Dear Mom is a little out of the way for us and requires a can ride, so I don't think it'll become our Friday night go to spot, but it will happily and excitedly return for a special occasion.",

Looking around now you'd never guess that it used to be a dark, forgotten, shady bar with no appeal....COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION!!!!!!! You walk in to a large open area, great music playing, pool table, more open space, booths that can sit like 10 people (finally someone realized people don't always travel in packs of 4)   You stroll up to the giant U shaped bar to get a beverage that can range from a beer and a shot to a fancy pants cocktail that could impress the biggest of cocktail gurus. Not to mention the bar staff is totally awesome and friendly, giving this place a muuuuch needed neighborhood vibe.   I had actually never tried anything from Chez Spencer before (yelp elite, please don't hate me) but luckily they have a menu and a kitchen right there at Dear Mom!!! My friends and I got several appetizers to split and loved them all. I was especially happy with the slider, the mac and cheese, and the asparagus salad. It was really nice to actually have decent food while enjoying drinks.  A good reminder for all, this place does close at midnight...it will be the first stop on many of my nights out.

    "review_text": "Our favorite new lunch spot!  We have been here twice, I believe they just opened this week. We were walking past and saw the chef out front, he explained the entire menu to me willing to answer any annoying question I had, and we went inside. They have done an incredible job of renovating the space. Giant wooden tables and bars, Edison bulbs hang from the ceiling they have a homey feel made modern it's really great.  Ordering You walk to a window in the back and they have two menus, the pricer menu which is their daily specials. which average about 16 dollars and are huge portions. Today was the trout, it came with spinach and was an entire trout for 16 dollars ( I did not have the trout my friend did.)  the second menu ( both are on adorable chalks boards.) Offers up french slider 9 dollars-My boyfriend had this,  a hot dog in a baguette Soy or beef with a small green salad, and fingerling potatoes 6 dollars -I had had this,  It's a steal and my favorite thing I have been looking for is a normal soy hot dog, its been so hard in sf to find one they isn't a sausage variety. This is the perfect hot dog, I believe the mustard is homemade. It's a perfect portion and high quality ingredients.  I have also tried two Mom's daily soups, yesterday was potato leek with a pepper sauce. Today was cauliflower with a crunchy Parmesan circle about the size of the bowl laying on top this added a ton of flavor and crunchiness to the soup. Both were very good.  We also tried the asparagus Salad 6, with pepper cream sauce, like a way better version of ranch served over asparagus some other littler greens served warm. Outstanding. I loved this dish.  Now for the best thing we ate, it gets better? It does! We ordered there mac and cheese. It is 5 cheeses with the same Parmesan thingy on top, in rich creamy sauce. This is the best mac and cheese I had ever had. It's creative and fresh tasting, I will be coming back and getting this often. the only downside is the serving size is kinda small so for lunch alone it's not as filling as the hot dog or slider. But I imagine it's priced the way it is because they use 5 very fancy high quality cheeses.  Also you order directly to the chef and he is the nicest guy, his food is amazing, the staff makes sure you are happy with what you have ordered, he has personally come over twice to ask we were pleased with our dishes.  Today he remembered us from yesterday, and threw in 2 free cookies. They were little sandwich cookies one vanilla and coconut with a vanilla cream and raspberry \u00a0jelly in the center. The other a chocolate cookie with peanut butter in the middle. I will now be getting the cookies every time. They are 2 dollars.  We spent about 25 today and 20 yesterday. Also pint pbr cans are only 3 dollars, coke is 1 dollar. They also threw in my coke for free today.  I think we will eat here everyday this week. I'm especially excited for Thursday it's a Fowl special. Fowl simmered for an entire day in a tomato and olive sauce. Saturday is a beef special with cheesy mashed potatoes.  If you are in the mission looking for a new great place to have a couple beers, or a fabulous meal this is your place. I debated writing this review because I'm seflish and want them to stay slow because I'm enjoying the staff interaction, but this place won't stay a secret for long it's too wonderful.",

Or was it an early April fools? I don't know why everyone is giving this place 4 or 5 stars. In my book, to receive 3+ stars you should at least learn to do some--NO, ALL of the following:  1. Learn how to make a proper Old Fashioned cocktail. Not one that is clearly 90% club soda and sugar. It's not hard to please alcoholics!  2. Don't charge $15+ for \"French food\" that is way over-salted. Was that lamb cheek polenta you served me or an actual salt lick?  3. I don't know if you're just trying to be assholes on purpose, but who serves hot dogs and doesn't provide ketchup? The guy working in the kitchen said, \"Oh, we don't even have ketchup in the building...\" and then maliciously rubbed his hands together and laughed in my face.   Disclaimer: Ok he didn't, but he might as well have. Actually, the guy was kind of nice and felt bad (maybe embarrassed) they didn't carry simple every day condiments.  4. Putting a hot dog in a french baguette and charging $7 felt like being robbed. Good thing we already felt robbed earlier when paying for watered down drinks so we were already familiar...  5. Don't open a bar with food and not hire a single soul to bus tables. Sitting next to 10 empty glasses and a plate of leftover salt lick isn't really the ambiance I was expecting.  1 star for the jukebox. Which had Hall and Oates. AKA a bar staple.",

I was still on my first beverage (a phenomenal Peach Cider from Dogfish Head Brewery) when 1145 rolled around and a bartender shouted that we had ten minutes to all get out. My group, which consisted of 5 people, were all surprised at this, but took note of it nonetheless. Most of us, including myself, are servers and completely understand what it's like to want the last few people out when you're trying to close up. There were only a couple other people at the bar, so we were concentrating on finishing our beverages.   \u00a0 A couple of minutes later, a young woman came up to the table to take what she could, and specifically told me that \"I need that, too\", referring to my 2/3 full pint. I said \"ok, not yet though\"...which seemed rather obvious to me. I proceeded to drink it as fast as I could without feeling a little ill, and a few minutes later she came back to the table and took everyone else's cans, then stared at me. Acknowledging her impatience, I said \"I'm guzzling as fast as I can.\" and took another drink. She stood right next to where I was sitting and insisted \"No, I really need it now.\" I then said to her that we heard them say we had ten minutes before we had to leave (which, may I add, is pretty short notice), to which she replied \"Yes, and that was 8 minutes ago.\"  \"O.K.\", I said, \"let me just drink this, then.\"   \u00a0 At that point, as if her aggressive presence and proximity to my person weren't enough, she said \"Oh my God, I am NOT having this conversation with you!\" and kept staring with her hand lingering as close as possible to my glass. I merely said to her \"Then don't. Let me drink my drink.\" I took one more drink before she actually grabbed it out of my hand and stormed away. I didn't resist her, because I was too busy wondering how in the world someone thinks it's ok to treat a guest like that at an establishment. In my many years in the service industry, as well as many years frequenting bars, I've never experienced such rude and awkward behavior from an employee.   \u00a0 I had been planning to go back to this bar because I enjoyed the atmosphere as well as its selection. Unfortunately though, I can't overlook such mistreatment, and will take my business elsewhere.    \u00a0 I can't say I don't recommend this place, but when you go, try to avoid a twenty-something-ish African American girl with shoulder length curly hair. Especially if you are one who enjoys tasting your beverages while you drink them, or being treated with respect.",

It felt more like a lounge than a club. When we left and had to walk through the more crowded area was annoying though with sweaty people trying to flirt.  The drawbacks of this place would have to be thee bathroom. The women's restroom is pretty awkward. The toilets are separated by (for lack of better terms) shower curtain-esque cloth. Fortunately there is a main door to the bathroom so if you're fearful of someone opening the curtain while you're doing your business you can lock the REAL door. Another disturbing part of the bathroom are the photos of people tacked to the wall. I feel like I'm walking into a scary movie. The pictures on the wall, dim lights and awkward shower curtained toilets were enough to give me the creeps.  The other drawback was the menu. Granted, it did say slider on the menu (note the singular form here) but honestly, when I think of bar food I would have expected sliderS! My friend and I paid $9 thinking we could share, but we ended up getting a slider and a small salad. Granted, the slider was tasty, but for $9 it was a bit of a rip off.",

Once you get service, the alcohol will be strong, and cheap if you get one of their specials.   I ate two burgers there: the Angus and the chorizo. The Angus was good though the chorizo was a bit better. The latter is more moist, aided by a fried egg. Each burger comes with huge potato chunks, like Epic, not regular fries. You can fill up these if you aren't careful.   Day or night, and by day I mean after the SF Marathon, the music will be a good mix of your old favorites. Sometimes you'll pick up a theme, sometimes you'll just want to dance in your seat a bit.   Mixed diet crowds will like the menu because vegetarian dishes make up a good percentage of the menu.

We knew ahead of time the bathroom situation may be a bit of an adventure - and on that front, happy to say the strange partitions have been replaced with shower curtains. \u00a0Yes - still a bit odd, but for the most part, offer reasonable privacy.  On to the drinks... The \"special\" cocktails were unfortunately terrible. \u00a0I ordered an old fashioned and was surprised to get a glass filled to the brim with ice and soda water (oh, and some whiskey and an orange peel). \u00a0Maybe they need a review on the definition of a \"splash\" of water? \u00a0Needless to say - don't put the drink on your \"specials\" board if you don't know how to make a proper old fashioned. \u00a0My friend also ordered a drink from the \"specials\" - no bueno. \u00a0  Good news is that it seems if you stick with something simple (gin and soda... whiskey and ginger...) you'll be far more pleased. \u00a0And the beer and wine is quite reasonble (after the old fashioned fiasco - I stuck with wine).  The food = meh. \u00a0Wasn't amazing and wasn't cheap. \u00a0Kudos to not just having fries, but if you're going to charge $10 for a small side of \"4 Cheese Farfalle\" (aka mac &amp; cheese) - please just add a bit more flavor... maybe throw in some gruyere or even some herbs.  The best part about the places is really just the space. \u00a0It's big - it's open - it has a great feel! \u00a0Best to go, grab an beer or wine - and pick a song on the jukebox.",

Nowadays, Fogcutter has a permanent home as the resident restaurant inside Dear Mom. \u00a0I've been twice since their move and while the menu is different, it is still AMAZING.  The hamburger I had last night was honestly one of the best freakin burgers I've ever had. \u00a0It had all the fixins complete with America's new burger sensation the fried egg...LOVE IT.  The time before I had the fried chicken bao, a great and flavorful chinese style bun with fried chicken and cabbage. \u00a0  This place is the bomb, and you should all go. \u00a0As it now has a permanent home, I'll be there all the time!",

Everyone is largely engaged with their own groups and physically quite far from others despite it being a busy weekend.   I was a little disappointed by the cocktails. I suppose I was expecting speakeasy style craft cocktails so maybe I was wrong for going in with that expectation. On the other hand, they did have a decent beer selection.

Without that fantastic bar menu, this place is just another middling bar with a decent beer list. Those bars are a dime a dozen in this town.

Internet at home is down and I have a lot of work to do in the next week, so I searched for places in the Mission (close to BART) to go to after my day job where I could be comfortable, go late night, grab some food, grab a beer and use free wifi.  Dear Mom ended up to be the place, I am now a super fan.   Hipster? Fine, I can see why, but I don't see that implemented here in the negative sense. I mean everyone and everything under 35 yrs old is pretty much hipster these days in some way or another.  Live in Williamsburg, NY and you will see why hipster became a dirty word.  People at Dear Mom are really friendly. The bartenders helped me find an outlet for my comp and one moved a beer when he saw it close enough to do damage if spilled. Everyone I have encountered have been really warm, nice and helpful.  I have had their papas fritas and the burger.  Holy shit their burger is so good, best I've had in awhile. Pink in the middle, pickles and white sharp cheddar. um...yeah.  Now, five stars is like the perfect score. There is one thing I don't like.  The music is deafening. It is a bar, so I don't expect it to be a quiet cafe, it doesn't need to be quiet at all. I actually think most bars should turn their music down. Everyone shouts over it and I feel like I'm damaging my ears and my voice box at the same time.  Anyhoo, I gave them five anyway because they have saved me and made my long work week really pleasant.   Oh, and I love their layout, it can fit a lot of people. I have so far been able to find a seat away from the crowd each time I come.",

Add to that the last server (the OTHER dark haired female bartender) asking us to move and then adding \"I didn't want to throw you out your seats\".... Well... Uhm.... Clearly you need to be educated. Asking us to move OFF the bar when there is ample room cannot in ANYWAY be construed as making us vacate our seats. Unless ... Wait.... You are dumb.

Worst Old Fashioned I've EVER had in my entire life. Pretty sure the barkeep used vermouth instead of Angostura bitters, which made the drink nearly unbearable. Also, he served it to me in a rocks glass, sans the rocks. Word of advice to the owner(s): Hire bartenders that know how to properly mix a cocktail, especially a classic like the Old Fashioned.  Also ordered the French slider. Not sure what made it French, or a slider. Really just a hamburger. Was decent, but nothing to write home to Mom about. Also, listing this place in the French category is a serious stretch.  The layout is cool, but I agree with others that there seems to be a ton of wasted space.  I hate to dish out a negative review, but I want to see the place succeed and sometimes you need tough love to grow.",

I think it's because it's got a good vibe, a lot of space, stiff &amp; reasonably priced drinks, and some food options. The bar is cash only (they have a high-tech ATM) but here are some of the highlights/prices:  - can of PBR - $3 - greyhound - $6 - Moscow Mule (with good ginger beer!) - $8  Some of the waitresses are friendlier than others (one barely let my friend get two words of a question in) but they make the drinks fairly quickly so I'm typically happy. Some food highlights:  - edamame with lemon and sesame seeds - $4  - papa frites with various spices - $6 I think  - chicken sandwiches, tacos, and more  There's also a photo booth, pinball machine, and Foosball for your entertainment!  Our friend brought in cupcakes for the party and the bar didn't seem to mind. She had reserved the private room which is especially perfect for parties!

Parking was easy on Saturday dinner time. The place was rowdy, but not packed, definitely a locals hangout.. so far. They had the typical combos of PBR and a shot (whiskey or bullet - depending on your selection of poison). The order, 1/2 lb burger with side potatoes and an added fried egg. ($12 + 1) My company ordered another burger with an egg and papa style fries (mayo sauce, cheese, and other delights ($12 + 1 + 2), and the last got a fried chicken bao ($9).  There is an ease to this place. They place hits (classics really) of the 90s era - Mandy Moore, TLC, etc., though mostly chosen from a digital juke box - which is telling of the crowd that patrons. Cut the burger in half and RUNNY EGG GOODNESS. That alone made my night. The side potatoes were crispy, slightly on the salty side, but that's easily amended with ketchup or to sponge runny egg residue. Medium rare burger was juicy, and with the egg - got messy. The bun did it's job of not being destroyed. Tried a bite of the fried chicken bao. Thought it was going to be spicy because of the red sauce, but it wasn't. Bao and chicken were fantastic, however I expected a bit more chicken. Seemed like you needed to ration it with your bites. Decent size though.  Recommend as a fun place off the beaten path, and if you want to seem cool to your out-of-town friends.",

Our first attempt to get some food here on a Saturday night was obviously insane, but gave it a second attempt recently at 9pm on a Tuesday and guess what, it was exactly the same -- because there are FIVE TABLES which YOU WILL NEVER SIT AT.  Moreover the menu is pretty ridiculous, just 3 or 4 items, including a \"french dip slider.\" Also, a hot dog in a hard, crunchy baguette is annoying and gum-shredding, not gourmet.   Moreover the general vibe was just weirdly hostile, like, I sort of felt like I was going to get beat up by hipsters whose territory I had invaded.

So, I'm totally on board with the vibe here, I just think a couple things need to be streamlined.  Ordering at the counter and having the bartenders serve you is a little awkward. \u00a0Food sat out for a bit while the bartenders tended to other things (understandably). \u00a0And once our plates were delivered I had to get up and get my own silverware on the other side of the room; should have some at the bar to prevent that. \u00a0Space at the bar was limited-- we squeezed our way into a corner. \u00a0Which made eating the fairly fancy dishes a little awkward. Like, I dunno, I'm not sure I want to eat a whole trout with people hovering over me trying to get a drink. \u00a0I don't mind eating a slider at a bar but nothing that requires significant knife/fork action. Didn't love the fishy-flavored grits (lots of shrimp essence), but maybe that's just me. \u00a0Liked that there were three salad/veggie options, it's usually hard to get something healthy at a bar, so that's a good direction.  Cool space...too much space maybe; I'd suggest a couple more tables, if y'all are taking suggestions. \u00a0For me, it seems like a great place to bring a big group for a drink, or four. \u00a0But I think the whole dining concept needs a little more work. \u00a0Hope to give it another go once they get in their groove.",

The nightmare goes something like this: I have to go to the bathroom, but the only available one has no proper door, or lock, or there's people watching me. \u00a0  I don't even know where to start with the bathroom situation at this bar! As described in other reviews, it is two toilets next to each other, with a see-through screen \"dividing\" them. You are also visible to anyone washing their hands as the sink is right there.   I was excited to check out this new bar, and if it weren't for the bathroom I'd have given it 4 stars. But since it's a bar, and drinking equals peeing, it's one star for botching something so basic. I was with 4 other girls and we and everyone in line were baffled.  The sign on the door didn't help. It's to comply with ADA? Riiiiight, so ALL the other public restrooms I've been in have been breaking the law...  At one point a male staff member needed to get into the closet in the restroom. I told him this wouldn't be a problem if, you know, you had some DOORS. Even the curtain at the Hemlock is way better than this.   One thing girls sometimes have to do in bathrooms is to change a tampon or sanitary whathaveyou. Should we use the men's room for this?  We wanted to stay for longer but had to leave. To find another bar where we could go to the bathroom.",

You don't have to walk back to the heart of the Mission to get some food, they make awesome shrimp tacos. They have a huge communal table for all your birthday party needs.

I got a pint of Anchor Steam and Radeberger, along with one of the best plate deals I've had in SF.  Their $6 hot dogs are unbeatable. I was skeptical when my friends placed their orders because $6 for just a hot dog seemed a little steep.  But not only do you get an amazing steamed hot dog in a warm baguette, but you also get a delicious salad and fingerling potatoes with some aioli to dip it in. Talk about stoked.

Service was fast and friendly.  The first bartender we talked to was really sweet. \u00a0He joked around with us and served us pineapple vodkas without judgment. \u00a0Since he had extra left over, he just gave us an extra shot on the house. \u00a0  The second bartender was a bit more judgmental. \u00a0Gave us a \"look\" when we asked for Dirty Shirleys and Lemon Drops, so we just asked for IPAs. \u00a0I get that this isn't a place to get girly-ass cocktails, but I would like to order sans judgment. \u00a0Whatever, he was nice. \u00a0We severely over-tipped both of them just because. \u00a0I liked the vibes from both of them because they were talking to us like we were old friends.  OHhh there was also a decent selection of beer.

Upon writing this review, i decided to urban dictionary the word grungy; because the word itself sounds dirty, but i wanted a more accurate description of Dear Mom. As UD puts it - not just dirty. Army boot dirty. Men's room floor dirty.  I guess i wouldn't say this bar was \"men's room floor dirty\", but it definitely gave off that vibe.  When we sat down at the bar, the servers were a little slow - ignored my friend and I for some time even though I was staring right at him. We finally got his attention and ordered 2 beers, their potatoes, kale taco (i dont know why, it sounded and was too healthy for bar food) and their chicken bao.  the best thing was probably the bao. everything else was just ok. they gave a generous cereal bowl sized of the potatoes, which i thought was nice if i wanted to gain 10 pounds.  Would come back for drinks, but not food.",

Now for the oh-so important pros - fast service, friendly bartenders, somewhat decent pricing and very large space. I hate a cramped bar.

We were the last to arrive so our friends already had their drinks. The un-friendly bartender told us he could only pour us shots since he called last call. I asked for a flavored vodka (clearly displayed on the wall) and he said he couldnt get it for me, my friend asked for patron which he was also denied, so we said just give us whatever... the bartender proceeded to grab silver tequila for my friend form the EXACT shelf the flavor vodka i had requested was on. We went to pay and it was cash only ( now this is my bad i should know better in the city) so i grabbed cash from the ATM .. he took 5 minutes to get back and get my cash which i dont know why because we wasnt serving any drinks. They quickly began flashing lights and making everyone leave before they even finished their drinks. The staff was rude, and unapproachable and I never plan on returning to this bar! ICK",

    "review_text": "Preface: We went to this place with a group of about 30 people. Each kind of in their own subset, so about 3 groups of 10. One of those groups included children and babies. We have awesome kids in our group, so don't think that they were running around the place spilling drinks and knocking over chairs. They behaved as any drunk patron would have: they told tall tales and lacked fine motor control.  When a restaurant or bar has dozens of people show up all within about 15 minutes of each other, it usually means that their service crumbles apart and their attitudes aren't very far behind them. Not so at Dear Mom. We put in food orders and within about 10 minutes our food started streaming out from the kitchen. Our drinks were served up at the bar by great bartenders that were plenty attentive for a fairly busy night. The music was loud and awesome. Seriously, Metallica, My Bloody Valentine and Buddy Holly all fit in just fine throughout the evening. The well drinks were generous (comparing prices to a few other bars in SF, some nearby and some not). The beer selection was more than adequate. The Foosball was epic.  I had a chicken sandwich thing, it was spicy and awesome. The homemade corndogs were epicly corndoggy. The Curly fries were curled just like the hair where as a child I'd hide and pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by-yigh. The Jalapeno poppers were poppingly spicy.  Can I mention again how chill and cool the staff was? Yes, I can? Then I will. Maybe they just had the A-Team on that night, but all of our needs were met and the one flub ( a forgotten fried egg) was rectified quickly. A buddy of mine loved his burger which had the fried egg included on first attempt. Typically there's a coldness when staff see children being brought into a bar &amp; grill... you know... like their cool spot is being encroached upon by breeding yuppies. We experienced no such cold hard stares or sneers. Instead they applied the age old practice of smiling and waiting for people to prove that they are assholes before treating them as such. Considering there's not an asshole to be found in our bunch, we had an expectedly good time and the staff were happy to have us around.  Go to this place happy and ready to enjoy a bar that at least for us on that Sunday night delivered on all the promises a bar can make: Staff that is timely, food that is not complicated and tastes great, and libations that flow nearly freely.  Kids are ok until 10pm, in case you were wondering.",

The greatest concentrations of hipsters can be found living in the Williamsburg, Wicker Park, and Mission District neighborhoods of major cosmopolitan centers such as New York, Chicago, and San Francisco respectively. Although \"hipsterism\" is really a state of mind,it is also often intertwined with distinct fashion sensibilities. Hipsters reject the culturally-ignorant attitudes of mainstream consumers, and are often be seen wearing vintage and thrift store inspired fashions, tight-fitting jeans, old-school sneakers, and sometimes thick rimmed glasses. Both hipster men and women sport similar androgynous hair styles that include combinations of messy shag cuts and asymmetric side-swept bangs. Such styles are often associated with the work of creative stylists at urban salons, and are usually too \"edgy\" for the culturally-sheltered mainstream consumer. The \"effortless cool\" urban bohemian look of a hipster is exemplified in Urban Outfitters and American Apparel ads which cater towards the hipster demographic. Despite misconceptions based on their aesthetic tastes, hipsters tend to be well educated and often have liberal arts degrees, or degrees in maths and sciences, which also require certain creative analytical thinking abilities.\"  *** not to be confused with (double rainbow)",

The bartenders are extremely friendly and the Violet Bouregard I had was fantastic. We tried the sliders and the mac n'cheese from their regular menu, and it was all tasty. Hadn't it been for the holiday spirit, I might have had to cut half a star because of the sometimes alarmingly high volume from the jukebox ... But for having been open for only 16 days, they are sure doing a fine job and I'll be back.",

They are Guillermo and Caroline who used to have a food truck named FogCutter. And they are DA BOMB!  Upscale bar food that is crazy inventive and awesome. Once a week there are pop-ups on Sunday, but the rest of the time they are working their tailfeathers off bringing all the drunk people fantastic food. Shout out to Sherie and Jay who also flex their chef muscles in the kitchen (Sherie is from Voodoo).   Yes, the bar is cash only, but if ya'll look around, there is an ATM right inside. It's not rocket science, it's just a bar with food, but it's a good one and you should be nice to your Mom.",

Fried chicken sandwich had a nice crispy crust and tender enough, but the slaw that came with it had too much mayo for my tastes. Also the chicken batter appeared to rely more on the korean chili sauce for flavoring than spices in the batter itself.  The chilaquiles verdes was a tasty messy-looking bowl of stuff. Avocado on scrambled egg on pork shoulder on tortilla chips with salsa/sour cream/cheese all over it, and a lime on the side. Seemed like a pretty good hangover dish if that's what you're looking for. The dim interior lighting would help that, as well. ;)  We were really hoping for the fall hash as shown online, but the menu of the day was different from the example on their website, oh well. Prices are alright, however, and we definitely left full. Seems like a good spot for people in the neighborhood esp if you want something less frou frou than a mimosa to pair with your brunch, but there are lots of other interesting brunch places elsewhere in the city!",

It looks like they have an interesting, off the beaten path beer selection.   And the bartenders. Wow. 5 stars for our girl with the glasses and really pretty eyes, but one star for all the rest.   This place, like most Mission Hipster type places, hire people with distain for everyone that isn't like them. Tattooed all over, poor, or poor looking, ratty unkept hair, bizarre sense of \"style\", if you can even call it that.

I'm not going to abuse the privilege of these guys pouring free refills, so I'll be tipping well and I won't be here every day to work or even every weekend, but when I'm in the mood to work here with friends, I'm coming. And I can't say that this enviornment -- with refills -- exists anywhere else.",

I got ID'd for the first time, so that was a milestone for me. Besides drinks, beers and shots, they also serve food: tacos, burgers, fries and edamame! I had a kale taco, and it was interesting because the avocados in it had a red (spicy I think) powder on it. Also the two small slices of watermelon served with the tacos were covered in it. Do not know what it was but it had a unique (spicy) flavor. The ambience was very casual and the place was a bit crowded. Because of where it is located, it really does not look like a bar until you are up close, so do not give up and look around if you are trying to find it!",

After a few bumps in the road delaying their original opening date, they're up and running now, and I couldn't be more thrilled.   Being the bar fly that I am, I've been looking forward to Oliver and J's new project since being tipped off at their former place of employment, Thieves. And after my first visit over the weekend, it was everything I'd hoped for and more. The space is huge (which is a bit of a rarity in this city), the Edison bulbs rappelling from the rafters give off a warm, inviting vibe, the staff is quick and efficient behind the racks, and most important of all, they've curated quite the lovely group of people to enjoy a drink around. Chalk it up to their impressive network of family and friends, but on the night I dipped in, I couldn't help but notice how good looking and energetic the crowd seemed to be. That may be a shallow observation, sure, but it is what it is. That's not always the case if you frequent enough watering holes around the city...  Being a neighborhood bar, they're darn near always open. Currently, they're open for roughly 12 hours a day beginning at 11:30am, and they've tasked the folks behind Chez Spencer with supplying bar bites that'd pique the interest of any self-proclaimed epicurean food snob. They feature a daily specialized entree Monday - Sunday with corresponding price points, they have a roster of permanent comfort food fixtures, and it looks as though they have a pretty fun little brunch set up for the weekends as well. Have yet to treat my palate to a taste of what they have to offer, but already being a fan of Chez Spencer, I can only imagine I'll enjoy every last morsel.   Though I love the coordinates of where my apartment sits, a genuine locals hang like this is enough to provoke me to peruse Craigslist just to see if there are any available rentals within stumbling distance. Maybe the best thing to happen to society since Callin' Oates (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.callinoates.com%2F&amp;s=35424e248ccec991c85fd72567d794cb1a329f89a69a6c99a645fbaf756d5e9d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">callinoates.com</a>)?

The bar was crowded though, and for brief moments it seemed almost impossible to get a bar tender to help us, but after the surge I saw the perfect opportunity to order a round of beers.  $5 for a Blue Moon. \u00a0Not too bad. \u00a0Yes, you can almost buy a six pack for that amount, but in San Francisco, on a Saturday night I have never paid that little for an adult beverage. \u00a0I was a very happy camper.

And Dear Mom definitely hit all of those points. Also great location. So if you're a beer drinker that likes open space, games and fun, stop here and give yourself the 4 star benefit. If not, keep reading and see why it dropped to a 2.   First of all, the drinks were terrible. Not just a little watery or a little too strong, bad. My friend sent hers back, I quickly switched to a bottled beer and at least 3 friends had the same opinion. Even their \"specialty\" drinks were not well made. My Beauregard was bitter, overly strong and not at all tasty.   Second of all, the food was overpriced and bland. For bar food, I want it to be delicious or cheap. Doesn't have to be both. I'm willing to pay for something different, but this was bland pasta, bland shrimp and grits, crunchy stale cookies, and a nothing special salad. Not worth it.   Finally, we happened to be there on a freezing day and they would not, no matter how many times we asked or closed the doors ourselves, allow the doors to be closed. A number of friends left because they were too cold.",

Like take a couple bites, serve some drinks, take a bite, etc.   drinks were good, average prices, but on our 2nd round of drinks we each had a bug in our glasses, so that was bad.

I started getting into whiskey last year so I'm excited that there's a wide variety here to try. They even serve food, so lunching here is most likely in my future.

The fourth edition to the former Thieves trifecta is a very welcome addition with its spacious interior, pool tables, central bar with lots of seating and it's large private room which makes up for in communal beer-hall style seating what it lacks in a private bar. The food menu is classic pub food done gourmand-style, their bourbon/whiskey selection and knowledge of their bartenders about it is just what you'd expect, and their Manhattans and sazeracs are on par with the Whiskey Thieves - in other words, very strong and expertly made.  Why only four stars? Like their counterparts, this bar is CASH ONLY. A huge pet peeve of mine when I'm spending lots of money on high-end bourbon. Also, the night we were here for a long-announced private party with scores of guests, the ATM was out of order. Fail. Luckily, it's not a long walk to the Potrero Hill shopping center. Also, the women's bathroom has a very odd and IMHO unacceptable set-up: there's two toilets but they're only separated by a screen that you can see right through so no one is going to leave the door unlocked so a second girl (or anyone else) can let themselves in to use the second completely unshielded toilet. If anything, I guess it's good for facilitating girls going to the bathroom in pairs as they often do anyway. Still, installing real stalls would be a big plus.",

This joint is a fairly large open space with a pretty big bar sitting in the middle. With large tables littered all of the place, Dear Mom is a casual spot to grab a bite - perfect for big parties. Decked out with distressed wood, dark tones and little hints of color throughout (they have a few bouquets of fresh flowers), this place is screaming \"kickback\". Think of the ideal place to grab a bite with your closest buddies before hitting the town. That's exactly what Dear Mom is.   SHOT OF WHISKEY &amp; A 24 OZ PABST BLUE RIBBON ~ $8 ~ 4 stars: I thought this was a great deal. You get a shot of mid-shelf whiskey. Not sure what kind it was but I did see the bottle and it wasn't well. Usually a shot will run you $6-$8, at least. So it was pretty awesome to get a 24 oz Pabst Blue Ribbon on the side to enjoy after you main vein the whiskey.   THE BURGER w/ BACON, WHITE CHEDDAR &amp; FRIED EGG ~ $17 ~ 4 stars: The burger by itself is $12. After adding bacon ($3), white cheddar ($1) and fried egg ($1), my tab came out to an even $17. I love how tax is already built into their pricing - I hate carrying loose change. The burger also comes with a side of fat home fries. They were the perfect starchy compliment to my ultra juicy and delicious burger. The bacon, egg and cheese paired so well with the FAT burger patty. Cooked medium rare, it was the perfect burger to soak up any booze you plan on consuming that night. Served on a soft bun, pickled cucumbers and lettuce, this thing is a must have. I absolutely loved it. Excuse me for the slightly blurry picture. I was already buzzed. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dear-mom-san-francisco?select=0eQ9L5oZpwvZINi1faTS8Q#0eQ9L5oZpwvZINi1faTS8Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dear\u2026</a>  Everyone got the burger except for my friend Adam. He got the Sriracha Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Although I didn't try it, I must say it looked and smelled amazing. He also scarfed that thing down in a flash so I'm assuming he dug it. A few other Yelpers have also given the chicken sandwich props so I'll be sure to try it next time.   Don't be afraid to pick your favorite tracks on their jukebox and play a game of foosball while waiting for your food.   Awesome place. Good food. Nice bar.   Dear Mom, I love you.",
