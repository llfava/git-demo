For me North Beach is far from tolerable on the weekends, but a great place to hang out weeknights. \u00a0Tony Nik's is great for many reasons. \u00a0It's small, unassuming, it has a core of regulars, and that really makes you feel like N. Beach is still a real neighborhood. \u00a0  The bathrooms are SUPER tiny. \u00a0Like something you would see on a train or a propeller DC 9 plane. \u00a0If you can get there between 4-6pm on a weekday, grab a spot at the bar, keep the vibe friendly, and keep it real. \u00a0Oh, and enjoy the cocktails!",

The bartendress was rockin with her cute pigtails and friendly smile. The \"regulars\" at the bar were quick to say hello and offer me a seat as they muddled away at a drink and talked about how much they loved their neighborhood and the bar and everyone you looked at was having a great time.  The surrounds were very retro, which I always love and while I wasn't planning on having hard liquor, well, when you are surrounded by a vibe like that and coming off a long and stressful week, there is no shame in having a martini with three olives on the slightly diiiirty birdy side.

Most unusually this is manifested in the pure cleanliness of the place. A cleanliness most often reserved for high end hotel bars. The exterior is non-discript, the only noticeable feature being the small wall of glass bricks. Upon entering the small house of spirits you are greeted with a medium length bar on your left with a small area in the very front holding a 2 person table between the window and the curve of the bar. The table and bar comprise a full half of the space. The remaining half holds two diminutive bathrooms and a dark but comfortable lounge area. The back half is partially separated by a curved wall of glass bricks mirroring the front. The bathrooms are just large enough to house the commode and a very tiny sink. really all you need and an efficient use of space. The lounge area comprises of a few tables and very well appointed benches and chairs. Candle light is the principle source for this lounge area.    \u00a0 Tony Nik's is run by the grandson of the original owner. The grandson takes pride in keeping it as close to original as possible and running it with the same care and ideals as similar gin joints of the era. That said, it is the cocktails and the bartenders that are on point here, complimented by a clean and sophisticated space. Come here for classic cocktails and superior service. Tony Nik's will not be a house that involves intensive modern pretentious mixology utilizing the herbs, spices and other odd ingredients that bartenders scavenged from the kitchen thinking they are a beverage chef.    \u00a0 The original drinking dens are going the way of the beautiful old movies houses that once use to liberally populate the city. The Castro is the only movie house that remains, Tony Nik's may be the only quality vintage elixir purveyor to grace our fine city.",

Last night, however, proved to be incredibly different. \u00a0I went here after spending most of the night at a different bar in North Beach. I was throwing a going away party as I'm moving to a different city this week. The first part of the evening at Tony Nik's was fine. My friends and I found a place to sit in the back and enjoyed our beers. \u00a0I went outside with a friend to have a chat and upon coming back in, went up to the bar to order a beer. \u00a0I'm standing at the bar, I make eye contact with the male bartender and \u00a0we nod at each other. As this is happening, he calls last call. \u00a0He then comes over to me and says he just called last call therefore I wouldn't be able to get a drink. \u00a0I pleaded with him saying that I was already at the bar when he called it, that we acknowledged eachother and that I think I should be able to get a drink. He was insistent in not serving me so I proceeded to ask the other bartender (or perhaps she was the barback) if she could help me in getting a drink. \u00a0He yelled at me that I wasn't allowed to do that. \u00a0I then walked away from the bar back to my friends. \u00a0  At this point, I was just ready to get out of there when the bartender comes up to me and my friends and starts yelling at me again!

I love sitting up at bars and talking to the barman - so we did just that, and I was keen to try a cocktail or two - so we did just that too! I went for one of the specials written on the board - some sort of orange citrus martini thingy. It was delicious, and the barman was extremely obliging - putting a couple of maraschino cherries in my drink because I love them! I then tried an old fashioned, and that too was delicious. They were not cheap, but man those drinks were good!  I really liked the music that they were playing - lots of recognisable, but not cheesy songs. The place seemed to be filled with grown-ups who wanted to relax and talk, and the whole experience was very pleasant.   My only complaint was that I was far too cold. The door was kept open the whole time, and 8pm in San Francisco at any time of the year is chilly... If they could sort the temperature out, this would be a fantastic place.",

Tony Nik's is upscale and classy, almost reminiscent of a hotel bar. Yet the prices are on par with other spots in the city and the drinks are exceptionally well-made. I think I ordered the Pegu Club (?) with gin and lemon juice and some other mystery ingredient (forgive me, I was already tipsy before entering). It was sour and won my heart.  It very much felt like a neighborhood bar -- the ambiance was quiet yet welcoming, and the other patrons were friendly. Great spot for a date, or to catch up with a smaller group of friends.",

The music was pretty chill and the crowd was great.   The other day, I took off from work and just went into the city. After cruising around by myself for a bit, I decided to go into this place again and see how it was when I was more sober. It was still great. There were only a few people inside and I ordered just a beer. The bartender was playing music off his iPod and it was groups such as Thievery Corporation, Nightmares on Wax and other chill groups.  I would recommend coming here with a small group of people (like 2-4) to start your night off. There's not too much room and I couldn't imagine it getting too crazy inside.",

So I order a drink, siddle up to the bar, and tell the patrons about who I'm about to meet. \u00a0So we're having a great old time. \u00a0Then my friend comes in and it's a great time catching up.  Then. \u00a0Well, I've considerably eased up since my college days, and I should have known that seeing an Aussie friend from college would be a drinking match waiting to happen.  Fast forward - 6 Vodka-Tonics later...all is good, but then he tries to kiss me, which is no good, no good at all. \u00a0Coincidental timing -- right about this time, the bar starts to fill up with people (and its quite small) so I take this as my cue to leave (that is, after the fat man next to me asked me to feel his behind...and oh yes, his date was next to him). \u00a0  Got soaking wet waiting for a cab too. \u00a0But, I'd definitely go back - the bar was lovely. \u00a0Despite the unwanted advances. \u00a0I'll give it four stars, because there's no window to climb out of in the bathroom.",

This isn't a bar to bring a date and talk. Even on Wedneday, the bar was pretty full by 10. It seemed like a nice mix of Marina/North Beach/Financial regular people, nothing too crazy.

It's crowded, the good restaurants have lines that are too long, and Golden Boy Pizza even fills up with the yougin' set.  On the weekdays, the regulars come back, drink their Gin and Tonics in a bar that looks new but seems to never have left the 70's, minus a new track or two on the jukebox. The bartenders seem to try to remember the regulars, which is a nightmare for most of the bars in North Beach.  The front of the bar has class -- even the regulars are slightly more formal that most of the other joints in the neighborhood. But it's understated, like a good martini.  The back of the bar is the perfect place to disappear, with it's slightly curved seating area and curtain that hides most of the area. Think dark, with a hint of bad.

I walked back to the bartender and said 'Captain Morgan!'. =) \u00a0The bartender asked if I wanted lime. \u00a0Again, I was confused..lol. \u00a0The bartender was nice enough to put it on the side, so I didn't have to go back to my boyfriend to ask. \u00a0The rum &amp; coke cost $6, and my boyfriend enjoyed it. \u00a0  I noticed at around 10pm, the bar got really packed and super loud. \u00a0Since we couldn't really hear ourselves talking, we decided to leave.  Overall, this is definitely a great bar!",

Only at that time I was rather drunk from pub crawling with my girlfriends during the NB pubcrawl.  Eeks!  But I did remember the bartender as he was super cool and friendly and made great drinks. And being a girl on my own until my guest arrived, I didn't feel weirded out, rather I felt comfortable.  Wednesday night was a good night to go. It was full, but not packed and never was loud to the point where I was shouting to my date.  Small, but a nice feel to it with simple decor and rocking music!!!!  The bathrooms were teeny and reminded me of airplane lavatories, but it may allow you to recreate any mile high club moments ;-)  Definitely will hit this place up again when I am in the neighborhood!",

I hope to chat them up next time and hopefully update my review.  Came in on a Saturday night with two of my friends. With an unassuming entrance in the middle of North Beach, the bar looks like a dive from the outside. It's quite the contrary.  Inside, the decor is clean, classy and clearly modern. It's longer than it is wide. The actual bar lines the left side as you walk in; there are small tables in the back with some booth seating.  Again, my friends ordered so I can't comment on the bartenders. However, they do make some great classic drinks! We ordered the following: old fashioned, martini, negroni, gin and tonic, and a whiskey on the rocks. All of them were very good. My negroni was craftily blended, smooth and strong.  The general atmosphere is pleasant, especially when you consider it's in the middle of a rowdy district. It's laid-back, and both the older and younger crowds seem to coexist peacefully. Scattered throughout are couples/two person groups and larger parties. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. They keep the music at a decent volume that still allows for great conversation.  This place has the thinnest bathrooms I've ever seen! There's one per gender. There actually ended up being a line for the men's while we were there, which I thought was unusual.  It never got too crowded (although we didn't stay super late). There was always room in the back. I think my friends and I had a fantastic time - and I expect to return often.",

The Girlfriend and I stopped in last night for a few rounds of yummie libations, and though there were a bunch of people in the place, we still found a quiet table to hang out at. The nice thing about TN's is that, for the most part, the only loud noise - during the week, anyway, from what I have experienced - is from people talking. They have music playing in the background, yes, but this is one of the few places that I have found which doesn't THUMPTHUMPTHUMP you out of the bar with your ears bleeding from the loud music at the end of the night. This place is more for those who actually want to talk to each other... isn't that just cool?! :)  We love ya, Tony Nik's! --------------   Possibly one of the friendliest and best places I have ever been. Tony Nik's is a cozy, friendly, down to earth, and all around nice place to go to relax on a weekday after work. This is the way a bar should be... good people, great drinks, comfortable to the point where even if you've never been there before, smile and say hi to the bartender and to those around you, and you'll fit in well. The only time I was there and didn't stay for a drink was on a Saturday night... I was with a group of about 8 friends and we stopped in for a drink around 9:30... the place was PACKED. I think there was a private party in the back, and the bar area in front was tight standing room only. We were sad that we couldn't find room to stay and enjoy the place, but no worries... we're going back again soon. Earlier, this time. :)  All in all though, I would recommend this place to anyone... but it's also one of the places where I'd like to keep it to myself as well, because it is such a nice place. ;)",

The music was fantastic (soul, chill, funk, rap) and the drinks were extremely good.
