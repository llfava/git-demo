We visited this fig and thistle spot on a Friday night and cozied right up to the bar. Great gal served our cheese plate and we chatted for some time...then some guy walked in and posed as a bartender. He asked if we wanted to drink anything, which yes we did want to drink \"something\" at a bar. Our drinks and charcuterie arrive...charcuterie was ok...not so impressive over priced $22.00 charcuterie (note Jardiniere has a mind blowing $18.00 charcuterie!!!) anyway I digress. So back to weird male bartender...as we were sipping and eating he proceeds to open up the little plastic case that holds pickles and nuts and proceeds to stick his bare hands in and grab food to put in his mouth! Then every few minutes he'd grub some more. I guess he was hungry? Onto the bread... dips his bare hands In the bread container...man handles the bread grabs a few then chomps away! All in front of the patrons..5 min later he was talking to some other chicks at the bar then reaches over to the grape bowl and BAMN grabs a few and tosses in his mouth. I feel bad for the owner..I'm sure she would have had a mild coronary should she have seen her hungry employee grubbing with bare hands in the food tray. I never saw homie wash his hands from man handling the iPad to man handling the bread to later on after he had his hand in mouth preparing someone else's charcuterie!!! Gross!   Maybe we'll go back for an expensive glass of wine..but who knows. And dude that serves beer and wine at this place...eat something before starting work!",

They do not have a kitchen so the food they serve will consist of Charcuterie or Cheese - the variety is good though and great for sharing! They also welcome you to bring your own food as long as it doesn't have a potent smell.  Good beer and wine selection - beers are by the bottle only (range $3-7 for small bottles and upward \u00a0of $20 if you get the large bottle which are great for sharing) but they have some wines on tap as well as wines by the bottle.

I was also really happy that we were surrounded by other folks who weren't in their early 20s. It was slightly sophisticated, but definitely not stuffy.  The wine and beers are all Californian, and they have a bit map of the state drawn on the chalkboard, with arrows to point out where each selection is from. Amy and I enjoyed some bubbles from a super interesting flute that held at least double the normal amount, so I felt the slightly higher than normal price for a prosecco ($14) was worth it.",

Located in the middle of an alley, Fig &amp; Thistle proves to be just that. \u00a0It is mellow on the outside and a great place to hide out from the main crowd if you are seeking a low key wine shop.  The inside is like an indoors patio lounge and there is some sort of charming feel to it.  They have a good variety on wine and some petite cheese, fruit, cured meat and cracker tidbits to order up and go along with it.

Advice to owners, get some fabric draperies or something that will better absorb the sound. The concrete &amp; wood design is overplayed in SF &amp; the effect is high noise levels.",

Angel and Francesca are warm and welcoming, and are eager to help you find a wine to your liking.   They set me up with a dry riesling that was crisp and sweet without that over-honeyed taste. It went perfectly with the cheese platter that I ordered, which had a generous slice of truffle goat cheese, mini-baguette slices, almonds, fig jam, and thinly sliced apple. They have a pretty good beer selection as well.  It's a very simple set-up, but one that has obviously been done with a lot of love and it shows.
