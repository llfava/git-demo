I love the chefs who work in the middle. They are very social. They check on how we like the nigiri and if you ask for something in particular, they are more than happy to make it. Be sure to try out their chef special hamachi. It's to die for! Best sushi in the Japantown mall!",

The have great sake selection at a perfect price.

It's pretty tricky to pick them up one handed so I would use two just to be safe!  Overall the sushi was pretty good. I spent a lot of money because I have expensive taste and wanted things like uni nigiri. They had a deal where they put out a whole tray of uni for $10 which is pretty legit. Having lived 4 years somewhere where uni is hard to find, it was a must have.   The tea came out super hot and I burnt my tongue so don't be a fool like me.   I think the rice to fish ratio was overall good except for the scallop nigiri which had way too much rice!   People were eating up the oysters left and right but I didn't get a chance to try it. Next time, tenroku!!",

    "review_text": "I've been here three times now and I love this place! It's so much fun because it's like eating + shopping at the same time -- two of my favorite activities. I came here with low expectations (1. it's in touristy Japantown, and 2. it's conveyor belt sushi) but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the variety.   The salmon is heavenly -- super fresh. I was surprised at the generous cuts, and that the sashimi is the same price as the nigiri. Hamachi, albacore, and scallop were all great. I tried two unique things that were really yummy: 1) the saba topped with ankimo and 2) herring with capelin roe. Loved the ankimo (if you love liver, you will love this), and loved the layer of crunchy eggs with the herring. They even had oysters, and they were good too. The $6 toro isn't the heavenly amazing toro you'd get elsewhere, but it's pretty good. The walu was good the first time, but stringy the second. The uni wasn't the best quality, I would skip it. Skip the tempura, the flour is too thick and chewy. Even though it's on the menu, they didn't have trout either time I came here.  If you plan on making a reservation here, don't count on them honoring it. Once I made a reservation for 4 at 7 PM on the phone, arrived at the restaurant, and the waitress laughed, said I was late, and told me she gave my spot away. I looked down at my phone, and it was exactly 7:00. Another time I actually made a reservation in person, told them I would come back at 6:30, and they still didn't have a spot open for me when I came back. Luckily, this shouldn't be too big an issue since it's almost like fast food and there's lots of seat turnover, but just FYI if you're trying to catch a movie or something.   The plates are color-coded for price, and you can easily order anything you don't see on the conveyer belt. The seating can be a little tight, but you usually don't have to wait!",

I had been searching for fresh Uni since the beginning of my trip in SF and pleased to see they had box of Uni Sashimi for $10. (About 8 pieces or so) Any sushi lover will know that's a real bargain.  The other fish sushi plates were extremely fresh and chefs were in constant motion trying to meet the demand of a very crowded restaurant. Constant smiles and laughter were a good indication of great quality food and service.  Staff were extremely polite, sincerely apologizing if they had a delay on any requests. Windows, table top and floor were clean. (You'd be shocked at the amount of sushi restaurants that's out there filthier than a frat house restroom...)  All in all, I was full from fresh fish and high quality rice coming out to $30 (after 20% tip).   Very happy, would come back when I visit again in the future.",

I thought they were delicious but my bf told me that most of the food on the belt was probably old and not fresh.

All three were pretty good. Id say the Dragon was the best one, then Alaska and spicy tuna. Tenroku also serves free hot tea.   I'm giving this place a 3 star rather than 4 because the food on the belt did not look the freshest. The edamame looked very dry and the raw fish in the conveyor rolls were not kept cold at all.

The few bad reviews don't serve justice, so I'm here to give them an honest, good review.   As a starter, I like it.  IMO, Tenroku is pleasant, clean and really offers a lot compared to their older rival, Isobune. Perhaps they are still new, but their service is great and staff is super friendly. The active sushi guys pay attention to you and make sure you have what you need. They have a good deal of o-toro nigiri for $6. Tastes succulent.   Sure, people complain that their prices are a little high, but which restaurant in Japan Town aren't? If you need cheap food, go to Nijiya for a slab of fresh fish and make your own sushi at home. That will save some bucks.",

What made me think the sushi nearby would be better?  I don't know. It was the contact high I got coming out of Kinokuniya. That bookstore always makes me so damned happy, and I'm gonna blame it.  Tenroku has minimal table seating and predominately caters to sushi-boat lovers. We sat down and ordered an Asahi for two and received some hot green tea to boot. I think I sat there and watched the belt loop around two or three times before slumping in my chair with the questionable \"rainbow\"-looking roll. With three pieces (priced at $4), I ate the California roll draped with a meager piece of salmon. I could've done without the mayo explosion (in the California roll), so I asked the sushi chef for a simple sake nigiri (salmon on rice). That was just fine. None of the silky creaminess that salmon usually has.  Look, I know I'm being incredibly nit-picky here, but once you get used to excellent sushi (which San Francisco totally has), everything else is just... sigh, not as great. Service was just fine, but because of the lack of food quality, I don't see myself revisiting Tenroku anytime soon.",

This is one of at least two sushi boats in the Japantown mall. I hadn't been to this one before and since this weekend was all about new experiences, it was a must.  All the plates have a clear dome covering it. I like that. We came in when it was still busy. Earlier it was more busy so we came back at a good time. Still people were in and out as long as we were there, so everything was very fresh. The uni was there the entire time... not everyone's fav apparently :)  The prices aren't bad. $1.00 - $10.00 plates. Average seemed to be ~$5 give or take. Depends on what you want and like. There were nice big chunks of sashimi and the rolls were usually 3 pieces. I don't like asking for specific rolls and this place certainly didn't disappoint by having a good variety. Depending on where you sit, you can watch the chefs make the rolls and then request some of that because it looks so good. They pass it to you with a smile.  Sushi and large beers makes us happy and full.  I'll definitely come back here.",

Since I was in Japantown, I asked my guy if we should just attempt to get some ramen from one of the restaurants in the Kintetsu Mall, to which he whole-heartedly agreed.  Our usual place is Katsu, but since it's closed for remodeling we decided to stop by Tenroku as we passed by, intrigued by the sushi conveyor. As we plucked our sushi from the belt when we saw things that looked appetizing, we perused the menu and decided on the ramen we wanted; however, apparently they were out of ramen (and something tells me it probably wasn't coincidental...), so we got udon noodles in our soups instead, which was still very good. Oddly, though we both ordered tonkotsu ramen we got chicken katsu instead, but the chicken was very good and the broth was very rich and flavorful. The portions were very generous as well, so much so that we couldn't finish our ramen after having the sushi as well.  All of the various rolls we enjoyed were fresh and extremely tasty, and it was cool sitting and watching the sushi chefs make the sushi in front of you and then plate it up to put on the conveyor. This is a fun place to come with friends or that special someone because of the atmosphere sitting at the sushi bar and having fun deciding which sushi you want and not always knowing what's in front of you.   Great restaurant in Japantown, and very friendly staff as well. Prices are pretty reasonable here, too.",

High end \"bento\" jewel box like square shaped arrangements...little portions for a pretty high price...and this was before the high tech hipsters with option$ rolled in. Maki wasn't that great to be honest...but compared to what we have now, some of us probably wished it never went away. I'm sure it is like Hong Kongers wishing the British would re-colonize Hong Kong again, and feel like a real ass democracy for once, instead of a makeshift puppet put in by Beijing. So much for high tea, cricket, rugby, milk tea, Britpop, soccer under a sea of redness.  The owner of Sushi Raw saw an obvious opportunity here for the space, and rightfully so...converted whatever small restaurant space into a conveyor belt operation. And business is brisk to say the least.  I would have to agree, Tenroku is a lot better than Isobune. And compared to other Peninsula options for sushi boat/moat/conveyor belts, far superior.  Tenroku easily appeals to the Cantonese speaking expat Chinese community. Good portions, a large wide variety, and even a few classics are well represented here. But you also have The Weird, The Whack, and The Freaks on display.  Salmon - when all else fails, hard to go wrong with this. Hong Konger run of the mill types see this as the definitive fish for sushi, and somehow, salmon sashimi = Japanese cuisine in their eyes. So if you are running a serious sushi belt or boat business and you do not have salmon, may the Chinese lords have mercy on you.  Anago - Can I just pay homage to Sir Mixx A Lot, \"I Like Big Cuts and I Cannot Lie\". For a sushi boat moat belt shop, the anago here is very decent. Of course please do not compare it with the greats in town who go through the painstaking process of preparing it and also pairing it with a molasses like consistency brush sauce/nikiri.  Saba - Nice big cuts. Not bad. At least safer than some of the dubious options  Crab - dry and not flavorful. Skip  Tempura jive ass roll - when you are hungry and other options are looking a little freaky and weird. Too bad it's room temp/cold  Lobster salad - unfortunately this was not good, surprisingly. Too mushy in texture. Please skip this and you will thank me later.  Now the weird  I've seen a few entire trays of sea urchin on these black rectangular plates doing the rounds. The one during my visit looked pretty sad....maybe 1/3 of it looked a tad too oxidized.... nobody touched it. I first thought these were the $2 plates, but those are black and round. So who knows how much they cost. I guess even the HK FOB types know what's going on...   There is some sort of crab or shrimp or lobster salad stuffed cucumber roll. But damn, it looks like some Cantonese prep of loofah/silky melon stuffed with shrimp paste and steamed....  Kimchi cucumber mini slices? Really?!  And many many other jive asssssss rolls.  If you navigate carefully in here, you will probably avoid the sha boo boo. :-o",

Here are something things to keep in mind:  1) Quality The quality here is good. It is not the level of quality you'll get paying $50 for a 10-piece omakase but I'd be hard pressed for pay the prices Tenroku charges and get better quality elsewhere. When there are lots of people the chefs are always putting fresh sushi on the conveyor belt so things are less likely to sit at busy times.   2) Cost We had mostly plates that ran $3-$4 each (for 2 pieces) except for the amazing scallon nigiri which was $5.50. For two people a dinner with a nice hot sake and enough sushi to really fill you up will probably run $60-70 for two... For the quality the prices are fair or even below market!   3) Environment This place is much nicer (more airy and more clean) than the other sushi boat place in the Japan center (Isobune). Importantly you don't feel like you're sitting low reaching up to the sushi boats. At Tenroku the sushi passes right at hand level - to keep this hygienic they use clear plastic lids on the plates. Would be more \"Hirojuku style\" without them but I'm glad for the cleanliness.  4) Service -- the waitresses and chefs are all super friendly and nice.   5) Reservations -- not sure if you can but try to get them or come at slightly off hours because the secret is out about this place.  All in all awesome place and I look forward to going back soon!",

If you're not familiar with kaiten zushi joints, they're essentially the same as sushi boat restaurants, but with a conveyor belt instead of boats. \u00a0Thus, if you've been to a sushi boat restaurant, you've essentially been here as well (did I mention I can be a sucker for gimmicks?). \u00a0However, compared against Isobune (Japantown's sushi boat joint), Tenroku ranks a little better.  Prices between the two are pretty comparable and while the variety at both is decent enough (if you want something that's not already circulating, you can order from one of the \"chefs\"), I really like how the dishes at Tenroku are covered as they circle around. \u00a0Though I'm not nearly as neurotic as Monica on Friends about cleanliness, I certainly appreciate how it lessens the chances of potential for flies landing on the food or people breathing/coughing/sneezing on it.  As far as quality goes, it's fine as long as you don't have high expectations. \u00a0Rolls are no better or worse than your average, Chinese owned sushi joint, but sashimi can be hit or miss. \u00a0The sake/salmon sashimi I grabbed was decent, but the hamachi nigiri had an odd color and not a lot of flavor. \u00a0Either way, it might be best to order sashimi from the \"chef\" instead so it's a little fresher (who knows how long they circle sometimes).  Although service here is pretty good, places like this simply can't compete with more traditional restaurants if you're looking for some legitimate sushi/sashimi. \u00a0However, if you're looking to try a kaiten zushi/sushi boat joint, Tenroku isn't a bad bet and better (for the most part) than nearby Isobune.",

I've gone in a few times during lunch, and there is always a decent variety of nigiri and crazy Americanized fusion rolls going around.  The quality is surprisingly for \"fast food\" sushi. The rice has a delicious, not too overpowering mirin (rice vinegar) flavor. I LOVE THE $10 for an uni boat deal. What a steal for a restaurant! The fish has always been acceptably fresh, although not anything to write home about. I usually go for simple nigiri rather than rolls, and here, they're quite good, especially considering you can get them on order here (service has been extremely fast for me), with a better-than-average price-to-quality ratio.  I do love the fact that this is one of the few (maybe only?) actual rotating sushi restaurants with a CONVEYOR BELT in the Bay Area. That is, not a boat.

Maybe wait until your customers are seated before precariously shoving things at them over an absurdly wide counter, or better yet, have the waitress or hostess place the sauce dishes down from the other side. And speaking of those waitresses, they frequently sneak up behind you and without saying anything (so that you know they are there) they reach right in front of your face while you are eating or talking to your companion, forcing you to dodge the dish covers that they are removing mere inches from your nose. Seriously - I realize that this is a quick service restaurant, and I've eaten in plenty of similar establishments in Tokyo, but the management of this place has really dropped the ball on training their staff.",

We both faltered when we saw the sushi boats (eek! sushi snobs do not like the boat thing) but thought screw it, we'll try it.  We were nicely surprised. We had a stack of plates - edamame, hamachi, which was fresh and buttery, the salmon, which was also fresh and butter, tender octopus, mackerel, and they made oshinko-maki roll just for Mumsy. The only thing she passed on was the ama-ebi which she eyed suspiciously.   Service was excellent and friendly, and the price was good - I would definitely come back if I needed a sushi fix on a Sunday. I'll give it a 3 and a half stars for the first time. :)",

    "review_text": "I didn't like the seafood udon and it gets one star for at least coming out hot. They really botched the soup and it was watery with a layer of oil on top. There was also a huge amount of vegetables compared to the actual seafood in there. The small piece of octopus had a poor, overcooked texture of a piece of rubber. It was hard to chew into and reminded me of a hardened wad of gum. The broccoli was insanely bitter and hard. I literally couldn't eat it because it tasted so foul. The same applied for the carrots floating around - they were sweet, but mostly bitter after sitting in the broth. As for the udon noodles, they were fine, but there wasn't that much in the bowl, so after a few slurps, there was mostly terrible broth left. I felt ripped off paying $10 for it. I might as well have gotten a vegetarian udon or use that money to get sushi.  That being said, I'll review the sushi since that's what Tenroku is all about: conveyor belt sushi. For conveyor belt sushi, it was alright, but I think it's a hit or miss. The prices are quite expensive and I could've bought full rolls for the more pricey plates between $5-7 which only offer 2-3 pieces of sushi. The cheaper plates will start at $3, but they contain the mediocre California roll pieces and inari sushi (rice wrapped in tofu skin). There wasn't any seaweed salad, gyoza, or other sushi pieces besides the old sashimi cuts and the same four rolls (salmon with lemon, eel, spicy crab, and crunchy shrimp). The point of conveyor belt sushi is to offer a variety and showcase sample plates at a cheap price, so Tenroku fails at that. The fish didn't seem too fresh for what I was paying either. They made too much of the same stuff and no one was taking the plates, which meant some of the fish that passed by, especially the sashimi, was heavily oxidized.  I came in and the place was empty besides a couple in the back corner. The waitress seemed to be a nice girl, but she was playing on her phone when I walked up to her, which screams, \"I don't want to be professional nor do I care.\" She also loved hanging out at the front desk area because after seating me and my partner in the back corner, I'd have to walk repeatedly to the front to ask her for a water refill. (Hey, I find it rude to yell across the room considering the center is a kitchen.) Miguel is a really nice chef though and if you ask, he'll make whatever you want. I suggest doing this because you're guaranteed a fresh roll rather than a stagnant roll which has seen better times. Overall, the meal cost $50 for two people, which was painful considering the food wasn't too good nor was anything about Tenroku impressive. I think Tenroku is meant to be a normal sit-down restaurant, but the conveyor belt is a tourist gimmick to help it stand out.",

Their sign saying $6 for O-toro is what drew me in.  I tried: - Gomae the flavour of the sauce was a bit watered down - O-toro the cut is too thick and I've had way better / fresher (at twice the price tho) - Grilled cod you can't go wrong with cod. This was lightly seasoned so the flavour of the fish stood out. - Amaebi it's not sweet amaebi that I'm used to.  Both the O-toro and amaebi were too big - I prefer the fish sliced thinner. \u00a0It seems the aim here is bigger portions for okay-ish quality. This is more for a beginner sushi diner looking for the novelty of conveyor belt sushi. Staff was very attentive and quick... they deserve a few stars for that.  2.5 stars",

For $20 we did not expect 8 measly thinly sliced beef slices that weren't even prepared properly. Real beef tataki is cold in the middle and quickly seared on both sides. Their beef tataki was just beef that had been sliced way too thin and basically a chewy raw, doused with ponzu sauce.   Sushi: NOT FRESH Price: OVERPRICED Verdict: Not coming back ever again.

If you have the same crap going round and round getting stale this doesn't work.   The current model at Tenroku to do high priced, low volume sushi is the opposite of what kaiten was designed for. It's like trying to do Costco out of a 10x10 foot strip mall with high prices.  Predictably, the sushi tasted bad. No offense, but the owners need to rethink this model.  I'm sorry but all of the 4-5 star reviews of this place are sketchy.

Tenroku Sushi is a fantastic place to stop in anytime to get a good, fast meal when in Japantown.   Conveniently located in one of the two indoor shopping buildings, the uber casual atmosphere of TS comes with some really nice unexpected touches. After choosing my seat at the bar, I was quickly greeted by a staff member and provided an oshibori (warm, damp cloth to wash with prior to eating, as is custom in Japan) and a steaming hot cup of soothing, complimentary Green Tea. Great first impression!  Then, decision making time. All of the sushi and various offerings pass by on small, different colored plates covered with a clear dome. The color of the plate represents how much that particular plate costs. You can also order directly from the sushi chef if you wish, but I found no need.   Tried basic Cali Roll, Fried Shrimp Heads, Marinated Cucumber with Fish Sauce, Shrimp Tempura, Tuna, a Combo of Asst Fish that included Salmon. All very good. \u00a0  Overall: Tenroku Sushi is a wonderful place to take a short break from all of the Japantown fun and get a good, fast, light meal at an adorable price!

    "review_text": "Tenroku is a spanking new conveyor belt sushi joint in Japan town. More specifically, it is inside the Japan Center building close to the bridge, next to Festa Karaoke and Bar.  The place is pretty tiny. There is a bar where the \u00a0main conveyor part is and a few tables (3~4) that seat bigger groups. The prices are moderately fair, ranging from $3 to $6. Just to give you an idea, Ikura sushi, Salmon sushi, and Tuna sushi were all on the $4.50 plate, which is really not bad. For a small person like me, it only took 4 plates to fill up which came out to be around $20. I'm sure a bigger man could spend at least $30.  The freshness of the fish was pretty good. Out of the things I had, I thought the salmon was pretty good. The rolls I tried were just soso, although I thought a roll wrapped with cucumber was pretty good.   I especially like conveyor belt sushi because you get to eat right away and you get to pick and choose what you want. All in all, I think this is a good addition to the plaza.  One thing - I think the rice in their sushi is packed too tight, making it kind of hard to eat. I don't want a mouthful of hard to break down rice, needing a glass of water to help it down.",

It's the perfect place to take your never-seen-sushi-run-in-a-circle child. \u00a0Besides the obvious draw of the moving feast, the food selection suits the little one as well. \u00a0He is not here to test the freshness of uni, elasticity of tuna. \u00a0I gave him a plate of octopus with tentacles sticking out and he is as happy as can be. \u00a0  For the parent, the choices are good too. \u00a0My hotate nigiri and salmon nigiri were both good. \u00a0And a plate of edamame for $2 kept me busy while watching my son \"savor\" the Ramune soda, sip by sip.   Prices are really reasonable, so it's not like you are shelling out $200 for a meal where your son tells you the best part was the marble that can't come out of the soda bottle. \u00a0It was a little over $40 for us, which I am totally happy with.   The place fills up around 12:30, but that's also when sushi choices become a little more varied and exciting. \u00a0So your optimal arriving time is within a window of about 10 minutes.",

They have a moving sushi stand so you can grab what you want to eat. But it they put covers over the plates which makes it awkward when you are grabbing your sushi. There wasn't much of a variety so we ordered tempura. When it came out it was in a togo box. We did not order it to go. The server figured out that it was not for us but someone else dining in the restaurant. We later got our tempura which was okay. But the tempura sauce did not taste right. How can you get tempura sauce wrong? Doesn't it come in a bottle from the grocery store? I also did not like that they only have high seating chairs. Won't be bad. Disappointed.",

The sushi going around wasn't too bad, but keep an eye out because some of them looked like they had been going around for quite a long time.

Unfortunately, we came during an off hour around 2pm and we were the only customers minus a couple who came in just as we were finishing up. This meant that a lot of the sushi has been rolling around for quite a few rounds and we could see the discoloration, especially in the tuna. However, the salmon looked fresher and tasted fine. Not to mention that since we were the only customers, I was allowed to keep asking the chefs to make rolls just for us too so we did not have to eat the non-fresh ones on the belt. They were chopping up things like green onions, but happily obliged to make me unagi nigiri when asked.

I had several orders of a shrimp tempura style role, a salmon roll with lemon and unagi (eel) here. All were amazing.

We had 9 different plates and a tempura our bill came close to $50, fish is pretty fresh, but some of the sushi stay on the belt for a long time, like the Scallop sushi had been circling the belt the entire time we're there, so pay attention on what you pick, and lack of many of my favor like Kane (crab leg), Toro (fatty tuna) and Hokkigai (giant clam) which are often available in other sushi place.   No parking validation is a draw back, garage parking in Japantown is getting expensive lately :( but we did have a good time there, will likely to come back and hope they have more to offer in the future.",

    "review_text": "I always get weary about sushi boat type places as I've been to a couple of bad ones. I always see the same plates go by uneaten and with the occasional fly lingering around.  BF took me here just to look. I wanted to eat here right away since the fresh looking nigiri on the conveyor looked so yummy. Plus I love nigiri.  I got really excited and picked up two dishes right when we sat down. The fish on top of the rice was a good size. They took all of my requests from the menu because I didn't see them on the conveyor.   Service was prompt. They were so swift that I never noticed who came by each time and took the plastic lids. Also, in my opinion, the plastic lids kept the food clean.  I ate a lot. At times I had three plates in front of me. It's so easy to eat like a pig here. What I got...all nigiri.  *True Toro - That's what they called it. Soft and buttery and the marbling was nice. I ate three orders of this.  *Hotate - Pretty good. The scallops were a bit too cold though. I ate two orders of this.  *Albacore - Had some garlic on top and texture melted.  *Amaebi - Just okay. It was too cold and the kinda too bouncy in texture.  *Butterfish - Tried it and it's a pass for me. It was a bit rough.  *O-Toro - Not bad, although I liked the real tuna better.   Other things my bf got:  *California roll - Good...not much to say about a California roll.  *Tamago - Apparently super good since bf had like 5 plates of them.  *Salmon - Didn't try this.  I don't remember all of the things he ate since I was busy stuffing face. I shall come back. Too bad it's so far out of the way for me.",

    "review_text": "Your first question - I know it's coming so let's just get it over with - is how this place compares to Isobune, which I've visited 200+ times over the past 15 years. I asked myself that approximately every 15 seconds while having dinner at Tenroku last night.   I gave them both four stars, and I think they're very similar food quality-wise. You might even say they're kaitenical, and yes I do require an up vote if you got that.   I do like the atmosphere (the plating, the boat style, and just the general environment more) at Isobune. but this place didn't disappoint in the least.",

Seating is only around the conveyor belt. Everything was expensive- our bill came out to $90 and we weren't even full. I would say each of us had an average of 5 plates but every plate you reach for adds up quickly and unexpectedly in price. Each plate starts at $2.00 (for example, edamame) up to $10 (for example, a plate of uni). I wouldn't mind pricey sushi if the fish were fresh and delicious but they weren't. Overall, nothing spectacular here and I would never crave this place. Definitely experienced better.",

Heck, even the Japanese Tea Garden is filled with Chinese waitresses! That said, let's move onto the rest: - Good selection of fun american rolls as well as nigiri - Fish I've had has always been fresh  - Consistent service and food any day of the week - Friendly staff, tea constantly refilled without asking  It stacks pretty well against Isobune, which is only located on the other side of the bridge. The presentation is better, staff is nicer, seats aren't as crammed, and I prefer eating in a well-lit, clean environment with nice and clean floors. Prices aren't all that higher, so my preference has been to come to Tenroku instead. They have updated their price sheet to include a $2.5 black plate for tamago and edamame, as well as directions on what to do with all those lids.. please put them aside instead of back onto the conveyor belt (I think this comes after having too many pile-up accidents).  If you're trying to find it, it's across from the bookstore, right by the bridge, hard to miss!",

We only ordered 3 dishes from the conveyor:  1. Salmon avocado maki: good, decent 2. some sweet escargot/snail sushi. My caucasian boyfriend was curious. and described it as \"chewy\". I had to eat the rest of it -_- 3. Uni. I love uni. the coloring seemed a bit off but tasted great and a 2 huge pieces for $6  We ordered: - lobster tartare ($6. it wasn't entirely lobster - had roe and horseradish in it, but worth it) - sea bass steak ($12) - huge filet of seabass. also worth the money but had bones in it - chicken karaage ($6) - a bowl of fried chicken. delicious! - otoro, hamachi, and waru sashimi. \u00a0The waru was especially worthy it given the $3.5 price tag. \u00a0The otoro was decent, especially for $6.  Our total bill came out to $55 for 2. \u00a0Not bad for sushi and not bad for a total paleo meal!",

    "review_text": "I know conveyor/sushi boat is consisted quite gauche in some sushi loving circles but the 10 year old in me and the French Spouse loves the idea of endless options served immediately. Sadly what usually happens is you have low quality food or really basic rolls that are bland in taste.   Tenroku's sushi and maki are a step up in quality and taste than most kaiten places including Isobune just down the hall. Normally I would never get amiebi or uni at place like this but both were freshly made and of a good quality.  The space is smaller than most US kaiten places and they cover the plates which I like but some people might find annoying. Since it is a small place there probably wasn't as many dishes out but we never lacked in choices and the server was quick to take our order for anything that was out. The space is very clean and modern, there is one booth but the counter is bar height and not wheelchair accessible.  The prices range from 2-6 for most dishes which is actually lower than other places especially for the quality of the fish.  This is a place to taking the visiting mid-west relatives or get a quick bit before a movie at the Sundance theater.",

    "review_text": "First time here. Tried this place because one of my friend don't eat raw fish but everyone else wanted sushi boat. Chinese owned. Everyone was speaking Cantonese. I liked the newly remodeled place. bright and clean (but maybe a little too bright). Little plastic covers over your sushi was a plus. We've been to places where we put sushi covers back on the conveyor belt. So my friend had placed her first cover back on the conveyor belt and happily continued on with our conversation. But then, we got cut off by the sushi man immediately. He removed it from the belt and asked her to leave it on her table next time; causing everyone to look at us like we're stupid. I understand each restaurant runs differently and we respect that. However, I wish they would have placed a sign or at least have the waitress instruct us on what to do with the plastic covers; instead of giving us the dirty look.   The fish there is okay. Some tasted fresh and some didn't. The uni and unagi is very good. \u00a0There was this one nigiri with seared white fish and ankimo on top; it tasted so bad i couldn't finish the rest. It did not taste like fish! Maybe because it was seared, it had a plastic taste to it. The fish tartar looked nice topped with caviar but the fish did not taste fresh. The green onions in it tasted as if it was chopped on an unwashed cut board, giving it an extra bit of unwanted flavor of ginger, garlic, and onions. The Tamago nigiri was a joke! Lots of fancy new sushi ideas. I usually like new ideas but some of these just did not tasted good. Just give me some \"real\" sushi please.  Overall, everything was ok. Most likely not returning. Sorry, but I rather go to Isobune...",

Most of the options were pretty much one type of underlying sushi with a different topping or sauce on it.

Tenroku, though it is not super high-end quality Otoro every time, still beats the other places in terms of prices ($6!!!) and phatttt ass cut.
