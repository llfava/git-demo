Got seated and took awhile to get our menus but it was okay since we were watching the game. While we waited to get our food, we were offered free shots! Cool! So my mom had some apple cinnamon shot and I had the Jameson shot. Not a good idea before eating and on an empty stomach... But it made food taste that much better hah. I had the crab melt and I loved it! The tomato bisque that comes with it is a bit spaghetti sauce tasting \u00a0so I didn't like it much but the crab melt it's led with avocado and bacon, was bomb! I liked the salad that came with it in the side. We also ordered the sweet chili habenero wings which was a bit spicy but a good spicy! My mom has the tri-tip steak which was a little overcooked for me but my mom liked it. The fries were typical and a side of salad was yummy! Definitely wanna come back for the crab melt since I live just down the block :)",

    "review_text": "Gosh, I truly hate writing negative reviews. Deep down, I want every business to be a winner and succeed &amp; shine &amp; make buckets of money. So I'm truly sorry to be giving Wild Hare just 2-stars after my recent visit.   This spot used to be Solstice Lounge back when I lived in the neighborhood. A year or so ago, they sold it and transformed it in to a more sports-friendly/tater-tot-loving restaurant/bar. I came in a few times before I moved out of the hood, and I thought the place was a reasonable addition to the neighborhood.  Some friends and I came here Sunday evening after catching a matinee down the street (@ the Vogue Theatre). At 5:30pm, it was the only nearby bar open for biz. Immediately upon entry, you could tell something wasn't right with this place. There was no one at the hostess stand to greet us. We sat ourselves at a communal table, only to gradually realize that there were no servers working the floor. The other patrons were drunk and loud football fans who just kept shouting obscenities at the TV.  We finally saddled up at the bar to order drinks. It took a little bit to catch the bartenders' attention. The young kids working the bar seemed busy just hanging out with each other and oblivious to their customers. My friends and I finally ordered a few beers and their signature Wild Hare Cocktail and some sort of Fernet concoction. Now let's get one thing clear - I'm a pretty open-minded cocktail guy. But the beverages these guys served up were downright horrible - almost undrinkable. My friend (who's a liquor rep for a notable spirit company) gave up on her Fernet About It libation after 2 sips. My Wild Hare libation tasted like it was infused with gasoline (no joke).   The entire atmosphere was so uninviting and the drinks were so dismal, we finally decided to just cut our losses and leave. I'm really sorry to say these negative things, but Wild Hare really let us down. It was like the grown-ups left the house and left the kids in charge. This place needs to grow up a little before I return any time soon.",

    "review_text": "It has taken me awhile to get over that Wild Hare is no longer Solstice. After a mourning period, I've accepted that my one of my fav hood spots is gone forever, and have slowly moved on. On several occasions, I've met with my support group to \u00a0reminisce about our good ole fun times at Solstice, and attempting to embrace the changes made at Wild Hare.  As soon as I saw truffle on the menu, I was a goner. Nothing else on the menu mattered to me. I'm a huge fan of truffle and typically order anything truffle if on the menu. How excited was I to find out that there was truffle popcorn, truffle fries, and truffle tater tots! Truffle Heaven!   Of my Wild Hare outings, here's what I've ordered:  - Crab Melt with Bacon, Tomato and Avocado - tasty gooey cheese and ample amounts of crab! Make sure you have at least 2 napkins to eat this bad boy!  - Tater Tots - Must order and add truffle (of course)! Perfect tots with crispness on the outside and tato goodness on the inside. FYI, with tots and fries, you can order with crab or a la wild hare (cheese curds and gravy, as the Canadians call \"poutine\" (eh?)  -Truffle Popcorn - Must order, and super fresh popcorn with truffle oil on top. Greasy fingers (and napkin required). watch out as I could finish it all in one sitting, so act quickly if you want to try it!  Decent selection of wine, beer and specialty cocktails. Check out Happy Hour specials!  Vibe here is fun, lively, and can get loud. This is a popular hang out group, as well as a date spot! I literally saw a couple go from shaking hands upon meeting to swallowing each others tongues by the end of the meal. It can happen, so you've been warned, as it could dampen your Wild Hare experience.  Will always remember you Solstice, but I'm embracing the change. Change can be good! Cheers to you, Wild Hare!",

First of all, let me say the service was hit and miss. The first waitress we had was ok. A group came in after us, but somehow we were asked to move -- not that they came afterwards anyways. Once we migrated to the bar, the bartenders were fun and attentive. Our main bartender changed the tv channel to our game too, excellent.  Food on the other hand, was a different story. The menu looked great, but what came out of the kitchen was not up to expectations. I ordered the French toast and my bf ordered the corn beef hash. My plate contained 2 pieces of french toast, and my bf's plate contained corned beef mash -- pics uploaded, you can be the judge.

They removed the heavy curtains from the windows and generally made the \"restaurant\" part of the floor into a bunch of high bar tables. The atmosphere is markedly different and more bar-like now, which is a good thing because something needed to change when Solstice closed. Beer is unreasonably expensive, at $6 a pint, though some of the upper end liquor is quite reasonably priced. Unfortunately, the crowd now seems to be a healthy mix of woo woo girls and AMF pounding bros. It's like you're in a National Geographic documentary about the post-Hellenic collegiate experience. But you can't really control who comes to your establishment, so I can't fault them for that. This bar has good bones, no doubt about it, but Saturday nights are a shitshow. I'll stick to weeknights.",

The deal was $25 for two brunch entrees, bottomless sparkling spritzers and two shots of fireball. Our bill was $70 and to only pay $25 was insane so we tipped well.  This places is a seating free for all so come early or be prepared to stalk tables as they finish up their brunch for a place to sit. We were lucky there were two seats at the bar.  The spritzer menu included (among others) a blueberry basil one and a watermelon lime one. Both were delicious and truely bottomless. We had maybe 9 each while watching the Niners game. We tried mixing them together but they weren't as good. There was also an Aperol drink but that was a little too aperol-y for me so I only ordered it once. We ordered the Dungeness Scramble which had a chipotle aioli and was really hardy and scrumptious. We also had a burger with a fried egg on top and truffled popcorn on the side. Unfortunately, they seem to have forgotten the truffle on the popcorn, but it was still good. Then of course, fireball shots to end the meal.  -On Tuesdays they do $2 tacos and $20 margarita bowls -There's four tvs in the main room and each was showing a different game. Warning: Apparently this is a Broncos bar as they changed the channel on the TV we were closest to from the Niners game to the Broncos game. It was weird. -Somewhat of an Alice in Wonderland themed bar, but it could be more \"themed\" in my opinion.",

    "review_text": "Wild Hare is a decent place, which I consider \"Bar Food\" in a bar atmosphere with a slightly more diverse menu than a typical dive bar, but is more expensive than going to a standard restaurant where you get better service (not that the service here was bad, but it's bar type service), ambiance and an actual dining experience, as well as a more complete meal (and more bang for your buck too).  So, if you're looking to drink and eat, where alcohol is the foreground than this might be a good spot for you. \u00a0If you're looking to eat and drink, where the food has higher importance, you might do some research.  The music was a tad loud for conversation given there was no dance floor. \u00a0The ambiance and lighting was a tad dark, and dining seats a bit cramped.  They seem to specialize or have a claim to fame with their \"Tater Tots\", which I know from living in Los Angeles is trendy hipster white trash comfort food cuisine that is en vogue when a restaurant just adds cheese wiz and other things to dress it up and charge more than the $3 it's actually worth. \u00a0They're not bad, but in my opinion, nothing special you couldn't do at home and maybe even do better and cheaper.  The other dishes were so-so. \u00a0The fried chicken in a bucket were more like small pheasant or game hen sized pieces; the Lettuce Cups were not really cups more than a fist full of lettuce hard to use as cups; so it's pretty clear they're not (yet) committed to making this more than a hipster bar that serves overpriced food with fancy names (good marketing), but without a lot of substance. \u00a0I think they can definitely improve to strive for a higher standard of excellence in many areas, so this can be a diamond in the rough spot looking to shine and sparkle in the future.   The service was friendly and somewhat attentive as one sexy barmaid can be while servicing the entire restaurant of patrons and juggling multiple tables. \u00a0So, she deserves credit.  Oddly, they have bathrooms located up steep stairs, which in a bar, with drinking, spills and darkness is a recipe for a future disaster and accident waiting to happen. \u00a0I also heard the bathrooms were kept in a little less than to be desired condition.  Parking in the area is of course on par with what to expect in San Francisco, if you know how to parallel park and don't mind walking it's not that tough to find legal street parking.",

Finally i made eye contact and about 5 min layer she came by to take my order. Took about 15 min to get my food. Ordered the hash plate, and it was good but it was sittin in a pool of oil. After she dropped my check it took 10 minutes to pick my credit card. Dissapointed and wont come back.",

I like how they've opened up the space, and especially like that they kept the fantastic wooden bar.  The food is meh, in common with the other establishments these folks own. The signature burger-in-grilled-cheese is a total joke. It's far too big a meal (about 7 times what you should be eating for dinner), difficult to eat, and not tasty enough to justify the serious excess involved. Other appetizers were reminiscent of Solstice but a pale shadow of their former excellence.  Drinks: the namesake Wild Hare ale is actually pretty good. Others reported their were \"ok\". Compared to other places in the Bay Area, they serve a notably limited selection of local beers - just the really big brewers and their own brand.  Service: Appalling, just like all their other locations. Staff having long chats while we wait for drink order taking, about 10 minutes to get drinks in an unpacked bar, about 25 minutes to get food, served luke warm.  People: If it's not prime-time, it's a nice crowd. Other times: smells worse than Harry's Bar (man-BO times 100), and at least one person is going WOOO at all times. Unfortunately, that's the crowd this place is aimed at.  I'll probably come back again to see if they've tuned things up along the way and give them a second chance, at least.",

    "review_text": "A few months ago, I wrote in my review for Stock in Trade that I've seen bottomless mimosas either be a great start to the day, or a great way to end it prematurely. \u00a0On this occasion though, it was BOTH. \u00a0While I had a great time, Voldemort (aka she-who-must-not-be-named for her sake, as well as mine) just wanted to go back to bed...  Things actually started out well enough, with our planned reunion happily coinciding with the last day of Wild Hare's Living Social deal (two entr\u00e9es, two shots of Fireball whiskey, and bottomless mimosas). \u00a0However, thanks to our fellow procrastinators, the wait for a table was almost two hours! \u00a0At least we were able to start on the mimosas while we waited (for better or worse...).  -- TOTCHOS...$10 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wild-hare-san-francisco?select=MAquFxxStipfCcBrY5mWWQ#qc8-DfdMCAaVFKqL7QHSDg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wild\u2026</a>) Tater tots served like nachos. \u00a0Not much else to it, but what's not to like? \u00a0The tots were really crispy and made for an awesome bar snack. \u00a0While I wish they had the Dungeness crab tots on menu instead, I'd definitely get these again.  -- THE BURGER served with Farm Cheddar (choice), Butter Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Pickles...$9.50 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wild-hare-san-francisco?select=qc8-DfdMCAaVFKqL7QHSDg#c--4Bz030-4iAA2rNT937Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wild\u2026</a>) Even though the LS deal covered for as many condiments as we wanted, we only added Bacon (+$2), Avocado (+$2), and a side salad (+$3). \u00a0For the most part, the burger was fine but unremarkable. \u00a0The bun was dry/burnt and while the patty was cooked nicely, it didn't have a ton of flavor without the cheese, bacon, and avocado.  Given the large headstart we had on the mimosas, Voldemort was already starting to fade when our food arrived. \u00a0By the time we got our shots of Fireball, she was done (we gave them to the girls sitting next to us). \u00a0Can't help but wonder how much easier it would have been if Harry Potter only had a carafe or two of mimosas!  Although I wouldn't mind coming back for the Totchos or to try the Dungeness Crab Tots, I doubt I'd come back for the mimosas without a deal. \u00a0I've seen it busy here regardless of the weekend and they don't take small party reservations. \u00a0Still, I can't say I had a bad time, even with the wait. \u00a0Now Voldemort, on the other hand...I have't talked to her in weeks, but I wouldn't be surprised if she's still hungover.",

While Wild Hare did not disappoint me and I would certainly return, I have had better experiences at some of the other restaurant of the group.   I came in for brunch on a Sunday with four other people, three of which were already there when I arrived and had gotten a table in the middle of the room. I was a bit shocked to see it so empty, when pretty much everywhere with brunch (much less bottomless) has a huge wait on Sundays. However we must have gotten there at the right time because it filled up quick.  While the menu looked good, and different enough, I felt that it disappointed slightly, as did many in my group. I ordered the chipotle eggs benedict and it was good, but I just expected better. I tried some of the dungeness crab scramble and it was tasty, but again I was very underwhelmed with the lack of flavor. One of my friends ordered the kale caesar salad and was presented with an inedible pile of kale with about a tablespoon of dressing on the side.  The service was the main reason for my lack of star(s). It was extremely slow and though they were quite busy by the time we were leaving, it was to the point where we were seriously annoyed. Their priority seemed to be keeping our mimosas bottomless, and believe me - no complaints about that! However we weren't even able to order our food for about an hour. And getting the check was quite the process.  Despite it's shortcomings, Wild Hare is a fun place to go for brunch and I will probably return.",

I've tried it a couple of times but the totchos don't seem quite as tasty yet (Bullit seems to have better toppings), the punch bowls are too sugary (I'd rather spend my calories on totchos than try to get a buzz from a few shots of vodka hidden amongst 4 liters of sugar juice), and the bar doesn't really transport you anywhere decor wise. In spite of all this, I trust these guys enough to give it another shot every couple of weeks to see if it improves. Keeping the kitchen open until 1:30 is definitely awesome on their part. Some of their fresh fruit cocktails are pretty on par with those from Lion's Pub so if you want a but more breathing room and bar bites head here.",

This wouldn't be a big deal if they told people about it earlier, but now my party was forced to pay almost $6 to get money from their in house ATM (two of us) just to pay our bill. I would've gotten $$ from my own ATM had I knew.   The waitress said they have no manual card reader or Square and that we had to use their ATM. No discounts for the $5.50 we had to spend just for the privilege of paying our already overpriced bill.   Crap happens, this was just a really annoying and pricey way to handle it.

Last time I had came here, it was just to taste their gastopub food. They had yet opened up Brunch. Many months later, I'm back for another run. Sunday brunches are packed, Saturday brunches has its wave of crowds. SATURDAY BRUNCH!!! We came around 11 and sat ourselves at the booth. Bunch is from 10-3, no rush.   On that LS deal... $25 its 2 brunch plates, bottomless mimosas, and shots of fireball.  HEFER STATS.  BOTTOMLESS SPRITZ MENU ($18) - bottomless mimosas. My favorite of the list was the Hugo. I stuck with Watermelon&amp;Lime and Hugo. Hugo - prosecco, elderflower, soda water and fresh mint = BOMB DOT COM. The watermelon &amp; lime - prosecco, soda water, fresh watermelon &amp; lime. My date had the Basil &amp; Blueberry, Hugo, and Aperol Spritz and the favorite of all was the HUGO. They serve them in little small mason jars, cute idea.   DUNGENESS SCRAMBLE ($14) - Dungeness crab, fresh tomato, scallions, avocado &amp; chipotle aioli servered with toast. THIS WAS SO GOOD. when a place serves r-e-a-l crab you cannot complain. it reminded me of the tater totz with crab, except it was just with eggs. We shared food, worth it.  THE HASH PLATE ($9) - Corn beef hash &amp; two eggs, topped with farm cheddar served with toast. The eggs covered the cornbeef hash. The hash was okay, more hash then corn beef but it was still good. i love cornbeef hash, this was good just different texture then what i'm use to. we shared food, worth it.  FIREBALL SHOTS (??) - By the end of the meal, we were on a good one. Topped it off and start our Saturday with Fireball shots. WHO DOES THAT!!! lol, apparently, we do.   COFFEE (?) - It was strong and legit coffee. Not sure what kind of beans they use, forgot to ask.   Will I be back? DUH!!!! you dont have to ask me twice.   JABA APPROVED.

The first time a tame argument started between my friend and another patron, we were asked to leave. The other patrons were allowed to stay. Rude, but I understand. Drunk people in bars often get asked to leave and the bartender isn't going to see the entire sequence of events. However, the second time was totally unacceptable/malicious. I stopped by the bar to say Hi to the manager on Saturday. I was with three friends at the time one of whom was from work. I had seen the manager at the bar Friday, and she told me she would be working Saturday starting at 5:00 PM, and I should stop by and get a drink. The second I walk in the bartender from the first incident starts pointing at me and shaking her head. She refused to serve me and insulted me in front of a co-worker. Very awkward situation. Ironic, that the manager told me to stop by, and someone who works for her had the gall to be so disrespectful.Moreover, as an aside I like everyone else in the bar and often tip north of 30%.

Bartenders amenable to making custom (and very tasty) cocktails which I always appreciate.   What prompted this review was my last experience at Wild Hare. I was eating at the bar and it became evident (probably by the fact that not much was missing from the plate when I gave the sign I was finished) to the bartender that I did not like what I had ordered. Not because it was bad, per se. It was just too fried and too rich for my taste. Anyway, the bartender noticed and proactively asked if I wanted something else. I was impressed. Had a burger that was very tasty and went home happy.",

    "review_text": "Bring back Solstice. The food menu looks tempting, but then you can never get served. Their special drinks are atrocious and the service is overall horrible.  We walked in on a Friday night at about 9pm and were told that the kitchen had stopped serving temporarily. No explanation given. When we asked, all we got was, \"I don't know.\" Highly doubt that. When asked if we wanted to grab a seat anyway, she then told us she'd check on the kitchen status, so we decided to take a seat and relax.  15 minutes go by and we are waiting still for our drink orders to be taken. When the waitress finally comes by, she doesn't mention anything about the kitchen, so we ask her if she found anything out. Her response was that they'd stopped serving until they can catch up with the order flow, which made a ton of sense. We asked her if she could keep us posted, which she agreed to do, and then took our drink order.  No joke, 20 minutes go by, the only drinks that were delivered were to our two friends that ordered the tall Tecates in a can. And she walked by our table at least a dozen times with no explanation. She finally came over and mentioned that our drinks would be coming soon, that they're just a bit backed up. As for food, they are still not serving. Meanwhile, 2 other friends who arrived 15 minutes after us went up to the bar and got handmade cocktails in under 10 minutes. I would have gotten up, but she'd already taken our order and we all thought it'd be rude to go over her head and make the complaint.   Finally, our drinks arrive and they were horrible. The blackberry whiskey I think it was? concoction had no flavor and the tequila lime option must have had a pound of sugar. We had waited so long, we just drank our drinks. But back to the fiasco with service...  Around the same time our drinks came, our friends saw another table open up in the downstairs area, where Solstice used to have a second bar that is no longer there. They sat down and within 5 minutes their waiter offered to put in a food order for them and got food in under 15 minutes. Now, I find it rather odd that there were 5 other people at another table only 20 feet away who asked 3x if there was a way to get food and didn't get any. Especially as we were super super polite, being funny eager with her about wanting the tater tots, MUST HAVE TOTS type mantra, while we had waited a decade for our drinks, patiently.   I know when places get hit hard it's not always possible to keep up, and yes, the job is hard. But when you're a new establishment, you should be better prepared. Also, you should give you waitresses the power to help make the experience better, like giving a free drink as apology for waiting a half hour for service and a drink. Either get more servers or ones that can be more consistent with their service.",

Service: I was ignored by the bartender for a good five minutes while standing directly in front of her with nobody else other than a guy who had already ordered a Guiness was waiting for a beverage. Not that I need to be served immediately but the way she glossed over me three times without acknowledging that I was waiting to order something rubbed me the wrong way. Not only that, but when taking my order I was made to feel as if I was an inconvenience by doing so.   I was ordering a draft beer.   Ambiance: whatever. Lots of empty tables and TVs all over the place. Could be a good place to watch a game or two with a mid sized group? Music is a good vine but terrible selection. Weird techno 80s remix. That's not too bad though.   What's bad is the fact that I was served a beer in a mason jar. I do not like this \"concept\" or trend or whatever it because: A) it's played out.  B) mason jars are not designed with the beer drinker in mind so they suck to drink beer from.  C)I don't take bars who serve all their drinks out o mason jars seriously if they over charge for their beverages (see below)  Pricing: I just paid $6.25 for a Lagunitas IPA at 6:15PM on a Thursday. Out of a mason jar. In 2014. No happy hour? Even if there is no happy hour, why is it $6.25? Most other bars charge $4-5. Maybe $6, but that extra quarter is obnoxious.   Given the pricing, service, and ambiance of this spot I can safely say I will never return and I do not recommend it to anyone.",

Stay tuned for their brunch service!  With a choice of booth seating, the communal table and two top table seating, we decided to sit at the bar. Luckily we did, as Josh was our awesome bartender. The staff at all of their 743667 bars are always friendly, down to earth, and attentive so the owners are definitely doing something right.  The Fog Cutter ($10) was my choice of poison: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F115QOuf&amp;s=4f18ad12be129f0c83803e26d7d842675cfe8a03bc46721d0406612caf4da7ff\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/115QOuf</a>. The gin, raspberry and ginger beer concoction was deliciously refreshing and after two, I was WHOOO HOOO status.  Being a fan of Dr. Teeth, we had to get an order of their tots. The Dungeness Garlic Crab Tots ($11) to be exact which were gut-bustingly good: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F17BCtsW&amp;s=abfdc1cd3f7a0f8a1ca7606884f7ee0aaa3342c464fe7b9a28246268a5fa5839\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/17BCtsW</a>. The Tempura Bacon ($9) however, sounded better then it tasted: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FZlklQB&amp;s=20a6ac7900a34c3c173cc28fa627064a4068065b78a71125862013f42cab31f6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/ZlklQB</a>. The batter was more like a soft corndog batter then an airy, crunchy tempura batter but bacon is bacon right? You can never screw up this delicious porker.  Parking is a biatch in the area so come early. But not too early like me. All my WHOOO HOOO pre-dinner cocktails made me a grandma and I spent my Saturday night passed out in front of the TV sleep watching \"Thank you for being a friend...traveled down the road and back again...\"  Don't hate, you know you can't get enough of Blanche, the southern belle who made being a slut A-OK! Who else can get laid left and right with shoulder pads and hideous Hammer time pants? Love her.",

I've been eating there 1 or 2 nights a week since they re opened. Last night the service was embarrassing. The bar is full of dead drink glasses, and a hand full of people. I don't want to sit at a dirty bar so I stand at the bar trying to order for what seems forever. Finally one of the bartenders asks what I want. I order 2 drinks and a sampler platter. I then go sit at a clean table not 5 feet from the bar. The waitress comes over and asks what was the vodka drink I ordered again. Then comes back again to ask what I ordered on my appetizer platter. Order 3 times for a 3 item check? OK. Now we are waiting forever again. The 2 bartenders are talking to 4 people with balloons ignoring everyone else at the bar. I tell my girlfriend \"I bet our food is just dieing in the window while she talks\". My girlfriend goes and looks in the kitchen, sure enough there's out food. Bonnie has to ask 5 times and get loud before the bartender realizes someone else exists other than her friends. She brings our food, now lukewarm at best. We eat, and sit there forever again until I go up to the bar and ask for our check. There are 2 bartenders and 6 people at the bar, but yet I can't get my bill? The bartender is not happy and gives some shity smirk before she rings me up. Then when she hands me a check she says\"Just so you know we don't have waitresses\". Why are you serving food then? How the fuck am I supposed to order if there is no service? Do I go to the kitchen and order? Or do I go to the computer and put my order in? As stated I liked this place and have been going there since they opened. But since there are no waiters to serve me anymore I won't be eating there anymore. Good luck treating the few customers you have like shit.",

    "review_text": "I was super excited to come here, having heard about their great tater tots and tasty cocktails. And, well, that much is true. Ladies and gentlemen, they have great tater tots and tasty cocktails. My fella and I had the Seek and Destroy and the Cloak and Dagger drinks (MMM!), which were very creative and paired interesting flavors together: rum-chartreuse-pineapple-mint for the former and whiskey-blackberries-mint for the latter.  But there are problems. For one, we got a 3-tot sampler as an appetizer, and this was definitely listed under \"appetizers.\" When we ordered, the server had told us that the normally $15 sampler would be \"priced up\" for the more expensive kinds of tots, so we figured the difference would be $4-5 extra.   Believing this to be a typical appetizer-sized appetizer, we also ordered entrees: the burger with Swiss cheese for me, and 12 BBQ wings for him. We expected maybe 7-10 each of the Wild Hare tots, buffalo chicken, and totchos. What we got was a plate of THREE full orders of each kind of tot. While you might say, awesome, what a deal, it was shocking. We gaped at the plate and when the server came back, asked if the entree orders had not been put in yet, to cancel them. The kitchen had already started cooking them, so we just had them put straight into to-go boxes.  The tots were totally good, though the totchos (tater tots covered in nacho fixins) were little more than novelty. The Wild Hare are basically poutine tots, which is always great in my book, and the buffalo chicken sauce was pretty tasty. But it was just huge. This is a two-person meal. And it was NOT $4-5 extra, the sampler came out to $25. Which is essentially $3 off of actually ordering the three full orders of tater tots. Had this been what we were hoping to have for dinner, that would be great, but we had two other entrees in boxes, which ended up being the wrong order anyway.  Finally, the decor would lead one to believe that it's a classy, old-timey style gastropub, but the place contains 5 TVs showing ESPN. A strange and not quite fitting detail.",

They have a great selection of cocktails - describe what you're in the mood for and your waiter/bartender will guide you to the perfect pick. However, what primarily differentiates Wild Hare from its competitors is the delicious bar food. I tried the fried chicken bucket, mac and cheese and the fish tacos, all of which were equally delicious.   So not only is Wild Hare a watering hole, but its also an eating hole, if that's even a thing. Give it a whirl on your next trip to Pac Heights!  P.S.

Normally, the bottomless spritzes alone are $18, so we were excited to use our deal here. Unfortunately the experience was a little disappointing. We arrived around 1115 since we knew from other reviews that this place would be crowded and still ended up waiting about 45 minutes. While we waited, we started our bottomless beverages at the bar, so that helped to make up for it. However, the bar was crowded so we had to stand the entire time. Additionally, a group had reserved a certain number of seats, then told the staff that a certain number wasn't coming, and so the host led us to sit next to them. (Which I wasn't thrilled about, as the tables weren't separated.) Right as he led us down to our seats, the other group responded that the rest of their reservation was, indeed, coming. IMO, if you tell a host that they're not coming, then you lose your reservation, especially in a place with a very long waiting list. However, the host obliged and apologized to us instead and said we would be next up. Fine, whatever. We'll just have another drink. We did sit down about ten minutes later and got immediate refills in our drinks. I didn't really like the champagne they used as it was too bitter and didn't add much flavor besides that. The drinks are truly spritzers, ie, they are not heavy on the taste at all. I was very exciting to try to Hugo but was disappointed. Honestly, they tasted watered down. I will say that they were great about getting us refills, though. The food was unremarkable at best. My friend ordered a veggie scramble and was served a crab scramble. My breakfast burrito arrived cold and didn't have any flavor to it. Country potatoes were meh. My companions had similar experiences with their food, including scrambles, breakfast sandwiches, and the hash. We did, however, love the tater tots - they were fried perfectly and had a great garlic taste to them. They were the favorite. The shot we had was Fireball and was so good we decided to get another round, which I believe cost in the vicinity of $25 (expensive for a low grade liquor.) The place was packed with the typical 20-something mixed bag San Fran crowd. Music was a plus. It was one of those \"hip\" places, you know, where you can go to pick up a one night (day?) stand and hope it turns into something real. We won't return. It's not worth the price or the wait.",

I appreciated the nice service but I basically wasted $80 worth of hard earned cash here. Bring back Solstice instead!",

    "review_text": "Wild Hare, are you a bar, restaurant, brunch place, dating (Tinder!) hot spot, or all of the above? I'm not sure. Apparently it's the number one Tinder bar in the city (if you don't know what Tinder is, good for you).   I'd say get here early on a weekend to continue your clubbing tour from the nite before (loud and pumpin' electro music) and/or keep on drinking (full bar).  On the other hand, you can also get decent brunch/breakfast here (Eggs Benedict, $10) , only the coffee seems a bit overpriced ($4.50 per cup). Portion size was good and food came super fast.  Downside: the service - waited for about 20 minutes without being recognized by the one waitress serving the whole place, which wasn't packed at all at 11.30am on a Sunday.   The bar is intriguing though and I'll definitely give it a shot next time (literally).",

Really hard to get seats (there was a Giants/Niners game on), but I enjoyed their Greyhound (with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice) and they had these amazing tator tots. I think they were their tator tot nachos (instead of nachos, they used tator tots, which I'd much rather eat.) Nom nom nom!",

    "review_text": "I had my first experience at Wild Hare this past Labor Day weekend &amp; it was interesting. Not great, not horrible, but just OK.  We went for bottomless mimosa/spritzer brunch on Saturday at 12pm. The place was completely dead, which I thought was weird (but it was a 3-day weekend, so that explains it). But since the place was dead, you would think the service would be great, right? NOT THE CASE.  The service was slow &amp; shotty. Our waitress while really nice but ordered 1/2 the tables food at one time, then did the other half at another point. Weird. Then, for bottomless mimosas I constantly had to ask for refills. What's the whole point of BOTTOMLESS if I'm constantly asking for refills? Sorry for being a whiny B, but I'm trying to get day drunk!  The food &amp; drinks (when I had one) were pretty good! Big menu with lots of options for all diets. I ordered Chipotle Eggs Benedict &amp; it was delish! My friend also ordered Totchos to share and they were SO GOOD! I also enjoyed the variety of spritzers -- my favorite was The Hugo.   We stayed all afternoon until bottomless ended (3PM) &amp; I left happy, but not drunk like I have at other restaurants. While the food was good &amp; they had a good variety of things available, I'll probably go elsewhere for bottomless &amp; brunch in the future!",

The people working there are sooo happy and wow talk about never letter your bottomless mimosa sit empty. They kept filling it even without asking.  The bad parts. I really wanted to love this place location great! Drinks and libations great! Nice digs inside, meh it was nice especially with the tvs and a great bar counter, service fantastic! food so-so. Sigh the food sounded sooo good on the menu. Friends did enjoy their breakfast sandwich and veggie omelet. I had the bis cuts and gravy, hmm bis cut was tepid at best but fresh but the gravy was cold and egg not that hot either. Wife had the marscapone french toast which was a mess and soggy. Eeeh the drinks made up for it and the fantastic service. I mean like amazing service.  I do definitely want to stop by for the taco Tuesdays!",

    "review_text": "Purchased a LivingSocial- totally worth it! Wasn't too crowded at noon on a random Sunday, about half the rather large restaurant was filled.  I got the crab omelette, which honestly wasn't my favorite (hence the minus 1 star) though recommended by the waitress. Barely any crab, very saucy. I don't know. My friends ordered the beet/goat cheese salad with grilled chicken, however, and that was DELICIOUS. Coming back next time for that.  Bottomless mimosas were great since there are multiple bellinis/mimosas you can order, and the waitress kept coming around. We were in a huge group and they accommodated us! We also got a Fireball shot w/the LivingSocial.  I would come back without the LivingSocial deal, since service is great, the salads seem delicious, and the atmosphere is a great fun brunch place in Pac Heights. No complaints, very typical brunch-SF-SundayFunday feel!",

Battered fish tacos were well prepared, light and tasty even though I usually like the fish grilled. I would have preferred a broader beer selection but the 4 on tap were adequate. Also, the chopped salad could included more ingredients but nonetheless was fresh and a nice complement to the rest of the meal. Atmosphere was fun and lively. TVs were showing a couple ballgames so all was well. Definitely a solid thumbs up.",
