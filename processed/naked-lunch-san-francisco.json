    "review_text": "We came here after reading good reviews online, and gravely regretted the decision. \u00a0I felt so strongly about them deserving a low score that I had to create this Yelp account.  Let me put it this way: they've got one person taking orders and four in the back assembling sandwiches. \u00a0Within the first 15 minutes of us standing there holding greasy number cards with the tip of our fingers, they cranked out 2. \u00a0No wonder a sandwich that's mostly bread and lettuce costs a whopping $16... gotta pay everybody's minimum wage, right?  In this dark and dirty hole-in-the-wall with an ambiguous name amongst strip clubs and sex shops, we stood helplessly for 35 minutes before getting our orders. \u00a0In that much time someone on Food Network could have slaughtered a whole pig and made sausage, and it would have tasted better than my sandwich. \u00a0Thanks to the wait, all five of us missed an important office meeting.  What's worse was their management skills and attitude. \u00a0Several people arrived much later and got their orders before we did. \u00a0Just because one guy claimed to be in a hurry, they bumped his (large) order ahead of ours. \u00a0Well, I sure hope that guy didn't have to miss any meetings. \u00a0When we complained, they gave us lame excuses that were untrue and made no logical sense. \u00a0No apology and no respect for their paying customers.  In conclusion, if you don't know what to do with your time, don't have enough intelligence to be insulted, and enjoy staring at ugly strippers across the street, Naked Lunch should be your destination.",

The Fried Chicken sandwich was really not that good...unless you like the taste of gooey fat or chewy almost rubbery chicken saturated in mayo.

Oh and finding some chicken hairs still on the skin was a bit unappetizing.  The lemonade however was good. \u00a0Not overly sweet like other places. \u00a0And I did like the bread they used for the sandiwch.

Naked Lunch specializes in expensive and good sandwiches that offer a variety of surprising taste combinations.  The other day, they were serving a whole fried soft-shell crab sandwich for $14. For that cost, you could be rolling in nearly 3 feet of sandwiches at Subway.  Their beverage selection is tasty and unexpected too: cinnamon sweet tea, coconut lime juice, and basil lemonade.  Word has it that they are expanding into the large space next door. In the meantime, the booths are available to sit in. This is good because the main restaurant has minimal eating space inside, and only a small table or two out front.  It's not on the menu, but I recommend ordering the \"Omnibus.\" \u00a0This sandwich is a mega sandwich made from all the sandwiches on the menu. It costs the same as buying them all individually, and is so big that they have to custom order a take out bag from a big and tall store nearby.

    "review_text": "After hearing about this place from Genevieve, I finally tried it on a weekday morning. It's a simple process:  a) check their website for their daily menu  b) choose from the selections, some regular and some daily specials  c) email, call, or fax them with your order  d) pick up at appointed time  At 11:30 am, I placed my telephone order and he told me to pick it up in ten minutes. Here's what I had:  1) Potato and Garlic Soup - A cup of creamy potato soup with a subtle yet rich garlic flavor. Taking it to my office, it was just warm, but still very yummy. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K9aoButJPQD15rbA5HZMqw?select=lVIBtbwj83nYALTDcpqjqg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/K9ao\u2026</a>)  2) Duck prosciutto and Foie Gras Torchon Sandwich - Yes, this sandwich is as rich as it sounds. Tender duck prosciutto (is that a meat?) was delicious. What kind of sauce or spread on the bread? None needed as the Foie Gras made the sandwich plenty moist. Seeing Acme Bread paper bags lined to the side, no need to ask for their bread source. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K9aoButJPQD15rbA5HZMqw?select=3ujNcB79YivVkcIcp28wwg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/K9ao\u2026</a>)  Overall, a very nice, gourmet lunch. The cashier immediately informs customers that, if they'd like to dine-in, they are welcome to seat themselves in Enrico's outdoor tables next door. Rating this a 4.5 star experience, minus 0.5 star for the limited menu... but what do you expect from this small place.",

So as you can tell from fellow Yelpers, it's all about the foie gras sandwich at Naked Lunch. \u00a0Yes, it's a $16 sandwich, but they're quite generous with the foie, so it's well worth it. \u00a0It comes with a little duck proscuitto to add a little saltiness, as well as heirloom tomato and butter lettuce.  It's just one of those sandwiches that you have to savor...savor...each...bite...mmm.... \u00a0It's like those times when you get a piece of sushi or sashimi that is simply sweet, tasty, fatty perfection, and you just want to take a bite and savor it before taking another....mmmmmm......

I must've asked the bartender about five times, \"Can I get some olives?\" His response? \"I'm sorry, we are reserving our olives for customers who buy martinis.\" Fair enough, but my party purchased a total of about 20 shots of tequila within the few hours we were there, on top of all the beer and food. He was only able to spare me TWO OLIVES. He wasn't rude, but his response was just unjustifiable, especially after I saw that they had a huge bucket of olives in the kitchen. Let me just say, the container may have been as big as my torso. It made me wonder a lot of things. How expensive are these olives? Is the purchaser of the olives on vacation and cannot purchase more for a while? Were they expecting 500 orders of martinis that night? It was mind boggling why I was deprived of olives after the beau and I alone spent almost $200 at the bar.  As for the food.. the beau ordered the cucumber soup, which was a huge mistake. It is served cold and was super liquidy. Why isn't it thick? Did someone forget to simmer this so the soup can thicken up? Did someone forget to add some heavy whipping cream? They might as well have served it in a cup.  My three stars are for the fried chicken sandwich and fries. I'm not big on sandwiches, but this one was so juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside, with just enough seasoning. I'm also not a big fan of fat fries, but these were fingerlickin' good!",

We went, the pulled pork was sold out, and the vegetarian option was based around asparagus, so we went for the dungeness crap and the foie gras to split between us.  The foie gras torchon was undercooked and raw, my sister described it as a \"salt lick,\" and true enough it was not cooked through and you couldn't taste it through the overwhelming salty flavor. Nor could you taste the prosciutto. My (pregnant) sister had to put the foie gras sandwich down immediately, \u00a0The tomatoes were pretty wan, to boot.  The dungeness crab was also salty and lacked any noteworthy characteristics, overwhelming the remoulade and other elements. The pickled vegetables were good, though. \u00a0  The cinnamon sweet tea was good, and needed to get the sodium bite out of the mouth. \u00a0Seems like it was a super off day from the other reviews, and maybe I'll try again, but I will rarely ever throw food out and both of these sandwiches went unfinished.

Time until food arrival, probably about average.   Food:  Pretty darn good, but a little heavy on the mayo in some cases. We had the fried chicken sandwich, short rib sandwich, brussel sprout sandwich, and the fries. The fries are fantastic. Thick cut with plenty of seasoning. The bread on all the sandwiches is great. As a whole, each sandwich is very good (4/5 stars), but nothing is blow-you-out-of-the-water type of good.   Overall: For lunch, a good, reasonably fast place with SF quality food.

There's a reason why they're only open a few hours a day and a few days a week! It's because these guys KNOW how to make a BOMB sandwich; they don't need to be open 24/7! The environment is so chill and the customer service is awesome. I always feel welcomed here, and am never rushed with my order. Even when I leave, I get a free refill! HOW AWESOME IS THAT? They only use the freshest ingredients to makes their foods, and they make everything themselves. The drinks are good too and plus free refills at the end if you're done.   Their fried chicken sandwich is so good, nothing can compare. The buns are toasted just to perfection, and the chicken is so juicy. I usually don't get cole slaw on anything, but for this sandwich I'll sacrifice because it goes so well with the chicken. The ultimate sauce though, is the hot sauce. YOU MUST PUT THAT ON THE SANDWICH, it's like it was meant to be - the hot sauce and the chicken.   The lines are long but when you get your food, it's definitely worth it. I try to get their when they first open, so I don't have to wait. But for their sandwiches it always seems like I play the waiting game. After consuming my sandwich, and celebrating those 20-30 mins of happiness, \u00a0I die a little inside just hoping to make it throughout the week so I can have it be Tuesday for another awesome lunch at Naked Lunch again.   Tip(s):-bring cash! I think they have a card fee.  -They're only open from 11:30-2 on the days they open.",

    "review_text": "As the culinary bar is continually raised, and in an age where everyone is a \u00a0\"foodie\" we see new ideas, concepts, and culinary bells and whistles. And seriously, who isn't a foodie these days? Know how to snap an iPhone picture, know the definition of sous vide, formulate a critique, and voil\u00e0 you're a foodie with a Yelp page to be read by the masses. I digress.   The concept at Naked Lunch is a novel idea bringing higher end meats and proteins with other fresh organic ingredients to create fine gourmet sandwiches. The headliner on the lineup is the Foie Gras Torchon &amp; Duck Prosciutto Sandwich with Heirloom Tomato, Butter Lettuce, and Black Truffle Salt at $16. To accompany my \"foodie\" feast between a sliced, crusty Acme roll I ordered the Melon Agua Fresca at $3.  The Foie Gras Torchon &amp; Duck Prosciutto Sandwich tasted better as I read it in chalk on the blackboard menu than as I devoured it bite by bite. Don't get me wrong, it was a good sandwich but it seriously read better than it tasted especially at a $16. At such a price point and with such ingredients you would expect high level execution and taste. While good, the sandwich could've been better on many levels. The first thing I noticed was the odd, jelly-like consistency of the foie gras torchon. I would've liked it to be more of a p\u00e2t\u00e9 consistency, and left me yearning for a traditional Banh Mi sandwich with liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 ($3.50 at Saigon Sandwich. The duck proscuitto was tasty but the serving was small, and it left me yearning for a Prosciutto Sandwich ($6 for a small) from the sandwich institution of North Beach, Freddie's Sandwiches. The sandwich was also sporadically overly salty at times which may have been a function of the truffle salt.   The Melon Agua Fresca was different from most every version I've had before. This was not the dressed up, leftover juice of melon cutting you find elsewhere. The agua fresca here was a frothy cup of melon goodness with pur\u00e9e of melon accented with what seemed to be vanilla and/or cinnamon. A bit sweet for my taste, but it was the best agua fresca I had ever.  I'd like to go back to Naked Lunch to try out their soup creations, the Salty Dulche de Leche Ice Cream (from a third party vendor), and the Fried Chicken Sandwich on Tuesdays, but I feel this is more of a new fad place than the start of an institution. To reflect on my previous digression we live in a new age of food where all you need is to mention foie gras or truffled, and the masses will come streaming in and sigh your praises. With this being said, we sometimes lose the simplicity and more importantly the soul that good food has.   I could be wrong about this place, and I do like the new culinary bells and whistles at times. But you can keep your $16 foie and prosciutto sando for now while I indulge on a $3.50 banh mi from Saigon Sandwich, a $6 prosciutto sando from Freddie's, and still have enough left over for a nice IPA and a bag of sea salt &amp; vinegar kettle chips.",

Definitely disappointing, would have thought that two former restaurant chefs would know more about how to let ingredients speak for themselves.",

One time I went there, and they had a \"special\" menu of all thai food, ew. Another time they were closed for a private event (thanks for posting that small detail on your website). They don't serve french fries at lunch time (makes no sense, like that's hard to make). They run out of supplies, \"sorry we are out of figs, but we can substitute pears instead.\" I hate pears no thanks. What good is good food when it's so hard to get. Stop trying to be a trendy hipster place and just serve people what they want, jesus.  AND THEN...one time I come in for a late dinner. Mid meal the dude interrupts me and hands me a paper plate and asks if I wouldn't mind using it so they can clear my dish. \"Sorry the dishwasher really wants to go home.\" ummm ok.

While it was tasty, it was somewhat salty, likely because of the rich ingredients. The sandwich was upon a soft, not chewy Acme Bread roll, which held up very well. The foie gras was layered on surprisingly thick and the duck prosciutto is what added the extra layer of salt. Duck prosciutto is much softer, silkier and tenderer than the traditional type. \u00a0The sandwich was delicious, yet is better to be shared. A whole sandwich was just too rich and too everything for me. It would be good to trade halves with someone else and order an alternative sandwich. The cinnamon sweet tea was awesome, but the highlight of my lunch was the 4505 Chicharrones! These chicharrones were so crispy but melted when they touched your tongue. Slightly spicy, slightly sweet, these were by far the best chicharrones I've ever had, period.   Although the location is small, there a outside, covered patio area next door that they use. Great for people watching, and they will bring you your food. I just wish they were open on Sundays.",

The sandwich had \u00a0a crispy and well seasoned fried chicken filet that was complimented by the garlic aioli and slaw. In my opinion their fried chicken sandwich tastes better than BakeSale Betty's. But BakeSale Betty wins on size of the sandwich, as Naked Lunch's sandwich was small and probably a healthier portion size. The sandwich was $8. I give the sandwich a solid 4 out of 5 stars. I loved the sandwich and the only reason that I took a star away was just because of the portion size, but I would order it again.   I also had the Yukon potato and garlic soup. The soup was creamy, frothy, and just so-so. The description on the menu sounded better than the soup really was. The cost $6. \u00a0I give the soup 2.5 stars. You can skip the soup.  I washed down my fried chicken sandwich with the cinnamon sweet tea. The sweet tea was tasty, sweet, tangy, with a hint of cinnamon flavor. A few of my fellow co-workers also had the sweet tea and we all agreed that it was a big hit. The cinnamon sweet tea is $2 and I give it a whopping 5 stars.   In closing, Naked Lunch is not the only thing that is naked in San Francisco's red-light strip club district. The restaurant's Fried Chicken Sandwich was a crispy, crunchy, poultry treat and highly recommended. I also recommend the cinnamon sweet tea, but do not recommend the yukon gold potato soup with garlic (i know, it sounds so good, but just failed to hit the mark at $6).",

It is pricey however for a 'wich so be prepared to spend mula and be sure to call in your order ahead of time...line can get long...  Enjoy this one rascals!",

The next day I had a shrimp mousse sandwich and it was almost as good. \u00a0The next day I had the cold cut sandwich and it was a bit too raw. I only tried the cooler once, but it was good. \u00a0It had plum and basil and some other stuff. \u00a0There have been days when the cooler sounds quite interesting, but I will keep on trying them. \u00a0Eating on the patio is a nice touch. \u00a0The chairs are big, comfortable, and great for watching strippers head to work. \u00a0Minus one star for being too expensive for me to enjoy everyday. \u00a0 Plus four stars for being good at everything else.",

    "review_text": "I work a couple blocks away and was stoked about finding a new, delicious-looking lunch spot! I called in my order and appreciated the friendly customer service both on the phone, and in the restaurant! The gentlemen working the bar honestly made the experience very pleasant. The establishment is spacious, clean, and appears to be a fun hang out spot (although I'm never in the strip-club area haha!)  The chicken sandwich was so tasty! The Iced Tea was nothing out of this world, but still refreshing on a warm day.  The reasons for deduction of two stars: *I felt the chicken sandwich was a little small, but I decided that the quality made up for the size and price.   *What really pissed me off was the size of the soup. The second time I returned to explore the menu, I decided to try the soup (I don't remember which one it was exactly since the menu changes; maybe the creamy asparagus?) I paid, grabbed my to-go bag, and when I got back to the office, pulled out a SMALL coffee cup, 2/3 full of soup....I know I paid over 7-8 dollars for it....not ok.... \u00a0 Co-workers and I were looking at each other laughing, wondering if that was a joke.  I'm willing to try this place again. But some places need to understand that just because you make good food, doesn't mean you can serve them in pigeon portions.",

    "review_text": "Chicken fight!! Chicken fight!!! Chicken fight!!!  Ok there isn't really a fight nor is it just chicken. More like Fried Chicken Sandwich, conflict.  Over the past few weeks I've had some pretty good fried chicken (sandwiches included). There was BakeSale Betty's, Ad Hoc and now I add Naked Lunch to my list of Bay Area fried chicken hot spots!  We had the day off yesterday and the only thing I kept thinking yesterday morning was...It's Tuesday &amp; \u00a0FINALLY I can get my hands on a Naked Lunch fried chicken sandwich. I didn't care that I just had fried chicken the night before @Ad Hoc. There would be nothing that stopped me from visiting Naked Lunch. Except the gf....oh wait she was down to go too. So we're good.   We get there @11:45. There wasn't a serious line there. More like 3 people waiting and a few patrons already eating.   Looking behind the register I saw a big bag of Acme Bread on the prep table. That is cool because Acme Bread is a staple in our house, so the good vibes began to flow. We placed our order for 2 chicken sandwiches and some Cinnamon Tea. The clerk was very nice and really cool, explained to me exactly how she makes her tea(which I will attempt) and even offered us a refill if we wanted one, while waiting on our order. Refill really?! SLLLLLLUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\u00adrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrpppp-p-p-P-p...sip sip. I'll take that refill now. Sorry to be greedy but that tea is WOWZA and I mean really really WOWZA!  With it being a small place I can see it getting packed but they are pretty efficient and do a great job of getting orders in &amp; out. Haven't seen that kind of efficiency except from Willy Wonka Oompha Loopa's. Too bad they didn't have a cool song too?!  We got our order pretty quickly and decided to take it to go. Finally got to sink my teeth into their sandwich. First I tried it with no hot sauce. This is a good sandwich, not as crisp in some places because of the slaw but still good. Tried it with the sauce (by the way they get SUPER BONUS pts for giving us hot sauce without even asking for it....did I mention it's Crystal's?!). With the sauce even yummier!!   Loved the flavor of the chicken and to wash it all down with that cinnamon ice tea.....yeah that put me in fried chicken sandwich heaven. I feel like I could literally taste the LOVE they put into making it.   I've come to find that there are some special fried chicken/fried chicken sandwich spots in the bay. The good ones have their own special way of doing things and put a lot of LOVE into their product. Naked Lunch falls under that category. I like BakeSale Betty's but I like Naked Lunch too. I'm just glad....CORRECTION...blessed to live in a area that offers multiple great options and plan on exploring these options over and over again.   2 sandwiches and 2 teas(with 2 refills) for 20 bucks even-steven is a very great deal for the quality of food &amp; service you're getting.",

I was shocked and my friend and I swore he must be changing the keg or something... Five minutes later he came back and asked if I still wanted to try (like how you ask a toddler something) the IPA or if I would just order it. I said i'd still like to try, and he said \"well, now these girls are ready to order, so it'll be awhile\" and walked away again.  I'm not exagerating, he was 3 feet from the IPA tap, and it was not a biggie for me to ask to try it.  Yes, it was st. patricks day. Yes, I was wearing green.

The voices from the fancy girls of Broadway enticed me like the Sirens did Odysseus. Some were singing songs of bargains, while others were humming the melodies of lust. But my resolve was firm and my will was strong. I was going to see Mary, and only Mary.  I looked into my wallet. I had eight $1 bills. That alone would suffice, but I always bring an extra $2 for Mary. I know she appreciates the little extra tip. I looked over my shoulder one last time and walked into the establishment that was my destination.   I nodded to the bartender and ordered a shot of whiskey. I casually asked for Mary and he smiled. The bartender knew Mary well, and said she needed 10 minutes to prepare herself. I grunted at the notion of having to wait for her, but inside, I was delighted knowing that Mary would freshen up herself for me.  Mary appeared before me almost in the nude. She was lightly dressed with cole slaw and a thin coat of crispy flour. Her large breast overwhelmed the two pieces of Pain de Mie that barely held them in. I tried to appear composed, but my saliva betrayed me. I was excited.  I pulled Mary into me. As I put my lips closer, a rush of anticipation took over. I can imagine her. Her enticing aroma, her welcoming appearance, her succulent touch and...... a pang of guilt.  What would Princess Carewee think? She would be decimated by jealousy. I stepped away from Mary and sent Princess Carewee a message.  \"Yo I'm at Naked Lunch eating the Mary's Farm Fried Chicken Sandwich without you. I'll bring you here next time if you promise to read all my Yelp reviews ok?\"  Feeling much better, I returned to my intimate moment with Mary ;)",

You sit at the night club's outdoor tables (next door) when you dine.   3) You won't find a menu here, just a chalk board with at least 3 sandwich options (veggie, sweet, and savory)  4) Cash only.  5) No soda machine.   6) Not sure why this place is considered 'not kid friendly' walked up with my enormous stroller and felt no sense of awkwardness.  Now on to the food ...  I shared the $18 duck sandwich with my husband and for an $18 sandwich, I'd say they packed closer to $50 worth of foie gras on this baguette. The salty squishy slab of foie gras paired well with the dry chewy texture of the duck prosciutto. Then the tomato and lettuce cooled it all off and balanced out the sandwich quite well.",

The place is, no doubt, pricey (cash only). \u00a0But the sandwiches are good. \u00a0The folks who work there were very nice, and the man behind the counter remained pleasant despite the fact that someone stole their cash register the night before. \u00a0We opted to eat inside the restaurant which was small, and only had a few stools. \u00a0Many others opted to eat outside at Enrico's next door, which we would have done had we known we could, and if we were not being harassed by the man with issues. \u00a0I hope the next time I'm back to SF Naked Lunch is still around. \u00a0I'm already looking forward to trying out their other sandwich creations.",

Not huge on ordering fried anything but from time to time I'll nix my rule for something worthy, and believe me, THIS was worthy!  We walked into the bar and ordered our sandwiches. $9 for that is just awesome - especially when everything else in SF is so overpriced. We noticed it was full of old furniture, which was cool because it felt like old SF, a bunch of arcade games, and a couple TVs as well. Both of us immediately thought, let's come back for happy hour! Dive bars are lots of fun, and this one has plenty of seating inside and outside for those rare nice SF days.  We got our sandwiches, which were huge, delicious, and well-seasoned. The sweetness of the coleslaw helped to tame the saltiness of the chicken, and the bun wasn't too big or dense - just perfect.

Since then, we've stopped by on nearly a weekly basis to grab a sammy for lunch.   Although it's never on the menu, you can always request a vegan sandwich and they are always happy to oblige. These aren't some sad-sack consolation-prize vegan sandwiches, either- this is some seriously delicious, gourmet nosh. I still remember my very first Naked Lunch sandwich- thinly sliced apples, toasted almond slivers, arugula, and sauteed onions so soft and flavorful I almost brought the sandwich back because I thought it was butter! They even went the extra mile of stocking vegan mayo.   Don't even get me started on the drinks- the cinnamon sweet tea is ridiculously addictive, but the rare and elusive coconut lime cooler is really where it's at. On a recent hot day, someone came in with one and I FLIPPED. MY. SH*T. I whipped our whole office into a frenzy and ended up buying a whole quart of it.   Also, did I mention the people that run/work Naked Lunch are SUPER friendly and wonderful and nice? They are the coolest.  The only reason I give this four stars instead of five (or A MILLION) is because they serve foie gras sandwiches and everyone knows that foie gras makes baby kittens cry.",

Honorable mentions: seared tuna with a fried egg (or really anything with a \u00a0fried egg), short rib, pig &amp; fig. Portions are Just Enough. There's usually a meaty sandwich, a veggie one, and a soup. They make their own drinks as well, and they are always fresh and tasty.  I once ordered the foie gras sandwich. \"Foodwise\" I felt it was a little too advanced for me. \"Otherwise\" I felt a little dirty afterward. It was really decadent and it should maybe come with a cigarette. If you're the kind of hussy who eats foie gras at lunchtime, you should go and get this sandwich.

I sought out Naked Lunch solely because I wanted to try foie gras without having to dress up and spend $$$$, and the foie gras and duck prosciutto sandwich ($18) was an excellent way to complete my first foie gras adventure. The fatty richness really comes out due to the simplicity of the rest of the sandwich. The duck prosciutto was sharp and savory, although the flavor was slightly lost due to how strong the foie gras was. The sandwich was quite salty overall, but I really, really enjoy sodium. Not coincidentally, I also have high blood pressure. :(  The pork tenderloin with eggs ($12) was just okay. I liked each individual ingredient of the dish, but I didn't think they had any special magical synergy when combined. The pork was fairly dry and chewy and the whole meal felt strangely incomplete. Props for the fries staying crunchy after 20 minutes of soaking in the brown butter hollandaise, though. And a shoutout goes to the oven baked tomatoes for being some of the most flavorful, juicy tomatoes I've ever had; I'd even say it was more succulent than the bacon!  There's very little space to sit, so plan on takeout, and it's cash only. Pretty kid friendly - two small families showed up while I was there. The wait is about 5-10 minutes depending on what you order (my wait was 10 minutes due to the pork tenderloin with eggs; others' foie gras sandwiches came out quite speedily). The cashier was charming, and was nice enough not to call me a dope when I referred to the pork tenderloin as a sandwich even though the description never said sandwich. Oops.  Naked Lunch is a great lunch venue, especially if you want to get in on the foie gras craze before the July 1 ban rolls around. The extra bonus? There are several strip clubs close by, so hey, if you're too stuffed to go naked afterward, someone can go naked for you...",

    "review_text": "Remember that horrifying nightmare in high school?  The one where you're walking down the hallway naked while everyone gawks, leers, and/or stares in disgust (geez, am I really drooping like an 80 year-old grandma?!?!)? I never really understood that dream but just the name, \"Naked Lunch\" brought me back to those days. No, you don't go to lunch \"naked\" at Naked Lunch though sexual deviants (*ahem* like some people I know) may think that's the idea since San Francisco has NO law against public nudity. To each and their own for wanting to let it hang loose. Not my thing but I certainly would be ogling. OK, enough with the naked talk...  Naked Lunch has been on my bookmarks for their Signature Foie Gras &amp; Duck Prosciutto Sandwich. With the upcoming Foie Gras ban coming into effect in less than 6 weeks, this was not a bookmark I was going to let fall by the wayside. Naked Lunch is located next door to Txoko's (old Enrico's), their basque restaurant where you can sit at the outdoor patio to enjoy your lunch (my Txoko review: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/txoko-san-francisco#hrid:qvn2qoDUHjqJwkiPev5lsQ\">yelp.com/biz/txoko-san-f\u2026</a>).   I didn't even have to look at their daily changing menu with three sandwich, one soup, and one salad option; I came for one thing and one thing ONLY: The Foie Gras &amp; Duck Prosciutto Sandwich. Most of Naked Lunch's customers are from the FiDi and they tend to sell out of the foie sandwich early on the weekdays so you'll have better luck if you come on a Saturday (we came at 12:45 pm). CASH ONLY but there's an ATM inside Naked Lunch.  As a foie gras lover on PETA's hit list, the Foie Gras &amp; Duck Prosciutto Sandwich ($16) was an indulgent guilty pleasure. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K9aoButJPQD15rbA5HZMqw?select=slnyoAVD1E87R4B0G_I72Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/K9ao\u2026</a> Crusty soft Acme bread layered with silky smooth foie gras torchon, salty duck prosciutto, tangy tomato slices and crisp butter lettuce was the perfect melding of simplicity and luxury. The truffle salt was a bit over-the-top as it made the sandwich overwhelming salty. It thoroughly satisfied my foie gras craving but I'm not sure if it warrants a $16 price tag. Nonetheless, if you're a foie gras lover, it's something to definitely try before the ban.  You're already ordering the most decadent sandwich on the menu so to hell with watching your caloric and fat intake. Make sure to add a bag of 4505's FoodGASMIC Chicharonnes ($3) to your meal and wash it down everything with a refreshing glass of Cinnamon Sweet Tea (Free refills - $2).  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K9aoButJPQD15rbA5HZMqw?select=v_TVjjdEKMTB4rKsqogCyw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/K9ao\u2026</a>  Living in one of the most liberal cities in the country, *cheers* to Naked Lunch for serving foie gras and to \"naked\" lunches. But PLEASE, PLEASE don't go bare butt booty naked on public seats. Spank you very much.",

    "review_text": "I have never read Naked Lunch, but I have eaten there. I have no regrets. Neither, apparently, did William S. Burroughs, despite having his novel disparaged as obscene. But he was not deterred. He believed in the power of his voice and vision. That level of commitment is refreshing, even if his writing is not to everyone's tastes. You can't please everyone if you hope to make something lasting. Naked Lunch became a classic in spite of the detractors.  There is nothing obscene about Naked Lunch, the North Beach San Francisco sandwich spot, either. It, too, has the potential to become a classic, because I got the sense that the chef-owners are committed to their vision and don't try to be all things to all people. Just make lunch. A little something new every day. No megamenus. No exploding taste-bombs. But make it all good. Make it local. Make it seasonal. Make it linger. Make your customer smile. With subtle touches, not splashy displays of culinary cuteness. Have the courage to be understated. Let them find you. They will come!  The chalkboard menu of shifting sandwiches, soups, salads, and fresh juice drinks is casual elegant in its simplicity and gently inspired in its creative combinations of ingredients you can see, taste, and feel. It's wholesome and nutritious, not decadent and dripping with amped-up flavors. I am very drawn to this style of cooking and find it all too rare in the restaurantscape. Simple does not mean easy to make, to prepare, or to plate. It just means that you have pared things down to their essence.   Case in point: the lunch for two ($27, plus $5 tip) my sister and I enjoyed here one sunny spring afternoon. We slipped in shortly after noon, glanced at the chalkboard, asked a few questions about the menu, ordered, and grabbed an outdoor table. While we waited, we sipped a delicious honey tangerine cooler flavored with freshly-crushed juniper berries - orange bliss in a glass with a whiff of gin from the berries. \u00a0 \u00a0   The meal was a 3-course tasting menu in miniature: potato and green garlic soup, superbly seasonal with a pleasant mouthfeel and subtle, tangy creaminess. Many soups like this are all heavy cream and starch. This was like springtime in a cup.  Then a feather-light asparagus salad with manchego slivers, preserved Meyer lemon, mizuna greens, and filigree-thin fresh chives. It was seasoned with cracked pepper, a coarse salt, and olive oil. The lemon zests, pepper, and cheese were the high notes, the crisp asparagus pieces the steady beat. A toe-tapping musical improvisation of Californian cuisine in April.  Last was a ciopollini confit with melted manchego, balsamic, and spinach served on a small ciabatta roll sliced for two. The sweet and tangy onion marmalade pressed into the nooks and crannies of the bread and mixed with the cheese and vinegar-softened greens. A light breeze of a sandwich without dripping sauces or smoked proteins.  Next time, we'll try the Flash Freeze sorbet. Today's flavor was blood orange and fennel.   Some people want orgasmic food experiences. Me, not so much. (I don't need a meal for that). Naked Lunch is about another sort of nakedness - lacking embellishment, unadorned, nothing hidden, no disguises. It's what Burroughs called \"a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork.\"   The next time you go out for a midday meal, take a look at what's on the end of YOUR fork. If you don't like what you see, maybe you need a Naked Lunch. Because we all can use a few more frozen moments in our hectic hyperlives.",

It's a bit far from the financial district, but doable for lunch.   There are lots of seats indoor and outdoor. It feels like a good place to go with a group of people due to all the large tables.

Out of everywhere in world, it was this bar that found it's homey place on a street with a random museum and a montage of porn blasting with corny porn music. Hell let's give it a try!  The bar was cool. Probably a cool spot to shoot some pool and hang with some people. The bartender was nice and courteous. For lunchtime it was pretty quiet for being super awesome. But never the less, the food came quick. Got out of there for 14 bucks for the sandwich and fries.   I open the bag and I notice two items, a brown item wrapped. Thinking it was the fries but it was the sandwich. No prob. Still pretty large. Then right under is a big white box. Open the sucker and out explodes fries on fries!!!! And they are delicious!!! Got a little Cajun spice and crispy.  I open the main meal. Added a little hot sauce on that bad boy and into the mouth it goes. Filtering through endless amount coleslaw in my mouth I finally taste the ever so famous chicken. Pretty good! I would probably say that there was a little too much coleslaw. The chicken could have used a little more seasoning but I don't know if it was because of the coleslaw surrounding the chicken like the walls of Alcatraz or not.   Regardless, the meal was filling and did enjoy it. Now do I agree with my friend about best fried chicken sandwich....absolutely not. Apparently she has never been to chick fil a. Then again this is probably way healthier than fast food. \u00a0Overall pretty good.",

The name, however, won't tell you much about the super-fantastic Fulton Valley Fried Chicken Sandwich they serve on Tuesdays.   That sandwich features perfectly fried, juicy chicken breast (with the dark meat taste), served with coleslaw and garlic aioli on Pain De Mie. Nom Nom Nom.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=pypZb3V5TXHOnlTj-qLSrw&amp;select=8UVPbHJ1G_HjyPu2RI0WWg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>   I agree 100% with reviewer Phil H. in comparing Naked's quality to the famed fried chicken sandwich at Bakesale Betty's. \u00a0Simply put, it doesn't. \u00a0As much as I like BB, Naked's fried chicken sandwich is just in a different league...in the same way Tara Reid and Aubrey Hepburn are both actresses, but safe to say that Tara would not have taken any roles from Aubrey. \u00a0Plus, Naked serves the fried chicken patty while still warm and fresh. And as Christine C. puts it, definitely top-five sandwich of the year worthy (now I have to rerank my list).   I also had the Salty Dulce Ice Cream, though I didn't enjoy it as much. I first thought $3 for such a small offering was a little high. But the flavor was so rich, it was actually plenty. \u00a0It was good, but way too sweet and not salty enough. Perhaps the sweetened condensed milk overpowered the french sea salt, so it tasted more like frozen condensed milk. \u00a0  Service was down to earth, accommodating, efficient, and very friendly. Prices are higher, but fair for what you get. Also on a sour note, they are open for only 3 or so hours a day and they are a cash only establishment (with an ATM that charges $2.50 per transaction).   And, oh, one more thing, they serve the always awesome 4505 Chicharrones. \u00a0I'll be back. \u00a0Count on it.",

It's a pretty big, comfortable space that's not trying too hard and is rarely suffocatingly packed like most good places in the city. It doesn't give off hipster vibes, it doesn't attract a Marina crowd even though it has two pool tables and a basketball game, and it's not filled with suits from the Financial District. It's an eclectic, diverse group of customers and I always end up having a good conversation with someone interesting.  The rotating beers on taps are solid and the sandwiches, especially the fried chicken sandwich and the cheeseburger, are delicious.   Most of all, it doesn't cost too much (as far as prices in SF go).

Their sandwiches are so good in every aspect, from taste to texture. The menu changes day to day, but \u00a0stays interesting. One of my favorites was a fried fish sandwich with very thin slices of apples and fennel. It was amazingly light but flavorful, and the fish remained tender and airily crisp. I only wish I was able to try the fois gras sandwich before I moved to an office no longer within walking distance.   Definitely try one of their iced drinks- sooo refreshing, hand made with unexpected herbs, spices and fruits; for those who eat in, the guys offer free refills!",

Since I was looking for a salad, I chose the Grilled County Line Farms Chicories Salad, after I made sure it was vegetarian. The interesting description: St. Agur Blue Cheese, Citrus, Arugula, Sherry Vinegar, in addition to the emphasis on the farm's name, caught my attention. The nice bartender took my order, I paid and received a number which I brought to my table. I sat outside on a comfy couch; there is also seating indoors. There was a group of ladies and a couple of families with small kids.  Quickly I received a beautiful, good sized salad. The sweetness of the blue cheese is a good counterpart to the almost earthy taste of the chicories. They reminded me of bok choy or endive. The citrus pieces balanced the arugula and cheese. There maybe was shaved fennel also. I loved the green garlic sauce on the side. All together the dish is a great combination of flavors and fresh produce. County Line Farms has a CSA and is at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market, so check them out. Great produce for a delicious salad!",

One of the BETTER chicken sandwiches I've had. \u00a0\"Better\" because I prefer Bakesale Betty's :) \u00a0The first thing I said after taking a bite, I compared it to BB's... \u00a0Then I saw the Yelp reviews and noticed I'm not the only one who compares the two places.   I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and the cinnamon sweet tea (recommendation from my friend). \u00a0  The fried chicken sandwich was savory (salty), juicy, but too oily. \u00a0The mayo just made it much worse. \u00a0There was so much oil from the chicken, and the mayo just tasted like grease from the heat. \u00a0As flavorful and juicy as the chicken was, I felt a bit grossed out after eating it.   BUT, I think the cinnamon sweet tea really balanced it out. \u00a0I don't know why it would taste tangy but it does. \u00a0It's sweet but tangy and hence very refreshing and energizing because it boosts up your sugar level. \u00a0The best of all? \u00a0You can get the left over drink to go and they give you a to-go cup and actually fill up the whole cup for you. \u00a0That makes two drinks.. or more if you go through more than 1 during lunch.   I guess my experience at this place was actually not that bad, but I'm being a bit harsh and difficult because I keep comparing to Bakesale Betty's.",

He had heard good things about this place so we figured it was worth a try.  The ambiance is dimly lit with ample seating inside as well as a small outdoor area. They have a couple pool tables + a basketball arcade game. Overall, I feel like this would be a great place to come and hang out especially for their happy hour specials.  For lunch, I decided to try their Fried Chicken Sandwich + an order of fries. The portion of chicken was good and felt it was cooked well. I would say my biggest gripe about the dish would have to be the buttermilk slaw. It was too wet and ended up making the bread too soggy. I did like that it lent a nice bite of acidity to the dish but overall could not get over the texture of the bread.   The fries were cooked well, crispy on the outside and fluffy light on the inside.   Overall Thoughts  I could see myself coming back for lunch/happy hour with higher hopes",

Fried chicken is always good, though I recommend eating as soon as possible--don't bring this back to your desk and wait 30 minutes. It will be soggy! Cinnamon sweet tea is a nice change from other flavored iced teas. All the sandwiches I've tried have been flavorful and fresh, without going overboard on ingredients. I find them to be perfectly sized, though some of my male friends say they are on the small size. Go when they open at 11:30, as the line gets long and they can run out of items early.",

This place really is a hole in the wall, seriously. I swear I would have missed it if it wasn't for the line out the door.

It really allows them to do two things well but in entirely different service systems.  We arrived at Naked Lunch and found it to be a tiny storefront that is a part of the main kitchen at Enrico's. Very compact with a bit of indoor seating and some adjacent outdoor (but heated and covered) seating that is also a part of Enrico's. We were warmly welcomed and enjoyed the buzz of the culinary staff prepping for dinner, as well as making lunch.  The menu is a small blackboard with perhaps ten selections featuring local/seasonal ingredients. We tried sunchoke soup, a fried chicken sandwich, radish/grapefruit/manchego salad, and meyer lemonade+clove. All are served in disposable wares (recyclable, compostable mainly). The flavors were excellent and of fine dining quality. It represents quite a value.  I would have rated it 5 stars, except for the use of disposables, which makes the experience less appealing.

Despite being located next to the North Beach strip clubs...this place has a great bar vibe and a very nice interior that's perfect for a Friday happy hour. The pop-a-shot basketball game is a nice touch too, although I doubt I'd ever play unless I was either A) very drunk or B) very bored, neither of which I hope I'll ever be at happy hour, especially when I'm with work friends.   Food looked pretty good as well. That being said, the reviews that said this place has \"the best chicken sandwiches they've ever had\" need to be..well...taken with a grain of salt, because my friend said hers was decent, but nothing life-changing. Honestly, the gap between those two sentiments is so large, if I come back I'm definitely planning on ordering one myself, just to see what the deal is. (Fries were good though!!)  Can't say the staff was that friendly though. When our food came I tried to go out of my way to show my gratitude (my friends had been complaining about being hungry for hours in typical girl fashion), yet she barely acknowledged what I had said, which I found odd. Regardless I wasn't bothered much by it, as she easily could've just been having a bad day.  Sidenote: This is one of those times Yelp needs a 3.5 star option. This place isn't a 4 star place, as that assessment would seem to be an insult to the many great restaurants I've reviewed that are fully deserving of 4 stars (and maybe more). But at the same time, 3 stars seems a bit harsh, since this is a place I'd gladly come to again.   Anyway it's too bad it's so far away from the heart of the financial district, or else I'd definitely come here again for happy hour - perhaps even every week. But at bare minimum, if I ever find myself in North Beach again and in need of a place to drink, a return trip is likely.",

The fried chicken sandwich is a must especially with the Crystal hot sauce they provide. But this isn't anything new if you've read the other Yelp reviews. Now, I'm a meat lover but one day they were out of protein sandwiches so I exhausted my options and went with the asparagus sandwich. I was a little hesitant about eating a veggie sandwich but after my first bite I was in awe. Never before has anyone actually created a vegetable dish I instantly liked. Also had the pleasure to try the soup of the day which was an amazing mushroom truffle soup.   Naked Lunch is great for any day for whatever on the menu. You will not be disappointed.",

Point in case -- my friend ask him to help nuke a coffee she had from earlier in the day, unfortunately, they didn't have a microwave. \u00a0But instead of rejecting her, they reheated it in a pot on the stove and pour it back into her to-go cup, brought it out with her order, and threw in a smile.  We ordered: --Chicken Sandwich ($9)-- great chicken in a soft bun. \u00a0Their staple item, with good reason. --Salmon &amp; Poached Egg ($12) -- a hearty piece of salmon under a runny poached egg. \u00a0Surrounded by a moat of spicy tomato and cucumber. Tasty.  BUT -- a nice sit down experience, Nake Lunch is not. \u00a0Inside basically looks like a a burned down kitchen. \u00a0You can sit outside the next door (sister) restaurant, TXOKO, but there you'll be taking in the glorious view of strip clubs and video stores. \u00a0Like I said, great for take out!",

There were about 6 people in front (and eventually behind) us, but they were pretty efficient and we moved through with our order in less than 10 minutes.   I had the Fried Chicken Sandwich (which most people here are mentioning about) with some Cinnamon tea. Now, cinnamon tea wasn't something I would have attempted to ever try because I don't really fancy the idea of drinking herbs or spices. But since my coworker recommended it, I thought I'd give it a go. Thanks to my coworker, I actually really really enjoyed the tea!  Now for the chicken sandwich. A lot of people here are comparing it to Bakesale Betty's, but I actually think the sandwiches of both are quite different. Bakesale piles on a whole lot of their jalapeno cilantro slaw while Naked could have used more slaw and/or aioli. Bakesale's sandwich is noticeably larger and taller while Naked's chicken had a bit more flavor to it. Naked uses a delicious Pain de Mie bun while Bakesale uses a more chewy roll.  Both have good and not as good qualities. I enjoy both! One should try and make ones own choice.",

The menu that day had three sandwiches: duck prosciutto with foie gras, poached shrimp mousse cakes with avocado, and grilled eggplant with peppers and aioli. There were also two soups, a couple of designer drinks and some rarefied sorbet and ice cream for dessert.  Sharing bites amongst us, we managed to sample every sandwich. The general consensus was that everything was just a bit too rich and/or unbalanced. Certain ingredients overpowered others (foie gras, the salt in the salty plum drink was too strong) and there were also some texture issues. My shrimp mousse cakes were super squishy, sliding all over and out of the sides of the roll. (Which I would have preferred toasted).  The eggplant &amp; peppers was the best sandwich we tried. The heirloom tomato gazpacho was also a hit, refreshing and flavorful. Service was friendly, although slow, during a time when it wasn't busy.  I dunnno. It's pretty pricey. None of us felt wowed. If I'm getting naked for lunch, I want some wow. Three stars.",

The signature menu item is the Fried Chicken Sandwich, which you definitely need to experience once in your life. My co-worker literally comes here every week just for this masterpiece and has tried to order two in one sitting. Yes, it is that great. I decided to change things up and got the vegetarian sandwich, which was tastier than expected and had a good mesh of textures compared to a lot of other vegetarian sandwiches. All sandwiches are about $11 here.  I believe the menu rotates throughout the week, so you can always come back for nice pescetarian and vegetarian surprises.

The roll was fresh and soft with a crunchy crust. The bacon was prepared perfectly and was topped with just the right amount of lettuce and other things which blended together perfectly. For me, this sandwich was the perfect portion for lunch though I could have eaten a few more.   I also ordered the Salty Dulce de Leche ice cream which was recommended as their signature flavor. It was a rare warm day in SF and this was a perfect compliment. It's major ingredients were condensed milk and sea salt. It was creamy and tasted a bit like carmel. Somebody I know who swears by the bi-rite salty carmel told me that this was better in her opinion -- WHOH  The space is extremely minimalist and you will feel like you are ordering right in a kitchen. Patio seating is available at Enricos next door who I am guessing has a space sharing deal. The patio at Enricos is nice with comfy seats though there were a lot of gnats.   This is on the upper cost scale for lunch and the wait is a bit long so keep that in mind before deciding to come. I do think this is completely worth both the wait and cost.",

Coming on a Thursday, I already knew I was going to miss out on their Fried Chicken Sandwich (Tuesdays only). \u00a0But to deprive me of my Foie and Duck Prosciutto sandwich consolation prize/meal as well? \u00a0That's just mean! \u00a0Especially after I saw it listed on their daily menu the night before too. \u00a0Seriously, what are the odds that on the one random day I take off from work, they'd be shorthanded and unable to prep the foie for cooking? \u00a0Ugh...poop.  Thank goodness for their Pig and Fig sandwich though! \u00a0Filled with pork tenderloin, fig, bacon, and arugula, I had already felt tempted to order it before I found out about their foie sandwich. \u00a0So despite my order having been decided for me, at least I didn't have to worry about second guessing what I got. \u00a0When my sandwich was brought out, it looked delicious. \u00a0The tenderloin was seasoned and moist, and I really liked how the sweetness of the fig complemented the pork. \u00a0The basalmic vinegar and the arugula gave it a nice finish as well. \u00a0Oddly enough, I thought the bacon was the weakest part, as the taste didn't really come through for me. \u00a0Weird since bacon usually adds so much flavor, but I guess it just shows good the rest of it was.  In a way, the Pig and Fig reminded me of the pork porchetta sandwich at Roli Roti, except not as salty and sweeter because of the fig. \u00a0Not really sure which is better/worse, but I guess it depends more on your taste buds and the cut you get. \u00a0While this one was balanced with mostly meat and a little fat, the Roli Roti one can range from being dry or fatty depending on the mound in the sandwich. \u00a0Both are obviously good though, and this one was a nice consolation prize for the original consolation prize that went missing. \u00a0But for now, only four stars. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Well, I'll make you a deal Naked Lunch - give me a tasty foie or fried chicken sandwich, and I'll give you your fifth star!",

To avoid the crazy weekend rush, I made sure to come out extra early today to ensure I got my hands on this delicious sandwich. There are severely limited quantities of this sandwich and if you don't go early enough this place will run out. Today there were only 19 Foie Gras sandwiches available and I came as early as 10:30AM to line up for their opening at 11:30AM.  Now outside of the crazy wait, let's talk about the Artisan Foie Gras Torchon &amp; Duck Prosciutto Sandwich itself. The Foie Gras is very rich, but is also a little sweet. It has a nice smooth/buttery texture that goes well with the tomatoes, butter lettuce, and black truffle salt. The sandwich isn't really big, but after eating half of it, I had to take a small break because it was so rich. Overall, I really enjoyed the texture and flavor of the sandwich, but the I wished the french baguette it was served on tasted better. The bread was pretty hard to chew and tore up the roof of my mouth. If the bread was slightly warm and crispy, the sandwich would have been perfect.  The price of Foie Gras has also skyrocketed within the last week in preparation for the ban. I remember when my friends first told me about this sandwich when it was $16. The price today was a whopping $25!  If you love Foie Gras, tomorrow is your last chance to get it in California. Come early to Naked Lunch and expect to wait! It's well worth it.  CASH ONLY. You don't want to wait in the long line and find out you can't pay with credit card. Don't make this mistake. You will be very sad.  == A MUST TRY! ==",

I got a cheeseburger, my date got a chicken sandwich, and we split an order of fries. We ate our lunch outside since the weather was nice. The burger was commendable, but not quite exceptional. I had a bit of the chicken sandwich, which was pretty good. The fries were well seasoned and tasted great with and without the dip.",

Today I had the chorizo and egg sandwich with garlic confit, pequillo peppers, pickled onions, basil and arugula. This cost $9 which is still a pricier lunch option for me. I usually try to keep it around $7 or bring my own food but I wanted to try something new and I'm glad I did. It was so good. The ingredients were really fresh. The egg was cooked over medium and stayed that way even as I was walking the 3 or 4 bocks back to the office.

I usually get the specialty salad when it's available, or the vegetarian sandwich (based on what's in season). On Sunday nights, they have an amazing Asian-fusion popup called Chao Mien.

    "review_text": "Ever since people bet the farm, and lost it, on Las Vegas real estate, aspirational cuisine has got it stuck in its head that we all want to eat out of food trucks, on sidewalks in front of abandoned buildings, and to eat overly fancy burgers (e.g., Hubert Keller's Burger Bar), pizza (Delfina Pizzeria), and sandwiches (Tom Colicchio's 'wichcraft) for a premium price. The object is to make us believe we are not spending much money for fine dining, in a no-frills airline sort of way, while still charging us far more than the typical fare of a roach coach or corner dive than we're used to.  What we diners get is faux austerity. We essentially pay a premium to get better-than-average food in exchange for a run-down setting and the false veneer of not blowing our budget on amenities, like a toilet or plastic forks. In the end, what we really get is a tricked out Honda Civic for the same price we could have bought a BMW.  Naked Lunch plays this post-economic-crash mind game to a \"T\". The sandwiches are inventive, somewhat creative, and tastier than your typical sandwich. They'll even offer an interesting soup and/or salad for $6-$7.  But no matter what bread you use and what you put on it, sandwiches are lazy and boring. While the food is of good quality overall (this is no traditional chain fast food joint), it exemplifies this lazy, pedestrian formula towards aspirational cuisine at the semi-affordable end: grade school cafeteria menus with big pants ingredients - and prices.  Come on, chefs! So you want us to eat out more thinking we're spending less. I don't care if you're a five-star chef: it's still a burger. You just managed to charge me double what I would normally pay for it. Can't you honestly be more creative and thoughtful than pushing downmarket sandwiches, burgers, and pizza with upscale ambitions?  I understand these are not high times to be spending money on lavish lunches. And the slight of hand here partially works. But the suspension of disbelief only goes so far before you realize you just paid $16 for a pretty good sandwich at a place that has neither a toilet nor silverware and makes you sit in front of the abandoned Enrico's next door. Even their $6 soup comes in a disposable coffee cup.  Three stars -- as no one can rationally compare the quality of a no-frills sandwich pusher with food truck envy to the care, quality, and preparation that goes into something like a five-star French Laundry (what? are you guys on drugs? at least pretend like you get out to eat once in a while to make a rational quality comparison). No sandwich shop could, nor should, ever receive more than four stars. That and we have honestly had a rare but slightly better sandwich elsewhere.  I'd go back if I was in the mood for a sandwich, but I rarely am. And how much effort does it really take to make an excellent sandwich yourself at home?",

I still stay true to my true love of fried chicken sandwiches, Bakesale Betty's in Oakland. Here's what we ordered at Naked Lunch:  Fried Chicken Sandwich (3 stars): The bff and I both ordered this. For $8, I think you get a fairly decent portion. The chicken was crispy, very moist and tender since it was dark meat. But the sandwich as a whole was just ok. I wasn't a huge fan of the creamy, sweet mayo-ish sauce they had in the sandwich, and I would've liked more veggies as well. I think the sandwich needed more zest, and I had to add hot sauce on every bite.  Foie Gras &amp; Duck Prosciutto Sandwich (2.5 stars): The bf ordered this. Maybe we didn't know what we were getting into... but woweeee, this sandwich was wayyyy too rich. There's definitely $16 worth of foie gras in there, but I think it's just too overwhelming to have all that in one sandwich. I'd only recommend to order this if you know you LOVE foie gras.  Cinnamon Iced Tea (3 stars): Not bad, I just thought it was a little too sweet for my taste. Cinnamon with iced tea is a really interesting combination though.  I may come back in the future to try other sandwiches, but for now I'll just stick with 3-stars. Here are some last tips: parking is a BEEZY, menus are posted online, and it's CASH ONLY.",

Artisan Foie Gras Torchon &amp; Duck Prosciutto Sandwich with Heirloom Tomato, Butter Lettuce and Black Truffle Salt. Just the name alone had me salivating. Creamy, velvety foie gras torchon with slices of aromatic duck prosciutto create one luxe sandwich.  The Fulton Valley Farms Fried Chicken Sandwich with Creamy Coleslaw and Garlic Aioli on Pain De Mie is one of the top 5 best sandwiches I have had this year. Juicy, tender pieces of fried chicken with a lightly breaded crispy skin are topped with a creamy cole slaw. Don't forget to utilize the bottle of Louisiana Crystal Hot Sauce at the table to its full extent. The bread soaks up all the mayonnaise, fried chicken juices, and hot sauce.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K9aoButJPQD15rbA5HZMqw?selected=X9g6hryRt19db-E-Y2NwiA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/K9ao\u2026</a>  Total fried chicken heaven.",

    "review_text": "Sandwiches seem *too* simple but like an excerpt from any of Hemingway's work, that simplicity is oh-so-deceiving. When you dive in, you delight in the complexity contained within. It's all about reading between the slices of (scrumptious) bread, so to speak.   I eyed the chalkboard menu with suspicion when I entered Naked Lunch. It changes daily and today's displayed four choices, one of which was vegetarian. Ho hum, I'm thinking. The description of the vegwich was not exciting. Why oh why do I continue to be all about the bells and whistles? I need to trust in good sandwich shops (I should just think of Kansas City's famous Happy Gillis and be reminded of how good they can be. To be fair, HG warrants the full five stars for its darling decor with seating and the side of fruit that garnishes the sandwiches. Plus they have a dozen more options. Just sayin'). I was also kind of put off by the hipster foie gras t-shirts the staff wore, but since they (the staff, not the shirts) were so awesome, I got over that mighty quick. Like the \"I live for bacon\" trend, I find the foie gras celebration to be so fucking tired. Just call me a jaded vegetarian. It's too boring to even be offended by it. Besides, *no one* can top Anthony Bourdain shouting \"I'll force feed you and dine on your liver\" (poorly paraphrased) to a goose.   So, I grudgingly ordered the veg sandwich which came with summer squash, red peppers (usually a flag for me), onions (an even redder flag), chevre and avocado. To drink? The cinnamon/lemon iced tea. They need to be more effusive when describing this exquisite concoction. I normally stick to water, but the mention of cinnamon that got me. This was easily the BEST iced tea I've ever had in my life. I say this without hesitation.   There is no seating inside this tiny storefront obviously, but you get to sit in a lovely sidewalk cafe next door where they bring you your order. Loved this shaded area. Idyllic, really.  The sandwich came with little fanfare, wrapped in wax paper (love that). I unwrapped it and knew i was in for it. DIEVINE!!! I do not exaggerate! I appreciated that the veggies were stacked high, the peppers and onion were used sparingly, as they should be: a *condiment* (at least in my world). The chevre, absolutely perfect.   I feel compelled to go on again about that iced tea. I hate sweet tea (makes me nauseous), but this was sweet/spicy/lemony and oh dear god, I might find myself hiking up here again this week just to grab an iced tea. It's that bad. I mean, I have it *that bad* for the iced tea.",

Sadly, it wasn't Tuesday so I couldn't try their fried chicken sandwich, but the pork tenderloin/bacon/cabbage/arugala on Acme was a delicious choice. Great flavors. From the times I've checked out Naked Lunch's website, it seems like they have a knack for identifying tasty combinations.   I sat at the counter, where there's about five seats, but they also have a heated patio next door with a fair amount of seating.   At $11, I do think the sandwich is overpriced. The ingredients are high quality, obviously, but still, over $10 for a not so huge sandwich at a takeout place is steep.",

Today we tried the foie gras torchon and proscuitto sandwich. It was pretty good, but a bit salty. It also cost $18 so we were a bit disappointed that it only came with some lettuce and tomatoes.  We got there a little past noon and scored the last 2 foie gras sandwiches. This worked out well because we were able to split one other kind. We decided on the fried chicken sandwich and were pleasantly surprised. The chicken was crispy and flavorful and came with coleslaw and garlic aioli. For $8, it seemed like quite the deal compared to the foie gras sandwich.  The owners of Naked Lunch also own Txoko's, which is right next door. If you're a fellow foie gras lover, you'll be happy to know that they are hosting foie gras dinners on Wednesdays. Make a reservation before it's too late!",

I ordered the foie gras and duck prosciutto sandwich, asparagus salad and the dulce de leche ice cream. I loved the bread. I believe they use Acme. The asparagus was crunchy and fresh and blended well with the manchego and preserved meyer lemon. The ice cream was salty and sweet indeed, just like I like it. I went all out! The price was steep...a little over $25. Whatever. The guys working the place were awesome. Very nice people. Everything was yummy, though I don't know if I'll splurge on a sandwich like that anytime soon.

    "review_text": "The Naked Lunch is now responsible for 5 of my favorite lunch food items, Ive just realized.  1. The bacon, chorizo, etc 2. Today's marinated skirt steak 3. The pig and peach 4. The best lemonade I have ever tasted 5. The best pork skins Ive ever tasted. (I know they dont make them, but they introduced me to them)  My friend and I walked up to NL today and waited for maybe 5 minutes before our food showed up. Incidentally, the waiter at NL is also a DJ who plays around town and played for us at a Chinatown bar called Li Po last night, so that was interesting.  I sat down and started in on my marinated, grilled skirt steak sandwich but before I took a bite, my buddy gave me a sip of his lemonade. The yellow liquid gushed and squirted in great rivulets, running down my cheeks and face, all over my chest and lap into a golden pool at my feet. Fellow patrons at the outdoor seating area at NL today were treated to a surprise they werent expecting, I think its fair to say. Next, I took a crap in a bag and.... wait....  So as I was saying, the opposition to prop19 really succeeded in presenting fear and misinformation to the masses. I find 'masses' to be a really cool word, especially when used to describe unusual growths found inside the body!  Oh Im so sorry! Juggling food reviews, office work, erotic story writing, and political tomfoolery can be a challenge. You really have to be careful with that windows clipboard. Seriously.  So the skirt steak. It was marinated in something I cannot identify, but can take a guess at. It was slightly salty and quite savory, a little sweet but not overly so. I detected garlic, but no citrus or anything acidic. The marinade was very mellow and the meat also had a nice smokey taste from the grill. The texture and consistency of this skirt steak was perfectly suited for a sandwich and all my usual complaints about the chore of eating steak inside bread were not heard. This meat was so succulent and tender that I never found myself wanting to rip it from between the bread with my bare hands, as with many other steak sandwiches Ive had. The bread was super fresh, as always, the garlic aioli was on time and evenly distributed, and everything came together excellently. This sandwich is easily my #2 all time fav sandwich and was perfectly sized for my appetite.  About that lemonade. My buddy really *did* let me sample his lemonade which caused me to run back to the counter and order one of my own. This lemonade was hands-down the best Ive had. It was freshly squeezed juice, water, a reasonable amount of sugar, and the very light essences of ginger and anise. These flavors were balanced so well that one would think a team of scientists had slaved over the periodic table for years to arrive at the conclusion that led to the discovery of this lemonade. The anise and ginger were flavors that did not affect the actual taste of the lemonade much, but interacted almost exclusively with the acidity of the lemon juice. These 2 essences smoothed almost all acid in the taste, yet left all the strength of the lemon. The anise is very slightly detected by the palate if you swish the stuff around and look for it. Superb lemonade.  The Naked Lunch is totally awesome and their great staff well deserving of the 2 tips I left them during this visit.  I expected the food to be great so I left 2 bucks in the can.  After eating our meal, both my buddy and I walked right back up to the counter and placed additional dollars in the can to show our appreciation.",

I'll save my fried chicken sandwich craving for bake sale betty's or 3-sum eats.   The butternut squash sando on the other hand was amazing! Thinly sliced roasted sweet butternut with a layer of goat cheese, crumbled walnuts and pea spouts on a nice ciabatta (or some equally lovely bun).   Go for the daily specials and skip the chicken.",

The perfect combination of fresh, seasoned, crispy, moist chicken and cool coleslaw on amazing bread left me breathless.  Despite it being bikini season, I wanted another. I thought about it for a solid 10 minutes and said, \"NO, DON'T DO IT.\" I then regretfully walked away. As I walked away, I turned my head back and saw Naked Lunch fading into the distance, like a scene from a love story.  Since that day, I've been thinking about them non-stop. I can't wait until I have another opportunity to go to back on a Tuesday. I LIVE FOR IT.",

Anyway, after working tirelessly for months on end without a consistent schedule in sight, my first back to back days off has arrived. I earned it so I figured a stroll in the city would do me justice.  Switched on the Yelp app, walked through FiDi and lost my bearings a few times thanks to Apple maps calibration issues and lacking common sense of true north. I finally stumbled into the establishment after finding out it's close to the North Beach/Chinatown triangle.  I was enticed with the words 'foie-gras sandwich' only to be disappointed that majority of what was mentioned was available pre-foie gras ban (and in 2012 mind you).  So, I sat at the bar and was helped by the bartender Stephanie?? (I think, she might punch me in the face if she reads this review since I forgot).  She took the following order:  Evan Williams and Coke w/ Mary's Farm Fried Chicken (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fp%2FmBP0FxHh2l%2F&amp;s=e0d77c1f405c8702658b0a595d0ac46891a9fd69808e1346fd299e4bc43d23a4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">instagram.com/p/mBP0FxHh\u2026</a>)  Let's start with the Evan William's x Coke. I'm more of a jack and coke person and EW seems to be a bit more on the sweeter side than I'm accustomed to otherwise it served its purpose for lunchtime alcoholism.  The Farm fried chicken, the bread was nicely toasted, the coleslaw lacked some flavor and the aioli made things really sloppy. Chicken was a bit rare in the interior as a chowed down through the meal. So what made the whole sandwich hold up? Crystal's hot sauce. It gave the simplistic sandwich a bit of complexity and lifted the blandness of the aioli and slaw.   Customer service was excellent and it was nice to get a break from the grindstone of life by chatting it up and eating a casual lunch in the city. After $20.00 plus tax and some added tip I was ready to call it a day. They also have an indie pop-up on sundays called Chao-Mien which i have yet to try and apparently their dinner sandwiches are more amazing so until I try those elements of this location, this is my preliminary rating for now.

Needed major protein! (Well I shared 1 sandwich.)  I liked everything about the chicken sandwich. Chicken was tender and flavorful. The garlic aioli was the star of the sandwich and with the hot sauce, it was like soul food!   Although seating is limited inside, there is plenty of room in Enrico's sidewalk area. Great for small groups.   My only suggestion to the owners is to have fries or sweet potato fries.",

The fried chicken sandwich is a thing of simple beauty (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K9aoButJPQD15rbA5HZMqw?select=fRK4AX6rrrnBzGebxKnVBw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/K9ao\u2026</a>) - a generous piece of boneless dark meat fried to a gorgeous golden brown, slathered with a rich and creamy garlic aioli, coleslaw, and encased by a soft acme bun.   The proof of greatness however is in the taste and my first bite was a sneak taste of the chicken on its own and wow it's a nice tasting piece of chicken. The second bite revealed the true brilliance of the symphony of ingredients working together effortlessly. Have no doubt that the chicken is still the star, but all the other elements work to make it shine even more.   I've found my favorite fried chicken sandwich in the city and when you add a bag of 4505 chicharrones that melt in your mouth, you've found yourself a great lunch escape. Bring cash to Naked Lunch on Tuesday - it's the perfect early-in-the-workweek savory treat.",

This bread alone I could write novels about, but the credit goes solely to acme. I was a little disappointed with my choices, I would normally never order the same sandwich as the person I'm with, but since my other selections were peach/goat cheese and salmon/capers I made an exception. Boy, am I glad I made the exception because this was one tasty, fragrant sammie. The scent of black truffle wafts towards you when you unwrap the paper, there is this irresistible crunch that occurs when you bite down into the crust of the bread, then there's this gorgeous melting sensation of rich, fatty flavor from the foie gras that contrasts the chewier and saltier prosciutto, finished with a perfectly ripe tomato that adds just a little acidic sweetness.   And a glass of the fabulous sweet cinnamon iced tea. I'm totally going to start adding cinnamon to my own iced tea. I liked it specifically because it was sweet without being overly sweet like most southern sweet teas. Altho I hafta say I did swirl my drink for the first 10 minutes waiting for the ice to melt a little. But there's the beauty of iced tea, make it a little sweeter let the ice do its job.   My only complaints, showed up at 11:25p they made us wait for 15 minutes before opening and I thought the sammie was a little small for $18. But they use high quality ingredients, so it's prolly not fair for me to complain. Would have loved to try the mushroom soup, but thought $30+ was rather pricey for a lunch.",

Surprisingly none of the outside seating was set up, 10 mins before opening time, and the guy working there kind of made me feel like I was in his way no matter where I stood so my friend and I walked somewhere else to get coffee first. When we got back and were standing outside of the restaurant waiting for it to open, the same lady who just fake punched me asked me for money.

You have to order the food from the bar and I got a fig sandwich and paid extra for fries. The sandwich was good and the fries were ok. Even though only two other people were eating at the restaurant the waitress kept asking me and my friend if we were done so she could take the plates away. Calm down lady! You can take our plates when we leave!

Because I wanted to eat that danky goodness that's known as the Fried Chicken Sandwich. Although their yelp page says they only serve it on Tuesday, after a few weeks of stalking their menu, I've noticed that on Wednesdays they also serve the Fried Chicken Sandwich.   I was planning on getting there right when they opened for I feared that they would run out of Chicken Sandwiches, but as I was driving to North Beach, I RAN OUT OF GAS. I was furious with myself; I swear, I was about to have a tantrum. After AAA came, I looked at the clock and it was already noon. My spirits were dampened, but I chanced it and drove there anyways.   Surprise! Even at around 12:15 pm, they hadn't run out of the Fried Chicken Sandwich, so fuck yeah! And there was no line. Sweet!  I split a Foie Gras Sandwich and a Fried Chicken Sandwich with a friend, and we both ordered the cocunut and blood orange juice.   The Foie Gras Sandwich was good, but I was glad I only ate half because it is pretty rich. Although I love fatty duck liver, I could not handle all the decadence that was oozing out of my sandwich. They don't skimp on it either. Every bite is filled with luxurious cream.  As for the Fried Chicken Sandwich, after I finished my half, I promptly ordered another one. It was bombay! Thick, tender thigh meat, covered in your basic salt and pepper batter, topped off with a sweet slaw, and sandwiched between a glossy bun. I mean, this sandwich doesn't have any funky twists or fusion elements, but man, it is done proper!  Also, they have a sweet heated patio that overlooks Broadway in case you'd like to people watch.  I'm definitely planning a return trip. Glad I tried the foie gras sandwich, but Naked Lunch, I'm coming for your chickens!",

I was DYING to have it.  Maybe its the hype..or maybe its just me.. But the Foie Gras wasn't THAT great. \u00a0It was good no doubt... but perhaps it was the combo of the thick slice of foie gras and the salty duck prosciutto, that was just toooo intense in richness for me. \u00a0I think sharing half of this sucker would have been sufficient...  Linda L. kept mentioning something or another about BEST Fried Chicken...so I came back....  NOTE: I don't like chicken, I don't like fried chicken, (heck I don't even like dark meat), I don't like coleslaw, and I don't like mayo.......with that said.....  I F$%KING LOVE THEIR FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH!!!  Every bite was never enough, after I splashed on the hotsauce, I was hurrying for the next bite. \u00a0It was gross how FAST I devoured the poor little thing.. it never stood a chance...  This sando is definitely NOT for the faint at heart.. no seriously if you have a heart condition, its probably safe to say that your doctor will tell you to steer away from the BEST Fried Chicken sandwich west of Louisiana....  But thats what makes this sandwich soo GOOD, the soft toasty bread, the creaminess of the mayo, the crispiness of the chicken, with a lil texture of the coleslaw....  Money CAN buy happiness.... and it costs $8 @ Naked Lunch =)",

A few minutes later the 12 delivered me a block from my destination and what would be an outstanding sandwich. Roasted butternut squash, lettuce and fennel on warm bread. Every bite was outstanding, and the service was friendly and accommodating. Dug the space too. I can see why there is much yelp love.

    "review_text": "Naked Lunch makes tasty, slightly unusual sandwiches. They present a small, but varied menu that seems to always consist of a chicken sandwich, a burger, a veggie sandwich, a salad, a soup, fries, and some random sides. Sandwiches (fries not included at $5) usually cost around $10, soups $8. The atmosphere is warm and spacious, with a great, breezy outdoor area in the front. Staff are pleasant, the wait time is decently fast, and they have some nice beers on tap.  Here are some things I have tried:  Chicken coleslaw sandwich (signature item): The chicken was moist, juicy and fried to perfection. I don't like the taste of coleslaw very much, so I've only had this once, but it does go well with the chicken. \u00a0  The burger: Also great -- I really dig the cheese crisp thing they put on it (manchego?)  The vegetarian sandwich: Favorite one! Seems to always be goat cheese, arugula, some caramelized vegetable, and maybe fruit. I think this is the tastiest of all the options, although I have to psych myself up before ordering something vegetarian. Would maybe be healthy if it weren't for all the cheese and greasy goodness.  Fries: Fine. Served with a garlic aoli/ketchup mix and tastes like it's seasoned with Lawry's spice and sugar. For $5 the order size is a bit small. The sandwiches themselves are all very filling, so you probably wouldn't need to order fries anyway.  They've also been known to randomly change up a menu for a day or invite in guest chefs to serve up something different, but I've never eaten there when that happens so I can't say what that's like either way.",

    "review_text": "Artisan Foie Gras Torchon &amp; Duck Prosciutto Sandwich, Smoked Pork Loin and Chorizo Sandwich, and 4505 Chicharrones  Read that first sandwich name again. Take a second to reflect.  Add to it that it is served with a slice of heirloom tomato which reminded me all over of what an actual tomato tastes like, butter lettuce, and black truffle salt, an ingredient that I have come to appreciate the power of in my home kitchen. I loved this sandwich so much that had I not been scheduled to take care of the little girl, I might have run back up to see if I could score another one. And I nearly strapped her into the baby Bjorn and did so anyway. It defines the word unctuous, with just enough herb from the lettuce and acid from the tomato to balance things out. And as over the top as foie gras on a sandwich sounds, duck prosciutto is even more so, in a good way.  I'd read a few reviews talking about the sandwich being very rich, so we decided to venture a try on chef Ryan Maxey's latest brain child, a smoked pork loin and chorizo sandwich. It seems odd to call a pork and sausage sandwich light, but it certainly felt light next to the foie gras. Very thinly sliced pork loin with the perfect amount of smoke, just a touch of chorizo, and a creamy sauce. If I'd gone back for another foie gras, I might have needed to grab one of these to throw in the fridge and eat later on.  I'd also read nice things about 4505 Chicharrones, so I grabbed a bag.  Quick side note: after some hard-won weight loss over the past few years, I am a diet-controlled diabetic. When I was first diagnosed, I turned to pork rinds as a low carb snack for my Friday night game nights. Although they provided me with something to cram in my gob to help me avoid eating the other snack delights that generally grace the gaming table, even the hot variety that I could find locally available had the personality, texture, and flavor of packing peanuts. This goes by way of saying that my expectations for what a chicharron could be were fairly low - I figured I'd done my time in that particular circle of gastrointestinal hell and they just weren't my thing.  Here's to my sweet pork skin. I was so very wrong.  These little crunchy treats are light and airy. They coat the inside of your entire mouth from the first bite with a pleasant film of porky goodness. The seasoning on them is at once spicy, sweet, and happiness inducing. Had I gone back up with Ainsley to grab another couple of sandwiches, several bags of these would have been acquired, too. Fortunately, although I didn't make it back up to North Beach for food, we did run across the 4505 booth at the Ferry Building just as they were closing down on Saturday and snagged another couple of bags, including a big one that I shared with my gaming group this past Friday. I was crushed to find out that FDA regulations prevent them from shipping out of state, but plans are in the works to have locals acquire a life-giving box of them to be smuggled across state lines.  Like Dynamo, Bi-Rite, and Out the Door, Naked Lunch has entered my list of places that I'll need to hit at least once during a trip to San Francisco in order for the trip to be complete. There is some crazy alchemy going on there and I wish I could make myself a regular customer. Hear that, universe? Move the Naked Lunch madmen to Utah, please.",

One meal was enough to change my mind.. and (I hope) the next few stops I make will confirm it, as they edit their limited menu every day to serve scrumptious combinations of things one would never think they would find in a sandwich.  It was 1:38pm on a Saturday when I walked in hesitantly. And before I even had the time to examine the small cozy space, I'm instantly greeted with a warm welcome from some laid back friendly guys who ask me what I'd like to have &amp; whether or not I'll be eating there. Of course, I checked their ever-changing menu before heading there, so I knew what I wanted. I say \"The foie gras - take-out.\" The guy grins and says something in approval. They seem relaxed but efficient &amp; quick to act. They asked me how long it'd be until I get to my next destination to eat, offered to pack my ice cream in ice if I needed it, and reminded another customer that there was a perishable item in their order. The folks at Naked Lunch and I were off to a good start.  As I rummage through the cluttered contents of my purse, I realize I don't have cash. They smile and let me know that there's an ATM right by the door and a Wells Fargo on Columbus, if I'd like to just place my order and come back afterwards to pick it up. Of course, being rather lazy on a Saturday afternoon, I opt for the closest thing.  The wait is a pleasant one.. the interior, though modest, allows for a peaceful time with a book and an iPod over lunch. Everyone seems so relaxed, the environment on a Saturday is conducive to destressing.   The \"ARTISAN FOIE GRAS TORCHON &amp; DUCK PROSCIUTTO SANDWICH,\" ($15) was indeed a mouthful..... I should preface this section of the review with a statement: I enjoy foie gras. My husband, my flatmate, and many of my friends don't - so I would never recommend it to them. Those of you who like foie gras, on the other hand, will LOVE this sandwich. Although the taste of the smooth, creamy, delectable foie gras was easily the dominant flavor in the sandwich, the duck prosciutto was DELICIOUS, not too dry and perfectly cured. The butter lettuce and tomato provided a balance between the whelming flavor of the foie gras and the less obvious (though still discernible) duck prosciutto. Foie gras is by nature, very rich and filling, so expect to feel stuffed after the sandwich.  I finished off with the \"THAI ICED TEA ICE CREAM,\" ($3) which my husband and I shared. I love Thai Iced Tea, so I can be rather harsh when I try things like Thai Tea donuts, pastries, cake, and various other innovative desserts. Their ice cream was not too sweet and a pleasure to eat. Well done, Flash Freeze.  I can't wait to go back and try the various daily specials as the powers behind Naked Lunch continue to play with their menu.",

Under the radar since I can go grab a sandwich and not have to wait 30+ minutes (like for Curry Up Now or Sentinel in the area).   I have had:  Cookie - YUM, super soft, tasty and full of chocolate. There were raisins in it, which I liked but beware if you're not a raisin fan.  Cinnamon sweet tea - I generally don't like sweet tea, but this was definitely an exception. It was sweet, but the cinnamon was spicy towards the end which was nice.  Artisan Foie Gras Torchon &amp; Duck Prosciutto - three letters only, OMG. Initially i thought the foie gras and duck together might be too much, but it worked out so well. I fuckin loved it.  Lamb cheesesteak with arugula - I can't decide if I liked this sandwich, or the foie gras one more. It was delicious, and the peppery arugula complimented everything.  I cannot wait to go back and get to try ALL the different options. Cash only. Food can be taken to go, or you can sit next door at their sister restaurant. patio (which is covered). Cash only.",

I sat down and read the paper while enjoying my IPA and when the sandwich arrived, it was the perfect complement to the experience. While not as fruity as I imagined, the white peaches blended nicely with the ricotta, manchego, basil, toasted almonds, honey, and arugula for a light bite.

It was so good! The soft acme bun, the juicy and tender lightly fried chicken breast, the creamy garlid aioli sauce and the cole slaw made this little sandwich ol' so perfect. This just might be the last meal I want on earth.   Another highlight about Naked Lunch is their $16 Artisan Foie Gras &amp; Duck Prosciutto sandwich. It's definitely good, I love foie gras and I love proscuitto but I just couldn't get past the \"duck\". Personally, I don't eat duck but I did give it a try. It was interesting. Yes, I am being bias. I couldn't give it more than a couple bites. What a shame, I know. If you love foie gras and duck proscuitto, then this is the sammy for you.   Cash only.",

We heard about a sandwich from some girls who had already ordered. Sounded soooo good. When we got to the front of the line and ordered two...we could only get one as they were selling out with more than an hour to go for their lunch time.  We got our food and sat under the arcade of Enrico's (another great place in SF). The food was fabulous. Have been back there two other times. All good experiences. They ran out of one of their salads the last time. Still good with what I got. Mmm...better than Ike's.",

I hate to say sandwiches because it really doesn't do any justice to the delectable pieces of art these guys are creating and at such reasonable prices.   Some may think that an average of $10 a sandwich is a bit pricey but for what you are getting this is a steal! There are no slices of processed, pre-packaged meats here and the sandwich is more like a gourmet meal in bread.  My ultimate fave is the Grilled Skirt Steak and what prompted me to finally get my ass on here and write a review today was the Grilled Cheese Onion - oh my...!",

Both were AMAZING! \u00a0The soft-shell crab was crunchy and tasty, albeit a tad oily. \u00a0The soup was even more oily but had a delicious lemon-chevre (goat cheese) floating in there to enhance the flavor. \u00a0Deliciousness was had all around.

They were really prompt with service once we were seated too and the food came out pretty fast.   My friend and I ordered the grilled asparagus sandwich and fried chicken sandwich. We also got fries. The fries were super fresh and well seasoned and they gave us (what I think was) homemade ketchup. The asparagus sandwich, oh my goodness. So I knew the fried chicken sandwich was going to be good--you can't go wrong with fried chicken. But wow that grilled asparagus was so on point. It was super filling despite being a vegetarian sandwich. The coleslaw in the fried chicken sandwich was awesome as well. Food here is great.  Definitely coming back to try other things on the menu. Their creamy tomato soup looked really delicious too.",

With bar invasions by Marina bros up Green + Grant, this is an antidote to that scene and a nice pairing with a quieter higher end cocktail around the corner at 15 Romolo.

Really interesting how even the lettuce was grilled. That gave the baby romaine some nice flavor and texture. I also liked how the brie chunk was grilled and how its rind was crispy.

This is how much I love them... I just attended the SF Chefs 2010 and all I can think about is getting NAKED... Naked Lunch that is =D Then I got deathly ill, which I still am.. but is that going to stop me? \u00a0HECK NO! What kind of foodie/writer/photographer would I be if it did. \u00a0I took the Muni by myself just to get my chicken on!   Was I about to pass out from my fever? probably... Was it worth it? Well... I happily devoured my sandwiches... and saved none for my sister! MWAHAHAH Hey I earned them because I ventured out O=D  Be sure to call ahead so that they don't run out before you get there... Sucker! I took the last 3 chicken sammies this Tuesday O=P they only had 1 left after I arrived. \u00a0I silently thought to myself... haha that's right! the early bird gets the worm and these sammies will be that much tastier since they were the last!! O=)  I love how tender and flavorful the chicken is. \u00a0Along with the light yet accentuating dressing enveloping the fried chicken. \u00a0I love the bread they use too. \u00a0Everything is just so great that I wish it was Tuesday again or that I was around 9/4/10 for the fun! I'd order 8 of them with that great deal!  Ryan was so sweet when I told him how much I loved them and especially took a bus ride out to get their sammies. \u00a0He gave me the Strawberry &amp; Mint Cream drink for free. \u00a0So sweet! I am so tipping them this Friday when I come back for more! Considering I am here for a short time and try to find ANY opportunity or time to go see them tells you a lot. \u00a0They get a coveted 5 stars from me. \u00a0I heart u guys! ^_~",

If you don't want your order to go, there are a few very comfy stools inside by the window. Or you could also enjoy the food while having a drink at Enrico's bar. It's a welcome addition for downtown workers looking for a new lunch spot. <a href=\"http://static3.px.yelp.com/bphoto/RtJIGXey9CpQ_WcTX_HRWg/l\">static3.px.yelp.com/bpho\u2026</a>  But prices are more expensive than I had originally anticipate ($10 was quoted as the average price in pre-opening announcements) - for example, the most expensive item in the menu is a $15 foie gras &amp; prosciutto sandwich. This sandwich was different from what I expected. I thought I'd get slices, instead the foie gras was a spread (like cream cheese) - the foie gras probably melted when it was heated. Also it was a little too salty. Not sure if the cause was the prosciutto or if it was over seasoned. The heirloom tomatoes inside were really good. <a href=\"http://static2.px.yelp.com/bphoto/EGottLquGhy16xBWqrCPjw/l\">static2.px.yelp.com/bpho\u2026</a>  Also on the menu this week: Pork belly sandwich - $9 Roasted eggplant with peppers, goat cheese, &amp; figs sandwich - $8 Sweet corn soup - $5 <a href=\"http://static4.px.yelp.com/bphoto/sbrfU6uIDM5dbxDUOR3aQA/l\">static4.px.yelp.com/bpho\u2026</a> Lychee limeonade - $2  On the 2nd day, the pork belly was replaced by an ahi tuna sandwich. And instead of Lychee, they had a very refreshing watermelon limeonade.

I was told that the sorbets were not available yet because they had melted. The ice cream texture was fine and the caramel flavor was okay, but it was too salty for my taste.  Since it's new, I guess they are still working at fine tuning the operation. My initial rating was 3.25 stars for the food, bumped up to 4 stars for the very friendly service. The sandwich shop concept is simple, so I have no doubt that they'll be able to change or modify whatever isn't working.  Revised hours: Tue-Sat 11:30am-2pm Phone: (415) 577-4951",

It was okay, but really I just can't handle a lot of any kind of goop that's like mayo so next time I'll definitely ask for it without. The chicken was super \u00a0moist (still crispy though too) and the slaw offered enough to it that if you're not a mayo fan, you can get by without the aioli. I added hot sauce and it was perfect.
