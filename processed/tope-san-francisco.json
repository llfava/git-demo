It was a Saturday night and wasn't that crowded at all. \u00a0The vibe was very chill but also kinda unpretentious-chic at the same time, if that even makes sense. \u00a0The DJ was playing some laid back beats and we requested some more upbeat ones but he didn't have the songs. \u00a0That's ok though, the crowd that night was not really a very dance-y crowd, but some of us danced a little in the back anyway. \u00a0  I can't speak for the price of the drinks as my friends were generous to buy me a couple, but the standard gin and tonic was good so I was happy.  I'm sure to come back to Tope a lot more!",

We ventured out that way and once we finished our meal we decided to find a bar for some drinks. We were drawn to Tope because of their happy hour special ($3 wells and drafts) until 10. We sat down and were merely acknowledged by a very disinterested bartender (older man with glasses). We order a couple drinks on HH prices. Long after finishing our drinks, the bartender does not stop by to check up on us. Instead he was huddled in a corner behind the bar on his phone the whole time. Finally my friend get his attention and we order two more drinks. No checking up on us after we finish those either. This was a Monday night, so the bar was very empty. Finally, we decide to leave. I left cash on the bar ($12 for 4 drinks plus $3 tip), but as we were walking out he stops us and says that we did not leave him enough money. Apparently we ordered the last two drinks at 10:05 and those drinks were not HH prices anymore. The bartender failed to tell us HH was ending when we ordered, and as most attentive bartenders do, he should have asked us if we wanted more drinks before the special was over instead of being on his phone the whole time.",

I now have one more neighborhood happy hour spot on my list.   Speaking of happy hours, Tope's happy hour till 10 PM deal is pretty tough to beat. $3 wells and beers on tap with the exception of Matilda. They have a pretty good selection of brews here ranging from Bud Light to stronger craft brews. I will highly recommend forking out some extra cash, especially if it's past happy hour, on Matilda! You will recognize the Goose Island Belgian style pale ale by well, a goose's head on tap. It's slightly sweet with nice floral hints but like most Belgian style ales, will knock you out deceptively.   Bartenders here are really friendly and nice but knowledgeable of their craft at the same time. They pay attention to details and make pretty good cocktails here. I've tried vodka gimlets here and thought they were well-made. My other friends seemed to enjoy their drinks too.   Looks are deceiving. Tope isn't often crowded but that disguises the fact that it is a great bar. For happy hour after most happy hours, Tope has to be on your list.",

We didn't order drinks, per se; we left everything up to the bartender, and each drink was a little surprise gift with its own charms. It was like having a series of mini-birthdays and all of the presents were fabulous cocktails made with fresh juices and herbs by an extremely talented mixologist.   Now, I love the Comstock Saloon, Rickhouse, et. al. and am not trying to take anything away from them by saying this, but the drinks here are as good as any in town for much lower prices. The ambience is classic old-school bar, but not dive-y. The bartender treated us like queens, conversed with us late into the night and made me an avid fan from the get-go. It is a testament to my personal restraint that I have been able to refrain from planting my butt on a stool there and camping out permanently. This is how regulars are created. See you soon, Tope.",

We stopped by for drinks after a dinner at Sotto Mare (which was delicious btw) and out of the three cocktails I tried, I didn't fancy any of them. I'm far from the authority on well-crafted libations though, so my input might not bear too much weight. The following are the cocktails we ordered:  1) Basil Gimlet - I ordered this with vodka and that was all I could taste. I could hardly discern the notes of basil and citrus that I was expecting. Overall, it tasted incomplete and was synonymous with downing a couple shots of Smirnoff.   2) Green Goblin - My friend got this one. It consisted of Hendrick's Gin, Fresh Basil, Lime, Green Chartreuse and Celery Bitters. It sounded interesting enough; however, my friend and I both agreed it landed somewhere close to awful. As my friend stated, \"It tastes like Thai Basil!\" And for the record, a cocktail reminiscent of Thai food isn't too tasty. This drink remained largely un-finished as nobody in our group could stomach it's taste.   3) My Thai - Another friend got this one. This one consisted of gin, jalapeno, cilantro, mango juice, and celery bitters. My friend seemed to think this was alright, but I found it on the verge of nasty. I guess I just don't like cocktails that taste like food. Honestly, I enjoyed the cranberry vodkas the rest of our group ordered more than any of the specialty cocktails (sad I know).   On the positive, the bartenders were friendly and the space itself is cozy enough. There's a small dance floor too, so that's always an option. I guess it's just a matter of personal preference, but I couldn't appreciate what Tope had to offer in the cocktail department. TWO STARS.",

It's the pub crawl event in SF where everyone dresses up like Santa or xmas related attire and indulges in drunken debauchery.

Especially Bruce, who is the shiz at creating genius cocktails - check out his list, or just tell him what you like and he works his magic. I was in the mood for whiskey and he made me a Prohibition era cocktail I had never even heard of before (and I love me some classic cocktails) - it was delicious! I like some of his modern specialties too, like the My Thai with mango juice and fresh cilantro. His seasonal drinks are also yum (wow, it sure sounds like I drink a lot!!).

It's a cute bar with a lot of personality - mostly good music and what seemed to be local clientele. Caution though - if you go to the bathroom, there is a step up. Going in is not the problem but after a few (or more) drinks if you forget about the step down coming out..ouch!!  This is a must go to place whether you are visiting the city or simply in the area.

He looked up the recipe online and made the drink for him. He even went to the back of house to pull out all the right ingredients. When I had a little taste test....it was pretty potent.

Crowd: whatever Service: whatever DJ: ASSHOLE Owner: a liar  A group of about 7-10 of us came in last Saturday night to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. I decided on dinner in North Beach followed by a few drinks. We started at La Trappe, moved to Columbus Cafe and thought we'd check out Tope since my colleagues had told me that this place had changed ownership.   My younger sister ran up to the DJ and before she could get 2 words in he aggressively YELLED at her \"NO (while putting up the P90X arms) I DON'T TAKE REQUESTS!!!) Buddy, calm the hell down... all you had to say is that you don't take requests politely and she would've moved on. Instead, she came over to me saying that the DJ was really mean and yelled at her. So, naturally, I walked over to the DJ booth and said \"hi!\" and he yelled at me \"I DON'T TAKE REQUESTS!\" I said, I realize you don't take requests, I'm not here to request a song, I'm here to tell you to get the hell over yourself and that all we're trying to do is have a good night and you're an asshole!\" He yelled a few things at me, I yelled a few things at him and then turned around to the bar and asked for the manager. Instead, I got the owner. He told me that the DJ was having a bad night and that he's sorry for his attitude. He then offered shots to our group to make up for it. I declined because it wasn't necessary, but he insisted and I finally said \"sure - we're over there\" (and pointed in the corner). Trust me, this place wasn't busy at all and so I know he saw exactly where we were.   Several minutes go by, nothing. I look over and he's not only NOT making drinks, he's just hanging out and chatting it up. Finally, I turned to the group and said \"let's get the hell out of here.\" I walked over and said, \" you can forget the drinks, we're leaving.\" He then replied \"I couldn't tell who was the person who was having the birthday so i just decided not to make the drink!\" I just shook my head in disbelief. What's with the lies, dude!? We left and spent our money elsewhere.   So, Tope = \u00a0NOPE! There's no HOPE with TOPE! haha... this place is whack.",

I really have no excuse other than a mixture of being extremely busy at work and simply falling into a rut of going to all my usual haunts that I already have reviewed.   This has made me realize what a creature of habit I have become ever since the boy was deployed to Alaska in January. I go to my usual lunch spots, grab dinner down the street from my house, and meet friends for Happy Hour at North Star and Columbus Cafe on the regular. While emailing back and forth with said boy a few weeks ago, we both realized that he would be home very soon (mid-April).  \"What do you want to do for your first night back in SF?\" I asked him, although knowing his first response would probably be something endearingly childish like \"You!\"   And as predicted, he quickly messeged back with a simple and to the point, \"You!\"  \"No really,\" I giggled....I mean come on, that's obvious. \"Do want to go get dinner somewhere? I can cook? It's YOUR welcome home party.\" To my surprise, his response was quite simple but I didn't have even one suggestion in mind.  \"I want to grab a nice drink in the neighborhood, maybe somewhere like a lounge where we could dance too\" he wrote. Hmmm, every place that I know of in North Beach is either a chill dive bar, a tourist trap or a bridge-and-tunnel-cover-charging-club scene. I would have to do some research.   Very soon after this conversation, I heard that the boys over at the Boardroom had opened up a new spot called \"Tope\" on Grant not far from my house and my usual other hangouts. The roommates and I decided to check it out on a rainy Wednesday and ended up being the only people there. I love the renovations they have made, very comfortable and swanky vibe. The bartender whipped us up some yummy whiskey cocktails and told us to come back and try a weekend night, we would not be disappointed. So this last Saturday night, while wandering the 'hood for my friend and fellow Yelper Mindy M's birthday, I talked the crew into stopping in the check it out.   The place was PACKED, but we still scored the back table and never waited long to order drinks or use the restroom (these are important \"bar\" perks to mention.) They had a DJ spinning some awesome dancehall and reggae, and before you knew it we had a full on dance party happening into the wee morning hours. They offer a full bar and quite an eclectic selection of beers for you connoisseurs out there.   Long story short, I think I found exactly the environment the boy is looking for, for a fun welcome home night on the town...and a fun dance party stop for me and the ladies on girl's night out. I'll be back! Thanks for opening up a cool new spot in the neighborhood!",

He doesn't just throw your martini together, he actually gives a damn. And, if you're feeling adventurous have Bruce mix something special for you.   If its beer you like, Casey the owner is definitely a well of knowledge. He keeps a steady rotation of nice brews on tap.

He knows quite a bit about the liquors, where they came from, which ones are dry, which ones have a deep finish, a long draw, so on, and so forth! I learned quite a bit about several whiskeys, bourbons, ginger beer, and even Barenjager! Some of his stories even came with little tastings! If I didn't have to drive back home that night, I would have closed the place down!   Oh, and Happy Hour till 10pm every day??? Ok, maybe just one more!   Slainte!",

One of my favorite bartenders is Justin! He does a great job of making sure everyone is taken care of.  Prices: you get a lot of bang for your buck Scene: early in the evening it is mellow, and as the night progresses it gets a bit busy, but that's what makes it fun! Always a good scene there :)",

Bartender was friendly and definitely on top of things. He served drinks, cleaned spills (sorry!), cleared tables, and put a note on the out-of-order bathroom. Bartender also gave my two birthday buddies free drinks, G Spot was the name. Drinks were good, although they weren't consistent. Ordered multiples of a few drinks since we had a group of eight but the drinks didn't all taste the same. We got two AMFs one was pretty fatal and the other was a tasty concoction. So take note of that.  Also, you control the music in the bar to an extent. Download this app on your smartphone and you can control the music in the bar. When you choose your music, please be tasteful, unlike that lady who played 'I'm Sexy and I Know It' and 'Like a G6'.  Bar &amp; Restrooms are clean, chairs are comfy, and the toilets flush well.

Then, to top it off, he remembers you forever (even when you pass him on the street beyond the walls of the bar).  I suppose, depending on the type/scale of the issues you bring with you, this super power might not be what you want in a bartender... but for me, it's highly amusing and has enamoured me to the bar.   Tope is my favourite place in San Francisco to stop in, chill and have a couple of beers. It often has awesome tunes playing, drinks are great (tell them what you like and they'll fix you something perfect!) and the general \"vibe\" is really enjoyable.

So squeezing between the bar and 5 people deep behind it is about all you can do. Throw in some loud music and it makes mingling or even attempting to stand near all your friends pretty much impossible.   I actually like this place and think it has real potential - but they need to do a bit more crowd control and not let so many people in at once!",

Uh, yeah. \u00a0I ain't sayin nope to tope! \u00a0(coz I'm so dope?) \u00a0:p  * okaaay, the rhyming stops here *  Unlike other North Beach bars that embody the dive/sports bar theme, Tope does the exact opposite: funky wallpaper, local artwork, fresh juices, fruit compote and bitters grace the cocktail menu. \u00a0  There were only 5 cocktails on the menu and 2 were for vodka fans. (I'm looking out for my peeps!) I wanted to try the Eastwood, a whiskey based cocktail with orange marmalade. I mean, marmalade is supposed to stay in the breakfast category, right?! I was concerned with this drink being too sweet (since it's also made with carpano antica) and when I expressed my concern to the bartender, he just smiled and said, \"oh no, it's not sweet at all!\" I was sold. The Benedictine and the fresh grapefruit really helped to counteract the sweet components in this drink and Templeton Rye has that smooth, lingering finish which stood up to the marmalade.   My friend's vodka based Fresh Prince had muddled cucumber and ginger beer. Can you say, oh so yummy on a warm day?   So the cocktails are good but scenesters maybe disappointed, because there isn't any in here! but if you're looking to have a mellow happy hour catching up with your girlfriend surrounded by local clientele and the occasional tourist, this is your spot. \u00a0Also, happy hour lasts til 10pm which means $3 well drinks and beers on tap.

    "review_text": "Another top notch cocktail bar outside of 15 Romolo and Comstock Saloon in North Beach? You betcha!  After more than a few pals hipped me to Tope over the past few weeks and months, this nifty little bar had been on my \"to-do\" list of sorts for much longer than it should have. I suppose I don't spend much time in North Beach, so that could explain why it's taken me so long to dip in... but now that there's a third player in the quality elixir game just a stone's throw from the better known haunts of 15 Romolo and Comstock Saloon, chances are, you'll find me in the 'hood a bit more frequently.   Tope seems to be flying under the radar on Grant Street, sitting just a few uphill strides from the hustle and bustle of Columbus... and that's a good thing because I want this place all to myself! It's dark, there's a real fun group of locals, they have free tacos from nearby Nico's at happy hour Thursday - Saturday, and best of all... nobody behind the bar takes themselves too seriously. In fact, I really wanted to try a drink on their menu called the \"Hey, That's My Tractor!\" Not only did the name strike a cord with me (I grew up on a farm in Southern California), the ingredients in this notable potable grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and begged me to indulge. While I'm not remembering every last piece to the puzzle of this interesting beverage, I do know it contained muddled dill, vodka, and Sriracha. If you know anything about me at all, you know how much I love the Cock Sauce! So naturally, that was my drink of choice. However, the bartender informed me the drink was temporarily unavailable because they'd just run out of Sriracha... so I offered my assistance in procuring a bottle elsewhere in hopes of sipping on my desired mixed drink. With the help of my gal pal Monica, we acquired a bottle with a little slight of hand (don't ask...), gave it to the bartender, and they made my cocktail with a smile. Not sure how many bars would play along with something like that, but Tope knows how to have a good time, friends.   In addition to my favored fire water selection, they have a litany of others that appeal to all types of drinkers, they have a TV that's typically fixed to the Giants game when they're playing, and again... it just has a relaxed, casual vibe that you don't normally find at bars with cocktails of this caliber. Exactly what I look for in a bar, and if I lived in the area, there's no question this would be my regular neighborhood hang.",
