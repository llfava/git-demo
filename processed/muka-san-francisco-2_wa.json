They've got Frenchies backing the concept, so the provisions are well chosen and the wine menu written on a chalboard like the French are known to do.   The space has tons of light, the wall facing the street is all windows. For the \"see and be seen\" set, this is your spot. It's on the outskirts of Hayes Valley but makes a nice casual pit stop after a day of shopping/strolling/spending too much money. They offer happy hour 2PM to 6PM TOUS LES JOURS! with wine, \u00a0sangria, and bartender's beer choice all for $5. Sold.   We had some wine, cocktails, and a cheese plate, all solid. Asking for more bread is certainly no faux pas where the Frenchies are concerned (I know I love my stereotypes, but so many are true!) Service was friendly and chill in the afternoon -- I imagine the night time scene is a little more lively.   In fact, they promote their vibe as \"coffee by day, cocktails by night\", so you really can work and play your way through the day, right here.   Sexy, modern, casual spot for an afternoon apertif and some prime people watching, a la francaise.",

Service, taste and atmosphere... \u00a0Muka has it all. \u00a0  Service: \u00a0Jean-luc, the owner is usually on hand with a big smile and welcoming attitude. \u00a0If you've visited more than once, a big hug may be included for the lucky ones. \u00a0Robert, the lead bartender, is quick with a smile and a story while he creates a specialty drink with fresh basil or pours your happy hour beer. The feel is family, and you're a part of it. \u00a0  Taste: \u00a0The Japanese inspired selections are fresh, savory and affordable. \u00a0 A selection of small plates that range from $4 to $8 will meet almost every need, from vegetables picked up in the am from the Farmer's Market to tasty chicken wings to fried polenta. \u00a0The entrees (lamb pot pie anyone?) \u00a0averaging $15 are perfect after a long day as well. \u00a0The desserts are delightful and evil temptations.   Atmosphere: \u00a0This is the perfect neighborhood bar. \u00a0Instead of focusing on trendy style or a modern theme, Jean-luc went with taste and old school. \u00a0I've stopped by for a drink in jeans and when dressed up for a night. \u00a0Music often has a beat to it but one can have a conversation without yelling. \u00a0The size is perfect for intimacy but large enough to not feel crowded. \u00a0  Muka is my new favorite neighborhood spot in Hayes Valley. \u00a0But ssssshhhhh - don't tell anyone!!!",

The croissant sandwiches are tasty. Great shrimp and egg salad! I was not to thrilled with the soups, the Japanese curry (too salty and not served with rice--huh?). They have some homemade chips (lemon pepper potato chips, satsuma imo chips--which is like a japanese sweet potato), but they taste more 'dessicated' (dried out) than chippy.

Our second waitress didn't suffer from amnesia but did suffer from a stick-up-her-butt (which is worse? tough question). Not only was she snobbishly curt, but she swapped our check with that of table next to us (out of the 3 groups there, goodness) and gave us a look that made it seem as if it was OUR fault.  Second was the options. They have three desserts on their menu, but they only had two in stock. Really? Aren't you a drinks&amp;dessert venue? I will say that the MONT BLANC, $13, is fairly tasty. It's reminiscent of a Ferrero Rocher, though the macaron they put on top is yuckily soggy and tastes like egg.  Lastly, their last call for drinks was at 9:30 PM. Don't your hours say 1 AM?

Though there were definitely some redeeming qualities (friendliness, ambiance, cleanliness), everything else was so inept that it made me question how they even function as a business. Where to start?  I came on a weekend evening. After taking the place in, I found someone to confirm that they were indeed still serving coffee and our party ordered a drip and 2 cappuccinos. At which point things started to fall apart.  Baffling issue: they didn't know what a drip was. Lingo aside, the coffee is specifically listed as \"drip\" on their menu. The French manager had to be called over, consulted, and a confusing discussion ensued before we got our coffee (the coffee is a large urn dispenser coffee, refills being free).   Okay. We were then informed that the cappuccinos would be brought over. After 10 minutes (it was not a busy night), I walk over to check and find no one in sight while my cups are sitting under the espresso machine. Another 5 minutes before the guy comes over and asks if we're doing okay, at which point I had to remind him about my order. He apologized profusely and proceeded to bring me a drip. Huh? More confusion and apologizing. Another 5 minutes before our cappuccinos arrive... which looks and tastes like drip coffee with poured milk and foam stirred in. Uh? A few minutes later a group of 5 sits down and were promptly served their cappuccinos in a few minutes. Um?  Did I mention that during the 1.5 hours we were there the music was non-stop Daft Punk? I like Daft Punk. Except when the playlist jumps from TRON to Humans to covers/remixes to RAM to various ft. Daft Punk back to.... TRON. Every 3-5 minutes felt like a jarring change of pace. I could barely get my head around it and then all of a sudden they were closed. An hour early. Maybe Yelp error? Either way, they had pretty much finished closing up before realizing that ours and the other group were still in the back. A friend of the manager noticed us through the window, came back in, and loudly ushered us out between the upped chairs and barred entrance all while snapping her fingers at us (though in a playful kind of way).  Utterly. Bizarre. Experience.   I put off writing this review for a while because I wanted some time to think over it before leaving a 2-star review. Even after going over my review and noticing how whiny I come off mentioning my cappuccinos a dozen times and leaving a wall of complaints I'll still be going through with it because it's all true. I'm being brief and I still needed this many words to detail how many strange things I saw in the span of an hour or two. It only sucks because I WANT to like this place and it feels like there's so much potential.  Sorry?",

The staff and service were spectacular, making sure the food came out at a good pace so we weren't eating the same thing all night.  The food, oh the food. The polenta nuggets were ridiculous, whoever came up with that must be a god among men. The star of the night though, was that gratin. Ooey, gooey, cheesy and soaked up all that scotch really well.  I'm definitely coming back to try their dinner menu. If it's even 10% as good as what we had Friday night, I won't be disappointed.",

Grabbing a drink (or four) is also surprisingly affordable given the quality.  As of right now I am sitting down with a cup of French pressed coffee typing away blissfully. Thank you for existing Muka!",

We didn't really know what we wanted to drink, so we just told the waiter what was the main liquor we wanted used, and the bartenders did a pretty good job of mixing up a drink to our taste.  For the 2 small bites we got the small bean salad and the chocolate mousse. The bean salad fresh, and the beans was big and meaty, but were just the right tenderness. The chocolate mouse was so smooth, and just the right amount of richness. In terms of the price to plate size ratio, I would say it was pretty fair. I wish I was a little hungrier to check out the rest of the menu. I plan on doing that the next time I go there.  I loved the look of the space. It had a very cool and sexy vibe to it with all of the dark wood. I liked the music that they played - it was a good mix of pop and mainstream, hipster-ish type music.  Overall, I def. plan on coming back to this place to check out more of the food.",

Surprisingly, there's not a TON of places to go have a drink in the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday in Hayes Valley. There's some, but a lot of 'em get crowded due to various sporting events. Totally fine if you're in the mood to have a beer and hot wings (yum!), but what if you just want a glass of wine and a cheese plate? Quite a few of the restaurants in the 'hood close between 2-5 pm, so it's a matter of wandering the streets, looking for booze. Sort of like a hobo, but way less stinky.  Muka is open in the middle of the afternoon. On a Sunday. And they serve lots of delicious wine. There's even happy hour pricing on the weekends, which is a wonderfully rare find. Even a sparkling vino on tap for $10, a steal in my book. Though bubbly sounded good, house sangria was on special and I couldn't resist. As soon as I made my selection, the bartender said \"Oooh, nice choice.\"   How special can sangria be? Let me tell you, they do it up at Muka. Served in a fancy Duvel glass and topped with mint sprig, this is not your typical sticky sangria in a cup. Worth every penny of that $6 drink. Also ordered a panini with mozzarella and tomato, which was a nice substitute for a cheese plate. Ooey, gooey and perfect for two people to split as a snack.  Bartenders were so nice, they kept refilling our water and letting us hang while watching football on mute. That's how most sports should be enjoyed, IMHO. A lovely Sunday funday afternoon adventure!",

They also don't have a microwave to heat up the sandwiches and the bread wasn't crispy... Kind of a soggy/cold baguette.  The owner was super nice about it though and explained that they have someone come in the morning and make the sandwiches for the day. I totally understand but BUY A MICROWAVE OR TOASTER OVEN! Seems like a painfully cheap and simple solution.  The house made chips were delicious. Again, pre-packaged but tasted fresh.   There are so many options for happy hour and tasty bar food in the area. I think the concept could be great with some tweaking of the menu. The space is also really great and airy/lots of windows",

I personally choose Hayes Valley when dining because of the variety, quality and close proximity to me. Some of the best places and experiences I've had dining has been in Hayes Valley - so it's definitely a competitive neighborhood to be in as a food or bar. I came across Muka with a friend who had friends dining, drinking and spending the evening there. It had more charm than most places I've stepped into and right away you felt a familiar feeling - it \u00a0had that effect. It's small and cozy and had an old-time jazz-circa era feel that was both nostalgic and friendly. I was in for a special treat that night as there was live music and a very friendly crowd! It added to the throwback feeling. Myself and my friend ended up having some awesome drinks - handcrafted \"made with love\" cocktails. The bartender seemed more than knowledgable in mixology and the drinks were delicious and strong! The best treat of all was the dessert we indulged in as a post-dinner treat. It was decadent beyond words and even though I was beyond full we both couldn't help but basically scrape the plate. This was only a mere insight as to what the food, desserts and drinks are like. I would gladly dine here again and potentially have the opportunity to try appetizers and entrees. Definitely a great place to check out as it very much embodies a true \"SF\" nostalgic feeling for it's customers.",

It seems like they get a lot of locals, which is cool and gives you a bit of the Cheers vibe that every borderline alcoholic wants.  I only have too measly, small complaints:   1. The place is a bit pricey. My atrocious San Francisco rent makes me poor, so I prefer to drink at places that are somewhat more affordable. Even their happy hour prices are not the happiest that they could be.   2. There's not much in the way of food here. My friends and I showed up at Muka on a Saturday evening to drink before our Weeknd concert, right at the tail end of happy hour only to find that we missed the boat and couldn't even order the cheese plates and other small appetizers that can be purchased earlier in the evening. Not a deal breaker, but it would be nice to be able to order munchies throughout the night as you sit and chat with your (presumably) fancy friends.

I have been to Muka for coffee (ask for the Muka Mocha) and lunch (the beet salad is better than it sounds so combine it with a tasty sandwich) and cocktails (Russ (and Jean-Luc) can make some drank!).   There are many options to choose from in Hayes Valley but Muka just gets it right on so many different levels. It starts with the management being attentive to patrons and experienced at great customer service. JL is friendly, charismatic, and forward-thinking - always looking for details that would improve the customer experience. The staff members are not pretentious, work very well together, and lead with \"yes\" (so be nice (and tip often) to Chelsea, Russ, Ray and Sostrong (you gotta love it)). Which leads directly to tasty product - flavorful drinks made with care and from unique, purposefully selected ingredients and an international selection of bites (which fits the clientele).   Bottom line: Great Service + Fantastic Product = Success  I was introduced to Muka by a high school friend from NYC that I randomly ran into in the Mission and he invited me to a musical performance at Muka one Sunday evening. I came for the performance and stayed for the inviting environment. I have since been to Muka a few times a week and had a party and happy hour at Muka.   Thank you for the great memories, Muka!

We were one of the first people in, but nevertheless it took almost 15 minutes for us to get water, another 10 to put in our orders. We waited around 45 minutes for our food to arrive, when I asked the waiter what happened they apparently had our order slip covered up by another order slip in the kitched, so they didn't see it. To their credit they did get the food on the table in the next 10 minutes, but we were already grumpy and we just left cash on the table when it took another 15 minutes to try to get the bill in vain. We were not the only ones visibly annoyed by the lack of service, maybe they were understaffed that night, but it made sure I'll never return again.

    "review_text": "I love the vibe at Muka; in the morning it's mellow enough to sit with come coffee and wifi while evenings are more lively without being overwhelmingly crowded, perfect to come and hang out with some friends.   The drinks are amazing- sure it may seem pricey, but you're paying for great quality in a place that is impeccably clean AND getting service by very friendly bartenders (unlike the usual pretentious bartenders that seem so ubiquitous in SF). Would highly recommend the Maza- so delicious and gives you the perfect buzz.   Cheese and charcuterie plate is great to share with friends for your drunchies! They have a great selection of cheese and the bread is so good. Their soups blow my mind- beef stew, carrot, and split pea are rather common but Muka has a soup magician that somehow makes it so that after the first spoonful you're like \"WOAH, that's damn good.\" \u00a0  Friendly staff, great quality, and diverse atmosphere- yeah, I'll definitely keep coming back!",

We loved it - had \u00a0the Japanese cucumber fennel salad, so fresh and tasty. Followed by the organic burrata with brioche toasts and fruit motarda and their carbonara with applewood bacon. \u00a0So comforting. Had two glasses of wine, very generous pour. And for dessert, the Earl gray panna cotta w/ Earl gray gelee. Super yum! Great food, great prices and happy servers! Can't wait to go back! Wish them well though their success will mean less tables available as walk-ins but they deserve it.",

Candles on every table, \u00a0music in the background that does not dominate your conversation, \u00a0and food that seems ever so delicately prepared. \u00a0The drink menu is just a bonus, \u00a0with carefully chosen wines and cocktails. Will definitely return !",

We sat in the dining area for a good 15 minutes but no one ever came to take our order even though other patrons had been served. I walked up to the bar to order our drinks and after another 5 minutes of being ignored, I called it quits. It was a Monday night so there was no reason to wait that long to order a drink.",

    "review_text": "This place is one of Hayes Valley's best kept secrets!  I remember the old Muka located on Bush &amp; Polk. It was this cool, subterranean wine/dessert bar underneath a French school. And while I'll miss that off-the-beaten-path charm of their former space, I think this new Hayes Valley location is going to attract a lot more foot traffic for the owners.  My friends and I came in here a few Saturdays ago for their daily happy hour (2pm - 6pm!!). This place has the look and feel of a Parisian bistro. We saddled up at a 4-top by the window (perfect for people watching in the neighborhood), and indulged in adult beverages as well as tasty cheese and bread. I really enjoyed their cocktail called the Carre - which was like a tasty twist on a Manhatten. My friends swore by Muka's Sangria. They claimed it was the best one they've ever had in SF. That's high praise.  Service here is super casual. We ordered drinks at the bar, and then our friendly bartender delivered them to our table. If you're hungry, Muka also offers a variety of sandwiches and light bites. Don't come expecting a full-on restaurant experience. Muka 2.0 brands itself more as coffee by day/cocktails by night kind of place - which is totally fine by me.  If you don't want to spend an arm-and-a-leg at Jardiniere or Absinthe before or after a show, then put Muka on your radar. You'll be glad you did.",

The bartender and owner were super friendly and they did a great job choosing wines for us. Really enjoyed the personal touch. Got the chocolate mousse and it was delicious.  The decor is simple and nice. Seems like they have a lot of space to grow into as they also have a cool back (or is it side) room.",

    "review_text": "Muka holds a special place in my heart because I loved its prior location in Nob Hill. The new Muka is conveniently located a block from the Symphony. The menu is new, and their cocktail list seems to change all the time, so I definitely never tire of stopping in and grabbing a seat and drink at the bar. A little sad that there isn't an array of macarons for dessert!  There's a great happy hour if you can get in before it's over. $5 house wine, sangria and other specials. One night we came in, it was beets and a glass of wine deal. The small plates are all very tasty, so definitely recommend going for drinks and bites, especially if you're heading to a show.   Also hosted a birthday party in the bar area on a Friday night. They were super accommodating and made sure that I had everything I wanted the night of.",
