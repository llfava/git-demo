Grumpy's is a great place to wind down after work during happy hour. They have HH specials all week. It's also a great place to eat. From their appetizers to their burgers and salads, their food is delicious. Just note, that you cannot get a salad after about 5:00 pm. But why would you when their burgers and fries are amazing. I've heard their turkey burger is one of the best in town. I have never eaten it myself, but I trust the folks I've heard this from.  Drinks are their specialty. But not in terms of fru-fru drinks like Mojitos, but real drinks like Vodka &amp; Soda, Jack and Coke, etc. From Monday - Wednesday (I think), you can get a shot and a draft for $7. They have a list of liquors that you can get for the shot.  Friday's special is usually 24 oz Tecate beers for something like $3! That's just plain crazy!  But the most amazing this is they just started carrying Miller High Life! The Champagne of Beers!   If you work (or live) in the neighborhood, you should wander over to Grumpy's for a drink or two. The place is nice, the bartenders are great and the regulars are a colorful bunch. Sit at the bar and an interesting conversation is minutes away.  Cheers!",

Also, there is something to be said about their \"side\" salad, which I normally get instead of fries. \u00a0It's a huge pile of greenery, with all sorts of beans, veggies and hard boiled eggs on top. \u00a0Get the balsamic dressing-- it is tangy and a little sweet and PERFECT.

The fried chicken, lamb and trout items at the bottom of the menu are worth exploring, and reasonably priced. I had the grilled trout today, it took forever to come out, but it was good. Not sure if the bar girl took it off the bill because it was so late, or it was late because it never made it on the bill, but either way, it was free. Luckily they had some Fat Tire and Anchor Steam on tap, to while away the time waiting.  Overall, a great place, well worth the trek to get there. Just for that rich mac and cheese...",

Speaking of waits, forget about getting a table during happy hour as Grumpy's will be packed with folks enjoying post-work happy hour specials like a beer and a shot for $7 Mon-Wed.

I mean, like sitting down and waiting about 20 minutes to get someone to bring you water and take your order. The wait staff always looks like they are in a frenzy but then when they do come over, they don't bother to apologize for the wait.  And speaking of wait, the place gets packed at lunch time and you can wait up to a half hour to get a table. They also like to do the \"do you mind sitting at another table so a bigger party can take this table\" B.S. and I can't stand that. The other day I saw them doing it to people who had their drinks already. Pathetic.   So if you're going for a super early or super late lunch it may be a good experience. If you're going between 11:30 and 1:30 have a snack before heading out.",

We noticed that the ceiling had lots of dollar bills pinned to it. We were told that it has to do with happy hour held long ago.  Our server was friendly. I ordered the tuna melt, mac n cheese and fries. The mac is your typical pub mac and cheese. Runny cheese sauce poured on top of elbow macaroni with a sprinkle of black pepper. Tuna melt was better than average. Layered with caramelized red onions and cheese. Tuna is browned on one side which adds dimension to the taste as opposed to your typical tuna heated on bread with cheese. Fries were typical too. Kinda soggy. \u00a0The tuna melt was the winner and will bring me back.  If you're looking for a more cozy pub, check this place out.",

    "review_text": "The two guys sitting at the bar next to me have been coming to Grumpy's for years, and were quick to offer tips on good apps there: skins and onion rings. However, I was there solely to try the bacon cheeseburger. Fortunately, they acknowledged the burger section as the best part of Grumpy's menu. Keep in mind that we're talking pub food; fanciness isn't expected, but rather good quality for a good price.   You can't help but like a bar full of local media/advertising people who want to talk about anything but work. Personal pinions spill out after being sewn in by a long day of objective or targeted speech. Grumpy's is a straightforward local pub that will continue to be popular for years. And while my fun experience there made me want to like the burger a lot, I can't say it's one of my favorites from this burger quest over the past nine months.  The sesame bun was average and the patty itself was cooked medium rare, not medium as ordered. That's ok, because the bacon was present in every bite, and the juice from the patty and toppings filtered down to my fries, just as I'd hoped. The fries themselves were decent, roughly on par the burger.   Overall, Grumpy's should never disappoint, especially if you get a burger there. Go there for a beer and stay for a couple more. Order one of their specialty burgers if you're looking to be wowed, and consider the sauteed mushrooms, which seemed to be a popular topping.",

Grumpy that everyone has an excuse to act a drunken hot mess at EDC and I'm sober.  Grumpy that everyone has an excuse to whore out at EDC as I sit here in my granny panties.  Yah SO I'm just a grumpy jealous beezie today but thankfully not as grumpy as Kim Kardashian and Kanye's daughter will be in 16 years...  Who da eff names their kid \"North\"? North West? WTF!

So I found Grumpy's on Yelp. His place is in no man's land. Nothing around but business complexes. This is a local hangout and a true blue dive bar.   We got here about 11:30 and the place is empty. We got our choice table. At about 12:15 then all the local came pouring in. Very relaxing but tight seating.   I had the Chili Cheese Burger and fries. I read they had really good burgers here. Anyways, it's served open faced. Chili was homemade and was okay. Burger was just okay. Not a great meal. I guess I just didn't pick the right burger.   My daughter had the Manhattan Melt with ham, turkey, lettuce, tomato, cheese on a grilled sour dough bread. Outstanding. Really good. They give you four huge piece. She got the potato salad on the side with this. Really good. Outstanding. Had a little kick to it. Yum yum good.   My son had the meatloaf plate. Meatloaf was out of this world. Drop dead meatloaf. So good. Unbelievable. The homemade Mac &amp; Cheese was okay. A little salty. The vegetables were so good and sweet. Outstanding dish.   My wife had the chicken Cesar salad. She really like it a lot. Very good  Anyways, service was very good. Water cups were filled in a regular basis. I accidentally spilled my water cup (can you say clumsy) and we had two waitresses cleaning it up right away. That's what I call good service.   So if your looking for a local spot away from all the touristy places. Somewhere out of the way but not that bad of an area then this is the place for you. Just be careful of what you order. Read the Yelp reviews first then order. Enjoy.",

    "review_text": "So, one of my business partners and I landed a contract that was about two blocks from this joint and remarkably, there just isn't that many \"go-to's\" for lunch in that area (Green Street and Embarcadero) The Ferry Building got old, Piperade was just a bit too \"la-dee-da\" for a quick lunch. Between this, Old Ship and RJ's Market (which is pretty good) we found ourselves polarized by the convenience of Grumpys. So that said, my ramble below pertains only to lunch experiences.  So, once you get your head and belly into a \"sandwiches, burgers and salads\" type of mindset, the place delivers. To date, I've stayed on the middle-of-the-road path with the menu (classic cheeseburgers with fries or a side salad, grilled chix sandwiches, tuna melts, \u00a0cobb salads, beet salads, etc.) and ALL of that grub was prepped and served up really well. Proteins were fired to perfection at the right temps, fries were crisp and soft on the inside with great seasoning, salads were big and put together with a mix of toppings and textures to make even something so basic, still delish. You actually catch yourself thinking, \"wow, the food here is pretty damn good.\"  AND...mind you, I haven't even tried any of the Signature Burgers (15+ gourmet burger types from the Baja to the Popeye), the chicken parm, the turkey plate, other fancier salads or any of the bar-food apps. SO, I can only imagine this place gets better and better. The bartender was talking me into the chili-cheese fries, which are supposed to be damned good, but I was already two beers down and needed to head out for a meeting.  Which brings me to booze, staff and ambiance. Booze: great beers on tap and affordable hard liquor bevvies and happy hour specials. Great place for liquid lunches - ding ding ding. \u00a0Staff: Welcoming and friendly, just as we all like. In the mad rush, they can get a bit busy so sometimes it can feel a little slow (in the kitchen or front of house) but they keep up for the most part and do it with coolness, kindness and smiles. Ambiance: Hell, it's a pub/barfood joint. If you're looking for tablecloths and a sommelier then you might keep on steppin'. BUT, if a pile of kegs in the corner, a bunch of tables crammed edge to edge, Sportscenter on on the TVs, Foo Fighters (yes Dave Grohl gets loud when they come on in there for some reason) rockin' in the background and great food at a great price...go get you some Grumpys.   And, if you figure out what the hell the bulldog with the fern leaf logo is all about, you win free Grumpys for life. Just kidding. I just want to know what the backstory is on that.   Cheers.",

First of all, to the people who think prices here are expensive need to loosen up a bit on their money purses. \u00a0It's in San Francisco; you go to a place that hugs the North Beach - Financial district border, what do you expect? \u00a0Seriously, you frugal fairies, bony bastards, parsimonious pieces of shit...how many items do you see here over $10  Second of all, waiters wait and bartender are bartend. \u00a0Do I see Dr. Phil or Silvia Browne in here? No! \u00a0They can't read your mind nor predict your thinking and thank God, cuz no one really wants to know what the hell goes on inside that stupid little head of yours. \u00a0If you received the wrong order or if your order took longer, ASK (politely) and they - like any good barstaff - will get it right. \u00a0It's OK to ask the bartender how much longer your food will take or send your food back for the right order. \u00a0They thrive on word of mouth and much rather you leave happy than you leave unsatisfied...DUH...Stop sitting there pissed off and arguing with the world with your eyes and posture, no one likes that shit you wuss. \u00a0  My friend and I came here on a Wednesday night and imbibed in that night's specials - $7 shot and beer, $1 garlic fries...oh garsh, almost broke my piggy bank!! \u00a0We got fish and chips and a burger. \u00a0The large portions helped pad the stomach for the beers we ordered. \u00a0The bartender was overworked - he ran the bar and restaurant orders by himself and didn't shower us with attention - boohoo. \u00a0Each step of the way I needed to ask for attention - \"I'd like to order drinks please,\" \"Can we order food?\" \"We'll take the check now\"...how difficult was that??!?!? \u00a0He was nice about it, told some jokes, interacted with us and harassed us to come back and visit. \u00a0The bill? \u00a0A mind blowing $24...  An interesting mix of crowd (at least when we went) - financial district people, loud bridge and tunnel dudes, a softball team and a group of three chicks that could make Stevie Wonder cry. \u00a0It's a homey place - felt (and looked) a bit like Paddy's Pub from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. \u00a0I like the vibe here, I definitely felt at ease here and would come back for happy hour. \u00a0Signs on the walls, dollar bills pinned to the ceiling and funny lookin' chicks create a homey vibe with a tinge of amusement. \u00a0The Jaeger keg however, reminds you it's still a legit drinking establishment.",

The beer selection at Grumpy's was not as expansive as RE's but they definitely had a good selection (Anchor, Lagunitas IPA, Dos Equis, Hef, etc.) so for me Grumpy's held par. \u00a0The place is much smaller and had quite the lunch rush, but we still were able to walk right in at 1 pm on Friday and get seated. Our order was taken promptly enoug and our beers came out ahead of our meal.  I got a burger, medium rare, and my friend got a \"Manhattan\" which was kind of like a club sandwich. \u00a0He reported that it was good. My burger was also very good. Perfectly sized in that I could have eaten more but didn't need to. \u00a0The cheese was quality aged chedder and the bacon was perfectly cooked. \u00a0The fries were also good (I would have wanted more on the plate, but didn't NEED more). \u00a0The burger and sandwich were about $10/each. \u00a0Beers were $5/pint.  I was able to get my meal, two beers and out in about an hour which is the perfect time. \u00a0The place is kind of loud but it was busy and not to the point we were annoyed.  Grumpy's is a little out of the way, but worth the walk on a nice day. It's about 10 minutes from the Financial District. \u00a0If I was in between RE and Grumpy's, I would probably choose Grumpy's 80% of the time. Definitely worth a stop as they have many other choices on the menu, all of which looked good.",

It is solely for business hours and work happy hours. That being said - this is a great bar to come for a drink with coworkers after 5. They also have great take out for lunch - great burgers and fries along with your typical fried bar fare. It's a little pricey for what you get, but hey - its Levi's Plaza - not too many other options around.",

The food menu is great pub food, burgers, grilled sandwiches, god if you like BLT's, who doesnt, its awesome. They have TV's on the wall for you viewing pleasure and a fun comfortable atmosphere. May I recommend you get here before 11:45AM, as any financial district favorite goes, this one is BUTT SLAMMED for M-F lunch.

Definitely hit the spot after a long day of roaming SF.  The interior is pretty small and very dark - a typical pub-like feel. There are a bunch of bills stuck on the ceiling and the tables are in a tight arrangement. Felt a little dingy, but what pub doesn't?  All in all, great find and not to mention it's a short walking distance from the pier!

The onion rings were again good but not great. i'd come back again if a friend wanted to go but I wouldn't come back on my own.

Placing the batsignal to prison fodder Hueyn/Mindy, we arrived to a packed bar. \u00a0Grumpy's is a very small area and on the initial scan, this place reminded me of the mythical Tortuga. \u00a0At the bar, you see full-blossomed strumpets laughing at every joke of their consorts, vying for attention and hopefully, another drink, slyly letting their robust chest touch said man's arm from time to time. \u00a0Ahhh..the power of female wiles. \u00a0Basically, for you Davis alumni, this is Cantinas del Cabo in the daytime. \u00a0The manager was very gracious despite the crowd and rush of orders, ushered us to our table in a timely fashion. \u00a0I ordered the Baja burger while Mindy ordered the Western burger. \u00a0Our waitress was brisk and curt, understandable with the lack of manpower here, and could not engage in banter. \u00a0My gripe with this place is that the food took forever which seems to be a reoccurring theme among it's clients. \u00a0The problem with this is two fold: 1. \u00a0one gets extremely hungry 2. \u00a0most importantly, if your company is with somebody similar to Huyen/Mindy and his stories of getting turned out in prison become trite and downright sick, the conversation becomes rather stale and there is only so many people you can text or pretend to check time. \u00a0jk jk  The burgers finally came out and by that time, I was too famished to really enjoy the burger. \u00a0This burger, similar to the Old Ship, is more of a bar burger. \u00a0There is nothing gourmet about it. \u00a0It drips grease and the bun becomes soaked quickly. \u00a0I prefer my buns toasted. The patty was large but devoid of any robust flavour. \u00a0I found the picca de gallo to be underwhelming...the salsa wasn't distinct. \u00a0There was a minimal amount of seasoning...again..this is just your salt and peppered'd hamburger patty. \u00a0This is not your 7x7 Top Burgers that cost $15-20. \u00a0The fries were your traditional American salted fries..soggy but with ketchup and ranch, the perfect complement to a meal. \u00a0The bacon was thick and bountiful and the bottom line was that it was food for the soul, good to coat the lining of your stomach for an impending le twist adventure. \u00a0You will come to Grumpy's leaving without its namesake emotion. \u00a0The burgers are old fashioned and simple and takes me to a childhood when I did not know of finer things in life such as brie, fried egg, goat cheese condiments. \u00a0Sometimes it is better that one does not know. \u00a0They also have a $7 special during happy hour consisting of a shot of jamison and a brewski. \u00a0Drinks to the most delectable cutlet at the bar...wadDUUP.",

After returning for a second time, I can yelp with complete confidence it is indeed a great spot. Plenty of beef-turkey-chicken options, super friendly/quick service, and fries or a salad on the side. My turkey burger was delicious, no wheat bun, but I appreciated being offered wheat toast instead (yes!), and the side salad was bigger than expected. Everything felt very reasonable for $9.  Only the lack of a distinctive bonus - house veggie burger, grilled onions, etc - prevents a clean sweep of stars. But it's a solid four, and one of the better financial district burger spots.",

The owner was hosting a private party with 7 people in the back of the restaurant and had the only server and bus boy completely focused on him and his group. That left the poor bartender, who was super nice and was doing his best to get us square away, to serve our party of 6 plus the few other couples that wandered in. We weren't more than 5 feet from the bar, but it meant that every time we wanted to order a drink or order \u00a0appetizers that we had to go up to the bar and put in the order. After the first 30 minutes, the bartender then came out and took our dinner order (to be honest, it was when he realized that no one else was going to do it who should have been taking care of us and took it upon himself to fix it).   When I have to watch someone polish wine glasses and set a table with candles and a white table cloth while waiting 15 minutes for someone to come over and ask if we want a drink \u00a0- there's something wrong. Oh and did I mention that we even started to bus our own table? Meanwhile, there were custom made plates of off-menu items being rolled out to his private party.  I hope that the owner reads this - and DO NOT take it out on your bartender, not his fault and he was flawless with us. Close down your place if you're hosting a private dinner party or go take them out to somewhere else where it doesn't disrupt your business.",

I had lunch here with a coworker at around 12:45 on Tuesday and it was pretty busy. There are quite a few tables for a small place and a few tables outside. The street is pretty quiet, but noisy enough to enjoy the bustle of outdoor seating.   They serve the typical pub grub bites, but they focus on burgers. They probably have over ten combinations to choose from and give you the option of beef, turkey, or veggie patty. I ordered the Cafe Style Burger with avocado and sprouts with a side salad. I was surprised to see they served a legit side salad with carrots, tomatoes, cucumber, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, black olives, and wait for it...a slice of hard boiled egg. That side salad could have been a meal on its own. Other than salad, you could choose fries, onion rings, or if you're like the lady who sat next to me, mozzarella sticks with your sandwich. All of this food for under $10. It's a pretty good deal. The ingredients could have been a bit fresher, but other than that, no complaints.   They also have a really decent selection of draft beers. No Budweiser or Coors Light here, at least not on tap. They serve Mirror Pond, Stella, Anchor Steam, Firestone, Dos Equis, Hefeweizen, and some others for only $5.

Five minutes....ten minutes...finally I grab someone to find out what's going on. They tell me the burger is being made.  It's 12:20, more than 40 minutes after placing the order that I get my food.

Last time I was here I tried the Super. After seeing my friends enjoy their burgers with a fried egg on it at the New Zealander I decided to go with the Super at Grumpy's because it comes with a fried egg, cheddar cheese, and my favorite condiment...bacon.  The burger was perfectly cooked and juicy as usual. The egg added an extra richness to the burger...it has a soft yoke so it ran everywhere. The bacon added a crispy crunch and bacon flavor.  The fries are pretty good too. Crisp but not over cooked.   The bartenders and wait staff have always been friendly and they do have some good beers on Tap, Anchor Steam yum.  The sad part is I don't get here enough.",

They cooked a fresh piece of salmon for the third attempt, but this too came out raw in the middle. Come on, now. Salmon, like most fish, cooks quickly. I was too tired to try again, and it had been over an hour, so the waitress just took it off my bill. That was nice of her, but I won't be going back.",

    "review_text": "Well, I'm old school at this place, been going here since 1982, in fact before it was named Grumpy's. \u00a0For the old timers, they'll remember it as McGovern's.  This place is a classic and since I've been going there, the place has seen the rise of the TV stations grow around it (KPIX, KGO &amp; KNTV), to the sprouting of numerous radio stations and of course the arrival and demise of various ad agencies around it. \u00a0Then it's seen the ol' 480 freeway demolished after the quake of '89 and following that the dot com boom and the ensuing bust and here we go again, another rally with the hi-tech industry, hence Web 2.0. \u00a0That's a brief history surrounding Grumpy's, now you're up to speed.  But what's consistent about Grumpy's (I'm not a lunch crowd type there, but a frequent after-work crowd...huge dif), is how their bartenders (several over the years) somehow always attain a true and sincere measure of grumpiness. \u00a0After they've been working there awhile, they all turn out like Jack Nicholson in the Shining, \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\"  In the end, it is a neighborhood bar that happens to be in the Barbary Coast business section at the edge of the stuffy Financial District at the foot of Telegraph Hill. \u00a0There aren't too many suits, but they're welcome anyway for a drink or so.  Meanwhile, whole tribes from several neighboring companies come to unwind after work, wax poetic about their day's toils and even mingle with members of the other tribes. \u00a0It is a friendly bar, not because of the bartenders, but because of the patrons.  So if you come, brace yourself for an unfriendly service, but be entertained by the shenanigans of the natives...most likely to be seen after 5 pm.  Update as of December 2008. \u00a0They have a cool new bartender, Sean. \u00a0So, Sean, we're waiting for the day your turn ahem, Grumpy.",

Two co-workers and I walked down to Grumpy's over a Friday lunch break to grab a burger and a beer. \u00a0We had heard that their burgers were awesome, and wanted to give it a shot since it was in walking distance from our office. \u00a0We assumed we could get in &amp; out of there in an hour to an hour and 15 minutes, but man were we wrong! \u00a0We were seated and given abundant time to review the menu before our waiter finally came over to take our orders. \u00a0I ordered a western burger, while my two buddies ordered the same burger...only one with no mayo and fries....the other as-is with potato salad. \u00a0We also got a beer-a-piece. \u00a0About 30 minutes and a pint later, it dawns on us that 1) our food has not arrived, and 2) the two tables that were seated 10 minutes after us were at least 8 bites into their lunches. \u00a0After one friend mutters the token, \"What...are they killin' the cow back there?\" the bus boy comes by to ask us if we need a refresher on our brewskies. \u00a0We collectively agreed, \"We've got no food to cram in our mouths, so bring us another round, bus boy!\" \u00a0(side note: our waiter was not seen for these 30 minutes) \u00a0Just as the bus boy brings us our 2 beers (side note: we ordered 3!!), we noticed our waiter crawled out of the black hole he fell in and was bringing out our food. \u00a0(side note: 40 minutes had passed from the time we ordered) \u00a0The orders were screwed up...everything had mayo on it and one guy got the other's potato salad...it was a mess. \u00a0Once the mayo mistake was brought to the attention of the our re-established waiter, he opted to go back to the kitchen and bring out a plain bun to my buddy and had him take care of it himself. \u00a0Nice work.  After all of this, we were pretty torqued, but were happy with the results of the burgers. \u00a0They were tasty. \u00a0(side note: 1 hr. and 15 min. had passed from ordering to finishing the food) \u00a0Since our waiter was paying no attention to us, we had to flag him down like a airport runway worker just to get our check. \u00a0Then...surprise!! ...he brought us the wrong bill. \u00a0For 3 guys consuming 3 burgers and 5 beers, he was charging us $115. \u00a0Our calm, happy-go-Friday demeanors were slipping to the dark side. \u00a0I called to him from two tables away saying, \"This is not our check.\" \u00a0He went back, brought us a check for around $50-something and said, \"Thanks for coming in today guys!!\" \u00a0Our pleasure.  We promptly paid with cash, and left him a $5 tip. \u00a0(side note: we are not cheap restaurant guests, we just tip appropriately) \u00a0We begin walking down the sidewalk, back to our office after an hour and \u00a01/2 lunch when we hear, \"Hey guys!! Was something wrong??\" \u00a0Our waiter, rigid and red-faced was chasing us down the sidewalk in search of an explanation. \u00a0Without missing a beat, we listed off all of the 7 or 8 GLARING errors that were made. \u00a0Waiter says, \"Well, OK, I just wanted to know because I've been having problems with the kitchen all day.\" \u00a0Other niceties were exchanged and I ended by saying, \"But my burger was good.\" \u00a0  When I was a waiter, I would blame stuff on the kitchen too in order to save a tip, but this was b.s. because the dude was not even around for 90% of our lunch. \u00a0There is no way it was the kitchen's fault. \u00a0The bus boy gave us better service than he did, and he even screwed up by bringing two beers for three people.  Horrible, horrible experience. \u00a0But the burger was good. \u00a0There is no way I, or my two buddies, will be going back.",

We ordered 6 different burgers + one chicken, and one sandwich suggested by the waiter (I think it was ham &amp; cheese, but I don't remember) for one of the girls (all ~$8, w/choice of: fries, potato or green salad). It took a while to get our order, after several rounds of beers &amp; sodas.  To make the story short, I'm the only one who finished my burger (I was hoongry!!). Everyone in the group agreed that it wasn't very good. They gave me a weird look because my plate was clean - and I had to keep explaining that I was hungry. The co-worker lost all credibility on choosing our next lunch spot, but her knowledge about places in which to get drunk remains unmatched (she knows the bartenders by name).  Tip for inexperienced office workers (thought it was needed, after reading some reviews): Whenever we go to lunch in a group we pool our cash together to pay the bill and tip, or one person picks up the tab and we divide it later. We don't ask for separate bills in crowded and busy places like this one. Hope this helps!",

    "review_text": "Attended a private party with about 50 people. Booze was great. But the food? Hamburgers were OK, but Grumpy's put out about 10 at a time for 50 people? Then nothing. Then some fried chicken. Each platter lasted about 5 minutes or LESS. Then nothing was put out. Steamed vegetables? Some deal. Everything put out separately, then 15 minutes until the next thing. Fried chicken was OK if you don't mind ice cold in the center. This was precooked, then thrown into hot oil. Hot on the outside, but cold on the inside. One poor bartender had to work the whole room of 50 people, including serviing booze, putting out the little food they had, and clean up tables. One guy cooking in back. 2 of staff for the whole party of 50 people That's it. No bus boys, no waiters, no service. I'll bet they save a ton of money on labor and food supplies.",

    "review_text": "For a hole in the wall the food is quite expensive! The waiters are pretty rude. We were waiting to get served for at least 20 minutes and the manager asked a waitress to serve us and she gave us a dirty look and flat out said, \"no,\" \u00a0probably because we were minorities. Overall the food is OK but not worth the price, the place is too loud, and the service sucks. Never will I come here again. I guess I know why it's called Grumpy's!",
