It has a good mix of people for the financial district. Walking down the alley to get to the restaurant kind of threw us off - we were not sure what to expect - but it is worth the trip down the alley..",

Yes, Drunky Magoo, I was there and happy birthday.  A gang of drunkees came here last night after throwing quite a few back at Azul's happy hour. It was my first time here and on the whole, I liked it. It was a charming little joint with fun photos on the wall. My fave was of Queen Elizabeth in a McDonald's outfit. It's nice to see she is a woman of the peoples.   I also liked that we came in and totally took over the place (including said bday girl noshing off of someones plate who wasn't even in our party) and nobody seemed to mind. The service was prompt and had a sense of humor about the drunken state of affairs and that is always nice when you are ripped by 9pm on a Thursday night. Ahhh, the life of yelpers.  As for the food, i have to deduct a hefty few points for the mac n cheese. Yuck! This thing tasted like what I imagine glue or paste might taste like. Bland, boring and just kinda there, which was disappointing since it looked promising. I also ordered the Reuben and it was okay, but i think the thing to order here is something like fish n chips or a banger or more traditional pub fare. Those dishes looked tasty.  Over all, it was a cool little place down an alley and usually that's where the best times are found. Just ask Hugh Grant.",

A medium sized bar with plenty of seating in the main room, a more quiet function room and alleyway seating with canopies and heaters for less welcoming weather.  The menu is traditional pub fare; Bangers and Mash, Fish &amp; Chips, Corned Beef and Cabbage, Cheesy-Chips and Curry Sauce.. a veritable feast of heart warming - although probably not good for your heart food. \u00a0I do recommend the smoked salmon and trout platter for a lighter/healthier but none the less filling option.. the Wasabi creme fresh is yum and the Zucchini soup is a win.  The bar is chock full of great beer, (both bottles and draft) and a hefty supply of whisky. My birthday treat is a 30yr Laphroaig Single.. tho it's a very high priced scotch.  On Friday nights and weekends this is a very popular hang out with financial district workers.. so expect a crush.  Saturday mornings they serve a traditional breakfast.. which when I can drag myself out of bed for is well worth it.  The Bank is renown for big parties .. ask about St.Patrick's or Bastille day for example. They also sometime will show the Football, (Soccer for the Americans).  Have to end by saying everyone who works at the bank is fantastically welcoming and friendly even at the most hectic of times. I wish more places could have such level headed and good-natured service staff.",

Probably why I felt right at home! JK :)  Loved that there were hooks everywhere to hang coats/purses/jackets/umbrellas. Drinks were surprisingly easy to get -- the bar was hoppin and the bartenders were generous with the tequila and Jameson (separate, of course). Easier to slam the shots at the bar than to try and carry them precariously over to the table through the sea of green drunks, all sopping wet from the downpour outside, to boot.

Forgive me if I'm being bias, but I enjoy Irish bars for reason that they serve Guinness on tap. I love Guinness and if they serve this delicious beverage, it's an automatic 5 stars on my list. I usually order the Black and Tan. Oh and how can I forget the BBQ wings! The service is good. There were a few times when a few friends and I arrived right when their kitchen was about to close. They were still happy to take our order. That's something to really appreciate! I've been in their shoes, and whenever customers walk right before you close shop...It's not cool. The way the server kept his composure was something I needed to take note of.  Did I already mention they have Guinness on tap?",

The restaurant/bar is tucked in one of those alleys in FiDi with outdoor seating, though it isn't as cute or nice as most of the other alley restaurants in the area. The inside smelled like a typical bar, pretty strong of alcohol, which is unpleasant for a normal lunch, but there's plenty of seating outside.  I came with a large group of coworkers and sat \u00a0outside. My coworkers recommended a lot of items on the menu, including the fish and chips and shepherds pie, but I didn't want anything hearty or heavy so I went with the GRILLED CHICKEN SALAD, no bleu cheese because I don't like cheese and dressing on the side.   I know you're thinking..who comes to an Irish restaurant and gets salad..?? I was pleasantly surprised though. Chicken was lightly seasoned and everything was fresh. I always love salads that have some fruit in it for a little something sweet and this one had pear! Also candied walnuts. Good size and a healthy alternative if you don't want the typical Irish food. A little pricey though at $11 compared to other items on the menu.  I also had some of the fries that came with my coworker's fish and chips. They were just okay. Thick cut so they were soft fries, but not crisp/crunchy on the outside the way I like my thick fries.  The only thing I found inconvenient was that they only take 2 credit cards per table. We had 15-20 people and not everyone had cash, but the waitress was nice and let us put in 3 cards since we were such a big group :)",

I strolled down Bush trying to find this place, totally not paying attention to the signage that clearly marked it's location. \u00a0  I parked myself at the bar and asked the sweet bartender, Mary, if she could flip one of two TVs to the Sharks game. \u00a0\"I suppose I could,\" she responded in her delicate Irish accented voice. \u00a0She served me up a Manger's, even though I ordered a Boddington's, and I patiently waited through the replay of the previous night's match between the Devils and the Rangers and watching Liverpool come back from a 2 goal deficit, and downed the Manger's and ordered a Boddington's.  The Sharks and the Bruins faced off in what turned out to be a fast-paced, yet bruising game. \u00a0Several pints later, the Sharks came out victorious 5 to 2. \u00a0I was the only one really following the Sharks game, but as I view it, everyone else missed out. \u00a0  I actually saw an acquaintance there and had a beer and a chat with him before I had to scurry off to dinner with the family.  Good bar. \u00a0If i'm ever in the area again, I'll be sure to have a pint or two here.",

When I have a vision, I have to have it!   I was meeting my friend for lunch at the Irish Bank and I was late, so I ordered my dream dish, as it was not on the menu. As it was not on the menu, I was not as specific as I should have been. I did not tell them to fry the bacon, so it was crispy as I wanted. I am not faulting them, but this is a lesson that if you have a vision, be sure to clearly explain what you want.  Don't go to the Irish Bank if you are on a diet! This is a place for fish and chips, BLT's, Macaroni and Cheese, and french fries! The food is good and fried, just how I crave sometimes.  The atmosphere is very homey! Where a sweater, comfortable shoes, and relax at the Irish Bank. You don't need a reservation and there usually isn't a wait, unless it is an Irish Holiday or a Street Festival.",

The child has life-threatening food allergies and his diet is limited. \u00a0It was particularly shocking \u00a0that the hostess made her comments directly to the child, rudely stating, \"This is a bar...you don't bring your own beer to a bar.\" After we explained the situation and that the rest of our large party would be partaking of food and drink, we were told it was \"policy\" and if they made one exception, everyone would expect to be able to do it. \u00a0I highly doubt that the zero people present in the restaurant would have noticed or cared or brought their own future sandwiches. Several of us in the group have family in the restaurant business and they would never treat potential customers in this manner, not only is it just downright mean to speak that way to a child, it is poor business. So much for holiday goodwill! I wouldn't go here again if it was the last place in San Francisco. I am still shaking my head in disbelief that you would turn away a couple hundred dollars in revenue over a stinking subway sandwich.  P.S.

Not this one.   This place has more of a German beer garden feel than Irish pub feel as a good majority of their seating is at large tables outside. This should be encouraging since my experience in German beer gardens is, also, centered around heavy drinking and raucous behavior. Nope, not here.  Here you can only heavily drink if you can afford to because a Guinness will run you $6 (there are no happy hour specials), and the raucous behavior consists of, wait for it......... standing on the sidewalk that lines the backside of the tables. They have a team out back who will yell at you should you stand on the sidewalk, so don't get too wild and crazy!!   The food is pretty bland and on the pricey side for pub grub. I guess they have to recoup the cost of hiring all of the gatekeepers out back, though I think they ought to reallocate some of the funds to a few more servers because finding one to order food or a drink is near impossible.   In short, this is your typical FiDi watering hole. Overpriced and unforgiving to people who actually want to drink and don't have six figure incomes.",

Pros of the Irish Bank:  * Outdoor seating. You have to walk down an alley to get to the entrance of the pub. And they have filled the alley with benches and heat lamps. It's the perfect way to drink and enjoy the outside even as it gets late into the night.  * \u00a0Indoor seating means you get exposed to the old, rustic dark wood that makes up the tables, the chairs, the walls, and the counter at the bar. * They carry Guinness and Harp - two staples. \u00a0No Murphys unfortunately.  * This might not mean something to all of you - but the space reminds me of Becketts (a Berkeley Irish pub that sadly closed a year ago). \u00a0With a Guinness in hand, the beer memorabilia, and old wood paneling, I feel at home just like I did at Becketts.   So-Sos: * Fish chips were good - not amazing, but still satisfying.  * Also, ordered the vegetarian quesadilla, which was okay (I probably wouldn't order it again). Though this one could be entirely my fault...who said the Irish were known for their veggie quesadillas?   I would be down to go back for a couple drinks. \u00a0It's an Irish Pub after all...that is to say, it had me at Irish. \u00a0In the terms of the food, I wasn't in love, but would definitely give the menu another shot.",

This pub is as close as I have been to being in an authentic Irish pub in San Francisco. Dark wood, brick walls, leather chairs, wood chairs and history all over the walls. The fellas pouring me Guinness were Irish too! Love....  I have sampled Guinness all over the world, the best place to have it of course is in Dublin. If you can't swing a flight on Aer Lingus, head to the Irish Bank for a delectable pint. This is the best head I have seen in SF. Sorry Napper, the Irish Bank has taken your place. You are my local so I still have love for ya. If stout ain't your thing, try one of the MANY choices of whisky, scotch or other spirits showcased behind the bar. They are in abundance.   Though it was only a Monday night, I've been told that on occasion the pub blocks Marks Alley so bands can play for the crowd.

I love the set up of this place though and the fact that it is in an alley way is very cool.",

I've recently learned that Guinness may not be vegan. As insane as that sounds, I googled it and found out that a LOT of beers may not actually be vegan. Panicked, I decided to ignore this fact and just stop drinking Guinness. LEAVE ME ALONE! It's hard enough being me! So I have to drink whiskey here instead (because it's an Irish bar -- DUH!), which is expensive. Argh.  3. The great appeal of the Irish Bank's ambiance is sitting outside in the alley. Which is not a good idea for me times TWO because, 3a.) I've been struggling with quitting smoking for months now and, 3b.) it's downtown in the middle of lots of tall buildings and I have a death-by-earthquake/being-buried-alive fixation (see: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-smiths-san-francisco#hrid:g2nra86tXx-7riu5idsYng\">yelp.com/biz/mr-smiths-s\u2026</a>).  Something continuously brings me back to the Irish Bank, however. Perhaps it's my lovable Irish guy friend and drinking buddy, who once told me that the Irish Bank was the place to meet one of those few-and-far-between \"good\" Irish men. My buddy who is from Dublin, and has an illustrious past with drugs and alcohol, and the IRA, and such things of legend.  Hmm...  Don't ask me. Don't ask me how, or why, HE would know.

That's what I said to Capital R and (newly elite) Jason K this evening when we happened into The Irish Bank on our quest for meat and beer.   We got there around 6 and were able to grab a table in the cute back room. Matt and I had fabulous big burgers, cooked good and rare, just like I like my dead animals on buns ($9). The green salad ($2 additional w/burger) was a lovely organic spring mix, lightly dressed to perfection. Matt and (newly elite) Jason's fries were so good I ate all of them and then, in the middle of my screaming foodgasm, spilled a whole bottle of ketchup all over myself. Yes, it was that good! I suggest a full-body napkin if you intend to get as excited about the food as I did. Because if you do get that excited, and you do spill ketchup all over yourself, from your knees to your neck, you will be shit out of luck when you get to the restroom and find out they don't have paper towels and you are forced to clean your expensive clothes off with toilet paper, which leaves white paper pills all over your black cashmere sweater and gray suit pants.   Lots of beer but only a handful of wines mean you should probably come with a hankering for ale or a flexible attitude in terms of the wine menu. For three of us, the bill was about $60 with tip. That was for two burgers, a turkey club (which I also ate a lot of- thank you, newly elite Jason K), a glass of wine, and two beers. Not ridiculously cheap but a hot deal in the fidi. I'll be back. In fact, I may go back later tonight for another burger. It was really that good.",

If they give you a menu with food stains you know there's something wrong. \u00a0That's such a huge glaring error that you know their practices are poor. \u00a0Never accept a dirty menu and if you can avoid eating at the restaurant you wold be well advised to fill your tummy elsewhere. \u00a0Such was the menu I was given, a crusty red stain on the plastic of the ragged old menu screamed to me \"get out!\" \u00a0  But my girlfriend, knowing my rule, was enamored by the cheap ambiance so we remained.   The Reuben I ordered was absolutely inedible, the corned beef was cut not only \u00a0too thick, but also sliced with the grain. \u00a0Then it was either steamed or poached. It was rubbery and impossible to bite without the contents of the sandwich pulling out.. \u00a0Such preparation is absolute culinary incompetence. \u00a0I want Gordon Ramsey to yell at them for me.   My girlfriend got a fish and chips. \u00a0The fish was bland, \u00a0The fries were fine. \u00a0The slaw was little more than damp cabbage. \u00a0Nothing was seasoned.   They were quick and complient when I sent back my Kosher shoeleather. \u00a0I just said \"give me what she's having\" just to be done with it. \u00a0  But my fish and chips weren't just mediocre like my girlfriend's. \u00a0The dish was greasy, over-browned and had a slightly burned flavor. \u00a0  I've been a cook for decades. \u00a0I know exactly what it looks and tastes like when you take a cold plate of fries and fish and reheat it in the fryer. \u00a0Even tried it for myself to make a quick meal out of an extra plate that never went out. \u00a0What I believe is that they had this extra fish and chips lying around, flashed it in the fryer and put it on a plate for me, probably thinking that I would be happy it came out so fast.   I spoke to my sweet and helpful waitress. \u00a0At my behest she rushed the plate away so it would no longer offend me with its odious presence upon my table of dining. \u00a0 I gave up on eating and had a nice cigarette on the way to the car.  Since I started to write this review I've been to the restroom twice. \u00a0The churning in my gut is telling me that reheated fish and chips is a lot frelling older than I thought. \u00a0 How repulsive and dishonest, it's shameful that they were going to try and charge me 12 bucks for the shitty mess they brought to the table.   It's two hours later and I am still quite unwell. \u00a0I'll probably never eat again. \u00a0I think it's mostly the sheer amount of oil I consumed. \u00a0When you let fried breaded foods get cold they turn into sponges for more oil. \u00a0  Avoid this overpriced, disgusting little rat-hole. \u00a0Real talk from the pit of my aching gut.",

Friendly folks here, with some attitude to make it interesting. \u00a0Not \"attitude\" like your principal always chastised you for, but more like \"personality.\" \u00a0Like the waitress who gave me a sad, exasperated look and head-shake because I haven't seen Gone With the Wind, or the bartendress who gave us a good-natured hard time for ordering our second round from someone else. \u00a0She switched the TV to Wimbledon for us though.  Pints are $6, but they have Leffe Blonde and pour a pretty fair Guinness, so it's okay. \u00a0 \u00a0There is outdoor seating too for nice weather like yesterday, but there's more fun to be had inside. \u00a0Light crowd for a Friday after-work period, but it was a holiday weekend after all.",

I was at this wonderful place about 6 years ago and thought I'd found a true little hide-away spot that I could claim as my own and figured I'd come back more often. But of course, reality brings a different life. So yesterday I came into the city to enjoy one of those great Walking Tours and afterwords worked my way over to relax outside with a beer and dinner. I had checked out Yelp before I came, though, and saw Autumn W's review and thought maybe she was just ticked at them for some other reason.  The atmosphere is still wonderful and the help pleasant. But I ordered the \"World Famous Reuben\" \u00a0and well, I can safely say that I had the worst Reuben sandwich I've ever had. The \"meat\" was as tough as a bad steak and I had to chew and chew to get through the damned thing. I should have returned it but I was hungry and figured I just wouldn't come back. The fries were good but that wasn't redeeming enough. And then wouldn't you know, about 1 hour later I felt that old familiar feeling and need to find a restroom.

So many resources existed to give me options, but they were very poor about narrowing them down. I do not want every place that happens to have a television, I want a good soccer pub where I can enjoy a hearty beer and the company of many like minded fans. But no, I kept being overwhelmed with options.  I ended wandering the streets and asking the first person I bumped into wearing a soccer jersey where he was going. He pointed me to the jumbotron at the commons, which was pretty cool (even if I had to brown bag my beverage).  However, later in my wanderings I learned I made a mistake.  Odd options would come up in my search. For example, the German Cultural Institute. I understand they might show Germany games, but I don't think they would have a bar, so they were no good. Across from them was a place called \"Irish Bank\" which I assumed was actually a bank, and likewise ignored it.   That was my mistake. The Irish Bank is in fact a wonderful Irish pub, and had a good crowd for the Third Place Game. Wait service was a little slow, but overall I really dug the place and wish I could have spent more time there.  SIDE NOTE: I understand you have the habit of throwing a Bastile Party (which is already a little odd for an Irish pub), but given what France did to Ireland this year, I'm surprised they didn't cancel it.",

I waited ten minutes at the bar, staring at the bartender for any service. My friend waited, having already ordered, for her credit card, for about 15 minutes. I actually sat down and joined my group back at the table bc I believed I wasn't getting my drink.  My bf came to meet us and he got service within two minutes...hmmmm, a little suspicious lady bartender, don't ya think?   I went back after everyone had their first drink, ready for their second. I figured, why the hell not. Apparently, it's better to go behind the bar and mix your own drink, bc the one on staff that Tuesday night didn't want anything to do with the bar, or tending to anyone's attention.   After getting a drink that was weak, she practically threw my money down on the bar with a sulk on her face. Now mind you, I walked away the first time bc I didn't want to end up giving any attitude ( discipline, folks) but she apparently was at the end of her whiskey slinging rope!!!  ***  My coworker took me here for my birthday lunch this year. God bless that man. Nothing finer for an Irish girl than whiskey, potatoes and some cake on her birthday.  I love the selection, the bartendars are great and friendly, it's tucked away so no one can see you stumble in or out to your office. The food isn't that great, but it's decent bar fare. The BLT was a little dry, but the fries were good.   The Confessional is a great place to sit too.  We tend to make a lot of deposits...at the bank.",

We opted to go inside, where I was instantly transported back to my travels through Ireland and its many pubs.

A cozy bar with dark wood and dim, warm lights, walls coated in pictures and paraphernalia, Irish bartenders and a great selection of beer on tap, I pretty much never wanted to leave. The prices are average, they have TVs to watch sports (they were prepared to show all of the Euro tourney while we were there) and the menu looked great, we just happened to be drinking our dinner that night.

I happened upon the alley and was drawn in by the red lights glowing and the lively crowd of after-workers hanging out. \u00a0  The semi-communal tables set out on the alley provided a fun spot to grab a beer and enjoy the evening. \u00a0Large awnings produced a cool coziness and protection from the rain - unless you sit directly under the 6\" gap between awnings (which I did) and it begins to drizzle.  The food? \u00a0I ordered a turkey club melt...and the cheese was not melted. \u00a0It was edible, but not amazing. \u00a0Actually, it was quite forgettable and had me wishing I had wandered to North Beach for some better grub. \u00a0However, the service was very fast, friendly and efficient, so I got over the food thing quickly.  The beer? \u00a0Cold and excellent. \u00a0Added bonus - I noticed the lovely ladies from Smithwick's Ale were working the tables and handing out cool bottle openers. \u00a0I asked the waiter if he could knab one for me and he returned in a flash with one. \u00a0Bro, you scored high marks for that move - thank you!  So, here's my rating: 5 stars for the alley vibe, 2 stars for the food, 5 stars for the attentive waiter (especially since he had several tables and it was BUSY) and 3.65 stars overall.  I'd go back again...for beers.",

Staropramen is undeniably a crisp, refreshing light beer. Nothing beats the real deal from Czech Republic (best on tap!) but the bottle version is still ok at $5.50. I prefer cocktails so I ordered the Moscow Mule. It was disappointingly acidic and very weak, what a waste of $9! I gave it to my friend to not waste alcohol and got a Hendrick's and Tonic instead.   Inside can get stuffy when the bar is packed, so if it's not too chilly, grab a seat outside where the ambiance is much better.

I met up with a friend of mine here during one of those wet and gloomy SF days for an early lunch and with my new boots strapped on (second day of breaking them in) I stomped my way through puddles and around potholes to meet up with him. \u00a0Once in, it reminded me of what a true pub would be like: \u00a0dark, dark woods, benches, and mostly men were present. \u00a0I was right at home \u00a0;o)  The Irish Bank has paid many a time homage to St. Pat's day and the special evening where places are packed to the gills with people making merry in addition to the flasks hidden in their pockets. \u00a0Ah, the days of celebrating. \u00a0  Today was different, although my usual excuse of not being able to down a pint was made short when a 1/2 pint was brought around. \u00a0I normally can't drink more than 1/8 of a beer (really can't handle it) but this little thing was so cute and so good. \u00a0The perfect accompaniment to the Irish Bank Burger, at my bequest, medium rare. \u00a0This came topped with the best bread bun I've had in a while. \u00a0It was puffy, rounded and soft: the only thing ladylike about my meal. \u00a0The fries were stubby renditions of the usual steak fries, but the salty crunchiness was the perfect balance to my savory hamburger.  My friend had the stew which came with massive chunks of stewed beef and a hearty scoop of mashed potatoes. \u00a0I would have elected for that dish, if I had not already made my mind about the burger. \u00a0The fish and chips selection was volunteered, but if I ate that much fried stuff, I would have been taken out on a stretcher!  I like this place because there is nothing frilly : you come in, order your food, get your pint and carry on like a bunch of men. \u00a0Just leave your high hats at the door. \u00a0Not allowed.",

Drink prices are reasonable, they have a good selection of beers and a modest but excellent scotch selection. Not too many places carry Macallan Cask Strength.   I didn't want one of the heavier options so I ordered chicken curry, which I felt a little apprehensive about getting at an Irish place, but it was awesome. Pretty cheap, and they made it really spicy like I asked. Also it was fast, I was able to get in and out during my lunch hour with no problem. Looking forward to trying their Irish fare!",

It was a regular stop when I lived in SF, and I make a pilgrimmage whenever life takes me back to Northern CA. I actually like this Irish bar every bit as much as I like many of my fave Irish bars in Ireland. Without exception, something good happens every time I visit.  Things that make the Irish Bank cool IMO: 1. Barman Dave: quick, witty, adorable, from West Cork 2. The Confessional: if , like me, you were raised Catholic, drinking Magner's (aka Bulmer's) in a confessional feels a little naughty. Drinking Bulmer's in a confessional and making out with your date feels a lot naughty. 3. Clientele: Collars both white and blue, drinking together in perfect harmony. Consistently good looking and overwhelmingly straight. Note that I heart my gay men. But sometimes a girl likes the attention of straight boys, too. 4. A-OK on the jukebox. 5. Perfectly pulled pints. (See #1.) 6. Burgers. 7. Based upon past experience, friendly members of the SFFD will take you back to your hotel in a fire engine if you don't feel like grabbing a cab. \u00a0OK, maybe not you. Maybe just a couple of my friends and me. But then, how you get home isn't my problem.  Slainte'.",

After wandering around Embarcadero for an hour trying to find a place that was open on Sunday for lunch. Luckily Yelp on my iPhone pointed me to The Irish Bank.   I'd heard about this place, and seen it packed with people for happy hour. I typically avoid places like this as they're usually overrated, boy was I wrong.  Sat down, and almost immediately a very cheerful server asked me what I wanted to drink. A \u00a0Langunitas IPA was delivered a few minutes later and definitely hit the spot. I placed my order of fish and chips hoping for the best, but expecting a soggy mess. Not too long afterwards I was totally shocked by what was delivered. A steaming plate piled high with 2 pieces of uber crispy fish, and a mound of perfectly cooked fries. With malt vinegar on the table, I was ready to dig in. The fish was fresh and thick...almost too thick for my taste...but it was delicious. I was a bit worried about my stomach handling all of the food, but I couldn't stop eating. By far the best fish and chips i've had outside of London (the Pheasant outside Heathrow is still my all time favorite).  The server was very attentive, and the atmosphere was great. I still think happy hour / dinner might be a bit overwhelming but I might have to brave it next time I have a craving for F&amp;C.",

Well, after several months I finally made it today with a buddy of mine.  I must say, the ambiance does carry that appeal that comes with being located in an alley - not typically easy to get to - but thats as far as it goes. The beers were overpriced, service was so-so, but here is what ruined it for me....the food.  First, the mac n cheese was nothing special at all - tasted like it was massed produced for some elementary school. I honestly would rather have Kraft mnc at home - really much better.  Second, hoping the mnc was just a fluke, we ordered sandwiches...I had the reuben he had the cheesesteak. These were possibly the worst either of us have had...it's what I would have expected in a diner/cafe in the middle of nowhere. The corned beef was cheap, processed meat that looked like it was slid straight out of a prepackaged bag. I have never seen a cheese steak that used steak that was not thinly sliced meat, but rather cut up strips from a leftover steak that didn't get eaten the night before.   Also, the people next to us didn't seem to care too much for their meal from what we could over hear - one of them had the shepards pie and it was about the size of 2 pudding cups...very small.  The fries were ok -   So I called my friend and harped on her about her recommendation - she got a bit defensive and said 'well, it's been 10 years since I was there' \u00a0AH!!!!! thanks for that bit of information, something that might have been useful BEFORE we went there!  I must say if i was just going to have a beer, and I didn't care how much it cost, and I didn't care about having to try to find a parking space, and I wasn't planning on getting hungry, then I might go back. \u00a0Or not.",

Our server was a little curt but brought everything quickly and correctly.   I'm trying to reserve 5 star reviews for places that completely floor me, and the Irish Bank seems just like any other pub, though it's one with fast attentive service and really good food. Actually, I am a little completely floored, now that I think about it.  *There were no drunken brawls. I'm willing to overlook this.",

    "review_text": "Sorry to say I wasn't too impressed with this place.   BF and I came here on his birthday (we didn't let anyone know it was his b-day, and I doubt it would've mattered). It was around 6:45 on a Monday, but it was strangely full, especially in the bar and the front patio.   The bar was insanely loud. Like, rock concert loud or gaggle of tween girls at the mall to see Hannah Montana loud. I was grateful we got to move to the dining room area of the restaurant, because it was a bit quieter.   However, there was only one table available and it was used as the servers prep-work station, so we had to have a large bin of silverware removed otherwise there were no other options (the patio area was packed).  Our server was really uninterested in our table and towards the end flat out ignored us. My BF had to literally wave him down, but the crowd had thinned out and we weren't hard to miss, having to sit right next to the only entrance to the kitchen and all. I was told he had an offensive odor, but I didn't smell anything, so take that as you will.   My food was rather disappointing. I ordered fish and chips, which I assumed would be great coming from a pub. I've never had a bad order of fish and chips from a pub. Until now.   My fish was breaded and fried maybe hours beforehand. The batter was soft and gross, the fish bland but fresh at least. However, the nasty breading totally turned me off to eating it. I left most of my plate uneaten. I would've asked for something different or ordered dessert if my server had checked on us even once, but that wasn't the case. My fries were boring, and slightly soft/undercooked as well, although much more edible than said fish. BF ate his meal and said there wasn't a problem, but he didn't seem to be very enthusiastic over it, either (bangers and mash). When he tried my fish he agreed that it didn't taste right.  The restaurant itself is clean and well decorated. The food and service was lacking and I don't know if I would hurry back if they can't bother to get fish and chips right. Maybe this is just a place to come and a pint.",

The venue itself is divided in half, with the bar occupying the initial half of the venue, and the restaurant, the latter half. Coming here for a birthday party this past Saturday, the bar was bustling, but not crowded, which I suspect was mostly due to the holidays.  They have a decent selection of liquor and beer on tap, but don't expect \"klassier\" liquor like 151 to be on hand. And while they have a number of specialty cocktails, including nightly specials, that are made fairly stiff, don't expect the quality and craftsmanship you'd get at a place like Rickhouse or Zero Zero.  Prices aren't bad either, with most cocktails running around the $8 price point, and service, while more \"all-business\", is not unfriendly either.  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - So, contrary to the business details as of this writing, The Irish Bank is NOT wheelchair accessible, as there are a good 3-5 steps to traverse at the entrance, without any alternative way to get inside the venue. That said, the bouncer was kind enough to help lift me up, with the help of another friend at the party. Once inside, expect the usual accessibility challenges of a bar, with high bar counters, crowds, and small spaces. That said, their tables are all at normal height, so be quick to snag one if you need it.  Bathroom - Didn't check them out, so I can't comment.",

If you've had a few drinks, you might believe that history. If you've managed to have a few drinks at the Irish Bank, please tell me your secret! Our waitress was as elusive as a leprechaun. Everything took painfully long to arrive. And it wasn't one of those deals where they were intentionally slowing the food service so you'd order more drinks. Or if they were, they were failing to cash in on the set-up. We'd have gone for it. The flesh was willing but the spirits were unavailable.  I came for the BLT I read about on Yelp. The quality of the ingredients was good. But, while I thought that I'd like having the mayo automatically on the side, the end result was a dry sandwich. Applying mayonnaise at the table wasn't the same because it didn't give the ingredients a chance to mesh.  Boyfriend had the turkey melt. He also felt that while the individual components were good, the end result was only so-so. He suffered serious diner's remorse when he saw the great looking fish and chips ordered by the next table. I initially promised him we'd return to have it, but by the end of the meal we both knew that was unlikely to happen.  The nail in the coffin was the dessert- the caramel apple torte. The cake-like shell that held the apples and caramel sauce had fridge funk. You know how you can smell it in your mouth just as you take a bite of something? It's disgusting. But while I pretend to be discriminating, I'm actually indiscriminate and I ate almost the whole thing.  Shout out to the busboys! Busboys always show me love, God bless them.

Would have stuck to a solid 4 stars but the waitress was kinda bitchy and maybe it was just because it was the end of her shift but we didn't appreciate it and then the million degree interior was a bit much.  I will go back though cause I love me a good Irish bar!!! :)",

    "review_text": "Man! I Can't Wait To Go Back! My wife and I were recently in town for the Giants/A's preseason games. On our walk back to our timeshare from AT&amp;T Park we came across this lively alley known as Mark Ln. Hungry from our long walk back we decided to stop in and grab a bite to eat. Unfortunately, upon arrival, Tom, the former Army soldier now Asian bouncer (well he's always been Asian from what I can tell but now a bouncer. This normally wouldn't matter but tonight it did) told us that the kitchen was closed. Bummer! However, he told us that if he were off he'd go to this place down the street called Sauce. So we took his suggestion and headed that way. We were so pleased with our experience at Sauce that we made a point to stop back by and thank Tom for his awesome suggestion. He was happy to hear we liked it and invited us in for a nightcap.  While I am originally from the Bay Area, my wife is a native of Las Vegas and was totally amazed at how everyone in the bar interacted with one-another and acted as if everyone had known each other for years. She said, \"you'd never see this kind of interaction in Vegas\". I simply replied, \"welcome to San Francisco!\" Immediately, the bartender \u00a0served our drinks, who seemed to be rather a happy chap who spoke with a charming Irish accent. You knew it wasn't faked either for ambiance. While at the bar we met a young Swede in town for an electronic gaming programmers convention. The conversation with this guy was extremely fascinating. I was shocked to hear how clean he and his coworkers found the streets to be in America. I figured Europeans would laugh at the state of our streets. I guess everything you hear about Europe being better isn't always true. Our conversation with the swede rolled into a conversation with two Irish brothers who were reunited this day after eight years. One brother has lived in SF for the last ten years, and this was the brother from Ireland's first trip to the States. The Irish brother attended his first baseball game. He didn't understand a thing about the sport but declared it was now his favorite. He was mesmerized by the game and atmosphere. We had to explain to him AT&amp;T Park and Giants fans were a rare bread. He was even more shocked that getting to first base, second base, third base, and home originated in baseball. He'd always thought it was solely in reference to how far you got with a girl. Utterly hilarious! Witnessing these two reminiscing along with the bartender about their homeland provided our entertainment for the next two hours (we learned that the one brother living in SF was known at the bar as DJ Pat who spins at the Irish Bank for special occasions). What was even more comical was the fact that they were drinking Corona after Corona because they had spent the entire day drinking Guinness and needed to \"flush their system\".  So it's places like the Irish Bank where you can meet an Asian bouncer named Tom who is a U.S. Army veteran, A Swede who found it remarkable how clean our streets were, and Irish men drunk off their butts praising their love for baseball. \"Just another night at The Bank\", we were told. In the words of a famous Austrian weightlifter/ actor turned governor, \"I'll be back!\"",

If you sit outside, it's basically in a little side alley that's been converted into an outdoor room. The heat lamps are good so I'd recommend sitting outside. The decor is all vintagey Irish stuff, and at night it's like a special oasis, completely apart from the ultra commercial shopping area that it's in. The beer selection was good, the server was attentive, and the atmosphere was great!  Food was good, not amazing, but good and reasonably priced.

It's the kind of burger you would find at the concession stand of a zoo. Or if movie theaters served burgers, this is how it would taste. The fries also tasted pretty blah.   To put it into perspective, I haven't eaten a McDonald's burger in 8 years. But if I had a choice between the Irish Bank Burger and a Big Mac, I would choose the Big Mac.   On the plus side, I love the outdoor seating area here, and the fish and chips that other people were ordering looked delicious. I'm just saying, if you love burgers, avoid the ones here.

They have some classic Irish dishes like corned beef and cabbage, Irish beef stew and Sheppard's pie. Of course, they also have a great selection of beer.  The inside of the bar definitely feels like an Irish pub, even the bartenders are Irish (accents and all), but I prefer sitting outside in the alley. It's great for groups.  If you are in SF on St Pats, this is THE PLACE to be! They close off the entire alley and have a huge street party. Live music, DJs, tons of Irish beer and tons of people!",

I went to get three drinks, one for myself, my friend, and the birthday boy. It was kind of hard to get one of the three? bartender's attention because they were rushing around pouring drinks. The people in the immediate area helped me. =] I ordered a Wagner's, a shot of vodka, and a white Russian. The total came out to be 19 dollars. I was surprised. I gave a twenty.   I would have given them 4 stars but the bartender messed up my order. Instead of giving me a shot of vodka, I got a shot of tequila. And I did not get a straw to mix my white Russian.   Around 11, more people started to leave so we were about to obtain a table and seats. Later I got a sex on the beach. I didn't like it.   The atmosphere was really lively. I liked it.

Spent the rest of the day chillen in the alley and starting random convos with hot young professional guys.

My manager and staff said they had ever come across such a rude and ignorant group of people - and you can put that on yelp too. Your business is not welcome here! So we are in ageement!\"  Very mature response received by the OWNER of the restaurant. This is undoctored email that is a testament to The Irish Bank's inability to accept responsibility for their actions and also their lack of maturity. Instead of trying to make amends and apologize, they resort to ad hominem attacks - because they know they're wrong.   Yelpers, please keep this in mind when you decide which establishment to give your money to!  ~~~~  We organized a large reddit meetup here, and our experience was not pleasant.   Management nagged us continually through the night, complaining about our under-21 guests, even though we had cleared it with them beforehand.  They also complained that we were taking up too many tables - all of us were buying drinks and food; this is the first time I've heard management complain about CUSTOMERS.  Speaking of buying drinks and food, waitresses did not come around nearly as much for a large group. There would be half-hour intervals when no one would come by to service us. When they did service us, they were not very friendly.  There was also a portly waiter who kept on giving my 2 friends and I the stink eye. We were standing up, but not in his way at all. Instead of saying anything, he just remained passive-aggressive the whole night.   Perhaps the worst part about our group experience at The Irish Bank was their Enron-style accounting. We had no idea what was happening with the tab - and neither did they. In the end, after many of us folks left (and paid!), the final tab arrived, and it \u00a0appeared that we owed around $130 more than we thought we owed! To be honest, we have no idea what happened, a $130 excess is crazy. I'm not saying anything about The Irish Bank's honesty, but I will say that they offered us poor explanation for it and did not cooperate as well as we thought they would.  On the flipside, the Bank Martini was tasty, and the Reuben sandwich was all right, but nothing \"Famous\" like the menu suggests.  This place does have a 4 star average review, so it might be a totally different experience if you're coming here with one or two friends, but I can only speak about my experience. I would not come here again or recommend this place for any large groups.   tl;dr - Overpriced drinks, poor service, rude management - no thanks!",

There was a patron who was BLASTED drunk and kept stumbling on stools, people and slurred out his drink order. \u00a0I was afraid he'd knock someone off a bar stool. \u00a0They ACTUALLY SERVED him more alcohol! \u00a0TWO drinks later, he fell off his bar stool and they SERVED him ANOTHER drink. \u00a0At 1:30 last call was yelled and by 1:50a, folks still wanted drinks and were served. \u00a0  If you want a dirty place that has staff more concerned w/ making extra tip $ than keeping a safe bar, Irish Bank is your place!",

In Woodlawn, you could shop the main street and never know that you were in the U.S.: - The grocery store was fully stocked with Irish and some English products - The shopkeepers' Irish accents were often almost too thick for my ears to splice through to recognize the English - The sidewalks were filled with people who looked like doppelgangers of my uncles in Maine, my great aunts in Boston, and the distant relations who sent my family a Christmas card from Galway every year - The most popular place to eat was The Snug which served dishes like shepherd's pie and beef stew, and for breakfast, fried eggs with Irish bacon. And beer. Lots and lots of beer. \u00a0You could spend all day there, if you were so inclined.  The Irish Bank is quite possibly The Snug's twin sister who took a train out West and is now living the high life in San Francisco's Financial District. \u00a0While she's hobnobbing with lawyers and bankers and management consultants, deep down, she's still just an Irish gal from the Bronx.  The dark wood and worn wooden furniture is the same (albeit a bit cleaner). \u00a0The creaky wood floors make the same sound. \u00a0The moderately friendly (but not disingenuously or effusively so) bartenders pour a good pint. \u00a0The waitstaff is attentive and occasionally chatty, but more often than not, straight business. \u00a0It can sometimes take what seems like FOREVER to get your food. \u00a0The condiment bottles are a teeny bit greasy/grimy but not gross - just used FREQUENTLY. The prices are reasonable and the portions are hearty. \u00a0The shepherd's pie is perhaps IDENTICAL in look, flavor and smell. \u00a0I think they even use the EXACT same dish to serve it in.  I'm sure Woodlawn has changed since the days when I'd study at a little table in The Snug, sipping a pint and eating shepherd's pie while the waitress asked me about how my classes were going. \u00a0Not only, as the saying goes, can you not go home again, but you also can't go back to your favorite haunts and not expect them to have evolved. \u00a0At the Irish Bank, I can at least descend back in time - for a little while.",

They did have a nice little alley way to sit outside in and there were plenty of people there to give it a busy feel.

    "review_text": "I really would like to give the Irish Bank more than three stars, but they automatically lost a star for service and then another for an abysmal draught beer selection. My boyfriend and I came here for a late night drink and decided to get a scotch. They had quite an impressive scotch selection (as well as whiskey and bourbon) and we had trouble narrowing down which one we wanted to have. I settled for a Balvenie 12 Year and my better half went for the Glenfiddich. We both were happy with our selections and slowly sipped on them while we took in the bar around us. It seemed to be mostly tourists, which made sense given it was a Sunday night and there are more than a handful of hotels within walking distance.  If you're looking for an Irish beer, they had a few on draught, but their American craft selections were pretty terrible, ranging from Shock Top to Lagunitas IPA (I love this beer, don't get me wrong, but it was the ONLY beer I'd drink there). By California being such a brewery laden state, I would have expected a bit more than their 8-10 beer offerings.  Lastly, the bartender was pretty indifferent towards us, barely acknowledging us and seemed to be put out by us asking for the scotch list. He didn't ask us if we wanted another drink after we finished, and took forever to get our bill. This was ridiculous considering we were one of three parties at the bar and the restaurant was pretty dead overall.  Regardless, if you're close and looking for a drink or two, The Irish Bank will do the job.",

    "review_text": "Let me preface this review by a few things. I have been going to the Irish Bank since 2000 (that's ten years). While I was working in San Francisco (from 2000-2006) I went there to eat no less than once a week. So I very familiar with the place as well as the people who work there. I am also aware that since I have been going there, there has been an ownership change. I can say before my last visit I would give this place 4-5 stars easy.  So I am back in the States for a while and went to watch the England/USA World Cup match at AT&amp;T Park on Saturday (12/6/10). After the match we decided to head over to the Irish Bank for a quick lunch. (We were a few home sick Brits looking for a place that we know in the past has always helped squash some of the homesickness.)   (I had not been there since 2009 but its always been a known entity so I was expecting a great experience.). The first thing I noticed was that the wait staff just flat out ignored us, so we sat ourselves down. (Before the wait staff had always been super friendly and VERY welcoming). \u00a0We got ourselves a menu and a waitress came up and asked us for our drinks order.   The next thing I noticed was that the menu had been greatly expanded which seemed great to me at the time. There were more vegetarian options and more hip selections than there had been in the past. The Irish Bank for many years has been known for its fish and chips, It even won a award once as \"best in SF\" and I had ordered then many times in the past, so I ordered them this time. \u00a0  At this point I was still a little disappointed in the way the staff treated us but after half a pint of so I was feeling better. My friend and I were sitting there deep in conversation and I think sometime during that someone from the kitchen brought out my fish and chips. We were so busy talking we didn't notice him. He must have been annoyed because he basically shoved the plate in my face and said \"here!\" and marched off. (He was rather unkempt and had a really unprofessional bushy beard as well.)  I was really annoyed at his behaviour but I again let it go. But then I looked at my plate. The fish and chips were totally different than what I had had before. The fish used to be in a very nice, flaked batter, very similar to what you get in Great Britain. The fish in front of me was in some type of hard, dark brown cocoon that looked more like something you would get from the store. The actual fish was tough and rubbery and had a batter to fish ration of like four to one. It was really horrible. I was so disappointed. And the chips? They were so dark from being cooked in dirty grease they were as brown as leather! And so gross!   Also, I should add almost the whole time we were there our waitress disappeared for most of our experience. \u00a0   I just am still gob-smacked. What the hell happened to this place? It used to be my favourite place to eat at in all of the Bay Area. I can tell you this woman will NOT being going back.   It's not just how bad everything was, it's has far it's fallen. So sad...  .",

Otherwise, if you're looking for comfort food, look no further. The Irish Bank offers a well-rounded menu of comfort ranging from fried Fish &amp; Chips to Banger Sausages with buttery mashers, Shepard's Pie, and old school Reuben sandwiches on Rye.   The servers are friendly, and should you want to find them outside the bar, some of them play in the band Cannons &amp; Clouds - great stuff.  All in all, thank you Irish Bank for making me a fan.

The food was pretty good, with special props to the chicken nachos and the blue cheese fries, and everything was going OK. about a half hour later they informed us the outside was closing. It was almost 11 and we understood. The inside was packed to the gills and we were all pooped, having just done all the wedding stuff, so we decided it was time to go to our respective sleeping rooms.   So we asked for our check, and she tells us there are too many people to split the check. WHAT!? We've been here how long and you're deciding to tell us this now? Where was this information when we started ordering? Then you had the testicles to charge automatic gratuity. Personally I wouldn't have tipped. I'd had enough of piss poor service.

The fish and chips was bland, the fries soggy, the so-called sauce was little more than mayonnaise in a plastic container. My friend ordered the prawns. They too were bland; the accompanying salad was drenched in a bland dressing that pooled at the bottom of the platter. The vegetables were undercooked - the \"chef\" didn't even bother to blanch the carrots and broccoli, nor even salt them.  Ok. Now the positive notes, of which there are few. The location is superb, just off the beaten path of Union Square. The outside tables in the ally way are comfortable and welcoming. But that's it.

This is actually my brothers go-to spot after work or if he's meeting people up around town because at least if he gets here early he can get started on a drink.  They have a great beer and cocktail selection. I felt like being girly and going light so I got the Magners pear beer and it was good! Service is great and there's a lot of different things you can snack on so I would highly recommend venturing out to find this place.

    "review_text": "Short story: Rude, disorganized and unprofessional. \u00a0As to quote the owner \"You cannot just turn up at a restaurant and expect everything to be fine\".  Long story: Keep in mind this was a group of polite internet nerds (reddit).... \u00a0I contacted the Stephanie Perry, the owner I think, about renting out the function room. After a few emails back and fourth we agreed not to rent out the function room because it was a casual meetup and I couldn't guarantee we would hit the $1000 minimum. She said we could still use the room \u00a0but it would \u00a0not be private. However it was very clear that we expected closer to 40-50 people. We agreed to come in and grab tables as needed. I have organized a lot of meetups and have had nothing but good experiences in the past. The Thirsty Bear and \u00a0Rouge are two awesome places for groups.  The day of the event we got there and no one knew we were coming. Instead of welcoming us and apologizing the bar manager was obviously irritated.  Throughout the night the bar manager \u00a0complained we were taking up too much and when we had about 30 people, also known as paying customers, he told me not to take up any more tables. Those tables sat empty the rest of the night. There were quite a few other issues which have already been highlighted in other reviews so I will jump right to the emails Stephanie sent me.  Two days later I get an email from Stephanie asking me how it went. I ignored it.  Two people from our group posted their opinions on Yelp. This morning I got this email from Stephanie: My points are starred*  I am deeply offended by the allegations made on Yelp by name removed \u00a0and name removed - giving us one star each.  You did NOT have a reservation. You cannot just turn up at a restaurant and expect everything to be fine - you expected anywhere from 15 to 50 people - how can we, as a functioning restaurant, plan with a spread like that - that was the reason you didn't make the reservation - you couldn't guarantee your numbers. \u00a0You said \"we will just grab seats as they come up.\" You prevented us from putting our best foot forward.  *She knew we were coming, she knew the group would be large and yes, you should be able to walk into a restaurant and expect good service.  If you had made a reservation the dining room would have been cleared. \u00a0If you had made a reservation, there would have been ample staff on to accomodate you. \u00a0If you had made a reservation, my staff would have been ready for you and therefore the \"Enron style\" accounting would have been clear.  *Once again, she is confusing what reservation and paying for the private room. We informed her of a large group. We declined her offer of a private room.  It took 1.5 hours for you guys to figure out the bill, costing me staff overtime. Obviously it was not clear to everyone that there was no tab and that they actually had to pony up. *This doesn't even make sense. We were out around midnight. We never planned to skip out on a bill.  If you order 9 carbombs - that's $90 - I personally went through every drink check and food docket - not one person was overcharged. *She wasn't there and already admitted to Enron style accounting.  We are a hard working threesome. \u00a0We strive to make everyone's experience a good one - I feel we were victimized when you showed up without a reservation, and again when two of your people yelped us. \u00a0We take this very personally. *Victimized by paying customers?!?  I would really appreciate your talking to name removed \u00a0and name removed and letting them know the status quo. \u00a0This just isn't fair.  I replied back with: No one said we had a reservation, ever. The emails I sent you to inform you of a large group are below.  I organized a meetup for a website, I have forwarded your email but I can not control the opinions of others. Your wait staff was awful, rude and disorganized. This is one of many meetups we have had and we were very unhappy for the first time ever.  I don't even use yelp and didn't know what it was until you messaged me. However I did sign up and I will post your email to me as a review of the irish bank; I think it speaks for itself.  She asked me to include her reply: Perfect! I appreciate your putting my response on yelp! My manager and staff said they had ever come across such a rude and ignorant group of people - and you can put that on yelp too. Your business is not welcome here! So we are in ageement!",

Its not so often your cravings are answered. I had to answer fates knock, so we made our way into the restaurant.  It looks like your typical restaurant/pub except there is cute outdoor seating, probably nicer at night, but cute nonetheless. We wandered to the back, sat ourselves and waited for the fabulously flustered waitress to take our drink order. We could tell they were busy, and we were in no rush, so we didn't mind the 10 minute wait. After the waitress took our drink orders the service was very prompt. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because the drinks (Pint of Guiness and Pint of Pear cider) tasted a little watered down. for 3 bucks a pint, I probably wouldn't mind, but for 5-6 bucks, I expect it to taste like it just came outta the bottle, not watered down.   I ordered the Shepherd's Pie and he ordered the hamburger(typical guy food). He wolfed that thing down faster than I could finish though, that's for certain. When they brought my food I was surprised because I'm used to shepherds pie being in a long shallow plate, not the souffle looking bowl they brought. After I sunk my first spoon into the meaty potatoey delicious souffle or brule or whatever heavenly thing this pie was, I was hooked! So yummy and comforting, the dish I've needed since I moved here 6 years ago! The Mash was cooked on top just so much that it created a slight fry/cheesy crust around the edges, and I feel like the depth of the bowl locked in all the juices. I would go here again for sure!

It has got lots of photos of Ireland, Nuns and Priests on the walls, wooden floors, barrels and kegs, etc. They also have outdoor seating, which would be pretty nice when the weather's warm. I took a friend here, and it was really crowded and loud inside, so we went to go sit outside, but after just a few minutes, they started tearing down all the tables and chairs and putting them away, and told us we needed to go back inside. Bummer. Even though the pub is open until 2:00am, they close down the outdoor seating around 11pm.  It eventually calmed down inside, so we were able to hang out for a few hours at a little table, having a nice conversation and drinking Cranberry Tonics. As you approach this place, fight the urge to turn around and run for your life. You have to walk down a side alley to get here, and all your instincts will tell you that you're in a dangerous place, but don't worry. It's a lot of fun.",

It's an annual tradition (3 of the past 4 years) for me to celebrate St. Patrick's Day at the IB! They always decorate so festively with the massive green, orange, and white balloon arch at the alley entrance, and streamers and shamrocks galore. Also, all day entertainment is provided with live music and traditional dancers.  Of course, the crowd is jovial and energy is awesome, especially if you've had a few cocktails. (For me, it'd be an Irish coffee to start and then the rounds of Guinness, the bombs, etc.,)   Last year, my friend, Amy G and I woke up at the crack of dawn to head over to the Irish Bank to catch part of the Alice 97.3 live morning broadcast of the then 'Sarah and No Name' show. It was a wild and crazy morning of complete drunken chaos, but so much fun. Here is how crowded the alley gets <a href=\"http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/QkZfMbklsq8nHAtRbVfIJA/l\">static.px.yelp.com/photo\u2026</a>  and here's a pic of No Name with his samurai and ginormous stein of beer <a href=\"http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/IJF40IKQSDQP7buX3nichQ/l\">static.px.yelp.com/photo\u2026</a>   Aside from hitting up the IB for St. Patrick's Day, I've also attended many Happy Hours and birthday celebrations (including my own). Of course, the best place to be seated is outside, especially if the weather is lovely. Even if it's a bit nippy outside, well, all you need is one drink (Irish coffee, Guinness) to warm you up! If you choose to sit inbe indoors, I recommend sitting in the confessional with a few of your closest friends. This is the only bar I know of with a confessional. Once you confess your sins, they'll be absolved with a shot of Fernet or Jameson :)   BTW, the IB food is actually quite good and reasonably priced. There's a wide selection of sammies, hamburgers, salads, and other entrees like steak and \u00a0corned beef and cabbage. A few of my favorites are the cheddar cheese fries and the mac and cheese (Yes, I'm a cheesy type of gal)! I swear this mac and cheese is one of the best I've ever had! No joke! As for the fries, halfway through this year's Chinese New Year Treasure Hunt <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/chinese-new-year-treasure-hunt-san-francisco#hrid:u67xlsNqasyZLyRPjw9nQg\">yelp.com/biz/chinese-new\u2026</a> my team and I decided to make a pit stop at the IB for those tasty fries and beer. They were thick and crisp with the perfect amount of cheesy melty goodness on top (as we ordered the cheddar fries and the blue cheese fries). The plates were practically licked clean.   Service is decent here, and never had any bad experiences. Can get slow when it's super crowded. Ladies, the bathroom only has two small stalls, and allows for maybe 2 people tops to wait inside if stalls are occupied. Otherwise, you'll be waiting outside the bathroom doors, just across from the Men's room.   Of course, I'll be back at the IB! The Irish Coffee and Guinness are calling my name in the morning...\"McGilly\"...   Sl\u00e1inte!",

At this point, about 5 minutes since we entered the building, this is the only attention our table has received. \u00a0It would have probably been a more enjoyable drinking/dining experience had it remained that way. \u00a0Unfortunately for us, an unabashedly impatient, ponytailed shrew bellies up to the booth next, soon showing **discernible aggravation** at our having decided to order beverages and food together, rather than running off a list of one first, then the other. \u00a0Each subsequent visit from her to our table is like an angry nun in a reading room, rearing a whipping stick as she passes the \"misbehavers\" whose voices are raised too high for her liking. \u00a0Everyone clams up and hopes she doesn't bite one of us, then shoulders decompress as she walks away.  Looks of disbelief, confusion and hilarity are exchanged among us following each character's departure from the table. \u00a0The $6 pints are tasting more and more expensive.  It suddenly occurs to me that there is a distinct possibly that the first of the two extreme threats to this business' return customer factor **works** for the establishment, but is apparently only gracing our table with his presence, and only when the spirit moves him to wobble our way for another soliloquy in his own private language. \u00a0I personally leave my table to inform one of the uniformed, undrunk waitstaff that his double-dipso coworker by the bar should probably call a cab. \u00a0Moments later, after assuring me he'd \"take care of it,\" he's engaged in jovial, half-spanish/half drunk-ass Spanish conversation with him, which lasts for the duration of our meal.  The Irish Bank broke nearly every rule in my hospitality industry book, on top of serving utter shit for food (fresh from the freezer Ore-Ida fries and Dinty Moore Stew covered in just-add-water mashed potatoes in a re-purposed cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e dish masquerading as a \"Shepherd's Pie\") and charged us $50 to do it. \u00a0Laid back and slacking off are not synonymous. \u00a0If you were going for that sardonic, \"I don't give a fuck\" kind of aesthetic we see in Guy Ritchie movies, you missed. \u00a0Those places have character. \u00a0You're an overpriced frat trap.",

I've never been to Ireland, so how would I know? There are two sections to this place, the bar and the restaurant. When you sit in the bar half (even if it's at the seated tables) you need to order food from the bar. If you sit in the restaurant half, then a waiter will be at your service. Kinda weird but okay.   I ordered the Corned Beef &amp; Cabbage ($12.95) which comes with a side of mashed potatoes. You know they're not doing a great job when the mashed potatoes taste better than the main part of the plate. There was something off about the corned beef. Perhaps it wasn't fresh, or maybe it was the fact that the meat itself was not very flavorful. I was craving corned beef (weird craving, I know) but I was let down. The mashed potatoes were amazing though!  I also tried a little bit of the Shepherds Pie ($9.00) which tasted super beefy, but perhaps that's the way they intended it to be. Wasn't my favorite Shepherds pie in the world.   The Bloody Mary was very good, and they have a plethora of other cocktail ideas if you need help deciding what you want to drink. The bartender was cool and friendly. This seems like the kind of place where someone can easily feel comfortable as a regular customer.",

The door next to the sign is for a sushi bar 2. wheny ou walk in you walkinto a bar area. The resturant area is acccctually towards the back. 3. you order food from the bar when you sit in that first area. Outside and in the returant area serving is normal style.  Food Co got the mac and cheese, I got the sheppards pie. We were in heaven. The food came out hot and was super quick given how busy this palce was. I literally wanter to bury my face in the food. It had nothing resembling low calorie about it but my gawd were both dishes delicous.  Oh note for the ladies, delicous eye candy strewn all over the place.

Decent drinks menu that included the major pub standards (e.g., Guinness, Magners). I took a sip of my friend's pomegranate martini, which was tasty. I was a tad surprised by how much shots were, but I guess we were in the financial district (if your goal is merely to enjoy a beer and hang out with friends, however, I can think of a few other bars that charge less, albeit not as nice and maybe not as many concoction options).

He's like the best I've had so far and I agreed. :D this was at like 2:30 and I was drooling up until he picked me up at 5.  So we get there, waited in the cold for about 10 minutes before we had a waitress come show us the menus. We ordered ginger ale first and let me tell you, the one I got was totally watered down. It looked like carbonated water LOL.  Homemade Macaroni and Cheese  - it was very good. Cheesy goodness, although I think it's slightly watery compared to the standard mac n cheese that's typically thick and creamy. But it was still good.   The Bangers - it comes with Heinz baked beans and your choice of a scoop of mashed potatoes or fries. I picked mashed potatoes. YUMMY! I asked the waitress to put it under the broiler to crisp the mashed potatoes a bit. It was delish. The bangers? The best part of the dish. I love bangers, they're kind of like bratwursts but the exterior is crispy. It's so juicy.  Shepherd's Pie - ground beef mixed with vegetables and topped with mashed potatoes and put under the broiler to crisp it up. It was so good, unfortunately I don't eat beef anymore but I do recall it being extremely delicious. A MUST to try on the menu.   Chocolate Lava Cake - I've had better at Roy's Restaurant on Mission St. This lava cake looked like they just put some chocolate ganache on the plate and slapped a warm chocolate cupcake on it (which by the way, for some reason the cake was split already on the side) and served with two scoops of Vanilla ice cream in a side dish. The warm ganache wasn't even coming out from the middle it was on the bottom haha. Not even suppose to be like that.  Overall I enjoyed my dinner with my friend. I'd go back again *thumps up*",

Great selection of pub style beers, including of course guinness, harpers, boddingtons, murphys, etc. The place knows how to pour a legit pint of guinness, which according to the masters requires the \"double pour technique\", clocked in at 119.53 seconds. It makes a difference - I've had a straight pour and its a glass of foam. The bar snacks I've tried are good and I like how you can order from the bar at night - helps keep an even keel whilst imbibing your third pint.  The ambiance is typical Irish pub, but done well. There is a church confessional tucked in between the two rooms - I NEED to get that spot someday! Needless to say you must be quick because people jump on it faster than an open spot at the bar.   I love the Irish bank on weekdays, or weekends during the day. Weekends at night this place can get super crowded and the bar can't handle crowds very well. Due to the prime real estate on which the Irish bank sits (off Union square) prices per pint are around $6, so not the cheapest.

The Ugly: - Service was robotic. - I left my credit card there and called the next afternoon to ask if they had it. The bartender who answered the phone said he was the only one there and asked me to call back in 3 hours. Yes, it was my bad for leaving my card there in the first place but having worked in a bar, you know to expect people to forget things at a place where alcohol is served. If you're debating which is more important (a) confirming whether or not a customer left their credit card (which all usually get stored in one place and takes about 2 minutes), or (b) making sure that someone else gets their beer 2 minutes faster...I'd choose \"a.\"",

The outside of the building walls decorated with pictures and plaques with a single vine climbing the drain pipe. On a sunny day in SF we couldn't have asked for more. I give the atmosphere outside a 5 out of 5 on a sunny day. The outdoor ally seating, reminded me of Boston, very quaint. We had a drink, some good hearty potato skins (each skin was a half of a medium potato filled with bacon and cheese), and lightly battered, mostly rings, calamari. Friendly server, clean bathroom, can't wait to return. The bar was small so on a nice day outside is best but as it started to cool down the inside looked better.",

A second night, came with friends for dinner. \u00a0Sat in the inside dining room (outdoor seating was jam-packed). \u00a0Tasty pub grub, no complaints whatsoever with the food quality. \u00a0Our waiter, however, clearly wasn't interested in doing his job that night - after waiting a solid 20 minutes for the second round of drinks to come out, I decided to pack it in. \u00a0Which was really a shame; this really does seem like the kind of place you could hang out all night and have fun, but this waiter sort of blew it.  Everyone has a bad day though, so I'm rating based on the food, drinks, and ambience alone.  And I'll add - for some reason, I really like how the outdoor patio is basically a dingy-looking back alley. \u00a0It looks a little scary, but it really makes the place feel even more cozy and authentic.",

She was satisfied.... after all, how do you screw up bacon, lettuce, and tomato?   We sat for about 30 minutes after finishing our meal.

Other than our group, there was only 1 couple in the large room. It may be that the inside bar was also busy and the outdoor patio busy as well. A waiter came by to take orders but I was indecisive as to whether I was hungry or not so I just asked for water. Later on as the evening progressed, I started getting hungry and flagged a waiter to ask for an order of fries. I waited and waited and waited. I felt as if my group would leave soon and I wouldn't get my food, so I got up and walked towards the doorway of the kitchen. Before I got there, there was a waiter also approaching the entrance of the kitchen planning on going in. I asked, \"Is it possible to check on my order of fries?\" The waiter peeked into the kitchen and said, \"Yes, it looks like your fries are on the counter. We'll bring it to you.\" Okay, I just went back to my seat and continued my conversation. A few moments later, a man in a vest (who I presume was the manager) came over and said,\" Lady, don't go to the kitchen and ask for your food. We're really busy here,\" he waves to the large group of tables we've put together for my group,\"and we'll bring the food to you when we're ready.\" This in a very angry tone. I've never had someone (a restaurant manager) try to chew me out in front of friends in any situation. I value politeness and courtesy. These are values that I grew up with and so, for someone to do this in a setting that is \"supposed\" to be geared toward customer service it is T-O-T-A-L-L-Y unacceptable behavior. I understand the wait staff was stressed. I understand I was in a large party of 20 people - for which we were bringing business to this establishment. Unfortunately, because of this experience, I will N-O-T ever return to the Irish Bank Bar. And I will not recommend it to any of my friends or acquaintances. Ever.",

I myself had the Irish beef stew and it was fairly tasty. Service is pretty good even with it packed like crazy. Our waitress was attentive and was prompt with everything. We were being pretty long with ordering and didn't even order that much for staying that long so she was being extremely patient with us.  I like how there was outdoor seating since the inside is super small and its all under an awning so no worries if it rains. Just wear a jacket and order some whiskey.",

The corned beef was prepared as if you can pull the beef apart...so juicy and seasoned to perfection. The cabbage was steamed, easy to eat &amp; salted just right  Plus you can savor the meal in such as quaint restaurant setting...great for dates or a night out with your friends. I came by after 5PM on a Thursday and the place was filled with the happy hour crowd...you can make it lively or relaxing  Their famous Reuben sandwich is a try on my next visit",

Our bartender was awesome and the regulars were great. The food was above average for bar food. I had the macaroni and cheese and the philly cheese steak.

I had a reservation for Irish Bank for a party of 14. The bouncer(I think) up front greeted us and seemed nice. We were then ushered in by the hostess who left us in this room without any communication. After standing around awkwardly for 10 mts, we decided to seat ourselves and we moved a couple of tables together. Out comes the waiter who very rudely says \"NO NO NO\". He then moves some other tables around. I guess you have a system which I can appreciate but don't leave guests unattended without any communication and don't be so f*^&amp;ing rude.  We should have left at that point but I decided to stay since I was not sure if I could find another place for a party of this size and did not want to make a scene. The waiter said his name was Jeffy or Jezzy or something like that. Super rude guy and was very rude and curt the rest of the evening to the point where multiple folks commented on it. It ruined the evening for me. Perhaps this dude needs to switch roles with the bouncer. Actually on second thought, this dude should not be in front of customers, put him in the back.   The food sucked and they don't serve beer in pitchers. I admit my view of the drinks and food are probably biased because of the service. There are way too many options in this area to put up with this S^&amp;$. NEXT!",

He pretty much asked if I had bumped my head because I had been here before. I had to remind him that it must have been one of his other wives he has scattered around the Bay, because I had never been here. He quickly realized he used to come here and meet his mom when she worked in the city - um thanks.....  I love that this place feels like a real Irish dive - dark and dingy and full of great beer and spirits. Of course my pregnant ass was stuck drinking non-alcoholic crap while my husband enjoyed his Guiness, bastard.   Anyhow, we ordered up the fish and chips - I was honestly expecting a plate of crap. What I got was a plate of decent food. The fish was fresh and had a light batter that was not greasy. The chips were tasty and not greasy either.....good tarter to top it off with my vinegar - at least I get to enjoy food!

The decorations of the pub help to make you feel right at home, it has a rather nice cottage feeling &amp; the amount of TV's are not overwhelming.  The selection of beer is great, although it is a great shame that they have no local beers on tap. The price as well is reasonable, and the soda fountain with free refills is a nice touch. The food as well is a great selection of some local area ideas and traditional food. The Potato Skins are a must for anyone wanting a cheap main meal!  The staff are what really make this pub one of the best in San Francisco, they are fun and remember any one who goes in. They offer helpful advice and if you go by your self, like moi, you end up chatting away to them. I would recommend the staff be allowed to have a drink or two behind the bar, but each owner to his own.  A home away from home, and a must no matter what!",

    "review_text": "WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I've had in years from the waitress and the owner.   I had an open tab at the bar and so did my my coworker. We were one drink in and our blonde waitress asked if we wanted another drink. We let her know we had tabs at the bar and she kindly agreed to take our orders for a second round saying if it was only maybe two beer rounds including the one we ordered with her, we were fine.  We ordered food and were enjoying our drinks, the ambiance of being off work and being able to relax after a 11/12 hour day when a dark haired waitress came to our table to take our order. She let us know our blonde waitress was on break. She asked my coworker for her drink and my coworker let her know we had an open tab. She reluctantly took the order and then asked me if I wanted a drink. I too ordered and then let her know I also had an open tap at the bar. The waitress made a face, said \"oh no. You can order at the bar!\" And walked away abruptly.  The waitress walked away from my table. She made a face. She also refused us service for no reason.   I went into the bar, calm and collected and reasonably asked for a manager. While I waited for the manager to appear, the dark haired waitress came up to me and said I have your drink (a margarita). I let her know it wasn't my drink (I was drinking an IPA) and she said \"your friend ordered it.\" I let her know I needed to speak to her manager and told her to please go get him. She continues to try and argue with me before I told her to please leave me alone and get her manager. She ran off.   The manager came up to me and asked what was wrong. He was a tall Irish man and I was told HE WAS THE OWNER. I explain the situation and he said he had issues with the dark hair waitress before. He went off to inquire with his waitress.   All the while the waitress had gone back and given my coworker the drink she had previously tried offering me inside the bar. \u00a0She apparently profusely apologize to my table and gave my coworker the drink telling her she put it on her tab. Only 5 minutes ago she had refused service.   While I waited, I figured I would buy another beer. Why not, right? I was merely going to explain the situation to the manager. My drink arrived and the \"owner\" returned. His words were the worst. \"So your friends accepted the drink. What's your problem? Why are you complaining. You're the only one that has a problem.\"   FIRST the dude never went to our table to inquire with my coworkers. He merely spoke to his pathetic excuse for a waitress.   SECOND he basically blamed me for his bull SH!? waitress' HORRIBLE customer service.   I asked for this man's name and he replied with, \"you don't have to know that.\" My response was \"you're the owner and you're not going to stand by your bar? What's your name?\" He repeated himself. So I handed him my beer and told him I would like my money back. He got angry with me and told his bar tenders to void my open tab. I NEVER ASKED HIM TO DO SO. He them asked me to leave.   This man escalated the situation and blamed me for his horrible employees customer service who was trying to cover her ass. This \"owner\" asked me to leave and said I threw my beer at him which I did not. I merely went in to convey the HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. This man was angry. Why? Because I said I didn't want my beer anymore and wanted my card refunded for the beer after he tried giving me cash? WHAT KIND OF OWNER DOESNT GIVE HIS NAME AND DOESNT STAND BY HIS BAR?   Our company will not ever return to this bar and I'll make sure they don't. I'll spread the word to avoid stopping here after work and having other fiends stop here. This place can have their HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I'll keep my money.",

I go here about every Thursday with my mates, not because we like the food (we don't) or enjoy buying rounds that break the bank (no pun intended).

The moment I sat down, our service was nothing more than terrible. I flagged down a waitress after being ignored for a while and our interaction goes as follow:  Me: Hi, excuse me; can we order some food through you? Waitress: Yes, but I can't do split checks. Me: Ok. But can we split it two ways... Waitress: NO. That was the first thing I said. I can't split the bill. Me: Oh Sorry, I meant on two credit cards. Waitress: Yes. But I can't do it on more than two cards. And there must be a minium of \u00a0$10 dollars per card. Me: Ok. That's fine. I'll have the wings and my friends here wants some fries. Waitress: You do realize that's only 15 dollars right? You must order at least $20 dollars. Me: Ok, give me another beer.  So she storms off and disappears. My friends later meets up with us and sits down at a different table and tries to order some more food. Again, they were met with a similar situation from the same waitress with the condescending and bitchy tone. We weren't even sitting at the same table but she forced us to lump our bills together for some reason or another. She then proceeds to to get into an argument with my friend for even having the audacity for asking to split the bill again (even though she was unaware of the situation) and was firm in making sure we were all grouped together under one bill. I understand that whole multiple transaction thing can get annoying but it is never ok to speak to your customers with a short tone and make it seem like they're burdening you with the worse job in the world. It wasn't until we got our bill that I realize the waitress just wanted to tack on the mandatory gratuity to our bill since we were a big group. Good move waitress, I know you depend on tips for your salary but tips should be earned and not something you try to force onto your customers. You work in the service industry, please learn some manners and how to treat your customers with respect.  I know I should have escalated this to a manager that night instead of passive aggressively writing this review on yelp but oh well, what's done is done. I am never returning to this place again.",

Fast forward to last Saturday... \u00a0I met a group of friends at a hidden lil Irish pub that Crys B had picked out randomly from Yelp reviews and, you guessed it... it was my mysterious pub from a decade ago! \u00a0Yay!! \u00a0I can't believe I found it after all these years. \u00a0Good times and good memories...   That being said, the drinks were strong, crowd friendly and there's a room in the back that had plenty of seating with a fireplace. \u00a0  My bacardi/diet was 7$ and my friends Stella was 6$. \u00a0Don't know the rest of the pricing but that seemed fair for SF. \u00a0  The place got packed for a while but was still manageable. \u00a0 The only problem was the bathroom. \u00a0It was durrrrty when we arrived at 9:30 and already had only 1 toilet because the other way way out-of-order. \u00a0It'd be nice if they had checks through-out the night or at least before the drinking hours begin. \u00a0Ok, we'd also have liked a lil music in the backroom.   I liked the outside patio they had when we first arrived too. \u00a0It was closed later in the night though so I'm not sure what time they pull the tables in for that. \u00a0  We'll probably be back since this is a fun Irish pub with Smithwick's, Murphy's and such... and good seating options. \u00a0  See ya there!",
