    "review_text": "The one star is to be able to review this place.  I always thought businesses existed to, well, do business. Since when is the customer ever wrong? Since when is fun not allowed to be had? Especially at a bar?  I left this place highly disgusted by the treatment that we received by the one bartender on shift. Maybe she is the owner, manager, I don't know. Regardless, I have never felt so wrongly mistreated by an establishment and I am embarrassed for Sweetie's for incurring our wrath.  It was a Saturday night and there were a handful of patrons scattered around the front. We strolled to the back to wait for the rest of our party to join us, as they were looking for parking. While we were waiting, the bartender asked one of our party if we were going to order drinks or just hang around and take pictures. She guilted him into ordering a beer. It's not like we are all going to meet at a bar and not drink. I'm sorry if you are feeling impatient, but I don't see a line outside the door waiting to be served. We were planning on staying here for several hours before heading to our next venue, so clearly buying drinks was on our agenda. Is it a crime to want to wait for our friends to share the fun?  Once the rest of our party arrived, we ordered a round of drinks. During this time, the bartender insulted one of my friends by accusing her of being different than the rest of the group. Maybe she was joking, maybe she was trying to banter, but it was rude and not appreciated.   When our drinks came, we were bluntly told the price. So before we could even drink, we all had to scramble to find our cash and pay. Way to kill the vibe. Maybe she thought we were going to drink and dash, because our joyous laughter makes us seem like criminals.   As we were celebrating a birthday, there was a lot of happiness and laughter. The bartender came over and asked us to tone it down. At this point I became quite irate. We are not in school, you are not our teacher, other guests did not come to complain to us. We are trying to enjoy ourselves on a Saturday night and we get shushed. I'm sorry, is this a no-fun zone? If so you should really put a sign in the front that says \"NO FUN ALLOWED. NO LAUGHING ALLOWED.\"  The birthday girl had had a bit to drink and was feeling a bit soporific. She was resting her head against the wall for a few minutes to let her buzz subside. She was in a completely innocuous position and was simply taking a breather. The bartender noticed this after several minutes and came over and lectured us that our friend \"did not look okay\" and that we \"should probably escort her out\". I don't know how serious she was being. Maybe our fun was just too much to handle. Maybe she just wanted to roll her pizza dough in silence. Maybe she was mad that we didn't order one of the precious pizzas. Regardless, we basically got kicked out on the accusation that our friend was going to pass out in a bar. Is this a club? Are we in Vegas? Are you a bouncer?  Not that Sweeties would want us to come back, but we will never come back. We will never recommend this place to anybody and I suggest you, dear reader, to take heed and avoid Sweeties at all costs. Unless you like to drink in silence on a Saturday night and be scolded by the bartender. Oh what fun!   I am appalled that such an institution exists and has such high ratings on Yelp.",

It's a very hard to categorize place. \u00a0In town visiting and I was hanging out at a really cool neighborhood bar called The International (or something like that) after a few beers and some good conversation with some folks I asked the bartender Sonya what was her 'local' place and she told me Sweeties right down the road.   Literally 2 blocks away I walk in and there is a pool table on the left playing for free, a tiny little bar, a small jukebox on the wall which was packed with great mix of blues, soul, and rock. A \u00a0back private area and funky art (apparently all local) on the walls.    \u00a0 \u00a0 The bartender, Amy, was one of the best i had encountered anywhere and the kicker is she also makes these AMAZING individual pizza's. At first glance you think the food is incidental so you could avoid hazards with neighborhood and the ABC but no the pizza is off the chart. Right there she hand rolls out a thin crust, homemade pizza sauce and chops the fresh toppings aka mushrooms etc. In it goes 10 minutes later delicious. I was blown away with the concept. \u00a0This would be a local of mine if i lived in North Beach. The crowd was also local and eclectic. This is a NEIGHBORHOOD bar with a focus on just enjoying yourself and not being part of any particular scene.",

We were with a group post-volleyball. We were able to stake out the whole back area of the bar and sit up on the high stools to chat and hang out.  The best part again was definitely my full water glasses of wine! For $5 (pinot grigio) or $5.50 (sauvingon blanc), I think I was served about 1/2 a bottle of wine in a water glass.

So after passing by this spot for over a month, on my way to Bay Street 24-fitness, I finally decided to stop in with a friend about two weeks ago. I stopped by this bar on a Tuesday night, with a friend (girl), who had just gotten off of work. I usually restrain from from going out on a school night, but earlier that day I had received an offer letter from a company I had been interviewing with, so I wanted to celebrate. Before we could find a place to sit, the bartender yelled at us from across the room, \"Just so you know, we aren't staying open all night.\" The bartender said this in a rude tone and I was immediately turned off. I have worked in the service industry for over ten years and I would never pull a move like this. If I had wanted to be insulted by a bartender, I would have gone to Zeitgeist and tried to order a mojito! I told my friend, let's leave now, but she insisted that we stay because she knew I had been looking forward to going there for awhile. The bar had 12 people inside, and everyone had drinks, yet it took almost ten minutes for the bartender to pour us two beers.  Apparently it was more important to cater to the crusty regulars before tending to new patrons.   The spot is deceptive, in that based on the outside appearance, you're given the impression that there is a swanky lounge inside, like the Razz Room, or the Red Room (R.I.P.). Instead, you find a sub-par dive bar, with a peeling paint, a dilapidated pool table, and a bathroom straight out of Trainspotting.   Despite my protests, we stayed for a second round of beers, and left after being there for 30 minutes. In that time, non of the other patrons made a move for the door, so I still don't understand why we needed to be \"warned\" of the closing time prior to ordering drinks. As we left, I asked my friend, \"did we look like we were going to cause trouble?\" Granted, we were both dressed pretty nice (me - slacks &amp; buttoned down shirt; her -sundress) for a dive bar, but that shouldn't warrant poor service. My guess is that the bitter bartender (who was sports jeans and a hoodie...with the hoodie on the entire time, like Eminem from 8 mile) was mad that she was given the wack Tuesday night shift. My advice to is you, is try being a little more friendly and maybe Tuesday nights wont be so wack!",

The bartender (wearing an ugly knitted grandma beanie with tacky flowers on it) hushed us and told us to quiet down and then proceeded TO TELL US TO LEAVE!

You get to meet a surprising mix of people; regulars from the neighbourhood, league teams from the Tel-Hi and the school a block away, and the occasional adventurous tourist. I held a birthday party in the back room a couple of years ago and it was a great way to start an evening of hitting the bars on Broadway.  Oh and I haven't even mentioned the fantastic art, the art studio next door, or the fact that it's family owned.  UPDATE - They now charge $5/hour for the pool since they just replaced the table and the nominal fee is to prevent this one getting abused too quickly. The price is reasonable and the number of apologies the staff give you for charging anything at all is very charming too ...",

We walked in, the place is dark and not very big. \u00a0A few regulars at the bar, someone playing pool, a big buddha welcomes you. \u00a0We found 2 seats at the bar although I was eyeing the comfortable looking wing chairs near the front window. \u00a0The bartendar was friendly and got us our drinks - hubby got the IPA and I got the Anchor Steam $6. \u00a0 Mr. decided to check out the jukebox and the bartender said there's a credit and feel free to play whatever we wanted. \u00a0  The bartender also make the pizza - talented :) \u00a0Bunch of folks walked in -bartender greeted them by names, they said hello to the regulars - we thought of Cheers. \u00a0More regulars walk through and the exchange of hello and handshakes ensued. \u00a0The regulars there are really friendly and we were treated like part of them - talking about nothing, about the game and whatever. \u00a0Ian, the bartender, is super friendly and does a generous pour. \u00a0If you want wine, you'll get the best deal here since they pour in small water glass - it's a very generous pour.  One of the older gentlemen, a regular, told us Sweetie was once a restaurant where the bar was upstairs. \u00a0The space has since been reduced to the current size as a bar - they just celebrated their 6th anniversary in September.  Hubby really enjoyed himself and I know this will become a regular hangout for us.",

One of my favorite things about this North Beach treasure is the fact that most of my friends who live in the area have no idea this place even exists. It's off the beaten path and loved by true locals and bikers alike.  I came here with a crew of about 15 after sailing on the Adventure Cat for a surprise party. Amy (who, if you haven't gotten the point yet, is so totally awesome) reserved the back space for me after I called in a couple weeks prior to let her know we'd be coming in. I dropped off some food from Trader Joe's (also Amy's idea) earlier that day so we could have something to munch on after our booze cruise. She had our first round of patron shots (served with freshly cut lime wedges and a bowl of salt to pass around) ready in no time and our homemade pizza's were out an hour after that (well worth the wait).   There's a great vibe that lingers here throughout the night. It's great for large groups or for simply grabbing a beer and a game of pool with a friend without being distracted by tourists or douche bags on the prowl. There's a pretty sweet art collection in the back room that's worth checking out (though the past two times I've been the room hasn't been open. bummer).

Coming back from my mechanic's home in Petaluma, I actually found myself with the rarest of things, a free afternoon! \u00a0Headed to North Beach and peeked into my usual haunts, but for some reason, unlike the other day, they were unusually dead so I waved at a couple friends and ended up here.  The bartender, Amy B, was super cool as always and great with all the patrons at the bar. \u00a0Everyone was extremely welcoming and the place had the most wonderful neighborhood vibe as everyone talked to everyone on a variety of topics including the earthquake, the end of the world (Rapture), new restaurants, Michael Bauer, and everything else.  Saw an intriguing little sign hanging on the wall inside that states:  NOSMO  KING  After staring at a bit and baffled by it's intent, I asked Amy about it. \u00a0I thought that perhaps NOSMO was related to NISMO which is a Nissan racing thing. \u00a0She told me to say it a few times...okay...I got it...LOL  Truly a great bar! \u00a0The free pool table was there, but I didn't even get on it (which is saying a lot) since I was having such a great time hanging out and talking with newfound friends. \u00a0Locals with a great Cheers-like vibe. \u00a0This is truly what a great neighborhood bar is all about. \u00a0It's a little off the beaten path and not the easiest to find unless you are specifically going with that destination in mind, perhaps that's what gives the place it's innocence and keeps it special. \u00a0May it never change and may it last a hundred years.",

Word on the street is that Sweeties is owned by an artist (who also owns Pier 23--also a cool spot). Adjoined to an actual art gallery, Sweeties is brimming with funky pieces of art; handycrafts and surprise sculptures (ladies, check the bathroom). I just love the colors and vibe here.  On Tuesdays, Cormick is the evening bartender. He is the sweetest, friendliest, and handsomest bartender around. While the other bartenders are AWESOME, Cormick has a special appeal and Tuesdays are definitely worth getting drunk over if he's manning the bar.  Did I mention that Sweeties makes mini pizzas? No? Well, THEY DO! What a genius idea right? One too many drinks? Shouldn't have had that last shot? Well, I'll have a fresh min-pizza and I'll be back to normal in no time! True story, my friends.  I miss coming here on a weekly basis, but I will definitely make a special trip now and then to visit the bars stool next to the fat Buddha.

Hidden away just enough so the hipsters and tourist are not able to find it.  Definitely a well kept secret.",

Hmm...   If there are ten of you intending to act like assholes after getting drunk enough to do so, this probably isn't the place for you. If you're here to enjoy the local life or simply relax, give it a go.  The music was great too, not too intrusive but audible enough to enjoy if you wanted to.",

What you'll get is a stiff drink and some pretty standard beers on tap. Their guest beer is Anchor California lager, so you're not exactly talking super craft.  Beers are super cheap during happy hour, the bartender doesn't wear gloves, and you get stale chips. It's divey, and there's a kitschy Buddha statue next to the pool table. Not complaining though. Sometimes, you just need a place like this to clear your head. Oh, and it's pretty much always empty because of its location. It has a small tv, and there's a $10 limit on cards. Local watering hole to the max.",

The roasted cashews are delicious and well worth the $3. \u00a0Amy apologized for having to charge us but we completely understood. Nuts are expensive! \u00a0I love that they buy cashews and then season and roast them there.  The women's bathroom is spacious and clean. \u00a0I cannot report back on the men's bathroom since I did not go in there.   I am not sporty but they have a pool table for those of you that are.",

If you like wandering off the beaten path (often in the opposite direction of tourists) and want to cozy up at a bar with a good book or your laptop amongst locals, then this is more your speed.   I was in SF for a work trip and needed some after hours downtown among good company and that's just want I got. It's a low-key place with a local clientele. Drinks are your typical dive bar drinks though I did get a dirty martini and was pleasantly surprised. Not the best I've had, but good well made and decently priced.  I ended up spending the evening chatting to locals about the neighborhood and their personal journeys to San Francisco. It'll definitely be a place that I'll return each chance I get, they made me feel welcomed and at home, and have encouraged me to visit when I return. I even got a good-bye hug from a regular (a lovely older gentleman) who's a wealth of information and history.",
