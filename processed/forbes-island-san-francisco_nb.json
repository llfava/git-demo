The island is very unique. \u00a0The men's restroom is above the water and decorated in an interesting island/tiki way. \u00a0The women's restroom is in the underwater cabin.  I most enjoyed the interior d\u00e9cor. \u00a0The ambience was very tranquil and classy, while keeping its out-at-sea feel.  We climbed to the top of the lighthouse after dinner and enjoyed the great view.

I didn't know he was capable of making reservations, but he actually called in for a reservation weeks ago so kudos to him!   It was perfect weather walking from the garage down to Pier 39 (Forbes validates parking tickets!) and we waited just a couple of minutes for the shuttle ferry to arrive.  We were seated immediately and it didn't take long for us to realize that we were both getting a little bit nauseous from the rocking of the \"island\"! The dining room is cozy &amp; it makes for a very romantic and intimate environment, but you can also definitely hear the conversations of people who are sitting two tables away.   My boyfriend ordered a glass of Cabernet and the organic salmon w/ pesto rice and I got the classic filet mignon which was actually cooked to perfection. His salmon came out great and tasted very fresh. I kinda kicked myself because I had actually wanted the lamb lollipops but was craving steak for some reason at that moment in time. Anyways, there might be more spectacular food elsewhere but being at Forbes is an entirely different dining experience from any other restaurant (one of the reasons being, you're dining \"underwater\").   After dinner, we walked around the grounds a bit and went up the lighthouse. Going up the stairs added to the swaying definitely brought on a minor headache but it was so worth it to see the 360-degree view at the top! I really have nothing but good things to say about dining here!",

Imagine my surprise when the \"island\" turned out to be about a one lap swim distance from the H dock of Pier 39. \u00a0How I've missed it all these years is a mystery. \u00a0No wonder i missed it, it's doesn't really look like an island from Pier 39.  While we contemplated the message from the phone saying it was \"after hours,\" I noticed the captain himself sitting in the heated waiting area near the boat.  The \"boat\" was a fully covered sea taxi. \u00a0No open air ocean breeze, no need for the aforementioned winter wear. \u00a0Forbes was very hospitable and welcoming. In less time that you can say \"What the hell is Forbes Island?\" we were docked on the island.  After a very brief tour, we were led downstairs to the dining room. Here's where my anxiety began. \u00a0It was rocking. And not obviously so, but gently, as if we were standing on a magic carpet lost in the streets of Rome going 2 miles per hour. \u00a0But it was moving...holy crap.  I loved the ambiance, very cozy. \u00a0Forget about sitting near the portholes, there's nothing to see and you'd be sitting just next to the bar. \u00a0Quite frankly, i was scared of what would swim/float by...  For as much as I loved the experience, I wished it didn't move so much. I know many with seasoned sea legs may not be affected, but I'm very sensitive to motion. \u00a0Thankfully, \u00a0I was able to get through the entire dinner without feeling too sick. \u00a0I must say though, by the time dessert rolled around, i kept thinking \"I need to get to solid ground!\"  The food was good. \u00a0I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but it was not disappointing. \u00a0The warm calimari salad was quite nice, as was the sea bass special that I ordered.  We climbed the 55-stair lighthouse. \u00a0The view from the top platform was incredible. \u00a0Also, the video in the first dining room to your left was also informative and interesting.   Just remember, it's a ship, smartly disguised as an island! \u00a0No special seafaring attire needed. \u00a0  OMG, just thinking about this experience makes my head swim like i'm on the Disneyland Teacups. \u00a0OOOOOhhhhhhhh.",

    "review_text": "This is such a unique place yet not many people knows about it. After living here - in the city for 10 years and have come to Fisherman Wharf a number of times ( as you know every time that you have visitors from out of town, this is the area that you need to take them to) So I probably have seen this place many many times. Yet I always thought that it 's a private property that \"off limit\" which now I know it's not true. Because anyone who can affords a dinner in the price tag around $50 ( or more )per person can come here( I know, it's not cheap at all)  \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 So 2 months ago, it was the first time that i came here. My friend took me here because she knew that I work in the wedding business and she wanted my second opinion about having her wedding at this venue.    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first thing that caught my attention ( and a lot of people's attentions ), was getting on a small boat ride - to get to the Forbes Island ( this is the only way, you can get to the place ) if you get \" Seasick\" easily like me, It's not fun yet I still think that this is very very charming and it's a great way to arrive at the Forbes Island.   \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0But the most surprise of all, is the view ! I know so many restaurants claim that they have the best view in town. And I would like to think I have seen a lot of great views from a lot of great restaurants and hotels But this is the one best view that I ever seen from San Francisco, Why?? \u00a0Because you got to see it all ! the Golden Gate Bridge, The whole Bay, The Alcatraz, The back drop of the whole city. You see it all in very \"up close and personal\" \u00a0and 360 degree. The place itself decorated as an small island but NOT the up scale one and NOT the most charming one either. But I totally do not care much about the decoration anymore once I got her. Because the view itself was so marvelous.    \u00a0 \u00a0I would rate the food ( good but not great ), the service ( friendly and could be \u00a0a bit slow ), and the decoration and over all \u00a03 solid stars but not more but the view itself 10 stars and more.... To having a dinner or a SMALL private event here and surrounded by these views are priceless!!!!! So i told my best friend the she picked the good venue.   \u00a0Then last weekend, My best friend 's wedding arrived and I have to say the whole thing ran pretty smoothly and wonderfully every guests felt in love with this place, just like i do.    \u00a0 \u00a0So the only thing that make me knock down a star is \"the boat ride\" because, many times in this wedding that the guests arrived at different times but some of them got left at \"The Boat Dock\"!!!   \u00a0 As I mentioned, you need the boat ride to get to the place and they have only one boat and one captain and most of the time he ( the captain) parked his boat at the Forbes Island instead of at the Boat Dock. For that, you really needed to call Forbes Island to asked him to bring the boat to your dock and some guests complained that it \u00a0took forever (20 mins or more) for him (the captain) to bring the boat to the dock and \u00a0took them to the restaurant and this caused the guests to miss some of the important wedding programs.    \u00a0 \u00a0All in all, this is very charming place and the best view in the whole town but the boat ride need to be handled better in the event, such as wedding, like this. Because the last thing you ever want, is your guests couldn't come to see your ceremony just because they kept waiting for the boat ride!",

Ok, maybe tale is not quite fateful, the tropic port is really Pier 39, there were more than five passengers and it was only a three second tour.   Forbes Island itself is not a real island but a barge fashioned into floating land mass \u00a0 docked by the sea lions. Seriously, fellas, take your girls here, it will make her heart flutter.

I'm blonde and since I'm easily confused in life I wasn't sure if I was going to have trouble finding this place. There didn't seem to be a lot of information on how the boat to the restaurant worked and I didn't want to be late for our reservation.   It was surprisingly easy! If you know where the sea lions are at, the place the boat docks at is in the same area. You just find the letter (I forget what it is now) and wait at the gate/door. Our reservation was at 5pm, and getting there at about 4:50pm was perfect.   It's a silly little boat ride, VERY short but fun! Again, this is a really neat experience for someone that's from out of town and you can definitely get the surprise factored in. The person I was with had NO idea what we were doing. It's definitely NOT an island but more like a really big floating boat/dock thing.  I read a bunch of reviews mentioning the possibility of getting sea sick.... I have to say that I consider myself pretty tough when it comes to stuff like that, but the place does sway slightly back and forth. I had to do the mind over matter... talking myself out of the sea sickness. I ended up being ok but I can see how it could be trouble for other people.   The food was great. We both had the special, some kind of fish over potatoes and it was really good! The wine that was suggested to us complimented the meal very well.

I took my boyfriend on a surprise dinner here and he was not at all expecting to go on a boat to an underwater restaurant. It was also nice for us to take a tour of the \"island\" and lighthouse afterwards.   Tips for finding the boat to take you to Forbes: Walk towards the sea lions on Pier 39. Halfway there, you'll see a gate that says \"I.\" Wait there and there's a boat that comes every 7 minutes that will come pick you up.",

A  Anyways, I literally had the best meal of my life here. Literally...not exaggerating that.   I didn't even want to go out, but came here with my wonderful gf anyways...  I knew we got it right when I tasted the clam chowder. Amazing. We shared it and passed it back and forth. Huge chunks of clam, which fall apart in your mouth..not rubbery like most clam chowders.....perfectly seasoned. And now I'm hungry again.   We got the lamb lollipops and the flat iron steak. I was going to get the filet mignon by in my small experience, filet mignon is way overrated.  Both of these, the lollipops and steak, were the best I've ever had. I've paid a stupid amount of money for steaks before and most of them have been \"meh\"....Most restaurants just sous vide the meat and think it's good to go.   The steak was probably sous vide'd (not complaining, it's the best way to cook thick cuts, but I think people misuse the technique).... but they added a delicious curst to the steak..and the sauce on it was amazing. I don't like steak with sauces drizzled on, but the sauce was as good as the steak.   As for the lamb lollipops...best again. I recommend putting a little salt scattered on a plate next to the entree and \"dipping\" in the lollipops as needed. Careful of course b/c over-salting will kill it.   Finished it off with the creme brulee. It was delicious, but I can't provide much input as it's the first one I ever had..and was of course great.   The staff was great. Very friendly, not intimidating (as some staff can be with 30+ dollar menus).   Down to earth.   Also teh views were amazing.

    "review_text": "this place seems to get either 3 star reviews, or 5 star reviews. \u00a0i'm in the 5 star camp. \u00a0allow me to explain the factors involved in this.  - the restaurant is in (as in, literally in) fisherman's wharf, the tourist armpit of san francisco. - you get on a pontoon boat to travel, at most, 50 meters to an \"island\" that is a floating house, which is driven by the owner of the restaurant. - upon arrival, the owner takes you on a tour of the \"island\", complete with palm trees, a 40 foot lighthouse, fountains, a beach, etc. - you eat underwater, a place which, the owner is quick to show from old photos, appears to have been the slickest bachelor pad in existence in the 70's, when the restaurant was previously his house. - if it has been a windy / choppy day, do not come here under any circumstances. \u00a0again, it's a houseboat. \u00a0it will move with waves. \u00a0and you're below deck eating and drinking. - the wine list is terribly skewed toward expensive, over-exposed selections. \u00a0we selected a $55 bottle and it was one of the cheapest things you'd actually want to drink on the menu. - the food was average. \u00a0not great, not bad, average. \u00a0it didn't upset me. - the server was pretty attentive, and very nice, but belonged in an applebees. - our bill was $200 for two people, with no dessert. \u00a0when your wine is only $55, let's all agree that this is fucking steep at any restaurant period. \u00a0you can do a full course dinner at gary danko / masa's / michael mina for this cost. - after dinner, we climbed the lighthouse and surveyed the fine view that is fisherman's wharf - the owner returned with his pontoon boat after, at most 90 seconds. \u00a0he was extremely interested in how good our dinner was. \u00a0we lied and told him it was amazing. \u00a0he was really happy about it.  conclusion: \u00a0at gary danko, the owner of the restaurant doesn't take you in a pontoon boat to a houseboat with palm trees, show you old pictures of his converted swag pad where he banged a ton of girls when he was in his 30's, encourage you to climb a lighthouse on said houseboat after dinner, and then take you back to land in a boat while genuinely caring what you thought of the experience.  you pay for what you get. \u00a0you don't go to disney world and then complain that your $12 hot dog isn't the best you've ever tasted.  the end",

    "review_text": "Brought my girlfriend here for our Anniversary.  1) The restaurant has an awesome atmosphere. You have to go underground on the island where you eat below the water line. Lighting and design is incredibly and AMAZINGLY cozy with a fireplace in the middle. Decorated like a ship with dark browns and reds with lots of Sea type painting.  2) The waiters are AMAZING. Super friendly and on the ball. All of them are amazingly kind and incredibly professional. Some of the best I have come across.  3) The reason for the stars would be due to Food and ironically, the location. I ordered the Risotto and my girlfriend had the chicken. I feel like for the quality of food it was overpriced a bit and tasted just OK. Looked nice on the dish though. A bit bland and limited menu as well.  Also, the biggest problem we ran into is that when you are under the island in the restaurant you can feel it swaying back and forth just slightly. It did mess with my head a little and I could deal with it but it VERY MUCH made my girlfriend sick. We ended up having to leave before she touched her food. If you can't deal with swaying or being on a boat I wouldn't recommend eating at Forbes.  4) I didn't drink at the bar but they have one upstairs and downstairs. There was a small group of people at the upstairs bar and it looked like it could be fun to go to with some friends. You don't really experience the swaying feeling upstairs.  5) All in all... I loved the atmosphere a lot and I would definitely return for special occasions. I would also like to try more of the menu since I've only experienced two dishes.",

    "review_text": "We went to Forbes Island for my boyfriend's belated birthday celebration, and it was truly a special experience. It's a bit expensive for my taste, so thank goodness his company was paying for it as a birthday present, but I'd say that it's almost worth the price for the delicious food and the experience (and you should know at this point that I'm quite cheap.)  I had the avocado, crab, and scallop salad followed by the Canadian salmon with spinach and pesto rice. The rice was melt in your mouth amazing, and the whole entree was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. The salmon was a tiny bit overcooked though. The appetizer was good, but not spectacular. My boyfriend started with a green salad that looked like nothing special to me, but for his entree, he had the flatiron steak and potatoes and really enjoyed them - the steak was cooked perfectly, and I loved the seasoning on the potatoes.   We dressed up semi-formal for it and didn't feel out of place, but we could have gotten away with jeans too.  It was fun walking around the \"island\" (it's actually a converted houseboat, we were told) afterward while we sobered up for the trip home. There's a beautiful view from the lighthouse, and the whole experience is a fun and entertaining one.  The staff was super nice and friendly, and I highly recommend the place for a special occasion dinner.",

Interesting experience too, and beautiful views. Only one thing to think of is the island is like a floating house boat, so it wiggles a bit. If you get queasy easily, plan ahead for that. To be fair, we stopped noticing the movement after about 20 min. Great experience! We loved it and plan to go back!",

Boyfriend was trinna be cute and surprise me with \"dinner on a private island\" which you know, I loved and if I was rating just on the experience and not the food I'd give it 5 stars.   I LOVED the lighthouse!! We were lucky to watch the sunset from up top and also if you look towards Pier 39 you have a clear view of the seals. I also love how you get to walk around during dinner. My boyfriend pointed out that we got to do this because we couldn't ditch out on them because we were on an island! So while we waited for our food, we got to explore the place and chatted up with Mr. Forbes himself. I don't know if he mentioned this because we were Chinese, but he told us he loved dim sum and loves New Asia in Chinatown. ( GOT TO recommend better places for him) HAHA that was pretty funny. We were also 30 mins late for our reservation, but that didnt seem to matter.   Food was .. not that special. The ceaser salad was really good tho! They seem to only use the hearts of the romaine? So every lettuce was the same length and placed out neatly. (Thats what you get for going to a \"fancy\" place). We also got the chicken and the steak and our bill came out 80 some dollars.

    "review_text": "My husband and I are from So Cal but come up to SF as much as possible. We do not hang around the tourist infested piers or do anything remotely close to what a tourist would do while here. Our close friend saw Forbes Island Restaurant on a food show and we have suggested dinner here. We have never heard or saw this restaurant in the area but agreed to dinner.   We arrived on Sunday and decided to walk to the end of the pier to get a view of this floating island/restaurant. We were surprised to see it floating like a boat at the end of the pier. We wondered how the seating fit into this floating island and decided, this will be a fun experience. The following day we arrived for dinner.  The short boat ride was cute and fun. The Captain, Ryan was happy to welcome us on his \"boat\" and gave us a short history lesson on Forbes Island.   The experience was fun, different and the food was delicious. It was interesting to see the restaurant below, the bar upstairs and the very cool looking lighthouse. Yes, the decor is not modern, however it not old and it fits in perfectly with our dinner. We often go to restaurants like The Brown Derby, The Magic Lamp and The Sycamore Inn which have the same decor however no one EVER says anything negative about the \"outdated\" furniture. It adds to the great experience.   Our server, Dakota was just as great as the food and experience. I had the halibut cheeks dinner with risotto and a side of great tasting leeks. my husband had the braised short ribs with very creamy mashed potatoes and yams. There is nothing bad that I can say about our meal. I was very impressed and decided at that moment that I was going to return the next time I was in town.   I have had spent 3 times more on dinners that were equally as delicious as our meal, service and drinks at Forbes Island.  I strongly encourage everyone to come in and give this place a try. It is definitely different and worth the experience. Don't let the 2 or 3 stars prevent you from coming in.   Obviously some reviewers loved the food but didn't like the rocking of the restaurant. Um, hello....your floating on the water and currents will make the restaurant move. Duh.   If you are a foodie, review on the food and grade on the food..not the decor. After all, how many people give 5 stars for a food truck parked on a busy street.....ALOT. If the food is good, it's worth the stars. If you just didn't like the server, say it in the review or contact the owner. That's it.  I loved it and will return.",

Right when we arrived two workers walked by us and didn't make eye contact til I approached this one guy, I said we had a reservation for two. He just kinda pointed at one table at the corner and said \"I figured you have a reservation if you're here. \" ugh unnecessary response but ok. So we sat down and no menus for about 5 mins. Our server finally came with the menus and asked us if we wanted to get drinks and start with some appetizers. I'm all thinking you just got here with the menus I don't know what you have yet. So I asked her for a couple of mins. She didn't come back til ten minutes after.   We decided to get their soup of the day, it was not bad but could be better. The entree I got was the slow braised short ribs (5 stars) which was delicious and the hubby got the classic filet mignon (3 stars) which was ehh we've had better. Our server got my order wrong at first. She brought me a Denver cut steak instead of the short ribs, she was very nice and apologetic about it but c'mon how do you get two people's order wrong, if there was 6+ people maybe.. but it wasn't even busy. Also we got two desserts, Napoleon mixed berry thing (3 1/2 stars) and the chocolate souffl\u00e9 with pecan crust (5 stars).   Overall the 2 minute boat ride was a cool experience, we got to go to the lighthouse, and my husband enjoyed his birthday but other than that, service coulda been better.   If you do get seasick, I suggest you pass.   +ambiance +food +boat ride -service -seasick",

    "review_text": "This is more of fun night out or a touristy thing to do, it's not actually an island it's a floating man made lighthouse/dock/thingamajig, but still fun none the less. You have to go out to Fisherman's warf right where pier 39 begins and there is a blue awning and you board the boat from a tiny dock. The boat ride is fun although really short, honestly it looks like you can jump from one of the docks near pier 39 and land on the island. So the skipper takes you to the makeshift \"island\" and you deboard (I don't know you deboard a boat or is it called something else?) and Gilligan greets you and takes you the restaurant. You go downstairs and actually the dining is underwater. Ginger will welcome you to the restaurant and show you to your table. Mary Ann takes your order and brings you some really good food. The dungeness crab and scallop salad is very good, but I always feel funny eating fresh crab meat that is already out of the shell. Always feels like there's a guy back there sucking the meat out of the shell and plating it, I dunno' maybe it's just me.  anyways the Avocado Bruschetta is good and so are the baby greens. Then Professor will cook you some very tender short ribs for your entree although a little too sweet for my taste, and the Iron steak, filet mignon are delish (of course). The risotto is very creamy and tasty. Thurston Howell the third, will bring you plenty of bread and the potatoes au gratin sides are good, although to cheesy for my stomach to be easy (gosh darn lactose intolerance!!!). The atmosphere is like 1940s ocean-liner-esque, pictures of old salty dawgs, nautical knick-knacks and there are actual port holes (windows) that are open to the water, but there is so much algae growing on them you cannot see anything but the color green. I didn't see Mrs. Howell but I guess she's in the back washing the dishes. afterwards you can walk about the small \"island\" go to the top of the light house to take pictures etc. etc. then the boat takes you on a less than 3 hour tour (about 5 minutes) back to the dock. It's innocent fun and if you get stuck on the island just use some coconuts and string and call the mainland, somebody will come rescue you, have fun.",

Mr.Forbes is quite the character and has a great sense of humor! \u00a0We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and asked his advice on where to be seated. Mr. Forbes directed us downstairs ~ it was so cool, fireplace, lounge, port holes w/fish swimming by VERY romantic! AND don't miss going to the womens restroom, that is an experience in itself.   My husband ordered the rack of lamb [read online that is was the best] and he looooooved it. I had the Filet Mignon and it was fabulous w/augratin potatoes. Also, started with appetizer, seafood chowder and Ceasar salad. Dessert ~ creme brule of course and chocolate mousse both were excellent. Charles Krug cabernet savignon accompanied dinner also very good.  After our meal we hiked up the light-house, and were amazed at the stunning view. \u00a0A note: there was some gentle-rocking back and forth of the entire island, if that bothers you ~ we suggest taking dramamine before hand.   We love to find new restaurants and this one is well worth the trip ~ the food is terrific as well as the ambiance, we can't wait to return!",

The Food: i had the salad, Salmon for entree, and Jello for dessert. \u00a0The salad was good, veggi are fresh. the Salmon is a MUST!!!.. that was the BEST salmon i've ever had. \u00a0it was semi-cooked sitting on some kind of sauce. \u00a0Jello is too sweet not a must.   Price : expect to about $150 for 2 people (regular price) if u get wine too. we came on a thursday night and they had this special deal going on. \u00a0$35 for a 3 course meal.   After dinner, you can walk around this little man-made island and just check things out. because it was during the winter, it gets cozy and windy (sf weather)   This is a nice/classy place for dates. not good for groups (unless u're going to have your wedding here)",

Forbes Kiddoo (the owner of the island) is the usual boat taxi-er from dock to island and he always makes wonderful conversation and just makes you feel so welcome and special getting to visit his private island. But this evening Chris taxi'd us to and fro and he was equally fun to ride in a boat with and shared stories of people getting married and engaged on the island.  My favorite dish is the steak with green beans and potatoes au-gratin, there is this delicious mustard sauce on top of the steak and it is to die for. I think about it all the time.  Since we love this place so much we really want to consider it as a wedding venue, however, with limited capacity (max. in restaurant is 65) I don't think my dream wedding on Forbes Island will come true, but we are happily considering having our rehearsal dinner here!  You can rent the rooms on the top of the island, one with a bar and a fire place and a lovely view of the city, and the other room seats a few more people and has a lovely view of the bay, the Golden Gate Bridge... it's gorgeous on both sides of the island, truly. You can even reserve the whole restaurant or even the whole island! We are tempted! The main guy in charge is Casey and he is really friendly and very informative and flexible. The bartender, Pierre, is very easy to talk to and informative as well. We had a lovely time this evening enjoying the house wines at the bar, the fireplace and the swaying chandelier as we went over all of the different options for having a wedding here.",

I made a reservation for 5:45, got lost, finally found our way to pier 39 after an hour or so. Theres a shuttle that takes u on a 30-second ride to the restaurant which is bobbing up and down in the water. The man wont take you to the restaurant without a reservation. We told him we did but were sooo late for it. He took us anyway hoping they will still let us dine. To my surprise they did! Were talking about one hour late here, haha.. They take u down under water which isnt a good idea when youre prone to vertigo or dizziness coz the place is enclosed and u feel the movement but u dont see it. I wanted to have a cocktail but i knew itll only make me queasy. Food isnt the best but still good. We had the caesar salad for appetizer, i had the organic salmon, the hubby had the chicken. And u know how their menu isnt kid-friendly? The waiter offered to make my 2 kids pasta with butter sauce that was on the house! I appreciate it so much. I know its just spaghetti with garlic butter but my kids devoured it like theres no tomorrow, haha! That was pretty nice of them. Later on after were done eating we climbed up to the lighthouse. Pls take a camera, for the view is spectacular up there! We walked around the \"island\", took all the pix we need. They even have a heater out on the deck, it was just beautiful in every way. Only downside is the rocking! But i got over it after a while. We own a boat but somehow i still get dizzy!",

This was a double date dinner to Forbes Island. Each couple had a coupon for free entree with the purchase of roasted chicken breast, pan-roasted salmon or flat iron steak entree.   While waiting for our other party to arrive, there is plenty to explore on the island including a sea lion serenade and a self-guided tour of a 56-stair lighthouse. The dining room itself made me feel like I was on a pirate ship with the sword and chain decorations. Lighting is dim with a romantic setting with sunlight shining through the stained window panes and reflecting off the mirrored walls. Try to get a seat next to the window to see the fish since the restaurant is underwater.   The meal started off with soft sourdough bread and salt and pepper butter. We order a bottle of Jade Mountain 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon. It was a smooth wine that paired well with our steaks. \u00a0My medium-rare steak was drizzled with a peppercorn glaze. The potato-au-gratin (my favorite style to serve potatos) had a very buttery bechamel sauce and was served with a side of crunchy string beans and a carrot. \u00a0Before you leave, ladies should make sure they make the detour to the captain's room to wash your hands. The layout is quite charming.   Be warned, \u00a0the floating island does get shaky and after a hour on the island, the tiny tremors of the island shifting with the waves does get nauseating. But feel free to walk around upstairs. They also validate parking. The experience is unique and worth it at least once for locals and tourists alike.  ~Cheers.",

    "review_text": "I have been making a list of places I have yet to write a review for and this one was creeping up. Why not? This place is intriguing. It captures you and makes you want to go there. The place in itself piques your interest. It has you thinking, \"WTF is it? It can't be a real island. Wait it's near where all those noisy, stinky seals are?\"   Well whatever gets you to go here you will either love it or hate it. I happened to love it. My wife and I came here for dinner on a Stormy night. Ok, maybe not stormy to most but I grew up in the bay and a little rain is stormy to me. You take a little shuttle boat to the island and that's pretty cool. Once you get on the island you realize what has been done here. It's really a ship. It's a ship with its own self-contained Eco system with a light house on top and an actual island feel.  Then you go into the restaurant itself, which is the hull. Yes, it sways back and forth and probably did so on this night more so than the norm. But you would be an idiot to think this wouldn't happen. The people that knocked stars down because of this just didn't deserve to come here. Just order some whiskey sours and after a few sips you wouldn't be able to tell the place was moving anyway.  The wait staff, and service all around was amazing. The food was great. I went filet mignon and that was delectable. Price can be steep but hey, it's not an everyday thing. Do it for the wife you love, the girlfriend you want to wife up but not the girl you see after hours with low self esteem. There are other establishments for those types. Most of the time Popeyes will do for those occasions.   If you are a person who gets sea sick you should be prepared because you are dining underwater. For a nice dinner for two, expect $200 and a tip. Don't be that person who doesn't tip. These waiters are pretty amazing and so is the kitchen staff and chef for dealing out the amazing food they serve here. Oh yeah, once inside you forget about the seals. So just get over it.",

We were there on Memorial Day weekend, with the celebration for the Golden Gate's 75th. We went that Sunday night.   We started to stress out a bit on the boat ride over because there was some really obnoxious kids there, but they went to a room for a private party, while we were taken downstairs.   Outstanding atmosphere? Damn straight! Excellent service? Couldn't be better. LOVED our waiter..cracked us up and served us perfectly. Wine? PHENOMENAL.   The food. Oh, the food. My husband and I actually stopped talking because the food was so flipping good. The potatoes really stick out in my mind. I remember being sad with every bite because there was a little less food for me to eat.   We then got another glass of wine and went up to the top of the light house. So, so beautiful!! I little rocky because the whole thing is floating on water, so we came right down. We watched the fireworks from the deck.   Romantic, yummy, fun...I simply could not ask for a better experience.

The owner once lived on it for 23 years by Sausalito and then decided to partner up and turned it into a restaurant and redid his home to a small private tropical island with palm trees, waterfalls and a lighthouse!   The island was literally a floating land, therefore if you're easily sick sea try to find ways to ease it or it's a pass. To get to the island there's a private own boat that's driven by the owner himself! Dress warm if you're there on a cold night because it's interesting experience to walk around the island and up in the lighthouse too..but don't go up there drunk! It's a heck of a flight if stairs I'd youre out of shape and not able to step foot properly.   They have delicious drink menu, ambiance was interesting, majority of the walls are covered in mirrors to give you the illusion of a larger setting. Very romantic setup.   For dinner, we had the seafood chowder good for two so ask the wait staff to split, also had the brusetta (tomatoes, avocado with maybe some sort of spreading too) still delicious for both starters. I had the lamb shank, delicious as well but definitely get it made medium rare to rare...if you're a person that likes sashimi...it'll be close to it but in lamb. Didn't had dessert, portions were large enough.   A good one time experiences for special occasion or sonething new..I wouldn't try it again because I just found out I'm easily sea sick! =(",

The ferry ride was an easy 1-2 minutes away, and the island itself was pretty incredible. There were private dining rooms on the deck &amp; the main dining area was downstairs, underneath the water.  It's really dark &amp; there's only a few portholes where you can supposedly see sea creatures float about, but those spots were taken. Our table instead was at the farthest corner of the downstairs dining RIGHT next to the door leading to the kitchen &amp; to the girl's restroom.  DO NOT GO IF YOU GET SEA-SICK EASILY.  I thought I'd be fine since I've gone boating many a time but the island is incredibly rocky!! I couldn't even sit &amp; wait around for my meal because I was that nauseous. I kept walking around in hopes it would ease my nausea but it just got worse. When the meal came, I only had about a bite of it &amp; had to leave the island ASAP.  I probably wouldn't try this place again.  I only gave it two stars because I really liked how the place looked. Otherwise, it would just be a one star.",

Food-wise, we ordered their steaks but they were overcooked and not as tender; yet hey charged for a 5-star restaurant price but not as high quality.   I definitely would not pay the fairly high prices for what I thought was not great enough. Services were great though and that's why I leave that two stars just for the service.",

We were running late and my parents were already at Pier 39  \"Wait for me outside of Hard Rock Cafe\" \"We're eating at Hard Rock Cafe?!\" \"No, just wait for me outside\" \"Can we just go to the restaurant?\" \"No...you'll never be able to find it\"  We take the little cruise, captained by Forbes himself. Upon landing, we circle up the stairs to the top of the lighthouse for an amazing view. I never get tired of looking at San Francisco, except for the 16th St. Bart station.   After exploring the island (about 3 minutes) we sit down to dinner. I am still charmed by the gaslights on the table.   The food is good. Not spectacular, but not bad. About $15 more than what I would normally spend, but this is about the \"experience\". Mom, Dad and all my friends loved it.  I'm knocking 1 star off of a 5 star experience for the ridiculous $3 surcharge for the boat ride.",

If you get there early you can wander around the fairly small island and look at the waterfalls, the scenery, the seals and the lights from the city, but I wouldn't recommend being too early because there really isn't a place to wait in the restaurant.  We got there exactly on time but our table wasn't ready yet. We waited in that \"bar\". The bartenders the manager and very nice. They were very apologetic for making us wait about half an hour and comped our wine corkage fee which I thought was fair. While I thought their menu was a little limiting, \u00a0the food was pretty good (I was impressed). Our favorites were that crab scallops and avocado salad, the braised short ribs, and the apple tart. Overall a very memorable experience. I thought it was a great experience for the price.

Yes, it's near the tourists, but really.... I don't understand why locals hate tourists so much. Granted, there are a lot of them in this area, but if that stops you from trying restaurants in the area, you don't deserve to be treated to this spot anyway. Stop it already with the pre-conceived notions. I digress...  The experience of dining of Forbes Island merits 5 stars all on it's own. The service is outstanding and it's completely unique. True, some people might be too queasy to dine here, but honestly, you can only feel the movement of the water if a ferry passes by (usually slows down a lot during dinner time) and if you stand very still. Only if you are VERY VERY sensitive to motion should you second guess coming here. Otherwise, moving around the island and even just sitting and talking is enough to make you dismiss slight movement you might feel.   Pre-conceived ideas about food in a touristy area are generally merited, but the food here is good. The lamb I had on my last visit was excellent in flavor, presentation, and cooked to a perfect medium. The pricing is appropriate for the quality/quantity and the cocktails are well done. I highly recommend the Valrhona chocolate cake for dessert. It is rich, but not overly sweet and I assure you.... you will want to sit and savor it while you look at the view for a long while... if you can keep yourself from devouring it within the first minute of service, that is.  I always worry that receiving good reviews will ruin my favorite spots, but hopefully, Forbes will keep things even-keel for many years to come.",

Went to Beer 39 and had a couple of brews while searching for a place to have dinner on the I pad. Most places were booked. We decided to walk around and check it out when I remembered a place Called Forbes Island that we had dinner at last summer. You have to take Mr. \u00a0Forbes water taxi to the restaurant because it is on Forbes Island. The Island is man maid (by Forbes) and it has waterfalls, a light house, beaches ect... \u00a0You can dine down stairs which is underwater with port holes and a cool bar or upstairs in a tiki themed room with views of Alcatraz and Angle Island  So, we saw the water taxi at the dock with Forbes standing there. I called down to him asking if he had any reservations. He motioned down to the dock and told us they had a fixed menu that night and were full but he would see what he could do. Next thing you know we are on our way to the island. We chose upstairs in the Tiki Room. What views!  We chose from the five course fixed menu. Great choices. I had the rack of Lamb as my entree'. All of the courses were top notch. Had a great bottle of Chardonnay with dinner. Arial was our server. Very rarely can I say I have received five star service. We did! She was amazing. She told us to stay until 9:30 when the fireworks display started. Never pushed us for time.  The fireworks display was awesome. The barges that they dispersed the fireworks from were maybe 500 feet away, right over our heads! Arial served us Porto and coffee on the deck while we watched the show.  What a perfect way to spend Independence Day. I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion. Great job Forbes!!",

You get to take a little boat ride to the island captained by Mr. Forbes himself. He's a really interesting guy who takes to return customers very well and always greets new diners with the same respect.   There are quite a few reviews about the rooms, lighthouse, and cool venue this is so I won't touch on those...not much I can add.  I love the feel of this place the best...especially if you get to eat downstairs (underwater) near the bar. It's quiet, intimate, relaxing, and the service staff does everything to make sure that feel isn't ruined.   Service is friendly, perfectly timed, very helpful when it comes to special requests, and really couldn't be better. I will definately consider making reservations at Forbes Island for any large formal event I may hold in the future.  A few years ago, I and my ex shard a wonderful 4th of July dinner and fireworks show on Forbes Island. This was one of the best times of my life. Couldn't have found a better place to have a unique 4th of July time.   A+ all the way. Food was incredible, dessert left me only wanting more, and everything else along the way gives this place 5 stars with no doubt. An added bonus was seeing little fish swimming by the portholes below deck...very cool.  Spend-o-meter: up there but worth every penny Value: excellent...the whole experience from boat ride, to food, to walking around the island, and up the lighthouse. Can't beat it. Will I go back: you better believe it.  This is one place you need to experience at least once when you're in SF.

Anyway, fun and short boat ride to the island with an entertaining pilot, seated immediately, beautiful accommodations. Small tables with roses and candles, nautical artwork on the walls, attentive staff, and DELICIOUS food. I had the Caesar salad as an appetizer, an excellent choice. Only one vegetarian option (mushroom risotto), which is typical of fancy restaurants, but it was so good and I don't even like mushrooms. Haha  Plus, we had asked for something to toast with (it was my and my bf's anniversary), and then later, when the waitress brought our dessert, they had decorated the plate around the fantastic mousse with the words \"Happy Anniversary!\" Very thoughtful and of course, like everything else, delicious.  The only thing that made me sad is, though it's an underwater restaurant, there are only two portholes where you can actually see the water outside, and those are usually reserved for parties and the like. You can't request to be seated by them (I tried!) and so you lose some of the magic of eating underwater without actually being able to, you know, SEE the water next to you. Oh well.  Oh, and make sure to go to the top of the lighthouse. GORGEOUS views of SF and the bay, especially after sunset. Photo opportunities galore.

    "review_text": "\"How was Forbes Island?\" \"Interesting.\" \"Interesting good or interesting bad?\" \"Both.\"  The Good Generally attentive service, wonderful bread, simple yet thorough menu (lamb, beef, chicken, fish.) Well prepared Halibut Cheeks cooked dore style. Taking a water taxi to the restaurant and the great view from the lighthouse as well as the deck chairs when waiting for the taxi. Talking to the French man at the bar who also answers the phones.  The Bad Slightly overdressed salad. Being seated behind a table that was extended from 4 to six making for a tight squeeze. Our waitress forgot to bring us change for a good 6-7 minutes.  The Ugly Seasickness (the majority of the restaurant is below the water line, so there are no windows unless you eat on the top deck.) A single men's restroom on top deck. The quasi-\"tour\" the water taxi captain gave us when we were already running late (mildly interesting but strange feeling.) Not being able to find the dock (it's under Eagle's Cafe.)",

    "review_text": "Had dinner last night at one of the best kept secrets of the San Francisco area. This place is a man made island floating at pier 39 next to the area where all the seals rest. It is only reachable by boat at Pier 39 and the boat captains are very knowledgeable of the history of the island. There is a real light house erected on the island with 55 steps to the top for a nearly 360 degree view of a beautiful city for photos. What waits inside is great food with great service. Forbes offers a really nice selection of salads, appetizers, entrees and desserts at very reasonable prices. It is worth the experience and the food and service are really great. Next time you are in San Francisco, CA you need to make this a destination experience and dine below sea level for once in your life.",

    "review_text": "THE CUTEST ONCE IN A LIFE TIME EXPERIENCE!  It was a cold sf evening.. LIKE ALWAYS! We dialed in and waited for the boat to come pick us on. On the boat Mr. Kiddoo was asking how we all found out about this place.. and thats all thanks to YELP! When we arrived on the island, I felt like a queen entering her own private dinner.  I was with 5 others, including my boyfriend. It was my friends 3 year anniversary but she didn't want any of us to miss out on this oppurtunity. When we sat down in the dining room underwater, it was ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! Very Victorian.. Our server introduced himself and started us off with water, a bottle of champagne, and bread. The bread and butter was POPPPPIN. Excuse my language, but really, it was that good. My glass of champagne ended up all over my dress=[ but the servers were quick to help me change my chair and replace my table cloth. The whole dinner was a little SHAKY.. since we were on the water, but never the less still a great memory. The bathroom was sooo cute with a bedroom and everything attached!  We ordered:  Clam Chowder; had fish=[ I'm allergic to fish but my friends all had a nod of approval. Bell Pepper Soup; pretty delicious for bell peppers! Filet Mignon;The two guys claimed it was the best steak they've ever had. Flat Iron Steak;my two girlfriends ordered this, they did not say ANYTHING during dinner.. I'm going to assume it was good. Mushroom Rissoto;My boyfriend ordered this.. I have no idea why when hes usually a carnivore. He said it tasted like herbs.. I think it has a lavander taste.. It was alright, but I like my ANIMALS. Slow Braised Ribs; Im guessing it was braised in red wine, pretty good. The mashed potatos were YUM. And the squash was NOM WORTHY. But the sea got to me.. I was a bit sick&amp;couldn't finish=[  We asked for the check and they came out with this small suprise that the server made himself! It said happy anniversary in strawberry&amp;chocolate syrup and it even had a candle, DEFINITELY PUT SMILES ON ALL OUR FACES, especially the couple themselves=)  After dinner, the views were SOOO AMAZING. I didn't want to leave=[ It was sad walking out that island, but a view&amp;experience Ill never forget. Thank you Forbes Island!",

This restaurant was showcased on some food TV show or traveling show. It took the owner 10 yrs to get all the licenses. We were lucky to meet the owner on Saturday coz he only operate the shuttle once a week, the shuttle is operated by employee on other days. \u00a0Upon arrival the owner will show you around the island (which takes less than 5 minutes). \u00a0The restaurant is under water and you can feel it when the wave hit hard. The decor is romantic. This is defiantly a place for occasion for me. The food was just all right for me. I had salmon and my bf had filet mignon. I regretted not to order their special dish that night coz my neighbor table ordered it and they enjoy it so much. It was halibut cheek! \u00a0The dessert was fine for me. It wasn't anything that would make you go into a diabetic coma. The portion and the sweetness were just delightful. The light house was neat and we snapped quit some good shots. The night was memorable. 5 stars for the over all experience and 5 stars for the ambiance. 3 stars for the food.",

All of my guests were ranting and raving especially about the Edamame Crostinis and Wild Mushroom Duxelle.  2] Dessert: (A+) We had the platter of chocolate mousse with pecan crust and it was beyond tasty and delightful to sweeten our palettes after dinner.  3] Drinks: (A) Ordered the open bar for Wines, Champagnes, and Beers.  4] Service: (A+) Our waitress Tricia and event planner Casey were BEYOND AMAZING. I can't express how easy, warming, and perfect everything turned out for our night.  5] Ambiance: (A+) The whole property was very adventurous and exciting for all guests in our party. The ease of roaming around to the top of the lighthouse and to the different rooms, and then back to our private room for mingling was brilliant.  6] Price: (A+) We were quoted at a price, and was below budget at the end. Always a score.  FINAL: Hands down, amazing place! Definitely a landmark I will be visiting with out-of-towners or anyone I want to impress. :)",

    "review_text": "On September 10th, 2011, we recently held our wedding at Forbes Island. It went perfect.   We scoped the place out months beforehand and met with Casey- the man directing much of the planning and front-facing focus of the island. He was both warm and uniquely accommodating, an excellent combination when planning a wedding. If not for Casey, Forbes himself, and the rest of their unique and personable staff, we would not have had such a beautiful wedding!   It was almost unsettling how WELL everything fell together... aside from the cake, a few decorations, and deciding what to eat, the staff had everything prepared without much need for our support save the occasional decision. There was no delay in serving drinks, and food; everything was cooked perfectly with compliments all around. The island is wired for ambient music, and our choices synchronized throughout the island. We were concerned that some folks may find themselves seasick, but the island was stable, and Casey's team came prepared with ginger backups for us just in case.   Having a party or a once in a lifetime celebration? Forbes Island is the perfect place, not only for it's unique and fun environment, but for top notch service, professional and personable staff, and excellent cuisine. And if you just come to dinner, you'll probably run into us as new, frequent diners.   You can see some photos of the wedding at: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fbradyjfrey%2Fsets%2F72157627858419252%2F&amp;s=032eee4f4779e3d0f236108c0b5c87befaba61d86b806c6a5d1b2e841734249d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">flickr.com/photos/bradyj\u2026</a>",

I never knew Forbes Island was out there, but I am very happy I found it. \u00a0All the planning was done by emails, every email was promptly answered. \u00a0I thought it very unique, that the only access to the island was by a shuttle boat. Everybody enjoyed the ride. When we reached the island, we were greated by a very friendly staff. We had appetizers and drinks served in a reception room, \u00a0upon arrival, and then , when we were ready, proceeded into the \"Tahiti Room\" for our dinner.( I also hired Heather Rogers, a magician, to do some entertaining in the reception room. She was awesome,)There were no problems, complaints, delays, or dissapointments from anybody. The food was delicious, served on time, and as requested. I had a preplanned menu consisting of mshroom risotto, rack of lamb, filet mignon, and trout. The food was outstanding!!!. Afterwards, we received a cake, which was just as delicious.  Since I had prearranged everything, during the entire event, I was not disturbed by the staff with having to make decisions, which made it very enjoyable for me. My group of 23 left very happy.",

Maybe it was my own fault that I did not realize that I could get sea sick at this restaurant, but after watching the chandelier sway back and forth for 30 minutes and watching my husband pick at mediocre$16 tuna tartar, I could barely stomach waiting for my entree. My short ribs arrived paired with mashed potatoes (looked like it was squeeze out of a plastic bag) and spinach. \u00a0I took 2 bites and can only describe it as really really bad wedding banquet type food.  The most enjoyable part was the 3 minute boat ride to the island and back and the waitress was really quick about getting us our check because I needed to get off the island ... fast!  As San Franciscans, we realize that this is likely an attraction for tourists and I hesitate to call it a \"tourist trap\", but I assure you, there are plenty of other restaurants at Pier 39 that would provide a better dining experience.",

We did the online reservation and got there 30 mins early, and caught the little ferry that is just to the left of pier 39 (where people watch the seals!). The little boat ride over was so nice, the man was telling us all about Forbes Island and was very sweet.   They let us pick where ever we wanted to sit even though we were early and our meal was delicious! I got the short ribs my boyfriend got the Canadian Salmon. We had a few drinks which were very strong. It isn't themed in a kitchie way and had a nice warm fireplace and very lovely vibe.  Can't say enough awesome things. You are free to explore the small movable little island and get a kiss at the top of the lighthouse. I'm a local and this is definitely a great meal and awesome experience even if you've lived here your whole life. I have eaten at some delicious places and this is right up there. The only reason it isn't 5 stars is we had eaten at Morimoto's earlier in the week and that omakase blew me away. Forbes is not that good but it is very delicious (not just for being on a floating island) but just delicious overall.   THE RUN DOWN: Large portions, great bread and butter, main dishes and strong drinks in a romantic and warm atmosphere.",

Just don't bring Mom on the date. 1 star for the food.....limited menu, but incredible selections. 1 star for the experience.....\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\" caliber. 1 star for the staff.....they treat you like Robin Leach.  I just received a \"care package\". It had a sweater that will never get worn, a newspaper article about a man that fell out of a boat, a \"National Geographic\" about sharks, a pre-paid phone card so I can call her more often (ahem.....cell phone, Mom?), and coupons for Applebees so I can eat \"more sensibly\".",

    "review_text": "A very unique dining experience... Even though it's located at the most popular tourist attraction, it's definitely not one of the typical tourist traps. In fact, most of the people we've met at the restaurant were from San Francisco or Bay Area... locals, just like us. The boat ride to the Forbes Island makes the experience a little bit more special, but you don't feel like you are stuck there with no way out. The boat goes back and forth all night long. The food was excellent! We had tuna tar-tar and potato-leek soup to start with, and the sea bass special &amp; steak for the main courses. They also have a great dessert selection... very yummy.  In addition to the food and service the restaurant offers spectacular views of the city. If you go up to the light house (pretty steep stairs) do not forget your camera, you will be pleasantly surprised. The sea lions are right next to the island, so you can observe their funny behaviors from the deck. But when you are in the dining area (they have several of them) all the noise from the outside is gone, so you can really enjoy the food and the atmosphere.",

My girlfriend had the lamb and was also very very good! Had an apple desert kinda thing with gelato and was superb! Service was very attentive and great! Bill was $134 dollars with everything I mentioned and tipped our server $30 cuzz it was great service! After went up to the light house and had spectacular views of Alcatraz and everything around it! Definitely going here again and u should definitely check this place out :-)",

    "review_text": "Wacky but real, kitschy but elegant, there's more and less to Forbes Island than meets the eye. Some people will love it, some won't. Read on to see were you'll fit.  Your evening begins at a private dock right next to pier 39. There a colossal, suave and friendly 70 year old eccentric millionaire named Forbes Thor Kiddoo (I couldn't make that up) will ferry to his island in a large tiki-style \u00a0pontoon boat. \u00a0  Forbes Island is man-made and floats in San Francisco bay. It features a 40 foot tall light house offering great views of the bay and the city, a beach (covered with stepping stones for the benefit of women in high heels), three large dinning rooms, at least seven large palm trees and a white picket fence.  The main dinning room is concealed in the bowels of the island, under the beach and lighthouse. Its beautiful, done in Tudor wooden paneling, lit by a chandelier, warmed by a real fireplace and filled with tastefully selected nautical antiques. Portholes give you an underwater view of the bay, and a handy fish guide helps identify species outside the window.  The island is home to many amusements besides the basic French menu. The lighthouse provides spectacular views of the city and the bay, the island is fun to walk around and explore, a presentation on construction of the island is available and many of the dinners interacted with one another. Ask for a tour of the wine cellar, and I hear the woman's bathroom is definitely worth checking out. The wine cellar also has a cozy table for two you could try and request.  The food (menu here <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmenupix.com%2Fsf%2Fmenu.php%3Fid%3D120335&amp;s=92119e456977ed01d95adbe6b8d2924db8034b5995925690ebec98357a9c2bee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">menupix.com/sf/menu.php?\u2026</a>) is good but not great nor, at $75-100 a person, cheap. The boat ride to the island is cool, and so is the underwater dinning room. But the trip is maybe four minutes long (the island is only a 100 yards out, if that), and careful observers will note the dinning room is only partially under the water line (20,000 millimeters under sea in the words of one wag). All I actually saw through the porthole was some algae, but the rocking of the room might be enough to induce sea sickness in the ultra sensitive.  Should you go? Depends on what you are looking for. Here are my suggestions for some specific people:  Betty Boop... Yes!!!! Overdone and anachronistic but still cool and sexy, unique but comfortable in her own skin, Betty would be right at home anywhere on the island, especially on Forbe's arm.  SpongeBob and Sandy: Another perfect fit. I mean come on-- its a romantic island! They'd have a blast, and make lots of new friends. Ditto for Fred and Daphne, with or without Scooby.  Tony &amp; Carmella Soprano for a 'make-up dinner' after one of Tony's 19 year old blond extracurricular activities has come to Carmella's attention... No. Too distracting, too foreign an environment, they'd go old-school Italian.  Tony &amp; Carmella &amp; the kids when they want to bond: AJ would bitch about Forbes Island being too touristy (its not...but AJ's too stupid and superficial to see beyond the Fisherman's Wharf location), Meadow and Carmella would get into it, have fun, maybe even become friends with the girls at the next table. Tony would think it was an OK idea but would rather be at the Bing or having more extracurricular activities.  Dr. Evil with Mr. Bigglesworth and Mini-Me. Absolutely. \u00a0They could use the light house as a viewing platform to plot their domination of the city, Mr. Biglesworth would enjoy the fresh seafood, and the island has an airlock (apparently added to allow easy collection of abalone) built into its underside that could be used as an emergency escape hatch.  Anyone looking to throw a party, wedding, or corporate event to be remember: Yes. Forbes Island would make any kind of gathering fun and unforgettable. Added bonus... its an island so your guests couldn't sneak away.",

On deck before entering below for bar, food there is the captain's area, and then spiraling stairs to the top for lookout onto the bay, great view on the right day :). Heading down stairs it is subdued lighting, nice upscale ambiance. Interesting Frenchman at the bar. The food was good. Actually saw a couple fish and a crab near our portholes. The issue was the waving chandelier. I got sick, I went to the captains downstairs quarters aka ladies room and lost my lunch, again if u have any motion sickness issues just take something I think you will really enjoy.

So we waited around shopping and fighting the crowds. 5 o'clock came and i called, no answer. Checked their website and they didn't indicate being closed or private event nor did you indicate it on the gate or answering machine. 5:30 came and as we were leaving some rude french guy explained you were having a private event. Being that I had the last few days off i didn't notice the date on the reservation. I'm appalled at their lack of care for new business.

    "review_text": "I ate at Forbes Island last night, taking advantage of dine about town and had a wonderful time, despite the fact that they are not exactly the most veggie friendly joint!  Started with the butternut squash soup which happens to be one of my favorite soups despite the fact that this one was a bit over salted! \u00a0The entree portion was a little difficult since I am a vegetarian (and had told them when making my reservation!). \u00a0Our waitress kept trying to persuade me to order off the regular menu even though I was insisting I had come and made reservations for the dine about town menu. \u00a0After a bit of backing and forthing, which I will chalk up to a language barrier, she offered to make me a veggie platter: cooked carrots, peas, green beans and then a slice of both the potato gratin and broccoli/mushroom fluffy pastry. \u00a0The latter two were amazing, and while I enjoyed the veggies, especially since they were not overcooked and still had a delightful snap and crunch to them. \u00a0While enjoyable, I hardly think a couple cooked veggies and potato gratin comes close to the worth of any of the meat options available, but I suppose that's what I get for being a vegetarian? \u00a0The meal ended with a bang, however, since the chocolate mousse was very chocolatey but thankfully not overly sweet and hit the spot! \u00a0I will say that despite the little fuss in the beginning regarding a veg meal, our server was very friendly, attentive, and amicable!  I think most of the appeal was the location- AN ISLAND- and the experience of exploring it before/after dinner. \u00a0I highly recommend climbing to the top of the lighthouse to see a fantastic view and exploring the different dinning areas with other fantastic views of Alcatraz and the Pier 39 Sea Lions!  I will also note for those who do not know/did not read the instructions on their website, that you cannot actually WALK to Forbes. \u00a0There is a Forbes ferry taxi near the docks at pier 39 (or somewhat close by) that will take you there and back. \u00a0Also, for those of you who are easily motion/seasick prone, you can feel the waves beneath you as you dine.  Although the food is about average at best (in terms of vegetarian options at least) Forbes Island is a MUST for tourists and San Franciscans alike- if only once for the experience!",

Curiosity &amp; a special occasion gave rise to my inner tourist, which is in hibernation unless I am in a place that is more than a 4 hour plane ride away. \u00a0Its hard to think that Forbes Island goes unnoticed given the white lighthouse, a cluster of mature palm trees floating near Pier 39, and a boat moored next to it festooned with \"ForbesIsland.com\". Seeing it many years ago, I thought it might be the SF pied-et-terre of Malcom Forbes, who ascended to the Billionaire beach in the ether a while back... the same guy who's magazine still bears his name all these years later. \u00a0At that time, my curiosity didn't take me any closer in understanding what this odd site was. \u00a0Curiosity in the present, and a dinner reservation brought visions of being among the folks that love eating clam chowder out of a hollowed out round \"sour dough\" loaf, with some gleefully barking how beautiful the SF bay is.   Getting to the island:  There is a dock next to Pier 39, with a description of Forbes Island on a stand. Standing outside the locked wire gate, there are no hints as to how often the boat arrives or how to signal the boat to come. Serenaded by sea lions perched on their barges near by. \u00a0The boat arrives and we were then serenaded with a history lesson of the restaurant by the chatty 'captain' of the boat, a fun short boat ride to the island.   Dinner &amp; Service  3 of us for dinner. Filet Mignon, Sole, &amp; Iron Steak were the entree's. Each accompanied by a veggie, some sort of potatoes (scalloped ?). Nicely prepared and tasty. Service was exceptional. The environment is like being below deck on a (older) yacht, with plenty of wood and nautical themed decorations. The crowd was fairly diverse, with a leaning to that \"mature\" segment. Not a boisterous tourist crowd, it was ... pleasant.",

Park at Pier 39 parking lot and walk across the street to the docks.Pick up the phone and a gentleman will be on the other end asking you if you need to be picked up . He will then come on a little boat and pick you and your date up and shuttle you over to the island/restaurant.

Upon approaching the island, you notice the lighthouse and the small little bungalos \u00a0in which you can dine .

Ruggy J discovered this little island bar/restaurant right off of Pier 39 not too long ago and decided to turn Friday happy hour into Forbes Island Fridays.   Here's the lowdown: - Get down to Fisherman's Wharf. Look in-between Pier 39 and 41 - there should be a small floating island with a lighthouse attached to it. That's where you're headed. - There's a boat shuttle that takes you from the Pier to the island. It runs every 5-10 minutes or so. Wait there for them to take you across. Forbes (*the guy*) is the captain. - Head downstairs (below water line) to the bar. Sit down and chat it up with Pierre, the man behind the bar. He can mix just about any drink that you'd like, including some island themed cocktails and sparking wine. - Order some nosh if you're hungry. I'd recommend the bruschetta, complete with avocado, tomato and balsamic. - Don't worry if you feel a little rocking - it's normal. - Check out the ladies restroom. It used to be Forbe's bedroom. Very classy!  After an hour or two of rocking back and forth, I was starting to get a little woozy. But if you've got stronger sea legs, stick around for dinner. The island can accommodate up to 100+ guests at a time, so call ahead for a reservation and make it an unforgettable dining experience!",

The owner/builder of the artificial island met us at the dock to ferry us over and was very friendly. We called ahead for reservations and were seated promptly down in the dining room below the waterline. Our table didn't have a porthole but there was one right behind me. There was nothing to see though except green, murky water. Our server was knowledgeable and helpful. While the food was very good, there was a slight problem with one dish which we hesitantly mentioned and our server gave us a free dessert as an apology even though we neither asked for nor expected anything!   The island has 2 above-water rooms for private parties as well as a lighthouse and other areas to explore and walk around, but most diners will be downstairs in the main dining room. Between the slightly cramped but not uncomfortable seating arrangements, the slightly too warm and stuffy air and the fact that you're underwater, I could see how someone prone to claustrophobia might not like it. We were fine though. Also, occasionally the island would move slightly, probably when the launch pulled up alongside so, if you get motion sickness, perhaps a Dramamine or Bonine before dinner?  Of note, a lot of our fellow patrons were drinking quite a bit. This wasn't a problem in the dining room, but as we made our way outside there were a number of individuals being rather loud and obnoxious. One \"gentleman\" stood at the top of the lighthouse yelling down to his friends that he was going to spit on them. Classy. Hopefully this was just a Saturday night thing and I don't consider it a fault of the restaurant, but, if I were to go back, I might pick a different night of the week.   Overall, our experience was very positive and we're glad we went at least once. I'd encourage others to try it once as well.",

Forbes drove us all in this big boat to the island and it's quite an adventure. \u00a0I warned everyone in my group about not to expect too much from the food, hence we are all pleasantly surprised when the food arrived quite nice, about what you'd expect on a fine dining place. \u00a0The bartender also informed us that they have been participating in Dine About Town ($35 three course dinner) for 8 years now!  I definitely recommend checking out Forbes island esp during dine about town. \u00a0My group had a wonderful time and everyone was glad I did the research to find out about the place, as they never would have thought of going there themselves.",

I brought center pieces and the staff placed them all out for me, I did not have to do a a thing. All through emails Cassie the event coordinator was able to assist me in making this day special. My guests loved the island with the amazing views \u00a0from the deck to the top of the light house. There was even a room available to have a dj come set up for indoor and out door dancing. I loved how right when my \u00a0guests got off the bought they were greeted with beer, wine , and champaign. I would have another event here when the time comes.

I don't recall our waiter's name but he was a blond gentleman with glasses. The food, well the food was exquisite! We got the avocado bruschetta as well as the clam chowder. I didn't like the bruschetta but my boyfriend said it was great, I really loved the chowder (but you can't really go wrong with chowder). I ordered the slow braised ribs, I'm not a big red meat person but this was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend ordered the seafood special which was fish with capers I believe, also quite yummy!

After dinner, you cannot leave without having drinks at the bar. Pierre is one of the funniest bartenders I have ever met, and has a very heavy pour!! He makes a mean pomegranate martini!!   The view from the top of the lighthouse was beautiful, even on a foggy night.   It seems difficult to get reservations, but they told us a large percentage are no shows, so if you can't get a reservation right away, just call them again.

It's a French/American restaurant, so I was pleased to see that our waitress was French. The bread was served with unsalted butter, sprinkled with large crystals of sea salt as the French are wont to do.  Drinks were quite good.  Wife had the seafood chowder, I had the mushroom appetizer. Both were delicious.  For the main course i had a steak with a lovely sauce (again, French), cooked to a perfect rare as it should be. The wife had braised short ribs. Both were delicious.  Desserts were both great. She had gellato and I had the tart tatin.   it wasn't cheap... about $150 after taxes, tips, and drinks.   The main dining room is below sea level, and it's a bit small and crowded. Other rooms are above sea level if you rent them out for a large party.  Decor was lovely dark woods.

    "review_text": "Forbes Island Restaurant - A Floating Disappointment   As you gaze out from Pier 39 you might feel the chill of excitement at the look of the delightful looking Forbes Island Restaurant, for how often is it that you see a Light House perched on a tiny island with views which overlook the bay?  Today was the first and the last time I will step foot on that floating disguised boat, and I will not be sad about that. Instead I am more concerned at the high ratings such an unimpressive offer receives.  Magical as though it may look. Do not be mistaken. Unfortunately this is little more then a gimmicky American restaurant of which it's continued success rests on it's Disney like appearance and novelty value.  I was kindly taken out to dinner this evening to Forbes and as quaint as the little Island looked from the minute I walked down the plank to the pontoon and I met our pilot on a rather rusty looking vessel with dubious looking safety vests i began to have suspicions that this was not going to be a fairytale.   Based on online ratings, most people seems happy to ignore the fishy smell that greets you as you descend the stairs to what is described as underwater dining experience and is little more then a decorative boat hull with no windows only grimy portholes with coverings. The lack of light and motion of the boat may make some unwell, or perhaps that is to encourage drinking so as to ignore the awful decor. The other diners do not inspire confidence in shambolic attire. Surely a place which makes the New York times should inspire an audience of people who appreciate food? Luckily with an uninspiring yet reasonably well executed menu there isn't much to get excited about or not, unless of course your waiter some how hears fillet instead of salmon and then when the mistake is made takes some time before offering any discount or satisfactory remedy to the fact half the parties food is getting cold while a salmon is being found and thrown together.  I'm not fond of being preached to about the reviews of other critics either. Just because one person is prepared to be rocked into boredom does not mean I am for the price of a meal you could have had with a view and less of a smell.  My steak was fine but the smell of fish was so haunting I was distracted. The meal was at the price you would expect for novelty but not for quality. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they have only a serious interest in the structure of the boat as that is actually interesting - however can be discovered at a far cheaper price by reading the website.

I took a few sips hoping that the swaying feeling would just go away. \u00a0I didn't want to ruin his birthday either so I kept it to myself. \u00a0The appetizer we ordered came out... we had the crab, avocado and scallop salad. \u00a0I took one bite and felt like I was going to hurl. \u00a0The hubby knew something was wrong because I didn't want to eat the dish and it was all things that would be my favorite and he said it was really delicious too. \u00a0I told him I would be okay. \u00a0I just couldn't eat and I'll take my food to go and for him to continue eating. \u00a0He didn't want me to suffer so he asked the waiter if we could just have the rest of our meal to go since I wasn't feeling good. \u00a0The waiter totally understood and said not to worry about the rest of the meal. \u00a0He assured me as soon as I got off the island I would feel better and called the captain to come get us off the island and even suggested restaurants close by so we could have dinner at. \u00a0That was so understanding of him and he went above and beyond. \u00a0I got off the boat and took a 30 minute nap in the car and felt better but not 100% but I sucked it up and we ended up eating pizza for the hub's bday :( Sorry, babe!! \u00a0It's been about 23 hours since we left the island, and I'm still feeling a little nauseous. \u00a0   Other than that, everything else was nice... we walked to the top of the light house and had a great view of the city. \u00a0The ambiance of the place is so cute and romantic.",

    "review_text": "Great dinner date destination. \u00a0It was an unfortunately very foggy evening so I'm sure we weren't able to take in the \"better views\" the place had to offer. \u00a0  -Pick-up dock was easy enough to find. The boat comes and goes in short intervals.  -The boat ride was short enough to not be a drag but long enough that it added a fun exciting element to the overall experience.  -Our boat driver also acted as a guide and gave us a short rundown of the island/boat history as well as some tips. He highly suggested I visit the ladies room and \"take pictures\". \u00a0  -Our waiter \"Dakota\" was very polite, patient and polished. \u00a0  -Food. I had the lamb lollipops (suggested by a patron we met on our way in) and the boyfriend had the filet mignon. \u00a0It wasn't the best food we've ever had but it was delicious and filling enough. \u00a0Cocktails were decent and were definitely not watered down. \u00a0  -We dined in the underwater saloon and it was not at all aquarium-y like I pictured. \u00a0Very small windows and not a lot of them too so don't expect an underwater view. \u00a0Decor was pirate-y and little trinkets and things were scattered all over. \u00a0We had one of the tables directly next to the log fireplace and it gave us a little more privacy. \u00a0   -Not for people who get motion sick. \u00a0We felt the boat swaying (chandeliers were slowly rocking) as we were eating.   Overall, a fun dining experience. \u00a0Will definitely do again.  Ghellie and Alex",

When I got my entree, the mashed potatoes were good but a little too salty as well. The spare ribs weren't terrible, but probably not worth the $30. My husbands dish left him wanting more as well.

It's pretty hard to see any fish and I started to feel a bit sea sick before dinner.   Our waiter was super nice and professional, suggesting wines for those that did the wine pairing. I had the bell pepper soup to start which was good (but since I don't like bell peppers it didn't wow me) and the flat iron steak medium rare with potato gratin for my main course. The steak was sliced already and was actually slightly over cooked. The potato gratin was delicious, but overly cheesy on some parts. I forget what I had for dessert- a chocolate torte? of some sort but it was delicioussssss!  It was pretty cool how the bathroom was where the old cabin was.

I loved the big fireplace they had downstairs and the portholes that gave a view into the murky bay. It really felt like some sort of sherlock holmes meets pirates of the carribean experience.  We had a nice bottle of wine (they brought us the wrong one, a much more expensive one, but they didnt make us pay). The food was okay bu not super fab, we had steak which is hard to mess up. We climbed the stairs of the lighthouse and saw a great view of the city, and we loved waiting in the little lounge, sitting by the fireplace, listening to the sealions and watching mr. kidoo on a vhs of lifestyles of the rich and famous. rad!",

I had my hopes set high and I couldn't wait to take her there.  We finally found the boat that would take us to the island and it was everything that I expected. The whole atmosphere is amazing. If anything, I would go back just to go on the lighthouse again. Also, the women's bathroom was really cool! It had a really romantic feel to the place, I felt like it was the perfect choice, until the food came. I ordered the Filet Mignon and my girlfriend ordered the seasonal half rack of lamb. They both came with smaller sides that didn't have a lot of description to it, so you had to guess the ingredients. My filet was decent sized but it was pretty dry. Not worth the $40. My gf's plate was better her lamb chops were really good! Here's the bad part. Her order came with a bean cake(that was in the description) and she couldn't finish her food so I started to eat the rest of her food. When I started eating the bean cake I tasted something completely foreign. There was bacon in the bean cake(I can't eat bacon). I asked the waiter to be sure and he went and asked some guy who came over and was very insensitive about the subject, telling me that they can't put all the ingredients to their food on the menu because it was too much and told me there was nothing that he could do about it. Then slapped me with an $80 check.  I will never be coming back here ever again and I will warn all of my friends who have food allergens or can't eat certain foods about this establishment.",

Let me start by saying they actually charge for the 20 foot boat ride to/from the 'island'. I asked the boat driver if we could save money by swimming, but he didnt seem to appreciate the joke. I'll also preface my review by saying that it's one of the places I went with a rather ungrateful ex-girlfriend. She seemed to like it, but it was probably just because of the price :) The eating area is surrounded by various knick-knacks that reminded me of going to visit my Grandma. There was a huge fishtank in the middle that was fun to watch, too. The food was pretty good. It's your standard upscale fare; veggies, mashed potatoes, and steak. Pretty much your standard upscale fare for desert too, creme brulee, etc... \u00a0It might be a good place to take out of town guests who are afraid to try some of the better ethnic fare in San Francisco (or a date that is particularly impressed with spending a lot of money on dinner). For the price, it's really not worth it unless you're really hurting for a cookie-cutter romantic experience.",

I went here for my five year anniversary with the boyfriend, and I must say this was probably one of my proudest find, ever.   I wanted to do something different that year, so I decided to find a fine-dine spot with a gorgeous view. If you haven't been here, please do. I recommend it for first dates, celebration of an anniversary, or just a nice night out. It is the cutest place in the city, located on a man made island, right across from pier 39. You can actually see the island filled with bright lights from Fisherman's Wharf after sunset. \u00a0  You'd need to make reservation online, and I would recommend to do this a couple of weeks before your date. They're usually pretty booked. Once you get to Fisherman's Wharf, you would be transported to Forbes Island through one of their transit boats, and if dinner is at night, it'll be a breath taking view you won't forget.   The main restaurant is located underneath the boathouse, with a full bar (if I remember right) and since the restaurant is located underwater, do beware of motion sickness. When we arrived, we were quite pleased to be seated right next to a warm fireplace, since it's been raining out. We ordered Pan Seared Flat Iron Steak and the French Country Style Chicken, both were delish! For dessert, we had the Berry Napoleon with Mascarpone Cr\u00e8me &amp; Hazelnut Tuiles with an after dinner cocktail.   Their wine list was good. Plenty of selections on wine and cocktails to choose from. Now, the best part of the night is the gorgeous view of San Francisco on top of the lighthouse, outside the restaurant. It is definitely a romantic spot to cuddle with your lover on a cozy night in SF.   I highly recommend! I can't wait to come back here again!",

Garbed in pirate-wear, I embarked on a festive adventure to celebrate my friend's birthday. There were about 60 of us revelers spread across the island in two themed rooms ~ the Sea Lion Room had a fireplace to warm up chilly bones, a bar, and a great view of Coit Tower and Downtown. Across the way, we also claimed the Tahiti Room for dancing and cake cutting.  Be sure to bring something warm as you ascend the spiral staircase to the top of the lighthouse for a beautiful view of San Francisco. And, in case you're looking for relief, there's a captain's chamber on the bottom level with a plush bed. I passed through it to use the nautical lady's loo.

I had the flat iron steak and mushroom soup. Absolutely scrumptious. My family toured the island and went up to the top of the lighthouse to capture the stunning cityscape! I plan to return on a romantic date in the future! Overall, it was a fabulous experience. I will be returning for sure!",

    "review_text": "It was my boyfriend's birthday and I wanted to go somewhere different.  I chose Forbes because I heard some good things about it and how romantic the place was! So, I made a reservation 3 days in advance with all the notes about my boyfriend having a birthday celebration and would like to surprise him with maybe a small dessert just like what every restaurant does.  When we got to the restaurant, we were seated quickly but I'm surprised that they didn't ask our names for the reservation. So I told the server that we have a reservation but he didn't really pay attention to what I said and just asked us to seat wherever we want.  After dinner, this was when I got really sad because there weren't actually anything like small dessert for my boyfriend. Guess they didn't look at our reservation at all but it was too late and the server already handed the check. Still I was hoping that if they read my name on my card, they will remember that I did a reservation. But still, there's nothing. We left the place without any special greeting or something from them. So definitely, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOR SOME KIND OF OCCASION.   Despite of all that, my boyfriend and I still enjoyed the lovely views on top of the lighthouse but then again it could have been better, we could have experienced something a lot better.",

    "review_text": "Overall, I was disappointed by our dinner at Forbes Island. \u00a0We won't be going back, and I'd not recommend it to others.  FOOD The food is quite expensive (we paid $100 for two people) and supposed to be great, but my mushroom risotto was kind of weird (sweet and herby), and my husband's filet mignon was tender, but nothing special. \u00a0Definitely not worth the money.  And I know it's not a huge deal, but they don't have free refills on soda. \u00a0For such an expensive place, that is remarkably stingy.  AMBIANCE The \"island\" is actually a boat -- as in, it's just floating there and can be motored about and such. \u00a0The upper deck has a little lighthouse and some foliage on it and a miniature white picket fence (it all reminded me of an elaborate mini golf hole), and below deck is where the restaurant is. \u00a0  The restaurant below deck has some cool ambiance. \u00a0It's got pretty, dark wood molding on all the walls and lot of pictures everywhere in ornate gold frames, and the walls are all curved like the inside of a ship (which it is). \u00a0The restaurant was also much bigger than I was expecting, given how small and kitchy the top deck felt.  Also, when you hear that it's an island and that you'll need to catch the complimentary boat shuttle to the island, you picture a bit of a ferry ride taking you well out into the water. \u00a0This is not the case. \u00a0Forbes Island isn't out to sea at all. \u00a0It's right there situated amidst all the restaurants and shops and docks and such of Fisherman's Wharf. \u00a0There is actually a dock that extends out behind Forbes Island, which made us wonder why the shuttle boat was even necessary. \u00a0It seems as if you could just walk out there.  SEASICKNESS My husband and I both took two tablets of Dramamine roughly 40 minutes before getting on the \"island\", and I felt dizzy throughout dinner, and my husband started out dizzy and ended up nauseated by the time we left. \u00a0  For context, I usually don't get seasick (out of lots of boat rides, I've been dizzy only once before and never bothered taking Dramamine before). \u00a0My husband has been nauseated on maybe 50% of the boat rides he's taken, which is why I made sure he took some Dramamine.  SERVICE When we arrived, the shuttle boat was just pulling up. \u00a0Both going to and returning from the island, the shuttle boat was captained by Forbes Thor Kiddoo himself, owner and builder of Forbes Island. \u00a0That guy could out deadpan anybody. \u00a0I just could not tell when he was joking and when he wasn't.  We waited on the shuttle boat ten minutes or so while other customers arrived. \u00a0The boat was not heated, so it was a very chilly wait and then a short, chilly ride.  When we got under way, we instantly arrived at Forbes Island. \u00a0It seriously is so close to land. \u00a0If you had a good arm, you could stand on the shore and hit Forbes Island with a football. \u00a0This made me wonder why our cold wait on the boat for other diners to arrive was necessary at all. \u00a0  Furthermore, when we and 8 other diners arrived en masse at the restaurant, the space and waiters were not at all organized to deal with a bunch of different parties arriving at once, which must happen every shuttle arrival! \u00a0There wasn't an obvious host/hostess podium or waiting area or signs or anything. \u00a0We all just sort of crowded in out of the cold and stood in the middle of everything, not knowing what to do. \u00a0My husband and I got seated because I flagged down a waiter and asked if we were just supposed to seat ourselves or what.  After that, dinner service went fine. \u00a0Our waiter was competent and the food arrived in a timely fashion.  After dinner, there was a small, WARM room on the upper deck of Forbes Island with a fireplace where we could wait for the shuttle to go back. \u00a0And then it was a chilly ride back.",

    "review_text": "Not really an island but a boat decorated as one. It's definitely a tourist trap. I agree with others on here that have mentioned the nice themeing and experience of the restaurant (private boat to take you there, etc) but honestly, the food is not to be desired. It's nothing special and it's got no angle. We ordered the mushroom risotto, halibut cheeks special, ribs and flat iron steak...all felt a bit old and worn in the sense that it was nothing original and not much heart was put in it. It's got that 'old, tired, and true' type feel to it; reminded me of eating at the Blue Bayou at Disneyland where the menu's been there so long that it's just cranked out night after night.   When I think special, I think 'fresh,' 'unique,' and 'exciting,' which the food is not. It's a fun little experience for a premium price (total for what we ordered--no appetizers or deserts--was $160) that probably is paying for the fact that it costs so much to keep this thing afloat. \u00a0A lot of people were there for a birthday/anniversary; we were there just to celebrate the end of a vacation and got a free dessert--some whipped creme and strawberries--which was a sort of insulting touch (let's not bother with freebies if it's a passive aggressive way of saying 'thanks for not ordering desert')  I'd recommend it for a 1-time try, just to check it out, see what it's about (you have to have a reservation in advance) but I would not be one of the suckers who rents out the whole 'island'/boat for a special occasion.",

The chowder was very good. We heard their bread was awesome. But, we could not tell if the ones that we got was homemade or just something that they bought from a supplier. We had Wild mushroom risotto and Filet of sole for our entree. We also had broccoli and shitake mushroom puff. They were all very good. After dinner, we walked up the stairs to the top of the lighthouse and took some pictures. The view of the SF skyline was very good.

    "review_text": "I had a great first experience at this restaurant.   The entire experience here is really something a couple can really appreciate.  I don't really believe it is good for groups.  From being at Pier 39 in San Francisco, taking the \"boat shuttle\" to the secluded little island, dining in the dim dining room, then concluding the night by going to the top of the lighthouse to see the gorgeous view of San Francisco. Again why I would consider this something for a couple.  They do accommodate big groups and have a separate dining area for such.   The staff was is very friendly. From the guy who drives the shuttle boat to the waiters and bus boys--they really are on top of it.  There is no need to dress up as they clearly mention on their website that there is no dress code. However, once you are there you can see that dressing up suits the atmosphere--but again not necessary.   The butternut squash soup we had to begin with was delicious. The Pan seared flat iron steak was cooked to my request, and the gratin that is included was amazing. The chocolate mousse is very rich, so make sure you really are a true chocolate lover. The berry napoleon is simple yet satisfying. A nice treat after a good meal. My gf had great things to say about the salmon. I'm not much of a salmon fan, I tried it and it was good, but it's not something I can really comment or appreciate due to my bias choice of other entrees.  I would only caution those who easily get sea sick/motion sickness. You will have to endure constant swaying during your entire time.  This is not something I would frequent on a regular basis as it is on the pricey-side. But for special occasions and special dates, this is surely something that can be memorable.",

With 205 reviews though, I'd say the cat's out of the bag. This is one kitschy treasure of a tourist trap no SF resident should miss!   Find the designated phone and ring up the shuttle boat. You'll probably get picked up by good ol' Forbes Thor Kiddoo himself. I've never eaten dinner there, but I've found the fantastical surroundings to be just perfect for an adventurous happy hour with friends or quirky date-night drinks. The bar is under water and is decked out with a fireplace and every nautical novelty imaginable, there's a sandy faux beach up top, and there's a lighthouse that you can climb up inside of to check out the sea lions or bridge view if you're prepared to sway. You've just got to see it for yourself.   If you don't know the back story on Forbes and the island, it's definitely worth reading up on. It's a cool slice of SF history; that's for sure! Forbes built hundreds of floating homes in the Bay Area before constructing his own extravagant mobile mansion. The original version of Forbes Island was so posh, it was even featured on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous! He then had some trouble with permits and turned it into a restaurant. I think those are the basics?  Landlubbers, try your best to not to fall victim to motion sickness... or pirates. Arrrrrr! And speaking of pirates, I've heard Forbes has a bountiful booty of pirate jokes up his sleeve!",

    "review_text": "My first review of Forbes Island was written 8-9 years after I had actually dined there, so food details were more than foggy in my brain...they were non existent. My party of five (NOT the tv show) dined here this weekend to celebrate a birthday, so here comes the food lowdown (while it's still fresh in my memory):   My classic filet mignon ($39) was cooked just right--well done without being dry &amp; the 'truffled bordelaise demi-glace' tasted like a (more concentrated) fine wine. Broccoli &amp; shitake mushroom puff was like a quiche, tasty but a little salty. The tiny potatoes (three kinds!) were perfect with the steak.   Our bruchetta w/ avocado appetizer was delicious. Bread was toasted, but still soft-ish, balsamic was sharp &amp; the tomatoes were well-seasoned.   For dessert, I went with something I NEVER fancy---an apple tarte tatin with an awesomely thick rum caramel sauce &amp; a thick whipped cream. Highly recommended!   I stole a few bites of bf's food: flat iron steak &amp; potato pur\u00e9e was very good, although I think the mustard cognac creme sauce was a little too 'strong' for his liking. And a few bites of my mom's dessert: the berry parfait-- so simple but very good.   Other dishes our party ordered: braised short ribs, soup du jour was red pepper, &amp; a crab, avocado &amp; scallop salad--all winners.  (sidenote: I was quite thirsty &amp; a little headachy after our meal, probably due to its high sodium content. Salt-tards beware!)   Still love eating on a floating island. If you're prone to sea sickness, take a Dramamine 2 hours before dining here.",

We talked to the bartender about renting the island for a party, can't wait for that to come to life. It's nice to go to a place that has such wonderful customer service.

What's not to like - the rum cocktails were delish and the lines short - and the mostly veggie snacks were as good as any such shindig or chantey I have been to.  Forbes Island is a treat for all - pirates and lubbers alike. Aside from the splendid vitals, there are lower quarters, decked out like a ship (with a bar and tables), a \"real\" lighthouse with spectacular views, and a wheelhouse (for Forbes is a floating island, equipped with the largest outboard motor ever made, fresh from WWII).  And it;s packed, every inch of wall and room, with nautical and historical memorbilia - plenty for any scurvy chum to spend a charming afternoon or evening relaxing by the bay!  I would recommend you set sail for The Island sometime - and ask yer boatman, Mr. Forbes himself, for a brief history of how she came to be in such a lucky location!   Haaar!",

I'm not sure if it was just an off night for the chef but unfortunately it was pretty much unbearable.  I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and I was super excited for two weeks before the big night but the food ruined the experience for us. We ordered the clam chowder, avocado bruschetta, potatoes au gratin, a fish entree, and the duck - and all were too salty except for the duck meat. Even the potato pur\u00e9e was loaded with salt! We were shocked. All I imagined was some little chef dancing around throwing salt everywhere in the kitchen. The highlight of the meal though was when our waitress brought out this AMAZING cream dessert, compliments of the restaurant because we had come for a birthday. Kudos in that area!  The total came to 127 but because our waitress was the best I also added in 25 for tip. I had even left my card on the table and she ran up the entire flight of lighthouse stairs to where we were to get it back to me. It's too bad the food was not what it should've been. I would give it another try but for that price, I wouldn't chance it.",

We were starving by the time we got there since we walked around the pier for a while before getting on the boat that takes us to the island. Waited for the boat and met Captain Forbes. He is super nice and funny. Explains to us the history of the island and how a seal wiggled himself on his boat.  The island looked romantic with the lighthouse and everything. I was hoping to be seated downstairs under water but our party was too big to be down there so we were seated upstairs. That was OK though since the firework display was right in front of us.  After getting seated, we all just either went to the bathroom since one had motion sickness after drinking too, some went to explore, and some went to the lighthouse and took pictures. Super awesome view but too much stairs and it was such a windy evening, I thought I was gonna get blown away off into the sea by the wind.  Started to look at the menu and the choices were limited for $65 but still offered soup or salad, and entrees that include chicken, steak, salmon, and risotto, and two different desserts.   I of course chose the Crab Bisque Pan Seared Flat Iron Steak: Porcini Mushroom Cr\u00e8me Sauce, Scalloped Potatoes &amp; Green Beans Chocolate Mousse: Hazelnut &amp; Pecan Crust Cake topped with Whipped Cr\u00e8me  Crab bisque was serve lukewarm, not good but came with lots of crab meat. Flat iron steak was really good an cooked perfectly. Big portion and the scalloped potatoes were so good. crispy top! Just how I like it. The porcini mushroom sauce was way to heavy and taste like they used 100lb of butta! Chocolate mousse was good but way too decadent but the hazelnut and pecan crust was amazing yummy.   (I tried the Organic Pan Roasted Salmon: Cilantro Pesto Rice, Saut\u00e9ed Spinach &amp; Ginger Lime Cr\u00e8me Sauce. This was so awful. Tasted only ginger and the salmon was super dry!)  I only wish I hadn't of stuffed myself with bread and butter so that I can at least eat more then 2-3 pieces of steak!  We were served by Eve and she gave us probably one of the best service I've ever experienced. Super nice and very apologetic when it came to us having to pay $200 just for corkage on two Remy bottles! You kidding me! Friend called and ask about the corkage and they said $25 flat fee and when we brought the bottle out, stupid, owner/manager said it's $200! Crazy! But Eve was nice and just kept apologizing about the situation....  My experience this one time is probably enough and I wouldn't come back",

It is very warm and cozy. And they have rooms you can reserve for your whole party. Pretty cool. There are port holes all around and you are actually part way under water. The light fixtures sway a little, but you won't notice that much. Casey was our waiter. He was so attentive and cute too! I had Avocado,olive and tomato bruschetta for an appetizer. Hubby had seafood chowder. NIce presentation. It was quite tasty for both items. For dinner, hubby had chicken and i had Risotto with mushrooms, zucchini and onions. YUMMY! We had a really nice wine too. Then, for dessert, Ginger Vanilla creme brulee. With a candle. And the waiter gave me a rose since it was my birthday.  I personally believe this restaurant is for adults mainly,but, if I had a 16 year old daughter, she would LOVE IT! I loved it. The couple next to us loved it and were celebrating a birthday too. (hey, I think they should get married. Cute couple. Carlo and Sofia!) The prices are high, but hey, go two times a year, splurge have fun!  Well, anyways, we are very glad we went here.

Off in the misty, dark-sky distance, your eyes land upon a beacon of light projecting from a lighthouse.   Beneath the lighthouse there seems to be a house. But not just any house. This decorous houseboat seems to blend true house with boat. And then you learn, it used to be Forbes' house that's since been set afloat.   Before you actually get there though, you have to find the phone that offers a direct line of contact between the dock on Fisherman's Wharf and the bartender awaiting you on Forbes Island (a somewhat decadent house on a barge with a lighthouse that functions as a restaurant and modestly-stooled bar).  Once the call is made, a transit boat will arrive to offer complimentary transport to this often-overlooked dining mine.  Once you arrive, you'll be tickled to know you can actually hike up the circular stairwell to the top of the lighthouse for a 360-degree view of SF (yes, you can see the lights of Alcatraz), you'll be able to use the restroom in the regal dormitory that Forbes once occupied (yes, you can lay on the bed), you'll pay attention to the varying ambiance throughout (either bask on the deck on some chaise loungers or scurry inside to the kingly dining room with ever-swaying chandeliers). Anyway you slice it, Forbes Island is an experience unlike any other.  The best part, Forbes will often be your boat captain. Make sure to ask whether he's been married.",

P.S. remember this is a man made boat dock. \u00a0The Boat rocks back and forth at times which is kind of strange.   The first time I went the boat was so hot we were sweating the whole time. \u00a0It was so uncomfortable. \u00a0  The food was in portions that would not feed a bird, and for unreal prices. \u00a0  Someone had given us a great bottle of wine; very expensive, and the corkage fee was $25 which is getting to be the norm.   On each occasion we went home hungry and ate a couple of hours later.   The food was pretty good, just in portions that were comical.   The short ribs were juicy but a little fatty and the portion was ridiculously small. \u00a0  I love salmon but the sauce with spinach and ginger battled with the flavor of the salmon and didn't go with it. \u00a0  The entrees are $28-39 and the servings are a joke to be honest. \u00a0I've been to the french laundry and their servings are very small but there are several courses.

They ask that you sit and await the small boat to arrive and take you to the island. you walk down the ramp to a little waiting area with an island feel (small palm trees aligned and a few bench seats).   When the boat arrives to pick you up, make note that this is a man made island and the owner is the one getting you to your destination. The boat is enclosed, so you wont get wet if it's raining out. When you arrive at the island, you are encouraged to explore the light house and other areas of the island as you will be dining below water.   The food and wine is delicious, and the wait staff is happy to make recommendations. one thing to note, the island sways a bit while you are dining, so this is not the place for you if you get sea sick.",

It is a man-made island floating just outside of Pier 39. The owner Mr. Forbes Kiddoo captains his boat to take you to the island himself. (At least this was the case about six years ago.) Catchy huh?  Once you arrive on the island, you can do a little tour with the main attraction being the lighthouse. There is an upper level dining room reserved for private parties. The dining room itself is submerged under water and fashioned like a large yacht.   The food quality is not bad but the experience is more of the selling point. It has been over 6 years since I have been here so please don't hold me to it.",

And after walking around Pier 39, I finally decided to go to that floating island. \u00a0We didn't have any reservations and called ahead to see if we could sit at the bar.  After walking to a small gate between Pier 39 and 41, we picked up a phone and dialed for our Captain to come pick us up. \u00a0We waited only minutes before a boat came and picked us up and about 2 minutes later, we were at Forbes Island. \u00a0The whole experience was absolutely unique. \u00a0Our Captain gave us a tour of the island...after looking closely at some old photos in frames across the restaurant wall, we quickly realized that our Captain was the owner of the restaurant. \u00a0  The bar is rather small and intimate and seats about 8 people. But the bartender was very friendly and told us all the history of the floating island. The restaurant is also very intimate and filled with mostly couples or families. \u00a0This would be a great place to take your mother for a birthday dinner or go on a romantic date. I only gave 4 stars since I didn't actually eat any food. \u00a0But I definitely plan on going back and making a reservation soon!",

I'm so glad my boyfriend surprised me with this place for our anniversary because it's definitely a worthwhile experience for everyone to try... except for those who are aware they get motion sickness.  It's pretty fun to take the shuttle boat to the one and only floating island. The decorations for the island is cool. Once you dock, the captain leads you down the stairs to the restaurant.  The service is great. Our waiter was friendly and checked in on us a lot. The other servers were just as good.  Since the island is floating, you can actually feel the place swaying every now and then. I tried not to think too much about it and focused on eating and chatting to avoid getting motion sickness. It's honestly not too bad, but might be during poor weather conditions.  The food is nothing spectacular but there's still some parts of my meal that's memorable for me.  My recommendations: - Dungeness crab, avocado &amp; bay scallop salad: avocado tasted fresh, baby tomatoes were yummy with the orange/citrus fennel vinaigrette. The vinaigrette for this salad was absolutely delicious. I loved it. - Potato puree: the mash potatoes were so good. Nice, creamy and fluffy. You can order this as a side to go with your entree.  For the entrees, we ordered the Pan Seared Flat Iron Steak and the Slow Braised Short Ribs. If I ever come again, I don't think I'm going to get these entrees again. Instead I would try something new like the salmon or filet mignon. The steak and short ribs tasted good, but not fantastic. The portions for the entrees though were bigger than I expected.  I ordered the gelato for dessert. It was okay, but I should've got fresh berries to go with it. I would suggest ordering another dessert.  After our dinner, we walked around the island. There's very nice views of the Bay Bridge and SF. We even got to go on top of their lighthouse to see an even better view. It says \"No smoking,\" but people still smoked!  We had to wait a while before the shuttle boat came to take us back to Pier 41. It's not that big of a deal though because we kept ourselves busy by looking around the island and taking pictures.  My boyfriend and I got really thirsty for the rest of the night after we ate here though. But I would still recommend this place because it's a fun experience to have.",

    "review_text": "Took my wife to Forbes Island for her birthday dinner and this place really hit the spot. We don't usually travel to the city to eat but this place made the trip well worthwhile. It was very unique in the sense that nobody could walk up to it like at Pier 39 restaurants so it almost has that secluded effect on you at night since it's only people that are eating there that can get to it. The guy that runs the Shuttle was really cool, Gave us all a break down on how Forbes Island came about and the history behind it. From there you continue on a minute and 30 second ride or so to the barge, Yes I said barge because that's what it's built on and he directs you to your dining area. The dining area was really cool, If you are claustrophobic it may not be the best idea to eat here as there aren't really very many windows and the aisles are sort of tiny to walk down but I am and I made it through the meal fine. We both ordered filet mignon \u00a0and it was the best I ever had. Not sure what they put in the butter but that stuff was pretty damn good as well. Once we finished the meal they validated our parking which made parking in the garage free which was cool avoiding a $9/hr fee and we walked around a bit and checked out the lighthouse up above. Very cool if you wanna snap some instagram or fb pics before you leave.. I read some of the reviews on here prior to going and I guess depending on how important you think you are you may find the service bad or a notice a dirty fork but all in all if you are a sensible human being and don't need the celebrity treatment for the money you spend and are capable of walking too and from the shuttle and also willing to communicate with the waiter/waitress if you need new silverware you should be just fine.",

    "review_text": "I came here with my girlfriend this past Valentine's Day. It's very exciting to ride across in a boat to the restaurant... which is actually another boat! A+++ for unique experience and ambiance. The actually restaurant is a lot bigger than it looks, due to the fact that a large portion of it is actually under water! There are little portholes you can look through... although you probably won't see much, the water is murky.  Very classy place, the menu was a Prix Fix for V-Day that started off with an excellent crab bisque. We then each had some sort of salad with a vinaigrette dressing that wasn't bad, but unmemorable. My girlfriend had the halibut and I had some sort of steak... both were good, the portions were huge! Mind you... we were also filling up on delicious Belvedere Pomegranate Martinis and other such extravagant and unnecessary cocktails... especially for being on a boat! Which leads me to my next point. You can feel the boat rocking! Kudos to the servers for totally handling it as the ship swayed back and forth. I was starting to feel slightly sea sick at one point, but surprisingly drinking alcohol HELPED.  There are a lot of cool little rooms you can explore on the \"Island\", such as the \"Captains Quarters\" which sports a bed, piano and everything! The bathroom has a walk in shower... which makes me believe someone DOES (perhaps the actual captain?!) or used to permanently stay there... or I guess all of it could be for show.  Outside you can actually climb the lighthouse and catch the view, which is nice... but in 6\" spiked heels I didn't want to stay up there for too long with the heavy winds (and previous heavy alcohol and food consumption). My only complaint was that we had researched the menu online and they had never updated it from the previous Valentine's Day, and there were a lot more options on last year's menu. I'd try it again...",

You start off by taking a nice boat ride to their floating boat island! Yeah you heard me right...this restaurant is on a boat just floating along out there. So it's definitely an experience. Once there you go down below deck to an small intimate dining space. It's very darkly lit, and has a fireplace and little windows where you can occasionally see fish swimming around. Or in our case one fish just staring at the window for the whole two hours we were there.   You should know that sometimes you will feel weird, since the boat is kind of rocking around. I had a weird reaction to it but it wasn't that bad.   Our server was very attentive and helpful. She made some great suggestions, and immediately offered to replace my drink when she noticed I wasn't drinking it.   The food was also very good. I got the salmon and thought it was cooked very well. I really really loved the sauce that came with it.   While there I saw a wedding party show up, and a man who I'm pretty sure was about to propose to his girlfriend...like I said super romantic. I feel like it is something that everyone should experience once while at the pier. I mean as far as touristy things go, eating delicious dinner in a floating boat island is pretty great!

The boat is driven by NONE OTHER than Captain Scruffy, who we discovered, is Forbes himself. He built the island. And lived on the island/floating house for years.   2) Captain Scruffy (Forbes, come on people), is perhaps the sweetest, cutest old man I've ever met. Think a kinder, more lovable professor from Gilligans Island.  3) The Island is complete with a lighthouse, which makes for memorable and beautiful San Francisco night views.   4) The Seals. Ohhhh the seals. As one of the people in my group who happens to be obsessed with seals said, \"they just want hugs and kisses,\" as we sailed away from Forbes, listening to the Seal's night calls.  5) The rocking of the \"boat:\" Yes, during dinner, a few times, people in my group pondered how screwed we would be if a monsoon were to strike. We enjoyed our dinner while simultaneously enduring the storm winds.  Initially, I went into this whole experience assuming Forbes Island was a fun and unique tourist trap. While it is extremely fun and oh so unique, it is certainly not a tourist trap. In fact, as our waitress explained, many locals in San Francisco come to Forbes (many of whom didn't know it existed before, like us).   And I must say, the food was very good. I had a perfectly dressed mixed greens salad with pickled onions, a lovely medium rare flank steak with a mustard sauce and potatoes au gratin, and a delightfully sweet chocolate mousse cake with hazelnut crust and fresh whipped cream.   Our waitress was incredibly knowledgeable about the history of Forbes Island and her enthusiasm for the special place only made our adventure at sea more memorable.   I can't wait to sail away to Forbes Island again, hopefully soon. I will bring more friends this time to share this perfect \"only in San Francisco\" experience with.",

The food and service were good. We were wary of the butter and then asked about the black stuff, which was sea salt - not caviar. We all had beef dishes. The filet was superior to the flank steak. Our desserts [creme brulee, mousse, and apple tart] were not nearly as good as our meal, but we nejoyed them nonetheless. The validated parking was $15 off of our $21 bill - not bad at all!

IT'S A-   So you go down into the belly of the boat to eat. You can see out the portholes (fish swim by! real fish!) and occasionally you feel a wayward sea lion bump into the boat. It really doesn't move - there's only a tiny, barely noticeable gentle rocking with the tide. The eating quarters are fairly snug and romantically lit. Did I mention there's a full bar?

We started with the short boat ride to the \"island\" which is awesome because being in this area makes you want to go on a boat, even if it's a short ride. \u00a0When we got there they started leading us to the dining room below deck, and we asked if we could stay above-ground. \u00a0I can't believe I am sharing this, and I hope it doesn't ruin our next trip, because out of four visits our preference if by far above-water. \u00a0The main dining room is in the main part of the boat below water. \u00a0There is two small twin dining areas above-deck, that seat (and this is probably a bad guess) 12?, 16? \u00a0The best parts are the (A) Views!: \u00a0You can see 360 degrees total, and the view of the actual city of SF (with my terrible math estimates) is well over 180 degrees. \u00a0Then there is (B) Privacy: granted, this is where the guests arriving or leaving on the boat gather, but in between those trips you have a good-sized dining room to yourselves. \u00a0The dining room has a fireplace, a sliding door out to the beach (albeit \"fake\"), and amazing views of SF, the lighthouse, and the sea lions. \u00a0You know what? \u00a0Dining above ground sucks! \u00a0I would HATE this review to stop anyone from eating in the main dining area (cuz that might fuck up are next trip there!)  I think the food is AMAZING. \u00a0Granted, I am not an SF food snob, but I know what I like. \u00a0I have been here 3 times now, and my favorite is the Filet Mignon with Truffle Sauce and some kind of Shitake Mushroom/cheese/broccoli souffle. \u00a0We have liked everything that we have eaten here, but this is by far our favorite, and it is consistently on the menu. \u00a0In a normal, boring restaurant, I wouldn't want to pay more that $20-$30 for this meal (or ANY meal), but when you are somewhere this amazing, I think the $39 is definitely worth it. \u00a0People Yelp about the price, but they \"guess\" it is okay, given the atmosphere, blah, blah, blah. \u00a0Well, I'd love to know of a better SF experience? \u00a0Where else could you have such an amazing view? \u00a0The amazing boat ride over? \u00a0The delicious food? \u00a0Oh, and I haven't even MENTIONED the lighthouse yet. \u00a0An amazing man-made lighthouse that you can climb up to further enjoy the view and the novelty of the restaurant. \u00a0  The more I write this, the more I hope you pay attention to the \"douche\" who calls anyone who would give Forbes Island 5 stars a \"douche\". \u00a0I hope all of you out there will decide to pay attention to his reviews and spend your money on what he considers amazing food and ambience. \u00a0Forbes Island may have all of the makings of a tourist trap, and as a born and raised Bay Area native I want it to be all mine.  Did I mention how awesome it is to use the loo and find you get to go through the Captain's Quarters into his personal bathroom? \u00a0Did I mention how beautiful this place is, with views, decor, you name it?   P.S. Wow, the 3-star review where the guy wrote that anyone who gave it a 5-star review is a \"deprived douche\" or something of that effect is probably the first review that has ever made me angry. \u00a0I don't want to waste too much time on it, but he is one of those awful-douches whose profile says he is from \"San Francisco\", yet it is clear from his reviews he lives in the San Mateo/Burlingame area. \u00a0Hey, dude, go back to whatever OTHER place that you are form, because true Bay Area natives are a true (and unforgiving towards douche-bags) critic.",

If you come here however, take the opportunity to explore the island! The deck is nice and relaxing with lots of tables and soft chairs. The top of the lighthouse is great and the view of the SF Bay is a nice sight to see. Also, GO TO THE BATHROOM. Just once. At least. Just do it. It's an adventure getting there.

When I asked my mom if she had anywhere in particular she wanted to eat at, she mentioned Forbes Island. She then asked me if I had ever heard of it, I said no, and she said, LOOK IT UP WHEN YOU GET HOME! Fast forward to Sunday, the day we were going to eat here - she must have asked me about 5 times if I had looked it up. In my head I kept thinking, ok, I get it, we're going to a restaurant, but why do you keep asking me if I've looked it up (cause I hadn't).  When we get to Pier 39, parked, and walked towards the pier and I saw Forbes Island, I realized that I had noticed Forbes Island before from the pier and was curious about it. I still remember seeing it and thinking, well that's interesting! And, how do you get over there? When I realized this, I understood why my mom kept asking me if I had looked up the restaurant - because it is out of the ordinary.  When we got to the pier, others were boarding the shuttle so we just followed. The boat ride over to Forbes Island is less than a few minutes, but I enjoyed it a lot - it's been awhile since I've been on a boat! Once we arrived at the island, I was immediately curious to see the rest.   The island is very neat - fun to explore around for a bit, the dining room is also cool - very thematic which makes it a unique experience. The women's restroom on the dining level is also a fun aspect of the place - when you walk in, it looks like a captain's quarter, with a bed, functioning shower, sink, and toilet. Neat!  What's even better on top of everything is that the service, food, and drinks are great. The 5 of us ordered the Salmon, Petrale Sole (seafood special for the night), Skirt Steak, Chicken, and Chocolate Mousse. The seafood was very fresh, cooked right, and sauces were delicious. I also tried the chicken - the chicken was very tender, juicy, and also delicious. Chocolate Mousse here is AWESOME.  We all had such a great experience here. It definitely made for a fun, entertaining, unique, and yummy Mother's Day celebration. I would recommend this place for dates, special occasions, or if someone just wanted to take another person out for a fun time.",

You find the phone, pick it up, and they send a boat to pick you up and take you to a man-made island for dinner. It turns out your boat pilot is none other than Mr. Forbes himself, who made the island back in the 70's as a private home across the bay, and later turned it into a restaurant and towed it to San Francisco, expanding it and making it even better.  There are dining rooms on the island, as well as a light and boat house, but the real treat is downstairs, where you step into a fantastical setting from a very creative mind. Portholes illuminated to glimpse the fish swimming by, and decor that is surreal, fireplaces, a great long bar, and plenty of 2 and 4 top tables.  The bar is excellent, the martini's dry, the scotch wet. Imbibe and enjoy  and then there's the chow: no so good for vegetarians, but carnivores will delight in the offerings. This is not haute cuisine, 4 stars to be sure, and priced accordingly.  Did I mention that you can see and be seen by sea lions? Wow!

Forbe's Island.  I have no idea when this plan was hatched. It was probably right after we got off the RocketBoat (did you hear me? I said go right now!), which was right around my sister's 29th birthday. We docked near this intriguing bit of land mass called Forbes Island, and grandpa suggested we return one year later for my sister's 30th birthday. As you loyal readers already know, when grandpa says jump, I say how high? Done and done.  I'll get the picky stuff out of the way. Food was meh. Could have used more seafood in the seafood salad, and the reference to spinach in my otherwise good salmon dish would more accurately be described as a hint of spinach. Mango sorbet was delicious, all very expensive.  But you are not just paying for food. You are paying for Forbes himself to shuttle you from dock to island in his boat (not a bad gig), as he answers the same questions for the thousand times in the same jolly manner as the last trip. You are paying to feel the occasional sway of the restaurant as you dine underwater. You are paying to eat on an island in SF proper.  As my grandma so eloquently said when audibly yelping the experience: \"you get a boat ride.\" True that grandma.  And what you can't put a price tag on, and what will make this meal memorable no matter what, is that around the table were my grandparents, my mother who often has to be dragged kicking and screaming into the city (she'd say the same thing about me to the east bay - love you mom!), my always game stepdad, some of our closest friends and the star of the moment, the best sister anyone could ever ask for. Don't believe me? Do a search of my yelps for \"brunch battle\". Plus, she posts things on my Facebook wall like \"Can't wait to read your Forbes Island yelp and would also like to inform you that my favorite outfit of yours (my 29th bday party) was replaced as of yesterday (my 30th bday dinner)!\"  A four star dinner/experience in honor of a five star sister.",

So order \u00a0a piece of cake, and do it yourself, you will be in control. The place is so cool, I could not believe such a jewel existed here in Northern California. Parking is close by in the garage, you do take a short boat ride to the restaurant with a funny grouch captain, he adds to the adventure. Our port hole had little fish swimming around, and our table was adequate for dinner. The waitress was very nice and it was well worth the money. It's a unique adventure that you will not forget.",

    "review_text": "All in all, an experience NOT TO BE MISSED in San Francisco!!!  A few folks on Yelp who previously reviewed Forbes Island, as you can see here, mentioned that it was uber-touristy. That was not our experience at all, believe it or not. We went on a Saturday night, at around 8 pm, and there was no one \"touristy\" to speak of in our company. In fact, one of the things I liked MOST about this place was that it was not crowded, rather it was totally relaxed and mellow. There was a total absense of that \"get you seated, get you your food, and get you out\" vibe that so many restaurants unfortunately send out these days. When I go out to dinner, usually I like to chill out and plan on it taking a few hours. We were definitely able to do this at Forbes Island.  Aside from all that, I really loved a lot of aspects of this place. You really feel like you are on vacation and have been transported to another time and place! It's rad. The food was pretty good, not outstanding, but I didn't mind because I was was so completely wowed by everything else! It IS quite expensive (no entree under $25) but keep in mind that you are probably paying for more than the food...for example, the fact that you are eating dinner on a boat that is designed as an island with a sandy beach and a light house!!!  I don't think that too many people actually know that Forbes Island is a dining establishment, which in turn is why it is perhaps so pleasant to dine there!   If you are tired of going to the same places for dinner in SF, and want to really mix up you routine, go here! It would be especially nice for a celebration, birthday, etc. too!   five stars for the entire night at Forbes Island!",

The food was excelent. I ordered the bell pepper soup and I know when you add cream to anything it's good but this was great. \u00a0My husband ordered the seafood chower and it was delicious. \u00a0Dinner was the short ribs and the pan steak both wonderful and full of flavor. The potatoes that come with the meals are to die for. \u00a0  We ended with dessert of chocolate mousse which was worth every calorie. \u00a0  My only negative was the martini i ordered was too strong to begin with and thenw as watered down. \u00a0I hated wasting $9.00 on something i didn't drink.  After dinner we went to the top of the light house and took pictues and spend a few minutes in awe of the view while we waited for the boat to take us back to shore. \u00a0  I have recommended this restaurant to all my friends and family and can't wait to go back again next time i'm in San Francisco.",

One of the best kept secrets in San Francisco, located at pier 39, but don't let that scare you. \u00a0As a San Franciscan you probably do everything possible to avoid pier 39, however, Forbes Island is well worth it. \u00a0The restaurant is located on a floating island by the seal lions, but to get there you need to hitch a ride on the Forbes own water taxi. \u00a0A small boat picks you, and other dinners up, every 30 minutes near the entrance to pier 39. \u00a0A 5 minute boat ride brings you to Forbes Island, less than 100 yards away, but only accessable by boat. \u00a0Enjoy a great meal then when you're ready the boat brings you back to the pier entrance. \u00a0I've been lucky enough to eat here 4 times, and each time my friends and I have had a great time and fantastic meal. \u00a0The help was always attentive without being stuffy. \u00a0Check out <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fforbeslsland.com&amp;s=bdcc4bd5dbc7dfaa4791f0fd9aa9f5cee802f66bc89b313cc95c4afa55661684\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">forbeslsland.com</a> for more information.",

Other than the two hiccups, it was a wonderful experience. \u00a0We took a \"water taxi/shuttle\" to the island and the boat ride was about three minutes, very cool indeed. \u00a0Not sure if I'd recommend ladies to wear high heels to this island. \u00a0Read on to find out more. \u00a0:P \u00a0The food was absolutely delicious. \u00a0I had a Clam Chowder, Filet Mignon and tried some of my friend's avocado, crab meat, and baby scallops salad, and the dishes were all divine!! \u00a0Our server is a lady who was originally from Ukraine (didn't get her name). \u00a0She is personable, friendly, nice, started a conversation with us, and made us feel welcome. \u00a0  Since Forbes is a floating island and the dining experience is \"under the water\", make sure to be prepared ahead of time if one is prone to seasickness. We definitely felt the movement and the swing, though not dramatic, could be enough to cause motion sickness.  After dinner, we took 55 steps to get to the top of the lighthouse and the panoramic view of the city was absolutely gorgeous and impeccable, could get windy though, so make sure to layer up. \u00a0Forbes is a secret spot that most people have never heard of, including myself. \u00a0My friend heard about it on the radio and that's how we found out the \"island\" in the first place. \u00a0I would highly recommend Forbes Island if someone is looking for a sweet and romantic date night or celebrating a special occasion. \u00a0We went there to celebrate a Birthday and all of us had a great time. \u00a0I'd very much like to go back next time again. \u00a0:D",

    "review_text": "No one goes to a restaurant around Pier 39 area just to eat. \u00a0You're going for some touristy reason; \u00a0you want something nutty, something scenic, something San Francisco. \u00a0Forbes Island is a great place to meet your \"something special\"\" needs. \u00a0  You leave the madding Fisherman's Wharf crowd for Forbes Island via a 3-minute, low-key shuttle-boat that putters you away from strollers, dogs, and loud happy people. \u00a0When you land, you look back on the Pier 39 craziness, and it looks beautiful from 1/10 of a mile away. \u00a0So does the San Francisco shoreline and the Bay. \u00a0  But, you're here to eat, so you go downstairs, somewhat below the water line, to a warm, wood-toned room for a small menu of well thought-out and competently executed dishes. \u00a0It's nice food, above being \"okay.\" \u00a0And, the room layout and atmosphere are snug and friendly.  The full, but not lavishly stocked, bar features moderately priced drinks that help you de-stress from the shoreside excitement you've left behind. \u00a0Our meal was served by flawlessly friendly, low-key staff. \u00a0We were allowed to linger and enjoy the evening. The halibut cheeks were tasty and better than I expected. \u00a0I've seen other comments that complained that the food isn't \"special\". Well, it's better than what we make at home, and, frankly, I was surprised at the quality for a restaurant at this touristy location.  When we left the restaurant we explored the lighthouse and other views as we waited for the boat back to tourist central.  TIP FOR LOCALS: \u00a0Forbes Island is NOT impossible to get into, even during high tourist holidays. \u00a0We reserved a week ahead for the Saturday evening of Fleet Week when there was an America's Cup Race trials on the Bay. \u00a0We boated over to the restaurant with a couple that were \"walk ins\" who were seated without delay.  Forbes Island is on our list for repeat visits, especially for those days that involve out-of-town guests who think that they have to go to Pier 39's attractions in order to say that they'be seen San Francisco.",

The restaurant is actually a floating island, complete with palms, sand, rocks, a lighthouse, and buildings. \u00a0There are a couple dining rooms up on top, but the main dining room is below deck. \u00a0It doesn't offer any view, but it's a very cozy experience with Tudor paneling, a fireplace, and portholes through which you might catch the shadow of a fish swimming past.  I can't say enough about the service--extremely warm and friendly! At one point we asked about a local landmark, and our waiter brought another over (who knew the area better) and she spent more than five minutes chatting with us and sharing tips. \u00a0  The food was excellent. \u00a0I had a flat iron steak. \u00a0The cut was only okay, but the preparation was excellent. \u00a0My wife felt her salmon ranked among the best she's had in her life. \u00a0For desert, both the Chocolate Mousse and Berry Napoleon were terrific.  If you go, a certain amount of patience is recommended. \u00a0You frequently have to call for the pontoon boat to pick you up, and we waited for about 20 minutes for the boat to return to deliver us back to shore.

But then again my Man never fails me so I followed him to the edge of Pier 39. There was a phone and a dock that said Frobes Island. He made a call and then the cutest little ferry/boat/whatev appeared. The cheerful Captain opened the gate and led us to the boat.   The boat ride was fun. Our driver was actually the owner of the restaurant. Funny guy! I guess he owned the island and had it moved to the edge of Pier 39 and turned it into a restaurant.   3 minutes later we arrived to the island. I got off the boat saw the huge light house and both me and my Man thought how did we never notice this? We took some cool pictures and headed inside.   You walk down a couple of steps and step into what feels like the inside of a boat. All wood walls small intimate tables. You are actually below water and will not have a view but the whole thing is just too cool.   The drinks are okay but the service was great. I had the soup which was yummy and the salmon as my entree. Overall the food was not all that. A little overpriced for the quality but what your really paying for is the experience.   Other cool stuff:   - The Ladies Bathroom has a bed inside of it. Great photo op! - The Lighthouse: they totally let you walk all the way to the top and the view is amazing.

This place is not about YOU. \u00a0It's not about YOU spending money and expecting an experience. \u00a0Forbes island is about a man and his dream, his life and his island. \u00a0He happens to be willing to share it with you and it really feels like a labor of love. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, he's not giving shit away for free, he's out to make money, and gimmicky or not, this is how he chooses to do it. \u00a0How many of us really love what we do??  His website is awesome so check it out and pay attention to the directions. \u00a0I didn't and walked in a giant circle. \u00a0Forbes himself drives the shuttle boat and will give you a brief tour and history of the island. \u00a0I suggest you read about it on the website so you don't show up dumb like me. \u00a0It really is very fascinating. Next time I go, it needs to be the summer time so I can actually enjoy a sunset and sit outside.  Jeff had the dine about town options - salad, salmon and chocolate mousse. \u00a0It was all very yummy. I had the mussels - which were delicious and probably the best I've ever had. \u00a0They were tender and juicy and would be the highlight of this place if it weren't for the fact that it's a floating island and all that. \u00a0For my meal I had the filet mignon which is what I had the last time I was here (3 years ago) and it's as delicious as I remembered it. \u00a0For dessert, I ordered the mixed berries - also delectable. \u00a0I was bummed that they were out of the creme brulee and the apple tart desserts, but the 2 we ordered made up for it. \u00a0  The actual dining area was small but cozy. \u00a0Well place mirrors made it appear larger. \u00a0Although it's cozy, the size of the tables themselves are generous enough that you don't feel like you're eaves dropping on the breakup conversation happening at the next table. Definitely don't come here with people you can't have a conversation with as service was a tad slow. \u00a0It took a while for us to get our menu's and bread, but once our waitress introduced herself to us, she was the model of service and friendliness. The actual pacing of the meal was on the slower side (hence why it's imperative you bring a good conversationalist along).   In summary, I had a very nice meal here which was in addition to the novelty of being on a floating island. \u00a0Those ultra sensitive to motion sickness should stay away - it's very slight, but you definitely will feel it rocking.",

    "review_text": "I'd have to say this is my favorite \"date restaurant\" by far. It makes a wonderful surprise (as long as you make sure they don't get seasick beforehand), and the whole process of taking the boat to the island and touring around it is a lot of fun before being seated in the below-decks dining area, which is very romantic.   I've been there several times, and I absolutely love the filet mignon. It his been cooked perfectly every time ordered.   I'll never cease to be baffled by the reviews on this site marking this restaurant down for ridiculous things such as windiness, seasickness, or \"touristiness.\" I've been a bay area resident most of my life, and I didn't find it touristy in the slightest, in fact it seems to be hiding in plain sight as far as I can tell. All the cheesy glitz around the pier hides a great place for yummy food and a lovely, quiet romantic dinner. I even saw one criticizing the place for not having more underwater \"windows\" otherwise known as portholes. Yeah, there's this thing called structural integrity. I don't want to die, at least before I finish dessert!  As for critics who really harp on the price, yeah it's a bit on the high side if you were to compare it to some place on the street selling the same food. However, if you're frugal to the point where this is a huge issue, (really, it's not) then honestly the thought behind taking your significant other out somewhere special is probably lost on you anyway.  For everyone else, definitely don't miss out on this place, especially if you have someone with sea-legs that you'd like to show a great time.",

A couple things to keep in mind before you go: unless you've seen the little Forbes Island boat shuttle thing while strolling the Embarcadero, it's going to be hard to find. My boyfriend and I walked up and down the Pier by 39 a couple times before giving up and calling the restaurant. They said to look for a yellow boat and they're right next to it. Sure enough, there is was. The Forbes Island dock is TINY. Come early to make sure you're not super late like we were. Also, if you're prone to motion sickness, take some meds first. My boyfriend got fairly sick and couldn't wait to get off the island by hour two.   The food was just okay. I think I liked Forbes Island for the experience more than anything. But, if I we spent regular money on it, I'd give it only 2 stars. We were lucky enough to go during Dine About Town.",

What i didn't expect was how the restaurant sways ... i mean obviously it would be you're UNDER water!   Our reservations were at 5, we had requested a private area (as it was our wedding anniversary). Normally, when you request a more private seating and inform them its your wedding anniversary, they accommodate. \u00a0Instead - we were seated in this teeeeeeny corner, amongst all other patrons :( we might as well sat with them because the tables are so close!   Trying to overcome the seating arrangement, i sit down and look at my wine glass - it wasn't cleaned, there was LIPSTICK marks on it.   Aside from the swaying of the restaurant (which got me woozy), and the dirty glass... the waitress we had was super sweet and they brought us our food relatively quick. I had the salmon and husband has the filet. Dinner was good, dessert YUM, their wine selection could be more extensive.   The light house is nice (ladies, beware and do not wear 6 inch heels).   Overall, ive been to better places and most probably wouldn't be going back here.   cheers!",

Birthdays for us are a special celebration - every year I try to top the last and have been successful thus far.  Three things to know about my fianc\u00e9. \u00a0He loves water, he loves fish and he loves to eat - \u00a0voil\u00e0! \u00a0Forbes Island was the perfect match!  We arrived at Pier 41 just before sunset and made our way to the boat docks where we were immediately welcomed by our Captain. \u00a0At this point, the fianc\u00e9 was quite confused, which I happily reveled in. \u00a0It is a short boat ride to Forbes Island - a floating restaurant on a man made island. \u00a0Before dinner, we walked up the lighthouse steps and watched the beautiful sunset from the top. \u00a0The views are amazing and quite worth the lighthouse hike in 3 inch heels.  The restaurant is actually located underwater and is quite impressive. \u00a0The English Tudor decor and lighting all create a romantic ambiance. \u00a0We were seated next to a porthole and while toasting to another great year, would occasionally see little fish swim by as my fianc\u00e9 grinned from ear to ear.  The food is also remarkable. \u00a0Classic French fare went very well with the mood of the milieu. \u00a0Sea bass and filet were ordered, along with more spirits and birthday dessert.  The highlight of the evening was spending time with the owner of Forbes Island, Forbes Thor Kiddoo. \u00a0He has lived quite the impressive and interesting life. \u00a0I highly suggest speaking with him as his life stories are fascinating and unique!   The birthday dinner was a success. \u00a0It was the perfect evening at the perfect restaurant .. mission accomplished.",

I've never been on any kind of boat before, and he made sure I was comfortable getting on and off the boat. He escorted us down to the dining area and we were seated immediately. Our wait staff was friendly and on top of everything. The island itself is adorable. There is seating upstairs of the boat to hang out and as soon as we were waiting to be picked up at the dock the taxi boat came back in no time.   The food was great - we had a mushroom sort of appetizer that was delicious. I had filet mignon which was cooked just right. My husband had some sort of fish and I remember it being quite good. It was all very romantic and although it was pricey, I believe it was worth it.   As others have said, if you are prone to get seasick or not used to being on water, it may not be a good idea. I didn't get sea sick, but the rocking of the island was something to get use to. Overall it was a very fun experience. I'd probably come here again.",

I have no idea how they pulled that one off. If they'd have gone the kitchy route Forbes Island would, for better or worse, be a San Francisco landmark on par with the Tonga Room, but somehow the builder's resisted and kept it beautiful, but still plenty fun.  Great food, great cocktails, a memorable experience. If I had to offer some constructive criticism I'd say the bread could use improvement, but hey I'm a bread snob.

An amazing view of the city, and embarcadero to Russian Hill. Truely one of the best views there is...with the chill in the air and the barking sea lions. Just a treat. The lighthouse is fun as well.  The food...Well just captivating and very delicious.  I had the wild mushroom ragout with goat cheese on crostini as an appetizer...OMG so good. Wasn't too hungry so went with the dungenous crab/avocado and heirloom tomato salad and the clear broth seafood chowder.  The salad was simple, crisp, cold and delcious. The non-cream seafood chowder was really one of the best i've ever had.  packed with shrimp, scallops, mussels, salmon and spiced so that my tastebuds screamed in delight. \u00a0Couldn't have enjoyed it more.  The waiter who is a cross between bradley cooper and a young richard gere, is super friendly, knows his menu, and wine list and is pretty easy on the eyes as well...:-)  So we will definately be back.

We arrived at the Wharf, and proceeded to spend almost an hour attempting to park - remember that Saturday in July? \u00a0AND a nice day? \u00a0Dumb dumb dumb. \u00a0We finally did park though, and after playing tourist, I guided the wife over to the docks, where we almost immediately caught the boat to take us to the Island. \u00a0We arrived, and made a beeline for the lighthouse. \u00a0VERY cool pics were taken. \u00a0Definitely an awesome idea!  We explored the island a bit, and finally went past the waterfall to go downstairs, where we were quickly seated. \u00a0We ordered some wine and perused the menu.  Quick note - I saw MASSIVE comments/complaints in Yelp reviews about salt permeating everything. \u00a0Well, I beg to differ. \u00a0What it DOES permeate, admittedly, is the butter. \u00a0Hand made using sea salt - definitely an interesting (but not bad) taste on the (of course) sourdough bread. \u00a0Neither of us tasted any other heavy salt use.  The wife ordered short ribs, I ordered sole - along with the avocado bruschetta for the wife and a salad for moi.  The appetizers were served quickly and were quite good. \u00a0The meals followed, and while the sole was a bit bland, the short ribs were perfect.  Overall, AWESOME place, with tons of atmosphere. \u00a0In fact, the only real ding I can give this place is that the primary dining area is just frigging warm. \u00a0It was well above 80...simply too warm.  One other quick side note - I saw a couple of complaints about seasickness. \u00a0Yes, you're on a boat (or a floating island...whichever). \u00a0But it's a frigging BIG boat. In a harbor. \u00a0With about the only real water movement being the change in tidal flow every four hours...and that's pretty minor. \u00a0I seriously don't think you're going to find this to be an issue (if you do, you probably should not be anywhere near water...move to Kansas. \u00a0Really). \u00a0 ;-)",

It is a must for a visitor to San Fran - get a reservation at least week or two before though! It is a unique, fun dining experience that you will really enjoy!   Make sure you go to the top of the lighthouse - if you time it right, you can get an amazing sunset view!   The well prepared food, the funny and engaging staff, the cozy atmosphere of dining underwater and bathroom that you could only get to by going through a bedroom, make this a really fun, exciting dining experience.

Had some trouble finding the dock, but when we got there.. our captain and boat was readily awaiting us! Some jokes and two short minutes later, we arrived at Forbes Island.  Went downstairs to the restaurant slightly below sea level and was greeted by the host with the French accent. I told him I had reservations for 7-- but he couldn't find me booked in anywhere! Errr... what?!!  \"No worries\", he said, \"Why don't you ladies go check out the lighthouse first, and when you come back we'll have a table upstairs set up for you.\" Ahh thank you sweet Frenchman!  We climbed up the spiraling stairway of the lighthouse dangerously in our heels to overlook the wharf and sea lions. Funniest quote of the night... a lady pushed us aside and asked \"are those whales?\" LoL.   And as promised-- our table was ready in their upstairs dining room overlooking the ocean. AHH how romantic... we felt we were sailing on a cruise ship/boat or something too. We would have enjoyed the meal more if we didn't feel the swaying motion. But after awhile, you either get use to it and feel it less or just get sick. *NOTE: request to be seated upstairs... downstairs is just wayy too dark and stuffy.  We all either had the salad or soup (which was roasted red pepper for the day), salmon or steak as our entree, and chocolate mousse cake or berry compote as our dessert choice. Nothing innovative or creative about the menu options -- \u00a0just plain good old American faire! (aka hearty portions, clean, straight forward ingredients).   Not the most memorable meal, but definitely not a forgettable one (if that makes sense). Service was excellent all around. Our waitress was sweet as my chocolate mousse cake.   Will I come back again?   You bet I will for Dine About Town. In my book, its one of the better Dine About Town deals!   And seriously.. how many places do you know that require you to take a boat to a restaurant and lighthouse on a man-made island?",

If this restaurant did not have a gimmick and was not located at Pier 39, there is no way it could survive. \u00a0However, thanks to the tourist trade, there is always a fresh influx of innocent, unsuspecting victims who are hooked by the concept of a restaurant floating and tied up at the end of the pier.  Once you are seated and the novelty wears off, the food starts to appear and reality sets in. \u00a0From a culinary standpoint, the food was a major disappointment. \u00a0The lamb was overcooked and mealy and overall, the entire experience was like a bad continental dining nightmare from the 70s. \u00a0Even with diminished expectations, each time we dined there, we just could not believe how bad the food was. \u00a0 \u00a0  In a culinary town like San Francisco, known for its dining, Forbes Kiddoo should be made to walk the plank for this culinary disaster, this homage to gastronomic embarassment. \u00a0Even better, he should be forced to dine in his own restaurant. \u00a0  Thank gawd Yelp gives diners a way to see what others think before trying out a new place. \u00a0I only wish is that Yelp would allow me to give a rating less than one star, how about half a star? \u00a0Now that would be appropriate. \u00a0Concept: 3 stars, Food: 1/2 star  Check the other people's reviews written about this place and lend credence to the negative ones for those are the ones telling you the truth. \u00a0I can't believe this place still exists. \u00a0There oughta be a law.",

I know, words you do not want to read when researching a place for a potential DINING experience.   The boat was super cute and the sailor (is that the right terminology??) was super super nice! \u00a0The island, very pirate-ish. Yes. I took pictures.   The food, was absolutely not impressive by any means. \u00a0We didn't get offered the regular menu, like all of the other people did in the restaurant. I ordered a pinot noir and got a glass of white instead - did you think I was color blind?! Victoria C. ordered a Coke and got Pepsi, without a forewarning... so the night was off to a bad start.   Our salads came. To our surprise, it was decent, pleasant. We liked the salads. \u00a0Then our main course came. What a waste of potential good food. Victoria C's chicken was dry. That is unacceptable. \u00a0Both Leona Z. and my steak ... well, let's just say there was no consistency whatsoever. \u00a0We both ordered it medium, mine was mooing and hers was just a little too overdone. It was chewy - gross, and almost the worst steak I've ever had at a fairly nice restaurant. \u00a0Dessert impressive.   So food wise, with ambiance, maybe 3 stars. But because our waiter was such a jerk and didn't give a rat's @$$ about service, this review gets down graded to 2 stars.   Lesson: If you want a romantic date, or just experience eating dinner under water - this is the place to go. The ambiance of the whole night was worth the experience, just once.",

We started the evening by waiting alongside pier39 to get picked up by their boat in order to get to their \"island\". Note: this is not a real island...more like a huge floating mass that appears to look like an island.   After a short 5min ride, we docked onto Forbes island. We were directed to the seating area but also welcomed to explore their lighthouse and outdoor space.   The lighthouse was cool having a wonderful view of the bay, sf skyline, and surrounding pier. This was the highlight of the night.  The restaurant was in the lower level underwater. The sea/nautical theme was very prevalent in this area, looked kinda dated and dirty.  The dining experience was ok, not really tasty just filling. Also, since the island was moving and you're seated underground, for me it made me a bit nauseated and have not that much of an appetite.  In conclusion, good place for a cocktail, view, and interesting new kind of ambience----not that great for dining (especially if you're motion sensitive).",

The high points: the tiki boat, the perfectly roasted chicken, the unbelievably good desserts, and the fact that we could hear the sea lions on Pier 39 while we ate. Oh, and Forbes Kiddoo himself gave us a tour.   The not-so-high points: the price point (I guess it covers the gas for the tiki boat) and the faint swaying that made one of my companions a little green around the gills.

We showed up right as the captain pulled up to the dock to ferry us and another couple over to the island. At this point my darling man had no idea what was up because for the first time in my life I managed to keep a surprise a surprise. He was thrilled.  Our first impression of the island was how frickin cool is this! It was a lasting first impression. Our mantra over the course of the evening was \"how cool is this\". Completely done up in tiki stylie with live palms and plants!  We were promptly offered a table downstairs (which looked cool w/ the murky light coming through the portholes) but chose to sit up stairs. Seriously the best view: Bay Bridge, city sky line and lights reflecting on the water. Loved loved loved the view.  We did the DAT menu with a salad, flat iron steak and berry dessert. All fantastic. The salad was fresh and light. We ordered our steaks medium rare and they came out medium rare! Love that. I know it sounds cheesy that we ordered the same thing but please allow me to justify. He always gets the steak option and I usually get the fish/chicken/whatever else. Then I get serious steak envy. So this time I threw caution into the wind and got the steak; am very pleased w/ my choice. I did add some salt to my meal but I prefer to be in control of salt content anyways so it was all good. The berry dessert was absolutely wonderful. A standout for sure. The berries and sauce were not too sweet and definitely had some tart while the cream was a perfect complement. At a lot of joints the dessert is sort of an afterthought and doesn't compliment or live up to the rest of the meal. This dessert was a star. Disclaimer: I am not a sweets person so it is really out of the norm for me to rave about sweets. This was that good. Our meal was well paced and served by Laurie. She was a really wonderful server. Attentive but not over bearing, she made sure we were comfortable and happy during our meal.  After dinner we wandered around the island and climbed the light house. It is really quite nice to have such a funky, unique spot here in the city. I am already thinking about how I can get back out there. BTW, I laughed all at all the captains jokes. There is just something extra hilarious about nautical humor. Remember, don't miss the boat!",

You can call ahead to make sure he knows your arrival time. I surprised my girlfriend who had no idea what was going on, or who I had called, until he pulled up at the dock. The boat ride over with the Cappy was easily the best part. He's like a professional comedian. He says he lived on the boat/island for 16 years in Sausalito with \"Nothing between me and the sand except a skinny native girl.\" What a great business owner, great story, awesome night, and fantastically unique idea.  The food is pricey, and although plated beautifully it isn't amazing, but the boat is. It's just so much fun you really don't care about the price. I definitely recommend the Avocado Bruschetta. Our waitress was courteous, knowledgeable, and sweet. The expo and bartender too. What a great staff!  I can't believe more people don't know about this place, and it really feels like a well kept secret. It's a great ace in your back pocket when you want to impress. It would also make a great private venue.   I don't know if it was just that it was really really windy out when we went but the boat rocks slightly and the dining area is down below, so if you're prone to sea sickness you need to skip this adventure.

A staple of San Francisco. A staple by Vivek S (attempted to pierce skin, but failed because I am a man). More though... a staple of one man wanting he wants -- himself, an island. If there's one place to have one drink in San Francisco, it's a Hendrick's Martini made by Pierre at this bar. By the end of the drink, you'll order another. The island's engine turns on. You float away from what you know. Your own moveable feast. You have what you need -- a martini -- and you have what you are -- an island.",

Anyway, we spent a lot of time getting to know Forbes Kiddo while sipping on martinis at the bar. \u00a0I had known of him and met him once long ago when his Island was in Sausalito. \u00a0We had a fabulous dinner (the wild mushroom ragout was to die for). \u00a0  Always the first to arrive and the last to leave, we didn't break from tradition. \u00a0We ended up partying on the Island until the wee hours of the morning (5:00 am). \u00a0We had the time of our lives. \u00a0It was an adventure I will never forget! \u00a0I recommend this place to anyone. \u00a0It is very unique. \u00a0Thank you Forbes and all your staff!",

I ordered scallops for my appetizer and got 1 scallop and a shit load of fennel around it. The steak was good but was the size of a plum. Overall the food was good but the amount wouldnt fill up a bird.",

    "review_text": "* Update: Forbes Island restaurant has announced that they'll reopen this Friday May 17, 2013. Since the main dining room and kitchen below are intact, they can resume operations a week after the fire. I'm sure that they need the revenue to cover the repair costs. The damaged upstairs dining room will eventually be replaced in the future. And who knows, perhaps even improved by some remodeling.  ********** Just a PSA in case any readers have plans to dine here, that this floating restaurant is temporarily closed due to a fire on May 10, 2013.  Last night or early morning (before 5am), an accidental fire (possibly a table candle overturned) incinerated the dining room above deck. No one was injured. The rest of the island-boat seems intact.  The owner started developing the concept in 1975, and construction was completed in 1980. It was his floating home in Sausalito, for the first twenty something years, and then repurposed into a restaurant more than a decade ago. No idea how long it'll take to rebuild.  Not a good dining choice for anyone who gets seasick, otherwise the novelty can be a memorable and romantic experience. I attended a family affair a long time ago, I don't remember what I had for dinner. The dining rooms above deck are small, but u get great views of the bay. Below deck, the main dining room features vintage nautical decor and a central fireplace, but the room is dim. It's a place u come for special occasions, so menu prices are not cheap. Current entree prices are around +$30 each. And the 4-course Valentine's day special prix fixe is $85.",

    "review_text": "March 31st...It is my 55th birthday, so I wanted to do something a little different. I heard about Forbes Island from KOIT radio station, looked it up online and thought it sounded unique. I read alot of the reviews here on Yelp, expected to find a \"different\" type of restaurant with just O.K. food. I was happy to find a beautiful setting with unique decor, service was great (our servers name was Tricia), the food was delicious.  We had a party of four, reservations were at 6 pm, and we ordered from a special menu called the KOIT Passport. It was a special they were running for the month of March. This included a 3 course meal: 1st course, your choice of soup or salad, all 4 of us had the salad...wonderful taste, nice mix of greens and beautiful presentation. 2nd course, entree, 2 had the Salmon on a bed of rice, covering spinach, they said it was great. My husband and I had the Pan seared Flat Steak with a sauce, and served \u00a0with au gratin potatoes and veggies. Very flavorful, cooked perfectly, the potatoes--to die for! Excellent!!!! 3rd course, dessert, all of us had the Chocolate Mousse and none were disappointed...YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!! In addition to the 3 course meal, we also had 3 courses of wines paired with the food....again, perfect!!!! I would certainly recommend this restaurant to anyone and will most definately go again!!!! My only disappointment...it was raining and I would love to have seen the sun setting. Be sure to make the climb to the top of the lighthouse, what a fabulous view!!!! If you get motion sickness, I would recomment taking something, you are on a boat and there is rocking.",

The service was very attentive, the locale is wonderful and the dining area is spacious. \u00a0It takes a while to get used to the sometimes less than gentle rocking (not scary rocking, just noticable).

    "review_text": "On a COLD and CLOUDY night, my family decided to take me to a dock on Fisherman's Wharf for a birthday \"surprise.\" \u00a0If I didn't know any better, their \"surprise\" seemed more like a staged kidnapping. How frightening! With storm clouds looming over us and no one in sight, it seemed like one of those scenes out of a horror movie. You know, the one where a predator or some mystical figure pop out of nowhere to terrorize those poor, poor innocent souls.   As we waited on the dock, one of my sisters frantically looked for a phone to summon a shuttle boat to take us onto an \"island.\" Incidentally, if you're trying to escape from a predator, don't waste your time looking for the phone because it's subtly hidden (so, it might take a little while of searching before you find your \"life saver\"). After waiting for 5-10 minutes, our little shuttle boat came to whisk us away, and guess who our captain was? That's right, the owner himself. He was extremely nice and incredibly funny. That was a pleasant surprise! But, at this point, I was still a bit apprehensive because I wasn't exactly sure where I was being taken to. For all I know, we could have been heading towards another Alcatraz.   Once we entered the restaurant, which is in a makeshift boat and is located below deck, I felt like we had been transported to another time period (perhaps to the 70s era). That being said, this adorable little place (and its nautical-themed d\u00e9cor) was super cozy, and the ambiance was great (albeit a little dimly lit for me)! They have different dining room themes that you can be seated in: Main Dining Salon (which is underwater), Tahiti Room, or Sea Lion Room.  Everyone was so nice here. The hostess greeted us with a nice, big smile and our waitress was more than accommodating. Our waitress was hilarious, making our dining experience there AMAZING! She also made great recommendations (glad I went with her suggestion), which was a plus. Not to mention, she came by often to check if everything was alright. One of the best customer services I've experienced.  If I had any doubts about this place, they were definitely gone by the time I took a bite out of my food. Their clam chowder was perfect for a cold day, and it was absolutely delicious. It was so creamy and rich, and the flavors were excellent. The organic Canadian Salmon was even more splendid. The creamy and tangy sauce that comes with the salmon was absolutely mouthwatering, and the salmon was cooked just right (it was so moist and tender). I wanted to order something for dessert, but I was so stuffed by the end of the meal, so I had to forgo that. (Although their menu is a bit on the pricier end and their portions aren't huge, their food is amazing and is worth the price!)  After finishing your meal, don't leave too soon. Before departing the \"island,\" you should definitely go up to the lighthouse. I know that the last thing you want to do after finishing your meal is to make your way up a flight of stairs. But, believe me, you won't regret it. Once you've reached the top of this spiral staircase, you'll be rewarded with a breathtaking view of San Francisco. It's a perfect picture-taking moment (and you could even possibly share it on Instagram or FB...you know you want to). \u00a0  If my family ever wants to kidnap me to this eerily place again, I'd be more than happy to volunteer myself. It's definitely a dining experience you should experience for yourself. \u00a0   Tip: If you're coming here for dinner, make RESERVATIONS because this place gets pretty crowded (you can call them or book it online). Also, you might want to make reservations well in advance because they do get BOOKED UP really quickly.",

With all of the ambience, we figured it was not going to be about the food - so were very pleasantly surprised with our dinners - they were delicious, fresh fish and nice desserts. \u00a0We both had the special sole, and cr\u00e8me brulee for dessert. \u00a0  Don't miss a trip to the ladies' room - it is entered through the cabin of the man who once lived here - full of antiques and lovely -even the male guests peeked in to enjoy the ambience of this place. \u00a0We really enjoyed it.  As others have said, the little dock is not immediately apparent, but not too hard to find from the pier and worth looking for. \u00a0We totally enjoyed this place.",

    "review_text": "A friend of mine mentioned this restaurant on an Island and I was instantly intrigued. When my bf's birthday rolled around I instantly made a reservation.   First and foremost, this is a pretty touristy place. It's smack in the middle of Fisherman's Wharf. Granted, they validate parking for 2 hours at the Pier 39 parking garage so it wasn't too bad. But the hoards of people made the experience getting there a little painful.   After parking, we saw the restaurant and I was disappointed to see that it was literally a few feet away from the dock. Uh....why can't you just build a bridge so you can get rid of the boat ride? Gimmick. Again, I was disappointed by how beat up the boat was, not fancy or romantic at all. And the ride was literally 3 minutes long, so there were no views to enjoy whatsoever. A waste of time in my opinion.   We ended up sitting in one of the tiki rooms, which had a nice view of the water and the sealions. But occasionally when the wind blew we could feel it swaying. People prone to seasickness beware. The food actually ended up being delicious. It was nothing innovative; just solid hearty dishes. Service was fantastic and we ended up learning alot about the history of Forbe's Island. We also walked up the lighthouse and explored the main dining area that's actually submerged underwater.   Overall, the price for the food alone was a little high. But you are paying for the touristy gimmicky experience and history, which I surprisingly enjoyed alot. Pretty sure I will not come back unless I'm with someone from out of town, but it's something worth checking out once if you live in the Bay Area.",

Food was overcooked-had to flake off the top of my salmon from crispy underside. husband ribs were also lightly burnt. Waitress showed up only for order and didn't check in with us the rest of the time. $12 for half shot of amaretto. The finish was waiting 30 min outside in the windy cold for owner to take us back across. Had to go to bar where owner was chatting it up and advise that we wanted to go. Waited another 15 min for him to drag himself topside. No tour of \"island from anyone\". Better views and better food to be had elsewhere!!!! \u00a0p.s. forbes your busboy -friendly and efficient-was the only saving grace to your place.",

    "review_text": "Forbes Island is an experience. My boyfriend surprised me by bringing me hear to celebrate Valentines day earlier.   We took the first boat/trip to Forbes Island at 5pm among a couple of other couples. Expecting to go far (somewhere met Alcatraz), I was surprised when we ended basically the equivalent of 4 blocks out to the bay.  Forbes Island is a neat concept - an \"island\" (basically a boat) off of the bay. The main dining room is below so if there were windows to look out you could potentially see sea life. However the main dining room is dimly lit.  Thinking this was an island, we didn't take motion sickness pills and the boat-\"island\" was some what rafty, I was not TOTALLY at peace.  The food is alright. I think it is a bit overpriced for the quality of food. Boyfriend and I both orders flat iron steak and it was good. We also split a soup de Jour which happened to be New England Chowder - it was good. And then ordered a side shiitake mushroom and broccoli side - which came out as a cube - which was interesting.   Overall: I'm glad I came. The company was awesome but wouldn't come back. If you're looking for something new and different, this is one to try but if you're looking for a high end dining/food experience, I recommend looming elsewhere",
