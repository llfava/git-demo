There is no such thing of skimping out on seafood at this place. I was talking to the nice lady who i believe was gigi herself and she told me that the broth for the cioppino takes at least 3 days to make and the seafood is freshly purchased every morning at the pier.   I always feel welcomed here and the customer service is so friendly and they literally treat you like family. This is truly a must go place Ive also tried the chef special seafood pasta and OMG I swear there is so much seafood you wont even finish it. The proportion at this place is huge!  Overall please try this place out you wont regret it, great food for a good price!",

We loved the charm of the decor and we thoroughly enjoyed every dish that we had. We started with a plate of mussels and shared the seafood linguini, Ciopinno and scallops between the four of us. Every dish was delicious and the sauce for each dish was worth 2 orders of bread to dip with.  The waitress that we had was very attentive and our food came in at the just right pace for us. Too bad that it was our last night in SF, otherwise, we would have come back to try other dishes. We highly recommend that you eat there.",

We weren't really in a huge hurry, so it was no big deal. \u00a0The atmosphere is more homey and family-oriented than romantic.

Decor Couple pictures framed on the walls.  Service Preeetty bad. No greeting, and hardly any attention considering we were the only other table there. Def did not feel any friendliness here.  Food Clam Chowder- Came in a less-than-fancy bowl with the soup spilled over the sides. Watered down, but I'll give the clams credit. Scallops- Came out with a buttered sauce along the bottom of the plate. Cooked well, I'll admit, but I couldn't eat too many of them. Risotto- Even you seafood lovers may not be pleased. I took 1 bite and I lost my appetite. The worst of them all.  Price Total came out to $60ish with tip. Not. Worth. It.  Sad about the excellent reviews versus the product itself. I wish I ended my SF trip with a bang, but just gotta learn from our mistakes! Good riddance, Sotto Mare!",

Except for my companion and myself, the host and staff to be close friends with every single person that walked in. The food was great.

No matter, one-half litre of the house white wine (simple, but pleasant, and not too expensive) and a pot of cioppino later, we rolled ourselves out of the restaurant.  The cioppino is so good that even when we were full, we had to keep eating. Given how messy it is, I wouldn't recommend it for a first date.  Service was great - waters were constantly filled, bread replenished.  Outside seating looked cold in the evening, so bring a jacket.

    "review_text": "Located in the heart of Little Italy, Sotto Mare is tucked between a street of other restaurants. However, it stands out with its fresh seafood offerings. I came here alone (after one of my friends bailed on me) so unfortunately could not order the cioppino I so wanted to try. The cioppino only comes in one size and so is not suited for a party of one. Instead, I asked for the waitress' recommendation of an SF specific food and she pointed me to the petrole sole, one of two local fish on the menu.   And now begins the food breakdown. I started off with the bread and butter. Nothing spectacular - the bread wasn't very fresh and the crust threatened to break my teeth. Luckily, I wasn't there for the bread.  I couldn't resist getting at least one oyster and so I ordered a West Coast oyster for $1.50. IT WAS DELICIOUS. The best oyster I've ever had. I've never really understood the hype until now but this oyster was so fresh with a tinge of saltiness.   The entree itself was meh. While I don't doubt what the waitress said about its freshness, the breading/grilling process overwhelmed the taste and texture of the fish. It was definitely overcooked, and I found myself unable to appreciate the fish because the taste of the oil was too overwhelming. The vegetables that came with it were standard, probably doused in butter, a tradition I will never understand. There was one outstanding aspect to the dish - the tomato-caper sauce that came in its own dish on the side. This creamy tomato sauce was amazing, and I found myself dipping everything from the fish, to the vegetables, to even the bread so I could soak up as much of the delicious goodness as I could.   However, in hindsight, I probably would have enjoyed the meal more if I had just skipped the entree and ordered 20 bucks worth of oysters. :P I would like to come back sometime to try the cioppino but the other seafood entree was underwhelming.",

As I approached the hostess she proclaimed 'OK, that's IT for the night!' Wha-wha-WHAAAAT?!?

Some may find this less than ideal, but I thought this was perfect. The next 60-90 minutes were an amazing experience of taste, sight and sound. Amazing clam chowder to start soon followed by two huge bowls teeming with shellfish, pasta and sauce. A bottle of house Chianti (I have yet to go wrong with this choice) and the meal was complete. Soon we were fat and happy as the kitchen staff was wrapping up the night and 'American Pie' was blaring from the speakers to the delight of the raucous patrons and staff singing along loudly.

You can make reservations for large groups, which is really fun because they put you downstairs in this little secret area that makes you feel like you're a character in a mob movie dining with the godfather and plotting your next hit. Well, that's what it reminded me of, anyway.   The front of house person is straightforward and hilarious, so make sure to pause on your way in to observe her as she does her job.   As for the food, it's just as straightfoward, but there's nothing funny about the deliciousness of each dish. Their specialty, as you would guess, is seafood. After browsing the reviews I learned that the favorites were the sand dabs and the cioppino. I got the sand dabs but after seeing the giant cioppino for 2 come out I regretted my order. Mine was just fine, but the cioppino is really something to behold! Chock full of the best fruits of the sea and the broth is just heavenly. Don't be afraid to wear a bib because it will definitely splatter!  Oh, and it's also BYOB with a corkage fee, or you can choose from their wine list as well.

We went there on a Saturday's afternoon around 5:00pm because we came back from Alcatraz. It was good that they still opened during that time (kinda late for lunch and kinda early for dinner). The restaurant was still empty and the waitress let us to choose the table that we like.  When you looked from outside, the restaurant was pretty small but when you were actually in the restaurant, there were lot of tables and bar seats. The decor was fun and gave you a homey feel! The service was friendly, warm, fast, sweet and helpful. It makes you feel like you've come to someone's house for dinner rather than a restaurant. The restaurant was getting packed and busy around 6:00pm, so better to make reservation or come early. The wait can be long.   What we have ordered:   1. Half dozen of Oyster (on Half Shell $1.50 each) - The oysters were so FRESH and yummy! Great Price with the quality!   2. Clam chowder on a bowl ($6.50) - Very creamy and lots of clams. Perfect when you eat with the bread!   3. Seafood Cioppino ($27.00) - It served with a pot. I thought it was not that big but actually the portion was good enough for two people. The cioppino had the best tomato broth with all the FRESH seafood, like crab, mussels, clams, scallops, calamari, shrimps and even pasta. The flavors of the seafood were so sweet and the tomato sauce made every bite extremely delicious. We even asked the waitress to give us more bread to eat with the yummy tomato broth (but too bad they were so busy and they forgot). I tried the cioppino at other restaurants before but this was the best cioppino I have even had.   This is definitely one of the better experiences I've had for seafood and I will definitely come back.",

He provided us the menu and let us know right away that the ciappino was the perfect size for two and there was NO dessert as there are excellent dessert places all around North Beach area so best to leave for those options.  Happy they tell the truth because really, their ciappino is AWESOME. \u00a0You get a cute crab bib to wear and a huge POT of ciappino. \u00a0It's filled with tons of pieces of crab, calamari, mussels, scallops, fish and pasta. \u00a0So hearty and the broth was very full of flavor.... on the edge of being TOO flavorful. \u00a0But really, that is nothing to complain about. \u00a0Just soak that sauce with some french bread and you're GOOD TO GO! \u00a0We considered ordering another item on the menu but were happy we stuck with only ciappino cuz we were TOTALLY STUFFED.  Great experience and would recommend anyone to come here. \u00a0Only thing to be weary of is LINES so plan accordingly!",

    "review_text": "BEST CIOPPINO EVER!  My parents came to the city to take me out for a belated birthday dinner, so I figured it was the perfect time to satiate my seafood cravings. A quick search of Yelp brought me here and boy am I glad I tried it!  Ambiance: Walking in, the dining room is narrow, but they actually have a large dining space downstairs... True it's a little confining and isolated, but you're here to eat the food and enjoy the company of those you came with, so it's all good!  Service: Our waitress was a nice woman with a great sense of humor and a warm demeanor. She told us about their specialties, made sure our water glasses never went empty, and ensured we had enough bread to soak up the delicious sauces from our entrees.  Food: The cioppino is enough to share between two (we even had leftovers). They give you lobster bibs, which is helpful since you do have to crack the crab yourself. The tomato broth is perfectly seasoned, there's seafood aplenty, and although I've never had cioppino with penne pasta (or any pasta), there was a fair amount without being a filler that overpowered the seafood. Rest assured, I soaked up every bit of broth with the bread.I also had a bite of my dad's scallops which were pretty tasty. For some reason, I'm not a fan of scallops (something to do with a weird taste I get from them), but the sauce was amazing! My sister's sandabs were also quite tasty. Before our entrees, my dad and my sister had some of the clam chowder, which I tried. It was pretty good, also. The bread they give you for the table is room temperature and definitely nothing special, but that doesn't matter because the bread is merely a vessel for the delectable sauces!  Price: Definitely reasonably priced for fresh seafood!  Would I return? Heck yes. This place is going on my favorites list for places to eat in SF. Too bad I don't live in North Beach, otherwise I would be here more often!  NOTE: This can be good or bad, but they don't serve dessert here. They do point you in the direction of places that do serve dessert, but for health reasons, they opt not to serve such sugary goodness.",

We even miraculously got a parking spot literally across the small street from the entrance. On a Tuesday night around 7 PM, there was no wait at all.  Food: I split the Crab Cioppino with my cousin, and it was MORE than enough for two starving girls to tackle! This dish was served piping hot and full of fresh, perfectly-cooked seafood, noodles, and a tomato broth. I'm talking HUGE legs of crab, massive shrimp, plentiful octopi, fresh clams... I'd be eating here every night if I lived closer. And at $27 for the entire dish, dinner wasn't so expensive!  Ambiance: You could spend hours looking at the walls! Pictures of patrons, evidence of fishing expeditions, dried fish hanging everywhere (which actually weren't at all smelly)... Even the people eating there are cool! We actually looked around to see what looked good on people's tables and asked them about the food, and everyone was really friendly. It's easy to make conversations with others if you're sitting at the bar next to the kitchen.   Service: HA! For all you haters on here, LAME. No, it's not first class, white gloves, stuffy/expensive service, but it's exactly like being at a crazy aunt's house (I mean that in the best way possible!). The two ladies who greeted us had hearty laughs and treated us like we were in their home. Anyone read Harry Potter? It was like going to the Weasleys' :) \u00a0They stopped by to check on us throughout the meal and pointed to and explained all the things on the walls.   Highly recommended to seafood lovers!",

    "review_text": "Some of the best and worst of quality combined into one restaurant.  We called early on a Saturday afternoon and were told by the hostess that we did not need reservations, that we could walk in as a party of four with one child and would be fine in terms of seating. That was not accurate... By the time we got near the restaurant, they were already on a wait and it was only 4PM.   We eventually did get seated around 5:15 PM, but they put us in the basement probably because they didn't want a child seated upstairs where the action is happening...i.e. The kitchen, and a much more intimate and warm environment. They put us downstairs in a room that reminded me of a mixture between and abandoned restaurant, a nursing home and an airplane hangar from World War II with random pictures all over the place.   We waited 10 minutes before anybody brought us menus or water. They brought us some cold bread which was lame, and when they offered us a wine all of the vintages they had were either 2012 or 2013 cheap table wines that are not worth paying $30 for. Maybe 10, but definitely not 30. This is not the place to go to for wine or bread.  At this point, we were close to walking out until they brought us oysters. We ordered several East Coast and several West Coast oysters and they were incredible. It surprised us... It did not line up with the bad experience we had had prior because of how good these things were.   Then the entr\u00e9es came out in a timely manner. Lots of people told us to try the seafood linguine, and it was absolutely insane! Best seafood dish I have ever had in my life based on multiple interactions with Italian restaurants all over the place whether in NY, Miami, Chicago etc.   The key to the seafood linguine is mixing the sauces. They offer you red, white or a mixture of both. I advise a mixture. It changes the game.  Didn't even bother with dessert. We went somewhere else for that. I would give this place five stars but everything leading up to the oysters and seafood linguine was pretty terrible.",

    "review_text": "Since we love to fly to SF for great meals, we went back to Sotto Mare for lunch the other day. We arrived at 11:30am so it wasn't too crowded yet. We were seated at the counter. We asked the waitress about the raw oysters since they had 2 types ($2.50 for East Coast or $1.50 each for West Coast). She was honest and told me that they're about the same size so why pay more? So I ordered a dozen of the $1.50 oysters. They turned out to be relatively small in size but fresh and tasty. We also ordered their sauteed scallops and shrimp and they were perfectly cooked with a very yummy sauce. The crusty French bread was good too. One interesting observation: a bus boy brought back the bread basket from a table that had left and it still had several pieces of bread in the basket. He went behind the counter to the bread cutting board and took out one piece that looked like it had been eaten. He put this half-eaten piece of bread on the cutting board and threw out the rest. Since we were seated at the counter, we had a clear view of this half-eaten slice of bread as it sat on the counter. Other servers came and went, slicing chunks and placing them into a new basket, yet this piece of half-eaten bread just sat there (see photo). It took about 15 mins before a server finally discarded this half-eaten slice of bread. Very bizarre...I thought for sure some poor unsuspecting customer would be getting this half-eaten slice. Other than this slight aberration, Sotto Mare did not disappoint. We will definitely be back!",

First off, this place is pretty tiny. The main dining room upstairs is long and skinny and will not fit large parties. If you have a party of 7 like we did you will be stuck in the dungeon downstairs, where it is hot and doesn't seem to have any air circulation. We were all sweating while eating, which kinda sucked, but I must say the food was pretty good. I have never tried cioppino before so I really don't have a frame of comparison, but Sotto Mare's was fantastic. Lots of seafood in there and the flavor of the soup base was excellent! Sand dabs were just alright, nothing special about them. The house special linguini was just as good as the cioppino. The pasta was perfectly cooked and well, pink sauce just makes everything good!  Service wasn't rude, but it was a little slow. It took awhile for us to get the attention of a server and it took forever to get what we asked for. If there is any room for improvement, it's here.",

It was my first time and when I walked in the door my first impression was that it looked like an upscale Swan Oyster Depot what with the long counter seating. There were only about four tables for four available that can be reserved for parties of 3 or more. If you're a pair, then you wait for counter seating, which doesn't take long. Unlike Swan, the counter seating a very comfortable as you can actually get your legs under the counter and it is quite wide so you don't feel squished in. We each ordered a whole crab along with some oysters and clams. My guest said the chowder was good and I had a very simple house salad that was shredded lettuce with some tomato wedges and a side of dressing. The shellfish was all fresh and excellent, but it doesn't really show off the best of this restaurant.  Our seating was opposite the grill and stove so we got to see some excellent preparations of scallops, salmon, cioppino,skate wings and sand dabs. OMG, everything looked so good! I am making it a point to go back and have something that they cook. The owners are super friendly and the service was very good. The place feels like home. You will enjoy it.",

Where Scoma's has white table cloths, cloth napkins and a touch of stuffiness; Sotto Mare has paper towels for napkin, aprons and a friendly, casual environment.  I popped in late on a rainy Tuesday evening for dinner. The main dining area is snug; a long counter lining the cooking area, a few tables along the wall, and some tables outside. They also have a dining room for larger parties, but I didn't see it. I was immediately smitten with Sotto Mare when the hostess offered me a glass of house wine while I waited.  I was seated at the counter; if you're a solo diner or like making new friends this is the place to sit. The couple next to me have been coming back to Sotto Mare for years and had a few recommendations for me. However, this was one of those times where dining alone was also a hindrance, since I couldn't order all of the items that sounded so good. Cioppino and dabs, I'm looking at you.  I went with the linguine with seafood, a steal at $17. To call it linguine *with* seafood felt like a misnomer; as it should be, the dish was heavy on the seafood and lighter on the pasta. Shrimp, prawns, scallops, calamari - it had it all. The only complaint I had about the dish was that the sauce was a little too rich. That said, I still cleaned my plate.  Sotto Mare was a fantastic experience and such an excellent value for the price. From the moment I walked in and was greeted with a glass of house wine, to the moment I left; I felt like I was being welcomed into their home like a member of the family. The icing on the cake was seeing Tony Bennett head out as I was walking in; the staff was so nonchalant about it, that I didn't believe it was him until the person next to me asked.",

The waitress was patient with us as she explained Italian dishes we've never heard of and didn't mind the fact that my brother kept asking for more bread...lol  Now the food was amazing! For the appetizer, we got Benita's baccala, which is a spread for your bread (hehe rhymes). It's a good start to get your taste buds ready for the more savory main course. However, the yelp pictures of this dish don't quite do it justice. It didn't look that paste-y in real life. For the main course me and my brother shared the cioppino and I have to say, I agree with their claim that they have \"the best damn cioppino!\". The tomato sauce was so delicious. The only tomato sauce I've ever had would be from a jar, but this..oh man you could tell it was home made. It didn't have a lot of that acidic taste because there were no preservatives, it was a thin sauce with tomato chunks, and it was bursting with flavor! Besides pairing real well with all the seafood is came with it, I took some of the sauce and ate it with the seafood risotto my mom ordered. So good! xD! And the seafood risotto was also really good! Just be sure to try a portion of it first before the cioppino because the sauce in the cioppino overpowers the risotto.  As I looked around, however, I saw most people chucking at oysters or clams. Maybe next time I'll try it too since it's also their specialty.  Anyways, I definitely want to come back here when I'm in SF again! ^.^",

    "review_text": "My brother came into San Francisco last night for a rare visit, and, based on the recommendation of a friend (I'm looking at you, Frankie), I took him to Sotto Mare. NEVER AGAIN. Let me explain: we had a 7:30 reservation for a Saturday night, and when we got there, the place was hopping. We got there on time, but they didn't have our table ready, which was fine. We had some wine and chatted on the sidewalk, and got seated at 7:50. (You'll see why the times matter.) Service was prompt and friendly; we had wine, appetizers, entrees, all very generously sized. The seafood was good -- nothing special; just good. When the entree plates were cleared, they presented the bill -- no dessert menu or coffee offering, which again was fine. Maybe that's not their thing. So we pay (quite a bit, and with a healthy sized tip, because the waitress was great), and I swear to you we did not dawdle. Five (5) minutes after the waitress returned our credit card, an older Italian woman who was either the owner or the manager appeared at our table and said (I swear I'm not making this up), \"Hey - I have all of these people waiting to eat -- you have to leave.\" That was 9:10 PM. I was as surprised as I've ever been. I'm not one of those people who spends half the night chatting after the bill's been paid, and I'm sure we would have left within minutes anyway -- but I have never, ever been told by the manager that I had to leave within 5 minutes of finishing our business. And I don't think that spending 80 minutes on a dinner meal, from seating time to departure time, is doing anything at a slow or dawdling pace. I was instantly very sorry that I had chosen to go to Sotto Mare, and I will never make that mistake again. It's too late for me, but I can save one innocent person from having this kind of dining experience, then it was worth it. So if you're thinking of Sotto Mare, think twice. You can do better.",

Penne pasta is thrown into the mix, but save your carbs by dipping their complimentary bread into the heavenly sauce. Eating at the bar was much fun! They also have a downstairs dining area.   My only complaint is how rude the owner is. I get it. This is the kind of restaurant that folks will wait in line for, so she thinks folks will keep coming back regardless of the service or she doesn't care about repeat customers. Don't know, don't care, rude is rude. Good customer service only helps, lady. She and I didn't interact, but when I was leaving I heard her being an arrogant prick to a guy waiting in line for ~30 minutes. Not cool. Minus two stars for her disgusting behavior.

The manager/waitress gave us a glass of wine while we waited 20-25 minutes on the sidewalk. We were seated at the bar. The restaurant is nicer than I thought it'd be --- it is super casual and kitschy for sure --- but I expected plastic baskets and cutlery from the looks of the photos on yelp. The atmosphere feels like an old, authentic fish market. Service was attentive - drinks never went empty, plates promptly cleared, and the manager/waitress from earlier kept checking on us (and other tables) throughout. We ordered the crab louie, the cioppino, the seafood linguine (with butter/garlic rather than cream sauce) and peroni beer and house wines. \u00a0All were amazing - featuring fresh seafood prepared how we'd hoped. The cioppino was better with each bite and had a beautiful, full flavored tomato broth. The seafood was mostly shell - I didn't see any actual fish - but that didn't bother me because I love crab, shrimp and scallops. Some of the smaller scallops were a little over cooked, but again, that didn't bother me. \u00a0We were directed to a gelato place around the corner for dessert (Naia). All in all, a fantastic San Francisco/North Beach experience for seafood lovers. We highly recommend and will definitely be back!!!",

We came here on a Thursday night and arrived at the restaurant at 7:20pm. There was already a line forming and I knew the wait was going to be a while. It took almost two hours to go from putting our name down on the wait list to when the food came to our table.   We ordered the cioppino like everyone suggested. The portion was good. Perfect for two people as the menu suggested. While I'm no expert on cioppino nor have I tried any before this trip, I was rather underwhelmed by the experience. Perhaps it was the two hour wait. Perhaps it was the hype around the dish. Perhaps it may have even been the $40+ bill that came to us at the end.   I'm sorry to say this but it just wasn't worth it. Not $41 dollars worth of food by any means. Don't get me wrong. There was a good amount of seafood and some penne to add to the mix. But after tips and tax, it's about $25 per person. For that amount, it would've been worthwhile to order the seafood linguine, which looked amazing.   The food wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't worth the wait nor the money.",

I have not had many cioppinos in my time but I do believe it is one of those things that could be extremely easy to mess up due to the sensitive cooking times of seafood. On my recent visit here, I shared \"The Best Damn Crab Cioppino in San Francisco\" with my boyfriend. It was pricey at $41 BUT it definitely feeds 2 as noted so it's not too bad per person.  The wait for it was long and painful since we were both starving. We may have waited over 30 minutes but finally, the cioppino came and I've gotta say - it was definitely worth the wait!! I don't have much to compare it to but it takes the title as the best in my belly.Our cioppino came served in a mini pot-like container with a lid and it really helped to keep our broth warm. They gave heaping portions of mussels, shrimp, and scallops! There were clams as well but the clams were an afterthought compared to the mussels. I'm usually not a crab fan either somehow they managed to make this crab so damn good. The broth/stew part was perfectly seasoned too. My only complaint (if I had to be nitpicky) was that the penne got soggy very quickly but since it was at the bottom of the pot, I am not surprised that it would turn out this way. I refilled my bowl a good 4-5 times (as did my boyfriend) and we were both full beyond belief by the end of the meal.  Since we sat at the bar, I saw them bring out plenty of their other items and they all looked delicious but it would be pretty difficult to convince me NOT to get the cioppino the next time I come back.",

I let them know that i'd be runninga little late. At 6:55pm, my table was given away. My friend was already there waiting. He noted everything, spoke to someone there who was giving table after table and guess what?? He was told that reservations are made for parties of 4 or more. When he confronted the employee by saying that would've been useful information BEFORE this reservation was even made, the employee was of NO HELP. Instead, he said \"yeah, I wish the person didn't make that reservation for you\" and walked off.   WOW!!!!!  I arrived at 7:04pm, 4 minutes late. I was told we could either wait 10 minutes for a table or sit at the table outside. I opted to sit outside since it was a fairly warm night in San Francisco.

I looked so forward to coming here and waiting all vacation to visit this place. \u00a0Walked in and it's a small main dining area with a few tables and a long counter to sit at. I did notice they had a back room and not sure how big that was. Interesting. Lots of pictures on the wall and the kitchen is in the main dining area.   We knew exactly what we wanted and started off with bowls of clam chowder. Oh my goodness. Best clam chowder I've ever eaten. Every spoonful has tons of clams with potatoes and bacon. So tasty. So much goodness in a spoon.   We weren't that hungry cause we're basically Foodie out so the three of us split \"The Best Damn Crab Cioppino\". My goodness. Can you say heaven in a bowl. Cracked crab, mussels, shrimp, calamari, scallops, clams and pasta in a tomato sauce. Cooked to perfection. The crab was easy to pull out of the shell. You soak up the sauce with the sour dough bread. Oh my goodness. This dish lived up to its name.   My son ordered the Linguine with Manila clams in a cream sauce. I got to taste his dish too. Pasta was so fresh and perfectly cooked. Clams were excellent. Very good dish but the Cioppino was hands down better.   Service was very good. Waitress was very friendly, knew the menu and very casual. She made you feel at home. Thy put jars of water at your table so you can fill your own cups. Food came out really quickly. Finished dishes were taken off the table quickly. So we had a really great meal.   Our old go to seafood restaurant used to be Scoma's, but I feel Sotto Mare is hands down better. Better food. Better prices. So if you ever have a chance, you got to try this place. It's the BOMB of seafood. Oh yea make a reservation to make sure you get in.",

As there was a line, the owner also gave us free glasses of wine to tide us over while we waited.  For dinner, we ordered the seafood risotto, sole fillet, west coast oysters, and clam chowder. The clam chowder was wonderful- creamy, bacony, rich, and full of clam. The oysters were decent as well.   The risotto was flavorful, perfectly seasoned, and had a good amount of seafood. Our favorite were the delicate sweet prawns that were perfectly cooked (pretty rare to find nowadays). \u00a0Sadly, the sole fillets were a bit more disappointing. The sole itself did not have enough flavor to stand on its own without being more seasoned. We ended up putting on quite a bit of salt to help it along. On the plus side though, the dish came with a LOT of fish.   Overall, we liked the place a lot and settled on 3.5 stars. (We use 2 stars as \"average\"). We loved the large portions although the place isn't inexpensive. Our other suggestion is to get some better table bread/baguettes- the stale hard stuff we got really lowered the feel of the place.",

Just thinking about it gets my mouth salivating and stomach grumbling again. It's $33, but can easily be split amongst 3-4 people with addition supplements.  This place is totally iconic SF, you'd think you were a tourist at Fisherman Warf. But, that's the awesomeness of the place - it's tucked away in North Beach and geared more towards the locals. Which makes it all that much more specials!  The chowda is also scrumptious, and the pasta is nice, too.   But really, all you need is the CIOPPINO. And a bib. :)",

It's portioned perfectly for 2 to share as a meal, or for 4 to share with another dish. The perfect balance between seafood, sauce, herbs, and consistency rests on a bed of rigatoni, and you won't be able to put your spoon down until the last bit is swiped off with bread!  I also LOVE the welcoming service, and how nicely they are willing to accommodate my gluten and lactose dietary issues (cioppino for the rare blowout meal only!). They'll swap my pasta for a risotto specially made without dairy, and it's still so creamy and flavorful I always think it's too good to be true. But true it is! The first time I ate here, I nearly wept because I couldn't finish my plate, and wasn't able to take the leftovers. Every return visit since then, I go prepared with no post-dinner barhopping, just so I never have to abandon the goodness again.  This is a family-run operation that truly values serving good food. Beware the word is out! Go early, or go on a non Fri/Sat night, or else be prepared for a wait.",

We still needed to wait about 10 minutes but the hostess gave us each a glass of wine so the wait was painless.   We ordered the cioppino for two, the baccala, and half a dozen clams.   Everything was amazing. It was my first time having cioppino, but my boyfriend said it was the best he'd ever had. It wasn't just small scraps of seafood. It was good pieces of crab, mussels, nice pieces of calamari, and there was some pasta in there too. We soaked up that broth with some crusty bread and left so happy. Definitely a place I'd go to again.   The baccala was delicious too. It's something my boyfriend grew up eating and he said Sotto Mare did a good job. The clams were what you'd expect. Fresh tasting with a nice spicy ketchup. But next time I'd skip the clams since no place can really do raw seafood much differently.",

We were cautious about trying this place because cause honestly yelp is helpful but can be very relative to the reviewer.  Sotto Mare is very small. You'll need a dinner reservation for parties larger than 2. Not a great place for parties larger than 4 due to their galley style dinning room. Kind of noisey but the cioppino was amazing!!!! At 42 bucks for a soup tourine style presentation, the broth is flavorful and rich-- laiden with crab, mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp &amp; scallops. All the savory fish for a proper cioppino. My only complaint is we ordered a house salad and it was a mound of iceberg lettuce finely sliced with tomato wedges to sparkle the edge of the plate. Iceberg lettuce is so not cool for a salad!  Stick to the mainstays! Portions are large judging by the other meals we viewed by nearby patrons. Well worth the trip!!!!",

There is always a wait here....the average wait is probably around 30 minutes and they only take reservations for parties of 4 or more. If you only have 2 in your party you will only be seated at the bar, but I didn't mind because the counter space was larger than expected and they didn't overcrowd the bar with too many seats.  The restaurant was extremely busy tonight, but that seems to be the norm and therefore the service can be lacking at times. (I tried to come here last Sat night, but they stopped taking names almost an hour before closing because so many people were already waiting for tables!)  Although everything on their menu is fairly pricey the atmosphere is very laid back and the host/ servers can be a little pushy because of how busy they always are.  We ordered the steamed clams and mussels combo, cioppino, and linguini with seafood in \"pink sauce\" which is a tomato cream sauce. Steamed clams/ mussels combo was AMAZING! I would say 5 stars without hesitation! The sauce (butter garlic with a touch of white wine) was so delicious \u00a0and the shellfish were cooked perfectly! Cioppino was average-3 stars. The serving was very large and came with crab, shrimp, squid, scallops, clams, mussels, and some penne pasta. The seafood was cooked well, but the sauce was just okay. My boyfriend said it tasted differently from when he came here with his friend. I was disappointed because they claim it to be their \"best damn cioppino,\" but if this is how it normally tastes then I would not order it again. The seafood linguini with pink sauce was very good- 4 stars!  I would definitely come back for the steamed shellfish combo and to try their other pastas and fish entrees.",

To be honest, this review is only about their cioppino, which is the only thing that I tried because it serves two people.

Actually I enjoyed the shooter a lot; it was a good mix of salty and brine-y but refreshing and I wasn't grossed out by the oyster like some people I know have been.  The cioppino, though OH MY GAHHHD. They call it the \"Best Damn Crab Cioppino\" and I've got to say, it is definitely worth 5 stars by itself. If it wasn't the best in my recent memory, it was definitely top 2. And it was definitely enough for 2 people to fill up.   There was more seafood in that bowl than pasta in some other pasta-only dishes. And all of it was delicious - the clams, mussels, and squid were all bathed in just the right amount of sauce (but not drowning in more than can be soaked up by your bread) and the crab was precracked to ensure it was infused with all of the flavors already. Seriously, this was heaven.  I'm definitely coming back here, but I'll have to force myself to try something else from their menu. If it's all as amazing as this was I'll be sure that I'll love any of their food. Although I did think their bread was very plain... like it was nothing special. It had no identity to itself other than being something to soak up pasta sauces... or is that the point?",

Yes I have proclaimed my love for a restaurant.   I called to make a reservation and was greeted by a lady with a short fuse who told me first come, first served and some other choice words. I hung up the phone and hurried my fanny down there, put my name on the list, crossed my fingers and prayed my name would get called. And I witnessed first hand how the same lady answering the phone turned people away. The lady running the show had house rules, here are a few that I noticed: don't stand in the way, keep the door closed, NO more reservations, etc, etc.   I was on the hunt for good Cioppino and The \"BEST DAMN CRAB CIOPPINO\" with seafood was labeled on the menu. That label was understated. I have finally found the WORLDS GREATEST CIOPPINO and now I can stop looking. Loaded with fresh ingredients with rich tomato base, crab legs for days, clams, fish, and calamari and maybe other seafood, I don't remember. I like the fact that a small portion of pasta was added and that really put it over the top. The flavor was outta this world. With the cioppino came bread and I requested garlic in olive oil which I don't think is on the menu but it should, that stuff was great.   People were enduring the long wait and came near and far to get a taste of this seafood greatness. I cant blame them. I was on a food high for about a month and I found myself telling random strangers about how good this place is. I feel sorry for those who miss out on a place like this. Before you expire you gotta get down to this place and try the Cioppino, trust me its as good as it gets.   The lady who runs the place is actually a nice lady and even though they were busy on a Saturday night the staff was friendly and helpful. I was curious about that song so first thing I did when I got home was wikipedia that Alice song. A band named Smokie from Bradford, England or something like that.

There was enough to fill both our bellies and enough for lunch for one the next day, which I gladly lapped up!!",

After 30mins of circling blocks trying to find parking, then hiking hill after hill (who's the genius that decided to build this city on top of so many effin hills??), I was hungry and cranky. Must say I wasn't impressed by the look of this restaurant, tiny entrance with crowded tables, you must walk in a single file line to get through. Down there stairs there are more dining area for bigger parties, but still, if you have claustrophobia...  The cioppino didn't disappoint, fresh, full of flavor, piping hot. Probably the best cooked seafood I've ever had. The best part is that the crab legs were all well pre-cracked so that it comes apart super easy, I hate working at my food! Our whole party (of 7) ordered nothing but cioppino, I also got some oysters that weren't exceedingly impressive. That yummy broth, I can still taste it... was so good to dip the bread in, we kept asking for more bread. One order is definitely enough to share between 2 people, 1 person was brave (or greedy) enough to order one on his own, I think he was sweating seafood by the end of the night!",

About an hour after that I started getting a stomach ache. That stomach ache led to severe stomach pains for the next 5-6 hours. For this reason alone I would not go back but I also found the cioppino fairly mediocre. The quantity of seafood for $40 wasn't impressive and at least one of the staff members was barking rude comments at other staff.",

When I got to the place with baby in tow, the wife was venting about the rude hostess/owner lady, possibly the same obnoxious lady who answered the phone just hours earlier. I was ready at the drop of a hat to tell her off, but she was a bit nicer when she sat us, so I held my tongue. And I wanted to at least judge the food before I did so...  I thought it was a bit audacious to call it \"BEST DAMN CRAB CIOPPINO\", and was ready to pounce if it was even slightly subpar, but oh my gosh, oh my gosh, it was so amazing. Probably the freshest seafood I've ever tasted, and a ton of it--huge crab legs, shrimp, mussels, calamari, clams, all stewing in this fantastic creamy tomato broth with a bit of Penne. It was really too much, and too delicious.   We also got a raw clam, because I'd never seen them served raw. Let's put it this way--there's a reason that people eat raw oyster and not raw clam--raw clam tastes just like cooked clam.  That rude owner lady couldn't get enough of our baby--she smooched him and hugged him over and over again and practically wouldn't let us out. She said we should keep coming back so she could watch him grow up. She even gave the wife her card and said to call her for reservations (even though I'd been rudely rejected when I tried to make a reservation on the phone earlier that afternoon).   This woman's love for our baby, as well as her amazing cioppino, saved her from my wrath.",

    "review_text": "The seafood restaurant is around the corner from my grandparents' place and it gets crowded! My family and I went here around 6:30 on 5/14/11 and waited 10 minutes. We were told a 20 minute wait. When we left the restaurant, there was a huge line.   We got seated in the downstairs private dining room. The space was tight, but it wasn't as noisy and crowded as upstairs.   The menu is small, but the food was good! At the bottom of the menu, it states, \"NO MEAT - NO CHICKEN - NO TRANS FAT!\" Yay for no meat.   We ordered the following: 1) Clam Chowder Bowl ($6.50) - Okay. I've had creamier chowder. In addition, there was a lot of sand from the clams. Dislike.  2) Ciopinno ($33) - Wow! This a huge cauldron of seafood in marinara sauce. Lots of fresh crab, mussels, clams, squid, shrimp, and baby scallops. This dish feeds enough for 3 people, and you can easily get full. Put the bread in the sauce to soak up the flavors.  3) Seafood risotto ($19) - I liked this dish too. The same seafood from the ciopinno was used here. The risotto was creamy. My hubby said that was a little too salty though.  4) Pesto Fettuccine ($12) - The pesto was mixed with cream. Bleh. I still ate the dish, but it was extremely rich and oily.   Service was fine. We always got refills with bread. In addition, it's nice that every table received a pitcher of water.   I would come back to try the sand dabs.

    "review_text": "During my last visit to San Francisco, one of the dishes that my girlfriend really wanted to try was cioppino and we ended up deciding on Sotto Mare to get our fix. The reviews seemed to be pretty split between a few places including Sotto Mare as the go to spots so we were optimistic on our walk uptown (although downhill).   We waited a few minutes to be seated and were welcomed with a hostess who was brusque to the other customers and was busting balls left and right. Very old school Italian and the interior of the restaurant was as well. No complaints about either of those and my GF loved her attitude. I'm sure some would be turned off but we were highly entertained.  We started off our meal with a bowl of clam chowder which was accompanied with some bread. Simply, the Italian bread we were served was not good. Now I do understand that this is an Italian restaurant first and foremost and we did get Italian bread instead of the expected sourdough. This would have been fine if it was good bread but instead it was cold and reminiscent of bad supermarket bread. For the food we were ordering the quality of the bread is critical to the overall enjoyment with the dipping and the sopping and the like. The clam chowder was pretty tasty but nothing worth writing home about.   The big dish of the night was the crab cioppino that we ordered to split. It came out in a GIANT metal serving container and full of broth and seafood looking fantastic. The crab was definitely the star of the show and was sweet and salty and delicious. No problems with the crab or really with the mussels and the clams in the cioppino. The issues started with the shrimp and the scallops that were part of the dish. Both were tiny and super chewy and the kind of seafood that is definitely purchased frozen for super cheap. It really took away from the experience and added little to no flavor by themselves. The part that killed the whole dish though was the broth. Yeesh. I expected the broth in a cioppino to be full of seafood flavor and have at least some seasoning. To have a broth that basically tasted like tomato soup was a crime against some of the high quality seafood that was floating around in it.  For a place with such high reviews I was expecting more and got less.",

So I recommend locals to come on weeknights to avoid all the tourists. It is North Beach after all.  But if you must come during the madness hours make a reservation! If you have really lost control of the situation and wind up walking in here during peak hours with no reservations then be prepared to wait 1hour plus. The good thing is they give you a buzzer thingy that works anywhere on the block. So go across the road for a glass of wine or go next door to the dive for a cocktail and wait for that buzzer to light up.  The food is very much worth the trek. Oh and wear the bib!

Little did we know that we were in for a treat.   After bracing ourselves for a crowd, we were lucky enough to have no wait whatsoever and were seated immediately. Score!   Free bread was instantly bestowed upon us. At the table were olive oil and vinegar, and you can also ask for fresh garlic. Score again!  We ordered the seafood cioppino, 4 oysters (east coast and west coast; in my humble opinion, west coast tasted better), the seafood cioppino, and half a plate of linguine in Alfredo sauce. We also ordered a glass of red wine (forgot which one).   Everything was perfecto! The seafood cioppino - WOW. They do not skimp out on the seafood, and everything was so fresh. The soup broth was also very flavorful and had so much depth. The linguine - they cooked the pasta perfectly and did not smother it in sauce, which I was very grateful for. The oysters were also quite delicious.   While service was not over the top since it's a small restaurant and fairly busy, it was friendly and not at all lacking. (I'm talking to you other reviewers, who for some reason expect to be waited on hand and foot...)  The meal came out to be $40 a person, which I find very reasonable for such high quality food! This meal was definitely worth cancelling out my gym workout that I had so rigorously undertaken right before.",

    "review_text": "In retrospect of being a true catholic, beliefs are not to eat meat every Friday starting lent. My favorites wanted to eat Korean food, but two of us couldn't eat meat, what comes to one of our minds was a recommendation to Sotto Mare.   *Note make reservations or come early!! we waited for 45mins and the hostess said we were the last party they were taking.  Sotto Mare is a family owned business, located in the north beach area next to many local bars. Upon our wait, you are given a light up lobster to notify your table is ready. What's cool is that the lobster has a high frequency that can reach the end of the block, so you are able to bar hop while waiting LOL great idea right?   As we walk in, our welcoming hostess kept us informed that we are going to love it here since we were newbies. Browsing through the menu,Yelp guided us through what were the hott items we should order. What looked appealing &amp; got me sprung?  Only the finest/fresh bed of oysters and an oyster shot! Drove me bananas!!! yes perfect aphrodisiac that will get your engines started!! Seconds please!!  Pay attention right here- The Cioppino-It's big enough for three, brimming with clams, mussels, shrimp, tiny scallops and loads of crab. The sauce thickly coats all the seafood, the spices flick the tip of the tongue. Penne pasta in the bottom is a surprise addition, but a good way to help capture more of the sauce; what's left can be sopped up with the bread. Baby light my fire!!  Sand Dabs- filleted, generally 10 pieces splayed on the plate with little room left for the vegetables - thick chunks of orange and yellow carrots and a long-stemmed bouquet of broccoli de cicco, all cooked almost too al dente.  Did someone say I want Pasta? A light linguine pasta smothered with their special sauce. We needed some carbs besides bread, so it came in handy.  In the midst of eating, the food left our tummies feeling full. Shall I say I'm fiending to go back again? YES I am!!",

Combine the two = explosive! \u00a0None of my SF trips have ever completed without a North beach trip. You know, where all the little Italian places are? And they all speak the language like they are all back in Italia! Veneiza, Firanze, Roma, Pulgia etc etc.  I found this place in the spring of 2012 after eating right next door! \u00a0They had burrata (my obsession) . But walking past Sotto Mare changed my mind. Instead of having lunch next door as planned, I tried their cheese , had some wine and came right back to here. Oh you amazing smelling restaurant you!  First thing you notice is the chalk board with fish dishes written across. We waited a bit of our sunny outside table and got seated by the owner Gigi herself. She's one fiesty italian lady! We laughed at one of her mumurs ( she was making fun of someone but I heard it and we both laughed). That was it. We became friends! :)   Back to food- Sotto Mare litereally translate to under the sea. I love all things that end with Mare. Frutti di mare anyone? And as the name says, their specialty is seafood.   Grilled San Dabs - Gigi recommended and this was wow! I've been back for a few too many times after my initial visit and I still get this dish. It's grilled fish with lemons. Simple? Yes! Tasty? Definitely!!  Oysters- yumm  Scallops sautee- delish!  Pasta frutti di mare? \u00a0Linguine with seafood. You can have it with olive oil or tomato sauce. I've always gone with the tomato sauce since it was so tasty.  The best DAMN crab cioppino?????? Yes!! Yes and yes!! This is what you will come back here for. If you hate any and everything, try this. You will LOVE this. This can make the grumpiest grump in the world smile. ( well, as long as they like seafood) \u00a0This is something you'll have to share. It is huge.   2013 visits to SF all included that cioppino and sand dabs. I can still taste it on my breath. Yummmm. Definitely worth a returning trip. Definitely. I have yet to come here for dinner but I'm pretty sure it will be crazy busy. The inside looks like some cooky korky place but it's still cute. Maybe next time I'll sit by the counter so I can check out all the actions. In the mean time, I'll be dreaming \u00a0about my bottle of pinot grigio. grilled sand dabs and best damn crab cioppino meal over here in Seattle!",

It is terrible and you should just give up and go straight to a parking garage. The one I went to was less than 5 minutes away and it costs 6 bucks for 1-2 hours. Reasonable I guess. I made a reservation at 6:30 and it was just a breeze. The place is small inside and if I arrived then without a reservation, the wait would probably be over an hour. They give you cheapish bread but it holds you down while you wait for your food.   1) Cioppino- This is a big ol pot that costs $44 or so. This is loaded with so much seafood including crabs, squid, clams, mussels, penne pasta in this tomato sauce. This could be a huge pasta dish soup that tastes good but not crazy knock the socks off. The seafood was plentiful and still very good. I would get this because it seems like a classic Italian dish that I do not see at like Macaroni Grill. Two people can split just this and still have leftovers but my group of three wanted to try more. 2) Sand Dabs- this is pretty much grilled fish fillets that taste a bit buttery but are still very flavorful. There are a few bones in there so watch out. I would get this to try it out even though it costs over $20. 3) Risotto- This has squid in there and is buttery as heck but that is what risotto is. I needed carbs in here so this was a good dish to have. I would possibly try the pasta dishes since those look super good.  The people here are super nice and friendly- the waiters and the fellow guests :) Make sure to find gelato in Little Italy after ;)",

First off I have to agree with the other reviewers, the clam chowder is outstanding! \u00a0Lots of clams, tender potatoes, and creamy without being too heavy - simply delicious!   Our main course was \"The Best Damn Crab Cioppino\" with seafood. \u00a0I'm usually dubious when a menu says it's enough for two, especially when it's referring to seafood. But sure enough, it was plenty for two. \u00a0In a huge silver bowl was a half a cracked dungeness crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, bay scallops, white fish and rigatoni pasta. The cioppino was very good, almost perfect...almost. \u00a0But it was missing fennel; for me, fennel is a key ingredient for cioppinio that would have given it greater depth.  A caveat is if you're not a bread eater, the cioppino may not be enough. Mind you, we weren't eating the bread to get full, we really enjoyed using it to soak up the great broth with torn chunks of bread.  We'll certainly be back and I'll indulge in some oysters and clams on the half-shell, and more clam chowder!",

We ordered the Cioppino, which came with a lot of different seafood including mussels, crab, clams, shrimp, and more! It even had some penne pasta on the bottom of the big pot although not a ton of it. The sauce was really what made it good. It was a tomato-y sauce. I put some of that on my bread since there was so much sauce and it was super good! This was all for $41... To feed two! The menu says it feeds two and it really does. I mean, we had gotten a half order of plain Alfredo pasta ($8) \u00a0just because we figured the Cioppino be flavorful and some extra carbs might be nice. The Alfredo pasta was really plain though so it just put it in my sauce from the Cioppino to make it better. That was definitely a good use of my sauce!   The waitresses here are really nice too. They check on us a lot and make sure we are okay. It really feels like the ladies care what our experience is like, which I love.

It is at least worth a try if you like cooked seafood, red broths and sauces or stews. That's the best I can explain it.  We also ordered two dozen oysters which were fantastically fresh, and a mussel/clam combo steamed in broth ($19) and it didn't disappoint either. I like linguine and their Linguine with Manila Clams ($17) was something I could have eaten on my own no problem. It is a basic dish, but here it was good. The Grilled Sand Dabs ($19) was okay, not bad but not great - but I'm not a fish fillet person to judge it accurately but I did have a few. All of that food fed four people well.  The confusing part was the entrance as the place has patio and then the front door and then a wall/divider next to another Italian restaurant. This is the second time I've been to the area and it still took me a bit to focus on which restaurant is the correct one, lol. We sat downstairs, going through some twists and turns to reveal dining areas that were two or three times the size of the upstairs, which felt like a small diner. The people here are friendly, yes. Corkage is $10/bottle now.  I read about Sotto Mare from one of my favorite yelpers, KathyV, so I made her take me here, lols! Okay, just kidding, but I can see why she had noprobs returning here.

Damian and I happily sat outside at a table whilst waiting for a table inside.  The Cioppino was the recommended call and so we jumped in with both feet, bib on straight and didn't look back.   Wow, what a reward!  Did I mention that the owner and all wait staff were brilliant and came complete with a well-appreciated sense of humor.  Yeah, I recommend Soto Mare and hope to see ya'll down there real soon.",

We drooled over the menu a bit before deciding on seafood risotto and \"the best damn Cioppino\". With a name like that how could I pass it up? We snacked on bread dipped in oil and vinegar to pass the time. Then, the waitress brought out bibs. We adorned them quite fashionably.  Once we were properly dressed for the occasion, we dug in. Literally. And guess what? It was the best damn cioppino. The seafood -- crab, mussels, clams, squid, scallops and shrimp were all cooked to perfection. Not a single piece was overdone. The risotto was nothing scoff at. It, too, was wonderfully prepared. This meal was the perfect welcome to San Francisco.",

But then I always seem to say that, until I discover yet another one. Arrived for our reservations at 6:00pm. Party of 5. We were celebrating one of the gals birthday in our group Sandy. We were seated promptly downstairs. Have to admit, it was much quieter which I liked. Immediately we were given bread &amp; butter. But the bread was not warm and the butter was ice cold. Oh well. We each started off with a cocktail. I had a Moscow Mule (change it up a bit). Now onto the food....We each started with a bowl of Red Clam Chowder which was AMAZING. Had tiny pieces of clams, potatoes, \u00a0LEEKS AND bacon. It was out of this world delicious! \u00a0 We then had Bay Shrimp Cocktail which might be the best I've ever had. The seafood at this place is sooooo fresh. For our main, I had the Bay Scallop Fettucini. The scallops were done perfectly &amp; the noodles were just al-dente (which I'm picky about). The girls ordered Grilled Sand Dabs, and two shared the Crab Choppino, &amp; one had what I had. Everyone LOVED their food. Generous portions. My cream sauce to the fettucini was out of this world! Service was right on. I think our waiter got a little annoyed with us as we were having a discussion about which wine to order with dinner &amp; I guess we weren't fast enough to his liking. Lol. They do not serve dessert here but that's okay because after, we were headed to my house to enjoy strawberry shortcake &amp; coffee or champagne.  Once we got home to our dessert, we popped in a movie (some old classic called American Beauty) &amp; the girls didn't leave till 1:30am. Great evening had by all!",

We ordered the Cioppino to share (definitely doable, maybe even among three small people), oyster shooters, and a glass of Trebbiano for each of us. The Cioppino is delicious - I think of it often. The seafood chunks are generous, crab legs cracked for you, and broth so bread-soaking worthy. The oyster shooters were average, but the Trebbiano was the absolute best match for our meal.

Me: Hi. \u00a0I'd like to add my name to the list. \u00a0How long is it for a table for 2? Hostess from Hell (in an annoyed tone): What'd I just tell that guy?!  I admit it was my fault for not making a reservation, but the hostess could've handled the situation better. \u00a0It actually took her more words to be rude to me than to just say an hour. Also, it looked like they had tables with only two seats so I figured the wait might be different. \u00a0I think I'll spend my hard earned money elsewhere. \u00a0Thank you very much!

Initially the restaurant told us they were booked solid for the night but would be able to accommodate our party as soon as the restaurant opened. Luckily, an early meal wasn't a problem for us, and we showed up at 5pm just before the rush.  We started off with half dozen each of the east coast and west coast oysters and quickly ordered an additional round - they were so fresh and absolutely delicious!   Next we ordered two rounds of the seafood risotto, lobster ravioli and the lemon caper butter sole, and I highly recommend all three. The risotto dish was piled high with seafood, and I was pleasantly surprised at the variety. The lobster ravioli was rich and creamy, and there wasn't a bite of sole leftover.

The hostess was lovely and was really considerate to make sure the customers are comfortable. Most of the larger tables were reserved, so my friend and I sat at the bar, in front of their open kitchen.   We came here only to try the cioppino, since it's called the \"Best Damn Crab Cioppino.\" We also ordered a bowl of clam chowder to share because we wanted to try one more thing on the menu. The chowder was really good. Nice and chunky with a lot of ingredients, but it was not too thick either. For a whopping $41, the cioppino had a ton of seafood in it. A great amount of crab that had a great amount of meat. Although a cioppino is all about the seafood, to me, it's about the sauce or broth. The broth at Sotto Mare's was super bland and did not have much flavor. It literally just tasted like cooked tomatoes. For the price, the amount of seafood is generous, but it just lacked the flavor I was looking for.  I would love to come back to try one of their pasta dishes or the risotto because it did look delish when other people ordered it!",

The tomato based sauce was light and complimented the seafood very well... also very good with the pasta the complimentary bread. My boyfriend and I were in total silence while eating this food.

The very enthusiastic owner (or the man I believe to be the owner) is very eccentric, much like the eclectic decor of the small restaurant, and is very proud of his cioppino. He boasts that it takes days to create the perfectly savory tomato broth from scratch and, to be honest, I can taste the difference. This cioppino is phenomenal. It's served in a large enough for sharing pot and topped to the brim with loads of fresh seafood -- cracked crab, juicy chunks of fish, bay shrimp, fresh mussels, tender calamari -- pretty much the entire ocean and some penne pasta (if you can find it).   In addition to their fantastic cioppino, their clam chowder is also one of the best I have ever tasted. I never share my bowl... it's always ALL for me :) Whatever they do to that chowder, I say keep doing it because it's perfectly creamy, hearty, and studded with chunks of clams and potatoes. MMM and drool and MMM and drool... repeat til the bowl is licked clean.   Once at the recommendation of the owner, I tried the grilled sand dabs and although they were good, I don't believe they were worth the $20 price tag.   All in all, I like this place a lot.

The meal cost was average given the North Beach location compared to the other restaurants in the area. The place got crowded fast, or maybe because of the limited dining tables. Regardless, the food was tasty, hot, and plentiful.",

It was just Hubby and I so we were seated at the counter. We ordered the Seafood Risotto and Shrimp and Scallop saute. It took 30mins before we received our meals. This was lunch time and there was only 3 other tables of people. No apologies, no waitress interaction at all. The chef's and waitress's seemed to not get along. We witnessed two little spats between the chefs and waitress's. Awkward. Especially since we are sitting there with no food. Once we did get out food, it was nothing special. The seafood was fresh but the garlic overpowered my risotto. The shrimp and scallop were fresh but something that we could have made at home. Not worth a second trip.",

Since we're weren't that hungry we only got a few things:  6 raw oysters on half shell West Coast $1.50 ea - they were fine. \u00a0  I got a cup of Boston Clam Chowder- I liked it. \u00a0It was thick, full of clams &amp; potatoes. \u00a0Creamy &amp; not goopy.

The cioppino was so flavorful and all the seafood was cooked perfectly (overcooked shrimp and mussels are the worst!). The mini pot was loaded with clams, mussels, calamari/squid, crab, and shrimp. There's also a fair amount of pasta hidden underneath. When they said that the food is enough for two, it is definitely enough for two. We shared a bottle of Pinot Grigio, 4 oyster shooters (two were complementary since it was my friend's birthday), and the cioppino. We were both so full that we can barely walk, and we still didn't finish the pastas.   The service was impeccable. All the waitresses were amazingly nice and super attentive. Yes the wait is long (over an hour), but it is definitely worth the wait. I recommend coming earlier if you have party of 2 or less (reservations can only be made for 3+ people). The wait should be a lot shorter if you come before 6:30.   I can't wait to be back!",

First up, we ordered a dozen oysters. Huge, fresh, delicious. The salsas were great too. We then ordered the Cioppino for two.   Best. Decision. Ever. It was huge and it was messy (we got bibs), it was packed to bursting with prime fresh seafood - crab legs, calamari, prawns, \u00a0mussels... everything! And the sauce was absolutely delicious. Tucking in was fabulous!  I have no idea what the reviewer who said it tasted like it was made from tomato paste was going on about - we actually had cioppino the next night as well in a different establishment, and THAT tasted like a cheap pasta sauce. This one was the real deal - super fresh, just enough garlic to pack a punch and a great balance of flavors overall.   One liberally splattered table, several plates of piled shells and two very happy tummies later, we grinned and toasted the wonderful food with our equally delicious Prosecco. Best meal out of the year so far!  Our waitress was great fun - forthright, amusing and utterly charming! It was the busiest part of the evening, but she managed to get our orders to us in reasonable time, and made us feel absolutely welcome.   Again, I didn't see any signs of poor service. The ambiance is casual and friendly - if you expect silver service, then this probably isn't the place for you. We were made welcome, got our food in reasonable time - and it was good!

The owner definitely doesn't like repeating himself or waiting for you to order, so do make up your mind quickly. That being said, it's hard to go wrong. We got ourselves an order of clam chowder; I wouldn't necessarily say it's worthy of the best chowders from the New England area, but it was definitely above average.  But hands down, the entrees, in terms of quantity, pure heartiness, and taste, is probably the best damn Italian food I've had. I got the linguine with smoked salmon in alfredo sauce...wow, what a treat. First, they do NOT skimp on the salmon; you get your money's worth of salmon with the dish. The sauce is definitely on the heavier side, but it is full of flavor and goes very well with the smoky flavor of the salmon. My girlfriend got the seafood risotto, which she absolutely loved as well. I'm not a big a fan of risotto as she is, but I had a few bites, and it was delicious. You get a wide variety (and a LOT) of seafood in the dish, and the sauce is perfect with it as well.  We couldn't finish the meal; we had to take it back to the hotel for completion later. But this was amazing, and the price, no less, is very good for what you are getting (I think both our dishes came in under the $20 mark). This was a real treat, and I'm not sure if I've dished out a 50% tip on food alone (the service was okay; the only thing that was good was that we got our food quickly), but it was definitely worth it. Yes, the place is a bit tacky with everything on the wall, but I came for some good Italian seafood dishes, and I most definitely got what I paid for. A must-visit for any lover of Italian or seafood.",

Yes, this place has large portions, low prices (for what you're getting), and impeccably fresh seafood. And it's not like they give you tons and tons of pasta with a little bit of seafood. The risotto probably had more seafood than rice in it, and quite a variety; mussels, shrimp, squid (!!!). Even the pesto, which we were advised against (you're at a seafood restaurant!), was some of the best I've had; and the seafood ravioli were incredible in a very rich tomato sauce. The only thing I wouldn't order again was the Boston Clam Chowder (you're on the West Coast!) , it was good, but nothing special. The cioppino looked absolutely amazing, need to go back here with someone willing to split it.  One not as well known fact about Sotto Mare is that they offer $1.50 (West Coast) oysters at ALL hours, none of this $1 during happy/$3 at other hours crap. And these are some of the freshest, plumpest, juiciest oysters I've had.   Service is friendly but casual, this is the type of place where you're expected to box up your own food to go.  It seems that they only take reservations during the week; but regardless, make sure to get here early, and even then, you'll have to wait a bit. But they give you a really cool plastic lobster that you can take elsewhere for a drink and it will buzz and light up when your table's ready.  But no dessert - it's bad for your cholesterol :)",

The wait would be about an hour, so we put our name down and decided to explore around the area.   The mom/pop restaurant is rather small and confining, but we didn't mind since it was just the two of us any way. We were seated at the bar counter. Our server came over immediately to introduce the menu to us, take drink orders, and to bring us a complimentary basket of bread! She had such an exuberant personality...loved her! She recommended one of their most popular menu items: THE \"BEST DAMN CRAB CIOPPINO\" with seafood ($38.00), which states that it's enough for two people. My friend and I didn't hesitate to order that to share since we're both big seafood fans. I also ordered a side of fresh seasonal vegetables to get our fill of greens for the night.  Wowwww, the Cioppino was beyond impressive. Huge bowl of a rich variety of amazing seafood!! They certainly didn't skimp on portions! Big, breakable shelled portions of crab legs &amp; claws, mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari, scallops, &amp; penne pasta. Beautifully seasoned and absolutely delicious!! The two of us couldn't even finish it all!!  The environment is very fast paced and the noisiness can be overstimulating, so I wouldn't recommend this place if you want to have a quiet, romantic dinner!",

Presented with bread and butter.   We ordered fresh oysters which were amazing and the fresh clams were not so good. We also ordered linguini with seafood which contained a lot of seafood with a decent sauce. However, the pasta was way over cooked and not al dente at all. Far from Italian pasta. If you've been to Italy, you know what I'm talking about. -1 star here. In addition, we ordered steamed clams which contained a lot of clams as you can see in the picture. However, the broth was so salty we couldn't even use it to dip the clams in. We asked them to remake it, to be less salty. When they brought back the new dish, it was completely unsalted which we didn't ask for. -1 star here. Final thing we ordered was the seafood risotto which had a good flavor but nothing too special.   Pros: portion size is huge Cons: pasta is not al dente and remake of clams was tasteless without salt.",

    "review_text": "This place was hilarious. \u00a0The whole night was a mess, but a tasty one, and for that I award you four stars.  Getting a table here on any night is a clusterfuck. \u00a0The hostess at the front was the Megatron of hostessing, as in she was a robot and yelled a lot. \u00a0And could transform into a Walther P38. \u00a0We were given a buzzer. \u00a0It went off while my party was across the street, finishing up drinks. \u00a0I ran over to try and reserve our spot. \u00a0No can do, shouted Megatron, everyone needs to be here. \u00a0They show up five minutes later and our table has been given away.  Something really rustles Megatron's jimmies at this point because all of a sudden she's SHOUTING. \u00a0The whole front doorway is packed with bodies and the sudden influx of people has fried our poor hostess's circuits. \u00a0She kicks like three couples out, then rushes off, muttering. \u00a0Lolque?  She returns, much calmer this time. \u00a0She has found seating for all the remaining guests. \u00a0She also grabs two bottles of wine and starts indiscriminately handing out glasses to everyone left, ostensibly as an apology for wigging out just minutes earlier. \u00a0This is just as weird as when she flipped out in the first place. \u00a0But now we have wine so whatever.  We finally get seated and order 3 sand dabs and 1 seafood linguini. \u00a0No one warned us that each plate of sand dabs came with 35 sand dabs, and there is way too much food to finish. \u00a0They were light, fresh, and delicious. \u00a0The seafood linguini is packed with residents of the sea, and perfectly seasoned. \u00a0It was actually good enough to negate the earlier abuse from Megatron. \u00a0  We finally paid and left, two hours after we first arrived. \u00a0It was a very aggressive, very delicious meal. \u00a0If nothing else, the hostess has a lucrative career as a dominatrix should she ever choose to stop berating people for fun and get paid for it instead.",

We went on an evening of a 90 degree day in SF- it was a cool 80 on the street and a toasty 100 degree + inside. We were dripping uncomfortably throughout the meal but we still had a great time. Would have liked to enjoy my meal more but it was so damn hot that all I was looking forward to was getting out of that oven. Of course, this happens twice a decade in SF so not really an issue for everyone. Still, we had a great time and enjoyed everything from oyster shooters to bay shrimp cocktail to truly amazing cioppino to bay scallop fettucine. No coffee, no desert- they tell you \"we want you to eat and get the hell out\". Gigi is a kick and so are ALL the servers.  Anyone who doesn't have a good time here is truly hopeless and full of themselves.  A true San Francisco classic. Awesome in every way for a fun dinner out in The City!",

Also got a bowl of clam chowder that was yummy. \u00a0  Really enjoy the casual, family atmosphere in there and well worth it for a $30-$35 lunch in the city comprised of fresh seafood.

You start with nice crusty bread and butter which is pretty good. Frankly, if you serve crappy bread in a bakery rich city like San Francisco you don't deserve to run a restaurant. We started with 6 clams on the half shell which came with lemon and cocktail sauce. Hard to mess this one up, but the clams were fresh, sweet and delicious.  We then went for the cioppino for 2, which was undoubtedly the star of the show. There's a reason it's mentioned so many times in these reviews. The broth has excellent depth of flavor, and the serving size is massive! The bowl was packed with a ton of crab legs, mussels, calamari, scallops and penne pasta.

We are a house divided when it comes to which is better- I like the East Coast and the hubby likes the West Coast.   Meal- Cioppino! One tureen is large enough for two people. The amount, variety and quality of the seafood is superb. We ordered this on our first visit and haven't ever ordered anything else in our 20 or so visits! It's that good!   They don't do desserts here, but will provide you with a list of good places that are close by.   The atmosphere is absolutely amazing. A family run establishment, you can tell the employees take pride in the establishment and the food they serve. Yes, this place does get VERY busy- especially on weekends during tourist season, but there are plenty of bars for you to enjoy a cocktail while you wait. The woman that runs the show may come off a bit abrasive, but I think that's just her personality and a testament to how busy they are. She runs a highly efficient and delicious restaurant, so if you are prone to getting your feelings hurt, just get over yourself for a night. I find her to be quite friendly and entertaining, but I have read several reviews where people say she was rude. I just don't see that- it's not in her style. \u00a0They often have an accordion player to entertain guests and Gigi himself comes around to \u00a0chat with customers.

My first time I tried the cioppino, of course. Our waitress was great with recommendations. She advised that we share the cioppino, which ended up being more than plenty. Flavor wise I wasn't impressed.   The second time around I came in with a larger group I thought I would try something else. I ordered just the mussels and everyone else ordered a pasta dish. None of us left full or satisfied. The mussels were over cooked, and the flavor was extremely plain. In a group of 5, you would think one person would at least be happy with their order but it just didn't happen. A few of them were from out of town and felt like this place was more of a tourist spot, and not a local spot. I would agree 100%. Service the second time was a bit disappointing. The waitress seemed inexperienced and as if she was in a great hurry. We were also sat at the table downstairs, which surprised me because I didn't know they were that spacious. Being downstairs I felt like we were a bit neglected. It was difficult to call for a waitress and get our bill.   I won't be coming back. I don't believe in third chances.",

Our waitress looked anxious to get us out of there, and we didn't even get a table so we had to sit at the bar type tables as the regular tables were reserved. The whole time we were there only one of the 8 tables even showed up. I don't see why their banquet room for larger parties couldn't be used instead. We felt so hurried after being there for only an hour from 5:30 to 6:30 that we left to get dessert and finish our conversation elsewhere.

    "review_text": "Summary: The Best Damn Crab Cioppino is the best I've had. Was it life changing and mind blowing? No, but it's worth trying once to meet Gigi, find a decent Italian place in North Beach worth a splurge and feast on super fresh seafood in a fun, homey atmosphere.  When I read other reviews about the cozy decor and family-like feel, I thought it would be kitschy and cliche, but I was wrong. Gigi runs Sotto Mare like it's a hole-in-the-wall family-owned diner in a suburb. The staff greeted regulars and chatted with customers, like friends. Our service was prompt and perfectly attentive without being overbearing. We were given bibs, and it just felt right to put it on, in spite of my usual feelings of being a toddler again with a bib.  My friend and I met at Sotto Mare for dinner at 7 on a Tuesday night and barely waited 5 minutes for a table. Don't worry if there's a wait. I saw waiting diners later on that night being given glasses of house wine; on the house, I assume. Seating looks limited from the view at the host stand, but there's seating on other floors, and boy, do they turn tables fast. We split the Cioppino for $38 (pre-tax/tip) and skipped drinks, which was wise since we BARELY finished between the two of us. The tomato broth/sauce had a very mild kick, which gave the dish some depth and complexity. More than being an amazing tomato sauce (which they sell in quarts), the star was the seafood. Some of the freshest and plumpest scallops, shrimp, crab, mussels and clams I've had in a very long time. I was impressed that the crab was so fresh and well-cooked that I didn't have to wrestle it very much (and splatter myself in the process) to get to the sweet, juicy meat. The cioppino included some penne, also, but there was so much seafood and sauce that I ended up mopping up a lot of it with the house bread.  I'd love to come back again with more people to try more dishes, but above all, I'm glad I found somewhere worthwhile in North Beach. \u00a0Italian in North Beach is pricey just about everywhere with no stellar go-to's, but it looks like Sotto Mare has just become my North Beach go-to. Wahoo!",

This is a very decent brunch alternative! Service was to the point; I'll leave it at that.",

While waiting, we were able to walk around to the corner of the block and still be within the range for the buzzer to alert us our table is ready. The buzzer thing we get to hold onto is shaped like a lobster, which is cute, but they do hold onto your credit card while you have their lobster buzzer.   Got sat inside near the back, which was nice because it was cold out, so being in the back of the restaurant felt pretty warm and cozy. The waitress at first seemed to be out of it, and she wasn't very friendly. We ordered 2 dozen oysters among 4 people for $1.50 each, which was delicious! We had the West Coast oysters which were cheaper than the East Coast, even though we read that it tasted better. But, the West Coast oysters were pretty bomb too. Each pair ordered a Seafood pasta -- my boyfriend and I had the Alfredo fettuccine with seafood, while my other two friends had a mixed sauce and linguine. I honestly liked my Alfredo sauce better so I liked our order of seafood pasta better than the other sauce my friends chose. The scallops that came in the seafood part of the pasta was so delicious to bite into. Soft, but not soft enough to break right away when you bite into it. It was still a firm texture which I liked a lot! We finished everything, even the basket of bread. Definitely filling to share an order of pasta for two along with an order of oysters! Each table also comes with a bottle of balsamic vinegar and olive oil for you to eat with for their complimentary bread while waiting for your orders to come!  Will definitely be back for oysters or their seafood pasta OR BOTH! Service was a bit slow and unfriendly, where I docked a point, BUT they were attentive on filling up our glasses of water. Otherwise, I recommend to come!",

I read about the lines on yelp, so we got there around 11 AM Saturday right when it opened, and even by the time we left around 12:30, there were still plenty of spots left! I'd go early to try to get a table outside if possible. We walked inside the restaurant and it was pretty dim, too dim for my liking, so we asked to be moved outside and boy am I glad we did.

Had to have positive reviews on yelp. Long and behold, Sotto Mare. Unfortunately we weren't able to get reservations but we were informed that if we walk-in, it'll be about a 45 minute wait. Not too shabby. So from our hotel (InterContinental) in Union Square, we trekked on what felt like miles to the restaurant. We went through Union Square and all of its glory decked out for the holidays, through a long tunnel in a single file line, through the hustling and bustling of Chinatown and finally arriving at Sotto Mare. It was packed! I'm talking about people flooding outside the door. My friend went in to put his name on the waiting list. He had to WAIT to put his name on the waiting list. How about that for busy? The rest of us were outside trying to stay warm in the crisp cold air. Mind you from what we saw visually of the place, it was small and narrow. We didn't think we would ever get a table but after 15 minutes or so, we got our table! How, you ask? Well fortunately for us, someone called to cancel their reservation for a party of 7 and we just so happen to have a party of 6. I gotta say, I felt like VIP status walking in passing up all those people who were waiting before us. *pop collar*. As we were escorted to our table, I didn't see any tables available. Where were we going to sit? We walked all the way to the end of the room then TADA...stairway down. There were more tables downstairs. Pretty sneaky... =)   We all started off with the clam chowder ($6.50). So, so good! I also had the smoked salmon ($8) appetizer as well. Wow! It was sliced thin and still packed a great fresh taste. For my entre, my BF and I shared \"The Best Damn Crab Cioppino\" ($38 enough for 2) w/ seafood and I'm not making it up. That's what it says on the menu and they're not exaggerating either. It was THE BEST DAMN CRAB CIOPINNO I ever had. It's the only I've ever had. Don't think I could have it anywhere else now. We pretty much emptied the pot it came in...well I think I did more of the emptying of the pot. It was some good stuff.   I would love to go back next time we're in SF!

My daughters had pesto penne and the mussel steamers and were completely enthralled. What a great family, small restaurant atmosphere.   The wine was just okay, but everything else - including the service, was fantastic. A new favorite for all of us!",

I had been warned by a friend about a possible looooong wait to be seated, but we were lucky enough to arrive a few minutes before it got crowded and were seated right away. Only downside is the size of the place; our tiny table for two was against the wall with little space for people to pass through and kept being nudge by passersby which was annoying. But food was excellent and would definitely go back for more cioppino.",

And if asking for new forks (after our old ones have been cleared) is considering us a problematic table...then I can't even imagine someone w special allergies or dietary conditions would even have to deal with.... I just have to say... We are considering calling the BBB... Seriously... Who says \"Happy Birthday! Get the FUCK out!!\" ?????? My friend is still crying!! And that was 45 min ago!!!! I'm sorry!!!

It's San Francisco so those two where no brainers.  For dinner, my sister and I split their fresh fish of the day served with roasted vegetables and a pasta. The fish was a light flaky sole panfried topped with a lemon garlic butter caper sauce. It was perfect with the fish. I love very simple pasta so we got the Spaghetti aglio e olio which is just fresh pressed garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes, parsley, and parmesan cheese. So simple yet so delicious.

Started off with steamed mussels. They were good, but steamed mussels are an easy crowd pleaser, so I was not thoroughly impressed, though they were pleasant to pick at with the house chardonnay on our outdoor seating.  Next came our 2 dozen west coast oysters on the half shell and steamed crab. Crab was good--served cold and delicious with salt and some lemon juice, though I did not enjoy the presentation, crushed and dumped over a layer of green lettuce--soggy. Oysters were good too; not the flat type. They were small and sweet, fantastic with the horseradish.   We finished off with Risotto--I liked. Slightly bland, but shrimp is good touch. Must have some parmesan with, although I was disappointed to find that they had no freshly shaved/ground parmesan--green plastic bottle kraft parmesan was provided in a tin bowl, which wasn't fooling anybody, really.  Overall a pleasant experience as the weather in SF that day was beautiful and I had some fantastic company. Not sure whether I would return before taking a look at Fog House first, unless I come back just for some Cioppino (i had gone to sotto mare and did not order their famous Ciopinno...sad) but this is a nice place to sit down for some chill seafood in a cute neighborhood.",

We happened to just drive by the area, found the place on Yelp, and decided to try it out. When we got there, there was an hour wait, so we were given a pager and went next door to the local bar to watch the Giants game and have a beer.   We went back into the restaurant after we were done with our beers from the place next door, and waited inside. The restaurant is very small, so I'd recommend going there early, especially if you have a large party.   While we were waiting in the front, the lady, who I believe owns the place, gave us a free glass of wine since we had been waiting a long time. Talk about hospitality! The whole experience felt very genuine. The lady who works there was Italian and had that warm personality which made us feel very welcomed.   We ordered the Ciopinno, which in my opinion, is the BEST I've ever tasted in San Francisco. The Seafood was fresh and the broth was flavorful. It came with bread, so you could soak up all of the broth! It's safe to say this has got to be one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco.",

Our table of four indulged in clam chowder, saut\u00e9ed shrimp with vegetables (the sauce was light and tasty - the veggies adequate,) and the CIOPINO (caps for emphasis - this stuff is the BEST! It had a lot of everything you love and expect from this dish.) Those of us enjoying that fish stew were adorned with tastefully draped bibs to keep their clothing in as good a condition as they were in when they entered.  The only downside for our evening was that there was quite a wait for our food to be served. To be fair there was a large banquet party in their banquet room and it put extra strain on the cooking and service staff who work very diligently to make sure things are prepared and served at lightening speed even when such crowded conditions make it more difficult.  Do give them a try; and if you are going to see Beach Blanket Babylon, it's a great place to eat before the show. Just be sure to allow time for lingering over your food and for possible service delays.",

    "review_text": "We strolled into Sotto Mare at 6:30 on a Friday night and managed to land the last two counter seats. Lucky us!  We started out with a half dozen west coast oysters. At only $1.50, these oysters were amazing, as we probably should have ordered more, except for how much food we knew we had coming.  For our main, we split an order of the cioppino, which really was some of the best we'd ever had. The shellfish was plentiful, and was perfect--very fresh and cooked just right. The penne at the bottom was also al dente perfection, which doesn't always happen in soups and stews. What makes their cioppino special is the sauce, though. It's a thick tomato base, but isn't so tomatoey that it overpowers the rest of the dish; this is tough to do.  Sotto Mare's dessert menu is entertaining. It's basically a laminated letter from the owner stating that she cannot consciously serve desserts, knowing how bad they are for her customers' health. She then goes on to recommend some of her favorite local dessert spots, should you still want to indulge somewhere else. The fact is, the cioppino is so big, that dessert was the last thing on our mind anyway!",

Highly recommend you have them too. The wife had the cioppino. She was engrossed in it, although a few days later she said it was a little burnt. Still, she did quite a bit of damage to it. I'm not sure anyone could eat a whole one. It's huge!! On Knob Hill this place would cost double. \u00a0I would like to see a more refined wine list.   It is in the heart of North Beach.

If you really want to go all out though, get the cioppino. Best cioppino i have had in the city, maybe anywhere. The stuff is just a magic potion of ocean creatures and flavor. Everything is cooked to perfection and the flavor just lingers in your mouth for ever. Also, one order is more than enough for two, especially if your getting other entrees.   I hate soju, but apparently they were in the oyster shooters we were slurping down all night and i have no complaints. Spicy, citrusy, salty ocean goodness.   The place is small, but it reminds me of an Italian kitchen. Steamy, smells and scents a-loft everywhere permeating every corner of the place. The wait staff is usually very busy, but they are very friendly and courteous. The hostess is a very nice lady as well, she reminds me of my Italian grandmother. Very upfront and curt, but she is sweet and welcoming at the same time. Just don't get in her way. That's her kitchen back there.",

    "review_text": "There's a reason this restaurant constantly have long lines and packed seating. This place is amazing! They offer reservations for parties or 3+ but for 2 people and under it's a first come first serve basis. Come early! They stop serving dinner at 9:30 and if you're not seated yet, you're SOL. They will take names but waiting is at your own risk. Just because your name is on the list doesn't mean you're guaranteed to be seated.   My boyfriend and I arrived at around 5:30. They give you a lobster that vibrates and lights up when it's your turn to be seated. When we arrived they said the wait is around 45 minutes to 1 hour, but that wait time depends on how fast or slow people eat. When we came there were a lot of big parties seated so they ordered multiple dishes, sat and talked after dinner, and it being such a small restaurant, we ended up waiting for 2 hours before we were actually seated. I'm not mentioning all this to complain, it's just so others will know what to expect when they get there. We have been warned by friends who have recommended this restaurant and that's why we came early. But when we were leaving we heard others complain about being on the list and not being seated before they were closing.   Getting all that explanation out of the way, their cioppino is made for 2 people and comes in this big silver cauldron. My boyfriend and I ordered one to share. We are both big eaters and was worried it wouldn't be enough food! But by the time we finished the cioppino, it ended up being a perfect amount that filled us up, but there was no left overs like other people mention.   The cioppino had a variety of perfectly cooked and tender seafood such as shrimp, baby clams, oysters, and crab. The crab was pre cracked so it was really easy to eat without the need of extra utensils. This place had THE best cioppino I have ever had and would definitely recommend this place. I would come back again next time I'm in town, even if it means I have to wait another 2 hours.",

It is a small restaurant that has a cozy neighborhood feel to it and I got the impression that it is the kind of place locals go. A big plus as we try to avoid touristy places.   We skipped on apps and salads as we had a late lunch and had dinner reservations later that evening, which was a great idea as the entrees were really big. I had the Chef's Choice Seafood Risotto and it was one of the best risottos I have ever had. All the seafood was fresh and the risotto was cooked perfectly. There was a nice balance of shrimp, mussels, clams, and scallops. My wife ordered the mussels and they were really good too. There was no grit to the mussel and the broth was amazing. We were both really happy with what we ordered, but as we looked around the restaurant it seemed everyone was ordering either the Crab Cioppino or the Grilled Sand Dabs Fillets. Both looked amazing and I will have to try them next time I am in San Francisco.   The beer and wine lists are nothing spectacular, but they are more the sufficient. The service was fine too, and we got to sit at the bar and watch the cooks in action. I'm giving this place 5 stars as the food was excellent and would be what I expected a fine dining restaurant and not at a casual neighborhood eatery. \u00a0I highly recommend checking this place out.",

It reminds me of a 50's diner actually.  The cioppino itself was great and comes in a huge pot that definitely feeds two. It's a seafood party inside the soup with clams, mussels, fish,shrimp,and crab. There's also some penne pasta thrown into the mix. The waitress even ties a lobster bib on to you because its a messy affair when you start eating it. Overall, the taste was good, but I don't think it was worth the $42. It needed some more spice and just more flavor in general. But still, i love seafood in general so I was happy eating every last drop.   Still a place worth going to at least once I say but its gonna be pricey.",

Our group of three was hungry so naturally we ordered as if we were a group of six. We dined on a dozen West coast oysters, linguine with Manila clams, cioppino, mussel steamers, a bowl of chowder and the sea scallop saut\u00e9. The oysters were fresh and I didn't have the knee-jerk reaction of a reverse swallow as compared to my previous oyster attempts. Beyond tolerating them, I found myself genuinely declaring \"these are really good!\" to my two friends who were glad I finally got on the oyster train. The generously portioned cioppino lived up to the hype and we (let's be real, mostly myself) scraped every bit of it from the bowl. The scallops were dope as well as the linguine.   Do make a reservation as this place gets crazy busy. Even with a reservation, you won't be seated until your entire party is present. Service was excellent and super thoughtful for passing out those bibs. Because you know, adults easily convert into toddlers with poor fine motor skills when provided with saucy seafood dishes and crustaceans to crack open.",

    "review_text": "No matter how on time I was, B was always ahead of me. Finding parking in North Beach was not difficult, not really, except for today. I had to route to the residential areas and walk back onto Green. We've eaten at restaurants on Green a number of times, it seems, and every time it's been great. This place often had a line, and it was the restaurant B wanted to eat at for his birthday. It did not take reservations and you couldn't put a name on the list until both parties arrived. No matter, we got in and they had counter space for us. I handed B a small birthday goodie bag including a German birthday card. I scribbled on it last minute, he struggled to read it, just then the menu arrived.  B informed me that he had gone on a no carb diet, trying to lose some weight to look more attractive. I wanted to say that every CEO / Founder I knew in this town had been on it and everyone of them wanted to look better. Is that a prerequisite for middle age men running startups? They wanted to be successful in both front - career and appearance. B had nothing to worry, he looked like he was still in his 30s. But still...   Staff promptly delivered bread and it remained untouched by the two us throughout the meal.  B said that on his actual birthday a large bouquet of carved fruit and chocolate basket arrived. Shipped from California to Pennsylvania, where he was working at at the time. \u00a0It also came with a much better handwriting card, and it ended with such sentimentality that put mine to shame. That card said \"I love you more with each passing year.\" My card ended with \"Pardon my doctor-style handwriting.\" That basket of goodies came from his elusive girlfriend, whom I've yet to meet, and from the sound of it, no one had ever met her. With that thought, I took a sip of water. Damn no carb diet.  From the counter, where I sat, I could see them shucking oysters. B promptly ordered a dozen. They were bigger than the usual tiny ones, and I was about to say \"Thank goodness they were substantial\" when B beat me to the punch. It was exceptionally fresh and rather tasty.   Seeing that we'd not seen each other for a while, we covered the basics: work, family, trips, anecdotical facts and hearsay about friends we may or may not have in common. \u00a0Just like that, we were caught up.  B said that it was said that the restaurant was famous for sand dabs so he got that. I went for Rex Sole. Both came with vegetables and both were delicious. The no carb diet makes you appreciate restaurants that offered variety, especially when the said restaurant was an Italian one.   The last few times we were on Green street looking for food, there were always lines out of the door for this restaurant, but we were spared of such treatment today. A Brit sitting next to us by the bar inquired about our dishes, and was also giddy that he got in without much wait time.   While B busied with caring for his young son this past weekend, I was busy with my own activities. I told him about the woman I met at a party and how I liked her, though I did not take down her name or number when the evening ended. He smiled broadly and was visibly entertained by my story as he ate every piece of his sand dab.   For reasons I could not recall I was pissed at him last year during his birthday, and I did not take him out for food. But over the years we'd done many birthday dinners, first his, a Leo, then mine, a Scorpio. He was not a fussy eater so I could afford to be more casual about it. Here, seafood at this place was exceptionally well prepared with a very San Franciscan feel to it. I was happy that we got into this spot where B had wanted to go for his birthday.  Earlier this year, while in Boston eating food in North End, I was feeling melancholy and lonely for some reason. B sent me a Youtube song, it was Keren Ann's Not Going Anywhere. \u00a0Ever since returning, I find myself frequenting North Beach for San Francisco style Italian, often with B.   As we were saying goodbyes, I couldn't help but wonder which card he liked more, my scribbles on an avant-garde German art card titled \"der Flug\" featuring bats and a larger than life Dracula flying through the darkened sky, or that neatly written floral card accompanying the gianormous fruit and chocolate basket from his alleged mystery girlfriend.   As if he could read my mind, he all of sudden stopped on the sidewalk, \"I love that you wrote 'Iche liebe Diche.' on the card.\" He rattled off those words like a native. Air froze for a second. And then he spoke again, this time, more deliberately: \"Iche liebe Diche.\" I blushed.",

We got: 1) clam chowder (really creamy and delicious) 2) The \"BEST DAMN CRAB CIOPPINO\" - which really was damn good - comes in a red sauce... however if you don't like fishy tasting foods.. you probably won't like this. 3) Fettuccini with Bay Scallops - came in a creamy white sauce which was probably my favorite :D  This restaurant was PACKED when we got there - this restaurant is in I belive the italian district and SOOO many restuarants in the area are closed on Mondays. Not Sotto Mare.. which is probably why there was a LONG waiit.  I thought the place was tiny but later on, we were taken downstairs through the back and i discovered how huge this restaurant is.  Downstairs is more cozy and formal than upstairs so I would ask to sit downstairs if you come.  All in all, our server was sweet, great food, good times!",

Even though I have not been to all or many of the restaurants in Little Italy, I have already decided that it does not matter where you end up eating, because I am sure that everything will taste just as delicious as everything else that I have tasted there so far.   Sotto Mare, just like anywhere else is San Francisco on a Saturday night, was extremely crackin'. It took my boyfriend and I about an hour and a half trying to find parking in Little Italy, but for some weird reason we were able to get seated right away once we arrived here. I guess we got lucky =)   The place was ridiculously small, but it felt very home-y. The employees were very friendly and catering. Once they realized that our bread was gone, they instantly replaced it with a new one, as well as the water. Considering the place was packed (shoulder to shoulder with your neighbor), I assumed it would take a while for our orders to come out --- WRONG! It only took about fifteen minutes!  We ordered the Grilled Sand Dabs (apparently it is a hit with Yelpers) and the Linguine with Manila Clams. Honestly, you can never go wrong with pasta anywhere in Little Italy, so I was already expecting to love the crap out of the linguine. The clams were fresh, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and the white sauce was awesome! The grilled sand dabs were just as good, especially if you squirt that lemon on it, but I don't know if it's just an asian thing, but I wanted to eat rice with it. As much as I enjoyed it, I felt like there was something missing to it; the vegetables on the side, for me, wasn't enough.   Overall, love it here, absolutely do not mind dining here at all, and the price is right =)",

But Sotto Mare thoroughly impressed my family and me so much that we went back several times.   There were many highlights, but here are the ESPN Foodcenter's Top 3  At NUMBER THREE, The Wait Device: Without a reservation, the wait at Sotto could take very long. But to cheer you up, they give you this wait device in the shape of a Lobster. It's so cool.  At NUMBER TWO, The Seafood Risotto: I usually don't like my seafood drowned in sauce/cream because I think that overwhelms the seafood taste. But their Risotto packs that seafood taste right in the sauce, so you get the creaminess and the taste at the same time. Score!  At NUMBER THREE, Sitting Upstairs: Getting seats with Sotto is tough, but you score big time if you get to sit upstairs. Midway through our meal upstairs, when my hands were occupied with a crab leg and a beer, the restaurant started jamming to oldies. They played that '...bye, bye, Miss American Pie...' song and many of the servers and customers started singing along. It was nice and loud and everyone had their grin on. The scene was kinda like 99bottles during a bus ride, but with good food and pretty lights. It was an amazing experience, especially for my Dad cause oldie music really takes him back.  Great place to go for all occasions. Get oyster shooters to toast a new promotion or get cioppino if you wanna get your hands dirty for a birthday. Just remember to make reservations!",

Other items our group got include scallops and different pasta dish, but I wouldn't say they are anything special. We had clams and oysters as appetizers and I think they are good items to share with a large group.

    "review_text": "I stayed at the Grand Hyatt this past Labor Day weekend, and was on a mission to find some good seafood restaurants within walking distance of my hotel. I really didn't need to do all that much searching because Sotto Mare clearly had 5-star reviews galore. Immediately, I called them to make a reservation (for one). Now this was on a Saturday afternoon (around 1 p.m.)  Me: Hi, I'd like to see if I can make a -- Lady: [Interrupting] We're booked. We're booked. Are you calling for a reservation? Because we're booked tonight. Me: Uhm, I'm actually calling to see if you guys have space earlier. Around 4 p.m.  Lady: How many? Me: Just one. Lady: Yeah sure come on in.   Not the nicest way to talk to a potential customer but hey, I'll take what I can get. The lady was DEFINITELY a little rough around the edges.  I walked through Chinatown to get to their restaurant, and the journey was actually a tad bit more enjoyable than the food, sorry to say. Here's why:  Service:   When I first got there, I must have stood at the start of the line for a good five minutes before anyone even looked at me. Then the lady, who I recognized (by her voice) had answered the phone earlier, led me to the counter since I was a party of one. I didn't mind; I was excited to try the food ... they could've sat me in front of the kitchen sink for all I cared!  There were many waitresses so my attention was a tad scattered. I didn't know who I had to order what from, and it took me a decent minute or two to flag someone down to get some water. The silverware and cup were a tad dirty. I think they must be pretty damn proud of their food to disregard service as much as they do here. (But, to their credit, that phone lady did drop by once to ask if everything was going okay.)  What I ordered:  Oyster on a half shell: Meh, not the best I've had as it didn't taste *FRESH* enough but it was fine.  Clam chowder in a cup: I LOVE clam chowder and was really hoping this was good because I hadn't had a cup or a bowl in YEARSSSS but unfortunately, it was a bit too runny for me. I wanted something thick and hearty but what I got was light and choppy. I think if I poured out a Campbell's soup from the can, it would've been chunkier than the *chowder* I got here. DISAPPOINTED.  I wanted to get the cioppino but I didn't want to look like a fat cow eating it by myself so I guess I'll have to reserve that for another time with a dining companion the next time I go up. I ordered a seafood linguine with tomato sauce (as you can see in the picture), and it was pretty delicious. This is part of the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of giving it 3 stars. Although I'm not really a fan of pasta, I appreciated the texture of the pasta (although it's not an Italian restaurant, really), and the LOADS of seafood they put in the dish.   I did, however, almost chip a tooth because I bit into a shell that had broken off. Ugh.  I had so much pasta left over, I took the rest of it back to my hotel. I was stuffed, to say the least, but not in a super happy way where I just want to go back to my hotel and drift off to sleep. I really should've risked looking like a lone cow and ordered the cioppino. *punching myself in the face for the stupid mistake*  Would I try this place again? Sure. I'd come back to try the cioppino everyone keeps raving about. But would I order the clam chowder again? No. Would I order the oyster again? No. Would I expect decent service? No. Would I get the seafood linguine? Probably but I don't think I'd be able to eat that after eating the cioppino. :P   Overall, this restaurant was a slight disappointment as I expected more. Had the clam chowder been better, I would've overlooked the service and would've just given them a 5-star rating. Oh well. Maybe next time!",

There's a short line and no wait list, so just wait at the door and you will be attended to. Sat at the bar and it's loud and festive, everyone was friendly.  Got 4 West Coast oysters for $1.50 each. Not too big and pretty fresh. Came with a wedge of lemon and a dish of cocktail sauce.  A bowl of clam chowder for $6.50. Taste was good, but there was what, like 2 clams chopped up in there? Not like they ran out of clams either. A decent portion.  The seafood linguine. $17 Whoa, so many clams, mussels shrimps (mini), mini scallops, calamari. The ratio was definitely seafood higher! Unbelievable! which is a good thing because the linguine itself was meh! Not al dente, overcooked. Just the right amount of sauce tho. Pretty saucy, but not like a stew.  The crab cioppino $27 was served in a gigantic steel bowl with a cover. We waited About half of a crab worth of legs. A good amount. Relatively fresh and well seasoned. Now I understand why I needed the bibs! Saucy and comes with a myriad of seafood. Was so full after sharing all that, we had just left the overcooked penne pasta.  Service was fine and relatively quick to get our food. Good portions.  ***  Tip: Crab cioppino is what they're known for! big enough to share if you get one more dish.  Favourites: Lots of seafood, do not skimp!   Do not want: Overcooked pasta. sat on a stool in front of the stove.  Last words: Yummy seafood and do not skimp",

The Yelp reviews and the Yelpers' \"get the sand dabs\" tips tipped me over the edge and I stopped in.  After being greeted warmly and shown to the marble-topped bar, I had no sooner taken my seat than was greeted by my friendly server who promptly set me up with an order of sand dabs &amp; Bass ale.   Now - I try not to write reviews until I've had several meals at a spot, but who knows when I'll get back here next? So I'll just say, I've had sand dabs at several SF dinner houses and always felt they could've been better. Au confrere, mon frere, these were excellent! Couldn't have been fresher had the fish jumped off the plate and bitten me in the nose. NOT oily or \"buttered\" up, delicious light flavor. Delivered quickly - and no sooner had I set down my empty ale tankard (ok it was just a glass) than I was offered a second helping of suds.  Accompanied by local sourdough (meh) and fresh brussels sprouts/carrots, I enjoyed all until my fork noisily announced that the plate had been wiped clean.  The place is narrow, not necessarily great for larger groups 'cuz it's small, and it's casual so it would be good for a first date if you want to do it Jerry Maguire-style.

I, like Mariko, had never heard of Cioppino until I searched for this place when trying to find a restaurant that I could meet an old friend from high school at. \u00a0Sotto Mare definitely made the experience that much better. \u00a0Now, I'll say this - I didn't order much - just an order of Cioppino, my friend had the scallops, and we split a bottle of Chianti. \u00a0No regrets - the mussels, scallops, calamari, and crab made it awesome. \u00a0I honestly wanted to tilt the vessel back and just drink the sauce when we were done. \u00a0But alas, I was too full and no amount of bread was going to avoid gaining 5 pounds while eating all of the sauce. \u00a0Next time...  The scallops were good too - and plentiful isn't even a word to describe it. \u00a0The only thing I would say that kept it from getting five stars was the apparently disorganized manner in which the hostess sat you - I had two people, despite me standing in what was the line, jump ahead of me and put their names on the list ahead of me. \u00a0I wanted to strangle people and when I finally grew tired of it and acted like the locals (when in Rome, right?), then I was created with a stink eye before she finally relented. \u00a0Keep in mind, this was over the course of 15 minutes from arrival and standing in the door.  Advice: \u00a0be aggressive to get ahead and make sure you get your name on the list as soon as you get there. \u00a0The little lobster \"beepers\" will work around the block so go grab a drink after.",

Don't be fooled by its appearance -- Sotto Mare may look like a more casual diner upon first glance, but go past the counter and you'll find stairs that lead you to a spacious lower level. Still fun, but more formal. The menu is rock-solid, with the favorite being (of course) the cioppino. A finger-licking portion for two! The sand dabs are also a favorite of mine, but you really can't go wrong with any order. We've had oysters, mussels, linguine, specials (lobster ravioli, anyone?)... all delicious and quite affordable. Please note, however, that instead of getting dessert, you will be served with a written explanation of why Sotto Mare's doing you a favor by not serving sugar-laden dishes. I suppose that's fair, even if they just finished carbo-loading you for the month with pasta and bread. You'll likely be too full for dessert anyway.  Even better than the food: service is incredibly kind, even when they're slammed. It helps that they pour you some complimentary vino if you have to wait a while... cin cin!",

(All restaurants should catch on to this). It started getting a more crowded after we came in though, and the first part of the restaurant is a little narrow, so it was a bit annoying to wait inside, but it was really cold outside, as usual. Anyway, we were seated downstairs, which I didn't even know existed. It's a lot quieter down there and I felt like I was missing out on all the action from upstairs, but it was ok; we came to eat!   So my bf and I ordered the clam chowder with bacon. It was more on the soupy than creamy side, but was still so good! We also ordered the seafood risotto ($19). I LOVE risotto and this one was amazing! It came with plenty of mussels, clams, and shrimp; they don't skimp you on the seafood! Last but not least, we ordered the cioppino. It's $38, but can feed 2 and it's so worth it! SO MUCH CRAB and the sauce was delicious. There's also mussels, clams, shrimp and scallops in there. I think it was the best cioppino I've ever had so far. Hungry just thinking about it.   Oh one last thing: they don't serve desserts here. Instead they give you a list of places you can visit nearby, but there are plenty of places to find sweets around North Beach!",

I will admit, the clam chowder was great... the cioppino was just ok (much overrated - we know good cioppino btw)... and the west coast oysters were pretty good.   About an hour after we left here, my mother got very ill! She threw many times within the next few hours (also couple of days) and had bad diarrhea - about an hour after we left. Shorty after her, I got really ill with the same exact issues. We were both very sick with obvious food poisoning from here for 2+ days which was more sick than we've been in years! Not to frown upon on this place, but I really suggest going to the many other good Italian places in the city. We're not sure what we got sick from there, but know it was one of the dishes we shared. We will never eat there again! Be careful.",

Split the cioppino between a group of you (even as many as 4) with another dish or a few appetizers on the side and you'll go home happy.  Make reservations in advance and you'll be even happier. If you have a big group, never fear - there's overflow seating in the basement where the service is still friendly and the seafood bibs will keep it feeling kitschy and festive.  We've had great success with the oyster shooters, smoked salmon, soups, and salads... but really the cioppino is what's memorable.  If you don't make a reservation and do get stuck waiting, grab your lobster-shaped buzzing pager and head next door to Golden Boy Pizza for the best pre-appetizer on earth.

    "review_text": "After searching on Yelp for the BEST crab in Frisco, I decided to steer clear of Fisherman's Wharf and check out Sotto Mare on the outskirts of Chinatown. Got there at about 11:30am on a Tuesday afternoon, and was greeted by an older lady with an Italian accent. She was very nice, and asked me if I wanted to sit at the bar. Why not? It was just me. I had deliberated quite a while on what I wanted to try before I got there, but for sure I wanted crab. I decided on a soup n' salad combo of clam chowder and the Crab Louis.   While I waited, I was given a bread basket and I sipped on a Diet Coke. The walls festooned with photos, mounted fish and ephemera will keep you interested while you wait. The waitress behind the bar poured herself a beer while 60's tunes played on the piped in music.  Down at the end of the restaurant, a couple of Asian tourists were tucking into a mighty spread of pasta and seafood. I am sure they each dropped a couple hundred bucks on lunch cause they ordered multiple entrees each. The older lady was down helping one guy put on a lobster bib.  A couple a few stools away was drinking white wine and sharing a fish entree that looked pretty good. I was getting hungry.  The waitress stuck a ladle into a big vat of chowder and filled up a small crockery bowl with soup. She place it in on a plate and then in front of me. I noticed some of the chowder had splashed down the outside of the crockery. Ah, it is just presentation. No big deal. Besides, the 'cup' of chowder was actually a good sized bowl of chowder. Seven dollars of chowder sat in front of me.  I went in for my first taste...and it was good. Rich, creamy, with plenty of clams, potatoes, onions and just the right amount of bacon. Yeah, it was good chowder. Not out-of-this-world like some people had described it, but definitely good. \u00a0To be perfectly honest, I've had chowder just as good at Skipper's fast food restaurants in Seattle. Made some of my own that was just as good. Hate to be a buzz kill, but it's true.  But there was still the Crab Louis to contend with, and that was the main event.  For this, the waitress came around from the other side of the bar and placed it in front of me. Nice touch.  The Crab Louis was a simple affair of just three ingredients: shredded lettuce, salad dressing, and crab. I don't count the lemon wedge. A traditional Crab Louis has tomato wedges and hard cooked eggs as a garnish. Here, just lettuce and crab.  I ordered the dressing on the side (probably comes on the side anyway). It's a good thing, cause my feeling is that the taste of the thousand-island like Louis dressing would pretty much defeat the purpose of the crab.   There was probably a scant pound of fresh, and I do mean fresh crab meat piled onto the lettuce. The crab was in large , easily recognizable pieces of succulent leg meat.  Each bite of crab meat tasted as fresh as fresh could be, no fishy-ness at all. With a squeeze of lemon and some salt and pepper, it was very good cold crab. The lettuce was merely a 'crab delivery system'.   A large salad with lots of fresh crab, and a bowl of good clam chowder came to $31.00.   I would go back again and probably try some of the pasta or other dishes. I didn't order the fabled Cioppino because it was $41 and was made for two people.   So ultimately I was glad I tried Sotto Mare and I give it 3 stars for the good but not spectacular chowder and 4 stars for the salad, which was fresh but a somewhat pedestrian take on a Crab Louis.",

    "review_text": "Hm, 4.5 stars...really? \"Best Damn Cioppino\"? I think not, this place is pretty overrated.  It would have been 3.5 stars, if the hostess didn't have this stuck up attitude. I mean she's nice, but she really thinks the restaurant is \"the shit\". Well, it's not. I made reservations at 7PM for 5 people, and 3 of us arrived at 6:50PM because the other 2 were looking for parking. We checked in with her and she said that she will only seat us when our whole party is here. Initially, I thought, okay that makes sense because the restaurant looks pretty full and we would be taking up a table just waiting for people. However, when we finally got seated, half of the downstairs was EMPTY! Instead of letting us sit at one of those EMPTY tables, she made us wait by the door on this cold SF night. HOW RUDE. A restaurant can't be \"the shit\" if you have stuck up service, even if your food is good, and in this case, it didn't met expectations.   Since I tried Anchor Oyster Bar a week ago, I'm able to compare the two, apples to apples.   1. Cioppino - ANCHOR WINS! Sorry Sotto - your Cioppino isn't that great. Though the portion size was very generous, and definitely enough to feed 2 people as it was piled with seafood (clam, mussels, squid, crab, bay shrimp, prawns, etc), the flavor wasn't there. I felt that it was very watered down and tasted almost like pasta sauce. The pasta was a nice addition to the dish, but too bad the soup/sauce/whatever that was sucked. On the other hand, at Anchor, the soup was actually soup consistency, like a bisque. It was fresh and packed with flavor from the seafood. The crab was also out of its shell which makes it easier to eat!   2. Clam chowder - SOTTO WINS! While both clam chowders were good, Sotto wins because it had clams (and bacon) in each bite, while Anchor had more potatoes and less clams. It's a pretty close one, but Sotto wins.   3. Steamed Shellfish - ANCHOR WINS! The both at Sotto is just pure butter. Yes, that makes it super delicious, but it gets overwhelming after awhile. At Anchor, the broth (unique for each steamed dish) is fresh and flavorful - without the butter. Definitely more complex flavors at Anchor, to the point where it's basically a soup that you can drink - not salty at all!   Aside from those, we also ordered (not offered at Anchor):  4. Seafood Risotto This was probably my favorite dish. The risotto had a good chewy consistency. I've had some pretty bad ones where its overcooked or undercooked. But I think it was cooked perfectly here. It was also loaded with seafood, and a very generous portion as well.   5. Filed Monkfish  Okay, this was plain nasty. Maybe it's just the way monkfish taste (my first time trying), but it was bland and tasteless. The garlic butter lemon did not make up for the flavor at all. And the texture of a poor-man's lobster? It certainty did not feel like it. No more monkfish for me!  Verdict: ANCHOR OYSTER BAR WINS! Avoid the parking at North Beach and go to Anchor Oyster Bar instead of Sotto Mare. You can thank me later! :)",

It's the standard: \"I am taking no more walk-ins, if you don't have a reservation, sorry\". No hello, no warm tone. Just blunt and loud. To which I promptly replied: \"I have a reservation\". The host came back a minute or so later, took a look at the list to confirm my res, and told me they were a bit behind but she would buy us all a glass of wine. Cool, I guess. Kinda defeats the purpose of a reservation but I wasn't gonna complain. Free booze!  We waited outside since it's way too cramped, and were seated within 15 minutes or so. To my surprise, since I had no idea it existed, we were led to a downstairs seating area which smelled a little funky but was 100x quieter than the main upstairs, so we were happy. Our server was a crack up, but a little unprofessional. For me, that's koo.. I'm a laid back girl, but for other fine diners it could be a problem.  On to the important stuff. FOOD:  Steamed mussels - yup  Steamed clams - yup  Baccala - served cold and minced in a tomatoey sauce. This was delish on the endless bread they give you. We weren't expecting cold at first, but it was really flavorful!  Cioppino. Yeah, it's that damn good. Worth $38? Well, there's not much that's worth $38 food-wise, but this ish is GOOD.  Boston Clam Chowder - So good. I mean, it's not in a bread bowl or anything, but everyone was super pleased with the amount of fresh clam flavor/pieces, small potato, and distinct bacon throughout.  Grilled Sole - Cooked perfectly, &amp; had the crunchy bits. Comes with a spicy dip and lemon to garnish.  Fettuccini with Seafood - a request made by our table, as it usually comes with Linguini, but was easily accommodated. Oh. My. Gawd. SO good! The seafood, again, FRESH. The noodles, perfectly al-dente, the sauce... Wow. I'm a sucker for cream sauces, but I wasn't the only one dipping bread in the sauce this evening.  Overall, 5 stars for food and 4 stars for service. So I'd have to say 4.5 stars in total. I would come back for sure, because it's delicious. But hopefully, the staff realizes it's North Beach and it's always gonna be busy, so get a grip.",

But I didn't mind the wait because the owner sees us in the line and promptly opens a bottle of white wine and offers a glass to all of us waiting. Top-notch customer service, if you ask me.   We were seated at the counter and had a full view of the kitchen. Gotta commend the great exhaust system they have there, left the place without smelling like food.   Disclaimer, if you are allergic to seafood, this is not the place for you. There is nothing here that does not have seafood.  If you love seafoods, however, then you are in for a treat. And it's not just fish, they have shrimp, lobster, clams, scallops, and, well, fish. They've got great service, with everybody in smiles.   It's definitely a great Italian restaurant for quality time with family and friends. It's not the best place for large groups or parties with kids since it's a small place. They do have a private room for larger parties that need to be reserved in advance.   Sotto Mare is a little bit away from busy Columbus Avenue but it's a great place for seafood and pasta. Everything about it is just cozy and down-to-earth, just what you expect from a homey Italian restaurant.",

    "review_text": "My friend and I were searching for a random dinner place when we passed by Sotto Mare. I pointed it out to her because I had mentioned it to her before and had been wanting to try it. We saw a small group of people outside, but on a whim, decided to see how long the wait would be for two people. When we got to the entrance, we found that there actually was a lot of seating!! We had no wait time and sat down immediately at the middle of the bar seating -- \"best seats in the house!\". 15 minutes after we sat down, the whole bar seating was full. I can definitely see how the wait can be long for this place.   After a while of indecisiveness, my friend and I decided to get the cioppino to share, as well as a cup of clam chowder (it's actually bowl-sized). I'm not a huge seafood fan, but I wanted to give this place a try for their specialities.   The clam chowder was really good; definitely try it. Then, the cioppino came out -- it's this HUGE bowl (bucket?!) with crab, calamari, scallops, mussels, clams, shrimp, and penne. Even though I don't like mussels or clams, this thing was DELICIOUS. Best cioppino I've had so far. Everything was fresh, and the quantity was more than enough. AND the price is so reasonable!!   This place has a very cozy feel and the staff was always friendly and attentive. Great place to bring friends or seafood lovers!",

I took out the iPhone and searched for the restaurant on yelp, it had 4 1/2 stars with nearly 800 reviews. \u00a0Sounds like a winner. \u00a0So we walked in a were seated right away. \u00a0  I asked the waitress what the popular dishes were and she said by far the most popular is the Crab Cioppino and Sand Dabs. \u00a0So that's what I ordered.  Crab Cioppino: \u00a0a combination of calamari, scallops, mussels, clams, crab, and shrimp. \u00a0The secret is, the taste is in the stew. \u00a0Roll up your sleeves. \u00a0Grab some of the not to be overlooked fresh quality French bread they serve. \u00a0Sop up the delicious stew with the bread in one hand. \u00a0Seafood with the other hand. \u00a0Don't try to look cute, just eat.  Sand Dabs: \u00a0apparently this is a delicacy. \u00a0This flat fish came pan fried with a light sear, along with some vegetables. \u00a0I won't lie, I got a little dip happy with the Cioppino stew and started dipping the Sand Dab in it. \u00a0So if you ask me what the Sand Dab tasted like......... Um.... like Cioppino.  I like the casual feel of Sotto Mare and the friendly service. \u00a0They give out bibs for people like me who like to splash my Cioppino stew everywhere.  If you are in the mood for this Native North Beach/San Francisco dish. \u00a0Sotto Mare should be on top of the list.  As Sebastian says:  \u00a0Under the sea (Sotto Mare)  Ya we in luck here Down in the muck here Under the sea",

We waited, the anticipation building because of the wonderful aromas that filled the air. We were basically ignored by the busy wait staff and the owner/host for ten minutes or so.

This was fine with us, as the temperature was significantly cooler down there.  Our busboy was sweet and our waitress was great. She told us that it was 9:15 and the kitchen closed at 9:30 so the owner decided to seat the rest of the people on the wait list downstairs so that everyone could be served. I think we were in what was considered their banquet room.  We ordered the lettuce wedge salad to share. Excellent dressing. DH ordered the cioppino and I went for the sand dabs. Our waitress told us the cioppino was enough for two, but she didn't tell us the same was true for the sand dabs! Holy moly! Sand dabs were good, after I added a little salt to them.

    "review_text": "+ Cioppino. DUH! + Super friendly, if not slightly rambunctious owner! + Attentive service  Came on a Tuesday night with a girlfriend to check out the much-raved-about cioppino. Took about half an hour to get seated (arrived at 7pm, seated ~7:30pm) at the bar as we did not have prior reservations.  Had the CIOPPINO FOR TWO ($38) and a carafe of the house pinot grigio (half liter, $14). The cioppino definitely lived up to its hype. Pre-cracked crab, easy-to-peel shrimp, brimming with mussels, clams, etc! The only complaint is that they seem to have run out of the big metal pot with a lid that the cioppino was served in for other tables. Ours came in a big porcelain bowl which did not have a lid. It would have been great to have a lid to keep our cioppino warm while working on it. On the bright side, our individual bowls came pre-heated. The penne at the bottom of the bowl was ingenious! Getting your carbs in without needing to rely on bread-dipping. We (two skinny Asian girls) scarfed down the entire bowl - it was that good. The house pinot grigio paired well with the cioppino - slightly sweet, fruity flavor. Much better deal to get the half liter than the glass ($14 vs $8).   The owner is a jolly, rambunctious gentleman who cracked jokes with customers who were waiting to be seated. I could tell he had had quite a bit of wine from his breath as he seated us. Quite a cheerful fellow if you ask me. As we were leaving, he was singing along to Italian opera. Love it!   No dessert served here!

While we waited for our order we watched the cooks working magic behind the bar and got progressively more hungry.   When our food arrived, the first thing i noticed is that the seafood to sauce/pasta ratio is ridiculous. As in, I've never been to a restaurant (except in B's kitchen) where they are so generous with the seafood. No complaints here!  The cioppino was amazinggg. We had leftovers and even when heated up the next day and tossed with some extra pasta, it was still delicious.   Craving cioppino? Sotto Mare's is the place.",

    "review_text": "This place is an institution, you get a sense of that when you walk in the door. I dined there with my sisters and friend last night for the first time and it was just short of magical. The inside is narrow, clean and had a bit of a tchotchke decor, but not overwhelmingly so. I loved the gray marble used on the table tops, it made the place look a bit upscale.   It was a special night so I brought a bottle of champagne and they provided glasses and let me open it without batting an eye. Off to peruse the menu, which is on legal size paper and laminated, a bit of a throw back but charming all the same. We chose to start with a half dozen oysters (3 west coast, 3 east coast), 2 cups of clamp chowder, the ciopinni for 2, seafood risotto and seafood pasta with red sauce.  The oysters were very fresh and surprisingly, we enjoyed the east coast ones more, they were smaller, but packed a real flavor punch. \u00a0Also a bit old-school, the entree portions were enormous and could definitely be shared amongst two people. I'd never had cioppino before, most are made with several types of fish, and I'm not a big fan of fish. This one was made up of dungeness crab, shrimp, scallops and calamari, and I love all of those. They were cooked perfectly in the sauce, moist, not overlooked and delectable in the tomato sauce. Loved the penne pasta in the pot, it needed some carbs to counteract the acidity of tomato sauce. I had 3 bites of the seafood risotto which was cooked with seafood stock and it was executed perfectly.  It's just over 24 hours since I enjoyed dinner there and I could eat again right now!  This review is 4.5 stars because the dinner ended oddly. I was finishing a full glass of wine when we paid check. My sisters decided to order another glass as I was finishing my glass. Half way through our glasses, the hostess/owner? comes up and says, \"you girls are done, bye-bye.\" Granted it was 7pm on a Saturday and we were lingering at the table, but I was finishing my glass of wine. So we threw it back and moved on. Granted they never asked us to pay for the last 2 glasses of wine, I just feel they could have handled it differently. It was an abrupt end to a truly great dinner.",

Had high expectations for Sotto Mare but found the seafood and pasta to be good but not enough to balance out their slow and inattentive service.  Since we had a large group, per recommendations of our waitress, we decided to order dishes and share family style. The waitress suggested getting 3-4 dishes since the pastas should be large enough to share between 2 people. We ordered 4 large pasta seafood dishes (~$18 each) and it turned out to be barely enough to fill our tummies and two people in our party weren't even hungry.   We were seated in the basement which was a bit musty. It was very difficult to get the attention of our waitress and when the bill came, she gave us a hard time about splitting the check between two credit cards.   If you come here, it's probably better to stick to the seafood but even then, I feel that it's a bit overpriced for both the quality and quantity that you get. \u00a0There are definitely better places in the city!",

I really liked Sotto Mare right off the bat, and I'm bummed that my negative service experience sort of ruined it for me. \u00a0Basically I was dying to try their much raved about Cioppino, but knew that the price on the menu was for two people (unfortunately my boyfriend isn't a seafood fan). \u00a0That being said, I asked the waitress if they could make it for 1, because I was dying to try it, and she said yes. \u00a0After I ordered it, she came back and asked me if it would be OK if it still came out in their special Cioppino tureens. \u00a0I said of course, that i wouldn't mind if it was only filled halfway (note that I said this), and she laughed and said great. \u00a0As far as I knew, there was NO miscommunication.  I knew something was off when I received my Cioppino and it was still the HUGE serving that everyone else was getting. \u00a0Once Gigi (the hilarious owner) made a comment about how I wasn't finishing the whole thing, I knew something was off. \u00a0Basically, when I recounted the conversation I had with the waitress to Gigi, he said that she was wrong and she (who was standing there) made me seem crazy by denying that she had made it seem like I could get the Cioppino for one.  I have no problem spending $33 for excellent food, but not when a) I'm not expecting it and b) I end up completely wasting GREAT quality seafood. \u00a0I would not have ordered the Cioppino if I had known that this would happen. \u00a0When I emphasized this to the waitress she was very rude to me, and made no effort to make the situation right.  Plus, I ordered a side of sauteed vegetables (aka, broccoli) and they came out to EIGHT DOLLARS. \u00a0That's the same price as the appetizer shrimp cocktail! A little ridiculous to me.

With a side of russian dressing, but it was tasty. - Clam Chowder: very good, I could taste the bacon in it, but it wasn't overwhelming.  - Linguine with Seafood: sooooo yummy. it had an assortment of shrimp, bay scallops, mussels, clams, and squid all in a light creamy white wine sauce. - Clam Steamers: in a white wine/garlic sauce. they clams were fresh with NO SAND! and the broth is perfect to dunk the bread in.

Umm, but sadly in my case: FATTER! :X  Yesterday, my friend took me and our other friend to Sotto Mare for a joint belated birthday dinner (Thanks, T!). It was very busy even on a rainy Tuesday night so reservations are an absolute must.   F O O D *CUP OF BOSTON CLAM CHOWDER: 4 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8dUaybEPHsZMgr1iKgqgMQ?select=ZgaNi_WSZJDUwuLngeYvqQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/8dUa\u2026</a> Super rich and creamy, the boston clam chowder was perfect for a rainy SF day. The chowder was full of sweet tender bits of clam, potatoes, leeks AND bacon. The bacon is what made the chowder, adding an extra layer of richness with a hint of smokiness.   *MUSSEL STEAMERS: 4 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8dUaybEPHsZMgr1iKgqgMQ?select=a3FMW_SBUAI0cu_8H7QRXw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/8dUa\u2026</a> The mussels were uber fresh, tender, and sweet. The broth was had deep complex richness with a prominent garlickyness.   *THE \"BEST DAMN CRAB CIOPPINO\" (Feeds 2) - 5 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8dUaybEPHsZMgr1iKgqgMQ?select=St7KBOyy99bTjhYxasskFg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/8dUa\u2026</a> The name says it ALL! Sotto Mare definitely makes the \"BEST DAMN CRAB CIOPPINO\"! I'm not even a seafood fan and I wanted to bathe in ALL the ocean goodness. Swimming in an amazingly rich tomato wine sauce (not too acidic/tangy) was some of the finest catches from the sea: succulently tender and juicy crab, tender sweet mussels, clams and scallops, pleasantly chewy squid and mildly buttery shrimp. Everything was perfectly cooked; even the penne pasta which managed to stay al-dente underneath the chock-full of seafood and sauce. A DEFINITE MUST ORDER!  *SPECIAL OF THE NIGHT: SEAFOOD RAVIOLI - 5 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8dUaybEPHsZMgr1iKgqgMQ?select=J4d0Yqar1Mnexuw7dByUkA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/8dUa\u2026</a> I could not stop eye-raping by friend's order which had huge, plump raviolis drowning in a ultra creamy tomato sauce so I had to ask for a taste. One bite into the tender, al-dente ravioli jam-packed with crab, scallops and shrimp caressed with the most decadent savory sauce with nuances of sweet and tangy...TOTAL FOODGASM!   TIP: Ask for several loaves of bread at a time (otherwise they will give you just one) because you will need it to slop up all the AMAZING sauces, broths, and soups. We killed about 6 loaves among the three of us. CARB ECSTACY!   S E R V I C E Warm and welcoming. Luisa, the manager came by our table several times to check on us and also to make sure we were mangia, mangia! And stuff our faces, we did.  My only gripe is we got our appetizers quickly after ordering but it took a while to get our entr\u00e9e. \u00a0  A M B I A N C E / D E C O R Sotto Mare is an authentic, mom and pop restaurant that draws masses of locals and tourists. Old Italian portraits and tchotchkes give it that funky rustic feel. This is a type of place you come to for the freshest and most delectable seafood and not the ambiance.   There's two levels of dining at Sotto Mare and the bottom level is for larger parties.   P A R K I N G Fairly easy street parking on weekdays before 5:30 PM-6 PM. There's a small parking lot across from Sotto Mare; $11 for weeknights and $20 for weekends (flat rate).   I can't wait to mangia, mangia at Sotto Mare again. Next time, I'll lay off the bread (maybe) so I can mangia even more. Don't worry, Luisa...we Asians were taught to finish every rice grain in our bowls for fear of the feather duster coming out so mangia mangia e diventa grasso, WE SHALL!",

I had leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day, but totally worth it. At $41, this hearty cioppino is packed with pre-cracked crab, shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams, squid and penne noodles. Just a tip - save the bread they serve you at the beginning until the cioppino comes out, so you can dip it in the stew...amazing.   The restaurant itself is small, long and narrow, and is always busy. They only take reservations for parties of 3 or more, but luckily, both of the times I've been with just one other person, we didn't have to wait.

It was tender and paired well with the bread as well. :) Last but not least, the steamed mussels were DIVINE. Each mussel was fresh and drenched in the broth.

To start our lunch, my friend ordered half dozen of Oyster, and I ask for the Prawns cocktail. A waitress bring to us some bread and butter, the bread was good, I ordered a Italian wine which was desperately past age with a taste that let your palate dry like if you just swallow a piece of mud. This wine was surely stored in a heat zone and that make the wine turn into a very bad vinegar.  My friend told me that the oyster are ok. My prawns cocktail was a disaster! The cocktail sauce made with ketchup and hot Mexican sauce!!! \u00a0The prawns was frozen!   In all my live I never had a Prawns cocktail so bad! I couldn't eat more after only one bite.  My friend taste the Prawns cocktail, and I can tell that he's face emotion was not enjoying the bite. We decide to not proceed with our lunch at this place, and better request the bill, and go to another place to have a descent food.  The waitress come, we ask for the bill, she ask us if something going wrong. I told her that the Prawns cocktail it is not good, the frozen Prawns and the cheap cocktail sauce make this appetizer a real disaster. She look at me and she told me \" We are the best place and the best food in town\" Really? LUCKY I'M! I can't imagine the others restaurant so... I told her. She was very mad that I don't like the food .  Well I'm very sorry Sotto Mare but your food it is not good, the wine was past age, and your service suck!  I can't believe such arrogance. I see that other people here love the food at this place, and I only can say that everyone got different taste., but for me, this place it is not good at all, the service should be improve, and I will not recommend this place to anyone.  In the other hand, the location it's nice, and that's why I give 2 stars rating, for the location, and because my friend told me that the Oyster wasn't that bad.",

    "review_text": "The food was great but dang Sotto Mare, shape up on your service. SERIOUSLY.  So my bf's aunt recommended we try this place while visiting sf. I was excited at first because we are big seafood fans. This excitement quickly turned to confusion furthering down to pure bafflement -_-  Our experience began with Gigi forgetting to give us a lobster transmitter. When we saw that others were holding one, we politely asked for a restaurant pager. Instead of apologizing for his mistake, he rudely scolded us loudly saying \"you didn't answer when I asked you earlier!\" whoa whoa. okay sir, you never asked us to begin with so don't start blaming us for your incompetence.  We got seated in front of the kitchen area where the chefs prepare the food. Our faces started to get really hot because of the oily steam traveling to our faces. I asked to move to the vacant seats next to us but our waitress refused. I seriously didn't get what her deal was. It's not like she had to move anything on the table because nothing was served yet.  We later requested for additional bread because we were hungry waiting \u00a0a full 45 minutes for food(ridiculous I know). As we were asking, she abruptly walked away. Are you kidding me. Another waitress saw this and got the bread for us instead. Embarrassing how our waitress couldn't even competently perform her duties that another waitress had to pick up her slack...  When we finally got our food, we noticed there were brussell sprouts in lieu of broccoli and carrots. When we asked our waitress, she responded, \"oh I think it's cause we ran out\" um..hello thanks for informing us ahead of time...we don't even like brussell sprouts..wonderful.  The final straw was when I asked for my glass of water to be refilled. I SPECIFICALLY asked for hot water and she took my glass away and came back with a pitcher of ice cold water! Lady, are you kidding me? Wake up. Am I supposed to drink out of the pitcher with no cup? My bf and I were just baffled at this point. Their standard of service is simply preposterous. I personally found it difficult to enjoy the food when I was busy fixating on their lack of basic customer service. Sorry, will not be coming back or recommending this place to anyone I know.",

I ordered the chef's special seafood linguine by the watiress's recommendation. WOW! it was $17 but WAY worth it. Clams, squid, shrimp galore! They didn't skimp at all on the seafood. The white pasta sauce was flavored with some of the ink from the squid and it was the most amazing seafood I've ever had. The shrimps were so fresh and not rubbery!   My hubby ordered a fish with a side of brussel sprouts. I thought I hated brussel sprouts but Sotto Mare's DEFINITELY changed my mind! So buttery and sweet...I loved this place!   I heart bread...so I was happy to get a roll and dip it into their olive oil and balsamic vinegar.   **no dessert served because the owner is health conscious but they pointed us to a great place within walking distance for some yummy tiramisu!",

I happened upon Sotto Mare while walking along Green Street. It is a lovely atmosphere with seating in front of the restaurant, and both table and counter seating inside. Great stone work and decor.  My grandmother used to make baccala, salt cod in tomato sauce, and I saw this on the appetizer menu. I selected this with one of the catch-of-the-day, the petrale sole. Positively scrumptious! The baccala was mild and flavorful. The sole with lemon caper sauce was light and delicious. Both were paired with a glass of sauvignon blanc.  In a neighborhood so blessed with a trove of good restaurants, Sotto Mare is where to head. Next time, it will be cioppino.",

She greeted us heartily but still all business and hurriedly led us down to the basement; she told us to be as boisterous as we pleased. We took her up on that but soon learned that the hard surfaces and low ceilings threw our laughter every which way and eventually drove the other small group seated shortly after us into the adjoining room (they laughed when we apologized and told us to continue enjoying ourselves - sorry!)  We skipped apps and went straight for the real thing. We had one pregnant friend who was limited to the few non-seafood options on the menu: basically pasta with a couple different kinds of sauces. Others went for the crab cioppino (absolutely the right choice) and about half us ordered the sand dabs. These highly acclaimed dabs didn't live up to my expectations: relatively dry and not especially flavorful. The other dish my hubs and I split, the linguini with seafood and red sauce, was far superior.",

However, I was left quite disappointed with both the food and the service. My obsession with risottos obviously ensued the seafood risotto order but it was a bit dry and not cheesy enough for a risotto. Yes, it had a lot of seafood pieces (shrimp, scallops, mussels, etc) but the flavor somehow ended up feeling a bit like stale seafood with rice. And the infamous sand dabs felt a tad soggy and under cooked, certainly not what I was expecting from a SEAFOOD restaurant.   We were seated at the bar as the restaurant is quite tiny and we didn't have a reservation. Perhaps it's because of this (although it's not a good excuse) that the service was extremely lagging and inattentive. We had to wait almost 30 minutes for the entrees to arrive and the waiter completely forgot our calamari appetizer.   I'd recommend trying other seafood restaurants in the city before giving Sotto Mare a try - perhaps Pesce, Scoma's, Swan Oyster Depot or Hyde Street Seafood.

The upstairs dining room was definitely more lively than downstairs, but coming in a pair is probably your best bet to getting seating upstairs at the lively bar area.   I agree with other reviewers that the chowder was a little on the salty side. I'm Vietnamese and pretty much put fish sauce on everything, so for me to think something is salty is quite rare. The oysters were very fresh and priced well. The \"salad\" was pretty much a sliced tomato and some shredded lettuce. Not sure I would call that a \"salad\" and more of a side of garnish. I really enjoyed the clams/mussels though. The broth was very flavorful and was perfect for bread dipping. The cioppino was a great serving size with an amazing seafood variety, but the broth itself was just okay to me - a little on the sweet side in my opinion.   The wait wasn't too bad. The restaurant is actually bigger than it looks as there is a basement of sorts with 6-10 more tables. Unfortunately, I must look under-aged or something because of the 9 people that were also waiting for a table, I was the ONLY patron not offered a wine glass. Even people that walked in after me were given some, while I continued to stand there empty-handed. I could care less about freebies and handouts, but to be the only person singled out is just annoying. This might have soured my mood already and put a downer on the whole experience. I'll probably come back to try out a pasta dish or scallops....maybe I just came on a bad night. I like to believe that this many Yelpers can't be wrong.",

Grilled Sand Dabs - Dry and no flavor Cioppino - Extremely sweet and salty (this dish is yelped as the best in SF) Seafood Risotto - Again extremely salty and very bland  So to say the least the food was not amazing. \u00a0As if this disappointment wasn't enough, that was about the time the wonderful waitress turned not very nice at all. \u00a0We had made a 6:30 dinner reservation and the time was 7:30, she immediately started to rush us. \u00a0I understand turning tables in a timely manor, but I also think a hour and a half should be expected for a table of four ordering 4 courses (oysters twice because they where pretty good). \u00a0With that said at 65 minutes she actually said \"We need to wrap this up, my manager gets upset if I don't move my tables\" as she brings us the check. \u00a0Which was also the same time that she said \"We only split checks twice and we don't take American Express\". \u00a0Since we pretty much use American Express for everything this information would have been nice printed on the menu or told to us at the beginning of the night. \u00a0  I guess all in all I was expecting a little something more for a establishment that has four and a half stars with over a 1000 reviews. \u00a0Not to mention the $450.00 check. By this point we pretty much chugged the rest of our bottle of Prosecco and called it a night.",

Anyone who complains about this lady in their reviews is daft and doesn't deserve to eat here.   We were drinking our wine watching the game and were seated during the 11th inning. Rob and I got a nice table against the wall which usually seats four, we lucked out! Their bread was fresh and went perfectly with our cups of clam chowda. This is by far the best clam chowder I've ever had. It was piping hot, not too thick, and perfectly seasoned.   Our half bottle of house white wine reminded me of the good times in Italy where house wine is cheap but damn good. The Giants won, could our dinner get any better? Our dishes arrived- sand dabs and fettucine in white sauce with bay scallops. They give you a lot of sand dabs. Each fish was immaculately deboned with a slight sear on the outer edges and tips. Our pasta was very simple and the only thing that came to mind was... Rome. Finally a place and a pasta that reminds me of Italy, FTW!",

The house salad I ordered was limp chopped iceberg with flavorless tomato slices and a boat of Thousand Island on the side that could've come out of a can. \u00a0If this was a true 1950s-era establishment that refused to change with the times, it could've been forgiven. \u00a0But the rest of the meal would've lived up to expectations, which it did not.  The linguine was overcooked. \u00a0One more minute in the boiler and it would've been mush. \u00a0The seafood atop the linguine was bland and tasteless, and the entire meal was sitting in a pool of butter sauce.  Likewise, the grilled rex sole came out glistening with oil. \u00a0The crust was nice, but nothing special, and a bit charred on one side. \u00a0The vegetables on the side were overbuttered too, but at least crisp to the tooth.  I didn't come in expecting fancy fusion cuisine, and in fact looked forward to hearty Italian seafood fare. \u00a0But there's a right way to do that and many wrong ways, and Sotto Mare found a few of them.  The subplot to this meal was that we asked both the waitress who seated us and the waitress who took our order if they had squid ink pasta. \u00a0(We had been told they did.) \u00a0Both waitresses said we should have the seafood linguine, which came out with plain wheat noodles. \u00a0When asked about the squid ink noodles, the waitress pointed to the linguine and said, \"Yeah, that has squid in it.\"  I am positive I asked in a clear voice about squid ink noodles. \u00a0I realize it's a somewhat exotic ingredient, but this is supposed to be an Italian seafood restaurant, and I would expect the waitstaff (a) to know of their existence and (b) to tell us they don't have them. \u00a0It would've been that simple to make us happy.  From that point on the waitstaff pretty much ignored us, and we had to go to the cash register to get our check. \u00a0We didn't raise a fuss when the mistake was discovered (I knew there was no point in sending the dish back) and we ate the meal as it came out. \u00a0Why they would blow us off after that is their business, but they certainly won't be getting ours in the future.  This meal -- house salad, seafood linguine, rex sole, plus a glass of beer -- cost $50. \u00a0Why anyone would feel good about laying out that kind of money for such subpar food and service is beyond me.",

I thought to myself, \"over 1k reviews averaging 4.5 stars is pretty good\". The menu advertised loud and clear that it had the best cioppino for two, but I was only one slightly hungry man so I chose the shrimp and scallops instead.  They were cooked extremely well, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't necessarily blown away. I think this was just a case of knowing what to order (e.g.: don't get the hamburger at a Mexican joint).

I saw a long line spiraling out as I sat on my table of one waiting for my food but knowing that I was a party of one that didn't pose an issue for me. I'd be willing to try it again, perhaps with a friend, and see all about this best cioppino in town next time I'm around.",

I came here with a large party and didn't expect them to have such a large area downstairs to accommodate but was happy that we didn't have to wait too long for a table.  The cioppino is bomb, it is every bit as good as the reviews say it is. Whether or not it may be worth the 45 min to 2 hour wait ... I am not sure. You should definitely try to come with a party so you can try other things. As with all classic Italian places, the dishes are large, it's not particularly expensive, and you want to try everything so you should come with others.  I would say do not get the oysters, they weren't particularly fresh or good ... but aside from that everything else was deeeeelicious. Recommended!",

House Salad - Pretty unexceptional: Shredded lettuce and tomato wedges with served with Thousand Island dressing.   Steamed mussels - Fresh, but slightly overcooked (dry), and the accompanying broth was a bit bland.   Ciopinno - Homey and fresh tomato sauce boiled down along with fish meat, making a hearty ciopinno sauce tossed in with a medley of shrimp, calamari, and about 1 crab.   Risotto - Not cheesy enough for me, but might satisfy people's craving for some Italian style rice with a medley of seafood, but no crab.   All and in all, Sotto Mare is a down-to-earth place with excellent service, and good food that's like a homecooked meal. Homey to me means healthier with less of that artery clogging fattiness that makes stuff YUM!   $110 was the total for all of the above and a diet coke (served with crushed ice that frustratingly melded together and made it impossible for me to drink the last gulp . . .).",

TONS of seafood in a tomato broth with some noodles on the bottom. The only Cioppino I have had was from Trader Joes, so this obviously blew that one out of the water! We also ordered the grilled rex sole (they were out of the sand dabs), and it was so light and tasty. I love fish and the way this was prepared was excellent. It wasnt greasy or fried, it was just right. We were STUFFED!! This place knows its seafood, obviously. Everything was fresh and prepared wonderfully. DEFINITELY check this spot out.",

It was a huge plate of them, and though I thought they were all right they didn't knock my socks off. If you want parmesan cheese, be sure to ask for it. They're not going to ask you if you'd like some!  They don't take reservations for less than three people, so the hostess put our party of two on a waiting list and said it would be 45 min to 1 hour, almost as though she was trying to discourage us. She pointed to the list of names ahead of us and to the list of people with reservations and said they all would be seated before us. It was almost as though we were being chastised for not having a reservation, so I confirmed, \"but you don't take reservations for two people, do you?\" and she agreed that they don't. So we happily took our lobster pager and went to the bar next door (Columbus Cafe - a great place BTW) to wait. It was 1 1/4 hours before we were seated.   It definitely was an experience to be there! We were seated at the counter and got to see everything! The hostess and servers had a certain attitude about them: the restaurant is quite well-rated, and the staff act like they know it. They had this \"this is how we are\" attitude; take it or leave it!   I'm glad we went, but I don't know that we'll go again.",

The Environment: Now, the food is just plain delicious. \u00a0However, what will make Sotto Mare forever memorable to me is their environment. \u00a0I was lucky to be sitting in the back of the restaurant in perfect view of their chefs working at the stoves. \u00a0I honestly spent half of my dining experience mouth gaping wide open watching them cook and plate. \u00a0There was so much energy, enthusiasm, and precision in everything they do. \u00a0Despite the dishes being highly complicated, these chefs have perfection stored in muscle memory. \u00a0Please, someone get me a chair and popcorn; this is a show worth watching!",

The cioppino came in nice rustic containers, and the portion was good for two people, if you also order a side or an appetizer. While the seafood was decent, I found the broth a bit under-spiced, and it wasn't even close to being the best cioppino I have had in the city.

It's very fresh and it's definitely a good deal as a serving for 2 (well, good for SF $41 in mid 2014) - since a lot of people have no idea how to steam crab, perhaps getting a full crab in the dish is impressive enough? But it's not ... first, there seems to be no fish in the cioppino and there's no lobster - though of course, adding lobster would probably jack the price up a lot but other restaurants offer it with lobster also. The other part of a cioppino is of course, the sauce - their sauce - perfectly acceptable but hardly earth shattering and definitely NOT worth making a special trip. There is pasta of course but that's pretty hard to screw up. Service is weak but understandable as the place is packed - mostly bar seating unless you bring a party of 4. Never got a refill on drink or bread (which was also just okay &amp; not very fresh). So, if your guest wants seafood and thinks Red Lobster is great, they will enjoy it here along with its fun atmosphere of a hole-in-the-wall and the kitchen right there ... but a real Southern Italian seafood aficionado will not be all that impressed. It's NOT worth a special trip to 'Little Italy/North Beach' for the cioppino. If you happen to be in the area and you get there between 4-6 on weekdays with no wait, it's a fine choice but don't expect the best meal of your life - it's just a solid option.",

I ordered a clam chowder bowl ($6.50) and a seafood cioppino ($38) to share with my girlfriend. Right after we ordered the waitress immediately bibbed us up. \u00a0It was really cute (maybe not for first dates since it gets messy) and we took some pictures after we dug into our food with our bare hands.  The clam chowder was good, not great. \u00a0Just simple and delicious. \u00a0The cioppino had mussels, clams, crabs, scallops and pasta (might be missing a few things but you get the idea). I really enjoyed the different seafoods in the dish. \u00a0The sauce was really flavorful and I soaked my bread in it just to give the rock hard bread some flavor. \u00a0All in all, this place fresh with good quality seafood and great service. \u00a0I would go back again when I crave a large pot of seafood :)",

    "review_text": "Believe the hype!  Now I haven't had cioppino and risotto in every other seafood restaurant in SF, but this was one of the best I've ever had. This is an amazing little restaurant/ seafood counter bar that looks like it's been a San Francisco institution for decades (but only since 2007). The wait on a Saturday night was about 45 minutes, but they let you walk around the block with a pager. The hostess (possibly the co-owner) was extremely friendly, even under the pressure of a packed house. We were seated at the charming marble counter in front of the dishwashing station. As others have said, it gets noisy with clanging plates and yelling crowds, but I think it fit the ambiance just right. Go here without the expectation of a formal dinner, but more like a regular neighborhood restaurant.  The baccala cod spread tasted so yummy over the sourdough bread. Seafood risotto was to die for - perfect consistency and flavor. Adding the cioppino sauce over it made it even more heavenly. Huge portion for $19. Cioppino was pretty amazing - plenty for 2 to share at $35. Filled with crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, and scallops, over penne. Sand dabs were good, just a little lacking in any flavor. Needed some more powerful seasoning or something - this was the only slight letdown of the dinner.  Waitress was friendly and treated us like regulars. She was quick to see when we needed something.  Definitely coming back to this hidden gem. Take a short step off the touristy Columbus Ave and go here!",

Then the manager, Louise, came to our rescue and made them get back in line and gave us special treatment. I was then willing to wait!  The food was definitely worth the wait! We had clam chowder and the best damn cioppino, which stood up to it's name! It was great and I recommend seafood lovers give this place a try! Louise was amazing and continued to check on us our entire stay. Great place for dinner!",

Honestly I was full and didn't really expect to eat much of anything else that night. \u00a0I suppose we were already in the city and this place seemed to have so many damn good reviews for having the best seafood cioppino in the city. \u00a0Stumbled around for a bit after finding parking nearby then decided to see how long the wait was. \u00a0The lady seemed to be a bit overwhelmed at the hostess podium.... which is why I didn't really want to eat there. \u00a0Initially I didn't want to really wait that long for a table but ended up taking a seat at the bar next door while waiting since we couldn't come up with another place to eat at.   Watched the giants game and had a beer while waiting for our buzzer to go off. Got seated in this tiny two table off in the thin isle in the middle section of the restaurant. Tons of travelers passing through and more and more people seemed to want to eat here as the night went on. \u00a0Our table seemed tiny for two people and once the massive seafood came even smaller. \u00a0I still don't understand how we both ate so much that night. \u00a0After having plenty of small bites at the yelp event; this was just overkill. \u00a0We both regretted it after we were done eating. \u00a0Sickness and and an ill feeling overcame both of us on the way back. \u00a0  Honestly the food was decent, we just stuffed ourselves. \u00a0When I say decent I mean just OK. \u00a0Although I do believe the seafood to be overly salty. \u00a0Not even sure if they add additional salt to the dish but it was too much I think. \u00a0I'm not really big on seafood and don't like places like boiling crab... but its just something you have to try once. They need something else in it to balance the saltiness. \u00a0Not just the bread on the side LOL. \u00a0Anyhow it is not a 5 star place for me. \u00a0If we didn't eat anything beforehand then this meal would have been THAT much better. I'll give them 3.5 stars for the food. \u00a0I'm going to round down the review to 3 stars though. \u00a0I really believe there are better tapas or small dish places in the city that are more fun to eat at... not to sure if they are around this area though. \u00a0Luckily I felt fine the next day. \u00a0It was proof that too much good food and alcohol is a bad thing!",

(<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sotto-mare-san-francisco?select=l-KF3_As_CB3pX0RXxkMGA#l-KF3_As_CB3pX0RXxkMGA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sott\u2026</a>)  Mussel/Clam Steamers - a large bowl of mussels and clams in a tasty butter, garlic wine broth. \u00a0The mussels and clams were perfectly cooked. \u00a0 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sotto-mare-san-francisco?select=l-KF3_As_CB3pX0RXxkMGA#12DtTFGbGiq7B7SllkOVbQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sott\u2026</a>)  Seafood Risotto - Perfectly cooked risotto with generous amounts of prawns, shrimp, calamari, bay scallops, mussels and clams that were perfectly cooked. \u00a0(<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sotto-mare-san-francisco?select=l-KF3_As_CB3pX0RXxkMGA#kqIrv_x9BkXLoZDS3WtzGA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sott\u2026</a>)  The \"Best Damn Crab\" Cioppino - Finally, the dish that I came here for was brought to our table. \u00a0Each bowl is so large that it is enough for two! \u00a0Besides the Dungeness crab, each bowl of cioppino consisted of clams, mussels, shrimp and bay scallops. \u00a0At the bottom of the bowl is penne pasta too! \u00a0A very nice touch to this dish. \u00a0The tomato broth was so flavorful that you can't help but sop it up with the endless baskets of sourdough bread. \u00a0(<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sotto-mare-san-francisco?select=l-KF3_As_CB3pX0RXxkMGA#QQLopsrXHddz8faI9dqWPQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sott\u2026</a>)  Being in North Beach, you have countless restaurants that have their version of cioppino. \u00a0But now that I've tried it, I can truly say their claim of \"Best Damn Crab\" cioppino is much deserved. \u00a0In fact, Sotto Mare does a great job in its seafood dishes, so fresh and tasty. \u00a0Will be back and highly recommend.",

My husband and I went to San Francisco for our delayed honeymoon - it was our first time travelling together and Sotto Mare was our first dinner spot. We didn't do much research at all, just decided to check it out due to the high Yelp ratings. A little sketched out I have to say - we weren't sure what we were in for.  We got there at 7, was told to return at 8, so we explored Little Italy for a bit (another experience worthy of another thumbs up review) and went back at 7:45. We were greeted with a bit of wine for the wait. A super fun gesture. Waited around 20 mins more.  Finally we got seated and ordered the Clam Chowder and the Cioppino. Uh, YUM. We sat on the \"bar\" and got real close to the people sitting next to us because the place was so tight and cramped (in a good way). Super loud atmosphere.. an incredible place to meet strangers. We chatted (more like shouted) away with an older gentleman who sat next to us who told us which spots were worth checking out. Long story short, he left.. and it was only after our meal that we found out he covered our bill. WHAT.   Alright, so maybe that was what made the experience great. Hah. But no, really, digging into the Cioppino was crazy fun. There was so much flavour and so many kinds of clams and crabs and mussels in there. Instantly fell in love as a seafood lover. We walked back to our hotel giddy about how awesome it was. I recommend it. Go.",

As we all know San Francisco is know for it's sourdough toast and clam chowder soup with a lot of beautiful attractions. Whenever I am in San Fran this one of my many places to eat at. It has the NY vibe with the open kitchen view.   I highly recommend for starters the clam chowder soup or Crab Louis salad. The oyster are great as well. For the main dish you must try the signature the crap cioppino. They have couple vegetarian dishes. For all the pasta seafood lovers you are in for a real treat.   They don't offer desert. If you are craving sweets you have plenty of places around restaurant. Hands down one of the best seafood restaurants in town.",

Met him at around 12:30p on a Saturday. We walked in and were seated right away at the counter. Ordered the following:  Mimosa ($8) - Standard mimosa. I asked for light OJ, so they made it a little lighter than Rodney's.  Clams ($1 ea) &amp; Oysters ($1.50 ea West coast) - We originally ordered 2 clams, 2 west coast &amp; 2 east coast. Unfortunately they ran out of the East coast ($2.50 ea) so we didn't try them. The shellfish was fresh with a great briny sweet flavor.  Our best chowder ($5 cup) - Yum! Creamy and chock full of clams. The bacon added a nice smokiness to it.  The best damn crab cioppino ($41) - The reason we came! Rodney and I shared this. A good amount of seafood! Crab, clams, mussels, squid, shrimp, etc. Definitely enough for two. My main concern with cioppino is that sometimes the seafood can be overcooked and rubbery. This was not. The seafood still retained it's tenderness and juiciness! Yum!  Our server was nice and attentive. I'm so glad I finally got to try Sotto mare!",

I've tried 4-5 cioppinos in SF, this is by far the best 5* service. Feels like you're eating at your Italian aunt's home  My tips: * Eat at the bar if you can (always) * If you have a special wine / champagne for a celebration, bring it! They'll keep it chilled while you wait and won't nickel / dime you on corkage * Notice that their west coast oysters are a bargain compared to other SF restaurants * Have fun with the staff.

How was the waitress rude? \u00a0I felt as though she talked down to me, didn't fulfill my simple requests with a positive attitude (although they were fulfilled after being initially denied), and seemed generally unhappy to have to serve in that job - a chip on her shoulder, it seemed.  Poor customer service does not translate to repeat business, in my book. \u00a0So although the food was prepared well, yes, I will not be returning due to their poor customer service.  It appears that at least one other reviewer on Yelp also found their customer service lacking. \u00a0Yet I'm a polite person - I thought I wouldn't have the same experience. \u00a0Because I'm not alone in this perception, I can conclude that it's not me - it's them. \u00a0And despite good food, I'm not going to waste my money at an establishment when there is equally good if not better competition out there!

The Cioppino is out of the world! it comes in a huge pot, good for 2-3. The dish consist of a huge variety of seafood cooked in a delicious mild tomato based sauce. The seafood is very very fresh, including the crab legs. I highlighted the crab legs because most places that serve Cioppinos often use sub-par crab legs to cut cost.  The Sea Scallop Saute dish is extremely delicious too. The scallops are drizzled with a savory buttery sauce which is \u00a0addictive! If I am not in a restaurant, I would probably lick the plate clean.  I have also tried the Grilled Sand Dabs and Clam Steamers in broth. Delicious too.  For first timers, I would recommend the Cioppino and the Sea Scallop Saute dish.  Party of 2 or more are seated on a first come first serve basis. Come before 6pm! If not the wait will be more than an hour. Parking around this area is horrendous too so do bake that into your planning.  Reservations are taken for parties of 3 or more. There is actually a bigger seating area underground that are used to seat larger parties.",

The vibe is old-time North Beach with a good mixture of locals (mostly couples or small groups) and tourists (families), reminding me of Swan Oyster on Polk Street. \u00a0In reading last week's Chronicle, I learned that Tony Bennett dined here after he sang \" I Left My Heart in SF\" at the parade ceremony. Yes, I will be back to try some of their other pasta selections and, if a cioppino Jones pops up, \u00a0you'll find me here.",

Not because my review is going to be perfection, but because Sotto Mare is Perfection!(and I didn't want to write them a crummy review!)   Simply put- Sotto Mare is my favorite everything. Favorite Seafood, Favorite Risotto, And believe it or not my fellow Yelpers, possibly my favorite RESTAURANT in San Francisco period! Yes, my favorite restaurant in ALL of SF! I swear to you, I love coming here for the oysters, the fish, the cioppino, the crab, even the pasta- You name it, I've tried it here at Sotto Mare, and I've loved it all. I even made it a special point to take my whole family to Sotto Mare for my 'Birthday Dinner' this year...  The staff members are all incredibly friendly at Sotto Mare. They reel off an extensive list of fresh seafood they just got in a few hours ago when you order- it usually sounds like this,\"Ok we just got in a fresh fish from half way around the world- it super fresh, it took them only 4 hours to get here, so it's fresh, and the fish has been here for 15 minutes, it's very fresh!\" Also, they joke and rib you a few times if you ask for anything other than seafood! \"Do you have chicken or beef?\" \"We don't do chicken or beef!\" lol It can be fun visiting Sotto Mare with friends and checking out their wall of photos and memories throughout the years, and if you're lucky you can check out the fresh fish chest! Pretty cool stuff.   If you go, I do recommend you get the Risotto. This has always been my favorite dish at Sotto Mare, and like I said before, it is perfection. Dress attire is casual, reservations are accepted, price range is $20-$30 a person depending what you order. If you're driving to Sotto Mare for the first time, you may miss it- but the address is correct. It says 'Gigi's Italian Oysteria' on the outside, but this is the place. Have a blast when you go, enjoy the most delicious seafood you'll find in all of San Francisco, and don't be surprised when you fall in love with Sotto Mare!",

It's a very small place, and get very packed. The wait was about 45 minutes around 8pm on Saturday. There was an open table outside which we took, too bad it was a bit chilly.  Since it was chilly, we all decided to order clam chowder. Thank god we did! The clam chowder was amazing! It wasn't too thick, too creamy, or too salty. And it had various chunks of seafood such as scallops and salmon!   We also ordered raw oysters (west coast) and baccala for appetizers. We ordered 12 raw oysters... which was a mistake... it should have been 24 as the oysters were soooo good! The baccala was also very good. It was the first time I had it, so it was interesting. For those of you who don't know what that is, it's basically dried salty fish with tomato sauce.  For entrees we had the risotto, smoked salmon fettuccine, sauteed scallops and sand dabs! The risotto portion was delicious and had a very generous portion and It came with various seafood such as clams and muscles.The Fettuccine pasta was probably one of the best fettuccine I ever had. It was very filling though as it is creamy. And it might be a bit too \"fishy\" for some people as the smoked salmon can be very over powering. The sauteed scallops were my favorite. The sauce was delicious, too bad scallops usually come in small portions. Lastly, the sand dabs were pretty good too! I was expecting a small fish, but instead it came with 10 small pieces!   Overall, the food is very good, service was great, and great atmosphere. The only downside was that we ate outdoors and they had no heaters. Other than that I will definitely be coming here again!",

This was one of the first places I ate at in San Francisco and set the bar pretty high for any other Italian restaurants that I was to visit after this. It was a gorgeous day, it was the day I fell in love with San Francisco!   We had reservations so we were seated immediately. Remember it being a sunny winter afternoon and we started with the most delicious clam chowder! It was rich and creamy and so flavorful. The main course was amazing too and everything tasted so fresh and delightfully tasty!  Excellent service, which made the dining experience all the more memorable.  Haven't been back in a while but looking forward to going back really soon.",

Like many SF eateries, this place is narrow and deep. \u00a0The owner is a hoot and super friendly. \u00a0It is easy to see why people keep coming back.   The seafood is fresh and delicious. \u00a0I had the scallop and prawn dish, at the recommendation of our server and I snarfed it down, in no time flat. \u00a0We ordered a bottle of Montepulciano and the place has a nice selection of beer and wine. \u00a0The service was leisurely, but this is the kind of place that really encourages you to stick around a while and enjoy your food slowly. \u00a0Unlike so many other places close by, you never feel rushed at Sotto Mare. \u00a0  Don't plan on dessert or coffee when you come here, although the owner does make a few recommendations for places to hit, after dinner, for coffee, apertifs and desserts. \u00a0  This is not a five star joint and it is nicely casual, but don't let that fool you with the food. It is excellent and I would definitely come back if I was in the area. \u00a0It was a quick walk from my hotel and if you are near the wharf, this is a great place to try out, that is off the tourist path.",

I'm a true native of the city and frequent the Columbus Cafe and Gino Carlos and have never stepped foot in this restaurant but I will definitely be coming back.   You get two starts alone for the ambiance alone. I loved all the pictures and trinkets around the place on and on the walls. So much history and tradition. We took a co-worker here for lunch because he had admitted to never having Cioppino. After doing a quick yelp search to see that on the menu they claimed to have The \"Best Damn Crab Cioppino\" we were on our way.   We arrived about 12:30 on a Tuesday and the place was empty. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because a big group came in and even though the place was empty that piled them on the tables right next to us which made our table very crowded which seemed unnecessary in an empty place.  For starters our table ordered oysters, clam chowder and I had the house salad. I heard that the oysters and clam chowder were delicious but $6.50 for lettuce and tomato is not a good deal for the salad. Pass on that one.  For entree 4 of us split 2 orders of The 'Best Damn Crab Cioppino' which could have easily fed 1-2 more people and it was fantastic!!! It definitely lived up to its name. Our waiter (which I'm assuming is the owner) let us know that all of the fish was delivered fresh that morning and you could tell. It was so amazing I thought I was going to have a Harry met Sally moment. Also the roll of paper towels located on every table helped to keep you clean during your feast.  Our 5th person ordered the sand dabs which were also just fantastic. Words cannot describe the flavor and freshness of the fish. The were prepared simply to perfection.  I loved that this was strictly seafood also. No chicken and no meat. All of the fish was prepared the same simple way in which fish should be enjoyed. No bells or whistles. Just amazing quality.  Thank you Sotto Mare I will definitely be coming back.",

We were only in town for 2 days, so it was a MUST that we visited only the BEST resturants this city had to offer. We were impressed with all of our breakfast, lunch and dinner choices while in town...but Sotto Mare...OMG BLEW US BOTH AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!  We arrived on Saturday night at 8:00 and expected nothing short of what we got (which was a 2 hour wait). We sat at a nice intimate bar acrossed the street and had a glass of wine. We noticed while there that the majority of people there were waiting for their tables acrossed the street at Sotto Mare. It's a nice little set-up between the 2 businesses . I enjoyed the wine selection.  Now back to HEAVEN...  Once we were finally seated, we looked over the menu. I had my mind set on the Cioppino. After I realized it was for 2 people (my husband didn't want it), I decided to go with the seafood linguine...with crab meat added.  I HAVE NEVER TASTED ANYTHING SO GOOD IN MY LIFE!!!!!! This dish was HEAVEN in my mouth! FRESH seafood, AMAZING tasting alfredo sauce, PERFECTLY cooked noodles. OMG...I dream of this pasta.  My husband had the smoked salmon...which he raved about on and on. I took a little bite of it, and OMG...MORE HEAVEN!!!   I can't believe how AMAZING the food here is!!!!  It's a small, casual, crowded, loud dining experience, but the service was great. I was a little overdressed for the occasion, but none the less...I would return here over and over again. I will NEVER visit this city again without going to Sotto Mare. Hey, I might take a trip back just to go here! (And I'm coming from Philadelphia).  Here we are...a whole month later and I think about this pasta all the time. My husband thinks I'm crazy. It's more of an obsession.  6 STARS SOTTO MARE!!!!!!!",

If you're dining here with 2+ , then you MUST get their Seafood Cioppino!   Me and my bestest scrolled in at around 9:30PM (just about closing time) one night after spending 3 hours at Tru Spa. The place was lively and packed! Louise cheerfully greeted us and said they were closing. Just as we were about to disappointingly leave, she said \"let me see what I can do..\" She goes and asks the kitchen and comes back to say.. \"Come on ladies.. we can take you!\"-- then quickily moved people down to make room for two seats at the bar for us! And I definitely recommend sitting at the bar - you're staring right into the open kitchen where all the chefs talk to you! And if you're female.. friendly flirt with you.  Louise made us feel like she invited us into her home to eat. She was so hospitable and made sure we were taken care of. She even helped us put our crab bibs on. =) \u00a0 This place is sooo fun! At one point in the night-- they turned the music up and went around with wine glasses toasting and saying cheers to everyone! Then the chefs all did shots! Those Italians sure know how to have a good time while at the job! =)  I've been craving my second helping of their cioppino ever since. I'm SO hooked. A wonderful melody of fresh seafood, so much flavor in their broth, so satisfying, so fulfilling... so much love in one pot.   The best part.... \u00a0just \u00a0$27 and enough to serve two.  Its my new economic stimulus meal! =)",

My searches kept returning Sotto Mare, and partly because they craftily named theirs \"The Best Damn Crab Cioppino.\" But I am very pleased to report that the cioppino lived up to the hype, but more on that in a moment.  First, I loved the atmoshere. The modest restaurant is located on Green Street near Jasper in the heart of Little Italy. A narrow store front with only a couple of tables outside. Once inside, you recognized this family run gem is all about the food. The kitchen runs the length of the left side of the restaurant. A diner style bar separates the kitchen area and it is filled with customers enjoying their meals. A single row of four-top tables line the right side and all tables are occupied. It's loud, it's crowded, and the aroma of the cooking is fabulous.  I had called ahead and learned that you can make reservations for parties of 3 or more. Our dinner was scheduled for a Monday at 7:30. We arrived a few minutes early and were promptly seated in the basement dining area. I loved walking through the restaurant and seeing the wonderful dishes that others customers were enjoying.  So back to the Cioppino. My wife and I shared one and it was plenty for us. \u00a0Fresh crab, shrimp, clams, mussels, and squid in the wonderful tomato-based broth. The broth was just right, fresh and flavorful. The Cioppino contained some ziti pasta, but not enough to take any space away from the seafood and broth. \u00a0One observation that was a little odd was there were some nice sized shrimp and then there were some miniature ones. I mean really small, like millimeters (shrimpy shrimp). Also, by the time we finished, the broth was no longer steaming hot. We might eat too slow, but the aluminum bowl didn't help maintain the temperture. My tip is to eat and don't spend time talking and taking pictures.  Daughter #1, Kristine, ordered the Fettuccine with Bay Scallops. She liked it but wasn't \"wowed.\" Daughter #2, Jenny, had the Linguini with Seafood, and she thought it was very good. The seafood included clams, mussels, shrimp, and squid. Jenny tried the squid tentacles and decided she did not care for these. Both of these dishes were huge, and we were able to bring home their leftovers. In hindsight, if they could have agreed on a dish, they could have easily spit an entree and had plenty.  This was an excellent experience. I had very high expectations and was looking forward to this early in the planning stages of our trip to San Francisco. Sotto Mare and \"The Best Damn Crab Ciopinno\" did not disappoint.",

Unfortunately, my lobster-sitting time came to an end after we checked in with the two friendly hostesses in the narrow entrance two hours after receiving her.   The liveliness of North Beach gets only louder and hotter as you get funneled into the restaurant. While the outside tables offer breathing room and the opportunity to have your food ogled by hungry passerby, at the counter (where we sat) you'll be hit full force with the sights, sounds, and smells (oh, the AROMA!) of what I hope are authentic Italian seafood plates. Before you complain about how cramped and small the counter must be - let me note that two of us were able to fit a bread basket, our water pitcher, a huge plate of Sand Dabs, two dinner plates, and the legendary Cioppino between us (our cup of Chowder had already been whisked away). It's not a roomy situation, to be sure, but wide enough to fit your dining needs. Did you forget that you were in an Italian restaurant?   Before setting down a bread basket with thick slices of bread, our waitress warned us to go easy as there was a lot of food coming out. Of course the wait did nothing to help my common sense, so we made fast work of the bread while alternately admiring the multitasking abilities of the chefs and the crowded wall of old-timey photos and nautical trinkets. There was no more bread by the time the Clam Chowder came out about 10 min later, which turned out fine because it was seasoned just right, and the consistency was as chowdery as they come.   Our Crab Cioppino and Sand Dabs came out at the same time another few minutes later. This was my first time eating cioppino so I have no authority to claim it as the \"Best Damn\" cioppino, but I love hearty, balanced soups and this giant bowl was one of them. It's piled high with all sorts of goodies including scallops, shrimp, and (of course) crab legs, as well as heaps of penne pasta. Although I do wish there was less pasta and more of that delicious tomato soup, we underestimated the weightiness of the almighty cioppino and couldn't finish it.   Eat the Sand Dabs while they're fresh out of the kitchen! The first one I had was all crispy deliciousness. Later, after a few rounds of cioppino, the thin slices became soggier and the oil was more prominent than the flavor of the fish itself. I was tempted to eat the whole pile of cooked spinach since that was pretty much the only vegetation in the meal, but my stomach was protesting pretty loudly at that point. So in case you were wondering - not a vegetarian-appropriate place.  We had fantastic service the whole time we were here. Laura and the other hostess (sorry! forgot her name) are equally welcoming and funny, and I felt like part of a big, garlic-smelling family. Seriously. Go to the bathroom to escape the noise and heat and you'll realize that all the olive oil seems to have evaporated and settled into your clothes. Even though the all-black toilets look like dark holes, even they can't suck the smell away.",

Went to this place years back and realized I never reviewed it only after going again recently.  We've tried the seafood risotto, seafood pasta, and cioppino. All were fantastic. This really is for the seafood lover. If you are not much into seafood, the amount given on each dish might overwhelm you.   I've tried cioppino all over the place. At some highly regarded restaurants. This may be up there at the top of my list. In terms of price, quality, portions. It is enough for 2 people. And not 2 small people, but 2 average folks can really be satisfied.   The seafood risotto was packed with seafood. Don't worry about them skimping--they don't. Same goes for the pasta.   It's not a fancy restaurant. In fact it may be rather small for the popularity of the place. But everything works. It flows well with just the overall vibe of the North Beach/Telegraph Hill area. It's fun to sit at the bar watching the cooks do their thing since it's an open kitchen.   If I had a complaint, it would be the staff is not as nice or attentive--or I've just had bad luck on the times I've came. They aren't bad, but you just know it could be better--thats how it was with my experiences.  Overall, excellent food with good value. Definitely a place to continue to come back.",

Being the peak dinner time, too many people crashed in at the same time. So they had to close taking in more people after us. Luckily we got in the waiting for about 45mins!  While waiting in line, we were offered complimentary glass of wine, choice of red/white. Nice gesture. This definitely helped the wait seem not so long!  Ambiance - Very casual  Once seated, served with complimentary bread and butter.  We ordered: 1. Cracked crab half, $14 - Fresh meat! 2. Smoked salmon fettuchini, $17 \u00a0- In every bite could taste the smokey flavor of salmon in the sauce! Well balanced.  3. Seafood risotto, $21 - Seafood heaven! Rich in variety without skimping on seafood, and the risotto perfectly cooked. \u00a0  Tips: Make sure you have a reservation first.

Raw oysters were fresh! All the seafood I've had here was quite fresh. Good selection of beer for seafood.  My most memorable moment: Upon my first visit here, I came in relatively close to closing (I mean like an hour before). I stayed a while and while they were cleaning and shutting things down, they played the song \"Who the F**k is Alice\" by Smokie. There comes a part in the song where it goes \"Alice! Who the f**k is Alice?\" and all the waiters and waitresses and some of the customers (regulars I guess?) sang along to it. The whole place paused for that, and it was superbly awesome.

We got there around 1pm and it was beautiful and sunny, so we asked to sit outside. \u00a0Sitting outside, however, also means that you wait for a waitress for about 20 minutes who brings table bread and then says they'll be right back. \u00a0Another 15 minutes later, we ordered. \u00a0My sister had the seafood pasta, I asked for the linguine with pesto and added shrimp, Greg had the linguine with aglio olio-pepperoncino. \u00a0We didn't have to wait long until the food came out. \u00a0My sister's dish came beautifully put together with a variety of seafood on her linguine; clams, mussels, shrimp and scallops, the full works in a seafood broth. \u00a0Greg's dish, albeit plain on his request, looked great with the crispy garlic chips, olive oil and red chili flakes that were on his pasta. \u00a0Mine though, probably one of the worst dishes I've seen from a presentation stand point. \u00a0I'm used to my pesto being on the thicker side and definitely is not creamy. \u00a0My pesto looked like it had gotten into a messy fight with some Alfredo sauce, and there was enough sauce in the bowl for another two servings of pasta. \u00a0The shrimp that I had asked for came carelessly dumped onto top of the pasta. \u00a0NOTE: the shrimp that come additional are the tiny tiny bay shrimp, not your typical prawns. \u00a0Being that I was hungry, I ate it, but was left with a moderately unpleasant feeling. \u00a0I had some of Greg's pasta, and while it was savory with the richness of the olive oil and garlic, it lacked something else, maybe a little bit of salt. \u00a0I didn't try my sister's dish, but she ate all of it (except for the clam that was served to her that wasn't opened...shouldn't you check for that?). \u00a0She really liked her dish, but both her and Greg wished that the waitress would have offered more table bread to mop up the extra sauce. \u00a0  So, the conclusion on Sotto Mare would be that if you aren't there for seafood, find another place. \u00a0If you are though, and it's specific to either the cioppino (which I heard was great from a few other people around us) or the seafood pasta, then this would be a good spot to hit up. \u00a0Personally, my dish registered 2 stars, but since my sister had good things to say about her dish, I'll give here a 3 star place.",

This are just a few small reasons why I wouldn't go as far as giving this place five stars. \u00a0I have been here a few times now, and for the most part I have enjoyed myself. \u00a0It tends to be VERY crowded though (which also shows how good it is). \u00a0On busy nights, it is packed, and can feel squishy and rushed. \u00a0The only other reason I am giving this only 4 stars is because of something that happened a year ago. \u00a0I stayed away for a while and I have not seen it happen again, but about a year ago the owner (who can tend to be a little rude) walked through the whole restaurant with a lit cigarette in his hand. \u00a0GROSS. Like I said, I have not seen it happen again, but I was very appalled by the sight of it, and have never forgotten it. \u00a0  I definitely recommend trying this place out, I do not think you will be let down!",

There appeared to be 3 or 4 people who were waiting tables. \u00a0One guy had to be 80 years old. \u00a0Really nice, really Italian. \u00a0Then there was a lady, who when we entered in the restaurant asked if we had ever been here. \u00a0We said we hadn't. \u00a0She said, \"good, the food is amazing\" (it is). \u00a0I think there was a younger waiter and finally, my favorite, the owner of the restaurant. \u00a0  The owner of the restaurant deserves his own Yelp review. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0When we showed up to the restaurant we were seated relatively quick at the bar area in front of the kitchen. \u00a0By the way, the kitchen is open, so you can watch the cooks make your food in front of you. \u00a0My buddy and I sat down and ordered our food. \u00a0Within 5 minutes of getting situated the owner comes flying along and goes \"who sat you here\". \u00a0We responded and about 2 minutes later he had the entire row of people move about 2 feet down to fit someone else into the bar area. \u00a0Didn't bother me at all, but the gal next to me looked like she was going to have a conniption, haha. \u00a0  The owner would go up to the restaurants patrons and joke with them throughout the night. \u00a0On one occasion he came up to us and said something to the effect, \"Finish up and pay your bill!\" \u00a0Totally in jest. \u00a0  Do not come here if you're looking for a quiet meal. \u00a0Come here on a first date or with some friends for a glass of wine and some really good Italian food. \u00a0 Get ready for lots of yelling, but it's a very jovial environment. \u00a0Everyone was laughing at the antics of the wait staff.",

The first aspect that struck me about the restaurant, which continued throughout our dining experience, was the classiness. I don't mean five waiters per person or crystal glasses classy, I mean the type of classy, the type of hospitality, that can only really exist in old establishments-- in restaurants, and homes, that continue traditions from a time when there was no such thing as cutting corners. We were given glasses of house wine while we waited to be seated. The bowls for cioppino come out hot, so your food stays warm. Fresh, crusty bread replenished constantly. Wine served generously, beer served in a big sloppy pint glass that is, of course, not too sloppy.  Friendly, domestic service with feel-good, jazzy music and proud smiles all around. And what's not to be proud of? If I were a tomato, I'd want to die here. If I were a sea-dwelling animal, I'd also want to die here. If I didn't eat seafood, I'd change my mind-- a seafood massacre in tomato-based broth never brought so much delight.  My boyfriend and I wobbled home from the sweet intoxication of the best cioppino I've ever had, even having eaten cioppino my whole life. I'm at home now, and feel drunk-- like I should drink a bunch of water and mass text my friends.  ... and it wasn't even oily!!",

So why am I adding my two cents to what I consider to be the best cioppino I've ever encountered in my life and could quite possibly be the best dish I've ever had the pleasure of consuming? The cioppino literally had me in tears for the first time over food, not because the cioppino met my expectations, but because it exceeded it.  When you walk in here you are greeted by the owner, a very passionate, very straight forward, very Italian man named Gigi. He didn't just welcome my girlfriend and I into his restaurant, he welcomed us into his home. First he showed off today's fresh selection of fish and gave us menus and a \"dessert menu\" that explained why Gigi didn't offer dessert, but had listed many neighborhood favorites for desserts, he asked us what we felt like eating as if he was going to sit down and eat right next to us. His candor immidiately made me feel like I was at someones home and not a cold and inanimate restaurant.  As for the cioppino: fresh cracked dungeness crab, mussels, clams, squid, scallops, and penne noodles bathed in a rich broth of tomato, clam juice, and wine. It was absolute bliss. Now I've eaten at several places that have served cioppino before, ever since I was 15 when my Uncle used to serve this to me when he was head chef of The Original Clam house, now since retired for several years, but this cioppino that I had at Sotto Mare was something of a different breed. That first taste, gave me butterflies and I felt nostalgia that Anton Ego must have felt when he ate Ratatouille in that famous Pixar movie. I felt like \u00a0I've been searching half my life to find such a dish that titillates my taste buds and just made me savor every moment of it. That's exactly what that dish did, and therefore my search for San Francisco's best cioppino, is finally over.",

    "review_text": "Very good with a different restaurant experience.   The hostess is a bat-out-of-hell. She won't tolerate your crap so don't give her any. It's still a family run business...the owner's sisters-in-law (&amp; their sons &amp; grandsons) run the place &amp; do it with spunk &amp; pizazz!   All fresh seafood - no meat/poultry. Small place with a long bar &amp; various wall hangings &amp; posters, photos, etc.   My dining companions got the scallop fettuccine &amp; the risotto of the day. Both were very impressed with their dishes.   I ordered the \"Best Dam Cioppino\" ($33). It's enough for 2 people so I had leftovers that are very good the next day. However, I do have 1 complaint. Having eaten Cioppino - mixed seafood in a spiced tomato sauce - in Italy (Livorno, on the coast) the one at Sotto Mare is extremely good, but not true to its Italian roots. They serve it with penne pasta mixed in the seafood (?!) instead of the 2 slices of thick bread on the bottom (Italian way). I much prefer the bread on bottom as it soaks up some of the oil/sauce &amp; is amazing to eat at the end of the meal. So...I used the table bread in my Cioppino instead of eating the penne &amp; it was almost like being back in Italy. Worth the price, not even expensive if you split it with someone &amp; get a salad as an app.   The wine is ok...nothing to brag about unless you get 1 of the free glasses the hostess occassionally gives out to those waiting in line. This is my 2nd time &amp; I've enjoyed both. I'd definitely take out-of-towners here for fresh seafood, especially over any of the places on Pier 39!",

But this past week, they let me down big time. I called to make a reservation for 4 people ... all of us flying in from out of town ... 3 of whom have never been to SF. I thought this would be the perfect introduction to the city. I was told that my request was taken down and that she would have her manager call me.   Time went by and no call. On the day of the proposed reservation I called the restaurant a couple times to try and confirm ... no answer ... until just a couple hours before the reservation. I was told that I was wrong and they never handle reservations that way. Well, sorry, that is the way it was handled, but she was focused on telling me that I was somehow imagining this.   In the end, her attitude got snippier and snippier when I told her how disappointed I was that I couldn't dine there until much later, even though I did my part and tried to make the reservation.  So ... the moral of my story is: great food, nice atmosphere, generally friendly service, but I'll definitely not try this place again for reservations and the whole experience has left a sour taste in my mouth.",

The meat was big and juicy. Definitely get this when you dine here.  Clam chowder: this was above average. Good for those that like their clam chowder a bit more watery. Lots of clam bits, close to 50%? The bread that goes with it is quite standard though. Not to salty or creamy, so if you like it that way you'll love the clam chowder here.

Surprising, but they took reservation for party of four!! very nice considering that they have such a tiny restaurant and they usually have a long wait!!  We arrived promptly at 6:30 and our table was waiting for us :) The restaurant was full but there wasn't a line. We did notice that the wait was not as long as when we were there the first time.  We ordered the seafood linguini in pink sauce and cioppino. Our friends got the seafood linguini in pink sauce and the sauteed scallops entree!!  I kinda felt \u00a0that I had my head on the chopping block since I made my friend to drive all the way from the south bay to SF and experienced the parking nightmare in the North Beach area!! But WOW!!! The food certainly didn't disappoint!! We all loooveeeddd them!!!!  My friends were extremely impressed by the flavor of his scallop entrees. I had a bite..it was delicious!! The scallop was perfectly cooked in garlic, parsley and butter and I think there was a hint of wine :) It melted in my mouth and was not fishy and overcooked! My friend licked his plate clean, literally!!!   We were again impressed with the generous serving of the seafood!! Our seafood linguini was packed with mussels, clams, shrimp and calamari. What a deal for $17/plate!!! My friends even said.. \"this is usually at least $25 in other places!!\"   The cioppino was also packed with seafood, but we added tabasco to enhance the flavor.  The reason I ding one star was that my pink sauce was tastier the first time. They didn't put enough cream sauce this time that the sauce was a bit more on the \"tomato sauce\" and not \"pink enough.\" Also, the crab in my cioppino was overcooked, the meat shrunk.  All in all, Sotto Mare is certainly a place that I will still brag about \u00a0for some Italian seafood feast!!",

Was about to head over to Michael Angelo and Gigi calls me over to say hi I stood there in the cold shriving chatting. He invited me inside told this guy that he has reserved seating tonight at the bar counter. I kind of laugh and chunkle told him it's okay no worries she insisted for me to take a seat so I pluck down and kept quiet.  Ambiance: Small narrow place with limited seating but the wait is worth it if you have to wait. Wall to wall of decos in relation to the sea makes you feel like you're near the ocean just no water to be seen or a ship sailing by.Try going to the back when it's cold outside because no one eats cold cioppino and that's exactly what will happen if you're seated near the entrance. As with all area places around here it's been in business before I was even born. I really like the place but was afraid that while eating my food a fight or shuffle ensues then with my fork near the mouth one hard violent movement might have the fork down my throat. It's not Gigi's fault the place was built like this when Americans were consider thin active and healthy lifestyle fast forward we're as big our car seats.   Staff: Can't comment on others as Gigi was the only one attending me throughout my stay.  Cleanliness: Seafood place with that sea feel design makes you want to eat more. It's clean though as in early mornings as I sometimes spots a cleaner blasting mats and cleaning out debris.  Eats/Drinks: Cioppino with a twist made for my likings only and a order of oyster nestle on a bed of shave ice.   Products: Seafood dishes,oysters,shrimps,scallops,wine,beer,crabs,\u00adcrab legs,fishes,pasta dishes,shrimp cocktails etc.  Punch Line: \u00a0Cozy seafood place without the tech gadgets it's old school here also. Tourist will ask locals where to eat all the time I always say you have deep pockets then follow me.  Final Thoughts: It's another one of those places were you must stop by to try the famous SM cioppino before going back home. For people who may have try cioppino elsewhere it's probably package base broth and seafood here it's totally a different ballgame. Make sure to wear something that you don't mind getting splashes of food particles on it because the bibs being offer will make you look like an baby adult. Like always buon appetito!",

Everyone was eating clam chowder from Sotto Mare at the bar. We walked next door to grab some on that fateful day and got some chowder that hit the spot. The lady was really nice and hooked it up. A week later my girlfriend came out, we went back for dinner and the lady at the front recognized me and gave us some free wine while we waited a few minutes for our table.   6 months later we're back in town, go back for dinner and she recognizes me again. Treated us like family. Love this place. The salmon was really good but I regret not getting the cioppino. Next time I definitely will, heard its the bomb.",

The highlight of my meal was the scallops. I had the seared sea scallops - soooooo delicious. They come with a very good and garlicky sauce and just a few vegetables on the side. Also, it's a huge portion. About 10 scallops. I love scallops and order them whenever I see them on the menu - you usually only get a few scallops on the plate. Not here! My co-worker had the salmon and he said it was also very delicious. We were lucky to snag a table outside (there are only a couple out front) - and it was a beautiful day in San Francisco. All in all, I recommend this place to any seafood (especially scallop) lover. I'll be back.",

Although it's tiny, we only had to wait 10-15 minutes. We traded a credit card for the lobster buzzer so they can notify you when a table is ready.  We had a bowl or clam chowder which had big chunks of clams and was very tasty and creamy. Also ordered the bay scallop fettuccine which was also delicious and had plenty of scallops and a rich tasty garlic flavored sauce. Last but not least, we had the BEST DAMN CRAB CIOPPINO ! Soooooo good. We definitely didn't need the soup and pasta but don't regret any of it. So much different seafood in a delicious tomato base. I drank the broth like tomato soup. Yummm!   The ladies in the front are nice and friendly and treat you like family. After we ate we needed a box to go and I felt like she was my mom worrying about the bag getting dirty and smelling like seafood in the car. The wait staff is also friendly and they are on top of their stuff. Never needed to ask for anything besides a box because they always had everything brought or noticed it was low.   I'll definitely be back!",

By comforting, I mean not having to peel things, not having to dress up or know your wines. Sotto Mare! If you are in town, I would suggest coming to this tiny place to get your seafood comfort food fix.  This place is small. Bar seating, narrow space small but the food here is fresh and flavorful. Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was the historical decor, quirky photos of the family who run the place, pots and pans hung up in oblivion making its mark as a serious foodie territory.   The menu is simple and the people who work here are friendly and most likely friends of the family. I ordered the cioppino since it was an obvious popular item and an order of fresh oysters on the half shell. The oysters to start were fabulous. Fresh and sweet, it was really a treat to have it. The cioppino was hearty and full of flavor. It was the culmination of the tomato broth, tomato paste and the seafood broth (most likely clam juice) that set it off for me. Magical. The seafood was strategically placed to cover the entire bowl (perfect for 2 people!), and the bit of penne pasta was the perfect bite to accompany with your crab and prawn, and squid).   Food's great, atmosphere is great. I couldn't ask for a better place to stop by while in SF.",

If you're looking for an intensely upbeat, and entertaining dining experience with a fresh and delicious seafood menu, consider Sotto Mare. \u00a0  Met up with some girlfriends for a 'catch-up' dinner one Friday evening and was taken aback by the \"different\" kind of hospitality demonstrated by all the staff. \u00a0Instead of the usual greeting, I received a complimentary glass of red wine while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. \u00a0Jane L. had the weirdest conversation with one of the men that worked there and had built an interesting relationship by the time I arrived. \u00a0(hahahah...hence the wine...) \u00a0  We were seated downstairs and somehow became the butt of a blonde joke the waiter had playfully invented. \u00a0Kim T. and I split this fettuccine with a lusciously creamy pesto sauce along with thick and juicy sauteed prawns paired with chunky, buttery asparagus. \u00a0The flavors were so well-paired and unbelievably FRESH and delicious. \u00a0When I come back, I'm definitely going to order this one dish that came with a spicy tomato-y sauce... I could smother it in bread and eat it ALL DAY LONG if I could... so good!  The best part of their menu selection was, of course, dessert. \u00a0HAHAH what a bunch of comedians...   I enjoyed dining here and will definitely be back. \u00a0But if you're emotionally sensitive, uptight, get offended easily, and can't handle an intense dining experience, this may not be the place for you. \u00a0  DELIZIOSO!!!!!!!!! \u00a0(Thanks Jane L. for bringing us here!

We arrived without a reservation, expecting to wait awhile to be seated, and even though we were OK with waiting they went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable.

The restaurant is a lot bigger than it seems, we were taken through the restaurant, down the stairs into a second back room. Much different vibe than upstairs. Downstairs is a bit more intimate, with softer lighting and definitely quieter than upstairs.   The bread comes out warm and they keep refilling but don't fill up too soon!   Between four of us we had 12 oysters (West Coast of course!), the Cioppino and the fettuccine with bay scallops. What an awesome meal! Oysters were good but nothing special. The Cioppino though... amazing! Mussels, scallops, crab (cracked to make it super easy for you), clams, squid and shrimp with penne pasta and a great sauce for dipping bread and drinking up! I've never had cioppino before but I think this one will be hard to beat!  The Fettuccine with Bay Scallops was also wonderful though. Thought it would be hard to compare after having the cioppino but the pasta was cooked perfectly and the white sauce was really good.

Warm, perfectly flavored broth, clams, mussels, and TONS of crab. I wish I could remember how the cioppino at Tadich Grill tasted, but it's been too long since I ate there to make a comparison. Either way though, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Make sure you don't wear white when you go, though, since hand-cracking crab covered in red broth is quite messy. Bonus points for the bib, though. 3 out of the 4 of us got the cioppino, and after creating a huge mess, we all left uber-full and satisfied.  Our other friend had a fish, whose name I cannot remember... Dabs? Something along that line. She got a huge plate of about 8-9 lightly seasoned fillets. The fish was very soft and melted in your mouth. Pretty good stuff!  The owner here was an interesting guy. As he led us down the stairs to the dining section downstairs, he started talking about all of the memorabilia on the wall, and also told us that if we hold a fund raiser, he'll buy the food. Yup, that's right. Not sure if he'll keep his word, though. Wait... Where did this fund raiser talk come from? Do we look like the kind of people who hold fund-raisers? Anyway.. after that, he shows us a laminated green paper that explains how the restaurant does NOT serve dessert or espresso. He says it's unhealthy for someone his age, so he doesn't want his customers eating too... To top it all off, towards the end of our meal, he tells my friend that she's eating her cioppino all wrong and REACHES into her plate and grabs a piece of crab out, showing her how she should crack it. WTF??? 0_o? Umm... I really hope his hands were clean.  5 stars for food, minus one star for the owner reaching into my friend's plate lol.",

Oysters were nice and fresh and weren't small like some other places I've been to. It was a first to see my oysters swimming in some water still but gosh, they were delicious. $1.50 for the west coast ones and $2.50 for east coast. I haven't tried east coast to see the dollar difference yet. Chowder was alright and they gave a bread basket when you first sit down. There's olive oil and vinegar for you to dip your bread in and also some butter.  Mostly I would just come back to get oysters if I was ever in the area.",

    "review_text": "Sotto Mare...where have you been all my life? \u00a0Though you're not a fancy Italian seafood restaurant, you're by far better! \u00a0  We arrived on Tuesday evening with 6:30 p.m. reservations and checked in with the hostess who was friendly. \u00a0My initial impression of the restaurant was, \"this place is small\". \u00a0Little did I know, there was a downstairs for additional seating called \"Under the Sea\". \u00a0 \"Under the Sea\" \u00a0has two separate dining rooms (also their banquet room) that can seat a party of 4 or more. \u00a0As we walked passed the narrow walkway by the bar and tables that seat two along the wall, I noticed the bar seating had the best view to the open kitchen. \u00a0  We were immediately served bread upon being seated. \u00a0I'm not sure if they make their bread in-house, but it was hard and cold. \u00a0I would've preferred it to be served warm and soft. \u00a0Also, the butter was ice cold so it was hard to spread. \u00a0Fortunately, I was able to use the bread to sop up the sauce from the cioppino and juice from the clam steamers.  We ordered:  Clam Steamers ($19) - A generous portion of clams in a \u00a0flavorful garlicky broth. \u00a0Simple and very fresh!  Boston Clam Chowder (Bowl w/ entree $6.50) - Not sure how it differentiates from any other clam chowder, but it was full of heartiness and robust flavors. \u00a0It had a nice amount of clams, bite size potatoes, and bacon bits in a creamy flavorful stock.  Risotto ($19) - It was good, but not the best I've had. \u00a0Packed with large prawns, tiny shrimps, calamari, clams, mussels, and baby scallops. \u00a0The risotto might have been undercooked too because part of it was hard. \u00a0Seafood was definitely fresh and rich in variety!  The Best Damn Crab Cioppino ($38) - Good for two people, but can probably feed more if \u00a0you eat like a bird. \u00a0The tomato based broth was well seasoned and the various seafood added a brininess, which enhanced the flavor. \u00a0The seafood components consisted of crab, mussels, clams, tiny scallops, and calamari. \u00a0If you dig to the bottom, you'll find a plethora of penne pasta swimming in the broth. \u00a0 Definitely worth the price for the amount of fresh seafood they give.  Grilled Sand Dabs ($19) - This was my least favorite dish even though it's one of their popular items. \u00a0The portion was generous since they give you about eight or nine sand dabs. \u00a0Although fresh, it needed more seasoning to enhance the flavor . \u00a0This was not a winner.  Service was impeccable! Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and asked numerous times if we're okay on drinks. \u00a0  **NOTE** They do not serve dessert here. \u00a0Instead, they provide you with a list of places nearby. \u00a0  Pros -great service -delicious food  Cons -parking is difficult in North Beach -limited menu -no dessert",

We finished our meal in under an hour so didn't even have to go back out and feed the meter, and the total for 3 people with tip was $90. \u00a0 Not cheap, but again since this turned out to be our dinner, \u00a0I thought it was fine.  Only reason I didn't go 5 stars was that two minutes after I paid the bill, we were asked sort of politely to leave the table given that they had two parties waiting. \u00a0 I understand that, but it was 2:30 by then and not prime time and would have liked to have 5 more minutes to savor the meal and enjoy conversation with a friend.",

Waited 5 minutes at hostess stand while the hostess (looked like one of the owners, elder lady) took a call. Didn't look at us once or even take a quick sec to acknowledge us. When she finally got off the phone, didn't even give simple smile or hello, just had us follow her to our seats.  10-15 minutes after being sat, our waitress finally comes over and with no introduction, she curtly (borderline rudely) asks \"do you want something to drink?\" Well, I WAS thinking of getting a glass of wine but after that lovely intro, no thank you.  We ordered a dozen oysters and a bowl of clam chowder to hold us over before our REAL meal at Tony's.   First off, the bread our waitress served us was completely STALE, almost rock hard.  The clam chowder was bland/tasteless... Progresso almost makes a better one than the one they served up here.  Oysters are pretty hard to screw up and these were decent enough. However, one oyster got so completely botched from the shucking that there were tiny shell pieces all over it that left it completely inedible.  Our waitress never once came to check in on us... Not to refill waters, not to check on our food, not even to drop off our check.  When we had finished our food, I got the text from Tony's that our table was ready. I darted over so we didn't lose the table while the bf stayed at Sottos to pay. I told the Tony's hostess the bf was coming right down as Sottos was just around the corner. She couldn't seat me till both of us were there (understandable). I waited TWENTY FIVE minutes for him. You know why??? Because the SOTTO waitress took FOREVER to flag down. She then took FOREVER to bring the check. She then took FOREVER to process my bfs credit card. Incredible.  I've spent many years as a waitress and I know how crazy it can get when it's busy. Service suffers, I get it. But with the attitude both the hostess and our waitress displayed, it wasn't just a matter of a busy service time. They had the attitude that because of their wild popularity, they don't need to provide you with even remotely decent service.   I hear the cioppino is a must try here. However, I will not be coming back to try it after the saddest customer service experience here",

Right from the start I could tell I was I picked the right place. \u00a0A small outside seating area gave way to a cozy inside, with the warmth and feel of a place you'd feel right at home.  I ended up sitting outside to enjoy the local neighborhood vibe and ended up sitting next to the owner, Gigi. \u00a0He recommended the sand dabs so I went with that; as well as the chowder (based on my locals recommendation) and 6 oysters.  Chowder was creamy and you could tell homemade, oysters were fresh and the sand dabs, lightly saut\u00e9ed and browned perfectly were delicious (and a gigantic portion).",

We were immediately taken to the back of the restaurant, down a flight of stairs to the basement where I head some loud yelling. \u00a0I thought for sure that the San Francisco branch of the mafia would be hanging out in the basement. \u00a0Luckily for us, no mafia. \u00a0Only 2 loud tables of party goers having fun and singing \"Happy Birthday.\" \u00a0  We were quickly seated at our table. Our waitress was none other than my daughter's 4th grade math teacher! \u00a0She was a dead ringer for her teacher, and my daughter was scared. \u00a0She was on spring break and her teacher that is frustrating her with \"Common Core\" math was the last person she wanted to see. \u00a0Luckily, for my daughter, the only thing in common was the looks. \u00a0Our waitress was a little nicer than her 4th grade math teacher. \u00a0She gave us our menus and water for us to drink. \u00a0We ended up ordering their \"Best Damn Crab Cioppino\" and a Pink Pasta. \u00a0As we were waiting, the math teacher brought out some bread for us, and bibs for us to wear.  The \"Best Damn Crab Cioppino\" was advertised as \"Enough for two\" and \"Best Cioppino\" in the city. \u00a0We eagerly awaited it. \u00a0The Cioppino came out in a large metal bowl. \u00a0The math teacher told us that it had an entire crab in it. \u00a0It also had shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and Penne Pasta. \u00a0All of this was mixed together in a delicious red sauce or broth. \u00a0The Cioppino lived up to its name. It was perfectly seasoned. \u00a0Every last bit of seafood in it was eaten. \u00a0There was not a drip of sauce or broth left. \u00a0What wasn't covering my seafood or pasta was either soaked up with the bread, or ladled out of there with a spoon. \u00a0  The Pink Pasta was okay. \u00a0We ordered a half order of the Pink Pasta for the daughter because they do not have fried calamari on the menu. \u00a0She ate a 1/4 of the half order. \u00a0Since her math teacher looked like our waitress, we asked the waitress how much 1/4 of a half is, but, we couldn't get her to gives us the answer. \u00a0Needless to say, my daughter doesn't like red, white, pink, or blue pasta. \u00a0She only likes Yellow macaroni pasta with American cheese. \u00a0  Overall, it was a great experience at Sotto Mare. \u00a0The \"Best Damn Crab Cioppino\" was delicious. \u00a0It almost fed three! \u00a0 Parking is available only if you are lucky. \u00a0Get there early because you won't be there in time after looking for a parking space. \u00a0No Mafia. \u00a0Yes, the waitress did look like my daughter's math teacher.",

Because duh, I just had the best damn seafood + Italian food. AND. It was reasonably priced (bonus points).  + My favorite appetizer was the crab cocktail ($14). It was served on a bed of greens, with fresh and plentiful crab meat. It's perfect for anyone who wants crab without getting their hands dirty (Ahem: guilty as charged).  + Clam Chowder ($6.50): One of the best chowders I've had in SF with a decent amount of bite-sized potatoes, bacon bits, and fresh clams in a creamy flavorful stock.  + And THIS is the highlight of the night: The seafood linguine ($19) was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of creamy alfredo sauce (not too much- and not too little; not too thick- and not too thin). It came with an assortment of mussels, clams, scallops and shrimp, all smothered in a perfect al dente pasta. For once, it felt like I had a higher seafood to pasta ratio. I'm not complaining.  + Sand Dabs ($19): Although it's one of their more popular items &amp; people rave about it on Yelp, it was my least favorite dish here (only because everything else had a OMG-WOW factor). I thought it needed a tiny bit more seasoning to enhance its natural flavor b/c it tasted a bit bland. On the bright side, the portions are generous and is large enough to share.  PS:  It's not a fancy Italian restaurant where you have to dress up, but it IS a chill little spot that fills up quickly on most nights (we tried coming here on Tuesday at 7 pm and the wait was already 1.5 hrs).  Tip:  If you have a party of 3+ you should make a reservation. If you have 2 people...go EARLY!  For more pics and deets, check out the blog! (link in profile)",

I did not believe how much seafood was in the cioppino, it was like an aquarium. Tons of crab, fish, shellfish, shrimp...if it swims in the ocean it was in the pot.

Went in to see if there was a table for eight and it seemed busy so we were already expecting a no and the man (manager, owner?) said to come back in an hour so we were ready to leave but surprisingly he said he can get us a table downstairs if we waited 15 mins. So my family were all waiting outside and after 30 mins we ask if the tables ready and he says that he'll call us when it is. So we wait and after about an hour of waiting outside we ask about the table and they say that the people are about to pay soon so just wait a little longer. So we patiently ( and now that I think about it, a little ignorantly) wait almost two hours total and while waiting another party of about six come behind us and tell him they made reservations. They take them right in and seat them and tell us to wait a little longer and they can seat us outside separately. Ok first off, WHAT? We just waited two hours for our table and you give it to another party and expect us to be ok eating outside on two separate tables?? Anyways we already waited too long to back out so we ask them to combine tables and we finally sit to eat. Oysters were fresh and delicious but the rest of the food was so disappointing. And our server forgot a pasta but never came back outside and by the time she did we were all done eating. So I told her and there was so sorry or any bit of apology. So with all this crap that went on, there was no way I was going to pay the full gratuity on the bill. So I tell her that I will tip but to please remove the gratuity because of the things that went on. Then she tells me that she had no idea we didn't get the other pasta and that we should have told her. Well, hmm.. You're our server and you should have known or have came to check up on us atleast once throughout our meal then you would have known. Anyways, she takes it off after saying its store policy to have it on the bill for big parties and i understand that but please do your part if you're wanting tips. All in all, horrible service and was unimpressed with the food. Heard the owner changed. Maybe that's why.",

There was no lineup. This is the pre-condition. Bear in mind.  When we walked in, the lady said, oh, I don't have anything for you now, yes, bar was full. She recommended downstairs, I was like .. hmm. I saw 2 tables on the first floor, one has 4 seats, one has 2 at the entrance (very tiny space near bar). \u00a0 If you ever have been there, you know what I talked about.  She didn't even recommend that table for 4. There was two guys already sitting on a 4 seats table. Why weren't lead to that spare 4 seats table? I was wondering. Believe me.  However, I asked, if we can sit at 2 tables near entrance besides bar, since I dislike that idea going downstairs, obviously, basement.  Here is the breaking point. After we were seated, there were one old couple coming in, they were seated at that 4 seats table. I still was persuading myself, they may have reservation.  After reading reviews here, by knowing 2 people not required reservation, you can guess what I am thinking.  Let us go back to food. We only order the cioppino. It tastes bland (not salty instead) at the beginning, eventually the right feeling is there. It is good enough.  I agreed with some of reviewers here, it is not only about food to rate a restaurant. I won't be able to imagine, how I enjoy my meal by seating at the entrance, while kept thinking if anyone walking by could flip my plates. \u00a0Yes, I know, I chose to sit there, but there was better option inside, they didn't offer us.  One more thing, the bread. 1st round, 4 slices, I said myself, 'hmm, seems less than other restaurant.. hmm'. You know these days, my son, 8.5 years old, he eats more than me. So my son, guess, was hungry, ate them all almost. The other waiver came over, joking .... She then put on 2nd round, this time, 1/3 more compared to 1st round.  Folks, do you see what I'm saying here? Just that feeling.  Be fare, I am happy with the services the other 2 \u00a0waitress when they served us food/plates etc.   I'm obviously not happy about seating and 'bread' stuff.

I actually like eating at the bar and sip a Bellini while watching the cooks, they work so fricken hard and have that kitchen running on a tight ship.

The only downside would be the lay-out and that our table for 6 was cramped, but really, even that added to the charm. I felt like we were sitting in a cafe in Italy.  Started with bread and olive oil, then tried the clam chowder. Wow. I've never tasted a clam chowder like that. Puts every other clam chowder to shame. And I will forever dream about this chowder -- as I live in Florida and likely won't be back to San Fran anytime soon. Everyone at the table got this chowder and we all loved it.  My boyfriend and I split the Seafood Linguine. Again, delicious. Tons of seafood. Al dente pasta. And the broth. Wow, the broth. Save some room for bread and hoard that plate of broth. It's so incredibly good for dipping bread. I could drink this stuff.  Great, friendly service. And a spacious bathroom. (Does it mean I'm getting old when I judge places by their bathrooms? I was pleasantly surprised by the bathroom. :))  If you're in San Fran, this is a must-try!",

Next their crab salad. \u00a0A very nice portion of fresh and tasty crab surmounted by a dollop of cocktail sauce. \u00a0Good stuff.  Finally, I was told that they were out of sand dabs. \u00a0But rex sole was a great alternative. Plenty of fresh filets. \u00a0And they weren't drowned in some brown butter sauce or olive oil or some other stuff. \u00a0Just the fish with a lightly astringent sauce served on the side. \u00a0Also on the plate were brussels sprouts and carrots that hadn't been messed with. \u00a0Sauteed just enough to have been seared through while retaining their taste. \u00a0Wonderful.

On to the food... the clam chowder was SOOO GOOD!!! I would come back here just to eat gallons of that stuff. The scallops were cooked to perfection as well, and the light sauce that came with it really complemented the dish. I got the chef's seafood risotto, which was super delicious and came with a lot of seafood, way more than I was expecting, so it was really filling.

The food didn't make the experience any better. I ordered the cioppino and my boyfriend ordered the risotto. I think they may have gotten the seafood from the dumpster behind another restaurant, because it tasted repulsive and looked like it had been regurgitated.

It wasn't too salty like most clam chowders, and there were big chunks of clam in it which were delicious.  Then we got the \"Best Damb Crab Cioppino\" and the Linguini with Seafood. Both of these were loaded with shrimp, scallops, clams, and many other seafoods. The crab was so tender and juicy, and the sauce in the cioppino went perfectly with the seafood and bread.  Each table ordered a half litre of their house wine which was only $14! Both the red wine and white wine were good. Though if you were to pair a wine with the seafood, it should be the white wine. :)  The only thing I would say could be better is the bread here.

This owner and/or hostess was rude right off the start to to my friend, who simply asked politely after standing awhile in the door way without being greeted, if we could put our names down. This lady stopped in her tracks and acted annoyed and told my friend, YES! in a stern voice and said Wait!!! I gave my friend a look like wow???? So when this lady was finally able even though it seemed she acts more stressed than the situation calls for, I went up and put my name down. Ok, so we let that slide even though she eventually she said as though we were bothering her, it would be a 45 min wait.... We left for around 45 min. and came back. I went in to ask that same lady, if our names had been called cause we went further than the pager/vibrator distance thing allowed. She was erasing something on her notepad and I waited til she was done and looked up to ask and she said NO with a temper! Like she was annoyed. Okay??? Then I asked if she knew approximately how much longer? I asked in a polite manner. She got upset and said she didn't know and put her hand up and said, \"I erased something cause you were talking!\" I said, \"I believed you were finished.\" She looked up confused. I said, \"You know what, I want my credit card back!\" (I had to give that 45 min prior in order to have the pager she offered) She all of a sudden, puts a nice fake face on and says, \"Oh...Nise Russo, right? Oh that'll be 8-9 minutes.\" I demanded my credit card back yet again and told her Look, I am Italian too and probably have a worst temper, I refuse to spend my money here, not when I am treated this way when we were the ones waiting to here!\" She seemed shocked and FINALLY gave my credit card back to me!????? I am an easy going person til someone is rude or keeps pushing me. I didn't like how after I asked the first time for my credit card back, she suddenly acted nice and somehow knew there was only 8-9 minutes left for our wait after a very HARSH NO was said before and throwing her hand in my face was so unnecessary! If this is how she treats her customers, I feel sorry for her employee's!!! If she is not the owner, then this woman needs to be fired! I will never attempt to eat here. We went to Calzone's and got right in, more spacious atmosphere, and people who know how to greet politely and treat their customers like gold. I WELCOME THE OWNER OR THAT LADY (If you can even call her that because she does NOT act lady -like) TO REPLY TO MY COMMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you are the owner, SHAME ON YOU! If you are just part of the staff, you need to be fired before you give this place a bad name!",

Big chunks of crab and yummy full-fat dressing.   The best part of Sotto Mare, however, is that it's SO OLD and all the decorations are quirky and have history, the register's at the front are super antique, and they have 2 old school safe next to them. LOVE LOVE LOVE!  It's so cute that the whole family works there together and the hostess gives you free wine if you have to wait!",

Okay, so Gigi (the owner-apparent) works the front and seats the customers, but mind you, he's not the friendliest guy you'll ever meet (in fact, he may be the downright most rude host you'll ever meet). \u00a0He was swiggin' wine at the front podium the night I went and yelling at a group of girls who didn't have their entire party present. \u00a0Even the waitresses yelled at him for being drunk. \u00a0Buuut he was nice enough to us :) \u00a0The cioppino immediately dissolved any and all problems- it was just me, my bib, my crab cracker, and a FAT (and I mean for two) bowl of cioppino. \u00a0HEAVEN!!",

I myself have never TRIED cioppino before this, so take my review with a grain of salt :)  My boyfriend and I had a date in SF and parked over a mile away just to get dinner at Sotto Mare! We had heard great things and were really excited to try it out (Did I say \"we\"? I think I made up for 75% of that excitement). It's SO HARD to get parking in Little Italy on a Saturday night, so we ended up having to park almost a mile away! Walking up and down those SF hills sure made us hungry.  Despite getting to Sotto Mare around 7pm, we still had to wait a little over an hour to get a table! This place doesn't have many places to sit, but it is always bustling with people. Over 21? The owner will offer you wine while you wait! :) If you want to explore the bars or Little Italy nearby, she will give you a remote/beeper to let you know when your table is ready - IF you give her your credit card. She is so friendly, talkative, and sweet.   After getting our seats (if you are a party of 2, you will probably have to sit at the bar) it was not too long before we were served out cioppino. I think they are always making at least 4-5 of those at once, since people seem to order it a lot. It was a really filling dish - LOTS of crab and shrimp! - for 2 people. Try to stock up on bread as much as you can, because there is a ton of sauce in the big bowl of seafood, and you can always dip your bread in the sauce so it doesn't go to waste (it's some really good sauce!)  I think if I were to come back here again, I would try some of their pasta or risotto dishes. Those looked like they came in huge portions :)",

It's been on my bookmarks list for awhile so I was happy to finally try them out.  We were warmly welcomed and offered free glasses of red wine from the owner. She was so sweet! After about 10 minutes, we were seated at the bar. We knew we wanted to try the cioppino but I also ordered the linguine with a pomodoro sauce. We also ordered the wedge salad which came with tomatoes and bleu cheese dressing.  Wedge Salad w/ Bleu Cheese dressing ($8) - extremely fresh and tasty! We both loved the bleu cheese dressing and overall it was a great starter.  Linguine w/ Pomodoro sauce ($12/$8 for half) - \u00a0I LOVE linguine and I love fresh tomato sauce, and Sotto Mare did not disappoint! I loved the chunks of tomato and the fresh garlic taste. It's a huge plate so it's also good for sharing.  Cioppino ($38) - Sotto Mare says that they have the \"Best Damn Cioppino in San Francisco\" and I have to agree with them. It smells and looks amazing and tastes even better. The seafood was fresh and the cioppino was filled with clams, mussels, crab, etc. and served with a tomato sauce. My boyfriend especially loved that there was penne pasta at the bottom. It's best for two people but if you have a big appetite, one person can finish it!  I loved everything about our dinner at Sotto Mare - quality seafood, great service, friendly patrons, all in a welcoming atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!",

The place is relatively small so keep your eyes peeled. Come to this restaurant-- you won't regret it!  The BF and I came here on a Saturday night at around 7:30 pm. Sotto Mare has a wonderful feeling of family camaraderie; the staff makes everyone feel like home! Music starts playing and people go wild and dance. Absolutely fantastic! Gigi (the top boss) graciously converses with everyone who waits and gives out wine samples. I guess we didn't mind waiting too much after that.   The clam chowder is one of the best in the area. Don't forget to dip it with bread! As many have mentioned, try the grilled sand dabs, which are perfectly crusted and juicy. The sauteed brussel sprouts and carrots are soooo delicious and fresh that I was thinking of asking for another side order of it! The best of the night was the cioppino, which most share. An Italian-style of the French bouillabaise, it is fantastic. It comes with a half portion of crab, clams, mussels, fish, shrimp, scallops with penne underneath. The seafood is so fresh and the tomato sauce is fantastic!  Service was absolutely delightful, as we were very attentively served. Our waitress even positioned everything for us after each portion of the meal to make sure we were at our most comfortable. We were seated outside and it was a little cold and windy but the food still felt warm and delicious. Come to Sotto Mare sometime, it's definitely one of the best places in SF!",

Its authenticity, warm service, and wonderfully sourced seafood brings me back to times when I was traveling (or eating) my way around the Italian Coast...  My boyfriend and I started off with massive West Coast oysters. I forgot where these were from, but they were HUGE. Normally, I prefer smaller and juicier oysters, but these were fresh and a great way to open up our appetites.  For our entree, we had the cioppino to share, and it was exactly like it was on the menu--the best damn crab cioppino! It came out piping hot, aromatic, and it was stuffed with all the best seafood goodies: squid, whole crab legs, mussels, clams, shrimp, and scallops. I've never had such a flavorful or loaded cioppino. They even had pasta mixed in, which I loved, as it really picked up the flavor of the stew and was a nice carb addition. Extremely filling for two people, and if you haven't hit your limit yet, just dip some of the bread in the amazing stew to soak up every last bit without having to lick your plate clean. It's a less embarrassing way to get your fill ;)  Service is really nice and gives you that family-run, homey feeling. They don't hover over you, but are prompt with requests and getting what you want out to you.

Despite having reservations, showing up early, ordering immediately because we all knew what we wanted, they were constantly rushing us. They brought the bill about 10 minutes into our entrees without asking if we were interested in getting dessert, badgered us to pay the bill before we finished eating numerous times, and said that if we wanted to hog the table we would have to pay $200. Um, we just paid the almost $200 bill for 3 people, lady. WTF! \u00a0And to top it off, their cheap box leaked the rest of my cioppino in the 15 minute walk home into the bag leaving no sauce to enjoy the next day.",

The cioppino was something we'd never had before, nor did we know the difference between east and west coast oysters, but our waitress cheerfully explained both, and we were pleased when both appeared before us. The cioppino stew was exactly as Italian seafood should be: tomatoey, basily goodness that is only done correctly if it makes a mess. Absolutely awesome.  The ambience is also great; we sat at the marble counter where we could watch the chefs do their thing. The hostess and waitress were helpful and affable. I don't think we could have made a better dinner choice if we'd planned to do it. Totally worth waiting for during the evening rush!",

I've had that misfortune in even the finest of restaurants, which is a definite drag! the mixed seafood linguini is loaded with nice variety of fish and the seared combo of scallops and prawns, with a delicious butter/lemon/garlic and caper sauce...YUM! the scallops and prawns were plentiful and both seared to perfection, not overdone. no desert here...but no problem. a nice stroll after your meal brings you upon italian gelato or pastry choices. well...since you're reading this review, you're courious about this place.

Recommended to share with the table if not germaphobic  Crab Cioppino ($35) Their house special dish. Had an entire crab along with baby shrimp mussels and clams in a tomato based soup pasta dish. They pack a lot of seafood into the small pot it comes in. They cracked the crabs perfectly for easy meat access. The flavor was pungent but a little bit too salty for my taste. Although overall the dish was good, I liked their seafood risotto better.  Seafood risotto The best risotto I have ever eaten. Rich in seafood flavor and with every bite I was wanting more. There was the same abundant amount of seafood as the cioppino. This dish was not too salty although not as pungant flavor compared to the cioppino.

Came here for my birthday with my girlfriend, after wanting to visit for quite some time. Being a Monday, we lucked out and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. We started off with some baccala; I've never had baccala before so I don't have a true gauge here but I thought it was very well done, just enough salt and worked in nicely to a savory spread on our sourdough bread.   Next was the reason we came: the fabled cioppino--in short, it was amazing. We split it between the two of us and it lives up to the claim of San Francisco's best. The fish was cooked perfectly--tender and juicy--which can be difficult in a stew like cioppino. I was also happy to see that there tons of it in the stew, it was teeming with scallops, shrimp, mussels, clam, crab legs, etc. Let's also not forget about the element that bring it all together--the broth. Wow, it was unreal. One of the best, if not the best, broth I've ever had. The perfect consistency and spectacular flavor; spiced just right but not enough to overpower the fish. I took a picture of the dish but it does no justice for how truly delicious the meal is; it has to be experienced.   The atmosphere was just the icing on the cake. Obviously a big old school, nautical feel with pictures and big fish effigies hanging from all corners of the walls. Normally that kind of thing feels kitschy or touristy but it's pulled off nicely here and makes you feel comfortable. It's a small place and the kitchen is right behind the counter so you can see, smell, and hear all the awesome stuff they have going on back there. Overall a very casual but very classy ambiance. Some great classic Motown music capped off one of the best dining experiences I've had here in San Francisco.  A+ If you like seafood, it's a must.",

Selection was pretty small (only East and West coast) but the price was just was I was looking for ($1.5-$2.5 each). Unfortunately, I could not say the same for the other items on the menu and ended up spending over $60 just for my lunch. I wanted to give it 4 stars, but the service was just not there. I sat outside alone for a long time especially after I was given my check. I actually ended up going inside to get someone to ring me up after ~10min,  All that said, still had good food and worth a visit.",

After watching him through dinner, I think it's all a ruse and he's actually just a harmless old man.  Sand dab fillets were small and well cooked. Good for sharing!  The clam steamers was also a good portion for sharing. You can tell the clams are good quality. But, the salt monster really attacked this dish!  The cioppino is a really hearty dish and comes with a good variety of different shellfish. Although I'm not yet ready to proclaim it to be the best cioppino ever, we did end up finishing it to the very last drop.",

We ordered the seafood risotto and sand dabs for entrees. It took forever for it to come out - more than 45 minutes! Both entrees were just A-OK. The sand dabs were lightly battered and pan fried.

The atmosphere outside during the day was pleasant, and the staff was appropriately attentive. \u00a0Additionally, they gave us our own pitcher of water, which though informal was a huge plus because we didn't have to wait for refills. \u00a0The bathrooms, though it is slightly uncomfortable to walk through the extremely narrow restaurant to get there, are clean, beautifully designed, and very comfortable. \u00a0I would go out of my way to come here again, even during a time when I would have to wait. \u00a0North Beach is a beautiful neighborhood to walk around in, a fifteen minute walk from the ocean, and this restaurant is a gem within it.",

The wonderful, warm, attentive, and lively employees. \u00a0The ambiance. \u00a0And the food. My god...the food! \u00a0  The fiance and I flew up to SF for gluttonous weekend of food and uhh...back to food. \u00a0After asking for recommendations from a few friends, my friend Linda suggested we high tail it over to Sotto Mare for dinner. \u00a0I wasn't especially craving italian, but the restaurant was just a 20 minute walk from our hotel--so we decided to give it a go. \u00a0We called to make reservations--and they told us it wouldn't be necessary for a table of 2. \u00a0Okay. \u00a0  We got there around 9:00 and the place was packed! \u00a0Okay...no reservations necessary, huh? She must've forgotten it was a Saturday. \u00a0No matter...we were starving and the food smelled amazing. \u00a0The hostess was amazing. \u00a0It was freezing out...there was no room to stand inside...so she gave us each a HUGE glass of wine to warm us up on the patio--for FREEEEEEEEEE. \u00a0Okay...free tugs at my heart strings. \u00a0  So, it was looking like a 30 to 40 minute wait. \u00a0With my monstrous glass of wine...we were okay out there. \u00a0That is until 9:45 when they flipped the sign from open to CLOSED! Startled, we ran in. \u00a0They were super busy...and there were a few open tables...and we realized that she had forgotten about us. \u00a0Startled, she grabbed us, apologized and put us at the counter (yay! I love to see them cook...and it was actually a great place to dine. \u00a0I would take these seats over a normal table anyday!). \u00a0And no, we weren't peeved...we were starving...and buzzed on an empty stomach. \u00a0  So oh boy...did we order tons of food. \u00a0We ordered a bowl of the clam steamers, seafood risotto, and since they were out of their fish of the day, she recommended the sand dabs. \u00a0Sure! \u00a0She was weary that we'd be able to finish off all that food...but we assured her, she didn't know us well enough to make that statement. \u00a0  Food? Freaking phenomenal! \u00a0The Clam steamers were outrageously good! \u00a0This was an extremely generous dish...soooo many clams! \u00a0And the sauce....whatever it was...it certainly wasn't the typical white wine/garlic \u00a0sauce you see everywhere else. \u00a0It was amazing! \u00a0We had to ask for more bread to suck if all the sauce...and when we decided to conserve stomach space, we opted for just drinking it. \u00a0Yeah, it was embarrassing...and yeah, we returned a bone dry bowl. \u00a0Amazing! \u00a0  Seafood risotto--clams, shrimp, scallop, and calamari? Oh yeah...Wonderful. \u00a0Absolutely amazing. \u00a0This dish was LOADED with seafood. \u00a0So much so, that at one point, we wanted to ask for more risotto. \u00a0Sooo good!   Sand Dabs--lightly fried filets. \u00a0Plain looking? Yes. \u00a0But boy are they good. \u00a0The fish is wonderfully flaky, and just a simply naturally sweet fish. \u00a0Very good. \u00a0  Soooo good...that we're definitely going to dine here again the next time. \u00a0And I'll try to refrain from ordering the same things.",

    "review_text": "North Beach is filled with many restaurants and bars and stumbling upon a great choice can be hard. If you are reading this review, look no further and definitely come give this place a try.  Most famously known for their Cioppino, this italian seafood restaurant does justice to the dish. Cioppino originated from San Fran right in North Beach. If you want authentic, high quality, tasty, and a bite of history, cioppino is definitely a must get dish.  For my visit, the upstairs dining area along with the outside seating were full. When stepping in, I was immediately greeted and told there would be a 20 minute way. However, she mentioned there is actually seating downstairs. After agreeing to get seated right away, we were led to the downstairs area which had many tables empty so I wasn't sure why we were told of a 20 minute wait. Nonetheless, we were happy to not wait.  Started out with the Half Crab appetizer. I was hoping for a true half but the appetizer plate came with just the lefts and claw. No body. It tasted fresh so i had no complaints  On to the main dish. Cioppino ($41). Crab, clam, shrimp, mussels, scallop, squid, penne pasta underneath it all. The price may seem high but you soon forget about it after seeing the metal pot with the amount of seafood in it. They really don't skimp out on any ingredient. The stew was full of flavor, fresh seafood, a ton of every seafood. DEFINITELY worth $41 price tag.   Service was prompt, friendly, and very helpful. Water refilled quickly, bread basket refilled quickly, and check in-s often.   A rich in history for a rich in flavor restaurant. Definitely a must check out place.  GO GO GO GO GO!!!!!",

(make a reservation esp for big parties!! the place is small and crowded but does have additional dining rooms downstairs)   We were seated in a small dining room downstairs with other large parties and it was definitely loud, kind of hard to hold conversation but it was fine for the family. Our server alerted us right away that she was also tending to a party of 19 and apologized in advance if her service was a little splotchy. I thought she still did great! and it was plus for the heads up! :)   Now, on to the food, we ordered the cioppino (obviously!), the seafood risotto, the seafood linguini, the clam steamers and the prawn cocktail. The appetizers came out pretty quickly for how busy it was. The prawn cocktail was okay. nothing extraordinary but you can't really mess up a prawn cocktail (it was fresh though!) and the clam steamer was pretty good. lots of clams, but a little salty for my taste.  (**side note: I was not a huge fan of their bread. It was warm or doughy enough. If you like hard and crusty then you'll like sotto mare's bread. I just thought it wasn't ideal if you're using that as a vehicle to sop up amazing sauces and soup.)   Our entrees came out maybe 10 mins after we've finished our appetizers and everything was good. Didn't look like much for 5 people but everything was so filling! \u00a0The pasta was a little heavy for my taste but they definitely don't skimp on the seafood. Same with the risotto. Cioppino was pretty good. I think I've had better though. Not sure how I felt about the penne in there. I felt like it doesn't really need it.   Overall Sotto Marre is a good place to experience and try but be prepared for the splurge! (and wear loose jeans...or sweats. I won't judge. )",

Perfect rice to seafood ratio.  I would suggest to maybe not order the Lobster ravioli if you've ordered the risotto. It will taste slightly bland after you've tasted the risotto. Also maybe skip the Smoked Salmon Fettucine if you don't like smoked salmon that much. It was also pretty basic; creamy sauce, smoked salmon, fettucine.

We loved it - they don't serve coffee or dessert, just AMAZING, quality seafood.  2 - Do expect quality seafood, and only seafood. Everything is fresh. Nothing is fried. The only meat they serve is a bit of bacon in the clam chowder.   3 - Do GET THE CIOPPINO. Amazing. Perfect broth and worth every penny of $38. Bursting with crab, scallops, mussels, clams, shrimp, penne. Fantastic.  4 - We had the steamed mussels/clams, scallops, and seafood risotto and we loved everything.   5- We dropped $110 on the dishes above plus 1 beer (plus $20 for tip) but we left very very satisfied. I will so be back.   6 - Very important - DO GET A RESERVATION. We did, and we savored the hateful stares of those waiting in line.",

    "review_text": "I have been here twice. The most recent was on 1/21/12. Both times we came around 4-5pm and were able to get a table right away. If you don't make a reservation, you still have a good chance of getting a table if you come before 5pm. When we left around 6pm there were a group of people waiting outside for a table. The restaurant is narrow and there isn't a lot of seating; a few tables and a bar that faces the kitchen. It may not be good for large groups. We came in a party of four, but I think that is the largest that would comfortably sit together. The open kitchen is fun as you can see the cooks in action. Nice little place my in-laws loved. Great for bringing out of town guests. We ordered the Cioppino both times, and added a large bowl of clam chowder the second time. The Cioppino is enough for two people. If you are really hungry, you might want to add a soup or appetizer.   Cioppino: This is excellent. I definitely recommend ordering this. The seafood is very fresh, and they give you a lot of it. The broth/sauce that its cooked in is flavorful but not overbearing. The pasta is tender and fresh. Tip: keep the lid on the pot while you're eating to keep it hot. It makes a difference.   Clam Chowder: Good. Lots of fresh clams, creamy, good flavor. But not the reason I come here.   Bread:  Every time we've come here, we are surprised at how not good the bread is, because everything else is so delicious. I understand that their focus is seafood, but how hard would it be to get better bread? It's so dry and tastes like day-old bread. The butter packets that come with it are really good and I like to butter the bread and dip it into the Cioppino. It's really not important, but I just wanted to say it.   Summary: Cioppino: 5/5 Clam Chowder: 4/5 Bread: 2/5  Bottom line:  *Order the Cioppino when you go *Keep the lid on to keep it hot and tasty *Don't judge the place by its bread *Plan to have desert somewhere else - they don't serve it",

This restaurant is crowded, noisy, but has the best damn Cioppino we could ever imagine! \u00a0Granted, we are not Cioppino experts, but we certainly know what fresh seafood should taste like, and this was definitely IT! \u00a0The broth was amazing, and even better sopped up with the wonderful, crusty sourdough bread! \u00a0It was plenty for the two of us to share.  We started with some amazing pacific oysters (haven't had a bad oyster in San Francisco yet) and they were perfect. \u00a0  This place is small, family run, and fun (as long as you don't mind the noise).  Sitting at the bar was comfy and fun - we got to watch the oysters being shucked and the crabs being cracked!  We highly recommend this place!",

(Maybe it's because I look like I'm 16, but seriously...) But she did offer us free wine tastings while we were waiting, so I guess that made the situation a little better.  We ordered the cioppino to share between 4 people in addition to our entrees which was divine! Definitely a must have! Another must have is their oyster shooters!!

The clam chowder came with bread and there were two portion sizes-the bowl and the plate! Of course, I went with the bowl! It was very creamy and there lots of chunks!   The seafood risotto was also very good and the portion was huge! After the clam chowder, I could not have possibly finished my main too!

It's small space, but lively and super cute...you can see the food being prepared right before your eyes!  The staff is so friendly and makes you feel like family. Not to mention very helpful.  As we sat down they brought us this delicious fresh bread with butter and some ice cold water which was great since we were starving.   Ordered the \"best damn crap cioppino\" and since we're little less adventurous with our seafood, asked if they could make it with only crab, prawns and shrimp, which they very kindly did :)  The portion was HUGE! Came in this steaming in fancy steel bowl/pot type thing, and they give everyone those paper bibs with the lobsters on it which was really cute.   The food was so fresh and delicious, and the crab was awesome!!! definitely worth the wait and the price. Two of us ate plentifully, and there was still half left!  Loved the friendly atmosphere and the decorations and just the whole feel of the place. Very fisherman's wharf/nautical themed.  WILL DEFINITELY VISIT AGAIN WHEN I'M IN SAN FRANCISCO :D",

First sign that this place is where its at, a long wait and an exhausted looking but friendly staff. We were immediately greeted by the hostess who told us the wait would be right around 15 minutes. Once we were seated at the bar, our friendly waitress popped up and provided us with water. The place was buzzing with people...and everyone's food looked quite appetizing.   We ordered: Grilled Sand Dabs with fresh veggies 1/2 dozen of West Coast Oysters on a half shell Half order of Cracked Crab  The Cracked crab was pretty amazing...the meat was sweet and fresh and easy to pick through. The cocktail sauce was pretty life-changing...the right amount of horseradish...yum. The West Coast Oysters were pretty disappointing though. Being from the East coast, I'm used to fat and juicy oysters with tons of flavor...meh...these were very small and $1.50 each :(...wasn't lacking on flavor though. The Grilled Sand Dabs was fresh and cooked perfectly. It was my first time ever hearing of Sand Dabs and even tasting that type of fish and I was very pleased.  Prices here are pretty affordable for a popular seafood spot. The service was pretty good...our friendly hostess made me feel like I was leaving a friend's house because she gave us a huge hug when we were leaving...made it that much harder to leave :( I love this place....the next time I am in SF, I will be sure to stop by Sotto Mare again.",

Besides the menu, it was pretty awful that we had to wait 15 minutes in the packed entry-way before the hostess even spoke to us. \u00a0Since we had a reservation, our table was already waiting for us. \u00a0Considering how many other people were here trying to wait for a table, reservations are definitely a good idea here!  The restaurant appeared really tiny, and we had six people in our group... I didn't know how we were gonna fit, until the hostess led us downstairs into their basement dining room. \u00a0It was still pretty small downstairs, but better-suited for groups; it could probably seat ~two dozen people. \u00a0The painted murals on the walls made the basement atmosphere not so bad, I suppose. \u00a0The service was also very friendly.  I really wish I liked it more, but they just didn't offer enough variety in their menu for me. \u00a0Everyone else in my group was happy enough, though!  Interesting note: they don't offer desserts. \u00a0A laminated-note on the table had some explanation about the owner having diabetes, and had a few suggestions for nearby businesses that served desserts.",

When I've walked past it though, the outside didn't exactly call to me; it's very old-school, kind of dive-y looking from afar. Don't let the outside fool you though, this place is a serious gem (like everyone else has clearly discovered already). It has a Swan Oyster Depot-esque divey-ness about it; very old school San Francisco. My boyfriend and I popped in, intrigued by the menu and the ratings, and were seating at the bar where we were helped by friendly staff.   We started with oysters shooters and a half dozen oysters before moving onto the main course. There are a number of dishes that look incredible (the seafood risotto was really calling my name), but we ended up ordering the cioppino to split. GREAT CALL on the boyfriend's part. When they say this is the best cioppino in town, they're not kidding. It's a huge bowl (definitely enough for two) and it's packed with deliciousness. Slap on the bib for good measure because it can get a bit messy! Like another reviewer said, this isn't the place to come if you're looking for an intimate Italian dinner for two but if you're looking for great food in a fun environment, this is hard to beat!",

We made the mistake of driving so I dropped her off first to grab a table while I went around and hopelessly searched for parking.   Although they wouldn't seat her until I got there, they were nice enough to give her a complimentary glass of red wine while she waited for me. We decided to get a cup of clam chowder with the crab cioppino and let me just say it really is the \"best damn crab cioppino\"! It was SO good. The seafood was fresh and did not taste like it'd been sitting out all day and the portion was just enough to get two people to the right amount of full without being too little or too much. The service is nice too and they consistently checked if we were doing okay and if the food was to our liking; we told them yes repeatedly.   Overall I will definitely come back here with friends because I'm sure they've never had anything like the cioppino before. I would recommend this place to anyone craving some good Italian food in Northbeach.",

Food = 5 but service = 2  Food: very tasty - started with the clam chowder: really good but wasn't as great as some of the reviews hyped it up to be. can't beat clam chowder from boston.  - cioppino: TASTE was really good. if you like seafood, definitely get this. However, the only thing is that it's so expensive - risotto: very tasty. highly recommend - sand dabs: i did not even know such a fish existed, but delicious! love the way it was prepared and seasoned.   Service: wow... i don't mind waiting for a long time if it's expected, but these people told us that we had a 25 minute wait, but then said 15 to 20 minutes more about 2 or 3 more times. we ended up sitting over an hour later. and that's just sitting the service was then pretty darn slow too. Our server was friendly, but very slow.   Price: too expensive. While the food was really amazing, i don't think it was worth the amount we ended up paying.   Overall, if you want some good italian seafood and don't mind long waits and expensive bills, try this place!",

The food was fantastic, the oysters fresh(according to my friend) and the chowder good.   Since I only I had the cioppino, I can only comment on that dish. The Cioppino had a such a wide variety of seafood, sure it was expensive at 38 bucks, but I found it worth it. You'll find: clams, mussels, squid, crab, fish, scallops, two types of shrimp, and pasta. It's not too much, but it's a good amount of food. You'll definitely eat up and make sure you savor that broth, it's worth every sip.   The service is nice and the ambiance special.(I really like homey places that are a bit different and unique from other restaurants - Sotto Mare definitely fits the bill.)  Honestly, I think it's a 4.5 star, but since I have to choose, I would give it a 4.  Give Sotto Mare a look, it's definitely on my list of places to visit.",

The place was a bit on the empty side around 1:30 in the afternoon. \u00a0Waiter, server and seafood afficionado Glen greeted me as I stepped into the restaurant. \u00a0I took a seat at the counter which is my usual routine here. \u00a0I had intended to have the fabulous cioppino, but when Glen read off the daily specials my attention shifted to salmon.  Giant Coho Salmon caught fresh from the Columbia River served grilled with an olive oil and garlic Bordelaise sauce was the first special he described, and at that point my focus was lost. \u00a0I think the other two specials were striped bass and Lingcod. \u00a0Anyway, as you've probably assumed I ordered the Coho Salmon. \u00a0I had a cup of the Boston Clam Chowder also. \u00a0Fresh sliced French bread is always offered with butter, and I had my usual cola in a glass with the slushed ice.  The clam chowder was robust with flavor and so hearty. \u00a0They chop the potatoes down to smaller pieces, almost bits, to match the size of the clam pieces. \u00a0I'm not exaggerating to suggest that the portion of clam was higher than the portion of potatoes either. \u00a0Celery and bacon bits are also included in the rich soup stock. \u00a0I finished my entire chunk of bread with the chowder.  The fish took some time to cook, but when it arrived it was perfect. \u00a0The thick, half pound cut was expertly grilled retaining its moisture and tenderness throughout. \u00a0Often I fear that big cuts of fish like this are unevenly cooked, but that wasn't the case here. \u00a0The crispy grilled salmon skin which was served on the bottom was a delight to eat. \u00a0I've always enjoyed crispy salmon skin. \u00a0Loaded with chopped garlic I had to walk up to a local store afterward for a can of breath mints before I could return to work.  The salmon was served with fresh carrots and green beans, both cooked al dente. \u00a0Both were crunchy and sweet.",

I really enjoyed the crab and prawns, and every time I went back to ladle the cioppino out of that silver bowl, I swear, I was finding more and more seafood. Trust, you will need to ask for extra bread throughout your meal to sop up the tasty broth. I shared the cioppino with a friend and we were thoroughly stuffed at the end of our meal. We kicked off dinner with some oyster shooters which I just loved. We also ordered a half carafe of the house white which was a bit disappointing. It wasn't very smooth but I guess I didn't notice as much once we started eating the cioppino.  I love the ambiance inside of the restaurant which combines the feel of an oyster bar with a simple sit-down restaurant. There is also seating right out front. Service was friendly but it seemed like our waitress forgot about us toward the end of our meal. We came on a Friday night right after getting off of work and were seated right away at the bar.

Before I say more, I just want to say that this place is similar to Swan Oyster Depot but I think Sotto Mare is a lot better hands down and don't recommend ever going to Swan Oyster Depot. Read my review about them for more insight.  Anyway, the food here will blow your mind and you will get super full because the portions are very generous.  We ordered these and our stomachs were 100% satisfied: 1) the \"best damn crab cioppino\" with seafood 2) grilled sand dabs ~ fillets 3) boston clam chowder  These 3 dishes can make 3 people full or 2 people too full. These items are what you need to have a good Sotto Mare experience. Maybe get some oysters too if you have more than 1 stomach.  The service was great and it was fun to watch the chefs go to work. This is one of the best restaurants in North Beach and any seafood lover should check it out. The oceanic atmosphere and smell/sight of fresh fish make sitting at the bar a better experience. Your clothes might smell a little fishy after eating here, but it's not too bad like at a Korean BBQ joint with poor ventilation.",

Came here after super long workout today and were actually trying to get back into Tony's Pizza but had a hour plus wait (at 3pm) - and Tony's IS WORTH IT - but we needed something to curb our appetites - walked around and our first three stops were closed, so settled here - big disappointment!!  First off, waitress was very curt and, at first, borderline rude - she got better throughout in her defense, and we were \"hangry\", so will cut her slack. \u00a0Place is small to begin with and they crowd them in - had only three things, but so mediocre that hard to imagine coming back. \u00a0  1) Stale bread - this is just a simple thing to do, just pop that bread in a warming oven and serve (see Chapeau for how to do this) - so many restaurants fail at what can be the easiest way to win over your dinners - and this bread wasn't just bad, it was cold and stale!!!  2) Oysters - hard to mess up and these were pretty good actually - freshly ground horseradish was very good.  3) Clam chowder - meh at best - about right creamy consistency but lacked any flavor much less clammy taste.  Understand that they \"serve best Cioppino in the Bay\" and did see some large bowls containing said \"best\" - can't really see returning to try though...very underwhelmed.  As I started, too many restaurants that earn a \"reputation\" get lazy and convert to turn and burn service - this falls into that sad catagory - only upside is that it keeps a number of people away from really great places like Tony's just down the street!! :-)",

When my cioppino arrived, it was only lukewarm (c'mon, really?!), and the liquid part of the stew was too sweet. I would say yes, there's a lot of seafood in there and for the price it's quite worth it, but i wouldn't say this cioppino blows my mind in terms of its flavor, it's really just okay, I'm not impressed.",

The rave about this place is real. Came here around 8 p.m., before a crowd boom 30 minutes later. The 2 of us waited for a bit but it was not brutal, just a little awkward. To make the wait a little less tedious, the hostess was such a gentleman and offered the waiting guests some wine. Not great wine but at least it's much better than water.  Got seated by the bar and we had a great view of the employees at work. Almost everyone is so hardworking and persistent; it really is a fast-paced environment and you haven't eaten at Sotto Mare unless you experience the banging of the dishes and the singing of wine glasses clinking. It is amazing how this place operates...it almost seems robotic.   We got the crab ciopinno, which was all what we really needed for the night. I won't repeat every word in the dictionary people raved about this in rapture but I've never been so full from eating half (or maybe even less) of something in my life. Seriously, even if you come with an empty stomach, I think even 3 people would suffice. It has all the wonders of the bay--scallops, mussels, crab, shrimp--all the goodness! The cold bread wasn't that great but tastes better dipped with the tomato stew. The stew was very rich and I'm very sensitive to spices but I think it would've been dull without any pepper. My first time having ciopinno and I don't eat a whole lot of Italian food but this was a nice surprise--a very filling, nice surprise. Not a lot crabs but I don't think I could've taken anymore regardless.   One thing I really suggest is to WEAR THE BIB because I thought I was flawless with food and wasn't going to get anything splattered on my clothes but those damn crabs, especially when you're opening them will splash on your clothes, so WEAR IT!   The really strange thing is that it's listed as $32 on the menu but when we got our tab, it came out to $41. When asked about it, our waitress (had pinkish skin) pretty much had her nose up in the air and didn't seem to care in her dull tone. Other than her inattentive service, everyone else was very respectful and nice and made us feel very welcomed despite how busy they were. This is a real Italian place and I think they do a great job of preserving their heritage because everyone who works here is a true Italian, which gives this place more meaning.",

The only place in the Bay Area with seafood as fresh is the Tamales Bay oyster farm itself. (Hog Island Oyster Co in the Ferry Building is also delightful.)  What I recommend:  Seafood linguine Holy moly, can pasta really taste like this? Life-altering. And a very pretty salmon color.  Steamed mussels Huge. Fresh. And the BROTH.  Clam chowder Yum. I prefer Hog Island's because it's lighter (and still has the bacon) but this really hits the spot when you're starving!  I've also gotten the crab cioppino (what this place is known for) and blue cheese wedge salad with crab, but I guess I'm just not a cioppino/salad person.

I was putting together a dinner for 35 of my coworkers and Sotto Mare was incompetent, rude, and left me in a terrible position just a couple of days before the event, which is on 5/10/11.   Call 1 - Spoke to Gigi, the owner (4/26/11)  Me: How many can you accommodate in your private room, Dante's Inferno?  Gigi: It's for 30 people but the absolute max we can fit is 42.  Me: What is your corkage policy?  Gigi: What's corkage? Don't worry, it's free. Bring your wine.   Call 2 - Spoke to Luisa, the manager and Gigi's sister-in-law (5/2/11)  Me: Hi, I would like to book the private room for a group. Right now, I have 32 people committed but it may be closer to 35-40.  Luisa: Lady, I'm don't know who talked to you before but the room is for about 25 people. 32 is too many.  Me: Well, Gigi told me 42 max.  Luisa: Fine.. But 38 is the absolute MAXIMUM. Call me on Friday to confirm your party size.  Me: And corkage is $0, right?  Luisa: We will have to charge you a bar fee of $100 even though corkage is $0.  Me: Gigi didn't tell me that. He said it was free.  Luisa: Well, it's not corkage. It's a fee for the bar because if you bring your own drinks, we can't make money off the alcohol.  Me: Isn't that the point of $0 corkage? Anyway, I'll give you my credit card number to hold the room.   Call 3 - Spoke to Luisa (5/6/11)  Me: Hi, I just wanted to let you know that there will be 35 people in our group.  Luisa (sounding very upset): I told you 30 max.  Me: No, you told me 38 and Gigi told me 42.  Luisa: Fine, but no more. Only 35. It's for your own good not to bring any more people. Also, we still need to charge you $100 for the bar fee since we will not be making money from the alcohol and I will have to hire an extra employee on Tuesday since that room isn't usually open on Tuesdays.  Me: Well then, aren't we providing extra revenue already since that room isn't usually open on Tuesdays?  Luisa: Do you want it or not? Call me back in a few minutes after you've thought about it.   Call 4 - Gigi called me 2 minutes after I hung up with Luisa (5/6/11)  Gigi: I want to let you know that THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THAT THE ROOM CAN ONLY SEAT 25. I HAVE TO CANCEL YOUR RESERVATION FOR TUESDAY.  Me: You just found out NOW about the maximum capacity?  Gigi: I don't know who took your booking but we shouldn't have allowed that many people.  Me: YOU are the one who told me maximum 42.  Gigi: Well, we can't do it. It needs to be cancelled.  Me: But your Yelp page says Dante's Inferno can seat 30. Are you lying?  Gigi: Usually, people book for 30 and only 25 show up so it works out ok.  Me: SO, YOU'RE A BOLDFACE LIAR...GREAT. What am I supposed to do now that you've cancelled on me 4 days before my dinner party? And, you have not even said sorry one time on this call. You're screwing me over.",

The host was very friendly and offered us each a complimentary glass of wine while we waited - a very nice touch. \u00a0  To start, we ordered a dozen oysters - trying their east and west coast oysters. \u00a0All were good but the west coast oysters take the day any day of the week. \u00a0They were fresh, meaty and had a nice brininess to them.   We had to order the Cioppino and it was some of the best cioppino I've ever had. It is huge and is meant to serve 2. \u00a0It is a tomato based broth that has a great seafood base and is served with some penne pasta that still has a nice bite to it. \u00a0The Cioppino is overflowing with seafood - lots of crab, shrimp, mussels, calamari, clams and octopus. All of the seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked. \u00a0It is seafood heaven! \u00a0Now that I am thinking of the cioppino, my stomach is rumbling.

I had a hankering for great seafood and was not disappointed. The hostess/owner handed us a lobster shaped pager and sent us down the street for a drink. About 45 mins later, the pager buzzed and we were promptly seated at the bar upon arrival back to the restaurant.   I loved sitting at the bar as you can see the line cooks preparing the food. Needless to say, I enjoyed the show as much as I enjoyed the food. We order the crab salad. The crab was fresh and very meaty. It sat on top of a bed of lettuce which was probably unnecessary. It was overwhelming, but the crab was fresh.   The star of the show is the 2 person cioppino. If you have not tried this and have been to this restaurant, then you are MISSING OUT! The chioppino had fresh mussles, clams, lobster, crab, shrimp, and squid. It was ALL very tasty. The broth it came it was very flavorful. We were stuffed by the end, but didn't want to waste a single drop!   The girl next to us ordered the scallop entree and I've never seen a restaurant give so many scallops in one order! There was 9 large scallops in her order and I think she ate about 1/2.   I highly recommend this place regardless of the wait. You just come prepared and head next door for a before dinner drink.",

Wearing tacky yet hilarious bibs with crabs on them was a lot more hysterical, as was admiring the raw fish just hangin' out (literally, hanging) behind the bar, and the rusty-boat themed decor like steel pipes, fish taxonomy posters, and those silly porcelain fish cookie jars that 50 year old housewives are so fond of.  We tried the cioppino, sand dabs, and clam chowder, based on the Yelp reviews, and were not left disappointed. I think the sand dabs were my favorite, because unagi/barbecued eel is one of my favorite seafood dishes and the sand dabs had a very similar, soft and melty texture.

The restaurant offers much more than just clam chowder, it's only an appetizer on the menu but I always order a bowl when I come in.  I've had their mussels and Prawn saute as well, both awesome! You can also add a cup of bowl of the tasty chowder to your entree for $5 or $6.50 respectively, I believe.   I also call in a lot and take home some chowder (as you can tell, I like the stuff A LOT). $8 for a pint and $13 for a quart is money well spent! Not gonna lie, I usually do the quart.",

And was totally blown away by how great tasting the sauce and seafood was...but here are my highlights  1) Great Service-- I mean specifically, what a sweet owner! He is so adorable  2)Get the Crab Cioppino (basically it's an assortment of seafood I believe braised in this red sauce that tastes like magic pretty much.) It feeds 2 and fills you for your money's worth. Do it. it's a must!. We weren't sure if it would fill us and was tempted to order a side of penne but were surprised!  3) I absolutely love the ambiance. It's has that cute hole in the wall feel with the AWESOME food quality. \u00a0Casual but nice--date place? Check. And the decor of the place? Loved it!  4) love the music  5) delicious garlic bread and butter  Warning: There is a line. Come early. And they close early kinda (in my world 9:30 is kinda early). So come prepared and hungry~",

The last time I went, my friends and I ordered two orders of the cioppino, an order of risotto, and 3 bowls of clam chowder (between three people). The risotto is good (but I've had better). The clam chowder is out of this world amazing especially with the complimentary bread (just dip it in or let it soften up in the soup) - YUMMMM.   The morning after this meal, I woke up drooling thinking about the legit dinner I had the night before. It's THAT good!

Backstory: We went here after finding out we had accidentally cancelled a reservation at Atelier Crenn and after finding Tony's Pizza had a 1 hour wait. We were told there was a 20 minute wait and we went next door to the bar for drinks. 10 minutes later, the lobster that they gave us buzzed and we were granted entrance.  Food:  Special of the Night - Spinach Ravioli: Creamy, hearty, fresh. 4 stars Benita's Baccala: Chunky cod in a tomato gravy sauce. Spoon it on your bread and it's delicious.  Oysters: Good and relatively inexpensive for what it was. Good deal. Smoked Salmon: LOVED it. I had gone on a cruise the week before, where the smoked salmon tasted stringy and \"old\". This tasted like sushi with more flavor. It helps that I had the previous comparison to fully enjoy the smoked salmon. Bread: Nice but I wasn't blown away. Seemed a bit standard. But it's free!  Ambiance: We were served by this woman who seems like she is one of those wise diner veterans who could recite the menu backwards if she had to. Fast, great attention to all of the tables (she was serving many! the house was PACKED) and super professional. Maybe she's the owner or the owner's wife? Not sure, but she's awesome.",

    "review_text": "This restaurant has the classic small San Francisco restaurant vibe to it, where the bar seating has the best view to the kitchen and allows direct interaction with the prep cooks and chef(s) that are preparing various orders. That being said, it is a small restaurant and the wait can become a bit long; so be sure to make reservations or to come at a time that is not \"rush hour.\"  I found the staff to be direct in letting you know what they can or cannot do, give realistic wait times, and occasionally offer some \"San Franciscan banter\" on current/loval events. I definitely appreciate this, as they leave little room for confusion.  Their crab cioppino was very good. It is definitely large enough to feed two people. The tomato based sauce/broth was well seasoned and was enhanced by the various seafood that added a rich brininess, which reminded me of the sea. The seafood components which comprised of mussels, clams, calamari, and crab were all perfectly cooked. I would have liked to have had an additional spice component to really \"wake things up,\" but it was still very good.  The seafood linguini was good, as the linguini was cooked al dente. It had a cream sauce that was also enhanced by the seafood. The linguini seafood components varied from mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp, and bay scallops; and were all nicely cooked. Unfortunately, the cream sauce was a bit too heavy, which overpowered the delicate seafood.   Definitely a good spot to come with a couple friends that like seafood. The cioppino is definitely a must order, as it is their signature entree. Due to the portion sizes, most entrees on the menu are definitely shareable.",

The food was 5 stars! I got penne with pomodoro sauce and my brother and mom shared the cioppino. The pomodoro sauce had a little bit of spice to it, which I loved. The bread and butter were also really good. The cioppino is quite big ($41) and filled both my mom and brother. My mom was kind of disappointed that half of it was penne pasta noodles though.   Overall, if the women paid attention to the customers as much as they do to each other they would have gotten 5 stars, but the lack of customer service really killed it.",

No table cloths, no candles, no officious waiters (they kind of go the opposite direction, which is the only reason I gave four stars instead of five). We waited for the bar to open up and they gave us a glass of wine while we waited. We ordered oysters on the half shell, the half crab (plenty, glad I did not order the full crab), and special which was grilled salmon. Everything but the bread was good.

He showed me the hook to hang my purse and after I sat down, he gave me a little push so I'm close to the table. It was cute!  Cioppino: I'm not a huge seafood person, but we decided to get it because that's what they're known for. A MUST TRY! If you have to get ONE thing, get this! Such a huge variety of different types of seafood including crab, clams, shrimps, scallops, squid and mussels. It is very generously portioned. That dish can probably feed 4 people. I love the thick tomato sauce. It also had some penne pasta in it.  Pasta: we got a side of pesto paste. It was deeeelcious! Full of flavor ad very creamy.

We've found that this makes a great appetizer to split for the table (6 people can get a good taste out of one pot, and 4 get a decent size serving). I've also enjoyed their sand dabs and generously-portioned pasta dishes. Don't bring your non seafood eating friends along--there is nothing on the menu for them (except maybe plain pasta?).

Due to the limited street parking in San Francisco, we arrived 15 minutes early to try to find parking. After circling the block a few times without success, I decided to drop off the family in front (at the no parking sign) and go searching on my own. As we disembark, an older gentleman sitting at the front table asks us if we are eating here. When we say yes, he moves the no parking sign and tells us to park our car. It turns out that the old man was the owner Gigi!  As a party of seven, when we walked into the restaurant, I didn't see any space for us. There was a massive bar on one side and a few small tables pushed against the other side. However, we were lead to the back and down the stairs into a cozy room underground. It was a bit dark but warm and inviting.  We read the reviews on yelp and knew that we were going to order the crab cioppino and clam chowder. Both were the best cioppino and clam chowder we ever had! I also ordered the prawns and scallops and they were perfectly cooked. Our kids are picky eaters so we ordered the penne pasta with pomodoro sauce and it was excellent, they loved it.  I've never been fans of oysters but decided to try them out. They have two varieties, west and east coast oysters. The west coast was described as more briny than the east version. We ordered half a dozen east coast oysters and they were amazing!
