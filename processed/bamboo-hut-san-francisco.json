The volcano bowl was just one big slushy with a hint of rum and 151. Interesting to look at, and not bad for $10 (normally $20) to share between 4 people but too weak of a drink to get my Friday night started off. Be careful of brain freeze!  I preferred their Bamboo Breeze more for the minty, mojito taste. The alcohol was stronger in this one.  Someone was setting up some band equipment... perhaps for a live performance later on? But we up and left after we finished our drinks, and just in time too as a group of already-drunk and annoying Asian girls walked through the door screeching, \"OMG, look at this place!\" What was there to look at? Dark, dingy Tiki wanna-be on Broadway. Good for a stop on your bar crawl, but not the way to end your night with!",

The drink did taste good though, and I thought it was strong enough, even though it's kind of a fruity drink.

She was confused and insisted I'd already paid, but he was persistent, so she complied. Later, she asked me if I'd paid, and we realized we'd been double-dipped.  The next time, I paid for a round at the bar, and a different bartender came over a bit later and asked for payment for the same round. I told him I'd already paid, and he said, \"You didn't pay ME.\" I said, no, of course not, I paid the other bartender. He said, \"Which one?\" The other bartender conveniently had ducked out of sight. I know he thought I was too drunk to argue and would be confused, but he was wrong. I finally caught sight of Bartender no. 1 and made him come over and verify I'd paid for the round. Bartender no. 2 frowned, shrugged and slunk away as if to say, \"Oh well, worth a try.\" No apology; nothing.

After one friend does, but needs to jet early, he has \u00dcber cab drop me in North Beach for one last hurrah before I head back to my hotel.

I sit down and I'm promptly served a potent cocktail and he easily engages in great conversation. He also so kindly allows me to charge my dying phone while I'm there.

As the night goes on, various dancers from the nearby slew of strip clubs come in and out either hunting for business or with their clients for the night to party. Everyone is very sweet...and plenty of drinks are served, all very potent...and now....  The Party:  Basically, everyone is feeling it, in a good way. Stripper, client, guys night out, business men, then me...the only non dancer girl. We are dancing, singing, hula hooping (yes it ended up being the center of attention...show stealer...hmmmph) laughing, vibing, and just having a GREAT time. A fiery volcano is purchased for me, and while I couldn't finish most of it, it was quite the treat and like the other cocktails before it, potent!   I partied like a brain damaged test monkey right up until close. Then the bartender and a local DJ ensured I was safe getting back to my hotel in Millbrae.   Bamboo Hut: It's cheap, it's dark, it's friendly, it's fun and the drinks are strong. Puuuurfect.   Now if only they could have cured my hangover on my flight the next day. Ugh...",

The hut has a long sordid history and I have seen most of it. Hell, I have been some of it!  First off, this place is fun. It's super cheesy so if you don't have a sense of humor go somewhere else. This place is made for cutting loose, having fun and letting go. Recently under new management by Nick (who kicks ass) and now Marshal (who also kicks ass), the place is undergoing another paradigm shift with new theme nights and a fresh attitude toward making it the place to be on Broadway. Frankly the rest of the once jumping street has basically gone to hell in a hand basket.   There's a new rocking happy hour, new drinks, always new people and generally a great time to be had. It's a get what you give kind of place so if you are an asshole expect to be treated accordingly (which I think should be true everywhere) but if you are there because you are looking to have fun then fun you will have.  And if you are a first timer, get the Volcano Bowl. Come on, just do it, you know you like to see drinks on fire!",

In short, the bamboo hut is an oasis in which the bartenders are friendly and do a good job of making sure everyone gets a drink.",

Location: Not my favorite location in San Francisco, the North Beach area. Don't drive here, you wont find parking. Straight people here are scary, scary, scary. Thank gawd there were lesbians and black people on the street to make me feel safer. There were also like 20 police on that block...weird, weird place. I felt like I was in a different world on that block.   Space: The place gives the illusion of being big due to the mirror walls, but it's tiny tiny tiny. The decor scares me, it's like polynesian, meets tolteca, meets pacific islander mix, with angolan finnishes haha.   Ambiance: The people were ugly, poorly dressed and couldn't dance for the life of them. My friends and I were awesome, though.  Service: Jesus, I asked for a dirty martini and she said, \"What's that?\" and then for a cosmopolitan and she said, \"I don't know how to make that.\" 'Nuff said. She was nice though.  Food/Drink: I couldn't have my dirty martini...but we all shared this super fun volcano drink. It was pretty yummy and had fire on it.  Overall: This is usually the kind of place I stay away from but my sister wanted to go here for her birthday. Hopefully this will be the only time I am forced here...I am traumatized.",

Sure you can find a floating wedding singer band at the Tonga Room, but Bamboo Hut RULES!!! The ambiance is warm and inviting, totally themed, and cozy, intimate yet not cramped,. There's even a special private room in the back for big private parties if you wanna get wild with your scorpian bowl drinks set afire!  I loooove the weekend bartender Lauren- sweet as pie, and willing to make and serve you your poison of choice- always smiling! I highly recommend their specialty tropical cocktails.   I go on Thursdays for the \"Night of the savage sounds\", where they have resident and featured DJ's spinning old school rock and roll, swing, surf, and blues. It's definitely one of the most comfortable no drama bars in North Beach, and is starting to become one of my favorite bars in the city - well especially on Thursdays!   It's hard to find a chill bar with a friendly atmosphere these days...Bamboo has all these things, and a uniqueness no other place has, from the staff, to the decor(where else are ya gonna see blowfish hanging from the ceiling and a 12 foot tiki??!), yummy fruity drinks, and awesome people that frequent the joint!",

The street traffic is ridiculous so theres never a shortage of strange travelers or locals coming in to spice it up.

While they can make you whatever tropical drink (blended or not) that your heart desires, you obviously cannot come here without opting for the volcano bowl. \u00a0Blended deliciousness (think daquiri meets pina colada) in a large specifically crafted ceramic bowl with room for lighter fluid (aka a very flammable liquor?) in the center to complete the full volcanic experience comes with many a long straw because you're going to want to share this bad boy. \u00a0  There's a \"Jukebox\" you can pay to play the song of your choice which works much better on a afternoon before the bar-hopping crowds arrive.",

Well this is the place to go before hitting any of the clubs along the red light district. The scorpion bowls are great for groups and will really get you going. The place isn't big but its good enough for small groups. The people here are very lively and have such a good time. They end up dancing and doing weird things since they don't realize how strong these drinks can be. Just a note don't try drinking a whole scorpion bowl by yourself. You'll wake up the next day asking yourself \"WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?!?!\". I'm just saying.... but ultimately its your choice. Don't come back and tell me like I didn't warn you!",

The simple fact that something is on fire is just enough reason for me to want to order one. Additionally, it's one of those places were there are no dress codes, attitudes and not a whole bunch of rules. Oh, and did I mention that you can sit for free?

Walnut Creek is far enough... about $100 away. \u00a0She laughs and is about to respond, but he returns from the restroom (you KNOW a guy like that doesn't wash his hands) so they again retire to the back of the room.\n  \"Dude\" I say to my friend, \"we need to take that guy out.\"\n \"I'm with you, but he's pretty big.\"\n \"No problem, I'll just hit him with this beer bottle.\"\n He looks closely at our soon-to-be victim...\n \"He's got a varsity wrestling jacket on... it might take two.\"\n \"How about this fire extinguisher?\"\n As I'm looking at the locking mechanism, trying to discover how to get it off the wall, they leave. \u00a0Ah well, it would have been pretty messy in here. \u00a0Kinda like fighting King Kong: \u00a0Hit him with the extinguisher, grab his girl and run like hell.\n  Once they left, I was able to see that a really great party was talking place all around me. \u00a0The perfect 10 was gone, but a room full of 9s ain't bad.\n My buddy latches onto a fine girl in a nano-mini. \u00a0They start getting close and I see her whisper into his ear. \u00a0He says something back and she gets even closer. \u00a0Nice work, my man! \u00a0Later, he comes by and tells me about the conversation:\n \"I have something to tell you, but I don't know how\"\n \"It's cool, just go ahead an say it\"\n \"Well, it's just that I'm... I mean I like.... I'm a lesbian.\"\n \"Hmmm. \u00a0That's cool.\"\n  The fact that this knowledge did not slow him down for a minute turned her on even more. \u00a0Every time I looked over, his hands were places polite society will not let me mention in this post.\n  Oh yeah... this is supposed to be a review of the bar. \u00a0Good service, friendly staff. \u00a0Bouncers are not pricks when it's time to clear the place at the end of the night. \u00a0I'll be back.",

I walked out and asked the bouncer if he had noticed anyone walk off with it, wholly expecting a nope, already cursing myself for letting it out of sight... and the guy says yeah, I did. Not just that, he knew the guy. He went in to the bartender and they dug up his number (apparently he was a regular). Couldn't get a hold of him, so they gave me the manager's card. The manager Mario followed up, called me the next day, said he had called the guy too, and he was going to text me when he had my backpack back. And he did. I came by and collected it the next day. And Mario apologized for any inconvenience to me! This was on a Friday night. This place was hopping, busy, lots of drinks flowing. The bouncer, bartender, manager didn't have to help out... but they did. They went out of their way to help me, and I was a first-time customer there. I'm definitely going back - if only to patronize a place that cares!!!",

The party didn't stop there, we did the Limbo and practiced the Mashed Potato...we also 'dropped it like it was hot' even though some of us couldn't get back up again.  Mixologist Mustachio was like the cool parent. Keeping us respectfully imbibed with refreshing island beverages that almost made me forget I was still in my Hood and not in Maui.

I was expecting a dumpy dive, but this is actually a nice bar with clean bathrooms! There is a lot of seating, and comfy booths. The bartender was very friendly and my 3 friends and I got a good buzz going from 2 of the $12 happy hour volcano bowls. I should note, I once went to the Tonga room and was disappointed to find this supposed \"institution\" had NOT ONE flaming drink, the hallmark of a good tiki bar. So, Bamboo Hut delivers! To the people griping about the crowd, what do you expect in North Beach? Go on a weeknight after work and it won't resemble Jersey Shore.",

(stop reading now if you're eating. i'm serious.) it wasn't his drink that he splashed on me. instead, he yakked all over my shoulder and my arm and my back and my leg. yum, indeed. i stood in my spot for at least five seconds, shocked and disgusted and dumbfounded as to whether to punch the oaf in the face or hose myself off. luckily, one of my friends whisked me to the restroom in the back and helped clean off as much as possible.  and by the time we were done cleaning, all our friends had headed over to another nearby bar. and by then, the oaf was stumbling over himself on the sidewalk, so good thing bamboo hut didn't let him stay inside.  i tried to be a trooper, but it just didn't work. nobody wanted to dance with the girl who smelled like vomit. so it was time to call it a night. fun!",

    "review_text": "I invited a grip of friends to the Bamboo Hut on a Saturday night to take advantage of their yelp drink specials.  I mean, how could I say no to a $10 Volcano Bowl??  Tiki bars are my favorite, but they do tend to burn through your wallet rather quickly.  So my friends and I stayed for an hour or so enjoying volcano bowls. They offer pineapple and strawberry, with the latter being my preference.  All was going well initially. We got there at 7 (even though their door says 8?), and there was seating everywhere. There was about 10 of us, so we grabbed the bench seating in the back.  Loved the bowls, but I did not love the Bamboo Breeze cocktail. It was not at all what I expected. I'm not even sure if I got what was intended. I thought it would be blended, but it was essentially tequila on the rocks. No bueno.   What would have been a 4 star experience became a 2 star experience when the bartender (who we had been generously tipping since the bowls were so cheap) came over after only a little over an hour to tell us a group called in and reserved the table we were sitting at, and that we had to move when they got there.  WTF? The whole reason I had my group of friends get there at 7 was to guarantee we'd have a great spot for an evening of Tiki drinks. Why didn't he at least give us a heads when we sat down? Seems completely bogus to me.  I have never heard of a bar doing this before, and I was and still am very skeptical. Maybe if their website had a speck of information on it, I could find out if he wasn't full of it.   So 9:40 hit, and some random dude came over cleaning up all of our glasses making it very obvious we couldn't sit there anymore. Rude.  The crowd also became very thuggish and douchey after 9:00 (yes, even for North Beach). Every one of my friends (and myself included) who used the restroom at one point were hassled in some way, either face-to-face or by people randomly banging on the bathroom door. Perhaps they needed to lay off the booger sugar. One-toilet bathrooms weren't designed for group activities!  Due to this, I will not be returning to Bamboo Hut. It was all fine and dandy with the yelp prices and the early crowd, but after 9pm it was witching hour and the bar had completely changed its tune. No thanks.  Should I even mention how juvenile the music was? I'm talking middle school dance. \u00a0Terrible.  I'll be sticking to Smuggler's Cove, Tonga Room, and Trader Sam's. Some common respect is worth the extra cash.",

All decent bars if you like the tiki thing. All serve sweet drinks with umbrellas. Some have bad music, some have good music, some I just cant seem to remember the music.   This particular tiki bar is small and a bit divey. It is more Hanalei than Honolulu. It neither falls into the bad nor good music category because it varies depending on the night. It definitely falls into the hangover category. The drinks here are just as likely to make you puke as all of the other tiki places that serve you what essentially amounts to alcoholic kool aid.   It's sort of amazing, all of these drinking establishments with a tiki theme. Maybe I am not actually in NorCal. Maybe I have had one too many Hurricanes or Scorpion Bowls in my time and actually stumbled all the way to the Islands.   I do seem to recall that the Bamboo Hut IS the temperature and humidity of the tropics when its crowded, which it is on the weekends, typical North Beach style (the reason for the lower rating).

It's on the \"colorful\" border of North Beach. 3. Giant flaming bowls of delicious booze.  At Bamboo Hut, your order can literally be: One blended drink in that bowl, on fire, and delicious. \u00a0It is so, so great. \u00a0Also, inside tip, string 3 straws together so that you don't have to lean in to drink  The downside: not much of an ambiance. \u00a0However, the locale is ideal for pre- or post-partying.  Summary: Giant, flaming bowls of delicious boozeness that are great for sharing. \u00a0Pray to the tiki god.",

The Bamboo Hut is a place that I would hang out at even if I did not work there. \u00a0What makes the Hut so special are those casts of characters we call regulars. We have had a lot of fun whooping it up at the Hut. Every weekend our DJ's will get you to dance and sing along to the hits of the 80's and 90's. Every third Thursday is Rockin Like Dokken a night devoted to 80's rock and metal. There is also a ridiculously great happy hour every Thursday and Friday (5pm-8pm) with half priced Tiki Drinks and $3.00 Red Stripes. \u00a0Make sure to have your next party at the Bamboo Hut. We specialize in private parties as well as accommodating large groups. \u00a0Next time you find yourself in Northbeach make sure to drop by the Hut! Ma halo!",

Bamboo Hut started off what ended up being a very eventful Friday night. Just a small group of us left the office with the intention of doing a low key Chinatown/North Beach Bar Crawl - and if that's what your plan is, probably shouldn't start of the night with rum drinks. Lesson learned there, folks!   But I digress. We walked into to Bamboo Hut around 6 pm and it was relatively empty. Which I found surprising since the drinks here during happy hour are so cheap. Three of us split the giant volcano bowl and another two split the pina colada. Both were generous with the booze, yet didn't taste like rubbing alcohol. Maybe this is more of a late night spot? Regardless, we had a blast. Love a good Tiki bar and this bar is no exception. Can't wait to go back with friends and share in some more drinking delights!",

That's probably because I'm so charming, but I would guess at least some of you are also.  Seriously though, as a jumping off point for a group friends hitting the town hard, flaming booze in the back room is hard to beat. Among a group of cynical bon vivants, everyone managed to have a good time.

Not as impressive, however, was their cleanliness. Although there was ample table space to choose from, and even an open private area in the back that could easily fit 10 people, the moment I sat I felt something sticky on my derriere. Apparently their bench wasn't clean. It left a slimy, sticky film on my jeans. I walked into the bathroom to clean myself off a bit, only to find the sink falling apart.  Cleanliness aside, the bartender was very friendly. Drinks were served pretty fast and kind words and jokes were shared.  Bottom Line: Would I come back? Sure. For a quick $3 shot, no problem.

Both delicious and deceptively tasty but quite strong.  Shooters: I had something with razzberry rum, OJ, and cranberry, and he had the shark attack. Shooters is a very innocent word for what were essentially scotch glasses filled with shooter drinks. Gigantic and tasty! The place itself was not too crowded and lively, it was early in the evening still.   My only issue was with the fact that the bartender partook in one helluva fucked up conversation with the girls next to us that made me really wanna spit in his face and call him a fuckass, but since he nice to us and probably didn't realize that he came off as an antisemitic douchebag I just hated him on the inside instead.

The eclectic selection of music played way too loudly makes conversation here impossible, and the random oldies ballads inserted at inopportune intervals discourage any dancing from taking place.

That bartender better pray he never runs into me again, just as I pray I'll never run into Bamboo Hut again.",

    "review_text": "Cool decor, AWESOME bartenders! Especially the ones who helped me recover my iPhone! God! Thought that thing had bit the bust for the final time. Been here a couple times, since I used to work across the street, and even a couple times after. The first time was to see Thee Swank Bastards, and I think the second and third times it was to see them as well. The last time I went, or rather, the time right before the last time, I was hammered beyond a reasonable doubt, hustling some poor fellow for whiskey shots. Somewhere in the midst of the night I misplaced my phone, and called them the next morning (after I cried my eyes out and threw a temper tantrum upon realization) and left a message, hoping some kind soul MIGHT have turned it in... but it's reality, right? I wasn't expecting SHIT. That shit was GONE. I was already about to roll my pennies and call AT&amp;T about a new one. Well I called, left a message, and they called me back... Chris it was, I believe. I go in and recover it... a cute punk-ISH looking chick named Mimi was working behind the bar and she gave me back my phone and I decided to stay and have a couple vodka sodas and relinquish the night. We shoot the shit, smoke cigs and sample delicious mixed shots that tasted like fruit rollups. Very comfortable, easy going place with seemingly easy going people. 4 stars because it is out in North Beach which is going to limit my going there to 0-2x \u00a0a month, probably. Haha.",

How to attain one, however, was my challenge of the evening.  Not having breasts to flaunt or the burly or jock persona necessary to buddy it up with our bartender in testosterone backed camaraderie, this skinny fag had to enlist the attention grabbing tatas of one of his hags to lure our bartender over to fan the flames of my faggotry with none other than a flaming booze volcano.  Once we had drink in hand, the night was pretty good. \u00a0Our DJ of the night, aside from ignoring requests, played fairly decent music. \u00a0The floor was like a giant sand box and they gave us free flip-flops, which made for some interesting times. \u00a0A few volcano bowls later we danced across the sand and made our grand exit.  It all worked out in the end: recalling the carnal look of the bartender as he objectified my friend was just what I needed to enduce the at home vomiting spree that saved me from what could have been a hangover most murderous!  Next time though, I think I'll stick to Trader Sams for my tiki bar bowl of ice blended booze needs.",

    "review_text": "There are some tiki bars you go for the ambiance such as the Tonga Room. \u00a0Some you go to for the sheer perfection of their cocktail making like Smuggler's Cove ( I know it's more pirate ship but tiki bar but the drinks are the key ) Some however fall in a whole other category I'd like to call people watching. \u00a0At no other tiki bar in the bay area this is king more than at the Bamboo Hut. \u00a0First off the place doesn't have much to the design. \u00a0There's some of the typical kitschy tiki bar stuff but nothing to write home about. \u00a0The drinks are tasty and strong and probably the best value of the ones I've been to. The staff is friendly and quick. The patrons however...  It's a crap shoot every night. \u00a0It's that people watching game of craps that keeps me coming back for more. \u00a0I love the location in the heart of Broadway in North Beach. \u00a0It's always been a sanctuary for me when I duck and dodge all the people attempting to lure me into their strip joints as I walk down the main drag. \u00a0This sanctuary has always been the best value entertainment on Broadway as it is get this.... free entrance. \u00a0The bevy of personalities that have the potential of walking in is astounding. From short people with canes dressed in Smooth Criminal outfits to Russian Gangsters chatting with Peruvian surfers is just the tip of the iceberg when trying to describe who you might end up chatting with. \u00a0In many cases if you were to run into any of these people in the street you might find yourself trying to avoid them but at Bamboo Hut you are forced through the powers of alcohol and close proximation to each other to commiserate. \u00a0For some magical reason all the fears people have of stereotypes disappear when walking through the doors of the Bamboo Hut.  So my personal review is I love Bamboo Hut but it certainly isn't for everyone because it has such a unique feel to most other tiki bars. \u00a0Imagine if Mr. Bings and Kona Club had a baby the Bamboo hut would be it's love child.",

We went during the niners playoff game so every bar was packed with niners fan cheering on kapernick, while the three of us were drinking till no tomorrow (unfortunately tomorrow came and it wasn't so pretty) but we had a blast regardless. :) Has an awesome mai-tai like drink with barcadi 151 flamining in the middle.

I went Jersey Shore themed, and the GM was more than happy to help me theme the bar after the JS--we developed a themed drink menu, there were cast photos on the bar...it was great. The only requirement was that we meet a $600 bar tab for renting the entire place from 7-10 on a Saturday night (which we did, ahem, handily)--I couldn't have asked for a better venue!   I have to deduct one star for the fact that the bouncer started letting streams of people in at 9:30, when I had reserved the place until 10.
