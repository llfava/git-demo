    "review_text": "Great little bar in the Mission with a super hip vibe. Just revisited to try their new record album menu (I've previously been when they had the pantone menu) and tried the following cocktails:  Linda Ronstadt (Hanger One, Lillet Rose, Meletti, Galliano, watermelon, lime). My personal favorite of the night. Best way to describe it is simply \"fresh.\" Not at all too sweet -- just perfection.  The Bankrobber (Wild Turkey Rye, Ferrand Cognac, Becherovka, blackberry, Bonal Quina, bitters). I was pleasantly surprised by this one because it sounded a bit intimidating, but was delicious. (We decided Trick Dog must just specialize in purple drinks.)  Mr. Big Stuff (Calle 23 Reposado Tequila, Gran Classico bitter, coconut, bay laurel, lime). Served in an adorable pineapple glass, super strong, unique, a bit smokey, and yummy.  That's All Right (Suze, Orgeat, Denizen Rum, Lime). Smells fantastically herbal, tastes nice, but has a very strong bitter aftertaste (much more so than the other drinks)  They won't make anything from the old menu anymore, so forget about the beet juice, but their new drinks are great, too, so don't worry. I'm guessing every single thing you could order would be fantastic!",

We decided to check it out and to our pleasant surprise it was this amazing bar. We enjoyed ourselves immensely. The cocktails are phenomenal, the bartenders really know what they're doing. We have yet to try the food out but we will definitely be back to try this out. The only reason why it lacks 1 star is the lack of seating, which they could easily add a few stools, as well as a bouncer standing out front the second time we went making people wait even though the inside was not even full. I was a bit confused by that but am still going to go back.",

It seems that most people just go for the bar on the first floor, but they're missing out on so many great food possibilities.   For food, highly recommend: - the kale salad (enormous, with slow-cooked egg yolk dressing, avocados, and parmesan; sooo tasty!!! a great starter if you're hungry) - the thrice-cooked fries - get this Manimal style!!! So good! - the duck egg (they've replaced the scotch egg with this; rich and delish) - the trick dog  As for drinks, we loved: - the Mission Dolores (rum-based) - the Alcatraz (a bourbon cocktail)  Service is a bit slow though - so don't come here if you're in a rush, or a big group - the tables are all for 2-4 people; and the upstairs where they serve sit-down meals is quite small.",

The doorman, a caricature of aspirational attitude, seemed to think he was doing everyone a favor by letting them in. Inside, you have the privilege of paying for a 15 minute wait for two drinks, which is not cool or cute or skilful mixology, just lame bar management. We put our name down for a table and were told it would be 45 mins; when I had the nerve to tell the waitress we'd pass on the table after the rest of our dinner party were left waiting on the street because the door guy had stopped letting people in, the waitress glared and said I needed to learn patience. When we finally got a table, the food was average diner cooking at best, styled as something more interesting than it is, and served under temperature.  Oh and did I mention the place has no sign so you'd better know the street number. So groundbreaking. So hot right now.   The only upside? The drinks are incredibly well made, and the sheer ridiculousness of the experience makes good dinner conversation. One star for the delicious Libra cocktail, another for the waiter who reminded us of Zach Galifianakis. But for the hassle and appalling attitude, this bar is all style, no substance and no service.

My friend and I opted for the overly-intimate upstairs dining level because commotion ruins my appetite. Speaking of appetite:  - cocktails: well-balanced and not too heavy on the mixers, as it should be - Kale Salad: I can say this is the best kale salad I ever had. It was just well-chopped, well topped and well-dressed from beginning to end. A great chew even for kale. - Manimal Style Fries: It started out great - ultra crisp potato job with good stuff on top, but I soon discovered the ratio was a little off and then it became a salty bowl of fries, possibly because we paired it with... - Crispy Duck Egg: A wonderful deep-fried egg surrounded by a sea of... oversalted beans. Maybe its the beans or maybe its the chorizo, but something about it made it unbearable for my salt sensors. It just made for an unsettling appetizer in my book. It's a shame because that egg had so much potential.  Would I come here again? Yes, because I think I'll forgive salty beans one day and try other things on the menu. Plus I'd definitely want to see kale salad again. Until then, this place will be just okay for me until further notice.",

    "review_text": "Who says you can't teach a new dog old tricks?  I tend to set a bar with a place based on how well they mix up a whiskey sour. Why? Because almost any bar/lounge/restaurant you will ever find yourself will carry the ingredients to make said cocktail. And though, decisively simple in nature, if you can mix up a sour that stands out from the crowd - bonus points &amp; a tip of the hat to you. But if you hand me a sour without the egg white... well... i've already decided on the kind of place i've landed in.  Plus, from many MANY test drives on this first impression theory, i've found that with the whiskey sour, a great bartender will always have a twist on it which gets the personality of service staff across pretty darn quick. \u00a0For example: \"Do you want a whiskey sour? Or would you like a vanilla bean, camomile &amp; Jamesons sour? I call it The Unicorn.\" ... excuse me while I climb over the bar to bear hug you...  So did Trick Dog pass the test? They were ROCKIN busy the night we went in (well done for a Wednesday) and though there were no fun twists on the original, the sour I started off with came out in beautiful glassware and balanced just perfectly. One of those sours that you can down FAR too quickly and yet, are sorry when it's over. I kept having to remind myself I was with co-workers and not to get carried away. (pppffttt)  The bar list was obviously well thought out and the \"research related\" sips I stole from my cocktail buddies proved that the minds behind these mixes know what they're doing. Everything was pleasantly boozy, without being too harsh. A nice balance and throw back to my well loved classics.  The ambiance is nice - though I wish I had the sense to check out the space upstairs. But I would have much preferred it on a slower evening where I could curl into the bar. Getting bumped into every 3 seconds whilst holding a $12 doesn't really jive well with me.  However, I could curl into those bar seats just about any day. And though we were only in for a quickie, I peeked Yamazaki behind the bar, which happens to be my new favourite whiskey and a pain in the butt to get in Vancouver, so I wager I could have spent a grand deal of time here if scheduling served.  The post-manager in me is screaming to make note of the menus - which were printed as Pantone swatches. Nice touch guys.  All in all? I'd be back. This is a solid cocktail haunt and worth the stop in.",

The decor is enchanted with funky brassy lamp holders, candles and pictures which just work. The staff is attentive and sweet and if there is something not on the drink menu \u00a0which is funky in itself because the drinks are in a book made out if old small vinyl records and the baby turtle was not available but I was offered something similar that the mixologist was willing to make it for me which u declined, \u00a0I asked for them to use Polish vodka which I was super surprised that they had - luksusowa, mint and asked for the drink to be little sweet and they made a yummy drink which was bubbly....A for effort for sure, very small drink that Polish myself would need to order many of.  Lets get to the yummy stuff...food! The shrimp cocktail which included 4 shrimp total for $12 so you do the math was incredible, each of these shrimp was cooked to perfection and the horseradish sauce was such a nice compliment. The three slices of green fried tomatoes for $6 were bland and needed some seasoning on them, they were presented with a source but slobs they were just too plain. \u00a0The trick dog was a hot dog sandwich which I guess makes sense but since I was tired I was surprised that it was a \" sandwich\" but when I took a bite, I was over powered by bread so I took the bread off and the beef was incredible!

While we didn't order much in the way of food, I can absolutely vouch for the ginormous kale salad. \u00a0At $9, it's a gargantuan pile of crazy nutrient-dense awesome tossed in an exceptionally balanced egg yolk dressing. \u00a0Easily shareable between two people even for someone with my appetite!  What really rounded out our experience though was the wonderful service. \u00a0With the crowd growing by the minute as the night went on, one of the staff came by to politely ask if my friend and I could move downstairs and free up our table. \u00a0I was happy to oblige, but not before she apologized profusely and offered a round of cocktails on the house for us. \u00a0Truly above and beyond service that left a lasting impression on me. \u00a0Couldn't recommend this place more, just know that it's crackin' on prime nights!",

First I had a Mission Shipwrecked IPA, which is actually from San Diego. It was a solid IPA but at 9+%, I wasn't going to have too many of those. I switched to a Biere de Chocolat by SF's own Almanac Brewery. Those were pretty sweet and tasty. I was expecting to pay $8-$10 per beer being in SF, but they were actually only $6-$7 apiece.  We also sampled some appetizers: the pork cracklins ($6) were deliciously crispy and not too greasy. Also had some fries and the pickle board, which was good even though I don't really like pickles so it must be good.

The verdict: HOLY YUM! In order of favorites, the cauliflower was the winner - that brown butter puree ladled on top is simply sinly - but the kale salad was a seriously close second (what with the unique egg yolk dressing, ample avocado and pepitos, and good-quality parmesan, it ain't no ordinary salad, that's for sure). We were too full for dessert, unfortunately, but I suppose that could also be a good sign that there food is fabulous. Oh, hold on, I can't forget to mention the rice plate: This dish was actually a nice sunrise; I was expecting your run-of-the-mill fried rice, but this rice was super special.. It came in the shape of a small brick, and it was super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I like a good yin-yang like that ;-) On top of the good food, I recommend Trick Dog for it's ambiance: the loft-style windows in the upstairs dining area are awesome, and they play legit music.   Side note: If you go to Trick Dog before 7pm, pop into the Salumeria deli and larder next door: they have some fabulous, upscale food to buy, and my adorable friend, Maddie, works there, so shoot her a smile!.",

I just have no tolerance for the line in the street.\" One minute later: We have to wait in line to enter Trick Dog. On the street, in the freezing cold. I try to convince my friend to go elsewhere but he really pushes to stay the course.  We were rewarded with a better-than-expected experience once inside the loud and overpacked place.  This is absolutely in my top 2 favorite places to drink right now, and they couldn't have nailed it better with these amazing, creative, well-thought-out cocktails. The small accompanying bar menu is impressive and perfect if you are not vegetarian. If you are vegetarian you probably crave another option or two. I personally covet that kale salad and hope it stays. I did venture to taste my friend's brussels sprouts (with bacon and sunchoke chips) and they were freaking amazing. Crispy and flavorful. A bacon-free option would be great to see. Thoroughly unimpressed with the mushroom hummus.  But oh, back to the cocktails! Worked through these, listed in descending order of preference: St. Elmo's Fire, Gypsy Tan, Straw Hat, Pennies from Heaven, Witchwood. ALL were well-balanced and delicious. I haven't tried the popular Baby Turtle yet. The green chartreuse/chocolate soda hiball is something...to experience. Kind of creepy, yet also delicious...like that weird ex you stayed with too long.  So why not 5 stars? See above. Street line. Often. Also the music is too loud. I feel sorry for the neighbors. And the service is a wee lacking, in that it can take multiple requests for water or a check before it shows. But it's friendly. They'll be seeing a lot of me.",

Apparently the place is known for their craft drinks and they were all good and all but it takes about 5 minutes for each drink to be made. Their beer selection is a little scarce and there is a severe lack of space to rest your drink.

The drinks are great, and where trick dog stands out the most, making better than average use of spices and the occasional savory element in cocktails. Yet in San Francisco there are already many places where drinks of such high quality are served.  The nibbles I had were just fine: the charcuterie plate was nice, but its \"twist\" was dill pickle gel\u00e9e. That's a fancy way of saying dill pickle jelly. It tasted like dill pickle jelly. But that aside, it was a standard issue charcuterie plate. The fried brussels sprouts are fine, but I've had that same execution (with crispy sunchokes and bacon) elsewhere.   As far as decor, Trick Dog features most of the standard modern design cues: Edison bulbs, cement floors, as well as exposed wood and structural elements. But I do like how it has mezzanine seating.  There seems to be a lot of hype surrounding this place, at least early on, as all the seats were full at 8:30pm on a Sunday.  Indeed, a trick dog. But this dog was born old and the tricks it has been taught aren't all that new either.",

    "review_text": "When my friends and I hit up Trick Dog for dinner, we tried almost everything on the menu. I really liked everything, but there were a few real standouts. My hands down favorite thing was the Kale salad, and by the sheer volume of them flowing out of the kitchen, a lot of folks out there agree. Part of its' wonderfulness is its' simplicity. This one has \u00a0avocado, parmesan, pepitos, and a slow-cooked egg yolk dressing. Yum Their version of a Scotch egg was pretty fabulous too. It came with the requisite soft-boiled egg, but instead of the typical sausage wrapping, they chose to go with a brandade (an emulsion of salt cod and olive oil) wrapping. The fish tasted like fish sticks (in a good way) and made me think of breakfasts as a kid. If I HAD been at home, that would have mean it would be paired with a warm Winchell's jelly doughnut, but I was at Trick Dog, so I had to make due with purple potato salad and romesco sauce. My third favorite was the Fig Tartine. It had Kadota figs, housemade ricotta, and pinenut brittle (!!!) with a verjus and lime vinaigrette. It was delicate and super fresh. We didn't try the burger or fish tacos, both of which looked intriguing. I think they may be on the docket for a future visit.   All the cocktails are interesting. I could only have one, so I opted to go the rye route and have a Fugazi Bank. It's not for the faint of heart, but it's a nicely balanced tipple. My friend's Cliff House was lovely, even though I was wishing for more chocolate. The atmosphere is no frills, but there is a chance for some good people watching. Service was fine. I kind of wish they took reservations, but won't complain too much about it because people (me included) can be flighty and the seating area is pretty cozy. You might get lucky, but don't be too surprised if you have to wait a bit. Definitely recommended!",

Good drinks (even the egg white one) and a fantastic atmosphere. I love the industrial design. At some point we went out to smoke, and had a lovely chat with the doorman. Despite other reviews, he was very nice and did not give us any issues coming in and out. The bar area is small and was crowded as expected on a Saturday night, but we still enjoyed it. Downside of this place is they are cool and they know it. The bartender was excellent at preparing our drinks, but was visibly annoyed when we did not order them according to their \"album name.\" Now about those albums..... Apparently Trick Dog is known for their creative ways of presenting the menu and we were there during the time that the menu was a book of 45's. This seriously sucked for a couple of reasons. It's pretty dark in there. Very hard to read the labels on a 45 in the dark. Song titles on a 45 are small, now make them a title plus recipe. Impossible. Then the albums kept falling out when you tried to turn the page. Very glad to hear they have since come up with a new menu design. Overall, Trick Dog has good drinks (although pricey) and great ambiance which is what one looks for in a bar. However, I must remove a star for pretentiousness. Being a cool bar does not mean you should give the customers attitude and a difficult menu. Get over yourself and just be great.",

Yes I was eyeballing those mountains of kale salad and coveting those oozing scotch eggs the entire time.

It was clearly hopeless: once people are sitting at the bar, there's no way they're going to leave until they're through with dinner and several drinks.

Despite my determination and relative lack of courtesy to others, it still took 30 minutes to place an order, and the realization of that order recapitulated the first moratorium on intoxication. I could never come back here again sober.",

    "review_text": "Trick Dog is a good bridge between bars and lounges. It was filled on a Tuesday night (the weekends must be packed!) so go weeknights if you could. If you don't go to lounges often, this venue is not so fancy or so nice that you would feel out of place. However, like at many lounges and speakeasy-themed venues, the drinks are very good - skillfully made with top-shelf quality ingredients. Of the drinks I tried, favorites are in order by ingredients:  Pantone 7621 (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FFK3LjBaxVo3ciA_FGXCPtA%2Fl.jpg&amp;s=22de1fbe9df81bc0760ceb9c02c863dfe0166e8f316ddb017d52d1a8abe504ff\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026</a>); good kick &amp; didn't overwhelm foods. Straw Hat (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2Fk86HN7TyT6B9tyobLdcAfg%2Fl.jpg&amp;s=bb2ebdb34355e37995ad63458f395857a21d749b1f8c5981ad32e6a463ff82c2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026</a>); a second drink since many ingredients. Paper Moon (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FFRBf7VF772HA5YbHyAbZuA%2Fl.jpg&amp;s=7bee2367818e1828dc826074149e64e0fcb7c6ad183fd0a5a9512d51aac6933f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026</a>); good and strong evening starter. Baby Turtle (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FF7sn1kEkMZAutqK4YNUR1g%2Fl.jpg&amp;s=69249877a23c766ad33a485a5ae7e6f4c9ad4ddb4836693fcd9a95be2112b29e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026</a>); good in-between drink.  - a special nod to Lion Heart as it was just strong enough when I started the night (would recommend the Paper Moon instead if on an empty stomach). Alligator Alley and Vintage Photo were very nice as well, but alas I never did get the pics, hah!  The entire venue set-up resembled a loft, albeit loud and you will have to raise your voices to be heard. Downstairs is the bar like most places but it's not divy nor dim. Upstairs is the sit-down-dine area which is pretty nice for a bar (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2F-YHdwA8DvGPHKe0NHZ4azw%2Fl.jpg&amp;s=261e19a2c85f96954a8b280b6eff139e43cf36345841401af6895496f8c0d67d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026</a>). The eats were fancified bar food and really good though don't look for dinner-size portions. However, smaller plates works as they're better priced and allow for more food tastings.  Since everything was fresh, like the citrus peels, there were leftovers on the side (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=FK3LjBaxVo3ciA_FGXCPtA#ik4pjJjNQiv1bCPPZoWAOw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a>). This was on the way to the restroom down the hall, shared with the restaurant Central Kitchen. Parking may be tough in the area, and it is a walk from any of the BART/Muni stations.",

    "review_text": "I've been eagerly waiting for this bar to open since hearing about it over a year ago. Dropped in on opening night and immediately felt like I'd been here all my life. The ambiance of the place is reminiscent of times past where welcoming one with gracious warmth and hospitality was the standard. The lighting was perfect and the funk they were playing was catchy and smooth. It's obvious these boys did their homework and knew exactly what they wanted you to feel. The place was filling up fast so my friend and I stepped over to the bar and took a look at the drink menu. Now when I first saw the menu on the bar I though for sure it was a paint matching deck that one of the painters had absentmindedly left behind. And when I commented to my friend as such she said, no I believe that's the drink menu. Upon further inspection I realized that indeed it was the drink menu. Wow, the Bon Vivants really went outside the box with this one. But I shouldn't expect less from these guys. The menu was great being made to be a Pantone swatch book with one cocktail per page. Being a lover of the agave I opted for the \"Baby Turtle\" first with is Tequila Ocho (one of my faves), Campari, grapefruit, cinnamon and lime. My friend had the Paper Moon made with Hangar 1 Vodka (another fave) some house made concoction and lime. We watched the bartender craft each cocktail in these really cool looking industrial beakers. He seemed to know exactly what he was doing and although very busy was acknowledging everyone with a smile and a greeting. It seemed there were a few \"industry folks\" in there despite the early hour. Maybe it's a Monday thing and the pros are off work. Anyways he served us our cocktails in some very cool looking glassware and lo and behold the drinks were delicious. The Bay Turtle was balanced with equal bitterness and that fruity agave taste that I crave. My friend was equally blown away with the Paper Moon. We switched cocktails and both agreed they were delicious. I could have finished hers but I wanted my agave back. We decided to get a bite since neither of us were going to be leaving for a while so after perusing the menu (seems like a good selection of bar food that would not be out of place in any high end restaurant). I spied the Scotch Egg and the Sweetie McNuggets and knew I had to try them both. Oh My god I wasn't disappointed. Now I haven't seen a Scotch Egg on a menu in a very long time and I've probably only had one once in my life and if you don't know what it is, Google it. The way Trick Dog does it is a semi hard boiled egg (yolk is still slightly runny) wrapped in Brandade and fried. SERIOUSLY NOW. Amazing. I want to get two with some bread and make the mother of all sandwiches. But that's just me. And the Sweetie McNuggets are deep fried breaded sweetbreads. Once again BLOWN AWAY. Since we were doing so much fried food and the diet had completely gone out the door we decided to go healthy and ordered the Kale salad to balance it out. That too was delicious with bits of avocado and grated cheese and just perfectly dressed. I could've had two of everything. At this point things were starting to get very busy and we were getting buzzed having also tried Grandma's Sweater and a Polar Bear. Both of which were stellar gin and mescal cocktails respectively also expertly made. After having a few shots of tequila things started to get fuzzy so we paid our bill, thanked our bartender and started to head towards the door. At least 4 members of the staff said good bye and thanked us on our way out once again showing that warmth and hospitality feeling I had spoken about earlier. What a breath of fresh air this place is. I went back on Thursday and had a similar experience. I'll be back again soon to try out some of the other dishes and cocktails. I'll keep you posted. Thank you Trick Dog.",

As I hinted, we were obviously outliers in a wicked local crowd, but all good and won't be outsiders next visit, trust me. Bartender even gave great recommendation on what whiskey bar we should hop to next, as one in our party (me) had a craving.

As you walk closer and closer it reminds me of New York City streets with each neighborhood being better than the last. You'll pass old favorites like Comstock and Schmidt's before you'll hit this new favorite.  Once inside you've definitely been transported into another city.

    "review_text": "For some reason, when I entered the front door of Trick Dog, I felt like I was walking onto the set of a reality TV show where a lot of twenty-somethings were trying to get as drunk as possible just to irritate the hell out of me. I had heard about the bar scene here, so it was with trepidation that I greeted my colleague Robbie's suggestion that a group of us come here for a late night dinner. It shares the same warehouse-style building that houses Central Kitchen, which I felt was a marginally disappointing dining destination when Jamie W. and I went there a couple of years ago. So it was onward and upward as the four of us squeezed through the hipsterati (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uGdqhj&amp;s=53e86a0fb0228de365482b55bb31ad08f6b71359d08e2887303a6ba8d1b4c770\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1uGdqhj</a>).  We finally made our way to the comparatively becalming upstairs section where people actually dine (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1zQ8Xhr&amp;s=2a024e2e5dca00f8fbe5a813e25a544e01610356da3de4dd44f273fa3aa6b034\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1zQ8Xhr</a>). Even though the noise level was still pretty high, at least the space gave us a reprieve from all the shoulder jostling that could have occurred down below. The menu turned out to be a nice selection of interesting plates (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F16lhQoJ&amp;s=f4713f438dfb0add5969a4885bf32f2505942c5a3229f2020373f57a3c97e443\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/16lhQoJ</a>), but first I needed some libation. The $10 Low Proof section of the menu was good enough for me, so I ordered the Necklace of Lights, a nice tall one with Manzanilla sherry, aquavit, peach, lemon and soda (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1BKkeST&amp;s=3b4516ff7d7a14689a4af42baee32adc5d6f4db9afcaab29714fe40654a78951\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1BKkeST</a>). Refreshing for 11PM and it relaxed me from the stress brought on by the crowds. We shared plates since I was among colleagues who are friends as well.  There was a predictable start with the $7 Guacamole mixed with sweet corn and accompanied by a pile of Mission tortilla chips that needed to be replenished (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1w5KC6z&amp;s=d6b638ee6579f0426626db7e6781675a4008bc04834922491d80a1d1e22ec26d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1w5KC6z</a>). No complaints from me as the fresh avocado just whet our appetites for more. Then came two orders of their Thrice-Cooked Fries, which were Kennebec potatoes that were boiled and fried twice - one naked ($5 - photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1BKldlW&amp;s=c603185eb91fd8f01bf927343e2efc7ff6ce19a383bac6bdd60df72cab1e3718\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1BKldlW</a>) and the other Manimal style with chow chow sauce and ketchup ($7 - photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1BB8DTf&amp;s=268bb873f0b004ff47549f7a573affdbd31d49c4b76527ff4ecb082da70a4d50\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1BB8DTf</a>). Very satisfying for fries. More adventurous choices came next first with the $11 Crispy Duck Egg, tasty and savory as it came deep-fried atop cranberry beans, chorizo, Cojita cheese and epazote salsa verde (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1wuYjKU&amp;s=1574bb2cdd7b414ed5225c37f93b8460b98d7cd4b4b8e1ddebb5d16eba1d438b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1wuYjKU</a>). I have to say the evening's winning dish came in the form of the $9 Kale Salad.  It was piled high on a plate with chopped greens with a creamy egg-based dressing, chunks of avocado, toasted pumpkin seeds and Parmesan cheese (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1spLxik&amp;s=b76df1cff0f8da98a069d5fa06c3357fe19b513ee63bb3e40c0f728f96a44778\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1spLxik</a>). The $11 Tomato Salad was overshadowed even though the Early Girl and Sungold tomatoes lent a welcome freshness complemented by the burrata, basil seeds and bread crumbs (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1A7vN2D&amp;s=ef2ee3d929846bb6705f98b5cd9fc4a7871e446dbdcefa5c8d931d8b1f897fab\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1A7vN2D</a>). The most anticipated plate came next, the $10 namesake Trick Dog, a tender burger shaped like a frank to fit into a sesame seed hot dog bun and ladled with lettuce, onion, pickles, cheddar cheese and their house sauce (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F12M4CiA&amp;s=6817691e391c701f267e610f370059c2020a13290a120f971f0539e023292447\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/12M4CiA</a>). It was tasty but relatively inconsequential compared to the other plates. We finally ended our meal with something sweet, the $10 Fig Tartine, which mixed Kabdota figs, their own housemade ricotta cheese, peanut brittle, ver jus and a lime vinaigrette (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uGemT0&amp;s=6c6011b97feee4d03fa1855a4011dde0a4813b1d07434948e43cc9b3d4f8b562\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1uGemT0</a>).   FOOD - 4 stars...better than expected food really chows creative flair and solid flavors AMBIANCE - 3 stars...quite loud though cordoning off the upstairs for their dining clientele was a smart move SERVICE - 4 stars...very attentive and informed TOTAL - 4 stars...the Bon Vivants deliver the goods in this space even if the bar noise dilutes the dining experience",

It may not be as frustrating to people if it was at a lounge where you can really just sit down and enjoy the ambiance and the company of others.  Cons--Horrible customer service from the 2 male servers, especially the hipster with a pony tail and fake black rim glasses. He was extremely rude...we saw him physically pushing people out of the way and screamed something along the lines of \"coming through\" as he squeezed his way through. My friend was taking a picture of me + my pineapple drink (it's the one inside a pineapple cup!) and he walked right through it and mumbled something...probably something rude. It's loud and crowded, we understand that. You are just doing your job. We know. But, if you hate your job, don't take it out on your customers. It was around 9:30pm on a Friday night and we just came from dinner. One of our friends (group of 6) came from playing Tennis and was starving. Server looked at us with disgust and said, \"I'm not going to seat 5 of you if only 1 of you will be eating.\" That is absolutely fine and totally understandable, but he could have put it in a nicer tone. Maybe try, \"Unfortunately, due to the limited amount of space, we only seat parties for full dinner\".   There are a lot of bars in the neighborhood and customer service really makes or breaks it for most San Franciscans. We have options and choices, why would we want to settle?",

Reserving more stars because the one drink I ordered was good but nothing to write home about and the selection was a bit underwhelming. \u00a0Next time I go (not on a weeknight where caffeine and tequila are not the smartest decisions), I want to try the baby turtle and night moves. \u00a0Will review again!",

    "review_text": "Staff at bar/restaurant were polite and helpful and kale salad looked epic. However, this review is aimed at the crowd, drinks and ambience on a Friday night around 11.  Entire upstairs is a dining area and not much room to move around downstairs, better for an after work place if it were empty-20 people. \u00a0Whole venue space is typical small, crowded bar. Drink menus in a fake old timey record folder. Hard to read and I don't wear glasses. Other customers equally deterred by tiny print and lack of ease in locating a drink menu (only 2, nothing posted on wall). Novel idea, bad execution. (again would be fine if you were seated and the place was empty and you had the luxury of going through it at a leisurely pace). Each record is a drink and mixed in with the original record title, Black Uhuru and other \u00a0artists' real tracks designed to elicit ooOoooos and aaAahs re: musical knowledge and general pretentiousness.  The crowd gave off a similar vibe. I felt like I was in the Marina, Polk \u00a0or any urban enclave of corporate hipsters. Had I really left the city for so long,? The Mission went from 25% to a strong 50% to a clean 98% nonconformist-conformist transplant gentrification? No, but this particular venue-Absolutely. There are two overpriced and difficult to book places with \"tasting menus\" within spitting distance: \u00a0Central Kitchen (connected to bar) and flour+water, as well as a beerstein and \"Shotwells\" a local pub serving beer and wine only..... so it makes sense. I remember growing up, a friend lived on Lexington and 19th and as much as things had been changing for the last 20 years, there was nothing like this. I felt like an alien in my own hometown. To top it off, was so crowded--as it gets in these kinds of situations some people are respectful and some people are careless and become pushy, step on you, spill drinks, (first and last occured). Either way, no one here was interacting outside their little clumps, no congeniality \u00a0or sense of community here, folks. Love small business thriving but this feels like a whole different animal. Anyhoo, that was the vibe there. \u00a0  The drinks themselves were elaborate (took 5 minutes to make), involved any combination of tiny bottles of syrups and extractions, fresh citrus peels and fresh bitters shavings, and tasted good, vodka-based and mezcal-based refreshers that did not taste overly sweet at the time. No disgusting artisanal bourbon concoctions to go with the wave of folk music/Mumford and Sons revival music in the background, (I've been tricked before by a bourbon drink sounding delicious.)   However, I had a banging headache this morning and I can usually handle my alcohol. Also drinks were not strong nor did they give me a good buzz. And even if sweet, two drinks should not give you a massive headache the next day (after drinking lots of water.)  I would never want to go back here. Again, the staff was super nice, impressively so for popular spots in the Mission, who more often then not have the apathetic to downright rude service to go with the obnoxious \"city\" vibe, it was just the crowd and the overall vibe of the place I couldn't stand. (On the service account it seemed as though the staff here were one of those exceptional city locations with all the trappings of edgy urbanites, but the humble and utterly conscientious service to make it tolerable, shout-out to Southpaw up the street-they were awesome.)   Ultimately this bar has been more fun to write about then to visit. As soon as we gave the place \u00a0a good try and ordered two different drinks we downed them and took off.",

Also retain friendliness and smiles, which is no easy feat.  My only gripe is the small space. It will get crowded, occasionally uncomfortable, but I think they do crowd control pretty well. Also this is not a complaint - people tend to come here with their friends and so inter-socialization is not likely to occur.

They've got bar seating up against the bar (obviously), as well as bar seating against the adjacent wall. The rest is just standing room. I really wish the upstairs seating section was for bar patrons, and not just for people ordering some small fare after 5 pm. I generally don't like to stand for an extended period of time with a little fancy glass filled with nectar of the gods.

    "review_text": "This is certainly a good bar with a creative cocktail program. But man - it could use an attitude adjustment.  My friend and I arrived here around 5pm to catch up over a drink. I was excited to check it out because their libation program was created by the Bon Vivants (one of SF's top mixology teams). It's located in a funky yet burgeoning part of the Mission (20th St. @ Florida), next to Central Kitchen, Salumeria, and Flour + Water. Be warned: parking in this hood ain't easy.   We saddled up at the bar and perused the menu. The menu is actually pretty clever - it's a rotating circular thingy (like something out of a board game), and you move it around to find your zodiac sign, and then it recommends a drink for you. I'm a Libra, and the corresponding drink was an interesting concoction of tequila, tangerine, dill, lime, and egg white, and maccha. All of those ingredients sounded appealing to me except the egg white. In fact, all the zodiac inspired drinks looked tasty at first, but then it would have one or two ingredients that didn't match my palate. I finally asked the hipster bartender if I could just order a regular cocktail like a martini or manhatten. This is the part that kind of cracked me up. She looked at me all snooty and replied, \"Yeah. Why wouldn't you?\" And then rolled her eyes. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, \"I just didn't see any other drinks listed on the menu. Can I just have a manhatten on the rocks?\" She kind of nodded at me as if unimpressed by my drink order. My friend decided to stick with the zodiac cocktail program and order the Libra/Tequila drink. \"Would it be possible to order this drink without the egg white?\" my friend sheepishly inquired. The bartender just sort of stared blankly at her for a few seconds and replied, \"Why? Do you have some sort of aversion to egg white or something?\" This response definitely caught the both of us off guard. \"Um, no. we just don't like it.\" The bartender sighed and went off to make our drinks.   After we got our drinks, we tried to find somewhere to sit. All the bar stools were more or less taken, and the rest of the bar area is comprised of tables and counters where you just sort of lean and drink. We decided to go upstairs to see if we could grab a table and chat. It looked more like an empty dining room with tables and silverware. But before we could grab a seat, an employee told us that this section was closed off until 5pm for dinner service. I looked at my watch and we were about 5 minutes early. So cocktails in hand and tails between our legs, we returned to the downstairs bar area and perched our drinks at one of the lean in counters.  Over all, the cocktails were very tasty. My friend loved her egg white-less tequila beverage. And my manhatten was perfectly balanced. Instead of serving it on the rocks, they gave me the largest ice cube I have ever seen (this thing was a boulder). In fact, it made drinking it by hand a little tricky (maybe that's why they call it Trick Dog). So I had to grab a straw to stick in my glass. I made sure to do it while the bartender wasn't looking, lest she roll her eyes again and judge me.  Long story short - this place makes good drinks and attracts a lively crowd. This isn't my normal go-to neighborhood, so it was nice to get out of my comfort zone and explore some place new. I would definitely return for a tasty cocktail, and I'd like to try some of their menu items. I'm just hoping that when I return, the servers drop the 'tude and make the customers feel more welcome. In my opinion, that's the difference between a good bar and a great bar.",

Very easy to get to from the freeway. My friends and I arrived about 4:00 and it was already steady. We found a nook at the bar and were immediately acknowledged by our bartender.

First up:  -Baby Turtle -Gypsy Tan -Pennies from Heaven  All of which were delicious, however the gold was claimed by the Gypsy Tan. \u00a0  Second:  -Polar Bear -Night Moves -Pantone  All three of these will blow you away. \u00a0The way the Bon Vivants have figured out balance of flavor is astounding to me. \u00a0They have one of the best grasps on the subject. Not one of the six drinks was \"too\" anything (sweet, bitter, strong, etc). \u00a0Every one of these cocktails was balanced perfectly. \u00a0And very thoughtful in every aspect (smell, taste, color, presentation). \u00a0  The food:  The Burger: Perfection. \u00a0Nothing else to say about it other than make sure you order one. Perfect size, perfectly cooked, perfect secret sauce. Just perfect.   Cracklins: Little delicious crispy bites of pork belly amazing.   Brussels Sprouts: These were cooked just the way I love them. \u00a0Not oily, not dry, not hard, not soggy. \u00a0The sunchoke chips and bacon round this dish out. \u00a0So tasty!  Fernet Ice Cream: \u00a0I'll admit I was a bit stand offish about this dessert choice thinking it was going to be some bitter tasting novelty. ORDER THIS. \u00a0The flavor of this ice cream is beyond and it is so silky smooth. \u00a0Hands down this is the best scoop of ice cream I have ever had.  Right along with the Bon Vivants cocktails their food is the same: Balanced. \u00a0Pleasing to all the senses.  The overall experience was extremely pleasing. \u00a0Thank you so much to every member of the staff of Trick Dog for making that happen. \u00a0Every one of them sincerely thanked us when leaving and wished us a good night. \u00a0  Obviously going back again and again and again.",

Open up the menu to a map of the different areas in SF, and those are the drinks. I thought it was actually just a map at first glance. Their drinks are stiff, so be careful. They may taste like juice but they are strong.   I was really looking forward to their cracklins and Scotch egg, but they no longer serve it. They have updated their menu. Most things we ordered instead were good though. The Kale salad is pretty sizable, and good. The animal style fries (they call it something else) were amazing and we were tempted to order a second one. We also got a duck egg, and that was delicious and on par with what I expect the Scotch egg to be.   The night was fun. Major props to the great drinks and food. Bartenders were awesome too.",

My friends all said that it was the best meal they had in an entire year. They raved about the cracklins pork belly dish (I did not try it since i'm vegetarian). The kale salad was absolutely delicious. They also loved the Scottish egg. Can't go wrong w/ fried green tomatoes now, can you? The best part of the evening was our server Aaron. He was personable, intelligent and funny. Loved his stories about living in Louisiana. My experience at Trick Dog made me want to move in &amp; never leave.. I hope this place does not become even more discovered than it is (open just a few months &amp; already a mention in the NY Times, all SF papers, etc), because, as is, it is perfect.

I walk back to Trick Dog with my friends and we walk upstairs to the dining area and there's 4 empty tables! Then I tell the waitress that we never received a call and she seats us on the spot- which would have been great but she gave me major attitude not apologizing but actually making it seem like they called and we just didn't answer. She continued to be nasty towards us when she came back to give us our drinks. And she hands us our menu and informs us that the burger is out.. Which is the entire reason we came.so we all walked out. This place left a really bad taste in my mouth. It honestly would have been ok if the waitress would have treated us better.",

So here's the experiment:  Walk into Trick Dog, close your eyes, and then imagine you are at Laszlo but they've taken away the propaganda paraphernalia.  Open your eyes: Voila!  I don't know why, but this looks, smells and feels just like Laszlo, right down to the balcony and being 'semi attached' to a fancy restaurant with the whole indoor-outoor feel (but the cocktails are probably better).  So, other than feeling like somewhere else, this place ain't bad. The cocktails are great, the food, while being just small plates are worth the price, and if you want that nice, dark \"don't want to know what time it is outside\" feel, this place might just pull it off. Oh and they have Hangar One as the well vodka, which earns karma points (but you aren't getting a $4 shot of well here.)  Really it was a good place to have an adult beverage, but i kinda feel like it needs a dark brown chesterfield or something to hide all the metal and concrete and take some of the edge of the upmarket crowd. But this was opening week, so the vibe may change, (but the architecture won't).  Go for at least one drink. Try to Imagine if it needs a mural of Lenin on the wall.",

The \"Mixologist\" spends an unnecessary and unreasonable amount of time on each drink, I mean he's cute and all and can do tricks like shake 2 shakers at once \u00a0Wow!!! I just want a drink though!! Which takes forever to get here, we walked out after a 15 min wait and no one even asked what we wanted or acknowledged us \u00a0and we were standing right next to the bar the whole time. \u00a0Went back in, and found a waiter to help get us a drink, still waited another 15 min. Got a table to try a few of the food items, and again the service was horrible. It took forever to get anything! \u00a0The scotch eggs were interesting, nothing else really stood out though, the deep fried sweet breads were over fried and overbreaded.

Keep in mind that if you're arriving after 9pm, you may have to wait in line outside for awhile.  Drinks are worth the wait, though. (I recommend the \"Ain't No Sunshine\" for those with a penchant for sour tequila cocktails, and the \"Bad Girl\" for lovers of bubbles and gin.) The bartenders are troopers for being able to serve so many people at once. I was literally shoulder-to-shoulder with other patrons; one annoying man kept pushing into me, tilting my stool halfway off the ground. (I wouldn't have fallen because there were 5 other people holding me up from the other direction. Yes, it's that crowded.)  My friends and I arrived at 8pm and asked if they could make room in the eating area upstairs for a table of 6. (Sadly, they don't take reservations for dinner.) They said we'd have to wait around an hour; we ended up waiting for 2. One pleasant surprise after we were seated, though: the food, once ordered, arrives lightning-fast. And it was perhaps the best \"bar food\" I've ever had. We all shared the kale salad (decent flavors), the trick dog (shamefully indulgent burger-dog with creamy sauce and cheese), beef tartare (SO SO SO SO SO GOOD, my favorite thing on the menu), cracklins (crispy pork belly, rich and delicious -- may induce heart attacks if eaten too often), and thrice-cooked manimal-style fries (OMG salivating at the thought of eating these again).   Overall had a great time. Would recommend heading over at 8pm at the latest, earlier if you want to eat. Also probably not ideal for big parties. Did I mention how much I LOVE the industrial decor? The drink menus, not so much. I heard they used to have amazing Pantone menus, but they've been redesigned as \"record albums\" -- not the easiest to read. Word of advice: Be sure to hold the menu upright or all the \"records\" will come spilling out.",

Although I suppose it is kind of morbidly interesting to know that either the staff doesn't get along with each other or the guy preparing the food has a major chip on his shoulder to such a point that the wait staff feels the need to report it to anyone that will listen to them vent about it. Or something.  The food was okay I guess, but the burgers are pretty small for 10 dollars. I feel like serving a hamburger in a white-bread hot dog bun is a thin gimmick to avoid giving you very much meat or higher quality break, but maybe it is that white-trash chic comfort thing. Either way, be ready for a supermarket hotdog bun being a major part of your meal. And remember, according to the wait-staff, the guy who works in the kitchen and is preparing your food is really a major dick.",

    "review_text": "Two years ago, I gave up on Mr. Tequila after he left me on the floor at the Palazzo Hotel in Vegas. I woke up to my bachelorette friend and a trio of security guys hovering over me shaking their heads. Damn you, Mr. Tequila.  Once Mr. Tequila left my life, I've done some growing up and have been semi-behaved. That's until I saw him featured in the Patone-colored menu at one of the hottest new bars in SF.  From the people who brought you Flour + Water, Salumeria, and Central Kitchen (next door) comes Trick Dog, an industrial vintage bar in Potrero Hill/Mission serving creative artisanal cocktails ($8-$12) by cute bartenders along with tantalizing bar food eats. 60's and 70s Motown favorites from The Supremes, Marvin Gaye, and Jackson 5 playing in the background added to that old-time feel.  Trick Dog is cracking and even on a Wednesday at 5:30 pm, all the bar seats were taken (hipster and yuppie crowd). Come early as it's a small bar and there's only 12-14 stools. They do have an upper level with tables but all the action is downstairs. Parking is all residential and it may take several rounds to find a spot.  There were over 20 artisanal cocktails on the menu and against my better judgment, I ordered the Baby Turtle: tequila, campari, grapefruit &amp; lime topped w/ a creamy egg froth ($12). It was wonderfully refreshing with a luscious creamy and fragrant finish from the cinnamon sprinkled egg white froth: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FZFrt6I&amp;s=787a45756f0f6aa263a93076bba27c35c67aec83528b27fd334d14cae69b6590\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/ZFrt6I</a>. I'm usually not a cocktail girl but this one was cocktastic; cocktail-wise that is. I expected nothing less from the Bon Vivants/Owners who consulted on the menu for 15 Romolo among other bars known for their stellar cocktails.  Happy hour is never complete without something to nosh on. Perusing the menu of cracklins, mushroom hummus, sweetbreads, the burger, and other delectable eats, we decided to exercise some self-control and order one item, the $10 Scotch Egg. One for each of us because I never share my yolk. Fernet lovers: there's even Fernet ice cream on the menu which I regrettably forgot to order. The kitchen closes at 1:30 am.   It's a good thing we ordered two Scotch eggs because it was incredibly delicious: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F13Xsdem&amp;s=2099191d24f63b7c33042b8e0c750115e1b1a4e1c5b9ecb73e47633017bd093d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/13Xsdem</a>. Perfectly fried to a golden brown, the salt cod (tastes exactly like dungeness crab) encased egg was crunchy on the outside with an yolk that oozed out like lava upon cutting into: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F13XsfTF&amp;s=9efd6797891924758dc8a35ff65c5e623e7c0f001053f1f26550717756278e9a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/13XsfTF</a>. The beet confit, creme fraiche and salmon roe made it that much more decadent.  Trick Dog is a great neighborhood bar to distress and drown yourself in one of their yummy cocktails but beware of their not very \"happy\" hour prices (no hh specials). The tab for two was $80 (including tip) for four cocktails and two Scotch Eggs. Ouchie. Minus one star for a pricey menu in this more desolate area of SF.  Nobody ended up on the floor this time after Mr. Tequila's reappearance but he did make the bill less painful to hand over my debit card after downing two Baby Turtles.   For those hella balling, Gilt City has a \"deal\" for Trick Dog: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.giltcity.com%2Fsan-francisco%2Ftrickdogsfmar&amp;s=390e3fac909ddbb56e5995303bb01bf327615d29b9e2316c7cabc75db8d9a15c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">giltcity.com/san-francis\u2026</a>. You can have a private party for 20 guests for a mere $5,000 (cocktails only) or 75 guests for $15,000 (cocktails and food). Pshhh, just the cost of a wedding banquet...",

We ordered grandma's sweater (I love anything with mint and thought the proportions were perfect), baby turtle, and gypsy tan (which I've just listed in order of my preference). The colors of the drinks are super cool and unique. The menu is interesting with a large variety (see menu at their site).  We ordered the trick dog which was delicious, manimal fries (gluttony at its best) and a soft boiled egg. All were well prepared and unique and tasty, although kind of pricey.  My throat felt super sore afterwards because we basically yelled at each other for three hours straight, since it's so loud inside. That's the only reason I give it less than 5 stars - how loud it is.  Service was average in attentiveness but very nice and friendly. I highly recommend this as a date place or a small group outing (definitely not large though).",

It's really small and holds about 50 people. Bathrooms are spacious. Its very HIPSTER. I like it a lot. They have a unique cocktail menu to order from. The drinks are pretty strong for my tastes. It's a fun place to just grab a couple drinks with friends and although it's small it wasn't over crowded. They also have these cool postcards that they'll send out for you if you out it in their mail box! No postage necessary!   Drinks tried: $12.00 each Mission Dolores (tastiest) Coit Tower (strong, slight carbonation) ... gold Fire Hydrant (strong)  They have other drinks. Shots are pretty cheap. Their menu is basically a map of San Francisco. Very cool theme and atmosphere. Give it a try at least once. You have to find street parking! The people here are really nice!",

After walking about a mile, we realized we had actually walked right by the place... Of course, just like any good little hipster bar, there is no sign to indicate it's presence.  After our somewhat long jaunt, we ordered a few drinks and were led upstairs to cozy into a table (we were also given no fuss for transferring our bar tab to our table +cool points to the staff!). We started with the Lion Heart cocktail... which was delicious, but a tad sweet for our liking.  Then moved on to the Polar Bear and the Pantone (both of which we liked much more than the Lion Heart). Herby, refreshing, complex... Who would have thunk Beet Juice and Ginger would taste so good with Bourbon? (I'm hereby making some excitingly alcoholic revisions to my summer juice cleanse...)  With our second round of drinks, we also ordered the cheese spread and a Scottish egg. The cheese spread wasn't great and the veggies didn't look particularly fresh, however, the Scottish Egg was pretty tasty and was served quickly.  All in all, I think the atmosphere is nice, the wait staff was great, the drinks rocked...but the food can be easily beat in that neighborhood.  With 4 drinks and 2 appetizers, our bill came to $60.",

Shared the beef tartare and it was good but not exceptional.   Current fav drinks: \u00a0\"Mr. Big Stuff\" \u00a0(see pineapple drink pic) and \"Eye of the Tiger\". The Eye of the Tiger was mouthwatering, tangy, and refreshing. \u00a0Mixing the condiment honey mustard, apple juice, lime, and mezcal (among other ingredients) was delicious! Who'd have thunk it?",

Amazing combination to give a well balanced by strong flavored drink.

Cracklins: Pork belly cooked crispy, with brown sugar, salt &amp; spice- These are great chips to go with the bar drinks!!  Overall, one of the coolest bars in the Mission!

After so many years of following the Bon Vivant guys, I'm stoked they have a brick and mortar to call their own... and they seem to be rippin' and tearin' their way into SF cocktail bar glory.  Their converted warehouse is the perfect setting for a well curated libation, and the fact that they're open at 3:00pm on weekdays means Summer Fridays have a new best friend.   I didn't have a chance to try their food (someday) as I was there to tap into the drink menu, and it certainly lived up to expectations. Dozens of creative elixirs dotted the menu (that's comprised of 45s - brilliant!) with seasonal ingredients being the biggest takeaway. All sorts of stone fruit and seasonal melon beverages made it hard to select just one... but really, you could just throw a dart at a page and chances are you'll be happy.   The service was slightly aloof, but I suppose it was early in the day and dude behind the bar was just cracking his knuckles for the afternoon. Probably the only bummer part of my quick jaunt.

The Trick Dog which was the burger was great and juice and so delicious. The scotch egg was also great. Big portion and definitely I can tell why there are so many reviews on it. But I think the best dish was the Kale Salad. I've had some other kale salads before and this one was just so delicious. However, I will say, not the best to eat when I'm drinking haha.

Located near a lot of warehouses on a poorly lit street so just look for the building with a bouncer in front. \u00a0Drinks are well thought out - tried the \"Grandma's Sweater\" which was a perfect mixture of sweet + tart, however shared a carafe of their punch with my friend and was waaay too sweet, wish they had let me try it beforehand! Between my friend and I we tried the Trick Dog, the Scotch Egg, and a pickle board. I would recommend getting the pickles to munch on throughout the night as it is a decent portion. The Trick Dog is basically a hot dog-shaped burger. SO DELICIOUS. I wouldn't recommend sharing this unless you are prepared to fight for the last bite. Overall, the service was very attentive, the food was satisfying and the drinks were A-OK. I'll definitely be back to give some other cocktails a try.",

Airy, sunny and a little industrial feel during the day, dark and cozy atmosphere at night. It's not a large space, but still feels pretty open.The upstairs loft has a bunch of tables for a nicer sit-down drinks and snacks experience. The best part is of course the cocktails! I've tried the Pantone, Gypsy Tan, Pennies from Heaven and Night Moves (not many places do a good drink with coffee flavor!) and they were all really well-balanced and delicious. The bartenders are friendly and skilled-despite a lack of suspenders or carefully sculpted hipster facial hair. The food is also definitely worth trying-particularly the scotch egg and the brussel sprouts.",

The building is industrial, which is normal for the neighborhood, and I couldn't really see the sign if there was one but it appeared to be the only bar on that block.  We went on a weekday, so it's hard to tell how packed it gets on weekends. It was busy for a Thursday night, and there was plenty of room to stand, walk around, and even sit (always a plus).  The fact that the menus change in a creative manner was awesome. When we went, the menu was a map with drinks named after places around SF. I recommend the Painted Ladies. Deliciously sweet and refreshing like a mint moquito but less minty. I also had the Golden Fire Hydrant, which was good but not as unique in flavors.  For food, we had the fish tacos and fries (manimal style). Considering how dark it was, we could not figure out what the \"manimal\" was. Either way, both dishes were awesome.   I knocked off a star based on service. We rarely saw the waitress before we were seated and while we were eating. Our drink order got lost at some point, and she didn't own up to it so that was a little weird. I'm lenient when it comes to service, and it's a bar/restaurant so I would lower my standards anyway. Getting a drink downstairs wasn't terribly difficult, and that's more important :)  Also, the person that made the menu on their mobile site needs to sell his/her services to every restaurant! It is not just a PDF document!",

Upon entering and finding a spot to squeeze in we were acknowledged immediately and given a drink menu to peruse. \u00a0The Panettone card style menu is a little large and therefore a bit unwieldy to flip through but on the other hand it is creative and definitely convenient. \u00a0 You can just pick what you want and hand it back to the bartender rather than try to shout over the din. \u00a0   We tried the Gypsy Tan and Pennies From Heaven. \u00a0Both were complex and delicious. \u00a0If we didn't have a show to attend we would have gone back for another round and tried the food but we'll have to wait until next time. \u00a0Sadly, the line was way too long (30 people or so) after the show ended (around midnight) so when we return it'll have to be early. \u00a0YMMV. \u00a0  Loved the decor and people watching. \u00a0Since the space is pretty small it gets warm inside, especially upstairs ...so be prepared. \u00a0 Street parking in the area is not too bad. \u00a0Restrooms are shared with the restaurant next door but weren't crowded at all and were practically spotless.  Is the crowd pretentious or hipster? \u00a0Eh... \u00a0I dunno... \u00a0 \u00a0I didn't get that vibe but then I'm a little older than most of the folks who were there so I also didn't particularly care. \u00a0I'm not trying to compete with or impress anyone. \u00a0I'm just interested in good food, good drink and good atmosphere and Trick Dog delivers. \u00a0 \u00a0  We'll be back. \u00a0Saving a star for the food until then.",

We ordered: -Grandma's Sweater - DELICIOUS. It had Gin, Lime, Mint and Bitter Lemon....there was so much mint in it that you could barely taste the alcohol. So wonderful. -Straw Hat - skip. Tasted so bland compared to Grandma's sweater. Boring drink. -Ice cream special of the day, which happened to be POPCORN flavored. This was a real treat!!! \u00a0We were pleasantly surprised.

But first, let me start by sharing what came in the drink I ordered last Saturday:   - Tequila - Tangerine  - Dill - Lime - EGG WHITE - Maccha   Yes, egg white. And let me tell you... it was amazing. Seriously, one of the weirdest but best drinks I've had. It was the Libra and it was on the front of the menu where they have all of the zodiac signs which represent drinks. Very cool, and such a unique drink.   So the first pro here is that they have awesome drinks. The second pro would be the atmosphere. It has a real cocktail bar feel, and the bartenders all really know what they are doing. Loved that about this place.   The downside is definitely the lack of bar seating and the fact that it is uncomfortably crowded. Once you order a drink, you're kind of just stranded in the middle. There is kind of a place to stand and set you drink along the back wall, but good luck squirming your way into finding a spot to stand. I was with a group of 4 and it just wasn't really happening.   I will definitely come back, mainly for the atmosphere and the drinks. I think this is more of a Tuesday night type place versus a weekend night.",

Recently I went to a party here that was wall to wall people. The Space is basically a long rectangular room with an upstairs having s few tables. Considering the standing room only first floor, the bartenders were on their game and actually got the drinks to us in a timely manner. I asked my bartender to make something of her choice with bourbon, while my friend got the non alcoholic pineapple/coconut selection. Both fairly solid drinks. I wish i was there longer to try a few more but between talking to people i knew all over the room and the parking restrictions we had to adhere to for my friends car, we had to cut out early.  One of my co workers loves the burger here so she keeps telling me i should have it. One day im going to come back on a more normal service and have food plus a few more drinks to see how they usually run. However even with these crowded, busy condition, they delivered a good time. 4.25 stars",

Having browsed the menu and steeled ourselves for a night of deep-fried meat, we ordered most things to share: The Pickle Plate: was really diverse, and not too sour, ranging from spicy, to curried cauliflower, to caraway cabbage. The Kale Salad could hardly count as our evening's vegetable (if cooked down it would have been Kale Gratin) but creamy mild dressing, tons of snowy parmesan, and rich pepitas made it meal-worthy. I've waited too long to try a Scotch Egg and this one, surrounded by Brandade instead of ground meat, will have me trying more. \u00a0Despite having 4 condiments, they all worked together, or separately as I toured my plate. The Manimal Style Thrice-Cooked Fries had me worried with their pallid color, but they were crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, and of course, covered in nouveau Thousand Island and some sort of dark and mysterious stand in for caramelized onions that I thought were seaweed, and my boyfriend thought were, well, caramelized green onions. \u00a0I concede that he's probably right. \u00a0Despite losing that bet (anyone feel free to back me up) this was the best thing I ate that night...and the week before. The Shrimp Cocktail was a bit scant--4 shrimp in a wee dish with a spoonful of horseradish and a spoonful of their smoothly ketchup-like bloody mary mix. \u00a0While not for lovers of chunky, iced, old school Shrimp Cocktail, this dish is for lovers of raw shrimp--sweet, mild and tender. I would never have ordered the rice plate, but for chicken-lovers and traditionalists, this little dinner of a deep fried rice block and tender chicken thighs is for you. Last was the Trick Dog. \u00a0If you want an amazing, artery-clogging burger and fries, come to Trick Dog and get a Trick Dog and Thrice-Cooked Fries. While it is it's own tomato-less (and virtually lettuce-less) beast of high percentage meats, cheese and creamy sauce, when combined with the perfect fries, this could be the best burger dinner in town. \u00a0Just add a cocktail. The cocktails veered a little farther from their ancestors...and were a little less palatable. \u00a0All pretty and creative, each tended to be overwhelmed by a token flavor. \u00a0The Mr. Big Stuff tasted like sunscreen (coconut). \u00a0The Evil Woman had the dark spice of dried chiles, and little else. \u00a0The Ain't No Sunshine was overpowered by the coffee liquor, there was one that tasted like burning rubber (mezcal), and there was even one that just tasted like lemon juice.* I'm not a whiskey drinker, but the Bankrobber was my favorite of the night. Rounded, warm, sweet: it's token flavor would have to be the spirit of Christmases yet to come.  *I'm a sip mooch. I didn't actually finish all of these.",

It was pretty crowded in the bar area, but having heard about how great the food was, we headed upstairs to for an early dinner. We ordered:  Food: The Scotch Egg- I liked the idea, but I think many people are fooled by the plating. Plus, the egg has a very fishy tasting layer between the egg and the breading. Nothing should every be fishy tasting. Even fish. Yuck.  The Trick Dog-A pretty solid burger, but it wasn't good enough to make me want to return here just for this one dish. Cracklins- very good, but fried fat is not so hard to get wrong.   Drinks: Pennies from Heaven- interesting, but I only had one sip because it was too alcohol-tasting for me, but I am really not a big drinker, so I always feel very biased whenever I give a drink review. Grandma's Sweater- This was pretty good and balanced with the right amount of sweet, sour, and alcohol flavor. It didn't have the alcohol taste as much, but it was still a very strong drink! I drank about half and had to stop.   Our food came out before the drinks, which no one ever likes, but I know the bar was busy downstairs. The service was okay, not really much to discuss there. Although, the waitress did apologize for the drinks coming out slowly. Overall, I thought this meal was disappointing and overpriced for what we had. I think if I had out of town guests who were more into scene and ambiance, I would bring them here, but this wouldn't be a place for me to return any time soon.",

Stopped in there one evening a few months back while waiting on a table at Central Kitchen. \u00a0It was pretty crowded, which is to be expected on a Saturday evening at the new \"it\" cocktail joint. \u00a0Once I managed to slip and slide my way up to the bar so I could order a Baby Turtle, I was pretty much ignored by the \"mixologist\". \u00a0Waited about 10 more minutes and then hit the road through the back hallway and sat on the fountain with a nice beer at Central Kitchen. \u00a0I chalked this one up to being slammed on a Saturday night and everyone else south of Chestnut Street wanting to be there.  Which brings me to last night (03/27/2013) a Wednesday at 6:30. \u00a0We had reservations at flour + water at 7:15 so I though we'd give this place another shot, I'm always a sucker for a well crafted cocktail. \u00a0The place, as expected was bustling for a Wednesday but far less crowded then the previous Saturday night cocktail attempt failure. \u00a0We looked at the Pan-tone cocktail menu, decided on a Paper Moon and again a Baby Turtle...and just like the past visit started to wait and wait and wait. \u00a0And just like the past bailed after 10 minutes of watching the bartender methodically mix his creations. 0 for 2.  I accept the fact that a lot of work goes into each drink, but take the 1 second to look up and notice the ever impatient, thirsty, soon to be ex-patrons and at least make eye contact. \u00a0This would inspire hope that you're at going to get to us soon. \u00a0  I had a great deal of expectations for this place but 2 failed attempts at getting just one cocktail have brought me to a couple of conclusions: 1. This place needs to staff up to the level to handle the crowd. 2. Jay 'n Bee never disappoints. 3. The fact that this place is associated with Central Kitchen and flour + water raise the expectations, it's time to live up to them.",

They were able to have a few drinks and apps. She was totally spot on. My friend and I arrived around 5 on Saturday and bar was not too crowded. I was able to order drinks relatively fast-it took me longer to go through their drink menu than it took to make the drinks.   They have very inventive concoctions on their menu. My friend had Grandma's Sweater and I stuck with my tried and true Campari and soda (don't judge me). Both were delish. The bartenders are lovelyto look at and friendly - what a girl can't appreciate eye candy? \u00a0Drinks were reasonably priced. The crowd was a mix of hipsters and older folks- alright by me.   We didn't have any food but it looked delish and my friend and I talked about going back for dinner very soon.   Thanks for the recommendation, Kristi. I will be back.",

    "review_text": "What a nice new spot to hit up that's pretty much different that your usual \"normal\" bar.  Don't call the guys bartenders here at Trick Dog, they're mix-ologists. I like to call them the Baristas of the bar business. They put their heart and soul into every drink you order. Actually, they're NOT even drinks, they're MASTERPIECES. I like the fact that they put a lot of pride into every drink and they dont skim on anything either. It's quality out here!  There was a small line on a friday night and I wasn't complaining at all. It maybe gets 10 deep at most? Also, keep in mind this place has NO SIGN. So make sure you yelp it and google map it or else you'll pass it just like i did!   Bouncer at the door is not your usual bouncer. This guy is super chill. Well of course, dont mess around like a dumb drunk and you'll be fine  What's also great is that they don't over pack it and there's no cover. The reason is that the drinks are such a master piece that it does take a bit of time to make so they want to make sure the place is not over-crowded and that theres breathing room for the guys making the drinks one by one.   They also serve food! some nice starts / appetizers. I was able to try the pork belly and it was pretty good. Deep fried and seasoned along w/ some nice buffalo / crystal hot sauce for dipping. It was so good but so bad for you though. Kale salad was a nice light snack especially because those shots of Makers Mark from yelper Winnie H. and Braden K. got.   This is a GREAT spot to chill and mingle on any given night. DONT expect this to be a bar to go binge drink and take shots til you black out and cant remember a thing and leaves you grasping for water at 6am in bed next to someone you dont even know. There is barely any music in here, so if you're looking to get smashed and chocolate-henny wasted while getting ratchet to some 2 Chainz, go hit up polk.",

I asked my friend for a recommendation in the Mission district, and she told me about this place.   There's no sign outside so we literally almost walked past without noticing it. The guy outside very kindly welcomed us in. We only stopped by for drinks, so unfortunately did not get to try the food (which seems to be pretty good based on the reviews!)  The bar was super crowded when we got there, but as expected I suppose for a Saturday night in the city. I actually don't drink alcohol really, but my friends all ordered a drink or two and commented that they weren't actually that strong. Still good, however. They do have a menu of specialty cocktails here, but I believe my friends all went for their usual drinks. Overall, a decent bar to hang out. If your'e looking for lower volumes and intimate conversations, then this is not for you. But if you're just looking for a fun night out, I would definitely recommend checking this place out.",

It's also really loud since its right above the bar, so really hard to talk to. Not really good for date night, unless you don't want to talk to your date. Anyway, we ordered the Trick Dog, Thrice cooked Fries Manimal Style, and the Scotch Egg. The Trick Dog was surprisingly very good and flavorful, so were the fries.

There's no signage outside other than two Chinese characters in red that translate to \"trick dog\". Good thing there's a bouncer standing out there watching for confused patrons and asking us \"are you looking for trick dog?\".  The space is long and skinny, two floors. Kinda like Rickhouse downtown. But not nearly as crowded. Service could possibly be worse though.  The entire menu is in Chinese with pinyin translations of the names. Luckily the descriptions are in English and each item has a number to order from.  Choose quickly then peruse as you stand around trying to get the bar's attention. Literally there were 5 people behind the bar and only one person making drinks. Took me 20 minutes to get my order in and at least another 15 before it showed up. After that though it wasn't as bad. Not sure if things were going smoother behind the bar or if we as a group were able to get their attention better when we needed it, or maybe we were just being efficient and when one person wanted to order everyone else would rush in with their requests.  Drinks themselves are very very good. I tried the #2 (cranberry), #3 (tropical gin), #9 (herbal bourbon). I like how they pair up the flavors. But I like strong drinks and herbal flavors.",

    "review_text": "I finally got to eat dinner here, and it was all really nicely done! No wait for a group of 3 at 7pm on a Friday night (though we were lucky), while the downstairs was packed to the brim.  THE WAIT: I came in around 6:30pm and there were a couple tables open upstairs. I was hoping I could put my name down on the wait and go home and change, but because their dining area is so small they don't hold tables as a policy. Luckily my friends were only 20 minutes away and I waited for them, hoping the tables wouldn't get claimed in the meantime. The main server told me when they were five minutes away she'd hold the tables for us, and she did as promised and we had a really nice dinner =).  THE SERVICE: Our server was really efficient at her job, but did not crack a single smile at us the entire night until the end. We were a little scared of her. All our food came out as it was ready and the order seemed a little random (order as listed below), but we enjoyed it nonetheless.  MUST-HAVES: Kale Salad, Thrice-Cooked Fries.  I love that their cocktail menu changes and is always super creative. Last time I came about a year ago, it looked like a pantone menu. This time it was a map of SF. I wanted to keep a copy for myself! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=kvQjHP0FGx9YL3cCELbcQg#ybyTHkHke6ouNEmgw2g5yg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a>  COCKTAILS: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=kvQjHP0FGx9YL3cCELbcQg#kvQjHP0FGx9YL3cCELbcQg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a> * Dragon Gate (Campo de Encanto acholado pisco, muscat, Szechuan pepper, ginger, lemon, egg white) - 4 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=3Sowsu-u_SZdSDfYr8zRBQ#mOl1WxLs5COE3b7J3bWQ7Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a> Everyone really liked this - very smooth, really well balanced, definitely the lemon and muscat were the prominent flavors. Unfortunately I ordered this for the Szechuan pepper &amp; ginger, which were much less prominent. I enjoyed this a lot but really wished the flavor had more of a kick to it.  My bf got the Alcatraz and really liked it. He didn't like the Cliff House as much.  DINNER: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=3Sowsu-u_SZdSDfYr8zRBQ#3Sowsu-u_SZdSDfYr8zRBQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a> * Kale Salad (avocado, parmesan, pepitas, slow-cooked egg yolk dressing. $9) - 4.5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=3Sowsu-u_SZdSDfYr8zRBQ#HYwpU-TrbsslWfV2xt8_qg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a> Really nice! The avocado was amazing, though came in a few big chunks and could've been more evenly broken up throughout the salad. I liked that the dressing wasn't drenching the kale but more like evenly coating it. The pepitas were toasted and worked great too.   * Hamachi (white miso, asian pear, pea shoots, sesame. $14) - 3.5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=3Sowsu-u_SZdSDfYr8zRBQ#hLIfnfuBgmz1jqgpnq9hHg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a> I was surprised even though this isn't really a seafood place, the quality of the hamachi was really good. I wished the asian pear was more crisp and sweet to add texture and a twist of flavor. There was a lot of some sauce/aioli on the plate, way more than was needed for the amount of food, and it was mostly flavorless.  * Scotch Egg (soft-boiled egg, brandade, purple potato salad, romesco. $10) - 4 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=3Sowsu-u_SZdSDfYr8zRBQ#mhr0BwnIy-dAa19lP59VGA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a> cross-section: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=3Sowsu-u_SZdSDfYr8zRBQ#FWGpRxRje-Y1pURRVKQ8LQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a> Great texture to the egg's outer part, and really unique. Not really a breading, but more like fried layers. Really crisp and nice. The romesco was good, but the purple potato salad seemed like a coleslaw, not really amazing.  * Thrice-Cooked Fries ($5, manimal style +$2) - 4.5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=3Sowsu-u_SZdSDfYr8zRBQ#qkuWGgeNZ9PgjFwZxObddw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a> The thrice-cooking probably attributes to the extra crisp to these fries - but not the kind thats too hard and kind of burnt, but more like a thicker crisp that still breaks apart easily to reveal the soft inner part. The manimal style was great too! Very fatty &amp; filling...  * The Trick Dog (house-ground blend of chuck, brisket &amp; sirloin, lettuce, onion, pickles, cheddar cheese, house sauce. $10) - 4 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=3Sowsu-u_SZdSDfYr8zRBQ#DkMhAKF0kMeynAX8No0TNw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a> cross-section: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=3Sowsu-u_SZdSDfYr8zRBQ#mP1ggsE6K4-FzhJsfW8jiA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a> Basically a glorified name for a hamburger in the shape of a hot dog. Still, great quality patty.. very soft, buttery, and medium-rare by default (they didn't ask). \u00a0The shredded lettuce is a great idea, makes the eating much easier! Very drippy and fatty with their house sauce. Good but doesn't seem as high quality as the other food we got there.",

SCOTCH EGG HAD ME AT HELLO!  - FOOD, simple and delicious - PRICES, decent - SERVICE, very good - AMBIANCE, bar downstairs/tiny restaurant upstairs. the concept is simple and creative.   Great company, great conversations, clinging of drinks, and endless laughter is what I look forward to after work the past several Wednesdays. And Wednesday was soon here again. We came here hunting for new palate experiences because that is how we roll through the concrete jungles. Knowing me, I will go lengths to experience something new, something yet not discovered by the masses, something unique that will draw you back for more, and something where I can attempt to replicate in my own kitchen. \u00a0Their concepts and creativity makes me like this place even more. The drink menu was a book of records and each record was a drink. Good vibe, good music, good crowd, good food. I've been \"domesticated\" every Wednesday for the past 1.4 years, my friends have said I've been liberated from a deadbeat loser with no future going for himself.  HEFFER STATUS.  LINDA RONSTADT HEAT WAVE ($10) - Hanger one, lillet rose, melleti, galliano, watermelon, and lime. SO YUMMY. Very delicate in taste and has a light herbal and fruit taste. It was was a creeper, hit me like a ton of bricks. Their drinks here are off the chains.  CRACKLINGS ($6) - Pork belly, brown sugar, spice blend. Uhm SPICY. When I choose to eat some kind of meat, it will have to be pork. It was their version of chicharron, it was good but kind of spicy. I liked how it was freshly fried and didn't carry that old grease taste. After about 3-4 crackins, I was over it as the spice just got spicier. Good to share with another person.  KALE SALAD ($9) - Avocado, parmesan, pepitos, slow-cooked egg yolk dressing. This was one of the best kale salads I've ever had in my life. You can trust my opinion on that. It was lightly creamy because of the egg yolk and avocado, easily to take down, and just a healthy kind deliciousness I can't really explain. I can't believe I'm speaking so highly of a kale salad but it was just a great dish. Good to share between 2-3 people.  SCOTCH EGG ($10) - Soft-boiled egg, brandade, beet confit, salmon roe, cr\u00e8me fraiche. WTHeezie.... pretty damn delicious. I will have to say that it kinda is a bit salty, but if you take each bite with a bit of the beet confit (purple stuff) it really balanced everything out and make the dish ten times tastier. I don't think everything on the plate meshed well but the scotch egg with the beet confit go hand and hand. We ordered one for each of us. Oh my, it's a must.  Our bill totaled around $66+. Not bad at all, our bellies left happy.  Will I be back? We want to come back on Wednesdays but we have decided to not get stuck at once great places and keep hunting for more.  JABA APPROVED.

My first drink was a bartenders choice that a friend of mine got and I had to try. \u00a0The only instructions were bourbon and citrus and the rest was on Chad. \u00a0He did an amazing job and I wish I could remember what it was called because I would definitely try to get a replication back home.  Next up was the Pennies From Heaven (Templeton Rye, Meletti, Leopold sour apple liqueur, sherry, and Gold Rush bitters). \u00a0I Thoroughly enjoyed this one even with the added sweetness. \u00a0Until I tried the Witch Wood. \u00a0I'm not downing on the Pennies From Heaven, but the Witchwood (Torres ten-year brandy, Pampero Aniversario rum, Manzilla sherry, Pedro Ximenez sherry, Ron Miel honey rum, and Alhambra bitters Served up) was wonderfully wicked.  I can't wait to go back.  PS. - I heard people are stealing those sweet ass bar menus that look like paint swatches. \u00a0Don't do that. \u00a0Doing that makes you an asshole and discourages the bar owner from wanting to incorporate unique products into his establishment in fear that children won't know how to behave in public.",

    "review_text": "So I was on a recent trip to SF and Trick Dog was a definite must on my list. It was recently names one of the best bars in the world along with another SF bar. I had tried to go to the other bar on the list, Smugglers Cove, the night before and didn't even get in because of the pretentious and angry man working the door who had an attitude problem. I had almost lost hope that I would get to try one of SF's best bars but then I went to Trick Dog.  Trick Dog doesn't have a sign out front so when we first arrived we were confused if we had gotten the address correct. We stopped to try and look around and immediately a friendly man approached us and said \"Looking for Trick Dog?\" and he lead us right into the bar. I immediately felt welcomed! The bar had an upstairs with sit down tables and the downstairs was the actual bar. We were able to get a seat right away and were instantly handed a drink menu. The menu itself was literally a map with each drink named after a neighborhood/attraction in SF which was pretty cool.  We tried a total of four drinks; Lombard Street, Alcatraz, Mission Dolores and Fugazi Bank. My favorite was the Mission Dolores which was a sweet drink of four rums, followed by the Lomard Street drink. Overall, all of the drinks were fantastic and it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartenders work their magic.   The staff was really friendly and I am so glad I finally got to visit this place. The service, drinks and atmosphere were top notch and I can't wait to return!",

    "review_text": "Oh Trick Dog, what a tricky review this feels to write. If I had written this review after my first visit, this would probably be a 4 star review. However, after my 2nd visit for a friend's birthday party, I'm feeling a little less generous and going to round down to 3 stars.  The drinks are certainly the strong point of this establishment. The bartenders take their time to make them properly, and they've got some unique ones on the menu. However, I've definitely had hits and misses with them. Yes, drinks are largely a personal preference thing, but bottom line is that I'm still not happy if I'm paying $10+ for a drink I feel is \"meh.\"   There's also a small dining area upstairs, but if you don't get in during the first round, expect to wait a long time to get a table, or don't expect to get one at all. Plus side is that you can order your food downstairs and they'll bring it out to you. However, I feel a large portion of the food falls into the meh category as well. The Trick Dog especially so. I like how their signature namesake dish is unique in that it's a hamburger shaped to fit in a hot dog bun, but I honestly don't think I understand the practical purpose or benefit to this. The flavors and textures reminded of a fancy big mac. Not a bad thing in itself, but I'd rather pay big mac prices instead of Trick Dog prices then! :P A friend ordered the scotch egg, and after I tried a bite I agreed with their once again \"meh\" consensus. Thrice-cooked manimal style fries weren't bad, but not stand out either. Cracklins were definitely my favorite out of all the food I tried, which unfortunately isn't saying that much.  Luckily the few times I've been here I haven't had to wait in line, but the line here can get long, and this small space gets pretty crowded. Cool joint, friendly staff, and I like the vibe here. However, I'm going to give this review 3 stars, largely due to the value I feel I'm getting for the food, drink, and overall experience.",

The drinks introduce flavor fusions of ingredients you don't hear about everyday that I normally wouldn't see go together. \u00a0So yes, it's always a treat to see what they come up with!

The whiskey/ginger beer and citrus are always a killer combo. The beets add a nice texture/earthiness to the drink (which is complemented by the whiskey), \u00a0while the sweetness from the combier and kummel add a nice finish touch.

The bar staff and patrons are very friendly. The drinks are interesting and extremely tasty. My favorite was the Lombard, but could have easily drank the other drinks I tasted. Everything was well balanced and smooth.  On a side note, we ended up going again on a Saturday night, and the place is pretty crowded all night.

    "review_text": "This place was more awesome than I expected it to be. I went to Trick Dog with 5 friends on the second day that it was open, and as imagined, it wasn't a slow night. It was packed, but I'm guessing if you give it a few weeks, it'll die down on the weekdays since it's a little off the beaten path (Valencia). I'd been hitting up the Hideout behind Dalva for craft cocktails, but am really glad that Trick Dog is another available option, as it lives up to the hype, and bonus points, is much closer to my apartment. The location is great. A major ease of going to Trick Dog as opposed to the Hideout will be not having to wonder if my bike will still be there when I leave.  One might think that their Pantone-themed drinks, and even further, menus could be compensating for weak service or cocktails, but that wasn't the case for us. All six of us got a different drink, and they were all AMAZING. Service was backed up for the night, but it was the second night they were open, so you gotta give 'em a break.   I ordered the Pantone 7621, which contains a few of my fave ingredients: beet, ginger, and lemon, combined with Kummel, Combier, and Four Roses Bourbon. Yummy in my tummy! My second favorite of the night was the Vintage Photo, but the Baby Turtle: Tequila Ocho resposado, Campari (YES), grapefruit, cinnamon, lime, and egg white served on the rocks took the cake. Whomever came up with the recipe for the Baby Turtle, you are a bartending superhero.  This place is going to be one of my new haunts. Cocktails at Trick Dog followed by pool at Shotwells = recipe for success. The tall man in the white shirt who works there and gave us a table to sit all six of us upstairs that night rules. Let's be friends. I'll be back tonight!",

    "review_text": "Trick Dog, to me, is what I think of if I had to describe a type of bar you might not see outside of SF. \u00a0From the outside, it looks like a dilapidated building without any signs or indications there's a bar inside ... except for the sounds of the raucous crowd inside at 5pm.  People have clearly discovered this place and yet it still it feels like a discovery. \u00a0The clever pantone drink menu is varied and populated with specialty cocktails.  Our favorities: - Pennies from Heaven (Templeton Rye with sour apple liqueur and sherry) - complex and crisp. \u00a0 - Pantone - (Four Roses Bourbon, Combier, Kummel, beet, ginger and lemon) - looks like a smoothie but also pleasantly complex with a taste of pepper that travels from your tongue to your throat.  Good but a notch below: - Gypsy Tan (Rittenhouse rye with fernet, ginger and Erdinger Weissbier) - light and clean taste with some carbonation) - Baby Turtle (Tequila Ocho resposado tequila with grapefruit, cinnamon and egg white) - also nice but a little too sweet for my personal preference  Skip: - Alligator Alley (Olive oil-infused bourbon) - way overpowering. \u00a0Felt like I was drinking diluted olive oil - Vintage Photo (Flor de Cana rum with banana liqueur) - tasted like medicine  After a few hours, we actually decided to eat dinner upstairs, where there is waiter service and a few tables.  Standouts in terms of food were the cracklins (fried pork belly pieces), the thrice-cooked fries and the Brawn tacos (with crispy headcheese which added a nice creamy and buttery texture). \u00a0The tartare was also good (not really raw but cooked sous-vide).  Things that sounded better than they tasted were the kale salad (I love kale in general but thought it could have been more seasoned here or made in to kale chips instead), the scotch eggs (also love these in general but the version here was somewhat bland) and the trick dog (just ok).  Even though it gets packed, I thought the service here was pretty friendly and attentive.",

The #6 (actually much darker in color than the picture implies) was also interesting and was not the least bit sweet. \u00a0The gin base was the most prominent flavor but there was clearly a savory element and a lot more going on, though I could not pinpoint the \"orange,\" \"almond,\" or \"jasmine.\" \u00a0I also did not get any chocolate until the end... There is a milk chocolate covered black/purple olive at the bottom, which sounds disgusting but actually was not! \u00a0 Maybe it's because my taste buds were fried after drinking this drink. \u00a0Or maybe it's just genius.  I wanted to love the #2 but thought it was just \"good\" - too much cranberry for my taste and not enough balsam fir. \u00a0Can't a girl want a drink that tastes like Christmas tree in January? \u00a0The #7 was supposedly very citrusy upon initial taste but then finished with the oatmeal raisin (I only tried a tiny sip and therefore only tasted the upfront citrus and tequila.) \u00a0The #12 was not as good as I had hoped - sure St. George's coffee liqueur is awesome but it overpowered the drink so I couldn't taste scotch, cinnamon, or anything else. \u00a0That marshmallow was pretty cool though.  The Chinese menu is definitely better than the tourist map menu. \u00a0There are more funky one-of-a-kind drinks (not just glorified classic cocktails) that makes it worth the new $13 price tag. \u00a0So give it a try, and don't forget to read your fortune on the coasters! \u00a0Heh...",

This is not Brooklyn circa whenever people cared about Brooklyn, and we are in the Yelp era. There are no hidden \"it\" spots for people \"in the know.\" The person who is \"in the know\" is anyone. And nestled into one hella gentrified block of the mission, your run down store front looks douchey (and hella 90s). You serve $11 cocktails, and your insulting your clientele by pretending that you are trying to get to something \"deeper\" than people who buy $11 cocktails. But that's just my read. \u00a0  About the cocktails. I had a large carnivore theme for the night and ordered the Lion Heart and the Polar Bear.  I really liked the Lion Heart. Mango paired with Scotch was both a new flavor for me and a cool play on the classic wisdom that whiskeys pair with stone fruits. It was balanced and drinkable, without lacking so much structure that you'd want to knock it back in one go. Almost a perfect cocktail. \u00a0  The Polar Bear didn't win me over as well. I think it's super clever and I'll go in on a super clever cocktail. Unfortunately it didn't taste all that great. I thought the mixture of cool mint and warm mezcal would be interesting (I'm also on a mezcal kick in general), and interesting it was...plus the minty white \"Polar Bear\" is cute. It just didn't taste very good.   Further note; bad door experience: The adage \"always keep a line\" should be amended to \"never keep a line of only two.\" I can respect a bar that doesn't want to be too crowded, but if you literally keep only two people waiting outside, you're pissing two people off and not really doing anything for the people inside. Cocktail culture shouldn't mix with technocrats. And since I was one of those two people, you really just stuck me out there to spend two minutes with the part of your bar I like the least.",

    "review_text": "Scotch Egg- #63 on the 2014 7x7 100 Things to Eat Before You Die list.  Trick Dog is right next door to Central Kitchen, and they share a hallway and the bathrooms. I had a coworker visiting the Bay Area, so decided to take him to Trick Dog for fancy modern cocktails and evolved gastropub food. We got there around 6:30pm on a Tuesday night, and were able to get one of the last tables without a reservation. It's pretty cramped in the upstairs dining area, but its a good place to people watch. However, it's pretty loud in there even when the place is half full, so can be difficult to have a conversation. We ordered:  -Scotch Egg (Soft-Boiled Egg, Brandade, Purple Potato Salad, Romesco, $9, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=8aQ51qrGfjvhdzZvv_Qq8g#8aQ51qrGfjvhdzZvv_Qq8g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a>): Yum- the egg was cooked perfectly, and I loved the purple potato salad and romesco. However, I like the classic sausage exterior versus the brandade substitution, but I would still re-order this. -Back: The Trick Dog (House Ground Blend of Chuck, Brisket, Sirloin, Lettuce, Onion, Pickles, Cheddar Cheese, House Sauce, $9). Front: Thrice-Cooked Fries ($5 + $2 Manimal Style) [<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trick-dog-san-francisco?select=8aQ51qrGfjvhdzZvv_Qq8g#Hz8hUdTH17r7krRoHGaxFQ%5D\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tric\u2026</a>: I liked the flavors of the trick dog, but didn't like the bun since it got soggy and started falling apart while I was eating it. The thrice-cooked fries were also good, and I liked the manimal style (similar to In-n-Out's animal style), but I just felt really unhealthy eating it.   Our server was a riot, and I loved that she had a sense of humor, and a little touch of sass. She was great at recommending drinks, and was knowledgeable about the drink menu as well as the food menu. I enjoyed my meal here, and my only complaint would be about the noise level. I would probably come back for drinks, but not for another meal if I wanted to have a conversation with my dining partner(s). Parking in this area is really tough, so give yourself extra time to circle for street parking.",

The layout is a bit of a pain as well when people are sitting right at the bar and you have to shout over them and their friends to order anything. Not the worst problem to have, and the bartenders do their best, but Churchill has a better layout for those trying to order.  The best time to come is after 9pm on a weeknight: you can pretty much have the rule of the roost and the quality in output from the kitchen and bar is at its best.

I remember when they first ditched the famous Pantone styled menu and I thought \"well that was a bad idea\" How wrong have I been. Every change has been a feast for the eyes and the palette. I look forward to each time the season changes as it brings a new menu design along with a cocktail menu to pair with the time of year. Needless to say every time they make a change it's perfect every time. The thing that impressed me on my last trip is the bartenders. \u00a0Not that they never impressed me before but I've never really watched them dealing with customers. I'm pretty easy myself so it went unnoticed but this time I was at the end where I just happened to notice the back and forth between bartender and customer. It's amazing how well they all. (and I mean all of them) deal with the chaos of the bar along with mixing each drink with care and passion. It's an amazing to watch. The food has been spot on as usual during my trips and a number of the staff surprisingly remember me every time I'm there.   I can't say enough amazing things about Trick Dog it simp.... wait I don't want to have to wait for drinks or deal with a line. \u00a0Don't go here it's not what you think! disregard what I am writing it's....

A beautiful restaurant next door that supplies you with food all night, fancy tables upstairs for good conversations, a crowd of late-twenties to early-thirties downstairs by the bar, and tricked out cocktails. The cocktails tended towards the strong and heavy pour, but there were some lighter choices for the ladies.   Some notable tastes of the night:  Fernet ice cream with cocoa nibs, wow McNuggets with amazing spices Witchwood - Honey rum, sherry, etc. Strong(!) but with the aftertaste of maple. This was a favorite with the guys. Baby Turtle - Cinnamon-scented frothy egg whites Night Moves (my favorite) - Spiked coffee with cream and the surprising kick of curry. This one will keep you up all night.  TIP: If there's a line, you can get in through the back by going through the restaurant next door... ;) Just find the path to the restrooms to the left of the restaurant's entrance.",

The vibe in the small industrial-warehouse-turned-bar was good but not great. I actually found the music odd (country). There are is also very little seating, which I assume makes sense when the place is more busy. Finally, every drink is at least $12, and in most cases have less tha 8 oz of liquid.  With all that griping out of the way, I will say that the drinks are pretty darn awesome. I had the Evil Woman, which is probably the most interesting drink of my life. I never would have thought Chile Liqueur would work in a drink, but it was great. My wife's drink also really good.  All in all, I'll probably go back here if invited by a friend, but can't imagine myself suggesting it to friends for a night out drinking.

Drink names by artists such as Elvis Presley, The Kingsmen and The Clash adorn each record.   I guess Pantone has made way for records.   The cocktails were tasty, but the real treat was venturing upstairs into the loft-like second floor dining area and wondering through the choices of small plates. Nothing cost over $12 and everything, and I mean everything, sounded appealing. That doesn't happen very often.   The small plates are ideal for sharing and you could make a meal out of three or four of them. We were intending on being there for a pre-dinner drink, which turned into pre-dinner appetizers because everything sounded intriguing. The scotch eggs encased in brandade were an unusual twist on a pub favorite. We eyed our neighbors' choices and the thrice cooked fries, kale salad and fried green tomatoes all looked delectable.

It's hard to want the place to succeed after that ridiculous video made by the owners on how to spend $1000 in the Mission. Just so incredibly tone-deaf and sadly emblematic of the wave of gentrification surging through the Mission, to name but one neighborhood.  So yeah, on one hand, this place is a bar that has good drinks and a fun, bar-ish atmosphere. But it also represents a \"new\" Mission that many many people don't want.

Our food came before our drinks. Then the waiter was very accusatory when we asked if our drinks were coming soon. Then the couple next to us bumped into our table and spilled water all over me and my beef tartare. The waiter did re-order the beef tartare but he should have comp'd it.

Came here with my friend on a week night and looked around and didn't find anything regarding a wait list so we went upstairs where the seating area is and we were told by a server that it would be about a 40 minute wait even though we didn't see a wait list anywhere. Anyways, we didn't mind the wait so we went back downstairs and my friend ordered drinks while we waited to be called. Some time goes by (I didn't bother to check the time but it didn't feel like 40 minutes) and we were called for our table and we follow our server upstairs.  We ordered the Trick Dog and split Manimal style fries. The Trick Dog is pretty good but I think I've had better burgers. The closest thing I can liken it to is a superior version of the Big Mac; better meat, better cooked, better bun, better sauce but the flavor profile is more or less the same as a Big Mac. I don't mean it as an insult by any means but it's the closest thing that comes to mind.  The Manimal style fries were really good, it had a mayo-based sauce that seems to have paprika and chili powder mixed in for a slight kick but not enough for it to be a significant with an added either lobster or crab flavor in there somehow. Whatever the case may be, they were really good, I definitely recommend them.  I ordered a root beer as well and it was underwhelming. Maybe I was expecting something with more spice or a kick to it but this one just fell flat; it left a very bland aftertaste. It was definitely drinkable but I was expecting something more than a generic root beer taste.  Over all, I enjoyed my experience here but perhaps my expectation was more than it should have been leaving me with wanting more.",

Still, we were having a good time, up until the \"unfortunate incident\"... Daytime on Sunday, 6 people in our group. We ordered a bunch of food and we each had our drink (after already finishing a couple before). We were downstairs, in the \"open\" area. The place was starting to get crowded. We had our space on the counter, where our group was hanging out. We stepped outside to smoke (bad habit!) and left our half-finished food and drinks. We returned to find it all gone, and they gave the space to another group. WTF?! Naturally, we complained. One guy said he'll go talk to someone. So we wait... And wait... Finally, I go up to one of the bartenders who looks like she might be \"in charge\". She gives me attitude, like she has no idea what I'm talking about. The guy who we originally spoke with happens to be passing by. I grab him, and he hesitantly confirms our story. She goes to talk to another bartender. They call over the waiter who cleaned our space. The three of them deliberate for a while. We are still waiting, feeling pretty stupid at this point. Finally, she returns and, acting like they are doing us a HUGE favor, says that they will replace our drinks. OK, great! Except, when they bring them, they're like 20% full... Their excuse: your drinks weren't full when we took them! REALLY?! You effed up, and now you are going to add insult to injury?! And we weren't even asking for our food back! I have NEVER been treated like that, anywhere! I don't care how \"hip\" your place is, that's called being rude! Had they apologized and brought us a full round on the house, like any decent place would have, we would've stayed and kept ordering. We weren't ready to leave yet. But, needless to say, we did. We quickly finished their \"drinks\" and closed our tabs. Each of us left ZERO tip. Some chose to write a few choice words on their bill. I will never go back here.

Made the top 40 bars across the world list, \u00a0Bauer raved about it, and friends couldn't stop hyping the food and drinks. \u00a0So.... we went to experience the amazing-ness ourselves.   First of the drink list is impressive. \u00a0Amazing craft cocktails that cover all areas of liquor selection. The bartenders were friendly, attentive and easy on the eyes. \u00a0Keep in mind these are craft cocktails so they take a few minutes, \u00a0but are well worth the wait. \u00a0Each sip gets better and better. \u00a0We may have ordered 70% of the specialty drinks... Don't judge. \u00a0  The food was beyond incredible. \u00a0We ordered 4 dishes: Ceviche, Fried Chicken, the \"trick dog\" and the kale salad. Portion size was generous, taste was phenominal: not overpowering but diverse and satisfying. With every bite you find a new flavor. There was nothing I didn't like.   Can't wait to go back!",

    "review_text": "(See pics) Review #1335. This is more like someone's loft with Start-up looking crowds who wear fashion sneakers and checker shirts than business shirts with leather shoes. It portrays a casual, fun, very friendly and Mission atmosphere.  The bartenders here know how to make a solid drink. Not a big fan of fizzy drink but theirs were a good starter. Their stronger drinks definitely are way more solid and delicious. The 2 of us had 7 drinks out of the fun paint book so that shows how much we liked them (from smooth to fizzy):  Alligator Alley Vintage Photo Lion Heart Paper Moon Straw Hat Baby Turtle Pantone 7621  We came here on a Tuesday and it was quite busy. Drinks did take about 10 to 15 minutes to arrive early on around 8pm (most drinks do take time to create and the place was more than 75% packed) but got better after 9ish.  The great thing about this place is that you can enjoy a fantastic drink in the well lacquered but keeps rustic feel in the dim light (most standing room except by the bar with seats if you want to eat downstairs.) It's not too loud (not sure about the weekend since it's not that big of a place. Think of a smaller loft.)  Perfect timing as we got hungry after a drink and went upstairs where there's table service with menu.   In between the beams, here comes the light.  There were about 9 to 10 tables and most seat for 2 with a few that fit 4. There's good space between the tables and it actually feels more like a bistro. You left the lively crowd and great background music, and stepped into coziness. The seats were plush comfortable!  Food was decent and the dishes were lounge dish size. We had 6 dishes:  * Raw radish with dehydrated Campari butter dip and house-smoked Moldon sea salt - the trick was the butter.  * Cracklins (pork belly) - the fatty part was good but meat was too dense for my taste  * Beer nuts - turned out I really love beer nuts!  * Scotch egg - smart and artsy looking and was a soft-boiled egg wrapped in brandade served with shaved beet with a side of salmon roe and creme fraiche. The egg was very good but they can totally skip the beets that was too overwhelming. Everything else looked more like garnish than a side.  * TrickDog - the trick was the sirloin, chuck and brisket, and that aioli with stronger mustard and really good pickles. This felt right home in the Mission style - greased up and absorbing all the alcohol that made you so hungry in the previous 2 hours.  * Brussels sprouts were not the totally crispy style but softer. This actually was my preferred style.  Trick Dog is right next to Central Kitchen and they even share the bathroom. No sign and you will literally pass right by and thought it was part of Central Kitchen. Do like the fact that it's not on Valencia side and it gives this place a more neighborhood feel.",

When we finally got a spot at the bar, we let loose and ordered a bunch of items.  We got these items: 1) scotch egg - soft-boiled egg, brandade, beet confit, salmon roe, cr\u00e8me fraiche 2) the trick dog - house ground blend of chuck, brisket &amp; sirloin, lettuce, onion, pickles, cheddar cheese, house sauce 3) thrice-cooked fries - manimal style 4) grandma's sweater - beefeater 24 gin, zucca rabarbaro, blood orange, lime, mint, bitter lemon soda, served long 5) pennies from heaven - templeton rye, amaro meletti, leopold brothers sour apple liquer, amontillado sherry, the bon vivants' gold rush bitters, served up  Everything was good and we were too full for ambulation immediately afterwards. The drink menu is very creative and the drinks themselves were unique/flavorful. I like how the employees wear like 1850's railroad worker outfits--that's what they remind me of at least. There's a place upstairs with tables for food/drink service, but good luck getting a seat promptly because there's only like 8 of them and 50 other parties want to the same thing. There are no reservations (I think).  This is a nice little trendy joint.",

A good 30 min wait for a table but decent standing room downstairs (a plus for the hooks under the table top to hang your coats and purse, us bag ladies truly appreciate you *cue Erykah Badu music*).  A nod for the Pantone inspired drink menu, HELLA artsy fartsy. First glance I was confused at what I was reading.... Words next to the familiar \"rum/brandy/bitters\" had no meaning to me. So I ordered based on pantone color and drink name... It was a yellow-orange tone by the name of Lion Heart (familiar words like mango was on the list, totally in the mood for something fruity). Overall, it was pretty good. Cute little wine glass (I'm not a glass connoisseur obviously) with a strawberry varnish. I ordered 2, not drunk but I was definitely talking more.  As for the food... Ordered the rice plate (pork, with fried sticky rice, mushrooms with fish sauce). It was good, wish the rice cake was bigger because after it was gone, the dish was too salty for my liking. Also ordered brussel sprouts, very good as a side to another item, but not as a standalone dish... then this is where the Asian side of me hurt a bit... I didn' finish my food, figured I'd take the rest to go but the waitress took the plates and they were gone, forever... NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

More than just being a bar, Trick Dog makes mouthwatering cocktails they've perfected down to a science. Literally, they make their own licorice/cinnamon flavored bitters on site! Their dedication to the purity and sophistication of every ingredient is evidenced in their paint-swatch themed menu. Not only is it a clever touch, but a great way to remember what the hell you actually ordered.  I'm sure this bar will be disparaged as pretentious. It is very pretentious, of course, right down to the ultra-modern interior and \"mixologist\" bartenders who probably inspired that sketch on Portlandia.

Too bad I was unable to try the drinks, but the sheer number of people downstairs having a good time is proof enough that their drinks must be solid.  We went here mostly for the food, which was delicious! Started off with the chips and guac, which was a whoppin' price of $7.00. I definitely do not recommend this as neither the chips, nor the guac were worth that price, in my opinion. The highlight of the meal was the beef \"tartare,\" which was made with sous vide sirloin and had a raw egg yolk on top. The idea of doing a sous vide tartare is absolutely genius and would appeal to those who are a bit scared of trying fully raw meat.  Other highlights include the trick dog, which is cooked to a nice medium rare. We also go the rice plate, which was good, but nothing too memorable. The best part on that plate was the rice cake! We tried out the thrice cooked fries- manimal style of course- and that was good and quite filling. Lastly, we ordered some fish tacos (which came out to be around $4 a taco), which were perfectly crisp and flavorful.  Overall, the food is quite good and the atmosphere is nice. While some dishes like the tartare, trick dog, tacos were definite hits, the guac, fries, and rice plate were just ok. Make sure you get there early to secure a seat!

I met Josh Harris, one of three partners at Trick Dog, at The Hideout in the Mission while he was bar tending about 3 years ago. I had always admired Josh's skills behind the bar and had heard him speak about his concept for a bar that he wanted to open in the lower Mission with his friends/partners Jason Henton and Scott Baird (aka The Bon Vivants).   The interior is rustic and warm with a great mix of hand made light fixtures and furnishings. It also offers a bit of the industrial touch with its high ceilings and exposed beams. The vibe is very welcoming with a good sized bar on the lower level and tables on the loft level upstairs which are designated for eating. A very attractive and clever use of space was made part of their bar by having sliding walls that hold a great selection of spirits within them. The food menu offers some great comfort foods and a selection of healthier options like their kale salad which I love.  The service here is great and I'm always a huge fan of places that have the \"personal touch'. This place is a stand out in this category and I hope it continues during its lifetime.   This is a great addition to a great part of town and I hope to be there often.  Salute!",

This is true for most bars in the Mission, I think, but it was definitely more pronounced at Trick Dog.  The first time I went, it was on a Wednesday around 4, so the place was nicely empty and I could have an awesome convo with my friends. We ordered a ton of things on the menu, but my favorite was clearly The Centerfold, with bourbon and peaches.   The next time I came it was a late Saturday night, and I could barely get into the door. My friends and I managed to wedge ourselves by the stairs, and then fought the crowd for 20 minutes to get one of the Bon Vivant's attention. We finally did, and we were able to find some space near the path to the bathroom to hang out. I was bummed that the Centerfold was gone that night - I'm not sure if it's ever coming back or if it's just seasonal - but I enjoyed the Ain't No Sunshine in its place, and that's coming from someone who doesn't always love tequila.

Flip books are great for visual comparisons; not so much for textual ones.  -The vibe is not 'mellow'. The music is loud; it's crowded. There's a bouncer. You might get hit on. \u00a0 -But, it's not a dancing bar. It's a standing-or-sitting-down bar - like a house party at peak hours. Lots of standers.  I can't imagine myself hanging around for a few drinks' worth - it's not a nurse-and-converse kind of place. Make it a punchy pregame, or a lively ladies' night instead, and you won't be disappointed.",

Layers of tastes and good citrusy punch.  The dishes are also quite good. We got the scotch eggs, rice crisp and fries.  The scotch eggs are solid with runny yold inside. A bit pricey, but worth trying.  Rice cake was very Asian (Korean) so it wasn't a big surprise but still the use of white kimchi balances flavor out quite well.  Recommended!",

I am certainly not here to say that what I do is exactly right; in fact, I'm here to say that *most* of what I do is not exactly right. Trick Dog's exactitude -- the bonsai clipping, Le Mot Juste, Daniel Day Lewis-styled precision -- is the craftsmanship that has me inspired to do things right. It has Tom Ford floored when he walks in the door with Martin Scorsese and they look at one another and feel miserable that they haven't crafted a completely immersive experience like this.   Movies can emote, mirror, reflect and project our lives. The perfect suit can cloak us from what we're afraid of or what we look forward to. A bar. What does a bar do? A bar is where you come alive, where you -- and many others -- have died. A bar is a place where strangers can mourn that loss, can celebrate a new beginning. A bar is where I've fallen in love, where I've seen others do so to. Where ideas bound as ceaselessly as the clang of rinsed spoons. A bar is an opportunity for a talented set of individuals to come together to craft a complete evening for one person to experience the full range of human emotion who walks in the door alone (like myself), and that they have done here In Full.  And a bar like this... with everything so delicately cared for, from the many times mentioned color-coordinated stool set, Pantone menu and cocktail blush... a bar like this with its care is like walking on a film set, and on this set someone called \"Action!\" to see one man look at another man to say \"I don't even give a damn about the cocktails.\" The other man replied: \"It's not about giving a damn about the cocktails, the lighting, the food, the stools, the location or anything else. It's about giving a damn.\" That's what Trick Dog is doing here: it's about giving a damn.",

The bottom floor is the bar. \u00a0The waitress was pretty sassy to be quite honest. We had to ask the other waiter to flag her down a few times. It didn't really bother me though. The burger looked interesting. It's on a wide hot dog bun with a long burger in it. It reminded me of a backyard burger at a BBQ, but twenty times better. They have a different kind of sauce that is amazing on the burger. We also go manimal fries. They're kind of like a fancy, less intense animal styler fries from In-N-Out. They were pretty good but not as good as In-N-Out.  We also got drinks with out meals. I can't for the life of me remember what they were called but man were they strong and delicious!",

And, more importantly, how did they know it would be so delicious? The drinks are based off of astrology signs, and they're pretty damn complex, but the mixologists here are ridonk. Very professional and very courteous. It takes a while to get a drink, so be patient, but man, it's not expensive at all, and they make damn good cocktails here. The only bad thing about this place is that it gets way over capacity, and so it's super stuffy and packed. Other than that, this place is great.  There's no signage, so do like Psych, and look for a pineapple on the door. No joke.",
