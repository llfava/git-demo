    "review_text": "The nite I came here, it had the most random groups of people I have ever had the pleasure of being in a bar with.  But first- the service. The Bartenders were fantastic. It was obvious that there were regulars at the bar upon entrance, but the 'tenders made you feel welcome and were open to high-fives and pounds should the hand gestures be called for during bar banter. Beers are cheap, from what I remember all less than $5. Cash only, but there is an ATM machine. Drinks were stiff. And the pizza! THE PIZZA. We ordered 2 large pepperoni and sausage pizzas, at about $17 each. (I think. Drinks were stiff. I mentioned that, yeah?) These thin crusted pizzas aren't frozen, kids. They are made fresh on the spot and will remind you of New York pizza at first but will then make you proud that you are in fact eating this fantabulous piece of heaven in SAN FRANCISCO. You will look around and be like...where.are.we.again? Jay'n Bee Club. Don't get it twisted. Home of the obscure magical pizzas. There is a menu with fun names of available pizzas, but I was too far gone to remember. Sorry, Yelp. But I'll tell you what I DO remember. The patrons there that nite!  At the bar: The regulars. The Cliffs, The Norms, the Jack Trippers and Janets' and Chrissys'. Off to one side, near the pool table, were younger, frat-ish boys. At a table nearby, a group of Asians. Out at the back patio, a group of Mexican guys. (don't worry, we clarified.) Then you had my friends and I - 1 Argentinian, 1 Salvadorean, 1 White, 1 Black, and 1 Filipina. The whole bar was a walking United Colors of Benetton ad.  As I looked through their jukebox song choices, a frat boy yells to his friend: \"Hey PANSY u gonna buy this chick a drink or do I have to make out with her for you too, bro?! Frat boy then turns to me and says, \"What you havin, fancy face?\"  At the Asian table, they were ON one. Red-faced (as was I) and havin a great time, they started belting out Adele. \"We coulda have it awwww....roarin in the deeeee-heeeee...\"  I walked out to the back patio, to where the rest of my friends were. They were talkin Niners with the Mexican guys. One of the guys said, \"Just watch, we're gonna take the NFC West!\" (and several weeks later, we did.) Then one of the guys starts waving his beer around and starts singing: \"Weeeee are the Champyons, my frennzzzz...\"  Now see. You can't put me around singing people. Cuz I will join you. I was almost roarin in the deep with the Asians, but this time, I couldn't resist. \"......and we'lllllll keep on fighting..till the end...\"  All of us now: \"We.Are.The.Champions. We!Are!The!Champions!\" Cue a few frat boys who enter the back patio: \"No time for loooosers cuz weeee are the Champions...\"  Enter Asians: \"Of da worrrr!!!!\"  True Story.",

GAH!)  Now, really, this alone makes it cool. Who doesn't love a great neighborhood bar? A place where you can wander in any old night, chat with some chill people from your 'hood, get really shitty, catch a ball game, stumble out, do a faceplant and land in your bed, yada yada...  But the cool factor is a direct corollary of how cool said neighbors are, let us not forget. And when the joint is jumpin' on a Sunday night because the majority of the neighbors ARE that cool, but then that one guy has to come in from next door and ask for the music to be turned down at 11:00...

Actually I lived right down the street, so my review may be a bit skewed over the fact that I was able to get thunderously drunk and still make it back home-- lightening quick.   This place is is a neighborhood bar in the truest sense, meaning that by 12:30 you won't find many people there who don't live close by. The friendly patrons and eccentric bartenders are the selling point. Drunken conversations about everything from the state of the economy, Anthony Weiners schlong to urban farming can be had, and by people who can actually hold a conversation without leering at you all bleary eyed speaking with a play-doh tongue. The female bartender, an older woman with dirty blond hair and wouldn't you believe her name escapes me, is MILF-tastic. The food thy serve is relatively cheap and reasonably tasty. Nothing extraordinary, typical bar fare. But when things get a bit stuffy or when you need to smoke a fag there is the outside patio, though it ain't shit compared to the now shuttered Eagle Taverns outdoor patio. There is a pool table located in the main barroom, a bit of a squeeze, but seeing as this place never sees more than fifteen people at once it shouldn't be a problem for you.",

What happened...  Having already had dinner I suggested we get a pie to go, &amp; then have it for breakfast the next day. \u00a0The true test of great pizza (&amp; Chinese food) is how good it still is the next morning. \u00a0  My expectations were not very high. \u00a0Again, this is not my first rodeo. \u00a0The following morning I was running late &amp; could only take a couple bites of it as I was out the door. \u00a0I didn't even have time to heat it! \u00a0I haphazardly wrapped a couple slices in a paper towel w the intention of eating them in a somewhat civilized way when I got to my destination. \u00a0That went out the window fast...

Pool table? \u00a0Check.  Backyard area? \u00a0Check.  Jukebox? \u00a0Check.  Bartender willing to \"put the game on?\" \u00a0Check.  If there's ONE thing about the bar which could rub people the wrong way it's that it's VERY chummy. \u00a0The owners and patrons have known each other a long while (not everyone, but an obvious crew), so if you're in there say on a Saturday afternoon you might feel like you're not in on the joke, or that it's a more a Social Club. \u00a0Which is fine if you're into that, and I am.  I'll take \"chummy\" over fix-geared hipster any day. \u00a0And those are limited too, which is also nice.  Nothing quite like a brand new SF Giants fan who walks in during the 3rd, and out in the 7th...  It's a bit off the beaten path, but I walk there from Guerrero because it's WORTH it.

I did have a couple tacos, and they were delicious. I would give a 2 based solely on the mixed drink factor, but the vibe and food pushed the needle up to a 3.",

The thing about J'n B that's unique to me is that it has such a divey ambiance, and people drink hard here, probably more than they eat, it's just not really a place I would expect such bomby pizza to come from.   Though usually overrun with regulars and locals, J'n B is welcoming to new folks, the bar tender has chopped it up with me and my friends on multiple occasions.",

We ordered a couple pizzas and a couple large salads. They came out pretty quickly and I was impressed by the quality of the pizza. Everyone enjoyed the food and drinks, had a great time.

A strong statement, I know, but it was so amazing to me... I ATE half a whole pizza- true fact!! Why is this better than Toto's or Costco or that pseudo thin crust NY style pizza I had at NY NY LV?   The key thing that did it for me was the fact that the pizza was doused in extra tomato sauce. Anything tomato-ey wins me over, hence my profile name.  Toppings- fresh and not abundantly greasy.  The flavor- never bland The crust- on the thinner side, I don't like it thick. Just enough to enjoy all the toppings without getting too full from all that unnecessary flour.   The guys behind the counter are really personable and chit chat with you for a bit. They are very welcoming and are really observant with who comes and goes. Beer and pizza were all under $25. Cash only. I rave about this place to all my friends and will definitely bring them in. I'd love to see this place stick around foreverrrrr.",

The margaritas were good, the music varies because of the jukebox, and there's a cute back patio area with \"a\" heated lamp (yes, just one). \u00a0My favorite part of the night, was the food. \u00a0My friends and I ordered enchiladas and tacos, and our orders came with rice/beans/salad, with complimentary chips &amp; guacamole. \u00a0The food is a little pricey but prepared to order (I watched them make it) by a small team of Mexican women in the back kitchen and it tastes very much homemade and it's not greasy. \u00a0I finished everything on my plate and wanted more...so I would say the portion sizes are decent, but if you're hungry, go with two enchiladas instead of one. \u00a0  We arrived at 8pm and staked out a table for about 30 minutes...so I would suggest going early or going at 10pm when it clears out again and seating is more available. \u00a0Also, if you want to order food, you get a menu and order your food at the kitchen door and they'll ask you where you're sitting and bring your meal to you.",

Having a real soft spot for grandparents in my heart, I wanted to recreate the image of this guy on the bar stool, so I purposely arrived a few minutes early. \u00a0  Jay'n Bee is my kind of bar. It immediately struck me as a happy place, where the drinks are stiff and the people are happy. \u00a0I ordered a pint for $4, and sat and sipped and imagined what this place was like 40 years ago. \u00a0  I bet it hasn't changed too much- except that the crowd might be younger, a little more lively, and the music might be louder. \u00a0The sports games are on flat-screens, and the liquor selection includes every flavor of vodka imaginable. But the sign out front looks original, as does the bar. \u00a0And it exudes that friendly, neighborhood vibe.  I wish I would have ordered a vodka rocks. \u00a0After my first beer, my friends arrived, and one of them ordered a vodka soda. \u00a0I guess it's a slight modification of the original. I left happy, promising myself that if I ever lived nearby, I'd make this a regular spot.",

    "review_text": "I went to Jay n bee because it was a convenient location to my next stop, needed a bite and a drink and had read good things from other yelpers. \u00a0It did not meet up to the reviews I read. First off sat down and when no waitress appeared after 20 minutes, a request from the bar tender as well a \u00a0free beverage as an apology from him, she finally came over with menus, chips and salsa and an apology. Okay, I can deal with that since the chips were clearly homemade and hot as well the salsa, although a bit mild,was homemade. So another 20 minutes later and another basket of chips and a finished beverage still no sign of the wet burrito I ordered. Finally, I went to the kitchen entrance where the waitress stood and asked what was going on. She apologized and said there was nothing she could do about it, \u00a0but my food was on it's way. So after at least 50 minutes my food arrived. \u00a0I ordered a pork chile verde super burrito which has enchilada sauce on it. It was mild and tasty, but relatively small for the price ($6.75) considering being in the general Mission area and the wait. As well there was very little meat in it. When the waitress delivered the very tardy meal she let me know, \"It always takes a long time here. The kitchen staff doesn't prep, but does everything to order\", funny they weren't that busy. So in the end I have to keep in mind it is primarily a bar and if you out for some cocktails you would probably just be thankful to be able to order some food and not mind the very long wait since you are hanging out to drink or shoot pool any way. Now I know, maybe some chips n salsa with my cocktails is the only expectation to have at this otherwise convenient neighborhood dive.",

UPDATE: \u00a0It's lost a star since it appeared on \"Check, Please! Bay Area\" because the quality has slipped slightly while the prices have increased.

Food: Marta's Kitchen is honestly some of the best Mexican food I've ever had, and I've lived in the Mission off and on since 1992. And: homemade chips with excellent salsa.  Hours: Closed Sunday nights! How weird is that? It's OK, though.  Patio: present, pleasant. I rarely go out there though, because I like the window seat that looks out on 20th St.  Pool table: present -- though blocking ATM and bathrooms.  I have never had a better stumble-home-from bar.
