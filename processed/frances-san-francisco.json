    "review_text": "Not your typical, pretentious Michelin-rated restaurant! We were 30 minutes early to our reservation, but they seated us promptly. The server was friendly and helpful, but not overbearing.  They had a liver mousse special that day and of course we said yes - delicious! It came with toast and jam (but I forgot what the jam was.)  We LOVED the dungeness crab risotto and chocolate almond 'clafloutis.'  The one dish we could pass was the wheat flour crepe crespelles. I didn't want a very heavy dinner so I ordered this was my main entree. It tastes... healthy... for lack of a better way to describe it.  Overall, the meal wasn't that expensive at all and we were pretty happy when the bill came out - especially since we ordered so many dishes. The restaurant is very cute and quaint and reminds me a lot of Europe.  Highly recommended date location!",

    "review_text": "I happened to be in the Castro with a friend and decided to see if we could score any kind of seating at Frances. There were two seats left at the counter wedged in a corner that looked painfully confining. However, luck was on our side and they had a no-show reservation (always rude) and we got the two person table up at the front.  My friend started with the beet salad, which he said was good. I only tried the base which seemed like a cottage cheese relative. I had the bacon beignets (5 of them) and at first they seemed rather salty, but when the creme fraiche was put on - it all came together. My friend tried them and said they were better than the beet salad.  My friend had the steak for the entree and I had the duck breast. The duck breast was perfectly cooked, but what made the dish was the kale, kuri squash, rome apple and huckleberries. What am amazing combination! I tried my friend's steak and it seemed very good as well. We also were served butter bean ragout. And that was so very good as well.  Alas, we did not have room for dessert although I wanted to. Next time, I would order the bacon beignets to split and then order one dessert instead of two small starters.  Verdict: a Michelin one-star restaurant that actually lives up to the hype unlike say La Costanera. Looking forward to trying it again in the future.",

I feel bad for giving this place 3 stars because I feel like maybe I'm missing something. For a lot of San Franciscans, Frances is THE restaurant. People enjoy it and keep coming back and absolutely rant and rave about this place. Maybe my expectations were just too high. I'm not really sure, but I haven't given up on this place at all. I would still return and give it another shot. Maybe because I'm convinced that I can still have the same experience as all the others who have written these 4 and 5 star reviews.

    "review_text": "Fantastic dinner. We love to eat out, so when we visit San Fran, it's about the restaurants. Frances is one of our favorites now. Tonight we had a variety of small plates instead of the traditional app and entree - we had bacon beignets (blissful, light, smokey), duck liver mousse (amazing balance of flavors with the sweet jam and cippolini onions), the calamari salad with garbanzos - wow! These were our favorites. Also had the onion and ramp soup - creamy and lovely, the squid ink pasta (delicious, maybe a little salty, but better when you don't miss out on the garlic laden sauce at the bottom), the roasted cabbage (very tasty, but not as much a stand-alone as a side, and by that point, too full to enjoy. Oh yes - the turnip empanadas with salsa verde were very good! Great service, beautiful place (we made a 5pm reservation about a month and a half in advance and were able to sit at one of the tables that was separate from the line of very close tables, so it was extra nice to not be crowded). If I could change anything it would be the pacing - the food came out in waves, but very close together - we would have liked 5 or 10 minutes in between to let it settle and drink some wine, etc. It felt a tad rushed, and were out in only an hour - would have liked more time and would have run up the wine bill more. Don't miss the cocktails - we had the Matthiasson Vermouth and the Cava with huckleberry. The Cava was delicious, but the Matthiasson was truly unique and memorable. Will track that down in the future. The Josey Baker bread is not to be missed, and we loved the house white by the oz. - what a neat idea to pay only for what you had. Can't wait to recommend this place to others",

    "review_text": "My wife and I were lucky enough to nab an early dinner here on the fly with open table to celebrate our 14th anniversary. \u00a0The place had a line even before the doors were opened. \u00a0We believe the line was mainly for those who didn't make a reservation, as the time we got back the entire bar was pretty much filled already. \u00a0We were welcomed right away by the friendly host, and actually had a choice of seats during this early hour. \u00a0We grabbed a cozy corner spot. \u00a0They offer their own blended house red and white wines by the ounce which is served in a graduated carafe. \u00a0I had the red, which was quite good. \u00a0They also filter their own water, and offer it in sparkling or still.  We started with the applewood smoked bacon beignets (piping hot and smoky flavor is well complimented with their maple creme fraiche with chives), Pannise Frites / chickpea fritters (reminded me of textures from a creamy fried tofu - nice), the chicken liver mousse was my fav (served with toast smeared with sweet date butter), then broke into the little gems salad (sweet roasted beets, blue cheese, buttermilk vinagerette, hazelnuts), and the fried green tomatoes (fried with a light layer of corn meal batter (yum). \u00a0For our entree's, we had the northern halibut (moist and flaky with summer squash, butter beans, and manila clams), and the five dot ranch bavette steak (bordelaise sauce was perfect compliment along with the turkey figs, porcini mushrooms, and potato gnocchi).  We were very satisfied and full at this point, but were tempted to go for the dessert (they feature humphrey slocombe ice creams!)... We decided to skip and go for dessert later in the evening (since we we ready to roll out of the restaurant by now). \u00a0But, then they surprised us with a dish of complimentary sweets (chocolate + sugar cookies, and some tiny sweet corn cakes, not to mention a lit candle for our 14th anniversary)!  Service was impeccable, and friendly. \u00a0I definitely recommend this place to anyone in search of a good foodie experience. \u00a0Now I know why they are rated one of the ten best restaurants in America...",

    "review_text": "I currently have my \"break-up playlist 2010\" playing in the background.  Why?  Because Frances and I are done with. I've waited two whole months for this reservation and now, it's over. done. finished. finito. I keep replaying the most awesome non-home-cooked-meal of my life over and over again in my head and the two girls I went with today are probably doing the same. (shout out to you, Debra. and to you too, Debra.)  First off, even though the place is small and you're literally about 1 foot away from the tables next to you, it's perfect. I think the setting is personal and I love the way it looks. When we got there today there were already a bunch of people waiting outside for them to open. Mind you, I made a reservation August 22nd, and the nearest Friday that had a spot open was the 15th of October. We were greeted immediately and were able to choose where we wanted to sit.  The three of us got a market shot that was made with cantaloupe juice and some various other juicy bits. And then spiked. OH. YEAH. I also got the summer fizz that included a bunch of unidentifiable yummies. Very refreshing though.   We decided to share a couple of the bouches and appetizers. We got the applewood smoked bacon beignets and the chickpea fritters. Those bacon beignets were awesome. Crispy and fluffy, soft and bacon-y, what's not to love? Although I will say this. Those chickpea fritters just stumped me. What a delicate little falafel you are! That's what it reminded me of. But times 1,000,000.   For appetizers we shared the gnocchi which were really good, and this roasted pear and pancetta salad. That salad was like a punch in the mouth. It woke you RIGHT up. It really didn't look like much, but once you put it in your mouth you're like @_@. or :O. or O_O. or :D. It was an amazingly balanced salad that hit every part of your tongue.   A friend of mine got the saffron risotto, another got the soul food chicken, and I got the watson farm lamb with the roasted eggplant, cherry tomatoes, and salsa verde. The girls absolutely loved their dishes, but I can't speak for them.  My lamb was perfect. I've never ever had lamb done so well. HOW YOU GONNA COOK IT THREE WAYS?!?! It completely just blew me out of the water. I think the top pieces of lamb were sous vide, and they were just melt in your mouth lamb-y goodness.   We were all really full at this point, like almost stuffed, but really, we couldn't leave without trying dessert. We got the honey panna cotta with the pluots on top. Absolutely delicious. What a panna cotta should be. Creamy and smooth and just scrumptious. But honestly, I gotta rave about those rosemary cookies.  WHO WOULDA THUNK ROSEMARY BELONGED IN SHORTBREAD COOKIES?! NOT I. The smell of rosemary was pretty intense, (and mind you I love that scent.) but when you bit into it it was such a subtle flavor. I could have used like seven of those cookies with a glass of milk and I would have been perfectly fine.   Honestly with the quality of food that this place is busting out, I feel like their prices are completely reasonable, if not on the low side. We were by far the youngest people in there, and not once did we feel unwelcomed. Everyone was sweet and kind and patient and I am soOOOOOooooo sad it's over. I need to put in another reservation before the year is over because this restaurant is an amazing little jewel in the castro, and I will forever love this place.  Shout out to Kosta, our server. You're the man. And PATRICK, thanks for giving us your card. As I watched people come in he greeted and hugged various different people and that's what I loved. How it was like everyone just knew everyone and it was just all so very personal.  Frances, I'm going to be back. And you're going to take me back!",

Tip: It's probably better to make a reservation before going. \u00a0We were \"walk ins\" so we had to wait about 20 minutes before they seated us at the bar. \u00a0Then again someone just told me it's hard to get a reservation so...um...take your pick? \u00a0Maybe we got lucky because it was a weekday.",

The food was very good - I want to say \"terrific\" but each dish missed the mark ever so slightly [squeezes two fingers together]. \u00a0We started with the winter vegetable croquettes, which were lovely: warm, flavorful and not in the least greasy (they are quickly deep-fried). \u00a0My wife had the beet salad, which she loved, and I had the squid linguine with bottarga, which, for me, was the hit of the evening.  It was the main courses where the kitchen stumbled: I had the duck with potato confit, escarole and grape mostarda and, as delicious as it was, the addition of the grapes added a somewhat dissonant note, as if that one extra touch was one touch too many. \u00a0Likewise, my wife had the crab risotto with celery root confit and it was served with celery leaves, making the dish far more about the celery than the crab, which, being delicate, was kind of lost in the mix. \u00a0Again, it was that one extra touch being one touch too many.  I'd definitely return - the pluses far, far outweigh the minuses - but I'd like the kitchen to self-edit just a bit and let the ingredients speak more loudly for themselves. \u00a0Taken alone each ingredient in the dishes was wonderful but the \"extra\" wound up dis-incorporating dishes that should have been spectacular.",

Sometimes the greatest things lie in the details and this could not have held more true at Frances. \u00a0Delicious, fresh-baked Rustic Levain from Acme Bread came quickly and I joked that it was so soft that a holding a piece reminded me of a little accordion (sorry...haha). \u00a0To go with this, we ordered the house red and wine uniquely served at $1/oz in slender bottles with 2 oz markings - both very impressive especially considering they're house varieties.  The meal started off with Baked Cherrystone Clams and Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets. \u00a0They were both nicely done and hats off must be given to that Maple Chive Creme Fraiche, it worked so well with...everything and I found myself dunking bread into it the entire time.  The first star of the meal was the Spugnole Pasta. \u00a0Its herbacious and earthy flavors were amazing and I couldn't help but savor every single bite. \u00a0The similes didn't stop at accordions as Michelle likened the pasta's texture to a \"slinky over her tongue.\" \u00a0Our main dish came in the form of Local King Salmon - perfectly cooked and brightened by smoked baby beets and creme fraiche.  We would never let ourselves live it down without trying the 'Lumberjack' Cake and we were so glad because it was freakin' delicious! \u00a0The richer sweetness of the dates and dark fruits was balanced by the cake's exquisitely airy texture. \u00a0Let's not forget to mention the accompanying Maple-Walnut ice cream sourced from Humphrey Slocombe that had \"win\" written all over it.  Frances fully deserves its Michelin star with fantastic food, wonderful ambiance and some of the most personable staff I've met yet =D",

Loved the Japanese like platewear which added a sophisticated touch - Service: impeccable. Friendly server who steered us in the right ordering direction when we were on the fence - Grilled calamari: most tender I've ever had with little pieces embodying such a delectable grill flavor. Amazing how they did that. Other versions I've had were good but definitely with a stiffer chewier texture  - Duck: best cooked duck I've had. Tender, meaty, with just a perfect bit of skin on each piece. Sitting on top of a delectable jus and a few waxy beans, was spectacular. \u00a0 - Pasta: spugnoli and sausage. I don't even like mushrooms but fell in love with these thin squiggly trumpets accompanied by a how-did-this-much-flavor-get-into-it-could-drink-\u00adit-on-its own jus  - Bevette steak: incredibly tender, almost like a cross between a standard full steak and short ribs - Brussels sprouts: loved the addition of chopped hazelnuts and plump multi-colored raisins - Affogato: boozy version with bitters in addition to espresso the hub loved  Midlights: - Bacon beignets: fluffy smokey but bit too salty for me  Lowlights - Tables too close together: almost elbow distance so couldn't help but hear conversations from both sides and getting out was a challenge, as the table had to be moved out - Single bathroom for all: bit of waiting at times  My kind of place: excellent food, comfortable, classy, and friendly. Wasn't disappointed and would return.",

The menu is seasonal, but if you ever see duck as an option, get it. Seriously. Also, don't forget to order the applewood smoked bacon beignets. You'll never see beignets the same way ever again.  Seating is kept to a minimal to keep the ambience on a more intimate scale, so reservations are a must (at least 3-4 weeks ahead of time). Only parties of 4 max are welcomed. If you're lucky, you can grab one of the 10 barstool open seats available the second they open their doors. Expect a long wait if you miss the first seating, but fear not, keep yourself company with a glass of their delicious house wine creatively charged by the ounce.",

    "review_text": "I am really giving Frances 4.5 stars but rounding up to 5 stars because they made some amazing dishes.  For my beverage, I ordered the white wine by the ounce. I love the concept and I am always on the border about ordering another glass. Now I can add 2oz at a time and not feel too guilty. \u00a0  We started off with the bacon beignets. Alone, they are pretty good but dipping it in the maple creme fraiche and chive counters that the heaviness of the dish. So addicting!   Another bouchees we ordered was the panisse frites. This was definitely one of those items \"you must get\". It had a nice crispy fried outer shell and is super soft in the inside. Once you dip this into the lemon and olive aioli, all the flavors and textures tingle in your mouth. Zesty! Crispy! Creamy!.... 7x7: Please add this to the top 100 list of things to try before you die!  For appetizers, we had the leek and spinach soup and the chicken liver mousse. The soup is very creamy and rich. It was a nice palette cleanser after eating all the fried food. The mousse was another dish that blew me away. It comes pre-spread with like medjool dates jam. Add the mousse and some of the frisee. More explosion into you mouth. The mousse had a subtle taste of coffee, then the sweetness of the dates, and lastly the crisp and crunch of the frisee and toast. \u00a0  For my entree, I had the halibut with chorizo and butter beans. The fish was cooked nicely, flaky and not dry at all. The other items on the dish didn't bring this to the next level. This was somewhat disappointing considering everything I ate before was awesome. Also had a side of butterball potatoes which was cooked perfectly in creme fraiche.  For desert, I had to try the lumberjack cake (#92 on the top 100 list of things to eat before you die) and some blue bottle coffee. Imagine a carrot cake made with apples instead of carrots and instead of the frosting, it had maple black walnut ice cream from Humphry Slocumbes over medjool dates. Another great dish to end the evening.",

    "review_text": "I would say that it is pretty rare to find a one-star Michelin restaurant hiding in such a small and quiet neighborhood in the Castro. Prior to dinner, I didn't know about the Michelin star; I only heard that Frances was a relatively new up-and-coming restaurant with rave reviews headed by a rising chef with multiple James Beard award nominations. Those types of accolades would pique anyone's interest. We arrived ten minutes before opening and already two customers had stopped by to pick up or buy gift certificates. Without any reservations, we were in luck and quickly seated at the first table. Within five minutes another person came in to buy a gift certificate. The waiter commented that they had sold over $10,000 worth in the past week. Award nominations and Michelin stars aside, that is pretty impressive for any restaurant. I was excited to try what Frances had to offer.   With such a small and ever-changing nightly menu, it was easier for us to eat family-style so we ordered three out of the four entrees on the day's menu. Dinner started off with bouch\u00e9es (French for gourmet mouthful). We tried the famous applewood-smoked bacon beignets. The bacon flavor was subtle and not overpowering with a crisp exterior, but a doughy interior. I had hoped that it would be light and fluffy only to be a bit disappointed. On the up side, I really enjoyed the slightly sweet maple cr\u00e8me fraiche &amp; chive dip that complimented the beignets.   For entr\u00e9es, we shared the Five Dot Ranch bavette steak, the California black cod, and the Liberty Farm duck breast. Presentation was beautiful and each dish looked quite enticing. First, I tried the steak and immediately found it to be too chewy and slightly undercooked. Despite that, the accompanying vegetables, the farro ragout, maitakes and fava greens were well-seasoned and perfectly cooked. The duck breast was a much better dish. It had an almost Asian influence, but you wouldn't be able to tell with Italian butter beans, braised chicories, and Sicilian olives. I could appreciate that the olives weren't as overpowering in flavor as I expected. The last dish, my favorite, was the black cod. The texture was butter-soft and I loved the flavor combination with the roasted winter squash and creamed leeks. I only wish there was some contrast in texture between the leeks and the cod - it was just all a bit mushy. But, I did love the crunchy fried leaves that topped off the cod. Overall, the flavors were bold and highlighted every dish quite well. My only disappointment was the lapse in execution of the steak.  We ended dinner with the chocolate &amp; chestnut bread pudding. Even with the chestnut, the chocolate bread pudding was pedestrian and slightly dry without the addition of the hot chocolate &amp; cream. If you are a fan of chocolate, I'm sure you would enjoy it a lot more than I did.   By the end of the night, I could appreciate all the love and praise Frances is getting. It is a great little restaurant well-deserving of a Michelin star.   ***********************************************  Restroom rating:   I think it was Anthony Bourdain who referenced the cleanliness of a restaurant's restroom as a reflection of how they treat their food. In this case, I will start reviewing the restrooms of fine dining establishments, which will have no bearing on the overall Yelp star rating - just a fun FYI fact.   Rating: 3 :|  Nothing out of the ordinary or impressive to the eye. There's only a single unisex bathroom for the entire restaurant, but it's a small location to begin with. It was simple and kept clean. At least one could appreciate the rolled cloth hand towels for one's use.",

Given how long in advance you must reserve a table, I'd put many restaurants above them in terms of where I'd choose to go.   The bacon beignets are definitely a must. We also had the little gem salad which me and my friend found to be good but very tangy. It needed some sweetness like dried cranberries to cut the tang. The dinner portions are nice and well presented. Service was excellent. We also ordered the potato salad starer and green beans side. Both were OK, nothing to write home about.  So since three stars on Yelp is \"A-OK\", that's what I give them. Doubt I'll go back a third time, at least not of my choosing.",

Drinks: \u00a0The markets shots are a great idea, and very refreshing. \u00a0Also wine by the ounce. Great way to try a red with one dish, and a white with another. \u00a0Great idea.  Smaller bites: \u00a0We got a crab and beet salad. \u00a0Very well done. \u00a0 Great flavors and you could tell the ingredients were very fresh. \u00a0This might have been my favorite dish. \u00a0Also got the bacon beignets. \u00a0What makes this dish really is the creme fraiche sauce (very well flavored/seasoned).  Entrees: \u00a0Steak and duck. \u00a0I'm love duck and pretty much always order it. \u00a0The meat is so tender and juicy and the skin super crispy. \u00a0However to my surprise the steak was even better. \u00a0The meats were cooked on the rarer side (which I prefer) and perfectly juicy and flavorful.  sides: \u00a0spoon bread. \u00a0Very hot, and cheesy.  Dessert: \u00a0lumberjack cake. \u00a0Good but just not my particular cup of tea. \u00a0  Service: \u00a0ehh..okay. \u00a0We asked for bread when we initially placed our order and we were halfway through our meal with no bread offered (I was super hungry). \u00a0We pretty much needed to hunt the bread guy if we ever saw him walking around. \u00a0Also my bf noted on the reservations that this was my bday dinner, and another table got a candle in their cake and I didn't. \u00a0=( sad face.  It's a small restaurant so be prepared. \u00a0Although we weren't seated on the main wall where most of the seats are, the tables did look quite cramped and close together. \u00a0The food is really solid and definitely worth a try.",

My friend who recommended it raved about it. \u00a0Unfortunately, while the restaurant was good, neither the food nor the service wowed me. \u00a0Our server was somewhat inattentive, not at all warm and even a bit aloof, but functional enough. \u00a0I ordered:  Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets - I found the beingnet to be just slightly undercooked which made for a mushier texture than I would have expected. \u00a0The flavor was good, but nothing mind-blowing. Predictable.  Tagliatelle Pasta with Summer Squash and Blossoms, Meyer Lemon, Corn, Aleppo Chili - I could not finish this dish, and really, it kind of set my palate off for the rest of the meal. \u00a0I'm a huge squash blossom fan, but the kitchen put so much salt in this dish that it was all I could taste. \u00a0At a restaurant of this supposed caliber I would expect that they are tasting the food that goes out, and I have no idea how this could have been missed. \u00a0It was simply unpleasant; so much so that I didn't even notice the squash blossoms.  Corn Soup - We did not order this, but the chef sent it out gratis, and it ended up being the highlight of the meal. \u00a0The corn flavor was bright and summery and in perfect balance with the cream. \u00a0Delicious.  Sonoma Duck Breast - This dish was also good but not great. \u00a0I really appreciated the balance between the fatty duck and the slightly acidic jus. \u00a0Very clean and tasty.  We had a few wines, too. \u00a0We started with their house white which was very well balanced and fruity. \u00a0We then made the mistake of ordering the Abel Mendoza 'Cosecha' Tempranillo. \u00a0I found this to be far more rustic than I would expect a Spanish Tempranillo. There was none of the lush berry roundness that is characteristic. \u00a0Instead, it was highly astringent, oaky and one-dimensional. \u00a0I'm surprised it's on their list. \u00a0We changed courses after agreeing it was a dud and ended up happy with their Billhook Cab from Napa.",

    "review_text": "I should preface this review by saying I really wanted to like Frances. I had read the Yelp reviews and heard all the buzz--the Michelin star, and the likes of Bon Appetit and Eater lauding Melissa Perello's neighbourhood restaurant with all kinds of high praise. And at the start, it all seemed good: the pedigreed young chef, the daily changing menu, the bacon beignets...  Frances is cute, but cramped. Seated along the long bank of tables, I was hemmed in by the coming and going waiters and diners on each side. Service was awkward, and not commensurate with the Michelin star. Ineffectual and at times inattentive, our waiter succeeded only at taking our order and bringing food to the table. \u00a0  We began with three small bites: the baked cherrystone clams, a grilled calamari salad, and the bacon beignets served with a maple chive creme fraiche. Each represented the very best work of the kitchen, but the clams stood out as the most sophisticated and smartly fashioned dish of the three. Had we stopped here, I would have called Frances a four and went home.   We split an appetizer of spugnole pasta--dense squiggles of pasta packed into a pillow--and while the pasta was really tasty, it was comically small: we had 8, maybe 9 noodles for $14. Even if we did scrape the bowl, I'm pretty sure it was equally out of frustration at the portion as it was satisfaction at the taste.  For our entrees, we opted for the salmon (served tonight with a tasty corn compote) and the quail. Both were just a touch too salty, but the quail was altogether passable as it tasted like something I could have come up with. Beyond not fussy, the quail in particular was uninspired: bony, tiny, grilled pieces of quail with a melange of chanterelles and the latest in SF food trends, stonefruit.  Disappointed by our main course, I was willing to give Frances one last try--'win me back with desert', I cried. \u00a0An apple tarte tartin was good, but the nail in the coffin, it was unexceptional. Paired nonsensically (at least I didn't get it) with a thin 'milkshake' and dates, the desert, while fine, showed the same lack of composition and thought evident through so many other details of this let-down of a meal.  I realise SF is keen to be buzzing about new and tasty restaurants and Perello's background at some of the city's finest haunts (Charles Nob Hill) should have assured her success. But Frances tries to have it both ways: it's your cute neighbourhood bistro, heavy on quirk, and it's the classic French-inspired Michelin-starred outpost in a city of foodies. It excels as neither, and while several bites are tasty, none merit the high praise, long wait lists, and exorbitant prices.",

    "review_text": "It's been a few weeks since I ate here, so I'm going to rely on some bullet points from the notes I took when I ate at Frances. First of all, the place was very cute and intimate, with none of the attitude you might expect from a michelin starred restaurant in SF. It seemed like a nice little neighborhood bistro. The host was awesome, and invited us in to sit down before our entire party was there. Now on to the food:  The chickpea fritters were unlike anything I've ever had. They were very good. Thin crispy exterior with a satiny chickpea puree interior. Served with a spring garlic, fromage blanc, and meyer lemon sauce.  The masala spiced cauliflower puree was AWESOME. It had a great indian spice flavor, which was balanced perfectly by the housemade yogurt, which was nice and smooth and not too tangy. The lavash chips were a nice textural element to the dish that really made it pop.  The ricotta gnocchi with arugula pesto was my least favorite dish. It was a little too lemony, a little too tough, a little too dry. Not horrible, but not at all on par with the rest of their dishes.  And finally, the butter bean cassoulet. This dish is really what prompted my five star rating for Frances. It was INCREDIBLE. Never before would I have described beans as juicy until this dish. This is one of the few dishes I've ever thought kale added something to. And the smokey breadcrumbs balanced out the buttery, cheesy, rich flavor of the cassoulet perfectly. I felt like the cassoulet at Frances was not only outstanding in terms of flavor, but also very innovative and showed off the talent and creativity of the chef. Also, the portion was quite large.  Final notes about Frances: their wine system was nice, with a very accessible $1/oz, pay only for what you drink house wine system. Our waiter was not very friendly at all, and acted annoyed with our group for ordering a smallish amount of food (we shared a lot of dishes). But, for the quality of food, I can forgive that little blemish. Overall, I would highly recommend checking out Frances, but make sure to make your reservation well in advance!",

I managed to squeeze us in after keeping Open Table up on my laptop for 3 weeks and constantly refreshing it, hoping valiantly for an opening. We got lucky!  The decor is simple, intimate, and makes you feel at home. The wait staff was friendly and accommodating. We ordered the bacon beignets (a surprisingly awesome way to start the meal), followed by the risotto, which had an extremely pleasing and melt-in-your-mouth texture. For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the bavette steak (which he was craving) and said he very much enjoyed it. My duck, however, was on another level. It was cooked to perfection and every bite was incredibly well-balanced with the mandarin and onions. The duck is not a dish anyone who goes to Frances should pass up.   For dessert, we got the Lumberjack cake, and the waiter kindly brought it out with a candle for the bf's birthday. I'm not a huge fan of extremely sweet desserts, so this cake was absolutely perfect. The fruits in it were so flavorful and plump, and the ice cream was a wonderful compliment.  Possibly the greatest thing about Frances is their $1/oz. house wine (which, by the way, is actually pretty good). We got two beakers (yes...we were sufficiently buzzed by the end of the evening, but is there any other way to celebrate one's birthday?) and paid $18 total for everything. That's a pretty incredible deal in my book, and also meant the check was significantly less than expected and totally worth the price in my opinion.  Frances has great food, great service, and a great vibe. I highly recommend it if you can snag a reservation!",

After trying a another Michelin star restaurant and not being all that impressed, I had resigned myself to to thinking this whole star thing was overrated, but Frances has completely changed my mind. We got the cornbread with bacon butter. My first thought when I bit into my simple piece of cornbread was, \"What type of sorcery is this? How could cornbread be so mindblowingly delicious.\" Next we had the beignets. They were good, but after all the hype and probably our super high expectations after the cornbread, it was a little disappointing. It was good, but the cornbread was better. For our entrees we got the duck breast and the bavette steak. Both were delicious, but surprisingly the star of our entrees was probably the lemon risotto that came with the steak. I seriously picked every single last grain of it off of my plate. We had the lumberjack cake for dessert and were not disappointed. I rarely repeat restaurants, but I think this one well deserves another visit.   In terms of price, our dinner for two came out around $80 before the tip was included. \u00a0Prices for every item are listed on the menu on their website. You should definitely check out their menu online before booking too since they rotate their menu.",

In the end, it was okay. - Service was very nice, pleasant, relaxed but punctual. - Kale salad was nice. - Market shot (made out of daily fresh fruits) is fantastic. This would be worth coming here to sit at the bar and drink this totally unique thing. - Duck mousse had a slightly sweet overtone, and far too much/too rich without enough baguette on the side. - Bacon beignets were doughy and kind of oddly flavored like cheap shrimp chips. - Chickpea fritters were okay, basically fancy french fries, kind of dry, slightly overdry. - Squid ink linguine was very salty, probably too salty. - Cod main dish was a little bland. Overall, maybe it didn't feel worth the price/wait.",

Being one of the hottest days in the city (obviously, no control over this), it was a challenge to truly enjoy this meal. We were kindly seated at the table closest to the reception area and entrance. Patrick was very thorough and outstanding in explaining the menu to us, giving us three recommendations.   Amuse Bouche  1) Toasted almonds (16) - We remembered the number as it provided a lucky \"eight\" for her and me.  Bouchees  2) Bacon Beignet (5) - Light, puffy pillows with a creamy dipping sauce.

The flavors were very subtle here.

Appetizers  5) Heirloom Tomato Salad - This was actually very spectacular with the bold flavor contrasts of the tomatoes, lettuce with a refreshing vinaigrette dressing, and avocado. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dMlsQsPU8Y_oiPYC5hHi2A?select=mWZWEZg_ngeCc9r9QammZg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dMls\u2026</a>)  6) Gnocchi - Served with a light tomato sauce, they were tasty and good, but the bar is perhaps set too high by Myth/Zinnia's version.  Entrees  7) Roasted Lamb - This was a welcome surprise as the lamb slices were cooked medium rare. The meat texture was melt-in-your-mouth tender and not a hint of gamey flavor. The squash was a great accompaniment and the Braised Lamb Crespelle reminded me of a mini \"pulled\" lamb enchilada.

Hearty portion.

The food rates 4.5 stars in my book, though the unusual conditions (86 degrees at 9 pm in SF?!) made it more difficult to enjoy. The two recommended bouchees (calamari salad and beets) and the salad were probably the most enjoyed dishes since they were cold; while leaving, we noticed that other tables were getting bread which we did not. My expectations were different as the rustic menu was a stark contrast from what I remembered from Fifth Floor. Wished the weather was more cooperative, but it's just another excuse for another visit.",

    "review_text": "I've been here 5 or 6 times now, and the main thing that keeps me from coming back is that the menu rarely changes. \u00a0They definitely have some good staples that I would like to see stay on the menu (like the bacon beignets), but I think the menu literally is the same each time.  Of course, house wine in a carafe is charged by the ounce and is very reasonably priced, but I didn't love last night's red. \u00a0The last few times I really liked the house red.  Food: - Bacon beignets: sometimes with more bacon than other times; I like the bacon flavor and the balance from the maple creme fraiche - Panisse frites: they look like fried tofu but are actually a really nice smooth texture inside, and I like the smoked eggplant dip with it - Crab and beet salad: good tangy dressing without being too creamy, nice oranges, but only one piece of crab - Bastilla: special bouche of the day with phyllo and carrots inside - Sunchoke soup: smooth, nice presentation as they pour it over a plate with hummus, dukkah, and crisped sunchokes - Josey Baker bread: served warm with salted butter - Melted leek and white cornmeal spoonbread: served in a cast iron skillet, loved the parmesan and apple butter, but it's pretty heavy - Iacopi butter bean ragout: I don't even like beans, but this butter bean dish was really complex in flavors and textures with the celeriac, charrred broccolini, and soft egg - Sonoma duck breast: I actually just loved the caramelized persimmon and chestnut puree underneath, but I think duck is always a table favorite - Bavette steak: perfect medium rare, love the murhoom confit  I always end with the Boozy Affogato.  Service is always wonderful. \u00a0They're great at filling water, good with pacing, and there are little things like when they start off by asking if you have time constraints, etc. \u00a0I'm a little surprised they haven't been able to get their star back since their food has always been very solid and consistent each time I go. \u00a0Is it the lack of change in the menu? \u00a0Regardless, it's still one of my SF favorites.",

I also had the squid ink pasta and loved it. The four of us had 5 desserts between us. All were excellent, however the two I recommend (highly) are the strawberry rhubarb tart with etherial homemade ice cream, and the cake with all kinds of fruit...pears, dates, etc. in it and equally etherial homemade ice cream. The atmosphere is very nice . . . wonderful dinnerware and beautifully plain wooden tables. Even the aprons the wait staff wear coordinate beautifully with the plain and tasteful color theme which feels just right. And the service is perfection. I can't wait to return!!!",

This exceptional New American/French inspired restaurant is a gem (maybe not so hidden any more) and I'm proud to call one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco.  Few standout recommendations that I think make it exceptionally unique among a city full of restaurants with fabulous food and terrific service.  -Market \"shot\" - There's a unique, farmer's market-sourced, produce-based, likely alcoholic sip served at $3 a pop. It's usually different and always delicious! In any event, a refreshing and awesome way to start off one's meal.  -Wine by the ounce - You can get Frances house red or white in a graduated cylinder like beaker, priced at $1/ounce. Very solid offering, very solid price, and a way to have both red and white with your meal without ordering a bottle, or even drinking a full glass.  -Bacon beignets. YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!  Seems like all of San Francisco and then some have discovered how exceptional this place is, so it's all but impossible to get a reservation. Few recommendations in this area: -Check back close to day-of to see if there were last minute cancellations -If you're 1-2 people and willing to sit at the bar, I've heard this is a decent way to get in -Whatever you do, don't try to bring more than five people. They don't have the table capacity for it. (Unless you're renting out the whole restaurant, I guess)",

I purposely did not dine out to celebrate the year because most restaurants have set menus and then someone always is not happy. Frances offers a few choices in each category, amuse bouche, appetizers, main courses and does them all so well. Rarely do I give the five star rating unless I've eaten several times at a restaurant but I am certain that all the items I didn't try were also perfect. Intimate, focused service, no unwanted intrusions of waiters telling you what you are eating. Timing of food was spot on, close enough to other diners and yet noise level such that we could have a private conversation and then a friendly chat with a satisfied couple next to us. Bacon beignet with maple creme fraiche, an outstanding sunchoke soup with dukkah, trout on a bed of cauliflower and pearl barley, lumberjack cake to split. Two glasses of wine for me as suggested by our waiters to pair were all I needed to set me right.  Like many wonderful restaurants here you must call a month in advance but what fun to look forward to another night at Frances.",

The beau booked a month or two in advance and the best seating time we were able to get was between 5:15 or 9:15. We opted for an early meal, but if you're looking for something at a more reasonable hour, I recommend booking well in advance if you can!   We started off with two seasonal market shots which were made with ripe cantaloupe the day we visited. After the market shots, we grabbed a carafe of their house red which is charged per ounce (A pretty nifty concept if you ask me!).   We shared blistered shishito peppers which came with a 'queso' dip at the bottom. We are a big fan of shishito peppers, and these were probably blistered more thoroughly than anywhere else we'd had them before which was really nice.   Of course we had to get the bacon beignets which were seriously scrumptious. I could've eaters numerous orders of just that for the entire meal..   We also ordered one of their daily \"sides\" which was described to us as a \"fried gnocchi with an eggplant caponata,\" but was not really that at all. The \"gnocchi\" turned out to be more like a fried wonton wrapper and was really disappointing (-1 star Frances) The eggplant caponata part was actually really delicious but because it was described to us as a fried gnocchi, we were expecting something completely different and were super disappointed when it came.   For his main, the man ordered the Bavette steak which was cooked to p-e-r-f-e-c-t-i-o-n, and then was drizzled with a reduction sauce that was superb.   I saw quail on the menu and immediately ordered it with no questions. It was insanely delicious.. and I actually thought it was so much better than the steak. The quail stuffing reminded me of a meatloaf, but in a really good way. Underneath the quail there were all kinds of in season vegetables.. frisee, potatoes, roasted cipollini onions, and Padron peppers. That quail dish might be one of the best things I've ever eaten hands down. In fact, I rarely am able to finish an entire entree, but managed to lick that plate clean.   We finished the meal with their Lumberjack cake, which was light, but heavy in all the best ways. The cake itself was cooked to be kind of crispy/chewy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.   Overall the entire meal was a delight and I'd go back again just for that Quail.",

We had the applewood smoked bacon beignets, chickpea fritters, grilled calamari salad and linguine with fennel sausage to start. The beignets were amazing. Get as many orders of those as possible. For our next course, we had salmon and quail. Although we were incredibly full, the bold flavors shined and made us continue eating.   The service was absolutely incredible. I mentioned I was a culinary student and I had the pleasure of meeting the chef and seeing the kitchen. She was so kind and introduced me to the entire staff. It was so flattering.   Next we looked at a dessert menu and we were only going to look. We ended up ordering the hazelnut ice cream with toffee and beignets. When that came out, a meringue with caramelized bananas came out as a thank you for coming from the chef. It was so incredible and we did not want to leave. If I could eat there every single night, I would. It was the best 2+ hour dining experience I've had in a long time.   If you're looking for quality, passion, excellent food, service that is even better than the food and a unique dining experience, go to Frances. I would love to go back as many times as possible.

We shared the roasted cauliflower salad and the tagliatelle with pancetta and mushrooms to start. The mushrooms were earthy, chewy, and simply amazing. He had the steak and I had the snapper for our entrees. Both came with a yummy sauce that the server poured onto our plates at the table. The wines by the glass were also very good. We polished the meal off by sharing the Lumberjack cake. I will definitely return in the spring for another great meal!",

Like I said, BFFs.  On our most recent visit, we had the Kale Summer salad which had summer peaches and the perfect amount of dressing to lightly give the Kale a zesty twist  An added nice touch and surprising wrinkle is the in house wine program where you can \"pay for what you drink.\" This is great for those nights where you don't want to commit to a bottle, but know you need more than a glass. Plus it's fun to experience the different blends they come up with. My personal opinion is the white blends are less desirable than the reds, but that might be my personal taste.  For my main course, I had the roasted duck. It was incredible. Succulent, well cooked, with just a touch of crispy skin to give it a nice texture. The duck was cooked perfectly at medium rare and was surprisingly not that fatty, but was still moist and tender.  For desert, we had the plum tart, which featured great summer fruits and was light enough to not make you feel the guilt on the walk home.  Give Frances a try, but don't even think about stealing my best friend!",

Classically paired with creamy, perfected-roasted new potatoes. Choc-almond Clafoutis! - WHOA. If everyone tried this, it would make the world a better place. Salted caramel/chocolate/dessert lovers - please get this.  Special thanks to Patrick (manager?) for being so gracious to my dining request! Sorry we sat at the table for so long!  Know Before You Go: If you want to walk in, come right at 5, chances are there will already be a few waiting.  STEAL for what you get! $$200 for 2 glasses wine, bacon beignets, pate appetizer, 3 market shots, duck, steak, sea bass, clafoutis!",

    "review_text": "My first visit here was over a year ago. \u00a0I can't recall all the details from that visit except that I remember being wowed by the food! \u00a0An experience I haven't had with some of San Francisco's other one star Michelin restaurants. \u00a0I came here for my anniversary a couple weeks ago and it was just as wonderful as the first time.  We started out our visit here with wine, of course. \u00a0We were celebrating, but didn't want to break the bank, so we ordered their house red wine. \u00a0They offer house red and white wines for $1 an ounce. \u00a0They bring you a small carafe of wine and charge you based on what you drink. \u00a0The wine is a blend created by their beverage director every day.  I like the way their wine list is broken out. \u00a0Rather than arranging it by grape varietal, the menu has a brief description of the wine types, such as full bodied whites or light rustic reds. It makes it easier to select a wine that you will prefer.  We ordered a bunch of food to share. \u00a0For our meal we started out with the smoked bacon beignets. \u00a0How could we resist getting those? \u00a0They were amazing! \u00a0The aroma was so lovely I sat impatiently as my boyfriend took a picture before I could grab one.  Next we had the chilled white corn soup and a dish with slow roasted beef and vegetables. \u00a0The second dish was good but couldn't stand up to the wonderful flavors in the corn soup. \u00a0It had pickled chanterelles, brokaw avocado and cornmeal tuile. \u00a0I never thought I would find a mushroom that I enjoyed the flavor of as much as truffles, but these chanterelles were delicious little bursts of flavor. \u00a0Wow! \u00a0It was my favorite dish of the night!  For our entrees we had the five dot ranch bavette steak and the roasted chicken. \u00a0The steak was cooked to perfection. \u00a0It a flavorful dish with peppers, chanterelle mushrooms and chimichurri sauce. \u00a0The chicken was great too. \u00a0It made me think of Julie Child's description of having chicken for the first time in France. \u00a0It's not because the ingredients were identical, this chicken had herbs and fingerling potatoes and mushrooms. \u00a0It was because rather than simply flavoring the chicken, the ingredients seemed to make the chicken taste more \"chickeny.\" \u00a0The texture of the chicken was incredibly tender too.  Finally to satisfy my sweet tooth, we got the chocolate stout cake with cocoa anise crumble, dark caramel creme fraiche. \u00a0The cake was rich and chocolatey, not too sweet. \u00a0We shared the raspberry and meyer lemon trifle with raspberry gelee, lemon curd and toasted pistachio macaron. \u00a0I loved the mix of the tangy fruit flavors. \u00a0We had delicious blue bottle coffee too.  Service was prompt and friendly. \u00a0The only downside of this restaurant is that it's small, so you can't come with a big group and it's difficult to get a reservation. \u00a0They do keep a few stools at the bar for walk-ins. \u00a0You can make reservation a couple months in advance and it's well worth the wait.",

Small and tight spaces but overall the ambiance was good. I like restaurants like this.   We started out with their daily Juice Shots. Watermelon juice special, spiced and spiked, yum! They had two specials that night. A Tomato Tart and a also Salmon Belly dish. \u00a0Both were filled with lots flavor and they were delicious. So lucky I asked our waiter because it was just added on. My reservation was at 630pm, prefect timing. We also ordered the Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets, which was not greasy and you can taste the bacon. Awesome! Our last appetizer was the Chanterelle Mushroom Linguine. Not heavy and just enough flavor to carry us over to our entrees. \u00a0  As for our entrees my best friend had the Marin Coast King Salmon. He really like his dish. Very flavorful, moist and worked well with the combination of radish and creme frachie. I had the Stuffed Tolenas Farm Quail. The Padr\u00f3n Chile was amazing and it went so prefect with the Quail. For the sides, we got the White Corn Spoonbread and Caponata. The cornbread was super yummy but the caponata was okay. \u00a0Was hoping for a little bit more flavor aka in the eggplant. \u00a0 \u00a0  We ended the night with the Lumberjack Cake for me and the birthday boy got the Plaisir Sucre. \u00a0You must get the Lumberjack Cake! The cake was warm and awesome with the yummy Muscovado ice cream. \u00a0Super delicious!",

We were warmly greeted and helped by Paul, \"the wine guy.\" He was so nice and not pretentious at all, which could also describe the restaurant's atmosphere. We started with the wine by the oz. which is genius!   Bouchees: These were definitely more than a mouthful, more like 3 mouthfuls, actually! I was thinking about skipping these and I imagined them to be small little one biters. Thank god we did not and skipped the apps instead (though I kinda wish we got the chestnut soup).  Applewood Bacon Beignets: DO NOT skip these! Fried, delightful, not overly greasy, and not overly bacon-ned. I know, how is that possible, but it is. The maple chive creme fraiche is such a perfect accompaniment!  Masala spice Cauliflower &amp; Yogurt: I didn't really know what to expect but it was like a dip that came in a small glass jar. After slathering it on the lavash, I was about to lick the jar clean but GZ \u00a0convinced me to just eat it with the spoon. YUM.  Entrees: Duck breast was perfectly, perfectly cooked. I'm Chinese so my people like to roast that bird to death and it's delicious but in a totally different way. This duck breast was medium rare and so incredibly juicy. The striped bass was pan fried, with a perfectly crispy skin.   Sides: We also had the side of the napa cabbage and the gnocchi. The crispy shallots gave the cabbage some depth and was super enjoyable. The gnocchi took a few bites for me to get into, the freshness eventually won me over. Good accompaniment to the rest of the meal.  We skipped dessert and they brought out a cookie with a candle anyway! Great touch to \u00a0a great meal/birthday.  Best of all? The portions were quite generous for this type of restaurant. Usually they seem to be a bit micro but here I felt thoroughly satiated and stuffed. I rarely come back to nicer restaurants in SF (so many to try) but I could put this on my return list.",

    "review_text": "Me and Frances, we just didn't have a good first impression of each other. In fact, it was the kind of blind date where you give out your phone number but switch the last four digits around. Oh, I expected a whole lot given all the advance praise. Someone at work told me it was the best restaurant he's been to in San Francisco. I don't question all the five-star ratings, but I do have to say the tight quarters at Frances really makes it essential to recognize that timing is everything.   Jamie W. and I could only secure a 9:30PM reservation on a Friday. I made it on Open Table about three months prior, but we unexpectedly had a great meal with friends the night before at Zazie. Despite rumor, I don't usually go out for a nice dinner two nights in a row unless I'm traveling. What am I made of? Money? So alas, we arrived with some trepidation and saw the place abuzz with hip singles and other assorted foodies.... people crowding in the iddy-biddy bar area as you come in, people dining at tables snugly placed against the right wall. We were seated smack dab in the middle of those gulag-style tables.   Hell. Pure hell. There was a blowzy, tree-trunk-thighed blonde in a too-tight black dress sitting to one side with her bellowing Aussie boyfriend. Alcohol-infused beyond reason, this couple spoke in such a high decibel you would have thought they were stage-trained. Her screechy, squealing voice made my ears bleed and broke all the stemware on our table. On the other side of us were the beginnings of what looked to be a Branch Davidian-type of commune with very skinny people in skanky outfits apparently multiplying and crowding the waiters out of their serving paths.   Jamie and I could barely hear each other due to the squealing blonde who kept ridiculing our dining choices with the subtlety of Michelle McGee's tattoos. We managed to order two of the $6.50 appetizers above the din - the Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets with a Maple Creme Fraiche &amp; Chive and the Crisp Pork Trotters with Sauce Gribiche &amp; Pickled Baby Vegetables (see photos). The former was tasty though I couldn't really taste the bacon, and the latter was similar to crab cakes in texture. Next came the $10 Grilled Asparagus Salad with a Walnut Vinaigrette, which was marginally disappointing with the chicories doused in the dressing on top (see photo).  The entrees, however, were top-notch if a bit small in portion. Jamie had the $16 Watson Spring Farm Lamb with Butter Beans, Artichokes &amp; Olives (see photo). Tasty, savory, and it really was a nice match of flavors and textures. I went more conservative and ordered the $11 Organic Chicken, served in roulade fashion with Green Garlic &amp; Spring Vegetable Ragout and Parmesan Pudding on the side (see photo). The poultry was genuinely succulent, and I savored every morsel.   Still, despite the attentive waiter, the dining experience was a disappointment since we couldn't just sit there to be enraptured by the food. Instead, I had to hear big-mouth Barbie's detailed account of her BFF's liposuction procedure as she wolfed her food. Next time I'm coming early and bringing a Taser.   FOOD - 4 stars...quite scrumptious most of the time  AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...Frances' weak area, just isn't fit for a romantic dinner for two unless there was more crowd control  SERVICE - 3.5 stars...very attentive but I was hoping he could see our pain and move us when he had the chance TOTAL - 3 stars....I might try Frances again but not until blondie's car-alarm voice is completely out of my head",

    "review_text": "Patience, persistence and luck - in a magical combination I hope to replicate during my lifetime - landed me a nearly impossible reservation at this much-ballyhooed hot spot. \u00a0On a Saturday night, nonetheless. \u00a0Neither the crowd nor the vibe here is excessively trendy, but the creative deployment of the freshest seasonal ingredients in whimsical combinations makes Frances a prime example of a very gratifying and delicious trend in California cooking. \u00a0 \u00a0  The menu's breadth of alluring options demanded multiple courses. \u00a0We started with the \"Panisse Frites,\" velvety smooth, lightly fried chickpea \"fries\" with a dipping sauce subtly accented with black olive (so subtle, in fact, that my girlfriend's complete lack of enthusiasm for olives didn't prevent her from loving it!). \u00a0Next up was a light, lively marinated cauliflower and broccoli salad tossed with slivered castelvetrano olive, lemon and ricotta salata - a dish so refreshing it could aptly be termed palate-cleansing. \u00a0Both dishes come from the \"bouchees\" section of the menu, and were surprisingly generous given the modest cost.  In honor of California's autumnal burst of persimmons, we decided to try out the Fuyu Persimmon Salad, a pleasant medley of endive and escarole with shaved persimmons and intriguing toasted walnut vinaigrette. \u00a0All-an-all, it sounded delicious but the flavor combination didn't pop for me, especially when compared to the other dishes we'd had...and were about to enjoy.  The caramelized scallops arrived floating on a bed of Meyer lemon risotto, a marriage almost too perfect to conceive. \u00a0The risotto was alive with flavor, with an ideal balance of sweet, sour and salt, the perfect partner to the tender, sweet scallops. \u00a0 If only the princely sum we forked over for the pleasure of this dish would have yielded more than three scallops?   Our roasted Brussels sprouts were MIA until we chased down the server to retrieve them, so they became a pre-dessert course, and perhaps the best thing we tasted all night. \u00a0 Pan roasted with chestnuts and bacon lardons - how could you go wrong? \u00a0That we had to send out a search party was frustrating, and it crystallized a conclusion about the service (albeit with one dinner to go on): \u00a0while knowledgeable and personable when you can find them, the staff is unobtrusive to the point of aloofness. \u00a0  Friends had pointed us to the lumberjack cake, a warm, spiced apple cake with walnuts and dates, which proved to be a fantastic choice made better with a side of smooth maple walnut ice cream. \u00a0My only scant critique is of the chopped medjool dates underneath the ice cream, a displeasing clash of texture for me.  We were packed into the narrow dining room like sustainably-harvested sardines, but as long as I didn't make a sudden arm movement I could generally avoid usurping my neighbor's space. \u00a0Even a slight increase in space between tables would go a long way. \u00a0Otherwise, the dining room was pleasant and homey, with unremarkable d\u00e9cor. \u00a0After all, it's the quality and creativity of the food that's really on center stage here.",

    "review_text": "Came here with a friend for dinner after making a reservation about 6 weeks in advance.  Overall, I really enjoyed the meal. There wasn't anything that blew us out of the water, but it was consistently good throughout and a great value. While the service is great, I do feel like the timing between dishes is a bit slow. Thankfully we had gotten a bottle of wine and had plenty of time to spare, as there were definitely long pauses between courses. The seating feels a little tight and cramped, but the space is quite quaint.  We got a bottle of the 'Il Superiore', which is an Italian blend of Barbera/Bonarda. I'd never had this wine before, but now it's definitely one of my favorites!  What we ordered: 1) Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets - I got these because of the glowing reviews that I'd read, but I found this dish to be a bit flat and boring. The beignets are nice and fluffy (with a great creme fraiche dipping sauce), but the flavor was a bit bland. 2) Grilled Calamari - The calamari was cooked incredibly well and the squid ink vinagrette was delicious. 3) Burrata - Burrata is definitely one of my favorite foods to get at San Francisco restaurants, and this dish definitely didn't disappoint! The burrata was extremely creamy, and this was probably one of my favorite burrata dishes in the city. 4) Baby Kale Salad - I didn't think I was going to like this because I'm not a fan of kale, but baby kale seems to be a whole different story. A bit on the light side for a salad, but the flavors were great. 5) Local King Salmon - Nothing too unique about this dish, but still a well-cooked salmon dish. 6) Strawberry Rhubarb Pie - Shared this pie with my friend, and we were literally in dessert heaven! The pie wasn't overly sweetened (which I feel that pies with rhubarb tend to be), and the ice cream complemented the pie perfectly.",

I've never had beignets that were fried, and really enjoyed the light crisp exterior, and warm chewy interior! The creme fraiche went along very nicely.   However, we where a little underwhelmed with the entr\u00e9es. We ordered the duck and the black cod. The quality was definitely there and the skill and execution of the dishes was quite evident. \u00a0But the actual flavors used in the dishes were too bland for our palettes. Even the crispy potato fingerling side dish we ordered came out cooked, but lacked the crispy.   On the bright side, we enjoyed dessert! Apple pie with meyer lemon ice cream was a very nice touch. The apple pie came out in a little tartlet sprinkled with sugar, and was both flaky and crisp.   I wish that there menu wasn't as limited.",

This time around, and nearly twelve months later I achieved some clarity that Frances is well intentioned, but really could use a few lesser tables. \u00a0It came to me in a flash, and because sitting elsewhere other than at either of the 2 awkwardly placed tables in the center made a world of difference.. I think I now recall flavors and smells even more vividly this visit around.  First: Bacon Beignets: were lightly smoked in flavor, delicately light and airy in texture, and subtly flavorful. If Frances could bottle up the cr\u00e8me fraiche I would enjoyably gobble it up with some homemade blue-berry waffles. Kalifornia Kolsch: I wish they had a hoppier draft, but this golden ale was toned-down, and didn't compete with any portions of the meal.  Dungeness Crab Risotto: sensationally creamy, warm, moist and a bit naughty with the firm English Peas  Second: 09 Domaine des Terres de Velle Pinot Noir: long finish with some berries and spice. Really woodsy barrel flavor went nicely with the steak. Bavette Steak: the butterbeans along with the pistachio pesto really made this dish! Squash: creamy, cheesy flavor profile, contrasts the steak nicely when eaten in tandem.   Dessert: Fresh nectarines and blueberries with cornmeal cake, and Slocombe maple ice cream. Yum.  Thanks for reframing my perception Frances, but please do remove those silly center tables. \u00a0They are torture!",

Hubby had the house wine which was actually quite good. We shared the chicory salad which had a great balance of brightness and earthiness with sweet cipollini onions, roasted radishes, asparagus and raddichio... So delicious! The bacon beignets were good and smoky but the texture was a tad too soft inside. The squid ink pasta was to die for. Lovely chewy texture, robust sea saltiness and garlic flavor. Sooo good! I was so stuffed by then that I basically didn't want to eat the entree (which we shared)- the Sonoma duck with Japanese sweet potato. Omg, it was perfectly cooked with crispy skin and beautifully seasoned and the greens, blood orange and sweet potato had the perfect sweetness, bitterness and acid to cut the richness of the duck. I only had a few bites but it was so worth it. My husband devoured it.   Didn't have room for dessert but would come back on future trips to SF.

Come here for: (i) the incredible bacon beignets; (ii) the white corn soup; and (iii) the salmon. The beignets are warm and donuty, and come with a perfect creamy dip. The corn soup may be Frances' standout dish. You get an otherwise empty bowl with a dollop of chipotle-flavored creme fraiche pearled inside. Your waiter or waitress then pours the soup tableside. The warm soup melts the creme fraiche and makes a dish that is rich, warm, and comforting.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, with that nice, meaty consistency you often see in salmon that's been prepared sous vide.   The meal wasn't perfect. The chickpea frites were interesting but too dry for the dipping sauce to save, the pasta appetizer was very good but not great, and the steak was chewy. Great service throughout.

For appetizers, we ordered the bacon beignets which were little savory donuts with a maple chive dipping sauce. \u00a0These, I admit, were good and tasted like hush puppies. \u00a0We also ordered the roasted fennel &amp; white bean soup, which was also good and had a bit of crunchiness to it (not quite sure from what), but was a bit salty.. near the end, I could only have so much of it. \u00a0We ended appetizers on the crab salad , which was ok, but definitely nothing worth noting.  For entrees, we tried the bavette steak and the caramelized scallops. \u00a0Not bad, but again, both the entrees were overly salty, and ultimately the saltiness made it unappetizing.  We decided to try a dessert and ended up trying the chocolate clafoutis, which was fine (I was too full to notice too much about it though). \u00a0At the end, our waiter said we should come back to try the lumberjack cake because it was on the 7x7's Big Eat list..

We had the tikka masala, bacon beignets, and the clams. Overall the clams had the most flavor  Seconds: We ordered the crab risotto with meyer lemon for a second plate. Overall this dish was my favorite aside from feeling the risotto was under cooked. To me (and I could be wrong!) but a risotto should be more soft. Our rice seemed a little had and I wish it was cooked about 10 mins longer.   Entree: we had the steak with a side of gnocchi. The steak was good and cooked to a great medium rare - but could have had more flavor. The gnocchi was the most disappointing. I am a big fan of gnocchi and was really looking forward to this side - it came off as dry and and again without much flavor. Gnocchi is such a wonderful pasta that can be infused with such great flavor - theirs came off as bland and extra starchy. (tear!)   I was really sad that Frances didn't hold up to how much we were looking forward to it. I did love the fact that they had $1 an house house wine - but even that ran out halfway through dinner. As a previous bartender and server I wished our server would have apologized with an offer of a glass of another wine on the house \u00a0when they announced they ran out. With paying over $100 for a dinner for two - would have been a nice gesture...  Overall I WISH i loved it... but only in my eyes does it deserve 3 stars.",

We made our Open Table reservation about a week in advance and still only got a 10:00pm dinner spot for this place. We were early and figured it wouldn't hurt to let them know we were here and they actually sat us right away. This place is tinnnnny. Maybe 10 tables? They took our coats and we nestled in between two other couples.   Once we had a chance to look at the menu I asked the waiter about the \"house beverages\" section. What they do here is genius. First, for $3 you can have a 3 oz \"market shot.\" How it's explained on the menu is: Whatever we find at the market gets juiced, spiced and spiked. That day it was some sort of Campari something- I don't know. It was orange and it was delicious. Next they have their Frances Red or White wine which is $1 per ounce. They bring out a 20oz bottle or so filled with your choice and you pay for what you drink (there are little notches on the side so that you can see). Since we only drank about 10 oz or so that's all we were charged for. Amazing.  We then moved on to our appetizers. We shared the Baked Cherrystone Clams which were incredible and the Parnsip soup since it was chill outside. The soup was not only beautifully presented (poured over the more tangible ingredients in your dish) but delicious. For our respective dinners I had the Duck Breast and the hubs had the Steak. Both were very good. The Duck was a pretty large portion and try as I could to finish it, I just wasn't able to.   We then asked for our bill (which came out to just over $100) and they very nicely put our coats on for us (the service!).

Sonoma Duck 'Bolognese,' Tagliatelle, Chestnut and Black Trumpet Mushroom - huge portion, you tell yourself you still have the entree coming but before you know it it's gone. \u00a0  Then the entree of choice:  Five Dot Ranch Bavette Steak, Toasted Farro and Creamed Cipollini Onion Or Pan-Roasted Local Black Cod, Hedgehog Mushroom, Black Lentil Rago\u00fbt  I went with the Bavette, and a good portion of the table went with the Black Cod. \u00a0  Both amazing.  Finally, dessert. \u00a0Lumberjack Cake Baked with Autumn Fruits, Dark Muscovado Ice Cream. \u00a0Nothing to say here except I don't eat ice cream and don't normally like cake - I ate them both and enjoyed every bite.  They paired the wines for us - if you have the option, let them they know what they are doing.  The staff is wonderful to work with, Samantha helped me with the planning, Melissa called me personally to talk about the evening and what the menu might look like and the entire staff for the evening were warm, personable, thoughtful and attentive. \u00a0Made our meal just what we hoped it would be, enjoyable from start to finish. \u00a0  Lots of office chatter today about the dinner, mostly I heard \"let's do it again next year\". \u00a0I HIGHLY recommend Frances if you can get a reservation, lucky enough to get a table as a walk, sit at the bar or do like I did and rent it out for the night guaranteeing yourself a place at Frances' table.  Seriously, go there.",

    "review_text": "This place was amazing. I've had many Michelin restaurants, and Frances is definitely on the very high end of the quality-for-price ratio. The only downside is that parking is street only! So head over a bit earlier to find parking because it can get hard.  I managed to snag a reservation for 3 on a Tuesday night at 5:00pm a week beforehand, because they were booked for a month+ in advance. That's a good indication that it's a GREAT restaurant, and how lucky I got. So if you have an occasion coming up make your reservation early!  The restaurant opened promptly at 5 and seated us -- we got the best seats in the house! There's one circular table on the street side that has three sides of windows, and it was a perfect and well-lit evening.   We ordered two pitchers of their $1/ounce wine -- one red and one white -- and one each from each of the 4 sections on their menu. Even so, the meal only came out to be around $70 per person! (Yeah, \"only\" if you consider how high end the quality is).  The food was AMAZING. Can't really even talk about it because you just have to try it yourself. They don't have tasting menus typical of high-end restaurants, but it's nonetheless delicious. My favorites were their Spugnole Pasta, Bacon Beignets, Grilled Calamari, and Panisse Frites. We all got an appetizer and shared them, and had our own other courses. Their Eggplant Parmesan was very flavorful, but became too strong after a while. For dessert we got the Lumberjack Cake which is their most popular dessert, and it was very good and not overpowering!  100% recommend going to this restaurant if you're trying to plan for a special meal! Their service was impeccable and there's nothing negative to be said.",

The restaurant welcome walk-in but must be seated at the counter only, which I do not want.   A miracle happen and out of the blue on the day of our food adventure, I decided to check on opentable one last time. There it was, available seating at 7:30pm, I was ecstatic with joy.   We arrived promptly on time and began to ordered:  - Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets = anything with bacon is good!  - Ricotta Gnocchi = rich and a tad bitter for my taste.   -Five-Dot Ranch Bavette Steak = risotto and the steak was perfectly paired.  - Sonoma Duck Breast = devoured this tender succulent duck breast within seconds. The duck jus was AMAZING!!!  It was a record for us to finish our food within less than thirty minutes. Either that or we were a true fatties. Overall, it was a wonderful meal with attentive staff that know how to conversate. Would love to come back here for another amazing meal!",

I gave up pretty quickly since nothing stood out on the menu as something I was dying to try. \u00a0My husband and I finally made it to Frances and it was definitely one of the more enjoyable meals we have had in awhile. \u00a0It is so challenging to get a reservation because it is TINY! \u00a0I love everything about the space. \u00a0As for food, fantastic! \u00a0We, like make before us, started with the bacon beignets with maple creme fraiche as well as the spinach salad. \u00a0I do not know how you could mess the bacon beignets up, and the spinach salad, although simple, was flawless. \u00a0I loved the crispy onions on top, and who doesn't like an egg? \u00a0For entrees we split the lamb loin and dungeness crab risotto. \u00a0My experience with fish and risotto is that you tend to get something fresh with something citrus, however, this was the opposite and so good! \u00a0It was served with black rice risotto, the crab was placed evenly within the rice, I am not even sure how they did it, and if you did not know it was crab you might think you were eating something else. \u00a0The other surprisingly fantastic add to this dish was cilantro. \u00a0For the Lamb, the jus had so much flavor. \u00a0The vegetables were perfectly cooked as well as the meat. \u00a0The meat was incredibly tender. \u00a0We ended with cocoa fritters for dessert. \u00a0For me this was my least favorite dish of the meal(and why I am giving 4 stars). \u00a0The fritters were a little dry, but still all and all a good dish. \u00a0If I can plan accordingly I will definitely visit Frances again!",

    "review_text": "***Frances utilizes high quality, fresh and seasonal ingredients and has a kitchen that can optimize the texture, moisture and flavor of each of those ingredients (and at reasonable prices); that being said, I did not love the flavor combinations at Frances; the restaurant did show enough potential that I would be willing to give them another chance***  Frances resides in Castro near Mission and it is my kind of restaurant. \u00a0It is small with a simple and straightforward decor. \u00a0The menu is simple too. \u00a0The small menu features great sounding and reasonably priced dishes with inviting ingredients. \u00a0Despite the restaurant's high acclaim, all entrees are under $30. \u00a0With all of this, there is much to like about Frances, but I did not walk away loving Frances as much as I should have.  Frances' decor is good. \u00a0It is simple, clean and contemporary. \u00a0The restaurant sits right smack dab in a neighborhood and it definitely has that neighborhood restaurant feel. \u00a0There are a few tables. \u00a0They also have a small bar to accommodate walk-ins; it is a tight squeeze though and it fills up quickly.  The menu consists of bouchees, starters, entrees, sides, and desserts. \u00a0Complimentary bread is available upon request. \u00a0They did provide almonds and they were good--crunchy, salty and nicely roasted.  I started with one of their bouchees--baked Cherrystone clams with winter greens, fennel, bacon cream, and toasted bread crumbs. \u00a0It was like a clam chowder amuse bouche. \u00a0The flavor was good. \u00a0It had a good bacon flavor but was not too salty. \u00a0It was also creamy and moist; the bread crumb topping was nicely crispy.  The clams were diced too small though. \u00a0The bouchee kind of lost both the clam flavor and chewy texture.  For my appetizer, I had the duck confit salad with baby kale, crispy fried shallots, fennel, and Medjool dates. \u00a0I was disappointed with the presentation. \u00a0I was hoping for a full duck leg on the bone (it was shredded here). \u00a0The duck was pretty good--crispy on the outside with moist flesh (kind of a small portion).  The baby kale was good and the Medjool dates were as expected--very sweet. \u00a0I liked the fennel. \u00a0The shallots were a little too crunchy for my taste--it would not have been that bad if it was smaller and a more garnish-like portion, but the portion here was big.  The salad was fresh, but it was also too acidic from the heavy dousing of vinaigrette (especially at the bottom of the plate where there was a lot of dressing). \u00a0The acidity of the dressing kind of ruined the salad.  My entree was pan roasted duck and the duck was nicely done. \u00a0The outside skin was very crispy while the meat was very soft (softer than the duck I had at Manresa and Bottega Ristorante). \u00a0The duck also had a good flavor.  While I liked the duck, I was not a fan of the sides. \u00a0The carrots and other vegetables were nicely cooked and tender though I did not like the polenta-like puree at the base of the plate. \u00a0It did not have a great flavor. \u00a0There was also too much of it and its blandness kind of lessened the impact of the other ingredients (arugula, cara cara oranges).  I think the duck could be done really well here, but the mushy and bland sides really did not showcase the protein in the best possible light.  Dessert was good. \u00a0I had the chicory panna cotta, which was topped with an espresso gelee and blood orange. \u00a0The panna cotta was a very generous portion and it was quite good. \u00a0It was very creamy and the panna cotta had a great coffee flavor (nice and distinct). \u00a0The citrus on the top was fresh and tart, but it was kind of unnecessary.  There was also a garnish of chocolate sea salt cookies. \u00a0These looked dry, but they were actually pretty good--crisp and with a rich chocolate flavor.  Service was good. \u00a0The food came out at a quick pace and the staff was personable and polite.  As mentioned, prices were good. \u00a0The portions are not incredibly big, but they are generous enough where you can get out of here with a filling meal but also still without having to spend too much--at least when compared to SF's other highly rated restaurants.  Frances features the kind of upscale rustic cuisine that I like. They also utilize high quality, fresh and seasonal ingredients. \u00a0And best of all, they cook those ingredients with great technique to deliver food with the right texture, moisture and flavor. \u00a0Despite all of that, I did not love the dishes I had. \u00a0It might have been that I just ordered the wrong dishes (the steak dish looked incredibly good).  While I did not love Frances, it showed enough potential that I will likely make a return visit and would also recommend it if you are looking for a high-end San Francisco restaurant that is not too expensive.  Parking is hard to find, but you should be able to find street parking if you are willing to walk a little.",

    "review_text": "The best part was definitely the applewood smoked BACON BEIGNETS!!! Wow, they were so crunchy on the outside, yet slightly moist and fluffy on the inside. Not too salty at all, just a nice savory, bacon-y flavor that the chive creme fraiche complimented extremely well. I think I need two orders of this next time as each order only came with five! I was savoring every little bite.  The other dishes weren't as impressive though. I thought the lobster mushroom linguine appetizer was a bit too salty (especially from the mushrooms). The acclaimed bavette steak was a bit bland. And the stuffed quail had an interesting texture on the inside (almost like a pureed steamed pork). My favorite part was actually the veggies that came with the stuffed quail -- white corn and chantrelle mushrooms as well as padr\u00f3n peppers!!  The next best part came at dessert. We ordered the 'plaisir sucre' with carmelized pear, dark chocolate, walnut dacquoise, cocoa toffee. We thought it was going to be a light layered cake, but it turned out to be a pretty dense brownie-like texture. Still SO GOOD though. They also surprised me with a birthday candle, even though it wasn't my birthday. There are good mistakes in the world, and this was one of them. ;)   All in all, a good two hours well spent at Frances!   P.S. There was plenty of bar seating for groups of 1-2 up until about 7pm on a Sunday evening, in case you didn't make a reservation and would like to treat yourself to a nice meal.",

Honestly I think I had too high hopes for France's. Good but just average to me.   Applewood smoked bacon beignets are a must try and I love their Linguine alle Vongole.

    "review_text": "Despite all the 5* reviews (and the Michelin star!), I'm disappointed by my dining experience at Frances. I've given this much thought, so bear with me while I give you the breakdown.  Seating + Ambiance: There are 10 seats at the bar that take walk-ins, but it's a tight fit. \u00a0While we were seated at a table, they're all squished together so I don't see too much of a difference in snagging a table spot except for the fact that you get to sit across from someone rather than next to them. While I understand that it's meant to maximize the amount of tables for the restaurant, it really made the experience less enjoyable. It was loud, hard to hear your dining companion and we were seated so close to the tables next to us that we had about an inch clearance.  Food: Bacon beignets: We had heard so much about the bacon beignets that we felt it was a must-order. They were light and had a subtle bacon flavour without the heavy grease. Very good, but not something I'd rave about. \u00a0 Grilled calamari: Well done, but again, nothing that I felt was a 'wow'.  Clams: The real star. This hit it out of the park for me with a more complex flavour with the blend of diced ingredients. Spugnole pasta: Wow, what a disappointment. Albeit well cooked, I just can't abide $14 for 9 pieces of pasta. Salmon: Well cooked, but just a bit too much salt. Straight forward, well done, but lacking something extra special. Quail: This needs to come off the menu. There's absolutely nothing special about this dish -- no special sauce or seasoning, nada. So while you have to put up with the tiny little bones (it's a small bird, after all), I just didn't feel it was worth it for what it tasted like. At $26, I felt robbed. Dessert was the Apple Tarte Tatin. It was perfectly adequate but I wasn't feeling like my sweet tooth was properly satisfied. I started to actually dream of the dessert I had last time I was at Wexler's (a must for dessert!).  Service: For a restaurant of this calibre, I expect really attentive and spot-on service. Aside from the warm and friendly greeting from the host, I didn't feel it from our waiter. In fact, I even remarked during our meal that I felt like our waiter didn't like us! \u00a0He rarely checked on us, we had to ask for bread then weren't given a knife for the butter. The real sour note was when I raved about the clams to him, he barely acknowledged me.   I really, really wanted to love Frances and can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I was that I didn't! \u00a0While it had its moments, I think there are plenty of other restaurants in SF that deserve the praise (and 1 month+ waits) than here.",

    "review_text": "So actually 3.5 stars for me.  I like the whole idea of Frances. \u00a0It's located in the Castro, one of my favorite microcosms of San Francisco. \u00a0Frances is the type of restaurant that is reshaping the meaning of haute cuisine on the West Coast. \u00a0Gone are the days of white linen table cloths, suited waiters, and opulent settings, in place are light features, a wooded bar, and a staff that showcases the surroundings of a neighborhood with such unique diversity and personality that any other style of restaurant in this location would surely fail. \u00a0  I think the owners of Frances are on the right track. \u00a0They must be. \u00a0It is nearly impossible to book a reservation, which makes sense considering there are only seven or eight tables in the restaurant. \u00a0The only way to get in is to walk-in and sit at the bar, which is what my partner and I did. \u00a0The menu is unassumingly simple with small bites, appetizers, and entrees and a very approachable wine list that features a proprietary blend sold by the ounce.   In terms of substance, however, Frances just is not quite there, yet. \u00a0I still consider Frances a young restaurant, garnering a Michelin star for the second time this last year. \u00a0The service has no issues from what I saw. \u00a0They are attentive, charming and unobtrusive, they are not afraid to make suggestions and take the time to make you feel comfortable.  The food was good, sometimes excellent. \u00a0The baked clams were just ok, flavorful and well balanced, however the underlying elements of corn, bacon and kale really masked the natural flavor of the clams. \u00a0I would have personally preferred if the clams were left whole rather done in a brunoise just so I could enjoy the texture of the clams alongside of the accoutrement's.   The bacon beignets are perfect. \u00a0They are so good that I had a second order. \u00a0I even convinced the people next to me to order them as well. \u00a0I could eat twelve of them right now and its 2am. \u00a0(Damn...now I am hungry...)  The calamari \"salad\" was a miss for me, completely. \u00a0It had no structure or elevated finesse, \u00a0it came in a small bowl, and It was missing something, perhaps a crisped element that could have given some textural contrast to the calamari (the Garbanzo was there for texture but I still needed more crunch). \u00a0 It had wonderful acidity but all in all was just not remarkable. \u00a0  The pasta and little gem salad were really quite good, another highlight. \u00a0They both had great balance and vibrancy of flavor. \u00a0The ingredients were fresh and vivacious, and were a great precursor to the entrees.   Entrees, I believe are the hardest to execute, normally they are larger portions which makes them more susceptible to error. \u00a0The Bavette Steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, however I would have liked a char on the steak for some texture, but the accompaniments were stellar. \u00a0I love the cannelini beans, they were cooked skillfully and the green sauce (no idea what it was) paired beautifully. \u00a0The dish was simple, rustic, and well executed. \u00a0The halibut unfortunately was overcooked and dry. \u00a0Fish is hard to do, I realize, but it has to be done exceptionally, especially in a Michelin starred house. \u00a0The flavor was fine, but I could not get past the dryness. \u00a0   The summer gratin was amazing. \u00a0I could have quintupled the portion. \u00a0Again, sticking along the lines of rusticity and simplicity is a winning concept. I appreciate this style way more than that of the tweezer placement of salad greens on a deconstructed mess of a plate that you find at most restaurants. \u00a0I digress however, because the fried green tomatoes were not good at all. \u00a0There was no crust, the tomatoes were just cut in half and were really not reminiscent of a Michelin star dish at all.  So as you can see, there are great moments and not so great moments. \u00a0The consistency is not there yet, but I believe with some more refinement that Frances can be one of the more dynamic and enjoyable restaurants in the Bay Area. \u00a0I will probably come back during the Winter season to see what they can do with root vegetables and of course to have an order or two more of the bacon beignets.",

    "review_text": "After staying in San Francisco for 4 nights, Frances was the restaurant where we had our most DELICIOUS meal! \u00a0  Here is what we ordered:   Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets - Delicious! \u00a0Slightly crispy on the outside but fluffy and full of flavor on the inside. \u00a0This came with a side of the Maple Chive Creme Fraiche which was perfectly flavored and slightly sweet. \u00a0Paired perfectly with the beignets.  Local King Salmon - Salmon had great flavor and veggies were not overcooked. \u00a0  Five-Dot Ranch Bavette Steak - Our FAVORITE dish of the night! \u00a0The steak was cooked to PERFECTION--medium rare. \u00a0They also poured au jus/gravy over the steak and it was AMAZING; you could taste the sweetness of the wine in the gravy that was poured over the steak; and the figs were a very unconventional yet ingenious pairing with the tender meat, along with the Porcini Mushrooms. \u00a0In my opinion, this dish is a MUST ORDER.  Wine - 2011 Medlock Ames Cabernet/Merlot/Cab Franc, Alexander VAlley - Couldn't recommend a better wine to pair with the dinner.  Lumberjack Cake - This dessert was very good. \u00a0I especially loved the Muscovado Ice Cream. \u00a0I am a chocolate lover and usually go for more rich desserts, but it was nice to do a lighter tasting dessert for a change. \u00a0  What I loved most about this restaurant is how clean everything tasted. \u00a0The chefs did a wonderful job at not over-doing it with spices. \u00a0You could taste the individual flavors of every piece of meat, vegetable, fruit and sauce on the dish without it all tasting like each other.",

The place is small, very neighborhoody and fit for foodies but it's also extremely noisy and the tables are way too close together. \u00a0You're literally elbow to elbow with diners which is not fun and for a nice Saturday night dinner with my husband it's lacking in intimacy. \u00a0The service however was great, friendly, attentive, knowledgeable. \u00a0Everything you want a restaurant to be.  For the starters we had the bacon beignets and calamari. \u00a0Both were great and we loved the smaller portions to be able to get our taste buds going and start enjoying the wine. \u00a0The calamari were tender, which most places never get right and they had great flavor balance. \u00a0The beignets were addictive, well executed, the dipping sauce was also a nice combo of sweet and salty with the bacon.  For the main dishes we had the steak and scallops and a side of the squash. \u00a0The scallops were amazing, I wanted more and the sauce was great. \u00a0The steak was just OK, a bit chewy and the side of barley was a bit dry. \u00a0The squash was great and the currants brought out a nice flavor paired with the smokiness of the squash. \u00a0  For dessert we had the souffle like dessert which was good but not special, it was forgettable. \u00a0  Our tab was $100, not much and that was with a corkage fee. \u00a0For the price this place is great, better than many in the city and definitely a place I would come back. \u00a0Not sure how the bar seating works but it looked crowded.",

    "review_text": "Just putting this out there: Frances does not deserve its 4.5 stars. I really do take issue with SF so-called \"foodies\" overgenerous Yelp ratings. Would someone be so kind as to explain to me where these undeserved stars come from? I really do not think Frances, for all its cozy lighting, hipstery decor, menu font and service deserves such high praise. Really, I have had MUCH better.  After hearing that the entrees at Frances were so-so, we decided to skip the entrees altogether and stuck with the bouchees and the appetizers. Of the bouchees, we ordered everything except for the smoke eggplant and fennel tapenade, mostly because it did not seem particularly interesting. Here's the breakdown:  Baked Cherrystone Clams: pretty good, but very salty and really rich.   Panisse Frites: super salty, pretty bland by themselves. The raisen caponata was meh. Completely unmemorable.  Grilled Calamari: probably the best bouchee. A slightly disturbing dining experience when a green inch worm crawled out and proceeded to crawl, excuse me, inch its way around the bowl. Organic, yes. Did I want the extra protein with my food? No.   Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets: I really did not enjoy these. All I could taste was salt (emphasis on salt), fried dough and bacon. In theory an excellent, mouth-watering combination. Unfortunately, the execution was not there. I will say that the creme fraiche made it better, but still not enough to entice me to eat more.  Spugnole Pasta: it was fine, probably not as salty as everything else, but not impressive.   Chocolate Almond 'Clafoutis': the chocolate cake was fine and I liked the banana in the middle. It was light and didn't have a strong chocolate flavor. The toasted almond ice cream was not great. I've definitely had better almond ice cream elsewhere and I was generally unimpressed. I could have used more chocolate in the cake, more almond in the ice cream and I am not sure what the caramelized bananas were doing in the mix. I appreciated the banana in the middle of the cake, but the caramelized banana under the ice cream didn't quite mesh well. I would reconsider this dessert altogether to be honest.   Overall, I did not think Frances had much to offer that was extremely memorable. I found the food to be overly salty; I don't think I have had that much water to drink at a meal in a really long time. Less sodium, please! Most of the bouchees were extremely rich and felt very heavy. A lot of dishes sounded great on paper, but in practice, they were disappointing or not as well executed as I would have hoped. Save your time and money. Frances is not worth waiting around months for a reservation.",

The only dish that didn't absolutely blow us away were the gnocchi and I think that's only because everything else was so amazing, that even though the gnocchi were perfectly cooked, fluffy and airy, the flavor just didn't stand up to the other wonderful dishes.   The dishes that stood out were the corn soup, the duck breast, and the lumberjack cake, all of which were not only perfectly cooked but also completely original and bursting with flavor.

Bacon beignets- was delicious and I hate bacon, but the bacon here was incorporated well into the beignets dough mixture making it into an unforgettable taste! Calamari was light and refreshing.  Entree:  I got the duck breast- it was a bit overcooked because it was tougher than usual, but the polenta and the vegetables definitely blend well with the duck, paired with rivera red wine was definitely a great choice. My friend got the steak, and it was cooked perfectly.  Dessert: We got the palnea cotta and the lumberjack cake. THE LUMBERJACK CAKE WAS SO GOOD THAT I THINK I WILL GIVE IT A FIVE IN MY BLOG!! It looked plain like a fruitcake, but the taste was unforgettable. Definitely need to try it! It wasn't so sweet that it overpowers your palette, and the ice cream that comes with it was a great addition!

    "review_text": "Frances, like so many other places in SF, has been on my list for quite awhile. \u00a0It took a special occasion, aka my birthday!, to venture out for dinner here. \u00a0I made my rez a little over a month before, but maybe that's because I wanted to eat early Sunday evening so I could get back home in time for the sun to still be out and I wouldn't miss Game of Thrones.  Things started off well here, since we were seated immediately. \u00a0One thing that I have sort of a personal problem with is the extremely tight seating configuration so many SF restaurants are challenged with, so for the people who sat next to us who put up with my ranting about my life's problems, I'm sorry. We brought our own wine ($20 corkage), and got down to ordering right away.  We were both pretty hungry, so we kicked dinner off with the bread that was getting passed around, and ordered the following:  Appetizers: - Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets w/ Maple Chive Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche: Easily one of the best things we ate all night. I love bacon, and I love beignets, so this was a dreamy combo for me! - Roasted Turnip Empanada - Sultana Raisin, Salsa Verde: I was so-so on this, but Greg liked it. The crispy dough was definitely good. - Linguine 'Carbonara' - Smoked Chicken, English Peas, Parmesan and Cream: Surprisingly, the thing that made this dish the best was the peas! This was a perfect dish to share, and the serving size per person was on point for an appetizer.  Mains: - Bavette Steak - Charred Broccolini, Spigariello Pesto, Fingerling Potato, Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche: We ordered two mains with the intention on sharing. \u00a0The dish was good, but the thing I loved the most was the pesto sauce. \u00a0Otherwise, this was a good dish, but at the end of the day, just a steak dish. - Chicken Roulade - Baby Kale, Roasted Spring Vegetables, Brown Butter Vinaigrette: In the spirit of wanting to be \"healthier\" or at least pay more attention to chicken, I ordered this dish. \u00a0I normally am a steak dinner person, but I thought that the chicken roulade was the better main of the two.  Dessert: - 'Lumberjack' Cake - Stone Fruit, Coconut, Medjool Date, Muscovado Ice Cream: WOW. What a dessert. This was recommended on Yelp, and it definitely did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this even if you think it sounds like a strange combination of things. \u00a0Happy birthday to me.  Overall, Frances is definitely a solid four star place. \u00a0Each dish we had was solid, and aside from the cramped seating, I really didn't have any strong complaints or issues. \u00a0Service was good; our waiter came by to check on how we were doing multiple times, and was helpful when we asked about how many dishes we should be ordering if we were going to be sharing. I would definitely put Frances on your must-try list!",

The service was impeccable. \u00a0We had reservations, showed up on time--when we were not seated right away they were very much aware and apologetic, bringing us an amuse bouche promptly upon seating. \u00a0We were not in any rush and Frances was our destination of the evening, so this was welcomed! \u00a0Me and my partner didn't order any appetizers, just a few Bouchees and our entrees!  We had a market shot upon arrival to start our meal adventure, don't miss out on this touch! 3 oz shot of spiked juice for $3. We also chose to do the Frances Red wine which is offered at $1/oz--It was very pleasant.  Bouchees:  Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets--So good, it is the item that gets discussed the most I think and should definitely not be missed. Baked Cherrystone Clams-- I was most partial to this! Came with three clams, my partner was extremely generous and let me have the third, but it was my birthday! The crumbled bacon was a great touch and really added to the flavor of the clam's mixture. \u00a0The presentation was pleasing--it comes out on 3 large shells, and I am fond of anything nautical. Charred Spring Onion and Sour Cream Dip-- a great take on a sour cream based onion dip.  Entrees:  Brian had the steak and I had the Sonoma Duck Breast. \u00a0He enjoyed the steak, but didn't feel it was as exciting as he wished his entree to be. \u00a0It came on a small bed of mashed potatoes, though the sauce for the steak was flavorful--wish they would have left the whole gravy boat at the table ;) I found the Duck to be extremely exciting. It is hard to find a strong presence of vegetables while dining out at the average establishment. \u00a0There was a good portion of kale with my duck which really wowed me. \u00a0The slightly grilled clementines were very surprising and accompanied my meal wonderfully. And the spiced duck jus was (embarrassingly) spooned up...  For dessert we had planned on the Lumberjack Cake, but when we saw the Port Chocolate Cake, chose that instead (because of a personal love for chocolate cake!) Extremely rich in flavor.  Excellent service, inviting atmosphere, well worth the price (was not even as expensive as we had budgeted, though it could easily get higher in price with more selection and the wine list), I cannot wait to come back to try the rest of the bouchees, appetizers, have a market shot, and indulge in the Lumberjack Cake!",

Desserts: lumberjack cake, and buttermilk panna cotta.  Everything was super flavorful however, I thought the starters out-shined the entrees. The most memorable dishes are the chickpea fritters, celery root soup and the lumberjack cake. The only let down of the night was the buttermilk panna cotta. It needed a whole lot of sugar.  The market shots that night was pear. It was awesome! I could drink a whole pitcher of it but they sold out before we can order more.  The service is casual but friendly, attentive and great.

There's no way I could've \"stumbled\" in here and had a meal. Not only is the place tiny (I think about 30 people fit snugly in here), but it's extremely popular.  To eat: +Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets: served with maple chive creme fraiche. No, it doesn't taste like a hot pocket (as previously mentioned); it's like a porky, smoky donut. It's the creme fraiche that makes it delicious. +Five-Dot Ranch Bavette Steak: served medium rare with a super-buttery lemon risotto, grilled Nardello peppers, chanterelle mushrooms and chimichurri, topped off on-site with a warm Bordelaise sauce. I've noticed that chef Perello adjusts last item to whatever's in season. She's also used fennel pesto in place of the chimichurri. +Local King Salmon: served with a shelling bean sauce, lobster mushroom, green olives, and preserved lemon. The salmon is cooked to perfection. Delicious.  For dessert:  +'Lumberjack Cake': Gravenstein apple, Medjool dates, and coconut cake served with Humphrey Slocombe's maple-walnut ice cream. The cake is tasty, different, but the ice cream and dates together are REALLY sweet. +Boozy Affogato: Humphrey Slocombe vanilla atop hooch topped with espresso. Whoa mama, this is strong!

    "review_text": "A wonderfully delightful experience.   We had an awesome side table, so no space issues whatsoever. I can definitely see where that would happen with the long row of tables though.  Honestly, I was nervous after the first dish - the infamous bacon beignets. It's not that they were bad per se; they just lacked a certain oomph that I had come to expect during my month-long wait and the stellar reviews I read here. Definitely on the oily side as well. Maybe if you have a party of 4+, but for two people this was like a grease bomb pouring directly into your arteries.  Little Gem Salad with tarragon vinaigrette, fennel, kumquat, mandarin, avocado: fan-freakin-tastic. Super crisp flavors and textures. A well-needed cleanse after the beignets. The fennel really brought it all together.  Both of the main entr\u00e9es were delightful.  Caramelized atlantic scallops with sunchoke pur\u00e9e, roasted fennel, and ni\u00e7oise olives. Mmmmmm. I'm still drooling over this dish. The sunchoke pur\u00e9e makes for creamy goodness; although the scallops are so crazy tender they go down like butter themselves.  Halibut with chorizo and butter beans. Almost as equally yums. The crispiness of the chorizo provides an interesting complexity with the delicate halibut, and the butter beans bring it all together.  I'm a big fan of the by-the-liter house wine. Although I wonder how many people don't actually finish the amount the give you. The white went very well with all of the dishes we ordered, but it was tad on the sweet side for my tastes.  Dessert: Lumberjack Cake and Blue bottle French press coffee. I rarely get dessert because I stuff my face too full during dinner, but after the rave reviews (and the all-too-real possibility of having to wait another 2 months before another reservation opened up), this was urgent. Sooooo tasty. The dates and apple make it sweet without being sugary, especially when paired with a cup of delicious black coffee. A perfect end to a(n almost) perfect meal.",

I've generally liked the ones I've been to, though I can think of a couple that were disappointing. But Frances is first one I've been to that is legitimately undeserving of its reputation.  I ended up trying five dishes here:  - Chick pea fritters: do not measure up to the mozzarella sticks at the Olive Garden - Calamari: good, but not any better than dozens of other places - Crab risotto: bland, tasteless - Roasted cauliflower: good, but similar to what I make at home - Lumberjack cake: slightly above-average as far as desserts go  The bigger issue is that the menu as a whole is about as pedestrian as you can get. \u00a0I didn't end up ordering a main course because the offerings were so weak - I got a look at the halibut (for $28) and it was about as boring as could be...Until I saw the crepes with greens and peas, which might have been a frozen entree I was forced to eat as a child. \u00a0It wasn't just the entrees - the clams appetizer only came with two clams.   There are only 16 things on the menu here (20 if you include dessert), so for 4.5 stars and $$$, each and every one of them should be well-thought out and inspiring. On that count, Frances basically fails.  I should note that the service was generally good. However, we were made to wait roughly five minutes without explanation to sit down at our table even though it was empty and set. One of employees (owner, perhaps?) was talking to the people at the table next to ours and it seemed like the host did not want to disturb him. I've never seen anything like that before, and it's decidedly not a 4.5-star way to operate.",

The place was packed and the wait staff graciously found some chairs for us to sit as we waited for an opening.   We ordered the Baked Cherrystone Clams (Fennel, Wild Mushroom, Bacon, Lacinato Kale)... and this was so worth the yummy wait. I would do this appetizer again for sure. Then we ordered the Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets with Maple Chive Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche dipping sauce. I know everyone raves about this dish...it's portioned well with 5 balls in total *no puns about pork and balls, please*...but it's not something I'd order again. I like the salty hit of the bacon pieces, and they're real bacon, not baco bits. But I'm not into savory beignets...I like mine sweet! The ratio of the dough isn't bad..and if it weren't the dipping sauce, it would be too salty.   Laura L. ordered the Poached Local Halibut -with Green Garlic Fumet, Asparagus, Potatoes, Salsify....It was rich and the halibut was flaky and moist from the small sample I tasted.  I got the Vegetable 'Cassoulet' (Beans &amp; Winter Greens, Pt. Reyes Mozzarella, Smokey Pangrattato)...OMG...it was so awesome the first 10 bites I ate...the beans were huge! We couldn't figure out what type of beans they were..cause they were so big. I loved the mozzarella, and the crunchy texture of crumbs made the dish stand out....and then the savory salt of the smokey cheeses hit me bad...I got through 3/4 of the dish before I bowed out and said, I'm full. Laura L. graciously ate the rest cause she was still hungry..haha...  And lastly, for dessert, we ordered the 'Lumberjack' Cake \u00a0(Lady Apple, Kumquat, Medjool Date, Maple Ice Cream)....OH..it was sooooo goooood! I love the fruit variety strewn through the dish. And the maple ice cream was so creamy and at the perfect temperature...you know they did right by it when there's no freezer burn at all. (Trust me, I've had ice cream where it's like digging through an iceberg). The cake was moist, and if you mix the dates up with the ice cream, it cuts through the sweetness.

    "review_text": "With their newly awarded one Michelin star and stellar Yelp reviews, I had high hopes for Frances. Maybe it was just the inflated expectations, but it didn't live up to the hype for me. Overall the food was decent, but certainly not exceptional. My socks remained firmly on my feet and I was mostly just bored. Nothing was all that memorable, and if not for the pictures I took I couldn't tell you what I ate. As for the service it was very friendly but equally slooooooow. The majority of the time I spent at the restaurant was waiting for our food to come. That's what I remember most about that night: waiting.  We started with their famous BACON BEIGNETS (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dMlsQsPU8Y_oiPYC5hHi2A?select=0Ao_H3OHQV7BBYDiGkmL2Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dMls\u2026</a>). I was really looking forward to these but was sorely disappointed. They were lacking in bacon flavour and were a lot denser than you would expect of beignets. (Plus, I'm a yeast donut kinda gal and prefer a lighter fluffier texture.) Their saving grace was the sweet maple cr\u00e8me fraiche; though I didn't taste much maple I devoured the whole thing (not with the bacon beignets but with my Acme bread). The RED GARNET YAMS (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dMlsQsPU8Y_oiPYC5hHi2A?select=6jqMjClxSD5iFw5yxT9Tjw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dMls\u2026</a>) were good, as was the chili aioli. Nothing to rave about though.  I normally never order salads, but at $6.50 for the bouchee portions I decided to try them both. I had no major complaints--or praises--about either one. The GRILLED CALAMARI (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dMlsQsPU8Y_oiPYC5hHi2A?select=YMus58yk5oLdOWgdmDHU_Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dMls\u2026</a>) was tender but bland (you would think grilling would impart some grill flavour) and easily disappeared into the rest of the salad. I liked the crunchiness of the shaved fennel though. The ROASTED BEET &amp; RAINBOW CARROT SALAD (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dMlsQsPU8Y_oiPYC5hHi2A?select=pa1d0px-s23LYZLoY0TaPw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dMls\u2026</a>) tasted like a typical beet salad. Maybe I'm just not the type to get excited about salads. *yawn*  My favourite dish of the night was the TROTTOLONI PASTA &amp; COTECHINO SAUSAGE (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dMlsQsPU8Y_oiPYC5hHi2A?select=Z8atbd8zXIFDCbjt6u5efg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dMls\u2026</a>), partly because the fat coils remind me of intestines (one of my favourite street food in HK). Cooked to a perfect al dente, the pasta was great with the cheesy and flavourful sauce and yummy pork sausage. Shredded black trumpet mushrooms added a nice contrasting texture.  After the glimmer of hope that was the pasta, it was back to the snorefest with the CALIFORNIA BLACK COD (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dMlsQsPU8Y_oiPYC5hHi2A?select=mx6ulzakuVahE8ZrOBG5gA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dMls\u2026</a>). Again, not that it wasn't good, it just didn't blow me away. Maybe a mild breeze. The fish was cooked well enough but nowhere near as rich and buttery as other black cods I've had. The accompaniments (mashed winter squash, creamed leek, chanterelles) were all pretty good.  We also ordered all 3 sides (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dMlsQsPU8Y_oiPYC5hHi2A?select=-o953JjnstIXKSWK6BVyFA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dMls\u2026</a>). I liked the ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS and ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH. Both were nicely cooked and brightened by the acidity of red crimson grapes and pickled currants, respectively. I also really liked the toasted hazelnuts with the Brussels sprouts for their added texture and flavour. The POLENTA, however... The already heavy dish (I literally felt the weight on my tongue) was soaked in a thick pool of oil, which was especially unappetizing given the polenta was so bland. I only ate one spoonful before pushing the bowl aside.  In keeping with the general trajectory of the meal, the desserts were good but I'm not entirely convinced they were worth the extra time at the gym. By itself, the CHOCOLATE &amp; CHESTNUT BREAD PUDDING (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dMlsQsPU8Y_oiPYC5hHi2A?select=vyaQle9wqvS7n0NDhGYqhA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dMls\u2026</a>) was surprisingly bland. I also didn't care for texture of the chestnuts and picked them all out. The best part of was the extremely rich hot chocolate--a little too decadent on its own but ideal for dipping. The CHICORY ROOT PANNA COTTA (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dMlsQsPU8Y_oiPYC5hHi2A?select=M74hiUW8oRlkgA0DFf8pPg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dMls\u2026</a>) had the perfect smooth, creamy, and gelatinous consistency. The coffee flavour was nice but the mandarin didn't go very well with it.  Overall, the meal was lackluster. Just writing about it is making me sleepy all over again.",

I could count the pores on my neighbor's nose it was so close. \u00a0The services was breezy and cheery throughout.  We started with a glass of the house blended wine. It was okay a mix flavors which I didn't find particularly enjoyable. We didn't have another and ordered a bottle of something else, a nice pinot noir.  For the food we began with the infamous beignets. They were good, they really needed the dipping sauce because despite the very strong bacon flavor, they were quite under-seasoned. \u00a0  The linguine with chicken was more successful but it was quite a teeny portion and in contrast to the beignets, they were pretty heavy handed with the salt. \u00a0There must have been around 4 forkfulls of pasta in total.  The bavette was tasty, excellent cooking and the portion of the main course was decent. \u00a0The chicken roulade was good too and the spring onion gratin was delicious. \u00a0  The lumberjack cake with ice cream was a triumph. Great flavors that really complemented each other. \u00a0  So all in all it was a good meal, over $200 for 2 of us so it might remain a bit of a special treat rather than a go-to. \u00a0The only down side for me was that the menu was small and, dare I say it, not enormously exciting/interesting but everything that was served was executed well.",

I really hope this was just my bad luck.  I saw the girl in the kitchen pick up a dirty towel off the floor, then went back to her cart and continued handling food. At some point she also grabbed a step stool, something your dirty shoes touch, and then went back to prepping food. She did not wash her hands the entire time we were there.

Congrats to Frances team.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The place is quite small, tables are so closed to each others almost feel as communal tables to me.

FOOD: - Almonds as amuse bouche.  - Applewood smoked bacon beignets with Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche &amp; chive - this came with 5 beignets, really crispy outside &amp; super soft &amp;inside, dipping with the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, great snack.  - Grilled calamari gypsy peppers, preserved lemon, Sicilian olive - this was really nice, refreshing dish.  - Roasted celery soup, chicken confit, saut\u00e9ed baby turnips &amp; sunchokes - rich and creamy, full flavor.  - Baked Iacopi butter beans, braised pork trotter &amp; pangrattato - love the aroma of it, excellent side dish.  - California black cod, roasted polentta, mustard greens, escarole &amp; crispy shallots - nice &amp; moist cod.  WINES: - 2006 Domaine Joseph Roty Marsannay (France, Burgundy, C\u00f4te de Nuits, Marsannay) $16 per glass- really nice, smooth&amp; light.  - 2008 Domaine Anne Gros Bourgogne Hautes C\u00f4tes de Nuits $14 per glass, nice &amp; fruity.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Service by Graham bartender, he was super nice &amp; helpful in pairing the wines.

RSVP: 2 months in advance if you want din din at 7-9:30 PM slots, but if you come in at 5PM, chances are you will get a spot at the bar, or even tables!   P.S. Only 1 unisex wash room!

We got the Bacon Beignets, Tagliatelle with mushrooms, a Quail Entree, a Steak Entree, and a Chocolate Walnut Torte with Salted Caramel Ice Cream -- all were delicious. I would describe each, but I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.   DRINKS!!! Wine was done by the ounce, an interesting concept considering I don't drink much to start. Their house white wine was mildly sweet, and perfect for my dish. I saw many people getting the house wine, so don't be shy!!  SERVICE!!! - We arrived 1/2 hr before our actual reservation and we were seated right away.  - Costas was our main server. He provided great service and sold me on the dessert. He even took a picture of us and got down on his knee to take the picture from the best angle possible. Needless to say, it turned out to be my favorite picture for the night. - Although this model may only work in small restaurants, I found their service to be highly efficient and on top of their game. Despite Costas being our main server, it didn't matter which server passed by our table. Whenever a plate was empty, it was picked up.  - We also didn't have to hold our coats or place it anywhere! The hostess placed our coats in a closet and Costas knew exactly which ones were ours when it was time to leave!

    "review_text": "Picture this: a restaurant the size of a shoebox, crammed full of adult-sized people (aka \"adults\"), add tables and chairs, throw in thirty people more than capacity allows, place it in the best area (Castro) of one of the best cities in the world (San Francisco), and slap it with a Michelin star. Wha-la! Frances is born.  It's no secret that San Francisco is a walking town. It's a fact; for every mile a car drives in San Francisco, a hippie cries. So after walking what felt like a million miles my friend and I were ready to eat our left hands. We walked down a dark, horror movie-like street that is 17th Street until we finally saw the only sign of life; the lights shining through the window at Frances. Hallelujah!  When we walked inside and out of the frigid cold, we were greeted immediately by someone's back. Well, actually it was lots of backs. Like seven or eight backsides blocking us from stuffing our faces with food. What the? After finally inflicting enough bruises to the people, they let us pass and we made it all the way inside (about three steps). I told the maitre d' my name and asked how long the wait would be. He said for two people it would take at least an hour. Ugh! Okay so this is the part where Frances falls short. We couldn't simply put our names on a list and roam around Castro for an hour. Oh no, that would be too convenient. He said we weren't allowed to leave if we wanted to wait for a table. This meant we had to stand awkwardly by the door for an hour. As if that weren't enough, we were practically being suffocated by the other people waiting for tables, as well as the servers constantly squeezing past us to attend to their tables. To make a very long, very boring, and very uncomfortable story short, we finally got seated after an hour and fifteen minutes.  We were lucky enough to grab a table toward the back of the restaurant and we didn't get stuck in a... well... jokingly tight counter seat. Seriously, wait until you see for yourself just how tight these chairs are. Anyway, we were handed our menus and a small cup of warm, salted almonds were placed in front of us. Almonds are almonds, there's no need for a review on those things. But they were good. The menu here is small. Very small. Four entrees, eight or so appetizers, and four desserts is all you get to choose from. However the Michelin star speaks for itself. My friend ordered the Five Dot Ranch bavette steak (with toasted farro ragout, maitakes, and fava greens). I'm not a steak eater, but I had to try a nibble because the presentation was so beautiful. It was juicy, flavorful, tender and whatever else. Talk to a steak guy if you want a professional opinion on the steak. I went with the carnaroli risotto (with fontina val d'aosta, red Russian kale, and wild mushrooms). The sauce was probably the creamiest, heaviest, tastiest sauce I've ever tasted on a risotto dish. The portion was small but the thick, amazing sauce made it very filling.  After the ridiculously long wait, we hadn't nearly gotten enough out of Frances yet. So to feel more complete we wanted dessert! We ordered the chocolate and chestnut bread pudding (with hot chocolate and cream) and the chicory root panna cotta (with satsuma Mandarin, espresso gelee, and chocolate sea salt cookies). The bread pudding was okay. The extremely rich chocolate baked into the skillet surprisingly didn't have too much flavor. Weird, eh? But the hot chocolate helped the dish to explode. It was served in a small cup alongside the skillet. Our server instructed us to pour it over the pudding, but not all at once. We used our genius prehistoric intellect and decided to dunk each bite rather than pouring it on top. The panna cotta was amazing though. It was practically like espresso pudding that had been put in the freezer for thirty minutes (the consistency was almost right between gelato and pudding) with small orange slices laid on top. I'm seriously drooling even thinking about it. Especially when added to the sea salt cookies it was perfect. My best friend and date only weighs about six pounds so she couldn't finish the desserts (we were sharing both). Lucky me! I quickly jumped at the opportunity to finish both desserts and scarfed them down in record speed. Charming huh? Thanks.  Once we were all done we had spent three and a half hours inside the doors of Frances. The funny part is they're only open for five hours a night. When going to Frances, make reservations far in advance (I tried two days beforehand and they were all taken, hence the long wait). If you aren't lucky enough to score a ressie be sure to bring a lawn chair to plop outside. Your feet, spine, and legs will thank you!",

    "review_text": "I'm very surprised by all the 5 star ratings for Frances. \u00a0We certainly enjoyed our meal there - thought the food was good to very good and the service was fantastic - but we don't think it warrants a 7-8 week wait for a 5:45pm booking. \u00a0  The space is very small and cramped, which makes the incredible service all the more impressive. \u00a0And they've managed to keep the noise under control - well done again. \u00a0But you will be touching your neighbors and feeling very constricted throughout your meal, which is a bit of a drag.   In terms of food: as many have said, the bacon beignets are simply delicious - yum. The grilled calamari \"salad\" and the celery root soup were both great, cleanly flavored and wonderfully executed. \u00a0Unfortunately our steak and scallop entrees didn't match up to the earlier items. Both were perfectly cooked from the proteins to the risotto to the butter beans - perfectly. \u00a0But each item was overpowered by one flavor - the steak by red peppers and the scallops by lemon. It was literally all we could taste. We were so disappointed that those gorgeous proteins were lost.  So between the difficulty in getting in, the space, the price and the less than perfect food, I don't understand all the 5 star ratings. \u00a0 We think there are other restaurants at this price point with better food and more space where you can get a prime time booking with a couple weeks notice (SPQR, Slanted Door etc).",

    "review_text": "When a co-worker asked me one day, \"Have you been to Frances? It's the most sought-after reservation in SF.\", I admittedly took the bait and logged onto Open Table to make a reservation. And quite frankly, I'm unashamedly glad that I did.   The menu at Frances is simple, and I don't mean that negatively. There are only ever a few items available in each course. It's most definitely about quality, not quantity. Menu changes regularly, which is all the more reason to come back..! On this particular visit, the hubby &amp; I ordered:   - Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets - Maple Creme Fraiche and Chive. This dish lives up to the hype and then some. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside - a perfect duet.  - Parmesan and Ricotta Gnocchi - Boccalone pancetta, chanterelles, napa cabbage. The gnocchi was light and flavorful. The pancetta and chanterelles were perfect complements to the gnocchi.  - Five Dot Ranch steak - YUM.  - Braised Liberty Farm Duck Leg - The duck was really tender and moist. And though I don't eat much butter beans or olives, both really rounded out the dish. Great flavors.  - 'Lumberjack Cake' - apples, Medjool dates, and maple-nut ice cream. Just the perfect portion after an already filling meal. Not overly sweet, either.   Bread is available upon request. Just flag down one of the uber-accommodating wait staff. Table was cleaned (not just cleared) after every course, which I have to say, I'm a sucker for. I've heard the wines are fairly decent, but we went with the $1-per-ounce option and it was great! \u00a0They serve Humphry Slocombe ice cream and Blue Bottle Coffee. [score!] \u00a0The location is truly a neighborhood gem; you'd easily pass it by if you're not paying attention. Parking can be a b!tch, but you might get lucky, especially if you have a later rez.   Overall, it was a simply wonderful experience. Two enthusiastic thumbs up..!",

Finally, my partner and I decided to brave a Sunday walkin at 5:30 pm. Of course, it was already nearly full and we had to sit at the counter, which I equated to United Economy. Seriously, sardines have more room in a can.   We had the bacon beignets and a little gem salad as starters -- both very good, but not rock my world good. I had the steak for an entre. No one ever asked how I wanted it done. It came out rather rare (not my taste) so I didn't even finish it.  Our server was delightful and attentive. I think SF foodies are masochists: If it's insanely crowded, loud, and near impossible to get into, it must be good. Right?!   I will say that for the Castro, and its pathetic dining choices, Frances is a strong presence, but, if it were just a few blocks over on Valencia (or just about anywhere else in the city), it would be pretty average.",

    "review_text": "I am in LOVE.  Quicktip: MAKE RESERVATIONS IN ADVANCE.  This place.... THIS place... is a hidden gem in the Castro district. Tucked away in between homes, it's a bit easy to miss so drive slowly if you're looking for it!  This place is PERFECT to impress a date or friends and the price is just so affordable for the quality of food you'll be stuffing into your face. You will walk out with one of the best culinary experiences of your life.  I've eaten here twice now and it always keeps me wanting to come back for more. And makes me want to try something new. I love restaurants than make you want to come back and try something new every time. That's how you know they know what they are doing.  The service is top-notch. My wine glass was never empty.  ------- First visit:  One of the first things I noticed when I walked in was that EVERY plate a server was clearing off the tables were CLEAN. Every morsel was devoured. The dishwasher must have an easy job at Frances; the customers do most of the cleaning!  * Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets - Maple Creme Fraiche &amp; Chive: What they are KNOWN for. These little suckers pack a pretty bold bacon taste for being a type of pastry. Sweet, but smoky. Everyone loves bacon.  * Dungeness Crab Salad - Little Gems, Terragon Vinaigrette, Satsuma Mandarins: Refreshing and the dressing didn't overpower the fresh taste of the crab. The mandarin oranges added a burst of citrus that went so well with the dish.  * California Black Cod - Roasted Winter Squash, Creamed Leeks, Chanterelles: Oh dear lord... The best black cod I've had so far. It was moist and melted in my mouth. For my first time having leeks in any form, I must say... It was really tasty.  * Lumberjack Cake - Sierra Beauty Apple, Medjool Dates, Maple-Walnut Ice Cream: Always for a first time visit to any restaurant, I ask the server for the most popular dessert dish. Turns out that this was it. The Lumberjack. Sounds manly, but the dish itself was loaded with apple flavor. *sigh* tasted like a fancied-up apple pie... and it was DELISH.  ------- Second visit: Valentine's Day Pre-fixe menu of 4 courses for $55/person  * Caviar served in a Poached Hen Egg: This was NOT part of the pre-fixe, but it was a special for that night. I've never tried caviar before, so I was kind of excited. The presentation was beautiful. The caviar was not as salty as I thought it would be and it paired nicely with the ooey-gooey poached hen egg in the bottom of the eggshell.  * Avocado &amp; Maine Lobster Salad: Just the right size with fresh lobster. The shaved fennel made it even more refreshing as I bit into it. The meyer lemon added a tiny bit of citrus that always goes well with lobster.  * Black Bass, Roasted Spring Onion &amp; Canaroli Risotto, Cipollino Onion Soubise: Again... The fish was cooked perfectly. Flaky, but so moist. The risotto was the best risotto I have every had........ Sigh.  * Bavette Steak \"Bourguignon\", Butter Ball Potato Ragout, Hedgehog Mushrooms, Bacon Lardon, Bloomsdale Spinach, Red Wine Jus: Cooke medium rare (like a steak should be prepared lol). I actually think this is on their regular dinner menu. So tender and you can taste the natural flavor of the meat through the sauce.  * Ricotta Crespelle, Honey &amp; Wheat Flour Crepe, Winter Citrus Compote: Don't be fooled at these 2 pieces... They're quite filling VERY tasty. The ricotta was so smooth, but chunky. The crepe was perfectly cook. It wasn't overcooked and crispy, but it was soft all around. The citrus compote added a nice touch of sweetness.  Ended Valentine's Day dinner with 2 hear-shaped cookies. How cute ;)",

Overall, it was a nice meal and food was generally very good and service was attentive. However, I'm honestly not so sure about their Michelin Star. Comparing them to other 1-Star places, it seems that it is underachieving their star  We ordered the baked clams on the shell which were to die for and a huge bargain. We also ordered the squid ink pasta, which was good, but there are far more superior squid ink pastas at other restaurants. My girlfriend ordered the duck as her entree and I had the steak bavette. Both dishes were excellent, the duck was better than mine I think, but mine was still very good. We also ordered dessert, but I had forgotten what we ordered.   Like I said the food itself was very good and I have no complaints. But to be honest, a lot of the food they have here can be found at other restaurants at a similar quality and execution, which is why I'm a little baffled with their Michelin Star, I wasn't too blown away. But, the price point is definitely lower than at other similarly rated restaurants, so it may be something I can overlook.",

    "review_text": "My last meal of the year, my last meal of the decade. Luckily I made reservations ahead of time. If it weren't already highly anticipated enough because of Melissa Perello's first foray on her own, it was New Year's Eve. We were running a bit on the late side, I called to inform them and even after that we waited a good 15-20 minutes. The space is actually not that big; some would call intimate, filled with the booming conversation around us.   There's a small bar area to the left of the entrance and exactly one circular table on the opposite side for a group of 4-5 to the right. The dining area lines the long hallway space on the right side and the kitchen with it's small pass/service window adjacent. We were seated pretty tightly in the middle of the main area. The place was packed and it was already starting to show that the service was slammed.   They only do wine and wine based cocktails for alcohol so we got a Syrah and one of their specialty drinks the Bitter Orange. Man that Orange drink was addictive. I could have polished many of those things. After perusing the menu we went with:  -Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets w/ Creme Fraiche and Chive -Chestnut Soup - Roasted Cipollini Onions, Pancetta -Semolina Gnocchi - Duck Confit, Braised Cavolo Nero -Slow Roasted Beef - Creamed Winter Greens, Potato Puree -Skate Wing - Brussel Sprouts, Chrorizo  The food was fantastic. Chef Perello lives up to her Aqua and Fifth Floor lineage. The service was a bit slow in between courses and we knew that from the beginning as the kitchen was slammed. The food was five stars but the staffing I think needs to be beefed up if they're going to be packed wall to wall this like all the time. Im definitely looking forward to going back, I just hope the craziness dies down a bit. 4.5 stars",

We sat in the corner right next to the window so we got a little bit of extra space, but it was still not very roomy. I'm not a very big person and I found it kind of crowded inside the restaurant, so it probably will not be very comfortable for bigger individuals, especially you'll most likely be there for around 2 hours.   The food was decent at Frances. The ingredients were very fresh and you'll actually feel healthy eating their food. The only problem I had was for some reason the dishes we ordered were all kind of sour from the tomato and/or lemon. I love sour food, but it got a little bit too much when every dish was a little bit sour. Maybe when we went it was tomato season, so there was at least one dish from each category (appetizer, entr\u00e9e, side) that had tomato in it, and somehow we got most of those dishes...Anyhow, if you're looking for a place to go for a casual and light dinner, Frances is a decent choice.   Expedition #3 Food: Good Service: Good Atmosphere: Casual, a little crowded Average price per person: ~$65 (including tax &amp; tips) Parking: Street parking, kind of hard to find Time spent for the meal: ~2hr.",

Maybe the tables are too close for comfort, but I see it as cozy, and I had no problem sharing conversation across the table. My expectations were maybe too high, but the food overall, along with the intimate SF/French bistro-style charm and the friendly staff (and maybe the fact that I can walk there from my apartment, to a cute deserted nighttime neighborhood right behind my library branch, which all feels romantic to me) won me over.   The bacon beignets were not as airy or amazing as I'd expected, but still good. The squid ink pasta with bottarga was addictively good. I had the lamb loin (I was splurging), which was great -- tender, cooked almost perfectly -- but my friend's duck breast was the feast of the night. I didn't even appreciate duck until I had this dish. These dishes are not aggressively innovative, but everything is fulfilling nonetheless. It's a mastery of higher-end comfort food; Frances' well-known, well-worn dishes that still please me immensely. Whatever you do, listen to the waiter and get the duck.  The chocolate dessert was pleasing but not amazing. In retrospect I would've chosen the boozy affogato, because I love affogatos and after a substantial meal it's probably a better choice than a full dessert. I'll definitely come back to sample dishes here and there. This place is a treat.",

    "review_text": "Overall, a very good meal for a reasonable price but it didn't quite blow me away. \u00a0Our app and dessert were both excellent but entrees weren't amazing and I wasn't a huge fan of the ambiance which is loud, with tables smushed right against each other. \u00a0  Reservations are super hard to get here - we made them over \u00a0a month in advance and were only able to get 5:15 on a Sunday. \u00a0 We were running late today and we called them and let them know. \u00a0They were very nice about it and said they could hold our table for 30 minutes past the reservation. \u00a0It took us awhile to find street parking (they don't have valet) and we made it there just in the nick of time. \u00a0We were seated immediately.  We shared the chilled corn soup as an appetizer ($12). \u00a0Creamy corn soup is poured over chunks of avocado, creme fraiche, pickled chanterelle mushrooms and cornmeal wafers. \u00a0 We both agreed it was excellent. \u00a0For our entrees, my husband had steak ($28) and a vegetarian cassoulet ($18). \u00a0My husband enjoyed his dish and I tried it and agreed the steak was tasty. \u00a0He particularly enjoyed the accompaniments, which were more creative than the usual potatoes. \u00a0My cassoulet was ok but it felt like they sort of just dumped the beans, squash, and cheese in a pot together. \u00a0There weren't a whole lot of other flavors going on and it was hard to get more than one ingredient in a single bite. \u00a0For dessert we shared a chocolate stout cake ($9) which was great. \u00a0It was warm (but not liquid or anything) and was dark and rich. \u00a0It had some crushed cookies on top that gave it a nice crunch and an excellent burnt caramel sauce around the base. \u00a0There is complimentary bread on request but they just bring you out a slice each instead of giving you the loaf.  Note that the menu changes frequently and is very limited, with only 4 entrees. \u00a0I think I would have enjoyed my entree more if they'd had something more to my tastes but none of the entrees today grabbed me. \u00a0I love to order fish in restaurants but the only fish entree on the menu was tuna, which I don't like. \u00a0  As I mentioned I wasn't a fan of the ambiance which was a little too \"cool\" for me. \u00a0The tables are all super close together and we had to listen to the conversation of the insufferable, name-droppy couple sitting next to us. \u00a0It's also loud and I had difficulty hearing both my husband and the waiter. \u00a0The service was good, although our dishes, particularly the entrees, took a very long time to come out. \u00a0  I'd definitely come back if I lived in the neighborhood but I'm not sure its quite as much a destination place as the Yelp reviews would have you believe.",

To start off we had a wonderful waiter, he was attentive and wonderful.  We started with the bacon beignets! Oh my, those were that tastiest things I have ever tried. I want to wake up every morning to a cup of coffee and those beignets. Seriously.  Second we had the peppers, which I was fairly warned that one will be VERY hot. And of course, when sharing the dish with my mom, I get that flaming hot pepper. Warning, it ruins your mouth for a good 10 min. Overall, they were yummy!  Then the corn soup, ahhhh! That was the most amazing soup I have ever tasted. Beautiful prepared and extra delicious when you dip the bread in it!  I also ordered the steak, which was not good, but I will not let that effect my rating nor should it stop you from trying it. I am more of an appetizer girl, and I do believe that more love goes into the apps then the entrees.   The whole wait staff was perfect and so polite. This place was definitely a treat!

Pretty unbelievable accolade, in my opinion--how do you account for so many restaurants of such varying cuisine?   As skeptical as I was, Frances immediately won me over. Having been there several times now, I can safely say that it is an outstanding restaurant. Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets, Beet Salad, Bavette Steak, Duck Breast...everything I have had was well-prepared. The ambiance was great and the wait staff have consistently been friendly and helpful.   Perhaps the kicker is their house blended wine served in a lab beaker--sold by the ounce at a great price, this is a Michelin-starred restaurant that will not break the bank when adding wine to the meal.",

    "review_text": "Making a reservation months in advance because you've heard so much about a restaurant has its drawbacks, but the reality is my whole experience here came down to bread...of all things.  This was the second reservation we had with Frances, as I had the flu when our first reservation came around and we had to cancel. So, having waited, literally, about a year to eat here, we were excited!  Started with the Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets and the Duck Liver Mousse. Weren't blown away by the beignets, but the mousse was amazing! Loved every bite of it, so creamy and tasty. Then we moved on to the Spring Garlic Soup, minus the calamari (not a big fan and my husband is allergic). This was another hit for me.  And this is where the problem started. The timing between appetizers and entrees was pretty long, considering. We noticed the table next to us ask for bread and get a couple of pieces each within seconds...so we thought, what the heck and asked for bread also. About five minutes later we were told that they had to make some more bread so it was going to be awhile. So, thinking the entrees were probably on their way, we canceled the bread. Another ten minutes went by and we were just sitting there with empty glasses, no bread, and no entree. The waiter chose this moment to try to make amends by telling me that he was really sorry, they just didn't have enough bread at the time we asked...which is pretty lame, sorry, considering how long some people wait to eat here. Do you really want a 6 month wait to end with an apology for not enough bread being made?  My entree was the Grilled Bavette Steak, which wasn't even memorable, and I don't think it's because of the bread...it was pretty and cooked well, but it was just like a bridesmaid's dress. Served its purpose, but maybe it wasn't meant to be the star.  If I did ever eat here again, I'd come for the appetizers and go somewhere else for the entree. Oh, and if you think \u00a0you might want bread during the meal you want might to let them know when they confirm your reservation.",

And they usually come up with something random or just plain stupid, like a life-sized teddy bear? Or a heart shaped box of Russel Stover candies?  Not mine, he planned ahead. At least a few weeks in advance, 'cause reservations at Frances are hard to get most of the time, let alone the Saturday before Valentine's Day. Five stars to him, but you can't review people on Yelp, so Frances reaps the benefits.   Totally understand why it's a tough seat to nab. It's quaint, intimate and the food is quite memorable. When we arrived around 9:30 pm, this places was hoppin'. Most restaurants are winding down about that time, but Frances was still getting her groove on. Rather than lurk in the very small bar area, we walked around the Castro for 10-15 minutes and came back for our 10 pm reservation. They sat us right away and drinks were in order.   If you are a wino like moi, definitely go with their house varietal. Not only is it good, but they charge you by the ounce. It's brought out in a marked beaker with a wine glass and you can self-serve as much as you like. You only pay for what you drink. What a deal! OR if you're more of a cocktail connoisseur, definitely go with their lavender champagne concoction.   For a light bite (or bouches as Frances calls them), we split the calamari, Panisse frites and bacon beignets. Food came out hot and the servings were much larger than expected. I particularly like the frites, as they were a cute little play on fish sticks. Sophisticated fish sticks, of course. And the bacon beignets were out of this world. If you order anything at this restaurant, go with the beignets!  Main dishes are exquisite, both the steak and the duck. Just the right amount of meat with a rich, velvety sauce on top. Because I was so full from the dishes above, plus the fact that it was 10:30 pm (go ahead, call me a weenie), I was starting to fade fast and couldn't finish everything on the plate. Oh, but I wanted to! Just... Couldn't... Eat... Everything... So... Tired. Pretty sure my 10 oz. of red wine didn't help, either.  That didn't mean that we skipped dessert. It was our Valentine's dinner, duh! We split the lumberjack cake, which came with some Humphrey Slocombe ice cream on the side. My +1 is a big fan of this date-flavored anything, so this was mostly for him. But since I didn't finish my meal and was only able to pick at the cake, it was totally OK.  We left Frances stuffed and completely satisfied. And exhausted! As soon as we got home, headed straight for some SNL in bed. In my world, that's a pretty freakin' fantastic way to end a romantic meal. Wouldn't have had it any other way.  Well done.",

    "review_text": "This restaurant is Heavily overrated, although quite nice on a few of the dishes and some finer details. I came to SF to hit a number of great restaurants and my date and I both agreed that it was not even near one of the best. (If you are wondering, our favs were Flour + Water, Bar Tartine, and SPQR)   First, the Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets are very, very good. Airy and flavorful, with a very smart dipping sauce composed of creme fraiche and a touch of maple syrup. The Winter Kale Salad was also nice but Very overdressed and was also overpowered by the Gouda mixed in. The Monterey Black Cod seems to be a star dish here, although pretty staid in its preparation and presentation.   Another star dish, the Risotto Nero was amazingly bland, with over salted hunks of crab and a pretty tasteless (although VERY nicely textured) risotto.   The only two dishes we found to be outstanding were an Onion Soup with delicate parmesan crackers and the Lumberjack Cake dessert. The ice cream that accompanied this cake was definitely the best part and, unfortunately, our waiter informed us that it was Humphrey Slocombe ice cream and not made in house. Slocombe is definitely the best ice cream I had in SF (it beat bi-rite by a mile) but this just seemed like cheating for the price involved.  Our waiter was a bit strange. Whenever he would come to our table he would rest his hand on my back which at first I didn't mind but kind of creeped me out by the third time it happened. My date also saw him treat some guests hoping to come in for a walk-in meal a bit rudely. Of course this a very popular restaurant but that doesn't make such behavior ok.  Anyway, I could care less about the service. I am just here to say that this place is talked about as one of the top restaurants in SF and it was just kind of mediocre. Good old Zuni Cafe definitely provided us with a better meal and, if you really want new, trendy American fare try 1760. It was way better and way more relaxed.",

The restaurant is hidden in a residential street and seats about 30 people max. It's very cute and intimate.  Upon arrival, we were seated promptly! The waitress made some suggestions on the menu and we opted for 2 starter bites, 2 entrees and a side.  1. Bacon Biegnets - delicious but a little salty! I did like this dipped with the Chickpeas Fritter sauce since that was a bit sweet. It was a good combo. I probably wouldn't get this again and I'd want to try something else 2. Chickpeas Fritters- AMAZING. I highly recommend this. It's soft on the inside but crispy on the outside. The dipping sauce is the die for. 3. McFarland Springs Trout - Roasted Cauliflower, Fregola Sarda, Almond Gremolata- I got this as my main dish. The fish was absolutely splendid. The skin was light and crispy while the fish itself was flaky and soft. I loved the cauliflower&amp;sarda mix as it complemented the fish perfectly. I highly recommend this dish so get it before it's gone!! 4. Five-Dot Ranch Bavette Steak - Baby Spinach, Farro Verde, Trumpet Mushroom Conf\u00eet- My boyfriend got this one and it was tasty as well. The meat was tender and juicy but packed with flavor.  5. Melted Leek and White Cornmeal Spoonbread, Pink Lady Apple Butter, Parmesan- YES, A MUST GET. The bread melts in your mouth and I literally couldn't stop making \"MMMMMMM\" sounds as I ate it.  I love this place and I couldn't stop raving it about it to all my friends. Please go! and please let me know if you liked it! :)",

Every time I come here I make a reservation for the next visit, usually about a month off, because before, during and after the meal all evidence points to its status for me as the best restaurant in San Francisco.  The host and waiters seem the most legitimately friendly and happy with their jobs of any restaurant staff I have ever met. They exude the energy of a start-up that knows that it has the secret sauce for success.   Firstly, you must have the \"market shot\"- a concoction of whatever fresh fruit was available at the market that day and a light, sweet alcohol. So far I've had market shots with fresh plum and brandy, fresh apple and soju, and peach with some sort of liquer. No matter how the ingredients sound on the menu, they are delicious, interesting, and fresh.   The carafe of the house red is always excellent wine, and the price is so reasonable that the wine serves as a perfect complement to the meal, without you needing to give a second thought to the volume. You are charged by the ounce, so really you can drink exactly as much or little as you want.  Coming with 4 or 6 people (the max) is my favorite because you can try every item on the menu. The salads are always fresh and delicious, with the quality of ingredients so high that the simplest sounding dish is exceptional. The bacon beignets with maple creme fraiche are always a favorite, but I sometimes find them to be too heavy (esp. if there are only two people to finish it). There is often a mushroom pasta dish, which is slightly different by season, but always exceptional. The mains and sides are always delicious - small enough that it's reasonable for one person to have at least one starter and a main and a side.   Frances strikes the perfect balance of excellent, yet not overly complicated food, made exceptional by genuinely great service, all for a price that is so reasonable within the SF scene that there is no question about why it is so hard to get a reservation here.",

The place is charming but a little on the small side. Let's stop the small talk, we were amazed with the food! Most of the dishes were delicious. The 3 of us got: - 2 bouch\u00e9es - 1 appetizer - 2 entrees - 1 side - 2 desserts  We ended up full but happy. With 1 glass of wine, the total bill was $50 per person (including tax and tip).

    "review_text": "I lost a Super Bowl bet to my lady. This is the place where she chose to collect her win. Frances is one of the hottest new restaurants in SF and getting a reservation there is difficult unless you plan a couple months in advance. So when I checked OpenTable last week and one of the coveted Saturday night reservations popped up, I immediately booked it without hesitation.  Parking can be very difficult and we had to circle around many blocks until we found one near the fringes of the Mission district several blocks away. Fortunately, we made our 5:15 reservation with our quick, power walking strides.   As people have mentioned before, it's a small, intimate space. Tables are close together so if you don't want people to glance at your food or the occasional interaction with your neighbor, this spot may not be the place for you. Luckily, we had our choice of two-tops and the end one was available so we snatched it up.  The Food: House wine: We got their house blend red wine that comes in a tall flask with equidistant hashmarks. They charge $1/oz and each hashmark represents 2 oz. Nothing too spectacular about it. A bit too astringent for my taste too.  Bread: From Acme Bread, you get a choice of the heel or middle piece. Solid country bread. Just wish it was warm.  Bouchees ($6.50 each): We ordered the famed Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets and Panisse Frites. Throughly enjoyed the beignets with bits of smoky bacon in them. A little more dense than I thought they'd be but I'd still gladly have a dozen more, especially with that mildly sweet Maple Creme Fraiche &amp; Chive dipping sauce to dunk them in. The Panisse Frites are basically chickpea fries but so fragile and delicate. Loved the crispy exterior with the ethereal, pillowy interior. Served with a Calabrese Chili Aioli dipping sauce, it's a definite winner.  Entrees: I ordered the Five Dot Ranch Bavette Steak w/ Toasted Farro Ragout, Maitake Mushrooms, and Baby Fava Greens ($25). The steak was soft in texture yet it still required a few extra chewing strokes to break it down. It also needed a few gentle sprinkles of salt and pepper to elevate it. I loved the earthiness of the farro and mushrooms. My lady had the Caramelized Atlantic Scallops, w/ Sunchoke Puree, Roasted Fennel, and Farga Olives ($26). I think you're only supposed to get 3 scallops but somehow a fourth one landed on her plate. I caught a quick couple bites and the scallops were meltingly good. I enjoyed the floral fennel pieces and the silky smooth puree.   Dessert: 7x7 says we have to try this before we die so we decided to share the popular \"Lumberjack\" cake ($7). It came out with a scoop of Humphry Slocombe Maple-Walnut Ice Cream. It was a wonderful dessert when combined together. A scoop of the ice cream with the cake interlaced with apples. It all worked. The only drawback I would say is I wish it came out warm.  Our server was pleasant and very enjoyable. One minus would be that he took the order of the couple next to us first when we had sat down at our table way before they had. We even asked him if we could get a couple copies of the menu and have Chef Perello sign them for us. He said sure and asked us what our names were. As I was signing the check, we got our personalized copies of the menu. Thank you Chef Perello. You have a clear winner of a restaurant that will be successful for years to come.  Overall: 4.5 stars",

But it was worth it. The kale salad and chicken wing special were both great apps. We all shared our plates, so I got to try a bit of everything - the steak, black cod and duck were each unique and delicious. The stout chocolate cake was decadent and delicious. Another member of our party ordered coffee when we ordered dessert and it came long after the cake was already gone which seemed a bit flawed to me, but I was content with everything I ordered.",

He told me he had to book reservations far in advance so I'd recommend that to anyone interested.   We had the bacon beignets... tasty! The white corn soup.. so so good!!! and the warm spinach salad... mmm! I got the chicken which was quite good, and I'd order again, but still not my favorite chicken in SF.  They might have gotten only a 4-star review from me, but they redeemed themselves: When ordering, the server told us they were out of the Lamb dish, which my boyfriend had been eyeing as a meat lover, so he went ahead and ordered the veggie crepe crespelles, which as lovely as tasty as they were, were still not meat. So imagine our surprise when shortly after we received our food but the two surrounding tables were delivered the \"lamb\" entree (and they had ordered after us)... our faces fell! When the host came over to see how we were doing, I explained our disappointment... and in a few minutes he brought us out a small plate and explained that the kitchen had been in transition to steak for the dish after running out of lamb. So we got some meat after all!!! Happy Day! and it was tasty!  We finished off with the buttermilk panna cotta which was delightful. I'd definitely love a return visit :)",

    "review_text": "Hands down my favorite meal of the year. Hell, it's probably one of the best meals that I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Let me walk you through it...  First off, even with three weeks notice we were only able to snag a 10pm reservation for a Saturday night. As most of my friends can confirm, if I don't eat by 7pm I get quite cranky. So 10 is definitely pushing it...but after hearing nothing but glowing reports I decided to suck it up, have a late afternoon snack and pretend I was European for one night.  We ordered the following:  Bacon Beignets - bacony yet light. Fried yet not a grease bomb. These were even better than the sound.  Panisse Frites - aka chickpea fritters. These might be better than the beignets and when I say something veggie is better than something bacony, well, you know they must be good.  Grilled calamari - nice chunks of perfectly cooked calamari. Again, a very light dish that packed a ton of flavor.  Ricotta gnochhi - little pillows of heaven! Quite possibly the best gnocchi that I've ever had (and I'm quite the gnocchi whore)  Sonoma duck breast - duck is something that I would never order as my entree but I really enjoyed the version at Frances. I think I even had two bites instead of my usual one!  Caramelized Atlantic scallops - I keep using the word perfect in this review but that sums up pretty much everything we ordered: the scallops were perfectly cooked, crispy on one side yet cooked through without being rubbery.   Baby turnips w/ bacon - nothing says spring like root vegetables paired with pork!  Frances is one of the hottest tables in the city right now, and for good reason. Service was fantastic and the food sublime - this is the perfect date restaurant! In the past I've often struggled when people ask me about my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. Now I can say without hesitation: Frances.",

Our friendly and sweet server, Melissa, was a little excited that it was our first time dining. \u00a0We started with a bottle of Santa Giustina wine, Barbera/Croatina, and the signature bacon beignets. \u00a0Both were a great start to an amazing evening. \u00a0We both ordered the Bavette steak and it came out on top of seasoned farro, and it was very tender and flavorful. \u00a0And for dessert, I had the lumberjack cake and the partner had the chocolate stout cake. \u00a0Both were delicious, but we did like the chocolate one more. \u00a0It reminded me of chocolate souffle. \u00a0We also ordered two espressos and it was a great way to end the meal.

    "review_text": "I felt like we won the lottery the other night when we walked into Frances and waited only 20 minutes for the opportunity to sit at the bar, albeit, squeezed quite close to the other lovely guests to the left and right of us.   While the menu changes regularly here, it SO helped to have a good sense of what I did and didn't like from my last time here. \u00a0As a result, I was able to stay away from offerings that were just ok last time - i.e., the persimmon salad, and bacon beignets - and ordered new and better items on the menu. \u00a0Here's what we had this time, in order of when it arrived:   * Domaine La Butte - Cab Franc (\"Le Pied De La Butte,\" Bourgeil, France). \u00a0We asked for something pretty dry, yet fruit forward and light. \u00a0Our server gave us a taste of this, and we were sold immediately. \u00a0The fruit and tannins of a younger cab, but the lightness of a slightly heavy pinot, this was easy to drink and worked well with most of what we ordered. Note: later in the meal, we also ordered a glass of white wine to go with the fish, but forgot the name of the bottle it came from. \u00a0We asked for dry, full-bodied, and fruit forward. \u00a0But, got something that was probably more fruitier (i.e. sweeter) than we were looking for. \u00a0  * Panisse Frites - chick pea fritters, calabrese chili, and black olive aoli. \u00a0One of the favorites for the evening. \u00a0Delicately crispy coating and velvety smooth inside. \u00a0How do they get the chick peas to do that?! Seasoned just right, the subtle black olive aoli was the perfect compliment. \u00a0I didn't quite get the chili flavor, but it was all good either way.  * Baked cherry stone clams. \u00a0Just as fantastic as before. \u00a0It's amazing how consistent these were to what I remember from my last trip here. \u00a0(Pls check my original review below for more info).   * Wheat flour crepe crespelles - robiola, winter greens, wild mushrooms. Not my favorite for the evening, but it was still very, very good. \u00a0The crepes were rolled like a spring roll. \u00a0The stuffing almost had a texture of spanakopita filling. \u00a0The crepe was just a tad too soggy for my taste, but the small mound of wild mushrooms and greens were perfect with it!  * Red snapper - chanterelle mushrooms, roasted sunchokes, meyer lemon gremolata. I almost creamed my pants after having the first bite of this. \u00a0It was the highlight of the gastrofest for me. \u00a0Nicely seared on the outside, but tender inside. \u00a0I really enjoyed the chanterelles and roasted sunchokes. The gremolata was out of this world - delicate, but boldly presented the nice flavors of the fish without it being \"fishy.\" \u00a0  * Roasted brussels sprouts - chestnuts and bacon lardons. \u00a0You'll never look at brussels sprouts the same way again. \u00a0Just a little caramelized on the outside and smoky from the lardons. \u00a0The chestnuts complemented the nuttiness of the brussels sprouts very well. \u00a0Next time we may order more of this side dish and soup to make to make it a meal in and of itself! \u00a0  * Ridgecut Griss Mills Golden Polenta - black trumpet mushroom ragout. \u00a0With the texture and look of cottage cheese mixed with finely chopped greens, this was my least favorite dish of the evening. But, the black trumpet mushrooms really redeemed it for me. \u00a0But, don't take my word for it. \u00a0My friend loved it.  * Lumberjack cake - pink lady apple, medjool dates, maple-walnut ice cream. \u00a0Having the visual appeal of a fiber muffin, I was hesitant about this dessert when it arrived. \u00a0But, I was blown away when I tasted it. \u00a0A little crispy outside, but moist, yet substantive inside. \u00a0Big flavors from the dates, but tempered by the apples, and not too sweet. \u00a0The maple-walnut ice cream, while not bold on the walnut flavor (or the maple for that matter), still worked well.  * Pink lady apple galette - rum raisin ice cream. \u00a0This should really be called \"Rum Raisin Ice Cream with Apple Galette\" because The Humphry Slocombe rum raisin ice cream was probably the highlight of this dessert. \u00a0You can really taste the rum and the raisin here. \u00a0It was wonderful. \u00a0The galette was made well, but nothing too special. \u00a0The apples on the galette might have been a little over-cooked as it was kind of mushy. \u00a0The pastry was really flaky and buttery, but got kind of soggy from the apples.  A splurge given our unplanned excursion here at $94/person, but quite reasonable given all we ordered and how pleased we were with the whole experience at the end of the night. \u00a0Solid 4.5 stars!",

    "review_text": "Warm and cozy, welcoming staff, and delicious food. My wife and I went for our bi-monthly \"nice dinner\", and left very satisfied.  The restaurant itself is in a small space on a charming street in what Google Maps calls \"Dolores Heights\" (neighborhood namers rejoice!) and has a nice, homey feel. The sewn coasters and simple walnut tables are classy and not the least bit overdone. The maitre d' is effusively charming and welcoming, and from the start you feel like you're going to be well taken care of.  My wife started with the daily shot, which was a delicious spicy/sweet/boozy version of grapefruit juice. I had the house wine, for which you pay by the ounce, but which is served in an 18-oz bottle (yikes!). Both the house white and the house red were quite good, and a budget alternative to some of the other wines by the glass.  For appetizers we had the broccoli and the crab risotto, both of which were delicious. The risotto included salsify, which I was expecting to be more flavorful, but was pretty bland, and I wish had been crab instead. :)  For her entree, my wife had the crespelles (the vegetarian option), and I had the duck breast with a side order of the endive gratin. I can't resist a good gratin, and this one was a nice fatty accompaniment to the fairly lean duck. My wife loved the crespelles.  For dessert we shared a healthy slice of lumberjack cake and a glass of alcoholic apple cider from Vermont. The cake is delicious and perfectly baked, and went beautifully with the cider.  Frances is not cheap, and it's tempting to get one of everything. The space is also a little overly loud, but it was a real treat, and a nice night out.",

We just tried to enjoy the wonderful food and ignore the terrible, border-line rude waiter we had to deal with. We'll be back, but I will request a different server. We saw the manager there, and thought it would have been a nice touch for her to stop by tables and see if they were happy with everything. I always think it's a nice touch when restaurant managers do that. That happened to us at Rich Table, and we thought that was so classy. It solidified the relationship; motivates us to come back.

No wait, the wine helped with that (pay as you go by the ounce - clever girl, F).  Squid ink tagliatelle had a rich, umami flavor that's hard to explain because I'd never tasted anything like it before. The idea of eating it reminded me of the first time you drink kombucha - smells weird, looks weird, tastes kind of weird, your logic tells you it's a bad idea...but then you start to like it because of its weirdness aaand then it's gone and you're sad.  Halibut with salmon chowder: didn't know how the fish on fish concept would pan out, because these two fish in particular have such different flavors. Skepticism soon ate its own feelings. It was cooked really well and the salmon essence added some good depth to the broth.  There was also cornbread with bacon butter. It was a mental and physical challenge to not continue slathering this butter onto the cornbread, partially because it was a little dry, but mostly because butter and bacon combined are probably two of the best reasons to willingly clog your arteries.  So, yes to Frances. Check it out and eat it up.",

See no. 1  And I probably write a review for 1 out of every 7 establishments that I visit - not because I'm picky, but because See no. 2. \u00a0  With that said, my experience at Frances was so dope that I felt compelled to write about it asap. \u00a0To say that I am enamored by this place is an understatement. \u00a0Their menu is simple. \u00a0 1 piece of papel. \u00a0No forehead crinkle or massaging of the temples from the absurd amount of choices you have to eliminate before the final decision. \u00a0If you were dining w/a party of 4, you could each order 1 of the main entrees, try a piece of each and say that you've had everything at Frances and call it a day. \u00a0  bouchees: Panisse Frites - $6.50  French Toast Stick lookin Chickpea fritters w/a crispy outershell, smooth and creamy inside, and served with a chili and black olive aioli dip. \u00a0If deep fried is yo steez, this is your order.  Applewood Smoke Bacon Beignets - $6.50 Not too doughy, just enough bacon, right amount of crunch - but would be naked w/out the Maple Chive Creme Fraiche.  We skipped appetizers. \u00a0But it didn't stop the kitchen from bringing us 2 delicious appetizers (Winter Citrus Salad $10 &amp; Dungeness Crab Risotto $13) with the comment: \"We know you didn't order these, but humor us anyway. \u00a0On the house.\"  Oh Frances, I could humor you all nite if that's how you roll in this relationship.  Now 4 dishes deep, we still had our main entrees coming. \u00a0My friend ordered the California Halibut, $28, and I had the Duck Breast $27. \u00a0Both savory and served at a temperature that proved it was fresh off the coals. \u00a0The Halibut was firm and slightly sweet, and the Duck was rich and complete w/some crispy charred skin.  At this point I was wishing I had worn my Mervyn's sweats to Frances. \u00a0(See my review for a better explanation of the sweats here: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/arizmendi-bakery-san-francisco-2#hrid:KgrRvWzuUiRozQb74ZhdpQ\">yelp.com/biz/arizmendi-b\u2026</a> ) \u00a0But the nite was not over yet. \u00a0My favorite part of the meal was left: \u00a0Dessert.   Lumberjack Cake - $8 Served warm, it had a Christmasy feel to it: appley-spicey-gingerbready and moist. \u00a0Accompanied by it's less muted pairing - maple-walnut ice cream. \u00a0My friend liked the ice cream, but I could've went without.  Chocolate Almond 'Clafoutis' - $8.50 \u00a0Oh my god. Fck the nonsense I would come back here just for this cake alone. \u00a0A warm chocolate cake w/carmelized banana in the middle, burnt caramel poured on top, more carmelized bananas on the side and salted caramel ice cream. \u00a0Fckin-A I swear. \u00a0Killin me thinkin about it.  Sht, this is turning into one of them long ass reviews. \u00a0I hate that. \u00a0But one more thing. \u00a0Their house wine. \u00a0Served in 18oz pitchers, you pay for what you pour at $1 an ounce. \u00a0We had their red and finished the whole pitcher.  Seems in some reviews service was a hit or miss - but my experience here was definitely on point. \u00a0The staff were more than attentive and helpful. \u00a0Overall Frances is well deserving of their Michelin star. \u00a0I will be back w/my Mervyn's sweats.",

Rosemary &amp; lavender almonds (complimentary) Nice rosemary and olive oil flavor, but possibly could have been served in a better vessel; they were on the bottom of a small bowl, so they looked like left overs since the bowl was not even half full. \u00a0  Panisse frites $6.50 I've had better at Fleur de Lys. \u00a0The chickpea fries were too large, and I could taste the oil. \u00a0The lemon aioli it was served with was too creamy and made the bite one note, regarding both flavor and texture.  Roasted beet salad $6.50  Excellent. \u00a0Everything complimented each other in the salad. \u00a0  Wild mushroom crepe cannelloni $19 The porcini mushrooms in sauce on top of the cannelloni was very tasty. \u00a0However, the crepe cannelloni lacked something texturally since the filling was a soft white bean puree. \u00a0A contrast in texture would have done wonders for the dish. \u00a0Also, the flavor of the crepe was off and can best be described as a whole wheat crepe.

Definitely had high expectations for this place, given the hype on how cute the restaurant was, confirmed obviously by the ultra cool barn-house-red typefont on the website. We got there at 9 and it was packed. Seats at the bar were not an option at this point so, instead of breathing heavily down people's necks, J and I had our third meal (in life) sitting across the table from each other.  First impression: Pretty cool wine menu. Uncharismatic service: patronizing in a non-patron-friendly kind of way.   We decided to get 12 ounces of the white and red house wines (white was pretty drinkable and red wasn't) and also the Paul Hobbs malbec because it was cheap and good. Menu had a bunch of good wines by the glass.  We ended up getting: Squid ink tagliatelle (4 stars - great flavor, pasta cooked really well but could have been more al dente) Chestnut soup (4.5 stars - really rich and buttery) Bavette steak (4 stars - solid, exactly what I expected) Duck breast (4 stars - solid, exactly what I expected)  Overall, pretty good food, but nothing blew me out of the water. Probably better craft and technique than most restaurants I've been to in SF so far, but the food just needs a bit more character to justify its \"waiting list\" rights and the waiters just need to act a bit more like they want to be there.  Wouldn't come back for the food, would to come by for drinks by the bar (but probably will be too packed).",

I started with the bacon beignets (a mouthful of heaven), the charred spring onion dip (delicious), mid course was the squid ink tagliatelle and creamy spinach soup (high recommend both), and finished with the salmon and ricotta gnocchi (pretty rich together, but tasty).  I usually NEVER order dessert but I could resist getting the dark chocolate pudding which I ended up renaming \"pot de sex\". I think that explains how good it was....  The best part of this place is that they offer a house white and red for $1/ounce. So essentially they give you a 20oz carafe and only charge you for what you drink....and its well made wine!

When Frances has some time to reflect she'll probably grow as an individual and become a lovely mature lass.   A subtler approach to coaxing out the flavors of the wonderful fresh ingredients that are used rather than relying so heavily on salt would be appreciated. This was the case with all of the dishes we tried - with the possible exception of the wonderful warm calamari salad. You never had calamari so tender!   And I am a lover of the salt and a veteran of many a Michelin starred meal (in case I have not hammered it into your head in previous reviews, I used to be something of a big deal).   There's a lot to like about Frances....the prices are very reasonable, it is a welcome addition to the pathetic dining scene in the Castro and will hopefully elevate said scene.

    "review_text": "I had really high hopes for Frances. I've walked past this place three or four times before, always stepping in during prime dinner times to try and snag a seat only to be told there's a one hour wait. But Lady Luck was on my side when I stopped in last night -- no wait!   I ordered the roasted duck breast with cipollini, persimmon, chestnut puree, and jus. Duck is one of those things I love and I think is fairly easy to cook. And while Frances definitely sources their duck from a good vendor, their kitchen is clumsy with the preparation. My piece of duck was too fatty and rare, both undertrimmed and undercooked. My teeth got such a workout from chewing that I had lockjaw upon leaving the restaurant. The vegetables were under roasted as well. For $30, is it so much to ask for tender vegetables?!?!  On the plus side, it was a tremendously generous portion of meat and the skin was nicely seasoned and just a tad crispy. The browning reactions on the meat provided intense ducky flavor that I enjoyed. A glass of red paired well with the beautifully plated entree.  But for the price, I was hoping for a lot better.",

Also ordered the steak and snapper.  I will say that both dishes were well prepared (beef taken med. rare)... great fish/meat combo and it was awesome.

    "review_text": "As I revisit Frances for the 2nd time, with even more difficult reservations to get, and a semi different menu from last time, I think at this point, I can say that I don't think I'll ever be disappointed by Frances. \u00a0The menu hasn't changed too radically, but it does have its occasional seasonal reflection, but the quality and taste remains the same. \u00a0For a place that may find itself a bit confused in identity between a casual meal spot vs a high end dining establishment, I'd think that that in itself is what defines it perfectly. \u00a0You can go in without expecting a pretentious setting and enjoy quality food and service with a friendly smile and ambiance. \u00a0Frances may very well be a gem that this city needs more of. \u00a0And don't ever expand, for I fear that it will change you completely.  As mentioned before, reservations are difficult, but its worth it doing so early in time such as landing a 7:30pm for 3. \u00a0MONEY!  Wine is always pleasantly priced per amount drank, so I find it somewhat dangerous. \u00a0As for the food, there were some mildly pleasant ones which were overshadowed by unexpected spectacular dishes. \u00a0Gotta love tapas style. \u00a0From the menu:  Bouchies -Panisse Frites - so nicely crisp and delicate, these chick peas break if you apply too much pressure, but it goes so nicely. \u00a0 -Baked Cherrystone Clams - nicely seasoned and minced and mixed with some other fresh and tasty ingredients -Smoke Bacon Beignets - all time favorite, can't NOT order these of course.  Appetizers -2x White Corn Soup with crab and Padron &amp; Shishito Peppers, and Creme Fraiche - always love their soup -Sugnole Pasta - my absolute favorite because the pasta is so unique and it absorbs the sauce so well. \u00a0With braised lamb, fava beans and greens, and mushrooms, it all blends perfectly  Entrees -King Salmon - bleh....skip. \u00a0 -Beef - as a usual favorite, its cooked nicely medium rare and sits on a bed of polenta, which is always a perfect combo for me.  Sides -Spring Onion and Asparagus Gratin - so light and yet so heavy, but tastes awesome.",

    "review_text": "Maybe it was the person I was with, the bittersweet calmness of a sunday evening, the heartwarming wine, the ambiance of the dimly lit restaurant filled with lively conversations, or all of the above, but I had an absolutely delightful time at Frances last night.   Our server David was phenomenal -- he gave great recommendations, checked in frequently but not disruptively, and timed every dish so we aren't rushed to finish the plate on the table. Loved the guy and he definitely made the dining experience very special :)   NOW ON TO THE FOOD.  My oh my, every single dish arrived with so much complexity in flavor. We opted to maximize variety, so we decided to share one entree and order a bunch of bouchees and apps.   1. Applewood smoked bacon beignets - Delicious but definitely wasn't the star of the meal. I get the hype -- it's fried dough with bacon, come on. It was comforting, the freme fraiche was sweet, which complemented the savory beignets well.    2. Roasted early girl tomato tart - this was a special that wasn't on the menu. The tart's crust was perfectly flaky, buttery, and sweet. It was well balanced with the savory roasted tomatoes and the tarragon creme fraiche tied everything together (I put the creme fraiche on the bacon beignets -- great idea)   3. Treviso radicchio and fris\u00e9e salad - Every other table was getting the little gem salad - it was the safer choice: lettuce, tomatoes, summer squash.. I'm sure it was delicious. BUT. I'm SO glad David recommended this salad. It probably my favorite dish of the night. The bitterness of radicchio paird so well with fresh, sweet figs, and the bacon pieces added so much fullness to the salad. The fried shallots were fun and kept making my fork come back for more.   4. Stuffed tolenas farm quail - I never, EVER order quail. But I'm glad I listened to David and ordered it. Whatever it was stuffed with, it made the quail moist and flavorful. Chanterelle mushrooms, potatoes, shallots were okay. The purslane (which I almost confused for watercress, excuse my lack of greens knowledge!) added the perfect amount of bitterness and freshness. But the star of the dish for me was.... the freaking padron puree!!! Who would've thought pureeing padron peppers would produce such light, deliciously spicy, flavorful, and airy sauce? Oh my goodness, it was the best thing on that plate and David graciously brought us a small ramekin filled with extra sauce. I literally dipped everything in the sauce and had to resist really hard not to drink it. I couldn't believe it had nothing but padron peppers -- beautiful ingredients shine with simplicity! Ahh.. it was dreamy.  5. White corn spoonbread - This side dish was a star dish on its own. This was soooo delicious. It was as if corn bread and bread pudding had amazing sex and had a beautiful little baby. Yea, I would eat that baby. It was soft and moist in the middle, perfectly seasoned, and so wonderfully comforting, especially when paired alongside the quail. Yum.   6. Toasted coconut pavlova - I had planned on ordering the lumberjack cake, per every yelp review's recommendation. But I had to go with David's recommendation, because his recommendation had been so on point the whole night. This dessert was a little too sweet for my liking, but I appreciated the variety of components (including the birthday candle for me :D). The lime curd was my favorite part -- I kind of wished it was ice cream to balance the warmth. The caramel was also very good, as were the caramelized bananas. I thought all of the components were amazing separately, but all of them put together, it was overwhelmingly sweet.   Being super greedy, we asked for Josey Baker bread -- with salted butter, it was a great palette resetter in between bouchees, whether that's a thing or not :P The house red wine was wonderful and kept me happy and warm throughout the meal!   So there ya have it. It was an outstanding experience (hell, 3 hour long experience!) and I CANNOT wait to go back!",

    "review_text": "Guys, I am sorry. After reading the reviews on yelp was super excited to try this place, but I have to say we left really disappointed. The pros: the pay for what you drink house wine is a great innovation, and we started our meal with the market shot which was really tasty, as others have mentioned.  However, it was pretty much downhill from there. We ordered the chickpea fritters and bacon beignets to start after reading rave reviews. The beignets were ok but extremely filling, i cant believe that anyone is complaining about the portions being too small (for a $7 small plate). The chickpea dish is not something that I would want to eat again. Both of these dishes were quite heavy, especially for appetizers - if fried food is your thing then go for it, but if not do yourself a favor and stick with one of the salads. The chicken wings on special were decent, but by that point we had trouble eating anything else that was fried.  The gnocchi, which have been talked up quite a bit here, were extremely soft, bordering on mushy. Between two of us, we didn't even finish half of these. For the main course, I ordered the steak, medium rare. It came out way on the rare side. No lie, I had to chew each bite for at least a minute. If you must order the steak, get it cooked at least medium if you don't want to spend half your meal chewing. Some of the desserts sounded good, but by that point we were ready to go and decided to skip it.  Honestly, I was pretty surprised at the level of mediocrity given the high ratings on yelp. The only reason I am giving 3 stars instead of 2 is that I am taking partial blame for ordering so many fried appetizers instead of a salad. The ambiance is nice, the service was decent and I really liked the graphic identity / menu design - I definitely wanted to like this place, but the food we had was subpar across the board. At this price point (and given a Michelin star?) I expect much better execution. I don't understand what's up with most of these reviews - are people seriously waiting months to get a reservation for this place?",

The food was executed excellently. I had the grilled bavette steak, and it was amazingly tender and juicy. Probably the most tender flank steak that has ever touched my tongue.  The chickpea fritters were also interesting and tasty. It was basically as if agedashi tofu and hummus had a lovechild. They were a lot heavier than I expected though.  I'm a big fan of elotes, so I had to try their grilled corn. The chipotle butter was delicious and is something I'm inspired to try to implement in my homemade elotes.  But in spite of their well executed food, I can't give Frances a ringing endorsement. I felt like it lacked a little \"pizazz\" and the flavors weren't totally inspiring. As a \"Top Chef\" judge might say... \"I think they played it safe.\"  If I could give this place, 3.5 stars I would.",

The applewood smoked bacon semi bite size beignets really hit the note as it's savory sweet that was totally different from anywhere else I have tried.  The salad was refreshing that was a good introduction to the main course. The Carnaroli risotto was good rich and round taste.  Both the halibut and salmon were very solid good though I am not very certain if they're out of the world inventive.  Chocolate 'Clafoutis' with caramelized banana, burnt caramel and salted caramel ice cream from Humphry Slocombe was quite delicious for its very velvet chocolate taste.  Lumberjack cake with maple walnut ice cream was a classic hit and  was also quite good.  The wine by the glass selection was okay and covered the basics. They do have a book of wines by the bottle so it's good if you come in a group of 4 who love to drink and eat.  The Four Barrel coffee was in a fantastic big jar and definitely quickly kept me up and wired awake.

Lucky for me, I found a table for two on OpenTable a couple days before the event! Of course I snagged it right away since finding a reservation for Frances back then was super difficult.  Drinks: Market shot ($3) Frances white wine ($1 per ounce) Frances red wine ($1 per ounce)  The Market shot was super fresh with just a hint of booze. Not really my type of drink, but I wanted to try it. Their house red and white were a great value as you get a bottle with ounce markers and are only charged for what you drink. And the quality was pretty good for a house wine at $1 per ounce.  Food: Baked cherrystone clams ($7) Squid ink tagliatelle ($13) Applewood smoked bacon beignets ($7) Creamy spinach soup ($12) Salad of spring greens ($12) Sonoma duck breast ($27) Five-dot bavette steak ($27)  Yes, two people ordered all this food! I really enjoyed the clams, soup and our entrees. The clams were a nice size and I do love my shellfish. The soup was delicious! Nice and creamy with great spinach flavor. The entrees were cooked perfectly. I love my meat and these dishes didn't disappoint. The roommate liked the bacon beignets since he's the bread eater. And who doesn't love bacon?!

We ordered the the beignets (amazing), steak (just ok, nothing special or unique about it), salmon (good well cooked and mixed well with creamed corn), squid ink pasta (amazing) and kale salad (very good). Desserts were decent but a bit bland.  Its moderately priced which helps, but I have a policy of not returning to any business which charges any \"tax\", surcharge or other fee claiming they are to cover the health care costs in SF. Frances charges $1.50 per person (so $3.00 for two of us) which was over 3% of the total bill. I believe that everyone should get health care coverage, but ultimately its very unlikely this surcharge gets to the waiters as more often than not its turned into profit for the owners.  You are running a business, to pay for health care just raise prices instead of hiding a sneaky surcharge (no mention of what it is for btw) on the bottom of the back of the menu. When you go to buy groceries they dont slap on extra fees for the pay and health care of their workers, why should restaurants?",

I reserved ages in advance, the first day that I could, for my husband's birthday dinner. This is a Michelin rated restaurant, so I expected to be pretty impressed and for the wait to worth it.  We were seated, offered flat or sparkling water, menus. Ordered a combination of bouchees, apps, entrees, and skipped dessert.   Everything seemed to be ok, like just ok, not memorable, not amazing nor horrible. The baked clams were way too salty, could not eat them consecutively. It was a crowded evening, and the food took a while to come, to the point that hubby didn't want to order dessert just because of the wait. It was also extremely loud, so it's hard to wait and wait and not have an intimate or comfortable conversation. Seating is tight and you can pretty much rub elbows with anyone at the next table, not to mention eavesdrop on their entire conversation. They gave us a couple of mini chocolate cookies as a token birthday wish, but these cookies were hard and fairly flavorless. Portions are quite small in general.   All in all, not worth the hype, there are better places with more interesting food that you can go to without planning a month or two ahead. Sorry Frances, I am on a budget and this budget does not have room for \"a-ok\" after \"praise Jesus\" expectations.

    "review_text": "I've been a long-time fan of Frances since it first opened. \u00a0Never got around to writing up a review because I didn't think I could do it justice! \u00a0 I just had yet another awesome meal there so I'm determined to record it. \u00a0  What I love about Frances is that everything is always delicious and creative, without feeling pretentious. \u00a0This also means that it's the kind of \"comfort food\" (I mean this in the best way possible) that you can go back to eat over and over again. \u00a0It's kind of like having your mom who happens to be a 2-3 Michelin star chef prepare awesome home-cooked food. \u00a0  This time I went with my sister and her husband, and we ended up sharing a few dishes. \u00a0As usual, I ordered the house wine, which is always really good, eminently drinkable, and you pay by the ounce! \u00a0How cool is that. \u00a0 This particular one blends zinfandel with grenache and something else. \u00a0We really enjoyed it. \u00a0  Grilled beet salad - delicious, refreshing, with nice texture from the pistachio, and the burrata is so creamy   Smoked bacon beignets - the maple chive creme fraiche is delicious, and the smoky flavor of the beignets is fantastic  Duck liver mousse with grilled ciabatta - YUM. \u00a0So tasty, and in nice contrast with the vinegared cippolini onions, sea salt, and a garlic puree. \u00a0Probably our 2nd favorite dish. \u00a0  The squid ink linguine was the perfect al dente texture, with a really rich seafood taste from the cortez bottarga (tuna). \u00a0Probably our favorite dish.   Baby red russian kale salad - also delicious. \u00a0The roasted carrots were so sweet they tasted like sweet potato, and the pecorino smoothed out the slightly bitter taste of the kale. \u00a0The medjool date gave it a nice surprise in the mouth too.   Bavette steak - the black chanterelle mushrooms were super rich and flavorful, and the steak was perfectly cooked. \u00a0  Grilled chicories side - with toasted hazelnuts and cider vinaigrette - had this warm bitter taste to it. \u00a0I'm not really that familiar with chicories but it was really good. \u00a0  In the end, I would literally rate every one of these an A, which is so unusual at most restaurants. \u00a0  We had a delicious meal, and I always love the vibe. \u00a0Our reservation was at 5:15 and it was hopping by 5:30. \u00a0For a restaurant to be open nearly 4 years (?) and to still be this popular, you know it's amazing!",

'Lumberjack' Cake, comprised of Kumquat, Persimmon, Medjool Date, Humphry Slocombe Maple Ice Cream...tasted like a denser version of carrot cake...paired with a mound of maple flavored ice cream, this this is the BIZ! loved it...and will probably try to come here just for their coffee and dessert next time!!!",

    "review_text": "11 weeks, 72 days, 576 hours, 34.5K minutes OR 2.07M seconds...however, you count it, that is HOW long it took to get reservations at Frances. However, I can say without a doubt, it was well worth the wait.  Last night on 7.11.10, my friends and I arrived a little early for our 8:30 PM reservations. As we waited for our table, we excitedly looked over the menu  FOOD/DRINKS: *Strawberry Fizz ($10): Yum; just like a spiked slurpee. The Vergano Americano, an aromatized wine infused w/ quinine bark had a slight herby orangey flavor. The fresh lusciously sweet strawberry juice help balance the slight bitterness from the quinine. The bubbly soda added a slight nose tingle and the chipped ice added a refreshing crisp to the cocktail.   *Bacon Beignets ($6.50): Yum; like fried pillows of Heaven! The beignets were fried to a light crisp and the interior was soft and fluffy. The bits of bacon added a nice smoky pork richness. The maple and chive cream fraiche was the perfect complement as it added a slight of creamy savory sweetness to the beignets.  *Panisse Frites ($6.50): Delish; the chickpeas frites were light and crisp on the outside and smooth and creamy in the inside. The texture was most similar to a creamy polenta. The lemon aioli added a delectable savory tang.  *Grilled Calamari ($6.50): It was good; the calamari was grilled to a prefect tenderness and the char marks added a hint of smokiness. I'm not a fan of olives, however the olive flavor added a nice saltiness as opposed to a strong pungent flavor.   *Dungeness Crab Salad ($13): It was ok; the rich butter lettuce was nestled alongside fresh, tender, and sweet chunks of crab, however, the herb vinaigrette was too overpowering and acidic which masked the flavor of the crab.  *White Corn Soup ($9): Decadent; the white corn soup was savory, sweet, and creamy. The tomatoes stewed in the soup and added a burst of tang as you bite into which helped offset the richness of the soup. My only gripe is that it was too salty for my taste.  *Lucky Dog Ranch Bavette Steak w/ Summer Squash and Baked Ricotta ($25): MmMm, the steak cooked medium rare was tender, buttery, and well seasoned. The baked ricotta added a soft, creamy richness and a ever so light sweetness to the beef. The squash was perfectly cooked, tender, yet w/ a bite to it. The salsa verde tied the dish together as it added a fresh tangy sweetness to balance the richness of the dish.  *Bittersweet Chocolate Pot Du Cr\u00e8me ($7.50): A must order for choco-holics. The slightly sweet chocolate cr\u00e8me was soft, velvety smooth, and melted like a fine truffle. The bing cherries added a sweet tang, while the cr\u00e8me fraiche added an another layer of milky tart creaminess.  *Almond Crostata w/ Nectarines and Thyme Ice Cream ($7): Yum! If you like different flavor and texture combos, this is the perfect dessert for you. The almond crostata had a perfectly crisp buttery crust and was filled w/ sweet and slightly tart nectarines. The almond topping was crunchy, nutty, and buttery. The ice cream was creamy, sweet and savory. Although thyme can be very strong, the thyme flavor was very subtle and added just a hint of earthy flavor.  SERVICE: STELLAR! The staff at Frances is genuinely warm and inviting, non-pretentious, and attentive.   Our waiter Kosta was very knowledgeable w/ the menu and welcomed any questions we had. All our dishes were brought out in a timely fashion; 10 minutes wait for our app, and the other dishes came in 5-7 minute increments thereafter. If we needed anything, the staff was within reach and readily available.   AMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: Modern and simplistic; crisp ivory walls accented by a wine bottle and glass wall, dark brown furnishings w/ cute plushy buttoned pillows for back support. \u00a0Frances is small and intimate w/ seating for less than 30 in the dining area and for about 6-8 people at the counter.   PARKING: Street parking which can be difficult w/o luck.  From start to finish, our meal at Frances was like a perfectly orchestrated symphony. Chef Melissa Perello (former Executive Chef at Fifth Floor) does an excellent job pairing seasonal ingredients that marry well with one another in terms of texture and flavor profiles. Moreover, the service is unmatched. If you're a foodie, Frances should definitely be on the TOP of your list.   As Julie Child said, \"Life itself is binge.\" So why not live a little and indulge in what Frances has to offer...",

    "review_text": "Fantastic meal! One of the best I've had in San Francisco, by far. This is completely consistent with what I've heard about this place from friends so I might ask myself why it took me so long to get here? Then I remind myself, that getting a reservation here at a reasonable time is no easy task. I had booked my dinner reservation for the night I dined 2 months in advance. So if you want to come here, and avoid the early planning, either plan for a very early or late dinner or brush out all your reservation magic tricks that I just don't know.  Stepping into Frances, the much to do over reservations makes sense. It's a tiny, vibrant little space, that was absolutely packed on a Thursday night. I really liked the feel and although the tables were so close together that getting out from the inside seat took some tricky maneuvering and getting to know your neighbor, I wasn't distracted by this at all during my meal.   The food was all excellent. I wouldn't recommend the spring onion gratin, not because it was bad, just because it wasn't as amazing as everything else I tried (crepes, snapper, panesse frites) and I'd rather gamble with something else on the menu that sounded delicious.   I was extremely impressed by the pay-as-you go table win (a bargain a $1 and ounce!). They bring out a carafe marked in two ounce increments and you pay for whatever you finish. It's a dangerous game but does (hypothetically) give you complete control over how much you drink. That is if control and drink as you will carafe of wine can really be put together in the same sentence.   I would totally eat at Frances every week if I could! Sadly I'll have to put in my reservation to try to come again in two months. It was, however, absolutely worth the wait!",

Love it!) Duck breast on fennel, fig, and kale - oh so very delectable Bavette steak with chanterelles on a lemon risotto - delish Cornmeal Fritter with berries and lemon ice cream - like a light cornmeal funnel cake, great! Lumberjack cake with maple ice cream - a little on the sweet side (sweet like a date or fig), but cozy and tasty. \u00a0(They also gave us this dessert which we didn't order and an extra carafe of wine on the house. \u00a0I LOVE THIS PLACE.)  The service was a fantastic, our fellow diners were wonderful, the food was outstanding and the decor is ideal. \u00a0If I were to open a restaurant, I'd want it to be exactly like this. \u00a0My only complaint was that our food came out rather slow. \u00a0However, they gave us tagliatelle, a carafe of wine, and an extra dessert all on the house, so any complaint that I might have had, was completely nullified. \u00a0  GO HERE NOW.",

Completely inappropriate and unacceptable performance   I'm writing this in hopes that changes are made. \u00a0I care about the success and quality of businesses in my neighborhood. \u00a0I'm glad Frances is here and only hope for their continued success.

I think the 2 standout items of the meal were the daily fruit shot (fresh cocktail of fruits from the farmers market with a concoction of alcohol). What a deal. The second standout was the chocolate mousse with cherries. I could swim in it. And the wine mixed by the owner is quite delicious and very affordable.  The entrees and appetizers didn't stand out to me. Bacon Beignets were ok, I prefer the regular beignets that were lighter and fluffier at Hard Knox.

Frances comes with none of the pretension of such places and has the feel of a comfortable neighborhood restaurant.   In fact, Frances seems to have gone out of their way to rewrite the rules of fine dining. Their Pinot Noir by the glass was a Freeman 2007 a bottle which typically retails for $40, but they had it on the menu at $56. What restaurant only marks up their wine by 40%?   The grilled squid, crab salad, and lamb entree were all strong.

Any restaurant that can garner one Michelin star within one year of opening and a bevy of \"best new restaurant in the US\" awards has to live up to the hype, right?   Well, my experience at Frances was, sadly, disappointing. The only redeeming things about Frances for me were the appetizer and salad. The applewood smoked bacon beignets and maple creme fraiche were fabulous. I love dessert food turned savory. And the little gem salad was, quite possibly, one of the best salads I've ever had. Surprising, because it was undeniably simple, yet executed so well.   But the rest of the meal was forgettable and underwhelming. I had duck breast over white fava beans and red cabbage. It was rustic and hearty, but nothing remarkable. \u00a0My bf had the halibut over mashed potatoes. \u00a0It was an odd pairing and also lacked any WOW factor.  Finally, my last gripe: the seating. I understand that housing in San Francisco is crowded, but does dining have to be as well?! Michelin ratings are given on the food alone, but wow, can the tables here be any closer together? We were fortunate enough to be seated on the end of a dining row and even then, we felt crowded. Tables have to be moved to allow for other diners to be seated/to leave, and I find that really disruptive to the dining experience. I could hear the next table's whispered conversation, without eavesdropping. We were that close.",

It's a pain to get a reservation here (60 days in advance), they warn you they will charge you $25 per person if you cancel less than 48 hours in advance and then you arrive and everything has very basic presentation and flavors. Their hyped bacon beignets barely had a bacon taste and just tasted like overly oily balls of dough. The pardon peppers with dipping sauce were average - the sauce was quite watery and fell rather flat on the palette. The quail was very juicy and flavorful but there was nothing particularly exciting about the flavors. The steak was a complete disappointment. While cooked to the right temperature, it is just a few slivers of sliced beef. The corn spoon bread was just a mess. I'm not sure what happened - a lot of the stellar reviews are from the past.

The B made reservations, so our corner table was ready when we arrived. I had the market shot - apple, lillet, and something else. Refreshing, but didn't have a kick at all. B had the house wine by the ounce. Pretty awesome.  So glad we didn't get any apps at Fat Angel before this meal. We decided to get a bunch of small plates to share, an entree, and two desserts. It was a special birthday after all ; )  I know they are bouchees for a reason, but I wish they were bigger. YUM. We started off with the Panisse Frites: Crisp chickpea fritters topped with Smoked Eggplant and capers. This really stood out to me. Crispy outside, ridiculously smooth and creamy chickpea on the inside with the eggplant puree sauce on top. Perfection.  A very fresh, Grilled Beet Salad: Beluga Lentils, Salsa Verde Coriander, Feta. Also very delicious. I love a good non-canned beet.. :P  Creamy Potato and Fennel Soup: Braised Celery, Crisp Leeks and Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche - creamy deliciousness - you could taste the celery in it. So good. I refrained from licking the bowl.  Linguine \u00e1 la Marini\u00e8re: Tomales Bay Mussels, Smoked Tomato Broth, Fennel, Meyer Lemon - Tasty, but not amazing. Tomato + Mussel is delish.  Grilled Bavette Steak: Roasted Potato and Eggplant, Mission Olive, Green Harissa - Steak was perfect MR. A little chewy, not seasoned, but the eggplant was heavily seasoned, so it paired well.   Melted Leek and White Cornmeal Spoonbread, Rome Beauty Apple Butter - The only thing that didn't do much for me. It was good, but not stand out. Denser version of cornbread.  Desserts: The B really like the Pedro Ximenez &amp; Praline Pudding - Preserved Black Mission Fig, Walnut Shortbread -- It was a little heavy for my taste, but good. He does have a thing for figs. My favorite was the Autumn Fruit with some sort of Ice cream/ Tart thing. Couldn't find it on the menu, but there were sliced persimmons. What a treat! I left incredibly stuffed and ready to pass out. That's a successful meal.",

    "review_text": "Given all the hype and the 2 months wait it took us to get reservations, I had high expectations for this place and really wanted to give it 5 stars. \u00a0Definitely a great restaurant - decor was fresh and pleasing to the eyes, staff was super friendly, prices are reasonable, but some of the food lacked the excitement I was looking for. \u00a0Still an excellent + well thought out meal, but it just missed the WOW factor I was expecting to find.  Without a doubt, the service was SUPERB! \u00a0I love how their entire wait staff helps and serves every table, I appreciate how collaboratively well they work with one another. \u00a0We didn't have to wait for our designated server to come clear our plates or bring us new utensils, each time we were done with something, some one was right there to pick it up. \u00a0Our water was never empty since our server was constantly coming by to fill it for us, event though the bottle was right there on our table! \u00a0  Hubby and I shared the following: *Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets - Would have been perfect if there were more bacon bits. \u00a0The bacon to batter ratio was slightly off.  *Panisse Frites - \u00a0Nothing too special, but I really enjoyed the lemon &amp; black olive aioli that came with the dish  *Chicken Liver Mousse - OMG, this dish alone made my night! \u00a0Normally, a dish like this would be too rich for me, but I couldn't get enough of it. \u00a0I ate up all the toast it came with and started spreading the mousse on my ACME bread...delish! \u00a0Definitely a great opener!  *Trottoloni Pasta - Hubby ate most of it since it was a bit too creamy for me after the mousse, but I really enjoyed the thin slices of asparagus it came with, great component to balance out the dish.  *Organic Chicken w/ Semonlina Gnocchi - I was bummed they weren't serving duck on their menu, but this was a great alternative to complete the poultry part of the menu. \u00a0So glad we pick this dish! \u00a0I'm normally not a chicken person (unless it's fried), but this was one of the moistest chicken I have ever tasted! \u00a0Perfectly cooked and full of flavors, it went really well with the gnocchi and spring vegetables.  *Chocolate &amp; Ricotta Mousse w/ Chocolate Sea Salt Cookies - The cookies were rich and buttery, but the mousse was a bit too thick. \u00a0I usually don't mind ricotta, but it overpowered the chocolate a little too much on this dessert. \u00a0The cherries added a great touch though, perfect compliment since they just came in season.  Wished I had room to squeeze in the scallops too, but my tummy was way too full.  Overall, a very enjoyable meal. \u00a0I can't say I'll be coming back here right away, but I'll definitely be back, probably a different season when they change things up on their menu again.",

Only the maple creme fraiche, and the cheesey crouton base to the beef, were sort of decent, and each of those was just an add on to a dish.   Solid 3-star food. But at these prices?!  Service is friendly but the tables are so close together you need to contort your body each time they bring something to the table. That gets annoying the fifth or seventh time. Acoustics are surprisingly good considering the table density - that's the one thing they did really well.  I don't understand the hype at all. I don't mean that in some food-snob way. On a basic \"did you love the food?\" level, I see no reason to return. Not even if it cost half as much as it does. In this city, there are so, so many better choices.",

    "review_text": "Shared a bday meal with J at Frances.  AMBIANCE: Cute. \u00a0Space is small and homey. \u00a0If you are lucky enough to have snagged a reservation, way to go you. \u00a0You'll have plenty of space along the wall opposite from the bar/kitchen area; looked super comfy too with all the cushy pillows and stuff. \u00a0If you weren't able to make a res, no worries, there's seating set aside to accommodate walk-ins. \u00a0Beware though, the raised bar area you'll be relegated to is EXTREMELY tight... so make friendsies with your dining neighbors, cuz you'll definitely be all up in each others' personal spaces. \u00a0J and I showed up around 5:15pm on a Sunday (they open at 5pm) and had the good fortune of being able to select our bar seats. \u00a0We chose to sit right in front of the window, which meant we didn't have to fight for space.  SERVICE: Casual and understated, letting the quality speak for itself-- just the way I like it.   FOOD: Everything was delicious, but nothing was mindblowing. - Market shot ($3): It was essentially essence of cantaloupe in liquid form-- sweet, ripe, clean. \u00a0Portion was quite generous for $3 too. - Bacon beignets ($7): A little too doughy for my tastes. \u00a0Portion was also smaller than I expected (you get 5 balls). - Panisse frittes ($7): Again, smaller portion than expected based on the price. \u00a0I really enjoyed these though; each blocky chickpea fry had a perfectly crispy shell encasing a creamy interior. \u00a0Each blissful bite was grease-free and a lovely marriage between contrasting textures. \u00a0The accompanying eggplant caponata was a nice touch. \u00a0 - Albacore tuna confit ($13): A pleasant surprise. \u00a0Large chunks of fork-tender tuna scattered throughout a nice mix of butter lettuce and delicious heirloom-y tomatoes. \u00a0 - Grilled Tolenas farm quail ($26): I think there were 6 birds in that dish. \u00a0Each and every one was cooked to perfection-- tender, succulent and oh so savory. \u00a0Best preparation of quail I've ever had. \u00a0I wanted to lift up the bowl and slurp down all the broth... mm. - Chocolate almond 'calfoutis' ($9): Good, but SUPER INTENSE flavors. \u00a0A dessert meant to be shared... for me, with at least 2 other people. \u00a0It was difficult to finish this dessert, and I ended up having to box about half of it to go. - Toasted white corn poundcake ($8): A great way to end the meal. \u00a0The poundcake was essentially glorified cornbread, but paired with that delectable sweet corn ice cream, bits of crunchy caramel popcorn, and roasted nectarines... MMM.  OVERALL: If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be back again and again. \u00a0Frances impressed me with their lowkey attitude and high quality offerings... all for a very affordable price (above meal for 2 including wine, etc cost just over $100, including tax+tip). \u00a0I'd love to go back and try more of the menu.",

    "review_text": "Wow, what a fantastic meal! Perfect for my small birthday dinner with a few close friends.  ~~SERVICE~~ Our server was incredibly friendly. He was always there when we needed him &amp; just super nice.  ~~AMBIANCE~~ Frances has a great ambiance - you feel like you're in a good friend's living room. It's comfortable yet classy in a casual way. And it's small so your meal just has an intimate feel. I love these random bright red chairs - there's a couple of them around the dining room.   Only downside is how hard it is to get reservations! I only got this by going on OpenTable at midnight 60 days before I wanted to eat there.  ~~COST~~ 3 bouchees + 2 entrees + 1 side + 2 desserts = a great meal for four. Cost was $39 a person (including tax/tip).  ~~MUST-HAVES~~ Duck breast, butter bean cassoulet, if not just about everything else I ordered! (minus the beets &amp; ricotta gnocchi)  ~~BOUCHEES~~ * Panisse frites - 4.5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frances-san-francisco?select=OzhMS6qehf8kVtZfW5I-aw#ROtzb9cv2_afAnCRRha8hA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fran\u2026</a> cross-section: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frances-san-francisco?select=OzhMS6qehf8kVtZfW5I-aw#Asez1BkkUUY8nDvteioydA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fran\u2026</a> (chickpea fritters, green garlic 'goddess,', meyer lemon. $7) You get a slice of lemon to drip over the fritters yourself. And man those fritters.. they have a perfectly even &amp; crisped breading. The texture inside is incredibly soft &amp; homogeneous - we weren't sure how the restaurant was physically able to get the chickpea to be this pureed without it turning into a watery mush. The dip was really great too.  * Applewood smoked bacon beignets - 4 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frances-san-francisco?select=OzhMS6qehf8kVtZfW5I-aw#xP77wkk2nudKmoESCKQ8sQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fran\u2026</a> cross-section: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frances-san-francisco?select=OzhMS6qehf8kVtZfW5I-aw#SU_nQgMox4OhHopbsm-fKg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fran\u2026</a> (maple chive creme fraiche. $7) The beignets have an awesome texture - they are soft &amp; have a slight crisp. The bacon was more like small pieces of ham, which gave the beignets a salty hint but wasn't quite the fatty pork belly that I was expecting. The dip provided a nice contrast to the beignet's flavors.  * Grilled beets - 3.5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frances-san-francisco?select=OzhMS6qehf8kVtZfW5I-aw#OzhMS6qehf8kVtZfW5I-aw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fran\u2026</a> (yogurt, preserved lemon, brokaw avocado &amp; kumquat. $7) My least favorite dish of the night, though my friends all loved this. You MUST have a kumquat with each bite - it really adds that kick of flavor for an otherwise pretty bland dish. The yogurt was warm which I didn't like - if there was a contrast of a cool yogurt, this would have tasted much better to me.  ~~ENTREES~~ * Sonoma duck breast - 5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frances-san-francisco?select=OzhMS6qehf8kVtZfW5I-aw#zlE7ZoSr_PMXSH9v3yPQ8w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fran\u2026</a> (poppy apricot, spring onion, lacinato kale. $27) Oh my god the meat was so amazing. The edges have a tiny bit of a harder texture, &amp; the middle is so juicy &amp; tender. The sauce was amazing, &amp; the apricots gave it a wonderful kick of tart/sweet flavor. The kale added a slightly bitter taste &amp; added really well to everything else.  * Iacopi butter bean 'cassoulet' - 5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frances-san-francisco?select=OzhMS6qehf8kVtZfW5I-aw#xBaBQ2iaXcmU0i6T24VDRQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fran\u2026</a> (Pt. reyes mozzarella, ancho chili, smokey pangrattato. $18) Wow, amazing, especially for a veggie dish! The beans were perfectly textured, soft but not mushy. The smoky pangrattato was basically these amazingly crispy bread crumbs. The flavors were all just wonderful &amp; everyone loved this dish.  ~~SIDES~~ * Ricotta gnocchi - 3.5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frances-san-francisco?select=OzhMS6qehf8kVtZfW5I-aw#85boP013Gu0gDaaeBB4AcQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fran\u2026</a> (rapini pesto, toasted walnut) This is definitely different from your average gnocchi. They look like marshmallows &amp; actually are kind of that way in texture too, being lighter/fluffier. They come apart more easily than potato gnocchi under your fork &amp; rather than being chewy, they are like a dense ricotta cheese (to state the obvious..). While it's unique, this was not necessarily the best spin on gnocchi &amp; none of us really loved this dish.  ~~DESSERT~~ * 'Lumberjack' Cake - 4.5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frances-san-francisco?select=9VOyJGBA__4qgcc-9dWm0Q#MeCQ4ZdSwHRaLlDxQUXi2A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fran\u2026</a> (Aztec fuji apple, kumquat, medjool date, maple ice cream. $8) The cake had an amazing dense &amp; moist texture. The ice cream was super sweet &amp; also creamy/heavy. There was also this much harder &amp; sweeter crust under the ice cream. Altogether delicious!  * Dark chocolate pudding - 4.5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frances-san-francisco?select=9VOyJGBA__4qgcc-9dWm0Q#9VOyJGBA__4qgcc-9dWm0Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fran\u2026</a> (puff pastry twists, creme fraiche. $8) The twists were crunchy yet maintained a good texture that didn't crumble too easily or was too dry. The chocolate pudding had a dark chocolate taste &amp; was intense, &amp; the creme fraiche a nice subtle sweet.",

Frances fulfilled all my expectations and the brilliance coming from the kitchen is amazing.   The menu is not fussy or overly complex, it simply reflects the shortest distance between farm and table. The chicken liver mousse is a must as are the bacon beignets.   During my last meal here I had the halibut with morel mushroom and English pea ragout with bacon and cipollini onion and the flavors complimented one another so well I was amazed. We also had the grilled asparagus and warm potato salad and they added toasted farro to it and gave it a completely different texture and added depth of flavor without overpowering the asparagus, very impressed with this dish.   The wine list is great, some amazing small production bottles listed, the house Rose is a must.   Yes its hard to get in, with such a small space and a huge following it does make dinning here difficult, but its worth the wait and if you don't mind late night dining then your odds of scoring a table improve big time.

Anyway, it's been a while, but I wanted to add this to my mediocre review from last time.

    "review_text": "I finally made it back to Frances. I snagged a prime time OpenTable reservation 2 months ago and excitedly told the bf I would be sharing with him the delight that is Frances. (FYI, Frances called me two days prior to confirm and texted me again the day of to reconfirm. Don't let them cancel on you!)  Perhaps it was an off night, but it was definitely only a 3 star night. The last time I was here, the food was just right. This time, nothing was that good besides the beignets.  * Smoked maple bacon beignets with maple chive creme fraiche - $7 As delicious as I remembered. Either I made a Freudian slip and said \"beignets\" when I meant \"beets\" (the bf also heard me say \"beets\" though... Freudian slip in hearing?) or the server heard me incorrectly, resulting in an order of beignets landing unexpectedly at our table. In either case, I am grateful for the mistake.  * Grilled beets with chermoula spice, house yogurt, Chantenay carrots - $7 Not a fan. The beets were not quite soft or sweet enough, and they were smothered in too much yogurt.   * Tagliatelle with tomato braised chicken, Sicilian fennel seed, green olives, Nardello peppers - $13 We both agreed that the texture of the tagliatelle was superb. However, we couldn't agree on the sauce. I thought the olives were too sharp for it. The bf thought the sauce would have been \"as boring as vodka sauce\" without it. (Hey! I like vodka sauce!)   * Sonoma duck breast, purslane, roasted figs, fennel agrodolce, spiced jus - $29 The flavor profile of the sauce was fine, but the duck was too chewy.  * Five-Dot bavette steak with Nardello peppers, chimichurri, chanterelles, farro verde - $28 The steak was also too chewy. I found the texture extremely unpleasant, and the bf, who typically orders his steak \"rare rare rare!\" agreed it was slightly too chewy as well. The accompanying farro and vegetables were okay, but I didn't feel like the ingredients went well together. I left half the entree unfinished. (People who know me know that I almost always finish my food.)  I tried the Frances house red ($1/oz), and it tasted oddly like bubble gum to me. The other reds by the glass were mostly in the $15-$17 range, with a single $13 option. I tried a Cabernet Franc / Merlot blend which was good but pricey.",

We had: wine by the ounce (red better than white) bread (great, other than butter was too salty); they didn't charge us beignets (a tad overrated, but good - aioli could be improved) chickpea fries (awesome texture - stat on the aioli) peach and cheese salad - really really yummy, ripe peaches over very fresh cheese WOW Trottolini pasta - so good - awesome texture salmon - WOW - perfectly cooked and the stuff it sat on top of - WOW best polenta in life steak - a little tough, but the sauce was really nice butter beans - almost didn't order them - would have been a major mistake. ORDER THESE. Lumberjack cake - warm, unique, substantial and delicate all at the same time",

    "review_text": "The food here was GREAT. \u00a0Like, if you're looking for a restaurant with some fancy food, I would definitely recommend at least checking Frances out. \u00a0I had the steak, and while it wasn't terribly filling, it WAS delicious, and combined with the appetizers and dessert, it was a very filling meal.  The restaurant itself looks kind of like a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, and it's pretty cramped (the waiter had to move the table to let us into the back seats) and a bit noisy (but just a bit). \u00a0However, that being said, it's still a very nice place with some VERY good food. \u00a0  I would expect to spend at least 30-60$ here, depending on the appetizers and desserts you might get. \u00a0The drinks were pretty good, but the two cocktails that I tried (the Elderflower one and the Sunrise) were a bit too sweet for my taste.  Also, a big note to make here, you probably need a reservation... we were here on a Monday night (granted, it was at 6pm) and the place was packed the entire time we were there.  Overall: A small place that has some amazing food.",

The Appetizers really shined and were more interesting than the entrees. We will try it again.",

And then there's the food. \u00a0Rather than ordering some of the larger entrees, we instead ordered one of every bouchee and appetizer on the menu - which was plenty of food for the two of us and allowed us to try out more things. \u00a0Everything, from the clams to the beignets were delicious. \u00a0The food was not heavily fussed over - instead, the dishes worked because the ingredients were clearly at their peak freshness and carefully chosen to work well together. \u00a0We didn't feel as if we were carrying out a tub of cream in our bellies on the way out.  Frances may very well be my go-to SF restaurant from now on whenever I'm in town. \u00a0Assuming that I'm able to get a reservation, that is.",

    "review_text": "Located in the Castro district of San Francisco, a new Michelin Star restaurant has emerged under the leadership of Chef Perello, a rising chef in the bay area. Unlike many Michelin Star restaurants, Frances is warm, cozy and not the least bit pretentious. So cozy that you could easily eavesdrop on your neighbor's dinner conversation and peep at their entrees; not that I was peeping.   For drinks we decided on the house red wine which they charged $1 per oz. I found the wine to be rather boring and lacking in body. The smoothness factor was also missing while the tannin level was too high for my taste. Contrary to my displeasure in the wine, I drank the whole glass and even poured more from the flask to get my daily dose of antioxidants.  For our bouchees, we shared the applewood smoked bacon beignets and panisse frites. The beignets paired so well with the maple creme fraiche and chive sauce that I couldn't help but triple dip. The panisse frites were made up of chickpeas and dipped in a wonderful Calabrese chili aioli. I would recommend getting one or the other because they fill you up quick and you should never skimp on dessert. Never.  I lucked out because my caramelized Atlantic scallop entree came with 4 scallops instead of the usual 3. The scallop lover inside me was enthused yet conflicted because I thought a Michelin star restaurant such as Frances would be more consistent. But oh well, it was a damn good scallop! Eyes closed and mouth open wide, I savored the slightly charred scallop and its sweet, tender flesh.   Our second stomach was determined to get the lumberjack cake which has received a lot of attention on yelp and even made it onto the 7x7 Big Eat SF list. Checked another one off the list! I would categorize this cake as comfort food hence the name because it was nothing lavish and fairly dense consisting of fruits and nuts. Served with a scoop of Humphry Slocombe's maple walnut ice cream, the lumberjack cake though not aesthetically pleasing; exhibited a beauty of its own. To top off our meal, we each got our own copy of the menu signed by Chef Perello as requested by my boyfriend.  Chef Perello's devotion to local ingredients limiting the distance from the farm to our table, and her expertise of creating original recipes illustrates her commitment to high quality cuisine.  4.5 stars",

    "review_text": "We absolutely loved this place! I couldn't even imagine how delicious the food was! We've been waiting forever to eat here and finally had the chance to do so! Oh my goodness my fellow Yelpers! Let me tell you a little something...  What's better than great food and a highly recommended local SF hotspot? Wonderful service!   So, I heard the restaurant is named after Grammy Frances. You know what? She's probably rolling over in her grave right now as she reads this review. She notices a great review with only ONE star, ZERO if I could make it happen.  Well, Grammy Frances.. I have something to tell you. I don't know who is running your restaurant, but they are just ruining your fine name. Yeah, the food is probably good.. All we had the chance to eat was the bacon bread. Your employees call them beignets, but they're confused. It isn't bad, but I wouldn't write home about it.   The service was terrible, of epic proportions. Melissa treated my partner and I like we were the ugly step children. How did we know this, you might ask? We heard her whole conversation with everyone else. Maybe it was our skin color or choice of partner. I couldn't figure a thing out, except we were treated really poorly. I usually don't waste my time with long reviews and wasted words but...   THEY took my credit card and walked off WITH my card for 6 minutes.   I sure hope they don't try to commit fraud with my credit card. Sure would be a shame for them to try.   I would advise that if you were to complain about anything when you're here, pay cash or hope you have a very good credit card.  Thank goodness for my Chase Sapphire Preferred card, I called them and told them if any suspicious charges arise .. To notify me and do a phone verification.  What a waste of time, right? I'll update you if something happens.   Anyway, I didn't want to waste my time with speaking to anyone but my partner just so happened to run into the 'General Manager Robert' on the way out.  I'm going to wrap it up because this is such a waste of my time.  GM Robert: Oh so sorry you had bad service. Again, sorry you felt that way. Oh sorry you didn't like the way you were treated. Oh sorry you think that. Oh sorry that you're leaving, oh well! Maybe next time if you come, she will treat you better!  Ok first, Grammy Frances.. I am so sorry that this guy is the General Manager of your establishment. It's such a shame that arrogance gets in the way of good ol food. Ma'am, it's just not the same these days. People get high ratings and treat customers like a number. They don't care to address the problems. Instead, they treat anyone that doesn't absolutely love them... Like junk.   You know what my papa used to say to me? He said that if no one ever complained about anything, that means something's wrong. It means that there's a problem and someone's covering it up or brushing it off like it's of no concern. He's a wise man.  Treat customers like you want to be treated and people will love you and always come back.   So Grammy Frances, if I feel like I would never come back after meeting GM Robert and server Melissa.. Isn't that a sign that maybe a change is in order?  TLDR; Melissa is a horrible server. GM Robert is a terrible leader. Instead of offering help, he kept repeating 'Sorry that you felt that way'. If you decide to dine here, make sure that they aren't working that day. Or dear, I hope they will read this and change the way they are. I really do hope they just take it as a learning experience. Also, they took my credit card in the back room for 6 minutes. For what? I don't know? Copy the numbers down? Beware of fraudulent charges! The bacon bread isn't a beignet. More of a piece of bread with bacon bits scattered in. Tons of restaurants that will treat you like they'd treat themselves. Don't waste a single penny here.  I left my phone number on my receipt so they would call me. So far, no calls. Let's see if they give a flying pig about customers.  *EDIT* My friends and relatives actually live on 17th, one block away. They've been coming here since December 2009, when it opened. They haven't been here for awhile but ahh yes now I know why this place has changed. The previous General Manager Patrick Tsui departed Frances for a new adventure when Robert Wright came in to run what Patrick left behind. Patrick left some VERY big shoes to fill as he was there since inception. So, I can see why he's the way he is. Sad, really. I hope Frances could find a better replacement than Robert Wright.",

Four of us were able to get a table on a weekday night. \u00a05:30 is a little early, but when we went in, half of the restaurant was filled already. \u00a0Space is very limited and demand is certainly high, so they cram a bunch of little tables together. So once you are seated, you better not want to take a bathroom break until the meal is over. \u00a0  The decor is beautiful. \u00a0You can see the rather quiet street with trees outside the large windows, and tables and seats are simple and tastefully decorated. \u00a0It's elegant, but definitely not stuffy. \u00a0You don't feel like you have entered a pricey restaurant, but perhaps a good friend who is a professional interior decorator invited you in. \u00a0And by the way, your friend just so happens to be an amazing cook too.   Onto what really matters: the delicious food! \u00a0We couldn't decide on what to order, since we were first-timers and weren't sure about portion sizes. \u00a0And everything on the menu looked so good. \u00a0So we shared the bacon beignets, which were so doughy and delicious like donuts, but definitely not as greasy. \u00a0The grilled calamari is very light but you can still savor the subtle citrus flavors. \u00a0The chickpea fritters were my favorite. \u00a0I can't even describe the taste, but they were really awesome, tasty and not overly fried.   For appetizers, we shared the crab salad which is also light and delicious. \u00a0The chestnut soup which every food critic seems to love is really darn good. \u00a0It's not heavy but you can definitely taste the nice nuttiness. \u00a0  For entrees my friends had the scallops and steak while I opted for something light, the gnocchi, which is actually an appetizer. \u00a0Gnocchi was cheesy and delicious, but probably not as memorable or outstanding like the appetizers we had.  We had no room for dessert after a full meal, unfortunately. \u00a0  The bill was a bit higher than I expected---I guess the little dishes do add up. \u00a0Food plus a bottle of champagne was $166 before tips. \u00a0  I would love to come back, but I am sure reservations will only become harder to get, as I imagine many first-time diners will want to come back again and again like I do.",

    "review_text": "Frances received ONE Michelin star in The Michelin Guide for 2011 so it's worth a visit; however, be prepared for a wait time of about 2 months for a reservation (unless someone cancels). \u00a0They also have unreserved bar seating for walk-ins but the seats are very limited. \u00a0I think I only saw about 6-10 seats so I would recommend that you make a reservation if you really want to eat here.  The restaurant is pretty small (\"L\" shape layout). \u00a0Small bar on the left when you walk in. \u00a0Reserved seats along the wall - making up the long part of the \"L\" shape. \u00a0The servers are attentive. \u00a0Water glass never empty. \u00a0New silverware for each course. \u00a0Dress code is pretty casual - nothing fancy. \u00a0Please note that the tables are pretty close together so you will not have much privacy.  Here are some dishes to consider when you visit this restaurant:  ***What's great*** (1) Grilled Asparagus Salad - Baby Mustard Greens, Aged Balsamic Vinegar, Crisp Shallots  IMPRESSION: WOW, this was surprisingly flavorful. Don't miss out on this salad if you see it on the menu and don't dismiss it just because it is a salad (GET IT).  (2) Caramelized Atlantic Scallops - Sumchoke Puree, Roasted Fennel &amp; Nicoise Olive  IMPRESSION: Yummy in the tummy - every part of this dish was great (too bad you only get three scallops)  ***What's good*** (3) House Wine served in a pitcher with markers  IMPRESSION: pay per ounce is a neat idea so drink up! I tried the red and it was pretty good.  (4) Organic Chicken - Semolina Gnocchi, Trumpet Mushrooms, Spring Vegetable Ragout  IMPRESSION: chicken was soft and tender (not dry at all); veggies could have been more tastier but they weren't bad; gnocchi was scattered around the dish (main focus was the chicken that was nicely sliced into palm-size circles)  (5) Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets - Maple Creme Fraiche &amp; Chive - they are known for this bouchee  IMPRESSION: pretty tasty but bacon lovers may think it lacks significant bacon flavors; the maple creme fraiche &amp; chive was a great complement to the beignets  (6) Panisse Frites - Crispy Chickpea Fritters, Lemon &amp; Block Olive Aioli  IMPRESSION: interesting rectangular cut fritters (you get four of these fritters in every order); be sure to squeeze the lemon on these fritters to enhance the taste when you dip them into the lemon &amp; block olive aioli!  (7) \"Lumberjack\" Cake - Lady Apple, Medjool Dates, Humphry Slocombe Maple-Walnut Ice Cream  IMPRESSION: what a combo of flavors for a cake! \u00a0it was moist with medium density; the maple-walnut ice cream was yummy too.  (8) Sauteed Broccoli di Cicco - \"Wagon Wheel\" Fonduta  IMPRESSION: slightly salty but still pretty good; make sure you dip the broccoli in the sauce that is at the bottom of this bowl.  ***What's just okay*** (9) Chocolate &amp; Ricotta Mousse - Visciole Roasted Burlat Cherries, Pistachio &amp; Creme Fraiche, Chocolate Sea Salt Cookies  IMPRESSION: eh...just okay - nothing too spectacular to write about.  (10) Trottoloni Pasta - Asparagus, Meyer Lemon, Mascarpone &amp; Toasted Walnuts  IMPRESSION: hmm...not much of an impression - seemed like just plain-o-pasta (or perhaps it's because i tried this just after taking a bite of the WONDERFUL Asparagus Salad?)  BTW, the menu varies slightly everyday but I believe the Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets are a staple on the menu.  I'd definitely return for the asparagus salad and the caramelized scallops.",

    "review_text": "It's... good. I can understand its charm, even, and it's eye-popping 4.5 Yelp stars and one Michelin star. It's indeed very San Francisco (for whatever that's worth). But I don't think deserving of its reputation as one of the hottest, most difficult-to-score reservations in town. And it's *absolutely* not worth cramming into the bar area for after a long wait.  I'm not at all trying to be contrarian, as I desperately wanted to love this place and be blown away, especially since I brought a friend from out of town here to try it with. That said, I also didn't go in with the loftiest of expectations, either, having mulled over the scant negative reviews of the restaurant beforehand. But my gripes were both broad and significant:  1. The service  It's stand off-ish, as multiple reviewers have mentioned already. We came on a not-too-busy Sunday night around 7 pm, nevertheless prepared to wait up to 2 hours for seats at the bar. We easily waited 5 full minutes before someone on the staff acknowledged our presence. For a Michelin-starred restaurant that, while certainly not overpriced with entrees in the common $20-$30 range, clearly fancies itself among the best restaurants in SF, such a lapse in service right off the bat is inexcusable. My friend and I went to the Cheesecake Factory the night before and felt more welcomed there.  As for the rest of the table service, it was consistent but underwhelming. For top-flight, attentive service -- where your glass/carafe of water won't remain empty for more than a few minutes before someone notices -- in a similarly casual San Franciscan restaurant, go to Delfina. Moreover, while it should be noted that we were sitting at the bar and not a table, one would expect that with a full menu should come full service. Credit does go to the staff, however, for refilling the delicious Acme sourdough slice by slice without prompting.  2. The entrees  I'll say outright that the starters and appetizers were delicious. The now-famous bacon beignets are perfect, especially with the creme fraiche and roasted almonds with which to alternate bites. We also enjoyed the grapefruit and butter lettuce salad, and to also be completely fair the highly-recommended spugnole pasta with sausage and mushrooms wasn't available when we went. Maybe having this would have changed my lingering perception of the food entirely, a sort of food recall bias.  But the entrees... sigh. My friend had the duck, I had the steak, and we shared a side of brussel sprouts with bacon lard-ons and chestnuts. The sprouts were the most disappointing, allegedly roasted but instead almost caramelized with a resulting smushy, boiled-like texture. More than once my friend and I each mistook a chestnut for a brussel sprout OR for a piece of bacon fat, the consistency and appearance of each being nearly all the same. As for the meats, by the time they arrived I already didn't expect anything remarkable, but they were both rather forgettable. A comparable restaurant with much tastier meats is Chapeau!. And, for my money (and, incidentally, for less money than here) the full range of savory food at the House in North Beach doesn't just surpass the food here: it blows it away.  The redeeming qualities of the dinner were what most reviewers here have otherwise pointed to already: namely, the Lumberjack Cake and the warm, spiced house wine. But it was very disappointing nevertheless that such a well-regarded -- and new -- restaurant with an otherwise non-descript and self-consciously \"simple\" and \"unpretentious\" atmosphere could come across as cold and even the slightest bit above its guests.",

Dessert was pretty amazing. \u00a0We had the almond crostata with honey fire nectarine and ollalieberry/English thyme ice cream from Humphry Slocombe. \u00a0I'm not normally one for herbs in my ice cream, but loved this concoction ($7).  The service was professional, courteous, accommodating, but not overly friendly. \u00a0The Cheesecake Factory this is not. \u00a0If you want to be chatted up by a guy named Buddy with suspenders full of \"flair,\" Frances is not your place.  The entire bill, with a glass of wine for my husband, came to about $150 (tip included.) \u00a0Very reasonable for what we ordered. \u00a0The only issue we had was when we were not served two of the sides we ordered by accident. \u00a0In hindsight, thank God they didn't remember. \u00a0I don't think I could have eaten it all.  Advice for diners going to Frances for the first time? \u00a0  1) \u00a0Ask for the bread. \u00a0They won't bring it unless you ask and it's delicious.  2) Go early. \u00a0If you get a reservation, get it for 5:00 or 6:00. \u00a0If you're like me and want to avoid really obnoxious drunk people with cash to burn, don't go late. \u00a0You will still have great food, but you will be crushed by hipsters with a lack of Emily Post.  3) Order a good glass of wine. \u00a0They have a terrific wine selection.  4) If you don't have a reservation, go early and get a seat at the bar, which does not require one. \u00a0We went on a Thursday night and there was plenty of seating when they opened their doors at five. \u00a0It started getting cramped around six, however.  5) If you have restrictions of any kind, tell the waiter. \u00a0They were very accommodating when I asked for a non-alcoholic beverage, although it was not on the menu. \u00a0I was given a delicious peach-blackberry spritzer for $4.00.  6) Oh, and stay married for a long time. \u00a0If you hold out for a decade, you get to eat here. \u00a0TOTALLY WORTH IT.",

    "review_text": "Frances is a stellar little restaurant on the cusp of the Castro and the Mission. The place is warm and simple, which I love... Last night was my first time eating here and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.  The service was excellent. While our party waited for our table and the last member of our group to arrive, we shared a carafe of the house red wine. The waitress was highly attentive. Immediately as our friend walked through the door, the waitress brought out a fourth wine glass...we didn't even have to ask! Our main waiter was super nice and attentive as well.   The food is absolutely superb...EVERY SINGLE DISH. Our table ordered:  -Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets with Maple Chive Creme Fraiche -Grilled Beet &amp; Apple Salad with Burrata, Dill and Pistachio -Squid Ink Linguini with Green Garlic, Cortez Bottarga, Lemon and Espelette -Five-Dot Bavette Steak with Cipollini Onion, Salsify and Maitake Mushrooms -Sonoma Duck Breast with Fingerling Potato Confit, Escarole, Crimson Grape Mostarda -Risotto 'Nero' with Sauteed Dungeness Crab, Celery Root and Meyer Lemon -Roasted Cauliflower &amp; Romanesco with Smoky Raisin Jam and Toasted Cashews -Warm Chocolate Stout Cake with Cocoa Anise Crumble, Burnt Caramel and Creme Fraiche  The bacon beignets were dreamy...so yummy, and paired with the creme fraiche just took them to another level. I enjoyed the consistency of the beignets, they were nice and donut-like. My favorite part was the essence of pork fat on the beignets (they may or may not have fried them in some sort of pork fat).   The beet salad was excellent...the beets were extremely fresh and the burrata was perfectly made - very creamy and stringy. The pistachios added a nice texture to this bouchee.   The squid ink linguini was great...the perfectly under al-dente linguini was so tasty with the green garlic and the saltiness of the bottarga roe.   The bavette steak...a perfect medium rare and super tender. The maitake mushrooms were earthy and the light sauce paired with the steak had a certain \"umami\" characteristic, which was absolutely delicious.  The duck breast was amazing...the duck was cooked perfectly, super tender, nice fat on the breast. My favorite part of this dish was the grape mostarda...It was flawless with the duck.   The risotto was crabby...in a very good way! The black risotto had perfect consistency and there were very large chunks of crab in the risotto.  The roasted cauliflower was mind-blowing...if I could make cauliflower and romanesco taste like this, I would eat cauliflower and romanesco every single day. The smoky, sweet raisins go so nicely with the texture element of the cashews.   The chocolate cake was very nice...the smell of this cake wafting in the air is so prominent, and it tastes as good as it smells. The cake is nice and rich, paired with the burnt caramel which is extremely intense, but tied together with the creme fraiche makes a well-balanced, delicious dessert. We were all very happy to close a great dinner with this chocolate cake.  I will definitely be coming back to Frances. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes great quality food with superb ingredients, attention to detail and clean flavors. I better make my next reservation now, as it may take a while to get another table!!!",

    "review_text": "Dined here for my birthday. We had a reservation for 2 at 745 and were seated promptly. The space is small and intimate. The tables are quite close together but I love the simplicity of the decor. We started with a glass of wine and beer. We ordered 2 bouches, 1 starter and main each and 1 side dish. The bacon beignets were fluffy and delicious. I was afraid it would be heavily flavored with bacon but was surprised by how the flavors were mild and balanced. The turnip empanadas were actually better than the beignets. The filo dough was perfectly cooked and the creamy filling was generously spiced.  I had the squid ink pasta for starters. The pasta was cooked perfectly, al dente and the meyer lemon sauce went perfectly well with the pasta. I wish the chef had put a bit more sauce in the pasta. I thought it was too dry but still really delicious. My fianc\u00e9 had the puree of lentil soup. It was so creamy and \u00a0delicious and was served with roasted carrots.  The duck is a must. Just try it. The steak was cooked perfectly mid rare and this too was heaven in your mouth. The side of roasted potatoes looked like other roasted potatoes from other restaurants until we noticed the creamy and funky cheese sauce it was placed on. Omg, soo soo good! Finally, we ordered a dessert and went for the chocolate custard hazelnut dessert. This was the only thing I didn't like. It's like one of those desserts you see everywhere and was just mediocre.   Service was ok. We ordered a bottle of wine and we had to refill our glasses a few times. Our server would stop at our table to clear our plates a few times while our glasses were empty and refused to pour the wine for us. I thought that was strange.  Also my pasta came out first and my fianc\u00e9's soup came out 5 minutes later. My pasta got a little cold since I had to wait for his soup.   If we received outstanding service, I would rate Frances 5 stars but unfortunately, service was sub par and dessert was just meh.",

    "review_text": "It seems I'll be in the minority here by saying this place was a bit underwhelming.   After reading rave reviews in both national and local magazines, blogs, etc. we really wanted to get a reservation here. We ended up making one a few months in advance, and even then it was for \u00a0earlier than we would normally eat.   Upon arriving, i was greeted so warmly, and the manager was so nice, I was immediately impressed.   Although neither my husband nor I are huge beignet fans, it felt like one of those dishes that was a must order. I have to say, I liked them, and was impressed by how little grease there was on the paper they were in. We also had the panisse frites, which were a bit disappointing. I did LOVE the sauce that came with them though.  I don't eat fried food that often , so when i do, i want it to be fantastic. These just weren't.  For my entree I had the scallops, and my husband had the steak.   My dish would have been perfection if not for one problem....It was way too salty. The scallops were cooked perfectly,and \u00a0i loved the sunchoke puree and the fennel. The flavors worked really well together. (If not for the oversaltiness.) While 3 scallops does seem a bit ridiculous for the price as many reviewers have mentioned, I kind liked the small portions because then i was able to try more things without feeling overstuffed.   My guy's steak was very bland, while other components of the dish seemed over salted.   I love their method of paying for the wine by the ounce, I only wish there was more of a selection. I liked the concept, and hope to see it in other restaurants.   We shared a dessert, and it found it ok, but nothing special.  Service was good, the waiter was very knowledgeable about the dishes, and fairly attentive.   I was a bit torn between giving this place 3 or 4 stars, but decided to bump it up to a 4.   After waiting so long to eat here, it just wasn't at all what I had hoped for.",

I guess it is all about expectations. It was so hard to get a reservation even a month in advance. And also the price level made me think I would have an extraordinary dinner experience. Well, my partner and I both thought it was a good dinner, but nothing to rave about.  We were there on Sept 26, a Friday night and had \"Spicy Roasted Cauliflower\" (interesting, but had better in some Indian restaurants for much less money and the cauliflower was too raw for me), Chilled Tomato Soup\" (nice, but not very fine in it's overall impression), \"Linguine alle Vongole\" (no, not good), \"Sonoma Duck Breast\" (maybe our favorite, although the meat was a little too raw in parts), and \"Cranberry Bean Cassoulet\" (good, but I think the beans did stick out taste-wise, did not blend with the rest of the ingredients).  The other thing is the cramped space. You cannot get up from your table without moving the whole thing. I know real estate is precious in SF, but I would hope for fine dining we can still sit comfortably. Also the seats are blank wood and my toosh hurt immensely at the end of dinner. I couldn't wait to get going.  On the upside, the food feels healthy, fresh and made with non of the easy pleasers, like lots of salt or cream. So if you have the money, you can't go wrong at Frances. But in my opinion, the experience does not grant the price and hype.",

As can be gathered by nearly all other reviews, the beignets and lumberjack cake are a must try for first timers, though When I return, I'll definitely get the cake, but pass on the beignets.   3 things that still stand out the morning after:  1. Thorough service. I mentioned to our waitress that I don't eat dairy and she literally went down the menu, through each of the 16 items on there, telling us what dairy was in it and how the dish was prepared relative to butter use.  2. The house wine. $1.50 per each ounce you drink. (...carry the one...about $38 if you drink a bottle worth of wine). I just love that they have a proper house wine. I don't know why more restaurants in SF don't do this  3. One particular side dish - grilled summer squash and roasted fennel in a romesco sauce. Mmmmmmmm I wanted to lick the plate.

    "review_text": "READ MY LIPS BEST RESTAURANT IN SF READ MY REVIEW!!!  One of my friends from Los Angeles decided to surprise me on her drive to Washington for Christmas, and make a pit stop in San Francisco. On her previous trip I took her and her husband to Foreign Cinema, which is always a delight, and they loved it. With one day notice I was scrambling to find a reservation somewhere that would top Foreign Cinema... I heard good things about Frances and decided to take a chance and snag the one reservation they had left for the night! I am so thankful that I trusted my gut because this place was SPECTACULAR, and my company LOVED it too!   When booking the reservation, Frances asks for a credit card number, which made me a little hesitant to book the res but it all worked out. Do not fear! Frances has a very small dining room, so every table counts. Frances is nestled off the beaten path in the Castro. The interior is clean with a hint of rustic and about 12 tables plus a small counter area. There is a window from the kitchen to the dining area, and if you were lucky like I was, we sat right in front of it so we can see all the action. Personally I love watching the magic happen in the kitchen.   The service was impeccable! We were seated punctually and they offered to hang my coat. Once my guests arrived I think we ordered almost one of everything on the menu! While the menu has limited options they are ALL SOOO good that it is hard to decide. Here is what we enjoyed:   Wine (They had a really nice selection of wines)   Shame on me, we had two bottles of the same type of and I cannot remember the name of it, but it was a blend, I think french, with a hint of mushroom, oak, and tobacco. I was looking for something close to a Brunello and this is what the waiter recommended. He actually gave me a little tasting between two bottles which I greatly appreciated!   Starters Cauliflower Beignets: Light and fluffy with a hint of the hearty cauliflower   Baked Clams: Rich and creamy these clams even appealed to the non - seafood lovers  Appetizer  Tagliatelle with Dungeness Crab Meat: The Tagliatelle was fresh and cooked perfectly al dente, the crab added a layer of richness and texture to the dish (it was very tender and not chewy), and tossed in a light amount of butter (Definitely would order this again)   Kale Salad: My friend has been on a Kale Salad kick, and she really enjoyed this salad, it had a very citrus forward complimented with a slight bitter taste from the Kale   Main  Black Cod on a Bed of Lentils - Delish!!! \u00a0Two of us ended up ordering this and we devoured it. The Cod was perfectly cooked and the lentils and spice perfectly complimented the fish. Great dish on a cold night!   Steak \u00a0- I don't exactly remember how this was prepared because my friends ordered this, but I had a bite of the steak and it was cooked perfectly medium rare. My friend cleaned her plate and she NEVER does!  Sides  Pumpkin Bread : Mix of Sweet and Savory flavor. This is not overly sweet pumpkin bread a la the pre La Boulange pumpkin bread at SBux, but rather savory with a hint of pumpkin. This too was light and fluffy ... I did not feel like I was eating a dense piece of bread.   Carrots: MUST ORDER!!! Sweet Jesus I did not know carrots could taste so dynamic. These carrots were perfectly saut\u00e9ed with a dusting of cumin or some exotic spice and paired with diced chunks of avocado. I could possibly return to Frances and order these carrots for my appetizer, main, and dessert and leave happy and satisfied!   Dessert:   Ice Cider: This is a hard cider prepared the same way ice wine is made. I felt like I was drinking a glass of freshly picked apples, juiced, and shaken with ice.   Apple Fritters: I only had a small taste of this, but it was a good blend of apple, cinnamon, sugar, butter, and pastry. It was paired with a lemon ice cream which really brought all of the flavors together. I did not think these flavors would compliment each other, but it really worked   Chocolate Stout Cake with Salted Caramel sauce: This is the only thing I ordered all night that I did not get a wow factor from. It was a fairly simple chocolate cake with a salted caramel sauce.   $500 later, my friends and I dined to our hearts content. Great service, wine, food, and company ... what more can a girl ask for! I can't wait to bring my next guests here as I highly recommend this spot for special occasions or just because!",

    "review_text": "Another amazing dinner at Frances.  Patrick was phenomenal in taking care of us when we arrived. They were running just a tad late but he started us off with a couple of Market Shots that Patrick made himself and engaged us in conversations. Slightly sweet and slightly tart, last night's Market Shot was a golden peach, blackberry, pandan citrus shrub, and agave wine.   We were fortunate to sit with Bobi again and his animated personality kept me smiling throughout dinner. In the Ridel wine glasses we poured glass after glass of Frances' house wine, a blend of petite sirah and zinfandel.   Panisse frites with the meyer lemon aioli were as amazing as the last time. I knew I was coming back for these irresistible crispy chickpea fritters. The warm bacon beignets dipped in chive cr\u00e8me fraiche were soft and fluffy with wafts of bacon aroma and subtle flavors. Writing about it makes me really want one for breakfast right now.  The chicken liver mousse with roasted bing cherries, pistachio, fris\u00e9e and grilled levain was our favorite of the night. (Yes, even more than the Panisse Frites!) The roasted bing cherries added just a hint of sweetness to the creamy and velvety chicken liver mousse. Nothing could have made this dish even better than the char flavors of the grilled levain. Eric uttered a satisfying \"that was amazing\" when we thoroughly wiped down the mousse and balsamic reduction with our bread.  The Watson Farm lamb with summer squash an baked ricotta is a lamb lover's dream. Though not a lamb lover, I appreciated the lamb done in three different ways on the dish. Slices of lamb were seared to somewhere between a medium rare and a medium. Braised lamb meat is wrapped in a crepe, slightly dry but went well with the baked ricotta. Next to it was a small piece of tender lamb rib wrapped by a crispy outer layer.   Bittersweet chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me with roasted bing cherries and vino visciole was the creamiest confection. The subtly sweet but strong chocolate flavors pleasantly surprised me. I wish I had order one just for myself.   Finishing it all off with a cup of Blue Bottle coffee served in their own carafe was the perfect way to end this quintessential San Francisco meal where the freshest seasonal ingredients meet the artful craft of a rising star.  And of course, I was clad in a pair of Louboutin again.",

The Food: 1. Five Dot Ranch Bavette Steak was tender with good flavor (4 stars). \u00a0 2. Organic Chicken was moist and perfectly cooked. \u00a0It's essentially a chicken roulade of breast and thigh meats without stuffing cooked sous-vide style (5 stars). 3.

The restaurant is small, sparsely decorated (but with nice lighting), and cozy - perhaps even a little too cozy. \u00a0The tables are very close together and even though it's loud, it's impossible to not listen to the conversations going on at the next table. \u00a0During dinner, we even engaged in conversation with people seated at tables on both sides of us. \u00a0Depending on your mood and conversation, this could be a good thing or a bad thing.  I loved most of the food that we ordered: - Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets - warm, crispy, and moist inside - Roasted Beet Salad - oranges were good, but the beets tasted a little too much like they came out of a can - Roasted Artichoke Soup - creamy and satisfying - Ricotta Gnocchi - good gnocchi, excellent ragout surrounding it - Watson Farm Spring Lamb - excellent  - Organic Chicken - exceptional (the winning dish of the evening) - Tangerine \"Creamsicle\" - lovely combination of sweet and citrus - Buttermilk Panna Cotta - fresh, light, and delicious  Another plus: \u00a0the house wine is sold in a very unique way. \u00a0It's $1 per ounce and the carafes the wine come in have tick marks every 2 ounces so you can keep track of how much you're drinking.  Based on the food and the atmosphere, I'd give Frances 4 to 4.5 stars, but what pushes them to 5 stars in my book is the service. \u00a0All of the servers were friendly and more than accommodating. \u00a0I made a little outcry when my chicken toppled over when the server set it down, so they took it back to the kitchen to have it rearranged for me. \u00a0Later, the sommelier saw us taking pictures and asked us where he could see them and took the time to make conversation with us even though the place was still busy.  One downside I can see to the place: the space is small and they reserve a few seats at the front of the restaurant for walk-ins. \u00a0Because it gets so crowded at the front, they leave the door open for people to spill out onto the sidewalk. \u00a0Even at the back of the restaurant, the noise from the crowd and the cold air bothered me. \u00a0I would have hated to be at a table right up in the thick of the crowd by the open door.  So, don't miss Frances, but make reservations and ask for a table in the back (or bring a sweater!).",

The SO and I were initially planning to eat at Anchor Oyster Bar, but it was an hour wait and we didn't feel like waiting. I knew Frances was in the area so I decided to test our luck and see if we could get a table.   Parking was surprisingly easy. The SO found a spot a block down from the restaurant. When we got to the restaurant, all the tables in the dining area were filled up. However, there will still four seats left at the bar. We were told by the manager (I believe) that the bar serves the full menu and it's quieter than the dining area, which I agree. However, I'm not fond of the seating arrangements. The seats are so close together that you have to get up to allow others to sit/leave.   I wanted to be blown away by Frances after hearing such great things, but sadly I was disappointed. The only two things I liked most was the Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets w/ Maple Creme Fraiche (appetizer) and the Chocolate 'Clafoutis' (dessert). The beignets were delicious and unique. Anything bacon is good though, right?   The entrees were good, but it didn't WOW us. The bf ordered the Five Dot Ranch Bavette Steak. I ordered the Northern Halibut. I liked that the halibut was moist, but other than that, it wasn't spectacular.   Overall, the service was good. Our waiter came back every so often to see how we were doing. Would I come back?

I really like how they use text messaging to let me know that they had a table ready if we wanted to come earlier. \u00a0They also quickly answered my question via text. When we showed up at the restaurant, they welcomed us with big smiles and they took our coats for us. Throughout the evening, they made sure our table was clean and that we got everything that we needed. When the table next to us cleared, they allowed us to spread out so that we had more room, even though it was just me and Loverboy. They comped one of our side dishes because it took forever to come out. \u00a0They called a cab for us at the end of our dinner. Everyone was super nice, friendly and down to earth. \u00a0If I could give them 100 stars for the customer service and food, they truly deserve it and they definitely deserve their Michelin Star.  Drinks: You can't go wrong with the Elderflower Meadow and Jalisco Sunrise. \u00a0Both were refreshing and delicious. They're made with wine since they do not have a full bar. They have a huge wine list but Loverboy and I opted to just pay the corkage fee ($15) because we wanted to pop open this bottle we have been saving for our anniversary. I noticed that they serve Blue Bottle coffee which is one of my favorite coffee brands. \u00a0That's legit!  For starters we ordered: Grilled calamari, Panisse frites (chickpea fritters), Bacon beignets, Baked Clams. I just have to warn you that the servings for the bouchees are really small but I think it's more about quality than quantity. The calamari was so tender and it tasted really fresh. I loved the pickled currants mixed with the calamari. Loverboy was having foodgasms over the baked clams. The bacon beignets were so delicious that they were like an amazing party in your mouth. \u00a0We loved the beignets and clams so much that we ordered extra servings of them. You only get two shells of clams filled with \"amazingness\" so it is definitely easy to inhale that dish. I'm pretty sure the server and food runner thought Loverboy and I were human piggies.  For entrees: Loverboy ordered the Bavette Steak and I ordered the Pan Roasted Duck breast. \u00a0The steak just melts in your mouth and it was perfectly seasoned. \u00a0It goes really well with the gratin side we ordered. The duck was so juicy and I really liked the crispy skin that they left on the breast. I think having the citrus flavors with the duck was a stroke of genius.  The star of the night was our dessert: the chocolate almond clafoutis (it's like a molten lava cake) with banana slices and salted caramel ice cream. The salty-sweet flavor combo was to die for! We wanted to order an extra one but we needed to stop before we eat ourselves to death.  To sum it up, Loverboy and I ate like it was our last meal. We practically cleaned our plates which would make our moms proud. I highly recommend this restaurant and I will definitely will be back for more.",

When we arrived at the restaurant, I handed the wine to the host and he proceeded to remove all of the wine from the box and display it for all to see on the counter. \u00a0Well, the dessert wine was meant as a surprise (there was a note to our server about this) but the cat was out of the bag, so to speak. \u00a0Oh well, at least there was the surprise dessert.  One thing I will say about their wine list is that it is very diverse and you can select a number of affordable bottles or a good selection of wine by the glass. \u00a0If you want to splurge, the expensive bottles are also there for you. \u00a0And definitely the best thing is their house wine which is served in a carafe and you pay for what you drink. \u00a0I haven't seen anything like this since I was last in Paris and I'm surprised more restaurants haven't started doing this. \u00a0Great idea! \u00a0  On to the food.  Applewood smoked bacon beignets with maple chive creme fraiche - just ok for us, to be honest. \u00a0I remember having them before and being of the same mindset. \u00a0My fiance who is from the South really disliked them and said they weren't the least bit authentic. \u00a0For me, pretty bland and definitely needed to be dipped in the creme fraiche. \u00a0But cooked to perfection for sure.  Chilled gypsy pepper soup with charred corn, creme fraiche, blistered sweet chile - Beautifully seasoned, delicious and refreshing summer soup. \u00a0The fiance adored it. \u00a0One of the better things we had.  Panzanella salad with \"chicken vinaigrette (Whatever that means)\", kale, haricot verts, currants and bread. \u00a0I think this was my favorite of the night. \u00a0Bread was crisp, nicely dressed salad, green beans were crisp and fresh. \u00a0  Ft. Bragg King Salmon with charred lemon cucumber, radish, torpedo onion and tzatziki. \u00a0My least favorite of the night. \u00a0The salmon was perfectly cooked but it was a dish that seemed like it didn't mesh well together. \u00a0The weird almost pickle-like radishes and the sour tzatziki that was more like a bad tartare sauce than a yogurt-based sauce. \u00a0I ate the salmon and pretty much left the rest.  Stuffed Tolenas Farm Quail with butterball potato confit, padron chile, corn, and cipollini. \u00a0Best entree ordered, the quail being astoundingly perfect. \u00a0A must order. \u00a0I agree with my fiance in not enjoying the potato confit very much; honestly seemed like a basic roasted potato to me and was a bit dry. \u00a0  Ask for Josey Baker Bread. \u00a0My big complaint here is how stingy they were. \u00a0One slice of bread was all we got. \u00a0I'm used to at least a few slices in a basket. \u00a0But the bread is to die for so just ask for more.  For Dessert we had the Santa Rosa Plum Galette with creme fraiche, summer berries, and lime curd ice cream. \u00a0I was a little surprised the pastry chef suggested this to pair with the Sauternes I brought but I didn't like the other options. \u00a0The dessert was just great; seasonal, fresh, light. \u00a0Wasn't the best pair with our dessert wine, though.  We shared a taste of our wines with our server to make nice and we ended up giving the rest of our Sauternes to the kitchen staff.  Overall impression after three visits is that the food is just ok. \u00a0Some things are amazing while too many things fall flat. \u00a0The biggest complaint is that we almost didn't have one perfect dish; there was almost invariably something on each plate we didn't care for. \u00a0I'm not surprised they lost the Michelin star to be honest; not even sure why they had it in the first place. \u00a0I probably won't be back as there are too many great restaurants in the city to try. \u00a0But if you must cross it off your bucket list, you probably won't be too disappointed - as long as you go in with reasonable expectations.",

New york style, I don't know if I like it. \u00a0  I can't manage to plan ahead of time so just walked in right when it opened to sit at the bar. \u00a0Unless you get the corners where you'll be rubbing elbows with your neighbors, it's pretty good bar seats. \u00a0  Here were my thoughts on what I had:  The Beignets were COMPLETELY overrated. I was diassapointed to say the least. Definitely do not get.   Corn soup- so rich and creamy with a full sweet corn taste. It got me so nostalgic, since I've been on a hunt to find one that could remind me of those I grew up with in Tokyo. I would come back just for this.  Gem Salad- so simple, but feels so good to eat a clean, refreshing yet tasty salad  Steak - Cooked perfectly, great jus to make you want to lick the plate  Chocolate Dessert- this is my favorite chocolate dessert in the city, hands down. Wish this restaurant was closer so I could get it to go on a regular basis!",

    "review_text": "Not sure what I can add to the more than 700 reviews. Yes, Frances is worthy of making the top 10 best new restaurants of 2010 in Bon Appetit Magazine. It's been on my list that long and finally tried it for a friend's birthday celebration recently. We had to make the reservation six weeks in advance, and it was for a Tuesday evening. Yes, it's that good.   The applewood-smoked bacon beignets are reason enough alone to go, but Frances is the full package, from start to finish.   The end of our Frances experience was kind of great. My two girlfriends and I were busy catching up and oblivious that we had been at our table long after our check had arrived. Being that the restaurant is small and popular, the next diners were waiting for our table and had probably made a reservation six weeks in advance like we did. Our host approached our table and asked us if he could buy us a drink at the bar. I immediately understood what he was doing, trying in an affable way to get us up from our coveted table. I laughed, apologized and told him that was the best way I had experienced being kicked out of a table. We joked, went back and forth and I really appreciated the approach.   Wonderful food and overall experience.",

    "review_text": "Frances is definitely a great neighborhood find with fantastic cooking. It is the quintessential example of talented chefs bringing their skills to a more relaxed and local environment. \u00a0 Although they seem to take a small amount of walk-ins, I recommend reserving far in advance - it is a fairly small space. We started with their in-house made wine for $1 per ounce. I would absolutely recommend it. It is tasty and if you drink about a bottle it comes out to be about 25 dollars, so it is very economical. As a first timer, we were recommended the bacon beignets. These are an absolute must. They are delicious - and you will dream about them in the future. We also had the clams, which were good but not as exciting. Also, if you ask for bread they serve you a few delicious slices from acme. For entr\u00e9e I had the Bavette steak. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The risotto and accompanying sauces were so flavorful. This dish was an absolute knockout. My dining partner had the duck. While it was tasty, it did not compare to the steak. Because we were feeling gluttonous, we also ordered a side of the ricotta gnocchi. They were light fluffy pillows of joy with a nicely executed pesto to accompany it. To finish we decided to split the \"vol au vent\". This was a nice way to end the meal, but did not measure up to the other dishes. The candied ginger ice cream had great flavor, but the texture was off. \u00a0 Service the entire time was fantastic. We got great recommendations from our server, including appropriate food amounts as we were first timers. He was attentive and knowledgeable. \u00a0The meal had great pacing. Overall, would absolutely recommend Frances and would love to come back the next time I am in town.",

I haven't had a craving for them again since eating them. Maybe it's just not my thing.  *Bavette Steak - delicious!  *Gnocchi - Really good.   I forgot what else we ordered.

We had the beet salad, the beignets, the persimmon salad, the crab risotto, the steak and the lumberjack cake. \u00a0Everything was tasty and fresh. \u00a0The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. \u00a0It was a wonderful experience... \u00a0and we had no idea that we were eating at a Michelin star restaurant!   I was impressed by Frances, and was so happy to have found it. \u00a0Don't know if we will ever make it back, but I would definitely try to get in again if I was hungry in the Castro again! \u00a0I loved the local seasonal food choices and honestly, I have to figure out how they made that steak. \u00a0It was awesome.  Thanks for making my experience so lovely!",

    "review_text": "Winner, Winner Frances Dinner!!!  That's pretty much what I was thinking when I managed to get a last minute reservation. \u00a0I've heard people have waited for months to eat at this dining hot spot, so I definitely considered myself fortunate to have nabbed a reservation a week before!  We arrived Thursday night at 9:00 PM for dinner on New Year's Eve, Eve. We were kindly greeted by a girl that checked our reservations. \u00a0When she found out our reservations weren't til 9:30, she invited us to wait and look over the drink menu, but we opted to come back since the space was \"standing room only\" and the restaurant was very small.  We went and grabbed a drink down the street and returned at 9:30 sharp. \u00a0Contrary to all the horror stories we heard about the long tedious waits, we were immediately seated, which was a pleasant surprise. As others have mentioned, the seating here was TIGHT, but honestly, I didn't mind it much because the atmosphere was very cozy and I was still slightly buzzed from the drink i had earlier :) Our server was polite but a bit distant. \u00a0With that said, her support staff were very pleasant and friendly! The menu was quite small, and after looking over the selections, we knew exactly what we wanted. Here's what we had... The house wine (red and white) by the ounce. \u00a0This was a great value at $1 an ounce and the wine was delicious! I think I drank the entire carafe! Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets - You can't come here and not order these! They were absolutely delicious and the maple creme fraiche with chives was cool, refreshing and very addictive! Dungeness Crab Salad - The crab was well hidden in the tarragon vinaigrette dressing, but the flavors were on point! \u00a0In fact, the crab tasted very fresh, while the dressing was bright and citrusy. \u00a0A great light dish to start! Celery Root &amp; Pacific Oyster Chowder - I must agree with other reviewers in that i really could not detect the taste of oysters. However, i really enjoyed this dish. \u00a0It was aromatic, velvety smooth and totally satisfying! Five Dot Ranch Bavette Steak - This dish was beautifully plated and served with a perfect medium rare center. It was tender and mouthwatering delicious! Liberty Duck Leg - One of My favorite dishes of the evening! The duck was cooked perfectly. The meat was fragrant, tender and very moist. The Italian butter beans were creamy, smooth and very satisfying. The braised chicories and Sicilian olives added a nice amount of bite and saltiness to the dish to balance out all the mild flavors nicely. The pleasant surprise of the evening was when a nice couple arrived at 10:00pm and sat right next to us. When I found out the girlfriend, Kim C was a fellow Yelper, I was ecstatic! We immediately started shared dining experiences and recommendations...it was awesome! Funny thing was, we ended up sharing our meals and I got the amazing opportunity to try all the other items on the menu, like the cod, the roasted brussel sprouts, golden polenta, which were ALL good! For dessert, we shared the Lumberjack cake with a maple walnut ice cream from Humphrey Slocombe. \u00a0The cake was quite earthy and paired well with the ice cream. Overall, the food here was great. \u00a0It was warm and comforting without any kind of pretension, but in all honesty, what made the evening extra special was making new friends! They really made my experience enjoyable and that's something I will never forget!  \u00a0 Happiest Eats!",

    "review_text": "ERMAHGERRRD.  Frances has been one of those \"must go\" places in my bookmarks for years now, and I finally got the chance to go. Luckily, despite how overhyped it had become in my brain, it still managed to meet and often surpass my lofty expectations.  Of course, my friends and I immediately zeroed in on the bacon beignets, but I'd have to say it was my least favorite part of the meal. They weren't terrible by any means, but despite my unholy love of bacon and all things porky, it just wasn't as knock my socks off delicious as I wanted it to be. The smokiness was nice, but the beignets themselves were a bit too salty for my blood, even when dipped in the luscious maple chive sauce.  But after that - pure perfection.  We started with three appetizers after the beignets. We ordered the bacon salad, which was pretty freakin' awesome. Here, the bacon didn't dominate, but enhanced the plate. The butter lettuce and heirloom tomatoes were totally fresh and delicious.  The roasted soup was also fantastic. I'm glad we scored a table during peak heirloom season, as all three dishes that featured the fruit were amazing. The soup, though, was probably the best. Smoky, but still tomatoey and delicious.  The pasta was a spugnole, which was awesome because the little crevasses caught all the tasty heirloom tomato sauce. Every bit popped with sauce...it was like eating a savory gusher, but even better.  For the main, all three of us were unadventurous and ordered three bavette steaks. Seriously, though, I'm still glad I did. A perfectly cooked mound of beef resting on butter beans and pesto...win.  The kitchen forgot out fried green tomato side, so the restaurant courteously made it up to us with a free dessert to go along with the other one we ordered. Of the two, the one we didn't order (the lumberjack cake) far surpassed the one we did (tarte tartin), so I'm glad the restaurant helped us out on that one.  I'd come back to Frances anytime - great service, even with that hiccup, and truly dynamite food.",

    "review_text": "We had to reserve weeks in advance for a 10:30pm spot on a Saturday. For the weeks leading up to our meal, all I had to do was wonder how good Frances was gonna be for making me wait so long and trek out on a late night for some food.  I must preface this review by saying that my meal at Frances was my fifth of the day (yes, you read that correctly). And even then, it was one of the most amazing meals I've ever had! That's saying something.  My first impression of the restaurant was its front door. Its hours said 5:00~10:30 for Saturday. I inwardly panicked! Are they going to let us in at 10:30 for our reservation? Usually restaurants put their latest closing time, not the last reservation time. I was very relieved when we were ushered in warmly by the host. The dining room is well lit with 2 rows of tables along a rectangular corridor. The tables by the wall have benches with comfy cushions for your back. This totally helped because after eating all that food, I could use the back support!  The host came by to, sadly, inform us that the bacon beignets were all out! That's what we get for coming in at 10:30, I guess. However, he did mention that they filtered their own water. Points for this because I can't get used to SF tap water at all.  Every dish we ordered was exquisite. I couldn't pick out one wrong aspect of any of them! Here is a rundown:  Gratin of trumpet mushrooms with fennel, onion, endive and parmesan. I'd have to say this was the best dish of the night. I absolutely love mushrooms (of any kind) and was blown away by the play of flavors and textures of this dish! I was very glad the cheese did not weigh down the other ingredients. Great side!  Dungeness crab risotto. The lemon creme was the highlight of the dish! The light citrus flavor cut through the heaviness of the risotto perfectly.  Calamari salad with kabocha and a bunch of other stuff. The colors were wonderful! I couldn't help but stare at (and smell) it! The calamari was tender and flavorful and I loved the addition of the kabocha.  Duck breast. Thick slices with 80% lean and 20% fat, cooked medium rare, served with a duck jus. Rich flavors, tender texture... just wonderful!  Wheat crepes. I loved the presentation of this dish! The crepe looked like a fried spring roll from a chinese take out place but was soft, flavorful, and not greasy! Yum yum yum~  Broccoli and cauliflower. I love this combination, especially when roasted with garlic. Even if you have bad childhood memories of these two veggies, I promise that you can't go wrong with this execution of them!  I couldn't believe I had room for dessert at this point. I was ready to food coma all the way. But who can resist chocolate cake, burnt caramel sauce, salted caramel ice cream, and caramelized bananas? Yes, it's as good as it sounds! Too bad I didn't get to try the panna cotta... the espresso gelee sounded delicious!  It's been a few days after the fact, but I'm still reeling from fond memories of everything I had at Frances. Be sure I will be back (at an earlier hour) for the bacon beignets!",

    "review_text": "I've been dying to try Frances for ages, and I have to say it's one of the better dining experiences I've had in San Francisco (still waiting on my inaugural State Bird Provisions visit).  I came with a friend after managing to snag an earlier reservation (good luck trying to get something on short notice at dinner time). \u00a0Note that the menu gets printed everyday, so some of these dishes might not be available all the time.  We ordered the bacon beignets, roasted fingerling potatoes and mushrooms, mussel linguine, bavette steak, and duck breast.  The bacon beignets - despite all their hype - weren't actually all that amazing. \u00a0I wish they'd tasted a bit more like bacon instead of just getting a few crude looking bacon bits sprinkled on top. \u00a0The maple creme fraiche was a nice touch though.  The roasted potatoes and mushrooms were perfectly roasted so they were just soft enough on the inside and a bit charred on the outside, and the mushrooms were thoroughly (but not overly) cooked. \u00a0Again the creme fraiche helped the dish standout.  My friend thoroughly loved the bavette steak, commenting about how tender it was. \u00a0I actually preferred the duck breast - it was seared perfectly and cooked evenly throughout, and the chestnut puree was unique and accompanied the dish really well. \u00a0I'd definitely order this again if I came back.  Service: \u00a0Great! \u00a0No complaints, very friendly, and excellent recommendations. \u00a0  Bottom line: \u00a0Looking for a nice dinner in the city? \u00a0Check out some of the excellent options at Frances but make sure to book well in advance. \u00a0The prices are a bit steep, but it's well worth it.",

We also had the crab salad which had a good amount of crab and tasty mandarins and the pasta and sausage which was probably my favorite item on the menu. \u00a0For our main meal we had the scallops and duck. \u00a0Both were excellent but I would highly recommend the scallops.  Although we had a lot to eat, we saved some room for dessert and asked for recommendations. \u00a0Without skipping a beat the owner recommended the Lumberjack cake. \u00a0We also had the Chocolate Clafoutis. \u00a0Both were very large servings and excellent.

So, I'd give it a solid 4 stars, but once you factor in the wait, price and crowds it falls to a 3.

The Caramelized Atlantic Scallops with sunchoke puree &amp; roasted fennel were tender and tasty but with only 3 to the plate \u00a0rather skimpy in \u00a0quantity. \u00a0Another person in my party loved the Liberty Farm duck breast but be warned, it is served up VERY rare, a third entree ordered got a good report: \u00a0the Halibut with carnaroli risotto--with special kudos for the risotto. \u00a0The Five Dot Ranch Bavette Steak was beautiful to look at but tough--the person who ordered it had to ask for a steak knife to cut it. \u00a0  Be prepared to sit on top of neighboring tables (hence our knowledge of the next table's reaction to the soup). \u00a0One plus was that our reservation was made only a week in advance, probably a cancellation, but worth the try if you don't have a longtime reservation.  Good food, small portions, tight seating.",

Came here with a group of four, with reservations booked 3 months out. \u00a0We got lucky with parking and ended up parking at some building that required no permit after 6pm.  We ordered the following: 1) Panisse Frites - Chickpea fritters, calabrese chili, lemon aioli. It came with 4 pieces and they were really creamy. \u00a0I especially liked the orange sauce it came with. 2) Applewood smoked bacon beignets - maple chive creme fraiche. \u00a0Came with 5 pieces and you could see the small chunks of bacon as you bit into the beignets. \u00a0Soft on the inside with a slightly crispy outside. 3) Dungeness Crab Risotto - Delta aspargus and meyer lemon creme. \u00a0My favorite dish of the dinner! \u00a0Delicious and flavorful. \u00a0I could have had bowls of this for dinner. I especially liked the meyer lemon flavor and it wasn't overly creamy. 4) Grilled Quail and wilted baby kale salad - spiced jus, lemon, roasted spring onions. \u00a0We all expected a whole quail with the kale salad, but to our surprise we found that the quail was already cut up. \u00a0Nonetheless it was very tasty and the onions were sweet. 5) Salmon with beets - I think this was the best salmon I have ever tasted so far. \u00a0I was hesitant to order it for fear of it being dry, but it was moist and very flavorful! \u00a0The beets weren't the deep maroon/red color, but more pink with a vinegary sweet flavor. 6) Lumberjack cake - medjool dates with maple-walnut ice cream. \u00a0Soo yummy! \u00a0Love the cake - sweet, soft and warm. \u00a0The maple-walnut ice cream was very tasty too. \u00a0Best thing was the cake wasn't so warm that it melted all the ice cream. 7) Strawberry Panna Cotta with pistachios - It was alright, I'd stick with the lumberjack cake.  Overall, one of the best dinners I've had in SF, and I would love to come back in the future for more.",

    "review_text": "There are only several times in life when you have a perfect dining experience from beginning to end. My experience at Frances was one of those times.   It is no surprise why this place is booked up months in advance with such high reviews. Luckily I was able to snag a table shortly after two weeks ahead. If you do not have a reservation, do not bother trying to walk-in because you'll likely be disappointed.   The seating is limited and cozy which may be not desired by some. So cozy that if you're seated on the banquet you need to pull out your table to exit. So if you're a frequent visitor to the restrooms, I'd recommend you sit on the chair side.   Moving onto the important stuff, the food. One word to describe the food is Wow! My husband ordered the chestnut soup and it is by far, hands down one of the best soups that have touched my lips. I ordered a mushroom pasta which was light but full of flavor. The steak and fish entrees were crafted with perfection and we finished the meal with the chefs lovely hand apple pies.   The service was impeccable and the food was spaced out well. I was really impressed by the level of attention we received and I cannot wait to return when I visit San Francisco again.   My only regret was not ordering some bread. After ordering I noticed that fresh bread was cut at the table, by request only. It smelled and looked delectable! Fortunately I think if we had any our bellies would have exploded but it would probably be worth it.   Would certainly recommend trying this place out. The quality of food for this price point can not be beat.",

    "review_text": "5 stars for food, -1 star for atrocious service. If the food weren't so damn good, I would've docked it another one.  We started off with the market shot, and got both white and red house blend wines during our meal. All were good, and I definitely like the \"$1.50 per ounce, pay only for what you drink\" concept.  As for food, I enjoyed EVERY dish that we got:   Bacon beignets - That slight hint of sweetness in their maple creme fraiche sauce is what makes this dish. It pairs nicely with the slight saltiness of the bacon. I totally want to put that sauce on everything...  Roasted beets and dungeness crab salad - This might've been one of the best things during the meal. The warm beets had that perfect \"roast\" flavor, and the crab was exceptionally fresh and sweet tasting.  Duck breast - Cooked perfectly (i.e. medium rare but on the rare side), and delicious!  Bavette steak - Also one of my favorites. Great flavor on the meat, and again, this was cooked absolutely perfect so that the meat was very juicy and tender.  Lumberjack cake - The sweet apple-cinnamon flavor of the cake paired nicely with the muscavado ice cream. And yes, I have no f'ing clue what muscavado is, but just read about it on Wikipedia haha.  So what was so problematic about the service? -No server came to our table for a LONG LONG time after we sat down. Not even to ask what we wanted for drinks. Definitely annoying considering we were starving. -We asked for bread when we ordered. No bread came. We had to flag down a different waiter who was serving bread to another table during our entree course to get some for ourselves. -Something just felt \"snobby\" about the way the waiter interacted with us. Not sure what it was, but both the gf and I felt that way. We go to stuffy restaurants often, but we definitely don't get that vibe from the staff at those.. not sure what was up with this place. -The worst crime of all? I made reservations two months in advance, and I made a note in the reservation that it's for my gf's birthday so I would like it if they did something special like candles on a dessert or something. What did they do? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. What did another table at the restaurant get while we were there? A candle on a motherf---ing dessert. Way to turn our special occasion meal into just another regular meal, Frances. I've always had nicer restaurants ask me about the special occasion note when they contact me to confirm the reservation, but this place didn't do jack sh*t.  tl;dr - Food is great, but the service blows. Don't go here for special occasions.",

I can unequivocally say that it is one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. It hits every single thing I look for in a restaurant:   1. Inventive, constantly shifting, seasonal food that doesn't veer to far into the zany. Just rustic, solid, perfectly executed dishes.  2. An appropriate price point to quality. You can actually go here on the relative reg and not end up homeless.  3. The right size. Frances is basically a converted painted lady by my best guess (townhouse) that they put a small restaurant in. Because of this it feels really intimate, it is never too croweded, and the food is able to be consistently at a high standard. \u00a0Service, too. \u00a0I'm sure the chef could, if she wanted, run a 500 table monster in the Financial District but she chooses a small, neighborhoody feel.  4. I don't always drink wine, when I do it is at Frances. The house blends are so solid and affordable...  Final tips - bacon beignets are original and signature. Entrees shift seasonally (if not more frequently), but I've had whatever beef/steak they're offering both times I attended and loved them.",

The panisse frites (chickpea fritters) were crispy and delicious, risotto had CHUNKS of crab and not too creamy or heavy. \u00a0Halibut was perfectly cooked- crispy on the skin, moist and flaky in the center. The little gem salad was fresh and dressed just the right amount. \u00a0The crepe crespelles were earthy, hearty and warm. \u00a0Not to mention we had the house wine that was $1 per ounce!!!

Love that they offer a house wine by the ounce - white or red - and charge you only for what you drink. Allows you to have more or less than a bottles worth without worrying about portioning it out between everyone.

We always look for 4.5 stars and up and this place was the only one within walking distance that made our cut. Strolled up around 430 on Saturday to find a small line of people waiting to get in without reservations at 5 when Frances opens. We'd never heard of it and asked the people waiting if it was worth the wait. Everyone had tried for reservations and failed and couldn't wait to get in. They said, just wait and you'll see, trust us.   Boy are we glad we waited. What an amazing dinner! We shared the cucumber with sunflower seed tahini and the tagliatelle with chicken, tomatoes, olives, and other delicious things.   Then my friend had the quail, her first time having quail, and she loved it. I had the vegetable cassoulet and it was amazing too! I also had the market shot (watermelon and other market goodies today) and the cava-peach cocktail, both delicious. \u00a0  We finished up the meal with the lumberjack apple \"cake\" with maple ice cream and the chocolate walnut \"brownie\" with salted caramel ice cream. \u00a0EPIC.

The place is very small so we had to squeeze into a corner to wait. As we were waiting, we each took a market shot (changes every so often). It tasted like a shot of veggie and fruit juice with a bit of alcohol. Yum. We also tried their house wine (charged by the ounce) which was surprisingly delish.  (Rant: I think it is common knowledge that when you are seated in a communal area within a restaurant, you simply cannot spend however long you want there since there are other people waiting. I guess it's common knowledge except to the two rude women that occupied two of the three seats we needed. They took an hour to finish desert and even after they paid, spent another half hour just chatting. They were finally asked to vacate their seats since we had been waiting forever for them to clear the table. And they saw us waiting for them the whole time too! Inconsiderate people suck!)  As soon as we were seated, we ordered right away. We were waiting for more than 1.5 hours after all. We also asked for the complimentary bread since we were starving. The bread was soft and warm so it was a great starter.  We started off with the Bacon Beignets - so good. They were soft little balls of bacon goodness. The beignets emitted a lot of bacon flavor that made me think there were bacon pieces in there. The creme freche that they serve the beignets with complement the bacon flavor very well since it's somewhat light.  Next came the Persimmon Salad and the Crab Risotto. I liked the dressing on the salad but what I loved was the risotto. It's a very small portion but packs a whole lotta flavor - very rich in taste and texture.   For our entrees, we got the Duck Breast and Five-Dot Steak. I wasn't too crazy about the steak though it was prepared very well. Don't get me wrong - the steak was still good. It's just that the Duck was excellent. The duck skin was not too fatty yet they were able to retain the tenderness and succulence that usually only Chinese places are able to achieve. The meat itself was cooked to a perfect medium that retained a light pink color.   We also had a side of baby artichokes which I completely neglected what with all the other mouth-watering dishes in front of us. For a Michelin-rated place, the price is quite good. I can't wait til I come back, this time with resies.",

Northern Halibut, chanterelle and english peas ragout, bacon, cipollini onions - I swear on the holiest piece of foie gras out there that this was the most perfectly cooked piece of fish ever.

There really is no other way of getting in! I hate waiting in line, so reservations is a must, and it rings especially true here. But if you can wait, it is worth it. The food was so orgasmically good, I wanted to bathe in them.   Parking is a bit of a biotch as it's street parking and well.. you know.. SF + Street Parking = nonexistent.",

We started off with the bacon beignets. These were good and had a hint of bacon. We also got the baked clams and our waiter offered to give us two more on the house! These were yummy. We then shared the tuna confit and pea soup which were both really delicious. For entrees, he had the steak and I went with the halibut. His was delicious but mine was pretty vanilla. We ordered two desserts to share - chocolate cake that came with almond ice cream and lemon pound cake that came with sweet corn ice cream. Both were really interesting and different. Thanks for a great dinner!",

Not at all pretentious, and the waiters are so nice and helpful.  The only downside is that you have to make a reservation two months in advance. But that's only because it's THAT AMAZING. The menu changes regularly. Everything is delicious, but in general I've enjoyed the small plates and bouchees more than the entrees. Plus you get to try more things that way. The chickpea fritters are pretty phenomenal. I also recommend getting the house wine, which you pay for by the ounce, and the market shots! They use such fresh ingredients. It's really a delight. I can't wait for my next trip!!",

    "review_text": "This is the story of the night no reservations turned into being the last ones to leave the restaurant. It's one of my favorite meals of the year.  It started with some tablestalking. Quickly realizing getting a table that very night was going to be impossible (heck, three weeks out looked impossible), I started to call. And call again. And again. The guy answering the phone was likely over me by the fourth call. Each time the answer was the same. No tables.  Eff it. We were going to walk up and roll the dice.  Around 10pm we stepped in and was greeted by the friendliest of hostesses. The place was buzzing, no doubt the mood enhanced by some outstanding $3 market shots, a delectable combination of fruit and booze. We got the last one, took a few sips each, mutually agreed that on a somewhat warm night, this was the perfect elixir.  Friendly hostess kept us up to speed on our table chances. It went from no, to slight, to we might be able to do something, to you'll be seated shortly. I think the two of us, smiling and clearly enamored to be eating here, helped plead our case. We sat down around 10:30.  I've written this before and I'll likely write it again, there are similarities to the best nights dancing and the best nights eating. There is storytelling, there is human connection and there is losing any context of time. Frances was a remarkable \"DJ\".  Our story started with bacon beignets. Yep. Bacon. Beignets. Two things I'd avoid on their own, but cannot recommend enough together.  We continued with three mutual loves - butternut squash, caramelized anything and honey. That love manifested into grilled calamari with butternut squash, a side of wildflower honey glazed carrots and a main of caramelized scallops. All utterly divine.  The most euphoric moment of the \"set\" was the ricotta gnocchi. Best. Gnocchi. Ever. We both looked up and had that moment where we \u00a0both realized how absolutely amazing it was. Wow.   We also had the grilled asparagus salad, the one dish that was a notch below being blown away. Which means outstanding just about everywhere else. By this point, the bar had been set really, really high.  All this was happening while being serviced by a friendly and confident wait staff. Conversation flowed as easily as the wine, with the food and company blending into the already infectious vibe from those around us. This was a special place.  And like all good shows, this one had to come to an end. A three hour experience felt like 15min, and by the time we left, it was close to 1am. We were the last ones to leave, no one rushed us, everyone gratefully took our thanks, and we walked back towards the mission knowing this was one roll of the dice well worth taking.  Enjoy.",

Frances...is not going to let me down in this case. Their bacon beignets were unforgettable. Their salads are beautiful to stare at, and more enjoyable to eat. Their dishes are all outstanding, yet reasonably priced.  Although this place is a lot smaller than I had anticipated, your palate is sure to be blown away.  The only down side here is the noise level. You have to speak in loud voices, and that's always unpleasant on a date.",

    "review_text": "A wonderful gem tucked away in the corner of the Castro. Went a few weeks ago with some friends after being told by co-workers that it is their favorite restaurant in the city. It was pretty difficult to get reservations but one day when I was looking on OpenTable, there was a reservation open that I could make so it was fate!  Looks like the menu changes often depending on what ingredients are available. Was looking forward to trying the duck but it was not available the day we went. We had the Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets and Grilled Calamari to share, and I ordered the Ft. Bragg King Salmon (others ordered the Five-Dot Ranch Bavette Steak and the Stuffed Tolenas Farm Quail). Calamari was delicious. Salmon was cooked perfectly. Beignets I was looking forward after reading yelp, but feel that Brenda's crawfish beignets were better (they are quite different, and maybe it's not fair to compare the two). I usually skip dessert but the Lumberjack cake was too tempting to pass up, so I split it with a friend. I'm glad we got it :D  Overall, wonderful food, warm homey feeling and surprisingly affordable! \u00a0I think it could use some more variety in terms of menu items, but can understand it's probably difficult with a smaller restaurant like Frances. Wonderful experience, and I'll be back again (so long as I can get a reservation!)",

    "review_text": "I had wanted to visit Frances ever since it opened, but because it was fully booked for about six months, I had to wait it out.   I have been pleased with the service, ambiance, food, and drinks every time I visit Frances for dinner. The location is not too far from the Castro Muni station, and is nestled in a relatively quiet residential area. The setting is intimate, with just a handful of tables side by side. They have a server going around with slices of Acme bread who will stop by your table and drop off a couple if you ask!  Food: The bacon beignets are a staple, and the maple chive creme fraiche is to die for! I always end up ordering a second plate. Their salads are delicious, and usually have an ingredient that really makes the greens pop, such as squid. The entrees are constantly changing, but I usually get duck, which I've had paired with some bitter greens, some chanterelles, and always soaked in a fragrant duck juice.   Drinks: Frances offers a daily market shot, which is juice made from whatever fruit they have at hand that has been spiked! I found this incredibly sweet and fragrant, which was right up my alley, great for those who don't like strong drinks. If you order the standard red or white, they leave a decanter with tick marks at your table. By the end of the meal, they calculate how much you've drank by the tick marks and charge you accordingly! Pretty neat.  Service: Impeccable. Great recommendations from the waiters.  Frances has become a fixture in town in a short time, and with good reason. This is a place that serves up quality, comforting food, with a hint of elegance (and with affordable pricing!). Just don't forget to make reservations!!",

The steak was on a bed of something starchy and cut up leaves, and sauce was poured at the table, which is always a nice touch.  *Lobster noodles: \u00a0I was expecting chunks of lobster, but the lobster came sliced. I thought the texture and flavors really came together well. *Tomato soup: \u00a0Thick, hearty, and flavorful, with almost a marinara sauce consistency.   Minuses:  *Bacon beignets: \u00a0If we're being honest, the beignets were really more like hush puppies with a side of ranch dipping sauce. This was a complete fail.  Service was adequate, but not spectacular, much like the whole experience.   That being said, I would come back for a special occasion, and frankly, given the dearth of fine dining options in the Castro, Frances stands head and shoulders above everything else in the neighborhood.",

Sometimes there's a small crowd out front around 5PM, milling about.  The cuisine, and it's that, not food, is memorable and wonderful. So simple and yet complex.  The wines, ah, what clever palates are at work here. Superb!  The service, like a well oiled machine. Professional, with personality. Excellent!  Enjoy!",

    "review_text": "Took my boyfriend here for his birthday.  Loved the decor. Cozy, perhaps on the louder side for a pricier restaurant, but very understated, relaxed, and unpretentious. Seats are lined up mostly on one side, much like The House. Seats are pretty close to each other, but most people seem pretty friendly and people will politely give you space if you're trying to squeeze out from behind the table.   Service was alright. Our server did his job, but he didn't seem particularly nice or didn't really go out of his way to make the experience really, really memorable. I'm not sure how to explain it, but I almost felt like we were somewhat overlooked because of our age. Kind of bugged me, but he did everything he was supposed to. Just didn't seem very warm to me.  Now the food.  A lot of people seem to be disappointed in this place, and I think that if you're trying to be super hip/trendy/out there with the food, it's not going to happen here. This is a very traditional place (not in the stuffy sense, but in the RUSTIC sense).  The food is simple...But extremely well executed. My boyfriend got the five-dot steak and I got the duck breast. The steak was beautiful, so moist at medium rare, so tender, and wonderfully paired with a sauce that they poured over. My duck was also succulent and wonderfully cooked, but not toooo different from asian duck I've had. Maybe it's cause I'm asian, I've just had so much good duck.  But the main surprise was the dessert: THE TARTE TATIN. I beg you, try this. It's basically a delicious apple tarte thing with a side of (actually strong) rum ice cream with raisins and candied walnuts. Scrumptious.  So all in all, if you like good, simple, rustic food with a relaxed atmosphere, this is a good place. If you're looking for a pinky-raising place and trendy food, this isn't.",

    "review_text": "Frances, do you know what I had to do just to eat at your restaurant? \u00a0Well first off, I called in March and you said the next available table for two on Friday or Saturday was in July or past July. \u00a0This got me intrigued and kind of upset because I do not nor do I like to wait that long. \u00a0So it's been four months and no I didn't make the reservation because that's planning too far in advance even for me, the planner of everything. \u00a0Enough chit chat, here's the review.  GF and I came on the night before the pride parade which I believe is Pink day. \u00a0We had no idea it was Pink day until we saw a couple of friends a few hours before dinner. \u00a0I dropped off the gf at 5pm and circled for half an hour until I finally found parking at a lot for $15 (at Home restaurant) which is a close walk. \u00a0When I finally got there the maitre' D, waiters all welcomed and congratulated me on making it to dinner which was much welcomed. \u00a0The restaurant is a small place with a bit of New York SoHo vibe to it. \u00a0It doesn't seat many tables and all the tables were for the reserved. \u00a0The only place for walk ins are the seats at the communal counter. \u00a0It was a bit cramped but when eating with the gf, it is A-Ok with me.  We shared several dishes and here is the break down.  Bacon Beignets: I demand you to order these. \u00a0Bacon, fried, beignets, man what a combo. \u00a0With the addition of the sauce which I forgot what it was already but who cares, all I remember was how good these things are. \u00a0  Chicken Liver Mousse: I also demand you to order these. \u00a0Big scoop of chicken liver mousse with toasted bread and salad. \u00a0As Tony the Tiger would say \"It's greeeeat.\"  Grilled Calamari: Hmm, nothing too special about this. \u00a0I think it could have been done better but by no means is it a bad course. \u00a0There are olives, beans, and a bit of greens to compliment it.  Corn Soup: This was tasty. \u00a0It was light but a bit oily and there were shrimp/prawns.  Lamb: This was a delightful dish. \u00a0Lamb was cooked three ways; riblets, pieces of lamb loin, and crepe wrapped brisket. \u00a0The latter was the worse, tasted a jerky. \u00a0The riblets were very tasty and the lamb loin was tender, juicy, perfectly cooked.  Dungeness Crab Salad : Very light, generous amount of crab meat, fresh greens. \u00a0I think this was the only greens on the menu and if you need some greens, you need to order this.  Drinks: Gf got a strawberry fizz but it tasted more like fruit juice than alcohol. \u00a0The home made 7-up was really not that much different from a regular 7-up.  I'm giving it four stars because I enjoyed pretty much everything we ordered although some dishes didn't blow me away. \u00a0The service is excellent and attentive. \u00a0The place is intimate and comfortable and if it wasn't so hard to get a table, I would go back more often. \u00a0  I highly recommend you trying Frances even if you have to eat early or wait in line because it is worth it.",

    "review_text": "I hate to give this place 3 stars because the service was impeccable, top notch. Everyone was super nice. I really liked the appearance and ambiance of the place. The nighborhood is just lovely. Definitely make reservations ( I did on Yelp app via Open Table.. must have gotten lucky because we got a table for 7pm, and reserved at 5pm)  Based on the Yelp reviews here, and average of 4.5 stars, I had very high expectations, some of which were met. We asked about other wines not on the wine list, and our waiter neglected to mention the house wine, which is several dollars cheaper than any of the wines listed. Thankfully, we asked another waiter and he explained it all to us. $18 for a carafe of house red or white wine. Versus the half bottle of Syrah for $42 we ordered. Huge difference! Not that we're being cheap but we at least should be offered the choice if available.   On to the food. First, bacon beignets. I heard all about these.. they were OK. The bacon did not make much of an impact. I had the warm spinach salad.. again, it was OK. I eat spinach all the time so I could not distinguish anything special about the dish. I had a taste of my partner's white corn soup .. that was spectacular! I wish I had orderd that! Truly a standout.  For main dish, I had the spring lamb. It was OK. Again, I eat a lot of lamb and this one did not stand out for me. I might even go as far as to say it was kind of bland. My partner was really disappointed with his salmon dish. He said I cook better salmon than that.  Dessert, I had the panna cotta. Meh, quite ordinary. My partner's chocolate almond clafoutis was very yummy though. I enjoyed that.   So I guess I enjoyed most of my partner's dishes! And none of mine. And looking at the bill afterwards, yes may not have been worth it. I would recommend you go though and judge for yourself. Many reviewers on here seem to really like it. Like I said, I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and ambiance and the service. It's definitely a step above most restaurants. I personally was just not impressed by some of the food.",

You almost certainly won't get a table if you're just dropping in, but the entire bar area is available for walk-ins. Try early or late, and in either case, if you have to wait, stand out of the way. Have a market shot to take the edge off.  Everyone knows about the beignets, and they are delicious, but other regular menu items like panisse frites and grilled calamari are equally brilliant and a good way to begin.   Frances is an incredible value. If you're willing to share, it's possible to order the majority of the menu, including house wine and dessert, for $75 per person. If you're not pigging out or drinking, you can do it for much less.  Never forget to save enough room to share a dessert. The lumberjack cake is a classic: moist, with perfectly balanced textures and flavors.",

I've had the pleasure to dine here a few times and every visit has never failed to impress. \u00a0Having read a little about Perello's excursions on the Food Network's show \"Chefs vs. City\" featuring Chefs Chris Cosentino and Aaron Sanchez, I was hoping to even catch a glimpse of her in action, in her very own domain. \u00a0Its like watching a painter create his/her masterpiece as they maneuver around their canvas in a way only they could understand. \u00a0Thats why I love taking advantage of having a seat with a view of the kitchen if there is one available (there's a single seat at the bar with a narrow line of sight directly to the back of the kitchen but it can be tricky to position yourself to have a decent view).  Not only has her attention to detail been reflected in the food and decor, but also to her staff at the serving line. \u00a0As General Manager, Patrick consistently welcomes you as if he is welcoming you to his own home. \u00a0The space itself is quite small and not ideal for larger groups (especially over 6 people), but rather provides just the right intimate setting for a dinner date or even double date.  After having tried most of the fare offered on the menu, you begin to realize the easiest job here would be the chef de plonge or head dishwasher because every dish comes back almost as clean as it was before it was plated.  Frances quickly became one of my favorite restaurants in SF and the purpose of this review was really so I could contribute towards ensuring it receives the recognition and highest rating it really deserves. \u00a0For further insight on the quality of the food itself, see below!",

    "review_text": "YUMMMM! frances has been on my list for a while now. reservations are quite hard to come by for weekends! but i made one for 5:15 pm (lol) on a saturday, showed up ono time, and found that there were quite a few open seats at the bar, so we did that instead. lol. there is a good view of the kitchen action if you get those seats. but man, this cozy little place is poppppular! it was 100% full by 6 pm on saturday.  anyhoooo -- we started with market shots, which were refreshing. asked for bread - also really good. tried the linguine \u00e1 la marini\u00e8re - a nice appetizer portion and it was delish. the noodles were perfectly cooked, the mussels not sandy (normally i dont like mussel dishes), with a nice cream sauce. yummmm-o! also tried the crab salad with warm beets, a bouchee for $8 - boy really liked this, i was somewhat not as impressed. meep.   onto the entrees - i ordered the duck breast - medium rare and so juicy! special of the night was grilled lamb t-bones with a pesto sauce, so boy got that, and was pretty happy with it. we shared a side of broccoli with sieved egg - very intentive!   then there was house wine - served in a flask and measured in ounces (though other options are available - pretty long wine list! \u00a0anyhoooo - we got 27 ounces. HAHAHA. by far the most expensive item on the bill. which brings me to the price point of frances. it's completely reasonable considering the quality of the dishes, the ingredients, anddd the amount of food that they give you! well done! i told boy that the dishes remind me of gary danko, without the price tag, which is a pretty good compliment i daresay.  the chef is opening a new restaurant where the old baker and banker space was. excited to try that!",

    "review_text": "I was a little underwhelmed at Frances. \u00a0We came here at the recommendation of several friends (all of whom are foodies). I had been looking forward to it for weeks - images of bacon beignets danced around in my head. You get the idea.  The restaurant is adorable. In a nice quiet street in mission/castro. It's small and bustling. The staff there BEYOND nice and hospitable. \u00a0Food we had was decently good and definitely executed well - bacon beignets, heirloom tomato soup, tagliatelle with braised beef, steak, and green beans side. Nothing but the heirloom tomato soup really stood out, however. \u00a0The bacon beignets were OK but nothing worth craving over. \u00a0The tagliatelle was good but subpar to the one at Delfina. And the green beans were actually a little weird - they were cold. and seemingly raw given they were crunchy. \u00a0That threw us a bit.  I think normally I would have given Frances 4 stars. \u00a0But the reason for 3 stars is personal - their menu is heavy in vegetables. There were only 3 entree options around meat - 1 was salmon (yawn), steak (sure if you LOVE red meat), and quail (eh, who really get that excited about a quail main course? appetizer, sure. in pasta, sure. but main course?). \u00a0And 65-75% of the rest of their menu centers around veggies. \u00a0I'm a meat and pasta kind of person, so it even took us a while to decide on enough food to order.  Definitely head here if you're vegetarian. this place would be like heaven. But me and my particular, carnivorous palate are unlikely to return.",

Linguine with squid ink sauce- \u00a0Again for $14 portion really really small. \u00a0Definitely a disappointment \u00a0felt like it was missing a protein or vegetable. \u00a0Just pasta with sauce, while executed perfectly was not a dish.  Crepe with lemon meyer sauce. \u00a0Highlight of the night \u00a0but too little sauce. \u00a0I did ask for more sauce and made another without lemon meyer. \u00a0Otherwise dish was perfect and really enjoyed it.

    "review_text": "Frances is okay. \u00a0Michelin Star, really? \u00a0I did not know this, as my only intention was finding a restaurant known for chickpea fritters. \u00a0I was dreaming of it, must have it, stat!!!! \u00a0Okay, so here are my personal thoughts of the individual dishes  1) Chickpea Fritters - Despite the raving reviews that Frances brought chickpea fritters back...I didn't see it. \u00a0It was good, and I guess it was what it should be, but it wasn't great. Sadness 2) Bacon Beignets - Bacon-y and delicious, just very fatty and two was all I could take. 3) Clams - I loved these, but the date didn't. \u00a0He couldn't taste any clam. \u00a0I tasted bacon, fatty sauce, and yummy flavors; but no clam taste.  4) Duck entree - the duck was undercooked and chewy 5) Steak entree - it was good, but nothing stellar. \u00a0I would rather eat steak at Harris' or Hillstone's.  6) Lumberjack cake - meh.....  Service was spectacular. \u00a0Wine by the ounces were good. \u00a0We had a good time. \u00a0The table next to us did too. \u00a0However, something was lacking here. \u00a0The food wasn't haute dining, but more like your neighborhood French Bistro (just not French). \u00a0It was loud and lively. \u00a0Prices weren't too bad. \u00a0This is just my personal preference as everyone has different tastebuds. \u00a0So, I do recommend Frances, I just don't think it's for me.",

    "review_text": "We had a reservation for 10:00 p.m. on Saturday evening, and managed to find street parking close by (just around the block). \u00a0When we walked in, the restaurant was completely packed. \u00a0We had a third person meeting us and he was running late, so we decided to order wine and bouchees with haste (the kitchen closes at 10:30 p.m., I think). Frances has bar seating where it looks like you can order off of the full dinner menu, and I note that it was also completely packed. \u00a0  For wine, I ordered a Maximin Grunhauser Riesling. \u00a0Friends, that is a fabulous wine, even if it's not from the South of France (see my Aquitaine review). \u00a0My friend ordered the house red. Their house wine policy is cool--they charge $1 per ounce consumed. They put a carafe of wine on your table and you may drink to your heart's content. I tasted the house red, and I disliked it. I can't knock Frances for this, however, because I dislike red wine in general (I know, I'm not cultured, bobloblaw). \u00a0  I like that the menu is dated (i.e., the date is in the upper right hand corner). \u00a0Wouldn't that be a nice touch if you got engaged there? Or M. Perello could make an amazing cookbook organized by season from a year of menus .... *hint hint* \u00a0  We decided to start with the smoked bacon beignets with maple chive creme fraiche. Smoked bacon beignets = smokin' banana peels! Donuts and bacon are just a fantastic combo, no matter how you slice it. Maple chive creme fraiche? \u00a0I'd like to bathe myself in it while listening to Def Leppard's \"Pour Some Sugar On Me.\" \u00a0After we annihilated those in a matter of seconds, we ordered the Savory Pumpkin Bread with brown butter, apple, sage and pepitas off of the \"Sides\" menu, as well as the Purple Haricot Verts Caesar, with anchovy, parmesan, and pangrattato. \u00a0  The pumpkin bread was screamin. It was served fresh, piping hot--and its texture was dense and so pleasing. \u00a0I am prepared to marry whomever made the side of butter that the pumpkin bread was served with. The haricots verts? I love to say \"haricots verts\" because that is basically the only use I get from the 4 years of French I took, but they were just okay. Let's get real though, it's going to be difficult for a vegetable dish to follow bacon beignets and savory pumpkin bread.  For the main course, I wanted to order the Five-Dot Ranch Bavette Steak, but I was so full from the small plates that I could not justify ordering a beautiful plate of food that would likely need wrapped to go, plus both of my companions ordered it. \u00a0Instead, I ordered the Tagliatelle with tomato-braised chicken, Sicilian fennel seed, Kalamata olive, and Nardello peppers. I tasted my friends' steak, however, and it. was. beyond. delicious. Oh. my. goodness. The steak was a showstopper--Number One Stunner. \u00a0  I am starting to discover that I dislike olives. I am heavily influenced by the workings of the masterful yelper Johnna S., and now I dislike olives as a result. When I mentioned my newly found dislike of olives to my companions, they revoked my Lebanese card indefinitely. I think olives must be used sparingly because their flavor has a tendency to overpower other ingredients easily. The chefs at Frances obviously understand that. The pasta was delicious--homemade pasta is really a hit or miss---so when it's a hit, you have to celebrate with more wine. I was so full, however, that I could only take two or three bites. I sent the balance of my meal home with my friends. \u00a0 \u00a0  I wanted to pass on dessert, but I was outvoted (I choose my friends wisely). \u00a0They ordered the Dark Chocolate and Chandler Walnut Torte. I decided to force a few bites. Man, that dessert was just a straight up mind-blower-my eyes are still crossed. My friend said it was too sweet, but I dissent, respectfully. \u00a0  Our server was a little annoyed with us because we originally had four people in our party, but one of the four couldn't make it at the last minute, and the third one was thirty minutes late. I don't blame our server for being annoyed. \u00a0Nevertheless, the service was excellent and he ensured that we had a great meal. \u00a0He seemed to relax as the evening progressed and we ordered enough food for six people. As a former server in another life, I hated when people did that too, especially at the end of the evening. \u00a0  I assure you, you will need a reservation. I enjoyed everything about this evening, except the fact that I could not fit more food into my belly. Melissa Perello, I heart you.",

So why 4 stars? \u00a0Because after waiting three months for a reservation, my culinary expectations would never be fair. \u00a0And the service really was thoughtful and respectful. \u00a0And i got to meet Al Gore who was dining across from us thanks to D.

    "review_text": "My friend had scored a reservation 2 months in advance so we were excited when the day finally rolled around. However, I was swamped with work and requested we cancel last minute only to be confronted with a $50 cancellation fee... That pushed us into going anyways (though I suffered an all-nighter afterwards as a result).  Arriving already a little miffed, we waited quite a bit to be seated. Rumor has it the waiting cost them their Michelin star, though they try to appease you by providing complimentary treats. We were given a dry sherry and pomegranate juice concoction, which was honestly quite delicious. After being seated, the waiting continued as we finished contemplating \u00a0the menu. In response, they brought us an onion and chive dip with crackers. Once again the offering was delicious, but honestly the service is just conspicuously sluggish.   We ordered: -Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets - Maple Chive Creme Fraiche (perfect combination, no overpowering flavors, and the creme fraiche was so light and sweet I could have eaten it by the spoonful) -Squid Ink Linguine - Green Garlic, Cortez Bottarga, Meyer Lemon, Espelette (was not partial to this, but in general I just do not enjoy the peculiar taste of squid ink) -Bavette Steak - Creamed Kale and Napa Cabbage, Salsify, Maitake Mushroom (the meat was very pink and I usually order medium well, but very juicy and not bloody, super flavorful, and the mushrooms were amazing)  Unfortunately we didn't have time for dessert, but the Lumberjack Cake seems worth a try. The overall quality of the food was very good, which compensated somewhat for their lackadaisical service.",

They're attentive, knowledgable and appreciative-- and it's the appreciation that makes all the difference.   As everyone else points out, they have great house wines by the ounce. So Frances is a good value too!  You can check out photos of the food we got on our food website. The post is titled \"But Grandma! I'm a Vegetarian\" because Frances is the name of Chef Melissa Perello's grandmother, and it's that history that seems to come through in the experience of dining there.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Featsporkjew.com%2Frestaurants%2Ffrances_restaurant_castro%2F&amp;s=91f530160d1013ec4722b7b0fbba3f42089de36f3233afbdbac37df2a898d229\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">eatsporkjew.com/restaura\u2026</a>  With regards to the restaurant's non-culinary qualities:  It's a little hard to get a table. If you're walking by you might get lucky with a seat at the bar for walk-ins, but it's best to just try and make a reservation, because with a reservation, if the restaurant is behind in seating you, the GM will go out of his way to make it up to you. because that's how awesome their customer service is.   So what are you waiting for? Call the restaurant and take whatever table for two they have in six weeks.",

It's small and very difficult to get reservations to (and rightly so), but if you can get yourself in, then you're in for an experience that really showcases why SF is the pinnacle of fresh, contemporary American cuisine.  Bacon beignet = Delicious with the perfect amount of bacon flavor. Grilled calamari = Fresh and tasty. Calamari was excellently cooked. Dungeness crab salad = Very fresh. Steak = Perfectly cooked steak with a ton of flavor. Risotto = Excellent. Brussels Sprouts = Not too oily, which was great. Loved this. Squash = This was just okay. Flavors didn't pop out as much as I would've liked. Malva Cake = Rich and sweet. This was great. Maple ice cream = Excellent. House Red wine = Incredible. I loved the \"pay for what you drink\" method.  Our server, Bobi, was friendly and knowledgeable. The service was excellent.  My favorite part: everything cost about $50 a person, including tax &amp; tip.   Frances is an awesome restaurant that SF can really be proud of. It demonstrates what San Franciscan cuisine is all about, all at prices that more than justifies the experience that you get.",

The market shots were tasty and refreshing. \u00a0The service was a little off. \u00a0We went a while in between check-ins so ordering / refilling our wine carafe were lengthy pursuits. \u00a0My dish came much in advance of my boyfriend's which was a little odd, asked to have it re-heated. \u00a0Timing issues aside, the highlights were definitely the chickpea fritters, lumberjack cake (get it!), and the house wine system. \u00a0Glad we got a chance to visit Frances!",

While we certainly enjoyed our meal and very much appreciated the very attentive and professional staff I don't know we would come back.  There are so many other competitors in the city I think I look elsewhere next time out for a \"great\" or \"spectacular\" meal, which in my humble opinion is what a Michelin rating is all about.  Fair warning: Frances is located in tough spot to find, it may require a couple of calls to the restaurant to find it. Off of market between 15th and 16th. Definitely use Google maps! parking can be problematic.",

    "review_text": "Really enjoyed our meal at Frances. Simple, warm, inviting decor and friendly, helpful service.   All the food was excellent. Everything was very straight forward and expertly prepared, highlighting each ingredient. Just as it should be!  We ordered a nice variety from the menu including a lovely roasted squash 'bouchee' with the most delicious pumpkin seed pipian ($7), perfect for sharing. The kale salad was fresh and lemony and I really enjoyed the apple and fennel paired with the dino kale ($11). I'll be copying that one at home! We had the risotto entree with lovely fresh crab, celery root, and black rice ($22). It was creamy and hearty and the black rice gave the dish a nice earthiness. The black cod with butter beans, chanterelles, and broccolini was also super... buttery, perfectly cooked fish with crispy skin and creamy beans ($27). As I said, all the food was really great!  We also enjoyed the house red wine which is 'per ounce/ pay for what you drink', Even if you drink the whole carafe, which we did of course, the price is reasonable for the quality ($27).  Portions were just right, not too small, not too large and I felt priced reasonably for the quality all around.   The weakest part of the meal in my opinion was dessert. I would have really appreciated at least one gluten-free option... at least one! My husband ordered the apple cider beignets with cinnamon brittle ice cream and poached quince. The beignets were not very apple-y at all, really just tasted like sugary fried dough, the ice cream tasted mostly of over-caramelized sugar, but the quince were divine.  Overall, we really enjoyed it and will be back!",

Also, the Pacific halibut was cooked to perfection (probably one of the best I have had in a long time!). The side order of the finger ling potatoes and asparagus salad was a good compliment to our entrees.

And then today, after a childcare mishap, cab failure, and temporary, janky cell phone with a new number, we showed up at 7:00.   Considering that I made the reservation more than 2 months ago, I expected to arrive and discover that our table had been given away to a couple of himbos. Instead, we were warmly greeted as we walked shamefully into the restaurant, fully prepared to have our asses handed to us. There was no, \"SIGH, let us see what we can do,\" or any of the usual bullshit phrases hosts throw at you to make you feel small in their \u00a0hotspot restaurants. And nothing about their warmth was fake. They took our jackets, gave us our choice of a couple of tables, and helped us take the edge off with complimentary beverages to kick off the evening. Jackpot.  Service continued to be excellent throughout the evening, with a number of staff taking care of us. But beyond that, the food was incredible. Bacon beignets, chickpea fritters, gnocchi with morels, shrimp corn chowder, stuffed chicken, pesto polenta, chocolate pot de creme with bing cherries, and brown sugar semifreddo delight of some sort...all phenom. My husband and I shared all but the appetizers (he's allergic to shrimp), and that was the way to go. Not allowing yourself the opportunity to sample a large portion of the menu would be a crime. The ingredients were fresh. The shrimp in the soup was the best I have ever tasted, smoked perfectly as not to overwhelm. And who knew polenta could be that creamy and complex?  I was absolutely shocked to see that the bill for all of this amazing food was only $105. I also thought my husband must have misread that the house wine was $1/ounce. He hadn't.  What a surprise and delight in a neighborhood I'd frankly never consider for fine dining (unless you count Ben and Jerry's on Castro). Bravo!",

And surprisingly reasonable prices (dinner for 2 came out to $115 pre-tip, including about a bottle of wine, dessert, tea - the works!).  If you want a great meal, Frances is a no-brainer. The catch is you need to book 3 months in advance, or hope there's a last-minute cancellation.  The appetizers and sides are so good that we ordered 5, and shared 1 entree. It was the perfect amount of food. We had: 1) Panisse Frites (Chickpea Fritters) - amazing. 2) Grilled beet &amp; avocado salad with Pt. Reyes Mozzarella. Not your average beet salad: all the ingredients were warm with a smoky flavor.  3) Celery root soup (with crab) - Probably my favorite dish, and I'm not a soup person. Whatever the soup is, order it. This soup had the freshest dungeness crab I've had since living in Seattle. 4) Ricotta Gnocchi - simply prepared; what matters with gnocci is that it's fresh, and this tasted like it had been made not just same-day, but to order. 5) Melted Leek &amp; Endive Gratin - Tasty, but I could have skipped this dish. 6) Gulf Speckled Trout (Entree) - Delicious when you ate all the components of this dish; alone the fish was a little on the fishy side, and was very salty. Still really good, but next time I'd probably order the steak after seeing it at the table next to us.  I love the house wine. They blend their own wine, and it is absolutely superb. Our wine was a blend of Barbera and Syrah, 2 of my favorites. I love how you pay $1/ounce, because then you drink exactly the amount of wine you want, and don't need to worry about the wine bottle running out, needing to be finished, etc.  And finally, dessert. The 'Lumberjack' Cake was out of this world - both the fruit cake and the maple ice cream. Because the pastry chef was backed up, they also brought us 2 ice cream sandwiches; the cookie was chocolate, the ice cream was mint, and the mint chocolate combination was perfection.  Even the oolong tea was out of this world.  Love love love this restaurant. San Francisco needs more like this.",

    "review_text": "This review is long overdue, but what spurs me to write it is that I no longer live in the \"area\" and can no longer go to Frances on a whim, which is what I used to do!  I have frequented Frances about 15-20 times over the last 2 years, and I have to say that it is simply my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. \u00a0That is of course my subjective opinion, but I believe it hits the sweet spot of casual, comfort fare that is amazingly prepared and executed and with a bill that doesn't blow the bank. \u00a0The food has been amazing every single time I've eaten dinner there. \u00a0It is one of the most consistent restaurants and dining experiences I've had in the city.  My girlfriend and I often walk-in for the bar seats. \u00a0There are about 10-11 bar seats at the front of the table that are not reserved. \u00a0On the weekdays (except Friday), you can walk-in around 6-6:30 PM and still get a seat for 2. \u00a0Parties of greater than 3 may find it hard to sit at the bar or find a spot together.  As for what to try, I would say the following: I've found the appetizers/pasta more amazing than the main dishes. \u00a0That's not a knock on the main dishes at all, but the appetizers allow you to try more variety and share more experiences among a smaller group. \u00a0Every single one of the soups has been delicious - creamy, flavorful, and expertly prepared. \u00a0The pastas, especially the squid-ink pastas are always great. \u00a0If there is a liver mousse, it is a definite must-try as well - if the amount of toast on the dish isn't sufficient, just ask for more! \u00a0The chef used to have a chicken liver mousse that was simply amazing, but wasn't brought back for awhile. \u00a0Now it looks like the duck liver mousse is back, and I'm so grateful - the mousse is simply to die for - rich, but not overwhelming, with a good complement of the sweetness from the jam to counterpoint the richness/saltiness of the liver.  The entrees I would definitely try are the steak and duck. \u00a0Actually, the entrees have been made even better over time. \u00a0The current steak entree on the menu is better than the one I tasted 2 years ago - it is a staple on the menu, but continues to evolve and get even better, if that's possible.  The dessert to try is the lumberjack cake - it is amazing, as is the in-house ice cream they make. \u00a0Often times my girlfriend and I will just get two scoops of ice cream because we love it so much.  One last note - Frances' food is all about subtlety. \u00a0The flavors are not so in-your-face as to overwhelm your taste buds - which is a GOOD THING. \u00a0With each bite, you can savor the complex flavors that are present - from the meat, the broth/sauce, and the vegetables. \u00a0After eating at many of the top restaurants in SF, for me it hits the spot of excellently prepared and executed food, served in a non-pretentious, casual environment. \u00a0You can tell the attention to detail that the chef has made to each and every dish, to every detail of the service, and to the decor. \u00a0Yet, it doesn't feel stuffy or forced. \u00a0You have to eat here!",

The bread was good (but you have to ask for it)  Tables are way to close. \u00a0Would hate to have to run to the bathroom if your sitting in the middle of the room against the wall. \u00a0They have to pull out the table for you to sit down.  Probably won't be back.",

We ordered MANY things on the menu. \u00a0Nothing disappointed. -smoked bacon beignets - excellent and flavorful -calamari salad - fresh -cucumber salad - light and crispy -charred eggplant - perfection -grilled beets - grilled perfectlly with wonderful spice -lacinato kale salad - my FAVORITE dish of the night as it was absolute perfection  The hubby and friend both had the duck and both thought it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. \u00a0I had the Cassoulet and it was utterly fresh and tasty. Our other friend had the steak and he thought it was excellent.  For dessert we both ordered the Lumberjack Cake which was AMAZING!  If I could get reservations here every weekend - I 'd definitely be here!",

    "review_text": "Simply delicious.   An intimate space with creative, flavorful food. Everything was delicious, but the stand outs were the sun choke soup and chicory salad.   Our server was very attentive; our water glasses never dropped below half-full.   Docked a star because of the tight space. I could hear the annoying chatter of the couples on either side of us. Let's just say they were a wee bit self-absorbed.",

    "review_text": "Overall enjoyed our meal at Frances but wouldn't consider it the highlight meal of our SF trip.  Started off with what appears to be everyones' favourite; Smoked Bacon Beignets. They are all right, they are lovely and delicious.  Thought the appetizers were a great size, not too heavy - Duck Confit salad was very nice. Would highly recommend.  As for the entrees and dessert, I think this is where Frances fell off a bit. While I hate menus with a million things to choose from, the choices of steak, salmon, quail and cassoulet felt limited. Would like to have seen a different selection of proteins, so ended up with the cassoulet, which was nice, but not a standout - my husbands' quail was more successful.  Ordered the profiterole with salted caramel ice cream for dessert. It sounded amazing and I was super excited to try, but unfortunately was not as great as I expected.  Lastly, one thing I loved (and wish most restaurants) would do is their house wine by the ounce, $1/ounce, red or white, and was actually quite good. Great way to shift easily between the wine based on your meal for a great price.",
