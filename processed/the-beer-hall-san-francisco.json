There's a small food menu as well. If you're hungry, the turkey sandwich is pretty good and reasonably priced.   Downside to the place is really just 1) Location (close to twitter / uber offices but not really near anything else) and 2) size. If there are more than 40 people in there it gets a little cramped. There's only one bathroom and only one TV if you're looking to watch a game there. Other than that, it's a pretty good spot to go to, especially if you're in the area.",

The staff and management seem challenged to serve and clean up here as it was literally difficult just to move around the small room. \u00a0But they seemed to take it all in stride. \u00a0FYI, there's no food here so next time, I'm coming here, I'm bringing a pizza.",

The beer selection is something to admire, with an encyclopedic list to tickle whatever palate you've got. We tried a couple sour beers (bottled) and they were Amaze, capital-A. The space is like a more sleek, digitized version of Beer Rev (actually, it has nothing in common with Beer Rev except for all the beer). They seem to be catering more to the polished tech-industry crowd than the hobo-hipster beer geek crowd, but both could appreciate what they're doing. For example, the beer list is on a big TV screen (digitized) and there are black and white movies playing in the bathroom so you could really get comfy while you're on the pot. Brilliant!  This area of SF really needed a quasi-classy watering hole like Beer Hall.

Don't see something you like available on tap? No worries. Beer Hall also has several pages (see: 4-6) of beers that they offer by the bottle as well, sorted either by distributor or by type depending on your fancy. There's also an additional discount if you decide to purchase bottles to take away for later.  The owners and staff are very friendly, always willing to have a chat or offer up a recommendation if you're not sure what you want -- even if you're not sure what you like. They do offer samples/tasters that you can try before you purchase a full glass to hopefully guarantee that you enjoy what it is that you're consuming.  Their bathroom is one of the coolest ones I've ever seen. There's a black and white movie that plays on loop on the wall of Market Street in San Francisco during the early 1900s. It's amazing. It even has a soft music track that goes along with it.  It's simply a cool little venue in an area that's really starting to pick up (what with Twitter being RIGHT THERE and the spiffy new condo/apartment hi-rise that's going up pretty much across the street).

    "review_text": "So this review may be a bit unfair as I came here for a wedding in which the bride and groom closed down the bar and gave us cart blanche with their incredible beer list. Now I haven't been to a candy shop in a while, but damn if those memories didn't come rushing back.  While I may not have paid for any of the drinks, the prices were on full display, and I must admit, being someone who drinks a ton of beer, they were very reasonable. I also have to give a shout out to all of the servers. I probably interacted with each of them that night, and they were all extremely knowledgable, friendly, and helpful when it came to ordering. They know their shit, and it shows.   Now on to what I ordered. I started out with the Upright Brewing Seven, then tried Cascade's The Vine, followed by Upright Brewing Four, went dark for a bit with the Prairie Pirate Bomb before jumping to Hanssens Artisanaal Oude Kriek (none of that is a typo), followed by various drafts. I mean, that's one hell of a list.  If you are serious about beer, this place is a must. I can't wait to make it back.",

Tables fill up the rest of the place.   Liked the spread of beers on tap. They've got about 20 or so. They've got a bunch of bottled beers you can purchase to take home as well. Small selection of bar snacks, but didn't really bother to check them out since I went to eat elsewhere. Service was a bit slow and they got our drinks wrong but we figured it out.   Here's the catch.  A tad bit overpriced as beer aficionados have mentioned. I guess they're pandering to the Twitter and eNEMA folk. Meh.   Still, it's decent spot to drop in for a good brew after slaving away at the office.  P.S. To the techie (_|_)s who laughed at me for taking a photo of my beer with the cool bottlecap wall as my backdrop, go play in traffic.",

The place itself is not so much a hall. It's more like a small lounge. There is only one restroom, which can be problematic when there's a large crowd. Kudos to the looping 1906 Market Street footage though.  Now... onto the beer! They have a great selection on tap. There are easily at least 15 beers on tap in a variety of styles. There is one Beer Hall beer, which is not made in house. It's an ESB made in San Jose, so I guess it's a contract beer. It's still in the evolving stages, but they consistently serve it anyway. All other beers range mostly from $5-8. What's most impressive is their bottled selection. I don't usually ordered bottled beer when there is good stuff on tap, but place literally carries hundreds of beers and some as low as $2.50 per bottle. It'll take me months to get through the list, but you can't blame me for trying.",

Yes, it was recommended by the bartender. Yes, it was delicious.  --Sure, I did move on to the Deschutes Jubelale (nitrogen). Of course--that's a dumb name for a beer, but it is delicious.  --The Lakers/Clippers game was, in fact, playing.  --Brogrammers from Twitter were, in fact, bitching.   Friends, this is good times. Only open until 11:00 p.m., so you can't get into too much trouble. Have I found a new hangout? Yes. Is the location bizarre? Yes. Am I deliriously exhausted from being sick with a random flu the past 5 days? Clearly.
