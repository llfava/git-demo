I've withstood every price increase, portion size decrease, and paid every stupid SF food tax to eat here late nights after my munchies have been activated.  The food is good, yes. The cheesesteak simplistically tasty, and the garlic chili cheese fries being a shoryuken in my mouth.  But sometimes, enough is enough.  I pay SOOOO much to eat here and then I come home to find a garlic chili cheese fries that only fills half the Chinese to-go container? And an inch of cheese on top to mask the kids' meal-esque size portion of the hot potato?  Criminal. Straight Michael Jackson Criminal. Moonwalk over my face after taking my money criminal. Criminale.  Food's good, but the money feels moreso taken away from me ala Tony Soprano.  I'm just emotional right now.",

I first found out about the place on one of those bay area shows on KPIX or KTVU and it sparked my interest as I see myself as somewhat of a cheesesteak connoisseur. Well unlike a lot of the other reviewers here I was sober when I came in at about 6 in the evening starving from skipping lunch. I ordered the large cheesesteak with cheese whiz and made it a combo. The total came out to be about $13 which I thought was a bit much compared to other cheesesteak joints I frequent. The guys behind the counter were friendly and I liked the service. I never rate based on d\u00e9cor since I'm not snooby - as long as there's no bugs or rates crawling around I'm good. Anyways back to the food, since I was the only guy in the restaurant the food came out fast. Well long story short the cheesesteak was disappointing. It wasn't very large, didn't taste all that great (tasted a bit like the greatsteak chain), it was just meh. The fries were skinny cut fries but they were fried pretty well. However I usually expect steak fries at a cheesesteak join. That was another disappointment. All in all I was glad I finally experienced this joint but probably won't return unless I'm fending for cheesesteak at 2 in the morning.",

It doesn't accept credit cards (I should have read the details on it a little bit better!) but come on it's 2012 who doesn't take take credit cards?!  B/c it was so little we decided to order our food to go! I ordered a philly cheesesteak with cheddar &amp; provolone cheese...my bf had a veggie burger! &amp; we ordered a LARGE fries....I was skeptical b/cI like to have my own fries when I questioned the lady will it feed two ppl she said yes! \u00a0We get back to the house and when I opened my wrapper ALL of my cheese was stuck meaning I had a philly steak NOT a philly CHEESE steak!! FIRST DISAPPOINTMENT...  Secondly when my bf pulled the fries out the bag my jaw dropped!! They were greasy, burnt, &amp; soggy!!!! UGGGH!!!!   I ate my \"philly steak\" the bread was tough, the meat was extra chewy, it was cool &amp; again I had NO FREAKING CHEESE!!!  My bf ate his veggie burger and was disappointed!! His words, \"this is a garden patty with rice in it!!! Wtf!?\" (LOL)   We asked the question \"WHAT'S THE HYPE ABOUT THIS PLACE?!   Sorry to everyone that gave this place 5 stars :/ I'm such a picky eater plus my dad is from PHILADELPHIA so I know GOOD philly CHEESE steaks when I have one!!!",

Ketchup, mustard, SPICY mustard, buffalo sauce, some kinda scary sounding stuff called A-1...

Beers are also 2-3 dollars, so if you don't feel like going to a bar, you can just drink here and have some good food.

I came here with a friend, looking for a quick bite to eat for dinner before Santacon. We decided to split a large North Beach style cheesesteak (which comes with peppers, and other veggies) and fries. It was just the right amount of food for the both of us girls. I'm assuming some really hungry men might eat an entire large themselves, but for us it was perfect. Everything tasted amazing, like melt in your mouth good. Even the fries were above average.  The only complaint that I'd have for this place is the time it took for us to actually get our food. We got there at a decently busy time, but those people all cleared out soon after. I think it probably took about 15 minutes for us to get our food, even though there was no one else really waiting for theirs.

I rounded streets of NB a couple of times and couldn't decide what to eat and where to eat that I've never tried before.   Originally, I walked past this joint after looking at their menu which wasn't enticing. But the smell of grilling meat hit me like a freight train and I walked inside to investigate a little more.  Right off the back, I noticed that their menu is pretty simple which isn't a bad thing...So, I narrowed it down to the North Beach Cheese stake and the Chilipehia Cheese stake, which is a Phili... but add chili...  I went with a small Chili and a side of garlic fries... not knowing how much food I ordered.... but might I remind you I was starvin like Marvin!!  But before I could get my hands on this tasty morsel, I was reminded I had to pay CASH ONLY... just like almost every other place in NB... figures... so I walked a couple of blocks to BOA and got my cash and got back...  Long story short, I brought back my order to the office and dug in... sleeves rolled up.... hat turned backwards... so to speak...  Thoughts:  -Bread is chewy -Cheese wiz + chili wasn't too appealing together -Garlic fries was below average.. did you guys buy the fries at Costco?  End Results:  Maybe give it another try.. but the second exp. would have to be stellar for me to remotely think about giving it more than 2 - stars...  P.S.

She also makes their fries and buffalo wings. The main cook was this middle-age dude who was very dedicated to his work. In between cooking cheesesteaks, chopping onions, separating cheese slices and constantly keeping the grill clean (prepping for the late night, post-club/bar rush), he had time to stop by and chat with us.  This is a stop-in-and-eat-quick kind of place, and many people got their orders to-go. Stools and counters are all you'll get. No tables and chairs. Kind of divy when compared to the other places in the area, but variety is good. Located on busy Columbus Ave, and next to many cafes for afterward desserts and coffees.

There's a whirling dervish of a guy, short of stature, at the hot grill making what may be the most satisfying cheese steak sandwiches in the city. I'm no cheese steak connoisseur, but Jamie W. and I like them enough to have come back twice over the last month.   It's just a boomerang counter and a few outdoor tables on the busy Columbus Avenue sidewalk. Their menu is simple - six different cheese steaks, three burgers, two veggie options, and a hot dog. And for Pete's sake, don't forget the big basket of fries for $2.85 (see photo). My favorite is the $8.95 Whole Sub California Cheese Steak, which has the requisite grilled beef and onions but also lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, a heavy slathering of mayo and cheese (see photo).   Now I prefer the melted provolone since it really is more like a grilled sub anyway. Delicious. For a more traditional flavor, there is the $9.15 Mushroom Philly Cheese Steak, which just has the grilled beef and onions plus a pile of mushrooms (see photo). Now this is where the oozy, drippy Cheeze Wiz fits in nicely, damn the preservatives. The fries are more than enough for two. Trust me, the guy does magic with his spatula banging that grill with force and precision. And considering the heavily trafficked location, it surprisingly doesn't get too crowded, goombah!   FOOD - 4 stars...cheese steaks that satisfy  AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...just a no-frills spot  SERVICE - 3 stars...you get it fast and pass the buffalo sauce  TOTAL - 4 stars...beats most of the pasta joints in the 'hood",

On my first visit, the whiz-wit was a delicious assortment of cheese and meat overflowing from the right type of roll. Not sure it was an Amaroso's, but it was just right. Being able to enjoy the steak at the counter and watch the crowds of North Beach walk by is a fun, added benefit. A+  On my second visit, it was all the same, but the roll. Oh how the roll was different! People don't realize how important using a nice, soft sub roll is. French bread or an onion roll -- what I got the second time 'round -- is not correct.

And one of the main reasons I have to go to the gym on a regular basis. It's the california version of a philly cheese. Great cheese, shredded lettuce, tomatoes and that greasygreasy thinly sliced steak. Yummmmmmmm. Their fries aren't half bad either, but the it's the sandwiches I crave after a few beers and I've lost all will power if I'm in the area.

Parking was HORRENDOUS...that is why my friends just got them to go while I double parked somewhere and waited.  Anyways, the food is great! I got the Philly Cheesesteak, it was great. It wasn't like the other philly cheesesteaks where it can be either dry, too cheesy, not enough cheese, it was a perfect blend of cheese, steak, and some zucchini type of sauce thing mixed in it. The bread was good too. Usually for philly cheese steaks you wouldnt want the hard crunchy breads like some places would put, instead it was a very soft dough bread so everything just melts in your mouth.  Haven't had a chance to try any of the other items at Buster's, but I would definitely give it a try some other time.",

I will argue that this spot offers up one of the best cheese steaks in the city, speaking as a person that works in the food industry where cheese steaks are on the menu. The ingredients are always fresh, made to order, and is fast, while maintaining quality. The offer a variety of cheeses for your cheese steak or burgers including cheese whiz. I have introduced this to my friends from out of state and epicurean hubs such as Chicago who described the food as \"fire\" (good).  I also love the fact that I can use my five star reward card every time I order a cheese steak here. \u00a0 For My friends from Modesto this place is an absolute MUST every time they come to visit. I usually order the philly club, but they convinced me to try a provolone and pepperoni version which is incredible. :) \u00a0If you are looking to explore North beach musts Busters should go on your list. Don't forget the fries as well garlic or chili cheese both are incredible",

    "review_text": "In the search for the perfect cheesesteak, I made a quick detour from my plan to have another cappicola sandwich from Giordano's and instead went across the street to Buster's, self proclaimed home of the best cheesesteaks in town.  The small restaurant looks somewhere between a diner and a burger stand - with counter seating, some seats along the window, a register and a soda cooler... which is good - it means the focus is on the food!  The menu is pretty basic: Cheesesteak done two ways: Philly (incorrectly called \"Phili\") with meat, cheese and onions OR California Style (aka a Cheesesteak Hoagie) with lettuce, tomato, mayo and all the typical hoagie fixins. Burgers are also available - including the Buster burger - a burger with a cheesesteak on top.  Buster's gets extra points for offering a few different types of cheese, including the cheesesteak classic - melted Cheez Whiz! For my cheesesteak, I picked a large cheesesteak, Philly style with onions, white american cheese, cherry peppers and mushrooms - easily recognizable for any New Englander as a D'Angelo's Number 9.  How was the cheesesteak? In many ways, better than most in San Francisco. It was nice and moist with a great flavor, though it was a little salty... but I don't mind a little salt, considering every place in town seems to be afraid of a little sodium chloride.  As a cheesesteak purist, I do believe that the only cheesesteak is just that: cheese and steak. In my mind, there's no need to offer a chicken cheesesteak or a pastrami cheesesteak. Call them subs, hoagies or something else, but not a cheesesteak. No points have been deducted over it, but still... CHEESE... STEAK! CHEESESTEAK! Not Cheesy Chicken. Think about it!",

Everything was spot on, right down to the potatoes, toast, coffee and OJ, which certainly tasted fresh-squeezed.  The guy running the place was very efficient and personable enough without going out of his way to lay on a lot of phony \"charm\".  Obviously most people are thinking Italian when they head to North Beach but next time you're in the area and want a good solid breakfast give these guys a try. \u00a0We passed a couple of places along Columbus that offer similar stuff at twice the price, so unless you put a high value on a \"quaint\" ambiance you're better off at a no-nonsense restaurant like Buster's. \u00a0 For that matter they've even got a couple of tables out on the sidewalk so we opted to sit out there and soak up as much North Beach ambiance as we could want!

The line may be long and the staff may have become jaded from dealing with a nonstop parade of douchebag drunks, but after a night bar-hopping in North Beach they can call me a fat asshole all they want, so long as they fork over that white bag packed full of deliciousness wrapped in bread.",

    "review_text": "A story, if you will:  In my San Francisco college infancy (2 years ago) I decided to bike around the city to see where everything was and be a good little San Franciscan. I biked from the Lake Merced area downtown via Portola and Market, saw everything, and said that it would be fun to see Telegraph hill too. I decided to get some food and have my lunch at the top.   I was in Little Italy, and saw this little hole in the wall sandwich place. My kind of place. The pretty girl behind the counter greeted me, and I looked up at the menu and saw the California Cheesesteak. The Philly hinted grilled steak, cheese and onions combined with the Subway-standard-faire crunch, zip and tang of lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and mayo. I got it in short time, spending it watching the tourists enjoy the city on a beautiful day from the large open front window in Buster's.   I then ascended to the top of the hill, navigating a long line of cars looking for the one of 8 or whatever parking spots at the top. I grabbed my sandwich, and saw it glistening in the sunshine. I'm sure someone who wanted to take a picture of Coit tower was dismayed because the reflection off of the melted cheese probably caused a little lens flare.  I took a bite, and wham, bam thank you ma'am, new San Francisco favorite. I can't explain it to you, the combination of deliciousness and awesomeness all contained on a toasted on the outside, slightly chewy inside roll, dripping with grilled onions and steak. All I can tell you is it was phenomenal.   Slight downside: Philly cheesesteaks don't have mayo, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles, where as the aformentioned \"California\" one does. So don't be surprised if, as you're barreling down telegraph hill, a piece of lettuce stuck only on the basis of the viscosity of mayonaise, dislodges from your beard and impales the nearest precariously-parked sedan. You've been warned.",

I have never really been a fan of the artificial cheese sauce, but ended up getting it today. It was good, but next time I'll definitely try the pepperjack cheese; and in addition get more lettuce to add some fresh crispness. Garlic Cheese Fries were also good - the garlicky taste is really strong, so I stuff them in my sandwich to accentuate the greasy goodness. Speaking of greasy, I didn't find my sandwich to be extremely oily. A bit soggy, yes; but not to the point that I felt like I was drinking oil.   The girl who took our order was super-nice. She took our order ahead of time while we left to find an ATM because the one inside was out of order.   This place is a definite must in my list, and totally worth the Muni or bike ride to get there from my place.",

I wasn't optimistic that they'd have anything I'd like but was pleasantly surprised to see TWO vegetarian options on the menu! I can't comment on the veggie patty because no one ordered it, but the tofu sandwich was awesome. They sprinkle it with ginger and serve it piping hot with cheese and vegetables. The sauce selection is mighty (Tapatio, Louisiana hot sauce, garlic sauce, A1 steak sauce, etc.), and the sandwiches were sizable (their Philly cheesesteaks looked pretty good too). I'd definitely come back, whether Giordano Bros. is open or not. Also, the ambiance leaves a little to be desired, but after a few drinks I'm sure you wouldn't even notice.",

By the way....if you get the fries, get the large size (for $1 more, you get twice the fries), so 2 people can share or just have that for the meal. The burger was a juicy medium well and very large for a small sized burger. The back wall tv features pop, r&amp;b, hip hop videos which was nice background noise considering the quiet interior. Plenty of condoments on the counter which is a plus. \u00a0Red Devil Hot Sauce just might replace Crystal or Franks in my fridge.

I heard Sam's fries weren't too great so I decided to check this place out. They are known for their cheesesteak, I refused an pursued on my mission to get my fries. The chili cheese garlic seemed appealing so I ordered it. I was kind of disappointed because I was expecting a crunch but I should have known better that it would be soggy.  Ambiance:  * Parking | Very hard to get parking around the area, especially in the evening. Chinatown is usually available in the evening so you can try that out and walking. * Seating | The place is fairly small and is all bar seating and some against the window. * Feels | Typical on the go feel. It definitely seems like they created a good community and reputation here as they were greeted with warm greetings by visitors. ESPN is usually plying along with some classic rock music.  Food: *Garlic Chili Cheese Fries | I ordered it to go and I was served in a chinese box and the top was smothered in cheese.  Overall:  3.5 stars. The price was good, service was decent, ambiance was ordinary, but the menu was quite basic. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing and their specialty is about the philly cheesesteak. Ultimately it gets the job done.  Advice: * I would recommend this joint for a late night snack.",

I only moved in to the North Beach area about a week ago, and since I, like Ron Swanson, pride myself on being a discerning carnivore, I knew that one of my first priorities would be to find a quality burger place nearby. I turned my trust over to Yelp and was rewarded like always.  I had walked by this place before and noticed that it was about half the price of other places on Columbus, which had me a little puzzled but I made a mental note to check it out later when I knew that eventual late evening burger craving would settle in. Upon studying the menu further I was very tempted to try out one of the many cheesesteak sandwiches, but as luck would have it, I had eaten cheesesteak for lunch and decided to pass (For now, there's a near guarantee I'll be back soon to try one of those)  I decided to go with the mushroom bacon cheeseburger (a brilliant decision that I now rank with deciding to move to San Francisco in the first place). I can't recommend this burger enough. As someone who loves burgers and likes to think he has an experienced and refined palette, it truly is an epicurean delight. It's basically a greasy disheveled pile of beef, mushrooms, cheese and bacon; only vegetarians and obsessive health nuts could resist a little mouth water there (Don't get me started on vegetarians and the errors of their ways)  You're gonna get messy, you're gonna feel slightly rotund afterwards, but dammit you'll enjoy yourself.

I have had those cheesesteaks at Pat's and Gino's in Philly. These are better. And I definitely like Buster's \u00a0more than the cheesesteaks at Jake's in the Marina--no contest.   My boyfriend says that if the male Mexican chef is there, the cheesesteaks are at their best. \u00a0So take note!  Everyone sits at the bar at Buster's, and the atmosphere is best described as a dive. But it's sooo good.",

    "review_text": "I can't believe I've never eaten a cheese steak sandwich before. That might be a stretch...I'm a meat eater, I can't believe I don't remember ever not eating a cheese steak sandwich.   Anyways, the boyfriend and I were in search for food after attending Yelp's Holiday Hangover party. He loves cheese steak sandwiches and knew of one off Broadway (hmmm...coincidence that it's next to the strip clubs, I think not).   After walking around the block a couple times finding a place that would let us use the bathroom without buying a drink (tacky, I know...but I HAD to go), we finally made it to the cheese steak place.   It's your typical hole in the wall kinda restaurant. Tourists probably wouldn't want to stop in and eat there, as there are many swanky Italian restaurants that surround it. But if you're intoxicated and are looking for something to eat after getting motorboated in a strip club, I could see this a very potential choice.  At first, I was going to order a burger. But then I remembered, I liked meat and I'd probably like the cheese steak sandwich. So I decided to order the one with mushrooms and swiss cheese. The boyfriend got the jalapeno one and also a side of garlic fries.  Holy eff, this was so delicious! I can't believe I didn't eat more of these before. This was a good meal to have right before starting my 30-day cleanse!",

    "review_text": "One friend attempting to sit on top of an ATM, then KTFO on the counter while my other friend and I chant, \"WE WANT WINGZZZZZZZ!\" Not only did my friend's bf have to be our eyes for the night (designated beer goggle wipers), he had to \"babysit\" us drunkies. Sorry, B! WELCOME TO OUR WEEKENDS...  On Saturday, 3.19.11, after going to Press Club and 5A5, my friends and I had a ravenous drunken craving for wings specifically Salt &amp; Pepper Wings. With not many nearby options past 2 AM, a simple look on my Yelp App lead us to Buster's (closes at 3 AM).   Located in the centralized Columbus Ave in North Beach's nightlife scene, a lot of drunktards congregate and linger at Buster's for some post partying/stripclub eats. It's a VERY small place with only counter seating for about 10-12 people, so you'll probably have to eat it outside. Fortunately, we lucked out and got seating for four.  FOOD: Sorry, I don't remember the prices but it's higher than what's stated on the online menu. What I do remember was us ordering 2 Philly Cheesesteaks, Wings and Fries which was ~$38 because we got a $1 and some change back.   In all honesty, I was starving and happily buzzed so the food probably tasted better to me than if I was sober.   *PHILLY CHEESE STEAK w/ Jalape\u00f1o, Cheese Whiz &amp; Avocado: GOOD!  The bread was soft and chewy and filled with piping hot thin slices of beef. The beef was well-seasoned and slathered with ooooey goeey salty, creamy and sharp cheese whiz sauce. The plentiful jalapeno added a tangy spiciness while ripe avocado added a layer of creamy butteryness. \u00a0  *BUFFALO WINGS (20 pieces): YUMMY!   Perfectly crisp, meaty and tender, the wings were showered in a buffalo sauce that had the right balance of tang and spice. The accompanying creamy ranch sauce helped to cool off some of the lingering spice.   *GARLIC CHILI CHEESE FRIES: ARTERY CLOGGING GOODNESS!  The skinny fries were fried to a crisp golden brown and lightly tossed in a pungent but not overwhelming garlicky mixture. It was generously topped with beef chili and cheese whiz. The chili was beefy, hearty, and savory and the cheese whiz added creamy richness and tang. The rich combo of crispy fries, garlic with olive oil, chili and cheese would wake up any drunktards taste buds however, not without shooting your blood pressure and cholesterol levels up.  Don't forget to utilize all the bottled sauces: Tapatio Hot Sauce, BBQ Sauce, Tangy BBQ Sauce, Ketchup, Mustard, and Vinegar!  SERVICE: Friendly and good considering there's one cashier and two people manning a grill in hits high traffic establishment. However, it took a while for the food to come out; 10 minutes for our wings, 15 minutes for our philly cheesesteaks and fries.   The two cooks were Rockstars and were really manning the grill, trying to get orders out as fast as they could. It's not an easy job, so I give them the utmost respect. One of them was kind enough to get me a glass of water while he was trying to oversee the grill, so many thanks!  As I look at my Foursqure check-in at Buster's, I can't help but notice I shouted, \"Wings NOT Boobies!\" What exactly was going on in my mind that night/morning is beyond me but I blame it on the \"conspicuous\" name. :X",

    "review_text": "For what it is, it's the best I've ever had. \u00a0A classic cheesesteak done right in a small place that screams working-man's meal; with enough options and variations to keep you interested and coming back.  I'm a regular for lunch and the occasional drunk food. I always get a large north beach with swiss.  The North Beach style with peppers, zuchinni, and spinach sounded like a these-don't-mix situation, until I tried it. The veggies complement the fantastic and traditional swiss on steak taste very well; not too overpowering but fresh and tasty. \u00a0And the vast assortment of sauces on the counter always lets you finish it off with whatever you're in the mood for (buffalo sauce, ketchup, Tapatio, barbeque, mustard, etc.). Despite my persistence with swiss, the vast cheese selection (cheddar, swiss, provolone, cheese wiz, etc.) always helps satisfy the picky eater as well.  As for the traditional elements of the cheesesteak, Buster's hits the nail on the head. The cheese is always expertly melted over all of the meat, the bread is tasty, if not a bit wet with juices. \u00a0The steak is classic philly cheesesteak steak, nothing more, nothing less. The option to substitute chicken is nice to have, but I've never tried it.  Seating and service is what you expect at a hole-in-the-wall style place. Limited bar seating (about 10 stools) with the occasional two or three sidewalk tables outside is usually at least 50% occupied, so not ideal for large groups wanting to sit together, but perfect for a quick meal. \u00a0The cashier is usually friendly and willing to remake sandwiches if the order was wrong. Cash only is a bit of a nuisance, but they have an ATM in the store. \u00a0Sandwiches are made from scratch and usually take about 8 minutes to be served.  I've never felt any more sick after eating here than I generally expect after eating greasy, cheesy food.",

The Scene: Buster's is a great place - no pretenses, just cheesesteaks. They use to serve really bad pizza, but I have noticed that those are gone now. Good move. Everytime I walk in there, they are always playing euro-discoteque music which is pretty awesome, reminds you that you are still in north beach. The place is cramped, but that just adds to the charm - definitely feels like an east coast shop. If you go, I would definitely recommend sitting at the counter - there you can watch a plasma TV and get refills for your drink without having to get up.  The Food: The cheesesteaks are great. Personally I order the California Cheesesteak with provolone, mushrooms and no pickles. Very balanced meal right there. The fries are just okay, but with the plethora of sauces available, they don't need to taste that great anyway. I have tried the burgers there - they are pretty good, however I am hands-down a cheesesteak man.  The Best Part: All the options.

I may have just been a little tipsy, but I was not expecting such an amazing veggie po' boy/sub style sandwich. \u00a0I mean, truly outstanding. \u00a0Besides spinach, cheese, oil, and little cubes of tofu in there, I couldn't tell you what else was in there, but that sandwich was like diving into pure joy. \u00a0Next time, I have to try it sober to see if I just hallucinated it. \u00a0Pure satisfaction only cost $5.50 last night. \u00a0Even the meat-eatin' GF loved it, but I didn't let her have more than one little bite.  Oh yeah, the cheezy fries weren't bad either.  (and I'm usually harsher on North Beach eateries and bars, but I could go to Tosca's and Buster's a few times a week and be a happy man . . . )",

AND (because you know I gotta throw this in), they got some really good garlic fries. This is the best cheesesteak joint in SF hands down. Their cheesesteaks are well seasoned, and they are NEVER skimpy on the meat; which is where the Cheesesteak Shop on Divisadero messed up at because I have mostly been served bread out there, and that's for the birds!

The man in the liquor store around the corner had just gotten me with the classic sign- turn-door-lock combo right in the face, so I was already grumpy when I walked into Buster's.  I was buzzin', cousin, but in need of one last beer to keep me in the zone during the taxi ride home. I stepped to the counter and ordered a beer.   \"No.\" WHAT?! WHY NOT!? The dude tells me that it's too late to serve alcohol. Oh, god no. I furiously point to the clock on the wall behind him, which clearly reads 1:52 AM. He tells me that the clock is wrong.  Before I can dig my cell phone out of my pocket, he pulls his out and shows me that the exact time is 1:58 AM, and unconvincingly explains, \"I cannot sell you a beer this late. I can't.\"   So I slapped my hands flat on the table, straightened my back into an efficient yelling position, and barked at him for the entire time it took to cook my sandwich about how messed up it was to not sell me a beer. Obscenities were included.  Time it took for my friends to go from shocked gigging to embarrassed head shaking: 2 minutes.  I must say, the taste of the california cheese steak with jack cheese and a few squirts of buffalo sauce calmed me down enough to say \"thank you\" as I walked out the door, but I'm still mad at this place.",

I didn't care that much, but the folks working there didn't try to move him along either. So... that might be bothersome for some people. Just saying.  Also, no fountain drinks. Canned soda.

You'll find him walking around in this tiny diner/hot dog stand, asking people softly in his dulcet Italian accent if they're enjoying their food, if there's anything he can get them, getting into lengthy discussions about his latest experiment with spices... for a second my friend and I thought, this weird old guy with his studded leather jacket, he's a North Beach drunk who is aimlessly hitting on everyone. Then we flat out asked him if he worked there... nope, he'sa da friggin owner.  The cheesesteaks are truly his reason to be proud. They're hefty, heavy and ANGUS. The meat is soft, delectable... oops. Did I mention messy? There's a pulldown napkin dispenser there which the owner smartly bolted in the center of the counter for that. Remember to come back next week - he'll come out with another new and stellar food creation by then.  The burgers are amazing. Also Angus. A small at $3.50!! (And by small it's really about a 1/2 lb). Cheese is fitty cents more, and other toppings it starts to be priced more at what it's really worth. The lettuce is bland, pale, shredded iceberg... optimal for the cheesesteaks perhaps, but not on burgers. And the buns are the standard whitebread you find on sale during Super Bowl BBQ grocery season. But who cares, these burgers are friggin good. The owner says that the key is not to rely on fats, and put all faith in spices. If you want your patties well done you better mention that - by default it's scorched on both sides at a total of five minutes, but inside it's deep red, barely bloodless. An island of condiments waits on hand by the napkins... but they sit unneeded.  They have a beautiful large flatscreen overhead that they waste on playing cheaply done music videos of hack \"artiste\" wannabes. It made for irritating dinnertime entertainment.

Traditionalist never, I say again...never ever would order cheese steak with Swiss cheese, but if Swiss cheese was a cause for concern for traditionalists, a cheese steak w/ Swiss and mushrooms or even jalapenos or even chili would probably be considered a death sentence.   At Buster's, you find all kinds of cheese steak combination plus the traditional Cheez Whiz on their sandwiches.   The meat stays crispy despite being juicy and tender it fills a toasted roll and gooey cheese that holds thick slices of mushroom like boats on an oozing sea.   The soft give and earthy flavors of the mushrooms are a nice contrast to the sharp onions, and without the bell peppers there's a balance between subtle and strong. Dive in and don't be afraid of getting messy, any droppings become perfect fodder for a side of fries or better yet garlic fries.   Watching the cook and the cashier is like watching poetry in motion.   The friendly and pretty European cashier works the front, serves $2 domestic and $3 imported beers, cooks the fries and the buffalo wings.   The Latino cook had an organized system cooking the cheese steaks, While cooking he would be chopping onions, separating cheese slices and constantly keeping the grill clean. What was really cool was during his down time he stopped by to check if we liked the food, enjoyed our beer and briefly chat with us about his daily routine.  Furthermore, If people watching is your thang , sit by the glass window and enjoy your view of all the pedestrians walking by \u00a0North Beach.   And FYI they only accept CASH.

I mean they're cheesesteaks dammit! The fact that they're open til 3am in Little Italy/North Beach is a plus. I ended up ordering a North Beach cheesesteak combo while my friend ordered a side of garlic fries. Yup, another plus for having garlic fries.  What I like is how you can see the cook grilling your food while you wait. A side of fries for an extra $2.75 is pretty reasonable to make your meal a combo. Also note that a small size sandwich is roughly like a 6-inch you'd find at Subway. Good enough for me. The sandwich itself was smoking off the grill, and it was quite tasty from start to finish, granted I still had some of that dranky drank in my system. I will say that having spinach and zucchini in my sandwich was rather interesting. Not necessarily in a bad way, but I guess I should have stuck with the OG cheesesteak.   Good alternate place to go for the late night grub. Cash only and no seating booths, just bar stools and counters since this place is rather small. I'd come back again if I'm in the mood for it.",

I can say that I was satisfied. The burger was pretty good. I didn't try their fries or anything, but the meat was pretty tasty.\n  I doubt i'll go here on a regular basis for lunch, but it's good to know that it's a viable option when I'm feeling like a burger without taking the trip out to in-n-out during a workday.

The product is not exactly consistant, it seems to be different every time, even though the grillman seems to be the same guy and the cashier is the one that apparently changes daily. Still, it's damn good stuff with perfect hogie rolls and a plethora of options. Personally I feel extra cheese is necessary, but that could just be me.  I've never bothered with the pizza or burgers (the sign over the door says \"cheesesteaks\", ya know), but the cheesesteaks were well worth the price. The \"garlic fries\" which are made with a lot of lemon pepper seasoning and no garlic were... interesting. I'd stick with the plain ones or skip them alltogether.  [edit] Recently I tried the chili-cheese fries and am sad to say that they are god-awful. Cold canned, gelatinous chili-like substance and luke-warm plastic cheese, exactly like the stuff they make nachos out of at 7-11. The (new, again) girl behind the counter was trying to be nice and gave me a large with extra chili and cheese drowning the poor little shoe-string fries. I say \"trying\" because after I tried it I realized it was really not a nice thing to do. I ate a little of it, became nauseous and threw the rest away. Stick with the cheesesteaks and you'll be fine.  [edit again] After spending my weekend working my ass off for the man, 10 hours a day (usually it's 12.5, so today I got off early!), no breaks, no meals, nothing but hot sweat and forced smiles (god I love the food service industry!), I found myself starving, walking home and really freakin' irritated. Adding insult to injury, everything in my area of town seems to be closed on Sunday night. Even Clown Alley. After hiking all the way up to Buster's (I can't go anywhere nicer - there are grease-stains on my shirt and I'm sticky and disgusting), I decide I'm not in the mood for a cheesesteak and decide to go with the burger. Holy crap! It's good! Really good. Greasy as hell, but man was it delicious! Clown Alley, but you just got your buns handed to you (sorry, my system is still in shock from the influx of protein, carbohydrates and sheer caloric mayhem). I hate to say it, but the meat actually tasted better than Mo's, who grind their meat fresh. Now if only they offered blue cheese like Mo's does... Mmmmm... blue cheese burgers...",

Ya see, I'm a New England gal, and cheese steaks are how we roll. These bitches do it up right. Will be bringing friends here anytime they want a naughty food option.

One of the great things about this place is it's open very late. \u00a0It also happens to be at the bottom of grant right at Columbus so if you're coming out of the row of bars there and stumble down hill you will wind up here. \u00a0Talk about location!

When in Philadelphia don't ask for a Philly Cheesesteak, if you do they'll know you're a tourist. You order it by it's normal name, which is a cheesesteak. Here the cheesesteak is a cheesesteak, nothing so special about it. What Buster's does have that I give it credit for is how they have Cheeze Wiz. That ol' american processed cheese is just the way to go when sinking your teeth into one of these sandwiches.   The downside about this place is the bread that they use (a good cheesesteak sandwich is all about having good bread). The rolls they use here are on the hard side. In Philly it's a little cripsy on the outside but chewy on the inside. Why do I keep referencing Philly? I do because Buster's claims on the banner outside that it has the Best Philly Cheesesteaks or they'll change their name, when in actuality it's just a regular cheesesteak. I think they should just change their name now to Buster's Cheesesteaks with no reference to origin.  Won't say that this place is bad, just not super. If you want a real Philly Cheesesteak you have to go to Philly. My choice in Philly is the original place of where cheesesteaks came from Pat's. There are tons of other big shops in Philly, but the mom and pop shops win out over those.",

Maybe it would have made a difference because the cheesesteak was totally bland. Had zero taste to it. No salt or pepper. My large looked exactly like my partner's small!

It did not turn out to be cheap either. Almost $25 for 2. Good thing I can say is the view was great from the counter. It's small place so we were lucky. And only takes cash.

The aroma was addicting. I loved the crunchy, toasty bun - the ideal way of serving a hot sandwich. However I was slightly disappointed with the sandwich overall. I felt the grilled beef, along with the bell peppers and onions, was too soupy for me. There's a difference between a tender beef and a soupy beef. The juices from the grilled beef soaked the crunchy, toasty that resulted the bottom of the bun to be soggy. I've had better cheese steak sandwiches.",

I'm not sure if it's the juicy meat or the wonderfully diabetes filled cheese sauce, but their sandwiches never cease to make me a satisfied customer.   It's such a perfect little hole in the wall type place. Very small, counter seating and you watch them cook, but I love it. There's nothing fancy about it, order, sit down, people watch and wait for the magic.   I love the run down feel of this place and sitting in this rickety metal stools with the windows open so I'm staring right out into the city. And knowing I'm waiting for amazing food within the next five-ten minutes makes it an even better experience.",

Also had an old menu that listed a food item they no longer provided (chicken parm) and, when I attempted to order it, the person was rude and abrupt.  Got the same attitude in person -- definitely not a place that is known for their customer service. Ordered the standard philly with pepper jack, which was surprisingly dry, The garlic fries were extremely salty -- so much so that my girlfriend had to put them in a strainer and shake them to remove some of the extra seasoning.

Located in the heart of North Beach, it's surrounded by a ton of clubs and bars. If your not inebriated, it's nevertheless likely that everybody else in the place is. Great for fourth meal or a grab and go dinner to take along to one of the nearby bars/clubs that doesn't serve food. Very small, a few seats along the window, a few at the counter, think take out. Frizzled beef, grilled onions, and Cheez Whiz on a soft roll. A great compliment to your favorite libation.",

    "review_text": "Absolutely THE BEST Philly cheese steak that I have ever tasted.  My girlfriends and I normally travel from SJ to SF just to eat at this place. \u00a0I normally order the LARGE Philly cheese steak w/ pepper jack cheese, onions, jalapenos, mushrooms, and barbecue sauce sauteed in the meat. \u00a0They used to cook it in the meat, but now they just squirt the sauce on top. \u00a0If you want it cooked in the meat now, you have to specifically ask them to do it. \u00a0  You can not eat it right away because it is SO freakin hot, but then if you wait too long it gets soggy. \u00a0I personally don't like eating it while its hot. \u00a0I normally take it home and bake it in the oven at 350 degrees so that it will be nice and crispy; it is no longer soggy once you bake it. \u00a0The best way to eat it is actually after you bake it (or pop it in a toaster oven), it tastes so much better, and you can refrigerate the other half for later :).  Trust me when I tell you that baking it is 10x better than eating it while at the restaraunt.   I also order their garlic cheese fries, which are to die for, but only if you love garlic. \u00a0 They come with nacho cheese sauce on them, but if you don't like soggy food, have them give it to you on the side rather than on top.  Their customer service isn't always great, but I only go for their food, NOT to make friends. \u00a0The cook seems pretty nice, and just does what he is told. \u00a0So when I leave a fat tip, its primarily for the cook, but I don't know if he even gets any of it since the tips go in a big container :(.  If you are in SF and you love cheese steaks, YOU MUST STOP AT THIS PLACE!!  The parking is a pain because its in a popular area, but well worth circling around for.  It is a hole in the wall, in a bright yellow building, so keep your eyes peeled for it when your on Columbus.  #Lifetime customer",

I've walked past this place countless times in the past year thinking I couldn't eat here because I'm a vegetarian. Boy, was I wrong. One night I stopped in for fries. I decided to try their garlic fries which were terribly saturated in oil and just under $4 for a small, but that's another story. It was that night, however, that I noticed they had a few vegetarian options on their menu... What a nice surprise!  So tonight I decided to go there to try their Tofu Sandwich. I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I was hopeful that it would be good. I wasn't disappointed. I got the Tofu Sandwich with provolone cheese, grilled onions and zucchini, guacamole, and a side of fries. I was blown away. This is the closest approximation to a real cheese steak that I have tasted since I have become vegetarian. It definitely hit the spot.  This place is open until about 2 PM every night and 3 PM on weekends, so it's definitely going to be my late-night go-to spot from now on. The guy who works there looks a bit surly but he's actually quite nice and willing to strike up a conversation. They've got a TV here, too. The only downside is that they're cash only, but that's just about every other place in this city, so I can't fault them on that.  5 stars",

Hell, even someone commented that my picture, which shows some tasty macro-focused jalapenos is \"not good, not good at all!\" But you know what? I don't care. Because the steak is juicy, the cheez whiz is thick and just absolutely spectacular at palpable artery clogging. I mean, when you can actually feel your arteries being clogged while you eat, it's a good thing.   They have some other variations with different combinations of vegetables and onions, and they have five or so cheeses to choose from. Add that to the number of hot sauces on the counter (buffalo, frank's red hot, tabasco, crystal, hot garlic, barbecue), and you can customize your cheese steak exactly how you want.

Lacking an intersection, we were not sure our magical cab ride would bring us to this desired destination. Lucky for us, our magical cab driver provided us with a cab driver reference book which includes almost every food/alcohol joint in the city. Columbus and Vallejo here we come!   Unsure of myself I ordered a California Cheese steak. To which my friendly server asked me, \"How are you soo gorgeous?\" How do you answer that question? With a simple, I got lucky? Or maybe, You can thank my parents...   Back to the sandwich...Oh... DEAR. It rocked my late night tummy's world! A small is about 8 inches I would say. I cannot even imagine a large. (ha.. that's what SHE said!)   I soon realized that I would need some water to wash down the heavenly steak... My biggest fan Mr Server gave me a free bottle of water...

Luckily after about 3 rounds driving around, we got lucky with parking right on the corner!  Philly cheesesteaks IMO are more or less all the same. OK meat with OK bread which makes out to be an OK sandwich...but I have to say Buster's is above par. Their meat wasn't chewy and soft to eat. The onions and provolone melted into the sandwich perfectly with my added jalapenos. A small sandwich and garlic cheese fries fed the SO and I to our satisfaction. The fries come in a pretty hefty portion for being under $5!  Would definitely come here again! Do I dare and get chili cheese garlic fries next? Open late too! +++ Oh, and any place that carries a large variety of condiments is good in my book. They had A1, BBQ, mustard, tapatio, buffalo, and a few other sauces. Yum!",

Me and my friend ordered a BLT cheesesteak with jalapenos.  The servings are rather large. We could barely finish one order of fries and a cheesteak, plus we're big eaters too! I'm a huge fan of cheesesteaks and they make it fresh and with real ingredients, no cheese out of the bottle stuff here! You also have a huge variety of sauces and condiments to choose from here! The wait is long, but good food takes time, the service is great as well I definitely recommend coming here!",

You have to like greasy (these burgers are fried, not char-broiled or anything), but if you do, you'll love Busters' chopped beef burgers. A small is one full-size patty (nothing small about it), a double is two patties, same size. Your choice of cheese, and the toppings are always fresh and good. Good fries, fast service, and if you're lucky enough to score one of the two tables outside, the view on Columbus is great.",

The cheesesteaks here sure are good, and they are made right in front of you. The garlic fries are a perfect supplement to the cheesesteak, and the prices don't hurt either. I've gone here many a time, and every single time Buster's has not failed me.   Tips and Pointers: -Get's crowded when the bar scene lets out -Prices are cheap -Parking is non-existent -Garlic fries and cheesesteak are amazing -Seating is limited  [APPROVED]",

I mean they are so stingy at this place with the CHEESE which is supposed to be the feature highlight in these cheesesteaks...these people need a lesson from the folks on Divisadero..yeah try one of those, its the real deal closest you can get outside of Philly, Amoroso bread rolls and all. I remember when this place in North Beach used to be sort of authentic when it was the So. Philly Cheeseteak shop back in the day and they were still not as great as the one on Divisadero St but was ok in a pinch...now this place kinda sucks and only works if you are super drunk and desperate to fill your gut. I mean I've been here a few times because it's what's open late besides a pizza slice and without fail I have to order a side of cheese \"whiz\" fries just to dip the sandwich in to give the dry meat and bread some tenderness \"yeah ya know wat I mean\"?!! Geez c'mon guys stop being so cost pinching on the cheese it's why you get only 2 stars and only 2 because you are quick, I get to meet cool characters inside while I wait every time and can find a cold can of Coke to dissolve that heap of dry meat and bread that wants to sit and rot in my stomach overnight! Yuck...why do I do this to myself STELLA?",

Their cheesesteaks are really juicy and they dont skimp on the meat. Best one i think is the cheese and mushroom one. Their burgers are on point too, that 1/2 pound burger cooked to the way you like it?! medium well please. Plus all those tasty sauces they provide you on the counter to make it even better? thats a double plus!  last but not least, those garlic fries with the cheddar cheeeeesy sawwwwse! It's some of the best combined concoction! Def so good if you're entoxicated after a night out of drinking too in north beach",

There's limited seating, so you want to snag a place to sit when you're drunk off your ass at 2am and need some greasy fare to soak up the inordinate amounts of alcohol in your system. What should you eat? Easy. Get the classic cheesesteak. It's large, greasy, and salty. It will absolutely hit the spot. And, take your pick of the 4 or 5 different sauces they have on hand to make it even better. You can see everyone working in the back and sauteing everything on the greasy flat-top in the back, and it only makes you even hungrier. They sell an arrangement of other things, such as burgers and fries (definitely recommend the garlic fries; also a great item to down when drunk because of its salty, garlicky tones). If you spring for the burger, you won't be disappointed either. Honestly, their veggie patty burger is ridiculously good as well. Maybe it's the toasted flatbread accompanied by the soft interior, or maybe it's just because your food arrives so quickly that you don't even remember sitting down and ordering, but Buster's will always put a smile on your face. And, it's dirt cheap!",

So I take them to Buster's for a cheap, fresh, greasy and authentic Philly Cheese Steak. I loved it, my friends loved it, even Buster's loved it too.   They run a great business here. The owner is extremely nice and genuine, making sure that his customers are happy and are getting exactly what we want. Also, nothing here is frozen. Just fresh!  Take notes Burgermeister.
