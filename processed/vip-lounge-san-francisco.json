Often times there is no place to take a moment to catch one's breath when Christmas shopping. The lounge is in oasis in the shopping/downtown district. Thanks Chase!",

    "review_text": "I traveled a lot and visited the airport lounges from United and Star Alliance over the US and in different countries. \u00a0The airport lounges outside the US are way better and everyone knows that. \u00a0Today, I was on the way to M.Y. China then I saw this VIP lounge. \u00a0I used my Chase United Club credit card to get in. \u00a0To my surprise, it's not bad at all. \u00a0The lounge equips 3 to 4 commercial Keurig coffee machines with assorted K-Cups. \u00a0There were cookies, chips, soda and water. \u00a0Well, from my opinion, it's better than the United lounges in the domestic airports. \u00a0Well, so it's called the VIP lounge. \u00a0I didn't shop today so I didn't take advantage of the free-gift-wrapping. \u00a0The problem, as I see, is that it's a little bit crowded. \u00a0I was there around 3:30 pm during a weekday and there were quite some people in the lounge. \u00a0I hope that this lounge can keep the quality of offers and services.",

    "review_text": "What's not to like about the Chase United VIP Lounge? It's open during the holiday season and closes on Christmas Eve. They have done it for the past 3 years. It's located under the dome on the 4th floor of the Westfield mall.  With your Chase United card, you can bring in 3 guests with you. Once inside, there's free coffee, tea, hot apple cider, and hot cocoa. There's also coolers with bottled water and soft drinks that are help-yourself.  There's also complimentary fruit and in the morning, they have muffins and croissants. In the afternoon, there's cookies and brownies and the cookies are delicious. In 2014, they were from Bristol Farms downstairs in the Westfield Mall. There's also chips and pretzels for the taking.  Also, there's free gift wrapping. Bring any present (it doesn't have to be purchased in the mall or anything), and they'll wrap it for you very prettily. If they're not swamped with people (like on weekends), they'll go all out and do really fancy, beautiful bows of ribbons. They have several selections of wrapping papers and ribbon, so you can customize your wrap job.  There's also free WiFi, but it's pretty wonky; it goes in and out a lot, so don't expect to start co-working here. I did try that in 2013, and found out the hard way that the internet is unreliable.  There's comfy chairs, and in 2014, they even added a bunch of big screen TVs. It's a pretty cozy place to take a load off and unwind a bit after holiday shopping.  Also, a few select dates during the season (usually on Tuesdays), if you bring an unwrapped toy donation (value of $20 or more), they'll give you a free pass to get into the United Lounge.   The only thing better is if they added a free boozy happy hour, but we can't have it all. :)",

Can you really eat the sweets, the chips, the bananas, the apples, drink the coffee, tea, sodas and the water while you're sitting in the lounge?  They've got Keurig \u00a0one coffee cup serving machines again. \u00a0But irregardless of which coffee flavor pod you select, the coffee dispensed tastes like hazelnut flavor. \u00a0I didn't try the tea but I bet that tastes like hazelnut too.",

    "review_text": "Some of the personnel are nice and friendly but most are rude, abrasive, and makes the lounge unwelcoming. \u00a0The management here is dreadful, they lack respect and courtesy; they treat visitors as if it was a privilege for them to be inside the VIP Lounge. \u00a0I've said \"hi\" on multiple visits to the managers who walk by and I was ignored, I've asked a couple questions to different managers and they reacted as if I was bothering them. \u00a0It's awful and the rules are very inconsistent, it's different for each person. \u00a0My Caucasian friends get better treatment less harassment versus I, who gets ID'd and questioned each visit. \u00a0I like the lounge amenities and the free gift wrap it's just best to be independent and not ask for help. \u00a0The gift wrappers are nice they keep to themselves and it gets busy for them, I usually drop off my gifts and return later for them. \u00a0This is probably the only part of the lounge with decent customer service unless there's a manager involved then it gets chaotic and things become disorganized and I hear \"No\" flying around. \u00a0No you can't ask for tissue paper for inside a gift box, it's only for gift bags. \u00a0\"No\", you get get a different ribbon and here I thought managers were supposed to problem solve, not create problems.  \u00a0 For the Toys for Tots Toy Drive, they treat this like it's a gift for visitors who want to donate toys. \u00a0They critique each toy and depending on the person bringing in the toys, some get denied. \u00a0Some are asked for proof and receipts while some are just given the United Club passes. \u00a0There's a sense of some discrimination that goes on here. \u00a0The rules are very subjective depending on the worker. \u00a0It's not very customer service oriented. \u00a0I've communicated this Rob Tacey who handles Public Relations for Chase. \u00a0If you \u00a0have issues please email to <a href=\"mailto:rob.tacey@chase.com\">rob.tacey@chase.com</a> so he can be better \u00a0informed on the performance of this lounge.",

Snacks are plentiful. There are TVs and free wi-fi. Just like an airport lounge! \u00a0But there's more. \u00a0Free giftwrapping (perfect since I HATE giftwrapping). \u00a0But the best is Toys for Tots Tuesday. \u00a0Bring a toy on Tuesday and show your Chase United card. \u00a0The Marines get a toy to distribute and you get two passes for the United Club. \u00a0Score. \u00a0I'll second what Joanna T says. \u00a0Membership DOES have its privileges.",

    "review_text": "This review is for the Chase United VIP Lounge located on the top floor of Westfield San Francisco Centre, just underneath the dome. \u00a0The lounge was open from November 23 to December 24, 2013. \u00a0We visited two days ago on Christmas Eve, the final day.  Considering I didn't know this place even existed, it was quite a pleasant surprise after a long day of shopping. \u00a0I'm a Chase United Visa credit cardholder and the card got me and family members access to the lounge. \u00a0I should read the benefits of my card more often. \u00a0I'm only in it for the miles. \u00a0Apparently, there were a lot of other Chase United cardholders at Westfield on that night because the lounge was slammed. \u00a0I guess it makes sense since San Francisco is a hub for United. \u00a0I'm from Atlanta where United has a small presence.  The lounge was much like an airport lounge. \u00a0Everything was complimentary. \u00a0There was cafe-style seating, TVs, a fridge with sodas and bottled water, a staff member giving out muffins, basketfuls of snacks (apples, pretzels, etc.), and multiple Keurig coffee-making machines. \u00a0There was also free, fast Wi-Fi.  Two features which were particularly useful inside a shopping mall during holiday season were the complimentary bag and coat check (a great place to leave shopping bags and continue shopping) and complimentary gift wrapping -- perfect for someone like me who isn't great at wrapping presents. \u00a0There was a limit of 2 gift-wraps per cardholder.  Freebies were offered for checking into the lounge via Facebook. \u00a0The freebies were iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 cases and nice sunglass pouches. \u00a0Now those are freebies worth checking in for.  The lounge was well stocked with snacks and refreshments and it was also well staffed. \u00a0All of the staff I interacted with were friendly and helpful.  The only downside to the lounge was the sole unisex restroom. \u00a0It was clean, but the lounge should have more restrooms.  Overall, I was pretty pleased with the Chase United VIP Lounge. \u00a0They need to do these more often!",
