The staff is awesome (big shout-out to Hooks), they make a mean Cosmo, random \"famous\" people are always there (sports people, crazy reality show \"stars\"), you can always meet new people (their quality is questionable however), and no one cares if you're wild and crazy and silly.

There were various college football games on TV saturday night including Cal, but UW was on one of the other TVs. The bartender was very happy to change one of the TVs in order to get the game on a TV where we could sit and watch the game.  The bar was pretty cool. Not too nice, but not too bad either. There was the main bar, then some tall tables and chairs with another room that had a few booths and a pool table in the middle with about 6 flat screens.   Great experience! I had someone yell \"Washington! Boo!\", but that's part of the fun of a sports bar. The bartender even introduced himself to me later and said that anytime I come in, he'll have the game on. Too bad I don't live in SF, or I'd be here for every Husky game. He even came by later when we made a good play and gave me the fist. \u00a0A fun bar that I'll definitely be hitting up when I'm in the city!",

I suppose this was because it was Sunday afternoon and the local sports teams had been eliminated from competition, so that reduced the number of folks inside. In turn, we had a really great table against the wall, offering a great view of the TVs, with easy access to the bar. Score.  The location of this place is also a plus, as it is close to numerous pizza joints. This meant I was able to run out, grab a pie for my friends, and enjoy it at the bar. Nobody working there said anything, which is also nice. Pizza and beer at a bar with big screen TVs. Win.  Drinks were reasonable, but I don't like the $20 minimum credit charge.

I don't have a personal connection to the cause so raising $2500 was a difficult task. I called the place and got in touch with the owner. He was super friendly to assist me and make sure he gave me tons of help and resources to make my event night successful!  On the day of the fundraiser the staff was super friendly and helpful, they even provided me with a money box and raffle tickets to use during my fundraiser! I had a lot of fun and had even more fun later watching my friends hustle random drunk dudes for $10 for my fundraiser so they could get $2.50 pints!

It's a North Beach bar without the annoying bro's (didn't mean to offend anyone). There is always a friendly, laid back, knowledgeable sports crowd there. They have a pool table in the back.

A divey atmosphere with spectacular service and a friendly crowd to boot. \u00a0The most popular tip I've read about this place was that it has free pool (one pool table) and free popcorn (you'll know when it's time for that). \u00a0This review will only recognize the Saturday festivities during football season when this establishment gets turned into a purple and gold affair. \u00a0Here's the magical part that will make even the biggest non-LSU and non-football fan a believer in Saturday as the new Funday: $3 domestics, $4 Blue Moon draft; $3 Tiger Claw (a shot consisting of vodka, cranberry &amp; razz-ma-tazz), $4 Abita Amber, $4 Abita Purple Haze. \u00a0My boyfriend and I drank for the entire LSU/Kent St. game for a whopping $40! \u00a0That's 3 hours of back-to-back brewskies into the empty abyss known as our guts. \u00a0An added loveliness, perhaps highlight to some, of Saturdays at Northstar is the appearance of Family Meal, a splendidly appetizing pop-up that does only bar food. \u00a0On Saturdays they bring out the southern hospitality as well as the culinary crafts of home town cooking to make you want to wrestle alligators while slurping down a dozen oysters. \u00a0These reminiscent dishes range from traditional red beans and rice, shrimp and okra gumbo, New Orleans style BBQ shrimp, bread pudding and more. \u00a0They update their twitter with locations and menu items for your perusing. \u00a0  As much as I'm boasting about Northstar as my alma mater's stomping grounds, they also cater and welcome other teams and schools. \u00a0This is SF, so all your Cali teams are represented appropriately. \u00a0But, bear your purple and gold pride and you'll open your Saturdays to a life of worthwhile camaraderie. \u00a0#AllNewFriends. \u00a0Come experience some great football, great food and great service. \u00a0Don't be a Debbie Downer.  Side Note: Slowly solidifying Ryan L.'s (a Texan, born and bred - important if you know about the ongoing Texas/Louisiana battle of the football beasts) love for me and the Tigers, thanks to Northstar's sensationally spectacular Saturdays. \u00a0Deuces.",

If you're a rum drinker, I do NOT recommend their well rum choice. It was disgusting. I had never even heard of it and it didn't even taste like rum.   We've had some nice times here though, all during the day. Again, at night, especially if there is any game on, it just gets way too loud and packed with screaming people. So if you're not there to watch sports I wouldn't recommend it.",

Like most places in San Francisco, this place has friendly bartenders and good happy hour deals (3 dollar drafts). Throw in free billiards and popcorn and you have a spot that's not that bad to get together at. Don't count on sitting down but the opening area is large enough to stand and hang out comfortably. Could see this place getting three and a half stars but it caters to Cal fans, so I round down in that case (not really... but seriously)",

You get genuine, real, people. And that's why I love it here. You can go straight from the office, or in jeans and a tshirt and no one really cares, but its always a really good time.  Another huge plus about Northstar, the owner Mark is always willing to support local charities and goes out of his way to make each event successful. Not only does he open his bar up for you to collect donations, he encourages everyone to participate in the fundraiser.  Mark is truly an amazing guy and I am so thankful to have an awesome bar in the neighborhood. Good people, good drinks and hot guys. (That's really why I love Northstar) Plus they have hot fresh popcorn, sports games on TV, and hot guys.  Cheers! and many thanks Northstar!",

They move the pool table in the back (and cover it nicely so drunk girls can dance on top of it when feeling up for the challenge) and pull out the giant speakers. The DJ this particular night graced us with \"I'm on a boat\" not once, but twice (If I hadn't been present the entire evening this replay would not have been an issue).   The crowd was great, a couple guys came up and danced with my girlfriends and I and they were so much fun (not those creepy I wanna be on you guys that you tend to find at a dance club).

By the time you reach the end of this counter, it's time to order beverage number two from your friendly bartender.

The music they play is a good selection, last night they played pretty much every song on the Cure's \"Disintegration\" cd, and it just set the mood, such a great album. Nothing's better than being at a bar and noticing that others around you are enjoying the music, too.   Later, those same people kept it going on the dancefloor in back to the beats dropped by one of the resident DJs.   Minus one star for my experience here on St Patty's day, it was just too packed.

Learned what an Irish Drinking Cow is. Apparently if you carry around a Irish Drinking Cow, you (and anyone else the drinking cow blesses) will be hangover free the next morning. It worked. I felt amazing the next morning. Plus it's an awesome drinking game where you can throw a cow on the ground.  4. Saw a guy carrying around a bottle of wine. I don't know why I like this, but I do.  5. Co-Dominated the pool table with a friend for 4 rounds of pool. We both suck at pool, but something about the Northstar Cafe environment made us awesome.

I first heard about this place from a friend when I began my fundraising for Team in Training. I was so overwhelmed and didn't really know what to do or how to raise the $2100 I had promised to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Prior to calling Northstar I had just had a Happy Hour at a newly opened cupcake shop. At the cupcake shop fundraiser we packed in about 50 people and everyone was drinking, eating, and ordering up a storm. I was guessing by the sheer numbers (even the owner said that they hadn't had that many people in the shop since they had opened, which was months ago). that I would get a hefty donation. Not so much. They gave me $50 and called it a day. Super disappointing! So, I gave Northstar a call and set up a Happy Hour. In four hours I raised a couple hundred dollars. It was AMAZING, especially since I only really had about 10 of my guests show up. I couldn't be happier with Northstar and will always give them my business and refer them to anyone looking for a great spot to hang out and have a beer (esp fundraisers!!!)",

I'm not sure exactly what it is but I love a night out watching sports and chatting in a San Fran dive bar better than most other activities... and I'm pretty girly &amp; non-divey when it comes to most of my life!  A friend recommended this place as a good venue for watching games and possibly being able to tune into big matches from home (I'm Australian - it's really hard to find bars willing to show sport from that side of the Pacific!).... then I found out about the free popcorn. The rest is history!  Really good bar to relax, chat with a friend and have a few drinks. It's not bad for people-watching too!

This is a solid dive bar on the edge of Chinatown with a friendly, local atmosphere. I definitely feel like I've been to similar in New York and elsewhere in the city.  The bar had a decent selection of California craft beers, a Jager and Fireball machine, and some solid Scotch selections. Plenty of TVs were playing the Giants and the Golf game, and the awesome British bartender was providing hilarious color commentary. Actually coming on a lazy Sunday to hear this guy in a cup match would be worth the trip alone.  Sadly we only came in for a pint, but looking around they definitely favor their patrons - along the walls are \"Customer of the Month\" signs, which is a great touch.",

Though, i have been here on a weekend afternoon and had coffee as my beverage of choice, but that really isn't a typical northstar outing in my book. I come for the great vibe, jukebox selection, pool table and popcorn. The bartenders are great, and the whole bar is just a fun place to come before or after anything, or on a 'just because' kind of night. I love this bar, definitely a favorite.",
