Great art and a clean and comfortable modern sapce. It has to be the most beautiful hotel in the city. I met a client for lunch at One Up and we dined in the bar area. The place is a hidden gem! The food was fresh, creative and modern (am I really eating in a hotel?). Great cocktails and wine list. I had a glass of the Gun Bun Pinot which was excellent. Jaime was our server / bartender. He was very attentive with a great personality. The manager Josh stopped by to check in to make sure everything was to our liking. All and all the food, drinks and service were spot on! There are not alot of top tier places to entertain for lunch around Union Square so I will be back with more clients!",

I ordered their seasonal watermelon salad as well as the halibut.  The watermelon salad was extremely flavorful and fresh. The crisp of the watermelon paired with their light balsamic accent - was the perfect way to start a meal. It was definitely a seasonal dish and was evident in each bite.  My halibut was also delicious. It was buttery and the lemon brought out it's richness. I finished each morsel of it.  My only hesitation with OneUP is that they don't seem to be very consistent. My step-mom's soup was luke-warm and her salmon seemed a little dry. Also the service, though friendly - weren't very present throughout the meal - despite the place being slow. At the end of the meal \u00a0- I inquired in regards to their larger group capabilities and the staff also weren't very helpful.   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at OneUP - but if you're staying at the hotel - or are looking for a decent meal in the area - it's definitely a solid contender. Their bar area is also quite formidable and worth checking out.  Trust.",

The taste was actually pretty bland and one forgot quickly there was any garlic in these little bites at all. \u00a0Shame. \u00a0I think you could say, poor finish. \u00a0Still hungry, we opted for the meatballs. \u00a0Two to be precise, for 12 bucks. \u00a0Yikes. \u00a0They were very dense and a little void of flavor, however the tomato sauce which accompanied them was a nice rich flavorful pairing. \u00a0One item of note, apparently we had arrived between shift change and the meatballs took a little while to get to us. \u00a0The bartender mentioned that to us and comped us a round for waiting. \u00a0This was quite unexpected. \u00a0A very nice gesture. \u00a0The menu for the lounge was limited, but there were several offerings of some flat bread which looked intriguing if we find our way back there. \u00a0If you are a local Yelper, you get a 20% discount for checking in on the Yelp mobile app.",

I wish I can rate this place higher but the food was really bad in my opinion. \u00a0  I ordered:  Mushroom, caramelized onion, blue cheese flatbread - the flat bread was stale, too much blue cheese that overpowered the caramelized onion and mushroom, made it salty as well. \u00a0Overall the proportions were off. \u00a0I tried to finish just the caramelized onion and the mushroom on the flat bread and left the flatbread on the plate. \u00a0I did not enjoy this entr\u00e9e at all.  Pork belly - wow! \u00a0It was surprisingly disappointing. The pork belly slices were fried and dried, very chewy with excessive sweet and sour kind of BBQ sauce. \u00a0Aweful! \u00a0I liked the pickled mustard. \u00a0This dish reminded me Panda Express.  House Nuts - was considering ordering dessert but was afraid it will disappoint me more therefore ordered house nuts to compliment my martini. \u00a0Wow, even their house nuts disappointed me. \u00a0I had to forced myself to eat them to balance the alcohol so I wouldn't get drunk but they were horrible! \u00a0They were stale and with certain kind of taste that's not tasty nor fresh. \u00a0I didn't finish it. \u00a0I miss Waterbar's roasted pecans and Big 4's roasted nuts!  the drinks were fine - I had Chardonnay and vodka martini. \u00a0they were fine.  The service was wonderful! \u00a0Starting from the host stand when I entered, the two hosts said hi and welcomed me. \u00a0Then I walked through the hallway to get to the lounge, a few staffs said hi. \u00a0I asked the bartenders where the live music will be, they kindly informed. \u00a0They were attentive as well. \u00a0They immediately asked me if they could help me. \u00a0My Asian waitress and an Indian waiter were both very attentive and helpful. \u00a0I enjoyed the service at OneUp. \u00a0I wish the food can be better. \u00a0  I like the newly renovated interior and ambiance. \u00a0I would go back for drinks but NEVER ever again for food unless they improve.",

Dark woods, modern lines, and bold furniture pieces make One Up a great place to have a relaxing meal.  Local comfort food with a flair is how I would describe the menu.  Went here for dine about town and a second time when they added the ramen burger on the menu.  The dine about town meal blew me away in value. They offered three courses for 17 bucks. It's typically just two courses for that price. I had the Lamb Burger with their tomato soup and chocolate dessert. I love lamb and try to order it when ever available on a menu. Perfectly cooked, cute vegetable garnishes, and crispy thin fries. The tomato soup was also delicious. It looked fancy and had a nice spice to it.   The Ramen burger is the talk of the town and One up is your opportunity to try it. Like the other reviews below the Ramen doesn't add anything special to the flavor of the dish. The meat itself is seasoned and cooked very well and is the star of the meal. Overall still a good burger. The special sauce and fried egg were a nice too. It's just disappointing that the ramen itself doesn't shine which makes you feel like it's all very novelty.   Great service, Love the decor, love the drinks, and yes... the bathroom is pretty nice too. It's a great spot for a late lunch after shopping in Union Square all day. Give it a try.",

    "review_text": "I'm not gonna lie, the boyfriend and I came to check this place out following this ramen burger hype that's been going around ever since we first learned about the new food fad that started in New York. The thing is, based on this one ramen burger alone, I can't say I'd give the food very high ratings. The burger itself is on the sweet side, which already I find slightly strange. Then you supposedly have this bacon and cheese on top, which for some reason, I could barely taste. Also, overcooked sunny-side up egg? Not really cool but at least the texture of the egg wasn't rubbery. The buns made of ramen were easier to eat than i'd anticipated, a slight crunch on the outside but nice and soft and chewy on the inside. I supposed I wasn't sure what to expect so I wasn't really as upset with the burger as most people seemed to be, because in my head I didn't even know if I should compare it to flavors of ramen or flavors of a burger. If it had gone more towards either direction, I don't know that I would have liked it more anyways. I think this is one of those \"it seemed like a good idea at the time...\" things. On the upside, the fries were delicious, light, perfect crispness and saltiness. We chowed those down like we were snacking on chips.   Service here is excellent as well. All the staff seems very friendly and non-judgmental (the restaurant is located inside a pristine hotel after all) The ambiance is great, very relaxed and comfortable and quiet with light music playing in the background. The bar area seems very classy as well. I'd probably come back to hang out at the bar some time, as for the food, I could take it or leave it. It's probably pricier than some places for sure. All in all, service is great, ramen burger, it's not on the menu anymore but don't sweat it, you're not missing out on much.",

My friend and I met up here for after dinner drinks and dessert the eve of the Nike Women's Half Marathon, but I could not order a glass of wine or a cocktail. \u00a0I didn't want to drink the night before our big race, especially since I did not train very much for it. I had to settle for Perrier. :(  My friend ordered the Vanilla Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and I ordered the Fruit Crisp. \u00a0She said the Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was a little boring. \u00a0I was not able to try it because I was avoiding dairy products too. The fruit crisp was good. \u00a0A piece of browned and melted marshmallow was on top of the crisp. Thankfully, the nectarine slices weren't mushy.   We did go back to eat at the main restaurant, not the lounge/bar, after checking out of the hotel after our race and we had better food there. I needed coffee very badly after a night of fitful sleep and 4 hours of running and walking the NWHM. \u00a0Unfortunately, the coffee is your typical bitter coffee. There are so many good roasters in SF (Blue Bottle, Four Barrel, etc) and this being a nice hotel, you'd think they'd be more thoughtful about their coffee. \u00a0They need to serve better coffee. I ordered the Fork and Knife Dungeness Crab Melt. It was a really generous portion, but the crab mix needed more oomph! It was a little bland. \u00a0It needed more spices and herbs. The fries though were so good. They were long, skinny and crispy. \u00a0Yum! My husband had a bowl of the Clam Chowder and my friend had a cup of it, and they both liked the chowder. \u00a0My friend ordered the burger and she commented on how juicy it was. \u00a0  The service was good. When the check came, I showed them the Yelp check in deal from my iPhone, and our server promptly changed our bill. Nice to get 20% off our bill!   I was a happy runner when I left. I was all caffeined up and my stomach finally had real food in it after the half marathon. Two mini Luna bars and a banana were all I had since waking up at 5:30 am for the half marathon and completing it! \u00a0It was nice not worrying about the calories for a change! I definitely earned that meal!",

It had the potential to be SO good, and it could be if they got a couple things right..  1) DO NOT cook your eggs ahead of time in molds. No one likes room temperature/cold eggs in which the yolk is not runny. You can tell that the perfect sunny side up egg started off with a runny yolk, but because they leave the egg sitting out/ in a warming oven, it congeals and turns solid. FRESH EGGS people, it literally takes 1 minute to make a perfect sunny side up egg!  2) Ramen noodles suffered the same outcome. Made ahead of time, sitting out, room temperature to slightly chilly...   Otherwise, the ambiance was great, service was good, and I think that by reading the reviews that coming here for happy hour seems like the thing to do.",

While they admitted that it must be a mistake, no one can find out the correct price. 3. Food was the biggest disappointment. \u00a0 - Overall the salad (with raw beets and goat cheese) had no flavor except for one bite that tasted like soy sauce; poached salmon was mushy, scallops were over-cooked, bitter and way too salty. \u00a0 - Duck-fat fries neither smell nor taste duck fat. - Panna cotta was tough and no trace of pepper or basil as described on the menu; chocolate cremeux was nothing to write home about.

My Manhattan and Old Fashioned were made nicely and both were very tasty. \u00a0The waitress was also very attentive (perhaps too much). \u00a0For happy hour and the early evening, the place was pretty crowded and every seat was taken. \u00a0It felt like a lot of locals (mostly financial types), as opposed to tourists staying at the hotel. \u00a0By 7:30 or so, most of the people had cleared out, which was actually nice since I felt like we had some breathing room again.  Overall, I had a great time and would recommend this place to anyone whose in the mood for an upscale cocktail lounge. \u00a0I'm giving it five stars mainly because I feel the current rating is a bit undeserved. \u00a0Yes, it's still a new place, so there are some kinks to still be worked out, but definitely give it the old college try before writing it off.",

Came here for the lunch which is a great deal because normally it's $18.95 for two courses but they throw in the dessert as well. \u00a0I had the salad and the lamb burger which both were standard size. \u00a0My mom had the soup and the fish. \u00a0Food was good, nothing to rave about though. \u00a0The staff is trying. \u00a0It's not a five star restaurant so you can't expect them to be executing extremely well and it is a Hyatt hotel restaurant but they try to be friendly and strike a conversation with you. \u00a0They're also pretty attentive. \u00a0Come for Dine About Town, it's a great deal.",

Pros: 6am-11am, you can come in super early or sleep in if you'd like Gourmet Hot breakfast items...not your regular scrambled eggs and toast Fresh &amp; Organic breakfast items (I saw them switch foods out that were sitting too long under the heat lamps for new ones, with not many people even getting food) Customer Service - the staff waiting on tables were excellent (got me anything I asked and things I didnt even ask for too!)  Cons: Pricing - IF I had to pay out of pocket for this breakfast buffet, it would've been $25/person. \u00a0Glad it was included in the Room reservation.  Next time I'm staying in town - I'd love to come back here!",

They generally enjoyed their food, they did not find anything a distinct letdown neither anything to write home about.   This mediocrity suddenly took a turn for the worse when on the last morning my father ate a doomed dungeness crab omelet. I'm not sure the next time he'll be trying omelets again for the foreseeable future, as he spent the next night with his first, worst, and most painful experience of food poisoning.   Never. Again. Either for OneUp, or perhaps for dungeness crab/omelets which were their unwitting conspirators in a most unsavory crime.",

The bartender is the sweetest man imaginable, and he took care of me once while I was having drinks at the bar with a friend and again when my fianc\u00e9 and I had some time to kill and decided to do it over a snack in the lounge.  I love the comfy seating in the bar area. It's perfect for lounging solo with a book or while hanging in a group.   A little more variety in the bar menu would be great. I ordered sliders on my visit with my fianc\u00e9 and we had to place a separate order for some fries on the side. The sliders were juicy and quite tasty. The fries unfortunately didn't make it out at the same time as the sliders, but they were worth the wait -\u00a0hot and crispy until the very last bite, thanks to the metal dish in which they were served. Nice work, Grand Hyatt.",

All review-worthy areas from libations to seating, to atmosphere scored well for a bar hotel in Union Square - but what put me over the top was their attention to staffing. \u00a0As it turned out there was a large conference with many attendees that simultaneously converged at the bar, as attendees are wont to do in such a place. \u00a0Instead of leaving the non-badge wearing of us out in the cold, there was a barback for every bartender and they were all about service. \u00a0I love it when a place staff's up appropriately and service is as much part of the experience as the drink.",

I just did your feet a favor!)  Sure you'll run into the occasional tourist and/or convention goer, but if you find a hotel bar that can make a kick ass cocktail served by an awesome bartender, you keep it on your radar.   On chilly SF nights, I crave the bitter bite of Campari. That being said, the Negroni here is spot on. Head bartender Phil knows what's up and that seasonal cocktail menu? pretty exciting too. \u00a0If you don't know what you want, just tell him your preferences and he'll be sure to whip up the right concoction for you.  OneUP's soothing colors and minimalist vibe is a welcome sight amidst the holiday craziness of Union Square. Whether you opt for the low loungey seating or seats at the bar, you'll have a relaxing time here.",

My server, Evelin, who could not have been nicer, went in the back to see if they could make me one anyway.   Success!   I've been trying to find \u00a0the original ramen burger in New York and I have no idea how this compares, but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I might be. It seemed bland. I have to give the chef huge credit for even thinking to put this on the menu, BUT...when someone voluntarily offers to consume ramen noodles, ground beef, a fried egg, bacon, and whatever the hell else went into this thing, that's a free pass to toss in anything else that might make this delicious. Not that the flavor stopped me from finishing it, but it should not have been bland.   Ramen burger aside, the fries and the wine (Alexander Valley cab), and even the burger without the ramen were great, as was the service.   I have to say it was definitely novel to find one. Dump some salt on it and put it on the menu!",

I like the ambiance in the lounge, especially when they have live music. \u00a0The wings kept catching the attention of my scent receptors and I was totally wanting them, but alas, had already ordered something else. To that end - I had dinner over on the restaurant side in the private dining room. \u00a0Small, uninspired and dark, maybe it could feel intimate, but it felt kind of like we were in a very large broom closet. Service was great, wine was fab, but the food was just okay. \u00a0I had the spring salad which was light and fresh, but I was hoping for a little more strawberry I think. I also had the meaty and spicy flatbread, which was spicy, and while tasty, it was tasty in that \"hey - this is pretty good for a frozen pizza\" sort of way. \u00a0I wasn't super impressed. The tater tots however, are perfection!",
