A friend of mine used to work here back in the day and I always loved coming in to visit him. \u00a0I heard that they were remodeling and I am glad that it didnt change how I feel about the place...its dark (my friend actually filmed a short here called Dark Bar) without being dingy, its friendly with no pretention, and best of all...hidden. You sort of have to know about it to find it.   I came last night to watch a good friend compete in a karaoke competition, lots of local bartenders singin' their hearts out (along with me and everyone else in the bar). It was awesome.

So I tried 15 Romolo. Super glad I did. It was the best cocktail bar on my trip.   Knowledgeable bartenders. Friendly staff. Not so expensive drinks. Awesome decor. Fantastic cocktails! We have the recipe for a great cocktail bar.   Came in a bit past midnight and decided to try two concoctions which caught my eye. The Creole Cocktail and What Ales You.  The Creole Cocktail (Rye, House Vermouth, Benedictine and Picon) was super delicious with that strong Rye taste. The What Ales You (Rum, Ginger, Pommes, Lemon and a Belgian Ale) was really unique. I've tried cocktails combined with beer before, but this one was especially good.   The best part about the place was how there was plenty of room, still had a large number of people and wasn't difficult to get a drink. The place is pretty big. The bartenders took their time, but were efficient. You can tell they can do this with their eyes closes. (Note, please don't make my cocktail with your eyes closed)  Easily the best cocktail bar, I experienced out here.",

    "review_text": "Arriving at 15 Romolo, I felt a little like Harry Potter, walking up a steep alley and slipping through a nondescript door into a dim, wooden room. But it didn't stop there - my whole brunch experience pretty much transported me to another world, from start to end.  The Waffle Shot: complimentary with every brunch, this amuse-bouche is strong but flavorful with hints of chocolate and cherry coming through the bourbon. Plus it comes complete with a warm waffle bite! I hear the recipe changes a bit each time so you'll always have a nice little surprise.  The Drinks: I had the \"Beetlejuice,\" which is a spin off a bloody using beet juice and gin. The beet juice is a clever move, it cuts down on the acidity of the tomato juice while adding an earthy sweetness to the whole drink. Mix in the creme fraiche after taking a few sips and the richness adds yet another dimension to this already unique drink.  The Food: Ah, the fried chicken sandwich, a prime example of how the sum of something can be greater than its parts. Though each individual component may not have been executed to perfection (i.e., the bacon was a little overdone), the end product was everything I could've asked for in a brunch: crumbly flaky biscuits with crisp fried chicken, a kick of jalapeno, and a gooey over-easy egg yolk running all over everything...mmm!!! The hash deserves a special shout-out too; it's crunchy-crisp on the outside and steaming hot and bursting with chive flavor on the inside - this is how potatoes were meant to be eaten. The portion was large and very filling. I shamelessly admit that I ate the whole thing. Happily.  At $10 for the fried chicken sando 15 Romolo's prices are totally reasonable for brunch (and a whole lot more satisfying than your standard pancakes and sausage). When brunch was over, I was a little sad to step out into the real world of North Beach again...I'll be sure to return to this little nook and experience that scrumptious brunch again!",

Extra bonus: \u00a0Although this place has plenty of floor space for large groups, it still manages to maintain an intimate feeling if you sit/stand at the bar, or grab a table.

First of all, I have a lot less energy than I used to and I realistically can't make it through two bars in a row, max. Secondly, a phrase such as 'going out in North Beach' implies a certain kind of sh#&amp;%show that I don't have the patience for anymore. Rather, I'm much more a fan of visiting individual places for drinks that I love and where I can see myself staying for a while. 15 Romolo is definitely one of those places!   I led some out of towners to this bar on a Sunday night and I think for a moment they thought I was having them murdered for body parts on the black market, so hesitant were they to venture into the dark and shady alley in North Beach. Once inside though, I knew they would thank me!   Though it can get pretty crowded by the bar, there's actually a lot of space to wander and sit and stand and chat otherwise. On a recommendation I had a cocktail that I'm having trouble remembering now, especially because it's not on the sample menu currently on the bar's website (they're featuring their Christmas menu, so maybe they should get that updated!).. but I do remember it was a fruity mix of vodka and beer and something fruity? It may have had the word 'hay' in the name? It was a girly drink to be sure, but so delicious that all of my male compatriots couldn't help but order one for themselves. The drinks aren't cheap, but they're not cheaply made either, so just know you're in for a crafty kind of place.  It was a great night, perfect for our large group to catch up and relax on an off-night. Cheers to 15 Romolo!",

    "review_text": "Besides getting lost and feeling like I was on my way to a strip club on Brodway, I heart the crap out of 15 Romolo. \u00a0I have a feeling it's going to a bar I frequent often now!  I walked in and literally felt like I was entering my fifth grade art class strictly because of it's classroom style feel and the art-style bar stools. \u00a0The stools RULE because they have backs! I usually hate stools, but these stools were so comfortable. \u00a0They also have hooks underneath the bar, so us ladies can hang up our purses.  We sat down at the bar and shortly after that, I ordered my first drink, a Pimm's Cup. \u00a0I ordered it with vodka and the adorably cute, Jared Leto look-a-like bartender/owner, Aaron suggested I try it with gin. \u00a0Of course, initially I was shocked and disgusted by this recommendation as I hate gin, mostly in gin martinis, but I trusted him after giving me his schpiel on vodka vs gin. \u00a0Vodka is apparently only meant to be drank straight on the rocks, yet gin is a better liquor for mixing. \u00a0I trusted him and boy was that delicious :) \u00a0I also tried a pixie, which I wasn't into and a blackberry rickie (with my new favorite liquor, gin, of course), which was almost as delicious as the Pimm's cup!  Foodwise we ordered the french fries, the fried hot dogs, the burger, and a shrimp entree over fried green tomatoes served with bacon infused cornbread...Mmm, the food was outstanding for bar food. \u00a0My favorite had to be the burger and the shrimp. \u00a0Sadly enough, I was too full for the funnel cake. \u00a0Next time, next time.  I will be back 15 Romolo. \u00a0You have my heart!",

Also tried the track 42, which was manuka honey vodka, basil, unfiltered apple juice, lemon, egg white. Not too sweet, not sour, juuuust right.   -2 stars because the service was extremely slow and the food was mediocre.   First of all, it took a good 15 minutes to get our first round of drinks. I do not wait this long for alcohol, especially after a long day at work.   Also, although affordable, the food was well...bar food. Pork sliders (only 2 per order, boo), burger, and fries were okay. The tempura fried avocados were just aiite (and I LOVE avocados, as well as everything fried) and the dip didn't go too well. I really liked the chips and dip, which was just a mix of soft sweet potato/purple potato chips with \"green garlic greek goddess\" dip which was BOMB. Def saved that to repurpose for other food. Get that.  All in all, I'd say go for a few drinks during happy hour and then bounce around the rest of North Beach to enjoy your night.",

I love walking up the bizarre little alley to find a nearly unmarked entrance. Inside, the decor is spartan, but appropriate. The worn bar and wooden floors really make you feel like you're in a 1920's speak-easy.  I've been twice now -- once for a company holiday party and once with friends. The holiday party was great, obviously packed and explosive with mind-blowing booze. The cocktails were professionally assembled, delicious and potent. The bartenders/mixologists were classy and keen on experiementing.  My other visit was different -- the place was quiet on a Thursday evening, but had great music playing, solid food and a good selection of beers (Green Flash IPA if I recall correctly was my order).  Definitely a great place to hang out --- a fun, sexy feel (nothing to do with the nearby strip clubs).",

I had been here a number of times, but not in several years. \u00a0It seemed differently colder, and smellier. \u00a0I was hungry, but the dankish odor of past vomit ill-concealed by industrial cleaner, mixed with overflowed toilets of days gone by but not forgotten, along with general human-stink, made me want to dash. \u00a0  I stuck it out, had a cocktail, and ordered some grub. \u00a0The food was decent, and the booze helped ease the odor unpleasantness. \u00a0The mini-burgers looked alarmingly like frozen White Castle patties feebly nestled in white bread buns, but were deceptively tasty. \u00a0Not fall-off-your-chair good by any stretch -- it was more of a an unmet expectation of cardboard.  The service was good, as were the beverages. \u00a0We did not stay long, however, as the music was phenomenally loud (and this was early evening, say, 5:30 PM). In fact, when I noticed my happy hour pal's vocal cords bulging from her neck as she attempted to holler updates from her work-week and life, I hailed our server for the tab. \u00a0  Once out in the alleyway, we commented that it was as if the staff had cranked-up the tunes to psych themselves up for the evening while stocking the bar and prepping for the crowd (and there was a sizable post-work crowd) but forgot to dial it back when they opened the doors for business. \u00a0At midnight on a weekend, talk is cheap, but at 5:30PM during the work-week, I found myself saying things like, \"I could not even hear myself think!\" This, in turn, made me feel old. \u00a0I then gracefully and skillfully made a last-minute leap over a pile of human poo in the alley, and felt young again as we made our way to Comstock.",

As far as the bar food, the pulled pork sliders are incredible. \u00a0Pulled pork, spicy sauce and a crispy sweet slaw. \u00a0My buddy got the burger, and it looked great too. \u00a0Both selections are six bucks, I think, and more than enough to fill you up while you're having some drinks. \u00a0Prices of drinks are reasonable, also, and there is a wide array of spirits to choose from.

First things first, Romolo is a little alley, and the sign is very nondescript. But if you find yourself in the neon paradise that is (what I assume is) San Fran's stripper district, you're in the right place. And don't worry, once inside all of those feelings of skank go washing away.  Lately I've been committed to drinking like a grown-up, and have a predisposition for scotch and whiskey drinks. I like boozy drinks that I can sip slowly, and 15 Romolo accommodates wonderfully. Not only do they have an incredibly thoughtful cocktail list, but also a huge representation of spirits. While I spent the first part of my most recent evening I enjoyed a whiskey drink that had some sort of cowboy name. When it got busy, I just segwayed into neat scotch. Perfect.  Speaking of getting busy, I feel so bad! We completely overtook that bar. On a Sunday night suddenly the place had like 50 people in there. The bartenders were totally overwhelmed but still handled everything with patience and professionalism. These people may look similar to the tragically hip barkeeps at places like Rickhouse, but they are definitely much more humble and better at dealing with other human beings. I like them.  Rumor has it they have food, but I never come here to eat. But on every subsequent visit to SF I will definitely be here to drink. Yay 15 Romolo!",

I used to be the sleepy pub girl, enjoying a dark pint in a dingy hole in the wall where the only other patrons were the aging men hunched over their stools.   I moved to the city, and I underwent a sort of personal renaissance. Bombarded with events to attend and things to see and men to do (wait, what?), I found myself transitioning to the more raucous clubs and bars frequented by hordes of people my own age.   Had I come here when I was still shuttling in from Oakland, I would have loved it. Both early in the evening and in the week, 15 Romolo is pretty quiet. You can slide up to the bar and order any number of tasty libations (the cucumber ginger drink is particular memorable) and exemplary bar bites (pork sliders are slop-down-your-face good).   Coming here now on a weekend night, I DO love it. It's a bustling spot full of attractive people. Admittedly, it is a bit of an older crowd (30+) but in this day and age, a girl has got to expand the age limits of her potential dating pool.   My only gripe is that service is SLOW. They don't have \"well drinks\" - everything comes directly from a can or a bottle, so I can understand the delay. My old self wouldn't mind the wait so much, but nowadays I like the drinks to be a'coming quickly so I can get my mack on some dude.   Yes, kids, I believe that's called regression.",

Track 42 was the name of the cocktail I ordered. It had Manuka Honey Vodka from 42Below, which I found out is vodka made in New Zealand! Also with unfiltered apple juice, lemon, basil, and egg white ontop. It was the best I've ever had. It was my first drink with egg white froth ontop and also my first time having honey vodka. You can really taste the honey, don't ask me why I thought this but I thought it tasted like bees...Of course I would know how bees tasted like, because I ate a couple before and that was exactly how they tasted like. True story. It's not true. ANYWAYYYS!  We also tried their fries with Madras Curry Catsup and \"Fancy Ranch\" (tasted like sour cream and onion dip) and fried chicken wings with coconut milk. The fries were good, especially with this Fancy Ranch dip. But the chicken wings got me more. The coconut milk with a hint of spiciness.. oohhhh my mouth is watering.

Once again I am industry, and I don't know how she got all of our orders perfectly but she did. We wanted for nothing. Only negative was I thought things were taking too long, OH WAIT.

If you want to taste what the big boys are doing in the city, if you want to drink like the cool kids are, but you don't feel like paying dooshbox prices or being surrounded by pretense, come to 15 Romolo and enjoy the reasonable amount of time it takes to craft your shizzle. \u00a0  Bam  I'll be there wednesday.",

While I only popped in here for an adult beverage, the menu as a whole looked interesting to say the least. Side bar: I would recommend walking with at least one other responsible human being down the alley that leads you to this bar. Let's just say there can be some uber sketchy characters floating around this general area.  After much deliberation, I went with the Strawberry Cooler - an amazing, aromatic and taste bud tantalizing blend of vodka, strawberry puree, dolin dry, lemon juice, violet liquor and rosewater seltzer. While I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these coolers, it was really cool. Pun intended. There was a bit too much rosewater in my particular cocktail - but really, I didn't mind drink a rose bush for one drink.  The bartenders here definitely work their magic - they show off some super skills concocting these alcoholic wonders.",

It's got that old, faux-Prohibition thing going for it. The food is pretty damn decent--I'm happy that they have food at all! But you know, standard SF-style comfort food: poutine, fancy Mac and Cheese, charcuterie, cheese, etc. It's a large space with plenty of room for larger parties, including tables, the bar, and some standing tables. Service is fine, about your average wait times for a busy, crowded spot (in other words, a bit longer than you'd like but not long enough to make you leave before placing an order).   I will say that it's super loud in there, and I can't figure out why... the music isn't that loud, but the din just travels. Ah well.",

Black Keys, Jurassic 5, Talking Heads - the assortment was great.  The mixed drinks were well concocted. I had a great Old Fashioned, enjoyed the Pimm's Cup with Bourbon, another Bourbon drink with caramelized pineapple syrup, and one with vodka and basil that was deliciously frothy. (Note how the drink names start to escape me as I get further down the list.)  The food was extremely tasty (fried green tomatoes, pork sliders, and a snack plate with watermelon, feta, shisito peppers and some tasty prosciutto-esque meat whose name escapes me.)   The bartenders were extremely friendly and pretty damn handsome too. My date went well - but if one goes awry here there's definitely some distractions around.  15 Romolo manages to be classy without being pretentious. I'll absolutely be back.",

You're on Broadway on a Saturday night. I know. Already this sounds awful. But bear with me here. So your walking down Broadway and you're just letting your eyes wander about. You've been here before. You've seen all this before. You don't know why your here and you haven't even had your first drink yet (usually out of town vistors is the reason...damn them). Anyway so your passing by yet another strip club and you happen to look up an alley. Theres a guy sitting on a chair outside of a doorway. Hm...that looks peculiar. Is there something up there?  So you hoof up the hill and what do you know? Its a bar! A hole in the wall clean, classy bar. Already your doing a happy dance for finding this golden gem.   As if it couldn't get any better then this, they have food. And by food I mean AMAZING bar food created by one of my personal favorite chefs of San Francisco (heres the biased part). The food is creative, filling, and pairs perfectly with the wide variety of unique cocktails this place houses.  The staff is attentive, the drinks are great, the food is to die for, and its not ghetto fabulous.   Thank F*in God for Romolo!",

I usually don't like anything with peanut butter, but I gave their Yo-mama style burger a try and it is absolutely orgasmic in my mouth. The gooooey peanut butter rolling along the side of the medium-well grass-fed beef patty. OH MY GOODNESS. The portion is small, but one would definitely hit that spot. $6 well spent!!  We also ordered a side of fries, perfect to the crisp. The jambalinis were a good starter. Jambalaya battered into a littler ball and fried with a spicy sauce to top it. Yummy, but a little on the spicy side for my taste.  I just looked at their menu and it changed, once again. Another reason to go back to this hidden spot on Broadway!",

I recently met Aaron, one of the owners, while planning an event for a PR client of mine and was really impressed with what a genuinely nice and knowledgable dude he is. He helped craft a cocktail program for the event and brought a huge level of insight &amp; knowledge around San Francisco's culinary/bar scenes - as well as other local industries - to the event's panel, which he spoke on. The drinks at the event were so good that everyone headed back to 15 Romolo to close out the night, and Aaron &amp; his team whipped up some seriously amazing new cocktails coming to the menu. It's always great to meet someone who not only runs a great business, but who also really cares about the larger city, industry &amp; culture they're a part of.  Aside from super hospitable and genuine ownership, the food here is another lesser-known standout. They serve food til 1:30 AM (I think) on the weekends, so rather than grab a greasy slice of pizza on Broadway to finish the night, get Romolo's burger - my favorite in North Beach and one of my favorites in the city.  Oh, and brunch on the weekends? Never as packed as other brunch spots in North Beach, same great cocktails, expanded menu of interesting/delicious takes on breakfast, and access to one of the city's greatest jukeboxes. Awesome.",

I had never heard of Romolo street, so naturally I used my smartphone's mapping program to guide me there, and experienced some confusion when it appeared to be sending me down an alleyway behind a strip club, but after walking to the alleged location I noted there was in fact a bar there.  It was a totally unexpected decor, dark and cozy with lots of wood, a jukebox and an old fashioned photo booth. It was doing a \u00a0pleasant but not annoyingly busy amount of business for a Monday night and we easily got a table near the window.  We started with some Pimm's cup cocktails, which honestly were delicious and well mixed. We followed those up with a Fris\u00e9e Salad with Lardons and Poached Eggs and some house made pork shoulder pate. Those were both delicious, and we decided to get some of the deep fried bone marrow, which was like eating deep fried butter (delicious and impressive). Finally we eat had a pork slider which were great, and shared a bread pudding.  Our waiter was fun, talkative, made some great suggestions and even gave us a free round of Fernet Branca shots.

I had the benedict, and it was fine. Served on toast with really nice pieces of thick bacon (best part) with a much more liquid-y hollandaise sauce. I would get the hollandaise on the side next time; it overpowered it for me, and made everything a little too wet. Definitely get a side of the hash browns though - very fried, very yummy. I also had a bite of my sister's blueberry pancakes &amp; bacon, and those were very good. I think that might be big enough for 2 people to share as well. Ooh, also had a sip of their bloody mary and it is SPICY!  They brought out complimentary waffle shots before our meal, which was a sweet gesture. Boy, these are strong!! The waffles have been soaked in alcohol, and the syrupy stuff at the bottom of the glass has alcohol too. I prefer my waffles sober, but these were cute :)",

From legendary moments in golf, Nixon's resignation and 60's styled 'mod' illustrations, there's a sense of nostalgia that between rounds of bourbon &amp; Hall &amp; Oats tunes, reaffirms collective national belonging. The seedy, dim red light underscores notions of the prohibition era though makes it a minor pain in locating the flusher.  Apparently there's a woman's bathroom located in the hallway I've never been to. I cannot comment on that.",

I had guests in from out of town and chose this spot because it sounded cool, and had a great cocktail list. Also, we could walk around afterward, if we wanted to.   The spot has low-key decor. Cool lighting fixtures and sort of a hipster meets saloon atmosphere, but not in a way that would make people feel like they weren't cool enough to hang out there. Furniture is sparse, and it was a little chilly in there.  The staff was super nice and attentive, offering us table service, even though it was slow and could have asked us to go up to the bar. They have small eats, but we were there for the cocktails.   I was hoping the drinks would be akin to those at Elixer or Alembic: fun concoctions, made with fresh ingredients, and a throwback to the days of the Sidecar. The menu for drinks is fun and long, and takes some time to decipher. All cocktails are $9-$10.   When the drinks arrived, unfortunately they failed to live up to their clever names. There is no subtlety of flavor, many were overshadowed by sweet liquors, and some tasted medicine-y. They were stiff enough to order more, as we did, though I was a little bummed this wasn't a spot my out-of-town friends would be impressed with.  I would imagine it's a fine place to get a regular vodka tonic, I would return for that, and for the kind staff.",

Once inside it has a good bar feel in which everything is wood. There's a punch bowl at the door, FYI: it does have alcohol in it and they do charge. So be careful, LOL!  We wanted a snack and just to hang a little, so we got several drinks, my favorite is the cucumber gimlet and pimms cup; it's such a refreshing drink. Felt like Summer!   Definitely always most enjoyable when a bar is empty, it gives us a chance to take in the d\u00e9cor and atmosphere.

It has a hipster/prohibition era vibe and really cool lights (mismatched bulbs within each fixture). It's fairly unpretentious with a good mix of patrons. There were 3 guys that looked like 1930's mobsters: 3-piece suits, fedoras, and pocket squares who just walked in, stood around for a bit not smiling, and left. Weird, but entertaining! There was a guy in a bro tank, girls dressed to go out, and girls dressed in jeans. We may have been the youngest people there (22-23), but most of the crowd seemed to be late 20's-40's.   Service was great, we sat at a table and our waitress was very attentive despite being very busy.   Also, if you think you turned up the wrong ally, you're probably in the right place.

Despite the directions our GPS instructed us to follow, Romolo Place basically taunted us to keep looking harder. After recalibrating our GPS a few more times, we arrive.   Nestled in the middle of a hill, 15 Romolo stood.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip9nECwVVjfjulwrKisQ?select=Wnrko9cGoKVLX55SmoHMsw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip\u2026</a>  Upon entrance, you immediately see reserved tables along the walls, open space in the middle, and a bar to the end. Ambiance reminded me of a speak easy type of resto. It was pretty dark in there and even at 5:30pm, all tables were either reserved or occupied with the (small) bar completely surrounded.  Bummer. With no available seating, I couldn't order the jambalini, the burger ($6) with peanut butter and bacon ($2) that I was looking forward to trying, or the Troubled Waters cocktail that came highly recommended. (Thanks Badri!)  The bar was suffocated with thirsty patrons. They had two bartenders and two barbacks that night. All were put hard to work. One of the barbacks, or bartender-in-training, was only serving beer, wine, and Pimms Cup ($7 during happy hour). Our large group opted for a round of their specialty Pimms Cup.   I was impressed with this specialty cocktail of theirs. Fortunately, I was able to witness it in the making- a concoction of pimms, homemade ginger syrup, bitters, cucumber, mint, soda water, and a dash of lemon juice. A few shakes &amp; stirs later, we were poured our Pimms Cup. I must admit it was refreshingly delicious!  Bottom line: I'm definitely coming back to try the rest of their goodies.  Tips: Gps it at your own risk. It's located between Broadway and Vallejo. Reserve a table. Trust me. Happy Hour: 5pm - 7:30pm ($7 Pimms, $24 Sangria pitcher, &amp; $1 off well, wine, &amp; beer)",

The bar's in the back, so you've got to traipse across an awkwardly set up room, but once you've made it you're golden. The bartenders are friendly, the specialty cocktails are appropriately innovative, and the prices aren't ridiculous. The atmosphere seems a little off: if they were to take away the fancy bottles and start serving PBRs in paper bags this could easily translate to a pretty solid dive, bathroom included. Add in the fact that they've got Journey on the jukebox and you're definitely not at a typical craft cocktail joint. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing, though (although the Journey has really got to go).",

My friend ordered a brownie which was amazing.   They supposedly host Punch Drunk Brunch which I'll have to make a point to try sometime in the near future. The small bites menu looked quite tasty as well.  Prices are reasonable. Bartenders are nice and friendly. It didn't seem too busy for happy hour. I'm not sure on other nights.

I ordered an amazona, which is an oddly delicious mix of coconut milk, rum, ginger, lime, nutmeg, and seltzer water. as I watched the bartender make our drinks, I noticed how carefully they concoct each beverage. I like bars that do this, rather than throw a bunch of alcohol together, give it one stir, and hand it to you. the drinks were delicious, and a perfect balance of sweet to counterbalance the alcohol.   not only do they have amazing drinks, but they also have amazing food that's super affordable! fries and other snacks will run you about 4-5 dollars, while sliders and what not go for 6-8 dollars. we tried the pork sliders and spicy carrot fennel dip with pita. let me tell you, i really don't like carrots... but that dip was delicious. the sliders were yummy as well, the pulled pork was tender and it was paired with a tangy slaw. definitely a good place to come for a relaxed night, I'll be back soon!",

The bar stools do kind of suck though -- they are like the stools from way back when in art or science class before they understood the notion of ergonomics, which turns out may be even more important now in ensuring your drunk self doesn't slip right off your bar stool.

I got the molasses smoked trout which came shredded with some dressed greens and asparagus sitting on top of a mound of crunchy potato galette. On the corner was a small dallop of creme fraiche with fish eggs for decoration and dipping. The presentation, in short, was gorgeous.   The flavors, while well-executed, were not fully developed in my opinion. The trout and asparagus were both full of flavor but the potato galette, which comprised of 60% of the plate, was hardly salted and much too crispy. Only a few peices had the soft center and crunchy outside. The rest could be called potato chips-- which is fine, but not easy to eat with the other textures on the plate. \u00a0  I am also in denial that there was a fish bone in my already shredded and cleaned out trout, because I like this place so much. But it really was a surprise when I suddenly swallowed something and \u00a0it did hurt for a good twenty minutes before it went down.

I usually come here when I am about to go Salsa/Bachata at Atmosphere and it has never failed me with the extensive alcohol menus which have been printed on a piece of old time newspaper for the nostalgic feel.

First of all, the band was not that great. At one point, people were remarking \"I didn't realize we planned for karaoke tonight\". Then Jameson on the rocks cost $10. Pouring was pretty decent but still a little too pricey. Bartenders were also not big on recognizing the order of when people came to the bar - I had two very hot friends (seriously hot, one is a model, the other should be) wanting to buy drinks, calling his name, and he flat out ignored them. It took them seemingly 20 minutes to get drinks - kind of unacceptable, even with the crowd. Add that to the lack of parking (I know, I know, it's North Beach but I'm too poor and cheap to cab it and way too picky to wear a miniskirt and a leather corset on a bus), and you get me thinking I should have gone to Koko.

My party arrived at 12:45pm. \u00a0We ordered our food and waited...and waited...and waited. \u00a0We saw another large group come and go. \u00a0We saw the group next to us get seated after us yet they received their food first. \u00a0After 45 min of waiting I asked where our food was, clearly displeased. \u00a0My previous experience at 15 Romolo was good, so why was it such a disaster this time?! \u00a0My poor out-of-town guests were starving! \u00a0So finally our orders were fired and arrived 10-15 min later, along with a surprise. \u00a0Our server apologized profusely for the long wait and said they would comp our entire meal, drinks and all! \u00a0He said they really do want us to return since they haven't been in the brunch business for very long and really want to make a good impression to survive in the established North Beach neighborhood. \u00a0I was expecting a discount, but this was far beyond my expectations! \u00a0But you know what? \u00a0It worked, since here I am giving them a 5-star review and already making plans to return.  Now finally on to the food: I've realized that even though all of their food items are ~$8-9, the portion size varies tremendously. \u00a0If you want the most bang for your buck, go with the crispy chicken biscuit sando, burger, or chilaquiles. \u00a0The hash portion is smallest so if you're a dude it's really only half a meal. \u00a0I personally love the chicken biscuit sando! \u00a0 The brunch drinks tend to be on the light side -- call me an alcoholic, but I prefer them boozier even at noon. \u00a0Maybe I'll see if they can whip me up an old fashioned at brunch next time...",

Everyone knows 5 pm is waaay too late to get your drink on when it's Saturday.  Cocktails are artfully prepared. Happy hour til 7:30 with the $6-7 pimm's cup is a steal. I had it with bourbon. It was tasty, but I prefer a bit more spirituous of a cocktail. Maybe next time I'll get it without the seltzer. If you like ginger though, this is for you.  Their refreshing menu has some great cocktails if you want to go easy on your liver. For those of you who don't give a shit about contracting cirrhosis, go for their original cocktails. The buffalo nickel is fantastic - a great blend of spicy and earthy. I wish I had ordered 4 of them.

I mean do you see the scary tattoos and large hands on that guy?\"---Embarassingly for me, he was a lovely and polite young man. (Turns out he is a bouncer. Doh).  We walked in to a sexily dim lit space..with dark wood paneled walls and bar stools and bartenders with cool mustaches. You know, the kind where you want to tug on it to see if it is real?  She and I then sidle (that's what I do..I don't stomp up, or even walk..I SIDLE) and we were cheerily greeted by a super cool, lanky dude with a crooked smile.    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 LOVE IT.

But don't argue with me on it. Trust me, these artists of drinks know what they are doing and I am thankful to escape from the world of vodka tonics and cosmos. Blech.  We ordered some fries and enjoyed our drinks, food and ambiance on a dark and stormy night. It was noir in the classic sense, down to my dark dress and pouty red lipstick.

Really, I thought I saw some great mustaches on my trip to SF but nothing compared to the in-grown accessories the fine men in this place were sporting.  I tried the Brazilian (cachaca, velvet falernum, mandarine napoleon and lime) and the Darjeeling Ltd (gin, tumeric, earl grey, gum syrup, lime and black pepper). Both were potently, well-made but the Darjeeling Ltd blew me away. The addition of the black pepper and tumeric was a wonderful tastebud pick-me-up...and I'm pretty sure had some great anti-oxidant and natural calming properties as well (at least that's what Dr. Oz says). Let's just say tea time will never be the same for me again, unless gin is involved.  I had stuffed myself silly at the Ferry Building Farmer's Market, earlier that morning and had promised myself that I would never eat again, but the draw of poutine on the menu was just too great. No joke, this was the BEST poutine I ever had. Served in a mini cast iron skillet, the fries were perfectly crisp on the outside with a healthy serving of fennel-sausage gravy and mozzarella cheese curds on top. The skillet allowed the food to stay warm so we could enjoy our food and cocktails at a leisurely pace.   God bless you 15 Romolo!",

The bartender made it just right, more gin, less tonic, squeezed lime. Thumbs up for that. While having our drinks, we got to looking at the menu of cocktails and got curious the moment we saw they had absinthe. So we started asking her for specialty drinks. She gave us some suggestions and we chose. I chose an Absinthe-Bourbon Mix drink (forgot the name of it or what exactly was in it) Everyone ordered something different. I think she was a Mixologist, because every drink was just packed with flavor, and blended correctly with all the fresh ingredients she put in the drinks. Glad I dropped in, it was a great treat!",

Cocktails were mighty tasty -- I loved my Sleepy Jean (chamomile-infused bourbon, nectarine compote, lemon, and Peychaud's bitters), but all the other drinks I sampled were great. I'd definitely order the Pimm's Cup for its super refreshing fizz next time.  Reading the reviews, it was clear to me that I had to have the burger yo' mama style, diet be damned. My one concession was that I didn't eat the buns and had the dressing on the side. Yeah, it lost some of its gut-bomb charm in the process... but trust that it was still as sinful as drunk food should be. My friends were a bit disappointed with the size of their fish and chips order, but what little they did have was good. How to remedy hunger here: go to Golden Boy's afterward for a slice!  The vibe is non-pretentious, the service super friendly and personable. The atmosphere, while roomy and relaxed during HH, definitely started picking up as the night wore on. Fun!",

    "review_text": "A great place to start your night. Make sure you know which alley to go up before your first visit.  I like the vibe. It's hipster-casual...with a jukebox and photo booth. There are small tables scattered throughout so you need to be quick in snagging one as parties leave. There are seats at the bar but they seem uncomfortable due to all the people ordering drinks.   The place starts to get packed around 9:30p/10p-ish on a Friday night. I'd recommend arriving as early as possible if you want to sit - hence the reason to start out here. There usually ends up being a large standing crowd that ebbs and flows as the night progresses.  15 Romolo attracts a wide range of clientele. To name a few, there are casual hipsters, some of the young fi-di crowd, couples of all ages, and even some older folks (60's?). Most people arrive in groups. Everyone tends to keep to themselves for the most part.  The drinks here are very, very good. My personal favorite is the Pimm's cup. It's well-mixed and fairly strong. You can have a bartender mix you your own customized drink if nothing on the menu strikes your fancy. The bartenders put a lot of effort into creating each drink, so be prepared to wait a little bit longer than normal. If you're lucky enough to get a table, the waitresses will take your order and you can skip the hassle of ordering directly at the bar. However, the waitresses are also a bit slow themselves.  Last time I also tried the burger and fries. Both were above average for bar food. The pork sliders are also flavorful.  My only complaints are the limited seating and the somewhat slow wait service when you do grab a table. Overall, one of my favorite bars in the city.",

He asked us what our favorite drinks were, how sweet we like it, what dislikes we have, and from there, he knew just what to make and we had some tasty cocktails. We both had eaten dinner but we had the fried cauliflower for a snack, and though it was good, it wasn't anything special. The one downfall was that the bartender charged us the premium for every cocktail so we walked out a little poorer. I am personally ok with well cocktails for the sake of saving a buck or two, but I guess I paid for the drink diagnosis. Overall a cute bar on a random street, I will definitely go there again.",

Basically, our server informed us that it was last call at about 1:50 or so. We ordered one last beer to wash the delicious poutine down with. Promptly at 1:59 this random bartender comes over and lets us know that we have 30 seconds left to finish and \"get the fuck out\". Now at this point we are just finishing our waters and my friend is trying to finish his one last beer. My gf goes to the bathroom and we are standing at the table waiting for her. Of course we are shocked at how abrasive he is, and we say, ok, we are just finishing our waters.   The bartender goes \"ok, time to fucking leave, we are closed.\"   My gf is still in the bathroom, we aren't going to leave without her. We say this and the bartender proceeds to snatch the beer out of my friends hand mid sip, spilling it on him. I tell him I'm going to the bathroom to get my gf and then he pushes my friends to the door, and literally slams the door while they are standing in the doorway, slamming the door into them!   Now we are not sloppy drunk or anything like that, nor are we being rude or loud or anything, and we weren't responding to the bartenders extremely rude comments in a similar fashion either, we are just all looking extremely confused. My friend even says to the bartender \"Why are you being so mean to us?\"   I understand that CA law states that alcohol can't be served after 2am, but I've never had a drink snatched from me when a restaurant closed before!!!!!! So ridiculously unprofessional. I don't understand why we were cussed at and shoved around either.   We emailed the management and they are supposed to be sending us gift certificates (taking a while on that tho lol). Hopefully that jerk got fired.   If we were anything short of respectful and calm people, we would have started a gnarly bar fight as soon as this guy started saying stuff like that.

My crappy day notwithstanding, one of my coworkers was owed a significant celebration. \u00a0Virtually all courtrooms (like churches) are designed basically the same: there's the gallery [where the public sits, often in very pew-like benches], the well [many lawyers don't even know it's called the well, but that's where the tables for the plaintiff and defendant are], the jury box [self-explanatory], and the bench [for the judge]. \u00a0Between the gallery and the well, there's always a rail of some kind. \u00a0And the rail itself has a very specific name: the bar. \u00a0Traditionally, only lawyers were allowed to walk past the bar and enter the well---clients and witnesses sat elsewhere. \u00a0Thus, it was said that only a lawyer could pass the bar. \u00a0And the phrase stuck.  So, as I said, my coworker, having recently (well, a month-and-a-half ago) found out that she had, indeed, passed the bar, was owed a significant celebration. \u00a0And she chose happy hour at 15 Romolo. \u00a0And it was an excellent choice. \u00a0The drinks were very good, and I spent a few minutes talking with one of the bartenders about their interesting decision to make a cocktail based on Old Granddad (which I happen to like, but which no one would mistake for high-quality liquor). \u00a0The bar food was also excellent. \u00a0The setting is very interesting---like a slightly rehabbed sawdust bar [it occurs to me that the likelihood of anyone on SF Yelp actually having ever been IN an honest-to-goodness sawdust bar is extremely small], but in a good way.  I'm not giving 15 Romolo the full 5 stars yet because we started happy hour a bit early, and the place was basically empty during our entire visit, so I didn't get a good sense for the energy of the place. \u00a0I will certainly be back, and once I get the full experience, I'm pretty confident this will enter into my regular rotation.",

Meanwhile, they keep the talk flowing with ingenious drinks, tasty bites, good service and most surprising (to me) of all, a good juke. These people know what to do with a good bourbon. Most places in the city don't. 15 Romolo is rarely crowded to the point that most bars in the city are (crowded enough that everything kind of smells of stinky people), and this is a conscious decision.

Tucked down a little alley, and masked by a sign for the Basque Hotel, it feels like a darker, more spacious, secret sister to Comstock Saloon. There's a big communal bar in the middle, with little cafe tables throughout. They've mastered that dark wood + vintage lighting combo, giving it that old timey feel that hipsters go nuts for. You'll feel like a real SF insider drankin' here.   We came late on Sunday night and they were featuring a Beer Week inspired cocktail menu - the perfect his &amp; her's compromise. I ordered the \"Hayride\" or something like that, and it was in-cred-ible! Fizzy like a beer, coconutty like a pina colada, and zippy like a gimlet. And best of all, it was served in a tall glass (I can't stand dainty cocktail sippy cups). Very impressive.   Get this: they also have FOOD! Fancy food that you'd find in a basque tapas joint, like charcuterie platters, albondigas (meatballs), and grilled cheese and coppa sammies. Does drinking with your posse get any better than this?

As some have noticed, service can be slow since many of the drinks take 5 minutes to make. \u00a0However, if you're not in a rush, the wait is well worth it.  Even better than the drinks is Romolo's menu, which is very high-end gourmet bar food. \u00a0The pork sliders are amazing, as are the Boricua wings. \u00a0If you ever see the Squab and Waffles (high-end chicken and waffles) as the daily special, order it! \u00a0You will not be disappointed!",

After I'd given up, a friend of mine eventually brought me a Pimm's -- I personally loved the addition of cucumber to this drink; really, I can't think of anything better to down on a hot day.

Definitely not good enough to support billing yourself as a place that makes authentic, quality cocktails. I will say that they have a wide selection of rye and bourbon, which was a plus. It was impossible to get the bartender's attention, and it seemed like they were severely understaffed that night. \u00a0Only plus - the lesbian bartender put 100 proof rye in my drink, and totally didn't charge me. Second, the crowd. Bad crowd. Seriously -- it was like someone pulled a dragnet through the bay and dumped the contents into 15 Romolo. Some loser maniac wearing a fedora was completely scared of me and told me that it was because he wasn't used to seeing lesbians out. Yeah...I don't know.  Third, the ambiance. The music was way too loud. Way too loud. Like, this is not a club/bar like Rouge. It's supposed to more authentic and classy, yes? Act like it.  Fourth, the Yelp sin. Yeah, get this: waiting in line for the bathroom, talking to another girl about the Yelp drink deal they had going that night. A barback \u00a0comes walking by and says, \"Hey! You're not supposed to talk about that! Don't tell people or else we won't do it again!\"   Anway - don't really care if they ever do anything again, b/c I probably won't be back.",

I sent him an email, to which he responded while on vacation, and put me in touch with one of the other managers, Brandon. My friends and I were very well-taken care of last night and the managers certainly made good on their promise to make up for my bad experience. The service was excellent, the venue is nice (chill and upper-scale without being pretentious), and the music was fantastic (you can't lose with a jukebox). Good customer service goes a REALLY long way and these guys clearly care about their venue and customers. They hit it out of the park last night to make up for a bad experience.

Thankfully the above scenario is not the case at 15 Romolo.

I'm also sure they could fix you anything you ask since they have to stock a wide variety of liquor and liqueur just to make the drinks on the menu. We also sampled their fries which were spectacular dipped in the curry ketchup. As far as drinks go, I recommend the Black Irish Flip. Its the best way to introduce raw eggs into your bar going experience. As far as this rose's thorns, there are three that come to mind. You should be prepared to spend some money; the price you pay for some super creative drinks. Second, I wish they opened a little earlier, it would be nice to hit this place for lunch and a couple drinks then continue roaming the city.

The well balanced, refreshing drinks are reasonably priced ($9 to $11) but come with a wait (understandably so due to the long list of fresh ingredients). If you haven't been in a while expect a new menu with playful eats and summer time cocktails. Read carefully when ordering food from the bar menu, plates are adventurous. \u00a0For example, popcorn ceviche and hot dogs wrapped in corn tortillas. \u00a0I suggest going with an open mind, time to chill and good company.",

I used to stand on this block and try to pimp my hoe's, helping them reel in bird's/sugar daddy's to up their clientele. You mean to tell me, this whole time, little ol' 15 Romolo was posted in the guts of this alley? SUS.   I wandered in here one night out of curiosity (after my hoe's paid me my money, of course). To my surprise, it was a quaint and lively gem tucked away from the Broadway ratchets. It was an odd crowd, my friend and I appeared to be the only brown people in this establishment but there were some interesting folks in here to say the least.   They offer tapas from 6-130am...errrthang under $10. At least from what I saw that night. Their cocktail menu looked BOMB!!! Drinks were $$ give or take but they looked amazing. I had a couple beers because I tend to be a gutter bitch. Great beer selections and reasonably priced. There is a \"speak easy\" vibe in here that I adore!!! I dont remember there being much seating.....just me and my bitch awkwardly standing in the middle of the room like.................oh. People are chatty and will walk up to you with useless convos.   Bring your main bitch here.   .......fuck it, the side bitch too.",

The cocktails are great and the service, to their credit, doesn't take any crap from rookies. Figure out what you want and be prepared to order. My friend and I had some excellent drinks before eating nearby. Music and ambience allow 15 Romolo to provide you either a relaxed evening of drinking and apps, the first stop of a big night, or a very tasty brunch.  Another visit came for the end of a special Easter edition of Sunday Funday. One friend had 3 grilled oysters, while another had the fried chicken and waffles, with gravy instead of syrup! This time I ate the burger, about which I'd heard good things. It was small, no more than 1/4lb pre-cooked, but tangy and juicy. Their secret sauce uses spices and herbs like onions, shallots and other things I was a bit too Sunday Funday'd to remember now. At only $6 it really is only a small plate, but for a bar that positioning is undoubtedly correct.  No matter what mood I'm in, Romolo delivers. Energetic and light-hearted, tired and cranky, I can find it and run with it or change my mood as needed. Staff, music, and even patrons are all available to do so.  Pro Move: Start your meal off right and try the punch during brunch.",

It's made with ginger syrup, instead of ale and even though I doubt it's made to British standards, I was pleased with how my Pimm's turned out. My girlfriend ordered the sangria, which isn't to be missed and my other friends ordered a Wilde Heart (strong but sweet) and a Queen Eleanor (lemony with a bit of a kick). We ordered a few small plates to tide us over and I have to say the french fries here are to DIE for. I don't know what they put on them, but they taste better than your regular fries. There's definitely a salt and pepper mixture sprinkled on top, but I think they also have either onion or garlic powder on them. Either way, we ordered 2 baskets.   Will definitely be coming back here to try their Sex Panther drink (made with real bits of panther apparently ;P) and the rest of their appetizers.",

She was surprised at how empty the place was (it was probably close to 10pm on a Sunday night), so I can't speak to the loudness of crowds mentioned in other reviews. It was perfect for us!  The location is sort of back-alley, out-of-the-way - which I really liked. The decor is, for lack of a better word, Portlandy (I'm speaking from a frame of reference of being a PDXer) - dark woods, ye olde saloon-feel, artisanal light bulbs, daily menus printed out like Old West broadsheet newspapers, photobooth in the corner.   I had the Smokehouse Tea, which was really delicious. Usually smoked cocktails end up tasting like a drink + liquid smoke to me, but this one had a good balance of smokey/tart/sweet.  We split a basket of fries - the best damn fries I've had in a while. They came with an excellent curried ketchup, and even when they inevitably cooled to room temperature, they remained delightfully crunchy.  I also had the watermelon/goat cheese/arugula/capicola salad. Also very good.  Now, granted, I might have still been floating on an endorphin cloud post-session - but this was the absolutely best end to a memorable day. I don't doubt the place gets loud when more people are there (it's very warehousey with little there to absorb noise) but if you catch a moment when it's a little more empty, you'll want to spend some time just soaking it all in.  PS: again, my perspective might be skewed, but the ladies room was not that scary.",

BRUNCH   - Share Our Strength Special - Foie Gras 2 ways: Torchon with stonefruit mostarda and seared with berry coulis - this cost goes to the Share Our Strength! Chef, can you do this more often?! Great cause!  - Caramel sticky bun - why, why, why? I don't even like sweet!  - Fried green tomato - shrimp remoulade, herb salad - like  - Pork Sugo - poached eggs, braised green - LOVE, I love it! It was so tasty! MUST TRY!  - Brioche Benedict - poached eggs, braised kale, speck, hollandaise - oh, you spoiled me!  - Applewood smoked bacon - it makes your day better, I promise.  DRINKS:  - Punch - only $5, must try!  - Pimm's Cup - so good!  - Beetle Juice - shake,Serona, gin, beet juice, lemon, tomato, sesame oil, creme faiche - there goes the good and the temptation in 1 drink!  - Famous Fizz - \u00a0St. George absinthe, strawberry-thyme shrub, cream, egg white, seltzer - I'm in love.   \u00a0 \u00a0 Good service, reasonable price, yummy food, tasty drinks, what else would you want? \u00a0I came for The Mayor's Brunch @TheDapperDiner, and I should have came before this!

I actually recommended this place since I knew it was really low-key, chill, and we can actually hear each other's voices (Def. hard in SF). I used to go here a lot right after school with some classmate. However this time, I literally stood at the bar for 20 minutes and the bartenders avoided eye contact and pretended they were busy. \u00a0The place wasn't even crowded! Just wondering if there were a change of management or something but this place doesn't seem to be the same great place it used to be. Just saying. I guess after reading some of the reviews here, it makes sense now. \u00a0I won't be back.",

That's what puzzles me about this place. \u00a0The dark wood and general sense of refinement kind of suggest both NYC and some level of sophistication, yet my experiences here have been...not that. \u00a0Like I said, it's perfect for mid-stupor drunkenness with FiDi coworkers who are on the verge of being fired. \u00a0It also works well for when you see a pack of skinheads at 1:30 after being thrown out of the Green Tortoise and you want to have a last drink...with them. \u00a0Also, if you are not a mess it could probably work for a pre-dinner drink. \u00a0I don't know anyone in that genre, though.",

BUT - man, their drinks are GOD AWFUL. \u00a0I have no idea what all the rave is about. \u00a0  I was with a large group of friends this past Sat. night, and all of us were in agreement - their drinks sucked. From the syrupy, concentrated, sweet cocktails on their menu (tried Suckerbunch, White Elephant, Pimms), \u00a0to poorly done (color, taste, smell were off mark) standards like Manhattans, Old Fashioneds and Aviations, \u00a0 this is no true mixologist joint. \u00a0Even my Irish Coffee was served in a snifter glass - right, because people love directly cupping a steaming hot glass in their hand, since the stem is \u00a0too short to hold with your fingers, esp when completely full and top heavy! \u00a0A snifter is not made for such things! \u00a0If you don't have a glass coffee mug for such a drink, then just say so. So literally, I tried about 7 drinks here, \u00a0all of which had problems.   Maybe we're spoiled by the awesomeness of Hog N' Rocks, our usual go-to for specialty drinks - now those guys work some magic. Maybe they had a new bartender, maybe the bartender was drunk. In any case, when I am here, I'll just be ordering beer, wine, or something straight; something that they can't f*-k up.  Oh - they did have this alcoholic milk beverage with warm chocolate cookies dish for the holidays that was quite yums - we devoured those. So perhaps I will try more food next time.",

It was okay, but it could be the fact my expectations were raised from the short rib sliders...or they were simply just okay.   The poutine was tasty, but could have been less cheesy. My French-Canadian friend would most likely turn his snobby nose up and slide his plate away, but I still thought it was okay. Again, perhaps my expectations have been raised by trying the poutine at Salt House (made with short rib gravy). See the connection to my lust for short ribs?  Get the pork belly. That was really good! Crispy top, but soft, melt in your mouth, perfectly cooked pork all around.  The place is loud, but perhaps that's part of its charm? I'm not talking about Maria Sharapova 120 db screaming level, but it's close.   Go for the food, choose your drinks wisely, bring a flash light, and expect to leave happy.",

Since its hidden in an alley way off Broadway, I may not have otherwise discovered it. The hors d'oeuvres here are super yummy, I love the pulled pork sliders. The drink menu is very unique and different from any other bar menu Ive seen. There are some foreign whiskeys and other liquor that cant be bought in regular stores and its really fantastic- if you're into that sort of thing. Try the 'Golden Triangle' or ask one of the bartenders to make you something they'd recommend. They know what they're doing and they're all really nice.   I hosted a big birthday party for myself and a friend here last August. We had probably around 50-70 friends come, and it was the perfect \u00a0drinking spot. Not too crowded, there are plenty of comfortable tables and booths to sit at. There's a jukebox with all sorts of good music to choose from. It's a pretty classy place. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone!",

So there is one blonde and one brunette waitress. I think the blonde was training the brunette. The brunette was really sweet and friendly whereas the blonde was kinda bitchy. So anyways we get seated and we get served water right away with menus. It takes about 15 min for them too come take our orders. Now it takes roughly 30 min for us to get just our drink orders. We close the tab and head over to kells.   I really wanted to try the food here but it would have taken forever.   I hope the blonde shared some if her tip to the brunette because she deserved all of it.",

First thing we did was go order a coors light and a corona...and man did I feel like an idiot...Because they don't even carry those- just their own kinds of beers!! But hey- don't judge, it happens...   I actually love that we ended up at this speakeasy type bar with your not-so-average drinks; it's nice to switch it up. I had the 'session lager' all night- deeeelish. Looks similar to a red stripe bottle. Luckily we found a couple tables for all of us to collaborate at, and it was just perfect for a close gathering of friends with some great 'people watching' going on. You never get bored playing that game in SF.. lets be honest.   I only gave it 4 stars for the ridiculously looooong wait I had at the bar to order 2 beers for a friend and I. Honestly... it was worth it for the atmosphere of the place, and the uniqueness of this bar, but I must have waited at LEAST 10-15 minutes to even be looked at. I suggest ordering 2 rounds when you go up, and sacrificing the warmth of the 2nd beer, just because losing quality time with your group for that long (just for 1 beer) seems bloody wrong...!!!!",

This left me a little disappointed as ol' Gordon couldn't cut through the Carpano and Chartreuese, leaving the whole thing a little too heavy in mouthfeel. Still, a fine cocktail.  The Buck and Breck held my attention quite well--Cognac with sparkling wine, bitters and absinthe. Short and serious in a tiny sugar-rinsed glass, it was the perfect end to my evening.  Nice back-alley ambiance, low-lit and mellow with friendly staff. My biggest complaint was the peppered clientele--wasn't really feeling warm vibes from my fellow tipplers, rather a bit of \"I don't know you and I'm also too drunk to care\" vibe, but that could be an isolated experience.

I mean, if you can tear yourself away from the strip clubs that are 500 feet away, then you'd discover that 15 Romolo is that kind of place that'll leave you pleasantly surprised: it's located on a residential street, a little hidden from the main \"action\" of Broadway. Don't be confused because there's no signage, but keep walking until you get to an open doorway and find yourself in a soft lit bar with lots of dark wood seating.   The cocktail list is very promising: comprised of house cocktails and inspired classics, priced at $10 and $9, respectively. There were too many things going on in my head and I wanted to try it ALL: between good quality spirits (Hangar One, Four Roses Bourbon, etc) and ingredients like ginger syrup, egg whites, it was a dilemna. So I boldly told the bartender: \"make me something with fresh juice and gin.\" \u00a0She concocted a drink (the name escapes me) but it was overly sweet with too much blueberry puree. I was very apologetic on returning the drink to the bartender but all she said was, \"hey no problem, I'd be happy to make you one that you like!\" \u00a0Great customer service, I like that!  Their Bijou cockatil was more up my alley: made with a London dry gin, carpano antica vermouth, yellow chartreuse and orange bitters. Delish!   If you've got the munchies, the kitchen is open until 1:30am. How cool is that? In a sleepy city like SF, that is a huge plus! I got the Kennebec fries with curry ketchup and ranch sauce. Super hot off the fryer, so be careful and don't burn your tongue.  I can already see myself frequenting 15 Romolo often. It's fruitless to resist the urge not to go back.",

Well done Rome-Alone. \u00a0You'll be out of business in no time. \u00a0:-)",

But I grew to like it. Famous Fizz was my least fav out of all three, it tasted like black licorice, blechh. It had this foam on top that we guessed was made from egg white.. tasted weird. We came back again at the end of the night and got the chips and hearts of palm dip. It was so yummy, with chunks of hearts of palm in the dip -- it's a perfect snack food for when everyone's just hanging out!   Overall, I liked the atmosphere! We came on a weekday night, and there were still a decent amount of people. It was spacious and lighting was dim, noise level was not quiet, but not too loud, conducive for good conversations over drinks.

    "review_text": "15 Romolo is actually the non-creative name of this dark, casual, but pretty cool drinking and apps establishment. Why?  Because that is the address of it, 15 Romolo Place. Romolo is one of the shortest streets in SF, also one of its non-flatest.   Romolo, sounding like a brother of Romulus and Remus who built Rome, is in the heart of San Francisco's historic sub-cultures that influenced the nation. It rises briefly and nearly straight up above the bright lights of Broadway, amidst the remaining old strip clubs first made famous by Carol Doda (well maybe her 44 double D's were more famous) at the Condor Club in the early 1960's. \u00a0She was the mother of all topless joints.   Back then topless was rare anywhere (now, if you've seen one, you've seen two!), and it was the erotic transition period between the Go Daddy-o black beret Beatnik days in upper Grant and North Beach of Jack Kerouac to the on coming social phenomenon of the Flower Children Hippy days of Haight-Ashbury, with its own San Francisco centered musical explosion of Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, Santana and others.  That period of Doda, when Mod was the fashion and the Beatles were just coming across the pond, had it's own Iconic symbols of San Francisco's embrace of the free spirited. There was Mort Saul at the Hunrgry I comedy club, with visits from legends like Lenny Bruce and Phylis Diller. The Mitchell Brothers were making Pornos like \"Behind the Green Door\" with Marilyn Chambers, the Ivory Soap pure girl (RIP). There used to be a freeway entrance (pre-Loma Prieta earthquake) to the Embarcadero freeway at the east end of Broadway, where you would pass Go-Go girls dancing in cages outside the clubs on Broadway.   If you look at the sign of the building at 15 Romolo, it says the Basque Hotel. This space used to be a very popular, wait in line all the time, family style Basque restaurant. It was a little secret gem of foodies in the 80's, who could sit on long tables family style with strangers, before it became tagged as the \"Community Table\" of more chi-chi places today, and imbibe on generous pourings of red wine and hearty Basque dishes of legs of lamb and other Spanish mountain delights.   Today, it is the same space, but now more of a quiet, dimly lit, popular \"secret\" hideaway to the 30 something singles of San Francisco. Gone are the community tables, but the wood floors and decor are still here. And besides an interesting and creative drink menu that is de rigueur for any SF hot spot, but with concoctions that would be scoffed at by any true, independently minded Basque, it offers pretty good little eclectic dishes, apps that hint at least to the concept of Tapas-like dishes of the previous restaurant's region, if not the actual ingredients and delivery.   We had chicken wings covered with a Thai curry sauce (not exactly Basque or Tapas), and pomme de terre frittes, er I mean french fries. Table service was friendly by the solo gal working that night.   This place has a low key vibe, quite unlike its previous incarnation of boisterous revery by a proud Basque heritage of hearty and independent mountain men with red cheeks full from red wine and red meat.   It has morphed into a semi-hipster, androgynous, post-yuppie puppy feel of a Valencia street dive bar, but without the drunken rancor. It \u00a0actually could be a nice drink place for a date amongst Yelp friends or on-line first daters form Match dot com, the 2 electronic trends born in The City that are currently transforming San Francisco and the country.  Sort of like Carol Doda's twin 44 DDs.   History sometimes repeats itself, if you know anything of the past.   If you want a hidden gem for Basque Food in a town nearby with San in its name, ask me.",

It becomes easy to spot when you search for the \"Basque Hotel\" sign. I love the vintage style decor and the wide selection of drinks/cocktails, but it's not a place with a huge draft beer selection (only 4 on tap). We ordered a few shots and they came in puny little half-shot glasses, at full-two-dollar-sign price. So that was a little disappointing. It's also not a great place for groups (I came on a Saturday night). Some tables definitely cleared out within 30 minutes of me getting there, but I wouldn't recommend coming with more than 4 people. I usually try to avoid bar food, and I did successfully that time, but it actually looked quite tasty. Overall 15 Romolo has a laid back charm with stiff drinks and attractive clientele.

Serious no no. But somehow it worked, especially once combined with the agave nectar and chili and sugar and salt rim. The result was something between a whiskey sour and a margarita.  I swear their new food menu is designed to make you drink more! It is savory deliciousness, from the smoked pork sliders to the jambalini (little croquettes served in a creole aioli).

The Wharf, The Marina, and broadway/Columbus are my least favorite areas in the entire city. \u00a0That being said, I loved this bar!   It wasn't too crowded.  The crowd was a good mix of locals, commuters, youngish, older folks, etc.  The atmosphere was great. \u00a0There was plenty of seating. \u00a0It was an older bar with decor along the same lines of bourbon an branch, but more authentic and understated. \u00a0  The service sucked. \u00a0Our waitress was probably having a horrible day (I am assuming), but she really really really sucked. \u00a0Because the bartenders were so awesome and tried to make up for her horrible service, I won't fault the bar in anyway for her mistake.  The music was good. \u00a0Lots of the good 80s rock (not the same old overplayed bands either), and newish rock, and a variety of eclectic music. \u00a0There was no bad pop, or Top 40 on the day we went.  They served food. \u00a0Most fancy cocktail bars don't serve food. \u00a0Bar Agricole and Comstock Saloon are more restaurant than bar IMHO. \u00a015 Romolo is unique in this respect. \u00a0The only other bar I can think of like this Alembic, but the food, atmosphere and drinks are better here.  Their food is gastropub fare (sliders, hot dogs, burgers, salads, chicken and biscuit, etc.). \u00a0It is unique, fresh, and executed quite well. \u00a0 I like their food better than Alembic and Monk's Kettle. \u00a0   The drinks were awesome. I had the lambo (nice and tart/bitter), the Pimms Cup (balanced/refreshing), the Buffalo Nickel (Great Heavy hitting bourbon drink). \u00a0 \u00a0All were great! \u00a0The Pimms Cup was the best version I have had of that drink anywhere.  I think one reviewer mentioned that the drinks were bad. \u00a0One look at the menu will let you know that there is a serious bartender managing the cocktail menu. Just because the menu is good, doesn't mean the execution is, but when we went, the execution was solid. \u00a0I thought the refreshing offerings were balanced and refreshing and the more potent heavy hitting drinks were also balanced but heavy hitting. Each drink had a clear identity. \u00a0None of the drinks I had were overly sweet, nor did they have that one annoying out of place ingredient, nor were they watered down tasting by any measure.  To each their own I guess.",

I did find the moroccan fried chickpeas a bit bland. \u00a0Really hard to get the taste/texture of the tiny sized chickpeas when they are fried.  Cocktails were solid.  The Spaghetti Western with fresh tomato juice was smooth and subtle (I opted for tequilla instead of rye in mine). \u00a0The Track42 was delicious as well, with the egg white giving it a froth like head similar to the pisco sour.  We wrapped up our tour of the menu with a pitcher of house made sangria. \u00a0Dangerously fantastic, and a nice cocktail while the sun is still up.",

And there was a secret passage way that you found by either:  1) burning a tree 2) pushing a rock 3) blowing up a wall  And then after you revealed the passage a little 8 note song was played? I had that song in my head when we found 15 Romolo, even though I had seen where it was on the map, because it's mildly hidden. (Ok, there is a bright neon sign that says 15 Romolo that you can see from Broadway, but ... still, hidden!)  Anyway, once you find it, you are in for a treat as they have a a far number of delicious, ingenious, and slightly out of the ordinary cocktails to chose from. These are created with standard liqours and mixers, as well as magic potions from jars and bottles of mysterious origin. You just have to trust what's going on and enjoy!",

    "review_text": "SHHHHHH! This is one of San Francisco's BEST kept secrets...  Hidden near the seedy XXX clubs, Roaring 20s and Hungry I and up an alley with a Chinese Community themed mural lies a diamond in the rough called 15 Romolo. From the outside, it looks like a shady back alley bar. However, if you can look past the sketchiness, you will find unique handcrafted cocktails that will give tickle your palate and gastronomic comfort fare that will satiate your inner fatassery cravings.  Last night, 3.22.11, my friend and I stopped by for an HH \"De-Stress\" Session because there's nothing like working hard and playing even harder, a mantra I live by everyday.  Similar to a western saloon, 15 Romolo is dark, rustic and unpretentious. The friendly and down-to-earth staff gives 15 Romolo a warm neighborhood feel while the Hipster crowd and 90s Hip Hop, R&amp;B and Light Rock Music gives it that modern touch.  I'm more of the \"Shots, Shots, Shots\" type of girl, but while looking over the cocktail list my eyes fixated on the Track 42 (Manuka Honey Vodka, Unfiltered Apple Juice, Lemon topped with Egg White) - $10. DELICIOUS!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip9nECwVVjfjulwrKisQ?select=Tku3G5_QfB7VLl4Ib28ZAQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip\u2026</a>   Although stiff, the Track 42 was seamlessly smooth, fresh, fruity and sweet with a punch of tartness from the lemon. The frothy egg white was the icing on the cake adding a light and airy creaminess. It was so good, I had to stop myself after the third one...after all it was only a Tuesday.  Aside from 15 Romolo's hand crafted cocktails, they offer mouth-watering fare. We ordered the following:  *TEMPURA FRIED AVOCADO w/ Kewpie Mayo &amp; Togarashi ($5): \u00a0DELECTABLE!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip9nECwVVjfjulwrKisQ?select=FYWFFsM8OIQtHUbYI5yOVA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip\u2026</a>  The huge spears of ripen avocado were tempura battered and fried to a light golden brown. The light and airy crust was the perfect texture contrast to the soft buttery avocados. The kewpie mayo was thick and creamy with a slight kick from the togarashi, although it would have benefited from a touch of citrus to help balance the richness.  *CHICKEN WINGS \"BORICUAS\" w/ Chili Sauce, Coconut Cream, Lime &amp; Cilantro ($8): MOUTH-WATERING! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip9nECwVVjfjulwrKisQ?select=uwvO0SfiIVicHx5LSas3Tg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip\u2026</a>  The GINORMOUS wings were fried to a deep golden brown. Wonderfully crisp (not greasy), the wings were succulent and tender. The combo of chili, coconut, lime and cilantro gave it an exotic Thai influence with savory, creamy, sweet, spicy, tangy, and earthy elements.   *YO-MAMA STYLE BURGER w/ Peanut Butter &amp; Applewood Smoked Bacon ($9): SINFULLY GOOD! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip9nECwVVjfjulwrKisQ?select=0i-OaUD5Pjj_YKeQukdX1w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/m0ip\u2026</a>  Nestled inside the soft toasted bun was a moist and juicy beef patty that was generously slathered with creamy peanut butter and crowned with two thick slices of crisp bacon. Initially, the peanut butter may sound like an odd accoutrement, but it works surprisingly well with the burger. The burger was already rich and beefy with a prominent smokiness from the bacon, but the layer of gooey peanut butter gave it a nutty decadence with a hint of sweetness that set it off the charts!  With my tummy or shall I say, gut full and my mouth full of giggles, our HH \"De-Stress\" Session was COMPLETE!  I was born and raised in San Francisco and it's hidden gems like 15 Romolo that makes me feel like I'm still a tourist (minus the fanny pack) in this city. Most importantly, it's one of many the reasons WHY my heart will always be in San Francisco...",

    "review_text": "We came to the bar pretty early around 7:30ish and it was pretty empty. The tables are placed along the side of the walls, so there is a giant open space in the middle.  The ambiance is nice for a date, it's pretty dark, so if you are a visual eater, I'm not sure this will be appealing to you, but if your date isn't too great looking I'm sure you'll definitely enjoy this spot.  The waitress took our order, but she didn't write anything down. Nervous as I was I had high hopes that she would get my order right- she didn't.  It was ok, I just ate it anyway because service is quite slow here if you are expecting to eat your meal at a table, and I didn't want to wait another 20-25 minutes to get my food.  I ordered the brisket sliders, and it was OK. I thought my burger was pretty bland, and extremely messy to eat, as pieces of brisket spilled out of their buns and onto my plate. I didn't dislike the burger, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  Collectively as a group, we ordered a salad, shrimp + corn bread, and french fries. The salad was pretty good, it had a tangy dressing but it was not overwhelming.   The shrimp + cornbread was also decent, it was heavily drizzled with some creamy orange sauce, which in turn made the cornbread quite soggy. The shrimp was really good, but I didn't want to be a jerk and eat all the shrimp, but the cornbread itself wasn't that great. It was a little too mushy for my taste.  The fries were the best part of the dish for me. They are well peppered, so I guess if you don't like black pepper you wouldn't really enjoy this side. I however, LOVE black pepper so I thought it was probably the best and the most well season dish of the night.  My friend ordered the Primms cup, and I had a little sip of hers. I'm not usually an alcohol drinker, but this one was pretty good. It was reminiscent of a mojito, because it was fizzy and carbonated, but it was not minty. It was almost like a ice tea soda.",

It is in fact \"dark\" I must give it that. The music seemed to be looping on repeat, if music's important to you. The waitress that served us was cute an mostly on the ball (she missed my order for the pork sliders and when she did bring them, she brought only one instead of two)... but it was loud and busy so I can forgive her for that. but the sliders were yummy and so were the fries. I was with good company so I had fun, but I dunno if I would go there otherwise.   btw, the \"darkness\" also seemed to be the perfect cover for couples who wanna place to drink and make out ;)",

I came here several months back, to meet up with two Seattle Yelpers that had also moved down to SF, where we shared an order of fries, hush puppies, and a pitcher of sangria. And, well, while the hush puppies weren't anything to write home about (but then again, I'm rarely impressed by hush puppies, so), both the fries and the sangria were quite tasty.  If only they were accessible!  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - So, like I said before, this place is hardly the picture of accessibility. Once you're inside though (some of the staff inside kindly lifted me in and out), the venue is quite spacious, so seating isn't a problem.

It was refreshing, with a nice zip of ginger notes and just enough sweetness to help round out the drink.   There was a complimentary \"waffle shot\", basically a piece of waffle in a small syrup container. Little did we know it was an adult version, so what we thought was maple syrup ended up being kahula or some sort of liquer! It was not a mouthful I initially liked but it grew on me once I knew.   Overall Thoughts  I will be back to see what else 15 Romolo has to offer",

Unique drink menu, with plenty of whiskey/bourbon based concoctions that are not too sweet (don't worry, it's not a drink menu with rum-y tropical drinks or godiva martinis). And, their happy hour goes until 7pm! Good deals on sangria and pimm's cups. Food was also very tasty, and we liked that they offer different sized orders for some items, which made sharing easy. Recommend the pork sliders, watermelon salad, fries (these were excellent!). Everyone else really liked the hot dogs wrapped in bacon and deep fried in a tortilla :), but they were a little much for me. Only downside of this place is that it is small and very loud, but overall a great find. We'll be back!",

There's an interesting mural across from it with a man with pipes coming out of the spot where his crotch would be. Easy to miss, unless you know what you are looking for.  Their specialty cocktails are delicious and strong - $9. They're special, so they take a little time to make. If you order one of these, watch them mix and match concoctions [from bottles, unlabeled jars, etc] at the bar. They must be magical! By the end of the night, I probably sampled all of the drinks on the specialty menu. Gotta love those birthday drinks! Everyone just wanted to see me stumble down the alley and into Hungry I by mistake... Didn't happen though.  It wasn't too crowded for a Saturday night, and we pretty much took over the place with the party.   Random Notes: Tuesday Night is movie night. The women's restroom [lit only by one tiny bulb] is down a hallway, while the men's room is right there. You can bring food inside. And I mean, the bar, but if you like food in the bathroom, I don't think they would care.",

Inside, the soon to be remodeled interior is already pretty nice. The bar wraps around the corner the way your arm goes around your date. Stop by on a weekday and 15 Romolo is a quiet place to park for the evening. Swing by on a weekend, and it's a party that everyone's invited to. Only that everyone didn't RSVP so it's cozy and intimate. But unlike a typical clubby type bar, there is no Patron. There is Tesoro and it's better than Patron.   We also threw a party here. The owner Scott (likes Tesoro) was more than accommodating and priced the hosting very reasonably. The entire evening was an incredible experience, filled with first class bar service, roomy accommodations, great music, and fantastic staff company. Coming from a culinary background, Scott promises food in the future (they just installed some kitchen ware which include 2 deep fryers and grill). I can't wait.  15 Romolo, I heart you.

The single bar located around the back wall of 15 Romolo only had 2 bartenders to attend an estimated of 100 plus people. It took literally half an hour plus to get one of their attentions and even then, you would have to wait for them to make your drink after a list of others.

There's nothing around here!\"  We found the entrance, almost passed it - \u00a0atop a couple steps to an unembellished doorway. \u00a015 Romolo is exactly the kind of place a 'burbs girl like me looks for to break up the routine of suburban life. \u00a0There's really nothing fancy about this place, but it has a very understated, unexpected cool vibe that is very present as soon as you walk in. \u00a0  In its spacious, dark interior, with the a faint glow of the neon lights outside, I browse the libations menu to find some very intriguing choices. \u00a0I go for a Yellow Rose - made with tequila, apricot liqueur, yellow chartreuse, lemon &amp; egg white. \u00a0The foam from the egg white put a yummy mustache on me - instant hipster! \u00a0At first sip, I knew I was going to want another one. \u00a0With a name so appropriate, my drink was concocted with delicate purpose - pretty to look at, but it has enough prickle to keep your swigging attention. \u00a0My cohorts for the night were happy with their more conventional drinks - A Gingerson and an Old Fashioned, both very satisfactory and worth the subsequent round(s)(s)(s). \u00a0And the bartender was nice enough to create a tasty muddled drink for our DD - she said it was really refreshing. \u00a0:)  To my fellow Yelpers, thank you for keeping me looking and feeling so COOL by keeping me in the know about great places like 15 Romolo. \u00a0It was a great stop as a precursor to dinner and we can't wait to go back!",

Also, whatever 'ketchup' sauce they served it with tasted totally bizarre and we left them pretty much untouched.  Our waiter was very nice but forgot the pork chop entree and 2nd cocktail order for a long time (we were already done eating the burger) so was very very kind to comp the pork for us. He did, however, recommend the venison tartar to my father. My dad had a few small bites of the tartar and stopped - he wasn't enjoying it and no one else wanted to try it.  Unfortunately, a couple hours later my father began to experience the worst case of food poisoning he has EVER had in his life and is still extremely ill. We had to rush him to the doctor who advised that wild game such as venison/deer is likely to contain high levels of bacteria (vs. cleaner, farmed meat) and SHOULD NOT BE CONSUMED RAW.  When I called the restaurant to advise them today, they seemed surprised and thanked me for informing them. They asked me to send an email for them to follow up with me about. Will see how they respond.  DO NOT ORDER THE TARTAR!",

We then quickly decided to start off with an order of smoked pork sliders, a grass-fed burger with apple wood smoked bacon, and an order of fresh kennebec fries with madras curry catsup. \u00a0The wait wasn't too long, and the food was great. \u00a0I ate the porked sliders while my friend raved about the burger. \u00a0The fries were creative, especially the madras curry catsup; which I haven't tried before. \u00a0  We strangely ordered again, to try each others dishes... I was too curious about the burger. \u00a0It was good, and possibly one of the best for $6. \u00a0I started to feel that bit of absinthe by the end of dinner, pretty interesting. $60 total w/ tip for a couple excellent drinks and plenty of good food. \u00a0I was somewhat glutted after that, but that can often happen on a culinary jaunt.",

That must mean something, because it definitely takes more effort than usual to find, let alone access the place!  Once inside, we had to really speak up to get a waiter's attention, since it was pretty busy that night. However, glad that we did, because everything we had there that evening was delicious and humorously titled -- they serve such cocktails as \"Santa's Suckerpunch\" or \"Penelope Cruz\" (described with such taglines in the menu as \"Don't mess with the Claus\" and \"More Volver than Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona\" respectively!).  They also serve small plates and sandwiches. That's the issue about going places just for drinks, having already eaten dinner -- not knowing there's also food served.

I'm a fan of the Rio Grande - Don Julio reposado, bulleit bourbon, lemon, lime, ginger/seville/agave syrup and a chili-sugar-salt rim. You can sip these stunners with stand-out snacks like pulled pork sliders or jambalaya croquettes. All bar bites are $6 and under. No typo.  15 Romolo hasn't lost any of its evocative moodiness.

I had gone just a couple of times while living in SF four-ish years ago and have been jonesing to return ever since--though I wasn't sure if I was overhyping the place in my imagination or not. I remembered the bar as hidden, crowded, and sexy; the cocktails as excellently-crafted; and the bar eats as decently addicting (actually, I'm pretty sure something I ate here once was actually UNDERcooked... yet somehow I end up craving the food here. What?). Anyway, I recently had the pleasure of confiming my romantic notions of the place. North Beach is way hard to get out to whenever I'm in town, but after a jazz show the other night, I was super excited to have some time to stop here for a nightcap on our way home. The Sleepy Jean (chamomile-infused bourbon, lemon nectarine compote, bitters) definitely rocked me to sleep, in a good way--but not before allowing me some great people-watching entertainment on the floor of the bar (though it's a pretty diverse crowd, the one commonality is that peoples be gettin' DRUNK). I was loving the loungey, speakeasy-like vibe as much as I remembered. Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise our credit card was accidentally left behind here that night? Because it meant we had to go back a couple days later to retrieve it, this time during the day. And I got to sample the biscuits and gravy (yum), a ridiculously strong cup of punch, as well as a complimentary shot of french toast soaked in some kind of alcohol passing for maple syrup. The bartenders here are also pretty nice and not snotty (for some reason I expected them to be at a place like this... proven wrong once again, judge-y self!).  Bars very rarely get 5 stars from me.

Bartenders are super cool and if you engage in conversation, they'll probably hook you up with a taste of something inventive on the fly. They have a great selection of booze and beer mixed cocktails. The chef is new and the menu is super inventive, making this place on the leading edge of food and beverage in SF.   It has a cool atmosphere, chill dark and fun, so at night it really is a fun place. It can be crowded and 10 minutes later, not at all.   Definitely a noteworthy place to check out. On the edge of Chinatown in an alley, so look close or you'll miss it, and if you do, you'll be sad you did.",

My friends also had the wings before, and they tasted very good but are too spicy for me personally. Drinks have always been good, and bartenders are awesome.

Let me back up a bit- this is probably not the fairest of judgements ever placed. But a seedy location can make for some seedy characters...  We arrived around 9:15p last night for a nice cocktail before a night out. I have only heard good things about 15 Romolo, so I figured we'd for sure be in for a treat...We got the trick instead.  We walked up to the door and a balding, middle-aged man stood out front. The first two ladies in our group showed him their IDs, and walked in. It was then my turn, and I showed it to him as well. He held it a little longer than most, and something registered in my brain that this was a little weird. Then my other friend came in. He started asking her questions about her ID, and making comments, WHEN SHE NOTICED ANOTHER MAN WAS FILMING HER ID WITH HIS IPHONE OVER HER SHOULDER. Later, once discovering who the REAL bouncer was, we told him our story. I hope those sorry sons of b*tches got kicked out.  Anywho, we then approached the bar area to be severely oogled at by a couple. We all determined it might have been Swingers night at 15 Romolo.  The staff was super friendly and attentive (not to mention rather good looking), though I didn't much care for my \"surprise\" of a cocktail. (I don't recommend the Hayride.) I'm kinda bummed that I didn't love it.  The final WEIRD note was a group of guys that immediately approached us and tried to convince us that we were vampires. Weirdest effing conversation of my life.",

It's hidden in an alley in North Beach and it might be hard to find if you don't know to look for the sign for the Basque Hotel which is right next to it. Inside it's super dark and kinda looks like a hipster's dream bar. There isn't a lot of seating so if you are coming for food and want a table, prepare to wait. \u00a0My friends and I got pretty lucky and got two tables for six of us to squeeze in.   We ordered a bunch of dishes to share:  Pork Tenderloin - My favorite dish of the night! I loved the flavor of the pork belly and how it was cooked. The dish was also presented very nicely!  Cheeseburger w/ Peanut Butter &amp; Bacon - Sounds weird but it was SO good. Definitely my second favorite dish of the night.   Roasted Bone Marrow - This dish wasn't worth getting. There was barely any bone marrow to eat so we were mostly eating the dungeness crab on top.  Grilled Shrimp Flatbread - I really liked the flavor of this flatbread, it was a very strong taste.   Steamed Manila Clams - Pretty good dish! There were lots of clams and the spicy sausages inside added a lot of flavor. The soup was also delicious and I wish we had more bread to dip into it!  Romolo Poutine - Delicious! I love fries so it's hard for them to go wrong with this dish.   We also ordered a few drinks, the Pimm's cup and some beer. The. Pimm's cup was delicious! Too delicious so it wasn't very strong. I would definitely get it if you want a light drink :)  The only issue we had with the place was how loud it was. We came here too late for dinner ( around 7:30pm ) so it was super loud and we could barely hear each other and talk. So if you come here for dinner, I suggest coming earlier to avoid the loudness of the bar. If you're coming just to drink, the noise is probably fine. Overall, the food and drinks here are great and it is definitely a cool place to hang out with friends.",

The amazing part of this place is its super friendliness, a neighborhood feel while even on a holiday, this place got quite busy.

Took some nice pictures by the window facing the alley as well as taking a moment taking some fun pictures at the photo booth. Of course the good old jukebox was a nice working gesture.  Tried out almost all the different hot dogs to feel American, as well as pork sliders, and the fun vegan version of chicken wings, in which I asked if it was just going to be the sauce, it's not but with some very delicious and spicy chili lime deep fried (was that bananas?)",

The menu was, like Romolo, a refreshingly different and welcome departure from typical brunch fare...yet was based on familiar dishes:  - Waffle shots with bourbon - Chilaquiles with chorizo, avocado, cotija cheese and tomatoes on blue chips - French toast with bacon, bananas, cranberries and walnuts And of course, mimosas. Duh.  Everything. was. AMAZING.  Like, I was in love.  Throw in an old school photo booth, jukebox, parlor-inspired dark wood paneling and leather benches, and you've got the ultimate blend of quirk and classic sophistication.  You see...  Romolo doesn't have to try too hard. You just have to be perceptive enough to spot it, walk in, and be amazed.   Just like the girl in the hoodie whom you may not have otherwise noticed, but is everything you never knew you always wanted.",

This bar makes my heart all warm and happy. It scores a 3 out of the 3 Must-Have points to be qualified as a fantastic drinking establishment:  1) A Jukebox that makes my legs quiver. Saint Etienne, Arcade Fire, Desmond Dekker, The Jam, Mr. Bowie. I could pretty much pump $20 into that baby and have total control of the music selection for the entire night. And have. Muahahahah! 2) Nice Beer Selection. Belgian Beers. Yes Please. They even come in those snazzy goblet-style glasses. Which are deceptively heavy so they don't fall over when one of your friends remembers they took Tae Kwon Do when they were seven and wants to show off their moves.  3) If you get there early, you get a seat. Works great for after work with the girls, or to play kissy face with the boy. Gets a tad crowded after 10. I could see it becoming a little annoying if the crowd gets annoying, but that's when you move on to Spec's.",

That can be good when you're looking for an undiscovered city hangout, but not when you're trying to meet waiting friends on time. Good thing to remember: Fresno Street, which is much more visible from the main streets, intersects Romolo. There's a parking lot in the alley and a garage a few blocks away, for those driving.  Inside it's a bit on the small side, with hardwoods in not so great condition. It gets cramped, humid and hot easily. Beers are $6 and limited. The bathroom for women is only one stall, no mirrors, with an airplaine-style lock that is stuck on \"vacant\"... and for some reason they put it in the corridor that leads straight out into the trash. Twenty women all lined up outside, disheveled and doing the pee-pee dance, and the trash alley right in front of you... and soon public urination doesn't sound like such a bad option.",

It'll be average noise level 60% of the time, until someone chooses a song on the juke box, which BLASTS music, then you can't hear a thing.  Server was cool. I was deciding between the pretty pretty pisco and the pimm's cup, told her I like light fruity girly drinks, and she immediately said get the pretty pretty pisco. She said if I didn't like it they'd replace my drink =).  While I did like the pretty pretty pisco, i liked the pimm's cup better and ended up swapping with my friend. Our server didn't notice nor bring up the aforementioned agreement.  * pimm's cup $9 (featuring homemade ginger syrup brewed by a ginger fairy choice: anything but scotch, pimm's, cucumber, mint, lemon juice, ginger, bitters, soda water): 4 stars I love ginger cocktails. Always. This one was no exception. Great light refreshing flavor. Only complaint is it's almost too light in alcohol - and I'm a major lightweight so this must've tasted like water to my friends.  * pretty pretty pisco $10 (extra cute way to ask for an extra good drink: macchu pisco, golan muscato, lemon juice, cucumber, blueberries): 3 stars While this sounds like a great mixture of light fruit flavors, it actually came out a little dense and heavy on my palate. The drink was a little too strong for me - hence me swapping for the pimms cup.  * hemingway daiquiri (always do sober what you said you'd do drunk: appleton white rum, maraschino, lime juice, grapefruit juice): 2 stars Way, way too strong! My friend couldn't finish this. And she's NOT a lightweight like me.",

I definitely recommend this drink. For my second drink, I decided to tell the bartender what I liked and let him concoct something for me. I told the bartender that I wanted something with elderflower and also discussed other qualities I wanted in my drink. I did not like at all what he gave me. It was something with champagne and elderflower liqueur (don't remember what else), but I didn't get any elderflower flavor and it had an unpleasant taste to it. I wanted to give another bartender another try for my third drink because I thought that second one might have been a fluke. So I asked someone else for a different elderflower drink. This time I got something with vodka. Again, I didn't get any elderflower flavor and wasn't particularly pleased with the drink. It wasn't as bad this time, but I still wasn't satisfied. I'm sad to say I left pretty disappointed with the drinks here.  They have a photo booth in one corner of the bar, which was fun. This may have been the one redeeming quality... which, given that this is a bar, is kind of sad.  To be fair, I haven't tried the food here and would be down to try it.

The \"Track 42\" AKA \"The Frothy One with the Leaf on Top\"- (manuka honey vodka, apple juice, lemon topped with egg white and a basil leaf) is something I only wish I had the skills to recreate.   The food that they dish up is just as appealing...maybe even better...maybe. Between the tempura fried avocados, the peanut butter and bacon burger, and the Nutella pancake ballz with brown butter ice cream and snookie dust...you just cannot go wrong. Ever. This place is an experience that's unique, inventive, decadent and entertaining.  Read more about this place on my blog",

Their menu consists of delicious bites that you don't see very often.   Both times that I went, I ordered the Yo-Mama Burger, which is a burger topped with bacon AND peanut butter! Needless to say, I inhaled it within 3 seconds each time. I also ordered the Bone Marrow Fritters, which are deep fried balls of bone marrow. They were also delicious, but a bit overwhelming. Regardless, I would still order them again. For drinks, I ordered a Pimm's Cup and a Gin and Tonic. They make their Gin and Tonics strong, yum!  The thing that I love most about the place is its atmosphere. It's pretty small and it looks like an old bar from the 50s. They even have a nifty old phone booth in the corner and cool menus.",

Man, I love trying new places.  Lately, I have become a fan of fine bourbon cocktails. I love slowly sipping on a Manhattan with liquored up cherries and I have yelp to blame for my new found favorite, as they often serve Manhattans and Old Fashioned at Yelp Events.  There was a great group of people there that night, stragglers from an office party, drunk and celebrating. We were entertained by a full on karaoke type sing along and air guitar solo to Sweet Child O' Mine, which was AWESOME. The jukebox selection was hawt. The overall vibe to this place was great and so were the bartenders and waitress.   I love 15 Romolo",

Grungy, dark, with 80's music in the background, 15 Romolo is a hidden jewel at an obscure alley in North Beach. The inside of the place is actually kind of cute: dimmed lights, iced windows, and a dark wood finish all throughout the bar which made it resemble a speakeasy. There's even an old-school juke box!  So, I haven't had sangrias since I was in high school and used to make them on Saturdays at a friend's beach house. Cheap wine + fruit as an underage drinker-- definitely \"happy times.\" 15 Romolo brought back some old memories while redefining what a real SANGRIA is supposed to taste like. IMHO I didn't think the drinks were thatttt strong. Our group ordered a round of Rio Grandes (tequila + bourbon: interesting combo) and a pitcher of sangria.   As great of a place 15 Romolo was (service, food, sangrias) I have to admit the bathroom was kind of disappointing. Like in a lot of my reviews, I mention that I am a little OCD and a neat freak, and tend to judge a place by the bathrooms. 15 Romolo's WASNT dirty in that there was toilet paper all over the ground and unkept, but it didn't have a \"clean\" VIBE. It was dimly lit like the restaurant and the bathroom decor was along the lines of rustic cottage? Then again... i tend to hold a special place in my heart for Nordstrom bathrooms. So if the point was to make the bathrooms fit that \"rustic/antique\" interior decor theme, my apologies.   ALL IN ALL: lot's of ample seating so great for groups &amp; bomb sangria. Don't chicken out like me and try the Pimm's Cup! I hear it's worth it",

The bar pretty much had me upon seeing the authentic 1950's hotel sign out front. \u00a0Let me just say I never venture to NB these days because the crowds are generally pretty douchey.   If we hadn't been coming with a crowd from the elite event at A5A Steak lounge, I'm sure it would have been close to empty. A shame- because it's such a find in this area. A place you almost don't want to tell anyone for fear that it will be overrun by lame asses come next month. But why not spread the love around?   The interior feels rustic, almost like you've stumbled into a chic \u00a0log cabin lounge- sans the taxidermy on the walls. \u00a0There is \u00a0tons of seating along the wall (big plus) with \u00a0unique yet simple lighting.   The service was super prompt- and we ordered the $6 burger, \u00a0($5?) pork sliders and the olives. Whatever they're doing in that kitchen back there- is phenomenal. By far the best bar bites I've had in a long time: the pork sliders come with a slaw and the meat is tangy and tender. The burger was equally devourable- and it was the perfect amount to share on a budget.   The \"pixie\" is by far my favorite drink of the moment- kind of a minty lemon drop- but better.

We became buddies with one of the bartenders, Chase - but we haven't seen him in a while, but the owner Scott works there often as well. Very hipster crowd, with a dash of some randoms as well (not being a hipster myself, I notice the fellow non-hipsters). It's also a great bar to take pretty much anyone who enjoys a good cocktail - I've taken my boss, my parents, my aunt, my girlfriends, and my boyfriends buddies - theres' something for everyone and the scene is pretty mellow.  The only reason I have to give Romolo a 4 star is because of the service. It will take you 10-15 minutes to get your drink in your hand, whether it's packed on a Saturday around 11 or whether you're the only one there on a Tuesday afternoon. I don't know why it takes them forever for their service...but you have to accept that it won't be a \"quick\" drink.  Definitely try the Hunters Flip, the Blackberry Rickey (if they have it), or ask your mixologist what base alcohol you like and if you like sweet or bitter and let them go wild.",

It took an hour and 15 minutes to get my food. the menu in no way describes the food. I ordered chilaquiles and it was basically a huge plate of nachos. The egg on top was fried hard, the black beans were a thin paste spread on the plate, a drizzle of the lime crema on top and no idea where the queso fresco was hiding but it wasn't on my plate. my friend had the biscuit and gravy which was worse, with the gravy tasting like it came out of can with some cayenne thrown in and so thick you could use it to cement bricks together. The breakfast biscuit sandwich was just as bad - the chicken was a small strip of chicken that was mostly batter and deep fried dark, a tiny swipe of the pesto was on the biscuit, the bacon looked like it'd been sitting out all morning and the hashbrowns were half soggy half burned. i've never criticized a restaurant publicly before but this was so horrendous, i had to. Waiting almost an hour and a half for a plate of chips is ridiculous, especially when the restaurant was only half full and the waiter and bus-person couldn't be bothered to notice. Oh and the bathroom is beyond disgusting - there is only one and it smells so badly of urine that had I actually had any food in my stomach, i would have thrown it up. Really the worst ever - I will never go back. if i cold give it zero stars i would!",

This Friday, it was a little packed, not too bad, and in all honesty, I've been lucky enough to never be here on a super packed day.  I got a few drinks, the bartender pours a great fernet shot with an interesting lime back...and he was super friendly to boot :) (and not in a creepy way either!) The bouncer was extremely nice, genuine and well read...random...and well, we got a comfortable booth right away, there was good music, and I could hear my friends talking to each other...what a strange idea...good conversation in a bar instead of shouting at the top of my lungs to convey monosyllabic words because a conversation would just be too much at that decibel level. \u00a0I hate that.  Either way, we met a cool local author, he gave us a copy of his book and invited us for a nightcap at his place up the block...that was amazing as well because I haven't spoken with someone that cool in a long time...really makes me feel as though the writing and underground community is still alive and kicking in the city :) \u00a0To actually connect with someone on an intelligent and normal level and have decent drunk convo...it's what I live for :)  four stars to you romolo...may you never change.",

It's no big deal, but it's not the finest location SF has to offer, so I thought you should know.  We had the brunch punch (that day it was called Velvet Pajamas), but I'm convinced they could put a concoction together with anything and it would probably taste good. They were also nice enough to give us a couple complimentary waffle shots ... which were spectacular.

Located in the middle of North Beach's strip club garishness, it manages to avoid that whole vibe and attracts those who enjoy great jukebox, darkened lighting, and well-mixed drinks. To find it you have to go up Romolo alley and look for Basque hotel sign, and the bar is right under it. This place is owned by the same people as Rye and A16 and it shows in the selection of spirits and decor.  I had my 1-year-in-SF anniversary party here and had a great time. The only downsides were the too-loud band that played for over an hour - but I'm told it's not a regular occurrence, and the bartender who seemed to ignore 3 of my hot female friends for over 15 minutes. The memorable drinks for me were Pixie, Sazerac (mixed very well), and the infamous Bunny Fuzz that gave much joy (and much hangover) to a lot of my friends. Seriously, don't judge the drink by the name (or color).  I will definitely come back to 15 Romolo, and hopefully this time the bartenders will figure out how to serve people in order.",

Onto the drinks, Amazing. \u00a0I would simply grab a huge meal elsewhere and drink it off here. \u00a0The cocktails are AMAZING. \u00a0I cannot go on more about the flavors, the surprises, the sheer taste of their drinks. \u00a0I'd go back there anytime for that and that is what kept me from really slamming them with 2 stars. \u00a0Go there with friends, it's a cool little joint, great drinks and just stay away from the food. \u00a0They should offer more drinks and just shut down the whole kitchen unless they are dedicated to making good food in it.",

It was a little strange - the closer it got to opening, the more transients were hanging out in the stoop. Then right at opening a crack head was yelling 'welcome to America!' I was a little surprised because my wife usually doesn't pick locations like that, but we got inside and my doubts were relieved.   It is known as a 'boozy brunch.' and it lives up to its expectations. The punch at the door was good, but very tart and sweet. I had to water it down, but once I did it tasted good. Had two cups of that. Then we were handed waffle shots. I thought, 'how cute - waffles in a little shot glass with syrup and powdered sugar.' but this was no sweet treat. They were little shots of booze with a slice of waffle. Awesome.   Then the food. I had the baked egg on cornbread without the sausage, but with gumbo. Wife had the tofu scramble. Mine was unbelievable. Great cornbread, perfectly baked egg, all in a hot skillet with the gumbo on top. Great flavor combination. Medium size but incredibly filling. The tofu scramble looked good but small. \u00a0  All in all, a great breakfast spot but didn't seem to be that busy or popular.   Would go back. Would recommend. Would like to go for dinner.",

    "review_text": "Zero stars for the general attitude and service from one of the bouncers on Friday night (Dec 11) who would not let me in.   1 star for everything else 15 Romolo does right.   Relationship I've had w/ 15 Romolo before Dec. 11: -June: First time to 15 Romolo for my good friend's going away party. Decided I loved the place. -July: A good friend and I celebrated our birthday here - Numerous times over the past 5 months: I have recommended this place to friends and come here myself to enjoy their drinks and atmosphere. I enjoy the juke box and friendly service behind the bar and from the waitresses who so kindly bring drinks to people when there's a packed crowd. -This month: a friend's company is having their holiday party here.  Facts and expectations I have about 15 Romolo: Although it's in North Beach along with dance clubs/lounges, strip clubs and hole in the wall bars, I still think it's a nicer bar for North Beach because of their d\u00e9cor, their bar/drink menu and the way I've been treated in the past by the staff inside. I know it's not perfect: their juke-box is sometimes working, they need more bartenders, it can get hot in the summer, etc... But it's a nice bar for NB. The bar tenders are nice once you can actually order your drink and the waitresses are great. Now naturally after frequenting a place I come to have expectations about it. Well, Friday night did not meet my expectations. At all. In fact, I'm not sure if I'll ever go back here.  Story of Friday night: I'm coming from a work event that ended late. I show up at 15 Romolo a little before midnight with my boyfriend and 2 co-workers. We're told right away by two different bouncers we have to wait in a line that doesn't exist because the place is over capacity. We waited in total about 30 minutes or so and never got in. My two co-workers ended up leaving as to better the chance I could get in (and I admit, one of my co-workers was being a bit sassy to one of the bouncers). Mind you, we all started off being nice and I kindly asked if I just could go in and see my friend to let her know we were outside waiting.  After waiting a while and watching 5 people walk out, I asked the bouncers a few times why we couldn't get in and did not receive a proper response, which was: \"We are over capacity right now. I just let in a group of 30 people. Once they are done getting their drinks we can let you in.\" That just doesn't make sense. We still were not let in.  At this point I was upset and emotional because for me, it's important that I show up for events like one's birthday, and some bouncer was not letting me do this for no good reason. I start to cry because I'm half thinking, maybe now he'll let me and my boyfriend in, and half because I'm truly upset.  We still do not get in. A cab pulls up with two people inside. I tell my boyfriend we need to go because now I'm too upset to celebrate and clearly the bouncer is not letting us in. As I walk to the cab, one of the bouncers says to me only, \"You are too drunk to get in anyway.\" And then he lets the two people who got out of the cab into the bar right away. No one has ever said this to me. It was like a dagger to the heart. I pride myself on my alcohol consumption because I don't know anyone with better control. I have about 5 days a year where I am hung-over. I confess I was drinking at my work event, but I was not drunk, nor was I slurring my words or falling over. Not once did I call either bouncer a name or yell at them. Ask any of my friends and I am not an angry or mean spirited person by nature, sober or intoxicated.  I get in the cab and go home with my boyfriend. While in the cab my friend inside the bar calls me and said the bouncer came up to her and the birthday girl as they were walking out to see me (I had texted them previously, but it took them a while to look at their phones... I do not have friends who are constantly looking at their phones when out, so I did not expect them to come out right away). He told my friend I would get in if I came back, he's sorry and if he had known I was with her group he would have let me in. I'm like, WTF? No way. I already told him we were with a birthday group inside and I was too upset... I have never had such a demeaning experience on behalf of someone's own ego.  I was supposed to be celebrating my good girlfriend's birthday with her and her husband and friends who were all inside. I was denied this because someone wanted to have a power trip.  So I just wanted to say: thank you 15 Romolo bouncer dude who has slicked back hair (or oily), smokes and has a smaller build than the other bouncer guy from Friday night. Thanks for such a memorable, horrible night with 15 Romolo. You made me miss my friend's birthday celebration and left a bad impression on behalf of 15 Romolo.  *I apologize for this long review but I wanted people to understand where I was coming from. Also, thank you for reading this. I hope you had a better end of the night than I did.",

It is art.  Last night, I went into 15 Romolo, another one of Esquire's best bars in San Francisco. It's a little hole in the wall up a hill in the middle of a wonderfully-sketchy part of town (the girls in our group were assured by the man standing outside the nearby topless bar that they would have a good time in his establishment. Somehow, I don't think they believed him.)  Walking in, you can see why people like this place. It's small but not too small to be uncomfortable. There's a long bar with plenty of seats and more at tables in the back and around the room. It's dark and very pretty.  But the real joy of this place is watching the bartenders go to work. Each of them was dressed in a flannel shirt and newsboy caps. Many were rocking some crazy badass mustaches. It was if the members of OKGO were personally making me drinks, and that suited me just fine.  These bartenders knew their stuff. Each drink was carefully and lovingly created. Liquids were poured and mixed together before being slid into a cocktail shaker and shaken vigorously. The end result: beautiful.  My only problem is that, because of this dedication to their craft, service is slow. Very slow. The bar wasn't packed and we still waited a while to get our drinks.  Still, when the drinks came, they were fantastic. One might even say, a work of art.",

My how things have changed.  The atmosphere is great; you can see and feel the history in this place, and they've done a great job updating it while preserving the old world charm. This is the type of place you encounter a mixologist. Usually this elicits an eye roll, but I was very impressed with the bartender's--damn, I mean mixologist's--knowledge. He made some very good recommendations based on what we liked, and clearly knew his boozes and how the different flavors work together.  Cocktails were all about $10 and were delicious. But once the place got busy the table service was nonexistent, and the bar was too crowded for me to even consider approaching. After sitting in front of an empty glass for about 20 minutes I left. But I'll be back.",

(As one of Esquire's Rules dictates, Nobody ever sits in a bar and says, You know, the music could really be louder.)  So why is it (oh) so close? Because they care about cocktails, and they care about aesthetics, and if you go on off-hours the bartenders are wonderful and personable and helpful and nice, all things that are, shall we say, not bankable in their profession, in this town. Because the Sage Meyer Lemon Press, which may or may not be still on the menu but was one of the best cocktails I've ever had, each of the five (5) times I had it. Because, as implied/alluded to in the previous sentence, they actually change their cocktail menu, testament to one of my earlier laudatory statements, the one about caring about cocktails. Because they have a damn good bourbon selection. Because they also have good food, which is totally not necessary but which they totally went ahead and did, anyway (see what I mean about caring?). Because they use dark wood and they keep the place dim and their lights are these beautiful little filamenty bulbs, all different shapes and plinging in clusters in scattered directions, and I'm sure it's nowhere close to energy efficient, but goddamit, sometimes beauty has to take precedence. Because they don't have a tv, or didn't the last time I checked, and because their jukebox, though often too loud, is pretty much full with really passable music, though not quite as good as the Summer Place's, what with its early Zeppelin and Fleetwood Mac and what have you.   But yeah, go on an off-night. Bring a book. Ask the bartender how he's doing, and if he's been experimenting with anything new lately. Sip your drink and your sentences, and leave before it gets too loud and move on to Tosca, or hell maybe even Mr. Bing's. But start here, while your palate is still a higher priority.

We walk into this inconspicuous spot and you look around and it's like you walked into a time machine and went to SF in the 70's with the looks of the furniture and decor.   Although the place seemed a little obsolete, a chat with the bartender/owner foresaw the potential of this lounge. He recently bought the place and will make improvements along with serving European-influenced bar food which is very unique. He's also very generous, offering and taking a shot of patron with all of us. The man definitely has the experience and the will to make this place a success. If he can pull it off, this will be a low profile 5-star spot that succeeds without the unnecessary glamour.

Encouraged by the great ratings, my friends and I showed up at 8pm and got seats at the thin central table because most of the tables were reserved. Not a problem, we can roll with that... But then we noticed a few things off after that.  First, there were only 2 beers on tap which was surprising for a Saturday night. The food was good yet it took a long time to arrive. Maybe they forgot our order? For example, our fries arrived only at 9 but the waiter was nice enough to apologize and took it off our tab. The customer service was good overall to the point that I was initially willing to give it 4 stars.  But the main reason I'm giving this 3 stars is that the yelp review for 15 Romolo was misleading: This is more of a bar than a great tapas restaurant. Don't get me wrong, the food and drinks were awesome but we were looking for a dinner place and were disappointed that this was more of a bar with a limited menu.  To summarize: If you're looking for a great bar to hang out with friends, 15 Romolo is perfect. If you're looking for dinner place with the ambiance of a nice restaurant, go somewhere else.",

    "review_text": "As mentioned in my previous review, 15 Romolo is a great bar with totally underrated food. And if food is underrated, then brunch at 15 Romolo is the most underrated meal here but that needs to change. This is brunch done right.   Let's start with waffle shots. It's 15 Romolo's amuse bouche for boozy brunch and boozy it is. Bite sized waffle sprinkled with powdered sugar dunked into a bourbon/rum and coffee liquer shot. Now I'm ready for brunch. But wait let's order a Bloody Mary first. By far one of the spiciest Bloodys in the city but it's mighty tasty. If spicy is not your thing, then the Beetlejuice is a nice gin and beet alternative. or just get a glass of punch because as it says on the menu, \"without a drink in hand, brunch is just breakfast.\"  Menu changes somewhat often which is great for variety but sad to see old favorites like the fried chicken biscuit go away. It's almost like the dinner version but throw in some egg, bacon, and hashbrowns. Yum! But my new favorite brunch item on the current brunch menu is the country fried steak. Tenderized beef breaded, fried, then smothered in gravy accompanied by some over easy eggs and hashbrowns plus some salad for balance. So satisfying for brunch.   I love boozy brunch at 15 Romolo. If you like happy hour here, you need to stop by for brunch. I think the bar best explains why themselves: \"If 15 Romolo is a well-kept secret, then our weekend pnchdrnkbrnch is f-ing Narnia!\"",

When I paid you a visit back in March of this year you teased me with you hard to find entrance way (seriously walked past it half a dozen times... intoxication is not the best friend of effective seek and find), and plied me with delicious crafty cocktails with unique ingredient mixes that tickled my taste-buds in magnificent ways.  15 Romolo (also the address) is a swanky, hidden prohibition style cocktail lounge in the heart of downtown SF. It's dimly lit, with musical stylings ranging from slow and sultry to upbeat and contemporary. No matter the mix, it was a great time both times I went, and I'm looking forward to sharing drinks with friends and colleagues alike when I return in a few short months.  Pro-tip: If insanely busy, order a beer and a cocktail. The beer will be served up right away while the bar-chefs are overrun and cocktail requests can take upwards of 20-30 minutes at times. Definitely a great place to have 1-2 specialty cocktails but on price and wait time don't expect to get white girl/boy wasted quick and on the cheap here, this is a classy joint yo!",

They exploded in your mouth unleashing rich marrow flavor as soon as you bit into their crispy exteriors.  I ended up at this bar 2 out of the 3 nights I was in the city, and for good reason.  I had a great experience with both of my bartenders on either night, Matt and Jared (god I hope it was Jared, I'll have to double check).  This is a very cool bar, with limited bullshit, and that is something very rare in this world. 15 Romolo is worthy of celebrating.",

Romolo tends to be an end up for me because of the fries, but I really think I might want to start starting my North Beach evenings there so that I can appreciate the cocktails' interesting profiles and have a $6 gin and tonic at Vesuvio or wherever later.",

My first night Boris was my bartender and Scott was also shaking up a couple drinks. I sat down on the bar stool and said \"I like rum, it's my birthday, what can you make me?\". Boris smiled, and presented me with his take on the old-fashioned. He made it with three rums, and the only one of which I can remember is Smith &amp; Cross. It was superb.  What I admired most about the way they tended bar was the supreme care they took in making their drinks. At Romolo they strain all of their drinks that are shaken twice (Once Hawthorne, once fine mesh) to prevent any tiny ice particles from ruining the purity of the drink.  We also had a track 42, which was a honey vodka based cocktail, also superb, and a rising sun which was made with Yamazaki 12 (an aged Japanese whiskey). The final drink of the night was something that I can't recall, but was delicious and given my state of inebriation, I'm unlikely to recall the name any time soon. To end the night I had their desert entitled \"that's that\". Two homemade cookies sandwiching a scoop of maple ice cream. That is the most awesome way to end a night in my humble opinion.  Fast forward 23 hours. Back again, a sincere glutton for punishment indeed. This time my birthday party was in full swing, and instead of two, we brought twenty.  I want to talk about the food. French fries, with curry catsup. I hate catsup (or ketchup for that matter), but I ate it and I loved it. I repeat, I HATE CATSUP, but there was absolutely no way you could not try that delicious sauce, and the ranch wasn't bad either ;). My brother had the sliders, and judging by how quickly he ate them (HE DIDN'T OFFER ME ANY ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!) they must have been terribly delicious. Back to the drinks :D.  I went to the bar and said \"I closed this bar this morning, and I'll close it again tonight. I love rum and I'd like a drink for my birthday\". Just like boris, our new bartender Ethan smiled and said \"sure\". A couple moments later I was awarded with a Hemingway Daiquiri. Hemingway was a diabetic so there's no sugar in a Hemingway Daiquiri, but I didn't miss it. It was a great drink. I had about six or seven more drinks that night, and I quite frankly don't remember them all, but I do remember that they were all delicious.  All in all, 15 Romolo is one of my new favorite bars in San Francisco. And did I mention the kitchen is open till 130am? EPIC WIN.  TL;DR: Great bar, awesome staff, super drinks, spectacular bar food, wonderful evening.  Thank you to Scott, Boris, Ethan and Jared. It was a great birthday.  Cheers, Josh",

The allure of something hidden and mysterious always captivates my imagination, and while the prospect of being mugged keeps my curiosity in check, the promise of sampling fine spirits poured by a mixology maestro is enough to make me grow a pair of new ones.  Walking the length of Broadway's 'strip' (the most apropos nickname ever given to an SF neighborhood), we chortle at the sight of bouncers with necks the size of a grown man's thigh and stoop sluts flaunting their improbably large bodacious tatas (humina humina humina). Our iPhone's Yelp compass points toward an alley named Romolo, and not more than 20 feet up a slight incline, a small neon sign beckons softly, \"pssst, this way, mind the STDs.\"  Stepping over puddles and rivulets (knowing that it hasn't rained in over a week), we clamber up the alley and peek through a doorway into a soft-lit, wooden interior. A fully-stocked bar illuminates one half of the room, while the rest of the interior is outfitted with a smattering of tables and chairs and a jukebox pumping some reasonable tunes. Gazing around, we could swear we'd been here before, albeit in a slightly less sober state. Could it be? A cozy, nook of a bar located mere footsteps away from Broadway's bedlam?  Scott Baird and Aaron Smith (of Coco500 and Rye fame) reopened 15 Romolo in mid-February of 2009, amidst some modest fanfare. Being the mastermind behind Quince 2.0's stellar cocktail menu, Scott was the draw, and he and Josh have made some appreciable changes to 15 Romolo.  The cocktail menu, containing originals and classic concoctions (both straight and 'twisted'), is drinktastic. Among the many libations we experienced that night, standouts were:  - Hunter's Flip, (porter, rum, sasparilla and nutmeg) - Fiscal Agent (bourbon, chartreuse and cocoa nibs) - Vieux Carre (rye, Benedictine and peychaud's bitters) - (off-menu) Smokin' Bols (in-house infused Bols Genever gin)   Not only is 15 Romolo a drinkie's haven, but the bar gets huge props for serving grub until 1:30 a.m., with some interesting menu items that include a hot dog stuffed in a tortilla, slathered with cheddar and deep fried. Fried cheese dog...? Bring it.  What isn't altogether clear is whether the clientele is aware of the bar's caliber. On our visit, the party of six next to us was quaffing cosmos and coronas while fondling each other as if they were auditioning for a Tommy Hilfiger ad (FAIL). How they stumbled across this oasis, we couldn't guess, but they were a bit of an ambiance killer, and they certainly weren't there for the food or the magic potions.  We didn't mind. More for us.",

Much to my surprise, they were closed for a private party. Fuck. So, we went to 15 Romolo because i knew they had food as well. As we sat down, i looked at the menu and read that their kitchen doesn't open till 6pm. And we were there at 520. I asked if we should put our food order in while we were ordering drinks or wait until 6 when the kitchen opened and when they found out that we just wanted a burger and fries, they put the order in and we had food fifteen minutes later. Danny and Katie, who served us, couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. I almost left Jovanie at the bar and took Katie to the show. They have Smooth Ambler whiskey , which is my favorite, and the atmosphere is very relaxed. Not at all like most bars in North Beach. Which is a BIG compliment. We also had their banana bread dessert which was AMAZING. And I actually want to drive back over the bridge to get more but a) its 8 o'clock in the morning and b) I'm getting fat from all my impulse eating.

That being said, I am surprised that they seemed shorthanded on that Saturday morning with only one server waiting on all the tables. I had arrived a while later than my friends who'd already placed their order; it took a good 15 minutes or so before I had to finally wave to catch his attention.  First up were the waffle-shots. A really neat concept and pretty well executed --- tiny shot glasses with a piece of waffle in a half-ounce pour of bourbon; someone mentioned it's bourbon-maple syrup but I don't know! I had my waffle in two bites, dipping it in the shot for my second bite and chugged the drink down. It was a novelty item, and fun!  After vacillating between the basque style baked eggs and the duck confit hash, the duck came out on top (thus, probably, answering the age-old question of whether the chicken or the egg came first --- it turns out the duck came first!).   The hash was described as a dish of duck confit with crispy potatoes, scallions, prosciutto, and a poached egg. I must say they seem to have a *very* loose interpretation of the word 'crispy'; the potatoes were roughly mashed, served on a greased hot cast-iron skillet with the duck confit and a poached egg to top it off. Let me start by saying that it was pretty decent. But it was disappointing when you consider that almost every component of this dish were items that are delicacies in their own right. The duck confit felt like pulled poultry instead of duck that had been slowly braised in it's own fat over many hours. The prosciutto --- I didn't even realise there was prosciutto in it till I got home and looked at the menu to see what it was composed of. So much for that! And lastly, the poached egg was overdone, the yolk was somewhat soft --- and that's the best I can say about it.  So there you have it --- it was the dining version of a dream-team with star players that failed to live up to expectations, and performed like a second-division/minor-league team.  Pro-tip: Order the hash browns; or a dish that comes with hash browns. They looked delicious and everyone at the table that had it said it was really good. I should have had that!  The sangria however was pretty good! I am not much of an alcohol aficionado so that's the best I can do when describing the libation dimension of the food-chain parallel universes.  Epilogue: I should have got the Basque style baked eggs instead. One of our dining companions got it and it looked absolutely fantastic! The eggs always looks better on the other plate!",

Hidden down an alley off Broadway and up some steps lies the wonderful cave that is 15 Romolo. Romolo wins due to their extremely knowledgeable bar staff and attention to detail in all their cocktails. This is one of those bars where you will want to order your martini with gin. As it should be.   The entire bar is an open room with a hard wood floor throughout. Inside it's a really great mix of a classic old tyme (spelled with a 'y') bar and a typical locals bar complete with jukebox.   I've been in to Romolo several different nights on several different days of the week but, every time, this place has been a winner. It's never been so crowded that I couldn't get a drink from the bar in a reasonable time. And that's quite an accomplishment when you think about how long it takes to make a good drink like they do here.   Great bar to check out, especially after work some day during the week. Order something on the menu and you'll be sure to tell the bartender \"thank you\" once you're done.",

Let's start with the That's-That. 15 Romolo's take on the infamous It's-It, this thing is a delicious miracle concoction. The two cookies are homemade and sandwiched around humphrey slocombe malted milk chocolate ice cream. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate so when I saw it initially I was a little crestfallen. Then I took my first bite and considered stabbing the people at my table just to get their share of the dessert. It's freaking fantastic.  The Pixie cocktail, made with vodka, st. germain, dolin blanc, lemon, and mint, was so good that I just kept ordering them rather than trying something new. And if you know anything about me, you should know that I'm a firm believer that variety is the spice of life so it takes a lot for me to stick to one drink.   We also had the pork sliders, which were ever so soft and savory, melting like butter in my mouth with every bite and a chickpeas appetizer that was fried and spiced and somehow made me think of eating popcorn.   I hear this place is ridiculously packed on the weekends, but go on a Tuesday like I did and enjoy the empty seating space with filling your mouth with delicious treats. You won't regret it.",

I started out with the Pimm's Cup - ginger is my new best friend - and ended with a Lambo and another delicious cocktail that I can't recall the name of.

We split the pork sliders and fries which was the perfect amount of food for a small bite, not to mention completely slurp-worthy; next time I may not be sharing!

I'm a huge fan of 15 Romolo, so don't let the three stars fool you. \u00a0In fact, I only just now signed up for Yelp so I could review the place and hopefully influence the management to make a key change. \u00a0  First, and most importantly, 15 Romolo has great drinks and great food. \u00a0My favorite drink in the entire city is their Rio Grande. \u00a0The management has made a strong effort to get consistency across bartenders since 15 Romolo renovated and established their current drink list. \u00a0I've noticed this positive evolution in drink quality during my last couple of visits.  There is a significant problem though that I'm surprised others on Yelp haven't mentioned given that I've experienced it consistently at 15 Romolo. \u00a0The service is terrible! \u00a0I've been to many of the \"artisanal\" cocktail spots in the city and I realize that quality drinks take a little longer to make. \u00a0But the service at 15 Romolo is unacceptably slow. \u00a0On both recent visits, even when the place was only moderately busy, whole rounds were consumed before a newly ordered drink was delivered. \u00a0I would sit and drink my cocktail while my friend watched and, just when mine was gone, her cocktail would finally be delivered. \u00a0 Then the cycle would repeat with my newly ordered cocktail. \u00a0Doesn't it benefit both 15 Romolo and its patrons to have enough staff behind the bar to meet demand?

Located amidst the T&amp;A clubs of Broadway, 15 Romolo is a nice breath of low-key fresh air.  Sure, I went early, on a school night, and it was slow, but it was so nice to have the place almost to ourselves for some chit chat. We only had cocktails, I had a Gin Fizz and it was boss. Also, the lead singer of Social Studies (a very awesome band) works, or used to work there, so that's cool.   Can't wait to go back for boozy brunch after reading all the great reviews for it.",

Jared, Ian, Ethan, Gabby...too many greats to name. Your drink mixing skillz and the way you manhandle those shakers could inspire an instructional dance/rap.   3) You have the most delicious Pimm's Cup on the coast, not to mention one of the most well-rounded seasonal drink menus in the city.

Rumor has it there have been riots when the Boricua wings and Fried Plantains run out.   5) Your jukebox (CD's not digital!) has just right balance of \"That's my song!!\" and \"I haven't heard that in for-ever!\" selections on rotation.   6) Photo booth.

This isn't really what I come to expect when I hear \"meatless options.\" Heck, even a steakhouse will give me a salad and a potato but I don't consider Morton's very vegetarian friendly.

It just kind of fell apart for me when it came to the mixed drinks. I had the WORST whiskey sour I've ever had. When I say that I know my whiskey sours it behooves you to believe me. I've had better whiskey sours that were made with a mix. Thats what it so disappointing. Obviously they used egg whites, and the drink looked the part. But the ratios were so off. It was watery and honestly undrinkable.  My husband had an AMAZING gin fizz. Ordered another one and it was so bad it was sent back. The next one he got was even worse and so..even though he didn't want to be \"that guy\", he sent it back. We were informed that it was probably due to the shift change...okie dokie...  My girlfriend had a drink called \"When Pigs Fly\" which tasted like god damn kool aid. When pigs fly I will order that one myself.  The pluses though...their cheese platter was great and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. Also, they had Dimple Pinch which is a Scotch I've been dying to try. And boy howdy was it delicious.  I would try this place again, I love the overall intention. But some of the bar tending skills left me feeling a touch more than disappointed..",

I swore in my buzzed head that I would one day make it back to that to be seen Mecca that I had not been to yet.  See, I've been burned by North Beach several times before. Damn Columbus street. Damn you I say! Why do you have all these sparkly signs filled with oh-so-OK food for a oh-so-I'm-a-tourist price?? Sheesh. Where's those classy places from the noir flicks where I was supposed to leave the war behind and hang with the flappers in sequined dresses?! Finally - a NB gem...15 Romolo.  We didn't eat anything since we were on a major pub crawling extravaganza, but this was the first stop...so I feel like I can be objective here. Fantastic, inventive cocktails for not a retarded amount of cash: $9 a piece for crazy inventive ones, and $8 for some classic ones that everyone should have at least once a week. I mean seriously...go look at their menu (and count the 2 original scotch cocktails up there...not so common I tell ya!). One of the best parts is that the bartenders aren't indifferent...like those at this other inventive cocktail bar I know of called...oh...La Cantina. They really are cool people with a great sense of humor.  Good loungy layout - plenty of tables along the walls, but a big open space in the middle so when a bunch of people start to pack the place, you don't need to hover over the kinds ladies and gents at the tables. Crowd seemed kind of cold to newbies - lots of stares without a lot of interaction, but that could have to do with the fact that everyone was dressed as santa...and therefore, a bit scary (therefore, I'm not reading too much into the crowd's lukewarm response). Also, the crowd is a little older, so don't I wouldn't go expecting a non-cougarfied 'tang, but you will get some superb beverages. I'll be back.",

This bar is great for a nice chill spot where it doesn't get too packed and is not full of obnoxious people. This is a bar first and foremost, I thought it was a restaurant but sooooo not the case. It's not a bad thing but I just didn't expect it. They have a small variety of small dishes that are pretty tasty. I'd recommend their chicken wings and fries if you feel like having a quick bite. I like their drinks, they have a lot of beer on tap and they have a lot of unique drinks as well.  I would recommend this place on any kind of bar crawl or precursor to a night out.",

I'll let you be the judge of which is worse (or ask me, as I know first-hand. Spoiler alert: it's Kells).   Anyway, this place has stupid-good cocktails and the bartenders are wonderful. There's even a bartender (mixologist? whatever) who looks like Ryan Gosling. I'm dead serious, you should head over right now if you're into that, which you probably are because you have a pulse.

Cocktail menu changes fairly frequently and is invariably solid. (At some points it was maybe overly dominated by whiskey or similar cocktails -- which I love -- but usually it has something for everyone). And the setting is wonderful.   But it gets so busy on Fridays and Sats now, it's not even funny. Service is crazy slow, and I realize that it's not because they are not trying -- but you can make artisan cocktails only so fast. Also, sometimes on said nights there's been a guy at the door with quite an attitude. Door with an attitude at a bar of this style? Seriously???? (I'm not talking about the usual guy who's there most of the time and is pretty nice).

The place is a huge open space that seems like a pretty typical bar in North Beach, isolated in the middle of long alleyway. We just wanted a quick appetizer, so we ordered the avocado tempura which was pretty good. It was a little too salty, but any form of avocado is good to me.  The primary problem here is with 15 Romolo's drinks. The drinks are not good at all -- you can tell immediately upon first sip that the \"mixologist\" (I use that term VERY loosely for this place) does not know the elements that go into a good drink. Their famed Pimm's Cup is a watered-down, poor man's version of the real thing. The ginger flavor is bland and it has no alcoholic flavor whatsoever. In fact, it tasted more like Ginger Ale mixed with soda water -- it was disgusting. I admire the uniqueness of using a cardboard straw, but realistically, I hated the soggy paper taste from the straw after about 10 minutes.  I tried 3 of the other drinks: Lambo, Hemmingway's Daiquiri, and this other one called Rio something. All were not very good.   Within 20 minutes, we quickly paid the bill and got the hell out of there. There are way too many good bars in North Beach to waste another minute at 15 Romolo.",

Plus, it is located in an alleyway next to a hotel. You will definitely feel like you've walked into a speakeasy. Having gone late at night around midnight or so after the Bastille concert, there was plenty of seating and the space was drafty and airy, as opposed to crowded and hot like I expected. I assume the place is more crowded earlier in the night. But it was also a Monday lol.   Anyway, we were ravenous for something to eat and 15 romolo obliged. The menu is interesting; limited with mainly burgers, sammies and sliders and with combo deals, such as soup with any choice of sandwich, or appetizer with any choice of burger or slider. I went with the latter.   I had fried hush puppies for my app (meh, it was alright) and pork sliders for my main. The sliders were yummy and the waiter said I could have two since they were quite small. Food is clearly not their strong suit, the drinks are (according to the company I was with) but I didn't have anything to drink so I can't vouch for that.   Their jukebox is also surprisingly well-stocked, with plenty of non-mainstream songs to keep my hipster audiophile friend happy, so extra points for that!  In the end, this is a bar like any other except the food is a little better. There is so much potential in their food to be beyond just bar food, I can almost taste the breakthrough; I just think running the bar is their main priority.   I would come back again if I happen to be in the area. Open late (yay) but hard to find (we got lost trying to find it), plus parking sucks. Still, check it out!",

Brunette girl finally asks me what I wanted to order. \u00a0(Um your 30 minutes late). \u00a0I tell her firmly, that man (pointing at the guy from the opposite end of the bar) took my order along time ago and he's clearly serving other people. \u00a0  Brunette walks over to the guy and comes back with our drinks a few more minutes later. \u00a0She takes my card and asks for the amount of glasses I wanted with attitude. \u00a0I was (like a nerd) tagging myself on yelp and wrote \"terrible service\"...she looks down at my iphone (I know you see it) and I said 8 (as you can see I am not a happy camper). \u00a0  I turn to my colleagues and apologize that I was holding up the group. \u00a0I then say, \"Wow this place has terrible terrible service. \u00a0I never in my life waited this long for drinks. \u00a0Shitty service for sure.\" \u00a0I guess the brunette bartender heard me so she walked over GRABBED the pitcher and my drink from us (it has been sitting on the table already for a good two minutes and I WAS IN ALREADY DRINKING MY DRINK) and then while holding our order walks to the other end of the bar.  She comes back a minute later and tells me, \"I don't like how you are talking. \u00a0WE DO NOT SERVE YOUR KIND HERE. \u00a0You can leave\"  What?! \u00a0Even my cousin turned to me shocked and asked, \"did I just hear that?\"  #1. \u00a0I clearly was sober so I know I was not acting ghetto \u00a0I was not sloppy and I clearly stated the facts. \u00a0It was bad service and it was the slowest bar service I've gotten in SF. \u00a0I NEVER PERSONALLY attacked any of the workers or got aggressive with anyone. \u00a0I stated my opinion to my group of friends. \u00a0There is nothing wrong with that scenario. \u00a0I have multiple witnesses that saw this transaction and all of them where dumbfounded with what just happened since they clearly saw that I did nothing wrong.  #2. \u00a0How UNPROFESSIONAL are you to take a drink and pitcher someone is drinking away from them and walk to the back with it?!! \u00a0Who does that? \u00a0Wow. \u00a0  I truly hope you all spread the word about this bar. \u00a0I really wish you FIRE that tall brunette. \u00a0I really feel sorry for that bartender, clearly her parents didn't raise her right and she is so insecure with constructive criticism she has to make her entire bar suffer for her lack of ethics.",

I asked for something sweet, but not overly sweet with rum and pineapple....the bartender handed me a sugar rimmed cocktail and called it a \"Havana.\" This place rocks because the bartenders take meticulous pride in their art.

    "review_text": "I think their brunch is a relatively recent thing. A friend and I went on Sunday around noon and the place was deserted. Not a bad thing, just strange that the whole world hasn't discovered already how awesome it is.  The service was very warm, friendly and personable. Everyone who worked there was just nice. The atmosphere is a bit dive-y, but not unpleasantly so. It's not a fancy, romantic place, but it feels intimate, relaxed and inviting. I don't know what it's like at night and/or when it's crowded.  The food was very good, and, at about $10 per plate, very reasonably priced. My friend got the Distiller's Mash--total comfort food. I got the French Toast, which was paired with pears and bacon--very, very good. I think the toast could have used more syrup; I should have just asked for more but I wasn't thinking. Oh--and before the food got there, we were given these adorable little Waffle Shots (or whatever they're called)--shot glasses with a little divine liquid at the bottom and a couple of squares of crunchy-soft waffle. SO good.  We both enjoyed our food a lot. We felt torn--should we write glowing reviews about it on Yelp? Should we keep it our secret? I think a balance is important. We agreed that not telling anyone put the brunch at risk of being shut down, so for the greater good (the greater good!), I am writing this.  Oh--I got coffee--it was good, strong--in a french press. My friend got the \"Breakfast for Champions #2,\" which we both agreed was very good. It came in a port glass (a miniature wine glass), but I think it was smaller because it was served at room temp, sans ice.  Later, I asked them what was in the aforementioned divine liquid in the \"Waffle Shot\" thing, and they not only told me, but the bartender, Morgan, pretty much gave me the recipe. I thought that was cool. They didn't act all mysterious and proprietary about it-- which, if they had, I would have accepted as being reasonable. But their openness was refreshing and charming.  I will be back for sure. I want to enjoy their very reasonably priced, and yummy, brunch before everyone knows about it and they start having lines out the door.",

I live 10 minutes away from here and probably would have never discovered this hidden hot spot.  I love the spacious floor so I can ACTUALLY carry on a conversation without being bumped into and \u00a0having to give the obligatory *excuse me asshole/douche bag/ ugly chick stare*... what was i talking about again??... see how this can be a problem. Anyways, with 15 romolo, you will not encounter problems like that.   -the very hidden 15 romolo is nicely decorated, dimly lit, and very spacious. It host crowds that are stoner chill to drunks that stronly thinks they are on american idol. There are tables that perimeter the large floor area, and with a very much smaller corner bar towards that back.   -prices are about fair; drinks ranges from low 6 to high 10. and being part of the unemployed, alcoholic community, low prices are a must; spend less, get just as drunk - \u00a0my current life philosophy.   -They also serve yummy look finger foods including burgers from 6pm-130am. So if you run into the drunk munchies, so get the munchies from all the reefer smoke seeping in through the windows, you're in luck.   In short, low-key, friendly service, clean, spacious, fairly priced, hidden bar in north beach.",

I'd heard amazing things from Josh K. and decided that 15 Romolo was worthy of a special occasion (and apparently my 400th review as well).  Romolo is one of the best old man bars I've ever encountered. We got in a little before 10 and it stayed practically empty until we left to go elsewhere around 10:30. That may not be to everyone's liking, but I love a bar with ample tables, friendly bartenders, open space for dancing, and the ability to hear people two feet away from you.  Was it the dark, sleek, sexy wood counters? Was it the gorgeous light fixtures? Was it their perfectly stocked bar? Was it the fact they serve food until 1:30 in the morning or that I had to get there by walking up a dark alley on the seedy part of Broadway?   Whatever it was, 15 Romolo charmed me. I ordered one of their specialty drinks called a \"Darkened Storm\" of rum, lime, bitters and ginger beer. It was sweet and spicy at the same time, served tall.  I will be back in the future. I will be back for good conversation, food from their late night menu and a slow meander through the rest of their specialty cocktails.",

Ewwww, yuck, gross, and nasty----  -\"No, I don't want to check out your stripper show!\" -\"What in God's name did I just step in !?!?\" -\"I have no spare change, I only have $20's and you ain't gettin' em\" -\"No, I don't know where the crooked street is....No, I've never been to Ohio\"  But sometimes I always find myself here. The friends seem to like this neighborhood. I'd like to see it converted to a wind farm. The bars suck so bad it makes me want to remain sober and save money..... Now that's bad. So low and behold, how surprised was I when I found 15 Romolo. I was circling, trying to get to the motorcycle parking when I see a couple of people standing outside a doorway smoking. I zipped by at around 25mph because the ol' girl needs a running start to make it up the hill, but in that split second I caught a glimpse, a little flash, of a bar with panache, and it wasn't filled with ass-gimps and crass. Suddenly I had an oasis in Little Italy. A place that didn't have people elbow to elbow trying not to sweat on each other. \u00a0I walked down, met the folks I saw standing outside...they were very nice and friendly, I called my friends on the cell phone and told them to come meet me under the Condor sign. They complained loudly as they walked down from Amate.  \"Why do we have to go all the way down there?\" \u00a0\"We only just got our drinks and it was less than 20 minutes this time!\", \u00a0they said  I led them past the entrance their contorted confused faces blossomed into pure unadulterated joy. I think 1 or 2 actually wept at the sight of an unoccupied couch at 10PM on a Friday night and a bartender waiting to take an order. I distinctly remember 2 of my girl/friends looking at my crotch there after, and a couple of the guys quickly brushing their lips on my posterior in a nonchalant - bend down to tie my shoe - \u00a0sort of way because they felt so indebted to this great discovery I had shared with them. Yes, it was a fine bar, a good night, and a pleasant feeling not being sweated on.",

The atmosphere is kinda loud, but if you move away from the bar, it is possible to have a conversation.   We shared two chicken skewers, beet salad, sliders, stuffed peppers, asparagus, fries, and for dessert, the beer-amisu. The portions here are pretty small and we were hungary. Out of all the items, the chicken skewers were probably the standout. I would skip the stuffed peppers. Definitely get the beer-amisu. It's basically beer chocolate cake layered with the usual tiramisu ingredients. Definitely the highly of the night.",

    "review_text": "I was recommended to this place by one of my friends for a place to go after our dinner at Trattoria Pinocchio. And I loved it! We ordered a lot of things to try different tastes.  At first the place looked a little questionable...very hole in the wall in the middle of tittie bar town, up a sketchy alley with graffiti covered wall paintings of what looked like a portrayal of chinatown's population. Not to mention the place literally looked like a giant dingy matchbox when you walk in. But this is a case of do-not-judge-a-book-by-it's-cover. Because the drinks and food and prices and music are AMAZING!  They have creative cocktails that cost anywhere from $9-$11 or in that ballpark, which is pretty darn good, especially when you think about how expensive normal drinks or shots are at the Standard or Edison Bar in LA. The bartenders know their stuff and mix with great pride and flair. And their food menu late at night is not expensive either! Too bad we were full from dinner or I think we would have ordered more food! I was totally eyeing a grilled tomato and cheese sammich for $6, and I think sliders and burgers were the same price!   ORDERED: [Pimms cup]--absolute favorite. If I came back again, I would definitely order this one. It was sooo refreshing with cucumber and mint and rum and whatever the heck else they put in there, but ridiculously yummy.  [La manzana]--I ordered this one and it was quite a pretty drink. I think it had something apple and citrusy inside with some kind of tequila base...geez, I don't even remember the stuff they mix in, but I just know it's GOOD.   [Wilson's smash]--the roommate ordered this. I was eyeing it on the menu too, but it was basically rum and yum.   [Huckleberry fizz]--NOT ON THE MENU! But the awesome waitress told us about it and it's a vodka base with huckleberry juice or soda (what is huckleberry anyway??) but you cannot taste the alcohol at all...it's like juice! haha loved this drink. I'd order it in a heartbeat as well.   [Coke and rum]--yea yea I know, why list this? But really, I've never tried a better coke and rum! It was sooo smooth and delicious! If you're a coke and rum lover, try it! If you're not, try it! You'd be surprised :)  [Fries]--wow $5 and AMAZING. Hot and piping, fresh cut potatoes, seasoned well with pepper...and AMAZING SAUCES. Homemade ranch that I actually liked (I don't really eat ranch), and CURRY KETCHUP. How cool does that sound?! It's really exotic and yummy =)   Lastly, they have a super cool jukebox and everyone in the bar will occasionally belt out singing when a good song comes on.(i.e. Journey, Benny and the Jets) Ahh, merry merry times. I totally want to come back here next time I'm in SF!",

I would absolutely come back here for drinks - great place for a happy hour!",

After a while it got to be easy for me to smile. Then I was laughing, usually out of nowhere. Just for the hell of it.  Then I knew I needed a strong drink.   So I went to Romolo with him.  He did not understand. He kept saying what a damn good thing it was.  \"People pay to be happy,\" he said, scratched his red-beard on his chin-- less ruddy, more brown hair on his head.  We sat against a plush blue seat board. I really nestled into his arm.",

If that makes any sense. And their drinks are sooo good! I especially love their brunch punch! They also serve waffle shots if you're eating there for brunch and the syrup in the shot glass will kick your ass, but in a good way! The staff is always very welcoming and friendly as well.  Every meal I've had at this place was just as good as their drinks. These people know how to do it right. And last night they stepped it up one more notch and changed my life with their burger!!!!!!!! Seriously one of the BEST burgers I've ever had. And I'm a burger slut. The thing that really rocked this burger was that they put peanut butter in it. Omggggg.  Can't wait to come back!!!",

Not really wings of any sort but fried plantains with homemade hot sauce is just as impressive and delicious. And I don't think the guy really fought, he just asked, which was nice to hear. However, the gin drink tastes like flowers, if you're into that.",

They specialize in cool mixed drinks  50-50 men to women.   lots of frat boys and successful people being very animated in their discussion of how they fly all over the country destroying the ozone to save the planets working for their big multinational liberal progressive earth destroying eco-friendly companies. while they drink exotics liquors that had to shipped across oceans on fossil fuel burning ships.   nothing wrong with that is you don't believe in global warming.",

    "review_text": "Disappointed in terms of drink strength and options.  We came hear (completely hidden away without signs in a small alley, not sure if that's a really good thing or bad, but the marketing expert in me says it's horrible for random visitors who pass by it on the street, because they don't and can't find it without knowing about it). But it's no speakeasy, so being hidden is really bad. Put a sign up on the street!  It was rather empty on a Saturday at 2pm and we were seated initially at a tiny cool middle area.   The drink selection doesn't have as much as I thought, as far as beers and fancy cocktails. \u00a0The fancy cocktails that everyone got, such as the $10 Pimm's Cup or the $13 Fizz something were tasty, but very weak in alcohol and not worth the price.   I did like how everyone got a free chocolate liqueur waffle shot at the end, which is unique. The waffle was EXTREMELY stale and felt like it was cooked 8 hours before that for breakfast and left on the counter, YUCK. The chocolate liqueur was very strong and interesting at least.  Service is solid, but the drink menu is lacking and the drinks they serve are weak. I'd say pass, but you probably won't find it unless you know about it or Yelp it anyways.",

    "review_text": "I will make this easy. Underrated.   Now with that start, let me start my reviews how I normally would. Now speakeasy getting big everywhere but this joint has been doing that before the whole hype came into play. Now I generally hate bar hopping in North Beach because it's just crowded with mediocre bars but this place is tucked neatly away in an alley away from the touristy crowd. This place has grown in popularity exponentially over the past year but its still solid. Yes it is crowded and it is not the biggest bar in the world but this place still surpasses all the bars in North Beach no questions asked. And you know what else is amazing? They actually make amazingly good drinks. They are legit bartenders who are friendly and just know how to mix strong drinks that taste awesome. It is definitely a rustic looking bar but definitely a classy affair I feel. I had a few food items and they have been all solid also which surprised me since most bar food Is just mediocre at best. What makes this place great is that it also has two atmospheres going on so if you want to be social just join the crowd on the floor but you can also choose to be laid back with your group of friends in the back and chat it up.  If you have not checked out 15 Romolo yet, you are missing out.",

The Pimm's cup is a nice starter drink if you're overwhelmed.   The crowd is never too snooty or over the top although the music can occasionally get kind of loud.   The food is another reason to go. Their french fries are hands down the best in town and always come with two dipping sauces: curry ketchup and buttermilk ranch. Both are homemade!   I always get an order of fries and the flat bread.

I love 15 Romolo!!  Reasons why I love 15 Romolo: - So NOT pretentious. Really, it's not. - Scott, the owner is AWESOME - Innovative and tasty cocktails - Reasonably priced. Starts at $8/drink - There's a cocktail where all proceeds go to the AIDS foundation - Tables and seats w/ a waitress/waiter to serve you - Older crowd - Spacious bar - No cover! - No dress code! - Delicious mojitos - Delicious cocktails made with champagne - Ask Scott to make you an EMERALD TOWER. I love it -- you will too. - Scott made me another drink but I can't remember what it's called. Had brandy &amp; champagne in it. YUM.  - Bouncers who share pizza with you (yes, I was drunk and took a slice of pizza from the bouncer. I'm not sure if I took it or he offered, but either way, I walked out of here and onto Broadway with a slice of pepperoni pizza in hand)  15 Romolo puts up a good fight with Cantina and Bourbon &amp; Branch.
