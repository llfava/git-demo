I was a latecomer to Masae's takeover from Sachi, so I was surprised to see the remodel and the name change. \u00a0And things just got better from there.  Ken, the manager/bartender, brought us up to speed on the change. The place looks terrific now. More seating, better lighting (not brighter, just better), new karaoke system and much nicer staff.  There are several English books here, so it's not just Japanese songs. \u00a0Yes, the songs are $2 per, but worth the price. \u00a0You can now use a wireless mic if you don't want to sing on stage (unless it's super busy like last night and then only special people like me get to use the wireless; otherwise, it gets lost in the crowd).  I used to introduce a lot of people to Sachi's. I'll be stopping by even more often now.  UPDATE: And I'm bringing Mani.",

Small, intimate but nice lounge (not gritty/divey), and because it's small it's more casual and fun, rather than feature some intimidating stage. Full bar plus lychee cocktails. I would've had fun just watching everyone and hanging at my table, but yes, we ended up singing. It felt like our own party after a certain point, with one guy from our group singing Sinatra and a bunch of us dancing up front. Great neighborhood spot if you can find it (it's just inside the Japantown mall).",

Drinks cost a fortune (as in- you're likely to promise your first born in exchange for a well drink) and they're not that strong.

That right there was 4 stars.   The get up and go rotation of songs is the fun part I think: getting up in front of your friends and a bunch of strangers is nerve racking (plus there are some pro frequenters too! Some dude was killin' it on stevie wonder!) but its great fun just lettin' loose. I think people will have a better time if you're not trying so hard you know? You have a good time, everyone has a good time. Words to the wise indeed.   I couldn't blame em for the rest: the major wait times, the fairly weak cocktails: they're just they way they are. Man that long island was some turrrable business though. Glad I only had a beer. Gotta protect the voice to swoon the ladies! hahaha.   Its 2 bucks a song and the drinks are a bit pricey (6 for a bottle of saporro? meh...) but pro tip: get your song list in order. If you want to sing 10 songs, write down 10 songs. If you decide mid way through, tough luck if you got a pretty nice crowd building up. Stake your claim and just relax for the rest of the night! That's what I'm doin' next time.",

It's small and it's not too loud. So, you can have drinks with friends in a comfortable environment, and enjoy the show. The staff is friendly, and the regulars are hilarious -- they clearly practice for performing on the stage at Festa. Drinks are a little pricey for the quality, but you're getting a show too.  Really fun place!  My one complaint is that they charge $2 a song after a certain hour (8pm?) even if there is clearly no one singing and few people in the bar. I'm grumbly about disincentivizing people from singing, when I came there to watch people sing (and that's why I'm paying a little more for booze).",

    "review_text": "This review should be prefaced by an admission: \u00a0I love Japan. \u00a0I don't mean I love Japan the way a person might love water skiing or chili dogs. \u00a0I love Japan the way you loved the girl you had a crush on in seventh grade. \u00a0About a year after I moved to Japan, I realized that if Japan had been personified as a woman, I would have either married her or gotten arrested by the Japanese Godzilla-helmet wearing police for stalking her, depending on how I did. \u00a0(And no, I didn't marry a Japanese woman as a way of fulfilling that strange desire and projecting it onto a person...that would have just been weird.)  So instead, in the many years since I've been back in America since living there, whenever I wander into places that are truly Japanese, I have a feeling of nostalgia that colors my judgment.  That would explain my behavior at Festa the other night. \u00a0Or it could be the drinks. \u00a0Both are perfectly plausible explanations.  So for starters, it's in Japantown and the bar is populated primarily by Japanese people. \u00a0I speak Japanese almost fluently (take note, Nance W. :) ) \u00a0but of course, no one expects me to, so I get in what we used to call the 'language bubble' in these places. \u00a0The language bubble is a situation where nobody expects you to speak a certain language, so they feel free to speak in that language, often in ways they wouldn't if they knew you could understand them. \u00a0  I knew this was a real Japanese karaoke bar for two reason: \u00a0the menu was small and had overpriced 'sunaku' (that means 'snacks') including the 'assorted plate' for $10, which was about 7 grapes, some cheese and crackers straight from nabicso and some kamaboko slices (don't ask.)  The second and more important reason is that everyone was doing what karaoke is really for: \u00a0humiliating themselves equally. \u00a0It's one of the ways of leveling society in Japan. \u00a0You bow to people all day higher or lower based on your social status in Japan, but once you're at the karaoke bar, everyone sucks equally, even the boss. \u00a0It's a pretty awesome tradition.  After a couple of fun-loving, corn-fed midwestern gals left the place after singing everything in the Michael Bolton catalog, it was time to get down to business. \u00a0Japanese songs were sung. \u00a0French 75s from earlier in the evening were impairing my ability to read kanji, and I never got around to singing my favorite Japanese karaoke song, 'Shima Uta.' \u00a0Buy me a drink there sometime and I'll do it.  Instead, I was pushed up onstage and made to sing (I forgot about this but it happens a lot) Elvis. \u00a0I decided that the thing to do was to just fully own it, so when 'Jailhouse Rock' came up, I just rocked that joint. \u00a0To paraphrase Samuel Jackson, to them I was Elvis.  Then came 'Are You Lonesome Tonight?' which was fine until I realized there's about a 2 minute speech in the middle of that song. \u00a0(\"I wonder if...you're lonesome tonight...\" \u00a0Itunes it if you've never heard that part.) \u00a0Anyway, it was effective, judging by the reaction of the bartender, but after that we still had to take it up tempo, as one more sappy tune like that would have killed me.  Finally, we got , as all white people in a Japanese karaoke bar must, to the Beatles. \u00a0After one rendition of \u00a0\"If I fell,\" I wanted to try it again, with my college buddy singing harmony, so from the stage, with microphone in hand, I asked them to play it again, but I spoke Japanese. \u00a0This was almost more than the room could bear. \u00a0What kind of a freak was I? \u00a0The language bubble was thoroughly popped, but the rockin' still didn't stop.  Finally, at the end of the night, the bill was inexplicably a lot higher than we thought, which almost brought a tear of joy \u00a0to my eye because that's always what happens in Japan too. \u00a0Plus, I wasn't paying.  Don't go to Festa (or any Japanese karaoke bar) hung up on singing well, or you'll make a jackass of yourself. \u00a0Just remember three words the local barkeep at the karaoke place where I lived used to say to us: \u00a0you must enjoy.  That's right. \u00a0You MUST enjoy. \u00a0The most Japanese thing of all is that just because it's fun doesn't mean you have a choice.  Festa is definitely on my list of places I must enjoy again when I'm in SF.",

After a few beers, he whipped up my Blue Tokyo, in layers.

The big Japanese beers here are ten bucks. \u00a0A carafe of cold sake will set you back about thirty bucks. \u00a0Being the Asian math whiz that I am I asked my drunken buddy from LA, would you rather have another sake or 3 big bottles of beer? \u00a0Not the math whiz but a practical fellow of course he picked quantity over quality.  I came here again with another friend from LA, in town for training this week. \u00a0She was dying to go out since she has 3 kids and her husband hates dancing, which is normal, doesn't drink, which is kinda abnormal, and doesn't like making a fool of himself in public singing karaoke, which hmmmm, is kinda normal.  I ordered a glass of sake and she got the lichee cocktail. \u00a0Oh the lichee was incredibly good. \u00a0So I made a pact with her. \u00a0I'll continue ordering sake for myself and foofoo drinks for her. \u00a0Then I'll drink half her drinks and we'll go through the entire foofoo menu... that way I can secretly indulge in my foofoo drink passion while maintaining some semblance of my masculinity. \u00a0Finally I gave up and just ordered myself a foofoo drink. \u00a0I just drank my pear cosmo like the man that I am... whatever that means. \u00a0  Overall the lichee cocktail was by far the best. \u00a0An extra star for that plus the cool vibe.",

    "review_text": "Doing Karaoke and playing Rock Band are simply NOT the same thing!  I can now say that with first-hand knowledge, having finally visited Festa, my first-ever Karaoke bar. \u00a0  Does singing in the shower count by way of preparation? \u00a0Sure! \u00a0Will enough practice with Rock Band let you swagger up on stage and start belting them out like Bruno Mars? \u00a0It can't hurt (and for that matter, neither does a few rounds of Dutch Courage), but at the end of the day, there's absolutely nothing like singing in front of a live audience.  I always wanted try Karaoke, but I never did; then I joined Yelp. \u00a0Some Yelpers are terrified of Karaoke, some are passing fond of it, and some (like my friend Bobby L., who's \"The Duke\" of Festa) were born with a mike in their hand and a song in their heart. \u00a0The Elite of the Elite Yelpers all have one thing in common though - they'll try almost anything once!  At the tail-end of a Winter night earlier this year, a car-load of uber-Elites and I drove to this very-well hidden bar in Japantown. \u00a0Earlier that night, we had visited Little Star for some world-class deep-dish pizza <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/little-star-pizza-san-francisco#hrid:pakEuBxSaTX6zgJmErQ0GQ\">yelp.com/biz/little-star\u2026</a>, then moved on to Cantina for some premium pre-Karaoke fortification. \u00a0I was feeling well-fed, well oil, and ready to wrestle 'gators when we arrived at the strip mall that contained Festa.  It's a good thing Bobby L., was driving - I never would have found the place in a 1000 years, even with the nav app in my Droid; well hidden doesn't begin to describe this bar! \u00a0Bobby could have found it in his sleep (and he probably has a few times) - displaying the ease of long practice, he guided us unerringly to the door. \u00a0We all walked in, and I took a look around.  The space is decidedly not big, about the size of an airport lounge; it has a small stage, with a twinkling city skyline backdrop, and a few tables huddled around it. \u00a0There's a bar against one wall. \u00a0The vibe is dive-bar intimate, and the crowd is friendly and supportive. \u00a0  Got any particular song in mind for your Karaoke debut? \u00a0They probably have it here! \u00a0There are 4 huge song books which are alphabetized by song title, artist, or language. \u00a0One of my friends started leafing through the book looking for a tune; I glanced over her shoulder, and saw \"That'll Be The Day\" by Buddy Holly - I remembered most of the words (heck, there are only about six of 'em) so that was my choice!  It's $2 per song, and no \"official\" DJ, so watch the prompter for your song - when it starts, you're on! \u00a0One by one and in pairs (duets are no problem here) my friends did the deed; then it was my turn. \u00a0I grabbed the mike, jumped up on stage, and sang for all I was worth...  While I probably could have scared The Dead with my caterwauling, I lived to tell the tale. \u00a0I got a real kick out of the Karaoke experience, and I'm sure I'll be trying it again in the not-to-distant future.  Festa is a great place for first-timers and veterans alike. \u00a0As this visit broke my Karaoke cherry, and I now fall into the latter category, I'll be back!",

I've been coming to Festa for more than a year, and it only gets better and better for me and my friends who come one or two times a month. The bartenders are exceptionally nice, (Ken, Shogo, Satoshi) and Masae-san the owner treats us like family. We feel like family to them because this place is so small -- they make an effort to get to know their customers, but also it's part of their business: they depend on their customers to become regulars and support their bar. I've brought more than 30 different friends here over the past year and everyone leaves craving another go; it's just hard not to fall in love with the support always ready for the singer, the service always ready to ensure you have a great time.  I think any of the disgruntled Yelps on this place haven't given it enough of a chance or don't fully understand how hard it must be to crowd control this place given it's so small -- it can get really rowdy in there, people start screaming into the microphone, get so drunk they break glasses or tip over tables, and because they do have a reservation policy for larger groups, sometimes you do have to move for folks who've paid an extra cover.  I agree with a lot of the Festa regulars who've said it's even better on a weeknight; part of the \"Cheers\"-like draw. There have been many a work conflict or a friend disagreement thawed out by the incredibly fun and hilarious environment. I've never walked out of the bar without someone's email address for future karaoke nights. Also, you get to sing more often as fewer people are in the bar, and this has been the best time to bring people nervous to sing. Interestingly, every single person who's ever been to Festa with me who was intimidated by the Festa stage upon walking in never wanted to leave it after their debut song.  It's just an awesome discovery in a town where going out at night can be frosty, unfamiliar and too much of a scene.  None of that here. I hesitate to profess my love for Festa because I'm afraid it will become even more popular. But my love for this place (and appreciation given how great they've been to me and my friends) is the reason why I'm shouting from the rooftops.   Go. Have fun. It's great.",

Also, music level was often much too high, drowning out the singers voice. I had to ask the barman to turn down the music on some of my more quieter numbers. Place seems pretty friendly, staff OK.

I just went here tonight. \u00a0The place is really small and there is about 6 tables total in addition to the 6 or 8 stools at the bar area. \u00a0There were two-three bartenders working.  I arrived there at 10PM to meet with my party of seven people and it was really mellow and a little bit dead. \u00a0Around 10:30PM, people started to sing and once they started, the ball started to roll.  I've never done public karaoke before, so I ordered some Lychee Martini's to loosen me up :) \u00a0It was quite tasty and the bartenders were very fast in delivery and attentive as well; they came around a few times to check on each table. \u00a0The negative is each drink cost $9.00.  There was a huge binder of songs, which was pretty cool --oldies to current pop/rock. \u00a0  I thought I'd actually be much more nervous on stage but I wasn't. \u00a0You come here expecting that people do not sing very well --it's not American Idol. \u00a0The people that I've met and witnessed tonight have all been really cool and friendly --very supportive and interactive with you when you are stumbling upon lost words. \u00a0I was actually singing a song that I have never heard and I got so much support from the crowd :) \u00a0They are very encouraging but in a non-pressuring kind of way --good folks.   Things were good until the owner started to move people around. \u00a0My group and I were asked to scoot in and squeeze together so that another group of people can sit down. This also happened to another table that was nearby us; there was an empty table where no one was sitting and the owner of the establishment had asked them to move from one table to the one where no one was sitting. \u00a0In addition to that, she took my drink away without asking if I was done with it. \u00a0  Keep in mind that we've been there for over an hour or two and we were drinking and singing actively on stage. \u00a0I thought what she did was extremely rude --the rest of my party agreed so we left.  To make matters worse, we went to close our bill and found out that they had charged us for three additional drinks when we paid for them already in cash. \u00a0We tried resolving the issue by speaking to them and they refused to take the amount off.   Our night turned sour very quickly -- we will definitely never come back to this place again.  Also, I saw the cheese plate from another table and I definitely would not recommend ordering that. \u00a0It was literally slices of over priced cheddar or cheap looking cheese. \u00a0I am not impressed at all.",

    "review_text": "I really wanted to like this place, especially after reading some good reviews about it. \u00a0I will NEVER return here.  Money grubbery - It is WAY too expensive. \u00a0My friend just had her birthday party there (weekend night) - they charged her a $10/person cover charge, my drink was $8 for a well drink, and then on top of that it was $2 PER song. \u00a0Then when she wanted to pull out her cake, they wanted to charge her an additional $20 to serve it. \u00a0So for 16 of us at the party to sing a song each (and have a SINGLE drink) it was $320! \u00a0You can get bottle service (including entry) at a shwanky night club for much less than that price.  Disorganization - On top of that they are incredibly disorganized with the karaoke. \u00a0Unlike other bars, which request people write their own names down on an organized song request form, this place hands you a blank piece of paper and no one writes their own name down. \u00a0When you hand it back to them, they put it in a disorganized pile of paper. \u00a0I put in my paper upon arrival at 9p and by 11p still it had not been entered in the machine (it shows the waitlist). \u00a0My friend paid for 20 songs for her party and had only used about 2-3 of them when I left - while the table next to us had one girl who went up three songs back to back. \u00a0Their complete lack of organization means a lot of the same people end up singing multiple times, and other people never get to go - all the while paying $2/song! \u00a0Other bars will usually let \"new\" people get priority to be more equitable.  Quality of atmosphere/service -  1. \u00a0Bartenders both bartend and KJ which means they are overwhelmed (explaining the disorganization) but it means it takes a while to get a drink or submit a song. \u00a0They should delegate one person to KJ only. 2. The microphones are awful! \u00a0Granted it's a karaoke bar not a music studio or anything, but these are perhaps the worst I've ever heard. 3. \u00a0One redeeming quality is that the bar itself has beautiful lighting and wood paneling, and it is a small intimate environment like other reviewers say. 4. \u00a0They do have a large song selection - which is also a plus.  I strongly recommend against this place. \u00a0I usually only write yelp reviews when I love or hate a place. \u00a0I think it is not worth the money. \u00a0There are too many other great places in SF. \u00a0 If you're reading this from the restaurant, I've offered constructive concrete changes that could improve your place of business.",

Located in the Japantown mall, it's a small bar with a karaoke stage. I've been to a couple bars with a public karaoke stage, but most of my karaoke experience in Japantown has been in private rooms, so this was a little new for me. I'm not much of a singer, but I love cheering on my friends!  We came by last Thursday and it was busy, but we managed to find a table shortly after we got there. A couple drinks, some karaoke songs, more drinks and even more karaoke songs and suddenly it was last call! Has it really been 3 hours already?! I guess I didn't notice since I was having so much fun!  The staff and bartenders are super nice and the atmosphere is very homey and cozy. Even though I'm used to private karaoke rooms, Festa has changed my mind about karaoke bars. You can have fun singing in front of strangers too!

Though I'm embarrassed to say I was only lucid for half the night, apparently that is the very essence of a really good time. \u00a0It seemed everyone else either didn't care, or rode the same shameless, tone-deaf bus that I did.  Needless to say, the drinks are strong. \u00a0REAL strong. \u00a0Pretty cool bartending crew. \u00a0I had reserved for a party of 12, so I had to pay about $10/head, PLUS 18% gratuity. \u00a0It's a bit steep for a kareoke bar, but given how packed it was, we were happy to have the prime real estate with a big table in the back.  By the end of the night, somehow an extra $34 got tacked onto the bill. \u00a0I'm pretty sure the final check was somewhere around $199 which already included gratuity. \u00a0That means, I had to have gotten out my little blackberry calculator and figure out 18% of $199 (the $34) - all in my totally inebriated state. \u00a0I don't remember doing it and was pretty unhappy to find that extra charge on my credit card a week later. \u00a0Now, the next part is what really made me like Festa - I called and left a message asking for a copy of the signed receipt. Masae, the manager who was out of town the day of my party, called me back personally to go over the charges. \u00a0We're still not clear on what happened that night. \u00a0Given my utter blackout, it's very possible I just made a mistake. \u00a0But she was happy to send me a credit for the extra amount to use the next time I went in - even though she said that amount probably went home with the bartenders and not to the bar. \u00a0And because of this I will definitely be going back.",

As Festa is located in Japantown I had the feeling that their financial strategy was to cater to out-of-towners wanting some karaoke action in the city.  That's all fine and good, what I cannot accept is charging $8 for Doritos and trying to double tip trickery.  If you are charging $8 for guacamole and chips, and you cannot serve Doritos. I'm pretty sure there's a law against it. Now, don't get me wrong. I love Doritos, but I love them when I pay 99 cents a bag, not a $8 dollars. The second offense was more serious though.   When I went to pay the bill, my credit card had been charged a little more than I had expected. There was still the tipping space left blank so I assumed that maybe another item had been added to my bill. Low and behold, they had an 18% tip added because we were part of a group. The waitress explained this fact after the matter and pointed to a dark corner where there was 12-point font that explained their policy. OK, that's fine that that's your policy, what is not ok, is trying to get a double tip by presenting a receipt where there is a blank spot for the tipping section, and not mentioning that you've already received tip.   Service was terrible anyway, which makes that 18% tip all the more ridiculous.",

It's pretty inmate here, I wish it was bigger or that they'd expand it a little. The bar area could be minimized to increase the efficiency. The same could be said about the narrow hallway as well. What's really funny is that the sound of the place could be projected out onto the streets, and delight people passing by.  Drinks weren't cheap, and the bartenders had a hard time keeping track of who bought which drinks, so our tabs were mixed up pretty well at the end of the night. They have every single song you can think of. The stage is tiny as well, but we managed to fit 8 people up there, although it was a very tight squeeze. They charge for each song that you sing, which is a first for me at a karaoke place. You mean I have to PAY to humiliate myself for other people's entertainment?

And I speak from my experience at Festa!  We had just done room-style karaoke at a random sketchy place a little further down Fillmore. The lack of English selection there was just not cutting it for us, so we peaced out after an hour in search of something else in the area. Walking on Post, I saw the sign for Festa, and remembered my cousin had always raved about that place. We decided to hop into Japantown to check it out.  The minute we walked in, I randomly saw my supercool friend Jason C. on stage singing with a drunk dude and instantly knew it was gonna be a good night. He saw me just as the next song he requested--Total Eclipse of the Heart, one of my go-tos--was coming on, and called me up to sing with him. So I did! Ain't no thang. The crowd loved it... just sayin'. That's how I roll at karaoke.  But seriously. This spot has officially won me over as my favorite karaoke bar in SF. It's a bit smaller than the other ones I've been to, but as a result there are less people and you have more chances to sing. I think the size also makes it's impossible for you to have left the bar without making new friends (maybe it was just the night I went, but the crowd vibe here is super fun). There's also a full bar with the friendliest people ever serving you huge Sapporo beers ($10). The twinkling city skyline backdrop on the stage is not as cheesy as it sounds and only adds to the magic.  And of course, you never know who you'll run into here. Shoutout to my buddy Jason C.

It has all the qualities of a great night: amazing bar and bartenders, easy (FREE) street parking after 8 pm, several hundred songs to choose from AND those classy Asian karaoke music videos playing in the background. There is absolutely nothing more I could ask for.  Festa is such a local joint. If someone snaps a picture of you singing in front of the fake skyline onstage or merrymaking with some pals in those obnoxious red swivel seats, only locals would know where you are. I love that about Festa. Plus the door guy is cute so don't forget to chop it up with him.

There are endless booklets of English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese songs to choose from. And ALL the music videos have absolutely nothing to do with the song it's played with.   Well, this is definitely NOT that kind of karaoke place.  This is an OPEN MIC karaoke place. Brave souls (or just really drunk people) can sign up to sing whatever song they want to the entire bar. I can see where the appeal is after you've hammered a few drinks. They may be loud and out of tune, but they're definitely having fun!  The bar itself is tiny and located inside the Kinokuniya building in Japantown. It's shoved in a little corner on the second level. If you have a hard time finding the place, just listen for the faint yet amplified screams of tone-deafness.   It may be small, but it's a full bar inside! They even have soju and sake by the bottle!   With a great selection of alcohol and the endless volunteers for karaoke, you can be entertained for hours! And if you can't stand the sound, take a breather in the hallway or down another drink. =P",

Also hassled again when a new comer came in to check it out and just say hello to us- we were still working on a large sake. For some reason they SHORTENED happy hour to 1 hour (okkkk?). They advertise happy hour for 2 hours when in actuality it's one hour from 8-9pm and by 8:30pm they will charge $2/song for the simple reason that by the time your song gets played it would be past 9pm. Now no one is saying that $2/song is too much for karaoke but when you're friends are being told to, \"not make a big deal about it\" it really sends a tactless message to new patrons. I talk this place up all the time but truly- it seems to be turning into a sham of a nightlife establishment. It is so unfortunate to us veterans to know that a gem like Festa is going down hill from here. We ended up paying just as much for a private room at DoReMi karaoke studio down the street and had an epic time!",

Unlike the regular asian places where there's no central point of look at everyone just looks at the screen, this is more how I thought karaoke should be. With one or two people singing the actual song in front and being able to put on a real performance.   The alcohol was decent and regularly priced, the service was excellent, and they had giant song books with pretty much every song known to man. There are of course exceptions (really no OffSpring?), but whatever. They also have far more modern stuff, this is the only place I've seen Lady Gaga in. They even had the latest Katy Perry song (the one that just came out from the date of this review).   One weird thing was that the books titles were mixed up. The one that was sorted by artist was sorted by title, the one by title was actually by artist. UPDATE: This was fixed, apparently the owner reads Yelp reviews, if only there was 6 stars?",

I walked in with a group of about 8 friends around 11. The server asked me for my order first, and being that we had just walked about 15 blocks, I said I just wanted a \"water for now.\" The waiter told me I had to order something else. I thought he might be joking, so I just stared at him. I told him I was going to order a drink in a bit, and he said \"everybody lies and says that. You have to order your drink now or else i will charge you for the water.\" I turned to my friend and audibly requested that she order the controversial H2O on my behalf. She ordered a beer and a water, and when he brought back all the drinks for the table he shot me a dirty look and ceremoniously sat the water down RIGHT in front of my friend.  We all sang a bunch of songs and actually had a pretty good time (although I credit that to the musical stylings of my crew). We were not at all shocked to find that when our checks came we found mysterious and random charges. I asked why my $9 lychee martini (which was made with well vodka and was one of the worst I've had) came out at 12. The bartender told me \"sometimes the owner adds a gratuity. If you have an issue you are going to need to take it up with her.\" The owner was glaring at our group (which brought in the bulk of their business that night and made friends with most of the other patrons) so I just paid and left. Even though I begrudgingly admit it is a fun environment, I will NEVER go here again and encourage you to find a place that does not bite the hand that feeds.",

(With a pretty damn good song list, including songs in Korean and Japanese.)  There weren't that many people when we got there, so we commandeered a few tables and a lot of chairs and ordered some drinks (a liiiiiittle on the pricey side, but it's near a hotel, so I guess that's somewhat understandable). \u00a0I did my best Mariah Carey impersonation and was warmly received by the enthusiastic audience. \u00a0As the night went on, more and more people came in and joined in the karaoke festivities. \u00a0Fun little spot, complete with swanky decor and illuminated cityscape backdrop on the karaoke stage. \u00a0It was fantastic, and I would most definitely go there again!",

It took A LOT of visits for me to finally have to courage to go up and sing. \u00a0Keep in mind, I am not a singer, but I enjoy singing tunes while I'm driving so this was a way to share some of my favorites to the audience at Festa. \u00a0Of course once you get used to being up on their stage, you get really comfortable and then actually want to belt out tunes on a whim. \u00a0If you're just starting out, I really recommend going Sunday-Wed when it's not as busy and you can get in more than one song. \u00a0The crowds are usually full of regulars during these times and they are really cool folks. \u00a0The song selections are pretty extensive and they get updated periodically.  I don't drink much alcohol but they do have a nice menu of wine, cocktails, and beer. \u00a0So it's a great spot to take a group of friends or family for some drinks and entertainment.  I really have to thank Bobby L. for introducing me to Festa. \u00a0It's become a great new hangout for me with a great atmosphere, cool people, and fun musical entertainment.",

    "review_text": "I found this place while visiting family during Thanksgiving break (Sister in law played a show at Yoshi's around the corner). The first time we walked in it was completely packed, so we hit another bar and came back at around 12:45a.m.   When we (party of 5) returned the place was about half full, yet it still took over 20 minutes before anyone approached our table (the guy at the front entrance). I asked him if I could order a drink from him, he went and got someone.   By now only half of us wanted to keep drinking. Our waiter told us it was a rule that each person had to order a drink. At this point our party kept looking at the menu.   Two songs were ordered at $2 each before the book was taken away from us because \"we're just full.\" Another, delightfully smiley server came and asked us to order drinks- one per person. All but one of us ordered a beverage.   During one of our songs, another girl jumped on stage and stole the song.   When I was billed, I was arbitrarily charged $2 for not having everyone buy a drink at my table. I asked the server to charge me appropriately. He did, rudely. Then added a dollar in \"sales tax.\" Not only is alcohol not supposed to have a sales tax unless you're in a restaurant, the tax was just not right.   I asked the server for his name and he replied, \"I don't have to give you my name.\" Of course not. He was the only white server on the Friday after Thanksgiving with brown hair and some facial hair.   I love supporting small business because of the quality of service. I am an excellent tipper and say my please and thank yous. This place gave me the worst service in San Francisco during my 5 day visit.

I'd argue that the ambiance of Festa is worth the trek to Japantown alone. Then again, I was really drunk when we got there. There's really no excuse for the wallet-walloping drink costs &amp; the $2/song request fee.  Seriously? You're CHARGING for each request? Aren't we supposed to just TIP really well so that you'll play them? They're really not down with Formalities here.  Still, a great time was had by all, &amp; this is definitely the kind of bizarre place you will feel priviledged to close your night out at.

ANYWAYS...  i'm a huge fan of karaoke and was surprised to learn that you have to pay $2 to sing. \u00a0uh, come again? \u00a0and the guy who manages the karaoke thing told my friends that the song order is not done by who gets their songs in first but instead by table to limit repeats or something. \u00a0yeah, well, what we didn't know is that you can slip the karaoke guy some extra money to get your song bumped up to the top of the list. \u00a0we learned this when someone in our group had to wait like 45 minutes for their song.  seems like it could be a fun place... but over-charging for drinks, charging for karaoke, limited seating... no thanks.",

Walking into this scene made me instantly melancholy and perhaps a little icked out, but I knew there was a bigger reason for my presence, and it wasn't the decor. Karaoke!  When I discovered the drink list and the option of a lychee martini, things were looking up considerably. Especially when the bartender humored my request to modify the recipe ever so slightly. My drink was fantastic, so I had two more.  Liquid courage on the rise, I jumped on stage with my cohorts for a group effort and then once more on my own. The friendliness of the crowd encouraged these actions; everyone there was like one big support system and the biggest fan of whoever was on stage at any given time.   Songs were $2 a pop, which could add up quickly depending on how much you like the limelight. Our final group song started playing only after we started to make our way towards the exit. In unison, we graced the ears of Japan Town with our loud homage to The Darkness' \"I Believe in a Thing Called Love\" as we stumbled into the night.",

Depressing songs -- i.e. I will remember you by Sarah Mclachlan. You may have the voice of an Angel my dear, but this song gets everybody down.  2. Super looong songs -- remember Meatloaf's I will do anything for love? yeah. it goes on F-O-R-E-V-E-R.  3. Prince's songs complete with an exact rendition of Prince's voice. (same goes for the Bee Gees!) Just DON'T. Unless you're cute like my sis then it's okay.  This intimate lounge sure brings the fiesta to Japantown. It's located inside the Kinokuniya strip mall. There isn't a happy hour for drinks, but if you come between 8 - 9pm on Mon - Thurs, songs are free just mention yelp. Otherwise, It's $2 per song (good luck finding it!) if you're like one of those people with crappy memory like I do who can't remember the artist or the exact song title, the thick binder of songs will have you searching for awhile. Plus, you have to watch the screen when your song comes up and make a dash for the stage since there isn't an official DJ here.   You'll have a good time here for sure! The crowd is supportive and it doesn't matter if you've fallen off your chair twice (some guy, not me!) or can't carry a tune, people won't judge you here.

A TV screen in front of the stage displays song lyrics. The song selection was pretty good - a fair number Western, Japanese, and even Korean tunes.   This Japantown spot is Japanese-owned and bartended. The bartenders are very cool and the atmosphere is lively and fun.

Do wear whatever you want, but I don't. I just hate shorts.  Thing is this, if they speak more text book perfect Japanese gets more obnoxious because sometimes missing the etiquette. I don't really care all hysteric-Japanese etiquette but there is something you shouldn't say certain thing in Japanese especially to older man. To speak older Japanese men is annoyingly difficult because they are such an arrogant prick sometimes. Am I arrogant prick sometimes? FXXX No, well, I try not to.  Translate perfect Japanese from English does not make a perfect communication yet between real persons.  But, Karaoke? Karaoke. Kuh lah oh kay? Key raw o kee? Do I Karaoke? Hell No. I was always Karaoke hater. I thought Karaoke is such a pathetic Japo-thing.  But talking about communication.  I found out Karaoke is the thing, universally effective to get together, to be happy to all kind.  I had a great Karaoke time at Festa in the west building at Japan Town. It's a small but nice, modern, cozy and cool place for Karaoke &amp; drinks. There are really cool &amp; nice bartenders.  I think there were 5 different group of people but it was like a talent show. I liked that no one was pushing me to sing on the stage! That was great. If you don't want to, it's OK. You can have fun too like I did.  I still think the guy sang Xanadoo and the theme song for Hanshin Tigers were BLAST! Can you imagine that all of us were singing so loud Xanadu?  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7m1UWSD-FaA%26feature%3Drelated&amp;s=3f5c70befdaec1483f49642c668e8ff696db9bcc2d3cf315fce651e6904182b9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com/watch?v=7m1U\u2026</a>  Oh FXXX Yeah, we were so gay and I loved it!  But the greatest singers were following: Berna Diva Gracy Pho Kay Jay. she isn't Korean Japanese.  No one can beat them. No one. So as Ed M. It was his birth day party but we forgot all about it but just singing. Happy Birth day Ed!",

All of a sudden you find yourself grasping onto the mic just a little bit more, that sort of thing. Karaoke is to have fun and Festa, without a doubt, provides a fun atmosphere where patrons can sing the blues, wail about love, and anything else their little hearts desire. When there are more than 2 singers on stage, they ever so graciously provide another mic. Nice touch, as not everyone wants to be just another back up singer. Ahhh, minor detail: Requested water, and was brought a bottle of it. Hmmm. Like I said, minor detail. Belt it out, honey.",

You are a small little venue that makes it hard to believe that my imaginary manager would book a venue that small to rock out in.   2. I guess your drinks are a bit pricey. I spent $22.00 on two drinks, and decided that: -a. I will not be drunk enough to rock, out especially in a venue so small that it wouldn't be able to contain all the glory that is... DANTASTICO!  -b. I had already had 2 liters of beer for free so I wasn't jones'n for more alcohol.   3. What the hell city scape in the background of the stage is that supposed to be? Toronto?   4. I will admit, it is one of the more... fancy karaoke bars I have been to, especially in San FranDisco.   5. The patrons there are magical. Everyone clapped for everyone, everyone was a back up singer for everyone, even if they didn't know the words to the songs... ITS KARAOKE there are words on the t.v screens so everyone was able to do back up vocals.   6. You have a good list of song options, BUT not a great list of song options... yeah I said it.   7.You turned me down! YOU TURNED ME DOWN WHEN I WAS GOING TO SING BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY!....

I told her I had been there a thousand times and would be happy to pay extra to just sing - that we were full and weren't going to stay long. t could understand if the place wasn't empty, or if I hadn't already paid for the overpriced Voss water.

Since I haven't lived here for very long, I've not had a chance to visit many karaoke bars in the city. However, I find it mildly offensive that they charge $2 per song to sing.

Located in the heart of Japan Town, this karaoke bar is just what you need to prove your friends wrong. Rock the mic without shame and I assure you, the crowd will be behind you 100 percent!   I'm more accustomed to private room style karaoke where the only people who can witness your shamelessness are the people in your group (usually your \"so-called\" friends). This type of karaoke should be more intimidating but once you realize that the people that go up on stage ahead of you don't have any qualms about looking like complete idiots, your confidence will take a significant spike.   It's funny how cheesy 80's and 90's songs bring everyone together. At one point, I got up there and rocked \"Semi Charmed Kind Of Life\" with some drunk sot who was up there butchering the song. Everyone in there, regardless of which group they belong to, always cheers you on and sings along no matter how off key you are. I guess that's why it's always a good idea to pair karaoke with alcohol. Can you imagine how we must sound without it?  Good times!  4.4 stars",

The wait for the songs isn't bad either, and the waiting list is displayed at the end of every song so people can get ready. Overall, a really fun place with reasonable prices and good service. I had one drink and it was strong, and I'm sure every one else's were too.

FESTA is a small, odd &amp; yet interestingly conceptual place.   WHEN you can get the staff to bother paying attention to you and get your drink order which they are supposed to do, they take their time like we are serving them...They need to remember the customer is the person being served (not them), wait staff is supposed to serve their customers in a polite, warm and inviting way so customers will return, insuring wait staff income to live.   A date introduced this place to me in November of 2008. They were rude from the first second we walked in....it took forever to get a drink and them they were wrong every time we order another round.   Paying eight bucks a glass for a wine that I would not serve mass murders is a crime. Ever changing pricing is illegal and a crime here.   The wait staff was suspicious of my date and I at first, but they were making too much fun and saying disgustingly ignorant remarks about a table of women that they concluded were lesbians. When they when they realized we were gay became out right offensive. They talked about us, not realizing that between the two of us we understood fag comments in the several languages they tried to hide their barbaric attitudes.   All night long PEOPLE complained about not getting to sing their songs. That is because we found out later after some people left not getting their requests is because if you are not a friend of the owners then you are screwed. They charge $2.00 for the song request, then keep the money after not playing them and they use the money to buy drinks later. If they were an intelligent customer serve oriented business they could just keep a simple list in order to request songs and avoid the whole thing, but no they deliberately piss off paying customers.   If your WHITE in this bar, forget it, the owner and staff are going to make you pay for whatever transgression every white person has ever done to anyone in the history of the planet. And God forbid you are Asian, but not Japanese, you are even more screwed.   I think everyone on Yelp should call the Mayor's Office, Police Dept and the Human Rights Commission and complain about illegal business practice, racism and hate crimes toward the LGBT community. Then we could form a class action suit and sue their asses out of business.   And for the Japan Town business community, I feel sorry because this place does not reflect the good people that run professional businesses in anyway....it just hurts that community.   They should change the name to FESTER, because that is what it does and one day someone will lance the boil of that Festering place supposed there to serve people.",

Nice hostesses and bartenders, and I just like the idea of being able to pay per song and just hang out for a few hours without having to pay a \"per hour\" fee like private karaoke rooms.   Pretty good drinks too. My favorite so far has been the lychee cocktail. The Blue Tokyo is a little too strong for me, and the saketini is.. interesting. If you like sake, you'll probably like it.   There is a wide range of singers/people that come here. You don't have to be the \"karaoke-type\" to enjoy it. You seem to get them all here-- Japanophiles singing in Japanese, Asian people, non-Asian people, good singers, amazing singers, not so good singers, older Korean lady belting out cheesy Korean songs. Good oldies seem to dominate the list of requested songs. \u00a0  The downside:  Here are some reasons why I knocked off 2 stars. - The price of the drinks. I know a cocktail for $9-10 isn't ridiculous, but... it gets old after a couple of drinks, and I wish they had more of a variety on their menu. They basically have expensive cocktails, cheaper beer ($5-10), and very expensive wine.   - the selection of the songs. Ya, they have Japanese and Korean songs, and a great selection of older songs, but their newest page (as of March) was songs from January 2010, and even then, they didn't have any Gaga! This complaint is really only half-serious, but how could you not have any Gaga? Even just a few from her first album?? Maybe they don't wanna hear it every night.   - the wait-time for your requested songs. Our group waited about 30 minutes for one song, and about an hour for our second song, even though we requested them within one minute of each other. You definitely have to come in, sit down, request a song first, and then buy drinks, enjoy yourselves, etc. If you hold off too long to request a song, your wait time will just get longer and longer. Definitely a different kind of karaoke experience for me, because I'm used to private rooms. Just keep in mind that you can't just decide at the last minute you wanna sing something--",

NOBODY PUTS BABY IN THE CORNER!  so for all you jennifer greys out there with the fat luther vandross stuck inside of you, go to festa for your first stab at this obnoxious pasttime! the crowd is tolerant (and small), there's no interior visibility from the outside (so you can save face), they have a decent soju/sake selection, and the service is friendly.  oh, and it's LEGAL! it's a perfect stepping stone towards ultimate voluntary public humiliation, which is auditioning for american idol and not being picked, a la william hung.  go!",

You'll probably never see these people again, so it's ok to embarrass yourself. \u00a0AND, they were all pretty drunk, so everyone's just having a grand ol' time :)  I love it. \u00a0I don't think I'm ever going back to traditional karaoke :)",

Tucked in the side pocket of a shopping mall in Japantown, I happened in here on the tip of some folks in the know for an evening of revelry and off-kilter crooning.   The best part about Festa has to be that they don't announce your track - essentially, you have to pay attention -- and even then -- once your song starts, you have to haul ass to get up there in time for the beginning (or chorus, or coda, or whatever's left) of your song. This results in more than the requisite helping of hilarity, and at some point in the night a pack of my group camped out on stage for what no doubt seemed like four and a half years. Shorter to run, I gather. I love the cityscape backdrop, a tiny homage to the city surrounding (and cities everywhere, I gather). And like most knock offs in this place, packed with personality.",

The place is small but very well decorated with a decent karaoke stage in the corner of the room. Drinks were strong (too strong for my gin and tonic. It tasted like straight gin but some may like that! ) and a little on the higher end price-wise (16 for the gin and tonic and a bud light in a bottle).   The bartender was a bit rude, forgot our beer and acted put off that I reminded her about it. We only ended up staying a few minutes before she came to our table and told us that they would be closing early due to lack of customers (there were at least 11 other people in the place, which was a decent amount considering the size). We weren't even halfway done with our drinks before they were kicking us out, which was a huge turnoff. I've never been booted out of a bar before (well, only when I've been a bit naughty) and it made us uncomfortable, so we left without even finishing our drinks. Wish we had made it a block further and headed to the Boom Boom Room instead. We won't be returning.",

You have to pay attention to the screen or you might miss your song. Whatever.  Usually when there's a minimum someone comes up to you and asks for your order right away, but we weren't approached for about 30 minutes. When they did, they asked if we ordered a drink and that they found a whiskey bottle near our table. They falsely accused us of sneaking it in, and told us that if we didn't order drinks that we'd have to leave - never mind the fact that we already put in money for karaoke and were still waiting for one more song. Thankfully the song came up, I belted the tune, and we promptly left.  Rude staff, rude owner, overpriced drinks, karaoke charged by the song. I am never coming back.",

They didn't seem to care though, so I would rather like to just never come here again.  One last thing I'd like to mention, me and my friends ordered tea here, which cost $5 each. Sounds really expensive for tea, yeah, but I've spent that much at tea lounges before, and it's usually worth it, but they gave us the cheapest brand of tea you can get for $1 a box in chinatown.

I thought then that I was in for a good night, but boy was I wrong. \u00a0I don't even know where to begin.  I went on a Friday not expecting to get a million songs in, but hoping for at least 1 or 2. \u00a0I understand how the queuing process generally works at karaoke bars, so I had no problem putting in a couple song requests, having a couple drinks, taking in the other performances, and waiting. The cost per song here is $2, which is fine by me if that means less people will be inundating the KJ with drunken song requests. \u00a0  I watched as the same people came up to the stage over and over, as many as 4 times, before anyone in my party even got a single song in. \u00a0It was not a question of the other people getting to the bar before us- I saw them come in at least 20 minutes after I arrived at Festa.  As the night passed, I realized that some of the repeat singers were friends of the owner. \u00a0They were seated at a table that we were told was reserved for a large party. \u00a0When the party came in, I was asked to move from my non-reserved table to make up for the space that the friends were taking at the table that had been reserved.  If the table moving experience wasn't enough of an annoyance, my song NEVER came up. \u00a0After 90 minutes had passed, I inquired about my song and saw it about 3 songs back in the queue atop a large stack of my groups requests (some of which had been paid for in cash in advance at the bar). \u00a030 minutes later my song still didn't come up. \u00a0When I asked about it this time, hoping for a real explanation, the KJ said that it was the way the line worked and assured me it was all fair, and that my song was still 5 songs away. \u00a0So after 2 hours of patiently waiting, cheering on other singers, and buying drinks, I told the KJ to remove all my songs requests.  When I went to close out my tab, I was charged an 18% automatic gratuity for being a part of a group of 6 or more people. \u00a0Granted, there were 6 of us, but we were never served as a group, and none of the others were charged this gratuity. \u00a0It seemed to have been made up on the spot. \u00a0And after 2 hours of being ignored, I was in no mood to leave a tip at all, none the less an 18% tip.  The entire night my group got 3 songs in TOTAL while EACH REGULAR got AT LEAST 2 songs in, and as many as 4.  It really is a shame, I was ready to give up on other karaoke spots in favor of the warm ambiance of Festa. \u00a0But after being treated as I was, I can't say that I will ever go back. \u00a0  Only go here if you are a friend of the owner. \u00a0Don't go in groups of 6, don't make friends with another table so they think you are a group of 6. \u00a0But better still, just go somewhere else where you won't be treated like shit.",

Not the typical karaoke joint that have rooms for rental and you pay by the hour - the typical karaoke experience. Here, it's all about the on-stage experience. Warbling and all this is the karaoke I go most often now.  Songs are $2 per, which is not cheap compared to other places. The drinks are not cheap either but also not super expensive. The money saved on not renting a room goes towards my drinks, yeah! Factor in the cost of renting a private room the bill for the night is actually cheaper.  And, like at any bar or club or lounge you should become a regular. Then, the bartenders will treat you better. I like the staff here, very friendly but not displaying favoritism like at other venues.  Note there are other karaoke joints in the Bay Area that has a stage for singing, some of them have rooms and some don't. I still prefer having both options so can pick and choose depending on the group. It's really a four star venue but the bartenders and owner earned the final star.

It's the perfect mix of intimate space, public stage, and convenient bar at the ready--instead of having to smuggle alcohol into those little karaoke studios. Plus, Festa has the best song selection--other studios either don't have a lot of good songs or the musical accompaniment sounds like a 7-year old playing on their Casio keyboard for you. And let's not even talk about the weird videos other studios show while your song is playing.  I've witnessed others having a bad time at Festa, and it's usually because they're totally hammered or they expect Diva service. Public drinking and karaoke can get really messy, and I often sympathize with the staff at Festa because the crowd often gets unruly, especially towards the end of the night.  I highly recommend going to Festa early in the evening during the week. (The drinks are cheaper and songs are free before 9:30.) All of your requests will be played immediately and you get excellent service. Once the place gets packed around 9:30/10pm, all hell can break loose, and at that point you just need to go with the flow.",

He said he could hold it, and shoved me toward the bathroom. When I came out, he was on the stage singing \"Poison\" by Bell Biv DeVoe with his friend.   (which is a great transition to my next thought)  My thoughts on public karaoke in the words of Bell Biv DeVoe:   If I were you I'd take precautionnnn...  before doing karaoke with Yelpers, because the odds are, one of them has it recorded on their camera.   And if you slight one of them, ooooh, that might surface on the Internet.   But then again, my threshold for public humiliation might be really low, so what do I know?",

    "review_text": "Quite possibly the best karaoke spot in the entire Bay Area...   Nestled in a Japantown shopping center, this is an itty bitty bar. You could easily walk by and miss it altogether, especially since it doesn't get bumpin' until way after all of the surrounding stores are closed. If you walk in and see an unidentified skyline on the small stage, you know you've come to the right place.  What I like best about this particular karaoke joint is the fact that everyone pays $2 to sing and there's no cheeseball KJ there to sweet talk. Just write down your song selection, hand it to the bartender and they'll queue it up and add the monies to your overall tab. Brilliant! This way, it's all fair and square.  I've been here a handful of times and it's always a blast. Since the setting is so intimate, it's impossible not to get \u00a0caught up into whatever song the person on stage is singing. Definitely a great place to make new friends. Or run into existing ones, like I did the other night when I ran into Bobby L and a few other South Bay yelpers :) BTW, what were you guys doing so far from San Jose so late????",

Pay particularly close attention to the completely unrelated b-roll footage that rolls behind the lyrics - it ranged from Demi Moore headshots during Total Eclipse of the Heart to water treatment plants during the Backstreet Boys.

But last night... wow... me and my friends (the same ones from last time) decided to come here after a late dinner for some drinks and entertainment. Boy were we in for a treat! We came in it was pretty empty which we didnt think much of because it was a Wednesday night. This man (theres a picture of him in all black wearing a hat) came to seat us, we really didnt need his help being that only 2 tables were being occupied (we were waiting for the rest of our party, but we followed him to the table. He giggled and made our party show ID. So we were looking through the book of songs from \"Septemeber 2008\" and the waitress came over to take our drink orders. 2 people in our party didnt want to drink but she said \"there's a one drink minimum\" (which we didnt have before) so they ordered drinks and we moved on. So we waited a little while for our drinks, when they came the waitress spilled one of them on my friend. I had a mojito that was VERY watery and small for $9. Before we could finish our drinks she came to ask us about our bill. 2 people were together and the other 3 were with me. She came back with 3 checks, i had my card out already so i grabbed my two checks and handed it back to her... My other friend decided to keep her tab opened. So the waitress returned with my reciept I signed it. Left no tip becuz I was planning on leaving cash after I was done drinking. The waitress took the check. After the males in our group stepped out for a smoke, the giggling man came to our table and told me \"Um, you didnt leave a \u00a0tip\"; I told him \"I know, I was going to leave cash when Im done\" He then says \"This is America, you need to leave a 20% tip!\" Um... I don't recall seeing that in the constitution, so my response of shock and laughter was understandable. When our other friends come back we tell them the story and they laugh. So Im still there sipping on my mint water when one of our friends goes to get one more drink and to close their tab. The giggling man told him \"Make sure she gives a tip\" which my friend tells me. His wife is going over their tab and they were charged extra money. So we approach the bar because we are leaving; they tell her they charged her $3 tax for keeping their tab open... Now, to me this is something that \u00a0they should had stated when they decided to keep the tab open. So, in the end they over charged my friend and recieved no tip from me because they were very rude by asking me for a tip when I was not leaving. Guess I we will have to just find a neww spot because I will never be back to this place ever again!",

    "review_text": "SELECTION OF SONGS GETS 5 STARS!!!! Never in my life have I seen such a huge selection of Crystal Kay and Amuro Namie jams to sing. I was in heaven!  When I first got there, it was about 8 or so so not many people were there yet. I had a saketini. It was OK. (After trying my 3rd saketini at this bar, I'm beginning to realize I'm not a fan of the saketini. Lol.) Luckily it was free bc some old Japanese dude bought it for me. Hooray!  Since there weren't alot of people in the beginning, there were many opportunities to sing. Everyone was really friendly and welcoming. I just got there that day and already I felt like I was at home. Is this what they talk about when they say friendly people live in San Francisco?  Maybe... but singing here does not come free.  Well, before I left, I was told to pay $2 PER SONG and the guy scribbled a bill on a scratch sheet of paper. I've been to so many karaoke places and never did I have to pay per song. I thought he was joking, laughed it off, and left the bar. Well, next thing you know, the guy follows me and shows up OUTSIDE of the bar still asking me to pay for the 5 songs I sang. He tells me I owe him $10 and his manager was going to get mad at him if he didn't pay for those 5 songs. I still think he was joking. He insisted he wasn't so I followed him to the bar so he could show me proof. O man o man. He wasn't joking!! In fine print, it says \"$2 per song.\"   Ironically, I come in here later on to show this place to some random people who were wanting to karaoke. And apparently this happens alot. Another confused customer was listening to another worker from this bar explain about the $2 per song bill. Lol.   I was in Kinokuniya on Monday and I could hear people jamming it out here through the walls. Lol. I guess they are open everynight.  So, in short, I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY like this place for their very friendly atmosphere, extensive song collection listed by artist, and being open everynight. But I don't like it for their $2 per song deal.",

It's very entertaining just watching those people sing no matter how good or how bad they sing. You have to be 21 to get into this place if you want to sing since they serve alcohol drinks.   If you order drinks, it's a bit pricy. I order Pear Cosmo for $9. I order this drink cause I never cosmo with pear flavor and also thought it'll be a sweet kind of cocktail. I was sure wrong.

Bad business practices...  Shame shame shame  ****************  I think without my bad experience this would be 3 stars but experience shapes the review so 2 it is. \u00a0 I have been here before and had a great time. \u00a0We come, we karaoke, we drink, we laugh... Good times. \u00a0 The last time I came here it was a tad off. \u00a0Firstly, it was crowded, which is good for business but I think that's a sign that the *****DJs shouldn't sing in between people.***** \u00a0It takes up room for the patrons to sing... Not all of my friends got a chance to sing and I had a party of 6 and we were there for 3 hours.  Secondly, the song selection is very weak and you can't hear yourself sing. No Roy Orbison?  Thirdly, they start cleaning and kicking people out right at 1:30 am. \u00a0I hadn't finished my very expensive champagne and I was being ushered out! \u00a0They did try and be nice about having poor customer service saying \u00a0its the law and all this business about their license... I get it, but how is their licensing so different from any other joint in SF? Whatever.. Fourthly, this is the worst part... When they asked for my card to close my tab I did as I was told. \u00a0I bought one bottle of my favorite champagne for $80... They handed me the receipt to sign and said they added gratuity....??????????? I shared 1 bottle of champagne with my boyfriend!!!!! And they charged me 30% gratuity without asking!!!!!!!! 30% ?! ?!?! \u00a0Where do you get a number like that and why do you charge your patrons a gratuity?!! I filled our glasses each time... I shouldn't have to tip them $30 for walking a bottle 3 feet from the bar to my table, right?!?! And not have a say?!?! Of course when I try to dispute this I am ushered away and out, \u00a0not even able to finish my last glass. \u00a0Very bad service!!! The readers of this review may wonder why there is 2 stars instead of 1..... Well, the fact they HAD my favorite champagne for sale at a karaoke joint is notable. \u00a0And I did have fun, more because of my friends and the other patrons but never the less... I will not come back! \u00a0There are way too many karaoke joints.. Ones that stay open till 4 am... That won't charge your party of two 30% gratuity .",

After an evening of hopping lounges and karaoke bars, my group decided to head here to finish off the night. The prices are a lot cheaper than renting private rooms and the stage and lounge area is intimate enough to where you don't feel intimdiating standing up on stage. I thought the sound equipment was also a lot better, although, a few additional screens (namely in front of you) would have been better than having to keep looking off to the side on a smallish screen on a shelf for lyrics.   Again, great intimate lounge with some of the best singers I've heard yet (aside from Martuni's) and at only $2 bucks a song, you truly only pay for the songs you end up singing. The drinks are obviously still pricey as with any bar/lounges are, however, since I'm not into drinker, I was able to just pay for my songs and then leave whenever I wanted.   Overall, it was a great first experience here and I even made some a few fans at the end of the night! :)  PS. If you're going to be doing karaoke late night 9pm+, I highly recommend parking in the J-town garage which charges only $1 late night hours. It's a lot more secure than parking on the street around here!",

I have been to quite a few karaoke joints and this one, I have to say, hands down, makes me feel so comfortable and at home and I keep wanting to go back. I love that it's sort of hidden, off the beaten path. It's kind of small and cozy...not intimidating for non-pro singers if you get my drift. The staff is very attentive, classy and also fun. They sometimes sing themselves! The drinks are really well done. I get a lemon drop ever time...done to perfection. This place is in my neighborhood which I love. I have had many many friends come here and we've all had the best time. Each night is slightly different of course. Weekends are more crowded and get big groups sometimes. Weekdays are nice, a mixture of people just getting off there bartending/waitressing jobs nearby, people staying at the nearby hotel and locals wandering in. EVERYTIME I have been here, what I have been impressed by is the support of the crowd. It can be all types of people, old and young, all ethnicities and we're all cheering each other on whether good or bad. It's a real confidence booster to get on stage and sing your heart out and have adoring fans around. A real nice way to let loose. I did read some of the other reviews on here before I wrote this and I almost wish I didn't because I'm saddened to see how they diss the staff. You have to know this staff deals with people yelling into the mic and getting a bit carried away in intoxication at times. They are trying to accommodate new comers and trying to please everyone. So I don't find it unreasonable that they accommodate as they see appropriate. I am so happy and proud to have this relatively new restaurant in my neighborhood. It is one of the finer new establishments to bring the Fillmore district back to life in a positive sense. I have come here for brunch, dinner dates, a company Christmas party, for the drinks at the bar and for apps and drinks in the lounge area. I love decor: the historical jazz pictures with the light behind them on the walls, the unique decorative hanging lamps, and the dark wood. I really like the way this place sections off to make it more intimate whether for private parties or if it's not that buy and they close off certain sections. Oh, the music is jazzy of course. Romantic, classic, soulful, happy and fun. The staff are cheery, helpful and knowledgeable. Ok, the best for last...the food is AMAZING! I have gotten the pork main (YUM!), the shrimp and grits app (YUM!) and the butternut squash soup (YUM again!). I've gotten a lot more than that but that's what comes to mind..haven't had anything bad or even mediocre there basically.

The space is small, looking pretty airport loungey, but that's part of it's charm. Teeny stage, a few tables huddled around it. You'll most likely get pretty intimate with someone you don't know as it gets standing room only pretty quickly. Another bonus of the small space is that it doesn't take long for your song to come up since it doesn't fit very many.  The staff is super nice, the bartenders chatty and friendly. The biggest issue that I have is that you have to pay to sing! 2 bucks a song. Maybe I haven't been to enough karaoke only places and this is the norm but round Michigan the singin' is free (although I have been known to tip the karaoke master from time to time). So to have to pay was a little bit of a surprise. The staff runs the karaoke too, so it's not like they're paying someone separate. Hmm.

Shady example 2:  A friend of mine opened her own tab with a few drinks, put in a song when she arrived, and waited two hours. Her song never came up. People that came to the place AFTER her got multiple songs in. Upon asking the \"KJ\" if he lost it, he was--apparently--quite rude.  Shady example 3:  There were a number of tables reserved for the evening. That's fine. They sat us in the reserved section and said, \"At 11:30 you'll have to find another table or stand.\" That was no big deal at that point. Come 11:30, we all get up and move to another section of the bar. I was sitting at a table for about 10 minutes, and the owner came up to me, placed a reserved place card, and said, \"This table is reserved, you're going to have to move.\" She then goes to MY FRIENDS (who came later than the first wave of people) that I INVITED (to spend money at her corrupt establishment) and asks ME to move so they could sit down. It's a good thing I knew these people, seeing as they walked into the bar after me, or I would have been so much more disappointed than I already was. It was such a dick move--her judgment of socioeconomic class was very apparent as she asked the casually dressed brown man to move for the \"classier\" dressed white girls.  All in all, don't come to this place unless you're already friends with that owner that has the worst stink face I have ever seen. This place could really be awesome if the owner wasn't corrupt in her business decisions.",

There weren't that many people in when we arrived so we were lucky enough to sing a few songs on stage. They have a pretty large selection of songs to choose from. English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, you name it. Festa is open mic, therefore no private rooms and everyone gets up see you sing haha. Happy hour for free Karaoke starts from 7:30 pm and 9:00 pm.",

The first time we went, we found it to be one of the only authentic karaoke bars in Japantown that did not serve as a brothel on the side and we had a terrific time singing with the owner and buying our $6-$8 drinks. However, we went there tonight with a group of friends and when our final tab came, the bartender took the priveledge of charging us $10 a drink, added on drinks that we paid in cash to our friends' tab, and charged us $2 a song without ever notifying us of the \"karaoke song\" charge in the first place. We will never go there again and would advise likewise.",

Japanese businessmen love songs by Britney Spears and will get up and dance with you making you feel like the young, hot version of Britney - not the freaky, can't keep her children, shave her head Britney. \u00a0  Japanese businessmen do NOT, however, like Barry Manilow. \u00a0They will stare at you stonefaced and make you feel like a fallen star. \u00a0They are probably right.",

My curiosity was piqued, and I forged through the veneer to find myself transported to a bar in Tokyo. My friend was similarly delighted with the kitschy skyline decor and fabulously modern red chairs. We settled in quickly even though there weren't a lot of patrons around, and after a bottle of delightful sake called \"poochi poochi\" we took to the mike stand and never looked back. More of the bar's regulars strolled in later in the evening, and none shied away from belting out some classic oldies as well as more current tunes. I ended up spending a pretty penny there but I don't think I can say it wasn't worth it.",

Drinks are a bit pricey here; you can easily rack up a hefty bill between drinks and songs, which cost $2 each (free before 9 on M-Th, I believe). \u00a0It's always a fun time though, and the patrons here are always nice and supportive of whoever is up on stage singing, so don't be shy!",

Add it to the JTown Crawl. **Update** I'm going with damn obnoxious karaoke. \u00a0We did indeed add this spot to the JTown Crawl on Friday. \u00a0What I have only seen as a dark lounge filled with a couple of businessmen during the week, but have heard as a noisy hotspot on weekends or later in the evening, proved its hotspot chops. \u00a0But not with the crowd I'm used to seeing. \u00a0It seems to me that Silver Cloud got too crowded for some of the more SF savvy karaoksters and they've moved on to more intimate pastures. \u00a0Unfortunately for the rest of us. \u00a0 We perched at a corner table for just a moment before the waitress asked if we'd like to sit in the corner booth (which had a reserved sign on it). \u00a0Boy did we! \u00a0We snuggled in and placed our order and waited to watch some folks sing their hearts out. \u00a0 I only made it through two lychee martinis (which were excellent, even if the lychees themselves were too sweet for me - canned it seems) and a little bowl of \"outlines\" which I ordered based on their name alone. \u00a0It's just snack mix - sesame stix, breadsticks, pretzels and nuts. \u00a0Why they call them outlines I have no idea, must be something lost in translation, but I love that they do. \u00a0It made them that much more delicious. \u00a0 As for enjoying the dulcet sounds of undiscovered American Idols, those dreams were shattered as we winced through our evening. \u00a0Two large groups of drunk and obnoxious white folk took turns singing, reading lyrics in monotone spoken word style, and/or screaming and grunting into the mics. \u00a0 Luckily you need do nothing more than catch a bartenders roving eye and signal for another drink when you're dry. \u00a0If I had to get up and wade through the boisterous crowd and their cupcakey fingers I would've only had the one drink. I think I'm only grousing because I was hoping for the quieter, more singing based karaoke experience I had seen on previous stops, instead of the Marina spillover screamfest/microphone fight we ended up with. \u00a0Oh and because we were the only couple in the entire place that didn't get offered birthday cupcakes. \u00a0What's up with that? \u00a0That's just mean.",

This place is just cozy enough, however, that it really rubs the edges off of my stage fright.   The cocktails are little bit weak, considering the price tag ($9-12).   They really reverb up the mics to sweeten your voice.   One time I sang Just Like Heaven, and ended up singing into both mics at once. I think I even sat down on the stage for a little bit. It must've made a pretty strong impression on my friend Dan, because he brings it up every time this place gets mentioned.   One of these days I'm going to find a song that I can flap my arms and jump up and down to.   Their English-language pop menu somehow skews towards a slightly new-wave/alternative sort of vibe. For instance, you can find Jon Spencer Blues Explosion songs on their menu, but no Space Oddity.   What am I gonna fatally embarrass myself with if there's no Space Oddity?",
