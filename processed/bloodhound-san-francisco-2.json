W T F. another guys straight up dogging me (yes, i said dogging, yes im old. screw you).   fuck it. if i get arrested tonight, so be it. \u00a0i center my attention on the tallest/biggest guy in the group. ALWAYS take on the biggest guy of the group. the rest of his friends wont be expecting that. i stare at the guy, hes about 5' 10\", skinny though.... i stare at him. follow him from the right side of me to the left...... oh shit....   OH SHIT.... OH SHIT!!!!!!!  apparently theres a gay bar next door to the bloodhound.   its friday night.   asian night.  i literally laugh out loud and run back inside.  i may be a moron, but daddys still got it!!!",

As soon as I walked in I felt comfortable - no scene, no pretension (though there is some noticeable antler decor).   I perused their cocktail menu but decided to go with the Greyhound, as I'm not a huge fan of Campari or of Bourbon, and there seemed to be a lot of both of those on their specialty drinks. It may have been one of the best greyhounds that I've ever had, and it was also the place where I learned of the Salted Dog, which is a greyhound with a salted rim. Yum!  The bar itself is super laid back and comfortable, with some big leathery couches that we all sprawled out on as well as some fun rolling office type chairs. The only reason I'm not giving it a full five stars (though my experience was pretty darn close) was that I really felt like I'd seen this concept before and it wasn't necessarily the most unique decor or ambiance. But hey, it works!",

B: WELL, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO (yes, with that army treatment) Me: Maybe, but I didn't want to risk it, that's cool. \u00a0We won't get in. B: OK THEN KEEP WALKING.

That was certainly a pitiful attempt at cowboy lingo, but take a gander at the main pics of Bloodhound and you'll catch my drift. Lean against the wood slat walls and ponder the antler chandelier, tip back a booze filled mason jar or two, catch up with old pals or new. It's a bar I'd almost call \"upscale\" that still has the nonchalance of a saloon.  The crowd can be a touch pretentious, something I've notice about select bars in SOMA. Annoying customers be damned, the bartenders are thorough and will chat you up about their cocktail list to make sure you're comfortable with your drink selection.  Bonus points for the amazing ceiling. Simple yet repeatedly eye catching. Word to the wise, do NOT ogle the birds if you're traveling through 'tipsy' and on to 'drunk'. Don't even glance upward if nearing 'wasted'. I witnessed a girl, most definitely hammered, continuously look up at the ceiling. She was mumbling about the birds, how she loved birds, loved *these* birds, wished she had birds... You know, annoying alcohol induced repetition. She eventually stared at the birds so intently, drunk as shit, that she predictably toppled backwards, right into two people, drinks in hand. Some folks just can't handle the birds it seems.

Our most recent visit had me ordering an Allagash tripel. The only other local place I could find that beer was in the over-priced, over-refrigerated beer aisle in Whole Foods. Of course, you can have your fancy-pants beer while ordering a rum and coke next. Seems like all drinks are welcome here. Also, no cover.

It was very crowded here (for what I'm used to, but I'm sure it wasn't that bad for SF), and it was a little difficult getting to the bar and trying to get the attention of the bartenders --partly because of the crowd and partly because I was a foot shorter than everyone else. However, the bartenders are very attentive, and I eventually got a drink. They have a small but good selection of beers, and mixed drinks. My hubby and I were pleasantly surprised by their recommendations (the bartenders are very knowledgeable about their drinks), and they kept checking up on us as our drinks got low.   They were out of the Old Speckled Hen beer, but the bartender recommended a dark nitro beer instead (I think it was Deschutes Armory XPA). It was very tasty (I like dark beers). Hubby was excited that they had a cocktail with pisco, so he ordered that. It was very strong, yet refreshing. The whisky drinks also looked really good, as the bartenders made them with such care and precision, so hubby got one of those too.  Tip: the crowd thinned out a lot as it got closer to midnight. By 10:30/11-ish, we got seats at the bar, which is why we had such good service.   Despite the tight space and crowd, the decor alone is worth a visit. I would've liked to return for drinks earlier in the day too, so as to avoid the crowd, but alas, so much to do in so little time!",

With that disclaimer in mind, this review may not be the most detailed or coherent in the world, but I can assure you, I fucking love this bar.   Why? Well, here's where it all gets hazy. A few reasons off the top of my head: -Old Speckled Hen served in mason jars... and only $5! -I usually stay at a hotel near this hood where there is a dearth of cool bars. -It's dark. -There's a good amount of seating. -Music is good. -They have just a really cool aesthetic.   Yeah, I'm kind of stretching here. But here's the thing, you can say Ryan Gosling is cool because he's good looking, and he's in a band, and he generally chooses good roles, and he owns 300 hipster v-necks... but you know those aren't the reasons WHY he's cool... he just is.

With it's mix of Bulleit Bourbon, St. Germain, ginger beer and lime, it has everything a girl needs to happily imbibe. For something else along those lines that will put a bit of hair on your chest (or add some pep to your step), go for the New Fashioned. It replaces the traditional sugar cube/simple syrup in an Old Fashioned with maple syrup. Somehow, this simple switch really elevates the flavor from the orange peel. If bourbon just isn't your thing, the Turf Cocktail has enough gin to really get your buzz on. The tiny sip I had of my friend's drink was plenty for me.

A twist on a greyhound with the addition of Campari. Fun and drinkable. I tried the Ricky Ricardo, because I love Lucy, and I was in the mood for tequila. After that and a pint of Old Speckled Hen, I was certainly loopy. The intoxicating vapor of freshly butchered pig smoke didn't help either.  Great decor, quite an upgrade from Cassidy's. The interior looked very, um, Portland, but in a good way. Antler chandelier, \u00a0a flock of birds painted on the ceiling. But The place also has the solid touches of a good bar. A pool table in the back, a shooting game, a nice long bar that was accessible even during a crowded event, good lighting. I love hunting lodges and the whole gentleman's retreat look, so i found Bloodhound very comfortable. I'll be back here regularly.

The big bartender guy is really knowledgeable, but if you catch him at the wrong moment can be a little impatient and snappy. \u00a0Nonetheless, you will get what you order, and it will be well-poured. \u00a0I highly recommend the buttered rum for colder evenings! \u00a0It is truly delicious, and you can say that you've actually tried that noble and classic drink, The Buttered Rum. \u00a0It's kind of like drinking warm and tasty egg nog.  The door is always open here, in a literal sense, so dress warm (or enjoy them buttered rums).  Pool and other game machines toward the back where they belong, and the men's room is really clean.",

There were some vibes of \"trying too hard\" or having a manufactured bohemian vibe, but the drinks were stiff (not good tasting), and the prices were fair.

Not in the most ideal location for return visits, but this area of Soma is almost pub crawl worthy with City Beer, Terroir, and Brainwash across the street.

Aside from the fact that they make great drinks, there's a certain je ne sais quoi about it. It's a chill bar without being divey. It's cool without being too trendy. There's a great mixed crowd so that you can't say it's a hipster bar, or a yuppie bar, or any other \"insert stereotype here\" bar. There's a pool table and a juke box, and dogs are allowed! Great food options nearby including the newly-discovered Chez Spencer food truck. (Yes, I only JUST discovered this almost a year later because I always make a direct beeline to Bloodhound.) And I always find parking nearby.   It's so awesome I have dragged many friends and introduced them to Bloodhound and they, too, love it here. I'm slightly shocked that the bartenders don't know me by name, or at the very least, don't immediately start mixing a Recoil when they see me walk in the door. All in due time...",

Keep in mind this is on a Sunday and we were leaving Monday afternoon to come back to San Diego.. So it was a nice comfy Sunday afternoon where most of the City's actual residents were passed out or playing basketball in costumes (like Catholic School girl costumes on a bunch of boise) in the park  I like this place for a host reasons, super friendly locals with dogs who would wander over to talk to us. Loads of TV's since I am a sports fan...I was practically orgasmic and great beers on tap. It's got a \"hunting vibe and decor\" to it which I am sure comes in quite handy after several grey hounds on a Saturday night. \u00a0Quite a few moody hipsters lounging and working on their laptops.  Our bartender was great and like I said, so were the locals. My husband and I had several pints purchased for us for finishing Bay to Breakers.

There's pretty artwork on the ceiling (painted black birds). Bacon-infused whiskey made an appearance once, and I keep waiting for it to come back.  A mild pain in the ass to get to, I must say.

The number of bars I've Yelped is paltry because: (1) I'm not that much of a drinker, or (2) when I do drink, I make a serious commitment and then can't remember why my Hanes boxers are on top of my head.   As bars go, Bloodhound is relaxing if you can find an empty set of seats. That's a big \"if\" during the weekends because it attracts a lot of the young urban professionals who live in the surrounding lofts. I don't think much of the hipsters come here - which is a blessing - but I'm also not big on selfish, privileged, white-collar morons who hoard seats and then promptly ignore you as they tap pretentiously on their iPhones. Still, there is a hunting lodge vibe that's hard to resist.   Moose antler chandeliers. Georgia O'Keefe-type skeletal animal heads. Faded slat-board walls. Pool table, of course. And a nice long bar that manages to be packed no matter how eagle-eyed you get in trying to find a stool. I've had the Planter's Punch here, which is unsurprisingly a fruity drink, all dark rum and pineapple juice, but somehow it fits the laid-back setting on the stretch of Folsom that's slowly becoming a dipso-ghetto.

I knew that to write an actual Review (I use a capitol R to differentiate between a well thought out, researched, and based upon MY actual experiences review rather than either highly emotional babble or a summary of those who have written before me type review) I would have to experience Bloodhound on a busy weekend night. To be honest and true to my review I even went in... Alone!   I've always been impressed with Bloodhound. It was opened not too too long ago by a couple guys from Double Dutch and Ambassador. The name Bloodhound is originally an alias for the St Hubert (or Sleuthhound) dog. Though it is doubtful that that fact is why they allow K9 pets to roam as free about the floors of the bar as the beautifully painted black doves artistically appear to be doing across and around the ceiling. Bloodhound dogs were bred to to help hunters track deer and were rather homily pups quite honestly.  Bloodhound bar, unlike its namesake, is gorgeous. Repurposed wood panels the wall, paintings of bears and antler chandiliers are included in the decorations. The look is hunting lodge chic. There are high top wooden tables, bar stools, and comfy couches placed strategically near the front of the venue to take pressure off the bar itself.. But my favorite outside the dove colored ceiling is the lighting. The antler chandilier is very hip, but look again. The light bulb chandiliers (over the hightops) are too cool. I want them. And even the track lighting over the bar is both artistic and original.  The $9 coctail list is creative, not a renaming of the same cocktails every other bar serves but Bloohound originals with names like the Ricky Ricardo, the Recoil, Jack Rose, and of course, the Bloodhound- imagine that! Beers will run you @ $5-$7 but they are nice enough to list the alcohol percentage right next to the name.   After purchasing a Daq 1515, I picked a corner to observe from, wanting not only to check out the video game \"Big Buck Hunter\" (an awesome shooting game) but what kinda tunes were on the juke box (it was turned off for the night but it looks like a blend of bar favorites). I looked out over a sea of mason jars (in 2 sizes), martini glasses (specialty cocktails), and wine glasses (primarily containing extra strength beer) and realized how much more I loved Bloodhound after my mandatory Friday night visit. The crowd was more- well for lack of a bettert word- real than i'd seen on a Friday night in a SF watering hole in, well too long. There really was a bit of everyone. Every where you looked were flip flops and jeans. The ladies had on casual make up and down played hair. The men's pants were neither too big, nor too small. And it even looked like someone took a handful of UC Berkley boys and dropped them in for artistic flavor. My favorite foursome were the 21 years old girls -feigning nonchalance in a bar full of late 20's and 30 somethings. It was impossible to tell who was hip, who was professional, and who was on the prowl (except the 21 year olds of course). It was comfortable. And that C word I almost never use. I actually believe if Toby Keith's famous \"I Love This Bar\" had begun playing at 1:30 am Sat morning, that if by the 2nd verse, after the left right looks to see how all the other patrons were reacting were done, this crowd would've known the words and sung them proud.  Well I know one thing for sure... \"I Love this Bar\"!  Ps the male bartender was impressive- to say the least. And the female. I think Genuwine wrote a song about her that had a line \"Is there any more room for me, in those jeans\". She was HOT.. and yes I'm as straight as an arrow.. :-)",

The hipsters can have all the other lousy bars around the area, or suck it up and share a little.   Now that I got that off my chest... Bloodhound is a good spot. I really like the atmosphere. There is something very comforting about a lodge type place with tables made of trees, mason jars for beer mugs, and antlers hanging from the wall. The place is unique for the city, which is why people make their way even from the marina to enjoy it.   I also thought the drinks were decently priced. I paid $13 for a mandarin soda and a bacardi and diet. Average in my book. Service was also quite good. I didn't have to wait long for a drink or to close out my tab, which is always a good thing (there are not many things I hate more than trying to get drunk at a bar and not being able to because you have to wait 20 minutes to order a drink!).

    "review_text": "Bloodhound could easily be missed as you walk down Folsom. Although it has large windows and a substancial sign it doesn't immediately jump out as 'the place to go' - so it was most fortunate that I was invited to the Happy Hour there.  I was a little intimidated at first by the sudden darkness as I went in but as my eyes adjusted to the room I suddenly felt intrigued. This was not the Dive bar I had expected at all.   A beautiful solid bar ran down the right hand side of the room with stools at just the right hight for the various patrons to sit on and then rich dark brown wall seats on the left with what could only be described as rather 'fun' looking low recliners which were on wheels. The ceiling immediately caught my eyes with the shadows of birds circling overhead. Even the artwork had been carefully considered and raised an eyebrow with its diversity and tongue in cheek nature.  What really excited me though was the treasures that lay at the back of the bar. A fine pool table, begging to be played, a juke box with an incredibly diverse range of music and a 'Big Buck Hunter' game as well.  A bar is not made a decent bar by its decor though.  Luckily this one has just used the interiour to compliment 'its offer' - which is a wide range of spirits, some well thought out wines (not a huge selection - but well chosen) and a cocktail list which is best described as leathally excellent.  My favourite cocktail so far is the Ward 8 - which is made with excellent precision and flair by each of the bar tenders I have so far met. While if you are feeling like something without alcohol they can with equal dilligence whip up a fruity little number which will refresh and revitalise immediately.  The staff here are friendly and patient. Quick and skilled.  The space is large enough for a group of people to go drinking together although I would really not recommend having your gathering next to the pool table - unless you like being poked and hit with the pool que. :)  This is the place to go if you want a stress free drink with friends - the only bad thing to say about it? Those cocktails are far too easy to drink, the bar tenders far too good at making them quickly and the end result is you may go home significantly poorer.... ;)",

I'm tight with the owner's of Julie's down the street, but they just wouldn't listen to me and put in a pool table or two...However, they need to PUT UP A CHALKBOARD so those of us who want to play can get down to it.   The jukebox is all over the map, but I'm happy to see The Pixies in there along with the classic rock and hip hop. I think they made it overly diverse on purpose until they feel out their demographic a bit better.  It will be interesting to see how the new place affects the feel of the area.

    "review_text": "I love pretty close to hear, and this is definitely a great addition to the area.  With some pretty solid spots around, such as city beer store, teroir, there needed to be a good bar with a solid punch. Bloodhound is exactly that.  The bar before Bloodhound here was 'Cassidy's'... good bar, but a totally different atmosphere and ambiance... Cassidy was more of a mild hole in the wall.  Bloodhound brings it up a couple of notches, and with it, attracts a crowd that's somewhat a splice marina and soma, but its not limited to that crowd only.. you get the locals in here as well... so its an interesting mix of people. Usually, a descent looking crowd in there... some nights get BUSY here. Esp the weekends, and I believe wed/thu can be busy here. Then again so can Tuesday, um, and Monday.  Plush settings, comfy couch, dim lighting, pool table, shooting game and good music... a bar with a lounge atmosphere and feel. The perfect go to bar in the area.  Also, a few days a week, there are food trucks, pizza ovens outside... I believe the Chariman Bao truck stops there on Wednesdays, and the pizza thing changed recently. Call them and ask. Great bar to grab food right outside, bring it in, chill on the sofa (if you find room) and have a drink with your food.  My beer of choice here is Old Speckled Hen. Delicious! The drink to get here is 'The Recoil'... stellar drink:  The Recoil 1.5 oz good quality bourbon (we use Bulleit or Buffalo Trace, but any good one will do; Makers, Knob Creek, Old Grand Dad, etc.) .5 oz St. Germain Elderflower liqueur .5 oz Fresh Squeezed Lime Juice Ginger Beer - Not ginger ale. Ginger beer is spicier and drier and makes a more balanced cocktail.

I've been to a ton of bars around the city and this one is really unique...it really is for everyone:  It's not divey, it's not too loungey, not a pub, not a club...it really is its own thing. \u00a0Bloodhound has a hunting/outdoors theme, but it's done nicely with earthy tones and accents. \u00a0While you'd expect a place like that to be divey and dirty, it's not - it is rustic, but it's intentional and not overdone. \u00a0It's clean and comfortable; there's also a lot of space and the staff there is friendly and attentive.  Most bars in this part of Folsom are either leather, hipster, divey or a combination of any of those three things, but this place really does stand out on its own.

There's not a hint of an attitude in the place - everyone is very friendly and I love all the wood detail and sofas at the front of venue. \u00a0I especially loved all the doves painted onto the eye-catching ceiling!

I want to be discerning. But after careful bullet-point consideration I can't think of a single thing I don't like about this bar.  Let's start with the most important thing about a bar, the drinks: They are good! They have a specialty drink list that is tasty and seems to be ever changing. I'm a whiskey guy and while their selection isn't the most extensive it has some quality hooch on board.  Prices: It is quite reasonable. I was there with a group of friends and it was something like $30 for 5 drinks. And that included one or two higher priced premium drinks.  Service: The really cool thing about this place is that the bartenders (some are the owners) are REALLY nice! I can't stand when I go to a bar, Ahem Pink Elephant San Diego, and the people who work there are just assholes! These guys and gals are awesome!  Ambiance: The crowd is definitely not the green as the valley 21 year olds that trash a place and puke outside. Classy people in their mid-late 20's all the way to late 30's but honestly diverse, mellow and polite. The taxidermy aesthetic is warm but original and lends itself to the hunters' lodges and workmen's bars of the Ozarks but with a pristine and fresh twist.  Food: They don't serve any but there is usually a food truck out front, pizza is close by and there is a newly anointed bacon-wrapped hotdog stand out front. PLUS!  love this place, it's our neighborhood bar. Love!",

I haven't been here on a weekend, but it's definitely a cool place to hang during the week. \u00a0It's spacious with lots of seating, so it works well if you have a large group. \u00a0Best of all, they serve no pesky food to get in the way of your buzz. \u00a0You can soak up the alcohol later at Extreme Pizza, which is only a block away. \u00a0Alternatively, The Cat Club is in the same block, so you can go dance it off if your timing is right!  I guess the only drawback for me is that their Happy Hour could be a little bit happier ($1 off a $9 cocktail isn't really much of a discount).

Think whiskey cocktails and beer, not chardonnay and vodka sodas, although I'm sure plenty of people order those things too. The bartenders are attentive and polite. Seems like the kind of place you could become a regular if you were so inclined.   The crowd was very mixed while I was there. A few second date types, gussied up before dinner. Some past happy hour businessmen. A couple of queers and hipsters. And even some bar-crawling monied Persians blinged out and celebrating a birthday. Everything and everyone goes.  If this place serves food, I wasn't aware of it. I sat at both the bar and in one of the lounge-y corners. I preferred the bar, where you can chat with the bartenders, meet more savvy drinkers, and avoid larger groups of people in which it seems like a dry hump session might occur at any moment.

After getting an intoxicating whiff of a whiskey-based drink, I had to order one for myself. The New Fashioned may well become my next signature cocktail. Made with honey instead of sugar, it was a cool spin off from an original Old Fashioned (no muddling), with a soothing taste.   The long bar offered ample room for ordering, and lounge-style and table seating made for a chill atmosphere. The lights were appropriately dim, providing gentlemen with the added courage to strike up flirtatious banter.   The juke box was appropriately filled with classics, although the volume was low until the wee hours of the night. I look forward to returning on my next trip to San Francisco!

So you can imagine that when the aforementioned was highly touted as a selling point, as a reason to come and not listed first as a reason to avoid this place, I was a deeply, deeply troubled.  It was a birthday what brought me here. A good friend, only months from marriage in fact and celebrating some god-awfully high numbered trip around the sun. And since birthdays are mandatory I went. And it was okay. Really. \u00a0It was absolutely not a shit show that collapsed upon its own gaudiness and drove you away in despair.  Aside from an unfortunate encounter at the jukebox where my music-snobbishness was unappreciated, (which is really my fault, I mean, I have to learn to let people be, who cares if they like radio R&amp;B and Top 40 rap, I mean really?) everything was extremely not awful. My flight reflex was never triggered. Not once the whole night.  The room is really nice and \u00a0the layout is much better than before. I was there on a Friday night and so yes it was full of people dressed for a club and guys were 'sharking' - but that's to be expected.   Because remember people, the alternative to Bloodhound, is not some Platonic ideal of the perfect bar where the bartenders are cool, and no one is on the verge of puking after too many Jaeger bombs. No, no, no. The alternative to Bloodhound is the Holy Cow.   Yeah. So just shut it, and be thankful for what you've got.",

AMBIANCE: Anyway, that was not a big deal. \u00a0This place had a cool ambiance. \u00a0Although it looks like it would be a manly masculine amurrican place to be with the log cabinesque decorations / antlers / stone ipa on tap, it really was... not anything like that at all. \u00a0In fact, this place reminded me of Urban Outfitters. \u00a0There were black birds painted on the ceiling, antlers for chandelier lights... all very \"urban\". \u00a0Very hip.  Still, if you didn't know any better about retail / interior design, you'd probably be easily fooled into thinking that this place was a real manly place. \u00a0My boyfriend and his friends would have probably thought this place was sooo cooool.  SERVICE: Awesome! \u00a0Very fast... the bartender was actually nice to us, unlike most of the other people at the bar. \u00a0A lot of old guys came and teased us because we seemed out of place. \u00a0Whatever. \u00a0Anyway, even though the place was PACKED, the bartender could pretty easily pick out who hadn't ordered yet. \u00a0They seemed to have a pretty efficient system going on there!

I don't remember, they got us pretty hammered. Great custom drinks if you want, and FRANZISKANER (yay!), and immediate win in my drunk bitch book.",

Has the feel of a very upscale dive bar, but isn't divey at all...hard to explain. There is an antler chandelier on the ceiling and some birds too. They also play some pretty good music, even though I do not remember what they played.  They have a little lounge area in the front. It doesn't get overly packed and the crowd is pretty mixed. We had the first table reserved, so my party took over that whole area, everyone had a great time. I brought light-up ice cubes, and they were a big hit!

But interestingly enough we found two dudes matching in lumberjack flannel shirts playing Big Buck Hunter and a group that we had a hard time deciding whether they came from an 80's party or wore white blazers over neon blue v-necks on their spare time.  2) Big Buck Hunter arcade game + pool table.

One incredibly intoxicated friend disappeared from the bar and wasn't answering his phone. He is from out of town and doesn't know his way around the city. It was pouring rain. Figuring that he may have ducked into Bloodhound, I headed over there.  Now, I'm a pretty polite person. So I asked the bouncer, \"Excuse me. I'm looking for a friend who is lost. Do you mind if I check if he's here?\"  Bouncer: \"No, we're closing.\"   He then proceeded to violently push an intoxicated man out the door (no clue about the man's previous behavior or if the push was justified, but at the time the man hadn't done or said anything)---directly into a girl. Yes, he violently pushed someone into an innocent bystander. The girl was struck in the face and was very upset. The bouncer apologized to the girl, said \"stay out!\" to the guy, then turned to me and physically removed me from the door frame (didn't ask me to leave, just strong armed me out the door.)  Me: \"Sorry, do you mind if I just scan the room? He is very drunk, from out of town. I'm just trying to find him.\"  Bouncer: \"It's not my f****** fault you lost your f****** \u00a0friend. That's your f****** fault. Now get out.\"  ...............  Completely uncalled for. I was sober. I was polite. I wasn't disorderly. It wasn't after closing, but a few minutes before and my request to scan the room would have taken all of about 30 seconds. People were still seated, enjoying drinks. There was no reason for his atrocious behavior. I've since tried calling the bar to speak with a manager four times. Each time the phone rings and rings and never reaches a voicemail or a person on the other line.  Horribly unprofessional and I won't be back.",

Big Game Hunter in one corner, mounted deer/moose head in the back, pool table, and crowds of hipsters all amplify this effect greatly, for better or for worse. The only thing that ends up feeling a little out of place are the nice sectional couches that line the windows towards the front, but they're comfortable enough that I can't really complain, especially given the lack of low, accessible seating otherwise.  The majority of their drinks are served up in mason jars of varying sizes, which is kind of kitschy, but neat nonetheless. And with most priced at under $10, they're right around the same price point as equally enjoyable Rickhouse. Having tried the Recoil (Bulleit bourbon, St Germaine, lime, and ginger beer) and New Fashioned, I can highly recommend both - and the rest of their drinks are probably pretty good bets too.  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - With a very spacious interior, people shouldn't encounter any problems getting in or around the lounge. The bar is, of course, standard bar height, but the end furthest from the entrance is actually standard table height, should you need to garner a bartender's attention.  Bathroom - Semi-private men's bathroom. I say semi-private because it's a single room with two urinals and a toilet, but there's no lock on the door, so... use at your discretion, or have a friend stand watch outside. Otherwise accessible, though those with wider wheelchairs may have trouble getting inside due to the side privacy panel of the urinal closest to the door.",

Guess my biannual medical check-ups will soon become biweekly (or more!) Which means that I may be showing up more frequently at my actual internist's to have my albumin levels monitored.",

Like most bars in the city, it can be a shit show on the weekends but I like to do my drinking early in the evening (or right before last call) on a weeknight anyway so that doesn't really bother me.   Quick recap, as I tend to drift as I write these things:   - Cool space: hey, is that a pool table? - Great drinks: try the Ward 8 or Old Speckled Hen if you prefer beer - Functional, informative website: need to know how to make a Ricky Riccardo or want to hear some Band of Horses?

The space is uniquely decorated, people here are diverse, and being a big fan of whiskey and Scotch, offers a huge variety. \u00a0Also ask for Christina to help you with drinks. \u00a0She is an amazing bartender that not only makes a great cocktail, but has dropped some serious knowledge on bourbons. \u00a0If you are unsure what you want, she helps you decide based on your preferences and is never impatient about it. \u00a0Lastly, she introduced to me/makes a great mezcal shooter that is amazing! \u00a0 Definitely worth a try if you are already a fan of peaty scotch!",

Most of these bartenders know what they're doing and will happily make you an exquisite libation upon request, or recommend a unique beer on tap. given an undemanding crowd- duh.  And their ipod and/or jukebox selection rocks. Whichever one they've got playing, I'm always loving what I'm hearing when I'm here. ..aand on some [Thurs-Sat] nights, there might even be a cartfull of bacon-wrapped hotdogs right outside. You can't ask for much more sensory goodness from a down-to-earth SOMA bar..",

I think it was a good size crowd.  The atmosphere is a mix of different things, but mostly what I would call rustic. There is an animal skull on the wall and barrels around the area to use as tables. They have a single pool table within the back of the bar, which gains a lot of popularity and use all throughout the night.  All of their bartenders were very nice and friendly except for one. I had been drinking for a few hours at this point and went up to the bar to get a water. When I got back to my friends we all ended up sharing it. I went back up about 5 minutes later, same bartender, and asked for another water. His response was, \"I thought I already gave you one.\" I explained that I gave it to my friends and he followed up with a very rude, \"Next time how about you ask for two, so we don't have to go through this.\"  Overall, the Bloodhound was a very positive experience and I enjoyed my evening there. I would recommend it to friends.",

The crowd felt a little marina-style, but since this was a meeting place for our group, we made it our own.

Our beast of a bartender was so sweet, we wanted to try the citron flavored Patron but not as a pure shot and asked if he knew any cocktails that utilized it; he did not but quickly whipped us up some Tequila Sunrise-esque drinks.

When I found out one of the old school Yelpers was leaving the area, I made it to Bloodhound for the rendezvous. On a Sat night this place is packed to the gills. I had to wait outside for a few minutes, though the door man was cool. Going inside, the rustic bar with a number of hard working bartenders were scurrying around while, tons of young drinkers clamored to get around.   Running into various Yelpers I'd not seen in years, it was like an event back in the old days. I sidled up to the bar and deciding that I didn't want to get back into the crush of things again, I double fisted with a Recoil and Ward 8. Both Bourbon based drinks, they hit the spot as I made my way back to the group.   I can't count the number of times I was bumped into, elbowed, pushed what not. It's like college had just let out or something. I figure this place makes a much better weeknight bar than weekend but the people watching was interesting.

Free wifi was a plus and our beers were only $3 each! we had Pacifico since they didnt have Corona, which isnt too bad.

(1) They had a $20 credit card minimum, which is a violation of Visa and MasterCard merchant agreements. Merchants' Visa and MasterCard agreements DO NOT PERMIT merchants to charge a minimum for credit card use.   (2) They have installed a partition in the men's bathroom that hides the urinal from view when the door opens but makes the bathroom inaccessible to wheelchairs. I brought this to the co-owner's attention, but I have not been back to see whether they've done anything to fix the problem.   Someone at Yelp needs to change \"wheelchair accessible\" from yes to no.   Boo on Bloodhound.",

This is the perfect place for sensitive bearded men in flannel shirts &amp; nouveau chunky black-rimmed glasses to play an ironic game of Big Buck Hunter underneath an antler chandelier. In a way, it's almost fitting for Bloodhound to have landed here, in the footprint of the much beloved punk &amp; metal dive that preceded it. The frontier-like atmosphere of the place is fitting for this particular as-of-yet-unvogued corner of SOMA.  Sure, people may still be pooping in the alley next to the bar every night, but today's human poop is tomorrow's fertilizer (see: Hayes Valley, The Mission). A few years from now, the whole neighborhood will likely be full of high end cocktail bars.  With a name like Bloodhound, I'd expected a grapefruit juice &amp; vodka frou frou-type experience, but the vibe was is great. I have a hunch it'll be around for awhile.",

Amazing whiskey selection (and liquor selection in general). Great atmosphere - a relaxed, cabin-y feel, nice open layout, and Buck Hunter to boot. Bartenders were great and the crowd was a good mix of hipsters, locals, and after-work types. Kind of a solid, clean dive bar feel - the kind of place you feel really comfortable in, but aren't afraid to use the bathroom.  The cocktail menu was truly impressive, and I say that as an ex-bartender. I'm usually an old-fashioned girl and definitely enjoyed their \"New Fashioned\" with maple simple syrup, but the bourbon cocktail with ginger beer and elderflower liqueur was one of the best drinks I've ever had, hands down.  They had a DJ spinning vinyl (on a Tuesday night!), which was awesome, but it still kept a very chill vibe. I'll be back, many many times, I'm sure.",

I gave the bartender my order (4 diff drinks) and despite having to finish up someone else's fairly complicated drink order she kept everything straight and got all our drinks done right - thought that was nice. There's a long list of prohibition-era/style drinks - pretty much any kind of alcoholic concoction. I kept it simple with a 209 &amp; tonic and the proportions were right.  Was pretty crowded when I was here so had to keep an eagle eye on the chairs we were using lest some hoser came over and stole one if someone got up to get another round/use the facilities.  Only downside from my perspective, and maybe all of San Francisco is like this, but if I was a lady I might have been a little creeped out by the stalker-ish vibe of all the dudes hovering around just waiting for their \"moment\".

On the ceilings, airbrushed sparrows (put a bird on it) decorated the walls above and then at the bar, the very wooden bar, all sorts of lumberjack looking bartenders appeased my whiskey order.   If you're looking for that bar where you can metaphorically admire the star-studded sky and think about buffalo running wild, Bloodhound makes you feel like you've drunkenly arrived.

I come here more and more often because it offers decent wines at a very decent price for me (hallelujah!) with a full bar for friends who prefer cocktails. \u00a0The interior is usually roomy (except when the post-work crew descends) and the bartenders are low key. \u00a0So despite the tiny internal crisis every time I come here, it's well worth the visit. \u00a0Even if I have to speak sternly to the inner dork...",

I came in on a Thursday night with co-workers, and the place was 75% full, and also almost as hot as sauna inside. Although I was impressed by the variety of whiskies/scotches/bourbons/alcohol in general they had on the shelves, I was yawning status from how bored I was just standing there in a group people watching. There was nothing of interest going on, unless you want to play video games on their TV or try to play pool on the table that people use to rest against. You could barely hear the music playing in the background, and there is no dance floor here. So, if you enjoy just standing all night and chit chatting with your friends and/or strangers, this is the bar for you. If you're looking to dance or do something aside from standing around and drinking, then head elsewhere.

This is San Francisco drinking at its core. There are dive bars, and eclectic places like Kozy Kar but like it or not this is what SF is becoming. Trendy and ironic and tech people with a ton of excess money to spend.   We came for a pop up dinner event so it was extra crowded but even after the even closed up the place got more crowded. There were a lot of people with backpacks loaded with clothes and computers coming from work in the area. A lot of work meetups and happy hours as well as some first dates and social gatherings. It was super busy but kind of comforting to be around a ton of 25-40 year olds who had their own things going on and were actually really nice.   The bar is super clean and the aesthetic is undefinable which I have kind of gotten used to in SF. Its like local edition but not underground which is a great thing actually. The lighting is really hazy here but its great to be able to step outside if you want to. The bartenders were relatively nice despite being incredibly busy. They also have a great selection of cocktails. Really that's what it comes down to with bars like this. There are a ton of them in SF so what do they have to keep you coming back?   Location, the crowd, and the drinks are usually what get you. Bloodhound has all of this and its evident by how many people are there at all times that they are doing something right. Ultimately if you are cool with drinking around a ton of loud and enthusiastic working adults and sipping on obscure drinks in mason jars then you are going to love this place.   If any of that sounds awful then you should find another place. In a world of tattoos, mustaches, ginger infused drinks and odd things hanging from the walls this place is going to satisfy but its also going to feel just like every one of the 50 other bars that do it as well.",

I mean that in a good way.  The first time I came here, it started out with a very light crowd, then about 30-60 minutes later you could barely walk through the place, and then 60-120 minutes later, everyone left. Don't quote me on those times. But yeah, the number of people is very much in flux here. During that crowded phase, a smoker friend and another friend went outside, you know, to have a smoke. Then they couldn't get back in because they were told it was too crowded. They had to argue with the bouncer that they were 'just' inside and all their friends were in there. This was hilarious at the time.   Not only will I be back, I already have been back. As a matter of fact, I wanted to stop in tonight before the Psychedelic Furs show over at Slim's, but didn't get my ass moving fast enough.",

There are a few couches to lounge, and there are high wood tables to sit at. And of course, there's the bar where the liquor and beer stand in front of some beautiful wood panels. Sparrow stencils are all over the ceiling, and an antler horned \"chandelier\" hovers over the pool table. Best part of all, they have Big Buck Hunter, too so you can get your virtual hunting game on. Hunter's paradise, see what I mean?  There's a pretty sweet selection of beers on tap. Berkeley's Trumer Pilsner was $3 all night thanks to my roommate's mixer with co-workers. Beers are served in mason jars--guh, this place is definitely making me happy, and the bartenders are very nice.  Maybe it's because we were there on a Monday night, but this place is very clean. No strange smells or fears of piss on the bathroom floor. Even the bathrooms fit in very well with the whole hunter theme.  Bloodhound is a charmer.",

I was skeptical at first, but happy I gave it a shot because the cocktails are excellent!  Many of their libations are whiskey-based, but there also tend to be several tasty non-whiskey options as well. Try the Jack Rose or the Ward 8! If you're not a cocktail person (gasp), they also tend to have pretty decent beer on tap as well, and a pretty good selection of higher-end whiskey (&amp; some other stuff) for sipping on.  Cocktails run the SF standard $9-10 each. I do like that there is some non-bar seating (a few vinyl couches &amp; tables scattered around the far side of the bar), and I've always had great service. My only beef is the noise level -- the place can get REALLY loud if it's at all crowded, to the point where you sometimes have to yell so that the person ten inches away can hear you. Try it on an off night or go early if you can.",

A little dark (who doesn't like to drink in a dark place??), and area is set up so that people crowd away from the bar. Nice. It might be good to remove a couple of chairs so people are forced to go away after getting drinks, or people won't lean over groups to get a drink, but who am I to judge.   Staff were friendly, and quick about getting drinks. The drinks themselves are a bit pricey ($10+ for like, 5 oz of liquid) but well made in general.   Upon leaving, we walk by a guy super drunk and his 2 friends taking care of him. Says the friend, \"don't worry, he's ok.\" \u00a0Says me, \"I couldn't really care less.\"",

There are antlers, crows, unfinished wood, etc. but the crowd is your typical SF tech/grunge look and there seemed to be a lot more men than women there (no complaints from me and my girlfriends --\u00a0we're all spoken for, but that's beside the point).   Despite the crowded space, it was easy to get served and the drinks we ordered all packed a punch in terms of flavor and strength. I'm terrible at remembering what my drinks are called, but the one I had here was apple-y and full of spice.   As far as people watching went, we had some good entertainment. A couple making out in a corner for longer than any high schooler I've ever seen, some bizarre pool table interactions, and then a girl who was fondling my hair while her boyfriend struggled to gather their coats from the coat hooks.

It can get packed but it's a wonderful spot to savor your drink when you come during off hours like Saturday afternoon. Off hours also makes for pretty interesting people watching here.

I used to come here every now and then for a beer when I first moved to the city on Monday's or Tuesday's when I got off work since a couple friends of mine who live in the East Bay have those days off and apparently know the owner (the fact that they would actually drive into the city close to rush hour just to come here says a lot about this place in itself).   I really like the atmosphere. It's divey, but not too divey, but it's not one of those bars that's nothing remotely like a dive, but thinks it would be \"cool\" if it's dive so it tries too hard (does that make any sense?). It's just an overall laid-back atmosphere. The decor is pretty cool (the ducks on the ceiling are a plus) and I really like the whole \"rustic\" feel.\"   They have a great beer selection and I love the fact they serve them in mason jars! For no good reason really I've never tried any of the specialty drinks here even though they all sound delicious (I'm also a big fan of Hanger vodka, which they have).   Another big plus about this place is that despite what you would think might be a tough area for parking, it's actually pretty easy (I've only been here on weekdays when I got off at work and since I don't live or work in the area that's a big plus to meeting up here).   I think if I actually lived closer to Bloodhound (or even came to SOMA more often than I do) this would be a regular stop of mine, and would inch up closer to five star territory.

Nice beer selection and the ginger cocktail is delightful.   Antlers all around and Big Buck Hunter are the perfect amount of kitsch. Bartenders are really friendly and the clientele is pretty polite. You likely won't have your toes stomped on, your ears assaulted by drunks, or your night ruined by overcrowding rowdiness.  Bottom line: Great location and just a great little bar. I'll definitely be back.",

    "review_text": "I've been here several times now and I see a trend emerging, which leads me to drop a star back. For two reasons. \u00a0  One - Your cocktail experience will hinge entirely on which bartender makes your drink. \u00a0If you get the skinny shaved head guy, order a beer instead. \u00a0He is way too busy chatting up the women at the bar, and way too focused on checking his phone and texting to see what he's putting into the shaker and into your glass. \u00a0If you get the portly red headed gentleman - where are you?? - order down the list, one of each, and have a ball.   Two - The other current feature of this place that warrants a dropped star is, unfortunately, the people. \u00a0Rotating mix of marina white chicks - \"ooh oooh, let's go check out the guys in SOMA! ... \u00a0Yeah, let's totally do it, rawr!!\", skin-tight flannel plaid shirt bicycle people talking loud to ensure they get noticed, hyper professional skinny cougar types with way too much lipstick, and some after work crowd taking group photos they'll probably immediately post on their \"about us\" page on their website. \u00a0So what is my problem with these people? \u00a0It's certainly not their dress or make-up. \u00a0 \u00a0My look no doubt will offend some hyperbolic critic too. \u00a0I get it. \u00a0So what's my beef?? \u00a0In short, the vanity. \u00a0It's that the people here each seem to be here for a distinct and instrumental purpose. \u00a0No one in the room seems to be enjoying someone else's company or just themselves being there. \u00a0Instead, it's like they're there strictly *for something* - to find a loud talking skin-tight flannel shirt bicycle boy to take home, or to show their co-workers how \"chill\" they can be, or just to sit and enjoy their spectacular selves no matter who they're talking to. \u00a0If you're thinking... \"hello, this is almost every bar in this city\" I'd say you are mostly right. \u00a0but i think it's still useful to know which ones tend to be this way and which ones don't. \u00a0And my previous review failed to mention this about this place.",

But as I said, it all works out.  Not a huge selection of beers, but they have a good selection of spirits and good bartenders. I would also like to note that they have bartenders willing to serve you so you won't feel like you're invisible when it gets a bit busy.  I had a Hendrick's g&amp;t, and I was pleased to see they use Fever Tree tonic by default. I then tried the \"new fashioned\" which was a nice drink as well.

The drinks are well made, and the fact that their namesake drink, the bloodhound #1 contains a healthy dose of campari warms the cockles of my heart, which I think is a good thing. \u00a0If you like beer, definitely try the old speckled hen, which is a tasty, tasty beer. \u00a0  One night, the friendly bartender explained to me the whole socio-political makeup of Irish Whiskeys: apparently Jamesons is the catholic one, and Bushmills is the protestant one. \u00a0Then, he promptly poured us the whiskey that was non-affiliated.. I can't remember what it was, so it must have been good. \u00a0See? I learned something.  I'm not sure what the other reviews are thinking since sizewise, the bar is plenty big for San Francisco.. and as for it smelling, um.. I guess they were never here before, nor do they smell any of the other bars in this city (especially the one in the mission that rhymes with assanova.. great bar, but man, that place smells awful.) \u00a0  Oh, and +1 star for being open EVERY NIGHT of the week. \u00a0Too many places in this hood seem to think that (a) people aren't here past 6pm (ahem, new pho place on 9th) or (b) people don't go out on mondays or tuesdays (I'm looking at you, Rocco's).. \u00a0So, I'm super happy that bloodhound is open every night, like a proper place in a city should be.

This place holds a special place in my heart given the fact that it encompasses many winning factors for the Bay Area patrons.  1. 4pm Happy Hour - a dollar off regular prices. We arrived yesterday promptly at 3:43pm after our SF Food Bank volunteer event via @Boobs4Food. We were thirsty. Very thirsty. Since the doors weren't open, we went to the liquor store on the next block and downed a couple beers to quench our thirst. Point being, they open at 4pm. If you arrive earlier, you know where to go.   2. Quality environment that makes you want to stay all afternoon - I love the decor, the painted birds on the ceiling, all the Hunting theme mumbojumbo. The excellent longbar with tons of comfy barstools.  3. The Bartenders - they know their stuff and they make great drinks. Whether you want beer or liquor - they pretty much have it all. I tried the \"Dusty Road\" yesterday as Anthony cranked out a few for our party. Bulliet Bourbon + Bundaberg Ginger Beer + wedge of lemon. Delish. I'll be getting that all the time now if I'm not getting 1 of their many beers on tap. Love the La Chouffe!!  4. $3 Chicharrones Bar Snacks - the perfect compliment to a jar-ful of beer or a strong cocktail is a bag of these swine-a-licious rinds courtesy of Ryan Farr's 4505 Meats. Tasty, crispy, dusted with a spicy goodness and clearly indulgent. Grab a bag on your next visit.   5. Closely located off the freeway - whether you live in town or BNT - it's a quick getaway to soothe your weekday stress with strong libations, kind service and good company.   Bloodhound is definitely where it is at.",

It's a smaller locale, and I was worried about the twenty or so friends I had showing up later in the evening, but all turned out well.   Everyone was being abnormally nice to me, and then I remembered it was my birthday and I was wearing a ridiculous birthday girl crown.

Making a decision at this place was hard. Also, they ran out of the moose drool, which I only wanted because of the name. I can definitely smell the whiskey from my boyfriend's drink, which is like a manhattan he said. Our group of 12 were comfortable getting drinks from the bar with no wait and sitting on the sofa. I like places that aren't super crowded you can't find a seat.",

You can chill here with your friends or you can put your game face on and get in on the action. Either way, you're going to have a good time.

Some people may drop the rip that you don't have an infinite selection of beer here, but seriously...sometimes its nice to not have to choose from a laundry list of weird european names.   Liquor and cocktail selection is similar to the beer selection. You aren't going to get crazy Bourbon and Branch or Alembic style cocktails here, but they will be classic and made well.

There is also a interesting food scene here. On Thursdays, a few guys set up shop out front with a kiln and cook overpriced mini pizzas.

You go to a bar where you feel comfortable, but the only drink the bartender knows how to serve well is a pint of beer. Or you go to a place that has got quality bartenders, but then you're hemorrhaging cash and dealing with a pretentious clientele.  Bloodhound gives you the best of both worlds. Dylan, the bartender and co-owner, mixes up some great drinks, but they don't cost you an arm and a leg, and no one expects you to be dressed to the nines to get past the door. The hunting lodge aesthetic seems to say, \"If you're just a fella tryin' to do a thing, then yeah, come on in, brochacho.\" It's a dive bar that's not at all a dive bar.  One thing to be aware of: when I was here last Saturday, I saw multiple waves of different sorts of people come in over the course of the evening. The character of the clientele here has not yet been irrevocably defined, and I'm hopeful that the patrons on the whole remain unpretentious and laid back as time goes on. So if you're not a douchebag, please come on by -- let's not lose yet another cool, relaxed place to the d-bag element.",

The highlight of my experience here was this. When I was getting ready to hop to the next bar, this Asian guy outside named Petey said something along the lines of, \"you guys can't leave, we're going to take a shot right now.\" We all walked back into the bar, he threw down his jacket, and began to barback to earn 6 shots of tequila. Apparently he works with the bartender at another bar and he was helping him run the show for a little bit to get the shots for free. We found a table while he was doing his thing and 10 minutes later Petey brought us 6 shots on the house--made possible by his hard work of picking up glasses and stocking shelves. We hung around for another 30 minutes talking about the rigors of life and New Years Eve. This was a moment where a nice person did a nice thing. This man deserves a good break in life.  At any rate, this is probably now one of my favorite dive bars to hang around in SOMA. That night, we ate at The Chieftain Irish Pub, went to the Tempest Bar (another awesome dive bar), then spent most of the night at Bloodhound. This was a fun battle plan that night. I thought about the Bloodhound Gang (band) when my friend was initially telling me about this place.",

However, I did manage a cocktail and a ringside seat at Big Buck Hunter. I simply said \"I'll have what they're having,\" when I ordered, but I think it was a New Manhattan.

Furthermore, the first time I was here there was a super nice bartender and friendly people at the next table.   However, this review is reflective of a crappy experience I had here Monday night with a bartender I will refer to herein as \"Little John\" because of his resemblance to said Robin Hood character. I came in there with a middle aged woman, a family friend of my parents' from out of town for an after dinner cocktail. We were slightly indecisive at first which annoyed Little John but we finally ordered our simple glasses of booze and he quickly made them and plopped them in front of us and then with a look of pure contempt asked us if we wanted to start a tab, to which we replied in the affirmative. Now I'm not sure what exactly this man didn't like about us but he was clearly unwelcoming. When he poured some fancy brownish cocktail for the guy next to me I (out of my love of weird herbs and bitters in drinks) curiously asked what it was three times; the first two times he pretended not to hear me and ignored me and the third time he glared at me and said snobbily, \"a Fernet cocktail\". Of course I nodded to this and thought, \"whatever the fuck THAT is... thanks for the explanation you condescending bastard\".  We slowly and slightly uncomfortably sipped our drinks and when we were done and walking out we heard a very insincere, \"Have a good night, ladies!\" come from behind the bar.  Dear Little John- I'm very sorry that a) my guest and I didn't meet your culturally fascist expectations of customers for asking about an interesting looking drink and b) I brought someone who could very well be a suburban mom-type into your awesomely hip bar.  Get over yourself! I hate to say it but I'm assuming the reason I had a pleasant experience here the first time is because my drinking partner that night happened to be in her late twenties and covered in tattoos.",

I have been asking around for years and still have yet to determine what made hip people decide that a hunting lodge theme complete with taxidermy animals, hunting cammo and antlers is... well... hip. Is it the city-dweller's only connection with the natural world? Maybe. Were these kids all raised by hicks that hunt for fun? No. But I see it everywhere in Portland. If anyone can answer this one for me, please end my years-long confusion.  3. Laid back vibe. This is something that just doesn't seem to exist in many SF bars. Why? Because SF is not a laid back city. \u00a0Sorry, it's just not.   4. Good beer on tap. Not the best tap selection in the world, mind you, but good enough.  5. Buck Hunter. No, I'm not going to claim that Buck Hunter is a Portland thing... it's a hipster thing. But Portland is disproportionately full of hipsters, so many of which are vegetarian. I cannot for the life of me understand why this game is so popular. I've tried playing it a couple of times and... well... I am just not in to killing animals for sport. Also see #2 above.   6. Beards and... wait, did I already mention this one?   Seriously, I walked in here to meet with some folks, and I was the first to arrive.

Good selection of beers on tap, including Old Speckled Hen and Scrimsaw, and served in jelly jars.   There's a very nice and big pool table in the back with plenty of room to play.  Minus a star for their internet jukebox, because then you're always just one douchebag's dollar's worth of Dave Matthews Band away from running out the front door.",

It's hard to get a read on the crowd just yet (really really young kids, hostel crowds, Marina spillover and Double Dutch regulars all mixed together when I was there), but it seems like a good group. \u00a0They have lots of beers too, not just your run of the mill PBR and Anchor Steam, but their official cocktail menu left a little something to be desired according to my palate. I spent way too long trying to decide if the birds on the ceiling were stenciled or wallpapered before I noticed they were the exact same layout on every panel. \u00a0Like anyone else in the world would care.",

Happens a 3rd time and you have your final drink there. You use to be soo good bloodhound. Then you got cocky and started acting as toranado and serving drinks like a dive. \u00a0 So long.",

    "review_text": "Bloodhound is a cool bar with a nice vibe. I was there last Saturday night with a few of my buddies and it was filled with a pretty mixed crowd. You get everyone from hipsters to wannabe Hollywood types, hippies, nerds, geeks, preppies, etc. I love going to place with a diverse crowd because I enjoy people watching and, well, I just love people! I'm kind of chatter box around strangers. Yeah, I'm that guy who walks up to everyone and strikes up a conversation.   The decor is pretty cool. It has, what I call, a hipster gothy cabin look to it. Really dim with hanging antler chandeliers, a long bar that looks like it's made out of old barn wood, a ton of communal tables and a pool table in the back. The bartenders are cool and they pour their drinks pretty heavy, which is something I appreciate - anything to get me closer to blacking out.   Overall, I'm a fan of Bloodhound. It's mellow but has an upbeat vibe at the same time. It's a great place to grab a drink with a big group of friends.",

We stepped in here after Pride because we were tired of drinking with people and The Castro didn't seem a good place to wind down. After partying with the gays and their friends en masse, I didn't know if I could keep up with them up on their stomping grounds.  But this was a pleasant surprise. Nice raw woods made up the fixtures of the place, chic interior, lots of character. Lots of window space take advantage of the SOMA neighborhood and the place was nice to duck away.  There was a fun shooting game in the back. I think the sight of me holding a gun was slightly pathetic.  Oh, Jolene.  But down to the drink. Off the cute bartender's suggestion, I did the Peach Blossom from the menu. Watching him mix it was almost like having breakfast. I got slightly turned on watching a cute man pouring honey.  It was perfect. Crisp, slightly sweet, and a good tang. And straight up in a martini glass.  I am not kin to SOMA, but if I was in the hood again - this would be a definite stop.",

They don't serve food here, but they are completely fine with you bringing your own food in. The first time I came here someone totally saved the day with loaded cheese fries. Was that you Seong? Or maybe Luis? On my recent visit here there was a guy making gourmet pizzas outside with just a little grill and a pizza stone. Pretty awesome. There was also a Chez Spencer food truck parking in the parking lot of the oil change place on the corner.",
