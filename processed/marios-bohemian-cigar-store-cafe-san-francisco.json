The Hot Foccacia Sandwiches are amazing and served really piping hot. From what I could gather they cook them right behind the bar on what seems to be a small pannini press. The ingredients were fresh and the group consensus was to come back.   Seating: The table at the front window overlooks the streets and Jackson Park which is fun to watch. Grab it if it is free. There are also tables outside so if it is a nice day opt to sit there and watch the tourists wonder by.",

Nestled in north beach, this Italian spot does a pretty good ceasar salad and we had something else resembling enchiladas stuffed with different fillings. Those were pretty good but I think next time I'm going for something a bit more my speed- sandwich or pasta or something (if they have those). Split a bottle of wine, which was great, and chatted with people at the next table after they overheard our conversation regarding my roommates slut of an ex-girlfriend.

Sipping a coffee or glass of wine in the corner or outside at a table on a warm afternoon (today was unusually warm) is a great way to spend time. But I bellied up to the bar for one of the panini's and walked away (far too many minutes later) having eaten half of what must be described as the least flavorful sandwich I've ever spent good money on in this town.   The big, sloppy, hot foccacia sandwiches ordered by others looked more appealing and I understand this might be about my choices, but come on! My \"panini\" came on a grocery store roll that was filled with mediocre lunch meat, almost no blue cheese (it was a smoked turkey/blue cheese sandwich) and a few red onions. The only \u00a0distinguishable flavor was the burnt bottom. I'm OK with dark grilling ... a little scorch can make the sandwich. But it was the ONLY flavor stand-out.  Service was friendly enough and they treated the regulars very well. My server saw the disappointment on my face and charged me for what I ate - half a sandwich. I'm not afraid of eating a lot at lunch and I was looking forward to a full belly, but I won't finish something I'm not enjoying.   With all this neighborhood has to offer, why would anyone spend a dime on a sandwich that doesn't meet even the most modest expectations of flavor?  One star for a perceptive server.",

    "review_text": "I have been sitting on this review for awhile, agonizing if I was going to give it 4 or 5 stars. And then it hit me: The focaccia sandwiche(s) that I have had here has become the end-all be-all sandwich to which I compare all other sandwiches.   In the last couple of weeks, every time I eat a sandwich (which seems to be fairly frequently at the moment), I catch myself saying, \"It's good, but it's not as good as Mario's.\" It has set the upper limit of my sandwich scale. If that's not reason enough to give this place 5 stars, I don't know what is.   Not surprisingly, I think the secret is the bread itself - perfectly crunchy but still soft. If you want something that can only be ironically described as \"health,\" I suggest the salami/ham sandwich.   To. Die. For.   The service is a little...strange. They are nice and try to be funny, but come off as just a little awkward. It's really hard for me to put my finger on it, as they are attentive and not rude, but just...different.   Bottom line, even if the service was the most horrendous thing in the history of the world, the sandwiches would make up for it x20. Definitely a must when in Northbeach.",

The sandwiches and pizza are just the right amount for the right price and the staff have always been great.  This last time I stopped in I came and sat at the bar as a lone diner with a book. I ordered my food and the bartender noticed that my nose kept running. I thought it was due to allergies. He brought me a port with hot water in it because he said, \"This is what I have when my nose is running.\" Sure enough, it cleared up my nose for the entire day. I'm sure if I didn't bury myself in my book there would've been much more chatting going on. I'll have to thank him for the runny nose cure and catch his name next time I stop in. I didn't feel rushed but since it was starting to get busy I figured I should get going since I had finished eating.  I know this place is small so I never bring more than 3 other people with me max. I like that it has a cozy feel to it that a lot of places these days seem to lack.  You won't find cigars here but you'll find a lot of regulars who just want to have a drink or a quick no frills meal.

The cakes sitting at the counter were hard to resist but i somehow did.  Having said that... I'm taking a star off because the staff can be a bit moody (not rude..just kinda cranky) and slow at times.

Let me begin by explaining that my tiff is with the waitstaff. \u00a0They have a server who is worthless and a bartender who works at a pace that rivals the speed at which grass grows.  We walked in the door on a nice Saturday afternoon and it wasn't really all that busy. \u00a0We went to the bar where we were ignored for about 5 minutes. \u00a0This server was waiting on one of the tables inside, we make eye contact, and then a table opened up outside which we promptly nabbed. \u00a0After being ignored for another 10 minutes the same server comes outside and walks past us. \u00a0I quickly asked him if he could grab us some menus as we still hadn't been served, and this guy has the nerve to suggest that I \"go inside and get them at the bar\" because the Sultan himself is \"on a break.\" \u00a0Yea that guy is a complete turd burglar. \u00a0  Anyhow, I walk inside and up to the bar, I ask the bartender for the menu and she says she'll be right with me. \u00a0Another 5 minutes go by - NO EXAGGERATION. \u00a0This chic was actually moving about as fast as a glacier - and she served several other people who came after me... and all I asked for was a menu. \u00a0What the hell is wrong with these people?",

Similar to Cafe Francisco a few blocks up, Mario's is good for a quality lunch. Also like Cafe Francisco, it's a wee bit expensive (in the $10 range), but they do have table service. I came with a co-worker, and we both had paninis, mine with chicken and avocado and the right amount of cheese. The sandwiches are on the small side, but I usually try to avoid food-coma-inducing lunches anyway.  Cozy interior, cute decor, be-Diesel-ed staff (maybe they're all actually Italian?), and a view of Washington Square Park to go with the meal ain't so bad at all.

Big bar, little tables inside, a few more outside. Lots of Italian-style atmosphere - bottles of Chianti against the wall, a picture of a boccie ball player, those old artful advertising posters you see at Z Gallerie. Yet again sparked by a complete stranger's adoration of this place on \"Check Please! Bay Area\", Jamie W. and I went to see what the fuss was about. The menu is small but focused - focaccia sandwiches, paninis, three salads, a few pizzas, some lasagna, some eggplant parmigiana, and a few desserts. That's it.  We went for splitting two paninis, both in the $7.50-$8.50 range (see my photos). The verdict is that the salami was really good, and the chicken one a little too dry. But the bread was nice and crunchy. It comes with no extras except for a couple of pepperoncinis - which was a bit disappointing since I never turn down fries. We decided to order the $6 Caprese, which consisted of four thick, somewhat unripened tomato slices with a slab of mozzarella and a dollop of fresh basil pesto (see my photo). All in all, it's a good snack place but nothing much more than that except for a great spot overlooking Washington Square.  FOOD - 3 stars...good, toasty paninis but nothing extraordinary here AMBIANCE - 4 stars...feels like a good paisan's hangout SERVICE - 3.5 stars...friendly enough, not as indifferent as I was expecting TOTAL - 3 stars...the small servings bring this one down a little...also the easy-to-screw-up name with three nouns in a row...make up your mind!",

I wish I'd gotten the full now ( even though I don't need it! ) because the tastes are extraordinary.   I'm a bit of a food snob vegetarian and a little sick of people lack of creativity when it comes to veggie dishes. They're usually eggplant or portobello mushroom based... And I usually boycott them as a result of their blandness and ubiquitousness. I am so glad that I didn't here! I would highly recommend this sandwich to anyone... Veggie and meat eaters alike.   Also there a nice view of the park and the church is just eclipsed behind a willow tree.   The ambiance is low key and the price are very reasonable. The bartenders are pleasant but a bit distant.  I will be returning, hungrier, and for the full sandwich!!! The beer's not bad either!",

Truth be told, it's one of the worst ways I've \u00a0been treated as a human being, hands down.  Our dinner was fine. Service was abrupt, but not so much that we would make a fuss. When the bill comes, I show him the coupon on my homerun app. The night manager at Mario's flips. He tells me that it's no good, he'll only accept printed, that I should have told him when I came in. He starts screaming in the middle of the restaurant and caps it off by simulating slapping me in the face.   Let's be clear how offensive this is. I've a women in my twenties. He's a man in his forties. And he just simulated slapping me in front of 15 people because I had the gall to use a prepaid coupon his restaurant had volunteered to offer.  In my opinion, he stopped just short of assault, and I absolutely felt unsafe and threatened while in their restaurant.  I'm disgusted that this is the way we were treated for patronizing his restaurant with a prepaid coupon that his restaurant agreed to. And by bringing friends who spent double what the coupon was worth. \u00a0None of us will ever be returning, which is a shame because I really loved this place and despite not living in the neighborhood made it a point to come several times a year and recommended it to many friends. I'll never make that mistake again.",

We walked in and stood at the bar for about five minutes where we waited for the bartender to look up from the wine glass he was cleaning to acknowledge our existence. \u00a0He never does look up and give us eye contact but he finally asked us if we \"needed a menu or something.\"  Our friend asked to see the cigar selection and the bartender snapped \"we don't sell cigars and we haven't sold them for over fifteen years.\"  We then asked him if he would happen to know of any place nearby that does sell cigars and the bartender gets even more visibly annoyed by our mere presence and snaps, again without even looking up to acknowledge our existence \"NO, I DON'T---there isn't a single cigar shop in North Beach!\"  At that point we decided we didn't even want to bother with ordering a glass of water from this jerk, so we hightailed it out of there, all three of us swearing that we would never step foot in that place again. \u00a0  Now I realize that our lack of knowledge about this place did make us look like a group of idiotic tourists, but that's still no excuse for treating us like second-class citizens...and even if we had been Midwestern tourists there still isn't any excuse...I realize that tourists can be annoying and I make fun of them just as often as everyone else, but still...behavior like that is just uncalled for, no matter if someone is a tourist or not...  Anyhow, our experience was so unpleasant I doubt we will ever step foot back into this place...  And to the bartender with the slicked-back dark hair and goatee---you are a jerk and I suggest you brush up on your customer service skills.",

The sandwiches were good but very different from the East Coast version on which I grew up: they use Swiss cheese here, a really different twist. Both servers were incredibly nice local hipsters who clearly cared about the job they were doing and answered our initial barrage of questions about the beer on the menu with which we weren't familiar.

They also have good selection of wines and their cappuccino's are excellent.  Above all else, it's a neighborhood spot. I love going in and sitting in the corner table and writing for hours. During the day you can people watch as they walk through North Beach or play in Washington Square park. The people who work there are all very interesting and great conversationalists. Almost as an art form. On nice weekend days, they open doors on both sides of the establishment to get a great cross breeze and an influx of neighborhood characters.

Considering I have been here a few times before, I expected to wait five minutes for the staff to acknowledge me, but twenty minutes of sitting outside and I still didn't have a menu, glass of water or any awareness that I was there. Indeed other folks on the five tables outside also seemed rather confused (this is a tourist area). Once I did get service, the waitress had a serious attitude - as if I had somehow inconvenienced her somehow. Seriously....she's a waitress...that's her job. Even better if she has a smile on her face. But no...By the time I got the check, I just wanted to get out of there.  To the management of Mario's: Your service is getting worse. I for one won't be back, and judging from some other reviews, the hipster attitude is alienating your regular customers.

The crunch of the bread combined with melted cheese and warm sauce was a great combination. We also had the grilled chicken #1 sammy- dijon mustard, pepper jack cheese, and onions on the amazing focaccia bread. This one was good too. I had the caprese salad- fresh mozzarella, sliced tomatoes, and fresh basil pesto. This was tasty, the pesto was awesome. Mario's is priced right, the service is excellent, and the food is terrific.

So instead I'll say the panini is good and I am really anxious to try some of the bigger varieties of sandwiches. A panini is more a snack you and a friend would share as you take advantage of the beers on tap.   But the real draw is the Americano. So far the best I have had in SF. I know it is just espresso and hot water, but beyond Starbucks it's tough to find good ones and Mario's Americano is great.   I just love the fact you can get an espresso drink and a biscotti or other dessert or load up on carbs with beer and Italian food. Or both in the same day if you plan it right (one of these days).   And the location right on Washington Square is unbeatable. Considering 90% of Columbus Ave is tourist traps, Mario's is a must see European style cafe, even down to the slow service.

This place is my go to spot for chilling at a restaurant near the park, people watching, good sandwich eating, and having a great meal for a reasonable price. Don't expect the severs to wait on you hand and foot, but the service isn't bad either. They'll get your food and drinks to you in a reasonable amount of time, but since the place is so small they will probably be busy. You might have to wait to get a table if you come on a weekend, but if you're looking for an amazing sandwich, do yourself a favor and wait it out. It'll be worth it :)",

Had to grab a quick bite before our son's concert across the park at St. Peter &amp; Paul on a Saturday night. Sat at the counter - me, hubby, daughter. Ordered the half carafe of wine while waiting for hubby to find parking.  Daughter orders caprese and a pizza. She has pronounced it the best caprese in the world - the tomatoes were perfectly ripe, the mozzarella was the freshest she's had, and instead of just a basil leaf, they topped it with a dab of pesto which she loved.  I had the grilled eggplant half sandwich plus a salad. It was the best, most simply satisfying sandwich ever. The caesar was just fine.  Hubby also had the sausage half sandwich/salad combo and he liked his meal as well.  But what gives them the extra star(s)? Service. They were so incredibly friendly. \u00a0In fact, while we were there, one of the people associated with our concert came to get some to-go sandwiches for a few of the boys who were singing. They made them as fast as was humanly possible with only 2 guys working the whole place and most of the tables taken.  And towards the end, after we paid the check, they realized they didn't charge us for the half carafe of wine...so they apologized, brought the bottle over and filled our glasses to the top gratis, and then gave us the wine check for the original half carafe. That made me so happy because I wanted just that one more glass of wine but wasn't going to order one. I love it when people make inconsequential mistakes but have the good sense and superior customer service approach to make it an opportunity instead. They have guaranteed my return business by that simple gesture (which they didn't need to do) and this is exactly why I will be back again and again.",

It's a true North Beach institution and rivals Cafe Trieste and some others in that regard. It has its 'people' and following. I can't be objective about the food or service, since I've had everything they make 1000 times and know everyone personally who works there. This place has been a home to me. And I appreciate Paulo the owner and all the various people over all the various time periods that has made Marios a part of my life.  For the unintiated, Marios is a place you go to just hang out and be merry. You have some red wine, order a pizza or a meatball sammy and talk loud and be animated or sit outside on the stockton street side between 4-6 when the sun is shining there and people watch.  Be cool with the people who work there and they will be cool with you. Tip well and they will be even cooler.  Marios hours sort of roll with how busy it is, it can be open late. In the old days it was open really late on weekends, and I still think the owner should re-consider serving food til 12:30am on Fri and Sat., as there is nothing this end of the 'hood to get a pizza when hungry late.  They selection of food is not vast, but it what it is and its consistent. This is not a place to come in being a vegan or foodie. Just be cool. Bring a cool book or some post-cards or a scrabble board or deck of cards or your flyers for your next gig or some Euro hotties you just met -- converse, hang out, see what happens -- and enjoy a beer and go on about your business. A pretty good tiramisu, carrot cake and some other treats to go with the coffee. No soy here! You want raw milk without pasteurization? I applaud you -- just don't come looking for that at Marios. This is a good old fashion real authentic north beach haunt.  Bravo!  PS Once you couldn't smoke inside anymore, they did away with the cigars -- and they finally got a credit card machine a few years back after being known for \"cash only\" -- i took great pleasure watching a guy on a first date sadly have to make the walk up the block to the ATM...ah, the good ole days... :-)",

We've been here a couple times before because they are open late, until 11:00. \u00a0  My friend ordered the Chicken Panini and I ordered the standard Mario's green salad tossed with a balsamic vinegarette.  His panini came right out of the grill: hot, melted, gooey loveliness between two crunchy soft pieces of bread.  My salad hit the spot, a large round plate loaded with crisp Romaine, tomatoes and red onions. \u00a0I worked out earlier this morning AND walked 7 blocks in my 2 1/2 inch platform sandals, so two slices of French Bread took refuge in my stomach.  I love Mario's for the casual atmosphere and the typical corner where we could watch the people walk by enjoying this sudden turn of events regarding cold SF weather. \u00a0I wore a summer dress out and it was nice to have bare shoulders once in a while.

When asked if we could get the drinks, the server replied \"as you can see, we are really busy tonight.\" There are 5 tables, so if that's busy....well, we have problems.   At any rate we wait...and...wait for the drinks. Why start eating dessert when you have no liquid to wash it down? Drinks were the highlight because two of the three desserts were unedible. The chocolate cake was dry and tasted like a cake from Cosco. My ricotta cheesecake was reminiscent of a quiche, eggy tasting and like the chocolate cake, dry. I took one bite and pushed it the side. Tiramisu that my friend ordered was decent.  Server came by about 15 minutes later and I told him I didn't enjoy the cake. He said, \"it's supposed to taste that way, it has ricotta.\" OK, but the point is I don't like it. Bill comes with cheesecake charged on it.

The ingredients are ok (the foccacia is nice of course), but it's cooked in that little oven and mine got singed and smokey, which was not good. I liked that they had a half-sandwich offering ($5.50 rather than $9.75), but they didn't mention the half is open-faced - not bad, just something I'd like to have known. The beer selection was fairly limited. I would recommend going one block over and getting an excellent meatball sandwich (or spectacular pizza) at Tony's Slice House.",

The focaccia is completely different from the recipe they used back then, when it was fresh, chewy, and delicious - this time is was a little overly crisp and the flavor was just not very good. My sausage sandwich was cold and not much better after I asked the guy to put it in the oven again (annoyance factor). My partner's meatball sandwich was...meh. The hipster dudes behind the bar seemed not that excited with their job. I won't be going back to spend my hard earned smacks when there's so much other good food in this city!",

    "review_text": "No smoking of cigars, but the oven baking the focaccia sandwiches can fill up the place with that burnt bread smell that's actually kind of nice, but makes your clothes stink for days. \u00a0I've enjoyed every visit to Mario's. \u00a0It's the kind of place that I would love to own. \u00a0Or what I'd use as a template for the perfect comfortable cafe with food and wine. \u00a0I order a half carafe of the montepulciano, an Italian red and the eggplant marinara sandwich on focaccia. \u00a0They layer the sandwich with thin slices of breadcrumb coated fried eggplant, roasted red peppers and then a layer of provolone. \u00a0Then bake it open-faced in the oven on the wall. \u00a0After ten or fifteen minutes, they slap the two sides together and slice it diagonally and garnish with those green pepperocinis, which I bite the end off, pour the tangy vinegar into the sandwich and then munch down as I eat the sandwich and sip the red wine in smallish hexagonal tumbler glasses. \u00a0 One memorable time was when my brother Rufus visited and we went there on a Monday for dinner. \u00a0It was raining out. \u00a0We ate and had the wine. \u00a0It continued to rain, they had cool music playing. \u00a0Coltrane or Sonny Rollins or Thelonious Monk... \u00a0Anyway, we didn't leave that place for 3 hours just laughing about dumb things we used to do as kids and can now talk about. \u00a0No reason to go out in the rain when you've already found a cool place to hang. I do have to admit that in the past few years, the charm has changed a bit for the worse. \u00a0The lighting is now much brighter and too bright in my opinion. I like it dim when work on getting a good wine buzz. \u00a0And the jazz music has been replaced by either dancey world music or reggae or just contemporary Alice-type music. \u00a0Maybe it's the workers who just play their iPods or whatever they want. \u00a0 The great foccacia they use for the sandwich is from Liguria Bakery on the corner of Stockton and Filbert, but the Italian French Bakery up the street on Grant @ Union makes a decent substitute, but it's not the soft wonderful foccacia from Liguria. \u00a0There's a difference. \u00a0They ran out of the Liguria foccacia bread for the sandwiches a couple of times too and I asked about when they changed to the Italian French Bakery foccacia, our waitress was convinced it's always been the same. \u00a0They also installed a few taps of draft beer, which is nice, but I suggest the red wine with the sandwiches. \u00a02006, the old school is changing.  Update: They had a sign on the window saying they're using Liguria focaccia. \u00a0Hmm. \u00a0Maybe they read the yelp reviews...cool.",

The carafe of red wine and the sunny day certainly helped, although it did get a touch cold on the terrace because the sun wasn't directly hitting it. Despite the homeless serenader and the nippiness, however, it was a fabulous way to spend a lovely President's Day and be outside after such a long week of rain. Our server slash bartender was friendly, in a quirky hipster kind of way, and the prices were the usual North Beach standard... which, in this case, were absolutely worth it.

    "review_text": "It makes me so sad to write this because I used to adore this place. But after the last few visits here I've decided this place is kind of shit.  First off, there's no seating. Heaven forbid you arrive in a group with more than two people and have to cram yourselves in one of their tiny ass tables. To be honest, their tables aren't even that small. There's just no place to walk hence, no room to pack four chairs around a table that could easily sustain a small group of people. If there is a fire, you will fucking die.   I get it, it's San Francisco and space is expensive. If you come on your lonesome or on a date though the space isn't that much of an issue. \u00a0Come in with a small group of friends and you'll get some eye rolls from one of the waiters aka wanna-be-king of hipsters, Moustachio ( Epic stache and epic douche ) Anyways, you'll know who I'm talking about when you see him.   Food is pretty pricey considering how little you get. For $8 you can get a tiny ass sandwich with mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. That's it. They won't even spring for a handful of potato chips because fuck you. They give you a couple pepperoncini's though. \u00a0  I think the part that really irks me about this place is the service.   I get it people have bad days and sometimes their service is a bit off. I'm just going to get straight to the point here and say the waiters here are simply bitches. No, they aren't having a bad day because Urban Outfitters burned down and they don't know where else to buy Holga film.  They're just bitches.  Moustachio can't hear your requests for service over his unnecessary facial hair. He hates giving soda refills too because carbonated water and 5 cents worth of syrup is a total scam.   There's another chick that works there that acts like she is so inconvenienced because she has customers to service- ironic considering we are the reason she has a fucking job. She slammed a cup of coffee once on our table and then sauntered over to Moustachio to faun over how large and thick his moustache is. Giggling and twirling the ends of her upper lip facial hairs that someday hope to become as hipster-y as Moustachio.   She's a bitch. He's a bitch. Food is pretty good but pricey and as filling as a holy communion bread chip during a 2-hour Christmas Eve mass right before dinner.",

Most of my old favorite North Beach restaurants are gone, replaced by places that are hipper, shinier, airier, pricier, and packed with tourists and dudebros from the Marina. \u00a0Mario's is one of the remaining holdouts, a funky little triangular building with a bar on one side and a few tables on the other, with a great view of the park. \u00a0You can get a meal here for under ten bucks and a drink for under five. \u00a0It's mostly a local crowd, a good number of youngish hipster types like myself, but there are still a few older North Beach Italians who haven't been driven out yet.  The menu is small and focused -- salads, panini, pasta, that kinda thing. \u00a0All of it good. \u00a0I go for the cannelloni more often than not; it reminds me of Christmas Eve when I was a kid. \u00a0Decent wine and beer selection, and they make a nice cappuccino.

Depending on who is manning the CD carousel, you'll be listening to soothing bossa nova, new age world music, or lively Spanish salsa. Loud but not too loud for table conversation.  Seems to be a quiet choice for active, 20s and 30s North Beach locals who happen to be in the vicinity. Not one tourist to be seen.  Only one bathroom. It's in the back, as large as an airplane restroom, without the mirror. Seems almost like it was installed as an afterthought.  Drink:  Kinda on the small portion size for the money, but hey, it's North Beach. Tea options are nothing exotic and quite limited (about 5 choices of bagged supermarket-grade tea), while coffees are standard fare. They do better by their coffee. Of course, they also have beers, many in bottles and about 3 on tap - I'm personally happy to find Italian beers here, even if only in bottles.  Food:  The desserts are a bit disappointing. Their tiramisu and ricotta cheesecake are the only ones homemade there. The cheesecake tasted nothing of cheese, strongly resembling angel food cake in taste, look and texture. The lower half of the cheesecake was some sort of egg custard. Better to go with a meal order, as that is where their strength lies.  Service:  Good and friendly.

    "review_text": "This has been my favorite hangout in the world since my first visit in 1973, the year the Crismani family took over the former \"Bohemian Cigar Store\" (which really did sell cigars), and i arrived in NB. it had been one of the several \"Italian old men\" coffee/wine bars in North Beach. they were all gone by the late '70's, the Portofino (where Cafe Roma is today) and others i can't remember the names. within months Mario kicked out all the old guys, took out their old Italian pinball machines, and completely shifted the customership to all us 20-somethings who were flooding into San Francisco and NB in the 70's, plus its many continuing beat-era denizens. very smart business plan, betting on the future. there were no windows on the Union Street side at all, those were added in the 80's. Mario kept a box of cigars under the counter to sell just in case someone wandered in and asked for one until he passed away in the 90's. at some point around then they had to take out the Foosball game in the back to add more tables because the landlord raised the rent a lot, also adding the sidewalk tables outside. but aside from such details it really hasn't changed at all. they have had the good sense not to redecorate or try to update. it still has one of the funkiest (but clean) bathrooms in town. Lilliana still bakes the pastries, the sandwhiches are tasty, and the servers are always very neighborhood-y. the generations of customers, servers, and passers-by shift with the years, but the place is timeless.  just thought i'd offer some history for context.",

Then I realized that they also serve some of the best sandwiches in San Francisco...!  The foccacia sandwiches which range from about $7.75 to $9.50 are huge and amazing! I was particularly impressed with chicken #1 and the tuna sandwich but the grilled eggplant and grilled veggies were good too.  The panini sandwiches are a bit smaller and about $1 less and still great! The salads are also very fresh and I've heard that the pizza's are yummy.  The cappuccinos that I've had have been very good but the straight coffee's that I've ordered have been not as good... In terms of other beverages, they have lots of great wine starting at about $5 a glass (Dad complained that they weren't using \"real\" wine glasses outside... more like mini water glasses but I think he may have gotten a bigger pour than a wine glass!).  We stalked a group that were finishing their lunch and then grabbed their great table out in the sun. There aren't enough outside tables but it's great when you can get one!   I've also done take-out for dinner and their sandwiches maintain their amazing quality as they travel in perfect little cardboard boxes where they can't get squished!",

So it was without thinking of this ailment that I bit into a pepperocini while at Mario's. OH GOD DAMMIT TO HELL THAT BURNS! I shoved the generous portion of the offending pickled peppers to the side of my plate.   I took a bite of my heapingly huge foccacia sandwich (your choice of fillings: chicken, eggplant, sausage, you name it!) as the crusty corner of the deliciously perfect foccacia brushed against my lip-pimple.

Thank you, Mario, for serving up delicious food, a very cozy and homey atmosphere, and lessons in karmic retribution and humility before god.   Note to those confused by the name of the business: The food is not Bohemian in any way, and while cigars are sold, they cannot be smoked here.

The bathroom was unique but clean and funny to use.  I ordered the smoked turkey hot focaccia sandwich which was perfectly grilled and delicious. It was served with a great cucumber salad and pickle.

I LOVE FOCACCIA!  it was late afternoon and hardly crowded at all, but i swear could they have been any slower?? \u00a0i was starving, and i did not enjoy the fact there was nothing else on the menu you could munch on along with the sandwich. minus one star.  i got my sausage with marinara and swiss focaccia sandwich, it smelled great and looked great, but for $10.00 including tax and tip. \u00a0UH... not so great. \u00a0i felt it was missing something, like a kick! \u00a0it was a bit bland, i was looking for lots of flavors on many levels. \u00a0it fell short. minus last star, BUT I Must say that the focaccia bread was delish!  maybe this place is more of a beer/wine joint. \u00a0i will not be returning. \u00a0i'd prolly go back to giordano bros a couple of blocks down if i were to get a sandwich in north beach. :) smiles tho",

SO GOOD! The bread...incredible, the flavors in the eggplant, wow, hearty.... I tried his tuna.... SO GOOD! WIN!   ***note, the amount of Malbec had no influence whatsoever on the rating of the food, promise!***  The server was a really nice character who poured our last glass on the house.... don't know if that meant he was really being gratuitous or if it was because we almost finished the bottle... :) Who cares!

Reading the newspaper while eating the #2 grilled chicken sandwich (request it open faced!) was the best way to spend this relaxing, sunny Saturday.   Mario has a very attentive staff and great food, although I found myself walking past it for several months before walking in and trying it out. It isn't ideal for large groups, but a great place for intimate coffee or brunch/lunch time w/ friends. The ideal seating would be the front table away from the draft that comes from opening and closing the door.   Again, I recommend the coffee, espresso (strong!) and grilled chicken sandwich open faced. The caprese salad would be more delightful sans the pesto sauce but other than that, I've heard good things about their other sandwich and panini options.",

The food came, and it was pretty darn good. \u00a0I think the meatball sandwich was better than the sausage sandwich, but I was happy with both of them. \u00a0The focaccia is great too, I don't think they make it there, but it was tasty! \u00a0  I'd definitely go back for lunch sometime. \u00a0There were several other sandwiches on the menu I wanted to try, and the coffee wasn't bad either! \u00a0More than anything, I just loved the atmosphere, the view, the company, and the food! \u00a0I guess that's everything there!",

The skinny...  Yes, they used to sell cigars. \u00a0Heck, the place used to be filled w smoke when you walked in, when smoking inside was still legal. \u00a0When the non-smoking law started, they still sold cigars, just no more smoking.  An espresso here is iconic.  They make a mean cappuccino. \u00a0It's written up in many a travelers guide. \u00a0We're talking internationally. \u00a0  The breaded eggplant is just as awesome now as it was way back when. \u00a0Only now many peeps seem to love the grilled eggplant just as much. \u00a0I say yes to both; let your mood decide or order a 1/2 of each.  Standouts... The chicken. \u00a0The meatball. \u00a0The sausage. \u00a0The tuna. \u00a0The veggie. \u00a0The turkey. \u00a0The combo (ham &amp; salami). \u00a0Yes, they're actually all great. \u00a0No joke. \u00a0Basically, if you haven't had a focaccia sandwich from Mario's, preferably right out of the oven &amp; piping hot w the requisite pepperoncinis...then you just haven't lived. \u00a0And that's their focaccia sandwich out of the OVEN; NOT a panini from the panini press. \u00a0There's just no comparison. \u00a0Trust.  The house made tiramisu is THE BEST in NB. \u00a0No contest.  Sometimes the service is great, sometimes it's not great. \u00a0But the tunes playing are always great. \u00a0Always. \u00a0So, just tune the service out if need be &amp; enjoy everything else. \u00a0  An institution. \u00a0Mangia.",

However after wandering back here on a beautiful sunday afternoon to try one of their delicious looking foccacia sandwiches, I have to settle on giving Marios 3 stars.   Marios is a nice little place that offers a little bit of everything. Food, drink, coffee...the only problem is that they don't particularly stand out in any one of these categories. Don't get me wrong, nothing here is bad and the atmosphere is quite nice, but you'll most likely leave Mario's thinking \"well, it was pretty good, but not great...\"  Pretty good service, pretty good food, pretty good drinks...but nothing stands out. \u00a0So while I can't fault them or say anything negative I have to give them a somewhat neutral review.

[UPDATED 3/15/13: It looks like they might have improved their menu a bit. \u00a0Also, since I last dined there, I've noticed that many TV shows with episodes or scenes that are meant to be set in SF tend to show the facade of Mario's Bohemian.

OMG, What a boring review! I'm sorry but the review is true. We were loving it. Mario's Bohemian Cigar Store Cafe. What a Great place!",

When I got back to work and opened the box I was surprised to see a very small chicken panini. For $10 I thought it was going to be bigger and it didn't look like anything like what was being served. I guess what I saw was the focaccia sandwich. Aside from the size, the chicken panini was absolutely delicious!! I can say that I will return for it and maybe get a salad for a side if I'm really hungry. Service was without a smile but I noticed they are a little nicer to regulars.

The actual cafe was a cigar bar many moons ago, not much has changed however now it's a hot sandwich spot \u00a0and cafe. I'd advise you to grab a seat at the bar if there is room, but the old school tables next to the windows are not bad either.  Cruise in and grab a hot focaccia sandwich with a few beers (ANCHOR ON DRAFT) and the \u00a0small-vintage vino glasses of red wine wine is nostalgic and PROPER. To complete the Mario's experience grab the best piece of tirramisu you'll ever eat along with a cappuccino made with Graffeo coffee roasted locally right up the street.  After visiting this spot you'll be embarrassed of where you eat and drink coffee.",

    "review_text": "It turns out that this is my sister's favorite cafe in San Francisco, and she'd been hiding it from me for almost 10 years! \u00a0Since she introduced me to Mario's, I find myself drawn back here every time I want to sit with a friend over coffee and dessert or a sandwich without having to deal with the rough, misanthropic crowd over at Cafe Trieste or the overly bright lighting at Mara's. \u00a0Mario's feels intimate, definitely Bohemian, maybe a little sexy. \u00a0It's your secret hideaway in plain sight. \u00a0  The cafe mochas here are delicious, rich, not made with cheap chocolate like at so many other places in the area, but something smooth and tasty. \u00a0The crunchy focaccia sandwiches are delish, if perhaps a tad pricier than expected for \"just a sandwich\" (giving me a pepperoncini or two with it doesn't really count in my book, especially since I don't even like them). \u00a0There are better sandwiches out there, but these tasty. \u00a0  But best? \u00a0Is the homemade tiramisu. \u00a0YUM. \u00a0Seriously? \u00a0It's the BEST in the city, even *gulp* better than mine (and I make a MEAN tiramisu!!! \u00a0Just ask my friends...). \u00a0Who would've thought I'd find it here in what is essentially a cross between an Italian coffee shop and Hernando's Hideaway?!!  I think this is a great place for a first date. \u00a0Or catching up with an old friend. \u00a0It's not well suited to larger groups, because it's actually kind of a tiny place, narrow and a bit cramped, although I HAVE seen folks trying to fit 6-7 people at what is really a four-top. \u00a0  If you're in a WHEELCHAIR, this place might be a bit too frustrating to try to maneuver around, and I'm not sure how accessible the bathroom is, since I didn't visit on any of the times I was here.  Just writing this review has made me think about going back to Mario's for another round of cafe mocha and tiramisu...mmmm....!!!!",

Also a perfect place to people-watch if that's your thing. Mario's has a certain charm about it that you may notice when you step inside. It's relaxed. It's small. Even the service is pretty relaxed. Don't expect chipper, happy-go-lucky waitresses taking your order in harmonious sing-song voices. Rather, the service is no-nonsense, you'll get your shit when it comes.   The meatball sandwich is indeed a delight! Melted mozzarella and meatball with marinara sauce on toasted onion focaccia bread. I love how gooey the cheese is (definitely not a clean eat). The sandwich, among most other things on the menu, are priced reasonably at around 8-15 dollars.   Spend a warm, sunny (you get a few in SF) afternoon here on your next visit to North Beach!",

    "review_text": "The place is a rustic looking bar, located in an odd shaped corner, with indoor and outdoor seating overlooking Washington Square park. It's a great local cafe, well suited for lingering while sipping on your cup of cappuccino, latte, or wine (or whatever you like to drink), and enjoying the view of the park and the people that walk by. Despite the name they don't sell cigars here (they just kept the name).  Their menu includes focaccia and panini sandwiches, a few salads, pizza, a few hot dishes (cannelloni, lasagna, eggplant parmigiana, polenta with sausage), coffees and bar drinks (beer, wine, etc.). Surprisingly, they have a lot of vegetarian options in the menu. I like the focaccia sandwiches. They are open-faced, so it's more like getting 2 'mini pizza' (they sell personal pizzas also), with the toppings and melted cheese on top of the delicious+toasted+fluffy focaccia bread (from the famous Liguria bakery). I have tried the chicken #1, meatball with marinara and onions, and the veggie. Sandwiches are $9.75, and the half sandwiches are $5.50. It's a little pricey for sandwiches, but this is an expensive tourist area, so it goes with the territory.  And don't forget to get a slice of cake for dessert ($4). I like their homemade Ricotta Cheese Cake - this is not a \"cheesecake\", this is a cake that has cheese in it. Let me explain, think of this like a moist cake with a built-in custard in the bottom part. Their chocolate cake is good too.  The place is usually busy, and they use a small oven to make all the sandwiches, so the wait for food could be long (like I said before: good for lingering). If there are no seats available, I recommend that you place the order to go, come back in 10-15 minutes to pick it up, and enjoy a picnic in the park across the street.  ******************* Additional tip: FYI, if you prefer a cheaper sammie instead (not grilled, no focaccia), you could go to Petite Deli (~$6, ciabatta bread, long wait time also) which is only 3 blocks away from Mario's down Columbus Ave, past the WS park (PD closes at 4pm M-F/ 3pm Sat, closed on Sundays). And while you're at PD, maybe get some yummy chocolate truffles next door at XOX Truffles (XOX closes at 6pm).",

So I decided to go with one of their sausage sandwiches. Overall, I think both my friend and I enjoyed our sandwiches (she got the half meatball so it was open-faced), but maybe it's just a preference, this wouldn't top my list of best sandwiches and I'm not hurrying to go back. The panini was really crispy and the sausage was good, but wouldn't be my top pick as far as flavors. I asked for some crushed red pepper and that helped.  Service was good, we went in on a weekday and they were pretty quiet. My friend wanted a diet coke but they only have specialty sodas, he brought her one to taste, but she didn't care for it, it was no problem, they didn't charge us for it. He checked in on us constantly as well.  I'd recommend anyone to try this place, it's definitely a solid sandwich, just wouldn't be the top of my list.",
