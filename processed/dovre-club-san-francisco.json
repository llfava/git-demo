But simple and dive bars go together.  I got to meet one of my favorite Yelpers at the Dovre, Tom R., who puts together the dive bar meetup groups in the Mission District. Tom's awesome, just as his reviews indicate. \u00a0And, those at the Dovre were an eclectic mix of people who were friendly, funny, expressive, bohemian, artistic, smart, happy to meet others and have a good time. \u00a0 There's nothing like standing shoulder to shoulder with some good people sharing drinks, stories, and good times in a relaxed, down-home, unpretentious dive bar setting. \u00a0  Tom R you are the real deal, a true Mavin a la Paul Revere calling the local townspeople in for drinks and good times.

I like that on most nights I can count on: strong drinks, a bag of cheetos, seeing my neighbor, getting hit on by a guy who can barely stand and then stares awkwardly as he catches his balance, fun shit people sing along to on the jukebox (which is not always a good thing as I heard Fat Bottomed Girls last like 3 times yesterday in here).

I made my way up to the bar and ordered the standard, Capt and Coke. hmm, fairly light poor, but then again i'm not a local. So i ease on over to the juke, CD's not DL so thats a plus, they did have a pretty good selection from Tom Waits to Fugazi. NIIIIIIICE, my kinda stuff. So while sitting at the bar i start talkin to a local, tells me some of the history of the place, and once your golden here you stay that way. (Apparently he gets 86'd every now and then) So i have prolly 7 or Cpt's, all light on the pour, cept for the last one as maybe the bartender got the hint as i was downing them like shot of water. \u00a0-hey if you know me, i tend to drink fast, all night. After people watching for a bit, to see who are the DB folks, i see that well maybe because it was a \"Christmas party\" they aren't too keen to talk to anyone but their own group. One guy in particular seemed to enjoy snubbing the locals, LOL, what a tool. anyways I digress, So i said hello and goodbye to the gent who organized it (Dicky) and headed back to my usual haunts. \u00a0Dovre is A-OK in my book, a bit out of the way, but worth the trip.",

It wouldn't have troubled you that much to pour one last drink, which as it turns out, would have been my first and only drink for the night. No there were not a ton of people waiting around us and it would not have created a \"me too\" phenomenon. You may not have done anything wrong I suppose, but you just didn't do anything that cool either. This probably should be a one star review but whatever.   This is something I've noticed about the city of San Francisco. For all the bad rep that the east coast gets, I have found that overall the people who work in the service industry in SF are far more douchier. Perhaps they've realized that they can treat people like shit and still get the same 3 buck tip on a 10 dollar order. In some ways, I think they are right.... I mean, this is probably because I spent years working as a waiter so I always give them the benefit of the doubt.

Not only will you seem the same couple of bartenders if you frequent the place but you will see the same bar patrons in the same seats each time as well (maybe there are bunks in the back). Anyways the place totally has the Cheers vibe down. And that's always a really cool thing to see in a big city.   The lay out of the bar is well thought out and makes the most of the limited space. The bar itself is a horseshoe that devides the place into two rooms. One room is just seating and the other has a pool table. There are books around to read if your date or friends bore you I guess. A little weird but I love to read so right on. (Although once I start drinking I typically have to close one eye to focus on the words..) The pool table was free when I last played and that in itself deserves a couple of stars.  Since Dovre does not have a Patio all the smokers congregate right outside of the door to the bar in front of the cross walk at 26th and Valencia. The last time I ate across the street at SouthEnd I could literally smell the smoke (and I'm a smoker so if I noticed that's impressive). There are often dogs hanging out so it is a dog friendly bar for which I gave them another star. The drinks are super stiff and reasonably priced. Friendly bartenders, speedy service- plus plus!  The clientele is extremely eclectic. 9pm on a Friday night you will see guys in skinny jeans, guys in baggy jeans nearly around their knees, old guys, young guys, tough guys, nerds.. But not quite as many women- except those there with one of the previously mentioned guys. A great spot for a single lady. She will feel like she's hunting- at a buffet table.",

No, it is not the Dovre. But, in the spirit of our relationship not starting out in a traditional place we decided that nothing could possibly tip the romance scale more than not just seeing a drag show but seeing it hungover and tired. True love, bitches. You should be jealous.   So, THIS is where the Dovre comes in. It is a lovely sort of worn, but in a good way, place to go and hang out with friends over a few strong cocktails, a game of pool and a some really good tunes in a low key atmosphere. You will enjoy yourself so much that you will not realize you are shutting the place down and forcing yourself to go on your special obnoxious decoration tranny bar drinking date on a mere 3 hours sleep.   Awwwww....... thanks again Dovre for being such an awesome bar and, this last time, helping contribute to our very special date night!",

This bar is way the heck out there for me (in terms of distance from home), but worth the trek for a nice, chill place to grab a well-priced drink and actually be able to hear your friends as you chat it up. The couches are comfortable (though a bit low, which is a little weird, but forgivable) and the tables are spaced well-enough apart that you don't feel like you're breathing down the necks of the people next to you. And I didn't even try out the arcade games and pool table, but I'm sure they work just fine and get more fun with increased inebriation. Solid.",

I didn't ask him about it because I'm sure he's tired of the question.   Dovre club used to be on 18th street, in The Women's building, but was evicted years ago. I don't know if Elvis owned the old Dovre Club, he looks a little young to have, but this location is a vast improvement.   The Staff and regulars are a friendly bunch. Elvis himself is a great host; more in line with what they'd call a Publican in the old country than the typical American Bar owner.  I brought in a large group of people, over 40 and maybe better than 50, and Elvis was not only easy to deal with but he knows how to treat someone that brings in business.  Dovre is definitely in the rotation.",

Not to be confused with some other bartenders who work there and are apparently cool, this chick was a bitch. \u00a030ish, short brown hair, hopped up on coke or something, low evil cackling smokers laugh.  You know how sometimes a bartender or waiter will ask you what you want, and you're not quite ready yet, or your friend hasn't shown up yet and you're just buying time, and you respond that you'd like another minute - then they proceed to be a rude prick or ignore you for the duration of your stay because you were not ready when THEY were? \u00a0Well that's what happened.  And let it be know, I was totally polite. I am not one of these \"treat service workers like crap\" people that Yelpers love to hate on. \u00a0I'm a southern gentleman and try to be nice to everyone.  Anyway - after my friend arrived we sat at the bar TOTALLY IGNORED for a good 10-15 minutes, the bartender didn't even GLANCE at us while we sat there. \u00a0It wasn't very busy either, everyone else had a drink. \u00a0She proceeded to talk to patrons, hug patrons, make a second round of martini's for the couple sitting across from us, bitch about how they were out of martini glasses, then went in the back and WARMED UP HER DINNER IN THE MICROWAVE!  WTF!  Still being ignored, finally she bent down under the bar where we were sitting and I said \"Hi\" really loudly to which she quickly responded \"hi\". \u00a0Then she finished what she was doing and said \"oh sorry\" and finally made our drinks.  My friend frequents this place and said she hadn't seen this bartender before, so I guess we just had bad luck.  The rest of the bar is actually ok. \u00a0Mixed crowd of Irish construction guys, older people, and a few Mission hipsters. \u00a020 oz Guinness for $4.50. \u00a0Reminds me a lot of The Ivy Room in the east bay, minus the music stage.  But this is part of what Yelp is for... real reviews reporting the bad apples even if they work at good places. \u00a0Don't think you can get away with attitude and bad service in SF and it won't show up here for someone to read it.  UPDATE 2008 - I went back on a date. \u00a0The bad bartender was there, but just done with her shift and heading out the door. \u00a0A much nicer bartender (with long dyed braids) took over and was very sweet and flirty.",

I only go here periodically (it's too close to my house to make it a habit - dangerous), but never have a bad time. Now that one of the owners is ill, I feel like supporting this place in any way imaginable. If that means tying one on every other day, bring it. Worse things could happen.  Sure the pool table is wonky and the sofas are torn up, but hey, they have em! And yeah, there are drunks, but if you don't want drunks, go to your hipster WASP bars, yuppies. Several levels above Clooney's, where it is so bright you can perform elective surgery on any number of unconscious drunks any hour of the day, although if the Dovre had Clooney's jukebox I'd be an alcoholic, and happily so.

So I think that's what they're there for. \u00a0WIN! + It's located close by the 24th and Mission BART station, which means easy access to public transportation as well as easy access to El Farolito. \u00a0Double win! + Oh yeah! I forgot! \u00a0It's a BAR! \u00a0So I have to comment on the alcohol, which is decently priced and good. \u00a0Nothing extraordinary because I mean, it's a dive bar, but yeah, still good.
