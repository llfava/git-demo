It looks like a casual live music joint that might serve New American in a semi-sketchy area of town... when in fact you'll find an unusually great combination of Ethiopian food and live jazz.   The decor inside is actually quite nice with art pieces and comfortable seating; there are high tables for pairs that give you a good view of the musicians. Cocktails were delicious, many of which were \u00a0prepared with Abyssinian bitters.   Service was charming; got some great recs from our server. The spongey bread that came with the platters was the most delicious Ethiopian bread I've ever had!  Highly recommend:  - the vegetarian sampler patter - lamb platter (beg alecha) - spicy lentil sambussa - the abyssinian storm (Dark n Stormy with Abyssinian bitters)",

We were inspired by some hipsters who were totally full of themselves on BART. One of them said that they didn't like Ethiopian food because it was \"just sponge bread and mush\". We had to try it out of passive aggressive spite toward those college aged hippies who think that just because they've taken an art history class they are above you. I'm glad they did. The food was excellent.   We got the vegetable sampler (amazing), the spicy chicken (awesome) and the lamb, which was a little too gamey and had way too many bones in it. That was the only downfall of the food, everything else was great.  We chose to ate at a table instead of the easy chairs because we thought it would be easier to eat/talk at the table. But the restaurant is definitely not set up for this type of eating. The table was tiny and the chairs were uncomfortable. I would NOT want to be at this restaurant when it is packed! If it weren't for the shared plate of food we definitely wouldn't have had room on the table for our plates, we barely did with only two pates (one for food, one for bread).  The service was also a little lacking. Our water kept running out as did our bread. But the food was great, so I can't fault them there!",

Kitfo: I'm a huge steak tartare fan, but have been hesitant to try kitfo at lesser hole-in-the-walls that I wouldn't trust with raw meat. \u00a0Sanitary conditions seemed high here so I gave it a go and was not disappointed. \u00a0The meat is slightly warmed, but not cooked, which took me a while to get used but ended up liking. \u00a0The spices are what make it, so many and many unfamiliar, a great vacation from the French capers/shallots/parsley/cornichon presentation. \u00a0The soft injera offered a different texture from crostinis. \u00a0I'd almost say it would be too soft except for the chewy cheese curds offered on the side.  Red Sea: Basically a bloody mary with Ethiopian spices. \u00a0Usually I don't mention drinks, but had to in this case. \u00a0I mean, how many bars spice your cocktails with Ethiopian ingredients? \u00a0Added a great complexity and hotness.",

Initially, we ordered a margarita, a veggie combo, and then we ordered an additional red lentil because it was our favorite entree. \u00a0While the spinach, the yellow lentil, and the potato stews were good, they were not as flavorful as the red lentil. \u00a0The margarita was a bit too sweet for me, probably because it had an additional fruit flavor that they added. \u00a0They quite a bit, so that was nice (it was more than enough for my fianc\u00e9 and I to split).  Though this was a piano lounge and there was a piano, no one was playing it and the music was not quite what I expected. We did go on Christmas Eve so maybe that was why, but it would have been nice to have had some live music. \u00a0The music playing was chill, which was good. \u00a0The ambiance was pretty cute, but nothing extraordinary. \u00a0Overall, it was good for an Ethiopian restaurant, but there are many more options in SF that I would try since I know I can get even more delicious Ethiopian food (at a cheaper price) elsewhere.",

Boy am I glad we stayed. The food was awesome. My wife ordere the Kitfo, (beef tartar) which I thought was really good. she thought it was a bit salty, but between four of us, there was nothing left. I ordered the Beg Alecha (lamb), which had a nice little kick and was super tasty.  Our friends ordered the Yasa-Tibs (catfish), and the special which was sea bass I believe, and both were excellent.  One of the real treats was...get this....the house salad. They make a house dressing (secret recipe I was told) that is lightly tangy, vinegar based, and seriously awesome. If I could figure out all the flavors I'd totally try to make it.  But overall the restaraunt was a pleasant surprise, and I am now a fan of Ethiopian food. Oh, and be prepared to eat with your hands, pretty kool... :)",

    "review_text": "The milieu of this place is AMAZING! I'm in LOVE with the live jazz music. The band, the singer was all just perfect!! Sexy, suave and classy! \u00a0Not too upbeat for a dinner, not too mellow so that it'd be awkwardly romantic for a friends night out, and definitely not to loud (even for such a small, cordial restaurant) so you could still carry a conversation.   There's a bar area, a lounge area, and a dinner area, and usually, those don't really mix, but Sheba puts it together PERFECTLY! Usually, when a restaurant attempts to combine the three, those at the bar would be standing around and getting in the way of those at the tables. And those at the tables think the the bar guys are being rude and obnoxious, etc. etc. BUT, I LOVED that even though I was at a table (which, btw, I STRONGLY suggest you make reservations for if you're going on a Fri/Sat night), I was still able to mix with the tables next to me, as if we're in a lounge! Customers at the tables there are in their \"lounge/bar mode\", so everyone's just DOWN to talk to you, buy you a drink, and/or create all sorts of mischief!   Unfortunately, I wasn't too happy with the food. Ethiopian food is just too spicy and strongly flavored for my taste. I swear they added curry spices to EVERYTHING. I like curry and I like spicy...but they just overdid it on the sodium. I wasn't full, but I FELT full, because my palate was on overload. I had the:  1.) Sirloin Meat Sambussa with Tangy dip: 3/5. This appetizer is like two eggrolls, Ethopian style. Again, the flavors were just too harsh... I think I'd be happier with Filipino-style \u00a0lumpia with sweat and sour sauce.   2.) Sauteed sea Bass: 2/5. The sea bass was SO THIN that most of it was just the breaded part. Didn't taste much of the fish as much as I tasted a salty, crispy, crust. Oh, and the salad that comes with it on the side just seemed like it was soaked in dressing so much that the greens turned dark and whimpy.  3.) Vegetarian Sampler: 3/5. This one is pretty cool, but not in terms of taste...it wins kudo points in the \"ethnically unique\" category. In this dish, the various vegetarian samples come out on top of \"injera\", which is a thin, spongy, sour-flat bread that looks and feels like a pancake. You get more injera rolled on another dish. You unroll the injera and literally grab (yeah, using your HANDS!) the sampler, re-roll it, and eat it like a burrito! That was fun!   I'm a fan...not for the food, but for the people! Even the owner (a very motherly Ethopian woman) was incredibly sweet. When we told her that we had a reservation (and we WERE over 30 min late!!), she didn't even CHECK what our names were. She just made the table HAPPEN, because happy customers are her priority.   Next time, I would definitely come just to lounge. The incredible jazz music will take care of the night itself.",

I wasn't sure what to expect as far as the piano lounge was concerned, but it was nothing to be worried about. The musicians were playing some very good jazz, and there was an assortment of folks enjoying music, drinks from the full bar, and food. The only thing I would caution folks on is that with amped sound and a piano, it was not very good for dinner conversation. We had to talk very loud to make ourselves heard. I would go even just to have a drink and enjoy some tunes.  We ordered lamb, chicken, and I think a veggie combo. It was all delicious and very reasonably priced. We wiped the the platter clean with our injera. Thank goodness the kitchen was still open!",

Now that's an argument for mixing if I ever heard one, and my dumb Euro ass proved what a whitey mic white pants it was. Fortunately our server at Sheba lounge informed me that the red lentils and the 'omg' green collard greens actually go great together. Soon I was also combining the two with some yellow lentils. Who would have thought!?  Sheba gets extra credit for debunking this tendency of mine. Surly my future Ethiopian eating experiences will never be the same, and I may also carry over this lesson onto my Indian dining experiences - I'll sagg up YOUR chicken tikka marsala bitch! The food, however, was a little dry and gave me heart burn (wait, what doesn't anymore?). The injera was also pretty dry, and was not spongy enough. My Mr. had not had Ethiopian food at some of my other spots, and I kinda wish he had.

    "review_text": "So maybe I'm a little biased since I celebrated my birthday here last week, but I had an absolutely wonderful time. \u00a0  I made reservations 4 days in advance, and they kept calling me to make sure I was still coming and still had the same number of people, so when we arrived on Friday night, they had an entire sectioned reserved for our group of 14. \u00a0The section was perfect since it was isolated from the rest of the tables, complete with couches, coffee tables, big windows covered in sheer drapes, and a nice fire going (which we soon had to turn off since it got too hot). \u00a0  Friends were trickling in, so the servers and bartenders were very nice, taking drink orders, appetizer orders, and checking on us periodically. \u00a0I suppose the service was a bit slow when it came to our entrees, and had I been really hungry I might have been a little upset. \u00a0But I was enjoying the company too much to mind that my night out was lingering on. \u00a0  In terms of the food itself, I found it all delicious. \u00a0The lentil dip and sambusa appetizers were fresh, hot, and scrumptious. \u00a0And although I'm still not a huge fan of the Ethiopian bread, I am a huge fan of eating with my hands and filling bread with meaty and veggie goodness. \u00a0We tried almost one of every entree it seems, and I thought all the sauces, meats, and veggies were well cooked. \u00a0The beef tartare had some moments of chewiness, so I may forgo getting that again. \u00a0The portion sizes were decent, so I imagine if I came back with fewer people I could get filled up quickly. \u00a0  The main reason I chose Sheba was because of the promise of live jazz after 9 pm with no cover! \u00a0The band was so close to us and the music was great. \u00a0It began as nice background music to our conversation and by the time dessert rolled around we were singing along (quietly and tastefully of course). \u00a0  I love live music, good food, and a charming ambiance so I'll definitely come back here. \u00a0Thanks for a fabulous birthday, Sheba!",

Add the impending opening of Yoshi's and all of a sudden you have your own jazz preservation district, with Boom Boom Room up the street.  The decor is friendly and seductive at the same time. It's a great place to unwind with a martini or glass of wine, and they have a piano player almost every night of the week. My advice, go on a slow night where you have more of the bar to yourself, find a table and take in whatever jazzy standards your piano man is jazzing the night away with.  Note: Like Rassela's, the cuisine is Ethiopian, a strangely compelling bedfellow to the loungey atmosphere.",

Sheba has a different live band playing every single night of the week.   I went on a Wednesday night, and thought it might be a quieter night, but it turned out this place was bumping. There was a huge table right by the band in the prime spot. I think they know the band because a few of them ended up going up and singing.   The musicians were great, but 2 out of the 3 singers were actually not that great. I could see this place being perfect with the right band, but I guess a Wednesday night means the they don't bring out the top talent.   The atmosphere is pretty classy, perfect for a date. I just grabbed drinks but the Ethiopian food looked so good at the table beside me, I almost ordered a second dinner!  I'll be back here again, but will have to try a weekend night next time.",

My partner threw me a surprise graduation party here and it couldn't have been more perfect! Ever since we have thrown other special events here (birthday party, even baby shower!). Sheba has become our extended living room--that's how comfortable it is.   The staff is so friendly and personable. They have live music that makes for a very comfortable and inviting environment. The food is delicious! I am vegetarian and only have a taste for mildly spicy food which they not only accommodated for, but they already had it on the menu. The place is beautifully decorated and even has a fireplace, it makes for a very romantic evening with a special someone or even a special time with friends. I would highly recommend Sheba Lounge to anyone no matter what size the party is or the occasion, they have mastered it all. They have great happy hour specials too!   Can you tell I am in love with this place?",

There are many cultural gems in the Bay Area and this small lounge is certainly amongst the most unique of such options. Seven days a week, the Sheba Piano Lounge hosts nightly jam sessions of a variety of music styles -- primarily jazz. We saw an eclectic mix of musicians and music styles last Sunday evening.  As you lean back and snap your fingers to the smooth sounds, peruse the bar menu to sample some of the unique cocktails and Ethiopian Dishes.  I will definitely be back to the Sheba Piano Lounge during my next trip to the Bay. Such a unique and eclectic place for a boy from the boonies such as myself.",

I know that usually Ethiopian food is served as a communal meal but here you get your own plate (with unlimited injera, don't worry).

First I wasn't sure if it would work and the minute I mentioned that, the server went and spoke to the owner who personally showed up to ask about my concern. She was willing to give us a table except all were already reserved for big parties. Since there was no choice in the matter, we decided to stay. It turned out to be a really good decision. We could get everyone around the table and since everyone shared the dishes, it was perfect. The food is excellent. Everyone loved it.  And of course, there is piano music playing right besides you.

First, the Lounge itself is beautiful. While I waited for my gals for our monthly dinner (yes, I was the first to arrive!!), the friendly hostess/server explained some cocktails to me in the lounge area with big, comfy seats. I ordered a drink and waited happily for the gals to arrive.   We eventually decided to sit down at a table and had our pick of the place since we were the only ones there (about 7 on a Monday night; by the time we left it was starting to pick up). We ordered 3 servings of the vegetarian combo platter, and the server gave us more injera when it looked like we were getting low. EVERYTHING in the platter was delicious. One of the items was a little too spicy for me, but everything else was perfectly spiced and so yummy! We didn't order desert because, as my loyal readers know, I always have cupcakes.   My only complaint (and reason for the loss of 1 star) was that the music was a bit loud for us being the only ones in there. It wasn't the live music (that didn't start until after we left, but I'd love to hear it), but just the music playing over the speakers. Don't get me wrong, it was GREAT music, but I found it difficult to hear my friend sitting right next to me.

    "review_text": "Wow. This place just oozes sexy.   Boyfriend and I went to Sheba Lounge to see our friend's band, London Street, perform. We were dazzled, put under a spell by the music and the lights and ambiance of the place. We sipped on a bottle of their Syrah (wine special), some Lagunitas, and ordered the spicy lentil sambussa (the best part!!!), vegetarian sampler, and cheesecake brownies for dessert. My tastebuds went to heaven and are still lingering there.   It was my first time trying Ethiopian food. As of then, I'm addicted. Cannot wait to go back. Fortunately for us, London Street performs there at least once a month.   Thanks to Sheba Lounge, we had a super fun romantic date night. This is a great place to charm a special someone. The couples at Sheba looked so classy and beautiful.",

Second, they were visibly happy that we devoured our massive combo plate.   And they smiled. A lot.  Why did I want to cross town to eat here again the very next day? \u00a0Because I felt fed rather than served.   My friend made a great comment about the duo's mothering instincts, which I've forgotten, probably because I washed my meal down with some chilled Tej. \u00a0  The lamb is a developing-world version: bone in and strong. \u00a0We thought the beef was tops, but the chickpeas, collards and lentils were close contenders.",

Haven't tried the samosas yet, but just for a change of venue and scenery it's worth it to break the place in before going to The Fillmore. Wild metallic purple, orange, red curtains. Have to mention the RED SEA...metamet (Ethiopian) spice in a semi-bloody Mary...$8 +$1.60 to $2 depending on spiciness! It cleared my sinus right quick.

I honestly didn't come here with high expectations with the food. I read the other reviews on yelp which said the food was okay, but the music was awesome, so I didn't expect much of the food. I also didn't know what ethiopian food was or how spicy it would be.   I'm not normally boring, but I stuck with some sliders. They were probably way fattening, because I had two and I was full (they give ya three) but I also got \u00a0the baklava as well. It's a dark room, with fake candles (so sad), but the ambiance was romantic and classy and jazzy and chic.   I was worried I'd have to dress up (worry is the wrong word, I love to dress up! I love putting on the fancy make up and the heels and the skirt/dress) but since dressing up would mean high heels, a short skirt and trying to find a super warm jacket, I decided I would take my chances and dress down in jeans and normal attire (with heels, can't forget that). I was pleased that some people dressed up in sheba's lounge, but a lot of people kept it casual, so I didn't feel outta place.   The jazz started at 9pm, so don't expect to have a deep convo after nine... and it was pretty much great!! Sheba, or the lady who owns the place greeted everyone personally and asked about the food and stuff and my friend got a free cheesecake whoothoo! free stuff!  Oh, and the sliders were as uhm-azing as the jazz performers (forgot their names, but they were sellin their cd's) and honestly, I ordered sliders, because I thought, \"I can't go wrong with burgers,\" and I was so right. I didn't go wrong with them, but they were the best little things I ever ate! I was screaming at my friends to try a bite.. I probably shouldn't have done that, because it would mean less for me... but when I love something, I would want my loved ones to partake in that delish something as well!  on a sidenote: the 22 is right outside Sheba's which takes you the to Church and Market M-line, and after dinner, my friendzies and I waited for like.....alongtime and then decided it wouldn't \u00a0be coming and went looking for the 38... it mine heels... and we saw two 22 buses broken down.WHATARETHECHANCESTHATBOTH22'SAREDOWN  houston, we got a problem.  BUT THAT IS A TANGENT. back to sheba's lounge: So it was pretty unanimous, out of the four things my four things ordered, it was pretty much agreed that we would definitely come back again and that sheba's piano lounge was such a hit!",

My gf and I came here after having diner at Basil Thai Restaurant and Bar in the SOMA for some cocktails.

Also, we had about an hour to kill before our movie started at the Kabuki Cinema down the block.

Fried is always good and the Mushroom Sambussa and the Crab Sambussa were delicious filled pastries. \u00a0These were also a good way to ease my friends into this cuisine they were new to.  The Vegetarian Sampler was a chance to check out a large selection of the menu. \u00a0The Gomen claimed the win though. \u00a0The collard greens saut\u00e9ed in Ethiopian spices were a hit with everyone at the table. \u00a0  The Lega Wat grabbed our attention immediately after being handed the menus. \u00a0The sirloin tips marinated in white wine and saut\u00e9ed with rosemary, onions and jalapenos actually tasted as good as it sounded.  After sampling the cocktail list, two particular drinks were ordered multiple times: Selassie (Jim Beam, Pernod, and house made bitters). I had heard tales of their bitters but not being a fan I had reservations. \u00a0These aren't your everyday bitters though, yum!  Makeda Martini (Hendricks, cucumber, white grape juice, orange liqueur). \u00a0This one essentially tasted like a spa treatment.  There were two things that weren't quite up to par but I'm not going to hold it against them. \u00a0Their Kitfo (steak tartar) \u00a0wasn't exactly a quality cut. I'll hand it to them though, they weren't shy when it came to piling up the raw beef. \u00a0The entertainment was also a slight disappointment as the band was more jazz than Latin. We were hoping to be doing the samba to work off the extensive meal. \u00a0  Overall, we had a great time and plan on returning. \u00a0Ethiopian food is awesome for groups so adding music to the mix only makes the evening better.",

Instead we had a wonderfully refreshing Riesling. The spicy lentil sambussa was fabulous, but make sure you have some water handy. The beef sambussa was divine; tender and wonderfully flavored. I got the Doro Tibs which was \u00a0nicely flavored and not at all spicy. Oh, and the jazz piano was great.

(i should really start writing these reviews more quickly)  The location is alright (western addition) but it was so difficult to get parking here last night as they had some live music playing right outside Sheba.   So, i have been wanting to try Ethiopian for a long time, but the idea of food sharing (from same plate) doesn't exactly appeal to me, so kept postponing! IDIOT!!  The food was so good! the ambiance itself was OK (too dark) and the music is too loud, and its so crowded so too warm (almost hot) in there.  We tried the lentil sambusa, the beet salad, the vegetarian sampler (the dark lentils was OFF DA HOOK!), the doro tibs, the doro wat (both chicken dishes). the latter was an Indian-esque curry with garlic, ginger, tomato and onions with chicken and boiled egg. Next time i am definitely going to get that (minus the chicken to appeal to my vegetarian preferences).   the service was real slow, but we were there with friends and were in no particular hurry, but even she admitted that she was a bit sparse in appearances.  My friend tried to an Ethiopian wine (honey wine or something) and it was really good! i got a pinot noir, but it wasn't too great (i mean i drank every drop, lol).  Haven't tried any other Ethiopian joints, so dont know this compares but 3/4 of us have been and they all agreed this place was really good. So definitely give it a try!",

The wifey and I ordered the vegetarian sampler and the beg alecha (braised lamb in Ethiopian herb sauce). Our orders also came along with a full plate of injera (thin Ethiopian spongy flatbread that has a similar taste to sourdough). I was very delightfuly surprised by all of the flavors; everything was delicious. Any vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike would especially love the sampler.  We also tried a glass of Ethiopian honey wine at the end of our meal which was quite sweet; having a very notable yet unique honey aroma and flavor.  Chill spot. Delicious food. Cool vibe.

All the veggie was excellent. Lamb tibs was a teensy bit on the watery side, but I say it was still great. The Injera(the bread) could be more moist, spongy, and sour.I want to be there right now and finish off whatever they have left for tonight.. but I should go to sleep for work tomorrow. This place is not afraid to use spice and I love that boldness about this place. Other places.. I could sense that other places were holding back on the spice.

They called me that morning asking me to preorder stuff. Since I didn't know what others in my party would like to eat, I pre-ordered 5 vegetarian samplers.   Guess what, they ran out of food, silverware, and glasses. They got embarrassed and then got the food from a neighboring Eithiopian restaurant (that's what they told us) and then served us with disposable silverware and plastic water cups.  Good food and great music and ambience. I just wish they were honest enough to not take the reservation for 20, for which they obviously aren't fully equipped.",

Tip of the Top Blues band playing at 9:30 on a recent Saturday was excellent - great vocalist, wonderful song selection, ideal volume and good vibes. Everyone appeared to be having a great time and enjoying chatting with their dinner mates while still enjoying the live music.   The pomegranate meatballs were yummy, the veggie sampler provided a good variety and the baklava was tasty (though it would have been much better if they had decaf coffee to serve with it - only regular coffee here, to my dining partner's disappointment). We'll be back (but will skip dessert if they don't have a decaf coffee or tea selection in the future). It would also be a huge improvement if they removed one of the 2 top tables from each row in the main dining hallway since we were all packed in there and had to hear the conversations of the ajoining tables since they were 6 inches away and had to wiggle the tables together for those on the bench side to get out.  That's it, fewer tables and decaf drink offerings and it's 5 star worthy!",

I love my funky, noisy watering holes, but it's also nice to hold court in a chill spot like the Sheba Lounge.  This is a real deal piano lounge--not a modern-style upscale lounge with electronic music, expensive and trendy drinks (and patrons), etc.  My man on the piano (Ricardo Scales) is truly a refreshing person. This isn't the bitter and jaded \"Piano Man\" that Billy Joel sang about. This cat loves his music and has no problem talking with you about as he improvises on riffs, both original and familiar (his version of \"The Look of Love\" made my night!).  And as usual, don't listen to the \"the area is sketchy\" jive (what do people require of this city to feel safe and comfortable? Should we turn it into one huge Marina/Union Street/Mini-Mall scene? But I digress).  This is very nice, renovated, well-lit slice of Fillmore Street. Even on a pretty quiet night at 1 a.m., I was able to snag a taxi within minutes of leaving.",

For example, it's an Ethiopian restaurant with a live jazz band. A live jazz band! Ok, it's maybe not always jazz (sometimes it's a guy singing standards with piano accompaniments) but let's not pick nits here -- this is a fantastic idea! Who came up with this? I'd like to buy them a drink.  There's lots of seating and a fireplace* next to comfy leather couches. Not fantastic for large groups but if you're six-to-eight people, you should be able to find a home here.  On the other hand, that was hands-down the worst Old Fashioned I've ever had. I mean, there was a lemon wedge in it. A lemon wedge? Yes, a lemon wedge. I could get over the fact that it was really small but my girlfriend's cosmo was red dye and vodka. Which, y'know, great for getting hammered quickly but not so much on the taste department.  On the other, other hand** the service wasn't necessarily \"bad\" as it was completely mixed up. Bartender comes up to take our orders, yet we have no menus, so we pick our go-to drinks. She leaves and the waitress comes by to drop off menus. Confused, our soon-to-be-but-we-didn't-know-them-yet friends sitting next to us explain that's sort of how it works when you're just getting drinks and to sit back and relax.  So, we do as instructed and then the waitress comes back to take our order a few minutes later, only to be informed we'd given it to the first woman who had come by. The waitress seems confused by this, but takes the menus and leaves.  Ten minutes later we get our drinks.  There's a lot to like about the possibility at Sheba but they're going to have to work on the service and the drinks to make it a go-to place. Which I'd like to do because Ethiopian Jazz!  * - Trufax: you can use a fireplace year-round in San Francisco. They don't put that on the brochures, though they should.  ** - Going all Zaphod Beeblebrox up in here.",

One con was that the food took quite a while to arrive (about 25 min), and they weren't busy. \u00a0This looked like it was because there was only cook in the kitchen, so I don't really fault them because it was a Sunday night. \u00a0Even the sambusas were late, and interestingly looked like spring rolls but were tasty nonetheless. \u00a0They came with a semi spicy sauce that went well. Another con was the seating wasn't too private, but given this is a piano lounge I think the airy open feel is what they're going for. The seats were quite close together all around the restaurant, making for everyone's conversation public.   The staff was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the food.",

The first time was on a Friday night, and while walking by I caught the sound of a smooth, sweet voice drifting out onto the sidewalk, accompanied by a jazz piano. I went inside, was greeted by a very friendly woman (I think the owner) and sat down for an Ethiopian dish, a glass of wine, and wonderful entertainment, all for less than $20. I loved the performer, who was advertised as being there on Friday nights, (although I didn't see his name posted for this Friday). Although my dish was a little spicy for me, and I found that it helped to wrap it in the Ethiopian bread. I'll admit that it was the music, not the food, that attracted me, but I want to try more dishes.  Tonight after a show at Yoshi's, I was there again, and this time it was intentional. I fell into one of the several empty arm chairs, relaxed in front of the cozy fire, ordered the $4 chocolate cake (delightfully good, filled with chocolate chips), and sat back to enjoy the music that was playing overhead. It was mesmerizing, and I could have stayed there for hours it it wasn't for work tomorrow. I paid my $4.34 bill feeling I had gotten so much more out of my visit. Great service, amazing ambiance, friendly staff, and food you don't find everywhere else.",

I LOVE jazz music, and not having much experience with Ethiopian food, I definitely came with an open mind. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  The place was dimly lit with candles placed on the table, creating a relaxing and inviting ambiance. The waitress was friendly and very helpful when we told her that it was our first visit. The jazz quartet started playing around 8:30pm, and began with some slow jazz.  We started off with two glasses of honey wine that I would definitely recommend. It was sweet and I could almost taste a hint of honey in the aftertaste. For dinner, we ordered the Spicy Lentil Sambussa, Lega Tibs (tender sirloin tips marinated in white wine) and Beg Alecha (lamb braised in Ethiopian sauce). The food comes with a plate of rolled up \"Injera\", which is the Ethiopian staple bread. We tore small pieces and used it to scoop the dishes. The food was delicious and the portions were just right. The bill came down to $60 with tips for two people.  Overall, I had a wonderful time. I definitely enjoyed the live jazz music and cozy setting. I also like the location of the place; not far from Yoshis and Japan town. Whether it is to catchup with friends at the bar, or for a romantic date, or just to try something out of the ordinary, this place serves as the perfect place.   Note: Due to the layout of the place, not every table has a direct view of the jazz band. If that is important to you, call in to request a table that allows for that.",

Located in the Fillmore's Jazz District, Sheba Lounge is an intimate spot to take a date or catch up with a friend. The drinks and prices are decent. I like sitting on the couch by their inviting fireplace and listening to the piano player or house jazz band. I so much prefer the chill vibe to this place versus Yoshi's or other crowded venues in the hood. Unlike those other places, Sheba feels like a real neighborhood jazz bar.  FYI - the owners of Sheba Lounge also own Rassela's across the street. Like Rassela's, Sheba offers some tantalizing, Ethiopian-inspired bar bites, including: Spicy Lentil Sambu (pastry filled with lentils, scallions, ginger, garlic &amp; fresh chili); Meatballs topped with blue cheese; Arangodi (Spinach dip with garlic, serrano pepper, ranch mayo and capers); and Bourbon Glazed Sausage Sliders. All of these items are $10 or less and perfect for sharing. If you're looking for a more substantial meal, Sheba has a dinner menu. No dish on the menu is more than $15.  So if you're looking for a cool place to grab a drink before or after seeing a movie at the Kabuki, swing by Sheba Lounge. You'll be glad you did.",

The live music started at I think around 8:30 PM or so. The place is small and can get crowded as the night progresses. We ordered the samboosas and veggie combo. As is the case in many Ethiopian places, the service is little slower, but not too bad. Food was slightly less spicy to me but spice was right for my friend. Overall the food was delicious.

For folks that want to try ethiopian food but have a limited palate I'd recommend beef tibs and for those that want to try the hardcore traditional ethiopian food I'd recommend kitfo prepared rare. Sheba's can get packed on the weekend so make sure you book a reservation in advance. Enjoy!",

I've come several times to watch my friend's jazz band play--ECQ--they're great, contact me for bookings! Also catch them @ Bubble Lounge every Friday.  FOOD:~The vegetarian platter was so tasty &amp; not too heavy. Each &amp; everything was yummy, especially the salad (the dressing really wowed my mouth), with the bread rolls.  ~The steak tartare is so yummy &amp; unique &amp; different--I'm drooling just thinking of it.  DECOR: Uh...a little too faux for me. I guess one wall is a replica of the owner's church in Ethiopia, which is cool.  SERVICE: Ok.  BATHROOM: Ok. Cute funky sink in the hallway.

I've been told I clean up well... which alludes that I'm rather scrub-tastic otherwise?).  Sheba is an unassuming little location, comfortably seating/dining 50(ish), but roomy enough, with standing room for mingling and cocktails, to entertain large, casual groups...  The decor is warm and organic, modern in its accouterments of sleek black leather chairs, darkly tanned leather couches and Avant-Garde cocktail tables assembled in view of a glass-front fireplace. \u00a0Another lounge area is flanked by a centerpiece/dividing wall of architectural flourish reminiscent of 15th or 16th century Islamic influence. \u00a0Dining tables for small dining parties (2-6 people) occupy the remainder of the restaurant, with a full featured bar at one end, and a [Baby Grand?] piano at the other.  Gathering for a casual meet-and-greet, we indulged in a few appetizers and drinks while a pianist and a soprano saxophonist exhuberantly riff'd free form jazz in the corner...  - Spicy Lentil Sambussa w/ Tangy Dip - $ 6.00 - delicate pastry filled with lentils, scallions, ginger, garlic &amp; fresh chili  - Spicy Meatballs - $ 7.00 - coated w/ blue cheese  - Spicy Pomegranate Chicken Drummettes - $ 8.00 - \u00a0seasoned with an Ethiopian herb, Awaze sauce  The food was enticing and ventures into atypical/uncommon flavors (at least from my usual tasting experiences) and leaves a lasting/remarkable impression. \u00a0The \"spicyness\" of our appetizers was subtle and potent without being obnoxious or deriding from the tastes. \u00a0Quite a palate broadening experience...  The bar (...who,me? \u00a0drink?...) is fairly stocked and fairly priced, offering a wide array of wines, beers, and liquors. \u00a0I also had a chance to purvey a glass or two of Ethiopian Honey Wine... very nice finish.  All in all, Sheba is a great option as a jumping off point to start a weekend night roaming about Fillmore. __________________________________________ The tall, slinky waitress with the undeniable switch and sway in her walk... yum!",

The spongy bread is weird cause it has a weird texture, but I wanted to keep an open mind so I tasted it...not my favorite, but since Ethiopian food is not usually eaten with utensils, it really was my only option. I came with family so all of us eating with our fingers was not an issue but if I came with others who I weren't really close with, I think it would've been awkward.

This one though really earns my first review...so we wanted to go to a Jazz bar in Filmore, but since Yoshi's was so busy that night we walked around and ended up here...as soon as I walked in the restaurant, something smelled sooooo good!! mind you that I already had a full dinner just half an hour earlier, but the smell was sooo delicious that me and my boyfriend decided to order some appetizer to try out...we noticed that many table ordered some kind of appertizer plate, so we asked the server and got the vegetarian platter...OMG it was soo delicious seriously the food was soo good, there were 5 different things on the platter but everything was so tasty...I especially loved the pickle cabbage (I'm not sure if it's pickle but it tasted like it), there was lentil, and also collard greens, and some kind of red beans...anyway the food was sooo delicious and generous portion for cheap price...also the band was playing WHOLE night, by whole night I mean they play until 1am, very dedicated musicians, I can tell they just enjoy playing it for the crowd...I really enjoyed my first experience here, very pleased with the music and the food, and will come back soon to try other things on their menu and enjoy beautiful Jazz music...  P/s: even though the delicious smell was all over the place, and the restaurant/bar was relatively small, surprisingly when we got home, my hair and body didn't smell like food at all....they must have really good ventilator, which is a plus, since I don't really like smelling like food...",

So i did a bit of research here on yelp and stumbled accross this highly rated/reviewed jazz lounge.   We went on a Friday evening and found parking with ease. No cover charge which was a plus. Once we got in, we were so very lucky to find seats at the bar because it was packed. Its not a very big place but there are seats outside. I must say that I love the vibe here. Its predominantly an ethiopian restaurant and they play live music throughout the week at 9. We unfortunately didnt try their food. To be honest, they are very light handed when it comes to drinks.   Overall, i enjoyed myself and am very eager to come back and try their food. Update to come.",

I was able to reserve 2 comfy chairs which gave us the perfect view for when the Quartette came to play. Actually being able to reserve a couch like chair was so cool! Neither of us had ever been, but we had heard about it. Got there about an hour and a half before they played which was far too long, but for a Friday night it was barely packed. Didn't get crowded till 11ish. I have had Ethiopian food many times and agree with other reviewers that it's much pricier here than a standard Ethiopian restaurant, but this is not a standard Ethiopian restaurant. At a standard one you'd pay around $10 for a huge vegetarian combo platter and here it was around $14 for a smaller one, but still more than enough to fill two people up with all the Injera. All good and would order again. Also got the Sambussa's which were good, but not great and so hot that even at the very last bite we could barely put it in our mouths. I got a cocktail with Espresso liquor in it which was not good at all. Could only get thru half. My girl got a ginger infused one which she said was good. Wouldn't get a cocktail again, though. Service was very attentive till we needed our bill. Ambiance was awesome! Comfy, quaint, eclectic, and super jazzy. The music was perfect and we'd definitely go back. Don't let the cheesy neon light decorations outside the place deter you. This is a classy place and super romantic!",

Whoever did the interior design for this place nailed the ambiance and layout. Private dining area to the far right. Dark wood, rich fabrics, and huge plush chairs lead up to the bar in the back. If I had come here just to hang out and have a drink, I think I would have had a better experience.  I was pleased with half the dishes we ordered. Tasty, but nothing exceptional. Their Injera, that I usually love so much, felt very doughy and not light and tangy. I prefer it when the dishes are served right over the bread so that the flavors have been soaked into each bite. Because we were a big group, our baskets of bread emptied quickly. When bread is your main food utensil, you really need it!  What really ended my meal on a disappointed note was the live music. We left at 10:30 just when the Jazz trio was starting to unload their gear. If it's a Friday night, you're a lounge with a location directly across from Yoshi's, AND it's Jazz you're treating your customers to, you gotta step up the tempo! Not sure if it was the band's tardiness or if they were just booked that late, but it made me feel like I didn't get the real experience of the \"Lounge.\"  My suggestion, go for the drinks &amp; ambiance and go late!",

Being my first time eating Ethiopian food, she wasn't hesitant to bring out her sample plate, and show us \"how to properly eat Ethiopian!\" :)  We ordered their Beg Alecha and their Doro Wat (special), and were blown away by how good the food was. The lamb in the Beg Alecha wasn't tough, and was packed with flavor.  The Doro Wat special was like a combination of the Doro Tibs and Tibs Wat - with chicken being the meat of choice. The chicken was so tender, and was such a delight to eat.  My girlfriend ordered a Gojam cocktail, and I ordered the Abyssinia Storm cocktail. They were both really good. The Gojam was really smooth, and was well sweetened by the Ethiopian Tej (honey wine) The Abyssinia Storm was also well made, blending Myers Dark Rum with lime juice and ginger beer. Intense for some, but lovely with such flavorful dishes! ;)  To round off such a wonderful night, the jazz performers (Bohemian Knuckleboogie) were great! A lot of lively music and a fair amount of slow jazz, keeping the ambiance really intimate and special for those dining at Sheba. Definitely an amazing experience when your ears are delighted by an amalgamation of piano, cello, drums/bongos, and guitar.  Overall, definitely an experience worth trying. If I find myself in the area, I will definitely make my way here again!",

You can definitely find places in the East Bay and/or LA where you can get bigger portions for half the price and comparable quality.

Let's talk ambiance. \u00a0There is definitely a romantic vibe to Sheba's, but it's good for just grabbing some cocktails w/friends. \u00a0With a rotating calendar of local musicians, no night is every the same at Sheba's. \u00a0And I LOVE that Sheba's is in the Fillmore. \u00a0If you aren't hanging out in the Fillmore then get with the program. \u00a0Sheba's is only one of the many great places to see and be seen in the Fillmore - GET FAMILIAR.",

When we arrived, our friends had already been waiting for water. An hour after that, after reminding servers repeatedly, we still had no water. They finally told us they were out of glasses. There were empty seats - how few glasses could a restaurant own? Let me make a trip to the dollar store for you. Two rounds of drinks came, slowly, before we got water.   We had four people at two small tables, so we asked for two vegetarian sample platters, one for each table. What came was a good amount of food for one person on each \"platter.\" We assumed they would bring us enough food for four people, or at least ask us to clarify. I suppose that's mainly on us. The food was pretty good. The cabbage, potato, and carrot is always my favorite Ethiopian dish, and no disappointment here. Also, the staff was friendly. It was just the ridiculously long wait.",

    "review_text": "+ Cozy, dimly-lit &amp; relaxed atmosphere + Fireplace lounge area w/ couches + Delicious lamb &amp; kale dishes + Custom drinks from the bartender  I have been to here twice for dinner and once for after-dinner drinks. The dinner atmosphere is quiet and relaxed (read: no live music yet) and you can have a normal-voiced conversation and still be heard. Almost heard a little too well! The tables are spaced very closely, especially those along the wall. Our neighbors at the dinner table next to us could hear our every word and laughed at my best friend's claim that we will die in 20 years at the \"ripe old age \"of 45...  Right, the food..! We had the GOMEN (kale) and BEG ALECHA (spicy lamb stew) family style. Both were mighty tasty and my only complaint is that the portions seem small for the price ($8 and $15, respectively). They did present it quite well though - the lamb went in the middle of the injera (Ethiopian bread) platter and they separated the kale and side salads into two portions on either end of the plate. I appreciate that our waitress asked if we would like more injera (comes on another plate in rolls) when it looked like we were running low. I highly recommend the beg alecha. Well-seasoned, just the right amount of spicy, and tender, succulent lamb. Mm!  On a lounge + live music visit previously, the bartender on staff made me a custom grapefruit drink as I did not see any grapefruit-based drinks on the cocktail menu. If you're looking to drink something you don't see on the menu, just ask and they'll be able to whip something up just for you! I've also sampled the ETHIOPIAN \"TEJ\" HONEY WINE but I'm thinking this must be an acquired taste. It tasted a bit like whiskey with fermented honey and not something I'm accustomed to at all.   When the music starts, it gets loud! No more normal voices, you'll have to shout to get heard. But that's okay, the music makes up for it. Snag a spot on the couches by the fireplace and cozy up!",

You can't tell from the outside, but the inside is a warm, relaxing, awesome place that you would feel comfortable eating dinner and then just hanging out in.  At first I was disappointed because I was expecting lots of injera, eating with hands, and giant family-style platters (this has been my experience at all the other places I've been to). But because it's a lounge, the entrees are meant for 1 person, and they also serve stuff like burgers and pasta. We ended up ordering some drinks -- the waiter was really nice, and let my friend try the honey wine because she wasn't sure about it. For food, we ended up ordering:  1. Spicy Lentil Sambussa (7.50, 4 pieces): All the Sambussas are like eggrolls that come in a small bowl. They are really good, and easy enough to cut into 2 small pieces (which we did, so that everyone could try each).  2. Sirloin Sambussa (8.50, 4 pieces): This one was definitely my favorite -- so flavorful! 3. Mushroom Sambussa (8.50, 4 pieces): This one was a close second favorite -- very savory and delicious.  4. Vegetarian Sampler (14.75): Not sure what exactly was in this, but the lentils, greens, and yellow mash were fantastic!! Each pile was small, but it came on the \"family style Ethiopian platter,\" so that was nice. Definitely get this. 5. Doro tibs (15.00): The two \"tibs\" came in their own separate bowls, instead of on a family-style platter, which I was surprised by. It comes with a spoon, so you spoon it onto your own individual plate, where you can eat it with injera. I guess it's neater this way. It was good, but didn't stand out too much.  6. Lega tibs (15.00): This was very good! 7. Bonus: They gave us a free \"experimental\" chicken tibs entree! It tasted a lot like the Doro tibs to me, but we all enjoyed it!  Sadly we had to leave before the live music started at 9 PM. We walked out as the band was setting up, and they looked like they would be a lot of fun. The restaurant took a picture of us and put it on their Facebook, which was neat! We'll be back for sure!",

My first experience with Ethiopian food several years ago had me hugging the porcelain throne from both ends for hours. Can we say, skiiiiidmarks? Sorry, TMI. Needless to say, I shied away from Ethiopian food, Eritrean food, and anything of the like. Bubble guts are so not sexy...but Sheba Piano Lounge IS.   Opening in 2006 and with less than 300 reviews, Sheba Piano Lounge is probably one of the most undervisited places in San Francisco. Part bar, part restaurant, and part lounge, Sheba Piano Lounge is a perfect place to bring a date. The Mr. choose very well. Good boy.  Do note that there are only about 20-25 seats in the dining room (outdoor patio seating available). Also, the tables are very very close together so it's hard to hold a conversation without speaking over the people next to you. Reservations are recommended.   For those not familiar with Ethiopian cuisine, it's filled with bold, fragrant, and fiery spices. Most of the dishes are stew-like and are served over Injera, spongy bread made out of teff (high in protein and dietary fiber). Everything is meant to be eaten with your hands. Pull apart a piece of Injera to wrap up a small piece of meat or veggie and ENJOY! The friendly and knowledgeable staff is more than happy to make food recommendations and teach you how-to eat the Ethiopian dishes. \u00a0   I started with the Makeda Martini ($9) which was made with Hendricks, fresh cucumber and white grape juice. If you're a gin gal like myself, this is a must order for some sweet flirty giggles (I had two). For our app, we went with the Crab Sambussa ($8) which is like an Ethiopian egg roll. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TDG3DA5JtG3fdt4tqYJ94g?select=CoR0bdMH4iERrc-H2jsLUw#vVYQGSLOJ3l419Kv8A9jCQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/TDG3\u2026</a> The hefty cigars were very crunchy and generously filled with sweet tender crab meat and carrots and apples for an added crunch. As our entree, the Lega Tibs ($15) and Beg Alecha ($15.50) arrived atop Injera bread with salad (extra Injera bread was served on the side). <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TDG3DA5JtG3fdt4tqYJ94g?select=CoR0bdMH4iERrc-H2jsLUw#CoR0bdMH4iERrc-H2jsLUw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/TDG3\u2026</a> The Lega Tibs were tender beef strips simmered in Berbere sauce with a touch of purified butter for a layer of richness. The combo of chili peppers, garlic, ginger, basil, korarima (ginger family) and black pepper created a robust and fiery explosion in my mouth. Equally as good was the Beg Alecha, braised lamb in a green pepper and herb sauce with rosemary for a touch of earthiness. With each Injera stuffed morsel, make sure to include a salad leaf dressed with the tangy vinaigrette which offset the sourness of the bread perfectly. \u00a0  Our deliciously fiery dinner at Sheba definitely set the tone for the rest of the night. There were NO bubble guts so you know what that meant...SEXY TIME! (^ _~)  OTHER NOTES: *Most popular dishes are the Sambussa, Vegetarian Sampler, Wat and Tibs. *Level of spiciness can't be requested as the spice blends are already made. *Live jazz music starts at 9 PM. *Garage parking available at Club One garage several doors away for $3 the first hour and $1 for each additional hour.

We got the vegetarian sampler, the chicken (Doro Tibs I think), one of the beef dishes (TIbs Wat - didn't try it - I don't eat beef). the lentil samboosas, the spinach dip and the baklava. OMG the food is soooo good. My favorites were the Gomen - the collard greens veggie dish. It's usually my favorite and it was spiced perfectly. I also really liked the spinach dip and that surprised me. It's definitely not what I was expecting, but it has a little bit of a kick to it and it is way better than any of that americanized cream cheese spinach mess. The other highlight (not that there were any lowlights on the food front) was the baklava. Holy eff man. Served slightly warm and flavor was perfect.   So the food was totally five stars. The seating was not perfect though. We were seated at a low table with arm chairs around which made for a slightly awkward eating experience.

Because I've been to at least three places which were more authentic, cheaper and had what would compute as GOLIATH portions compared to Sheba. Restaurants that actually serve milk and honey.  Sheba is basically the equivalent of that fancy McDonalds in New York... knock off food and great atmo. However there is one big difference, unlike Mickey D's Sheba is crazy expensive.  My half of the bill was 14 bucks and seeing as I had 3 small meatballs and about 1/4 of the less than half of a fistful size of meat that made up the dish I'd say I was robbed. Had I not been on a date I probably would have announced WTF?  The waiter was polite and nice, and the food was tasty, but for what we received 30+ dollars was not worth it at all. The music was nice, the lounge comfortable... but seriously guys... it's a restaurant, you can't just jack up your food prices and lower your portion size to pay for the money you lose on atmosphere.   So if you're just in it for the atmo and drinks, I guess it's not a bad place to meet.",

The Oracle convention snarled up downtown traffic, so the Fillmore area seemed like a good meeting place. \u00a0It's well lit, nearby parking, good transit, lots of food options. \u00a0I wanted Ethiopian food (injera!!) and a relaxed place to gather, so I reserved a table at Sheba Piano Lounge.  We were the first ones there at 6:30, so we ordered drinks and appetizers. \u00a0 The decor is charming and relaxing, with textured walls in saturated colors. \u00a0Another reviewer called it \"friendly and seductive\", which is a pretty good way to describe it. \u00a0We monopolized the low-slung comfortable chairs in the lounge area near the fireplace while we waited for the rest of our group to arrive, . \u00a0  Drinks arrived quickly and were extremely tasty. \u00a0The appetizers took way longer than they should have--20 to 25 minutes. \u00a0But we really liked the meatballs and spicy fries once they arrived.   Once everyone had arrived, we moved to a table to eat more comfortably. \u00a0 Only caveat is that it was too dark to see our menus but my SO always has a flashlight with him! \u00a0We shared a family-style meal, passing all the dishes around. \u00a0Food was plentiful, tasty, and (because we asked for it) medium spicy. \u00a0Plenty of attention from the waiter, but not too much. \u00a0Everyone was full, full, full at the end, even my SO with the hollow leg. \u00a0  The owner stopped by to check on our meal. \u00a0After she heard that it was my birthday, I was surprised with some lovely cake to share and several renditions of Happy Birthday (including one from the band). \u00a0Awww! \u00a0I was really touched!! \u00a0Oh, yes, we loved the reggae-jazz band with steel drum.  Dinner for 6 with 2 appetizers, plus some wine, cocktails and drinks came to about $160 (including tax &amp; tip). \u00a0A bit of a splurge for us, but well worth it. \u00a0  Cons: Appetizers took long time to come; too dark to read menu.

    "review_text": "Before I proceed, this review is about a bartender at Sheba and does not reflect on the quality of food and/or the rest of the staff there (all of which has been quite good)!  TL;DR version: One of the bartenders (who has apparently has worked there for 4 years) is an overly-cocky, down-right unprofessional douchebag, who proceeded to mime masturbating and sucking a cock while mixing drinks with around 10-12 customers sitting right in front of him at the bar!  It was around 7:30PM on a saturday evening, and it was hard to get a table. So we decided to sit at the bar. We ordered drinks and food and were having a nice conversation, when I notice the bartender making drinks in an unusual manner. While shaking two drinks, the bartender decides to use them as props for his mime act in which he was masturbating and sucking a cock!  And it was a very open and obvious gesture, which he then proceeded to share with the other bartender, and then with the two waitresses by the kitchen window, picking up dishes to serve. Oh... and there were close to 10 people sitting at the bar and a few folks waiting behind them to order drinks as well.  I should have gotten up and left at that very point. But I decided to ignore it, which in retrospect was a very poor decision. I should have brought it to the attention of the owner/hostess, who happened to be busy at that time. But the rest of the staff, including the other bartender were quite aware of the antics of their colleague.  Our appetizers were brought out, and my friend asked for some silverware... to serve the sauce. Instead we were greeted with \"This is finger food. You eat it with your hands\", in a downright condescending tone. Yet again, I chose to remain silent and not try to spoil the mood.  Finally, when the food came, the same bartender decided to serve a couple of spoons of the Tega Wat on my plate. I politely said that I could serve myself, and that he didn't need to do so. He mentioned that it was his job to serve the food, at least 2 spoonfuls of it, otherwise he would get into trouble with the owner/hostess. I just let him serve me and proceed to start eating.  But even before I could have the first bite, I hear the voice of our good ol' cocky bartender directed at me saying \"I don't come down to your place of work and tell you how to do your job. Don't be telling me how to do mine!\"  At this point, I was furious. I should have thrown the food and drink in his face! I should have created a scene right there to call him out on his bullshit! But more civil minds prevailed and I told him that I wasn't telling him how to do his job. Rather I was telling him how I like to eat my food that I was paying for! We got our food to go, and obviously I left no tip for the service. I tried to find the hostess to report the issue, but couldn't see her around. So I decided to write my feedback on the check itself.  BOTTOM-LINE: I AM NEVER GOING BACK TO SHEBA PIANO LOUNGE AGAIN!",

I personally thought the drinks she, the bartender girl, Karina made us were delicious and just right, (and we are experienced SF cocktail drinkers and picky!) and she had a great personality and was extremely attentive to us the whole time we were there! 6 STARS FOR KARINA!  All I want is for this abuse and humiliation of her employee to STOP! NOW!  Or I will be taking further action to make sure she, the Ethiopian woman owner is investigated more thoroughly.  Otherwise, Jazz music, ambiance everything else, 5 stars. But treat your employees with some respect, humanity and compassion. and let them know when they are doing things GOOD and RIGHT.

In addition, unlike other restaurants, SHEBA LOUNGE will actually encourage your group NOT to sit at one of the FEW dinner tables, but inside eat dinner with your group on one of the many couches located throughout the joint.

The place is large, so feel free to come with many friends.  The server was very good at what she did.   I loved every bit of my foot and the music was excellent.  The only \"complaint\" (more that I felt bad for the band) was the light behind them that was faulty. It kept flickering, which annoyed them to no end. They kept their cool and kept rocking (it eventually worked properly.)  Thank you Nadja M for recommending this place. Cant wait to go back!",

I went here with a friend on a saturday night and we ordered lamb. it took us a REALLY long time to get the food and when it came the meat was grade D. My friend spit it out, and I thought it was okay, until a few bites later and got the worst cut of meat i've ever been served in a restaurant. it was 100% fatty and mostly tendons. The hostess asked us how things were going and when we said \"truthfully, dissatisfied\" she acted like she thought we were insulting her. I don't think many of the other customers noticed the bad food or service. it seemed like they were on first dates OR they had never had ethiopian before, as i saw that the waitress had to explain to people how to eat the food. they gave out forks and spoons, and i saw one guy spooning his dish into the bread.

The lighting was dim and I could barely see the menu or the people I sat with, and was also a bit disappointed that the tables weren't arranged so that the band was a focus. From my view, the piano was blocking all the band members - unfortunate. The music itself was beautiful, though.  We ordered a lamb dish, a veggie dish with collard greens, and baklava. The lamb was a bit too chunky to be eaten with your hands; it was also a bit tough. The collard greens with potatoes were delicious. Service was great, however.

Lalibela Church came up just short of making it onto the list of Seven World Wonders, but its magnificence is due to the fact that it was sculpted out of one rock - a major engineering feat in the 12th century.  And the Sheba Lounge has the essence of that special place. WIth its fireplace, sunken couches, fabulous cocktails, it is THE place to relax on a Friday night after work. And you can't beat the great tri-continental cuisine.  But the most wonderful thing about the Sheba Lounge is its owner - Netsanet - a queen herself! Netsanet lives to entertain and offer people a warm, relaxing, good time. I held my spouse's graduation party here and - if you want to be treated like royalty, have Netsanet cater your party.

Anyway, I called them the night before to ask what their cover charge was for New Year's Eve. The guy on the phone told me $20 for just drinks and music and $50 for their dinner set. Ok, a little more than last year but I still went. When I got there with my bf, cover charge was only $10. Great! But all their seats were reserved for either dinner or other guests and the hostess told us we can chill at the bar...but all the bar seats were filled so what do we do? Just stand around? They didn't really have a standing around atmosphere. The hostess did try to offer us many options, like seating us temporarily at the reserved spots until the people came, but I didn't want to have to get up once I got comfie, so we left. Met up with some friends then came back, but this time the hostess just gave us the reserved seats right away and told us she'd have the people who reserved the seats sit somewhere else when they came. Cool!   They had a really good blues band playing, but was A LOT louder than the band they had last year, so it was really hard to have conversations with people who weren't sitting right next to you. actually had a pretty nice server that night, but she dropped and broke a glass right in front of my friends and didn't bother sweeping it up (she just picked up the big pieces). She didn't apologize or ask if anyone got hurt (the glass actually did bounce and hit my friends. Thought that was a little irresponsible of her.   Later near the countdown they passed out party favors (hats, blowers, masks) and champagne. Wish they passed out the favors a little earlier so we could've played around with them and taken pictures a little more. They also gave out champagne.   All in all it was a fun night with great, but a little loud, music. They just didn't seem very prepared for the crowd and \"unexpected\" people who didn't have reservations.",

Either way, it was different but GOOD. The one thing I don't like about restaurants in LA is the cleasiness. I go in and feel like I need my dose of Purell. But Sheba Lounge was sooo clean and the style of the restaurant was quaint, comfy and chic. I was taken surprised and looking forward to trying the food. The service was great and quick! I was starving, so my friend and I stuffed the food down the minute it came. Delicious! The owner even came by to ask how we were enjoying the food. I like it when the owners ask and make sure their customers are happy. It shows some sense that they care about their business. So all and all, definitely a 4 stars. Maybe I'll up it to a 5 the second time I go and have more time to sample more dishes \u00a0and experience the lounge.",

The live music was supposed to start at 9 (according to the hostess), but I didn't get going until late 9ish-10. So my party and I only got to enjoy about 15 minutes of the piano. I was so disappointed when we were walking out, because they sounded so good.   The atmosphere is really nice and loungy--BUT the mood lighting made reading the menu a little more straining than usual. The food was okay. I order the tri-tip dish off of the Ethiopian menu. It was overcooked and not as tender as I would've liked. I paired it with the honey wine, which was oh-so tasty.   tips: Come for a late dinner to enjoy the live music. Consider sitting at the couches rather than the tables. Also, the place looked pretty packed when I left, so plan ahead and make reservations.",

The ambiance of the room definitely had a grown romantic type feel to it. It was a little dim in there(with an exception of \u00a0a candle at your table), but the decor was classy and it had a very cozy dark feeling to it in my opinion. I wouldn't say it's a five star restaurant, but be prepared to break your bank just a tad bit.   We ordered the \"Tibs wat\" which is a saut\u00e9ed prime beef simmered in berbere sauce with a touch of Nit'ir Kibe (Ethiopian purified butter), and also ordered the \"Yasa tibs\" which is a Saut\u00e9ed catfish marinated in white wine and cooked with Berbere, scallions and tomatoes. To top it off we ordered a few glasses of ethopian honey wine, which I truly enjoyed. It has a very sweet taste, similar to moscato i'd say. \u00a0Ethiopian food was definitely a new experience for me because they use a moist type of bread called \"Injera\" in which you add the meats and roll it into a shape of your preference to eat. I would much rather prefer using \"Naan\"(indian bread), but no complaints here. The elderly lady taking our order was very nice and was also very informative. My personal favorite would probably have to be the saut\u00e9ed catfish, it was delicious.   The live jazz band was definitely dope. They even did a Carlos Santana Cover and was very interactive with the crowd the whole time. Any thing with a saxophone get's play in my book (big Kenny G fan growing up!)",

After seeing great reviews on yelp and the live music, we were sold on Sheba. \u00a0We were all so impressed! The food is fantastic, so flavorful! I am very much of a eat meater but the vegetarian platter is delicious - the lentils are out of this world. \u00a0The jalapeno spiced dish (lamb) was a bit too spicy for me but all the other things we tried made us beg for more. \u00a0The appetizers were so, so good. \u00a0We tried the cheesecake brownie adn we loved it. \u00a0All of us gave their martinis an A+. \u00a0 The atmosphere is awesome with live music and loungy chairs. \u00a0The latin band was impressive! But I must say what really made it special was Chef  Netsanet - she explained the dishes and what the Ethiopean way of eating is. \u00a0She was very patient with all of our questions and treated us like family.  So, to summarize food is great, chef is helpful and attentive, the music is fantastic. \u00a0Is it perfect? No - the place is a bit cozy, tight and sodas are $4.00 with $1.50 refills. But I definitely will go back - but will stick to water, no sodas. \u00a0 Enjoy everyone!",

We made a reservation at 8pm, but got there a little late, the hostess had no problem accomodating us. \u00a0We were seated on some comfy couches by the fireplace when the lead singer of the jazz band started singing. \u00a0Hello?! \u00a0Wow, that lady has a soulful, sexy, and smooth voice. \u00a0  Dammit! \u00a0Love the coziness of the fireplace, but we can't see the band from where we are sitting, furthermore, the vocalist's mike was not turned up enough...I wasn't able to hear the lyrics clearly enough. \u00a0So I got up to stand in a more ideal location for a bit while we were waiting for the food so I could watch the band and the action. \u00a0They were really great.  We ordered family style and the Ethiopian entrees were quite good. \u00a0(I could have done without the appetizers, the teriyaki meatballs and french fries aren't very Ethiopian style). \u00a0After dinner we were full, warm and comfy, chilling by the fire and relaxing to the music. \u00a0Good times.  Then we had a cruise ship moment...This super old couple got up to dance and mack to the music, uh, thanks but no thanks. \u00a0That was the one wack moment of the nite.  All in all, the food was pretty good, but the atmosphere and music were tops! \u00a0A must visit if you want to have a chill and enjoyable evening, the Ethiopian food was a cherry on top. \u00a0We'll be back.",

But it was a date &amp; a special night, which calls for dessert even it's imperfect. I'll eat tiramisu from Walgreens mind you, but I was annoyed that they put something that wasn't at least a passable imitation on the menu.   And the incense was over whelming (at first). They seemed like they might have been getting ready for a busy night and we were there early. Maybe they burn it early and tapper it off when more people are there. \u00a0  There wasn't any of the live piano music going on, but Sheba still makes a great spot for an easy meal. \u00a0And it's among your best affordable, quick options before a show at the Fillmore.",

The decor is really nice and the lighting dim - just the way I like it. \u00a0Our server also ended up being the bartender/host too. \u00a0That man ran the whole place on his lonesome until about eight o;clock! \u00a0Talk about a one man show! \u00a0And he was good too! \u00a0We didn't have to wait that long for anything.  For food, we opted for the crab rolls, the rosemary and balsamic sea bass, and the doro tibbs. \u00a0All were super good! \u00a0And with our waiter/bartender/host/everything else under the sun, our cherry popping experience was amazing. \u00a0The only thing missing was for the guy to also start playing the piano and hopping back into the kitchen to cook our meal.

    "review_text": "I would have never imagined a Piano lounge to be the kinds to serve Ethiopian food! And well, I never thought a Piano lounge would play jazz and soul music. It is a very novel idea.  Located a block away from Dosa on Fillmore, Sheba isn't tough to miss. When you walk in, you are greeted by an ambiance that is both, romantic (if you are on a date) and upbeat (if you are out with your friends). We made a reservation for 6 on a Saturday evening and we ended up getting the \"quiet\" little corner by the fireplace near the entrance. The reason I said \"quiet\" is because it is far from quiet. Not an ideal location if you want to enjoy the music and a meal. The drums that beat are in your ears. Makes it tough for conversation. So I am guessing that a better spot in the lounge would be by the bar. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the music seems really loud for small interiors.  We ordered 2 plates of the spicy lentil sambusa and 3 vegetarian samplers with Injera bread. The food was really good. 5 stars! We also ordered a bottle of the honey wine for our table and relished it.  You will find potheads lurking by the bar! Or maybe it was just a one night thing.  I'll definitely be going back, this time, a little farther from the music :o)",

I didn't see the problem with her just relaxing with us since almost everyone got drinks and we got some shared appetizers.   Anyways, its over priced and the service is really aggressive. I would not suggest this place for anyone. Ugh  Also we showed up around 10:30-11pm because the live band was supposed to play until 12am. they ended a little before 11:30pm. If we knew that was the case, we would have avoided this whole situation.   *** The happy hour they have posted on yelp is not accurate.

I chose this place based on the proximity to The Independent which I visited Saturday night, and it's Yelp reviews. From the moment I walked in and was greeted by the gorgeous host (I think she may have been the owner because I saw her picture on a poster inside), not a lesbian, but she seriously was really beautiful, to the minimal wait for our food and the great live jazz I was highly impressed. AWESOME ambiance!   I decided, again based on a Yelp review and my love of blue cheese, to order the Meatballs covered in Blue Cheese as a starter.... ORGASMIC! I made my BF eat them s-l-o-w-l-y and kept telling him to \"Savor the flavor\" lol Then I ordered the Gomen, which is collard greens, also super delicious! It came with a small side salad and Injera (bread). My BF ordered the Tri Tip which he found ORGASMIC as well! I know this because he kept moaning with each bite, plus I kept stealing bites of his food. For drinks I tried the Honey Wine and the Suimui Rice Vodka Cosmo, both were REALLY good!   This place is a must for me! I have to make this part of my dining routine each month. The staff is friendly, the food is great, the ambiance is wonderful, what more could you ask for in a restaurant. 5 stars hands down!   NOTE: The prices on the website are not updated. Some meals are actually $2 more, so where it says $12.50 they were $14.50.   PARKING: I was unaware of this and wish I had know in advance so as not to waste time and gas looking for parking.

Rip a piece of Injera, scoop of some eats, and pop it your mouth. we devoured the dish and it was pretty huge. i think there should have been more spice with the chicken, but to be honest, now sure how hot i could have handled.  the only thing that i would have wanted different is the desserts. Now, I'm not going to lie, because the warm cheesecake brownie was DIVINE, but i would have liked to try some crazy Ethiopian dessert..something has to exist or be made up.   And this band, Bohemian Knuckleboogie, is awesome. They put their heart and soul into playing their music, and we felt like we were the only ones there.",

    "review_text": "WARNING: this review is based solely on the service. I did not get a chance to try the food.  My boyfriend and I wanted to do a date night and this place looked legit. I'm a fan of Ethiopian food and any restaurant that offers live music gets my attention. I was also excited about Sheba because of the reviews. So we made reservations for a Saturday night. When we arrived, we were seated at a table for 2. The tables were really close to one another but that was OK, the atmosphere and ambience were romantic and intimate. Our waiter handed us our menus and literally 2 min later, the host came to us and told us that there was a mistake, and we were actually supposed to be seated at a COMMUNAL TABLE near the piano.   My first thought: WTH??! Isn't it obvious that we are a couple and that we're not looking to share a table with another group (these 6 ladies were really nice though)? So they moved us to the table where there were 6 other women sitting and chatting up a storm. We were put on one side of the table. I was so mad and disappointed at this point. I'm all for \"the more, the merrier\" if I had a group of girlfriends with me but it was very clear that my boyfriend and I were not looking to buddy up with other patrons. We wanted to leave at that point but felt like it was wrong to do so after they seated us (don't know why we felt guilty--Sheba messed up, not us). We decided to order drinks and looked on Yelp for other restaurants nearby so we can have our dinner there.   So as a tip/warning to couples who are making reservations, please state it clearly that you will like your own table. I don't know any restaurant that will put a couple at a communal table. And if they were going to do so, please let us know beforehand so we can politely decline and leave before getting seated. Also, if you don't have a table for two, tell us when we are making the reservation so we know what to expect.  I'm giving Sheba two stars because the food that the women who we were sitting with smelled really good. I'm sure this place has impeccable food, just really bummed we weren't able to try it. I'm still contemplating whether or not to go back after this failed experience.",

Cool jazz, small venue and no entrance fee just order a couple of drinks and you're good. Shebas is Ethiopian owned it has a laid back vibe. \u00a0When you enter the band is right there. You can literally shake the band members hand as you walk in, a very nice welcome. We found a spot on a leather love seat, we ordered a glass of wine &amp; cocktail, service was fast. I wish restaurants as nice as Sheba would serve wine in a nice wine glass, not what was placed before us. They have a decent wine list and the stemware should reflect this. The excellent band (pianist playing a baby grand, bassist, sax, drummer) played two songs when we got there then took a break, but played again. I wanted to stay all nite but alas our suburban town was calling us, regretfully we had to go. I love this neighborhood, full of music venues and eateries that stay open late. Satisfaction!",

The savory raw meat combined with exotic blend of spices makes this dish so tasty, exotic, and delicious.  The sea bass special - The fish was so fresh; the meat almost melts like butter in your mouth. \u00a0Also the spices and sauces added a tasty and spicy dimension to the fish. Truly a fantastic dish that will awaken your taste buds.  Also on certain days, they have a live band playing jazz which is always a plus for me. A word of mention must be given to the manager; she is such a friendly and hospitable person; always treating me and the rest of my buds as if we were family!  So if you're in the mood for something more exotic and mouthwatering at the same time, I highly recommend this place.",

However, after this third experience, I don't think I would ever come back to Sheba's Piano lounge for anything other than dinner.  I can't tell if my palate has become more refined over the past year or if the standards of their kitchen and bar have gone down, but I was here with a group and tried 3 different drinks and 3 desserts and every single one was nasty. \u00a0I take no pleasure in ragging on them because the proprietor is a lovely lady and very accommodating in trying to get everyone seated and comfortable, but they really need to get a new bartender and dessert chef.  We tried the Sheba Cosmo, Harrar Cooler and Solomon's Julep and all the cocktails had this sickly-sweet, cough syrup flavour that made me nauseous after a couple sips. \u00a0My sister's Trumer Pilsner was fine, of course.  We also got dessert, to hedge our bets, and I was dismayed to find that the baklava was dry, the vanilla ice-cream with fried brioche had blatantly icy (not creamy) ice-cream, and when I bit into the fried brioche (which was basically crispy toast) I found a piece of plastic in there! \u00a0To their credit, they graciously replaced the dish with tiramisu, but that was not much better. \u00a0The tiramisu tasted like a clash of strong (again, nauseating) flavors rather than a smooth, creamy whole. \u00a0You'll usually find me licking the dessert plate but I ended up letting all three of these go to waste.  Based on these 6 samples, I cannot recommend any of the desserts or mixed drinks on their menu.  And finally, the live music (this is for the jazz trio that played last Saturday and I understand they're not the regular band) was nice and atmospheric, but not anything special. \u00a0My sister and I were thoroughly unimpressed as we have seen much better jazz performances even at her school's local dive. \u00a0I may not know much about music, but even I could discern that they were musically lazy, because for most of the performance it just sounded like the pianist + drums + bass were all playing repetitive background patterns and nobody was leading a melody. \u00a0Their one redeeming song was \"Summertime\", when they got a saxophonist (who joined only at the end of the set) to carry the melody.  Note to self: \u00a0If you ever do come back again, try to check that there's a good band playing, and only get dinner, beer or wine.",

I don't like ethiopian places that don't let you do a combination because they're quite boring, and this one was 100% boring.

She made a reservation for a large group (I think it was about 15 of us), so when we got there, there was already a very large table set up for us ready to go. There was a live jazz band performing in the restaurant which was wonderful! The atmosphere was beautiful, relaxed, and aesthetically pleasing. There were places you could lounge by the fireplace in a couch if you just came to enjoy the music and a drink, as well as plenty of table seating for dinner.   As guests from our group arrived, the bartender promptly brought over pitchers of water, and took our drink orders. It took a really long while for our waitress to finally come take our orders, but I'm assuming it's because she thought we'd want to relax and enjoy the music/company for a while.   My friends on my side of the table decided we'd all order something different and share, as none of us have ever had Ethiopian food before. I ordered the lega tibs which are pieces of wine-marinated sirloin with Ethiopian spices.  It took a very long time for our food to get out. The other half of our table received their food orders before our half did, which is understandable considering we were such a large group. It's hard to get all the dishes out at once. We waited about 10 minutes after they got theirs for ours to get there. I believe we waited about 45 minutes to an hour to get our food after ordering (again, understandable as we were such a large group).  Ingera is a very moist bread-like substance that Ethiopians use to eat their food (instead of utensils), so we were given a basket with that. I wasn't a huge fan of the moistness. My friends compared it to pancakes. You're supposed to pick up a portion of the dish with the ingera, roll up, and eat. It was a fun and different experience. My lega tibs were so delicious, and I'd say it was definitely my favorite out of all the dishes we ordered.  We ate everything, cleaned our plates, it was so tasty. I'd recommend doing the family style like my friends and I did so you can try a little bit of everything. I also recommend this place for large groups.

Don't bother if you're looking for a quick bite to eat, because the food does take some time to come out. However, if you've got great company it's worth the wait.   We had a party of six friends and started off with the sambussas (sirloin steak and spicy lentil) as our appetizers. These were my favorites with the tangy dipping sauce. We pretty much devoured these small plates collectively in less than 5 minutes.   I ordered some honey wine just to try, and it's definitely strong and sweet!  My friend and I split the vegetarian sampler. Netsanet (the executive chef) assisted with bringing out the food to us, so it was impressive to see the woman behind this Fillmore gem.   My only criticism: the restaurant was understaffed that night, because we had only one waitress who also worked the bar. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with the live jazz music (we had a pianist) and the fireplace. Great place to unwind at the end of a long day.",

With this said, I would not recommend coming here around opening time unless you really just want some Ethiopian food.

First off, there was no piano player. When we asked what time he/she might be coming in, we were told that the pianist had to go to a last minute wedding (?) and wouldn't be coming in. They couldn't get anyone else.  Also, the bartender left in the middle of dinner. He straight just waked out. That left our poor waitress manning the bar and trying to serve the entire restaurant on her own - the managers didn't even help her! Sufficeth to say, it took almost half an hour to get our bill after we asked for it, and then another 15 minutes to pass it off, and then another 15 minutes to get it back again, after being told we were given the wrong bill.  The food was good (though the beef dishes were dry), and we tried almost everything on the Ethiopian side of the menu. The Lega Tibs were great, and the spicy lentils wound up being my favorite. I was not a fan of the honey wine.   Bonus for them: they brought my lovely gf a free ice cream. Even still, we skipped dessert and rocked Miyako Old Fashioned Ice Cream across the way.",

Yes, that's right, it took us OVER AN HOUR to get two very simple plates of food -- a small plate of Yellow Peas and the Yasa Tibs. \u00a0  My girlfriend decides to ask the waitress if we can get a discount because having to wait that long for food is ridiculous. \u00a0She says she'll talk to the manager and she what she can do. \u00a0The manager a few minutes later strolls by and asks \"How's your food?\" -- we didn't realize she was the manager. \u00a0We found out only after the fact that that was how she decided to apologize and/or deal with the poor service. \u00a0  So we eat our food, which was OK but not spectacular, and are ready to pay the bill. \u00a0We ask again what they're going to do to compensate us for our time, patience, and the extremely slow service. \u00a0The waitress says that the manager has left to her other restaurant and unfortunately now there is nothing she can do except offer us some free dessert. \u00a0Wow. \u00a0We scoff at the entire ordeal in private but ask for the ice cream with fried brioche. \u00a0\"Oh, sorry we don't have the fried brioche right now, but I can give you just the ice cream\". \u00a0Double wow. \u00a0 We politely tell her thanks, but no thanks, and we'd still like the restaurant to do something about it.  The waitress comes back and apologizes, explaining it's a small restaurant and the kitchen got really backed up, and that she took the $4 cranberry juice off the bill as a gesture of sympathy towards us having to wait 70 minutes for food.  Other thoughts: \u00a0the jazz music was run of the mill and boring, not entertaining at all, and I do appreciate jazz.  On the way out, we saw the manager and realized that she was cowardly avoiding us. \u00a0  I have never had such a terrible restaurant experience in my entire life. \u00a0Sure, things could have been worse. \u00a0But the bottom line here is that, when things went bad, the restaurant EPICALLY FAILED to try and correct them. \u00a0They basically said sorry and gave us the finger.  Dirt poor service, pricey meals for mediocre serving, crowded, and cowardly are what I would use to describe this place, and I recommend you avoid it.",

    "review_text": "Thank the good Lord for this little gem of a restaurant!!! \u00a0  I can't believe that I was never exposed to Ethiopian cuisine until Valentine's Day 2009, when the bf had the awesome foresight to have us try something new together - and boy, are we glad we did. \u00a0Upon entering Sheba, we were greeted by a festively dressed server. \u00a0Since it was V-Day, she had a pink hearts theme going on, and it was really quite cute. \u00a0Typically this kind of thing is cheesy, but for some reason, it set an appropriate tone for the rest of the evening.  One note on the service here - our server was really nice and made sure our first time was enjoyable, and the owner even stopped by to chat us up. \u00a0I love when restaurants do this because it really makes you feel like they care about your dining experience. \u00a0The owner even went so far as to ask all the patrons whether they made sure they parked legally because she said she saw some cars getting ticketed outside. \u00a0What a sweet woman!  On to the meal: It being our first time dining a la Ethiopian, we asked for recommendations, and ended up ordering the pita crisps with spicy lentil dip ($5) to start [which was actually sort of lacking in flavor]. \u00a0Oh, but those entrees!!! \u00a0So delicious were the Doro Tibs - boneless pieces of chicken sauteed and seasoned with some type of Ethiopian herb, Awaze sauce, hot peppers and onions (an absolute STEAL at $12.50), and the Beg Alecha - tender pieces of lamb braised slowly in green pepper, flavored with that Ethiopian herb sauce, ginger, rosemary, and a little jalapeno pepper for spice (also at a very inexpensive $12, for sheer portion size). \u00a0This place is definitely for those who like to try exotic, spicy foods, and aren't afraid to get their hands a little dirty.  I LOVE that it's heresy to eat the above listed dishes with silverware - it's SO much fun and a little bit primal. \u00a0You use the Injera, or flat sponge bread that can be likened to a sourdough tortilla, to pick up the food. \u00a0All of the dishes we tried were scrumptious and literally finger-lickin' good!! \u00a0Also, I really appreciated the portion sizes -- I'm a big eater and I was perfectly STUFFED by the end of the meal. \u00a0I would recommend this place over and over again for its great service, reasonable price points, and very sexy ambiance. \u00a0Sure, it looks a little sketch from the outside, what with the neon sign and all, but I guarantee a very pleasant surprise waiting behind Sheba's welcoming doors.",

It can be quite loud at times and difficult to hear one another if you want to have an extended conversation. \u00a0Also, it's a small place, so the seating can be tight and even a bit difficult to find.

After a year or so, I felt it's only right to give Ethiopian cuisine a second chance but of course at a different restaurant. \u00a0I think it was last month or so when my boyfriend and I decided to try Sheba. \u00a0We ordered the vegetarian sampler and spicy fries to snack on. \u00a0OMGosh it was so delicious!!! \u00a0The injera was not sour and the spicy lentils were so good. \u00a0We also had some salad and the dressing was fabulous. \u00a0  If you're looking to try something new and don't want to be too adventurous give Sheba a try. \u00a0You won't regret it! \u00a0I will be back =)   Thanks Sheba for restoring my faith in trying new cuisine!",

Food-wise, you really can't compare this experience to anything else. \u00a0Last night we had the spicy lentil dip and sliders, coupled with a few glasses of wine. \u00a0The dip was phenomenal enough that we requested a spice list to make an attempt at our own personal rendition at home. \u00a0I doubt that will come anywhere close, but we just really want to be able to have it on a regular basis. \u00a0As far as the sliders go ... they were unbelievable. \u00a0The last time I was able to say that about 3 small meat patties was when Trevese was still open in Los Gatos. \u00a0And Sheba's are even better.  Impeccable service, wonderful ambience and fantastic food = memorably fun date night.",

There was a blues band playing and the intimate scene made the place very cozy. We only got drinks, but the people sitting near us got Ethiopian food, and my entire crowd looked at each other with enlarged eyes saying 'We've GOT to GET THAT next time!'.  Seriously, I didn't catch the name of the band that was playing, but they rocked it and the dim lights in the place definitely set the mood.  Very excited for this find, and can't wait to go back soon!  PS- I would say good for small groups but not a very large place, so if you want seats, recommend to go in packs of groups (no larger than 6 or so)",
