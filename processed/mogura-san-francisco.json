Standard Japo beers are on tap and they have a decent sake and shochu selection, if the latter is your thing. The bar food does the trick and enables patrons to quaff more. I especially liked the salmon chazuke and the takoyaki. I was warned against ika no shiokara, or fermented cuttlefish, but I still tried (a bit of) it. I don't suggest it. Don't by shy, come in and drink beer and sing a few karaoke songs.",

Sapporo &amp; Asahi on tap. A bunch of sake. Ochazuke &amp; takoyaki.   A couple hours here and you'll start to believe you're actually in Osaka. Here's some tips:  * Mogura is nestled in Club Maris - a Japanese-only hostess bar. I'm not sure if that rule extends to Mogura but I haven't heard any English while frequenting. * Be prepared to take your shoes off and potentially sit cross legged or on your heels. * Try the takoyaki! Osaka is known for it and Mogura gets pretty close. * Bring 3 or less people because there is only seating enough for about 15. * Don't be too loud or drunk, it's considered extremely rude and you will lose you're ability to return. Remember, this is an Osaka shochu bar not an Irish pub!",

Both of us never recalled seeing a bar in there so when we walked in, we looked at the directory and sure enough, it was upstairs. It's at the end of the hallway and it's very intimate. There were several people in there that turned out to be regulars. It's run by a petite Japanese woman and if I can recall, she mentioned that the bar had been there for about 7 years. It's not a full bar, but they have an odd selection of alcohol including sake. They also have some bar food if you feel like a snack. It's definitely a place to check out.",

It's the ultimate hidden secret in that it's almost impossible to find and it's likely the most authentic karaoke bar in the city. Just wander into the unmissable Japantown mall (next to the Sundance theater), take the stairs and hang an immediate right.   Once you walk in, you'll have to take off your shoes (don't worry, you can wear little bathroom slippers when you go to the bathroom), and rather than showcasing your pipes to a crowd full of drunks, you'll gather around the U-shaped bar and sing sitting. Festive, it's not, but if you bring a crowd it's unlikely to be packed (let the current 7 reviews be a testament to the popularity).  For those nights when you wanna sing sad songs or watch other people do the same, Mogura is tops.",

Once in, there is a long and huge stairway leading up to the bar, try not to scrape yourself on the thatched ceiling. Make sure to leave your shoes before stepping into the upstairs room. Sure it's a bar with a single TV screen and all these strangers can hear you sing, but they're all drunk and by the time someone suckers into you picking up the mike, you are too!

The BF was asking where I was going, to which I replied \"I don't know\" and kept walking down a brightly lit hallway. We passed a bathroom, and a kitchen, only to find a dimly lit bar!   The decor is very nice, and the bar area is intimate. I do enjoy the seating area (although I wish I could go into the couch area, not entirely sure how to become VIP enough for that.) The drinks are pretty simple, they have a limited menu with small appetizers. I have had the Ebi Shumai and the Fried Chicken so far, both are pretty great (ebi shumai is my favorite of the two though.P)   As far as drinks go, the Sake Wine is great. The Fuji Apple smells like a Jolly Rancher, and is about 3x sweeter than one, so if you are not a fan of super sweet drinks I would recommend going with the Lychee flavored one. The J-Pop drink is pretty good, it's a malt beverage that is very sweet. I got the grapefruit flavor, which was good until about 3/4ths of the way down; It was a little too sweet and became hard to stomach.   They play fun J-pop music while you are there, so far I have seen the same 2 videos play everytime I go in, so I can't say that they rotate the videos... but they are entertaining to watch. From what I have read, this place use to have karaoke, but lost their license or something.  Definitely stop by Mogura for a drink or two if you are in the Japantown mall, I am going to be bringing my friends here when they come to visit, just for the experience alone.",

In the J-town area, it's slightly better than- Dimples (no cigarette smoke, no Korean/Mongolian women in indentured servitude), Festa (no loud, drunk fools who can't sing to save their lives) or Ikkyu (drunk Japanese girl \"students\" who barely function as bartenders).  Understand, Mogura is not a dive, and Mari-san tries to make it nicer than the aforementioned establishments. Her small plates are meh, but be forewarned, all of the food is basically pre-cooked and microwaved/heated up. I think she serves up the food just to satisfy the licensing requirements for the place.  Drinks aren't exactly cheap, but then again, when compared to the aforementioned establishments, the cover charge seems like a good deal if you want a quiet drink.  So, if you want a quiet drink in a place hidden away from the raucous drunken wails emanating from Festa just down the hall or respite from the cigarette smoke at Dimples or the drunken servers at Ikkyu, go to Mogura.  One thing to remember, don't be surprised if there's an extra line item on your bill for a beer/drink that you didn't order. That's the price of admission if you have Mari-san \"entertain\" you with her witty conversation. Entertaining indeed.  Oh, and yes, for all you guys who have the fever for Japanese girls, you can go there to try out your lame pickup lines in Japanese. At least these girls might understand them because they won't be drunk.",
