For my jazz-themed birthday evening we had planned for cocktails at Yoshi's, but the bar was too packed with the wrong crowd so we decided to try the place next door, which was quieter with the more romantic mood we were looking for. Though only a few years old, it has a very old school vibe. We sat in the lounge decorated with portraits of the Fillmore during its jazz heyday, and I enjoyed the BEST Sazerac and then Manhattan I've EVER had! Very light and smooth, served up in martini glasses, unique presentation for these cocktails. We even saw Willie Brown there, but we see him at almost every swank joint we go to in San Francisco. This place does the neighborhood justice, and is at least as cool and comfy as Yoshi's (when it's not too crowded.) Cheers.",

    "review_text": "As sad as I am to give a two-star review, I cannot honestly give more than that because my fiance and I were both pretty disappointed with our experience. \u00a0We were so excited for dinner here, and we just did not leave satisfied with our dinner.  It started with us arriving 20 minutes early for our reservation and being told that we could sit at the bar and that happy hour was going on. \u00a0So we took seats at the bar and ordered a couple half-off appetizers: Maple Syrup Slow Braised Beef Short Rib \"Sliders\" and Black Skillet Fried Chicken Sticks. \u00a0They were both pretty tasty (and half off!), but sadly this was the highlight of the meal.  30 minutes passed and no one came to let us know that our seat was ready. \u00a0When we finally flagged down the hostess and asked if we could be seated, her response was that we could of course have gotten seated whenever we wanted to...then why didn't anyone tell us that? \u00a0But no big deal, off to dinner!  I was so excited for the cornbread everyone raves about, but we considered it dry and not very flavorful. \u00a0I'm so used to cornbread being moist and exploding with corn goodness, and this just was not.  As for the main event: - Fried Green Tomato Salad: Pretty tasty and unique, would recommend for an appetizer if you're a goat cheese fan like we are! - Barbecue Shrimp N' Creamy Grits: \u00a0This dish left a little to be desired. \u00a0The grits were heavy but not quite decadent as it was a little over-seasoned. \u00a0The shrimp were good but not great. \u00a0I didn't find myself gobbling this entire dish up like I usually do with shrimp and grits; instead we forced ourselves to finish at least all the shrimp so it didn't go to waste. - Barbecue ribs with White Truffle Macaroni N' Cheese (special): \u00a0The biggest disappointment of the night. \u00a0We were so excited for every aspect of this dish, but the ribs turned out to be SO DRY it was so so disappointing. \u00a0And the macaroni and cheese was once again heavy without being decadent, which is just so unfortunate. \u00a0You can barely taste the truffle because the bleu cheese is overpowering. \u00a0 - Garden Pea Asparagus Farro: Pretty good if you're a fan of farro. \u00a0Loved the cheesiness of the asiago and it complemented the mushroom, peas, and asparagus well. \u00a0  Overall, we left dinner feeling very disappointed and both agreeing that we would not return. \u00a0And the next day when we opened up our leftovers for lunch, we realized they gave us the wrong ones.  So as much as we wanted to love this place, we unfortunately just did not. \u00a0We expected a heavy meal with this kind of food, and no one appreciates a good artery-clogging meal more than we do, but the worst feeling is a heavy meal that wasn't worth it.",

Neat black and white photos in the room next to the bar, and an electronic picture frame of sorts above the bar itself, with rotating images.  Our server was young, seemingly inexperienced, and definitely nervous, but he mostly did a good job. Few service problems. Well, he did forget to charge us for a drink, but being honest sorts, we pointed this out. More of a bummer was that he forgot to give us our leftovers to go. Boo.  Love the cornbread triangles and their accompanying red pepper jelly (didn't care about the honey butter). We were convinced to order an appetizer because of the time it would take to prepare our beef short ribs and fried chicken, and we did enjoy our shared dish of BBQ shrimp and grits. Tons of fried chicken. The pieces of dark meat were perfectly moist, and the white meat was pretty moist, too, given how hard it can be to do right by that part of the bird. J. liked her short ribs, and my tastes of her food convinced me that the maple flavoring worked well with the meat. Our sides of braised greens and brussels sprouts had potential, but alas, both were slightly undercooked and shoud've been more tender. Too full for dessert!  I think 1300 on Fillmore would be a great place to go for an intimate dinner for two or a larger, group gathering. The ambience is wonderful, any way you slice it, and the food will please your palate and fill you up. Just make sure you have some moolah.",

I really appreciate that they're trying to bring fine dining to lower Fillmore (yeah, I just made up a new neighborhood), but it just feels a little forced.   It just feels a little uncomfortable to eat $25 fried chicken when the Popeye's around the corner is actually feeding most of the local residents for a fraction of the price. Another way of saying it is that I'd appreciate 1300 more if I felt like they were more of a reflection of the neighborhood than just serving soul food to transient outsiders.  I know that's hard criticism for a team that is probably trying to do well with what they've been given. I'm not trying to be mean-spirited; just hoping they'll embrace the neighborhood rather than stand apart from it.",

Then the food came. \u00a0Shrimp Hush puppies that were pretty OK. \u00a0I had the Bouillabaisse which i thought tasted awesome. \u00a0It had lobster, crab, scallops, mussels, and fish. \u00a0A little small on the portion size, but it was so tasty. \u00a0My friend had the rabbit. \u00a0She said it was a little dry, and i somewhat agreed. \u00a0And that was a really small portion as well. \u00a0  Dessert was so good though, that it made up for her meal. \u00a0The Warm chocolate beignets with chocolate dipping sauce melted in my mouth, not in my hand. \u00a0That was so good, that i almost melted.

I have to admit, I was skeptical when my husband told me he made reservations here for our one year wedding anniversary. Fancy soul food? How could it be.   Oh, but it was. Every morsel that was on my plate was simply delicious. I'll give you a play by play.   First off, instead of bread, they bring you corn bread. It was so perfectly warm and crumbly. When you add the honey butter to it, it was yummy. When you add the jalapeno pepper jelly to it, it was out of this world. If I could have bought that jelly to bring home, I would have in a heartbeat.   In order to try more dishes, we ordered 2 of the small plates a an entree to share. We started out with the shrimp hush puppies. Perfectly seasoned and fried. On our waiter's recommendation, we had the shrimp and grits too. The shrimp was very good, but it was the grits, a food I usually don't even like, that completely blew this dish out of the water. The grits were so creamy and light!   As our main dish, we had the full slab of ribs. Absolutely amazing. There are no other words to describe it. I've never had ribs that were so tender, so juicy, and so flavorful. The portion size was very generous too. And the meal got even better. The ribs came with a side of mac and cheese with truffle oil. Oh so good.   When it came time to think about dessert, I was already so full, but I knew I couldn't leave without trying one of their desserts. Again, on our waiter's recommendation, we tried the bread pudding. So yummy, which is huge for me to say because up until now, I never had a bread pudding that I liked.   The atmosphere was great, our server was one of the best I've ever had, and the food is just mind-blowingly good. You need to head there soon.",

The space - lighting, seating, colors, etc. is really beautiful and romantic. Although the service was slow throughout our meal, the food did start out promisingly. The corn bread was absolutely delicious - one of the best I've ever had. The truffle mac-n-cheese and the greens were outstanding as well. Too bad those sides turned out to be the highlights of our dinner. Husband ordered the roasted catfish with andouille. Good, but not great. Needed a bit more heat. I ordered the fried chicken. I appreciate \"upscale\" versions of down-home cooking, but sometimes, it's best to just not try so hard. The chicken is de-boned (wrong on so many levels...) and rolled in what I'm guessing is some sort of cracker mixture, which gave it a very heavy texture. Also, the chicken and/or the breading was not well-seasoned. Worst part? The thigh meat was not cooked through. I thought it might have been the dim lighting, but I stopped eating it and turned to the white meat (which looked fine under the lights.) Upon getting home, husband and I both agreed that my left-over thigh meat was very, very pink and definitely not cooked through. That's the way you guarantee that I won't be back.",

    "review_text": "What a great place to spend a laid back evening with a wonderful friend. \u00a0Highlights were the appetizer Hush Puppies with fresh water shrimp. \u00a0These were plump, juicy, tender, perfectly cooked shrimp in a cornmeal battered crisp coating, served with a seasoned remaulaide (sp?) dipping sauce. \u00a0Cornbread was delicious, especially with the accompanying jalapeno jelly. \u00a0I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the jelly, and we found it was even better when we dipped our hush puppies into it. \u00a0  The corn chowder was more like a sweet corn bisque, and arrived with a swirled pesto-flavored olive oil on top, in a \u00a0whimsical pattern. \u00a0My entree, part of the 3-course prix fix menu, was the beef \"briquette,\" which the waitress confirmed was actually brisket. \u00a0I was underwhelmed: The three slices were comprised of about 1/3 fat, which some people might enjoy but which I can't get rid of fast enough. \u00a0(I wish restaurants asked if you like or don't like this type of presentation -- I find it disgusting.) \u00a0The beef tasted kind of like it had been cooked a lot earlier, then reheated, and was quite dry and tough. \u00a0The sauce is served on the side, and is spicy and nice, but couldn't \u00a0quite add enough moisture to the over-dry beef. \u00a0It came with a small ramekin of macaroni and cheese, which was kind of spicy and quite delicious. \u00a0It also was supposed to come with cole slaw, but since I don't eat cabbage, they quite cheerfully substituted a ramekin of sauteed greens, which were okay, but kind of tough. \u00a0  My friend ordered the full rack of ribs, which were served with the mac and slaw. \u00a0The ribs were tender, perfectly cooked, moist, and delicious. \u00a0I like it that the sauce is on the side, because it allows us to add just the exact right amount each bite requires. \u00a0He also had the Little Gem Salad, which was garnished with pecans and corn bread croutons. \u00a0He said it was nice. \u00a0  We finished with desserts and couldn't quite decide on two, so ordered 3: \u00a0the pistachio creme brulee, which arrived garnished with fresh fruit and with two crescent cookies on the side. \u00a0This dish alone earned 5 stars. \u00a0My friend had the apple tart in caramel sauce with vanilla ice cream on the side. \u00a0Yummy, delicious, perfectly cooked and presented, another 5 star recipient. \u00a0The third choice was the house-made chocolate chip cookies, served with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. \u00a0Hmmm... I guess some people like cinnamon in their dry, fluffy chocolate chip cookies. \u00a0We both agreed that it overpowered the cookie, which we expected to be warm, chewy, and oozing melted chocolate chips, but which were served at room temp. \u00a0They'd get 2 stars from me. \u00a0  The ambiance is warm and welcoming, and all of our wait staff were friendly, and promptly responded to requests and queries. \u00a0I wish I could bestow 5 stars overall, but the brisket dropped the experience fully by one star. \u00a0My recommendation is that they rethink this menu item; watching the food being delivered to other tables, all the other entrees looked and smelled absolutely delicious. \u00a0  There is a convenient parking lot directly under the restaurant -- enter on Eddy street. \u00a0I just learned they have a Jazz Brunch each Sunday, and can't wait to return to give it a whirl!",

But they were willing to do it for me a la carte. No thank you. Why wasn't that written anywhere on the menu??? My boyfriend got the salmon and I got the catfish. I'm not gonna even bother look up their descriptions nor did I bother to remember. Both lacked flavor. It's so full of a restaurant to not put salt and pepper on the table, assuming that their food is flavorful enough that the patrons don't need it??? Well their food did and it took them about 8 minutes to find containers to put salt and pepper together to present to me. The service was sooo slow. Took 20 minutes just to get water and bread. The server was pleasant but never came around at all. I won't be back. I don't know why it's so packed. Waste of money.",

Overall, I would recommend the lounge for drink before/after dinner, especially if you get there early with a big group and can \"take over\" a section. \u00a0Dinner was disappointing and not recommended. \u00a0I think they are trying too hard to make southern food gourmet, and screwing i up in the process.",

Drinks were very well prepared. The main dining area is very attractive, although the bench seating had us leaning into the table to avoid lapping the foods.  We started with the delish corn bread. Immediately I knew the dollop of honey butter would not be enough and George was kind enough to up that supply.   The hush puppies were quite tasty and great on their own without the sauce.  We got the beef short rib, half rack of baby back ribs and, of course, the chicken.  Beef short ribs is actually pulled and when first came to the table made us slightly confused. Resembling a round chocolate torte with a single bone in the middle, topped withan eloquent onion ring, it took a few moments to figure the approach. Once we did we found it to be quite tasty.  The pork ribs: personally, I appreciate good ribs with no sauce. I'm glad I do since I was given about .5 oz of sauce on the side. The ribs themselves were smoked and baked... Very good in that fashion but I would be happy with well prepared baked ribs alone.  Last was the fried chicken. So I know this was supposed to be the pinnicale, but while it was good, I didn't seem to be on the band wagon. The coating was tasty in flavor and would have been great but it was ultimately too salty. And my expectations were for for more of a crispy crunchy texture. This was more like a well baked coffee cake topping in texture. The chicken meat itself was quite good and moist and flavorful.  I think the ratings would be more fair if the scale was to 10.. I would give a 7. The price was a little steep for the value, so makes it difficult to come here for something other than special occasions, but I would try it again.",

The stream of servers hustling past on either side made us feel a bit like a rock in a river. We were ignored for most of our meal, save for the passive recognition that constant chair-bumping provides. When we asked if we could perhaps shift the table a bit : \"Sorry, it's a walkway.\" True that.  You ever been at a party and have some guy start to make small talk with you -- and then you can see the moment five seconds later when he realizes he really doesn't give a wooly crap about your existence? As though talking to you was some kind of painful accident brought about by a brief moment of existential angst? Our server was kinda like that. Everyone else was nice though.  The food was passable as vaguely Soul, vaguely Low Country, vaguely Southern. I think the word \"refined\" misses the mark though; in most cases, it's a heap of food on a plate. (And some things are misnamed: breaded shrimp are not hush puppies, no matter the texture of the breading.) Admittedly it's a tough nut to crack, as \"soul food\" means a lot of things to a lot of people. All that said, the flavors and textures were generally good. And a little bit goes a long way. Dishes were heavy. Don't over-order. The shrimp and grits was a highlight; the soupy mac and tough, chewy \u00a0pork belly I could have done without.  Two drinks and six shared plates set us back almost $150 all in, which is steep for the quality of both food and service. For that kind of outlay there are better options in the neighborhood.",

Let me first start off by saying, the ambiance and decor in this place was EXCELLENT!!!!! I loved the low lights, the wonderful pictures all over the walls and the furniture. \u00a0  The customer service was GREAT!!!! I was seated quickly and was waited on very promptly. My waitress (BETH) was great with recommended the dishes she thought was a hit.  Ok now, let's get to the nitty gritty...the FOOD!!! First and foremost, I looked at the menu and thought I was missing some pages or thought I was given some kind of short menu. WRONG!!!! Where the heck is the rest of the menu is what I thought??? For this to be a \"soul food\" place it was surely missing out a lot of options.   In any case, my friends told me I must get the shrimp n' grits and I did just that...and a little more. LOLOL \u00a0For starters, the corn bread was great. \u00a0After seen these cute little triangular cut pieces of corn bread, I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore. \u00a0I definitely had in my head a different expectation of this food. I want soul food!!! Real soul food. \u00a0This on the other hand was like foo-foo soul food. You know that upscale soul food. \u00a0That soul food where they call it soul food but give it a what I call a \"money\" twist. \u00a0  The corn bread was just that. Foo-foo. \u00a0I mean don't get me wrong it was good but anyone could have made it. \u00a0And just because you offer corn bread with dinner doesn't make it soul food. \u00a0It came out with a honey butter that was good but of course, I wasn't tasting honey any where. LOL \u00a0It was also accompanied with some jalepeno jelly that wasn't my cup of tea. \u00a0  The shrimp n' grits came out and it was beautiful :) \u00a0I also ordered the Hush puppy shrimp. Mmm Mmm. \u00a0As you can see I was ready to get my shrimp on :) \u00a0One bit of the shrimp n' grits and I was wondering where the heck was the seasoning????? I mean grits with no flavor might as well had been cream of wheat. Nice decorated on the plate were the shrimp and they were very good. The gravy was mediocre and I was hoping the shrimp hush puppies would be better...NOT!!!! They too were seasonless and dry. Thank goodness I had some dipping sauce!  All in all, I was so disappointed that I didn't even want to try the dessert and wondered what all the hoop la was about.  Doubt I'll ever come here again :( This executive chef needs to visit Pican in Oakland or Farmer Brown's for some tips. SMDH...shameful!",

The Jazz inspired ambiance is sophisticated and the cocktail bar is perfect for waiting for your guests to arrive over a dirty martini.

Great corn bread with jalapeno butter. My favourite entree is the shortrib which is so tender it melts in your mouth!",

The kitchen finished our dinner 5 minutes before the show started. \u00a0I asked the waiter to hold the dinner for us so that we could return after the show, and suggested he work on a discount.  At midnight we returned to 1300 on Fillmore for our dinner. \u00a0The waiter was leaving and told us the manager had agreed to a gift certificate to ease the pain.  We were servered cold catfish in cardboard boxes. \u00a0 It had not been refrigerated to get cold instead put in the cardboard boxes two hours earlier and left to sit out and soak into the cardboard.  The manager was nowhere to be found. \u00a0We asked several waiters and were told she was busy in the back but that we should wait. \u00a0Finally I had to go into the back of the kitchen to find her hiding out.  My recommendation is to eat at Yoshis. \u00a0You will save yourself a lot of money, aggrivation and arrive to your show on time.  1300 Fillmore should have a sign on the door that says \"Please Wait Here\".",

Our table ordered the Fried Chicken, Braised Short Ribs, \u00a0the Crispy Salmon, and the Truffled Mac N Cheese. \u00a0The fried chicken was definitely overhyped to me as it was a little too dry. \u00a0However, the biscuits that came with it was the highlight of my meal. \u00a0They were so good! \u00a0The fried chicken dish can be easily shared. \u00a0My friend and I only ate half of our orders and took the other half home. \u00a0The short ribs were a hit at the table and the crispy salmon was just okay. \u00a0I wish the truffle mac n cheese had more of truffle kick to it (I love truffle!) so it tasted ordinary to me. The cornbread served at the beginning of the meal was very moist so I pretty much enjoyed their baked items. \u00a0We ended the night with the banana creme pie which we all thought was superb. \u00a0  I must say the service was superb. \u00a0Our server spent a lot of time with us recommending his favorite wine and dishes. \u00a0He really made our night more enjoyable.    Overall, glad I finally got a chance to try 1300. Might come back for happy hour one day but I feel like I've tried everything I'm supposed to here.",

I called around 4 pm and got a reservation for the same night at 7:30, nice. We were sat on time. Our waiter was young but very good and knowledgeable about the menu. The cocktails were great. The maitre'd helped me choose an exquisite glass of wine to go with my dinner. The food was lovely, not perfect but very good. We had the shrimp hush puppies, yum, the shrimp &amp; grits, divine, the bacon &amp; egg salad, the egg wasn't runny and the vinaigrette had a too much vinegar it overpower the velvet of the bacon fat, the little gem salad with green goddess dressing was wonderful, very garlicky, the rib eye was too tough to cut but it was so tasty I sucked on a few bites before sending it back, so we went with the short ribs and mashed potatoes, very tasty but a little dry. the banana cream pie was lovely and I don't even like cream pies, the chef had left some of the bananas in chunks which I thought was great for the texture and the lime caramel sauce was delish even though it didn't sound appealing. The check came with a charge for a surf turf we did not order! I hate when that happens and it becomes an issue we have to resolve. It always leaves the dinner on such a bad note to have to fix your bill no matter how good your meal is. Restaurants should have a policy to have their wait staff double check the bill before they present it so they can catch &amp; fix it before the customer has to deal with it. We really enjoyed the atmosphere, the decor, the location. We will be back.",

Our reservations were for 7:30 and we were promptly seated and greeted by our waitress, who was a doll. \u00a0To our disappointment, she informed us they were sold out of their short ribs - which I was anticipating and planned on ordering. \u00a0But no worries, my second choice was their organic fried chicken with beautiful, fluffy truffle mashed potatoes and I was indeed a fan. \u00a0My mother-in-law had the beef tenderloin, which was cooked to perfection. \u00a0My husband enjoyed his entree of grilled pork chop and my father-in-law had the halibut. \u00a0Everyone's dish was seasoned, cooked and plated beautifully.   The last and definitely not the least was our dessert which was their homemade beignets, served with a chocoate sauce and coffee soda. \u00a0This was probably the BEST beignets I've ever had. \u00a0They were light and airy and melted in your mouth.  I would recommend this spot for an intimate dining experience, where the ambience invites you to stay, the staff, Chef and wife team have created a memorable place to dine and left me and my family wanting to come back again and again.",

I want to tell you about the shrimp and grits; the anson mills white grits with grilled shrimp and I think some kind of aromatic oil on top. Eat those.  And I want to tell you about the braised short rib. It comes presented in a way that does not remotely resemble a short rib or any other rib-related cut of meat, and I'm not sure where that bone in the middle is from because it seems way to small to be a rib, and the idea of onion rings on top seems a little cheesy and pedestrian, but damn, you need to have this dish. it's kind of sweet, but not sweeter than beef should ever be, and it's so tender but not mushy at all, and you get the idea, you'll be talking about it a month or two months later just like I am.

He definitely added a good sizzle to the steak with his descriptions and knowledge of all the items. \u00a0We started with an appetizer of Fried Green tomatoes and \u00a0the Shrimp and grits. \u00a0Both we're fantastic. My only gripe was that there could have been more shrimp. \u00a0 For entree's she ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and I got the half-rack of ribs. I'm always suspect of the quantity/size of the half rack portion of the pork ribs. \u00a0But when they came out like a brontosaurus burger, I was relieved to only have ordered the half-rack. \u00a0Since I had some left-overs for the half-rack. Partly because I probably ate too much cornbread, which I devoured like it was my last meal. \u00a0The sauces (Mustard and BBQ) \u00a0were a great combination since they provided 2 distinct flavors for the ribs. \u00a0The ribs also had plenty of pork which is another plus. \u00a0 The wife enjoyed her fried chicken which was cooked perfectly. \u00a0  For dessert, \u00a0I \u00a0really wanted to go with the Bananna Cream Pie but had already over eaten so we decided to split the Beignets which was a perfect closer. \u00a0Great staff, great ambience and most importantly great food. \u00a0Higly recommend this place.",

I'll therefore refrain from discussing   - the gay sex I just had - the gay sex I plan to have - the gay sex I know you're having right now (HUH?!?)  I CAN SEE THE DISAPPOINTMENT ON YOUR FACES.   After drinking FAR TOO MANY Hangar Ones with cranberry juice at a party, I stumbled down Fillmore Street with a friend in a desperate search for a meal. \u00a0Fate -- or rather my hip friend -- brought us to 1300 Fillmore. \u00a0We were obviously without a reservation, yet we scored a great table in the lounge area -- in fact, I preferred the lounge to the dining room since we melted into the comfy leather armchairs there.   The space is spectacular: high ceilings, excellent lighting, lustrous and thick curtains partitioning the sizable dining and lounge areas, a \"heritage wall\" of lightboxed photos and video captures highlighting the cultural significance of the Fillmore.   The cornbread triangles with red pepper jelly were exquisitely hearty; the tourchon foie gras had a hint of gaminess (which I prefer) that contrasted well with the sweet huckleberry jam; the grits with truffle oil (!) were earthy, smooth and creamy; and the braised ham hock greens gave me a wide grin and a heart attack. \u00a0BUT LET ME TALK ABOUT THE FRIED CHICKEN. \u00a0My two boneless breasts were marvels of fleshy, moist meat enveloped in a crisp, thick batter surprisingly free from the oily burden one finds at lesser establishments. \u00a0And the biscuits that came with the chicken were fluffy and scented with chives and parsley.   The bill for three drinks, three appetizers, and two entrees came to around $65 per person without tax. \u00a0Definitely worth the momentary currency purge for a quality meal.  Basically, if you're like me and  - Love delicious, indulgent meals after drinking - Love a great plate of fried chicken - Love to be called \"nasty slut\" and \"dirty whore\" while having sex  Then head over to 1300 Fillmore**  **Okay, you should still visit if only two out of three apply to you.",

So what happened that I only gave the place 1 star you ask? \u00a0The food! \u00a02 of us had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and biscuits. \u00a0Pop Quiz hotshot: \u00a0Which was more dry, the chicken or the biscuit? \u00a0Toss up, they were both unbelievable dry! \u00a0To make matters worse, they don't add any green to this dinner, none, nada, zilch! \u00a0Are you kidding me? \u00a0I know fried chicken isn't health food, but come on, add some green beans to the plate! \u00a0We ordered a side of the brussell sprouts and they were the highlight of the night. \u00a0The other two entrees were fish and completely non-memorable.  I guess if I lived across the street from this place, and I had not eaten in 3 days and I really wanted to overpay for fried chicken I would be back. \u00a0Otherwise, you can keep it.",

Went here on a Sunday evening without a reservation and after a short stay in the swanky lounge, were ushered to an open table.   Having recently opened, you got the sense that everyone dining had a genuine excitement about the newness of it all, I know my friend and I did. It's definitely a swanky layout, with bold photos of the Fillmore area of old bedecking the walls throughout.  For dinner, I'd highly recommend the sauteed mushrooms to start with, perhaps the arugula salad to offer a healthier balance. While all the entrees looked and sounded good, my eyes and stomach fixated on their Fried Chicken, an entree that did not disappoint.   I'm excited for the one-two punch of 1300 and Yoshi's next door. A hot and happening jazz scene, fine cocktails (although my lime daiquiri could have been tarter) and a stylish crowd all sound promising.",

I asked the waiter if we could may more money to order off the regular menu. \u00a0Or could they just apply the cost of the certificate to our dinner...how could we work this out so they made money and we got to eat a meal we wanted. \u00a0He was nice and was sympathetic, especially since I said the mistake was mine. \u00a0He said he would ask the manager to step over.  She couldn't be bothered to talk to us and said via the waiter there was nothing she could do. \u00a0We would just have to eat the prix-fixe or throw it away (we paid $81 for it) and order off the menu. \u00a0So we ate the prix-fixe...or I should say we ordered it and took a few bites of what was not very good food.  The salad was very sweet and no where near as good as I could have made at home. \u00a0Minimal goat cheese. \u00a0The entree was really fatty and not well seasoned. \u00a0I skipped the dessert but my companion said it was not much to talk about.  The glass of wine that came with the meal was some brand I have never heard of. \u00a0We googled the wine and found the price was $2.81 for a 750 ml bottle. \u00a0You could have put it on pancakes. \u00a0We didn't drink that either.  So for the meal we paid for but didn't eat we were out over $100 by the time we tipped our nice guy waiter.  So fellow Yelpers. Yelp makes a killing off deals like this. \u00a0Apparently the restaurant sends the coupon to Yelp and is reimbursed a much smaller amount as yelp keeps a bunch of the money. \u00a0Yelp, you pretty much suck in my book and I will never again buy anything from you. \u00a0Ditto for this restaurant. \u00a0The only reason it got a second star was the waiter.",

Long story short, it was supposed to be a big group surprise but her boyfriend epic failed and totally brought her there before everyone arrived. Awkwardly said surprise as small groups made their way there... and...... took IG pictures together by the bar area. haha  Anyways. Let's begin shall we?   ~.:: Atmosphere ::.~  I walked in feeling like the Queen of England. Red carpets and camera flashing from every angle. Ok. Maybe not. But it was still super fancy. There were two big doors as you entered to the reception area. It was dimly lit and I felt like it was a whole Gatsby era kinda of feel. Decor was spot on and super classy. The seats were super comfy as we took over a section of the restaurant with the couches on one side of the table and chairs on the other.   ~.:: Food ::.~ First time having soul food I would say. But my roommate is from Louisiana so when he says its pretty good, I choose to believe him. Everything he liked, I shall label it... L APPROVED! (Louisiana approved). 1300 takes the traditional soul food and \"dresses it up\" and refines it to a super swanky dish.   Cornbread: complimentary! There are different types of cornbread and this happens to be a dry crumble of cornbread here. It went really well with the honey butter and the jalapeno jelly. It was a good use of the fruitiness of the jalapeno! I know it sounds super weird, but i promise u it's not spicy. It's really interesting. \u00a0Although I personally like the more moist type of cornbread, I understand there's different types of ways its made.  Barbecue shrimp n grits $15: an amazing mesh of ground corn slow cooked with barbecued shrimps laid on top. If i was a selfish person, I would have gobbled this whole, but I decided to be a nice friend and shared with everyone! And everyone liked it!

    "review_text": "1300 on Fillmore, located at 1300 Fillmore Street. I see what y'all did there, good job, guys.  Came here for a late-night classy dinner with a few friends. Immediately after entering the restaurant, you can hear the bustling of the restaurant crowd and the live jazz band in the back by the bar. Some of the walls are lined, ground to ceiling, with bottles of wine, all local/from California wine country. We decided on a couple bottles of the 2009 Meritage, from Sean Minor. Some people frown upon blended wines, but the Meritage was delicious and not too dry, so screw 'em. I don't profess to know much about wines, but if it tastes good, I'll drink it. Our waitress was very quick and had good recommendations.  Complimentary cornbread that came out was very good, and came with butter and jalape\u00f1o jelly. I was tempted to get the black skillet fried chicken, since it was one of their signature dishes, but given that I had eaten fried chicken earlier in the day, I reluctantly opted out. Instead, I ordered the pork \"porterhouse\", which was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I also tried the matchstick okra, which was like eating nori, but a bit more substantial. It lacked a bit of flavor, but with the aioli, the fried okra wasn't \u00a0too bad.  Prices are on the higher side, but given the ambiance and the good waitstaff, it's actually a decent value. I'll definitely be back if I'm feeling a classy dinner in SF.",

The decor was hip with upside down table lamps hanging from the ceiling and lampshades utilized as stage light cans. The the crowd was mostly 20-30 somethings. Unfortunately, the food was sorely lacking. We ordered the menu fixe, which was a southern style rack of lamb. I ordered mine medium, and my dinner partner ordered hers medium rare. My meat arrived shrunken and tough (about half the size of my dinner partner's). I tried hers and it was not very flavorful. Nothing else about the meal stood out to counter the dismal experience of the main course. The service was ok, but I was disenchanted after the waiter had raved about and recommended the special. \u00a0Not worth the price.",

    "review_text": "I went for Gospel brunch...5 of us. Overall, food &amp; service was good but other components were lacking.   Food:  Comp bread - mix of seasonal biscuits (strawberry), chive biscuits &amp; skillet cornbread. The cornbread was amazing - perfect texture &amp; taste. I wanted more. Strawberry biscuit was good, not too dense. Chive biscuit had flakes of chives all thru it so definitely a good flavor profile.   At the table: (2) fried chicken dishes, (1) savory brioche french toast with balsamic-glazed strawberries (very good - I had a small piece), (1) eggs benedict (my friend liked it) &amp; (1) smoked salmon on a cornmeal pancake (also good - I had a bite &amp; my friend liked it).  I had the fried chicken. Served on a large bed of mashed potatoes &amp; 2 chive biscuits. What's it missing? VEGGIES!! Instead of 2 carbs, 1 of them (preferrably the mash) should be substituted for collard greens or another southern veggie dish. The dish is not colorful - brown on white. The biscuits were good, I was not impressed with the mashed potatoes (creamy texture but no flavor). However, the fried chicken was amazing!! 4 small pieces, spiced &amp; breaded &amp; fried to a yummy heaven quality. I had leftovers - reheated &amp; cold - and it still was amazing! There is a spice mix they use in their breading that makes the chicken jump out in your mouth when you're chewing. Hard to describe unless you've had it, but worth trying. Not the KFC-type of spice that leaves you feeling sick (that could be the oil/nasty chicken/gross overall factor as well!).   Drinks - 1 mimosa (good), 1 hot tea &amp; 3 Pimosas. Pomegranate juice &amp; liquer mixed w/ sparkling wine &amp; refillable (!!!) for $12. Too sweet &amp; not enough alcohol for me. I had 2 glasses &amp; that was more than plenty to make me feel that my $12 was well spent. It's pre-mixed so the servers just go around refilling when your glass is 2/3 empty (so no way to get it topped off w/ extra sparkling wine).   Our server was very nice - Nikki. I'd request her again. The band was good - not a lot of \"Gospel\" music &amp; 1 singer who has a guest singer join him a few times (I think she sang 2 songs).   They sat us literally in front of the band which made conversation very hard &amp; I wasn't thrilled with the location. A table shouldn't be that close to music/loud speakers even if that means you take 6 less people 2x each Sunday (2 seatings - 1 at 11am &amp; 1 at 1pm). We had to shout to talk to each other, 1 of the girl's had her back to the band b/c it was a round table, &amp; it was awkward in my opinion - not a good ambience/atmosphere creation.   I'd go back to try a few other items on their dinner menu but I'm not running back...it's good but not great.",

    "review_text": "Apparently this place has been open for over a month, right across the street from my apartment. It's so subdued-looking from outside that I hadn't even noticed it - a large wooden door and an iron \"1300\" are all that you'll see from the street.   Finally, last night, the girlfriend and I decided to go check it out. And I have a feeling this is going to become one of our regular places.   The service was truly outstanding - it feels like everyone there is really tuned in to doing everything they can to take care of you. The slightest needful glimpse at any of the staff was instantly noticed and attended to. Our waiter (George?) offered fantastic recommendations and was purely, sincerely friendly far beyond the call of duty.  For starters, we got the braised pork belly and the shrimp \"hush puppies\". The pork belly was absolutely amazing ... melt-in-your-mouth luscious, with a sweet cherry glaze that left me wanting to sop up every last drop. The shrimp hush puppies I would have probably called \"fried shrimp\" - where I come from, hush puppies are a deep-fried ball of cornmeal batter. But whatever you call them, they were executed quite well, albeit not quite as memorably as the pork belly.  My girlfriend ordered the braised short ribs, and I got the skillet fried chicken. A few minutes after we placed our order, our waiter came back with an apology: Apparently the ribs were a popular item that night, and there was only one order left. And, would you please accept the chef's apology, but that last one simply isn't good enough to serve as your entree - it's all fallen off the bone and ugly. If you could make another selection, the chef would be most happy to provide, gratis, a sampling of the ribs you originally wanted; he's simply unwilling to give you a less-than-perfectly plated dinner.  Wow. Um, okay.  So she changed her order to the tenderloin filet, and when all was said and done we had THREE complete entrees on the table. The sample of the braised ribs was, indeed, falling off the bone - and just bursting with meaty deliciousness (and honestly, I think many other restaurants would have served that \"defective\" plate without hesitation. It looked pretty good to me.) The fried chicken definitely is worth all the fuss, tender and moist on the inside with a lightly spicy, crunchy crust that didn't have a hint of greasiness to it. And the tenderloin - if there are \"textbook examples\" at the school of culinary arts, this is the way you cook a tenderloin. A perfect crisp sear on the outside, medium rare and oh so tender inside.  My neighborhood is looking better every day.",

I was excited to check out this fairly new restaurant located next to Yoshi's in the Fillmore Heritage Center. (Best V-Day dinner so far was at Supperclub with Bebel Gilberto performing!)  The swinging live jazz band last night provided wonderful table-side entertainment throughout the evening. The chanteuse's voice was lovely, and the band even got the manager snapping his fingers as he came around to each table to check on how we were doing. The patrons were quite diverse, including the large party in the private dining area which looked like a distinguished bunch.  Our server, Ashley, was extremely sweet, and raved about the different selections on the menu as we enjoyed the warm cornbread triangles with jalepeno jam and butter. It made it so hard to decide whether to get the 4-course prix-fixe menu (special for Black History Month) or go a la carte. Actually, they prix-fixe menu was available a la carte, which is why it made the decision that much harder. In the end, we went with the regular menu. I got the Bourbon Braised Pork Belly with white bean puree to start, and the Fried Chicken with truffle whipped potatoes for my main entree. My valentine got the BBQ Shrimp with Creamy Grits as his appetizer, and the Maple Syrup Slow Braised Beef Short Ribs with crispy onion rings and buttermilk chive mashed potatoes for his main with a side of mac 'n cheese. Our appetizer selections filled our souls, but our entrees seemed to have missed the mark. Both the pork belly and bbq shrimp were delicious, but the goodness seemed to have hit a high note there and dropped way off when the entrees came out. My fried chicken (it seemed that every woman at neighboring tables ordered the fried chicken as well) looked way tastier than it actually was. There must have been some cumin or curry powder in the batter because I could have sworn it tasted like samosas. There was also something off about the flavor of the short ribs, however it was nice and \u00a0falling off the bone tender. The mac 'n cheese was more like a creamy pasta salad, and I would've preferred more melted cheese. I really wanted to like the rest of my meal, but I couldn't seem to stomach it.   The meal did manage to end on a high note, with the manager bringing over 4 chocolate covered strawberries for us to enjoy. We passed on dessert, which sounded good (chocolate beignets and banana cream pie - yum!), but my appetite was lost by then. The place's saving grace was the great ambiance and service. I'll definitely be back another time to skit-scat in the restaurant's swanky bar area.",

You know you're witnessing something different from the large, wooden door to the sleek bar and waiting area. This restaurant is always clean and service is always positive and not condescending, which I love. (Some restaurants assume that African Americans are unsophisticated customers and that we don't understand quality.)  This restaurant's bar selection is incredibly diverse and they understand premium spirits. (Anyone who understands the difference between Hendrick's Gin and Bombay Gin is alright with me.)  I'm really not into neo-soul food because it's usually hit-or-miss, but the majority of the items I ordered were passable. I hate catfish and I don't order fried chicken at a restaurant; however, the beef shortribs that I got were pretty tasty --though a bit overpriced. (And, no, I wouldn't pay the same price at other restaurants either.)  Absolutely hated their collard greens which I ordered as a side, but my understanding is that they may have switched those up. Mashed potatoes were incredible and their vegetables (other than greens) and desserts are outstanding.  It can be a bit of scene --like most places in the city nowadays-- but the staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.   Be sure to order a cocktail before your meal!  Parking sucks, but if you live in the city, just take a cab or hop on MUNI (22-Fillmore).",

The Sauteed Assorted Mushrooms were composed of chantrelles, beach and trumpet mixture seasoned with fresh herbs and butter. \u00a0The hominy grits with mascarpone cheese was not overwhelming creamy- it was \u00a0'perfect harmony'.  The Bourbon Braised Pork Belly arrived on a bed of whole white beans and its puree. \u00a0It was tender and flavorful; \u00a0its simple garnish with 'sprigs' of pork rind was not only crunchy goodness but D-E-L-C-I-O-U-S-L-Y \u00a0'legit'!   One of the main courses we selected was the Maple Syrup Slow Braised Beef Short Ribs- mouth watering bbq smell (hickory) and the dark color of sweet caramelized juices. \u00a0Its accompanying mashed potatoes was thickened in to a velvety smoothness that veloute' (fr)would be an appropriate description.   My quest to find the best fried chicken was not disappointed by the Southern Exposed Black Skillet Fried Organic Chicken. I think that this process of frying the chicken one side at a time \u00a0in a half \u00a0oil filled skillet ensured that the chicken was cooked JUST done- the result is the golden yellow pieces of medal worthy succulent fried chicken! The light spicy and earthy flavor from the herbs were just 'groovy' ! The rendition of mashed potatoes with truffle and pan grayvay was decadently pleasing- no 'vamp' needed here! \u00a0Here's the breakdown: FRIED CHICKEN- Crunchy gold coating 1-Taste/Flavor- 9/10  2-Tenderness/Succulence 9/10 3-Crunchy factor 9/10 4-Overall appeal 9/10  I'd give their fried chicken 9/10 and sits on the throne of my BEST FRIED CHICKEN LIST.  Antiqus Syrah 2004- lush ripe cherries and plums, just like a 'whole tone' in its sweet finish and balanced tannins that went well with the chicken and pork. \u00a0I passed on dessert but \u00a0will be back to delve into those treats.  PS- Like a young wine this restaurant will improve over time- Like they say in the jazz world- ' let' em stay in the woodshed' to grow in experience through practice. \u00a0I can't wait for the live music venues to start and will definitely be back for this occasion.",

My two friends had the fried chicken and it was also over-done but they struggled through a piece and left the rest.   My booking was at 845. We arrived at 815 and asked if we could be seated earlier if possible. At 920pm, we still weren't seated and it was only as we started walking out that they rushed to find us a table. I'm surprised it was so busy with such awful food, but perhaps they don't cater to the late tables very well.   I was also looking forward to the jazz band but alas, there was a function on so there was no jazz - not even a recording.   I definitely won't be visiting again and am a little embarrassed to choose this restaurant as my friends weren't impressed.",

This restaurant is a phenonmenal blend of class, jazz, San Fran history/culture coupled with the best gourmet southern cuisine I've ever eaten. \u00a0   I started with shrimp and grits as an appetizer and I knew, I had hit the jackpot. The grits were \"melt in your mouth\" good and the shrimp were done perfectly. My friend ordered the fried green tomatoes and honestly, she stopped talking after the first bite! \u00a0Based on our appetizer experience, our table decided to order several entrees so we could taste multiple entrees. \u00a0Great decision! We had the fried chicken (I'm still stunned that the chicken breast was fork tender AND well seasonsed), iron skillet salmon and shrimp hushpuppies. Every single entree we ordered was fabulous!!  Even though we all felt we were too full to take another bite, the dessert menu lured us into another \"group\" order. \u00a0The pineapple bread pudding was hands down the piece d'resistance. Honorable mention goes to the peach cobbler and banana cream pie but in my opinion, the bread pudding is the winner!!   Seriously. If you come to the Bay area and don't visit 1300 Fillmore - you've made a huge mistake",

The food is terrific! \u00a0I was introduced to the place by a friend and then went back again for dinner and cocktails with a couple of my girlfriends. One Sunday I went with my cousin to sit in the lounge and listen to the jazz trio and have cocktails and appetizers. Each time was a great experience.   I initially worked with Monetta , one of the owners, in putting together my dinner party. She was very helpful. One of my main concerns was being able to feed all my friends.....I ain't P.Diddy. (from what I hear P.Diddy ain't \u00a0got it like P.Diddy these days...) Anyway, I digress....Monetta suggested sit down dinner for family and a cocktail &amp; appetizers hour afterward for the larger group. That plan worked out perfectly.   We had a sit down dinner in the main restaurant area. They have a special section for parties that can accommodate about 20-22 people at the table . The area is especially nice because you can choose your level of privacy depending on whether you leave the glass doors open or closed. For complete privacy you can close the curtains as well.   I found the special events staff easy to work with. \u00a0 They have a list of items to choose from for your menu choices. I asked for something not on the list because mac n'cheese is my favorite and because I'm a diva like that...though, again, not P.Diddy...Not only did they accommodate my request I was also pleasantly surprised to see that they printed out a special menu for my birthday party and put on it that the mac n'cheese was my favorite! Too cute! The choices for my special menu were very well prepared. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Also, the dinner and the cocktail service was terrific. \u00a0We had the appetizers and cocktails in the lounge area. My friends had such a good time we stayed well after closing.   Besides all these wonderful things I think what impressed me the most was that the chef and owner came out to say hello to my family. For me, this kind of personal touch made the evening .  My party was in August but I am still hearing from everyone what a great time it was. A few have already went back for dinner and/or cocktails. I took this long to write a review because I am usually very critical. I wanted to be sure that my initial impression was correct and would the memory fade to a just \"ok\" experience. Needless to say, I am still very pleased with 1300. I'm thinking of turning 40 again next year just to do it all over again! ;)",

Tried a friend's fried chicken and ordered the short ribs myself. Both were delicious and very generously proportioned. Well worth the 7-8 \u00a0adjectives used in the title.

And we ended our meal with some tasty beignets, the coffee cream thing they give you with it is absolutely HEAVEN, especially for a coffee lover.

    "review_text": "After another failed attempt at being a 'walk-in' at 'State Bird Provisions', and being too lazy to wait. (Some day I WILL eat there! ARGH!), we saw this near parking and decided to check it out.  I didn't have any time to Yelp this place before hand. \u00a0I'm such a risk taker! \u00a0After eating here, it is safe to say that on the 'Roulette of Dining', the ball landed in black (I always bet black)  I was quite interested to see that this was a 'higher quality' take on southern classics. \u00a0This style of food has been quite popular in the Dallas dining scene recently, but I haven't seen it so much in the Bay area, but then again, SF has so many more options, I just haven't been looking that hard.  It wasn't quite as good as the stuff I've had in Dallas, but I understand the circumstances for choosing this restaurant would be completely different than if I was in Dallas, after all, Southern food ain't exactly native to San Francisco (or maybe it is, I never took San Francisco history in school).  The service was nice, and as par the course for this style of food, it is priced higher than southern comfort food normally is, but it is priced around normal for the San Francisco 'nicer dining' scene. \u00a0'Tis good for those who want southern foods in the comforts of a nice atmosphere with good booze. \u00a0If you just want southern food, there are cheaper and better options.  The long bench seating was really fluffy and comfortable. \u00a0Fluffy!  Food: -Corn Bread &amp; Fixin's: \u00a0Good corn bread and good stuff to go with it. \u00a0Honey Butter |Delicious| \u00a0Sweet Chili Sauce \u00a0|Delicious| \u00a0Getting a second plate &amp; cups of stuff |Delicious|.  -Oysters: Have you had raw oysters before? \u00a0These prolly taste similar. \u00a0  -Sea &amp; Swine: Pork Belly, Scallops, Braised Cabbage. \u00a0One of those simple dishes composed of multiple elements that I am a great fan of. \u00a0I loved it by default, but I wouldn't really say any aspect of it made it some sorta spectacular experience. \u00a0I would, however, order it every time I'm here. \u00a0How can you go wrong with pork belly?  -Ribeye: High quality beef. \u00a0Meat itself had good beefy flavor, good tenderness, and despite being a ribeye, all the served weight was in meat, no fat caps. \u00a0Oddly, the ribeye was 'double cut' for a super thick steak, reminiscent of a filet mignon, instead of going wide like most ribeyes. \u00a0Unfortunately, the initial steak was overcooked, so it another steak had to be cooked for us.  -Smoked Baby Back Ribs with Jalape\u00f1o Cole Slaw: \u00a0'Twas a special, but I believe it is almost always available. \u00a0How tricky. \u00a0As a special, we didn't know the price and had no expectations for the portion. \u00a0Apparently, it comes with a full rack of baby backs (for me, apparently that is 13.5 ribs[one of 'em was tiny]). \u00a0Unexpectedly staring down so many ribs was quite the surprise. \u00a0This isn't a barbecue joint, so you gotta keep your expectations in check. \u00a0Served dry with the sauces on the side. \u00a0A very minimal smokiness to 'em, no bark. \u00a0However, tender and not overcooked to 'falling off the bone' mush. \u00a0Quite satisfactory, especially for a non-'que joint. \u00a0The tomato based sauce was too sweet. \u00a0The mustard based sauce was almost straight yellow mustard, not reminiscent of any South Carolina Mustard Sauces I am familiar with. \u00a0The Cole Slaw was nice enough. \u00a0Ultimately, food overdose for me! \u00a0Be prepared for lots of food if you get this.  -Truffle Mac N' Cheese: Fancy restaurant making Mac N' Cheese? \u00a0Using Truffle oil? \u00a0Using multiple types of cheeses? \u00a0How unimaginative. \u00a0(Yes, I still ordered it! \u00a0I'm such a hypocrite!) \u00a0 Once I was past my lamenting, it was still an interesting take on Mac N' Cheese. \u00a0Not much truffle oil because of : Bleu Cheese! \u00a0Bleu Cheese overpowered the other flavors for my tasting abilities. \u00a0Not a bad thing in my mind. \u00a0I don't normally think of bleu cheese being melty, so having a gooey cheesy mess tasting of delightful bleu cheese(mmmm, Glutamate, Take that Parmesan!)  -Braised Green with Ham Hock: \u00a0This was a very traditional dish. \u00a0Greasy Greens with Ham Hock. \u00a0No attempts to fancify. \u00a0Why mess with a classic huh? \u00a0Anyways. \u00a0This is how I convinced myself my meal was healthy. \u00a0Any thoughts to the contrary will be denied by me, it is green! \u00a0Green is healthy!  -Bourbon Pecan Pie: Classic southern dessert! \u00a0Pecan Pie with Vanilla Ice Cream. \u00a0Not much to say.  -Apple Crumble: \u00a0Like an 'Apple Pot Pie'. \u00a0Apple crumble on bottom, pastry crust covering, vanilla Ice Cream on Top. \u00a0Desserts here seemed pretty standard.  -Wine List: \u00a0A reasonably sized selection, not tiny, but not massive either. \u00a0It does cover a good price range from 'reasonable' to 'expensive'. \u00a0Good selections on there as well. \u00a0Wine enthusiasts I was with were impressed with some choices and pricing.  ----[Shrimp Crusted Catfish]: I did not actually try this, but it sounds neat! \u00a0Shrimp Crust! SHRIMP! CRUST! ___________  Conclusion:  Southern Food without leaving the comforts of San Francisco, 'fine dining service' and quality booze.",

Chose this place to celebrate my brother's birthday. \u00a0Reasonable prices in a somewhat upscale atmosphere, so I thought why not? \u00a0Plus, all the yelp reviews were decent.  Ambiance/atmosphere: \u00a0slightly old fashioned, warm colors, no white tablecloths, and STUFFY.  Food: \u00a0mediocre. \u00a0Rib-eye steak lacked flavor. \u00a0My supposed medium-rare steak was mildly pink in the middle and was tough. \u00a0Short-ribs were tender and flavorful. \u00a0When I asked my friend how her fried chicken was, she responded with, \"It's ok.\" \u00a0Mac n cheese had no real truffle flavor- there was only a very subtle hint. \u00a0Spiced fat fries were basically fat (large) fries that were underwhelming. Honestly, I would prefer red robin's bottomless steak fries! \u00a0The side of greens was tasty, though. Overall, I'd recommend the short ribs and greens. \u00a0Their complimentary corn bread was delicious too.  Service: \u00a0very, very underwhelming. \u00a0I asked the waiter if the restaurant did anything special for birthdays. \u00a0You know, maybe a small dessert, candle on a cake- just something to make the dinner a little nicer since it's a special occasion. \u00a0He replied with, \"I can do a little chicken dance for you!\" and thus he proceeded to do his chicken dance... Not exactly what I was looking for. \u00a0Well, we didn't get any candle on a small piece of dessert, but we did get a 5 second chicken dance. \u00a0I guess that will do.  I was sad at that part because even a cheap sushi restaurant would give a small scoop of ice cream. \u00a0Even if it's not an award winning dessert, it's a nice gesture to show appreciation to your patrons for choosing your restaurant to celebrate a special occasion.  Oh, and he didn't even wish my brother a happy birthday...   I will have to choose another place to celebrate next time!",

I miss my Grandma Sadie, and when I sat down to dine at 1300, she was right there with me.  My GF and I ordered BBQ shrimp with creamy grits and the foie gras to start with which were both fantastic.

Another HUGE plus for 1330 was the diversity of patrons; I looked around the dining room and saw San Francisco--not all white, not all black, not all Asian, not all male or female, but the city, and I truly enjoyed that.

The ribeye is tiny : High quality cut of beef no doubt, but a tiny portion more similar to a filet mignon than ribeye. Wouldn't even be an issue if they printed how many ounces the steak is on the menu, but since they don't - it's a bit of a disappointment.   2. Communal dishes are pretty small : The Bourbon-Hickory Smoked Duck Sausage &amp; Duck Egg was incredible, but hardly a dish large enough to be shared.   3. Fried Chicken was So-So : I've had much better, and I've had much worse. I found the dish to be a bit try. But the chive herb biscuits were to die for.  4. Pan Roasted Brussels Sprouts &amp; White Truffle Macaroni N' Cheese were amazing. Crispy and creamy respectively.   5.

The price isn't so bad, its actually affordable for a fine dining place! And the food is great, Ahh, i can't believe i forgot our server's name, my intent was to write a gracious review about him. I think his name may have been George?  George, is it you? Or maybe it started with a B. Whatever, he was amazing! He made great recommendations for the boyfriend and I. Thanks so much for an amazing experience!   What we ordered: APP &amp; DRINKS: - BBQ Shrimp and Creamy Grits ---- The fluffiest grits! - Honey Sweet Iced Tea  ENTREES: 1: Black Skillet Fried Chicken -- Yes, everyone says this is gooood and it is. 2: Black Skillet Roasted Catfish -- THE BEST CATFISH I EVER TASTED, and its NOT deep-fried?!  DESSERT: 1. Warm Chocolate Beignets -- we wanted this with something cold, so our server gave us a scoop of ice cream on the side! Plus you dunk it in chocolate or the coffee sauce, its a piece of heaven.  The food is so great here. Plus, the decor and ambiance are also awesome! I mean, they have the picture frame wall (COOOL) and table lamps hanging upside down as ceiling lamps, pretttyy crafty!)",

I went with Brynn C. and between the 2 of us we had pretty much everything on the menu.   The grilled pear salad was good, but I would stick with the butternut squash soup with cr\u00e8me fraiche. The catfish is simply delicious- perfectly spiced with equally delish risotto. The fried chicken was moist, crispy and not greasy at all. For dessert we had the trio sorbet and the apple cobbler. The sorbet was light and refreshing after such a big meal. The apple cobbler tasted like something my southern grandma would make- not to be confused with a Paula Dean rendition- this cobbler was sweet and simple.   I'd also recommend the feisty blood orange cocktail- it starts off sweet with a kick of jalapeno at the end.",

Sea &amp; Swine Whiskey Smoked Pork Belly, Bay Scallops Braised Cabbage, Mustard Gastrique-Just a piece of each, but the pork belly was so tender. I love the smoky flavor of the pork. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the cabbage was very good. Super small, but this is a must get.  Barbecue Shrimp N' Grits-One of the house specials. Has a good amount of heat to it. Love it.   House Made BBQ Potato Chips, Pickles-super tender and flavorful. The chips were addicting.   Blistered Shishito Peppers Yuzu Lime Juice, Sea Salt-one of my favorite dishes. Was good, but a little more salt would have been better  White Truffle Macaroni N' Cheese Smoked Gouda, White Cheddar, Bleu Cheese-I could really taste the blue cheese, even though the waiter said it was very little.

It seems like most of the two person tables are on the side and in busy locations. Service was pretty lackluster; it seemed like we didn't have a specific hostess for our table.  I started with the butternut squash soup and it was very bland, probably the dish I liked the least. I also shared the ham hock and veggies dish and mac and cheese dish: both were excellent. My entree was the ribeye, tasty but maybe a little overdone. Desert was delicious: the beignets and the chocolate pot de cr\u00e9me were perfect.  Overall, a bit too expensive for something a bit too average. I'd go back for brunch but probably not dinner again.",

Why am I almost done with my meal by the time the band is setting up? Oh, and speaking of music, where was the live jazz?

I ordered the special that night, a full rack of ribs. The ribs were incredibly meaty, moist and tender. I would have liked more smoke in the meat but that is because I love anything slightly burnt. The portion was huge and it came with a crunchy elegant cole slaw. \"Elegant\" isn't a word I would normally associate with cole slaw but the knife work and light dressing were more sophisticated than you will find in your KFC.   We shared the pistachio creme brulee and found it difficult to taste the \"pistachio\" part of the dessert. However, the spiced crescent cookies were quite tasty.",

So I can understand that their primary focus is their bar and their extensive wine list. That said, they do have soul food staples as a nod to the now gentrified and whitewashed Neighborhood that was once primarily inhabited by black folk.   The food is good, but not outstanding. Its upscale peasant food, but without the 'peasant' flavor. The seasonings are either muted, or heavy handed. I got the Pork, and it was so salty that I was begging for water after the first bite. The service, well it was a bit slow, but I'm willing to bet that it was due more to the fact that it was a rainy and early Sunday night, so they had understaffed. Regardless, the kitchen was not with it at all, sending out dishes at different times, so that one of our guests got her dish after everyone else had already finished.   This is the second time I've been there, and although I want to rep and say that this place is great... its just ok. Summing it up, if given a choice between here and Gussies (just catty corner to 1300) I'd probably go to Gussies, just off of of GP if for no other reason that Gussies has the same quality of food, but slightly tastier, and without all the pretense for less money.",

However, KFC is not what I would call an innovator of food, or chicken.  So when 1300 prides itself on having some of the best chicken, guess how surprised I was to find a half a chicken on my plate, without any bones! Was this chicken born without bones?! In some ways, this makes it a bit convenient to not have to fight with my food, but at the same time, this was like eating a whole plate of white breast meat. The meat gets dry without the bone, and it all just gets less interesting.   Perhaps this is 1300 being innovative and putting a spin on a traditional dish, but I felt this was at the detriment to the plate.  Garlic shrimp and grits and their fries were nice though.

I had the signature \"free\" drink of the night here, 1 sip only to taste, but still memorable, 4 stars for originality in presentation with a red little piece of pepper floating around the top.  The atmosphere was great, the jazz band playing was ON. A little Mediterranean or Cuban flavor thrown in, can't quite tell the cultural origin exactly, but a little beyond the traditional blues.

    "review_text": "I've experienced better is an understatement. My sister ordered a dirty martini. It was great. 2nd time around, that same dirty martini tasted SUPER fruity. Dirty shakers = sucky drinks. 4 Re-tries later it still was a fruity-dirty-dirty martini. Our waiter was no where to be seen. It was only after the the manager came to our table and explained how there was an explosive fire, a party of 15, and more than 5 other tables to be fed, we still did not understand why it took over an hour and a half (not exaggerating). The salad on the fixed menu was the best thing besides the wine. But how could one mess up a salad or a glass of wine, exactly. You can't! The fried chicken was basically a waste of a chicken, I've seriously had better fried chicken at fast food take outs. \u00a0Don't order the vegetarian acorn squash, it's basically a mix of barley and squash puree, nothing like the description on the menu. There was no music for the first two hours and after that, just sort of came and went as the band kept repeating sound checks. Probably one of the worst meals in San Fran, and such a disappointment. When the chefs were stressed and tickets came in too fast, they couldn't handle it, and the food reflected their inability to stay focused, have a good service from all the staff members, and most importantly make food that is worth the hefty price tags. I wouldn't come back and I wouldn't recommend either. I'll go back to Nopa, at least their food is worth the price and wait. Make reservations because it's impossible to get tables without, especially on the weekends.",

    "review_text": "Goodness. Gracious. I had no idea this restaurant was tucked just south of Geary. It's in a very busy but unassuming corner and you can see great big lettering for \"1300\" by the street. I've passed this location countless times and always thought it stood for a condo or a movie thing. Not a gorgeous warm decadent Southern-style restaurant with class!  We arrived early and hung out in the waiting room (which was HUGE with generously sized leather sofas and armchairs and coffee tables everywhere) where we could order drinks and appetizers. Delicious! We had beef spare rib sliders that came with homemade ketchup and not-yet-fully-grounded mustard seeds (delicious!) as well as the wild mushroom grits. I've never had grits before. My mouth dropped at how delicious the grits were! AHHHH! The pomegranate mojito was superb! Minty with real mint leaves and dashes of grapefruit juice to punch up the sweet pomegranate. Oh so good! I was very happily buzzed a third of a way through my mojito.   Later on, we were seated at a real table and the decor in the dining room is just as lush as the waiting room, but in a different way. They had cool vintage-inspired mega-sized lanterns lining the ceiling of the dining room. Wood panels everywhere but glass windows within the room to give it space. All the waiters were just so wonderful. Service is top notch. Waiters and manager and hostess working together for busy crowds. We ordered one prix fix meal and a side because I was just stuffed from the appetizers. Had their butternut squash soup which was cozy and warm to the tongue. There was a dollop of sour cream in the middle which was fun! Then we had the catfish with dirty risotto. FLAVOR COMBUSTION of the best of soul food! I like catfish but many places treat it as if it should be dunked in piping hot spices and fried. Here, they are generous with their spices but they clearly picked certain kinds of spices that would still let the flavor of the catfish shine through. It wasn't too spicy but it had a healthy kick that went away quickly as the fish melts in your mouth. It was a very earthy sort of flavor. So good! And well complemented with the dirty rice which had bits of sausages and veggies in it and was well cooked like risotto should be.  The side of greens with ham and caramelized onions was CRAZY delicious! I think they were collard greens but they had the consistency of spinach (that's how tender they were!) and the flavor was just ripe with the bits of ham they put in there and the caramelized onions lended just enough sweetness to balance the whole dish. It was SO GOOD! Who could imagine a side of green could be so damned good!  I about tossed my napkin in defeat from being so stuffed. But then the apple cobbler came and it was like AGH! The apple cobbler was hoomemade with real cobbler on top of super fresh apples. This is an upscale dessert where they don't pour tons of sugar like other places do. They want the apple to be the star. It is tart though. Nothing their vanilla ice cream can't handle ;-) and it was just the right touch to end a lovely meal! Thank you 1300 On Fillmore! I'm so bringing my friends here for happy hour and good times! Great place for a romantic date!",

And this time I agreed with him.  Just for clarification, the dishes tasted fine and venue was lovely.  DECOR/AMBIANCE: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1300-on-fillmore-san-francisco#v3HsDIloyFxl2L_b9TBvYA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1300\u2026</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1300-on-fillmore-san-francisco#JDahBYrbYEMCOYtFHHp4-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1300\u2026</a> The dark chocolate tones, dark leather seats and understated elegant tapestries provided a handsome space. It was contrasted by the more relaxed sexy lounge with black and white photos covering walls on the other bar side of the restaurant. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1300-on-fillmore-san-francisco#SoQCSLX86ghtFB-SAH8j1w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1300\u2026</a> 1300 On Fillmore is big with high ceilings and spacious with well-thought of partitioned dining spaces for groups. The ambiance was elegant, mostly older set (50's, 60s) \u00a0but not stuffy.  DRINKS/FOOD: JAZZBERRY MARTINI $12 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1300-on-fillmore-san-francisco#ZcYtpuGuJ84aAvgESg88AA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1300\u2026</a> *Sugar-rimmed glass held a tangy drink that to me, tasted like cough syrup. I did not like it.  CORN BREAD W/ CHILE DIP AND BUTTER <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1300-on-fillmore-san-francisco#Q1QJmaL6vIdZtpCM6gPEuA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1300\u2026</a> *Provided instead of bread. \u00a0The cornbread was fresh, sweet and fluffy but fell apart so badly that I had to use a knife and fork to eat this bread. The chile sauce was sweet and nice. Overall the cornbread was nothing special.  DUNGENESS CRAB AVOCADO SALAD $12 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1300-on-fillmore-san-francisco#DEQ8tgNEY0d88hhFBlUiMQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1300\u2026</a> *A little mound of very fresh salad with stingy portions of crab flesh over arugula and avocado sauce. Would have been a lovely salad if a little bit more was provided.   BAKED OYSTERS W/ CAJUN HAM &amp; TABASCO HOLLANDAISE $15 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1300-on-fillmore-san-francisco#BSSF5h2UYGtCPfEf5vZW5Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1300\u2026</a> *I was not expecting these oysters to be generously served in cream sauce but I actually like them. Although I could not taste the oysters because the sauce overpowered the meat, I found it very tasty with the flavors of bacon. My guy found it too creamy.   PAN ROASTED COLUMBO SPICED DIVERS SCALLOPS $27 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1300-on-fillmore-san-francisco#seKFSWm6eVX5nSNd2wkPBQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1300\u2026</a> *3 very fresh and plump scallops but once again overpowered by the sweetness of the spices. They actually tasted like they were panfried in brown sugar although the description says red wine and star anise. I liked this dish minus the unnecessary extra sweetness.  GRILLED RIBEYE STEAK W/ CARAMELIZED ONIONS, YAMS, SWISS CHARD AND FRIED OYSTERS $30 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1300-on-fillmore-san-francisco#dvyeaThBZgdutoYngLr7Qg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1300\u2026</a> *My guy's dish. He does not remember the fried oysters and reported that overall the steak was good, tender and flavorful.   VERDICT: Our meal at 1300 On Fillmore ranks as our most unsatisfying meal in a while. \u00a0We do not argue that the ingredients were very fresh and the dishes themselves were well-executed for the most part. \u00a0The decor and ambiance were lovely. The servers were efficient and professional.   Our biggest complaints have something to do with the portions and price point. \u00a0We do not mind paying generously for a nice meal but we also expect to be fed well, \u00a0leave the restaurant filled and satisfied even if our wallets are lighter at the end of dinner. ~$9 a piece for scallops? A little mound of ribeye for $30? \u00a0A little anthill \u00a0of \u00a0crab flakes over greens albeit fresh for $12?  I get that creativity, culinary genius and love went into each dish and they \u00a0did not go unnoticed. But the \u00a0bottomline was when we left we had to eat again right after we left 1300 On Fillmore.   At the risk of sounding unsavory and cheap, (but it is our pocketbook and appetites we are talking about here, anyway, so no apologies...) \u00a0we eat out often enough to know that we did not get our money's worth at this place. And I have been accused of having an appetite of a little bird. My guy's a different story but still.....  TOTAL: $125 including tip  (And a beer, coke and basket of kettle chips with dips at Sundance Kabuki next door right after dinner before watching \"Olympus Has Fallen\".)  My guy said \"It was not for nothing. It was still a nice date night.\" And it was.",

Come to think of it, I might just take a bucket of the Colonel's best over the chicken here, but that's what I get when I go into a place with super high expectations (damn you, Yelpers!). The shrimp and grits were great, on par with what The Village Pub in Woodside offers at their Sunday brunch, and the husband really enjoyed his coffee braised short ribs--but nothing special. Our peach cobbler was fantastic, a really delightful way to end the evening, and their coffee is top notch. Overall, I'm more likely to do this again if I get another Blackboard Eats code. ;-)",

I liked the chicken and ribs, but it wasn't anything to \"ooo\" or \"aww\" over. Chicken liver pate to start with was decent, but the candied bacon tasted like dried out bacon (Sad because I love my pate AND bacon).  + Dessert - Loved, loved the cobbler. yum yum, want more of this!

    "review_text": "Wanted to take my gf out to a nice dinner and after a long process of elimination we opted for here.   Although it's not in the best of neighborhoods (I could walk down the street and buy some rock if I wanted to), at least the city is trying to clean up and revive that area.   Upon entering through two huge doors, you emerge into the small lobby area where the host/ess does their thing. The restaurant is dimly lit w/a unique lighting style and lots of black. There's a lounge area and a decent sized bar too. We started w/a few drinks; martini, hurricane, and some cognac sidecars. They pour a pretty decent drink by the way.   After about a 30 minute wait we were finally seated, I would've preferred not to be near the entrance, but oh well. The place was packed so I guess we got lucky only waiting for half an hour. We ordered the Fresh Water Shrimp Hush-puppies to start off with. Before the appetizer came the runner brought out some fresh cornbread w/honey butter and jalapeno jelly. I know knew that we were gonna be stuffed before this meal was done. Bread was soft and delicious, and the jalapeno jelly really balanced the sweetness of the cornbread. The hush-puppies finally came and WOW! I was expecting the typical deep fried hush-puppies in the shape of a ball. These were HUGE tail-on shrimp dipped in batter and then fried. The flavor and texture was almost indescribable!   Then the main dishes finally arrived. I had ordered the Black Skillet Fried Chicken and my gf had the House Brined Grilled Pork Chop. Holy crap that was alot of food! My chicken came w/whipped potatoes and some baked rolls on the side. The chicken while being boneless still had the skin on and was covered in a dark golden brown batter. It was super juicy and loaded with flavor. My gf's pork chop was almost the size of a turkey leg! J/K Anyways, it was one of the best pork-chops I've seen or tasted in my life. The meat was so tender that you didn't need a knife to cut it. Amazing flavors rushed through your mouth upon chewing the succulent meat.   An absolutely great meal. It was so much food though I had to take some home, which isn't a bad thing. Fried chicken for breakfast, yay! 1300 on Fillmore has a new fan in SF.",

    "review_text": "Well we did it, Gospel Brunch on Sunday, regardless of all the grumpy Yelpers who didn't enjoy it! Well thanks to your cantankerous reviews, it seems they have indeed gotten rid of the $40 prix fix. Thanks, guys!  This was my 2nd visit to 1300 but my first during the daylight hours. The first visit was delightful (sorry, I neglected to write a review probably thanks to their delicious cocktails) and I was anxious to try out this Gospel Brunch after reading the write up in the Chron.  We made a reservation for the 11am seating but it wasn't full so that may not be necessary for you. The booth seats alongside the wall are covered in super soft leather that made me feel like I was in a classy lounge. The decor overall is pretty classy, dressed in dark colors.  I was nervous about the service due to previous reviews but we had George and he was so lovely! Very warm and friendly right off the bat, give that guy a raise!  They brought out complimentary scones and cornbread with delicious pepper jelly. There was both a savory and sweet scone; I definitely preferred the savory scone. With lots of pepper jelly. Did I mention that jelly yet? We also ordered a regular old Mimosa and Boo had a Bloody Mary ($9). The Mary was a little bit on the watery side for me but it was quite spicy. The mimosa was your typical Mimosa except it was $8.  Our mains were the Fried Chicken ($18) which came with 2 more savory scones and whipped mashed potatoes. The chicken was boneless which was surprising and put it into a different category than my usuals. There was one breast piece with 2 smaller dark pieces. The meat was moist and the coating was flavorful. Boo had the 1300 on Fillmore ($14) which was scrambled eggs (a little on the weak side), 2 chicken apple sausage (hot), 2 bacon (alright), bread not toasted (ugh but did come with pear jelly) and the grits. Was entirely TOO stuffed for dessert... glad they don't make you get it anymore.  Can I give the grits its own paragraph?! Holy crap, definitely the star of the show! They were super creamy, great texture, savory and SO SO SO delicious. Order a side for $5 and get a big bowl of it. YUM.  The music! I think I was expecting something a bit more raucous but they were still great. They sang such favorites as What's Going On, Imagine, that Norah Jones song, Lean on Me, and some church-y songs. The female vocalist was WOW and the male vocalist worked the crowd in a fun way. I tried to look freaked out so they wouldn't come over to me, ha ha.  The prices were a little bit steep but being that the food was good, I wasn't as incensed as other people. Maybe if the food had been crappy I'd been a lot angrier because really, $18 for fried chicken is pretty atrocious. However, I acknowledge that I was also paying for the atmosphere and the fact I probably won't be coming very often.  $70 for the two of us for everything above which still puts us $5 under the original prix fix. Next time I'll probably skip the cocktails (although there's something special about having alcohol with your bacon) and I think you can get it down to about $25/person.  Overall, a fun and interesting experience! There is a place in Anaheim that does something similar except they have a choir, can you imagine?! The food was good, the service was great, and company unparalleled :) Try it out if you don't mind splurging for a birthday/special event and it'll be great!",

The Sazerac ranks three on my Bay area list, next to the Razz Room and Absinthe but I thought the mint julep was almost on a par with Churchill Downs!  We had crab cakes in the lounge, prior to dinner - not bad but, also, not the best I've eaten. \u00a0We ordered a huge meal and shared everything -  again, some dishes were superb, some didn't appeal to me at all. \u00a0 I was very disappointed in the bourbon braised pork belly - the sauce was good but I've never had a fattier piece of meat. \u00a0The barbecue shrimp in creamy grits \u00a0were scrumptious - should have gotten double of \u00a0those!  For my entree, I chose the braised short ribs and buttermilk chive mashed potatoes, a definite comfort food - I was soothed all the way down to my hips which I am sure gained another two inches. \u00a0I tasted my friend's fried chicken...not quite as good as my grandma used to make.. but pretty close!  We shared macaroni and cheese ( good ), greens ( uhhhhmmmm! ) and fried okra ( I was most disappointed - way too much corn meal breading so I hardly tasted the okra - I'm the rare person who likes okra, slime and all! ).

True enough, the classy and dimly-lit atmosphere of 1300 on Fillmore makes it a great place to grab a drink or chow down on some serious Southern-inspired cooking.  Of course we had to get the fried chicken and the short ribs... and because we were going to wait 20 minutes, might as well try the poached egg and chicken livers dish. And I can't really pass up a chance to get some good pork belly, either. While you can't really argue anything but the chicken livers are straight-up Southern cooking, that doesn't change the fact that both apps were straight-up pretty great.  The short ribs were fork tender, but at the sacrifice of a little bit of juiciness. They were overshadowed by the blue cheese grits atop which they sat, and the sharp, SHARP blue cheese, gave a nice counterpoint to the creamy grits and the sweetness of the ribs. Those are what I'll remember most.  I grabbed a bite of one of my fellow diners' fried chicken. While they were a little ho-hum on the dish, I don't think they realized the technical prowess that goes into deboning an entire piece of chicken, nor the near-impossible combination of skin that was crispy and absolutely in no way greasy. Seasoned rather traditionally, I would order this dish my first time here and then move on to more interesting plates on the menu. Or order it to split with someone else - there's plenty enough for two.  By and large, 1300 can provide some great dishes, though sometimes you'll have to wait for the privilege. In a space like this, having a little extra time to kill isn't necessarily a bad thing.",

My two are not fast food types and a school lunch send shivers up their spines. \u00a0We started on the appetizer page and ordered the shrimp n grits, braised pork bellies, &amp; \u00a0sauteed wild mushroom. \u00a0ALL were given the thumbs up by the kids, but the pork bellies were the all around winner. \u00a0As my son put it, \"It just disappears in your mouth!\" \u00a0As for the rest of the meal(I had porkchops and the kids shared the bass, cuz they were out of the all time favorite fried chicken) \u00a0Reaction was still the same, every bite just as scrumptious as the first and the kids cleaned their plates w/out complaint. \u00a0We all decided we didnt have room for dessert. Chef David came out to the table and was not to busy to talk with the children to see if they were enjoying themselves. \u00a0They explained it was ALL GREAT and they were too full for dessert. \u00a0It was almost magical the way not one BUT two desserts promptly hit our table...one being the heavenly beignets and that darn calorie inflating bread pudding. \u00a0Did they last? \u00a0Of course not. \u00a0\"We had a little more room left\" my daughter commented.  I have been back several times w/out the children and it has been incredible every time. \u00a0I will warn you however that the braised greens will not be anything like the sit for hours in a ham hock type. \u00a0They are actually quite crisp and sweet, which I personally do not prefer..All in all the dining experience is comfortable and delicious. The jazz on the weekend is also a plus.",

My first impression was that the restaurant was beautiful with great old photos in the lounge area and a nice dining area. Our server was very good - friendly and attentive. Three of us had the pomosas, a variation of a mimosa, and liked it very much. \u00a0Our other friend had a Sapporo beer while I had coffee and ice water. Two of us had the barbeque shrimp with creamy grits while another had scrambled eggs, link sausage, bacon and creamy grits. \u00a0Our other friend had a cheeseburger with bacon which came with thin, crispy homemade potato chips. I had the biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs which was spectacular. \u00a0The little biscuits were baked with chive and the sausage gravy was the best I've had in a very long time. The gospel musicians were great. \u00a0The one woman had a fantastic voice. I would return again when I have the money or if someone treats me again.",

It was actually pretty quiet in the place at 6pm.  To start things off I had the Pear Flower - not like anything I have had (not that I have exotic things all the time) but I wanted something that didn't remind me of a G&amp;T or tropical drink of sorts. The Peal Flower is smooth, exotic and tastes like you are sitting in the middle of a Indonesian flower garden, at least that is what I imagined while drinking it, i try to get away from it all when I can.   I had their pulled pork sliders with caramelized onions and blue cheese during the Jazz fest in July which are still my favorite small plate on the menu but this time I had the lamb sliders. Those were nice but not my favorite, I just love cheese.   We also had their shrimp hush puppies. I love hush puppies! These are like prawns with a hush puppy coating - not hush puppies stuffed with shrimp.   Overall delicious, i will come back for dinner when I win the lottery :) probably sooner for dessert!",

However, they were extremely helpful during the process, answering any question, assisting with menu options and following up. For this reason decided to check them out on my personal time.   The place is well spaced out, not close enough were you can hear your neighbors talk, or far enough you feel you're in the farthest corner of the room. \u00a0The restaurant feels intimate and perfect for a first date or a business meeting, as you're able to hear each other without having to yell. The d\u00e9cor is fantastic, if you're a jazz lover and over all American history connoisseurs you'd appreciate some of the pictures hanging on the walls. \u00a0The restaurant is divided in two sections: \u00a0a lounge and a restaurant; great for grabbing a drink an appetizers or having a full seat down meal.   Service was excellent and didn't skip a beat, not once did we have to flag the waiter. They definitely kept an eye on everyone to make sure drinks were filled and food served. \u00a0  The food, my God... \"Droool!\" This is definitely not the healthiest food but I love it. Food was delicious and presentation was excellent. For appetizers we tried the shrimp and grits and shrimp hushpuppies, very rich and lots of butter. \u00a0For main entr\u00e9e I was amazed at how great the catfish tasted, I could have licked the plate. My boyfriend tried the grilled Ribeye and while he says it wasn't the best, I liked it a lot. I suppose the beauty is in the eye of the beholder.   Great food and service. My kind of place!",

    "review_text": "Yummy!  The BBQ shrimp and grits appetizer was the best thing I had there.  The fried chicken, although not my favorite, was delicious.  The dessert- peach cobbler- was uniquely presented with the cobbler in one small dish and some yummy sorbet in another.  The side dishes- the greens and the mac and cheese- were so good!  The server was kinda weird, but adequate. Everyone else was really friendly and the atmosphere was great.  I know many people have written much more interesting reviews of 1300, so the main reason I decided to add my 2 cents was because I read several reviews where people complained about the portion size and the authenticity of the southern food (there are very few complaints overall, but I felt the need to address them).  Specifically, they complained that the size of the BBQ shrimp appetizer was too small- but they were eating it as an entree! Well duh people, appetizers are small, especially in fine dining establishments. If you are going to eat an appetizer as your entire meal, do yourself a favor and order some sides to go with it, and stop complaining.  Secondly, those complaining that the food isn't southern enough, get over it because it's called \"north meets south\" right on the website. It's a fusion of flavors, not intended to be strictly southern. Enjoy it for what it is rather than being so narrow-minded.  I love this place, the food is great, and I will be back to try the short ribs and the pork chop.",

The combo was great, and the leader oozed charm -- got the whole room involved, and his daughter obviously has his DNA -- great pipes. Not classic gospel (just one tune), just very good music. Only problem is that you can't really talk while the music's happening, but that's not the point: \u00a0it's a performance, and you can hang out and chat beforehand and afterward.

    "review_text": "1300 On Fillmore had been bookmarked for some time. So I was pretty excited when I was going through Savored and saw them available the evening and time slot I was looking into. Most of the other restaurants on the site were ones I was not interested in trying or ones I was not interested in returning to.   So we go and ordered the following: -Fried Green Tomato Salad, Warm Panko-Herb Crusted Chevre Goat Cheese, Lavender-Honey Vinaigrette -White Corn &amp; Sweet Pea Risotto, Chefs Mix Mushrooms, Wilted Greens, Tomato Marmalade -The day's porkchop special which accompanied a side of white truffled mac + white cheddar cheese  We started off with the cornbread with sweet butter. Just so-so for me. Their creamy mac and cheese was the best thing we had that night.   Unfortunately, the one that remains in my memory about our dining experience with 1300 is not the meal, the nice-ish modern (but slightly bland) loungey decor or the so-so service but something that happened toward the end of the night. On our way home when we had already driven some distance away from the restaurant I received a call from the host telling me (not even asking if) I took BOTH copies of the receipt and that they needed me to come back and re-sign it. I was caught off guard because I remember with 100% certainty signing the merchant copy and putting it back on the right hand flap of the leather pocket of the bill fold. While on the phone I even checked my purse told them I only had the \"customer copy\" in my possession and not the \"restaurant copy\".   Hubs was pissed but we drove back to the restaurant anyway. I should have had them run out to the car to to me with a pen. I'm sure they dropped it somehow when they picked up the bill.   They could have handled it better and I should have refused returning because THEY'RE the one who's misplaced it. They had my credit card info, just run it through. That experience alone puts a bitter taste in my mouth about 1300 Fillmore. Not returning.",

    "review_text": "Let's get one thing out of the way first: I love cheap food.  That being said, I can safely say that I very much enjoyed my dining experience at 1300 on Fillmore. Fancy places such as this aren't my favorite places to go to--I'll take quantity over quality any day of the week--but I decided to take the dive and indulge.   My girlfriend and I went on a lovely Wednesday evening, avoiding the crowd completely. Once seated, she took one look at the menu and immediately asked me if we should leave. Sure, the prices may be high, but we're ADULTS. We can do whatever we want. (We stayed)  I ordered the short-rib and fat fries, while my girlfriend ordered the fried chicken and greens. Also had the BBQ shrimp and grits for an appetizer. Whoa boy. I must say, those were some pretty good grits. Nice and creamy (obviously), but also had some hidden surprises (roasted garlic, for one). Would recommend it to anyone going there whose throat doesn't close up when they put a shrimp in their mouth.   Oh, right. The Cornbread. Two pieces came wrapped in a cozy-looking napkin, served with the jalapeno jelly and honey butter. Unlike most cornbread I've tasted, these weren't overloaded with sugar. Just nice and cornbread-y. That's all you really need.   Dishes finally came and I pick up my knife and fork to cut my short-rib. Two seconds later, I put the knife back down. With meat this tender, who NEEDS one? Delicious, it was. The fat fries were a tad plain, but the house-made ketchup was awesome. My girlfriend didn't seem to like the fried chicken all that much, but I thought it was great. Crispy, perfectly moist and seasoned; you don't really need more gravy to enjoy it (really now, Chie...)  By the end of the night, we were stuffed, and I realized I would be spending the most I have ever spent for a single dinner in my entire life. It was well worth it, though. I would rate this 5-stars if I had the money to ever come back here, so 4 will have to do. But if you're in the mood for some high-class soul food, I can't think of any better place.",

For appetizers, my wife had the Corn Bisque that she dove into and thoroughly enjoyed with the touch of sour cream. \u00a0I had the Pork Belly (the server said it was highly rated on Food Network) with fried duck egg and braised butter beans...not enough belly for me, but relatively tasty. \u00a0I actually wish I had my wife's entree, the catfish over andouille sausage and shrimp jambalaya. \u00a0They served a very generous fillet of catfish, and she said it was seasoned very well. \u00a0(I did taste it on the leftover side the next day, and I know that dish was made for me!) \u00a0I had the maple short rib, which for a meat-and-potatoes type was not enough meat for me; however, the flavor was not disappointing. \u00a0We ordered greens and macaroni &amp; cheese as sides: the greens were not cooked through all the way, but we took them home and the wife hooked them up properly; the highlight of my meal was the macaroni &amp; cheese, which I had to take home to really enjoy (I think I tasted some gouda in there)! \u00a0We did dessert, which consisted of a bourbon pecan pie (not great, but not bad) and the strawberry-rhubarb cobbler (which my wife finished easily).  We did take home the chocolate chip cookies. \u00a0Honestly, they didn't come close to satisfying my sweet tooth like the Safeway-brand \"break 'n' bake\" cookies; but if you put them in front of me, I would still eat them.  Overall, my wife and I will be back for sure to try something else on the menu so I can get a better handle on their cuisine.",

    "review_text": "We were out of town guests who made reservations for Valentines Day several weeks in advance.   Never once during our reservation or confirmation period were we told that there was going to be a pre-fixed menu of $65 per person (no other options).   Upon arriving for our 930pm reservation, we were told that they were running late and to enjoy a drink at the bar in the meantime. The place was packed and it felt impossible to even access the bar; but when we finally did, we had the rudest bar tender ever.   Finally at 10:10pm we were seated to be surprised by this \"mandatory\" menu.   Appetizer: shrimp and grits. A dish that the waiter told us was FAMOUS. A dish that put them \"on the map\". The grits were so bland... Accompanied by 5 small shrimp and an ABUNDANCE of cracked black pepper. That's all you tasted. For the record, this menu item on its own is $15 and very overpriced for what you're getting .  Entree: fried chicken. Also told it was famous so you can imagine my excitement when it came to the table. First off, either the plate was so hot or the food sat for so long that the sauce rimmed around the plate was dried onto the plate itself. The chicken, boneless, was not crispy and very dry. As though they anticipated it being their no. 1 seller so they fried it all earlier and then kept it in a warmer. The accompanying mash and biscuits were edible... Nothing special.   Side: truffle mac n cheese. If you're a fan of Mac n Cheese, don't get it here. Pasta was over cooked, cheese sauce was very runny and the \"truffle\" part of it is oil. Truffle oil, which is a chemical made to taste like truffles. There's nothing real about it... This stuff is made at the same perfume factory as Chanel No. 5.   Dessert was a tasting plate for two. It wasn't anything special.   We had a $200+ bill and left extremely disappointed.   This place is great only for its ambiance, not food. The live band and tiny lounge in the front is a great place to start your night... Just don't eat there.",

Service has always been super and the ambiance if wonderful - I am coveting the rose lamps on the walls (shhh) and love the lounge area. The soups are almost always impressive, but some of the main dishes miss the mark. The beef short ribs are consistently delicious (as in \"would I look like a glutton if I ordered seconds??\") but the fried chicken and hushpuppy shrimp are \"meh\". The chef is also relying on bacon far too much - \u00a0a little goes a long way but the warm poached egg salad had bacon dressing, ham in the salad and a slice of bacon over the top of the salad. The whole salad tasted like crunchy bacon grease, fried in bacon grease, topped with bacon. Horrible.   The side dishes are also hit and miss: the greens (veggie version, skip the extra extra extra bacon please) were super, but the mac and cheese was bland.   Happy Hour here is fantastic - lamb sliders, fat fries and beef short rib sandwiches are at happy hour prices, plus $3 glasses of sparkling.",

The appetizers were pretty much the highlight of the meal. The Fried Green Tomato Salad was a good start, and I thought the Sweet Corn Bisque was a good sign of things to come. The House Brined Grilled Pork Chop was juicy and succlent like a brined meat should be, but sadly it was exceedingly salty. The Fulton Valley Farms Organic Black Skillet Fried Chicken also fell below my expectations. Yes, I was damn sad about it because I was giddy like a school girl for some soulful fried chicken. I'd have to say the skin was crisp and flavorful with the meat juicy and tender, but it was ruined by the strong hint of cumin. The Banana Cream Pie dessert was also a let down. The bananas were only half ripe, and that spelled a flat end to an otherwise pleasant meal with good company. The chicken pretty much sealed the deal for a two star rating. I usually eat everything on my plate especially if it's good. It's a bad sign when I don't finish half of my entree and I don't even want to box of the leftovers. I am a garbage can. And if I don't eat it, it's a bad sign...  Oh hell, I forgot about the Macaroni 'n White Cheddar Cheese. Yeah, it was pretty forgettable. The macaroni was cooked well, but the cheese had no bite. Actually there wasn't much cheese sauce, and the sauce that was present was overpowered by the overly herbed bread crumbs. This mac 'n cheese lands near the bottom of my \"list.\"",

Not only was the food great, but the live jazz band truly made it enjoyable (although we couldn't hear it from our table, it was fun waiting and listening to the live band in the beginning.)  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, although nothing stuck out to me as mind-blowingly good. \u00a0The scallops on my surf 'n turf were really great, though.. and so was the surprise chicken liver in my friend's rissoto. \u00a0Fried Okra was good... Chicken was good. Bingets were good... :)  It's a solid spin on soul food and I'll be back soon! \u00a0(next time I won't spend so much $, though. \u00a0$65!! \u00a0I should have stuck to the DAT menu... \u00a0:P)",

It's a really nice restaurant with a great atmosphere but the best part of the restaurant was our waiter, George. \u00a0Very professional, helpful and attentive. \u00a0  We ordered the skillet fried chicken and the special, half a rack of ribs w/cole slaw and mac n cheese. \u00a0The chicken was excellent, crispy and juicy with loads of flavor. \u00a0However, the ribs did not deliver. \u00a0It was really dry and felt like it was way over cooked. \u00a0The outside of the ribs were pretty warm but the inside was room temperature so I'm thinking they tried reheating the ribs backup and that made them so dry. \u00a0I also felt like the cole slaw was a little bland but the mac n cheese was pretty tasty.  We ended the meal with a pineapple bread pudding and that was a great finish.   Other than the ribs, we really enjoyed the restaurant and will definitely be going back!  Thanks George for taking good care of us.",

It is one of the finer new establishments to bring the Fillmore district back to life in a positive sense. I have come here for brunch, dinner dates, a company Christmas party, for the drinks at the bar and for apps and drinks in the lounge area. I love decor: the historical jazz pictures with the light behind them on the walls, the unique decorative hanging lamps and the dark wood everywhere. I really like the way this place sections off to make it more intimate whether for private parties or if it's not that busy and they close off certain sections. Oh, the music is jazzy of course. Romantic, classic, soulful, happy and fun. The staff are cheery, helpful and knowledgeable. Ok, the best for last...the food is AMAZING! I have gotten the pork main (YUM!), the shrimp and grits app (YUM!) and the butternut squash soup (YUM again!). I've gotten a lot more than that but that's what comes to mind..haven't had anything bad or even mediocre there basically. This a really classy without being pretentious place and I highly recommend you go there NOW!",

We walked in with last minute reservations, so had to wait just a bit, but the bar area is beautiful, with large leather seats setup in little groups. \u00a0Great if you want to just grab a few drinks and appetizers! Since this is just a few doors down from Yoshi's I assume that's what lots of people were doing.   When we finally did get seated we were HUNGRY...and we proceeded to order just about every appetizer and side on the menu. \u00a0  Here's a little breakdown of the food: Cornbread - delicious, think we asked them to refill the basket 3x Shrimp hushpuppies - gold brown spheres of deliciousness Butternut squash soup - had a little tast of this, it was velvety and the portion was huge. Creamy grits - freaking amazing, could have eaten just that and been a happy camper Fried Chicken - omfg, seriously, this is some good freaking chicken. Crispy on the outside, tender juicy on the inside...it's rolled in unexpected spices so beware - \u00a0there's a nice healthy dose of paprika and cumin so if you don't like them just beware. Mac and Cheese - disappointment, don't bother with it, completely tasteless. Fries - no idea why we ordered this, it was overkill Begnets - Meh  All in all, while there were a couple of dishes that weren't so hot, it was a really great dinner. \u00a0Believe we got out of there for about $180 with tax and tip for all that food - pretty amazing if you ask me. \u00a0So much food had to waddle out the door slowly. \u00a0Only complaint I had was with the noise level - it was busy and noise is to be expected but the sound seemed to be almost overwhelming at times, we could barely hear each other shit talking over all the other noise.",

    "review_text": "So I have to say that it pains me to write this review but I feel that I must.  I'm going to start off by saying that my \"relationship\" with 1300 Fillmore dates back about 3 years. My partner and I had our first date here on Valentine's Day. Then we celebrated our 1 year anniversary here again and another Valentine's Day. And tonight we went back to join the crowd on the celebration of the 3 year Anniversary of 1300 Fillmore.  Well...I've experienced Bar-mitzvah's that had better soul. We decided to eat in the dining room since the bar was jam-packed due to the anniversary special that the restaurant was holding. No biggie. We'll just sit down and eat. The maitre'd seemed less than enthused to even seat us. Considering the restaurant half was half empty, they could have used the business on a Monday night. I really expected more on their anniversary....even if we were going to be paying full price for dinner and not $3 on the bar side.  Now mind you, our waitress (Iris) was a sweet girl. She was attentive to us...until the point the regulars came in. Now we were fully aware that we were not allowed to have the Anniversary specials unless we were sitting in the bar, but considering we were sitting next to these \"regulars\" that came in...we overheard her informing them that they could have it instead of sitting in the bar. Fine. That's perfectly fine, except she \u00a0didn't even know that even though we didn't come on a weekly basis we had chosen to dine at 1300 for some of the most important occasions in our lives. Doesn't that still make us regulars? We didn't sign-up for the e-list for nothing.  No biggie. Except after the regulars arrived, service completely stopped. I managed to finish my scallops and my partner managed to finish his half order of baby back ribs. No one came by. We waited and waited. Finally I decided to construct a house made of rib bones on top of the dishes that were waiting to be taken away. The maitre'd finally came by and took the dishes away. Then no one came by still.  Finally, my partner said let's just put our credit cards down and see if they get the hint. It wasn't until I saw Iris look through the window from the bar side, that she realized that we were ready to leave. She came to the table and stated that she guessed from the cards that we weren't interested in dessert.  No Iris. We have a perfectly fine Reese's PB cake in the fridge we'll just eat instead.  My partner said that he was disappointed. He said \"If I'm going to pay this much for dinner, I'm not coming here again.\" I think after celebrating these occasions there we kind of felt cheated. But no worries. San Francisco is a foodies paradise. There are many restaurants opening up and some that love to have us *ahem* SAUCE *ahem*.  It's disappointing but I hope they learn that it's the little things like this that can make or break a restaurant. In a city like San Francisco, you have to keep that relationship with your customers in order to keep them coming back.   Sorry 1300, but we won't be back for your 4th and you won't have any of our special occasions.",

All of the marks of a top-end restaurant.  And like most top-end restaurants, the prices are high and the portions are small. Though we came for the 3-course meal that 1300 had for its Chef Week, all of us ended up ordering our own entrees because the selection they had didn't seem all that appetizing.  Midway through our meal, Kiefer Sutherland walked in covertly. I wasn't sure whether he was there to partake in Chef Week as well, or whether he was there to torture \u00a0-- err interrogate someone.  All around, the food was splendid for the most part. My rib-eye steak was cooked just how I like it (red meat please) and trying my friends' fried chicken was a joyous moment.  However, my main grievance of the night was how small the portions were for each entree. While the portions can be expected to be small, I didn't feel satisfied for the money I was throwing down . For being so pricey I would hope for a little bit more food. I can't say I will come back to 1300 anytime in the near future. You could get more bang for your buck at other fancy venues in SF.  3.5 stars for the fried chicken, the company, and Jack Bauer's surprise appearance.",

Appetizer Chicken Livers and Frisee Salad was cooked nicely and delicious. Fried Chicken with biscuits and potatoes, that was moist and seasoned well. No bones, just chicken breast tenders. Shortrib was fall-off-the-bone tender. Grits were thick, not creamy enough, and too much cheese. Ribeye steak was overcooked and mealy. The bed of vegetable fried stringy things was really tasty. Side order of mac and cheese was terrible. The cheese was not mixed through the macaroni, and the pasta was pre-cooked.

By FANCY I mean dress CLASSY too because this is an upscale restaurant that feels really awkward if you just go casual. The ambiance is great. Right when you walk in to your left is a wall full of really cool frames that have historical photos in them by the bar. To your right is the dining area. The tables are really spacious and it just seems luxurious dining here.   We were seated right away via OpenTable that I had made reservations on. 1300 also provides you with Corn Bread! YUM. Our meal consisted of:   Fried Oysters: YUM! You only get 4 though, but they are big and freshly fried. It is good on its own and doesn't need the sauce that comes with it.   Maple Syrup Braised Boneless Short Rib: DELICIOUS. Wow! Until I can find another restaurant that can do better, this place is my ultimate fave for short ribs. The meat was really tender and juicy. I loved the flavor and texture of it. Not only was it plated elegantly it was full of flavor. It was really sweet and I enjoyed it with the mash potatoes.   Black Skillet Fried Chicken: For $30 this dish was pretty worth it. There were at least 3 big pieces of chicken. The chicken wasn't even greasy even though it was fried and it was very fresh. So fresh, you could taste the meat through each soft bite. The biscuits that came with it was buttery and fresh out the oven.   Warm Chocolate Beignets: Even though we were full, I wanted to try this! SO GOOD! Highly recommended! Chocolate centering the beignet is sweet enough on its own, but tastes so much better when you indulge it with the chocolate sauce and coffee soda. Coffee soda? I know! too good.   My meal was too amazing. I couldn't get over it after I left. I felt good afterwards! Our server was really nice and friendly. The only negative thing I would have to say would be towards the hostess. I do remember her name, but will not name it on Yelp, but she was RUDE. She gave such attitude and definitely thought she was better than everyone else. She needs to get off that high horse because her attitude is going to drive customers away!",

Apparently they have two seatings, one at 11am and the other at 1:00 p.m. \u00a0We arrived at 1250 and waited while they cleared the whole dining room. The decor is very old school Fillmore, with pictures of old singers and how Fillmore used to be.   We were seated and they had live singers. It was a tad bit loud, and if you want to have a conversation, I recommend requesting a seat in the back.  First out came the scones and cornbread. So delicious and we asked for second. \u00a0You have a choice of entrees and I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, which was really delicious. The chicken skin was yummy and the inside was tender and juicy and off the bone. The bread was also good. I tried the french toast with apples which was also very good.   For the desserts, we ordered one of each, but I liked the lemon meringue the best.   The meal also came with coffee and your choice of drinks, including bellinis and mimosas.",

This is definitely a really nice looking lounge and it gives off a really relaxing filling.  == Food ==  The choices of dishes are really limited and it wasn't that great for Dine about Town.  The beet salad is the only appetizer to choose. It's tastes like beet. There's a nice sauce they have on the bottom. Kind of zingy, but again, it's just beets.  The cod was pretty awful. Really squishy and chewy. Skip it.  The pork was pretty good. Soft texture and not cooked too dry.  The apple cobbler is alright. It's really sweet. The pie crust part was probably the best thing out of it.  Drinks was pretty good. I had a feisty blood orange drink. It had some kind of red pepper inside of it to make it taste a bit tangy and spicy. It's a nice combo.  == Service ==  Service was really good. Attentive and quick.  == Overall ==  Great place to relax and grab a drink. Chill out. Food is not impressive and not worth it for Dine about Town.",

Not too crowded or noisy. \u00a0Some of us did DAT but I opted for the normal menu which seem to be more appealing. We ordered:  - Sea &amp; Swine = Whiskey smoked pork belly, bay scallops braised cabbage, mustard gastrique. Pork belly was chewy and tasteless.   - Black Skillet Fried Chicken = Buttermilk whipped potatoes, pan gravy chive herb biscuits. Nicely fried chicken. Huge portion.   - Green Tea Smoked Rainbow Trout = Roasted heirloom potatoes, blue lake beans pistachio brown butter. The potatoes that look like they're from Trader Joe's.   - Barbecue Shrimp N' Grits = I am a grits lover.   - White Truffle Macaroni N' Cheese = Smoked gouda, white cheddar, bleu cheese. Can't go wrong with mac n' cheese!   - Hanger Steak = Fava bean succotash, Point Reyes blue cheese, crispy shallots.   - Pan Roasted Petrale Sole = Braised rapini greens, chive mashed potatoes &amp; caper brown butter. Great portion.   - Apple Cobbler = with vanilla bean ice cream. Decent and nothing you wouldn't expect. \u00a0  - Warm Chocolate Beignets = with chocolate sauce and coffee soda. My favorite of the night. The coffee soda with piping hot chocolate beignets was divine.   Although the meal did not live up to my expectation, however, the service was outstanding. Attentive staff with likable personality. The place was well decorated with dimmed light. Perfect place for a date.",

Great resturant, great ambiance, great service and of course, great food.  Appetizer - tiger shrimp hush puppies. Not your tradition hush puppies. This one was battered with a shrimp inside like tempura style. Yummy. Grapefood arugula spring salad with lemon citrus vinigarette. Refreshing and loved the fruits in there.  Main dishes - I had the ribs. Super tasty and cooked to perfection. Boyfriend had the baked salmon. The skin was super crispy and I think they seared it then baked it. The other layer was cooked to perfection and the inside was still a little raw. The salmon was amazingly fresh so that's why this worked. My friend had the fried chicken - good and worth ordering.  Side orders - mac and cheese with truffle oil - good but have had better. Corn bread - OH MY GOD so freaking good! It came straight out of the oven the outside was hot and crispy and the inside was soft and flaky. Yum! \u00a0  Dessert - had the strawberry souffl\u00e9 type of thing. Good but the strawberry filling was too sweet.  All in all great experience. I love the live band that plays, it heightens the mood and gives the place a even cooler factor ( first cool factor is that it's on Fillmore).",

Sign me up and so I made reservations for 7:00pm.  We arrived 20 minutes early; the restaurant looked pretty empty still and the host immediately seated us with a smile. \u00a0I usually order a bottle of wine for occasions like this but I was still a little buzzed from our wine tasting trip. \u00a0It was a while before our waitress Nikki came to our table because the table next to us was being DIFFICULT, ugh. \u00a0But Nikki kept her composure and was all smiles when she came to us. \u00a0She told us about their specials (rack of ribs, yum!) and of course the fried chicken which is why I was here for and after a couple of minutes, I and my companions ordered our entrees. \u00a0The other servers brought out some hot from the oven corn bread with butter and a jalapeno jelly spread that was sooo good. \u00a0I was tempted to ask for another basket of corn bread but we didnt want to ruin our appetites.  Here's what we had:  Small Plates--  Sweet Corn Bisque, Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche, Chive Infused Olive Oil: sweet corn taken to the next level- creamy with just the right amount of sweetness, one of the highlights of this dinner.  Fresh Water Shrimp Hush Puppies, Ancho Chile R\u00e9moulade: crunchy with the remoulade giving it a nice kick, my companions definitely liked this one.  Spiced Fat Fries with homemade ketchup: So good, the ketchup was kinda sweet, reminded me of banana ketchup.  Entrees--  Maple Syrup Braised Boneless Beef Short Rib, Crispy Onion Rings and Fresh Horse-Radish-Chive Mashed Potatoes: \u00a0So tender, it just breaks apart when you put a fork to it. \u00a0  Black Skillet Roasted Catfish, Andouille Sausage, Shrimp Jambalaya, Cornbread Panzanella Salad: \u00a0this was not my dish but I had a little bit of the catfish and it was good.  Black Skillet Fried Chicken, Buttermilk Whipped Potatoes, Pan Gravy: Yes its pricey and yes its that good! \u00a0It came out piping hot, very juicy as you bite into it. \u00a0We all tried to figure out what spices they used hahaha! \u00a0I got my mashed potatoes on the side late and they also forgot the gravy. \u00a0Oh well, it was still good so I didnt care.  We were so stuffed at the end of dinner we didnt even make it to dessert but there's always a next time. \u00a0The restaurant itself is very nice, decked out in warm, brown tones with lots of pictures on the wall depicting jazz musicians (its right next to Yoshi's). \u00a0I thought our total bill was reasonable given the quality of the food and the portions were just right. \u00a0We found parking at a garage nearby but there is ample street parking when its not so busy. \u00a0I would definitely come back even just for the chicken ;)",

    "review_text": "Not entirely sure why I waited so long to come here. Soul food with a slightly fancy twist? Really should have been a no-brainer for me.  To start, the corn bread was absolutely awesome. With the jalapeno jelly, it was just unbelievably tasty. The fat fries were a little nondescript - just fries, but like 4x thicker. \u00a0My favorite thing that I had was the corn pudding, as suggested by the manager. \u00a0It was certainly awesome. Like a cross between corn chowder and grits, it was perfect. The crispy poached egg on top was life-changing. \u00a0  Then we got actual grits, with succulent pieces of shrimp on top, and it was also excellent, as was the beef short rib. The cornmeal breading on the onion rings was a tad too heavy, though.  Then, to top off the already ridiculous meal, we ended with a banana cream pie, which was banana-y and creamy and a pie, so in other words the best.   The service was great. The ambiance was great. We came on a weekday and the table next to us consisted of four gentlemen all 65+, dressed in their weekday best. It was the cutest.",

I began with a Mandarin Cosmo. \u00a0It's fantastic and I highly recommend this drink. \u00a0I mean, I was going to see Sex and the City afterwards. \u00a0What else should I have been drinking?  To start, we had the Warm Poached Egg Salad. \u00a0It was like eating a delicious plate of bacon-y goodness. \u00a0Sean ordered the Shrimp Hushpuppies and Blake got a Baby Arugula salad.  For our entrees, I had the Fried Chicken. \u00a0It's deboned, battered and friend and was really good. \u00a0The breading might have been a little thick and crunchy for my taste (if we're splitting hairs here), but I ate every bit and liked the little bit of spiciness. \u00a0The truffled potatoes were good, too. \u00a0I would have appreciated another veggie, but I'll live.  Blake ordered the lamb with grits. \u00a0It was tender and delicious. \u00a0We had the best two entrees if I do say so myself. \u00a0Rand and Sean both (I think) ordered the halibut. \u00a0They said it was good, but the portion seemed a little small.  For dessert, Sean ordered Banana Cream Pie for us all to share. \u00a0I had one bite and it was really tasty.  I also had a Pomegranate Martini during dinner. \u00a0It was a little too sweet but drinkable.  All in all, I would have to recommend 1300. \u00a0I've had two good meals there. \u00a0It's a great addition to the neighborhood.",

This was a spur-of-the-moment night-before birthday dinner. We were greeted at the door by an exotic beauty who showed us to a table. The first thing I noticed, after the great decor, was how professional and cooperative the staff was. The exotic beauty at the door bussed a table after seating us. The staff was a team and the fact they seemed to enjoy their work just made the food that much better. \u00a0My friend did the DAT flank steak and commented it was the best beef she had ever tasted, which was confirmed when she shared a bite. \u00a0I had catfish and it was an excellent example of Chef David Lawrence's culinary style. \u00a0The atmosphere, the professional service, and the excellent food made for a great evening.",

The Brussel sprouts and French fry apps weren't that memorable and the rib eye was tiny. The bed of lentils or beans beneath the steak were undercooked. The best dish by far was the ribs.

(Imma write this in my Southern Style voice - read with a Southern drawl)  I was a hankerin' for some Southern food, but being up here in NorCal, finding real Southern food is like trying find a slice of chocolate cake within 100 miles of a fat kid - it ain't gonna happen (sorry there, no prejudice against fat kids - except for that one back in the 3rd grade that was a bully...I hear he got himself that there diabetes...SUCKAH!)  I wanted me some Cajun Creole, but all I could I find was Roux at the Row...been there, done that....their best item? \u00a0The absinthe. \u00a0And the hush puppies. \u00a0Go ahead, ask for some boudain...the waiter is gonna look at ya funny. \u00a0Oops, that's another review.  Anyways, I done said to myself, what do I REALLY want?  Cajun.  Fudge.  Soul food?  Lil bit.  Ain't ya'll ever heard of REAL Soul Food??!!  I Yelp this restaurant and I sez to myself, \"Aight, lezz give it a shot.\"  The restaurant is kind of hard to find, unless you see the sandwich board outside...I valet the car and walk-in.  Interesting.  Lots of loud-ass jazz working the room, a sitting area on the left with some vintage black and whites along the wall and the restaurant was packed. \u00a0  I are smart. \u00a0I made reservations.  I'm seated and the dude takes my jacket. \u00a0Thanks sir.  Before I even begin looking at the menu, I order a shot of double Vodka and rum (don't try this at home). \u00a0Down it and order another one with a Bud Light chaser.  Perfect.  I grab the menu and peruse this \"soul food.\"  I rolled my dang eyes.  God dang it...freaking FUSION again...sigh.......  I just wanted something inherently bad for me...and I get yet another artist wannabe.  Lemme tell ya'll sumtin' - grits ain't that hard to make. \u00a0And it's freaking good. \u00a0Hell, I could do it; I wanted to storm back in the kitchen and make'em myself.  I ordered the BBQ Shrimp and the creamy grits.  The grits were the best part - buttery and delicious.  But you don't add no shrimp to that shit...WTH??!!! \u00a0I was upset. \u00a0The shrimp was...MEH...not impressed. \u00a0This ain't soul food. \u00a0Imagine Van Gogh, but blind. \u00a0Great artist - think he could have painted shit if he was BLIND??!! \u00a0I think not.  Due to my sadness at the attempt of this restaurant to be trendy, I ordered another shot...straight gin, rimmed with sugar, and a drop of lemon juice (again, don't try this at home). \u00a0Ahhh, much better.  I ordered the Grilled Ribeye steak. \u00a0Ouch. NOTTTTTTTTTTTT impressed.  WTH??!! \u00a0Where was I?? \u00a0I wanted freaking soul food. \u00a0REAL G*D damn soul food and I end up with...F*^CKING SH&amp;T....ugh....in my hopes of making the food more palatable, I order 2 more shots, a glass of Noir, and a Bud Light.  Ok, I need to stop now; as ya'll can see, I was not happy about this place. \u00a0The portions were for a 5 year old, the restaurant so loud you couldn't hear anyone, and the price was exorbitant.........  My bill was $225 after tip.  I got better food at IHOP and back in Texas, I'd just sneak in a flask of whiskey. \u00a0  Enough with the Fusion already...gimme my old-school food the way it's suppose to be made (by the way, REAL soul food has at least freaking CATFISH on the menu) and I'll be a happy boy. \u00a0Keep your damn fusion in your stupid liberal house...gimme the stuff that'll clog my arteries, a shotgun, a six-pack, and food that'll let my cholesterol level shoot through the damn roof.

The fried chicken came with these biscuits the size and texture of small hockey pucks. The complimentary cornbread was good to eat. The highlight for me in the entree was the pear flower martini. We also shared the fries and they were good. The house ketchup, I think I prefer regular Heinz. :)  The visa promotion was a complimentary cobbler and we ordered the biegnets too. The desserts were very very good which lightened the meal's perception. Also, our waittress was excellent and super pleasant.

The food lived up to the surroundings at our dinner for 6 last Friday night. \u00a0Everyone in our party loved it, with one guest claiming it as his new favorite restaurant in SF. \u00a0 \u00a0We sampled a lot of different appetizers, with the most outstanding one being the Sauteed Wild Mushrooms - a MUST-HAVE. \u00a0Others that we enjoyed were the Sweet Potato Gnocchi, BBQ'd Shrimp and Grits (my second favorite), and the Shrimp Hushpuppies. \u00a0All good, generously portioned, and full of flavor.  For dinner, I had the Maple Syrup Slow Braised Beef Short Ribs - a gorgeous presentation and delicious dish, with onion rings perched on top and sitting on a bed of chive mashed potatoes. \u00a0Tender, seasoned perfectly - a great dish. \u00a0Everyone else at the table loved their food, too - from the pescatarians to the vegetarians, and the carnivores. \u00a0  For dessert, skip the beignets (dry) and get the Peach Cobbler and the Banana Cream Pie. \u00a0  Prices are in the $25-30 range for entrees, so don't go expecting a down-and-dirty soul food experience. \u00a0This is fine dining pulling up its roots from the flavors and recipes from grandmother's kitchen, but with the technique and presentation suited to Saturday night on the town.  An extra shout-out must be made for the hooks on the bathroom sinks in the Women's Room - no more soggy-bottomed purses!",

    "review_text": "The best way i can describe this restaurant is \"mostly harmless\" and \"I'll be surprised if this place is still in place in a year.\" I went with my wife and another couple for dinner last Friday night.   Here are the Highlights: * The fried chicken was delicious. We all agreed that my friend won the dinner lottery that night. I believe the chicken was soaked in buttermilk or brine so that the meat was still quite tender and tender while the crust was crunchy and flavorful. Was it one of the best plates of chicken I've had in SF? Yes. Even better than Farmer Brown? Yup. Worth the $25+ bucks? Not quite. * Appetizers. We had the fried okra and the shrimp hush puppies. I could have eaten an entire meal of shrimp hush puppies but 5+ orders would have been quite expensive. The okra deserves mention because you could taste that the okra was fresh - it was slightly crisp. Other than that, I wouldn't order either again (the shrimp based on the value and the okra because it just wasn't worth it.) * Mac &amp; Cheese side: I'm a big fan of creative mac and cheese dishes and I do appreciate the spice they put into this dish.  * Service &amp; Decor: quite good without being overbearing. I appreciated their prompt, friendly service and complete lack of any attitude or fuss (even when we sent two drinks back -- the Sazeracs). Nice decor and could be a nice romantic place to go.  Now, the lowlights: * The drinks: The hurricanes and Sazeracs were god awful. I think I've had better made by high school kids using a bottle of mix from bed bath and beyond. The sazeracs tasted completely watered down and the hurricane was I don't know if the bar-back had just been promoted or if they just forgot to grab our drinks off of the bar. Luckily though, they had no problem swapping the saveracs for a glass of house red. That was nice and I made sure that the tip reflected such consideration. * The pan roasted snapper. The snapper tasted a bit dried out and the fancy pants foam tasted like you just made bubbles with water/oil + Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning. Not impressive. * The baby back rib special: dried meat. unimpressive sauce. Memphis Minnies ribs are far better at 1/2 the price (although I still believe MM's sauces need work -- I end up bringing in my own). Not impressive. * Beef short rib: tasted like boiled meat on a bone. Not impressive.  Bottom Line: * It's a romantic enough place but there are plenty of better places to regularly spend your dining dollars in SF. * I wouldn't take a foodie girl here if you are trying to impress her. * I'm OK that I tried it at ~$40/head using the Blackboard Eats 30% off coupon. I wouldn't have enjoyed the meal if it had cost ~$60/head. * The front of the house seems well run (we were seated immediately). The back of the house needs a bit of work.",

    "review_text": "My roommates and I came here for dinner not too long ago, and I don't think any of us walked away too impressed. The ambiance is really nice, and the hostess was sweet. She was super apologetic for our table not being ready right at 7:15pm for our reservation. Nice of her, but we waited 10 minutes to be seated at a table that had been open since we arrived, lol.  Our waiter was definitely not afraid to make conversation or recommendations. We started off with the mac 'n cheese, which I thought would be amazing, but it really lacked flavor. I ordered the catfish, and the roomies had the fried chicken &amp; short ribs. The catfish was good, but slightly overcooked. The shrimp jambalaya that it sat on top of also lacked the punch in flavor, and I would have much preferred the jambalaya at Angeline's Kitchen in Berkeley.  I didn't try the chicken &amp; short ribs myself, but didn't look like anything special. Funny thing is - my leftovers tasted better the next day, and my roommate said the same thing! Either the flavor took some time to come out, or we all weren't paying enough attention during the meal.  Either way, I would rather have soul food at an affordable price and with more flavor. Can't imagine returning anytime soon, unfortunately.",

    "review_text": "So, how did this place get such high reviews? With so many wonderful restaurants in SF and with so many options at the same price point of 1300 On Filmore, I'm not sure how and why people pick here over some other places. \u00a0Anyway, I came here for a second birthday dinner with some friends who, like me, were curious about the restaurant. \u00a0We sat towards the back of the restaurant in one of their private dining rooms since we were expecting a larger group of people. \u00a0We brought our own wine for dinner and asked the waiter to serve one, and pour another into a decanter. \u00a0First of all, the wine we brought, which came from our wine fridge, was served in the wine glasses that were on the table. \u00a0As in, the waiter didn't bring out a new set of glasses to serve the wine in. \u00a0This is one of the fundamental aspects of serving wine!! The cornbread that came was beautiful! \u00a0I LOVE LOVE LOVE cornbread and loved the two spreads that came with it. \u00a0After perusing the menu, we ordered the following:  Appetizers: -Bourbon-Hickory House Smoked Pork Belly &amp; Duck Egg, Braised Cranberry Beans -White Truffle Macaroni N' White Cheddar Cheese  Greg and I shared the pork belly and duck egg, which came out in an iron skillet. \u00a0The pork belly was definitely overcooked, and while the egg was good, the best part about this was the beans. \u00a0On top of being overcooked, the pork belly was SO small. \u00a0Like it was a small sliver of pork belly. \u00a0I had a bite of the mac n cheese and thought that it was delicious!  Entrees: -Black Skillet Fried Chicken, Buttermilk Whipped Potatoes, Pan Gravy, Chive Herb Biscuits -Pan Roasted Columbo Spiced Divers Scallops, Garlic Leeks, Red Wine Star Anis Glaze -Grilled Ribeye Burger, Brioche Bun, Bread &amp; Butter Pickles, House-made Ketchup, Creole Mustard -The Special of the Day: 1/2 rack of BBQ ribs with sides of coleslaw and truffle mac n cheese  I ordered the fried chicken, and it was...OK. \u00a0As some people have alluded to previously, the chicken itself is breaded beautifully, but not totally crispy. \u00a0It's almost like it was sitting out for too long after being fried. \u00a0The potatoes were delicious, and I liked the chive herb biscuits. \u00a0One of my friends also got the fried chicken, was so full from everything that she could only eat a small portion of her dish. \u00a0More on this to come, but the portions they give are HUGE. \u00a0Greg had the ribeye burger and was told that the burger is best eaten medium. \u00a0The burger came out medium well...which detracted from the deliciousness of ribeye. \u00a0My friend who had the ribs said that they were great with the meat falling off the bone, but the coleslaw left a lot to be desired. \u00a0  So, my last rant on 1300 on Filmore. \u00a0The servers really need to be educated. \u00a0On top of being served wine in table glasses, they also overpoured in half the glasses on the table, didn't allow the person who brought the wine to taste it before it being served to the rest of the people at the table, didn't come back to top off the glasses that got significantly less wine than the other half of the table, and poured the second wine into new glasses (thank god) while we still had over half a glass from the first wine. \u00a0The other part that peeved me is that my friend who only ate a few pieces from her fried chicken dish asked for a to-go box. \u00a0Makes sense since she basically had an entire dish leftover. \u00a0We asked twice for the box, and they totally forgot about it. \u00a0Never brought it out. \u00a0I mean, there's basically an entire meal that went to waste. \u00a0So, everything taken into account, the food was OK, nothing out of the ordinary but certainly not bad, and the service was 1-star worthy. \u00a0Nets out to two stars, which I think is fair. \u00a0Probably won't be returning back here since there are so many other restaurants that are so much better at this price point.",

    "review_text": "You know I really wanted to like this place a lot more than I actually did. It's like a date with a hot guy that just falls flat due to a lack of chemistry. You look at him and think \"Woohoo, hot make out session here I come\" and then you actually kiss and there is nothing there, like not even a spark.   My bf and I were nearby having some drinks and trying to figure out where we wanted to have dinner. We did a Yelp search and up pops \"1300 on Filmore.\" Looking at the pictures and reading the reviews had us sold.  Expectations were not met.  Service: Great service at both the bar and the restaurant.   Ambiance: It's a little off. I'm not sure. There was just something lacking. Again, how do I put this into words? It felt like shabby chic but not in a classy way. Light fixtures looked cheap (like a bad etsy project). Dusty, etc. Again this is totally just shallow aesthetics.  Food: Hmmmm. This is where they lost me. We had the chicken mousse deviled eggs. Not appetizing. Eggs were slimy and mousse had nasty after taste. Neither of us cared for them. Complementary cornbread was good but not over the top delicious. Chicken and mashed potatoes were GREAT. I will give them that. The chicken was moist and tender and the portion was more than ample. The macaroni and cheese, we took a single bite of each and made the same \"gross\" face at each other. Just NOT good. There was something so incredibly off with the make up of that mac and cheese. Thankfully our server took it off the bill.  Overall I was not happy to spend nearly $50 bucks for such a lackluster meal.",

    "review_text": "Had no expectations going in, or probably would have been even more disappointed.  Our friends had heard about 1300 Fillmore and said the fried chicken was supposed to be great. We decided to order 3 entrees (for 4 people) and share, family style, since two of us wanted to try the fried chicken but so many other dishes also sounded good. Good thing we shared, because the fried chicken was really mediocre and I would have been *pissed* if that was all I had. The coating had a good texture, not too greasy, but it was totally lacking flavor, like they forgot to add the seasonings, and not as moist as it could have been (my friend, who makes fried chicken herself, said she was afraid that would be the case when she heard it was boneless.) The ribs were pretty good, tender, pretty tasty, with a decent bbq sauce, but nothing special. All the sides were uninteresting: mashed potatoes (one of my favorite foods in the world) were a bit dry and lacking in flavor, and after having one bite of both the cole slaw and mac&amp;cheese, I didn't bother going back for more. The best dish was the catfish over jambalaya, which was also by far the smallest dish: a good size for me (small female), but probably too small for any man with a good appetite. The jambalaya was the only thing with flavor. All the prices seemed high ($25 for fried chicken and mashed potatoes???) but I guess that's because you're paying for the music as well; the food is pretty standard stuff and would be hard to justify the prices without the music, even if it was good (the food, I mean).  I totally lost interest when they said they were out of the pecan pie.  The only thing I would have again is the catfish, but it's unlikely I'll go back unless someone is playing that my friends really want to see.",

So, we made a quick reservation on Open Table and were there a week later.   They start you off with cornbread, honey butter and jalapeno jelly which is good enough to be your entire meal. We started with the wild mushrooms over grits and were not disappointed.  Chris had the short rib over chive mashed potatoes and I had the black eye pea cakes and collard greens.  AMAZING! The server recommended the banana cream pie for dessert, and it was perfect because it wasn't too heavy.  The ambiance is swank, the service is friendly and we'll definitely be back!",

    "review_text": "So my fiance and I have a tradition where we go to a nice restaurant every Christmas eve. We're working class kids so we don't get the opportunity to enjoy a fancy dinner very often. We went to 1300 Fillmore with high expectations. The ambiance is lovely, the historic photos of the Fillmore district are awesome, and the little band, though a little too smooth jazz for my taste, was charming and very fitting for Xmas eve. We arrived 5 minutes early and were directed to the bar. Fine by me. Well what wasn't fine by me is that they finally sat us 25 minutes after our reservation time. I guess I should have been prepared to lower my expectations on the basis of the $10 vodka/soda I ordered that tasted like water. When we got to our table, it took another 10 minutes for our waiter to even come over and introduce himself! When he did arrive, he was rude and unaccommodating. We're talking zero personality! He'd disappear for 10-15 minutes at a time and never once came over to ask us how our food was. We had some leftovers, which he completely forgot to bring back to the table until we reminded him. He literally misplaced the food in the back as we saw him scrambling around in the kitchen (a hunt that took another 5 minutes or more). Though the food was pretty good, we received some of the worst service we've ever experienced. I highly suggest going for the food and the historical relevance, but don't expect great or even good service.",

Second plus, the ambiance catered to the occasion for low light romantic dining. Add live music, it seems like we're heading in the right direction.   Unfortunately, the positives end here. Their \"famous chicken\" priced for $26 set itself up for big shoes to fill. Aside from its crispy exterior, the meat was dry and poorly seasoned. I was better satisfied with chicken from a chicken and waffle spot at half to a third of the price. The other half ordered the rib eye. It was so bland we had to request for steak sauce, which they didn't have so we settled for salt and pepper. Tasteless $30 steak was another strike. We ordered a few drinks, their cocktails didn't have much alcohol at all as well. Their truffle mac and cheese was eh, not much truffle-y at all. Their cornbread with the paired honey butter was the best thing on the table.  Service was ok. For fine dining, servers/bust people usually clear the appetizer dishes prior to serving the main entree. Sitting with a small table for two doesn't leave much space for anything else. We had to ask if they could take the unused dinnerware away.  Ultimately, you're helping pay for their lease and decor because their culinary creations are ridiculously overpriced.",

    "review_text": "I have mixed emotions about this place. While the decor was very intriguing, from the nondescript exterior (I was unsure of whether the door was really the door) to the beautiful jazz-vibe interior, the food was not all that.  I ordered the Little Gem Salad, the fried chicken, and a side of macaroni and cheese. Honestly, the salad was the best part of my meal -- great flavors and accented with candied pecans and cornbread croutons. The fried chicken was decent. It was obviously not as good as the stuff I had in Atlanta, but it beat a few other places in the Bay Area where I've ordered it. It wasn't oily and the meat was moist, so not bad overall. Also, the breading on the chicken had an interesting spice to it, which added a bit of zest. The mac and cheese was a disaster. First of all, for $7, you just get a measly little portion, which was quite disturbing. Secondly, it was bland, and seemed that it was just sprinkled and topped with cheese, rather than actually baked and melted with it. Thirdly, it just supremely lacked the homey, comforting feeling that mac and cheese is supposed to provide. Not good. Save the $7 for dessert instead.  Speaking of dessert, no review on that, since I didn't order it. I was way too stuffed after the meal. As a general recommendation, share the food. The fried chicken dish was huge and definitely enough food for two people. The three items ordered were shared between two people, and made for a nice meal.  Oh, and we had 8pm reservations, but for some reason didn't get seated until nearly 8:45pm. Not sure what was going on with that. The service at the table itself was attentive, however.  Bonus points: The fresh, warm cornbread served was scrumptious! Tempting as it is, try not to fill up on it! ;)",

    "review_text": "Rare is the occasion where I feel I've 'experienced' a meal, rather than merely eaten it. We had an early reservation (5:30 PM), as my party and I were due at the San Francisco symphony by 8:00 PM.  We arrived a little early, so we took seats in the lounge, which was tastefully decorated with many framed photographs of famous jazz and blues musicians. The seating is spacious and comfortable. The lounge decor is understated and elegant, starting with beautiful hardwood plank floors, Oriental rugs, tufted leather chairs and sofas, and coffee tables. Throughout the entire restaurant, the high walls, painted in a deep brown, semi-sheer window treatments, sparse tree branch accents, and Japanese-inspired globe lights lend a soothing, relaxing vibe. Since the weather was quite warm, it felt like a respite from the harsh world on the outside. Think cool, dark decor, clinking glasses, air conditioning, and light jazz background music.  Patrons are offered the option of ordering drinks while waiting to be seated. I must say that the delightful combinations of spirits we consumed were nothing short of magical. I tried the Key Lime Pie, followed with a Honey Sweet Tea, which I'm told was sweet tea flavored vodka mixed with honey and lemon juice.   For an appetizer, I had the Grits &amp; Shrimp. As a native Californian, I'm not necessarily qualified to compare this to the \"real thing\", but it was delicious all the same. Nuggets of grits, in a rich sauce with perfectly seasoned shrimp. I wanted to lick the plate clean!  My entree was featured on the current prix-fixe menu. It was marinated flank steak in some sort of bourbon-molasses sauce, slices, and laid atop a rich sweet potato gratin, garnished with tiny pieces of deep fried okra. Each bite was a cacophany of taste, flavor, and utter ecstasy exploding in my mouth.  There were two other people in my party. One had the fried chicken on a pillow of mashed potatoes, and tiny chive biscuits. The other had the ribeye steak, with grits and an onion sauce. We were silent most of the way through the meal, as to not disrupt the dreamlike state in which we consumed our meals.  Cornbread was served with our meal; perfectly dry and crumbly, as it should be, served with butter and a red pepper sauce.  The service was excellent, friendly and professional waitstaff, and we never had to ask for a thing. They change out flatware, and clear crumbs between courses, which was a nice touch.  Unfortunately, we had to pass on dessert. The food is amazing, but the portions are quite generous, even for us three girls with hearty appetites. Before we even finished our meals, we were planning when to come back next.  I appreciate that parking is convenient. Just enter the parking garage on Eddy St., and take the elevator up. Yoshi's is next door for those who want to do dinner and catch a show without having to hassle with driving and parking to two different places. I only wish they validated.",

My food was lukewarm (the plate it was on was hotter than the food itself), and if anyone at your table orders the friend chicken you can expect yours not to be nearly as piping hot as theirs will be (since the chicken takes the longest to prepare).   The service was nice enough, they get three stars for being thoughtful and decorating our shared dessert plate with a \"Happy Birthday\" for my friend. But the dessert itself was not very exciting at all. I asked for a cocktail off the menu and the bartender decided he would empty out the bottle of liqueur practically doubling the called for amount and making it unbearable.   I definitely won't be traveling across the bridge again for a so-called french-southern experience there when I can get a much better version on this side of the bay at Pican.",

I'm an avid live music fan and was searching for a culinary alternative to Yoshi's next door (live music venue) before a performance for my birthday weekend. After reading the reviews I suggested this place to my brother and his date mainly due to its convenient location to the venue.   The decor is really warm, modern and comfortable. The unique back-lit framed images on the wall in the front lounge area are awesome. We started there with cocktails and was soon advised our table was ready.   Our server (so wish I could remember his name) was one of the VERY best ever! Since this was our first visit, his description of the chef/owner and the menu items definitely got us going! We were excited! Within a few minutes he brought us cornbread triangles to DIE for! Crispy on the outside, firm, warm and delicious on the inside served with honey-butter and a red pepper dipping sauce.  I had eaten too late in the day so my GF and I decided to share our meal. We started with the Sea &amp; Swine Whiskey Smoked Pork Belly, Bay Scallops Braised Cabbage w/Mustard Gastrique. While this dish was incredibly tasty it consisted of just one small slice of pork belly and one scallop for $15 so I was a little disappointed with the portion.   Next we ordered Black Skillet Roasted Catfish over Andouille Sausage Shrimp Jambalaya, Braised Greens w/Caramelized Sweet Onions, Ham Hock and White Truffle Macaroni N'Cheese w/Smoked Gouda, White Cheddar &amp; Bleu Cheese. My bro and his date ordered something that's not usually on the menu, Smoked &amp; Glazed Baby Back Rib Rack. We all sampled each others dishes and the only thing coming out of everyone's food-laden mouths was \"WOW!\"   Yes, a bit pricey for sure but we WILL be back!",

The lounge area is cozy with comfortable chairs. \u00a0The focal point of the room is the stage with the live band. \u00a0While we didn't sit there, it did get a little loud, because you would have to talk above the music. \u00a0But in the dining room, the music sets up the mood for the evening and it's just right.  For starters I would recommend either the sweet breads or the braised pork belly. \u00a0Both have have healthy portions, though they may not be the healthiest for you (as all delicious things usually aren't). \u00a0I ordered the short ribs for my entree. \u00a0It was so tender and perfectly paired with the buttermilk mashed potatoes. \u00a0If I had liked onion rings, I'm sure they would have been a great match to the dish as well. \u00a0But don't worry, they didn't go to waste. \u00a0My friend benefited from my pickiness.  Don't forget to order a side of the mac and cheese. \u00a0It's made with white cheddar and then topped with a crunch layer of bread crumbs. \u00a0Yummy. \u00a0It wasn't too heavy, but still wonderfully rich.  For dessert, we shared the sorbet with petite fours - but don't think of those little cakes, this was a special plate of a variety of little cookies and chocolates and such. \u00a0The sorbets were Meyer lemon and pear flavored. \u00a0The pear was mild, but the lemon was very refreshing and a perfect ending to a rich meal.  I would definitely recommend this place.",

It almost tasted like they mixed cheese with some sort of dry seasonal mixing that you put in those rices in the box - you know the kind you buy from the store and haven't probably eaten since the 80's when you had it for dinner as a kid?  --Little Gem Salad - this was by far the most disgusting salad I have ever tasted.

Their beer selection is a little ritzy but I guess if you are going to a place as nice as 1300 you are not looking for a heiniken light. \u00a0Anyways, we ordered a ton of appetizers including their spicy french fries with homemade ketchup and macaroni and cheese, both of which were FANTASTIC! Also, in lieu of bread on the table, they brought over little jalapeno corn bread muffins with honey butter. So tasty, I could have eaten all night. \u00a0For dinner, half of the group got the fried chicken and mashed potatoes. It was tasty, as with everything else, but the portion size and plating was off. They seriously gave me three huge chicken breasts piled atop mashed potatoes. My friend got the black eyed pea cake which was delicately placed on the plate. making me think the fried chicken dish, while delicious, is out of place on their menu.   Overall, great place to go. its a little pricey, especially for its location in the 'hood, but that's the price you'll pay anywhere in the city for such a nice, relaxing, intimate setting.",

Then I saw 1300 on Fillmore across the street and spontaneously decided to check out the place. As soon as I entered, I got super excited because 1) the place is well decorated (I really like the lounge with all the pictures!!), 2) extremely talented musicians were singing and playing gospel songs (I didn't start eating until they finished), and 3) there was a table open right in front of the music. Service, atmosphere, decor, and just everything seemed so great that I doubted that the food could be just as amazing. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised by the yummmmmy food (I ordered the eggs benedict and my friend got the rib eye burger)... THIS PLACE IS PERFECT; THEY GOT EVERYTHING RIGHT. I'm coming back for the gospel brunch for sure, and I want to try dinner as well!",

    "review_text": "Wow! I was thoroughly impressed with this place from beginning to end and I rarely get that excited about a restaurant.   Went in with no reservation and got seated immediately even though the restaurant was mostly full. There was a really good jazz band playing in the lobby. The space is really sweet, especially the wall in the lounge with floor to ceiling backlit old pictures. The layout is a bit odd and confusing and I ended up wandering into the kitchen looking for the bathroom.   Our waitress was awesome. She was barely there, but didn't miss a step and was really friendly. Water glasses never went half empty and my conversation with my friend was never interrupted.   Oh yeah, and then the food. The food! Holy Mary mother of god. The pumpkin bisque with vanilla and mascarpone was a gift from Mary's own bosom. The fried chicken was rich and tender and juicy and ahhhh....  The arctic char was just a big ol' protein plate, with an andouille and lobster hash. Yeah, that was probably the best dish of the night. The fish was crispy and flavorful and the hash was a perfect compliment.   I wanted to mention that David, the owner/chef came out during our meal, stopped by the table just to say hello and make sure we were enjoying our food. It's a very small touch that I think few restaurants, if any, seem to take advantage of anymore. I can remember (and count on one hand) every restaurant that I've been greeted by the chef, but it's one of the single most memorable things about a place.   I'll definitely be coming back for more. One of my culinary high points in 2008 was coming to 1300.",

That is all until I came to 1300 on Fillmore. Amazing. The grits with mushrooms were delight on my tongue, the short ribs so moist and flavorful and fell right from the bone and the macaroni and cheese was more than I could have imagined (even from a Southern style restaurant). The sea bass also ordered at my table ranks among the best I have ever had...just the right amount of fish flavor and flaky beyond what can be expected.   I did think the dcor was a bit odd - I get the idea, but offering different seats to different guests leaves me convinced that someone else's must be better than mine and it makes one table height a bit awkward. The server was interesting - really on par and the start and then we never saw him again...ever. Regardless, I would come here again and again, even if I had to serve myself.",

I dont think i'll return for the food but perhaps will swing by the bar for a cocktail.",

Here's what happened in the dinning area:  The quality, presentation, and taste of the food remained the same as last time, but the overall experience just wasn't as comfort. Most of the blame can be attributed to the seating. \u00a0At our table, the chairs on one side were too high and it felt as if you were hovering over the food, but if you sat on the sofa side, you sank below the table and had to hoist yourself up to eat. \u00a0There was no happy medium. Can you say awkward?  But the night wasn't a total loss. Here are the highlights for dinner:  The fried green tomato salad was the best I've had. \u00a0The tomatoes retained their firm texture on the inside while the outside was crisp and a little spicy. \u00a0But what really caught my attention was they weren't greasy: a first for me. The chocolate cake was heavenly. \u00a0It was so incredibly light and airy yet still felt very rich. \u00a0It's hard to fathom how that was achieved when you consider how dense and decadent the chocolate it tasted. \u00a0Outstanding.  On a side note, the fried chicken fell a little flat and I can't explain why. \u00a0I know it was missing something and it bothers me to say I don't know what that was exactly. Does that mean I have to go back once again? If it does, I'll be having my meal in the lounge.  Cheers.",

    "review_text": "1300 on Fillmore, located next to Yoshi's Jazz Club and Lounge, offers a refreshing contrast of Southern soul food in the heart of Pacific Height's Japan/K-town. The restaurant itself presents itself as a gourmet restaurant with a casual/lounge atmosphere, somewhat similar to Yoshi's. I thought the decorum of the restaurant was quite elegant; my only suggestion is that the lighting could be brighter because the entire time I felt like I was eating with just a candlelight.  Their menu seems mostly consistent, in that most of the suggestions us yelpers mention will be on the menu. Our group shared the Bourbon hickory-smoked pork belly and roasted brussel sprouts. Although I didn't have the pork belly, the bourbon flavors came through well in the braised butter beans that accompanied it. I particularly enjoyed the combination of the flavors that the egg yolk provided.  The brussel sprouts were cooked well but was lacking in flavor, so if you decide to get a side, I would recommend the truffle oil mac and cheese.   Overall, the entrees were delicious, with large portions per order. Think Cheesecake Factory portions, which were good for sharing. My friends were very impressed with the the black skillet fried chicken and catfish with jambalaya; both were packed with flavor and cooked to tender perfection. The braised beef short rib was equally tender but could have been cooked for less because it was a little dry. Initially I planned on ordering the bay scallops but they had ran out, since our reservation was at 9; so I had the butternut squash risotto instead...which was quite disappointing. The sweetness of the butternut squash puree was clean but its texture masked the risotto's. In the end, I felt like I was just eating squash puree which isn't particularly appealing.   Overall, 1300 on Fillmore is an enjoyable restaurant for offering a gourmet, elegant menu of American Southern comfort foods; but is not fine dining or extremely phenomenal to the extent which it is a must-go-to place in SF. Depending on your tastes, you will either really like it or find it mediocre. Since I like soul food, every now and then, I thought it was quite good.",

So after a full-fillng lunch @ Lime Tree Southeast Asian Kitchen, my big b-day dinner was @ the ultra sexy 1300 on Fillmore. After going to a reception during the opening of this restaurant, we were treated to some bites that were considered the highlights of their modern southern menu. I was hooked after trying the small lamb burgers (I am NOT a big fan of lamb!) &amp; swore I was going to try the full menu one day.  They were accommodating when some of us were running late which was very nice. We were seated in a very comfortable corner section of the restaurant with the exception of an annoying 'dead' tree that kept on poking the back of anyone's head (including George our fabulous waiter) when they stood there. We started off with shrimp hushpuppies , bbq shrimp w/grits &amp; the maple braised pork belly. Out of the 3, the pork belly was to die for! Get me bottle of lipitor!!! Tender &amp; succulent, I savored my small morsel of cholesterol (thank God Calvin cut the tiny thing into 7 pieces!)! Then I debated over the signature organic skillet fried chicken &amp; the braised short rib entree. Since 3 of us were getting the fried chicken, I opted for the braised short rib on George the waiter's suggestion hoping my friends would be kind enough to share the chicken. Linda was so generous enough to share 1/2 a piece of the chicken with me &amp; others (she was full from the app's) &amp; all I could do is just enjoy the juiciness of that memorable chicken. I forgot about the short ribs I had ordered. Mind you, what I tasted of the short ribs was awesome but that chicken totally dominated my entire meal!  The rest of the meal was a fuzzy memory &amp; the bill pretty pricey but considering all we ate &amp; drank it was worth it! (considering the week before that we ate next door @ Yoshi's &amp; spent just as much but ate 1/4 of what we had @ 1300 and swore we'd eat here before watching a show there.)",

    "review_text": "All seven of us were excited for a tasty dinner at 1300 Fillmore last Monday. We'd all heard amazing things about the food but none of us at been there before. We made reservations for 8:00pm and were sat at a nice round table in the front right when we arrived. And that was the end of things going smoothly. After being sat at our table we were left waiting for about 10 minutes before our waitress came over to take our drink orders. Another 10-15 minutes went by before we got one of the two glasses of wine we'd ordered and two of the three arnold palmers. Luckily the other two people at the table had ordered water and water had been delivered by a bus boy. At this point we grabbed a waiter walking by to ask if he could get our waitress so we could order since the fried chicken said it took 20 minutes to prepare and it was a work night. Surprisingly he said he would take our order and started asking us what we wanted without pulling out a pen or paper. There were seven of us at the table and we were sharing entrees and having salads and substituting a few things so there was definitely some worry about him remembering such a large order without taking any notes. He walked away and another 15 minutes went by during which my friend received her glass of wine but we didn't get the arnold palmer. At this point our original waitress came back and said she unfortunately needed to \"reconfirm\" our orders as the HOST had forgotten everything we'd said. There was no mention of a free round of drinks or really any acknowledgment of the fact that the three orders of fried chicken were going to take at least 20 minutes from this point, not the point 15 minutes ago when we had ordered the first time. Without letting this drag on too much, I will say that our food finally came, except for the side of mac and cheese that arrived just as we were finished eating and our waitress never mentioned taking anything off the bill to make up for the bad service.   Unfortunately for the restaurant, the food was really good. So good that we had a ten minute conversation at our table about whether we would ever come back since the service was so horrendous but the food was so good. I said that I would only come back if I was already pretty drunk and with a guy that I could make out with at the table while waiting for my food and drinks to come. Overall we decided we'll never come back. San Francisco has a lot of good food and much much better service elsewhere.",

Next time, we'll definitely try to do the lounge area, where it seems to be more relaxed.   Overall, service was a 3. Food was about a 4. Wine bottles? 5 :)  Would go back to it.",

    "review_text": "I grew up in the Fillmore, however, due to the crazy housing prices and awful parking situation, I have been living in the East Bay for the past 10 years. During one of my frequent trips to S.F to visit relatives, I was excited to notice 1300 on Fillmore and decided I wanted to dine there on my up coming wedding anniversary. I made reservations via Open Table(7:30), however, I ran late so I called to ask the hostess if there would be a table available at 9:30pm. I was assured there would be a table available. So I thought, GREAT! Upon our arrival I happily advised the hostess I called ahead to secure a table, she quickly cut me off with' right this way'. The place was really busy so I was still very happy that we were accommodated at such short notice.   After being shown to our table, the waiter came over and offered to get us drinks, I ordered a Key Lime cocktail and my husband asked for water. Drinks took about 10 min. ( okay, they are busy) \u00a0After receiving our drinks we did not see 'our' waiter for another 10 min. ( okay they are busy) So we get another waiter who happily informs us of the special which my husband ordered ( Ribs). Did no see our waiter for another 20 min. (Okay, they are busy) After receiving our food ( we were starving) we were disappointed to find the food cold. The waiter did not check-in \u00a0with us to make sure we were satisfied with our food. My husband attempted to gain the waiters attention several times with no luck. The hostess then comes over, with her back to me, begins to ask my husband if we are enjoying our meal. (huh?) At that point my husband and I decided to leave.   After thinking about my poor experience for over a week I decided to call 1300 to discuss my experience with the manager. To my delight, the manager was attentive and professional. By the end of the week, I received a gift card and personalized apology letter. As a result, my husband and I decided to give 1300 another try...stay tuned.",

We had sauteed mushrooms on marscapone grits to start - SUPER DELICIOUS!!! \u00a0We had bouillabaisse, which is \"deconstructed\" - a wee bit of liquid in the bowl and everything perched on top. \u00a0The person who ordered that does not eat meat, and the sausage was on the side so it wasn't a problem. It was very good. \u00a0The fried chicken was also very good, but the pieces were different sizes and so some were more done than others. \u00a0It was served with truffled mashed potatoes - excellent. \u00a0Neither of us liked the mac and cheese, one because it tasted like bacon, the other because it tasted like red pepper.  The service was very good and attentive, but (1) no spoon for the bouillabaisse (2) they took away the cornbread when they cleared the appetizers and (3) no tablecloths, so the plate moves around when you are trying to cut something. \u00a0Minor quibbles, of course.",

I feel like it should have been called baked beans with duck eggs and A small piece of pork belly. I am not sure what I expected, but that was not it.   For the entree, I ordered the short rib dish. It came on a bed of tapioca something or the other. It was totally unpalatable! I sent it back. The server was extremely gracious and offered to have the tapioca stuff replaced with mashed potatoes. It was okay. The food was definitely not hot, but warm-ish. My date ordered the burger, which was \"okay\". We've had better (I took a bite).   For the amount of money I spent here, I would expect a much better culinary experience. The service is definitely wonderful. Great servers and reception staff.",

It has been a favorite of mine ever since and I try to go here whenever I come to the city, especially for a show at the FIllmore or Kabuki. The food is amazing (personal favorite - Grits with sauteed mushrooms!) and the cocktails are equally good (favorite is the \"Hundred Reasons Rye\", but they also make a fantastic Gin Martini). Staff is very friendly and the lounge area in the front part of the bar is plush! overstuffed leather couches and chairs, with lots of great old pictures on the walls of the historic Fillmore district. Having cocktails in a highback leather chair while smiling Jazz greats look on behind you makes you feel like a million bucks. Plus on weekends they bring in live jazz trios and the lounge really gets packed in. If you're looking for a classy, low key place to hang out on the Fillmore, look no further than 1300!",

    "review_text": "Gospel Brunch review:  First, this is a great idea. \u00a0Live gospel with a sunday brunch, I mean, it works out well. \u00a0Lets start with the good: \u00a0  1. \u00a0The Music. \u00a0The live band really was talented and the provided rich, soulful entertaining music throughout the brunch. \u00a0Talented musicians here, and their sound dripped like sweetened butter across our ears  2. The Food. \u00a0Classic soul food with classic San Francisco high-endculinary skills fully applied. \u00a0Eggs Benedict: \u00a0Nice twist with the spiciness. \u00a0Cornbread, sweet/hot jelly, check, check, YUM. \u00a0Even plain old scrambled eggs were executed perfectly. \u00a0  So, why only 3 stars? \u00a0Well, mainly its the price. \u00a0Its fixed-price at $40/person, and thats a lot for a brunch. \u00a0Its called a 3-course brunch. \u00a0The cornbread and the muffins are delicious and can certainly demand a premium. \u00a0The desserts were good, but none of us really needed them. \u00a0The last perk you get is \"Bottomless Pomosas\", which is a sparkling white wine drink.  Ah the legendary bottomless brunch drink. \u00a0This alone should have made the $40 price worth it. \u00a0And if they executed this critical part of the meal right, and made us feel the $40 was well spent, then this could have been a 4-5 star review. \u00a0Unfortunately, the Pomosas were just not that great. \u00a0They were sweet but not strong. \u00a0None of us even got a small buzz. \u00a0Now, don't get me wrong, we were not looking to get trashed or anything, but a cocktail at brunch is Why We Do Brunch. \u00a0A bottomless brunch drink should get you buzzed, and hey, if you want to get trashed, that should be an option. \u00a0But it wasn't happening.  The other main problem was that after the show ,they rushed us off the table. The giant Pomosa valve was switched off 10 minutes earlier, so there we sat with empty glasses, and they asked us to please move to the lounge so they could set the table for the next sitting. \u00a0Now, I am sorry, but the place wasn't even full. \u00a0I saw no reason why they had to chase us off our table. Again, I would not care if this was a $20/person brunch. \u00a0But it wasn't. \u00a0It was $40/each. \u00a0They should have allowed us to relax at our table there. \u00a0This almost pushed my review down to 2 stars, but I didn't think it was fair because like I said, the music and food was great.  One final nitpick, and this is not reflected in my Rating, its just a suggestion. I appreciate the musicians getting some audience participation going, its fun. \u00a0But we can't all sing. \u00a0Especially into a mic. \u00a0I was approached and I was a sport and tried to sing, but trust me, I suck. \u00a0It was a bit embarrassing. \u00a0I will chat you up all you want, but please, don't make me sing, okay?  So, in closing, a fun place and a good idea, but if you are going to charge that much $$$ for the experience, you really need to provide a better value. \u00a0Don't rush us through, and provide better bottomless drinks. \u00a0If this meal was $25/person, it would probably be an easy 5-star experience. \u00a0But the value just was not there.",

I had some peach, raspberry, lemonade and whiskey concoction. Man was it good. So my gfs and I decided to sit in the lounge and try some drinks and some appetizers before we head out to dinner. We started off with a little bit of bubble while lounging on some luxurious leather couches and club chairs in the lounge area. Soooo comfy! The manager came over to greet us and welcome us to the place. Soo nice! The hostesses was sweet and inviting making sure that we were comfortable and she was really accomodating, even on a busy night.  Our cocktail waitress came over and was super sweet. Wish I knew her name, cuz her boss needs to know that she needs a raise..I'll remember to look for her next time I go over and I'll edit my review to include her name.  So for apps, we got the hushpuppies and the crabcakes. Both were absolutely delicious. We were brought some cornbread with a red pepper jelly and butter to start. Honestly, they were good, but not fabulous. A bit dry for my taste. But we MANAGED to polish off all 4. Haha... :) The hushpuppies came with a delicious aioli served in a ramekin quite delicious. The Crabcakes, had a nice cajun spice kick to them which made them faboo! LOVE THEM! They went perfectly with our glasses of champagne and were devoured within seconds of hitting the table.  Between the awesome, drinks, delicious food, and wonderful service, I will be definitely returning, if not to become a bar regular, then to have some dinner.

We were definitely way under-dressed with our jeans and flannels compared to the cocktail dresses and dress shirts sported by other patrons. This might be a soulfood joint, but nobody's dressed like it.   We went with the waiter's recommendations and he didn't disappoint. The cornbread, fried chicken, braised short ribs, and mac and cheese were all succulent, savory, and everything you want them to be. Though it's almost expected to be that good otherwise the price wouldn't be justified.   Solid food and solid service, but on the pricey side for what it is.",

The menu features items like black skillet fried chicken and white truffle mac 'n cheese -- all my favorite guilty pleasures, only upgraded bigtime.  What I didn't expect was how fancy 1300 On Fillmore would look, sort of like a hotel restaurant as opposed to your average hipster joint.  I expected to be shelling out at least $50-60 based on the appearance alone. Instead, my 3 friends and I shared a ton of dishes, and the bill came out to just $35/person. That bill includes the following:  - Bottle of Cabernet - Fluffy, salty/sweet cornbread, with honey butter and jalapeno jelly for dipping (complimentary) - Fried chicken with buttermilk whipped potatoes, pan gravy and chive herb biscuits - Slow poached crispy egg salad with garlic vinaigrette and blue cheese  - White truffle mac 'n cheese - Barbecue shrimp 'n grits - Pan roasted brussels sprouts - Three chocolate beignets  No joke. 1300 On Fillmore is unbelievably affordable if your group opts for eating family-style (which I'd highly recommend, given how heavy the dishes are) -- and the food is beyond phenomenal.  Every single one of the dishes named above is a must-order, but ESPECIALLY the barbecue shrimp 'n grits. I don't like shrimp. I don't like grits. Yet I was obsessed with this. Apparently it's often spotlighted on the Food Network and is the reason for this restaurant's fame. It also happens to be ideal for sharing.  Come here if you're ready to pig out.

I don't' mind paying $30 dollars for decent fried chicken and biscuit if the service and experience was great. But it was not and they left out the biscuit on my gf's entree! The male server didn't seem atentative at all. If anything he felt hurried somewhat. He did not ask how the food was and only time we got our drinks refilled was when we called for him as he walked past us.   It was a few minutes into our meal that we realize the biscuit was missing. I also requested a lil cake for my gf for her birthday and it never came! So pissed! I also notice the Chef only came out when he had to greet his \"people\". Not only once but twice but he didn't even acknowledge other customers nearby and walked passed us and didn't ask how how the food was or apologize for the missing biscuit. This can't be called fine din in any way because it's not even close.

    "review_text": "I almost feel badly giving just three stars - even though three stars is still \"A-OK\" - I really wanted to like this restaurant more than I did. I spent some time talking to the executive chef at the SF Chefs event about a month ago and was anxious to check out the restarurant. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. I should have known that any time you mix French and Southern styles, you are nearly guaranteed a waist-UN-friendly meal - however, I don't want the heaviness of a dish to essentiall hit me in the face...or gut I should say...and unfortunately, that's what it did.  I ordered the Shrimp and Grits as my main course. One positive aspect of thise restaurant is the portion sizes. They are pretty generous, especially for the appetizers. A appetizer of shrimp and grits is plenty for a dinner. Having gone to school in the South, I became acquainted with shrimp and grits and even had a stellar recipe for them that I would make at home. When I make them, they are rich, but not deadly. My first reaction to the shrimp and grits dish was, \"whoa, butter!\" Again, I expected butter but it was incredibly rich and unnecessarily so. Perhaps my palate has been spoiled by fresh California cuisine - but I found it to be slightly unjoyable while I was eating it, and even more so afterward while it sat in my stomach. I have to say, though, the shrimp was perfectly cooked and extremely flavorful. This dish would certainly please a palate more accustomed to heavier foods but it wasn't quite my style.  The cornbread also wasn't as good as I would have hoped. As others had said, it was a bit dry.   THE GOOD: Yes, this place definitely had some highlights. The drinks were quite good - I ordered a Pear Vodka with my favorite St. Germain, grapefruit and lemon - delicious. Also, I split the watermelon salad that had proscuitto, melon, mint, and balsamic. It was refreshing and nicely prepared. Service was attentive and the waitress was very nice. Also - I had a bite of the fried chicken which typically isn't my thing, but it was very flavorful and juicy - I was pleasantly surprised.  I'd like to give this place another try - but I think I'll stick to some of the lighter offerings and the cocktails!",

While I was blind-sighted and not prepared to pay over $200 for our dinner on a Wednesday night, the owner, Monetta and her husband chef David were most gracious to us (as we were seated in a full restaurant and would either have to eat the bill or leave to find dinner elsewhere) and asked us to stay and would comp one of our dinners so the pricing would be more similar to what we might pay for Dine About Town with drinks. We are so glad they did!  First of all, we enjoyed the decor, which was very contemporary, with modern furniture, chocolate, taupes, and muted violet, that also celebrated the historical jazz culture of the Fillmore. The lounge, bar, and dining room were well laid out.  The food really was excellent, with modern twists, nice plating and appropriate, if not generous portions of southern food that was prepared in a very upscale fashion. Although I wouldn't call it a light meal, it was definitely satisfying without everything being fried. My only major critiques were that the food was undersalted (unsalted?) and the ribeye steak was tough, although the flavor was good. Otherwise, really excellent. Wines were nice as well, and the vinter/winemaker family was there to chat with us personally and tell us about their wine.  Normally I wouldn't give 5 stars unless ALL the food was truly phenomenal, or had great value for price, but the hospitality of Monetta and David was truly overwhelming, especially in the initially awkward situation. I'll definitely be back to visit again!",

I e-mailed ahead of time and let them know just how special this day was to me and my family and everyone who replied promptly assured me that they would take care of my Mom.   Boy was I NOT disappointed!  We were promptly seated right at our 1:00 PM reservation and were waited on almost immediately. It is one of the most intimate brunch settings in San Francisco, but we had plenty of room to stretch out, laugh and celebrate.   I ended up ordering and devouring the most picturesque plate of Eggs Benedict I've ever laid eyes on. The Tabasco Hollandaise is the best I've had because it's not heavy handed and overtly salty, but I savored it's richness with every bite. To go along with this luxurious plate, I had the flakiest, softest Herb Biscuits on the face of this earth. Add a perfectly poached egg and two slices of Canadian Bacon and you have the perfect brunch treat.   Our host was very engaging and made my mother's first trip to 1300 very comfortable and even the amazing Monetta White surprised us by checking on our table twice! As much as we enjoyed the food, you MUST stay and enjoy the music.   The band featured two extremely talented singers that made American Idol look like Amateur Hour at the Apollo. I wish I got the name of the beautiful female singer who did Aretha Franklin sweet justice. She brought the house down and we were beyond impressed. The male singer and host was just as impressive and really engaged with the audience even getting my shy brother to sing a few bars!   My Mom has had a really hard time adjusting to the move here in Northern California, hardest adjustment was leaving behind her favorite Jazz club. For the first time since we stepped foot in the Bay Area she truly felt at home and I have Monetta White and the amazing staff at 1300 on Fillmore to thank. My Mom made me promise that we would do this brunch every single month with our family and friends and I didn't hesitate to agree. Thank you for showing us what class, fine dining and rich atmosphere should aspire to be.",

A lot of people might not notice 1300 On Fillmore at first, since it is right next to the famous Yoshi's.  My friends and I were seated at a round table for six which was really cool- the perfect table for a group because it is so much more conversational. The only thing was that I had a sore throat at the end of the night because I was talking so loud over the general noise in the restaurant all night! Looking at the acoustics in there I could see why it was so noisy, but it would be nice if it wasn't quite *so* loud (and I am not a person who minds loud!) I love the lighting fixtures in there as well!  We were welcomed by some yummy warm corn bread triangles nestled in a napkin, with sweet honey butter. YUM!   No nightly specials here.. the server mentioned that they just change up the menu fairly often.  My husband and I shared the Organic Baby Arugula salad which was way too small to share (I almost started laughing when it came out!) but it was delicious. A friend ordered the BBQ Shrimp &amp; Grits which was great.  For dinner I ordered the Pan Roasted Black Bass which was ok.. not stellar. My husband had the Maple Braised Short Ribs which literally melted off the bone. And it came with onion rings!  For desert, an amazing Banana Cream Pie.",

The food is soul food elegantly plated and pairs so well with easy going music. The lamb burger sliders were excellently executed. I only wish I was more hungry than I was. The place is richly appointed with wood and leather accoutrement accenting the dark ambiance which gives it an enveloping ambiance that dates back to Fillmore's Jazz history.   My cousin meets up with me for some drinks and we pass the night away catching up on recent events and other summer fun! Nothing like makers and coke to set the night right. I have to admit that the pear goose n tonic is quite the cocktail despite my previous misgivings.  Thank you bff for the heads up! ;D",

They have a lounge area where they had live jazz which is cozy. But it's really about the food. Finally got to try fired green tomatoes which came with deep friend goat cheese with a lavendar sauce. Super tasty. I ordered the braised short ribs with herb mashed potatoes and she got the fried chicken. \u00a0The short ribs required no knife and the fried chicken was good too. Had a some spices we couldn't figure out. She thought it might have been a touch of curry but not sure. I'm no wine officionado but they had a list of wines by the bottle that were in the 30 to 40 dollar range and obviously some more expensive ones too but for a novice wine drinker like me that is perfect. Wanted to try desert but was too stuffed. The service was awsome too. Our waiter I guess had some big order but we didn't even notice he was gone that long but the manager came over to take our order and at the end of the meal we were just sitting and talking after the bill came the waiter came over and offered a glass of wine of the same wine we had at dinner. So man great service great upscale soul food. Definitely will go back for dinner or even just coctails.",

As I walked to my table, I really dug the ambiance. \u00a0It definitely has an air of sophistication to the decor, but there was a liveliness to the patrons that kept it from being stuffy. \u00a0Our server George was spot on with everything. \u00a0He really took the whole service with a smile adage to a new level. \u00a0It's amazing how much better your experience gets when you have a happy, attentive server.  And finally the food. \u00a0OMFG, the freaking food. \u00a0I ordered the braised short rib, which was described to me as fall of the bone. \u00a0 You hear this term often, yet it doesn't always live up to the billing. \u00a0I literally pulled the bone right off the meat when my plate arrived. \u00a0One clean pull, with no trace of meat left on the bone. \u00a0THAT'S how you do it! \u00a0Others at the table got the fried chicken (sooooo good) and the ribeye steak, which they raved about as well. \u00a0Unfortunately, we were too stuffed for dessert, which just gives me another reason to go back there soon. \u00a0There's definitely a peach cobbler with my name on it when I come back.",

I haven't had such great soul food since I've been to Houston, and even then it wasn't as good. The restaurant is perfect for the neighborhood. It fits in with that historical jazzy feel. The decor and design is also beautiful. The comfy leather booth couches against the window are amazing and the lighting adds to the dark rich ambiance of the restaurant.   Unfortunately our service didn't match the high expectations of the restaurant. Our server had an attitude like she had so many better things to do then serve us. She was not polite, she rushed us, and let the food come out too fast (our appetizers came out before our bottle of champagne, which we asked for first). She didn't seem to care that our meal was going to be +400$, she still gave us the impression that she was waisting her time with us. There was one very cute server in the restaurant though, and I'm kind of disappointed that we didn't get him.   Now my favorite part... The FOOD! We had the mac and cheese and the grits for our appetizer. The mac and cheese was a little too spicy for me (I have a sensitive mouth) but the grits were amazing! So gooood. They also give you cornbread that is to die for.. For our main course I shared the Maple Syrup Beef Short Ribs and the Organic Fried Chicken. Both were mouthwatering. The short ribs fell off the bone and the chicken was so juicy and tender. I would definitely recommend either dish.. I wish I could remember the name of our wine, because it was perfectly paired with our meal. I recommend asking the sommelier (or wine steward) \u00a0for a great wine pairing with your food because he did a fantastic job with ours. I can't wait to come back here, the dishes were great, the portions are huge, and the decor is beautiful. I definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner out.  HINT FOR ALL YOU GUYS: This is a gorgeous restaurant that I would recommend taking any girl to for a special occasion. It's romantic and classy.. SO I hope you all get the hint!!!!",

In my lil foodie world, i'm seeking the delicates of the refined flavor, petite bite which screams \"innovative! organic! mouth-ride!\" That said, flavors and food here was too rich n' fryer-friendly to inspire much of the above. I did like the 2nd course available only this month of crab with fennel.. like a beacon in the dark! And while I may be on the far-end-of-health-nut spectrum, even friends who tore into fried chicken with the rush of red-blooded cajun felt food was playing \"safe\": lacking in either astounding classic rendition or that somethin' special that brings you back in.  The location is fun, and the atmosphere festive. We'd hoped (and thought was advertised?) live jazz, but down the street plenty to be had later. Service was diligent and attentive to be sure.

That was the short form, here's the poop:  The room is beautiful, yet awkwardly designed. \u00a0Way too long to feel comfortable, with the \"private room\" behind sliding glass doors, and many different chair styles, the place feels as if it were designed by committee.  When we arrived at the hostess table, she was occupied with someone else. \u00a0We told her we'd be in the bar and come to get us when our reservation time had arrived.   We had a drink in the bar.. The bartender was aloof and not very friendly. \u00a0When the hostess came to take us to our table, no offer was made to transfer the bill, nor was any effort made to take our drinks for us to the table. \u00a0  The hostess sat us near the front door and so we asked to be moved. \u00a0She huffed and went away, a few minutes later she reseated us.  The appetizers were very well prepared, but a tad expensive for what they were - five fried shrimp and a mayo-based dipping sauce (the menu said \"ancho chile remoulade\" it seemed like thousand island to me) for $13 and five smaller shrimp and a dollop of grits (really, really good) also for $13.  The mains were fine - vertically stacked short ribs, onion rigs in a way too sugary maple glaze, and a huge plate of fried chicken with biscuits and truffled mashed potatoes - but not inspired, inspirational or anything beyond \"fine\" . \u00a0  For upwards of $30 per plate, I expect best in class, too cool for school , or fabulous, not \"fine.\"",

    "review_text": "Perhaps if I had grown up in the deep south I would find the notion of upscale comfort/soul food as absurd as some of the other reviewers. But I didn't. I grew up in Europe. We didn't have mac 'n' cheese. And our only notion of the American south was vended us by Hollywood.   Therefore, naturally, since coming to the US, I've become a huge fan of soul food. However I am forced to enjoy it with no cultural baggage. Fortunately this means I can enjoy the excellent food at 1300 on Fillmore without worrying about what it all means. So here's the lowdown: The fried chicken is superb. The short ribs are delicious. The mac 'n' cheese was a guilty pleasure. And the shrimp hush puppies are one of the most delicious things I've eaten in a long time. My enjoyment of them was enhanced by the fact that ordering them helped me figure out what the hell \"hush puppies\" actually are... \u00a0Oh, and the drinks are tasty too, and the atmosphere is friendly, relaxed and yet not overly casual.   Word of warning: portions are not small. We failed to finish our food, and had no room left for dessert, which is a shame since they seemed well worth trying.   I will certainly return to 1300 on Fillmore.",

Perfect for a cold night.  1300 Fillmore \u00a0gives a nice homage to the cultural heritage of the city and the place was filled with very well-heeled Buppies. \u00a0In terms of soul food, it was twice as good as Front Porch (which isn't bad) and about ten times as good as Elite Cafe (which I found disppointing).

    "review_text": "First of all, I love the decor. It looks like an old school gentlman's club (no, not that kind, the kind that you'd see in a Merchant and Ivory film where men drink single-malt scotch). \u00a0  And the music, while loud (making it hard if you are trying to have a conversation), was excellent.  So I would come back to enjoy drinks and conversation. \u00a0And that is the only reason I gave it a 2nd star.  The food however, is not good. \u00a0I'm rapidly coming to realize that you cannot believe reviews of regional foods when it comes to restaurants in NoCal. \u00a0If it's not from the Asian continent or south of the border, the reviewers seem to lack the palette to know what they are talking about. \u00a0Asking a Californian to judge soul food would be like asking Helen Keller to judge an art competition. \u00a0I've yet to have a truly satisfactory culinary experience out here here that didn't involve ramen, sushi, or curry.  1300 on Fillmore is no exception. I'm about 150% Southern (parents, grandparents, great-grandparents from Alabama, and then it loops back on itself b/c some great greats were from Kentucky, which is where I was raised). So a lot of \"soul\" food, southern food, and other comfort food restaurants get a big side-eye from me, even in places where people know how to cook them. Now in some places, they can get it right...Atlanta, Detroit, southside of Chicago. \u00a0Here they don't know what they are doing.  So the food here was not good. \u00a0I could not figure out what was going on with the \"fried\" chicken. \u00a0Even if you want to be all California about it and take off the skin, it can be done MUCH better than what they passed off as fried chicken. The biscuits were dry and not tender (buttermilk anyone?)  My opinion is that some things shouldn't be healthy. \u00a0If you want to be healthy, then just don't eat those things. \u00a0But don't butcher them by leaving out the things that make up their very essence.  And even though there were supposed to be refills, I got exactly ONE mimosa for my $12. \u00a0I'm not sure why the waitress couldn't be bothered to bring me another, or re-fill my water glass again.  But yeah, if you want southern/soul food, don't go to anyplace in San Francisco expecting to be pleased. \u00a0Thank goodness I can make it myself when the mood strikes.  I think the soul food should be left to people who aren't afraid to \"put their foot in it\" as we say down south!",

Our waiter and our neighbor's waiter asked us if we wanted more cornbread lol! (I'm sure they knew the bread was on it!) the waiter put our food in a Togo box....AND gave us fresh cornbread Togo!

Anywhere that starts you off with cornbread gets an automatic star from me. I took everyone's reviews to heart and forced someone in my party to get the fried chicken, and it was amazing! The truffle mashed potatoes that come with it really complement the dish. We also got the brussel sprouts, which are mouth-watering, and the shrimp hush puppies (which are more like fried shrimp than hush puppies, but are yummy nonetheless.) The bass and the lamb are also excellent choices, and the beignets for dessert are fantastic!  After dinner, I ran into a group of women in the ladies room, and they were commenting on how full they were, but how glad they had been that they came. I thought to myself, \"that's exactly how I feel.\" What a great place for reflection - gotta love the ladies room!",

    "review_text": "The dinner here was awesome from the very first bite. The fried okra was not slimey at all. The cornmeal breading wasn't sticking very well to the okra but the appetizer was still delicious. We devoured the warm cornbread. The jalapeno jam served with it surprisingly had no heat, just sweetness. I probably could have substituted honey and not tasted a difference. We also had the shrimp &amp; grits as a 2nd appetizer. The grits were creamy. Also important, it didn't sit like lead in my tummy afterwards. We had dueling forks at the table, it was that good.   Two of us ordered cocktails. While they were both generous pours, the cocktails were just ok. One, the key lime was too sour.  We ordered the short ribs, red snapper with corn succotash and catfish with jambalaya for our entrees. The short ribs was the runaway hit. This became a dish to share. Succulent and tender. Didn't really need a knife to cut it. The red snapper was tasty with a nice &amp; crispy skin but the succotash was the highlight. This was like eating the freshest, sweetest tasting corn straight from the farm but more elegant and easier than eating corn-on-the-cob. The catfish was my favorite of the 2 fish. Nice, meaty texture. It didn't have that strong fishy normally associate with catfish.  For dessert, we shared the banana cream tart &amp; peach cobbler. The tart was good but the dough used for the crust was not flaky at all. It was hard as a rock and we had difficulty cutting it, even with a knife. The caramel sauce was to die for. The cobbler was ok but again, it was the crust that disappointed. While flaky, it could have used a bit more sweetness. It was also very dry.  Service was very attentive. Hip &amp; trendy vibe but not intimidating. There were some minor execution errors but I'm quibbling. Nothing to keep me from coming back. Overall this is a keeper.",

ORIGINAL REVIEW: \u00a0just dined here for the first time last week, and really enjoyed it. \u00a0i see a natural comparison between 1300 and spruce. both recently opened, with the goal of having upscale cuisine with a lively bar/lounge atmosphere. \u00a0where spruce seems poorly laid out and overwhelmed by its crowd, 1300 was as smooth and comfortable as the jazz music in the background.  the food was good across the board. we started with the bbq shrimp &amp; grits... very solid. that and the cornbread easily got us to the main course.  then i had the bouillabaisse... delicious broth and plenty of delicious seafood. the mussels were only OK, but the huge chunks of lobster, crab, and fish were wonderful. \u00a0  the wife had the short ribs... \u00a0a menu item that in my experience always seems to be well-hyped but strangely underperforms. 1300's did not... \u00a0perfectly-cooked, tender and delicious. the mashed potatoes were average, and felt like a natural candidate to get dressed up a bit like many of the other sides on the menu.  speaking of which, we got the braised greens and the mac n' cheese. the greens were fine, but the addition of the sweet onions made them better. \u00a0the mac was SO good... \u00a0very rich with the white cheddar, and a big portion. a light eater could easily get by on a salad or shrimp app and the mac and cheese.  the service was top notch, and we also loved the atmosphere... \u00a0lively, but because the bar and lounge area are separated by high partitions the volume didn't prevent us from having a conversation and a normal level.",

Did that make since? \u00a0I guess what I'm saying 1300 has never been a hit or miss for me.   Last night for dine about town and it was a total miss in the dining room. \u00a0The host was seating, taking orders, and pouring water. He was just all over a place. \u00a0Maybe someone didn't come into work or something because service was slow.   The Dine About Town menu was pretty lame in my opinion. I understand have a select items for a pre-fixed menu but here was only 1 item for starter, entree, and dessert. So I pretty much skipped over that and ordered my favorites.   The shrimp n grits came out hot and ready to go but after that dinner took a few extra minutes to come out and not hot. The food didn't have to be piping hot but hot enough so that I can still feel some heat coming off the plate. This is the first time I didn't enjoy my dinner.   Now it wasn't all bad, the bar was awesome that pretty much saved the night for me and my guest. Dessert was pretty good and Nikki at the bar made excellent and conversation with us and the other bar patrons.   Not to worry though 1300 is still awesome it just one not so good night for me but others were having a great time and I'm sure when I go again I'll have a great dining experience again.",

Warm Chocolate Beignets. Oh. My. God. And they serve them with this odd coffee soda (foam), but it's the perfect accompaniment!

A dinner before mass humiliation requires cocktails, and these were quite good... pomegranate mojitos, pear blossoms, and lots of other unique options. The food was some of the best southern cuisine I've had in the Bay Area. Extremely rich, but then southern food usually is right? We tried a ton of things among the group. The favorite was the mushroom risotto. The fried okra was also very good. Fried chicken was so filling, even splitting we couldn't finish. It was nice that they serve it boned but I wasn't as impressed by it as I thought I'd be given all the raves. The mac and cheese is spicy! I like spice, but in this case it just kinda took over the flavor of the dish. I'd go back, get a cocktail and have the risotto and be more than happy. A good option for pairing with the Fillmore/Yoshi's/Japantown adventures.",

I was there on 2/12; visiting SanFran for a month from S Florida, and needed some soul food!  I had the baby arugula salad and a nice chardonnay to start. Very tasty - great portion size. 2nd course, I enjoyed (immensely) the short ribs. They were meaty and very satisfying. The mashed potatoes were really ridiculously delish, and I ordered a side of the greens, which despite being very vinegary - I had a hard time putting my fork down.   I had a NICE pour of Syrah with my 2nd course. Finished the evening talking to 2 guys who were entertaining and mildly deranged as they devoured their food: the bisque and the fat fries (both of which were yummy), and one had the lamb (cooked WELL - what?!?!?), and finished with the chocolate cake, which he was literally crying over it was so good.  The bartender Brittany was superb - a little rushed at first - perhaps she is used to a faster paced service? - but I was there for the long haul, so, I told her to be easy. Smart girl, and very easy to talk to. She made me two killer martinis . . . my total bill was $90, including a 20% tip. NOT BAD!!  The chef/owner stopped by to chat, which was nice.   As I am always looking for black-owned businesses to support, I was glad this was not only upscale, but with good service, superb food, and a wonderful ambiance. In fact, I am taking myself there for dinner tonight!!! OMG - my mouth just watered. I am not kidding!",

    "review_text": "1300 On Fillmore is one of those places to go to cross off your checklist and nothing else. Decor and ambiance over shines the food at 1300 on Fillmore.  My friends and I came here last Saturday. We arrived at 7:55 PM for reservations at 8 PM and were seated in about 10 minutes.  FOOD: *Cornbread: The cornbread arrived lukewarm in individual triangle blocks. It was not good at all; dry, dense, and had a very grainy texture. The honey butter didn't help as the bread wasn't warm enough to melt the butter. *Ribs w/ Mac &amp; Cheese and Jalapeno Slaw: The ribs were cooked N. Carolina style w/ a dry rub and sauce on the side. Although the ribs were very tender (fall of the bone), I can't say that all pieces were. The rib tips; the portion attached to the lower section of ribs were overcooked and dry. The ribs had great flavor from the rub and the sauce on the side added a great zing and slight heat. The mac &amp; cheese was SUPER YUMMY, although they give you a very small portion in sauce size bowl. It was made with a white cheddar cheese and was super creamy and had toasted bread crumbs throughout and baked on top. Jalapeno slaw was meh. I didn't taste any jalapeno and the slaw wasn't dressed properly. There wasn't enough vinaigrette to coat the slaw, so the acid didn't break down the cabbage which made the texture hard and bitter.   DRINK:  *Sweet Tea (alcoholic): It was ok, it tasted exactly like honey lemon tea and had too much citrus flavor for my taste. Couldn't really taste the vodka.   SERVICE: Our waiter was very friendly and nice. However, because the restaurant was really busy that night, we did have to flag him down to get our orders and bill. Perhaps understaffed.  CROWD: Older sophisticated crowd; late 30s to 50's.   AMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: WOW! Kudos to the interior designer who managed to create a thoughtful, warm, stunning, and beautiful restaurant/lounge. As you walk through the huge wooden doors, I was amazed to see a restaurant like this situated in the 'Mo. The main dining room is stunning with gray walls and curtains. The high ceilings have hanging etched spot lights. I love the tree branches in the corner as it gave a wintery feel. The highlight of place has to be the lounge which is artfully decorated with a wall compiled of old jazz pictures that light up.   The restaurant gets LOUD, so keep that in mind, if you're going to bring a date here.   Not sure if the food itself will warrant a return visit. Again, I'm glad at least I can check this off my checklist.",

I had the fried chicken, believe me, it's worth the 20 minute wait...as is the souffle (order em when you while you're ordering appetizers, it will be timed well!) The wine was also great. While this is high end fare, the price, for two, including appetizers, bottle of wine, and a dessert, VERY reasonable...not CHEAP, but given the nature of the fare, reasonable.  I look forward to going back, and to having a jazz band on site! Highly recommend. mmmm memories of sweet potato souffle. Yumalicious!",

My fiance and I came on a Sunday night and the space was about halfway full, but with all the seating in the front half of the dining room. \u00a0It was surprisingly loud, given the number of diners. \u00a0Our hostess seated us immediately and left us with the menus, but it took quite some time for our waitress to arrive. \u00a0Once we put in our drink orders they appeared very quickly, but we waited yet again for our waitress to take our orders. \u00a0This would be a theme of the night - every employee of 1300 was incredibly quick and efficient, with the exception of our waitress.  The DAT menu offered a watermelon salad, a choice of hangar steak or petrale sole for the entree, and a strawberry \"shortcake\" for dessert. \u00a0I opted for the DAT menu with the sole, and my fiance ordered off the regular menu - artichoke with poached egg for appetizer and their baby back rib special for entree.  The appetizers were very good - I especially loved the interesting flavor combinations in my salad. \u00a0The salad included watermelon, pickled watermelon rind, and feta cheese, which I had never tasted in combination before.  The petrale sole was great as well, and came with some wilted chard, mashed potatoes, and the delicious balls of flavor that are capers. \u00a0The sole was light, yet flavorful in a way I can never hope to replicate in my home kitchen. \u00a0The capers (with browned butter support) really made this dish, though.  My fiance's ribs came with abundant accoutrements (two sauces, a slaw, and mac and cheese), but the ribs themselves were a little bland. \u00a0These ribs are rubbed and smoked, but you really need the sauces to introduce serious flavor.  Dessert, while not overwhelming with flavor, was a nice, light end to dinner. \u00a0The strawberry \"shortcake\" consisted of triangles of shortbread, strawberries, and \u00a0puffs of whipped cream with strawberry puree, balsamic syrup, and whiffs of basil as well.",

While the food was decent and the musicians were very talented, we received pretty abysmal service. Consider yourself lucky if you haven't seen me waiting on supremely delayed food, because I can turn into a hangry mofo (especially while nursing a Sunday morning hangover). My dining companions were not as lucky. We waited for over 30 minutes to place our orders (and even then, only because someone at our table waved our waiter over), and then our food didn't arrive for another 30 minutes or so. The party of two next to ours, which was seated much later, had already received their food by the time we were able to place our orders.  When the time came for the bill, we asked for split checks. We mistakenly assumed this wouldn't come as a surprise, since we asked the waiter to split our checks before he took our orders, and he said he would \"be able to help [us] out.\" Instead, he very precisely informed us, \"I can help you figure out how much each of you owe, if you can't figure out how to do it yourselves.\" Apparently he didn't realize that splitting checks is not quite the same as insulting the table's quantitative literacy.  I might come back here again since everyone else seemed to be having a good time, but never with a party of more than 4.

Fried Fulton Valley chicken: large hearty portions, definitely not for the faint hearted. This dish came with mashed potatoes and biscuits. The mashed potatoes was a little dry and needed more gravy.   2. Mac 'N Cheese: very good and didn't feel too overwhelmed.  3. Fat Fries with housemade ketchup: these are sooooo good! They were spiced just right.  4. Black Sea Bass: portion was a little small.   5. Banana Cream Pie: this was dubbed as the best dessert in the house. This was, indeed. Thin flaky crust with a very creamy base and fresh chopped bananas with a dribble of caramel on top of the plate. It was off the hook.  I was very happy with our selections. I love the cornbread with its honey butter and jalapeno jelly! Despite we had a grub fest at our table, our server Seth was very helpful and attentive.   The hostess was wonderful and made sure we were comfortable and offered us to get some drinks at the bar before our reservations. We were quite early.   The ambiance was top notch and made me feel I was a part of the Jazz Era, dark woods, lit photographic walls, a jazz and blues band played in house. Everything from the light fixtures, the drapery panels, the carpet to the leather furniture was simply unforgettable. I loved it.   There's public parking in the garage; we paid a flat rate of $12. It was a treat to enjoy some cocktails in the lounge area and lavish on a few gourmet soul comfort food.   Experience it for yourself; it'll be worth the trip.",

The short ribs, fried chicken and corn bread was very delicious. The short ribs were super tender. The macaroni and cheese was ok. The shrimp and grits were interesting; I wasn't expecting the chucks of garlic in it. The service was wonderful. I will be returning.",

    "review_text": "I have a Pavlovian reaction to grits. I hear the word \"grits\" and I start salivating. I love me some grits. I like them boiled simply with water and salt, I like them with melted butter, I like them cheesy, I like them creamy, I like grits on its own, I like it with a side of bacon or ham, I like it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. But by far my favorite (before tonight) were the shrimp and grits I had in Charleston, South Carolina - buttery grits topped with barbecue shrimp in its own gravy.   Whenever I find grits on a menu outside the deep South (and especially in NorCal), I will order it just because I'm happy to see it on the menu. Before tonight, I was a bit disappointed by the grits offerings in SF.   But tonight I discovered what has to be the best grits this side of the Mississippi....and perhaps the best grits on planet earth. The barbecue shrimp and grits at 1300 on Fillmore are TO DIE FOR. Creamy, perfectly cooked grits topped with succulent, savory shrimp, gravy, diced tomatoes and fried garlic slivers. It is a bowl of culinary perfection.   The fried green tomato salad with goat cheese and honey-lavender dressing was also excellent, as was the warm cornbread wedges with honey butter and sweet red pepper marmalade. The fried chicken was juicy and tender and the portion was very generous. I thought the mac n' cheese was disappointingly bland, but this was the only flaw, and one I can happily overlook in my ecstatic glee at discovering this awesome restaurant, which I will definitely be visiting many many many many times in the future. I also love the subdued but classy decor - and I'm loving the revamped area of the Western Addition!  Did I mention the amazing grits?  postscript: I just looked at my receipt and noticed an additional 4% service charge for \"SF Health\" - the surcharge restaurants are charging so that patrons pick up the healthcare tab of their employees instead of paying it themselves. BOOOOOO!!",

    "review_text": "I expected a lot more. The environment was ridiculously loud, I could barely hear the person sitting across from me. The food was so lacking in flavor and originality. Around the table we ordered 2 portions of the special, which was a full rack of ribs, catfish dish, and i got the braised short ribs.  I think the catfish dish was okay, but my short ribs were only so-so and something I could easily make at home. It was fall off the bone tender but there was no flavor despite the \"maple syrup\" label on the menu. The mashed potatoes were also flavorless and below par. So disappointing for a $27 item.  What was not fall of the bone, was the rack of ribs. They were also really bland except for the sauces which you had to dip in. They were not juicy or tender or marinated at all. \u00a0Don't bother with the ribs. It looks impressive when it arrives at the table but my bf who never wastes food didn't even want to take the leftovers home.   1 star for being able to get a reservation the day of on a Saturday. 1 star for their truffle mac and cheese.  I didn't try the desserts even thought i wanted to. Maybe that would have made the experience better.",

    "review_text": "I want to preface this review that I really wanted to like this place. \u00a0As I'm rolling through the yelp reviews and the two star description says it all - \"Meh, I've experienced better\"  I went with friends after work - we had an amazing dinner a couple weeks before where my co-foodies and I had a great time at Wayfare Tavern and the fried chicken they ordered (and I didn't) was still on my mind. \u00a0  We were on a quest for fried chicken and Wayfare was booked.  \"The one known as Stella\" suggested 1300 (she confessed later that she had a douchey date here before and the food was good) and so reso's were made and away we went.  The restaurant is very nice looking - think dark, a little sexy and inevitably a little hipsterish. \u00a0We were seated immediately (The tables are close together, so much so that our guest of honor (Lund) kept getting bumped as the server walked past. \u00a0We ended up just shifting the table over ourselves - problem solved).  Ok, enough, on to the food (and drinks).  We started out with a round of cocktails - Stella and Lund went a little generic with a glass of Merlot and a gin and tonic. \u00a0I went with what they are supposed to be famous for - the Manhattan (our server told me they do Maker's Manhattan's and asked me if that was ok - it was a nice touch, but just a little pretentious?) \u00a0Theresa went with a specialty cocktail - something flowery; but, it was good.  For starters:  - Pork belly (with a bourbon sauce that was more mapley than bourboney) - there was a very small piece of pork belly that we practically fought over, a ton of sauce and rounded out with some butter beans. \u00a0This dish was really disappointing, it was ok; but, nothing amazing knock your socks off. \u00a0Let's face it - pork belly is an extravagance, anything made with it should be like \"YES\". \u00a0this wasn't. \u00a0 - We also got the mussels - the sauce stole the show here, so good. \u00a0Other than that, it was just mussels.  For entrees: - Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes. \u00a0This was a very good rendition of fried chicken. \u00a0There were three boneless pieces (is something missed if you can't pick up a leg - just saying) and they all had a nice crust (Lund is from the ATL and he took his fork and gave my chicken a smack when it was set down and gave his approval of the crunch) and were very moist. \u00a0Again, it was good chicken, but for $25 it should be knock yourself off amazing good - that it wasn't.  - Maple Syrup Braised Short Ribs. \u00a0I didn't like this dish at all. \u00a0It was cooked wonderfully, fall apart tender; however, for me - it didn't work. \u00a0I thought it was too sweet and too mapley and not enough savory. \u00a0If you like maple syrup, you very well may love this dish.  - Day Boat Scallops, \u00a0Lund didn't share a damn bite of these at all, so I have nothing to report - other than he cleaned his plate.  Whew - this is a long review, congrats if you're still here. \u00a0The bill came to about $215 for 4 entrees, 2 apps, a side (brussels sprouts - they were ok, nothing great) and 4 drinks. \u00a0I can honestly say I'll most likely not come back.",

The mac&amp;cheese left MUCH to be desired, like some actual cheese! Fries were the thick, steak cut style but since my Irishman liked em, who's to argue with an Irishman and potatoes? House ketchup was great though.  I ordered their friend chicken, soo good! A hefty portion too, I only ate about half and let everyone else pick at it. My friend got their burger which was pretty tasty, but came with this relish/sauce thing that seemed overly sweet to go with a burger. Her date and mine both ordered the short ribs...AVOID! To quote my date \"It's the most expensive thing on the menu, and the smallest portion!\" And bland too!! Imagine a mound of short ribs, the size of a tangerine.   Our waiter (whose name I don't remember) was incredibly attentive and accommodating, took one of the short ribs off our bill when we said how underwhelming they were. For 4 people with drinks, apps, and no dessert it was about $150.",

    "review_text": "I have some seriously mixed emotions about this place. The food is awesome (and I'll get to that in a moment), but the heavy smell of the destructive gentrification of the Fillmore was a little much for me. The \"Jazzy, Sexy, Historic, Classic, Elegant\" vibe they're shooting for (check the website) reminds me a lot of the Fillmore District as it was long before my time, full of musicians, working class families, affordable jazz clubs, and an actual community. I guess that's what 1300 is designed to celebrate, though I can't escape the feeling that its existence takes the Fillmore one step further from the way it used to be. But I digress....  My ex-girlfriend took me here for my birthday shortly after the place opened, as I am a lover of fried chicken. Turns out these meals can get pretty emotional, and things started to fall apart over some delicious braised pork belly. As a Jew, pork belly is about as far over my line of \"that's not so far beyond being Kosher that I can't make up for it later in life\" as anything, but the lady loves her some tender meat, and so we got it. So guiltily delicious. No regrets.  For dinner, the lady had the Maple Syrup Glazed Short Ribs. Again, super tender and flavorful, but not too much. The fried chicken, our raison d'etre (which I probably just misspelled, but tough shit), was so moist and succulent that I almost didn't notice the emotional chaos going on throughout the meal. I must say, having never before sat through such a dramatic and uncomfortable moment in a restaurant (and I'm not assessing blame, just saying it was an all-around dramatic moment), with that \"everyone's looking at me and thinks I'm an asshole\" feeling, I imagine that very few plates of food motivate one to weather the storm. This one did.   Skipped dessert (too much storm!), waiter was weird, would come back, but feel like part of the gentrification and a bad Jew. I know. It's a bit neurotic.",

    "review_text": "Well, I finally made it to 1300. First I walked in and I was in love with the decor. I received a warm welcome, from the manager, a warm welcome from the staff, and a horrible glare from the poorly dressed, self important yuppies in the corner of the lounge area. One of whom mentioned to some one at the top of her lungs that she is one of the owners of District so you know I will not be going there. It amazes me that this new era of white people, with new money think that they are the only ones allowed to experience food in San Francisco. This has nothing to do with the restaurant, but when you walk into a place and are overwhelmed with those kind of assholes as your co-patrons, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It's like going to your favorite club and those suburban guys with bad hair cuts and shiny shirts are there drinking Bud Light and aggresively trying to hit on you. Well they were so ridiculous and pretentious, that I decided to make them a source of entertainment while I waited for the rest of my party. I had no choice but to listen their conversation since they did not know the meaning of using their inside voice. While they shouted their pretense to every one at 1300, I smirked at them like they were fools who did not know the secret, while the one who owned District looked at me with a great deal of discomfort. Either she knew I thought she was lame or she was afraid I was going to steal her dated designer bag (I am after all black) At least I know how to keep my self busy.   The manager told me they were out of the rabbit and fried chicken. I joked that I was appalled and I was leaving, we laughed and the District lady really looked irritated.   So finally my party showed up. We were all seated at our table and the manager was pleasant and made us feel very welcome.  Let me just mention that I was with my cousins and my one cousin's boyfriend, who is a major star in the NFL, so I think that this seriously affected the service we got. Our server was very nice but also very unprofessional. He kept ease dropping in personal conversation to add his two cents and hitting on my cousin (the single one). \u00a0I mentioned to him that with his voice, he should do radio or voice over work. I never should have said anything. He went on about how he has a sports radio talk show and he kept trying to build a re pore w/ my cousin's boyfriend who was not interested in talking about his career as an athlete. He wanted to have a nice dinner with family. The vibe w/ our server went from \"oh he's nice\" to \"he's annoying and no one asked him to co-sign\". At one point we were talking, to eachother, about having a child at forty and he decided to tell us about his fertile aunt who had 5 kids after 35. It was really weird, and all of a sudden there was an awkward silence. My cousin's boyfriend did not like him. But he's a nice guy so he did not say anything. I think that sometimes with sports nuts they feel like they can have an odd type of casualness with professional athletes that they would not have with others. Time and time again I have seen people go up to my cousin's boyfriend and talk to him about his stats and football like they know him and can be as casual as they want. They tell him what is wrong with his career, his team mates and the NFL in general as if they can say it on authority. It is really \u00a0weird.  Then our food came, not that great. \u00a0The cornbread was very dry to the point that I choked on it and had a coughing fit. My cousin and I shared the poached egg and cabbage salad. The blue cheese overwhelmed it. To the point where I had to grimace. The brussel sprouts tasted like mustard and were not cooked properly. \u00a0My beef tenderloin was good but the greens, had absolutely no flavor. At this point I really needed salt and I could not find any one to ask for assistance in the purveying of such salt. Let me add that I do not use a lot of salt. The sign of a good chef is not having to add salt or pepper. What ever starch was with it, I did not like. It tasted like maybe it could have been cheese grits w/ blue cheese and the fact that I cannot tell you what it was is also disturbing. The mac and cheese was no bueno, but my cousin liked it. Our desert was alright, chocolate begniets w/ coffee soda were forgettable. Then our server came over with his shirt untucked, his back pack on and no vest or tie to thank us and pick up the check. He explained that it was Easter and he had had a long night. \u00a0We were all very surprised. \u00a0I can understand he was tired but why would he tell us that? As we left, the chef came out and thanked us, the manger thanked us and asked us to come again and our server hit on my cousin again. At which point I teased about her new boyfriend. So I don't know how I feel about this place. I was not impressed but something tells me I should give it another chance. Maybe I will.",

I started with the poached egg salad, which was to die for. Cabbage, dressed perfectly, with plenty of bacony goodness throughout. My boyfriend had the sweetbreads...good, but not the best I've ever had (that honor goes to Les Amis). For entrees, I had the black bass with salsify, which was cooked perfectly. Boyfriend had the fried chicken. WOW. That shit is addictive! Best fried chicken I've ever had. We had a delicious bottle of Tin Barn Zinfandel, for a very reasonable price.  Service was impeccable. Attentive, professional, and personable. Loved the atmosphere, and the lounge had a live jazz band that night.

So forgive me when I describe 1300 on Fillmore as 'FIERCE!' \u00a0What an amazing experience. \u00a0Thank you, George, for being one of the best waiters I've ever had here in SF. \u00a0If you get a chance, request George. He'll steer you in the right direction and you won't be disappointed.  So, let's get started. \u00a0How about some home made cocktails and a lovely glass of wine while we take in the masterfully decorated main room. Warm, cozy, comfy, open and roomy. \u00a0And anyone looks good under this lighting. \u00a0Even the front doors ask you to touch them \u00a0and feel their texture.  I got my drink on (Hangar One Martini, thank you!). Now I wanted some of this Pork Belly I kept hearing about. \u00a0Me? I loved it. Downed my entire portion in 5.2 seconds only coming up for breath once. I don't make a habit of consuming pure pig fat on a regular basis. But, when it's done right, you gotta just dig in.  For our mains, I ordered the AMAZING Maple Syrup Braised Beef Short Ribs with Buttermilk Chive Mash Potatoes (and two onion rings to top it all off). \u00a0I ate every morsel on my plate. Fierce. Hot Mess. Tranny!  My partner (here for his birthday) ordered the amazing fried chicken. Yes, the fried chicken is $21, but it's Fulton Valley Chicken (believe me, you can taste the difference). And it came with truffle whipped potatoes and home made gravy, plus home made skillet Corn Bread with a sweet and mild jalapeno jelly and a side of honey cream butter. \u00a0To Die For! Tranny Fierce!   As an encore, our fabulous waiter, George, brought out the Chocolate Beignets with Chocolate Dipping Sauce and a side of Chocolate Soda (sort of like long shaped warm donuts with a side of warm chocolate sauce for dipping). And on the side of the plate, written in chocolate - in cursive - were the words \"Happy Birthday.\" \u00a0I didn't even have to ask for that. It's little things like that that made our experience at 1300 one of the best in San Francisco.  It so wonderful to see this area getting some much needed financial help, new developments, condos, Yoshis and now 1300 on Fillmore.   I can't wait to go back - if not for the food, then to experience the San Francisco Jazz history that adorns the walls.  Every Jazz aficionado...head to the cozy lounge area, grab a seat in the lounge or at the bar, and look lovingly at our local jazz history.",

After seeing the cocktail list, our mood improved slightly. \u00a0This is a place with some interesting offerings. \u00a0We had the Corpse Reviver No. 2 \u00a0( I passed up The Last Word with some reluctance as well ) and my companion the Kaffir Lime Gimlet. \u00a0We were both impressed with the quality of the citrus and the clean flavors.  Further improvements were had going over the menu: a fried green tomato salad ( somewhat tough little fried green tomatoes, but beautiful breaded, fried balls of goat cheese and lavendar honey. \u00a0Our request for dressing on the side was graciously honored ), chicken liver pate ( a strongly flavored bar with aspic on top and fresh toasted crostini - lovely ), skillet roasted catfish ( mild flavor, wonderful accompaniments ), and their famous fried chicken ( a huge dish, perhaps a little too salty ) with a side of grits ( buttery goodness if you miss grits ).  By the time we left after a dessert of chocolate filled beignets and strawberry crumble, our mood was much improved. \u00a0And you cannot ask much more of a restaurant, really.  We did take advantage of a blackboard eats discount and also a visa signature deal for a free dessert, which again were both graciously accepted. \u00a0The service was very friendly, very available after a rough start, and very accommodating.  But still. \u00a0Southern cuisine in such a fancy, hip place. \u00a0Something unsettling about that, I swear.",

We strolled in one evening after enjoying a show at Yoshi's and the look and aroma of the place made us really want to return. So, a couple of weeks ago one of our socially motivated friends decided to get a group of 10 together for dinner. The only workable date was this past Saturday and we had to settle for 9PM reservations. No problem and it actually worked out really well for us. We arrived a bit early and were met by the nice, beautiful people at the front which included Monetta, one of the owners. We had already seen the place so the beauty of it was no surprise. I love the pictures in the lounge and it was quite comfortable. I could have sat there for an hour or two. Oh, wait I think we did!  We joined other folks from our party in the lounge and were served by College Student John who kept the good drinks coming. I had the New Orleans Punch which was quite good. We had a great time catching up in the lounge and enjoying the beverages. While in the lounge a couple of bottles of wine brought by a couple of our connoisseur friends were handed over to be opened/decanted as we waited for our table. Judging from the wine list we would have been fine if they hadn't brought something from their racks. BUT I'm glad they did. We enjoyed them!  The lounge was comfortable and we were in no hurry to get to our table. They didn't rush us either. We ended up with only six in our party showing up due to unforeseen circumstances and we missed them until the food came. :).   Once we made it over to the table Sarah our waitperson took our appetizer orders, one of which was the short rib dinner which we all shared as well as the shrimp hushpuppies and sauteed mushrooms. All delicious! Damn! The short rib was really tender. For dinner the popular choice seemed to be the ribeye steak. Excellent is all I can say. I think though, next time I'd go medium rare instead of medium (my usual default). The fried chicken looked tasty too. David and his staff were jammin' in the kitchen! We were all pretty full from everything we had consumed thus far BUT the dessert menu came out so we went for it. I ordered peach cobbler and a glass of Navarro Late Harvest Riesling. Both very tasty. I opted not to have the ice cream on the side of my cobbler just so I could say I passed on something!  We love this place and will return. Next time I think I'll try the fried chicken or have the short rib all to myself. \u00a0The folks that run the place and serve you were fantastic. It was a lot of \u00a0fun.",

We were pretty excited about 1300 when we first discovered it. The decor and ambiance are cool and classy.   The menu at 1300 works well for us, because it has the beef dishes for Joe and the alternative things I tend to like. We have been happy with our food every time, but I can't say what we had. I looked at the online menu, and I remember I had the butternut squash risotto one time and liked it, but most of the other things don't sound too familiar, so I wonder if the menu is different in the restaurant.   We did have a problem the last time we visited. We had plans to go to a show at Yoshi's (Alan Parsons, 8 pm). Joe &amp; I always tend to be running a bit late...no, it's not only me, really...and this night I said when he picked me up how thrilled I was that for ONCE we would for sure see the beginning of a show. We ran into some unexpected worse than usual traffic slowness, but when we got to 1300, he said don't worry, we have a little over an hour and Yoshi's is next door.   Well, guess what? The service was SO slow, we had sat there over 20 minutes before we got our cocktails, another long wait just to order, more and more waiting. It was the slowest meal I have ever had, I think. We had an bullet-sweating old-guy waiter who was essentially hiding somewhere the whole time, while we sat &amp; sat and watched all these young waiters practically running table to table with drinks &amp; food.   By 8:10, honestly, I was fuming. Our entrees had not even been delivered and the show was starting at 8. I said to Joe, we should get it boxed and go, IF the waiter ever comes back. Then the food came, and Joe wanted to go ahead &amp; eat it. Joe is a pretty laid back guy and he is not used to seeing the first half of anything. I was too irritated to enjoy my meal at all. Joe quickly wolfed what he wanted, and then we got our take-out boxes (yes, that was slow, too), and we got to the show at least 30 minutes late. Unfortunately, my irritation at the waiter caused Joe to have irritation at me, so it caused a lot of unnecessary stress on the night, to say the least.   My tip is: It is a good restaurant, but it might work best to either make it the night's destination, or post-event, or if you have to go someplace after do not accept the old-guy waiter. Sorry, old dude, you need to step it up a LOT.",

Even though we were 5 people, he suggested that we just order 4 entrees since we were doing this family style and so we can save room for dessert. We ordered a full rack or ribs, the short ribs, the salmon and the fried chicken. The ribs and chicken were my favorite. I'm not a big beef eater so I didn't care too much for the short ribs but everyone else seemed to like them. The salmon was so so. We also ordered a side of mac &amp; cheese which was also good.  For dessert, we ordered 2 chocolate chip with ice cream desserts, the banana cream pie and the beignets. I didn't like the beignets too much but it came with a \"coffee soda\" which was really interesting. It tasted like a carbonated cream pudding. The banana cream pie is a must try!  We also ordered a bunch of cocktails. I personally had the Southern Soul and 2 key lime pies. They were both good but super strong. They were a bit too strong for my taste and ended up with a headache a couple hours later so watch out if you are a light weight like me..lol.  Overall, we had a really good experience mainly due to our great server and of course good food. George was fabulous! He was attentive, honest, funny, patient and extremely helpful. He's definitely one of the best waiters that I've had in a long time!",

    "review_text": "After receiving a gift card for 1300 on Fillmore, my boyfriend and I put it on our radar for our Christmas dinner. We arrived a bit early and waited at the bar until our table was ready. I was immediately in love with the ambiance -- very old school and swanky with a great cocktail list. We had already taken a peek at the menu before arriving so we definitely had a good idea of what we were leaning towards before we arrived. Our service was great -- our waiter was exceptional: attentive (but not overly so) and definitely gave us some guidance when we were trying to decide between dishes.   We ended up ordering the shrimp &amp; grits along with the mussels to start and both were amazing. Without a doubt, I would order both of those again. Our entrees were great, too. I ordered the blackened catfish with shrimp jambalaya and was definitely happy with my order. In all honesty, I find their starter options to be the real stars. I would love to go back and have a meal of JUST appetizers (that is socially acceptable, right?) with drinks. In fact, there's a good likelihood that that will happen. They also have a gospel brunch on Sundays that might be on my radar for this year! Side note for foursquare users: first check-in gets you 50% off a specialty cocktail.  For ladies who are wondering about attire (I know I always wonder what's appropriate): if you're someone that likes to dress up, you can totally get dressed up if it's a special occasion (or if you're like me and just like getting dolled up sometimes). If you're on the opposite end of the spectrum, you'll fit in just fine wearing dark denim and a cute top!",

    "review_text": "While I have eaten through most of the appetizer/bar menu at 1300 Fillmore, I finally joined some friends to eat off the dinner menu. Starting with the one appetizer I had not yet tried, we ordered the sweetbread described as \"Crispy Sweet Breads \"Cast Iron\" Corn Bread, Morel Mushroom Cream, Peppercorn Demi-Glace.\" For $11, this was almost an atrocity; three very small sweetbreads served with two dried morels soaked in cream, atop a hunk of cornbread (which we had ordered anyway). I was just thinking that a few blocks up the street, for $8 at SPQR, I could have an entire plate of several dozen sweetbreads.   Three of us ordered three entres to share: Fulton Valley Farms Organic Black Skillet Fried Chicken with truffle-whipped mashed potatoes and pan gravy. $21  Maple Syrup Slow Braised Beef Short Ribs, Crispy Onion Rings, and Buttermilk Chive Mashed Potatoes. $28  \"Smothered Rabbit\" Baby Turnips, Parisian Potatoes, Pearl Red Onions, and Rabbit Essence. $26  For starters, there is no difference between the chicken's mashed potatoes and the short rib's mashed potatoes. Or, I should say, if there is any truffle oil/essence in the mashed potatoes served with the chicken, it tasted no different than the \"buttermilk chive\" mashed potatoes served with the short ribs (which, by the way, seemed to lack any chive that I could see).   The chicken was reasonably good and tender although not as moist as I thought it might be and I desperately wished the pieces had not been de-boned. There is nothing quite so satisfying as gnawing on a great piece of fried chicken with one's hands instead of having to use a fancy-schmancy knife and fork.  For the short ribs, again I was slightly disappointed. The onion rings were slightly limp although nicely flavored with herbs in the batter. The meat from the rib fell obligingly away from the bones but was shockingly dry.  Then there was the rabbit. Here was a sincere chance at greatness for this dish had undoubtedly the best flavor. Enticing and rich, I struggled to discern the ingredients in the sauce. The disappointment, however, was in its minimalism; two meager legs. I could not but help compare it to Aziza's rabbit where you get two legs AND several medallions of sliced loin to enjoy. Here, the red onions complemented the rich sauce and intriguing complexity, but there simply was not enough of it.  Also, in my several visits, I have found the cocktail to be *very* inconsistent. This was the third time I had ordered a Sidecar and on this particular occasion, it was so strong with mediocre cognac as to be undrinkable (all three of us tried it).   We did finish up the evening with a dessert, a gingerbread napolean with quince-apple compote. Between the three of us, we didn't bother finishing the dessert; dry cake stacked with whipped cream, a crispy tuile, and a side of the fruit.   I am very sad about this as my first few visits eating just the bar food was quite good but this recent meal was shockingly disappointing. I'm sure I will go back as I think they are still working with training wheels and hope some of these problems will resolve themselves.",

From the hostess to the busboy to our fantastic server, we were treated as though we were dining in a friend's home (although I don't have any friends with houses this nice)  -The menu. Yes, it's a bit pricey (think $12-$15 apps and $20-$30 mains) but everything sounded mouth wateringly good. Yeah, I said wateringly.  -My fried chicken. Oh my Lord, I just died and went to Southern Fried Heaven. Boneless, with an incredible flavor that I'm still salivating over. My brother initially balked at the $23 price tag but I figured if they had the nerve to charge that much for chicken then it probably would be fantastic. As usual, I was right.  -The complimentary warm cornbread with jalapeno chutney, our braised pork belly appetizer and my bro's braised beef short rib were all solid choices. The only let down was the sweet potato gnocchi with crab - the flavor of the crab really overpowered the dish and we could barely taste the sweet potato in the gnocchi.  I will definitely be back to 1300 on Fillmore soon, most likely at brunch so I can see their take on day time Southern fried goodness. Was our meal expensive? Yes. Was it worth every penny? Hell yes.",

    "review_text": "I went in doubtful as to the quality of the food and prices and came away very happy with the meal.  We came here during Dine About Town which seemed to be the case for most of the people there on the grey Monday night we were there.   The design is modern and slick with nods to the past and the same is true of the food. My French spouse commented that all the food was good but rather simple for her tastes and expectations. I on the other hand with family in South Carolina and from New Orleans found the food reminded me of some of the best soul and southern food and for me the food was worth the cost.  The service as other people have mentioned in uneven. The place was only half full and there seemed to be a full service team but there was delays in everything from getting the menu to getting the check. One the other hand our server was very attentive and when we realized my spouse's dirty rice had meat in it she doesn't eat, they brought out a version without the meat.  We started with the grill pear salad which had large grilled pear slices, a very flavourful greens mix and balsamic vinegar. We then had the butternut squash with had a great saffron aroma and flavour.   Our entrees were the catfish with dirty rice and the fried chicken. The catfish was some of the best we've had outside the south and the dirty rice was creamy, rich and filled with chicken livers and sausage and has a broth rich from ham hocks. Unfortunately my spouse doesn't eat red meat so they made her another dirty rice without the red meat. I enjoyed the red meat dirty rice and it was one of the best dishes we had.  I had the fried chicken which was had tender meat, a nice spice mix and a good coating. It wasn't the best fried chicken I've had but probably one of the best in the SF bay. It was served with two biscuits and mash potatoes.  We finished with the apple cobbler with vanilla cream and house made trio of sorbet. The trio of sorbets were great with a pear sorbet that wasn't too sweet. The apple cobbler was served in a deep ramekin filled with tender apples inside and with a flaky crust on top.  There was nothing that didn't taste good and a couple dishes that were great. I would come back here again.",

My friend ordered the black skillet catfish that had a more decent portion with a large fillet of catfish with spices grilled into that was wonderful from the little taste I had.  My other friend ordered the maple syrup slow braised beef short rib that was identical to the short rib that my two scallops rested upon and he ordered a side of greens with ham which he loved and egged us on to try. \u00a0   The wine list has lots of napa valley wines. \u00a0To compliment the meal we ordered a Mount Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon that was a light oaky red.   A cocktail, wine, appetizer, entree and no dessert came to $70/person. \u00a0 On the pricey side but delicious. \u00a0Go here if you can leisurely dine and aren't in a hurry.  We came back after the show unexpectedly for desserts and a glass of wine when my friend was following a hot girl into the bar. \u00a0 We shared the warm chocolate beignets that were filled with chocolate and came with a chocolate sauce and a coffee soda. \u00a0We weren't sure if we suppose to drink the small shot of frothy coffee soda or dip it, so we dipped. \u00a0The 3 beignets were light, fluffy and wonderful chocolate goodness, but reminds me of a $9 chocolate boston creme donut.",

Fried chicken was good, good seasoning, served with yummy, soft biscuits in creamy potatoes. They said allow 20 minutes prep time but we were served our chicken in less than 15 minutes.  For dessert we had the house made chocolate chip cookies with ice cream, because they didn't have the banana cream pie (not a fan of seasonal menus!!). Cookies &amp; ice cream were great - though the cookies, unlike our chicken, took a very long time - almost 30 minutes to prepare - but the menu didn't warn us of this!

You can dress up or down and feel just as comfortable.  Food was just okay. Aside from dessert, there was nothing that stood out: - Cornbread: Good - Warm Poached Egg Salad: Beware, the blue cheese dressing is extremely strong! It was good (and the portion was big), but just too filling for one person as a starter. I'd recommend sharing this plate if you want to try..  - Sage Butternut Squash-Apple Soup: Once again, pretty large portion. Our waiter described it as a \"sweet soup\", but it wasn't too sweet. It was good. - Fat Fries: Good, but nothing spectacular - Mac and Cheese: Watery and a little bland. So sad. - Skillet Fried Chicken: Takes 20 minutes to prepare and was not worth the wait. The crust tasted strongly of cumin which none of us really liked. It's boneless and you get a LOT of meat. The chicken was moist, but just not that flavorful. I was so disappointed. The mashed potatoes and biscuits were good though. - Caramelized Apple-Bread Pudding: Best thing we had. Bread pudding was nice and warm and crispy from the caramelization. So good with the vanilla ice cream. Our waiter recommended this and he did not steer wrong!  Service was slow (it took awhile for our waiter to even show up, and then again to come back and take our order), but good when it happened. I think it was because of a large party in the back, but still..  It's not cheap here, but portions are big, so I think you get what you paid for.  If it's between 1300 Fillmore or Pican in Oakland, Pican ALL THE WAY!!!",

Hits: - Love the decor and ambiance. Very swanky and cool with the pictures of the jazz legends on the walls. - The service was very friendly, especially considering some of our peeps were late. - The fried chicken was GOOOOOOD. I like me some fried chicken and this was really great.  Misses: - You will definitely not get any bang for your buck here. Seriously - my starter salad was like 3 pieces of lettuce and two pieces of blood oranges for $9. - The service, while friendly, was certainly off at times. I got served a salad that was for another table. They took it away, and then when my other peeps got their hot appetizers, I was waiting for my salad. Plus, no one came around to refill our wine glasses. - An argument broke out right next to our table between the staff and a customer. I don't know what it was about, but it certainly didn't add to the ambiance.   Bottom line: if I'm going to spend this much money on dinner, I expect a little more, both in terms of food and service.",

Later, I moved to to the bar where I remained waitng for my friends and noticed a distinct chill from an owner and the waitress through out the evening.  My daughter works in the industry and states that lone diners are percieved as low tippers and there is not much money to be made from them. I hope that this was not the case last night.

His recommendations were right on point and there was never a moment in the meal where we had to wonder when someone was going to fill our glasses or clear the plates.   Although I came here with the intention of ordering from the \"Dine About Town\" menu, I couldn't resist the temptation to try the Shrimp n' Grits our server raved about. He told us that the chef had been attending an event where an app contest was taking place and even though the Shrimp and Grits was not officially an entry, the judges liked it so much it won anyway. This was my first experience with grits and oh.my.god...so good! The dish had so much flavor and a little kick that will make you want to lick the bowl clean!  As for the entree's we ordered the Fried Chicken and the Short Ribs to share. Both were hearty and filling. In the end we were just too full to finish everything so ended up taking a to-go bag which made a tasty lunch the next day.   My Honey Sweet Ice Tea cocktail hit the spot and was the perfect compliment to my meal.  I have been dreaming of the BBQ Shrimp n' Creamy Grits since I left so I am sure I will be back soon!",

I got the surf and turf which wasn't bad. The scallop was a little bit on the salty side and it was not as good as I thought it would be. Then the nice flavored beef that they placed on it was delicious. The dish did not have any harmony because the flavors didn't mix in well together. While they were good on their own, I would not want to eat them together but here they are on my dish together.  My friend had the ribs which were... ok. Myep. Just ok. They weren't bad but for what we had to pay for it and ugh. It just was not delectable enough to charge us that price.  Our other friend had the fried chicken. It was pretty good damned chicken. That might've been the only dish that we got the best bang for our buck. I would order the chicken again.  I love the ambiance, I love the drink selection that they offer. Nicely put together. Although a lot of the wines do not come in just a glass and would require you to take down the whole bottle. That would be fine if you didn't drive, it's not that sweet to find parking around the area. The night that we went the parking lot was already full. So be prepared! I would suggest \u00a0a taxi to there, get wasted and lie around on the couches and take one back. =)",

The maitre d' made a show of having to \"go check\" even though we had walked past 3 empty tables for 2. He came back and put us at the table in front of the one he had originally planned. It was not the best, but it was better. I guess we looked like we wouldn't be good tippers or something(?). We noticed that they never tried to seat another pair at that crappy table the whole time we were there, which I found interesting.The waiter was ok, but not great.He came and announced the specials and left before we could get any questions out! He was nice enough, but the service felt rushed. Honestly, the busboy (or the person who brings out the bread and stuff) delivered the best service. The food was meh, and overpriced.

Whether you go for a romantic dinner date, a night out with the girls (or boys), or a drink after a Yoshi's show (a few doors down), this supper club will set the stage for a great evening. There's been live music both times I went, a very friendly staff, great ambience and an amazing menu.  Ambience first: The decor is dark, black and earth-toned and minimalist. Some seating feels very lounge-like and cozy, with big black stuffed chairs around small tables. Most seating offers street views so you get entertainment not only from the live music (old school jazz one night with a four-piece ensemble and fun R&amp;B and Hip Pop covers for NYE) but from passersby.  The food: Oh my lord. Just slap me now! The food is delicious. Soul food meets French haute cuisine. There's a lounge menu, dinner menu and a Sunday gospel brunch menu. Here are a few items from the three to give an idea: Fresh Water Shrimp Hushpuppies; Saut\u00e9ed Wild Mushrooms with Spring Herbs Mascarpone Yellow Hominy Grits; Black Skillet Roasted Catfish, Andouille Sausage, Shrimp Jambalaya, Cornbread Panzanella Salad; Lemongrass-Ginger House Cured Salmon, Cornmeal Pancake, Molasses Glaze, Chive Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche. And I would sell my own mother for the warm chocolate beignets.  The menu is kept fresh by Executive Chef/Owner David Lawrence whom I met New Years. Along with his entire staff, David was friendly and inviting. I felt like a very welcomed guest.",

However their \"Fat Fries\" were a bit of a letdown. In need of salt... or a miracle. They were poorly textured and a bit bland.   Well, enough of that food nonsense. You only need one reason to pop into 1300 and that is the decor. It is beautiful! I've never sat in so comfortable a lounge, surrounded by such great images and beautiful taste. It rings true to the Fillmore's roots and amps it up with a touch of modern class while giving more than a passing nod to the past. There is a wonderful mural of old black and white photos gracing the lounge and a nearly larger than life street shot of Fillmore and Post, circa 1948. The room is warm and luxurious, with soft, stuffed leather furniture and Persian carpets.   The table service in the bar is friendly and prompt, the martinis are pretty wicked and their wine by the glass list is very nice.

There is live music at night on the weekends in the lounge - really swanky intimate setting. Probably my favorite thing about 1300 is the Sunday brunch. They have a live gospel jazz band playing in the dining area. There is a fee added for the music but if you sit at the bar the fee is waived and you still have a great view of the band. Not to mention a bartender right in front of you to keep filling those bottomless mimosas! The eggs benedict is to die for! The english muffin is really crispy - it really makes the whole meal.

A Monday evening dinner had my favorite food, still solid, but something was lacking- maybe the excitement of that amazing fried chicken has faded after having it 3 different times.  Service was not in line with the prices and the MO of the place. I hear November was a rough month for the restaurant, so it's possible staff is not making bank, but it does not explain the attitude of the server, or her agonizing desire to feed us quickly and get us out of there asap (the place was half empty and she only had one more table). She brought the bill with desert, even if we wanted to order coffee (which we did and she had to re-run the bill). The tip definitely reflected our experience...  One more note on service: big pet peeve of mine is when 1 of the table is still eating and the bus boys clean everybody else's plates, making that 1 person feel rushed.

They fell a little flat when I asked for a vegetarian entree. \u00a0I really threw them off. \u00a0They wanted to do a risotto with veggies. \u00a0What? \u00a0More starch? \u00a0OK, since that was the case, I opted for...hmmm...more GRITS! \u00a0With veggies on top, of course. \u00a0 Not the most creative but I certainly appreciated the effort. \u00a0  Add all of that to the fact that the owner came out to check on us and recommended some fab desserts. \u00a0Personally, I'd take the beignets sans the coffee soda ice cream. \u00a0  ***Last thing. \u00a0This one's for the ladies:***   Put your makeup on and dress to impress. \u00a0A certain male celebrity was in the house and all the women (and men) \u00a0were drooling! \u00a0Apparently it's a regular occurrence.",

I got the violet fog drink as well and it was good too. My friend got the fried chicken and even the breast meat was moist. I thought the mashed potatoes with the fried chicken was okay at best. The only thing I would complain about is that the service was SO good that they took the food away before I was even done with it! I had good 2 heaping spoonfuls of shrimp and grits left and the guy took it away before I could even say anything. Also when the guys were taking out our food (which I had more than 1/2 on my plate and more than a 1/3 on my friend's plate) He was going to just take it, didn't ask if we needed a box, so I had to stop him and ask him to box it up. \u00a0I don't know, it's like they wanted us to eat really fast or not take food out either. I mean, it was empty that night we were there, we for sure didn't have to get a reservation. \u00a0Besides the crazy great service that might have been too good, the food and drinks were all excellent!

The hostess had originally seated us at a table that was a bit small and close to the door and we asked if they could move us to a booth in the back. The hostess was very accommodating and very sweet.   The food was very good as well! We ordered the catfish, fried chicken, pork cheeks, and the surf and turf (scallops and braised pork). We also ordered a side of mac n cheese to share. The fried chicken had a lot of flavor. The seasoning on the skin was really good. I didn't try the biscuits that came with it, but my friends said that they were delicious as well. The pork cheeks were also amazing! The scallops on the surf n turf were seared perfectly and tasted very fresh as well. The braised pork was good, but nothing really special. I didn't try the catfish, so I can't comment on that. The mac n cheese was AMAZING! Probably one of the best mac n cheese's I've tried in the city (and trust me, I've tried a lot!). It had a very southern style to it and had a little kick of spiciness to it. It melts in your mouth!   For dessert, we decided to all split the Beignets, which is their housemade, donut-like dessert that comes with a whipped espresso and chocolate sauce. The dessert actually only comes with 3 beignets and the 4 of us were going to split it, but our server was so sweet and made sure that they gave us 4 of them! And it was a good thing he did because these were really yummy! The donuts had chocolate inside as well, and the whipped espresso was the perfect accompaniment.   All in all, we had a great dinner. They had some really good dishes. The service was excellent, the prices weren't too bad, the ambiance was cozy and fun. I will definitely come back!",

I ordered the Black Skillet Fried Chicken -- kudos for being boneless and not having to use my hands. Then we ended our meal with the Warm Chocolate Beignets, Chocolate Sauce, Coffee Soda (close #2 to the grits) -- the beignets were warm and had chocolate inside them as well as a dipping sauce but I could've done without the coffee soda. It was just strange.  After our meal, our waitress asked if I wanted my fried chicken bagged to go since I barely ate half so I said yes. When we were walking back to our car, I had remembered that she never came back with my leftovers.

It is great for large groups as well as intimate dinner parties (if your party is fairly large, ask for the private room). I used to live in the Fillmore/O'Farrell complex, and it's great to see how the neighborhood has changed within the last few years.   Like everyone else, we fell in love with the cornbread (which comes with honey butter and jalapeno jelly). The jelly was great - I've never tasted jalapenos in a jelly form (probably bc I hate jalapenos to begin with - but as a jelly, it was very tasty).   Appetizers - our group ordered a variety of them. The gnocchi looked good (but very rich). BF and I ordered the fried green tomatos w/fried goat cheese - can you say caloric overload (that's probably an accurate way to describe the entire meal, actually). Very tasty, yummy...this is about the point where I started to get full.   Entrees - yes, the fried chicken was amazing and well worth the 20 minute prep time. I'm normally not a fan of fried chicken, but I couldn't stop eating it off my bf's plate! I ordered the maple syrup-braised short rib, which came with mashed potatoes, greens and onion rings....unbelievably tasty and flavorful.   The service was really great - from the hostess to our waiter to the bus boy, everyone was extremely friendly and helpful.

For the main course, i had a hard time choosing. \u00a0with the fried chicken in my mind, i ended up picking this and saving the chicken for next time. \u00a0so for me the seafood bouillabaisse and my friend had the sea bass. \u00a0  the sea bass was very flavorful and had a nice crisp skin with a tender meat inside. \u00a0my bouillabaisse was at first glance, somethin both appetizing to the eye and the mouth. \u00a0the pink/orange broth that all the seafood was soaked in looked so damn good. \u00a0it came with a crispy toasted bread that was really good with the broth. \u00a0everything in there was gerat, the lobster, the giant scallop, tender pieces of fish, and crab. \u00a0  and the dessert? \u00a0the sweet potato soufle was really unique and actualy good. \u00a0i had my doubts in the beginning but it turned out somethin that was worth trying. \u00a0iono if i'll get it again, but everyone who comes to 1300 should at least try this. \u00a0we also got the chocalate bouigets which was kinda like a pastry with choco sauce and coffee to drench it in. \u00a0i didn't quite like it. i thought the pasty could have been more fluffier or crispier but instead, it was heavy, it didn't soak up the sauces very well and didn't quite do it for me. \u00a0  but overall, the food was good. \u00a0they did say they weren't officially opened yet so i'll take this as a trial run and something for them to work on. \u00a0come next time, when they are fully staffed and opened, i'll hopefully have a great dinner. \u00a0  oh and the service was great. \u00a0iono if its the excitement, but they all are just really helpful and made sure you had what you needed. \u00a0i ordered extra bread for the seafood. \u00a0they might as well automatically do it since that broth is so so GOOOD.",

    "review_text": "Whoa mama.....1300 on Fillmore is awesome. Lovely, sleek decor with floor to ceiling windows and long drapery to subtly hide the hustle &amp; bustle of the city streets. The lights were dimmed just right, giving the perfect mood of what was yet to come.   Our server (George) was extremely friendly and helpful on advising what his faves on the menu were. We took his advise and started with the Bourbon Braised Pork Belly. I've read on past Yelp reviews that this is a winner. Man, they weren't lying! Literally......5 layers of absolute heaven melting in my mouth. Fat, meat, fat, meat.......definitely not for the faint of heart. But sooooo to-die-for!  Next, for our entrees. I had the Fried Chicken with truffle whipped potatoes. To be honest, I could see why others would enjoy this dish. It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside but the all over flavor wasn't there for me. HOWEVER, my boyfriend's Beef Short Ribs were \"fall-off-the-bone\" good. OMG! I give that dish 5 stars alone. It was so delicious. No need for a knife, the meat simply feathered off with his fork. Mmmm.....i will definitely get my own plate of ribs next time.  Our eyes were much bigger than our stomaches. Cuz i'm not done. We also ordered 2 sides. The mac &amp; cheese and greens to add to our \u00a0Thanksgiving-like dinner. The collard greens soaked in the sweetness of the carmelized onions. That was good. The mac &amp; cheese....ehh blah, but I guess we are used to that good ol' traditional mac &amp; cheese, not kicked up with different spices.  Last but not least. They had beignets on the dessert menu.....a must-have in my book. Nothing will be as great as the real thing in New Orleans but their Chocolate Beignets with coffee soda and chocolate sauce was super rich and sinful.   My recap: 1300 on Fillmore is a great place for all occassions. Post-work cocktails, a dinner date, or just out with some friends. You MUST go if you haven't already....go go go!",

    "review_text": "How an evening should be spent!  As we indulged in a few cocktails prior to dinner, we admired the \"Heritage Wall\" in the main foyer. \u00a0The decorations in 1300 make you feel like you have stepped back in time to a place that carries a great feeling of mystique and elegance.  Now onto the food and drink... The drinks are varied (except for the beers on tap) with many mixtures that are featured with distinct flavors and personalities from the south. \u00a0Check out the drink menu to understand the personality.  The food was delish. \u00a0Quite simply a spectacular evening, but I will warn you it was difficult to decide... We had the surf and turf with scallops, fois gras, braised pork ribs, Fried chicken and rack of ribs. Side of mac and cheese is a must because it again rewrites the book on how they are generally prepared. \u00a0  Now the beignets for dessert were splendid, but the cappucino sauce was a little much as they were already stuffed with chocolate with additional chocolate on the side... watch out diabetics!  Tip: Dress to impress, many local celebs appear frequently. \u00a0A former mayor was sitting directly behind us.",

    "review_text": "WOW. I am so sad it has taken me this long to discover 1300 Fillmore. Hands down the best southern food I've had in the Bay Area. (my favorite food is fried chicken so trust me, I've tried a lot.)  The food: 5 stars. Service: 4 stars (great waiter, but weirdly speedy.. ie: we received our appetizer a mere 3 minutes after we ordered it..)  We ordered the shrimp and grits to start which were delicious and flavorful. Even if you're not a huge shrimp person like me, I recommend them.  For our mains, we shared the fried chicken and the shortrib. While the shortrib was fabulously tender and delicious (I'd definitely get it again), we both liked the fried chicken better. First of all, it was boneless which makes it so much easier to eat! Secondly, it was perfectly seasoned and crispy with just the right ratio of chicken and skin. Being the fried chicken aficionado I am, this chicken comes with my highest recommendation. I am also a HUGE fan of biscuits and let me just say, this was one of the BEST BISCUITS I've ever had. You won't do wrong with this entree.  Finally, we ended with the banana cream pie for dessert and it was de-light-ful. Although the service was eerily speedy for a Saturday night in a fine-ish dining establishment, the amazing food will have us back without a doubt.  TRY 1300 FILLMORE!!!",

The service was impeccable and the owners were warm, polite and approachable while giving us space to enjoy ourselves. \u00a0The interior is warm and well-furnished, and they are able to use partitions and curtains to gracefully block out parts of the large room. \u00a0We didn't get to enjoy any of the live jazz promised but I will certainly go back here for dinner to try it out.",

    "review_text": "My boyfriend and I arrived quite early for our reservation, so we sat in some of the comfy chairs in the lounge to enjoy a cocktail. He ordered some citrus-y spicy martini thing and I got the holiday highball with pear puree. I was tentative about my beverage choice, but our waitress didn't hesitate to offer a replacement if necessary. Ultimately, we liked each other's drink so much, we switched, but I thought it was a classy touch to offer to switch.   The band was starting to play in the lounge when the rest of our party arrived and our reservation was ready. Despite a live band in the next room, the dining room was a comfortable noise level and great for conversation. We started with the sweet potato gnocchi, which had a nice kick and came with olives and bell peppers. The corn bread was a bit dry (I admit I abstained from butter) and would have been nicer had it been warm, but I liked that it fit with the culinary soul food theme. I ordered the short ribs, which were excellent and so tender that I was compelled to try them the next week at Salt House just to compare the experience (1300 wins, but I'll leave the details to my Salt House). My boyfriend had the char, which was nice, but probably the least exciting dish. My friend had the fried chicken, which was scandalously good. We had brussels sprouts on the side, which were really tasty. I think we skipped dessert because we were so full, but found the low-calorie cheesecake option amusing after such a decadent meal.   Net, net: Classy place with delicious food that sticks to the theme. Would do it again with enthusiasm.",

First I must say the phone service did not set a good vibe for the rest of my dinner...my bf and I were stuck on the freeway and I was thinking I should call the restaurant to let them know we may be running late. I call and someone picks up asking if it's ok I can hold. I say ok and I'm placed on hold. Not very long after I hear a click and I suppose they hung up on me. I call again this time no one says a word to me and it just sounds like I've been butt dialed as I just here the chatter among waiters. I continue to say hello hoping they realize that they picked up a call and need to respond but nope they hang up on me again. I call again and this time someone picks up and asks if I can hold. I say no because you hung up on me twice already. The person on the phone doesn't apologize for anything and proceeds to say ok how can I help you? I tell the person I may be running late for my reservation and the person just says ok and hangs up....did you even know who I was? They didn't even ask for my name and didn't say anything like thank you we'll see you soon...nothing -_-  Anyways, my bf and I arrive a couple minutes late but are seated immediately. We are scanning through the menu a couple of times and maybe 10 or 15 minutes go by and no one comes by to check on us or give us any water. It's only 5:45 and there was hardly anyone there so not sure what the deal was. Finally our waitress takes our drink and dinner order and from then on she was very attentive to us and we started to enjoy our dinner despite the rude start.   They offered a special Xmas eve dinner so I went with the bay scallops, the catfish entree and then the beignets for dessert. My bf went with the butternut squash soup, the ribeye entree and then the chocolate pot de crime for dessert. Not sue if we had enough food, we also ordered a side of the ham hock greens and the truffle Mac and cheese.  We enjoyed everything really but the butternut squash soup was just ok and we really could have done without the sides as we were really stuffed by the end of our meal. Sides were good but the entree portion sizes filled us up for sure.  All in all the food was ok. Seems like they do a decent brunch so might come back to try that next time.",

    "review_text": "We had reservations for 10 and upon arriving were seated at a large round table near the kitchen. I'm a big bread fan and not a big meat fan, so I had a feeling that the complimentary cornbread would be a highlight of the night for me, and it was. Sadly though, it was not even the best cornbread I've ever had, but drier and more crumbly than that offered by no-frills soup and salad joints near the Berkeley campus. I liked the jalapeno jelly because I could taste real pepper flavor in it, but I fear that they put artificial coloring in it because it was almost disturbingly glowing bright red under the dim lighting of the restaurant. For my main course, I ordered the baby back ribs, which was a special of the night and costs $29 (just a note since it's not on the menu). They are pork ribs and come with coleslaw, macaroni and cheese, a very mustard-y sauce, and a second more traditional BBQ sauce. The ribs are seasoned with a dry rub, which our waiter emphasized was less messy than sauce, but I found the meat pretty tasteless and wouldn't have minded compromising neatness for flavor. The ribs weren't really fall-off-the-bone tender, which I know from watching way too much Food Network over the years is an important criterion. I tasted a bunch of my friends' dishes too, as I'm big on communal eating, and actually thought the pork chop with the unique addition of cherries was most flavorful, and the largest portion. \u00a0  Food-wise, definitely not worth it, but really I don't even think Angeline's is worth the $$ cost of a meal. I have nothing against and much to the contrary highly respect the deliciousness that is Southern cuisine, but to me it's just hard to make items such as fried chicken gourmet to the point that it'd be worth $30 for a couple pieces. It seems almost wrong to try to elevate comfort foods, as they are supposed to be basic and down-to-earth. As a college student I'm used to eating in order to get full and seeking the most bang out of my buck, but I get that people patron $$$ restaurants for the service and ambiance, as 1300 on Fillmore's walls filled with framed black-and-white historical photos and candlelit tables exude an elegant atmosphere. Surely a classy date spot aesthetically, but don't expect to win someone over with the food.",

We walked in the Band was playing and no host at the front, we waited for almost 10 min and still no host, plus they were not busy. We walked to the bar area and no acknowledgment from the bar tender so we walked towards the dinning area to seat ourselves only to have the Host appear and give us an attitude about how she could help us. I explained to the Host how we waited for 10 min and so on only to have us follow her to the front \"again\" to set us down to a table. Strike 1 for 1300. Our waiter came by to take our order. He was great but only sad thing was he didn't know when asked who the Chef &amp; Band was. He didn't know. Strike 2! All in all my friend and I had a great time listening to Joey &amp; the Sole Peppers and enjoyed our cocktails and Spicy shrimp &amp;Gritts appetizer.

However, food is just ok.  * Pear Flower $12 (5 of 5) - Absolut Pear, St. Germaine, Fresh grapefruit, Lemon juice.Very easy to drink and very pretty and pink. It is like a spiked grapefruit juice. Yummy, * Kaffir Lime Gimlet $12 (4 of 5) - Hanger One Kaffir Lime, Fresh Lime Juice. Stronger drink and pretty sour. Refreshing and pretty colored. But Pear Flower was just easier to drink as a girl.  Complimentary CornBread (3.5 of 5) - Fresh and shaped like a piece of pie. Cute and fresh, but slightly dry ontop where the browning is. * Special of the Day Half Rack of Ribs (3.5 of 5) - Super meaty rack of ribs. Dry rub and needs to be accompanied by sauces. They dish comes with a mustard sauce and a bbq sauce. I personally like it with the mustard sauce.  * Black Skillet Roasted Catfish, Andouille Sauce and Shrimp Jambalaya, Cornbread Panzanella Salad $23 (3 of 5) - The catfish was fresh, and the jambalaya was tasty, but neither were super strong tastes. It was rather mellow. I expected the catfish do be tastier, but it was not.  * Black Skillet Fried Chicken , Buttermilk Whipped Potatoes, Pan Gravy $25 (2.5 \u00a0of 5) - Most disappointed with this dish. The chicken was boneless, but it was pretty dry. And it looked more like hush puppy pieces, than Fried Chicken. I was disappointed and confused why I didn't like this dish more when everyone else on the yelp was tipping to get the Fried Chicken.  * Maple Syrup Braised Boneless Beef Short Rib, Crispy Onion Rings, Horeseradish Chive Mashed Potatoes $28 (2.5 of 5) - Very dry piece of short rib. Very soft, but also very dry. I thought the short rib would contain more fat and create a melt in your mouth goodness, but our dish was not that moist. \u00a0 * Spiced Fat Fries, home made ketchup $7 (3 of 5) - It is just a really large cut of fries. Nothing too special. I can skip this next time. * White Truffle Mac N White Cheddar Cheese $7 (3 of 5) - It was a pretty good mac and cheese, but I didn't really smell or taste the truffle. I can also skip this next time.  This place has great ambience. The food was greatly portioned, but the taste was only ok. To balance that out, their drinks were pretty tasty and much more intune with their ambience. Probably recommend for drinks, but pass on the meal.",

Ambience, service, and food were top-notch.   The hostess happened to be walking by our table, and cleared a few dishes for us. Some dude in a suit boxed our food up for us. This is a business whose staff understands that while everyone serves a role within the machine, the bigger picture is to keep the customers happy. I get the feeling \"It's not my job\" doesn't fly at manager meetings, and, quite frankly, that's how it should be.   It's beautiful, dark, and obviously a top-choice for group parties, as there were two large parties in the main dining room, and the lounge area was reserved for a private party. 1300 has a very sexy, masculine energy to it; perfect for 2nd or 3rd dates and extremely fitting for the neighborhood's late night entertainment. Ladies-don't come here on a first date unless you're okay with breaking that silly little rule. You know what I'm talking about...  We ordered: *Shrimp 'N Grits: shrimp were so so so good, but the grits weren't as creamy as I prefer.   *Fried Chicken: HOLY CRAP, this was the juiciest chicken I've ever had. 1300 is known for this dish, and I can see why.  *Braised Short Rib: I don't even like ribs, but these were falling-off-the-bone tender and wonderfully flavored. I *almost* wish I'd ordered this instead.  *Beignets: Good, but not as amazing as I'd hoped. Served with warm chocolate sauce and coffee soda (which is basically a coffee foam). Definitely a perfectly portioned treat.",

Food: \u00a0 A nice touch is abundant cornbread with both butter and a sweet chili relish on the side. \u00a0  For appetizers, we ordered the poached egg and cabbage salad and the sweetbreads. \u00a0  The salad is a great idea. \u00a0It was described at a soft poached egg over cabbage with a mustard/bacon vinaigrette. \u00a0 Bacon vinaigrettes are often made by frying the bacon and using some of the renderings to create the dressing. \u00a0In this case, it seemed that the only bacon on the salad was a partially browned piece laid across the top of the salad. \u00a0Besides that, the dressing had so much vinegar that it stole the focus from the rest of the salad. \u00a0  The sweetbreads were fried and served with morel mushrooms. \u00a0Oddly the mushrooms had no flavor whatsoever. \u00a0Even with dried mushrooms this is surprising! \u00a0 It also appeared that the sweetbreads were flowered and fried at too high a temperature. \u00a0The browning appeared dark but was only at the minimal surface level. \u00a0Thus the flavor you'd expect with sauted sweetbreads was simply not there. \u00a0   For main courses we had the pork chop and the maple braised short ribs with onion rings. \u00a0  The pork chop itself was well prepared - tender and not over or undercooked. \u00a0There was not much apple cider sauce to be seen. \u00a0The opening taste from the mashed potatoes was reminiscent of pumpkin pie spices but the finish was actually bitter. \u00a0Were the spices used improperly cooked or old? \u00a0Either way, when the pork chop is placed on top of the potatoes the problem with them brings down the entire dish. \u00a0  The short ribs were tender and sweet but maple flavors were not apparent. \u00a0The mashed potatoes were made with chives and had EXCELLENT flavor. \u00a0The included onion rings seemed to have a seasoned salt mix put on them after they were cooked. \u00a0The onion rings were too salty and the spices were dry and unrefined in flavor. \u00a0For this style cooking, onion rings could really go well with this dish but the ones served took away from the meal rather than adding to it. \u00a0  Service: \u00a0Friendly. \u00a0Staff pushed a prix fix which was less interesting then the main menu.  Dinning Room: \u00a0Looks a bit like a mid-level hotel or airport restaurant. \u00a0Many tables are very closely packed together. \u00a0  Summary: \u00a0With an amazing menu that has a lot of good concepts on it we were disappointed that everything we ordered missed the mark. \u00a0I hope the kitchen improves upon its execution, but at this price point (about $60-80 per person (tip, drinks, desert)), I probably won't return to see if they do.",

Neighborhood aside, the food was outstanding. \u00a0Between the three of us, we ordered shrimp hush puppies, poached egg salad, skillet fried chicken, grilled pork chop, roasted black bass (without the shrimp nage), mac n'cheese, spiced fat fries, and the beignets. \u00a0Yeah, we pigged out!!! \u00a0The standout here was the fried chicken, which was moist and flavorful. \u00a0I highly recommend it! \u00a0I would definitely return specifically for the chicken. \u00a0The complimentary cornbread with jalapeno jelly was awesome as well!!!",

    "review_text": "The Fillmore Heritage Plaza area is off to a great start. A friend and I decided we were in the mood to get some comfort/soul food and having read about this via an article on the development of the area, we headed on down. Now mind you the reigning king of soul food is literally diagonally across the street in Powell's Place. I wouldn't consider this direct competition though because where Powell's offers a familiar, casual eating experience, 1300 evokes a very elegant, upscale, vintage jazz vibe.  Set on the corner of Fillmore and Eddy, there's a grand wooden door that swings out to expose a fairly spacious room. There's a sleek bar/lounge to the left and the main dining room opens up all the way to the back where the kitchen is. There's a glass Enclosed banquet room towards of the back of the dining room also, with curtains drawn to provide privacy. I must say that I've never seen the use of so many shades of brown! Normallly people think brown as an icky color but the \u00a0darkwood tones looked very classic throughout. The leather bank booths, curtains, inverse lamp shades, and even the staff were decked out in the various degrees of it. Lithograph style plates, etched glass and a very large painting add some modernity to the art lining the walls.  As we looked through the menu we decided on two starters and two entrees, sharing the following:  - Hush puppied fresh water shrimp - Braised pork belly on whipped potatoes - Short ribs  - Skillet fried chicken and mini biscuits - Side of Mac and Cheese  The food started out with a basket of corn bread triangles accompanies with honey butter and red pepper jelly. Good tasty morsels but not too much to prevent you from filling up. I love hush puppies but let's break down, it's deep fried breaded bread. Like onion rngs, they often are very tasty for the first few bites, then they hit you like a grease bomb. Not these hush puppies. Perfectly fried with the shrimp perfectly cooked with a nice crunchy texture, complementing the the crisp batter. The pork belly was fall apart tender and was my friends favorite of the night. The short ribs were presented in this great cylindrical, upside down lollipop fashion with the rib protruding to give the dish some height. It was also very tender with a subtle hint of maple syrup in the glaze. The fried chicken was the heavy hitter for the night, nreast, thigh and drumstick crisp on the outside and juicy in, just as you'd expect while managing not to be greasy. The mini biscuits like the cornbread that started, were little pieces of savory starches that were great with the butter and jelly. Finally, the mac and cheese was al dente to the bite, tangy and rich from the cheese sauce and had a good kick pf heat from probably the same pepper they use in the jam. Excellent satisfying meal. My friend almost didn't want to go out to dinner and after we ate he definitely reversed is thoughts on that.  The service was also excellent as you'd expect from a place making it's grand opening. We were pressed for time and told our server Jessie up front and she did everything she could to get us our food in a timely manner and moving onward to our next destination. The chef even came out as we were finishing our meal to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves. I've definitely got a new go to place before any Fillmore show and that's going to be doubly true for Yoshi's opening up next door. They've also said that they will be working with Yoshi's to get jazz acts locally so you're going to get 2x the jazz on this block.",

The ambiance and music was great and we were very excited. \u00a0Our server was Jesse and she was a sweetheart. \u00a0We ordered a round of drinks and appetizers to start off the night and we were greeted with a round of water and a warm basket of corn bread with honey butter. \u00a0The corn bread was great. \u00a0  Jesse came back about fifteen minutes later to take our order for dinner. \u00a0We asked about our drinks and she said they were on their way. \u00a0Compliments of the chef, we had a tasting of soup and something else and it was quite tasty and we were looking forward to the meal.   The Torchon Froie Gras came out and it was kind of disappointing. \u00a0We made the mistake of ordering two and barely touched the second dish. \u00a0We finally got our drinks and they were pretty good and strong. \u00a0  Two of the girl's order the salmon special, a short rib, bouillabaisse and the fried chicken. \u00a0The chicken when it came out was cold and Jesse quickly brought out a second dish. \u00a0The plate was hot but the chicken was still just kind of warm but it was warmer. \u00a0  The best dish was the short ribs (which was really good) and the worst was the salmon. \u00a0I think most of us had some sort of mashed potatoes as a side and honestly was disappointed that at that price range it was boxed potatoes. \u00a0I've been in the restaurant industry most my life and this was Sysco add hot water and butter potatoes. \u00a0Not impressed by the food but I'm sure we'll be there for drinks.  If you want soul food for your money, go to Farmer Brown's. \u00a0Yes, it's in the TL and it may not be as swanky but come on, it's GOOD FOOD!  Oh yeah... They brought us out Huckleberry sorbet but I couldn't finish it and if you know me... I don't refuse dessert esp anything frozen.",

    "review_text": "This was pretty good if you want to have some soul-food, but don't want to eat it off of styrofoam plates or feel like you need a shower afterward. \u00a0 To begin with, you HAVE to start with the hush puppies. This is not up for discussion. When they arrive, don't cry out because they are not round- a la long john silvers. \u00a0Have faith-they are the best puppies of hush I have ever eaten with some yummy dipping sauce. \u00a0Soon, prepare yourself, as the waiter will bring you a plate of warm, napping triangles of cornbread nestled in a warm napkin. \u00a0It's okay, go ahead and wake one and bite it's head off. Be ruthless- we don't want an overpopulation of cornbreads running around. \u00a0The jalapeno jam is good with those. \u00a0For an entree, the ribs were divine and *smoky*, but the coleslaw was under-marinated. \u00a0I, personally had the fried chicken with delicate buttermilk mashed potatoes. You don't even have to mess with bones for the chicken- they remove those for you, so if you're going here for a first date, don't despair. \u00a0It was served with a cheddar biscuit, which I \u00a0thought was good, but a little overkill on the carbs. \u00a0Some vegetation could have been a good complement to the chicken and potatoes. Banana cream pie was for dessert. \u00a0Pretty good, not too sweet, but the crust was a little unflavored. Overall, a nice ambiance, some interesting cocktails and great service..",

A very modern establishment - your typical southern food gets upgraded to silverware and fancy plates. I was really happy with all of our apps - shrimp hushpuppies (not your typical hushpuppies fr/ the South but still tasty), pear salad with arugula (nothing special, but still tasty), barbecue shrimp &amp; grits (prob 2nd favorite), and delicious wild mushrooms over a mascarpone grits (yes!!!!!!! get this if you like mushrooms). Please just don't tell me how much butter I ate on Saturday night and I will be fine. The most disappointing thing I had to eat was definitely our Surf &amp; Turf - there was just too much sweetness in the dish... the pulled beef was overwhelming sugary and the sweet potato didn't counter balance it. I think it would have worked better with either a less sweet beef or not sweet potatos (keep the bacon in!). Overall, the dish really fell flat, and I would not recommend it. The foie gras was so small that it might as well have not been on the dish. Very overpriced. Not a bad place to try \u00a0before a night at Yoshi's.  So overall a great place, but recognize you are paying for ambiance.",

Our drinks were kept full and our table kept clean.  Overall, I'm a fan of this restaurant and can see myself coming back. \u00a0  YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (449/500)",

The meal started off good. \u00a0The poached egg salad was perfectly cooked and everything I'd come to expect from 1300.   It's when we got to the entrees that it went downhill. \u00a0The short rib was not the usual bone in cut. Actually, there was no bone to be found which means all that good flavor you get from cooking it with the bone and marrow was absent. The result was a \"short rib\" that was dry as a bone.  The pork chop came out harder than concrete and we couldn't even saw through it to cut off a piece much less chew it. \u00a0This is the first time in years where we've had no choice but to send something back. \u00a0But for an entree that cost $27 we wanted to be able to eat it. While one of us was finishing off the Sahara short rib the other waited for a new pork chop. \u00a0No consideration was taken by the wait staff or management to make things right or compensate us for our inconvenience. \u00a0  I guess the icing on the cake was the lukewarm Mac n' cheese. \u00a0Not very appetizing when served at room temperature.   I understand restaurants sometimes have an off night. \u00a0Maybe thats what last night was. \u00a0But with so many great restaurants in the city I'd think that obvious mistakes would be fixed by such an upscale restaurant. \u00a0Sadly, fine dining was not how I would sum up last nights 1300 experience.",

I ordered the bouillabaisse, which I really enjoyed, but there was so much good food on the table that I wished I had ordered something else. Food envy, big time!  The atmosphere and music was great. I ran into Willie Brown in the men's room. We had a quick laugh -- he spilled red wine, but saved his pricey suit.  Overall a great place. Pricier than I would have hoped, but oh well.

    "review_text": "This was a DAT attempt that miserably failed. It's not offered on Saturdays and I was made aware of the fact the morning of by a friend. It was late to look for another dinner place for a Saturday night with 9 people so I stuck with it. The good yelp reviews gave me confidence.   We thought we had gotten there early but the parking garage nearby was full and street parking was scarce. We ended up being just on time for our 7:30pm reservation. I always pass by this area of Fillmore but it's a little shady at night. Things do change when it's dark out! Make sure to walk with someone!  I appreciated this place right off the bat. We were given a round table for our party. Yay! Usually when you have a larger party, you're given a long table. I understand it's a space saver in the restaurant but it's hard to interact and have good conversation when you are limited to just the few people sitting around you. We had a great time. I also loved the ambiance here. This place is just snazzy! And I don't use that word often. But you can already tell it will be a great environment after you visit their website. They both have a similiar feel.  After we sat down for sometime, the complimentary cornbread came and it was hot and flaky. It was great with the sweet butter and sweet jalapeno jelly. I don't even like jalapenos! But this was not bad. My bf and I shared the shrimp hushpuppies with ancho chile remoulade. It was a bit of a surprise when we were given six shrimp fried in hushpuppy breading. Nevertheless it was flavorful and tasty.   My friend got a Pear Flower cocktail and I had a sip. I'd say if you don't want a strong tasting drink, this is the one to go with. It smelled and tasted great! For my entree I got the Surf N' Turf of Oven-Roast Divers Scallop-Foie, Beef Short Rib with Mashed Potatoes. I think the scallops could have been more tender but I loved the foie gras on top. The beef short rib was a little too shredded for my taste. I just prefer a more solid piece of meat as my \"turf\". Still it was enjoyable.   My bf got the Black Skillet Fried Chicken and we both expected that delicious crispy chicken skin. Unfortunutely the skin was soft and a little lacking in the flavors we love about fried chicken. We probably won't skip it next time around. For dessert, we shared the Apple Bread Pudding. Again, it was good but nothing too memorable. I do wish there was a little more ice cream to go with the dessert. For $9, I think I'd rather go to 2223 for their bread pudding which I think is the best in the city.  The DAT menu didn't work out but our date night was a lot of fun. I think even without DAT I got a good sense of the food here. 1300 on Fillmore, thanks for providing a lovely time! I say 3.5 stars.",

I had lived near Fillmore Street for many years until recently and like to patronize these businesses. \u00a0I, however, had an awful experience there this past NYE and will not be returning. We spent a great deal of money eating and drinking and ordered a expensive bottles of champagne. A group of inebriated people no more than 23 were allowed to continue to drink, act rudely, fall into people who are dressed for NYE and not deal with it. There is a great deal more to this story and it doesn't end well, but I will leave it at that. \u00a0The management is not very good and seemed to be more akin to management at a pub vs a nice restaurant. \u00a0I know what 1300 would like to be, based on the owners, but they're not there yet. They need to stop hiring their friends and hire some professional hospitality industry types who know how to provide service.  Two notable things - the bar tenders who were not particularly friendly that night continued to server this drunk 23 year olds and made it worse. Second, the manager was so incredibly disrespectful. I would have expected him to ask questions. I will never forget the rude treatment from the manager. The only positive experience we had that night is that the women at the hostess stand were very sweet and polite. My friends who were dealing with the bartenders all night said they were also very rude and we wondered why someone who doesn't seem to like people would want to bartend??",

I came here with a group of friends because of \"Dine about town\" The food is decent but it is totally overpriced for what it is.   Also, such a nice lounge/bar area -- yet the bartender can't even make a decent drink! All our drinks --- and we ordered different ones --- were \"Sour Head\" Candy tart (wtf?!). When the 4 of us called our server over, she said \"too tart?\" clearly this was not the first time. We wanted to send our drinks back, and our server suggested fixing the drink by putting simple syrup in there --- Uhhh NO! Why would I want something super tart with a ton of extra calories from simple syrup. We went with a bottle of wine, it was safer.   We did family style so these are the dishes I tried:  cornbread = warm and yummy with the butter shrimp &amp; grits = OK hushpuppies = Delicious half rack of ribs (dinner special) = dry, overcooked, no flavor, too much sauce oyster chowder soup = good crab salad = STINGY piece of crab for the price fried chicken = good but too much breast meat, nothing special dessert - choc chip cookies + vanilla ice cream = for $7 give me more than a measly scoop of ice cream to go with 2 cookies.  The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 2 is because the wait staff was really nice and fun -- and the food is decent, even tho it's completely overpriced.",

Our server/waitress was very patient and calm with our rowdy table of 8 ladies buzzin off cocktails and wine. But the food was a disaster!! all way over priced and not delicious.y'all need to work on your seasoning technique, and portion size. I ordered the crispy skin king salmon dish, and i think it literally had 2 tablespoons of sweet potato risotto. Sorry, you know when food is the bomb when you say \"mmmm\" and not one person said that at our table. and the white truffle mac and cheese, I've had better mac and cheese from a box , seriously overrated. \u00a0  the ambience was fabulous, and you kind of feel like your encouraged to use your library voice. i think the only thing i liked was the cornbread and the service. we are most definitely not coming back here, nor am i suggesting this restaurant to anyone.",

    "review_text": "There are so many restaurants to choose from in SF that when you're in the mood for a splurge it's hard to go back to one you've already enjoyed if, like me, you don't splurge as often as you'd like. Sure you can go back to your favorite burger bar repeatedly but when there are a lot of top end restaurants to try, the risk of going back somewhere that you hold in high regard and finding that it's not as good as you remember or time has embellished your experience, is risky.   I first took The Missus here for her birthday in 2011 and had one of the best meals I've ever eaten in the city. I still dream of the hickory smoked spare ribs that were on special and the cornbread that's lighter on your tongue than Wayne Sleep is lighter on his feet. Looking for a special place to take my folks who were in town from the UK, The Missus and I took the gamble to go back to 1300 Filmore. It offers something you don't get in the UK, Southern style cooking, but it has a lighter, more sophisticated edge.   The ambiance is just as I remembered, if not better. Relaxing, classy but also with a buzz. Jazz legends adorned the walls as we sipped on our cocktails, reclining in leather armchairs but the night was given even more of an oomph when we could hear house music playing subtlety but noticeably in the background. The \"European accent\" that enhances the food has tripped on into the sound system.   The cornbread remained delicious and I ordered the Maple Syrup Slow Braised Beef Short Ribs. Beef that again dissolved on my tongue. The mash was delicious (though still not as good as the mash served at Maze in London but that was something else entirely). The mac and cheese with truffle was rich and creamy.   For our appetizers we shared the Shrimp Hushpuppies which were, for me, the lowest point of the meal either slightly over done or the oil was a little old but I was in the minority. The rest of the party lapped them up. We were persuaded by the waiter to try the Barbecue Shrimp N Creamy Grits. I really don't like grits but good Lord they were delicious. Light, creamy and not that sloppy grainy texture I'm used to. In true Southern style I couldn't stop myself from mopping the plate with the remnants of the cornbread.   By the time we got to dessert we were all pleasantly full but just for kicks shared the homemade cookies and ice-cream. The texture of the cookies was another melt in the mouth taste sensation though the cinnamon was a little overdone \u00a0but, seeing as Americans can't get enough of the spice, I doubt this is a bad thing for most diners.   Dinner was fantastically rounded of with a visit from the chef, a fellow Brit who, like so many I've met, came to SF for a short trip and never went home. I'm so glad he didn't. I'd have no qualms in recommending 1300 Filmore to anyone or indeed to going back again and again.",

I should add that until the end of February, 1300 On Fillmore is featuring a special Black History Month menu: \u00a0four courses, all of which are also available a la carte, paired with wines from Black-owned wineries. \u00a0Such a lovely idea ... and that Black Coyote Cab (not available, usually, by the glass) has **layers**.  1300 On Fillmore, my answered prayer: \u00a0I am so happy we finally met!",

    "review_text": "I really wanted to love this place but eventually walked out just liking it enough to consider going back again. Off the bat, they have a cool main entry door. The interior is decent with a cool vibe about it. Dimly lit, a lounge just off to the left with a live jazz bland playing and the main dining room to the right, this place has all the makings of a great evening out - whether it be fancy or chill.   The food however, lacked the same sort of coolness evoked by the space. Mildly inflated prices aside, I was a little confused by the menu's direction. Self-described as a culinary fusion between jamaican/british/french backgrounds, most of the dishes seemed like embellished \"soul food\" dishes that sort of missed the mark on the soul or the embellishment. Our table sampled the mac-n-cheese, the shrimp-n-grits, corn bread and I had the catfish.  Ok, ok fine. The catfish was dope. Served over a bed of dirty rice(?), I had the hit dish of the table. The corn bread was also delicious and could have been better if served hot. The shrimp-grits were OK. The mac-n-cheese was terrible but was a highly contested split decision for the table. While some liked it, \u00a0I found it bland and watered down; the noodles were mush. That said, I managed to also sample the fried chicken which I swear tasted like an Indian dish.   The service was good. I want to try their short ribs because apparently that is THE must try dish. I think this place has a great idea that fits well for the area (believe me, it's much needed and welcome) but I'm not sold on the food just yet. That said, I'm all for grabbing a drink at this place.",

The bride and groom had already decided the menu. You could choose \u00a0either steak or fried chicken. I choose the steak. We started with the shrimp and grits. The shrimp we nicely seasoned, but the way the flavors of the shrimp played with the grits were a delight to my palette! My steak with Brie and spinach was Devine, I will say some of my party does not like rare to medium rare so they were not as pleased as I. For our desert we had a small tart with Chantelle. That desert was a nice cool refresh to my pallet. I even ate my husbands...it was that good.   I found our waitress kind and attentive. In all a solid choice!",

Melty all in my mouth. +Fat Fries= Just as they sound. Soft, yet crispy. Expertly seasoned. +Brussels Sprouts. Yeah, we are just HUGE fans of sprouts in general and so for this cheat meal, had to have them doused in butter, onions, and bacon.  We both got RibEye burgers for dinner because that's what we wanted to for our cheat meal... hot, juicy burgers :) And that's just what we got. The meat was perfectly cooked to Medium-Rare. Beautiful open-face presentation.  Finished off with a seasonal chocolate mousse. Small but still delicious.  Great atmosphere. Would love to try out the bar/lounge area.  Minus a star because parking is quite difficult to traverse / deal with. No valet...which is fine. But then we waited for about 20 minutes after our reservation time to be sat in a tiny corner table right by the Hostess Stand. Waited about 5-10 minutes for anyone to greet us and provide us with anything more than water. No features. Server just seemed flustered and asked us \"are you ready to order?\"   Regardless. Really overwhelmed with how delicious the food is here....perfect for boyfriend and I's cheat meal.",

Unfortunately we were not impressed with the food and even less so with the service.   The place looks modern with touches of zen style even though the food is Southern inspired. It's a bit loud and the crowed was mixed from locals to non city dwellers. \u00a0We were seated promptly and our waiter came by to tell us specials and then a few minutes later to take our order. \u00a0  We started with the fried oysters and then ordered the risotto and maple short ribs. \u00a0I also asked to taste a wine before ordering it. \u00a0The bread arrived, then the oysters, still no wine. \u00a0Then finally my husbands wine arrives and my taste, but no waiter. \u00a0We had to waive him down so I could order my wine, no apology or even acknowledgment that our food arrived before the drinks. \u00a0 The oysters were good, not oily at all but the dip with it lacked elegance and texture it should be, it was like mayo and overpowered the oysters.  Then our dishes arrive, the short ribs were good, but a but dry. \u00a0They were lean and falling off the bone so nicely done dish overall.  The risotto was a different story, it looked more like fried rice shaped into a tartar presentation than risotto and there was so much stuff in it the taste was lost, the flavor was confusing and it just was not risotto by any standard. \u00a0It looked and tasted like a mushy mess. \u00a0  We wanted to finish the meal with dessert and ordered the peach cobbler. \u00a0When it arrived it looked like a store dessert and when we tried it, all it was was sugar, no taste of peaches, which were chopped in huge peaces and swimming in water. \u00a0My husband who usually never sends things back, sent this back.   When the bill arrived they took the dessert off the tab but charged us for different wine that was more than our selections, we had to explain it twice for them to fix the tab. \u00a0Again our waiter was nowhere to be seen.",

The food is sophisticated soul/comfort food, and it is de-lic-ious! They are known for their fried chicken and their braised short ribs, both of which are to die for!

I came here the other day and I had a quite memorable experience. \u00a0The food, ambiance and service were all fantastic! I came here because it's literally right next door to Yoshi's and thought it would be great to just walk over to Yoshi's after dinner. I mean come on - what's better than soul food and Jazz!?   Upon entering this restaurant, I loved loved the decor. It's modern, homey and welcoming all at the same time. They took some modern pieces and mixed it with some \"old school\"pieces, but somehow most of everything worked in this restaurant.  Our waiter was funny and gave us some great recommendations and had a great sense of humor. Food was served promptly, water was refilled and dishes were cleared. AWESOME.  In terms of the food and drinks - drinks were fabulous. Most of them tasted like their namesakes like the Key Lime Pie, Jazzberry, Pear Flower (my fav) and the Spicey Blood Orange (not sure of the exact name of this one, but my hubby loved it). Food here is good...for the most part.   Recommended Dishes: 1. Braised Pork Belly (appetizer): Surprisingly a good size portion of meat with very little fat. I wished the meat was more tender, but the dish definitely had enough flavor. 2. Grits with BBQ Shrimp (appetizer): A good solid dish, not exactly out of this world, but definitely good. I like the grit portion more than the Shrimp. 3. Shrimp Hushpuppies (appetizer): another good solid dish, but not mind-blowingly good. 4. Maple Syrup Glazed Short Ribs: MY FAVORITE dish of the night. The meat was fall apart tender and the flavor was melt-in-your-mouth-i'm-in-heaven good. Even my husband said it was good. Which is a HUGE compliment - trust me. I'd come back here just for this dish alone. 5. Fried Chicken: Yes it was good, tender and flavorful. I've had better chicken but this dish seemed to be a big hit with everyone at the table except for my husband and I. Perhaps it's cause we're low class chicken eaters (if there is such a thing). But I'm assuming that this is how authentic fried chicken tastes like.  6. Spiced Fat Fries (side): Contrary to other reviews, these fries do have spice AND the homemade ketchup that comes on the side gives this dish a nice tang!   NOT RECOMMENDED: 1. Filet Mignon: Lacks in flavor 2. Rib Eye: Good in flavor, but cooked incorrectly. My friend had to send this dish back because the first time it was overdone and the second time it was underdone.  Some other highlights are the FREE cornbread with the jalapeno jelly and honey better. While the cornbread is not exactly moist, the jalapeno jelly adds a nice kick! \u00a0The chocolate beignettes...good. Not the best. But how can you go wrong with fried batter stuffed with chocolate?! I think not!  All in all, a good meal and a good time. I would highly recommend this place, esp. if you're going to Yoshi's to afterwards. There's a parking garage across the street and around the corner as well as street parking. Expect to pay about $60-$85/person. We ordered drinks (one per person), a bottle of wine, 4 appetizers and a main dish for everyone and ended up paying $85/person. While this is pricey, trust me...we INDULGED in every way we possibly could.   Definitely recommended.",

I have taken to hanging out in the lounge area where we sit and drink plenty of cocktails and taste yummy dishes while we talk the night away. It is a very inviting environment... a lot more than the place next door that I just don't think I will ever go back to... unless... well... there is GOOD reason.   The decor makes me wish I could have experienced first hand what it was like back in the good old jazz days of Fillmore... it is cozy, warm, inviting... the waitstaff is great too... the facilities are splendid... and you can always see the head chef and owner along with his partner and wife cruising the floor and saying hello to their guests. I seriously can't say enough as to how excited \u00a0I am that they exist... Just can't get enough. This is one upscale place I am not going to complain about paying for. I know... it is friend chicken... but see... this ambiance and service... I am willing to pay for.",

Everything earned 5 stars! \u00a0Service, food, ambiance, drinks, entertainment and overall experience were all above and beyond expectations. \u00a0I recommend requesting a table further away from the band as it can be pretty loud if you are near the speakers but the performance is really great! \u00a0  Their eggs benedict inspired me to learn how to make hollandaise and was so delicious that I had to recreate the recipe so I can make it at home. \u00a0Served on a biscuit and topped with a tabasco hollandaise, the dish was definitely the favorite of the morning, although all others were delicious as well. \u00a0I had the french toast which was nothing super spectacular but still quite tasty. \u00a0They served a basket of biscuits, scones and cornbread with honey butter and pepper jelly which we devoured. \u00a0I could have just eaten those and skipped the main meal! \u00a0Very yummy. \u00a0Throw in some bottomless pomegranate mimosas and you have the recipe for an extraordinary brunch experience.",

A group of friends and I dined here for dinner on a weekend. The decor is very sheik and they have a nice bar. The ambiance also gives off that jazz vibe and you know you're in for a good experience.   The dishes get high marks for presentation. Everything looked great. I ordered the BBQ shrimp and grits to start. It was flavorful. For my entree, I went with the steak. It was a little more pink than what I had ordered but OK. We shared several desserts including the chocolate beignets and chocolate chip cookies with ice cream. The beignets were a little greasy for me and tasted a little burnt.   1300 is definitely a nice romantic date place but you can also come with a group of friends. The service is accommodating and attentive.",

    "review_text": "You can take the Girl outta Texas, but you can't take the Texas outta the girl! I grew up eating fried chicken, grits and biscuits, so I know my southern food. I was in charge of picking the restaurant for our post new year's dinner with some out of town guests. I was really excited to try this place since having their delicious shrimp n' grits at the Fillmore Festival. I will have to say I absolutely love the decor, it's cozy and filled with unpretentious style...but that's where it stops.  They should be ashamed to call themselves southern comfort food, because true \"Southern Comfort\" comes with \"Southern Hospitality\" and that they did NOT have, the host was rude, slow and he let us wait 45 min in the bar area while 1/2 the restaurant was empty tables. They were \"closing down half the restaurant\" WTH is that? Never in my entire dining experience have I ever heard of that when. When there are guests waiting, seat them. PERIOD!   There was also an empty table in the \"front room\", that sat empty, just looking at us. So we asked the host why we couldn't sit there...then he says oh, we can try to \"squeeze you\" on that table, turns out there was plenty of room!! Idiot! What?!! So we you mean we were waiting at the bar for no reason?   Onto the food part. The host comes over and says, \"management was notified of the problem and will be sending out appetizers on the house.\" So some redemption there...but just wait...it goes downhill from there. They comped us the Fat Fries spiced with a little cinnamon and nutmeg were good, but anything would've been good since we were starving by then! Then mini pulled pork sliders...ehh, they were just ok...I've made better at home with my All Clad Crockpot!   The Special of the Day: Baby Back Ribs....mmm a Texas girl can't resist ribs...we ordered a full rack for the table to eat as appies...uh BOMB or should I say BOMBED...the ribs were extremely dry and lackluster in flavor. Resisted the temptation to ask for an entire jar of BBQ sauce to give the ribs some flavor...  The flavoring of the Grits was on point, though a little cold and cold grits are ick! Makes you feel like you are eating cold butter. They should use those hot clay pots to keep them warm.  Fried chicken was just mediocre...dry and a little overdone. Not greasy which was good, but a little too over-fried and hard...I cut the roof of my mouth from the rock hard batter. Whoever said the fried chicken was the best in town here, has absolutely no clue about fried chicken (but then again we are in California). I much prefer town halls fried chicken. Biscuits were delish however, they got that one right. Blackened Catfish was pretty good, Braised Short Rib was slightly bland, it was a bit flavorless without the sauce. Chive mashed potatoes were really good. Mac and cheese didn't have that cheesy oomph. The Coleslaw was good, different and more mustardy than I've had. I'd have to say that the Brussels sprouts were really good, even though I forgot to ask to add bacon (for an additional $1.50)  And to add insult to injury, they charged us for the comps!!! They apologized and immediately took it off. The waiter said \"Sorry, it slipped my mind.\" Is this some kind of joke?  1.5 Stars",

There are definitely cheaper and better places to have southern food in SF. Make sure you have your whole party there. They will not seat you until your ENTIRE party is there. The highlight of the meal was the bbq shrimp with grits. I had one bite of it and was excited for the rest of the meal. I guess I got excited too early. Sad Face. We also got the fry seafood starter..crisp but nothing out of the ordinary. The catfish was flaky. The mac and cheese with truffle oil was too overpowering with truffle. I guess they really wanted to give you the best bang for your buck. The fried chicken that so many people raved about was just eh. I would have to say usually service doesn't really matter to me until tonight. The service was so slow and we needed to ask multiple people for items. I would have to say the food was alright but the service made it less appealing. I am glad we had a discount from Blackboard. It definitely made the experience better.",

That said, the service is ridiculous!! The prices are high, and the drinks are slow in arriving.   We had a reservation for 8:45 p.m., party of 10. Two of our guests arrived before 8:45 to secure our table as we \u00a0made our way through the city with our birthday girl.   We arrived at 8:56 to be told by a rude and tasteless hostess that we should \"go over there and wait.\" Over 30 minutes of standing around goes by when I grab the man in charge of the reservation and make my way up to her to find out what is going on, only to be told that our table had been given away because she \"didn't know what to do.\" \u00a0She proceeded to tell us that we were very late for our reservation so she gave our table away because she didn't know what to do. She lectured us saying we should have called, despite the fact that 2 people from our party were standing in front of her at 8:30 telling her we were on our way! She should have saved our table or more reasonably given it to our early party members! We weren't even 10 minutes late.   We asked to speak to a manager 4 times. He never showed up. The waiter was ok, he was SLOW as molasses in the wintertime! The drinks were slower...and the manager, well he came out, stared over the crowd (it was very crowded and HOT), and never showed up to talk to us!  Finally our bill came many hours later (we closed the place), we held our bill hostage until we were given a manager. The owner showed up. Our bill was $370+ so I guess she assumed she should collect.   She asked us if we were doing ok, and we said \"yeah sort of, the food was good.\" We proceeded to tell her the problems we had, people decided not to come because of the hostess, etc. My bestfriend (birthday girl) had to deal with stupid hostess-girl's drama because she was rude and unprofessional to us. And all the owner does is comp us a shitty $6 cookie that no one ordered! (it was a birthday thing, and it really sucked).   All in all, the food is good. Here's how it went down:  Salads: they suck! they're not worth the prices so SKIP  Entrees:  The chicken is pretty bomb, fried and good, which it should be for $23.  The pork chops: dry and just so so Beef Rib: good, not dry due to sauce, tender  Drinks: Decent, pricey, take too long to arrive  Dessert:  Don't bother you've already been robbed.  Last note: owner is a money grubbing tight ass who does not care about her patrons and hasn't the sense to hire respectable people to deal with her high paying costumers. Although she boasts about her desire to make it feel comfortable and intimate, \"a place where people are happy and feel like they're family,\" \u00a0sadly, people feel like it is a hot, loud, expensive drama-fest.",

We hung out for a bit in their lounge chairs while waiting for the rest of our friends and admiring the decor and art in the place. It felt like a very sophisticated, yet not stuffy atmosphere.  I got myself the biscuits and sausage gravy with eggs. Mmmmm so good and so rich. The eggs were heavenly and the gravy and biscuits were incredible. I wish they had salt at the table though, I wanted a dash more salt.  Since bottomless pomosas (champagne and Pama pomegranate liquor with a splash of juice), were $12, and the normal mimosas were $9, I figured, hey, get the bottomless and drink two, and you've made it back! The pomosas were pretty tasty. Our server kept refilling it so fast I couldn't really track how much I drank, so I stopped somewhere around 2.5 as I had to drive back.  I tried a bit of my friend's french toast, and it was very good as well.  My friend tempted me into getting the cashew cinnamon rolls, and even managed to tempt the rest of the table after I was tempted. They were really good! Warm, sweet, cinnamon-y, with a bit of crunch, what else do you want?  Service was excellent, putting up with my rapidly changing demands.  The total was came out to be about $27 a person before tip. So a bit pricey but very good. Tip bumps it up to above $31.  I'm taking the rating down from a 5 to a 4.5 because the music, even if very good, was just too damn loud and we couldn't hear each other talk. The lady singing was quite good, even if she pulled off annoying if very impressive stunts like holding a really high note for a really long time.",

    "review_text": "After hearing all of the hype surrounding 1300 on Fillmore, we decided to give it a try since it is within walking distance of our apartment. To start, the new Yoshi's and this restaurant have really classed up the surrounding blocks, which depending on your perspective, could be a good or bad thing. As for 1300 itself, we found the interior to be very warm and inviting with the rich chocolate brown hues, and cozy seating. The food itself was great - I'd highly recommend both the fried chicken and short ribs, and the wine list had a nice mix of varietals and some good by-the-glass options.   That being said, things fell apart in the service department. We had an 8pm reservation and weren't seated until 8:50pm due to a mistake on the part of the hostess. Luckily my wife and I are fairly laid back people and found our way to the bar to enjoy a pre-dinner glass of wine, but we found the wait (and more importantly, the reason for the wait) entirely unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber. We barely even got an apology, which was pretty lame as well. Once we were seated, it look us until 9:30 to be served the appetizers we ordered, and the waiter was a bit scatter-brained, although certainly a very nice fellow. All in all, we had an enjoyable evening, but I would hesitate to go back due to the lackluster service. There are too many other restaurants in San Francisco that serve equally delicious food and don't drop the ball \u00a0 on the service.",

For dessert, four of us shared a Peach Cobbler, which was delicious. \u00a0Very fragrant, very peachy. \u00a0  Plus some cocktails, the bill was about $200 after tips and taxes for four. \u00a0And oh yeah, this is one of the many restaurants that DO charge a 4% surplus for Employee Healthcare. \u00a0Much like the skyrocketing gas price, I don't even bat an eye anymore. \u00a0It has officially joined the rest of the daily nuisances that you learn to live with in San Francisco. \u00a0MUNI will always be shitty, SF real estate will always be out of reach, and restaurants are gonna charge you that 4%.

Favorites of the night included the shrimp grits and the peach cobbler. The peach cobbler was still warm! They also have beignets, but didn't get to try them, I was too full!

Also skin is left on underneath the crispy batter...off putting for someone like me who does not eat chicken skin.  -- 1 star for wait staff: our waiter took forever to take our order, long pauses between courses. The Indian busser who did check on us was such a sourpuss; He looked so pissed off when we asked for an extra knife (which btw, besides drink refills, was the *only* thing we asked for.)   My group is usually super forgiving of any service missteps b/c we realize being a waiter/busser is damn hard work, but the neglect was too blatant to dismiss here.

The evening was so perfect that I would not change a thing about it.  We had a 7 course meal (I can't remember bc I only ate half of them) and the courses I ate were DELICIOUS. We were told by almost all of our guests that we had the best wedding food ever. The staff were very attentive, and the bartender kept the drinks flowing. A few guests enjoyed the open bar too much and dropped their drinks on the dance floor. The staff were very responsive and rushed to clean up everything immediately. We didn't put a lot of effort into decorating (just centerpieces and tea lights) as 1300 is already a beautiful setting.   Best wedding reception EVER. Thank you 1300!!!",

G.R.I.T.S like myself (girl raised in the south) know a good soul food dish and this was delicious.  The entrees of the braised short rib and fried chicken left me a bit disappointed. I've had better fried chicken at Hard Knox or Farmer Brown and I wasn't a fan of the latter. The sides were only ok...white cheddar mac and cheese and fat fries. Not worth the caloric intake. I had to salt everything, which is not something i normally do.  The dessert was less than memorable. If Happy Birthday wasn't scrawled on the plate I would have said the mudpie was perhaps the least impressive part of the meal.  Food aside for a moment, the decor was spot on and the wine list has a few gems. We ordered a great Rose and Roussanne for under $40 apiece. Hooray!  **Corkage is $15**",

Upon arrival, we were immediately soaking in our setting -- the fancy but laid back decor and the live music really made it quite an experience.   My personal favorite part of the meal had to be the complimentary corn bread and the different flavored scones. I probably would've been satisfied just eating those. All of us decided to go for the salmon on the pancake dish with the cajun shrimp grits as a starter. Let me start by saying, the shrimp grits was bomb! I wish I had ordered an order just for myself.  Here's where the ball was dropped. When the waiter came out, he had 4 salmon dishes and one salad. Well nobody ordered the salad! The waiter was initially on his way to argue to tell us that someone ordered the salad but eventually caved in and \u00a0decided to make us another dish. At this point, Eva decided to go with the catfish po boy (much better than the salmon dish IMO). The thing that I didn't like about the salmon dish was that it was literally smoked salmon with a bit of garnish sitting on an unsweetened pancake. If I know that it was just smoked salmon, I most definitely would've opted for another dish.  Well, you live and learn. Either way, I liked the look and feel of the gospel brunch and the food really isn't too bad. I'll be back but best believe I will not order the salmon dish again.",

On the day of i called in advance to let them know we would be running just 15 minutes late. The hostess answered that we have an hour and a half limit on our table and it may cut into our time. I said okay... but no, not cool! Rushed on over and they sat us down immediately. Long story short - you know they won't kick you out until you're done :)  Our waiter was an absolute gentlemen and never made us feel rushed once and gave us a great suggestion. The fixed menu didn't sound too great. For the same price, i could get what i really wanted directly off the regular dinner menu and went ahead with that.The Shrimp and Grits starter has great texture and flavorful shrimp. It wasn't too grainy and it wasn't over salted. We wiped that plate clean!   It was a toss up for me between two very dishes. I finally landed on the Fried Chicken because it's one of their more well known dishes. Really good! But i wish i had gone with another dish. The chicken has a crunchy, tasty, fried skin. It was moist and cooked very well. I just couldn't differentiate it from any other well cooked fried chicken dishes.   I would bring a date with a love for comfort food to 1300. It's dimly lit, the food is fantastic, and the place looks impressive.",

When we got there, I was transformed to what must be the heydey of Fillmore Street and transported to a snapshot of its history. I got a glimpse as to why this place was actually coined the 'harlem of the west'.   The space design is fantastic...small tables feel romantic and private yet they also accommodate larger groups. They had a great dining area and also a happening looking lounge and bar --which especially merchandised the Fillmore jazz heritage.  Each course was delectable -- gourmet soul food done in a modern way. Everything had an upscale/foodie spin on it that was irresistible. Their wine list was fantastic, too.",

    "review_text": "Went here for dinner after Blackboard eats had a 30% off deal. I must say, I was fairly disappointed with the whole affair.  SERVICE  Summed up: fairly terrible. Our waiter was the slowest guy on earth, the drinks took 20 minutes to be served, and the appetizer came out with our meals. After waiting for 25 minutes, I was finally able to track down one of the runners to procure some cornbread. That is not how a well-oiled restaurant should work.  FOOD Cornbread - OK. After everyone raving about how tasty it was, I found it to be too-dry, very crumbly, and less-sweet than I was hoping (I like my cornbread to have a slightly sweet taste). It wasn't terrible, but after one triangle, I was A-OK with not eating any more.  Sweet pea corn bisque - Amazing. This was definitely the highlight of the night. The texture was very light &amp; frothy, with the pea not overwhelming the corn, and the bisque not being too creamy. I wanted seconds!  Catfish - vert tasty when mixed together! The fish itself was dry, but the dirty risotto was incredible. Mix it all together and the dish is transformed. It may be a little salty for some people, but I love salt so it was right up my alley. The catfish didn't have too much seasoning, so if you don't like your meat touching your other food, stay away ;)  Fried chicken - blah. This was definitely the most-disappointing part of the meal. The breading is super-thick and crunchy, to the point where it almost hurt to chew. The chicken was dry, the mashed potatoes had ZERO taste, and there was no gravy on any of the dish. When i asked for gravy, i was bought au-jus for the steak. What the hell? Farmer Brown, Little Skillet, Gussies...all had better fried chicken, and I don't think their fried chicken is all that great. Way to go 1300, you failed.  I guess to wrap it up, I will not be giving 1300 another go. For the price, it was an absolute waste.",

The service was great: friendly and efficient. In fact, maybe a little too efficient as the food seemed to fly out of the kitchen shortly after we ordered it. Made the pace of the meal seem hurried, though they weren't exactly hurrying us along. Just the tempo of the evening.  We had a good meal: - Fresh Water Shrimp Hushpuppies, Ancho Chile Remoulade - Little Gem Salad, Green Goddess Dressing, Spiced Molasses Glazed Pecan, Cornbread Croutons - Black Skillet Fried Chicken, Buttermilk Whipped Potatoes, Pan Gravy - Half rack of ribs with cole slaw and mac 'n cheese - Chocolate beignets and banana cream pie for dessert.  The shrimp were just fried shrimp, nothing special. The remoulade was flavorful.  I really liked the salad, but sweetie wasn't crazy about it. For me, little gems are the perfect lettuce.  We both enjoyed the chicken and the ribs quite a bit. \u00a0I'd definitely come back for these.  Desserts were OK. I didn't care for the pie.  The ambiance was pleasant without being stuffy. The crowd was diverse, which isn't something you see in San Francisco very often at an upscale establishment. It was rather refreshing.  Sadly, there was no music. It might have been piped in, but I was in the mood to hear some jazz.  Great public parking across the street.  All in all, it was a very enjoyable experience. I'd definitely recommend it to others looking for southern cooking but willing to pay for a nice atmosphere and white tablecloths.",

    "review_text": "This place has good food but it also has the WORST customer service &amp; \"Event Director\" ever!   I have been dining and supporting this establishment since they first opened their doors and over the years I have recommended countless family, friends and clients.   With that said, unfortunately, I have lost count of how many times the wait staff has forgotten to bring my left over food packages to my table before I have paid &amp; departed. Only to get all the way home and call for them to say, \"Sorry we forgot but we've thrown it out.\" It's happened so many times that I now tell them to bring the box out as soon as they pack the food up.  Recently, I called to reserve their private room for my birthday dinner Ina Saturday in March. The room seats 22 people and they request a $1500 min plus tax &amp; service. That's roughly about $90 a person, kids included. Hello, this is not a wedding but just a dinner! I politely asked Kaley, the Event Director if she could lower the minimum. Without hesitation she said no. I explained my history as a customer and the support that I have given in the community in which they're located and still the answer was no. I asked her to ask the owners Chef Lawrence and Monetta and get back to me but I never heard back from her.  It just so happens that I saw Ms. Kaley tonight at an event where 1300 was providing minuscule samples of food for the guests. Boy was she surprised to see me! I told her who I was and that I never heard back from her regarding the owners' response to my request. She said that they also said no. I asked why hadn't she gotten back to me and she simply shrugged her shoulders and turned away. Great customer service &amp; professionalism right? I have many good friends who know the owners, one of which was with me tonight. She plans to speak with Monetta and get to the bottom of this nonsense because no one, especially those who show as much support to 1300 as the people who would've attended my dinner, deserves to be treated this way.   Needless to say, they have lost my business and referrals, which I am sure they can obviously care less about.",

I had the prixe fix which consisted of a tomato salad, halibut over an okra concoction and peach cobbler with ice cream, and hurricane.  Strong impressive drinks! The cornbread that came out with the meal was a bit dry and the apple jelly and butter really needed to be used to enjoy the bread.  The shrimp and grits were YUMMY! I must try this at home, if I can!  My boyfriend enjoyed his dinner which is what we came there for! My dinner was so-so. The tomato salad really was just a bunch of tomatoes, the halibut could have had more seasoning but I guess they dont want to overseason and the peach cobbler was yummy but pretty small.  Plus it was his birthday and they gave him my peach cobbler. I wondered what they would have done if I hadnt ordered dessert?!?  Anyway, the ambiance (candlelight) was what gave it an extra point. Sometimes you just want to drop your kid off to family and have a night to yourselves and thats exactly what we got at 1300. A lil romance and enough food to settle our stomachs before we headed to Yoshi's to toast the night away for awhile.  Parking is crazy. Park across the street if you can. Some how we lucked out and only paid $8 (no validation, we forgot!!!) even though we had dinner at 8 and left Yoshi's at 145-2am! Not bad at all!!!",

Firstly, Id like to start with the decor. Awesome. Simply, oozing with the \"smooth-ness\" that one could only associate with a jazzy type atmosphere. The lighting, soft but not so dark you cant see your date across the table. The lounge area with big oversized stuffed couches and 50s era pictures illuminated with lights makes you feel instantly sexy and classy all at once. The food was flavorful from start to finish with the wait staff very attentive and not overbearing.  and on to the food, for starters: house made cornbread with apple butter- holy smokes! Did I order dessert before my meal? So warm and just out of oven, perfect to go along with the bourbon braised pork belly. The pork belly was tender and had just enough fat to add flavor without being overbearing.  The braised beef short ribs with onions rings and mashed potatoes were perfect and could not have satisfied me more. The beef was falling off the ribs without as much of a pinky-fingers worth of pressure from my fork.  Now I know plenty of restaurants are showcasing southern love with the addition of fried chicken to their menus, and 1300 is no different. Not one piece was overcooked or greasy. Each being tender and juicy with a \u00a0light crispy skin.  Each plate had generous portions, well worth the money. I just wish I had saved room for dessert.

We tried the greens w/ ham hawks as well as the mac and cheese as appetizers. Very good!  This dinner specials were DAT so we also got to try the Cat fish w/ andouille risotto. That was really rich and a tad salty. I still devoured every bite.   The service is a little DRY and borderline non-friendly. Minus one star.

Luckily the restaurant is near a garage and it did help that it was a tuesday night.   So for appetizers we had Sea &amp; Swine Whiskey smoked pork belly, bay scallops, braised cabbage, mustard gastrique, \u00a0House Smoked Hot Link: Chicken Andouille Sausage, Pipperade, Duo of Mustards , a side dish of mac and cheese and truffle, and the shrimp and grits. All were very exceptional except the mac and cheese. I did not taste the truffle at all and the asiago cheese was very overpowering. But for starters the food was very good!!!  For an entree I ordered the Green Tea Smoked Rainbow Trout Roasted Heirloom Potatoes, Blue Lake Beans and Pistachio,Brown Butter. I ate the dish in about 2 minutes. It was that good. Everything on the plate just worked together beautifully.   I order a lemondrop martini at every restaurant, so it is only customary that I do the same here. They are absolutely delicious here!! A definite plus!  I had the apple cobbler for dessert and It was just ok. Nothing spectacular.   Would i come back again? Definito!",

As I walked in with a little confusion(Never been there before and didnt realize the venue was so nice) the hostess greeted us graciously and showed us to our party.   The waitress was pretty good.(Except for the fact we had to ask her to refill our bottomless mimosas...every...single...time) She was quick and speedy when we did ask for something so it worked well.   The brunch itself came in rather tiny portions...Next time I will remember to order 2 plates of the same thing. The food was absolutely incredible. SOOOO YUMMY!!! That may have been the best part of the Brunch.   The 2 missing stars are sent to the Head Chef none other than Mister David Lawrence. Reading below and realizing many others have brought in their own \"Cupcake Cakes\" or \"Birthday Cakes\" I found it rather bothersome and completely tacky that as we are about to continue to enjoy our Brunch and celebrate he comes over to our table and tells not just one or two people in our party, but he explains to the 'Entire' table we will all be charged $2.50 each additional saucer plate for the cake, and how that pays for the dishwasher to be able to clean the plates. I would think the $20.00 for the tiny portion of food might be able to cover a little bit of that(#JustSayin)....  All in All, this is a great place with such a cool and collective vibe...I would reccommend coming here to others just because the music was great and the food was tasty.",

The dining room is lovely, and the service is quick and professional (but you don't feel rushed). We shared four delicious starters while we enjoyed cocktails.

Me: \"Donny, look how cute that baby is! Edible!\" Donny: \"Oh, cute . . . .hey is that David Alan Grier holding the baby?\" Minor celeb spotting at 1300...  After all the rave reviews our night out on the town was destined to start at 1300. I made the reservations on opentable and got a call on the 4th just to confirm. nice! parking wasn't bad and the only thing I regret was setting the reservation at 7.30pm and listening to reviews that it it was pretty fancy so you should dress accordingly. It really wasn't; it's totally bus. cas. Sophisticated yet non-pretentious atmosphere, amazing eats, lots of energy, pretty classy crowd and great service.  there was definitely an older crowd on Saturday at 7.30 but everyone was really cool, relaxed and sipping the whole time. our neighbors sitting next to us finishing their bottle of wine were really talkative and told us about all the great dishes they had. With their recommendation we got the Fried Green Tomato Salad. Small portion but yummy starter (goat cheese!). The boy got the fried chicken which was hella good! perfectly spiced and perfectly crisp. I got the Braised Beef and paired it with a Cab. The presentation of all dishes was tops, but my beef, which was still very tender, didn't have the same kick as the chicken. In fact the 2 onion rings i had nearly eclipsed the beef experience all together--best ever!  our server was Annette who I noticed got a crappy review previously. It seems like she's changed her act because she was super friendly and very engaged. She kept coming back to see if things were okay and while she wasn't super talkative, she was very helpful. We finished off the meal, super stuffed and in need of boxes! they have like a coat check system and annette handed us a number to redeem our food on our way out.  With wine tip and all the goodies, you're looking at least a $100 bill for two. We will definitely come again and next time try at Friday night. If me and my girls stop through, we'll go straight to the bar where all the action is!",

I actually had a lot of fun here and the scene and the company were great. \u00a0The restaurant was reasonably packed on a Friday - we sat at a big circular table for 10 in the back near the kitchen and there were a few empty tables, so walk-ins seem like they would be fine. There's a lounge area in the front where they play live music, and it's a shame you can't see it from the dining area in the back. Theme was quirky - they were playing jazz and the decor was glamorous and glitzy, yet the food was all southern comfort. They're most known for their fried chicken and shrimp and grits.  What you should get: 1) Poached farm egg and sauteed chicken livers (4.5 stars - liver was delicious)  2) Baked oysters (4 stars - really flavorful, good spice) 3) mac and cheese - (4 stars - these were the best side of the night!) 4) Fried chicken (3.5 stars - might as well. This was a lot more \"chicken\" and lot less \"fried\" which may be egregious to some. I've had better at Bonchon.) 5) Beef shortrib (3 stars - very tender, but their maple glaze just made the whole thing a little off and a little too sweet) 6) Shrimp and grits (3 stars, didn't see why this was so great. Shrimp was solid, fine. grits were fine.)  Cocktails were average, wine list was pretty good - they have a ton by the glass.   Overall, probably wouldn't come back, especially now that I've had a run of all the top picks, but maybe would for a last minute girls' night out venue or something.",

What ever happened to our god-given utensils called hands I thought. Anyhow, my dish came out, and what the heck, I dug in with a fork and knife. First thought, where's the bone? Second thought, oh-my-god this is good! The chicken captured the essence of any good fried chicken...it was super mouth-burning hot, crisp, tender, juicy, and ultimately lip-smacking good.  Enough with the chicken....the fresh cornbread and jalapeno jelly really typify southern flavors and are a nice substitute for the normal bread and butter. I also very much enjoyed the shrimp n grits and smoked pork belly. Both were explosive and robust in flavors.  The short ribs are a great option if you're not into the $26 fried chicken, but take it from an original non-believer, get the chicken.

    "review_text": "Having been to only Southern inspired places on S.F. my knowledge is limited however my family is from various places in the South so I think it evens out. \u00a0Going here I was prepared to be underwhelmed like I am at most Southern inspired places (Elite Cafe, the overrated Town Hall, the \"Why are they still open\" farmer brown and Blue Jay Cafe, and Front Porch [although that food is more Caribbean than U.S. Southern so they don't get knocked as hard]). \u00a0Knowing that the chef is born and raised in London only helped with my skepticism. \u00a0I went on a Thursday night and was seated immediately. \u00a0I had to wait for my waitress (a manager/host) came by and asked if I'd been waited on yet and I told him, no. \u00a0It was few minutes more before she arrived. \u00a0It was not packed or anything so maybe they're still working out some kinks. \u00a0I had the crabcakes to start. \u00a0I think I tasted a little curry and maybe there was too much seasoning in there but they were okay and of course, came with the typical citrus salad. \u00a0I ordered the fried chicken getting the mac&amp;cheese instead of the truffled potatoes because I must be the only person who does not get the truffle love. \u00a0Anyway, it comes 3 pcs and boneless. \u00a0I put salt on mine because it was pretty bland without it. \u00a0It was crisp, hot and cooked through though. \u00a0It wasn't the best I've had nor the worst. \u00a0Actually Cafe Rex on Polk Street has better chicken and so does Street on Polk on Sundays. \u00a0Front Porch's chicken is coated with flour and cornmeal so if you like that type of crunch and the extra seasoning this might seem bland to you although Front Porch's chicken isn't really Southern style. \u00a0The mac&amp;cheese came in a container that looked as though half of the order was missing. \u00a0It tasted okay, again, I've had worse and better. \u00a0It's not traditional either as bell pepper and bacon are not usually in mac&amp;cheese not to mention that most folks in the South don't really use white sauces to make mac&amp;cheese. \u00a0For dessert I had the beignets. \u00a0Traditionally, the come in a diamond shape. \u00a0They weren't greasy which is good. \u00a0The coffee soda was bizarre as has been mentioned. \u00a0I took a sip and found it cloyingly sweet. \u00a0I dipped a beignet in and it was not only sweet but I was getting the feeling of eating something spoiled. \u00a0All in all, while the space is nice and the bar area seems comfortable I won't be going back. \u00a0The cheapest thing on the menu is the vegi black eyed pea cake for $18. \u00a0Seeing as the now shuttered Powell's was paying 10k per month in rent I don't even want to know what the price must be on this place. \u00a0If you don't want the cuisine served at Yoshi's and don't mind paying the price and want something close by then by all means help yourself. \u00a0For decent New Orleans type food you're probably better off going to Brenda's in the city. \u00a0Bottom line, S.F. still doesn't have a nice authentic Southern eatery and if I need a quick fried chicken fix I'll just go to Popeye's.",

    "review_text": "I made reservation for a Sunday night to take my fiance here for his birthday. My gosh was I blown away by their food, drinks and service! The night we went, it was not very crowded in the beginning. However, more and more people came later. They have specials each day, and the waiter/waitress will announce those items.   We ordered drinks and I had a fancy cocktail while fiance ordered a red wine. If you're into fruity cocktail drinks, then you'll love their cocktail menu. Fortunately for us, the appetizer of the day sounded really good and we ordered that as our starter. It was their charcuterie platter. I do not remember specifically which type of cured meats I ate (one may be duck meat?), but I do remember their pate spread. The combination of the spread, mustards, pickled onions and cured meats melted away in my mouth! It tasted like heaven and above... I'm drooling just thinking about it.  For our main courses, we had their traditional fried chicken (with masked potatoes and small side of mac and cheese), ribs (special of the day) and a side of mac and cheese. One thing I would have done differently would be to skip the mac and cheese if I knew the fried chicken came with a small cup of it already. Either way, the mac and cheese was not disappointing. Firstly, the fried chicken was not greasy at all but still maintained its crunchy outside and the juiciness of the meat on the inside. My fiance loved their mashed potato. Then came the ribs... my my my were they delicious. The ribs came with no sauce on them (but still had flavor) but two small side sauces. I think one of was a sweet barbeque type of sauce while the other was a more mustard type? Either way, I ended up using both sauces on the ribs and the fried chicken! We ate and ate and ate until we were going to get sick. Even though, we had plenty to pack to-go. I wanted fiance to order dessert as it was his birthday but he told me he absolutely cannot eat anymore. I can't force feed him on his birthday and so I heeded to his request.   I think the bill ended up being around $100.00 per person and this is with two drinks each, appetizer, two entrees and a side. I have been to more expensive places and those places did not leave me feeling this way. I will have to come back here in the future and I highly recommend this place for a special occasion or if you feel like splurging!",

Wandered down Fillmore after a beautiful day soaking in the sun and jazz at the festival. Entered through the giant wood door to experience 1300 on Fillmore.   Menu was expansive, and offered choices for anyone. You could pick a few appetizers like the fried green tomato salad with goat cheese. Of course fried. A distinct and tasty dish. Or go for the artery special of their famous fried chicken. Three pieces of OMG. Served up with mashed potatoes to give it that extra should not have eaten that. Rib Eye was my favorite since I ordered it. Big piece of meat, cooked Medium. Excellent over the blue cheese grits.   Now comes the dessert. If you even have an inkling to order something please do so. Banana Cream Pie is king, closely followed by the Beignets with a chocolate and a coffee and soda dipping sauce.",

Sadly, they only play until 11:30 PM every Friday. Luckily were able to see them again at Farmer Brown's on Sunday for brunch.  Service was friendly and attentive. I noted the manager giving extra special service and complimentary food to a table of two just in front of us. Perhaps it was a special occasion.   The food was also delicious. We initially ordered rib-eye burger. It was what drew us in for dinner. However, within minutes we were told that they ran out. This is unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber. We opted for the black skillet roasted catfish instead. It came with andouille sausage and shrimp jambalaya, and cornbread panzanella salad. It was packed with flavor. The complimentary cornbread served with honey butter and jalapeno sauce...OMG! I was in heaven. Serve a sista some hot cornbread and a stiff drink and I'm good.  Thank you 1300 Filmore. Great food, great service and excellent live entertainment. I'll be back!",

Our hostess came to the bar and got my friend and I and showed us to our table. It was a perfect table in a cozy corner of a luxurious couch!  The menus were presented to us... and for the month of February, 1300 is offering a prix fixe menu which included a 4 course meal, including a warm chocolate cake for dessert! Everything was scrumptious, hot cornbread for the table. A Dungeness crab salad for starter, then a little fois gras... followed by delicious beef medallion... rounded out with a yummy and exquisite warm flour-less chocolate cake.

    "review_text": "I just got home from one of the best dining expereince...and it all happend by accident.   My intentions were to go to Yoshi's tonight for some Jazz and sushi. After circling around a couple times and having second thoughts about parking beyond Eddy street, I found the perfect parking spot right on Fillmore. I look up and see this dark lounge on the corner of Fillmore and Eddy. As soon as we got out of the car, I was bragging to my sister that I have good parking karma--we got a sweet spot right in front of Yoshi's.  We walk into this lounge with large wooden doors. The decor is so unique -- upside down lampshades paired with large paintings of the Fillmore past. My sister tells the hostess that we reserved a table for two. She looks down the list twice and doesn't find us. Meanwhile I picked up a business card and was wondering why Yoshi's would ever make their address \"1300 Fillmore\" so prominant. Hmmm....  Guess what??? We stumbled into 1300 on Fillmore by accident. The general manager, Dave, was so awesome about it. He was telling us all about the food and my stomach wouldn't shut up. We thanked Dave and proceeded to Yoshi's half a block down. Halfway into Yoshi's, I didn't want sushi anymore -- I wanted a hot plate of soul food. I wanted the fried chicken, spicy fries, spare ribs, collard greens. I desired the comforts of cornbread, biscuits, and mashed potatoes. I love sushi just not tonight. (Yoshi's, I'll definitely come back to neighborhood and make a special trip to visit you very soon).   We were seated immediately despite the fact that we didn't have reservations. Dave, the general manager, also became our server and was very knowledeable on food culture and the restaurant, and had a great sense of humor which lighten the night. The food was absolutely heavenly.   In the 2 hours I spent at 1300 on Fillmore, I ate food that was like heaven on earth, I learned about the history of Fillmore, I saw our former mayor Willie Brown, and met a local dwellor of the Fillmore neighborhood, Reverend Townsend, who parted some of his wisdom to us. Now that's what you call an awesome dining experience. I guess it's true what they say: Sometimes, the best experiences aren't planned, but come by accident!!!",

I have found my new favorite restaurant and it is amazing...the decor is quaint and romantic (well in the lounge) that's where we sat (I cant judge the main dining room too much)...they had these amazing back lit pictures covering a whole 18 feet \u00a0floor to ceiling wall. They gave the whole room a soft and romantic glow...The ambiance was perfect for me and my \"special someones date\" \u00a0I always pick the restaurants and he has never complained (cause we're just connected like that ;o)...we are both foodies who love to tickle our pallets with new and creative dishes..but we need the whole package...gorgeous decor...not too loud (unless that's what we're going for) and impeccable customer service and BOY WERE WE PLEASED!!  So we sat in the more loungy area...with the beautiful leather chairs (think King and Queen in a castle very Louis the 15th)  For starters we had the fresh water shrimp hush puppies and the BBQ Shrimp in creamy grits and those two apps were amazing...everything was cooked to perfection and the none of the dishes were over seasoned or bland.  For drinks I had the 3 of the jazz berry martinis and he had 3 crown royal,coke,grenadine and lime concoctions...(He created his drink) It was great though..I have to give him that.   On to the main course...I had the pan roasted black sea bass (flaky and cooked to please) and asparagus (sauteed and succulent) and he had the Maple braised beef short ribs (which were so tender they just fell right off the bone and smelled so delicious) with mashed potatoes and onion rings..we also ordered a side of the Mac and cheese and the caramelized \u00a0sweet onion braised greens!! Not a one of our dishes left us disappointed...we both had that good kind of full...you know satisfied not stuffed.  And for dessert we had the banana cream pie, drizzled in Carmel with a flaky crust!!! OMG!!!  Last night was an absolutely fabulous night...I now have a new favorite restaurant tucked away in the culture filled hustle and bustle of the Fillmore district...we made a same day reservation and were seated quickly when we arrived...the hostess was so accommodating and our server was very knowledgeable of all the dishes...our bill came out to be about 200 dollars (that's with tip) but for 2 appetizers...6 cocktails...2 main courses...2 additional sides and dessert in a 5 star restaurant is more then reasonable to me. For me its experience, ambiance and the meal itself...I was more then pleased and I will definitely be back again..very very soon. (Plus there is a parking GARAGE...yep you heard me GARAGE...no looking for while your stomach eats itself going on here...parking less then 60 feet from the restaurant)...Can we say convenient?? This was definitely a night to remember.  PS. And the cornbread with sweet creamy butter and jalapeno jelly that they serve before the meal is mouth watering...anyone that knows me knows that I have a secret weakness for cornbread...well its not a secret anymore I guess ;o)  **If I could give it 10 stars I would...anyone who doubts this establishment or doesnt try it is cheating themselves**",

    "review_text": "From the moment I walked into 1300 on Fillmore, I sensed a disconnect. The elegant room alongside the pleasant but not-overpowering smell of barbecue were almost impossible to reconcile. In the end, I left with the feeling that I liked the room and the servers more than the food - and I really don't like when that happens.  The decor and layout are truly a pleasure - warm browns, old photos, and a very distinct lounging area alongside the bar, separate from the dining room. Fit and finish is very high quality.   My meal was less inspiring. A salad with pears had decent, if mild, flavor, but the pears, while bearing grill marks, were just too hard. I wasn't expecting them to crunch, and they did.  I had the short ribs, and the meat itself was cooked well, toothsome and yielding, but a bit uninspired in flavor. the bed of mashed pototoes underneath lacked salt and was a too-bland foil for the meat.  We shared three desserts, and unfortunately, none were really exciting. Beignets were quite good, though the coffee soda accompaniement was too strong and far too sticky-sweet. Banana cream pie wasn't the classical version you'd expect - no issues with that - but the powerfully ripe banana flavor was not adequately offset by the sweet creaminess of custard. It just didn't work right.  I'd try it again, though probably for drinks and an app in the very cool lounge space. Too many other inspiring places to have dinner.",

    "review_text": "Background: I had heard fabulous things about this restaurant from two foodie friends so I came in with very high expectations.  -----------------------------------------  So much potential -- beautiful decor (including the lounge/bar area), elegant presentation, and innovative idea (for SF) but the food and service leave much to be desired considering the prices.  All the dishes lacked the sort of complexity and elegance you would expect from $9-$11 apps and $25-$30 entrees. For example, the fried chicken had a tasty and unique breading (lots of cumin, so stay away if you're not a fan), but the meat itself was a bit bland. The rabbit came recommended by the server, but the white meat was VERY dry. The lamb chops were perfectly pink on the inside but tasted like a big chunk of meat without the subtleness you would normally taste in a lamb chop. The accompanying lamb sausage however, was awesome.  The shrimp hushpuppies were like the chicken -- really good breading, but the shrimp itself was severely undercooked and the garlic aoli nothing out of the ordinary.  No complaints with the sides: fries w/ homemade ketchup and mac 'n cheese.   The chocolate beignets, like the entrees, were good but not great. Very fried, but not as soft and fluffy as I expected and the chocolate syrup and coffee foam (?) were average.  The service was okay -- the waiter was not very knowledgeable but tried his best.   Bottom line: Underwhelming based on my expectations, but definitely willing to give it another try.",

    "review_text": "We went to 1300 Fillmore with high expectations, after reading the menu. In general, it seems to be a place that would suit specific attributes, but otherwise would not be a place we'd frequent much from the peninsula.  Ambiance: The ambiance here is great. The decor, lighting, music and mood are good for an after work gathering, or large party. They have private and semi-private rooms available as well. Street parking is difficult and can be kind of scary (we were heckled twice while walking to our vehicle), so you may prefer garage parking.  Service: We loved our waiter. He was witty and engaging.  Food: Ah, after reading the menu, we were expecting the best pan fried chicken in the world. While the chicken had a great flavor that seemed like it had been brined or otherwise prepped, the overall combination did not seem to exceed other local offerings like Hard Knox cafe, not to mention the joints we grew up with in the south. However, the mushroom appetizer did exceed our expectations. We also found the ribs to be ok. Not as savory as the sloooow cooked offerings in the south, not as tender as the parbroiled offerings like at Houston's restaurant.  So, if you have a party, event, or want to host an event, or live in the city, consider trying this place out.",

I will say this, the restaurant is beautiful, and definitely fits the \"first date\" vibe.  Here's where it goes all wrong... We had dinner reservations at 8:30pm thinking it'll give us plenty of time to enjoy our dinner before heading next door to Yoshi's to see a concert at 10:30pm. We we're running late, so we got there at 8:45pm. We order almost immediately because we were starving. Tell me why we didn't get our food until 9:50pm? We made it known to our waiter that we were on a time crunch and still he didn't do anything to make sure our orders came out on a timely manner. As a matter of fact, a group of 6 people sitting next to us, who arrived 30 minutes after we got seated, got their food before us! \u00a0We were a party of 3 - I'm confused... I think you know what comes next - we had to inhale our food! \u00a0NO BUENO!  I ordered their burger and a side of mac 'n cheese (what else). At the time I thought it was delicious, but thinking about it now, I'm sure a piece of cardboard would've tasted just as good because I was beyond starved. \u00a0Their mac 'n cheese has a spicy twist to it, so I liked that, but it lacks the cheesy, yummy goodness that I look for. \u00a0All I can say about the burger is that its so-so. \u00a0That's pretty bad if all I can say about a burger is \"so-so\".

Friendly, professional, and attentive staff, amazing cocktails, delicious corn bread, beautiful d\u00e9cor, these were only the betas to an awesome night. \u00a0  I came on a Thursday night. Being that it was a girl's night out, we all know it can call for a lot of high-pitch squeals, roaring laughter, hugs, running around photo-whoring, and inappropriate discussions with inappropriate language usage. Evidently, this can be seen as obnoxious and intrusive behavior to some. Fortunately though, the staff and our neighboring patrons were very accepting throughout the night. Beautiful murals framed their sophisticated lounge area. Fixed with leather arm chairs and welcoming sofas, it has a jazzy, old library appeal to it.   When it came to service, they set the bar. Early in the night, a friend arrived and excitedly came to hug everyone. In the heat of the moment, she knocked over a cocktail, broke the glass, and spilled the drink all over the floor. The staff gently asked us to let them clean it up and even whipped up a new one for my friend. Whoo-hoo to southern hospitality. Courtesy +1. Given that it was DAT week, they were pretty busy, but never did I feel like they were overwhelmed or unorganized. The service was top-notch throughout.   I wouldn't constitute the food as real southern soul food though they offered mac and cheese, grits, and cornbread. A gourmet flair was definitely implemented if not influential to the menu. My grits came with shrimp, the cornbread had a very deep, rich, honey flavor to it and my key-lime pie came as a martini, a very tasty and memorable one though, might I add. The mac and cheese was actual macaroni noodles and had bread crumbs tossed in, but it was just OK for me. My favorite was probably the creamy, savory, shrimp and grits. YUMMAY. My main was a catfish and pilaf or risotto. Major aromas and flavors pockets emanated from the fish and rice. Holy mole, it was soo good. I regretted chowing down on multiple triangles of cornbread right then and there. Even grumpy enjoyed leftovers (he's been a perennial hater of fish, unless it's fried or sushi).   A place with great food and beautiful decor will score a decent review from me, but an entity that aims to go above and beyond deserves the best review I can offer. 5 stars it is! Right next to Yoshis, I have every incentive to return even if it's just to pick up another key-lime martini.",

If anything would probably go back for the happy hour.",

Came here on a Friday evening and absolutely loved the ambiance. The setting was ever so intimate and I loved the dim lighting. I opted for the pan roasted black sea bass and immediately fell in love. Yes, SF was my kind of city. You see, I get a little superstitious about new restaurants, new cities, new homes. My first dining experience has to be impeccable in any new city I move to, and if that happens, it's a sign that I would have a great time during my tenure there. And 1300 on Fillmore was definitely impeccable. For dessert, we shared the warm chocolate beignets. Melt-in-your mouth happiness. That's all I have to say...  And in case you were wondering, no, I didn't stick my finger down my throat after the meal. LA's skinny inhabitants can kiss my big fat ass. City of San Francisco - I am here to stay!",

The champagne beverages were a little \"meh.\" We got there right when brunch opened and they're already out of peach puree for my bellini. The pom mimosa was also a little \"meh\" tasting. But other than that, the food was divine, and the Gospel Brunch was AMAZING! Get your lungs ready and be prepared to sing! Grits were super yum (minus that weird stuff decorated on top... I couldn't figure out what it was - like candied something or other?). Fried catfish BLT (minus the B) was super yum! That bread was perfection. Fried chicken was also yum!

We had the spiced fat fries (was not expecting cinnamon to be part of the \"spiced\" in \"spiced fat fries\") and the shrimp hush puppies. \u00a0Both hit the spot, but were not really \"outstanding\". Which seems to be what they are going for.   We know this is a fact since we were asked every two minutes \"how is everything, aren't they FABULOUS (well...actually no), \"Hello, I'm the owner.....\".  Not sure who the heck they though we were, but they were laying it on thick. In a very uncomfortable way.   The place is nice, it would have been a much better experience if they backed off a bit.",

I decided to have my birthday dinner here with friends and had a fantastic meal. The fish I had was cooked just right and my friends ALL enjoyed their meals. I had the salmon prix fixe option on the menu which I highly recommend.  What shocked me was how empty the place was on a Saturday night. I know we're in a recession, but as far as nice restaurants in San Francisco are concerned, 1300 On Fillmore is relatively affordable. The light traffic somewhat killed the ambiance and made me sacrifice a star. Still love the spot and would suggest the place to anyone curious about it.",

Between glasses of gin &amp; tonics, I noshed on some pretty delicious bites. The shrimp hushpuppies are truly exceptional. Fresh, plump, and succluent shrimp encased within a moist hushpuppy. Delicious and super convinient to eat. The fried chicken sticks with \u00a0the blue cheese dip were also really enjoyable. I mean what's not to love about fried chicken, and a crispy-fried-but-moist-on-the-inside one at that. Plus it's on a stick so again really easy to eat as you engage in conversation. The braised beef short rib sliders and fries are pretty decent and yummy too.   1300 on Fillmore is a sophisticated but comfortable space with attentive and friendly service. I'lll have to come back for dinner some time but I definitely reconmend the lounge for happy hour in the area.",

Everything we ordered was very very good; however, when our \"sweet bread\" came, it was nothing like what I expected. Our waitress tried to tell us that it's a little misleading with the name and all but we decided to order it anyways (we couldn't really hear her over the loud music and the busy crowd), but it ended up being the glands from a calf! Needless to say, I did not have any =(  All in all, the food was very tasty but the ambiance and the decoration is what really sold this place for me.   hint: When you get a doggy bag, they give you a little tag for it and so before you leave you show it to the maitre de and they get it for you.

At the end of our dinner we asked the server if he had told the manager what happened, he said \"yes\" and then the manager came over. He was rude and not empathetic to the situation.

He said that we should have told him before the end of our dinner , we reminded him that we had told our server right away. He said, well we are really busy in here.

The venue is stylish, bi-level and becomes lively as it fills with a crowd from everywhere. \u00a0  Notice that \u00a0all of the patrons sitting on a sofa along the wall are a few inches shorter than their mates who are on chairs opposite. \u00a0The sofa is a few inches too low. \u00a0 Ask to not be seated at a sofa-table lest the food get thrust towards you.  I start with barbecue shrimp and creamy grits. \u00a0No grits expert here. \u00a0But they are creamy and satisfying, the shrimp just cooked through and tasty. \u00a0Some crunch is provided by almond slivers dispersed here and there. \u00a0Some bite comes from a taste of pepper that slowly becomes apparent as I work my way through the food. \u00a0Nice, tasty. \u00a0  Pan roasted black bass is served over salsify, artichokes and shrimp nage. \u00a0The skin of the bass is crisped, the flesh beneath moist, tender, tasty, perfect. \u00a0The salsify taste like a cross of carrot and baby turnips, as advertised. \u00a0 The artichoke are OK, the shrimp nage (broth) adds nothing to the plate. \u00a0But really, this is all about the bass, and rightly so. \u00a0  Dessert is a circular 3 inch mound of banana cream pie. \u00a0It's freshly made, filled with chunks of banana and not too sweet. \u00a0It is sided by an astringent caramel-lime sauce that bites back at the somewhat sweet pie. \u00a0Lovely way to end a meal.  This place serves up-dated, stylish, lightened plates of southern-inspired food. \u00a0A really nice addition to the San Francisco restaurant scene.",

Try the fried chicken it's amazing! And their fried green tomatoes, BBQ shrimp, mmmm. They had a wonderful pumpkin bisque in the fall last year as well that was simply to die for. The food is southern style so be prepared for a heavy meal but you will leave happy!  In addition, they have a cool little lounge area if you just want to hang out at the bar - and they also serve their full menu there I believe.

We perused the menu, and they had a pretty ecclectic menu \"southern\" menu. \u00a0We asked our waiter what would he recommend as a starter he recommended the \"grits and shrimp\". Than we proceeded to order like the heirloom tomatoes, and I ordered the pork belly. The grits and shrimp were great, the tomato dish had what looked like \"bottled french dressing\" (mayonnaise and catchup) and it tasted like that. The pork belly was mushy, including the skin, I mentioned to the waiter the skin could've been crisped to give it some textural contrast. The entre\u00e9s weren't that exciting, the ribs still had their \"silver skin\"on it, the cod had the same \"french\"dressing the tomatoes sat on. The vegetarian entr\u00e9e looked and tasted like mush and the macaroni and cheese with truffle oil was just bland, bland, bland. \u00a0However, the dessert were hits and misses. The chocolate dessert combo was good, the banana cream pie was boring. \u00a0Normally I would have rated this 2-stars, but because the grits/shrimp was really good, cocktails were really good, and the service great, I bumped it up a star.

I was pretty excited walking up to the place and thinking of what I was going to order, as I checked out the menu the minute my girlfriends and I decided to go to 1300 for our annual holiday dinner. Fried Chicken or Braised Beef, Fried Chicken or Braised Beef, I repeatedly asked myself from where we parked in the free Safeway Parking Lot to the big heavy door that opened to a wonderful dimly lite restaurant, and was filled w/the sound of a saxophone playing some great jazz beats. When you walk in to await the hostess, you look to your left and there is a nice sized bar area w/some seating to lounge, sip some specialty cocktails and listen to the live band play. We were greeted, met the rest of our party and was escorted straight ahead to the dinning room and seated at a roomy circular table w/plenty of elbow room. No booths here (from what I seen), just round tables for smaller parties in the middle of the room with longer tables bordering the dinning room for larger parties.   We began to gaze through the drink menu, and for one of my girlfriends and I we targeted the Feisty Blood Orange - Absolute Mandarin Orange, Oranges, Cranberry Juice and Sliced jalape\u00f1o. This was delicious, not too sweet with a touch of heat, however it may be an acquired taste and a bit weird tasting if you're not into that kind of stuff.   Out came the complimentary cornbread accompanied w/honey butter in one dish and a strawberry jalape\u00f1o jam in another. Very different, which is why it may have been very good. The cornbread itself was good, not to gritty w/the right amount of crumble. Topped w/a spread of honey butter and a dollop of the strawberry jalape\u00f1o jam, it went from good to great. Some of our party decided to order the oysters to share, which I didn't try the oyster itself, but did taste test the mignonette which was nice, the meal was off to a great start.   Fried Chicken or Braised Beef, I debated one last time and decided to go w/the............ MAPLE SYRUP BRAIED BEEF SHORT RIB w/Chive Mashed Potatoes and Onion Rings. The worse culinary decision I have made, this dish didn't have as much flavor as the description made it seem to have. The meat itself was fall off the bone with the right amount of fatty goodness, onions rings were crunchy and not oily, mashed potatoes were, well mashed potatoes, but the flavor of the beef was not what I was expecting. I thought it would be more packed w/flavor with a touch of sweetness, however found it somewhat bland, and the other 2 that ordered thought the same. One of my girlfriends ordered the Fried Chicken and was kind enough to share and let us try. WOW!!! It was juicy, flavorful and crispy w/out all the batter. I think I will give it another try, but will opt for the Fried Chicken.",

    "review_text": "Hey, hey, hey....have lately been voyaging into the....um...Fillmore Jazz District. \u00a0I find this to be a funny sorta strip....basically, the Redevelopment agency plowed-under a vibrant and diverse n'hood in the '60's and '70's to cure urban blight....and replaced it with concrete hi-rises and soulless storefronts. \u00a0Retail tenants of the old 'hood were given vouchers and promsed they could have their merchant spaces reclaimed in the new development....but, gosh...when the time came...that never happened !!! \u00a0Guess what....that whole bit of urban renewal...failed ! (Surprise).  So now we get the second version, new-millenium style. \u00a0This time around, we have concrete and stucco mid-rises in multi-colors with...um....soulless storefronts...PLUS...brick sidewalks which tell us what funky, cool ol' establishments USED to be in biz when the Fillmore was the Fillmore.  With that, however, came (at least) some potential magnets to draw nitelife back across the great divide known as Geary Blvd. \u00a0Talkin' Yoshi's and 1300 as the major players, along w/ the likes of Sheba's and Rassellas (which was originally intended to be the major jazz player).  Not a bad idea, not a bad idea...although, as my taxi driver once said upon pullling-up to the just opened Yoshi's - \"oh, goody, another expensive place for white people to come see jazz\".  hehehe...had to give him a big tip for that chestnut....  Now, this entire entry is not one big digression...it's really not.  1300....I really hope that this place makes it. \u00a0I have been there 3x thus far...once for drinks, once for drinks and snacks, and once for din-din.  The food is very good. \u00a0We had the char (which as mentioned in other reviews, doesn't seem to come with the specified lobster anywhere to be seen) which was still pretty good...and then the killer item in my book was the barbequed shrimp with grits...dang, slay me ! \u00a0Their fries w/ homemade ketchup also really kick, as does their cornbread. Also, the head chef makes rounds of the tables and bar area and is a very engaging Jamaican/British fellow....David Lawrence. \u00a0I like that...he seemed genuinely interested to converse and see how his establishment was being received. \u00a0On the other hand....his managerial assistant was a rather stern woman who walked around doing the same thing...although on all 3 occassions she glanced at our table and bypassed it. \u00a0Hmmm...not that I take such things personally....this was OK with me, since if I found David to be affable...my impression of her was that, well....she seems the kind of lass who would smile at you sweetly, grab you by the jugular, and then not let go until you stopped twitching....so, probably all the better for both of us.  I like the bar lounge area better than the dining area...it's cozier...the dining area seems too much of been-there-done-that fancy-schmancy-california-cuisiney-interior-vibe stuff. \u00a0It's pleasant enuff...just not very unique or comfortable (albeit an improvement over Yoshi's 'is there any way we can seat you in a colder environment ?\" Japanese chic). \u00a0Also, the lounge area has this amazing photo of the old Fillmore (ironically, of a particular block which no longer exists....the surface street between Post and O'Farrell - now an overpass). Urban designers would have done well to take notice of the photos such as this....because they could have very much informed what sort of NEW storefronts SHOULD have been erected along Fillmore...instead of what WAS)...  Oops...digression again....anyways...  Good food, friendly service (forgetting the aforementioned, um, sprite), nice atmosphere...and a great, great, great mix of clientele. Matter of fact, the crowd may be what I like best about this place...there's a lotta fun people-watching to be had here....  Bad points: \u00a0troppo caro !!!! \u00a0$$$$$$$ !!!! \u00a0Aye, aye. \u00a0On one visit, we split an entree, 2 appetizers, and 3 glasses of vino...and the bill was $85 !!!!!  ouch....For $85, I like at least feeling relatively full when I leave. \u00a0I shudder to think what it would'a run if we had ordered separate entrees.  Drinks were a bit pricey too. \u00a0They should drop their prices a bit....because although the style of the food may warrant such...the portion sizes do not.....so don't come here particularly hungry.  Also, the waitstaff doesn't quite have it together yet...but I don't mind that, since they were all pretty nice. \u00a0Although, I must agree with other reviews...for a place trying to be of this calibre....they better get their hosting situation all shook-out....'cuz on two visits, there was a major backlog of hungry folk at the hosts station apparently w/ reservations who weren't gettin' seated anytime fast....  Now that the strip has it's expensive magnet places, it needs some more down-home cheap places (that are NOT chain-stores)....a dive bar or two, a souvlaki stand run by some grumpy old guy, a fried catfish place....then the Fillmore'd really be in bizness.....",

I grew up in the South, so I have some pretty high standards and I love this place. \u00a0It's down home food done for foodies, so everything has a little bit of a foodie-edge to it. \u00a0My favorites:  - Little gem salad with pecans and green goddess dressing - Mushroom grits (or any of their grits for that matter) - creamy and delicious...brought my fiance around to grits in general (he's from the NE so he claimed not to \"do grits\") - for those of you lucky enough to live in the Fillmore, they sometimes have a stand at the Farmers Market that's three different versions of grits...a little bit of heaven. - Short ribs - melt in your mouth deliciousness with mashed potatoes and greens - Fried chicken - deboned, with a little kick in the flouring of it...totally worth the 20 minute wait - Whatever they are doing with in-season fruit - whether it's the peach cobbler, apple bread pudding or pretty much anything else, it's all amazing  My fiance loves the warm egg salad with cabbage, the mac and cheese, greens, and the brunch with Tasso ham.  Service is great and always friendly. \u00a0Cocktails are fun. \u00a0Great for dinner with the fiance, with the girls or with family.  Go now. \u00a0Seriously.",

Very dark and clubby with the glow of backlit posters of jazz legends and archival photos of the Fillmore from back in the day. Wonderful chairs and couches for lounging. Cool lanterns.   Food: Ranging from good to great. We ate off the lounge menu, although you can have regular food in the lounge. Had the barbecue shrimp cheezy grits which were awesome. Fat fries - delicious. Lamb sliders - pretty good. Warm chocolate beignets - OUTTA THIS WORLD. Served with a dipping sauce and coffee soda. What? Shut up. Only criticism is the food tends to be on the sweet side, including the house made ketchup. They need to even it out a bit. I almost got the diabetus.  Drinks: They have signature cocktails, which I didn't have. I had this very well-priced rose that was on the money. Gotta say tho that this is the place to drink a manhattan.  Service: Great.

To start one of the hostesses clearly hadn't been trained \u00a0in the art of delivering superior customer service, as she had 4 out of a party of 6 waiting for nearly 15 mins while our table remained empty because our full party wasn't present to be seated! \u00a0My apologizes because our husbands were parking the car!! \u00a0Nor was our waiter trained \u00a0in superior customer service!! \u00a0Once our party of 6 was seated at a table set for 5!!!!??? Only then did our waiter who walked past us for 20 mins without saying a word or introducing himself finally take our order!! Our party waited nearly 30 mins for our food to arrive only to be told.....oopps we ran out of food!!!! \u00a0 Apparently the kitchen staff hadn't prepared for the number of patrons who ordered the southern ribs????Therefore my husband wasn't able to eat the ribs he ordered for dinner!!!!! REALLY????!!!!! \u00a0Somehow the chef was able to round up a few ribs and provided my husband with his meal nearly an hour after he ordered his meal! And 15 mins before we had to leave for a 10PM show at Yoshis. \u00a0Of course we expressed our dissatisfaction and we comped for our champagne, side dishes, and the meal my  husband received late. \u00a0  Overall we paid less than half for a dining experience that would have cost over $400. The general manager who comped us and tried to help and apologize for our awful experience did the best he could. However, at the end of the day 1300 on Fillmore has poor management at the head which is ultimately is demonstrated by the poorly trained front line service team! Never once did our waiter apologize for our poor experience at 1300 on Fillmore. \u00a0Had we received better service we could have easily spent over $600+. I will never go back to this place!!!",

As we looked down the row, we saw that only the ladies sat there so we chuckled to ourselves. Loved the drapery, the trees, the bar and lounge areas. Everything was just beautiful.  Service: A+. We were seated right away (reservations) and had a pleasant server with the thickest eyeglasses I'd ever seen. THEY WERE SO COOL! LOVED his glasses. LOL! Can't remember his name but he was very nice.  Food: A+.  Pork chop, asparagus and stone fruit = I'm not a huge pork eater but this was so tasty. Seasoned to perfection. The asparagus had this glaze on it that was out of this world. Fried green tomatoes: I've always wanted to try this anywhere so here was my opportunity and it did not disappoint. Lightly breaded and fried tomatoes, not greasy with fresh mozzarella and a yummy sauce underneath. Cornbread w/sweet chili sauce: get your EVERLASTING life with this cornbread honey! YAZ! You could smell and taste the butter and it was so good! BBQ shrimp &amp; grits: the BEST I've ever had. You could taste the flavor in your mouth before you chewed it.  Greens: delicious. Cooked to perfection. Seasoned well. My husband said they were a close 2nd to mine. =D Skillet fried chicken, mashed potatoes &amp; gravy, and chive &amp; herb biscuits: MOUTHGASM.

It has been crossed off the list and it probably won't make it's way back onto my list, although if you have been wanting to come here I would not deter you from doing so.  I have to say that the interior is great and the ambiance of both the lounge and dining areas are fantastic. The server we had was in his first week of work but did a really good job. The food was pretty good but did not live up to the expectations we had built up due to the restaurant's reputation. The night manager that Friday needs to go through some additional training or be replaced.  They told us that they were famous for their Shrimp N' Grits so we ordered that along with the Pork Belly &amp; Egg to start. The shrimp n' grits were very good but the pork belly, while it had a lot of flavor, was just too sweet with the bbq sauce.  For the entree we had the Fried Chicken. It was pretty good and I can't really complain about the dish, but it was not extremely memorable. I have heard about their fried chicken being fantastic, but I can honestly say that I have had better in SF alone for a lower price. (Search: The Front Porch). On the side we ordered their Mac and Cheese, which was the best thing of the night.  Overall, the meal was better than average but not fantastic. The biggest downside actually came from the manager that night. He decided not to honor our Blackboard Eats 30% discount because he thought we did not meet the minimum order of 2 small plates per person or 1 entree per person. As you can see by what we ordered we did meet the requirements, as well as having an extra side and 4 of their $12 cocktails. He decided to argue with me right in the dining room and I was the one who had to say \"maybe we should continue this discussion somewhere else\". When all was settled he said that it was his mistake because \"the ticket only showed one small plate and a side, and that he didn't see the second small plate on our bill\". He gave us a free dessert for the embarrassment but the whole incident really left a sour taste in our mouths when we left.",

    "review_text": "I went here over a month ago with a group of 8. \u00a0I still drool dreaming about the food. \u00a0Really, I don't think I've been to a restaurant in SF where so much of the food is so consistently strong and delicious.  The best I've ever had: Cornbread (with simple jam and butter) Fried Chicken (how is this so good? i don't understand)  Really solid: Service: the waitress &amp; waiter were great, attentive and made a great wine recommendation  Decor: love the atmosphere. wish there was live jazz that night though Short ribs with truffle mashed potato and vegetables sauteed mushrooms with grits (I didn't even normally like grits) mac and cheese  side dies of braised greens (this was surprisingly spicy)  Average  biscuit- yea, amazing that I thought this was the only food I had there that I didn't think was outstanding.  My only knock against the place is we made a reservation for 7 but had 8 show up, they said their extra chair was \"broken\" and then we ended up waiting for over an hour and half. \u00a0At first they made a small attempt at making things right by saying \"they'd care of us for making us wait\". \u00a0At first, this meant 1 free small appetizer. \u00a0Upon asking nicely though, they took some side dishes and dessert off the bill.  To end on a good note, I like how I one of the owners was working the hostess table, networking and meeting future regulars and esp. how I saw that the exec. chef was actually still working there, managing the outgoing meals. \u00a0I rarely see the exec. chef at a restaurant so was impressed that he'd still be working there on a normal fri. night.",

He turned out to be nice, but strange manners when we first sat at the bar. The food was okay. The best was the mushroom appetizer. That was really good, but I came here for the chicken which everyone seemed to rave about here. I am a fried chicken fanatic and I did not appreciate their take on fried chicken. It was spiced up (not spicy), but heavy on the spices. My husband liked it, but it says something when I just eat one piece. My husband had the short ribs, which was very fork tender, but it wasn't something that memorable. My girlfriend ordered the burger medium-rare and it came out mooing. \u00a0The service was good though, after remarking about the rareness, she did get a free dessert. 2 stars for food, 4 stars for service",

Here's the run-down:  PARKING: This is the only drawback to anything in the fillmore. Parking is on the street, valet is available but pricey. We spent 20 minutes looking for parking and found it about 2 blocks away.   FOOD: Having lived in Louisiana for four years and having both sides of my family deeply rooted in the south....I am SUPER SERIOUS about my soul food. 1300 DELIVERS! My fiance and I both ordered the BBQ shrimp and grits. The dish was very flavorful and good to the last drop. We also had the greens which were also delightfully flavored and tasty.  DRINKS: I ordered the Tea something or another (alcoholic) and loved the flavor! I hate when I order a girlie cocktail and can only taste alcohol. If I wanted a shot...I would order one. My fiance had a Key Lime Pie drink which he enjoyed so much he ordered another right before leaving.  SERVICE: Our waitress (Chloe) was delightful and attentive. I always like it when your server knows when to make a joke and suggest a menu item with perfect timing. We made reservations for 8pm and were seated right away.   AMBIANCE: Low lighting, dark wood paneling, and plenty of pictures from old fillmore jazz personalities make this a beautiful romantic place to go for date night or happy hour with friends. If it's good enough for DA MAYOR (Willie Brown was seated at the table adjacent to ours) it's good enough for me.  Why not five stars? Difficult parking and a waiter (not Chloe) forgetting to pack up our shrimp and grit leftovers left us slightly disappointed. WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK SOON!",

The restaurant is located on Eddy and Fillmore in the heart of the Western Addition which, if you've never been, isn't the best neighborhood.  I should be smacked in the face for being so judgmental because I absolutely adored this place. Everything was great: service, food, the live jazz music, the comfy seating...I could go on.  I ordered the short ribs with a side of brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts were a tad on the greasy side and I felt, had more onions than sprouts, but were satisfying nonetheless. The short ribs were amazing with the meat falling of the bone at a mere poke of the fork.  For dessert we had the sweet potato souffle. While I really appreciated it for what it was and I'm glad I can say I've tried it, I more than likely wouldn't order this again. For me at least, sweet potato isn't something I crave over and over again :)",

The concept of Mushroom and Grits is unconventional and had white truffle oil surrounding the dish which made it sooo yummy. This was my favorite dish of the night. The fried chicken dish served huge portions. It could be shared with two. The mashed potatoes lacked flavor but the skin of the chicken was my favorite part! Lastly, the bread pudding was wonderful!

I figured me and my bestie, and younger sis could give it a try before the 8 pm Mint Condition show next door. We did not make reservations as we were all unsure of our arrival time. We came in through the large wooden doors and were happy to find the environment warm, dark, and sexy. A large party of twenty-somethings walked in just prior to us and were trying to decide whether or not to dine in the lounge or the actual restaurant. Since there was a wait they chose the lounge as did we, and we all made our way to the candlelit lounge with its large comfy chairs, and small tables. As soon as we sat down, our hostess, a very friendly young woman came over to ask if we wanted any drinks. This is where the party began ladies and gentleman as the specialty cocktail menu is a mouthwatering selection of libations! My bestie and I got the French 75, while my sister went with the waitresses suggestion of Honey Sweet Ice Tea. The cocktails were delicious and potent, which some of you know is hard to achieve. We ordered from the lounge menu, as we were running behind for our show BUT we when our waitress heard our concerns she assured us that she could get our in and out on time. We kept our order for the Baked Oysters, Sauteed Wild Mushrooms &amp; Grits, Fat Fries, and Black Skillet Fried Chicken Strips and ordered another round. After some thought about it, and reminiscing on my bestie's Dad's fried chicken we ordered the entree of Black Skillet Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes and pan gravy as well. Let me just say, I don't run around giving undeserved props for food. Now that we've established that, let me tell you that this place was awesome!!! Five stars for the food which I have now dubbed southern, sophisticated soul! Five stars for the waitress who never missed a beat, kept the drinks coming, and her overall professional AND friendly demeanor. And five stars for ambiance from the decor, to the dim lighting. The chef even made the rounds at one point in the evening and said hello to some of us dining.",

It was always on my list of SF restaurants with great ambiance and \u00a0good hearty food. Up until last night - \u00a0which made me create Yelp account and write my first review.  Managers, owners, please read and react!  The great, one of a kind restaurant of Southern cuisine in SF is about to go bottom up. Not in the near future, since it's still quite packed, but in the foreseeable one, due to the absolute lack ability of maintaining a respectable service. Again, I'm referring not to just one occurrence, but to a chain of events.  First of all - hold time, to be seated - if you were told that your table will be ready in 10-15 min, don't expect it earlier then 45. Last night during our half hour wait, a suggestion from the host came up: \" since your table was given to the other party with reservation, go ahead and start ordering some appetizers from the bar\". I understand that bartenders are usually expected to pour drinks and not necessarily be familiar with the rest of the restaurant's servings, but wouldn't you expect him to take your order of 3 starters for 3 people even if it was asked to be dairy free (since one of us is allergic to it)? Do you want to know the response? - \"Not possible, everything is already mixed-in; moreover, 90 % of our menu contain dairy, so you won't be able to eat here\". Ha!! 40 min into our wait and we are out on the street again, looking for a place to dine.  Too bad I'm not going to have their wonderful cornbread with chili-cranberry compote anytime soon, along with \u00a0other great stuff on their often changing menu. I would only go to 1300 again if I am not hungry in the first place, without any plans for at least upcoming 2,5 hours and NO expectations whatsoever.",

A little over half way through my dinner I couldn't tell if the dish was starting to get too heavy for me or if i was just getting full. I think it was a combination of both but it really didn't matter because I cleaned my whole plate.   I tried a piece of my girlfriend's braised short rib and was glad that I did. It was tender, tasty, juicy... everything a braised short rib should be.  Service was excellent. The hostess greeted us with a warm smile and even suggested that we eat in the lounge area since we were the last reservation and the lounge was empty. The lounge was warm and full of character with lit-up pictures all over the wall. We accepted her offer and had the whole lounge to ourselves which was really cool. However, what wasn't cool was trying to eat dinner off of a tiny table sitting on a couch... felt like bumming it at home on the couch with a bowl of instant ramen watching TV. We really didn't think that one through. Oh well, we know better for next time. \u00a0  The food and service was great and I think we'll be back for more.",

You take it around the corner where they can't see you.  You order the Maple Syrup Slow Braised Beef Short Ribs. Your date will look across the table longingly at your ribs. Do not let her eat them. They are rightfully yours, and they are tasty. She will ask you how they are expecting for you to offer the goods. Don't make eye contact. You made eye contact, didn't you? Ok, give her a little.  She'll have ordered the Southern Exposed Black Skillet Fried Organic Chicken. You'll revel in the number of adjectives while staring at the truffled mashed potatoes. Ok, now's a good time to trade some of your ribs for the mashers.  Then for dessert you'll split the chocolate beignets or the sweet potato souffl. At this point you'll have forgotten to pay your bill, and you'll have a bottle of campari in your hand as you head out singing an ella fitzgerald song in your falsetto that only you and your shower have heard before.",

I probably wouldn't come back because prices aren't worth the quality in taste of food. Not to mention, they had charged my credit card double of what was on the receipt.

We got to the restaurant a little before our reservation and were greeted by the hostess and encouraged to wait in their small front lounge. \u00a0The space is beautiful and we all order drinks (I got a beer, nothing wrong there, Mom got a martini, and the boy got wine). \u00a0After we were seated, our super friendly waiter took our order (for the appetizer, I got the shrimp and grits, Mom got the fried quail salad, and the boy got the squash soup, for the main, we all got the turkey platter, and for dessert, we got two of the pumpkin samplers and one of the chocolate pana cotta). We also got a bottle of wine (which was cheaper than doing the wine pairing).  The food came quick and WOW was it good. \u00a0The meal started with a complimentary order of housemade corn bread with jalapeno relish. \u00a0It was delish. \u00a0The shrimp and grits were perfect - creamy grits and spicy shrimp. SO tasty. \u00a0The quail salad was delicious and the soup was good - not too sweet. \u00a0The turkey platter came with a little bit of mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts, cranberries, cornbread stuffing, and white and dark meat turkey. All were delicious. Seriously. \u00a0The desserts were also amazing. My chocolate pana cotta just melted in my mouth, it was so smooth and so sweet. Wow. \u00a0The pumpkin platter was cool - candied pumpkin seeds, pumpkin ice cream, pumpkin tartlet, cookie, and truffle, cranberry sorbet and candied cranberries. \u00a0Just a little of everything, but it was all really good.  By the time we wandered out, we were stuffed. \u00a0Yeah, it was kind of expensive, but for this southern boy missing home, it was a great way to spend Thanksgiving.",

    "review_text": "I've been here several times. Service has always been courteous to ask if we were going to a show next door at Yoshi's or to a movie at Kabuki after, and help us adjust our menu choices to match what the kitchen could produce within that timeframe. Their appetizers are also usually good enough where I usually order several instead of committing to an entree.   Located literally at #1300 on Fillmore, the really dark wooden and leather paneling creates a cozy and luxe interior. Like a cigar bar without the smoke clinging to all the furniture. Real votives instead of the flickering electronic ones, cute that they use dry lentils as a base in the votiveholder instead of rocks.  We decided to come here recently to celebrate a friend's birthday. Originally a party of 12, we quickly blossomed to a roaring group of 20 on the actual night. Considering that the dining floor and bar area were not well built to take on this large a crowd, 1300 managed to perform beautifully.   We were crammed shoulder-to-shoulder at their special large table, there were partitions to separate us from the rest of the dining floor but the noise level still made it hard to hold conversation with anyone farther than my immediate neighbor. At one point we all started randomly switching seats to talk to one person or other and try to keep our noise level down. It made it confusing to the servers, but they accomodated us as best they could.  Note: Before they all come find me and kill me, this does not mean I'm recommending you to make this the perfect spot to crash when you have this large a party. This was a rather unusual situation that I doubt they'd want to handle everyday.  As if our group wasn't complicated enough, everyone wanted to order their own appetizer. To synchronize serving that many people not once, but twice (again for the entree course) was no easy feat. I think even the manager was involved, lending in a hand to service this oversized mess of a group.  The food has always been enjoyable. Upstyle lighter versions of southern comfort fare, I love almost every appetizer on this menu. From their buttery wild mushrooms atop creamy marscapone hominy grits, soft sweet potato gnocchi, interesting fresh water shrimp hushpuppies, to their little biscuits with butter and homemade chili jam. The warm poached egg salad was really messy to look at but my friend loved it. People were ultimately passing little bitefuls all over the table.  As for the entrees, luckily for the kitchen, the majority of us ordered either the fried chicken, maple-syrup braised shortribs, or pan-roasted snapper with apple cider form and apple bacon brussel sprouts. One lady ordered a lone hamburger that came several minutes after all of ours were served. \"Oohs\" and \"aahs\" echoed around the room as the dishes were put in front of them. Various people were quickly whipping out their camera phones to take a shot.   Although everyone was staring at the food, I caught a glance up at the server. When the girls clapped their hands together and exclaimed how beautiful the dish looked, the way his eyes lit up and a huge happy beaming smile appeared on his face said it all. These are people here who love the experience they create, a passion for the food that they make, and it's reflected in their work. The entrees were yummy and everyone was happy (although I could've gone without the foam on the fish). \u00a0  Thank you as always for a delightful food experience.",

Eat a ton, make your stomach feel like it's going to explode, and your wallet won't be too hurt in the process.  I found 1300 on Fillmore by Yelping \"truffled mac n cheese\", so it was the only thing running through my mind when I was asked, \"What would you like to drink today?\" \"Truffled mac n cheese, please!\" They wouldn't let me drink their truffled mac n cheese, so I got a pomegranate margarita. I'm crazy about sugared/salted rims, so it made me a little excited. I also had a sip of the Manhattan, which was of course, blegh (only someone as stupid as me would order it two days after realizing that it was terrible). As someone once told me, \"That shit will make you grow a mustache.\" Touche.  For the appetizer, we had the quail. It was fried to a crispy goodness, complimented with a stupid (healthy) salad with bacon bits. The corn bread was sooo yummy! It was moist and fresh and warm. Mmm! It was served with butter and red sauce, but was perfectly fine by itself. My scallops were soft and came with a sauce that tasted perfect with my mashed potatoes. I couldn't get enough of the mashed potatoes! Truffled mac and cheese was not as expected, but still great. The truffleness still came out subtly, but I wished it was a little more cheesy.  Dessert was very meh. We had the Kentucky bourbon cake (to my mistake, which I chose) and the chocolate beignets. Nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about.  The ambiance was pretty good. It wasn't too loud, and the lighting was really dim (my kind of place!). In retrospect, I'm not sure I'll be back. This crowd is a little too homogeneous for me... There were only a small amount of people who didn't fit in.. And they had their own private dining room with glass windows and curtains. A bit discomforting for my taste.  Despite that, I'd still give 1300 4 stars!",

    "review_text": "I had an enjoyable evening at 1300 on Fillmore. \u00a0The ambiance is lush and a little formal, and I thought it was a nice change from the typical SF eclectic restaurant style. \u00a0We sat in the dining room, which is very quiet even with several tables filled, and the lounge looked comfortable with the same dark, lush look. \u00a0The waitstaff were great, made us feel taken care of. \u00a0The wine list (by the glass) seemed to be priced about right, and for my level of wine-drinker, I was very satisfied. \u00a0All California wines so far as I could tell, and the two we ordered turned out to be good selections. \u00a0  The food had its high points, but was inconsistent. \u00a0I will say that the pork belly starter was lovely, perfectly cooked fried duck egg with butter beans and a good sized portion of pork belly. \u00a0They let the flavors speak for themselves in this dish and it's perfect, kind of rich and primitive tasting. \u00a0Freshwater shrimp hush-puppies were also good, fried pefectly in a light batter and paired with a tasty sauce that could have had a little more kick for my palate. \u00a0The cornbread was excellent, served with the awesomest jalapeno catsup. \u00a0I wouldn't mind some catsup to take home. \u00a0  Things went downhill somewhat with the main course. \u00a0The boneless fried chicken half was too salty for me, particularly the thigh. \u00a0The breast was more tolerable and would have been very good except for the saltiness. \u00a0It came with mashed potatoes that could have used something, some garlic or mustard or something. \u00a0The portion was enormous. \u00a0Two of us couldn't finish it. \u00a0I was basically stuffed, but I always feel so cheated if I don't order dessert, so I went for the chocolate filled beignets with chocolate sauce and some kind of coffee flavored sauce that was almost like a pudding, I forget now what they called it. \u00a0The coffee stuff was weird and not in a way that made you want to eat more. \u00a0The chocolate sauce lacked richness for me. \u00a0The beignet was kind of overly solid and lacked lightness. \u00a0A definite disappointment. \u00a0   Although it was a nice night, I'll probably be shopping around a bit the next time I want to get some high-end soul food. \u00a0For this town, the food, although there were highlights, just wasn't quite good enough considering the prices at this spot. \u00a0We had the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsavored.com&amp;s=4cbe40e0bc2355678afe4bcf67744319baaf200fe173e4098f8caaf14ef71d5c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">savored.com</a> discount, which I recommend if you're interested in visiting 1300.",

    "review_text": "My wife, Carol, took me for a Birthday Treat.  We were seated right away, although the room was quite full. Thankfully, it was big enough and soft enough so we could speak to one another and our waiter in normal tones. Carol said she read that it was a soul food place, and indeed, the clientele spanned a wide range of age and ethnicity.   The waiter and sommelier couldn't have been more personable and helpful. We felt good before our first bite. Well, okay, we had been munching on lovely light slices of cornbread with butter and jalapeno jelly.  The Bourbon Braised Pork Belly with Shelled White Bean Puree appetizer was artfully presented and tasted as good as it was described, and just the right size for the two of us.  Carol ordered an entr\u00e9e of Maple Syrup Slow Braised Beef Short Ribs, Crispy Onion Rings and Buttermilk-Chive Mash Potatoes. Since that was taken out of play, I decided on Fulton Valley Farms Organic Black Skillet Fried Chicken, Buttermilk Whipped Potatoes and Pan Gravy even (or maybe especially) though I was warned that I must \"allow for a 20 minute preparation time\" for that dish. Hey, Southern Fried Chicken... what better place to have it. We also ordered a Caramelized Sweet Onion Ham Hock Braised Greens side dish, mostly because I have all those ingredients at home and maybe I can recreate it.  We shared a bottle of Tejada Temprinillo, a medium bodied red wine made from a traditional Spanish grape in Lake County.  Our entrees and side dish arrived shortly after the appetizer was cleared. Each was presented to tickle our taste buds. I had three pieces of chicken, a leg, a thigh and a breast, all boned and covered with a spiced thick breading. The meat inside was juicy and each bite brought home the idea of Southern fried, with no lingering grease. I ate slowly, wanting to savor what I could - there was no way in the world I could eat it all.   Carol gave me a taste of her short ribs - we're not ones to share entrees, but an exchange of bites is okay, sometimes - it was as good as I imagined, but I was into chicken tonight.   The side of greens - though excellent - was unnecessary. There was quite enough food, and variety, without it. The waiter took our copious leftovers to package for take-home.  I wanted the apple bread pudding for dessert, it just seemed like the right thing. Carol felt it would be too heavy. Au contraire... it was light and tender and a perfect finishing touch.  After we paid the check and were ready to leave, the waiter brought out our leftovers. It just put the cap on the superb service we had enjoyed throughout the evening... they brought the stuff when we were ready, not when they were ready.",

The restaurant was very nicely put together and the ambiance was very relaxing. However, the food was way overpriced and not very good.   Fried chicken - very juicy and tender. easily the best dish of the evening. however, the crust was very, very thick and not light and crispy   Ribs - very dry and zero flavor. we had to dunk it in the sauce just to wash it down   Catfish - it was served lukewarm and everything else on the plate was cold   We went elsewhere for dessert. Could not take the chance of spending more money on underwhelming food.   I was very surprised at the good reviews on yelp",

I def could've bought myself ALOT of KFC n Popeyes with that $23! me n my cousins went here to try out the Dine about town on a saturday nite. So after we waited for 20 minutes to be seated we asked about the dine about town menu and they told us it was only from Sunday thru thursday. If it was not close to 10 pm..we probably would've left but we figured that since this place got good reviews why not?  Well this place apparently should be more known for the Short Ribs instead of the fried chicken. We all got different things so that we could try it out...we got the short ribs, fried chicken, and half stack ribs. Then we also got the spiced up fat fries and the BBQ shrimp with creamy grits. I don't know why they say BBQ shrimp cuz it def was not BBQ at all! man...I must admit that I was a bit disappointed at this place. I mean I am a fried chicken lover so to say that a $23 fried chicken was bland n not good...it really breaks my heart :( I ended up eating half of the short ribs that my cousin ordered. This place is pretty pricey...if it was not for the short ribs..I would've given this place a 2 star. I do however liked the decor and the lounge area. Maybe it was lacking chili sauce...but still I would not be back at this restaurant anytime soon.",

We even asked if it was too late, but we were offered seats and a menu. The waitress however was incredible rude. She must have been pissed that we wouldn't be letting her get off her shift early and she made sure we knew it. It colored the entire experience. Had we know that it was going to be like this, we would have skipped this place. The drinks were ok. I'm a little disappointed that \"Malibu\" is showcased on their list of rums and \"lemon drop\" is a signature cocktail. It's kind of opposite of the classy image the restaurant seems to project. The hushpuppies were nothing to remark about. The ambiance would have been nice, if we weren't so rushed. We obviously were not the last people in the place- plenty of dinners and bar customers abound, but somehow we felt like we were being rushed out. I might give this place another chance, but from our first experience this was crossed of the list. There's plenty of places to eat on Fillmore. There are also plenty of classy southern cooking restaurants as well. Unfortunately the bathrooms were incredibly messy, but I suppose that's how it gets at the end of the night?",

    "review_text": "I had high expectations for the Sunday gospel brunch at 1300. Two seating times at 11am and 1pm, $40 prix fixe menu, live music. Pretty fancy schmancy brunch if you ask me. Unfortunately, they didn't deliver and I'm better off at cheaper, more relaxed places like Foreign Cinema and Citizen Cake.   Service: It's the little things that count and they fell short. They didn't bother to remember who ordered what, so over the loud music, you had to shout out if it looked like your dish. Also, the dishes were not all ready at the same time. One dish came out a good 10 min after everyone else's. Last pet peeve, they asked if I wanted a refill on coffee. At $40 a pop, you don't ask, you just do it.   Food: Overall, above average, 4 stars. Bread basket was so-so. I had the corn bread and it wasn't anything extraordinary. It would have been nice if they refilled it so you could try something else. It sucks when you have to race to grab the best looking thing. For the main course, I had the bbq shrimp and grits. It was quite delicious and highly recommended. They also did a nice job with the desserts. I tried the apple cobbler and peanut butter crunch chocolate mousse. Both were great.   Ambiance: The gospel band was a nice touch but there's a difference in opinion if you like loud live music during a meal. At the one hand, you're entertained. On the other, you are shouting and can't hold a decent conversation during the 30 min setlist. The band was good but I have a feeling they don't vary their set much so this wouldn't be a good place to return to frequently. They played your standard Lean On Me, Oh Happy Day, Amazing Grace, etc.   Conclusion: Glad I went, decent experience, but not outstanding.",

In any case, we stuck around because we had heard good things and the menu looked pretty good. We started with the spiced fat fries and were only mildly amused. The homemade ketchup was pretty tasty, but I felt like the fries could have been crispier and overall kind of underwhelming.   On to the mains. I ordered the blackened catfish and my boyfriend ordered the fried chicken. Having been to a couple other places that offer $25+ chicken, we were pretty anxious to put this chicken to the test and I am sorry to say that it - FAILED. \u00a0It wasn't very crispy and the spices verged on funky at times. I still can't put my finger on what it is spice wise that I'm tasting, but it was kind of awkward. \u00a0   Unfortunately, I had the same reaction to the catfish too. It was just ok and not great.

The photos in the lounge are amazing.  We started with the scones, which were very tender and went nicely with the accompanying strawberry and rhubarb jam. I ordered the often-mentioned shrimp and grits, and Carly P ordered a goat cheese and asparagus omelet.   I found the portion of the shrimp &amp; grits to be small (maybe I was just hungry?) and while the dish was good, it wasn't at all what I expected. Instead of a thicker and more smoky barbeque sauce, the sauce on top of it was vinegary, and tasted strongly of worcestershire sauce. The grits, however, were amazing and I would happily order them as a side or a portion of any other meal. They were okay, but next time I would try something else.   Carly's omelet was really, really good though. It was cooked well, cheesy, and yummy. I had more than a few bites. The potatoes that came with it were over-seasoned, though.   Because we were still hungry (the portions were on the small side), and we had time, we ordered dessert. The strawberry shortcake was beautifully presented, and tasted just as good.  I'd like to come back for dinner to give this place another chance. Overall, I thought the food was overpriced for what you got. Yes, the omelet was good, but I could make that at home pretty easily.",

The menu has quite a selection and I love going to places that offer so many options, you can't decide. We definitely had that problem. There was fish, fulton valley fried chicken, short rib, lamb chop - something for everyone! The menu has American bistro items but a certain southern feel is infused in most of the appetizers, entrees, and sides. The lamb chop from Colorado was big, juicy, and tender. Although I didn't try the short rib, I imagine it is one of their specialties and it looked divine! The braised pork belly was absolutely fantastic and the best I've had in SF.

We both had the french toast which was pretty darn tasty, and the grits...oh the grits...get a giant bowl and just chow on them. They are to die for!

Came here for Valentine's Day dinner and swooned over the ambiance, food, and the handsome man sitting across from me in a pink tie :)  Valentine's dinner proceeded in following order: (Starter) Complimentary Cornbreads-Moist and not grainy. Thought the Jalapeno Jelly would be spicy, but not at all and rather pleasantly sweet. Honey butter was fluffy and light.   (Drinks) Glass of wine for him Southern Soul cocktail for me-I think the mixture had Southern Comfort &amp; Orange juice. The concoction was definitely strong enough for me to titter totter home.   (Appetizers) 1300 Charcuterie Platter for him-The Duck Rillete (tasted like unsalty dumpling filling) and the House-Cured Tasso Ham were delicious. The Creole Mustard...OMG...I honestly never tasted mustard this good in my life. DEFINITELY ask for more bread with this dish. It's not enough to enjoy everything on this platter Barbecue Shrimp N' Creamy Grits-Definitely a D^3 (drop dead delicious) in my book. The grits were so savory and the shrimps so plump and juicy that I wanted to cancel the entree and just fill up on grits for the night  (Entree)  Black Skillet Fried Chicken for him- Impressed with the choice of spices used with the fried chicken and non-greasiness. Came with Buttermilk whipped potatoes and 2 biscuits. Just wish it was crispier.  1/2 Rack of Dry Rub Ribs for me-I came into the restaurant thinking with my mind set on Short Rib, but as soon as our server mentioned \"Mac &amp; Cheese\" and \"BBQ sauce\" I changed my mind. I should've just stuck with the first choice. The ribs were a tad dry and the mashed potato &amp; mac n cheese were a miss.   (Dessert) Couldn't have any because we were TOO FULL. But have to come back for those beignets and coffee soda.   The servers were attentive especially ours with her sweet smile and always checking on us. The silverwares were always changed for each course and the waters filled to the brim. Hope to be back for the short ribs, beignets, and if allowed, a cauldron of grits.",

    "review_text": "I'm surprised this place has the hype it does. The food is standard for a restaurant of its caliber in a city like San Francisco, but the prices are exorbitant for what you get. $26 Fried Chicken, $30 pork chop, $32 Catfish. The starters are about $15 - $17 and quite small. Furthermore, I found it to be really pretentious that the sides of fries and macaroni and cheese, etc were $7.50  So I ordered the ribeye burger, mostly because I was on a budget this trip. When the burger came out, it was TINY made more obvious by the fact that the bun was literally twice the size of the patty. They only serve the burger with house made potato chips, which despite being tasty, seem odd for a dinner entree and they will not allow you to substitute for the fries that are available as a side. I think it's ridiculous that they won't do this. I would have no problem paying an upcharge for the substitution but they resounded a flat NO.  So I was disappointed with my burger and when I told the server about it, she seemed very put out. After I gave my feedback about the food, she never returned to the table the entire time we were eating, while being totally attentive and busy with all the surrounding tables.  Despite being on a budget, I would have been unhappy paying the prices for any of the other food. There are SO many other MUCH BETTER places in SF to spend that kind of money where you get SO much more.  As far as Southern inspired cuisine, I'd be much happier at the Front Porch. It's far more funky, fun, cool, and has much better direction in their kitchen,  I will not return to 1300, it is simply not a \"must visit\"",

    "review_text": "Okay, so I have a love/hate relationship with 1300. \u00a0I think if we could have half stars I'd probably give it more like 3 1/2 stars. \u00a0When I first went here, it was within the first 2 months that it opened and I think I was just so overwhelmed with the ambiance that I didn't pay attention to the food as much. \u00a0I have to admit, I am biased, my husband worked here for some period of time, but hey I'm being honest! \u00a0But you'd think I would've been there more often with that being the case, and I only ate here twice in that year (or less).  I do remember that I got the salmon for dinner that first time, and I was disappointed that even with prompting to the waitress to have it well done, that it still came back a bit rare. \u00a0Granted again that was 2 months or so after opening, so maybe they were ironing out the wrinkles. \u00a0However, the next time I did go, I had the braised short rib and that was pretty darn good. \u00a0  I do have to say though that my favorite aspect about the cuisine itself is that the pastry chef is very sweet and you can tell she's a perfectionist. \u00a0Everything that gal makes is ridiculously perfect and delicious with every bite. \u00a0My favorite desserts there are the chocolate beignets and Noriko's rendition of the banana creme pie which I swear I need to eat again. \u00a0  On one hand, I think my hopes for 1300 was that it would help to just transform the ambiance of the lower Fillmore itself. \u00a0As a teen, I remember going to the Fillmore to go buy my Tupac shirts and just felt like this area had so much promise. \u00a0In a lot of ways I think 1300 does this. \u00a0The other part of me, can't get over $23 for fried chicken. \u00a0I mean, I get that the preparation for it is very intensive, very intensive...yet $23 is pretty high priced. Makes me feel like 1300 can't be the catalyst for change in that area unless it means to usher all the lower income people out and to bring in all the yuppies. \u00a0I get it, upscale.. have to keep reminding myself of that. \u00a0It's kind of like my review of Harput's adidas (which I highly recommend you read). \u00a0Yet you know, sometimes when you're in the mood for good food, and with this economy, I can't help but think that at Hard Knox it's like $9 for 3 pieces, 2 sides and cornbread. \u00a0  I'd go to 1300 just to support the business itself, and the owners who seem to be great people. \u00a0But again it's not a spot you can just up and decide to go to, not in this economy anyway.",

    "review_text": "I treated my BF to an Easter dinner here at 1300 On Fillmore. The decor of the restaurant was really nice. The service was great and there was a jazz singer singing in the lounge area that completed the vibe of the restaurant. With that being said I have to say I was a bit disappointed with the food. The food was really expensive, so be prepared to spend $$$ for what I thought was somewhat mediocre. They brought out corn bread, which was tasty and we started with the BBQ Shrimp and Grits (the grits tasted more like risotto then grits), as well as the Shrimp Hush puppies (they are shrimp versions of a corn dog). Both were different then what I'm used to, but tasted good. For dinner we ordered the the Arctic Char (Salmon) over lobster and sausage hash and the pan fried chicken w/mash potatoes and two mini biscuits. We also ordered a side of greens. I didn't taste or see any lobster in the hash and it was drowned in some kind of reduced wine sauce. The salmon was cooked well, but it failed in an attempt to make me want to spend another $27 for it. The fried chicken was tasty along with the mashed potatoes and mini biscuits, but with Popeye's Chicken a block away I doubt I'll be returning to spend $23. The greens had a good taste to them, but I thought they were under cooked. The Strawberry Rhubarb champagne cocktails were really good and my BF really enjoyed his mint julep. I give the whole experience 4 stars (I subtracted 1 star due to food experience). I would totally encourage people to go check out the lounge, and have a few cocktails.",

    "review_text": "My recent escapades into the world of soul food has reached its pinnacle, in terms of style and elegance, with 1300 On Fillmore.  This classy restaurant scores huge points for its lounge, bar and dining area. It's a shame that I had an early dinner because I wanted to see this place illuminate during the evening. My only quibble is for the uneven seating at my table. One side of the table had a laid back sofa, while the other side had some high seated chairs. I ended up looking down at my friends who were slumped down on their sofa.  Besides the awkward seats, the atmosphere here is outstanding and most of the food shines bright.  The Fried Green Tomato Salad and the Sauteed Wild Mushroom appetizers were both very tasty. I would like to try some of the other appetizers next time based on these two winners.  On the other hand, the two sides that accompanied the main course both fell flat. The Mac and White Cheddar Cheese was too dry and overwhelmed by too much cheese. The Caramelized Sweet Onion Ham Hock Braised Greens (say that 3 times fast) was drowned by too much of the sweet liquids from the onion and ham, which killed the flavor and texture of the greens.  Overall, I did enjoy the Fried Chicken. The meat was juicy but I did not particularly like the spices used here; mainly the cumin. The mash potatoes accompanying this dish was a little too rich.  The Braised Beef Short Ribs fell just a little short of perfection, but it's a huge triumph. Although the rib needed just a little fat to give it that extra flavor and texture, the dish tasted sublime and the presentation was splendid.   You get two onion rings around one tender meaty rib, on top of a bed of fresh greens, on top of some of the best mash potatoes I've ever experienced. The maple syrup gives the meat, which falls right off the bone, a touch of sweetness. The mash potatoes had the right texture and flavors, but left light on the cream to counterbalance the richness of the ribs. Perfecto.  I applaud the chef here for bringing out the great flavor of the collard greens for this dish, by leaving the greens alone to exhibit its freshness and flavors.  To finish off the meal, I got to enjoy the light and airy Mud Cake and the sweet and tantalizing Chocolate Beignets. Both desserts were delicious. I just have to say... what a nice way to end dinner.",

But the food is distinctly apart of San Francisco's food tradition. \u00a0  We spoiled our appetites by having cornbread to start. Taste and texture were well-balanced although a bit dry, served with a choice of Pepper Jelly (you could taste the pepper skins) or Honey Truffle Butter (mmm).   For entries, we got Fried Chicken, Pork Chops and the Maple Syrup Seared Pork Shortribs.  The Fried Chicken: A bed of truffled mash potatoes infused the chicken, itself moist and battered in a well-seasoned batter, to give a earthy and rich taste. The batter was even better because the chicken's natural shape allowed extra pools of batter to glam together creating extra pockets of goodness.  The Shortrib was on a bed of chived mashed potatoes, which were well-seasoned, earthy and light despite the meat's heaviness. The ribs were glazed and cooked with maple syrup that was tender to the touch and flavorful.  The Porkchop was cooked very well. Served medium, the chop wasn't tough nor dry, but rather moist, warm and tender  Dessert: Beignets have a special place in my heart and 1300's ranks up there. Warm, fluffy and served with a bowl of chocolate sauce and an \"Espresso Soda\" with a kick that cut through the sweetness.  All in all 1300 is a winner, and currently, it's number in my Fried Chicken Quest, knocking the Blue Jay cafe and Bake Sale Betty's (which is an admittedly different creature) out of that spot.",

The food itself, for the price it is, wasn't the best I've ever had. \u00a0The cornbread with honey butter and jalapeno jam we started off with was so good. \u00a0Our waiter, bless his heart, very sweet, but mixed up out order and instead of mushrooms we got the shrimp and grits, which was probably the most delicious of all our dishes and we tried many.  They ran out of goat cheese so we couldn't have the special fried green tomato salad, but had an arugula salad which was tasty. \u00a0We also ordered, the Bouillabaise, which was very fishy tasting and a little bland, the Halibut, which was cooked and seasoned well, and the gnnocci, which wasn't the best we've ever had.  I am a lover of fried chicken, and while the batter and the cooking of the chicken were very authentic, it still wasn't the best fried chicken I've ever had. \u00a0It was moist and cooked well, but the batter was under-seasoned. \u00a0Fortunately, the batter was crispy and stayed crispy. \u00a0And finally, the side of mac and cheese was quite delicious. \u00a0It was made with a Bechamel base and I did feel like I was eating a gourmet mac and cheese, so that was nice.",

The menu offers many tasty items but I must admit not all are great. My favorite item (as well as my husbands), hands down, is the shrimp and grits!! Other tasty items include the fried chicken and the ribs. However, the lamb entree did not work well with me ... felt it could have been seasoned a bit better (but was tender). \u00a0I will continue to try different items in the future since this is a nice restaurant to visit.",

    "review_text": "My very 1st review on this great site isn't such a great one.  Tonight I carried my overrated expectations from the great reviews I read about 1300 on Fillmore, and got a slap in the face.  I made the reservation at 7pm, and arrived with my brother and 2 of his friends at 6:50. The 3 guys are all underage so no wine for them, too bad. The bartender passed us a couple times, never asked or even looked at us. I didn't know if there was a cocktail list at all. The wait wasn't bad though, we were seated at 7 pm sharp.  As we look at the menu, the waiter asked to bring water to us. When the water arrived, he asked if we wanted anything to drink. Since I was the only person at the table who's over 21, I decided not to be the only person drinking at our table. Everything is fine up until this point, when we found out we were the only all-Asian and the youngest table in the whole place.  Once we said no drinks, it took the waiter 20 mins to come back, after we looked around trying to \"cue\" him to come. I didn't know if it was too loud in the restaurant, but each one of us had to repeat our order for 3 times, almost yelling the last time.  The cornbread was the best of the night. The waiter who brought the bread had a nice smile, compared to the other guy. Anyways, the appetizer (the palate and the fried shrimp) was okay, maybe again I was expecting too much. The fired chicken and the ribeye arrived as stated on the menu, 20 minutes after the appetizers were cleaned from our table.  The waiter came and asked us if the food was okay before I could take a bite, so I said everything is fine. The chicken was pretty salty, and given the price of it, I'd say I would go to Popeye's and peel the bones and serve it at home. I guess the ambience is worth $12 more. I couldn't finish it, so when the waiter came back after another 20 mins, I asked him to box the chicken.  I asked for a dessert menu, and we were to get one of those chocolate things... However, the waiter decided that even though we were one of the 5 tables left while 3 of them belonged to another waiter, he wanted to give us another 15 mins to find the dessert we wanted. So, not wanting to wait another 30 mins to finish this dinner, we didn't want the dessert anymore, and asked for the check.  The check came fairly quickly. It's been 25 mins passed since the table was cleaned, and I still hadn't seen my fried chickens in a box. I didn't want to waste my time anymore, and I was sure the waiter wasn't going to suddenly remember to bring it out to me, since we signed the bill already, so we left. It was probably going to be pointless to even ask since the chicken was probably in the garbage. This 6-dish-dinner wasn't worth the $170 we paid.  Not that I'm saying they didn't care for us being there, but that's what we felt. \u00a0I would give this place another chance in 4,5 years, when I come back as, and with a bunch of 25 year olds+ non Asian friends, who look like they will spend at least $60 more only on alcohols.",

    "review_text": "Numeric synergy: 1300 for 2000.  It was a Southern-inspired celebration. Yelp 2000 (actually #2322 with updates counted, but that doesn't work quite as well) called for a nice dinner out. 1300 did not disappoint.  Food (very good) and service (warm and friendly though the food took its sweet time) aside, I like 1300 for what it signals to the neighborhood. Revival. Acknowledging history. Trying to turn things around.  And by dining here you support it. Fortunately support means such good eats as creamy mushroom grits. And maple braised short ribs (not mine, neighbors, who loved it). And catfish on a bed of sausage and shrimp jambalaya (mine, also loved).  Not as heavy and rich as expected, which meant we rallied for dessert. A few bites into the caramelized apple bread pudding and banana cream pie with a caramel lime sauce we knew the rally was worth it. Save room, both were outstanding.  Space evokes the heritage of the neighborhood. There are photos of jazz musicians. Live jazz adds the perfect ambiance to the lounge. The dining room is spacious with a dark wood atheistic. Nicely done.  Yelp 2000 or something else entirely, 1300 is a worthy place to celebrate.",

One of the non-eaters ordered the oyster bisque as the entree and it was terrible-too garlicky and way too sweet, no hint of oyster whatsoever. \u00a0Others ordered the short-rib, that at times was dry, tasteless and almost standard. \u00a0The boneless fried chicken was awesome, both dark and white meat were juicy, tender, well seasoned and gets props for keeping me classy with my fork and knife. \u00a0 No room for dessert since we kept pounding the cornbread, but did look good.

You can use the butter knife to manage the bone as you gently lift the meat away. It is soooo tender and falls right off! Oh, presentation was great! But it didn't last long, for me. I had to dig in. Did I mention that the meat just fell off the bone? With no effort, that bone was CLEAN! That meant no sucking the bone dry, but that probably wouldn't have been appropriate there? Yeah, it came with mashed potatoes and onion rings. They were tasty, but that's just filler. The meat was freaking yummy!  The grilled tenderloin of beef was alright. Not as tender. More dry and a teeeeeeensy bit tough (mind you the toughness and juiciness is now being compared to the short ribs, which really ruined any comparison). The short ribs won that round by a long shot.  Also tried the barbecue shrimp with creamy grits. \u00a0Doesn't that just sound intriguing? \u00a0And it was! \u00a0I wouldn't order it again next time, but that's only because it spiked my taste buds and curiosity, and now I really want to try the other appetizers, too. \u00a0  I wish I saw the wine list, but I was driving, and I didn't want to tempt myself. =( bum deal  As for the restaurant itself? \u00a0They were busy for a wednesday! \u00a0I couldn't really hear the jazz playing in the background, but when I strained, I could. It would have been nice to hear it, but that means gotta go on a slower night. \u00a0Ah, and the table wasn't stable. It was definitely a lean-two....two must lean to balance it out. But I didn't complain because I was in a highly entertained mood, and it was adding to my entertainment. \u00a0As was our server. We had a freakin awesome server. He was super helpful and had a good sense of humor, even when he thought we were laughing at him and took forever to explain that we were laughing at our own silliness.",

My fried chicken was tasty, but not mind blowing. But my friend's Bouillabaisse was awful! \u00a0All the ingredients were incredibly overcooked. The scallop was solid all the way through.

We had a big party of 14, and they accommodated us with a long (Knights of the Roundtable like) table in a pseudo private room. \u00a0Originally it was opened to the dining room, but since we were getting a bit rowdy, they closed the sliding door and curtain, and it made for a great private room where we could be as obnoxious as we wanted. \u00a0  As for the food, I really enjoyed the stuff I ordered. \u00a0The complimentary cornbread with honey butter and pepper jelly (put them together) was amazing and I couldn't stop eating it (and they kept it coming!). \u00a0The braised pork belly appetizer was incredibly tender, and whatever was underneath it (mashed potatoes or leeks?) complimented it well. \u00a0I also shared the shrimp hush puppies with some spicy aioli, and those were pretty good as well. \u00a0For the entree, my roomie and I shared the mashed potato's and short ribs, which we really enjoyed. \u00a0The ribs just fell off the bone and were super tender and flavorful. \u00a0Unfortunately my buddy who ordered the other pork dish, was very unimpressed. \u00a0I also tasted the lamb, mac'n'cheese and lobster bouillabaisse. \u00a0The bouillabaisse was different cause it was more like seafood plate with sauce, but it was good none the less. \u00a0Lamb was a bit dry, but good, and mac and cheese was awesome and I will def. order it next time around. \u00a0The one thing no one liked was the cabbage salad, so I would stay clear of that. \u00a0  The wine list was pretty good, though the by the glass selection wasn't extensive. \u00a0I had a bottle of the pinot gris, which was a good deal for $28. \u00a0The only beers they had was an IPA and Pilsner (draft) but the boys at the table seemed to enjoy them. \u00a0I also got the bananas foster for dessert, and it was pretty good, though I was stuffed at that point. \u00a0  Service was pretty fast, especially considering our large party and we couldn't complain there at all. \u00a0Prices are standard for a nice place (entrees around 25, appetizers 8-10) and there's a lot of street parking. \u00a0They have a bar menu that goes till 1am if you're looking for snacks and a night cap. \u00a0  Overall, this place is more upscale than I expected and is classing up Western Addition/Lower Pac Heights. \u00a0I didn't really hang at the bar area, but it looked nice and mellow. \u00a0Once Yoshi's opens up in a few weeks, it will be nice to finally offer my neighborhood \u00a0to my friends as a place to get a nice meal, some drinks and some jazz.",

    "review_text": "\"The best fried chicken I've ever had\" - friend  I love fried chicken and I wanted to believe so bad. Perhaps it was the insanely high expectations. Perhaps it was from filling up on all the delicious cornbread. While the fried chicken was great, I can't endorse it as the best I've ever had.  On the positive side, it's extremely flavorful, to the point where it's borderline salty. You can tell the chicken was brined for a long time. The outside has a nice soft crunch of a chicken fried with generous amounts of care and shortening on a cast iron skillet. Just like mom would make it... if mom were from the American South. While I can't say it was dry, I would have preferred it taken off the grill just a tad bit earlier.  I'd put the fried chicken in a tie for third place for fried chicken in San Francisco, right up there with Hard Knox. Maverick's gets the nod at number two on my list, and Brenda's is number one (drool....).  The side dishes at 1300 were hit and miss. The cornbread and accompanying jalapeno jam and honey butter were excellent. The grits were also fantastic, which paired fantastically with the combination of shrimp and gravy over the grits. The fried okra was okay. The mac and cheese (one of my favorite foods) I'm sorry to say, should have been a pass; there was no truffle flavor, I found it way too oily, and to each his own, but I'm not a huge fan of bleu cheese in mac and cheese, even in small doses.  It's a beautiful, well decorated, very handsome space inside, but you'd never know it from the outside.  Props on the spot on service and the great drinks at the bar. Old Fashioned with Russell's 10 Yr was a winner. Definitely coming back for drinks at the lounge and to take in some live jazz.",

Alas, it wasn't at all on a Saturday night during dinnertime so I want to say that you probably don't need reservations here unless you're in a huge party and want to be sure to get a table.  The food was pretty delicious. I tried these items: 1) barbecue shrimp n' grits  2) black skillet fried chicken buttermilk whipped potatoes, pan gravy chive herb biscuits I recommend getting either of these. The chicken was tender and the grits were buttery goodness. I'm no soul food expert, but I think I've had enough around the southern US to deem the food here good.  I had the sweet tea cocktail which was pretty tasty, but like most times, it's a small amount of fluid for a ~$10. Probably not the best place to splurge on alcohol--there are cheap bars close by (Boom Boom Room).  I wish there was live music while I was there around 6:00PM--probably too early. The lounge that you see when walking in looks really nice. If I ever come here just for drinks, it would be cool to hang out in that room. Generally, the furniture and decor is very elegant and lighting is romantic.  Service was good, the experience was smooth, the food was on point and filling. I would recommend checking this joint out before a show at Yoshi's or if you can't get a table at State Bird Provisions right away.  Is it rude that for any restaurant I review around State Bird Provisions, I say something about not getting a table right away at SBP to go to this secondary place?",

We followed her back to the host area and are told by the host the table is not actually ready, and we're just left standing there awkwardly.   Ok, so fast forward, we're finally seated and are given no menus. The waiter appears and asks us why we have no menus as if we would know. The table we were sat at was near the bar area which has clear glass and there were tons of people pressed up against the glass staring at us while we ate. I was completely uncomfortable. I ordered the fried chicken with mashed potatoes. The chicken was dry and flavorless, Popeye's has better fried chicken than this place.   Our table was not far from the host station and the \"chef\"/manager was speaking to the host telling them to \"take care of\" a couple who had just arrived. This chef/host was the same individual who asked us what we were doing standing awkwardly waiting to be sat after we were told our table was ready and it wasn't. This guy looked like a piece of work walking around the restaurant wearing a chef's outfit trying to look important.   What was really interesting is that after we placed our order we never saw our waiter again. The bus boy then miraculously became the waiter. I asked him for a to go box and he took my plate to box it up and was supposed to bring the box back. The bus boy then also disappeared and a woman approached our table apologizing about our waiter disappearing and explained he had an emergency. We had already paid and I was waiting for my to go box and had to ask someone else to track it down. This was an awful experience. Usually a restaurant will have off service or off food but not typically both at the same time. In this case it was terrible food and terrible service. This place left an awful taste in my mouth. I would not recommend it to anyone and I would not return.",

    "review_text": "My girlfriend took me here for my birthday. \u00a0We were a bit early for our reservation, so we thought we would get a drink and appetizer while we were waiting. \u00a0We ordered 2 dirty Martini's and the lamb sliders in the lounge and since it was still happy hour the appetizers were half price. \u00a0There was a nice onion relish on sliders and they were tasty, but I was glad they were half price as the lamb was about the diameter of a silver dollar and if I paid full price I would have to fork over 9 of them (dollars that is) for an order of 3 sliders. \u00a0The Martini's were good, but they were small given the fact they were $14 each (can't figure out the $2 charge to be served up).  On to dinner. \u00a0We got seated quickly and our waiter was professional and attentive. \u00a0I ordered the smoked rib special which was served with the mac and cheese and my girlfriend ordered the prix fix menu with a citrus fennel salad, crispy skin salmon with sweet potato risotto, followed by an apple cobbler. \u00a0I asked how they smoked the ribs in the restaurant and the waiter told me they do it early in the morning in the restaurant. \u00a0My girlfriend's salad was quite good. \u00a0On to the entrees-the salmon was very good, but the risotto was not risotto at all, it was creamy potato cubes. \u00a0We asked the waiter what it was and he stated it was the chef's \"take\" on risotto. \u00a0I don't know what others expect, but I am thinking creamy arborio rice laced with a mashed sweet potato mixture. \u00a0My advice is if you are going to serve an interpretation of a dish, you should put it in quotes and explain what you are serving. \u00a0The \"smoked\" ribs were a bit dry but overall not bad, although a bit bland. \u00a0Having lived in the midwest for a number of years, I have had considerable experience with ribs. \u00a0They were not tender enough and did not taste smokey, and definitely lacked the nice pink ring on the outer edge of the meat. \u00a0THERE IS NO WAY THESE RIBS ARE SMOKED. \u00a0It was a good thing I ordered the full rack because there were 4 forkfulls of Mac and Cheese.  On to dessert. \u00a0My girlfriend got her prix fix dessert and on the plate was written happy bithday! \u00a0  Overall, I give the food a 3 as well as the service, but the food and service coupled with what I believe to be EXTREMELY overpriced for the quality. \u00a0If you charge $35 for a rack of smoked ribs...they should be smoked.",

    "review_text": "I would like to preface this by saying that I moved to the Bay Area from the South - and not the fake South like Texas, Virginia, or Atlanta, Georgia - the real South, from a city largely famous for its food, in fact.  When I read the menu of 1300 on Fillmore on their website my fiance and I both said, \"We have to go there.\"   Reservation at 6:45, got seated right away. I walked in and LOVED the decor. It was totally unique, dark, and lucious. The lounge was full and the front 1/3 of the restaurant was too (it filled up to about 3/4 by the time we were finished).  We were seated by a nice host and had the most delightful waiter (ask for Jonothon, he's adorable). We were immediately BLOWN AWAY by the delicious corn bread triangles and honey butter. They also give you jalape\u00f1o jelly which the waiter assistant assured us was not spicey and it wasn't, but it was very tasty, however I devoured the honey butter because - hello - honey butter! We finished two helpings and had to force ourselves to not say yes when we were asked if we wanted more. It wasn't just, \"good for San Francisco\" good corn bread - it was good for anywhere corn bread, for real.   I'm a total grits snob and have been severly disappointed/disgusted by the grits I've had in California. I refer to these typical runny, flavorless grits as \"California grits\" (I'm clever). When we ordered the Barbecue Shrimp and Grits the waiter applauded our selection, and I couldn't help but mention my hesitation due to my Southern-food-bitchness, then I explained \"California grits\" to him. He was adament that they are not \"California grits\".   These grits were unlike any grits I'd had before - they were stiff (which is good) but still juicy (which is awesome) with the right consistency. The fancy yummy barbecue flavored sauce I could've lived without since I love the grit flavor, but it was still delicious. And my fiance, a shrimp lover, couldn't get enough of the plump shrimp.  After the appetizer I asked the adorable waiter if the chef was from the South - turns out he was born in Jamaica, lived in England a lot of his life, then moved to San Francisco. Fascinating! The waiter told us a lot more about how the chef came to cook Southern inspired food and I was just delighted.   Then the waiter said chef David Lawrence was floating around the restaurant and he'd send him over. I was kind of like, \"Yeah sure he'll come over, but it's nice of you to pretend\" A few minutes later, the chef came to our table with a smile and chatted with us. It was just so nice!  My fiance got the fried chicken which came with whipped potatoes and delicious little biscuits. It was too spicey for my liking but definitely well made. I had...just...HEAVEN on a plate. I'm not a big non-poultry meat eater but decided to try the Maple Syrup Slow Braised Beef Short Rib. It was so succulent and tender - it's last meal good, there's no other way to put it.  Stuffed and ready to die, we sat and digested and made ourselves push through to dessert (and I loved that they don't ask if you want to see the dessert menu, they just give it). Though the decision was tough, we went with the pineapple bread pudding (which made me go say what? when I saw it on the menu) with coconut ice cream on top and a delicious cherry sauce with big halves of cherries around the edge of the plate. It was a perfect little dessert. Absolutely delicious and just enough.   Honestly, the dining experience could not have been better and I am a tough customer, I admit.  My fiance and I decided that this could be the perfect place to have our rehearsal dinner - that's how much we loved our experience! As we were walking out the chef told us goodbye and shook my hand, and I told him about us wanting to have our rehearsal dinner there. He seemed genuinely pleased and excited that we enjoyed the restaurant so much and told us he'd love to have us!  They have a private room for parties but when I told him how much I liked the decor in the main room he said, \"Well we'll just reserve the back half for you then!\" Awesome.",

Besides the great food and lively ambiance in the restaurant, I have to compliment the customer service! I wasn't feeling well so my bf asked for warm water. Our waiter got it right away and got me some slices of lemon. Also, since I love their corn bread so much, I asked to pack the last piece of corn bread to go.

    "review_text": "I can't say I'm one of those people who looks for healthy food when I go out to eat. I know what I'm signing up for and I happily accept it. So, imagine my surprise when I discovered 1300 Fillmore had somehow managed to find a healthy and delicious way to make fried chicken.   Given that I'm a rabid red meat eater, the chicken was my friend's dish. I had the steak on blue cheese grits. Now, I'm not even a big fan of grits, but the flavor and consistency of the blue cheese coupled with the texture of the grits was perfect. Add a big slab of meat of top of that and you've just made my night. On a side, but just as important, note, try their mixed drinks..delicious.   Also, the ambiance of this place is noteworthy. Look to one side and you'll see your typical SF yuppie couple, look to the other and you'll see a swank, elderly couple depicting the bluesy vibe this restaurant gives off. It's a great place to people watch while enjoying a good meal.   The only reason I would give it 4 stars is because this place is horrible for groups. They made us wait for almost an hour and a half because they didn't want to tell the people at the table we were supposed to be at to leave. A sweet gesture..for them maybe, but they could have just as easily offered to buy them a round of drinks in return for moving to the bar/lounge area. We mentioned this to them but for whatever reason they didn't want to do this. They seemed to have feigned remorse about the situation and only after demanding that the manager act like he cared did he do so.   So, my recommendation - Go in a small group, order, in this order, a cocktail, the steak then the chicken, enjoy the bluesy ambiance and crowd and, if you want to make a night of it, go to a show at Yoshi's next door afterwards.",

People may hate on me for this...but 1300 has nothing on KFC when it comes to chicken! The meat was mostly moist but the skin had no crunchie crispness to it - perhaps from sitting out too long before being served to our table.   On the other hand, the maple syrup slow braised beef short ribs were done to perfection. The meat tenderly fell apart at the slightest touch of the fork, and came with a generous helping of chive mashed potatoes and three delicate deep fried onion rings. If you're looking for a side to try, pick the caramelized sweet onion ham hock braised greens. It was suggested to us by our waitress and absolutely exploding with flavor.  Overall, good food, live music, sleek decor. Come here for DAT or a special occasion.",

Things got off to a rocky start when our cocktail waitress didn't know what rye was (no joke), but she recovered quickly and everything was perfect thereafter. The lounge, by the way, is beautifully designed (as is the rest of the place), and it's now definitely on my list of places to stop by for a drink.  We had amazingly attentive and thoughtful service the entire night. Really spot on. Surprising for opening week, as well. The food itself was delicious, intriguing, well plated without being fussy. Totally satisfying. Apps we had were pork belly (truly divine, and the table favorite), shrimp and gritz (simple, perfectly cooked and satisfying), \"poached egg salad\" which was a warm cabbage salad served on rye crostini with a poached egg on top (surprising combo and a definite must for gourmands). Last app was shrimp hushpuppies. Everybody loved them, but they were straight-up hush puppies, nothing exciting.  Main dishes were also strong, all cooked perfectly. Short ribs, jambalaya, seared black bass and fried chicken. The fried chicken was great: juicy chicken wrapped around sturdy, crunchy batter. Yumm. The jamabalaya was served in a shallow bowl without much broth, which sounds disappointing but was actually a great move. You really got to appreciate all the different fish, sausage and other flavors. Short ribs were an interesting cut I'm not familiar with. Only one bone; lots of meat. A little more dense and not as fatty as the short ribs I'm accustomed to, but it was damn tasty. The black bass was the most simple and lightest entree, served with grilled artichoke hearts and something else like a ramp or leek or something in that family. Table thought the bass was boring, but I was really appreciated the light, flavorful fish cooked perfectly, with a tasty seasoning on the skin.  Dessert we ordered chocolate beignet and sweet potato souffle. The former: not as good as Brenda's on Polk, but tasty in their own way. Came with a coffee sauce that they could've left off. Souffle was a little light on flavor, but ever so fluffy and came with these little pieces of candied sweet potato on the side that were truly inspired.  Would definitely go again, and have been raving about it and recommending it to all my friends.",

Iced tea was a bit blah, but with a generous addition of simple syrup, was \u00a0much more potable. Fresh corn bread with honey butter was yummy as was the gem salad with toasted pecans and goddess dressing. The 20-minute wait for the fried chicken and mashed potatoes was worth it, although I could have done without the gravy made with red peppers. Icky. My nana's cream gravy would have been better. Skipped dessert as I was too full, but the homemade chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream was tempting.",

(granted, I can't remember the last time I had fried chicken prepared by anyone other than Colonel Sanders, but this was the most deliciously decadent meal I've enjoyed in a while!). \u00a0The hostess very accommodating (I had called earlier in the day to change my res from 2 people to 4).

    "review_text": "I am actually shocked at the positive reviews this restaurant has received. I made my decision to make a reservation for dinner there based on the positive Yelp reviews and we walked out mid-meal because the food and drinks were terrible.  Let me start by saying our waitress was very professional and pleasant. She was polite when I asked for the check and said that I had changed my mind and wanted to go somewhere else.  I cant say the same for the food or drinks though. We ordered two cocktails off the menu, and both tasted like something you would get at your neighborhood dive bar. There was no sophistication to the drinks whatsoever. For the prices they charge I think I deserved a fresh lime wedge on my margarita. Instead, it was one of those lime wedges that looked like it had been cut the night before and left out to dry. The drinks were strong but kind of gross. Anyway, even though the drinks sucked what was worse was the food.  We ordered appetizers and entrees but asked for the check immediately after the appetizers arrived so we didn't end up trying their entrees. The deviled eggs were okay, but nothing out of this world. The oysters on the other hand were DISGUSTING. I cannot forgive a restaurant that serves anything from the sea that isn't fresh. The oysters were anything but fresh. We managed to eat 3 of them, and coupled with the underwhelming eggs and nasty drinks we asked for the check and left our food and drinks almost untouched.  A restaurant that prides itself on elevated dining but offers subpar food and crappy drinks will not get another visit from me. We left and finished our dinner somewhere else.  If you are looking for an elevated dining experience, 1300 is so far off its almost sad.",

I wanted oysters and steak and delicious cocktails. But it sucked. The oysters tasted delicious but for $15 you only get six, which I guess is common in the area. The chicken liver mousse deviled eggs had a horrible color palette and the taste was a little off. Then the steaks. The $30 steaks. While they were cooked perfectly they were not seasoned. They were topped with brie, which in the culinary world, adding dairy to something as already awesome as a rib eye means you are masking something and it was horrible. The meat was tough. Im a sucker and just said everything was fine and got out of there as quickly as possible. So depressing. Never going back. And its possible that other items on the menu are better but im so disappointed. My only experiences in san fran dining so far have been over priced and horrid.

As the group waited for our table (a delay of a hour beyond our reservation time), we couldn't fend off our hunger pangs any longer and ordered a slew of appetizers, such as fries, shrimp hushpuppies, and warm poached egg salad.   When we were finally seated, we ordered more of the hushpuppies (probably the best thing there). Hubby ordered the (overpriced) fried chicken, while I ordered the (overcooked) ribeye steak.

    "review_text": "I find dining experiences in which you have no prior information(preconceptions and potential biases) usually the most rewarding regardless of the outcome. You may leave with some degree of disappointment or perhaps, you may leave with your stomach and feet floating off the ground tingling with euphoria and gastrointestinal joy.  Unfortunately, I left with neither of the aforementioned feelings and instead with the more typical feeling of indifference and not wishing to return unless by circumstance.  Beginning with the appetizers, the mac 'n cheese was pedestrian, the pork belly was literally barely there and medicore, the fried green tomatoes was decent, and the duck fat fries which sounded promising, turned out to be nothing to shout from the roof about. Moving on to the sampling of entrees we ordered, the grilled rib-eye steak tasted gamy to me, the pan roasted pork chop was meh, and my greatest hope for spectacular taste bud excitement, the black skillet fired chicken, landed with a soft thud. Our group shared a few plates of the warm chocolate beignets with two dipping sauces(chocolate and coffee soda) and it was lighter and fluffier than I would have preferred but was the highlight of my meal.  The private dining room is adjacent to the bar and comfortably seats 18. It provides middling privacy but rates in my book, a cool spot to host something such as a private birthday party. Our waitress was attentive and prompt, if not solemn, during the entire experience.   A few notes about the ambiance, dark woods, floor to ceiling lavender drapes, large back-lit black and white prints that line the entire back wall of the lounge area provide an elegant, sophisticated, vintage jazz joint feel. On this particular Friday evening, there was a pumping modern jazz band that began playing about 10 pm, which convinced us to have another drink at the bar.",

The hostess was very friendly and our server was even better. Very surprised to read about bad service there??? Being our first time there he took the time to explain the menu and make great recommendations. Being that I have grown up eating southern food (dads from Alabama) I already knew I wanted, FRIED CHICKEN!!!! My BF decided to go with the short ribs, we also had the mac n cheese and an order of fried okra. The first to arrive was the corn bread which came out quickly with our wine. The corn bread was warm, very moist and quit tasty. All though it states on the menu and our server had reminded me my chicken was going to take about 20-30 min it did not seem as long but it could have been the few glasses of wine and wonderful ambiance... Once we received our meal we dug in!!! Fried chicken was great, don't go there expecting to get your grandmas fried chicken, it's not!!! It's a bit more elegant but still flavorful, juicy and the skin was that perfect crunch. The mac n cheese was good but I've had better, the fried okra was flavord perfect. Then came the shocker of the evening, I have never been a big fan of pork or beef but I will always try it, the short ribs that my BF got was the highlight of the meal. I think it melted in my mouth, yes they were that good and again this is coming from a girl who's usually not a fan. Unfortunately I ate to much of my delicious entree and my BF's I had no room for dessert but will be getting the banana cream pie next time I'm there. All and all I would come back in here anytime.",

Friends of ours selected it because they had been there and liked it, and the restaurant is only a block from The Addition (formerly Yoshi's) where we had tickets for a Sunday night 7 pm show.  My companion and I had a Little Gem Salad, Barbecued Shrimp 'n Grits, and Baby-back Ribs, which was the special of the day. We shared all the items. The restaurant provided extra plates for us to split the dishes. We enjoyed all our selections, especially the Shrimp 'n Grits. I liked the ribs, but my companion thought they were a little tough. We chose the half-rack version. There were 6-7 ribs, more than adequate to share between small to moderate eaters. The ribs come with three little bowls: barbecue sauce, coleslaw, and Mac and Cheese. I'm not overly fond of Mac and Cheese, and thought this version tasted a little odd. Was it the truffle oil? My companion, a big fan of Mac and Cheese, also thought it tasted a little strange. We did not finish it.  The other couple also shared all of their items which included Deviled Eggs and boneless Fried Chicken. We also ordered a side dish of Braised Greens with caramelized onions and ham hock, which is perhaps the best thing on the menu: juicy, tender, and savory.  The wines seem a bit too pricey for the kind of food being served, so beer is a good option here. The dining room is elegant without being fussy, and the service is professional, helpful and non-intrusive.",

Took a while to get drinks, the waiter added that the bar was jammed and he had trouble getting our order. Service was lame. The waiter seemed uninformed about the menu and the entire table thought he must have been a last-minute hire for the night. (He reminded me of Jonesy from Reno 911). \u00a0   I really enjoyed the poached foie gras \u00a0($17) w/ blueberry jam on toasted brioche, but my husband's bourbon braised pork belly ($12) was the winner between the two. Had a taste of the sauteed wild mushroom w/ mascarpone hominy grits which was good, but would have been better with a little less black pepper.   The fried chicken ($23) was too salty as I could only eat one of the three boneless pieces. It had a nice crunchy texture, but it may have sat in the brine too long. Never had issues polishing off a plate of fried chicken ever. Loved the mini biscuits on the side and the whipped potatoes was tasty.   His grilled ribeye steak ($29) w/ blue cheese scented hominy grits in brandy sauce was not as special as it sounds. I had a couple of bites and found it too rich. He was very disappointed with this dish considering how pricey it was.   Had a bite of the brined pork chop $25) and was surprised how good it tasted. It was tender and \u00a0well seasoned.   We had the warm chocolate beignets ($9) for dessert that came w/ chocolate sauce &amp; coffee soda for dipping. \u00a0Nicely presented, but there's just 3 pieces and no one was blown away by the texture. \u00a0It wasn't as light as it should be.   Unfortunately I don't think we'll be returning anytime soon. Very hard not to expect better service with these prices. Later on we found out that they charged us for a salad that we had cancelled.......minus 1 star.",

Lying on the warm cozy bed of skin city and getting my eyebrows plucked, Kelly P had mentioned the fried chicken at 1300. Quote \" It was the best chicken I had in a long long long long time\".  Well, having a husband who doesn't like chicken but only does fried chicken, we decided to check this, 1300 out. Dressed in our best, (men in black), we marched to fillmore only to be greeted by a very nice host. Immediately, we were given a table for two. The first time, remember the first time in my restaurant dinning experience I was a little disappointed that we got the table right away coz I wanted to look around. With its dim light, the place looked mysterious and sexy...like a kid in a candy store my eyes peeking everywhere, i didn't want to seat down, but the hostess was waiting, and I had to sit down but I immediately excused myself to the restroom only to look around.   Pretending to be lost (dear host/waiter whoever you were, i wasn't lost, sorry), i looked around and was really impressed with the work. It reminded me of Michael MIna, but Roshan said he was more comfortable than MIchael Mina because 1300 is nice but not overwhelming.  They have excellent wine list. We started with a bottle of pinot gris, which by the way was delicious. We started with the arugula salad and pork belly. The arugula salad was perfect but Roshan liked the belly better. \u00a0Moving on we had to do the fried chicken. It was time to test, Kelly P taste, and yeah yeah it was delicious..the truffel infused mashed potato made a perfect combination. For dessert, (yes yes we can eat more, we are in the verge of having big-fat bellies,) we picked the beigniets, which were baked to perfection.  Did I mention they serve corn bread in the beginning?  Did I mention I think their pastry chef is really good?  Did I also mention that they have consultant pasty chef? How do I know this? It is written on the menu, you stupid. But Why?  Well, it was a great dinning experience. I am very happy for fillmore. Plan your evening at fillmore with jazz at Yushi's. Service was good too. Be nice to the server. He just moved from NM. Lets welcome him to crazy San Francisco.   Overall, this review is the longest I have ever written. Roshan would come and say to write a longer one for Metro. I can't do it now. My hand hurts. I will send Yelp the bill, if \u00a0my hands are fractured. It is all your fault.",

    "review_text": "I went back to 1300 on a Monday night.   We had a 7pm reservation but we arrived a bit early, we checked in and went to the bar for a drink while our table was getting prepped. The restaurant was not very busy so I am not sure why the maitre'd did not come back to say the table was ready. I went back over at 7 and had to ask to be brought to the table.   The cornbread appetizer of course is just wonderful.....   I tried the entree special, which was fried chicken with a soup/salad and apple cobble desert. The soup was a butternut squash with some kind of apple accent.....I thought it was very nice although my partner felt it was sort of bland...maybe it was, I liked it thought.   Now to the chicken, this is my 2nd time having this dish and once again, 1 bite made me fall out of my chair thats how good it is. I also ordered a side of greens.....the greens are cooked with sweet onions and I believe turkey ham hocks, the greens were a bit crisp for me (I like them well done) but when eaten with a bit of the onion it was just perfect. The flavor is wonderful.   My partner had the same dish as I but my mom had the catfish. She said it was really good and there was not any bones in the fish, I don't personally like fish so I didn't try a piece but I will take her word for it.   For desert there was apple cobbler, the crust was rich and buttery and the apples were done to the perfect level of sweetness and consistancy.   The server however was less than perfect, we saw him maybe 2 or 3 times over a 2 1/2 hour period. He did not even bring the drinks (a food runner did), we ordered a bottle of wine and brought out the wrong one, then someone else came back with the correct one and they poured it. When we left the food that we had boxed did not come back, we had to find the food runner to go back and get it.   Not sure I want to deduct from the score too much for the service this time though since the food was so good. With the bottle of wine, tip and drinks for 3 at the bar before hand the bill came to about $250, not too bad for deserts (for 2 of us), coffee afterwards, a bottle of wine, which was $51, 3 drinks and 3 entries.   Food Quality - A-  Service - C+  Atmosphere A  Value A- Overall - B+",

The meat was very tender. \u00a0I took most of this dish home. \u00a0They were out of the port that I wanted and the dessert was disappointing. \u00a0I hate donuts and the dish that was ordered seemed like a fancy donut. \u00a0 Overall this was a good experience but I felt as if the price was high for the meal. \u00a0It might have been the company and the occasion that made it so great. \u00a0I would go back and have the shrimp/grits appetizer if I was going to the Fillmore but would not make the trip if I wasn't in the area.",

The service was extremely professional and the food delicious. If you find yourself in SF for a show or just in the Fillmore neighborhood, I suggest dropping in for a meal -- you won't regret it.",

High ceilings and the open feeling of the restaurant is definitely a plus in a city where space is limited. The decor was modern and hip and the lighting was moody and warm.   There were about 6 of us and we found that even with a larger group, the service was good. Our waitress stopped back frequently to check on us.   Food, however, was not the greatest. It wasn't bad but not particularly above average either. I guess I would dub it as \"so so\". We ate community-style and ordered a bunch of the main courses. There was only one beef dish that I actually thought was good out of the 6. The fried chicken, that people were rating high on Yelp! was kind of a let down in my opinion. It wasn't particularly as crispy as I was hoping.  We, unfortunately, were running behind so couldn't stay and enjoy the bar or the music. Wish I had though. It would have been a more thorough experience.",

My soup was meh, it tasted of just heavy cream and definitely needed more flavor (maybe roasting the cauliflower, \u00a0adding parmesan, nutmeg... something), all I tasted was cream. \u00a0My brussel sprouts were very bland, had some of the husbands which were delicious, but his had bacon in them.

One random comment, out of our 6 person group, 75% completely passed the door because it was too discrete and not obvious...anyways onto the actual restaurant/food.  Went here yesterday with a group of lovely ladies for Dine About Town. The Dine About Town menu that was on the Dine About Town website seemed a lot more heartier than the actual menu that was present at the restaurant. Thus, I did not go with the Dine About Town menu. Instead I went with the special, Carolina Rubbed Full Rack of Baby Back Ribs with Mac/Cheese and Cole slaw.  So I was excited when the ribs came out and it wasn't smothered in BBQ sauce; however, the meat was very dry and very tasteless, definitely needed a lot more rub than was put on it. I've also never had my ribs already individually cut up for me on the plate. The two sauces that it came with, the mustard and the bbq sauce were nice complementary sauces. But the portion of mac and cheese, was the same size as the sauces...what a rip off!  However the Corn bread that comes out was pretty good, or the sauces were. The cornbread was a bit dry and too crumbly. Would've been awesome if it was still warm and more moist. But the jalapeno sauces and honey butter that came with it was quite tasty.  I tried the Fennel/Citrus salad that my friend got as part of the Dine About Town. The ingredients were fresh but a bit too much fennel. She had also mentioned that she was not a big fan of the dressing--too 'mustardy'.  Other friends got the catfish and the scallops. The scallops looked legit, the catfish was such a small portion but I believe she enjoyed it.  For dessert, we tried the bread pudding, and it was quite tasty. The bread pudding was alright and very 'apple cobbler'-tasting. But the ice cream was PHENOMENAL, although they only give you a small scoop, but it was more than enough to share. Their espresso con panna was also pretty good, but I wish it was hotter, it had definitely cooled off by the time they brought it out.  Overall, service was great, ambiance is amazing, and I definitely would like to head back to try some other items on their menu. Sadly, it did not meet my expectations and definitely was pricey for what it was. I think this place would be ideal to have small plates/apps and drinks but not a full on dinner. Or maybe after dinner desserts/drinks. I do want to try out their GOSPEL Brunch one day!  Cool place, but didn't spark my interest as much as I had hoped. Maybe next time...",

    "review_text": "This review is how they handled private events. I don't live in the Bay Area and had to make all arrangements with event coordinator Kyla via email. She is the WORST at communicating in a timely fashion. I would wait and wait for a response. I've had to wait up to a week and half for a response. The only way I got a response from her was if I emailed her again asking her why she hasn't gotten back to me.   So once the day of the event came (my wedding reception) we were greeted by smiling wait staff and Kyla who wasn't particularly the warmest. My guests were filtering in and the ones who were there started to be seated at the table. During this time my new husband and I are we're taking photos in the lounge when Kyla came out to ask us where everyone else was (at this point we were 10 people short and an hour behind schedule) \u00a0we told her they were on there way and Kyla wanted to know an exact time on when they would be here so that the kitchen could start cooking. So right then and there during my photos i had to call the rest of my guests to see where they were.   Through miscommunication neither she or I understood fully what we were trying to convey which resulted in both of us being frustrated with each other. So other than that being a pain in the neck, the food was amazing and I got nothing but compliments from my guests about the food. Just wish the coordinator was better at coordinating and being considerate of her paying customers.",

    "review_text": "i swear i fell into a portal that took me back to the height of the roaring twenties the moment the heavy wooden door shut behind me. \u00a0  as i stepped into the swanky dark interior of the lounge, i was completely blown away by the elegance of the space. \u00a0all the meticulous details from the handsome studded leather furniture, to the wall of back lit black and white photographs of scenes from fillmore's past, to the curious upside down lamps hanging from the ceiling, all melded together to achieve the perfect balance of speakeasy sexiness and jazz era chic. \u00a0i sank into a sleek armchair and wish i had on an outfit to match: a bell shaped hat pulled snugly over bobbed hair, a fur lined collared coat over a slinky low waist dress, a swinging beaded necklace, a long cigarette in one hand, and a shallow, wide mouth champagne glass in the other...   maybe gazing hopelessly into a dapper young gentleman's eyes...  okay, end daydream. \u00a0but here's a hint, dress nice.  i adore the twenties. \u00a0i love scott fitzgerald and the great gatsby, jazz from louie armstrong to duke ellington, art deco, bootleg liquor... (just kidding. or am i?) \u00a0i even watched charlie chaplin shorts growing up. \u00a0and now im starting to think that i may have lived in the twenties in a past life.  anyway.  the food was every bit as amazing as the atmosphere. \u00a0the four of us shared a bunch of appetizers:  complimentary cornbread - homemade triangles of fresh cornbread served warm with red pepper jelly and butter. \u00a0sigh, i love cornbread.  bbq shrimp and creamy grits - the smoky bbq sauce was to die for  warm poached egg salad - a warm cabbage salad that reminded me a little bit of sauerkraut... but in a good way... or maybe its because i just like egg everything...  sauted assorted mushrooms - the mushrooms really shine, we swore we tasted a hint of truffles... and the mascarpone hominy grits were the perfect accompaniment in both taste and texture  spiced fat fries - as delicious as hot, crispy-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside french fries can be \u00a0  mac and white cheddar cheese - my absolute favorite dish of the night! \u00a0i've never had mac n cheese quite like this before... macaroni baked in a gooey white cheddar cheese bechamel sauce with lots and lots of thyme... im not usually a big mac n cheese fan but this... this was insanely good.  we also split two entrees:  maple syrup slow braised pork short ribs - I cant speak to this as I didn't have any, but I can tell you that it looked good and that the \"crispy onion rings\" are actually one singular onion ring  black eye pea cake - like crabcakes but made with black eye peas! \u00a0  we also shared a bottle of the anderson valley pinot noir. \u00a0and the beignets served with coffee soda for dessert.  ... all for $40 per person. \u00a0with $6 sides, appetizers in the $10 range, and entrees all over the $20 range, i would not classify this place as inexpensive. \u00a0so... $40 per person... HOW?!!!! \u00a0we even double checked the receipt, and it was definitely ours. \u00a0amazing!!  service was impeccable. \u00a0our server was knowledgeable, our water glasses were never empty - i noticed the manager refilled our glasses at one point... a very nice touch, the pacing of the food was right on point, plates and dirty silverware were cleared and renewed after each course... i couldn't really ask for more. \u00a0everyone seemed excited to be there and work there, and their energy is contagious.  live jazz to come on friday and saturday nights.  i'm already trying to think of who i can get to go with me next time. \u00a0  preferably sometime very soon. \u00a0  and perhaps in full on flapper outfits.",

And most of the time, those are the places I love to try, because the execution is interesting and different - or is just done perfectly.  So, 1300 on Fillmore...  The only hiccup I had with this place was that it was hard to get a cab back to the Union Square where we staying.  This place was recommended by the concierge of the hotel. And it was the better recommendation we had out of the two reservations we had.  The brunch we had was good, my Spinach and Goat Cheese (your fat girl tip would be to ADD some BACON to that shizz, cause I sure did...) omelette was delicious. The potatoes were spiced heavy, just enough to pack flavor but not to be overwhelming. I tried grits here for the first time off of someone else's plate... I can't say I took to it.  Service was leisurely at the end, but everything was on point throughout. And even though somehow our concierge reservation got cancelled, we were seated upon a few minutes after arrival. The decor is nice, inviting and warm... I'd definitely be interested to come back and try some of their dinner.

I've been hearing about the fried chicken for a while now and wanted to try it.   We met at the bar. What a sexy bar it was. Low lighting with candles. Sexy bar stools. Sexy drinks. Yeah baby. Sexy. I had some type of margarita. Not my normal drink of choice, but it was really really good. We mosied on over to our table. The entire place is just dark and mysterious and yes, you got it. Sexy!   The decor makes you think that you are in someones study. Or maybe cigar room. Big plush button leather couches. Dark carpet and dark curtains. Low lighting. Everything just looks really comfortable. Miss Tiff sure did look comfortable all cuddled up in the corner of that really oversize leather sofa.   Down to the food. We started with a few appetizers. I went for the shrimp and grits. WOW. WONDERFUL. The grits were cooked perfectly. Eugy had the shrimp hushpuppies. They were ok. A bit dry. But I have to say. I'm not happy about the charge for appetizers these days. Our appetizers where the same price as some entrees. That's a little over the top and totally not worth it. Yes, my shrimp and grits were good, but $16 good? No sir. Especially when you know grits are SUPER cheap. Anyways...   3 of us had the fried chicken. I love the way the chicken was prepared and executed, but to be honest, the seasoning was weird and in no way \"southern\". The chicken itself was super tender and juicy. I just didn't care for the breaded seasoned part. The mashed potatoes and greens that came with it were WONDERFUL though.   For dessert, I had the banana cream pie. Again, it was a twist on the southern style. It was delightful! Well made and the presentation was really good.   Overall, it was a good dinner, but spending that kind of money on stuff my grandma can make for less than $30 (and it would taste A LOT better) just didn't settle with me.",
