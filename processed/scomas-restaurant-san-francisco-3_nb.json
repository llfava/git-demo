We sat at the bar while we waited for our table and I couldn't help notice how dirty it was behind the bar. The fronts of the coolers looked disgusting, which are being touched by the bartenders with their bare hands as they're making the drinks. The mirror behind the bar looked like it hadn't been cleaned in six months, with dried splatters and fingerprints all over it. It makes me wonder how clean other areas of the bar and kitchen really are. There's no excuse for that in a place of this caliber. As far as the management, they did nothing to quiet down some unruly people at the table next to us. Loud, drunk, belligerent behavior by a large party of rude, thoughtless guests, ruining the ambiance for all of the other guests in the dining room, is uncalled for. Everyone knew it was going on, including all of the staff, and none of the management said a word to them about it. For the exceptionally high price of dining here, I would expect better.",

Bone-in Cowboy Steak. This was good and even though this place is known for seafood, this steak was good, no A1 needed. Just the Gratin potatoes and bacon-bourbon butter with every bite of steak was enough.   I guess this would be the best restaurant on the wharf so far, but overall it's average.",

It was probably one of the best Crab Louie Salads I have ever had. We also ordered a mixed seafood saute, which was also incredible. It came with some rice and steamed veggies, and just delicious. The best part about Scoma's was how perfectly all the seafood was cooked - especially the scallops!  There was so much food that the 4 of us had some heavy to-go boxes and I had an amazing lunch and dinner the following day. I'm not easily impressed by seafood restaurants but Scoma's definitely gets my stamp of approval.  Major plus -- free valet :)",

I had the crabcakes and the pasta diplomatica, and the rest of the family had the risotto and the lamb with clam chowders. Overall, the food was great. My pasta was light and delicious. The seafood in the pasta was a lot for me to handle, but for the rest of the family the food was adequately portioned.   The quality of food is okay, not super great or amazing. My family thought that compared to price, the food could have been better. But it's a tourist attraction and I don't blame the restaurant for this. But I do have to compliment their chowder and crab cakes. They were very good and after trying out a lot of the chowders in the area, i can say that this was one of the better ones. same goes for the latter.  The service was also very friendly. He was very attentive, kept good conversation, and was very genuine throughout the meal.   However, the one star I took off was due to something that happened towards the end of the meal. It was not directly related to us, but it was a bit distracting in a bad way. Apparently one of the other waiters could not find the tip that was on a table next to us. The guests had already left and the table was already cleaned. He kept looking for it, and asked one of the \"busboys\" if he had taken it. I dont really know what happened but the waiter got pretty angry and kept flipping through the tablecloths. Then he said to the \"busboy\" \" youre not getting paid tonight.\" Maybe I didn't comprehend the full situation, but for him to say that in the middle of where all the guests are that loudly made me frown. He kept saying \"where is my money?\" And the repetition bothered me and the guests around us.   For a restaurant that is supposed to be renowned for its class and service, it was surprising to hear such things.   But our waiter fortunately was very nice til the end and we were generally satisfied. Would not come back because of the price which we just considered a bit overkill, but I would still recommend it to others. Nice restaurant!!",

Water was brought out and I made a complaint to our server that there was food on my water glass. I was then brought another glass and there was food on that one too! If they can't clean their glassware properly, I'm worried if they clean anything else right...  I ordered the shrimp annuzzi and couldn't be more unimpressed, especially for $30. The pasta was drowning in garlic butter and the rice pilaf was extremely dry. I can make better rice from a box of Rice-A-Roni. The shrimp also tasted very fishy...not fresh at all.

They dont take reservations so I thought my dad and I would have to wait a long time for a table because it was a Friday night. When I walked in I liked the old school atmosphere. To my surprise we were able to be seated right away, which made me very happy. We were starving after the 6 hour drive to San Fran.  Our waiter was very professional and nice. We ordered our drinks and the trio appetizer which was shrimp, calamari, and crab cakes. I was already VERY impressed just by the appetizer it was delicious! I could not decide what to order for my entree because everything sounded soo good. I asked the waiters opinion on the 2 options I was stuck on, and he convinced me to go with the lobster ravioli and white mexican prawns. I was not disappointed when I got this dish, it was even better than the first one!  The sauce on the raviolis was creamy but not too rich to the point where you feel sick after you eat it. The prawns were huge and grilled to perfection. Overall this is probably one of the best dinners I've ever had. I was also satisfied with the service, (I cant stand lousy customer service). The only downside were the drinks were expensive but pretty weak (according to my dad) Whenever I come back to San Francisco I will for sure return here to try the other dishes.",

    "review_text": "Service was awful this time. The food and prices were still good, given that we took advantage of Dine About Town. However, our server was ridiculously slow and inattentive. He only appeared maybe 4 times, and that was just to take our orders and drop off food. He never stopped by to check on our meal and how we were doing. There were many 5-10 minute gaps in the meal during which we sat there with empty plates. I watched many parties who were seated after us finish their meals and new parties take their place. Those parties then finished their meals at the SAME TIME as us, even though some of them were also doing DAT! I think that service at Scoma's is usually really good, but we just got a very lackadaisical server. I'm not sure why he was so slow, considering the fact that he can make more money in tips if he can move us quicker! And we weren't the only party in his section that suffered. There was a nice couple behind us who literally sat with their menus, ready to order, for about 15 minutes. They looked so bored...  We arrived at 6:40, were told 45 minute wait. We were called and seated by 7:25, so the accuracy of their wait time was much appreciated. However, we didn't get our food until 7:50, and we didn't get out the door until 9:30!!!! Talk about a slow, leisurely meal.  I'll probably still return, but I hope not to get seated in this guy's section again!  Oh and about the food:  - Crab cakes on watercress salad: Very tasty! I liked how the crab cakes were mostly crab and very little filler. I was able to share generous tastings with everyone else at the table.   I also sampled the lobster bisque (very rich!) and a bit of clam chowder. The complimentary sourdough bread is a great utensil for scooping up every bit of the soup!  - Scallops and linguine: You get 5 medium sized scallops on a bed of slightly too overcooked linguine topped with a large dollop of pesto. This dish was actually very large in size, which pleased me. It didn't have a ton of flavor though, and the scallops seemed slightly overdone. I had to add some pepper. I didn't finish this so I had enough to bring home for leftovers. It tasted pretty good the next day, but I was kind of appalled at how oily the sauce was. Must have been the pesto.  The lamp was slightly overcooked for medium rare, but I enjoyed the Parmesan polenta, caramelized onions, and sauteed spinach that were under it.   My dad said his halibut had been precooked and then reheated. He was VERY displeased with the texture, as the reheating was obvious from the mushy crust of the fish. He also said it was too salty.  - Tiramisu and sourdough bread pudding: Tiramisu was really good. The portion size of both was very generous. I liked the tiramisu a lot, but by then I was stuffed. The sourness of the bread and the sweetness of the bread pudding was a bit too much for me, so I didn't finish it.   The raspberry cheesecake with chocolate crust was SO. GOOD. I should have ordered that instead.  One thing I'll give to Scoma's is that they don't skimp on portion sizes, even for Dine About Town selections. And all the other plates I saw emerging from the kitchen were massive as well!  Corkage is $20.",

I wouldn't have found this place if it wasn't for the recommendation. The average age of the customer is in their old 50's. so it's a older crowd kinda place. I think you'll have more fun eating outside where all the buzz are happening if younger than 50.   This was my 4th meal of the day (it's about 5:00pm at this time), so I only crabbed a half dozen oyster and a cup of clam chowder. For $18.00, you get 6 oysters on your plate. It's definitely not the best oyster I have, but satisfy the craving at that time. The claim chowder is not special at all either; just like any other claim chowder.   Now, on to the service here, it SUCKS. It's an old old restaurant trying to \"pretend\" they're a high class restaurant; trying a little too hard to be an expensive restaurant. The average age of the waiter is around 50 years old too, which suits the average age of the customers. The host; however, were younger (early 20's). They talked and talked and talked among themselves the whole time rather than informing their customers why they had to wait so long for a table. I waited 20 minutes at 4:00pm for a table when more than half of the restaurant is empty.   Tip: Don't come here, no need to come here. It's boring and suffocating in here.

Onto the food! \u00a0For starters, you'll want to grab the infamous hearty man's cioppino. \u00a0It's stewy and hearty so be careful you don't tap out only on the first course. \u00a0With the complimentary bread, it's easy to fill up since the bread goes so well with that tomato soup base. \u00a0If you want to play it safe, split the cioppino with your date. \u00a0The other thing to try is the lobster bisque. \u00a0It's a love or hate thing so if you're not a fan of bisque, then don't get it. \u00a0I'm a fan of both bisque and lobster so it was a great starter for dinner. \u00a0It tastes like I'm sucking out the lobster entrails from it's body/shell/carapace! \u00a0The crab cakes were pretty good but small. \u00a0I wished they were just a tad bit bigger to be satisfying. \u00a0I won't go into detail for the main entrees since the appetizers were pretty good and talking further would ruin the good vibe already built up. \u00a0Only thing I can say is that the entrees are mediocre compared to the appetizers/soup.

Fast forward 15 years, and I can honestly say that it's time for me to move on to another seafood restaurant.  We ordered a Caesar Salad, and the Hearts of Romaine Salad. The Caesar Salad was mediocre at best. I don't think salads are a strong suit there in general, so beware.  For our mains, we ordered the Fettuccine with Smoked Salmon and Shrimp... a total disappointment. I had this dish back in 1999, and at that time, the Salmon was HUGE along with the Shrimps. Over time, the Salmon became small strips, and the Shrimps were non-existent and tiny.  I expected the same kinds of amazing dishes that once wow'd me then, but Scoma's was certainly showing it's age, and times have changed. I was incredibly disappointed with my experience.  The only reason I gave it an extra star was only for the fairly prompt service. Otherwise, as much as I hate to do this, but it only deserves a one-star... \u00a0feel terrible doing it though.",

GD is a more upscale/dressy ambiance and this is suppose to be a bit more on the casual end but just as amazing in terms of food grade. We had a rsvp for 8:30, car serviced dropped us off at 8:25 and upon walking in, we were greeted with a sea of people hovering around where the reception area would be which I thought could use a little bit more organization but besides the point...proceeded to check in for our reservation and then we had to find a space to stand and wait for our names to be called over the intercom til our table was ready which was a good 15 minutes wait so I suggest getting there about 15 minutes prior to your rsvp, maybe more on a busy night (mind you this was a Monday night rsvp). So the seating promptness for a reservation was sub part at best and at this point I was just hoping for the meal to compensate for that and hopefully live up to the hype....IT DID!!!  The lobster bisque was delish. For my main course I went for the night's mixed grill option of 3 different types of uber fresh fish and jumbo shrimps on a bed of roasted vegetables and a hefty serving of mashed potato seasoned to perfection and a smoked salmon romoulade that was just soooo orgasmic. ..yes I said it.. which also paired really well with the bottle of WillaKenzie Estate pinot noir wine we had.  The serving was definitely hefty and filling that I couldn't even finished the rest of my meal. Overall, the meal definitely is worth the hype. Can't say much for the dessert menu as we never made it that far :)",

First, I don't think we (and my wife for sure) were looking for a \"fine dining\" place to eat. \u00a0More of just a good seafood joint. \u00a0When my wife saw the menu and the prices next to them she nearly fell off her chair. \u00a0She was so upset with how expensive it was she literally started crying. \u00a0I; however, was just looking for what I wanted to eat from what looked like a pretty righteous seafood place. \u00a0  This is where I look like a bad husband (but I partially redeem myself later I promise). I ordered the cioppino and the lobster bisque...she was so pissed off she ordered nothing. \u00a0I had little remorse...but I digress...  The whole time while the food was being prepared I was consoling her and assuring her that we were on vacation and we can go out to a nice meal. \u00a0When the food came I split everything I ordered with her (GO ME) and she had nothing to say but positive things about the food (However, when she looks back at this place she still doesn't think it was worth it).   I guess this is the part where I actually review the food (c'mon I had to set the mood). The cioppino was the best I have ever had. \u00a0The broth was very flavorful, but didn't take away from the freshness of the seafood. \u00a0It felt like there was literally pounds of seafood in this dish too. \u00a0The size of each piece of seafood was very impressive - and you can almost justify the price because of that. \u00a0The lobster bisque was great as well.  So yeah, its quite pricey (and crowded), but I would go back there to get the cioppino no questions asked, but I may need to sign the deed of my car over to get it.",

The restaurant was an average looking building, average decor with rickity cheap tables and chairs. Their highly rated lobster bisque was very mediocre with zero traces of real lobster. The calamari had way too much breading for how thinly sliced the actual squid was. The $17 shrimp cocktail with \"jumbo\" shrimp came with 6 average sized shrimp. While their fish was fresh, they made zero effort into cooking a good meal with it. We got the mixed platter with (teeny pieces of) swordfish, salmon and halibut. Each fish tasted exactly the same because it was purely just grilled - no spices, no sauces, just literally plain pieces of fish. It really says something about a seafood restaurant when my favorite thing of the meal was the mashed potatoes. Overall, just a big tourist trap getting you to pay double/triple the price for measly portions of very bland, generic food.  I don't mind shelling out for a good meal but when I spend more than $50 on dinner per person, I expect the quality of the food to match the price tag. I'm assuming most places around Fisherman's Wharf have fresh fish and I'd much rather go a chain like Joe's crab shack or Bubba Gump for a more fun experience at a fraction of the cost.",

I don't know what much else there is to say about Scoma's. \u00a0The seafood was definitely fresh and the portion sizes were pretty generous, but I thought the food was pretty overpriced for what you get. \u00a0Well, the bright side is that they have plenty of tables, so if you have a big group to feed and happen to be around the Fisherman's Wharf area, Scoma's would be good enough to handle that.",

    "review_text": "San Francisco Treat! \u00a0This should be their moniker, not that darn Rice-a-Roni! \u00a0There's not many restaurants that draws both locals and tourists alike. \u00a0My friends invited me to dinner here on a Friday night. \u00a0The valet parking is free, but please remember to tip your valet person as a courtesy. \u00a0This is a \"no reservations\" dining spot, so it pays to show up early, especially on weekends. \u00a0We waited about ten minutes, which gave me time to study their menu posted outside the front door. \u00a0We were led past the bar area to an upper level dining room and seated at a cozy booth. \u00a0I had a clear view of the parked fishing boats that reminded me of childhood PAL salmon fishing trips. \u00a0My dilema was to choose between the Cioppino and the three-course prix fixe menu for $39.95. \u00a0I chose the latter and opted for the following choices:  Appetizer 1) Double Play (1/2 portion of Caesar's salad and 1/2 cup portion of New England Clam Chowder) - Salad was tasty and perfectly seasoned. \u00a0The clam chowder was creamy with small clam chunks. \u00a0Decent, but not my personal best.(<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jqEpBbf_qNfWuz_GBkwCjw?select=YaIZ92bAERpciugYiCw4cA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jqEp\u2026</a>) Entree 2) Grilled Giant Freshwater Prawns with Linguini - Two nicely grilled prawns topping a generous linguini portion mixed with tomato chunks, olive oil, and pesto. \u00a0Liked that the pesto was spooned to one section so I could mix it to my liking. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jqEpBbf_qNfWuz_GBkwCjw?select=_Vs6RqT1KFrtFNMMs-cVFw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jqEp\u2026</a>) Dessert 3) Tiramisu and Bread Pudding - The Tiramisu was rich and creamy and the bread pudding was cleaner tasting and gooey. \u00a0Good contrast in flavors here.  It was a mixed crowd with after-work co-workers, tourist couple and families, and older couples. \u00a0For those who grew up in the City, it's a bit of a Back to the Future experience. \u00a0Our waitress was efficient and friendly and the staff made sure our water glasses were full. \u00a0The valet was extremely nice and parked my vehicle near the entrance. \u00a0Regarding the Cioppino, they also offer a \"Poor Man's\" version where they remove the shells from the crab (it's pricier which goes against my thrifty conscience). \u00a0The cuisine is a nice mix of North Beach and seafood, packaged in a touristy neighborhood. \u00a0The business celebrated a recent 45th anniversary last week and gave an additional $5.00 on the above menu. \u00a0Darn, didn't make it back in time to catch that discount.",

    "review_text": "Having been introduced to Scoma's in 1998 by a SF colleague of mine on my 1st trip to the city, I've made it a point to visit each of the next two times I travelled there. \u00a0On this, my 4th trip to SF I tried several times to get in by using the Open Table link on their Yelp site, but the times were either too late or too early, so I resigned to the fact we wouldn't be going to Scoma's. I found our last full day, a Monday, we had availability so I found a 4:00 time and worked our schedule for the day around it. \u00a0Glad I did. We started at the bar 1st for an early cocktail (it's 6:30 back east where we live!), my wife having a blue cheese stuffed olive martini, and I opted for a glass of Zin. \u00a0My wife raved about the martini and my wine was quite tasty. When we were ready, we were seated at a table with a view of the back dock. Nothing overly scenic, but better than looking at a wall. \u00a0We order a bottle of wine, and while uncorking it the server went over the menu, offering \u00a0her opinions and suggestions. \u00a0We usually share dishes so we can experience more tastes, so we ordered the Lobster Bisque and the Oyster Rockefeller alla Scoma to start. \u00a0 We decided on the Mixed Seafood Grill and the Alaskan Halibut Siciliana for our entr\u00e9e's.  The Bisque was good (I'm not a big bisque fan anyway, so 'good' is a compliment) but the Oysters were out of this world. \u00a0Made me wish I didn't have to share them. Yummy. Then came the entr\u00e9e's; \u00a0Both were delicious. \u00a0The Mixed Grill was plentiful, so much so that my wife couldn't finish it all, but did manage to leave no shrimp or lobster behind. \u00a0My Halibut Siciliana was so flavorful I didn't leave anything behind. Our server (change of shift, seamless) tried to temp us with desert, and he was successful. \u00a0I judge places based on their Tiramisu against my favorite back home (I won't give away the name of that place) and considered whether I wanted to risk souring my overwhelmingly favorable opinion of \u00a0the early evening's dining experience, but decided to go for it. \u00a0He also told us of a Chocolate Torte that wasn't on the menu, so we order that too. \u00a0The Tiramisu exceeded my expectations and the Torte just made it hard to declare a winner, so we called it a tie. What a wonderful dining experience. The food and the service are top notch. So glad we decided to fit this into our schedule. We had some great food during our week in SF, but I think we saved our best experience for last!",

(Get the Liberty Ale.) The restaurant hooked us up with a cup of the chowder and it was definitely one of the best chowders I had. Chunky, thick and cream broth with flavor. The CLAMS were lacking though. I was going to order the Petrale, until I was told it was breaded and fried. The waiter, Andrew (who was awesome), recommended the Halibut. It was bar far the best seafood dish in the Bay Area. BY FAR! Service was great. One big negative: a bit price. $30+ for the halibut.  My boss had the filet mignon. He could've easily cut that steak with a butter knife. Very juicy too. Good job Al Scoma. RIP.",

They make a wide variety of seafood and Italian dishes, but I prefer the Petrale Dore, a Sole fish sauted in a light batter.  Some of the staff, like Joey, my waiter on my most recent visit have been there for decades, so the service is spot on. On of my dining companions didn't know what dish she wanted so described in general that she wanted to eat crab but didn't want a messy, time consuming whole crab. Joey brought her a Dungeness Crab Risotto that she really enjoyed.   On the down side, the wait can be long on weekends and they don't take reservations. They do offer valet parking.

The wait time for a table, the dated interior, and the inferior view are just predictions of your mediocre meal.

I called to make a reservation on our walk over but they were fully booked so they recommended walking in as it looked like they'd be able to accommodate our group of six with a 15 - 20 minute wait. We were pleasantly surprised to find that they actually had a table for us immediately when we walked into the restaurant.   Our server greeted us promptly and got us set up with a round of cocktails that we enjoyed while we decided what to order.   The beau and I shared a mixed green salad to start. For my main I ordered one of their daily catches, broiled (Halibut) and he ordered a bowl of their Clam Chowder. Mine was served with a side of seasoned veggies and a walloping scoop of roasted garlic mashed potatoes. His chowder was jam packed full of fresh clams and the bowl sized portion wasn't too gigantic.   The rest of the table ordered a Wild Caught Salmon entree and a Shrimp &amp; Smoked Salmon Linguine which looked amazing.   Everything was well prepared and I was a big fan of how fresh the fish was!   I don't know that I'd race back to Scoma's any time soon because it does feel a bit touristy (and maybe a little dated -- don't pop in expecting some super innovative gastronomic-hipster menu), but for being on the Wharf you can expect a good fresh meal, attentive servers and a classy ambiance.",

If and when you do come you ABSOLUTELY MUST get the clam chowder because it is quite honestly the BEST I've ever had here in CA. The lobster bisque is also to die for (if I were any less civilized I would have licked the bowl). Their grilled scallops were amazing, fresh, and cooked to perfection. Personally I'm a sucker for cioppino and the one here is super tasty and loaded with seafood. Fish here is cooked perfectly - flaky and fresh (can't really go wrong with any fish you order). The seafood pastas here are enough to feed 2 comfortably and they are def not stingy on the seafood. Another must get is the calamari (they have spicy or regular) - so GOOD!! Perfectly crispy/seasoned on the outside and tender on the inside. \u00a0  Cons:  - Possible long wait times for tables  - On the pricey side (BUT totally worth the splurge - trust me!)

I love scallops but this reminds me of a pasta dish that olive garden can make. I wasn't impressed, it was very bland.   As for my dessert, I didn't care for it.  Everyone gets served bread with butter.   I felt like I waited long for mediocre food. Everything on yelp loves this place but the seafood didn't blow me away. It reminds me of a food from a chain restaurant. Parking can be difficult here. There's valet parking as an option though.",

The filet was served with sides, hearty portions and a great sear. \u00a0The desserts were good, I especially enjoyed my tiramisu, fluffy and strong espresso flavor. \u00a0 \u00a0  It was a fun meal hosting out of town guests, but I wouldn't put myself through the ringer to eat here on a regular basis.",

    "review_text": "Father's Day 2014... \u00a0My wife and daughters brought me to Scoma's Restaurant because they thought I am the coolest Dad in the world, beating the likes of Cliff Huxtable, Tim Taylor, and Al Bundy. \u00a0I know they are just being kind because that distinction belongs to the one and only Homer Jay Simpson. \u00a0I probably am a distant second, but I don't mind taking a backseat to one S-M-R-T man.  For our dinner, we ordered a bowl of Scoma's Famous Clam Chowder, Calamari Fritti, the Prix Fixe Dinner, and the much heralded Lazy Man's Cioppino.  Scoma's Famous Clam Chowder is one of the better clam chowders not served in a sourdough bread. \u00a0It is the creamy kind with plenty of chopped up clams. \u00a0The Calamari Fritti was tender with a well-seasoned and crusty exterior. \u00a0The Prix Fixe Dinner consisted of Lobster Bisque with Lobster Salad and Chive Aioli as the appetizer, Calico Scallops and Fettuccini as the entr\u00e9e, and Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream as the dessert. \u00a0The appetizer was good but very minimal. \u00a0My daughter seemed to enjoy the entr\u00e9e which had sun-dried tomato and cream. \u00a0Everybody shared the dessert in a hurry to prevent the warm brownie from melting the ice cream. \u00a0The contrast in temperature made this so enjoyable.  Saving the best for the last, I have to give them props for their Lazy Man's Cioppino. \u00a0From the freshness of the ingredients to the taste of the broth, this has been the best of all the cioppinos we have tried. \u00a0This is a notch above my favorite at Woodhouse Fish Co. and I will pick this over Sotto Mare's self-proclaimed \"Best Damn Crab Cioppino\" any day. \u00a0Cioppino's at Jefferson St. has their lazy man's version as well but it is definitely not in the same class. \u00a0I have also recently tried the cioppino at Sam's Chowder House at Half Moon Bay, Vivolo's Chowder House at Pacific Grove, and Brophy Brothers at Santa Barbara and none of them came close. \u00a0I have yet to try Tadich Grill, Anchor Oyster Bar, or Crab House at Pier 39 so I will have to update this \u00a0when I get the chance to try theirs.  Dining at Scoma's can be costly but it is well worth the price especially when celebrating a special occasion. \u00a0This is worthy of a 5-star rating but I had to take away a star because they have that \"controversial\" 4% surcharge that some of the San Francisco restaurants collect supposedly for the health and welfare of their staff. \u00a0I think we have paid more than enough for the food, the tax, the tip, and even the to-go container that we don't want to see anymore surcharges on our bill. \u00a0Other than that, everything else went very well...",

First just know that if you decide to come here, be prepared to wait. There's no way around it. They don't take reservations, so just get your name on the list and grab a few drinks at the bar or walk around while you wait. They overestimated our wait time, lucky for us, but it was still about an hour around 8 or 9pm on a Friday.   Our waiter, Sal, was great. He must also be an old-timer because we noticed more regular customers chatting him up, and he was great in pacing our meal really well, providing helpful recommendations for food, and all around just making sure we were having a good time.   Food... Yeah seafood is the way to go. I have no comments on the red meat here because frankly I don't see why you'd want that at a seafood place on the pier. The chowder is pretty tasty, and it's more creamy than it is full of large seafood bits. The warm appetizer trio had good calamari and crab cakes. The shrimp was fine too but not super amazing. The swordfish fagioli is a solid dish - also has some pancetta and leafy greens. I loved my seafood mix saut\u00e9 plate, which was not only HUGE but very tasty, tons of large crabmeat pieces, 2 1/2 lobster tails, about 4 large scallops and at least 2 or 3 shrimp on top of a bed of rice + pasta (not sure why there was both) plus lots of veggies. I could only finish about 1/2. Seared tuna is also a good choice.   Overall, a great dining experience. The wait was long, but worth a good time had by all.",

    "review_text": "Scoma's may have been known for seafood, views, and service in 1965, but it's been completely outdone by a plethora of restaurants in SF since then. My girl friends and I came for Dine About Town a few days ago because $35.95 for a three-course dinner seemed like a steal in light of entrees costing that much alone here.   I chose the dungeness crab cakes, the lamb T-bones with parmesan polenta, and the pumpkin cheesecake. Nothing was bad, but everything was bland. For example, the crab cakes could have benefited from a curry or garlic aioli; the lamb would have been tastier with a balsamic vinegar glaze; the cheesecake should have had a thicker graham cracker crust. Dinner didn't appear to be a deal after I tasted the food.  I was also peeved that the host promised us a 40-minute wait (Scoma's doesn't take reservations), which actually turned into a 1-hour 10-minute wait. It's always better to estimate liberally. If I knew we had to wait that long, I would've just dined at another restaurant.   The view IS easy on the eyes, though. \u00a0  Scoma's is yet another old, semi-stuffy restaurant that makes you wonder how it's still surviving and thriving in a city with over 4,500 restaurants, many of them serving delicious food at reasonable prices. How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop? Nobody knows.",

My friend ordered an appetizer sampler from the regular menu. i tried not to eat too much since we both had the pre fix.  For my pre fix meal I had  clam chowder - heaping amounts of clams in it, definitely fresh. tasty.   pasta - I forgot what exactly it was called but it was linguini with fresh mussels and salmon. Boy they do not skimp on the amount of seafood they give you! Really really tasty but I was barely able to finish half.   chocolate cake - too rich for me and I just don't like chocolate (I know, I know. What girl DOESN'T like chocolate!?!? Yea yea, well THIS ONE does not like chocolate so live with it)  My friend had the salad that had a mountain of crab meat and shrimp on it.

The lines are usually long, this is a very busy and successful restaurant make sure to make the reservation, don't drop in.  3.) Recommendation that should be your last meal on earth; Pasta Pomodoro with PRAWNS, its about 31.00 but I comment on the following;  a.) the prawns are huge, fresh, and plenty b.) the noodles and mix of cheese and pesto is amazing c.) The sauce is to die for, what you find yourself doing is searching for bread on the table to clean up every last drop of the amazing, attractive, red tomato Poodoro sauce. \u00a0You will look like a drug phene completely high on Tomato Sauce.

Very old-school waiter in dress and manner provided exquisite service, especially for such a casual place. And I thought the place would be over-run by tourists.

Great public transportation nearby, including the classic, antique streetcars that go to the Ferry Building.

After a morning of playing tourist, my fiance and I wanted to stop to get some lunch. We were at the Wharf so we were obviously craving clam chowder but wanted an actual sit down place.  Upon walking in, I noticed the servers with the white jackets and immediately thought that this would be hoighty toighty place that would judge me for just ordering a beer and bowl of chowder. However, this did not happen. Our waiter was super friendly and made some small talk with us. The busboys made sure we had plenty of water and we generally felt very welcome here.   As far as the m... my Stella was ice cold and my chowder was delicious so I was a happy girl. I really liked that my chowder was heavy on the clams and lighter on the potatoes. We also got half of a giant roll of sourdough bread in our bread basket so that was perfect for dipping... no breadbowl needed here. I was also intrigued by some of their other seafood chowders which I will have to try if I make my way to Scoma's again. eal",

The service was slow, expect to wait at least thirty minutes before you even get a glass of hydrogen hydroxide to consume after taking a seat.  We've basically ordered food for everyone at the group to try, the steak was meh - not the best steak when compared to Les Halles New York or even Bouchon Las Vegas. It was flavorless meat - hardly any substance or actual enjoyment to it.  I had lobster - and I'm really not that impressed. I believe it was overcooked - dry, and overpowering with seasonings. The crab stuff mushroom was not the best either.  The vegetables were bland, and the rice was dry and overcooked. I know what rice tastes like - as I tend to eat it everyday, and their rice is a place I would expect from something of a fast casual restaurant, not here.  Maybe it's because I'm a native of Seattle Seafood, or that I cook seafood myself - but I'm really not pleased with this restaurant and it's service and the quality of the food that was served given the prices listed.

I know it was busy, but it took nearly 25 minutes for the waiter to finally get down our order. Now onto the food:  Appetizer: Lobster Bisque - This bisque was delicious and packed a lot of flavor without being too much. I've had lots of bisques in the past that were very salty, but this was a good balance. It also had a bit of a spicy kick at the end of every bite.  Clam Chowder - This was not your typical clam chowder to say the least... I personally felt it lacked flavor. My friend described it as chicken noodle soup-esque and I have to agree. It was a bland chicken noodle soup with cream and clams instead of chicken.  Entrees: Seared Scallops over Linguine - I only had a taste of the scallops, so I can't comment on the pasta. The scallops were nicely cooked, had a good texture but it lacked the sweetness that I usually expect from them.  Lamb T-Bones - This was definitely the highlight of the evening for me. I asked for my lamb to be medium rare, and out come 3 good looking pieces of lamb. One of the pieces was a perfect medium, while the other 2 were perfect medium-rares - weird. it was seasoned well and the lamb was soft and amazing. the juices of the lamb seeped into the spinach and that was incredible as well.  Dessert: Tiramasu and Sourdough Breading Pudding - I love bread pudding, but I'm probably not going to order a sourdough one again. The raisins tasted sour after the caramel on top of the sourdough. That's just too much sour for me in a bread pudding. The tiramasu was great though. The coffee flavor had a little, but just enough sweetness to make this good for a fan of bittersweet things.  tl;dr - the wait was long, the portions are huge, would only come back for the bisque and lamb",

You see my dad passed away in the 80's and this place is still around.   Crab cocktail was our starter dish and it was right up there as the freshest crab I've eaten.  The dish we were told to order that my dad always loved was the Cioppino or as the bill says One Lazy Cioppino. It is a fisherman's stew of many fish, scallops, shrimps, crab, clams and mussels with a tomato base. It is thick and full of flavor. We split it between us and still have left overs for a few hours later while at Alcatraz.   Classy place with a blend of young folks and blue hairs alike. Go check it out if you are at the Wharf.",

Also note where the god damn restaurant is. It's in a narrow alley behind a bunch of tourist shops for godsakes. It's not supposed to be super uppity. It might as well be a gathering place for old fishermen who enjoy the finer things in life, so if you're super trendy be wary!   However, diners should also note that it has nice white table cloths and equally shiny and white plates. It's somewhere in between fine and casual but definitely San Franciscan. But hey, I'm not stupid enough to go on a weekend night.  Now down to business. My first experience and best experience was with the cioppino. Good Lord, it had so much seafood, they really don't skimp. I've had a lot of cioppino and this one takes the cake. Fish in every bite. And incredibly fresh (except maybe for the baby Alaskan shrimp, but hey shrimp in every bite) The individual pieces of \u00a0petrale, mussels, clams, and prawns weren't overcooked at all. Which means the cooks know when to put the fish in. \u00a0It's not just tossed into the broth. Heavenly, broth I might add. And it's all served with a delicious and I mean delicious buttery piece of toast.  But the best thing is Scoma's doesn't pretend to be something it's not. It's behind the tourist shops. Down a smelly little alley. It's San Francisco and it's how they cook there seafood. And if you want your fish served in fusion cuisine contorted into a roll slathered with mayo in a more \"hip\" environment--well there's those kinds of places in the 7mile by 7 mile city too. Just not here.   So yes, the service might be a little slow. But your server more likely than has been there for 20+ years. Have mercy and just enjoy your fish.",

Very clean restaurant, narrow walking space but it's kinda big.   Large seafood menu and there's a giant wine selection.   The servers are really nice. When you order crab, they also put on bibs for you.  Come here for the clam chowder! It's amazing! Not too creamy or too watery. I was going to take a picture of it but I ended up just eating the whole thing. They chop up the clams, potatoes, and celery into small pieces so with every spoonful you get like a mouthful of everything. There was other ingredients in there too but I was way too hungry to observe. You can tell everything is fresh and didn't just plop it out of a can. I got the bowl for $10 which they do give a large portion. They have the cup for $9 but there's a total size difference. So I would recommend to just get the bowl, it's much more worth it since they give you much more.  We also got two orders of the dungeness crab, which tasted alright. It wasn't anything special, but it tasted fresh and that's always good in my book.  Every thing arrived pretty fast, we didn't wait too long which was good. But then again, I guess it depends on the day.  I would have to come back here in the future to try other seafood dishes.  But yes, come for the clam chowder and you'll be happy you did!",

    "review_text": "Went here Sunday night for DAT. People aren't kidding about the long wait! We had to bum around for an hour or so before our seats were called, so definitely think about the waiting time if you want to dine here.  Once called, we were seated in a comfy booth and introduced to our waiter, Chris. Honestly, Chris is one of the reasons I'm a fan of this place- he has a friendly, grandfatherly air and will always keep you up-to-date on the status of your food &amp; service. He even managed to help us substitute a DAT entree (this is HUGE) for one of my vegetarian friends.  But anyways, the food. Like most restaurants, Scoma gave us a basket of bread &amp; breadsticks. I wasn't a huge fan of the bread, since I've never liked sourdough, but I guess that's more of an industrywide thing, so nothing you can do.  For the appetizer/\"first\" course, my friend Alan &amp; I ordered the lobster bisque. As expected, it was very rich &amp; creamy, though a tad salty, in my opinion. My friend's clam chowder, on the other hand, was delicious! Typically, I don't like clam chowder, but this was an exception! Although that might be because the clam chowder reminded me of a creamier version of chicken noodle soup. As Alan pointed out, the chowder wasn't very \"clam-y\", even though there WERE chunks of clam floating about the vegetables. Regardless, I loved it.  For the second course, I ordered scallops and linguini pomodora. The linguini was all right, not stellar, but the scallops more than made up for that. They were buttery and delicious, with a slight bit of crispiness. Ahh, so good! About halfway through the second entree, I felt completely stuffed and had to stop eating. Perhaps it was the clam chowder I consumed, or perhaps it was the generous portions we were given- either way, I literally had to get up and walk around the restaurant before I could go back and eat.  I also tried a bite of Alan's lamb chops, which were delicious &amp; savory. Funny enough, the spinach was also completely infused with a smoky, lamb flavor, which really made the dish unique.  We finished up the meal with various desserts. I got the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake, which was less cheesy than the usual cheesecake I was accustomed too, but delicious nonetheless. I especially loved the bottom layer of the cheesecake, which was a chocolately crumble with a hint of mint. Mm!  My only complaint: there was a waitress (Irene), who had a completely DGAF mindset. While pouring water or grinding pepper, she spilled half of what she was doing, didn't seem to notice, and just went along her way. A bit annoying, especially when some sauces from dishes she was sweeping off the table dripped onto my Android. Sigh.  But the bottomline- this was a delicious restaurant that I would love to come back and try again! Especially the desserts. I'm still unsure whether or not the dinner was really worth $40, so the jury's still out on the success of this DAT meal.",

I was afraid the food and service might have declined as locals often refer to Scoma's as a place for grandparents and tourists. Not so! The food and service were excellent! We came at 5:30 pm, the time of our reservation and had our table of four until the place was nearly closed. Staff understood that I was having a \"reunion\" with a friend I had not seen since graduating girl's school 40 years ago. So they just let us and our families feel right at home without trying to push us out of our table to accommodate another set of diners.Surprising ,since the place was packed that night. One other notable aspect of service: the waitpersons are trained in proper wine service which includes wine pairing, presentation, opening and pouring...and by wine pairing I mean not only pairing to the food but also to what they perceive as your price point without asking. Our server got it all correct. I am a Court of Master Sommeliers (Level 2) Certified Sommelier and am Advanced Certified by WSET (Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust). I am so tired of going out to dine in San Francisco and watching servers who know nothing about wine or wine service try to upsell me on wine...and then botching service Thanks, Scoma's and Mathew (our server) for getting it right!

San Francisco is full of too many great places for me to keep visiting simply for the nostalgia of what this place used to be.   First, I'd agree with other reviewers that this isn't a modern fine-dining establishment. The d\u00e9cor is definitely a throwback to old-school seafood restaurants, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing in my opinion. Lots of wood paneling and memorabilia on the walls. Tourists used to look in, see the prices and fancy clothes and turn around to head back to Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., but those days are long gone. There were plenty of people in camouflage cargo shorts waltzing in. That might be more a statement about society than the restaurant, but there it is. Sorry if you like camouflage pants or Bubba Gump.   The service has always been a high point at Scoma's. Tonight was no exception. The wait staff was very attentive and helpful. The only minor blemish for gluten-free diners: tonight was our first visit after my wife had to adopt a gluten-free diet regimen. We looked ahead to ensure there were good options on the menu (there were) but our waiter wasn't very knowledgeable about the different options. Some of the menu items that would normally be gluten-free (even simple grilled fish) didn't carry that designation, which was confusing. Just something to consider for those with a dietary restriction.   The food was ultimately the reason for the low score in my book. We started with the highly vaunted lobster bisque. It barely even tasted like lobster, much less contained any - it was more tomato bisque than anything. I've had better store-bought.   With entr\u00e9es, I went with cioppino while my wife chose crab risotto. The seafood part of my cioppino was pretty good - a little squid-heavy for my taste and with decidedly non-traditional lump crab (is that why it's \"lazy\" cioppino?), but overall it's good and there's plenty of it. The problem was the tomato sauce. It tasted like a cross of canned spaghetti sauce and tomato soup poured over the seafood - bland and weirdly thick, not the spicy, wine and tomato-y broth that usually comes with the dish. Just plain weird.   The risotto was even worse. First, they used long-grain rice, not Arborio or another short-grain rice. I'm no food snob but it looked like they dumped Minute rice onto the plate. It didn't look edible, much less appetizing. Second, there were random peas, mushrooms and tomatoes throughout (none of which was mentioned on the menu). Risotto should be rich, creamy and flavorful. This was none of those.",

We got some drinks; chatted it up; and before I was half-way done with my beer we were called to a table and seated.   We started the meal off with the crab cakes and fried calamari appetizers and they were good, but not great. I ordered the \"Lazy Man's\" Cioppino (LMC) and my wife got the Smoked Salmon Linguini. The LMC had a hefty price tag of $40 but it was worth every penny. The bowl came loaded with shrimp, fish, clams and scallops! It must've been a 80-20 ratio of seafood to sauce and I was afraid it was going to be the other way around. I did partake of my wife's Smoked Salmon Linguini and it, too, was terrific. The other two gentleman in our party got steaks- which I thought was going to be a mistake since I'd personally never order beef at a seafood joint, but if you want a steak you want a steak. They both said they were great and would order it again given the chance.   Our server, John, was great at making recommendations; answered all our questions and was very attentive (but not too attentive; you know what I'm saying).   The price tag was a little hefty, but well worth it. I can't wait to visit Pier 39 again so I can dine here again.",

    "review_text": "I took my first vacation in a long time to San Francisco, and my girlfriend and I ate here for our first night in town. After the meal, I had to actively check to make sure that my plane had not fallen out of the sky, crashed into a hillside, and killed everyone on board; after eating here, I thought I had died and gone to food heaven.  We arrived around 7:00 pm on a Saturday night, and the place was packed to the rafters. However, in spite of that, we were seated promptly (inside of 5 minutes). Our waitress was attentive and came to the table frequently, but not so often that it became creepy. Refills on drinks came quickly; we never ran dry at the table.  For our appetizers, my girlfriend ordered a Caesar salad, while I ordered the \"world's-best\" clam chowder. The salad was prepared and dressed perfectly, with the lemon in the dressing giving the salad that one last missing element. To me, this is one sign of a stellar restaurant - take the classics, maybe put a small spin on them, and execute them flawlessly. As for my chowder, I am always skeptical when something is advertised as the \"world's best,\" but this particular dish did not disappoint. This chowder was as good or better than any I'd ever had on the East Coast, and was delicious from the first spoonful to the last.  Our entrees came out shortly thereafter, and they did not disappoint either. My girlfriend got the salmon, while I ordered the Yellowfin Tuna. First of all, both fish were cooked perfectly, but what blew me away were the portion sizes. Both my girlfriend and myself received huge portions of fish, to the point where we both stuffed ourselves stupid in order to eat them. Sadly, we saved no room for dessert.  The only drawback of this meal would be the price; it was rather expensive ($60 per person, including tip). However, I didn't have a problem with that price, as the food my girlfriend and I received was worth every penny.  My meal at Scoma's was one of the best meals I have ever had. The food was fantastic, the service was excellent, and while the price was high, I didn't mind paying extra for such quality. If you are a fan of seafood, this place should be on your list of must-visits when you visit Fisherman's Wharf.",

Since there are so many reviews, I'll keep this short; unless you have a particular fish or seafood that you love (salmon, shrimp, etc.) you should go with the more mixture based dishes like the Shellfish Saute or the Cioppino- both absolutely delicious and top notch quality.  The good: You can really go to Scoma's in jeans and a dress shirt and you'll blend right in with the tourists. Servers are all nicely clad in ties and crisp white shirts, and everything from the fresh sourdough to the ocean smelling seafood is absolutely worth the higher price.  The bad: It's a long wait with no reservations taken, so get there early! Also, the desserts are meh but that's ok because they're not the main attraction.  Ambiance: Comfortable Italian restaurant. The focus is the food!  What to know: this is a place tourists are aware of, so beware going for dinner on weekend nights! If you're lucky enough to grab a table by the bar, you can munch on appetizers or enjoy some drinks to survive the wait.  Good for: family, friends, and out of towners.   In short: Scoma's serves super fresh and tasty sea food for a slightly hefty but very worth it place. One of my go to's for bay area vacations!",

The wait staff is very curtious and professional and a poster child for how a waiter should look and behave. My husband collects pint glasses and asked the waiter how he can get a glass with their name on it. The waiter said that he will see what he can do and gave him the glass for free.

The waiter came by, looked at our indecisive faces and told us what we were gong to eat. It wasn't a reccomendation... he told us what we were going to eat. Obviously taken back by it, my uncle who is a repeat customer indicated that this is normal (I still think that's a lie) and that we'd enjoy the meal or he would foot the bill. Damned if it wasn't the best seafood pasta i'd ever eaten. The quality of food was fresh and top notch. The restaurant is very busy, so reservations are a must and I would recommend nicer attire.

I've lived in the area for more than four years so I know the kinds of good fancy seafood that I like, but the food here was nowhere near the standards.   Also, I asked for the bill after making it CLEAR that we weren't getting dessert, but the waiter nevertheless brought the dessert menu INSTEAD OF the bill. Then he asks us if we were getting coffee. Thinking that what he brought us was the bill, it totally looked as if the coffee was complimentary and as if he was apologizing for the 2 hour wait we had to go through after being told that the wait would be only 45 minutes -- so we asked for coffee. Seconds later we realized to our dismay that we didn't get the bill from him yet, and the coffee was going to be charged on the bill, so I actually had to walk up to our waiter to cancel the order for coffee. How not classy...... We all felt like we were tricked into paying more.. it may have been his small mistake of the day but there's only so much you can tolerate after being ripped off in terms of time and money.  In sum, if I ask for the bill and say no to the dessert menu then I want the bill, not the dessert menu. Give me what I ask for and don't give me what I clearly and loudly refused.",

Not much - if anything - \u00a0has been done to the decor in the past twenty years, but you come here for the food, not the ambiance. Think seafood with an Italian flair. For starters, share an order of calamari Calabrese-style, fried in a spicy tomato and red pepper sauce with mushrooms, and Dungeness crab cakes, prepared with a minimal amount of breading and served with a zesty remoulade. Pasta orders are huge and best shared, unless you intend one as your main course. Among my favorites is smoked salmon, rock shrimp, and red onion in a dill-cream sauce on a bed of fettucine. If they're in season, order the sand dabs, lightly grilled and served with lemon butter. The cioppino is sensational. Most entrees include fresh vegetables. Sauteed dishes are served with rice, while broiled or grilled dishes are served with pasta. Prices are very high, but portions are so overwhelmingly large that you'll be toting home enough for a second meal. As much as I'd like to award it a full five stars, their aggravating no-reservation policy means a very long wait to be seated, no matter the time of day, and the place is always so crowded, service can be brusque, out of necessity more than intention. Still, this is the best reason to come to the area, and the one place I always take out-of-town guests.

We finally were able to make the trip here this weekend for my our 4 year anniversary. Hehe. :) We came here for lunch after an Alcatraz tour. I like how the restaurant is located away from all the craziness on Jefferson St. Makes the dining experience a bit more relaxing.   My boyfriend ordered the cracked whole Dungeness crab, clam chowder and a Cesar salad. I ordered the lobster ravioli. Lobster ravioli was delicious. Even though there were only about 7 pieces of ravioli, they were about twice the size of other raviolis at other restaurants. It was creamy, not too heavy and even came with a piece of the lobster tail. At first, I thought it was just for decorations, but the tail still had delicious and fresh meat attached to it. The clam chowder and Cesar salad were also very delicious and flavorful. Definitely not your usual soup and salad that tastes like it was just thrown together with not much effort in making it different. I wish I had good taste buds to be able to pick out what made it different. But just know that I think you won't be disappointed! I think the best part of this meal though, is the crab! It was a good size crab, served chilled and had so much meat in it! It seemed like my boyfriend kept pulling good size pieces of meat out of each leg. I love crab and have always had it at Chinese restaurants. Those crabs don't compare to this one! Didn't even need to add any sauces or lemons.   Service was also great. Very attentive, friendly and quick, but we did eat at a slower time. However, I definitely will come here again the next time I'm in town.

The clam chowder my mom ordered was really good borderline great. By far the best thing I had tonight. The other good dish was the cioppino. Tasty but I have had just as good elsewhere for less money.  This is where the good news ends for the food. I started with the lobster bisque myself and it was bland. Edible but for 10$ a cup I had higher expectations. The entree I ordered, which the waiter assured me was very good, was the prawns and scallop alla Gannon. I absolutely hated this dish. In fact I found it insulting. It came out looking like someone just threw it together. There is zero creativity in this dish and the only flavor is garlic. The vegetables looked and tasted like they were reheated frozen from a bag. The mashed potatoes, garlic of course, were like glue and there was a pile of rice under the whole mess. The \"stars\" of the dish should have been the scallops and the shrimp. While the scallops were cooked decently they had been overpowered with garlic and butter. The shrimp were overcooked and tough. For this I paid 38$?!?! \u00a0I expect this quality from a cheap chain restaurant and know for a fact I could cook better than this at home which is where I should have stayed. As for the place itself The location is fine but the decor is outdated and crowded the waiter was friendly enough but rather inattentive. I do not think I have had a more disappointing restaurant experience in my \u00a0whole life. My suggestion is try the chowder and hit the road or skip it altogether and spend your hard earned money on one of the other myriads of dining establishments that have not fallen asleep at the wheel.",

As typical, ordered a variety of dishes. \u00a03 ordered the pasta diplomatica, a couple of crab cakes, a cippiono, and I had the lamb. \u00a0They have \"Dine about town\" special for $35 that includes an appetizer, entree and dessert. \u00a0Considering most entrees are $30-$35, that's a great value.  The food, especially the seafood was good. \u00a0Portions are large and the service outstanding. \u00a0Water glasses are always full. \u00a0Waitress cut and served our birthday cake for us. \u00a0Its expensive, but you expect that. \u00a0Still, a solid choice for a special occasion dinner after all the years.",

OK..then, I stepped aside and waited. 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 30, 35, 47 minutes later, I got my table. Then, I asked her, \"what happened to my 6:15 on the dot table ready comment? And she said, \"it happens...\" So much for a great impression.  Sat down at the table and waited by a server promptly and he said something about the specials which I didn't hear very well. Anyways, ordered the food, waited for about 10 minutes, food came. The only thing that's worth mentioning is their famous Lazy Man's Cioppino..not because it's so fabulous, IT WAS HORRIBLE !!! They got their name right, so damn LAZY ! They don't even bother cooking the tomato sauce properly. To me, it was just a bottle of Prego dumped into the pot, stirred a little (please note that the sauce was not even hot, it was....luke warm), then, throw in the seafood. \u00a0Unless you're up for some \"..a-little-better-than-microwave-tv-dinner..\" type of food with HIGH price. GO TO SCOMA'S ! The rest of the food, cod, seafood platter, clam chowder and fried oysters, go to Red Lobster or Sizzler instead...  The only reason why I give 1 star is because of the view.

Granted, I've been twice and didn't pay either time but it was still really good, some of the best cooked seafood I've ever had. Service is a bit slow but this is the kind of place you want to have a long meal at anyway. This was apparently my grandmother's favorite restaurant back in the day and I can see why.  The Oysters Rockefeller are amazingggg. I normally don't love this dish as much as I do here. So, so tasty. Crab stuffed mushroom is also a favorite.  The first time I came here I had the Alaskan Halibut Siciliana, which was perfectly cooked and so flavorful.   The second time had the Mixed Shellfish Sautee and Oh my goodness was that amazing. It comes with prawns, scallops, crab meat and lobster - ridiculous amounts and again cooked perfectly. Well worth the price. This dish was huge and delicious.   I've also tried (through people that I was eating with) the Lobster Ravioli, Prawns and Scallops Alla Gannon and the steamed clams platter. Not to be repetitive but all were amazing as well.   Pro tip: go later if you can, at ~9:30 pm. They don't take reservations and for obvious reasons this place is crazy popular but by this time it seems like there's not really a wait.

We chose the restaurant based on Yelp reviews and boy were we happy with our research results! The pacific oysters were INSANE! So incredibly fresh and delicious! Best oysters I've ever had! Decadent Swordfish Con Fagioli and wine! The service was fantastic even though we weren't dressed up. I felt like we fit in. We wanted to stay and sit a while because the atmosphere was so comfortable.

I was so grateful that I opted for a bowl rather than a cup because I would have been super sad with a smaller serving. The delicious broth was filled with large, tender pieces of clam. I've never had another clam chowder like it. I don't think I ever will, unless I'm back at Scoma's.  Man cannot live on chowder alone so we also ordered an appetizer that consisted of shrimp dusted in cornmeal and lightly fried. Pretty good, definitely fresh, but not up there with the chowder.   The restaurant is definitely on the hilarious side of outdated but I think they are looking to retain some of their old school charm, and that's fine by me. Since I'm not sure if anything else could live up to the chowder I might just keep this spot as a light lunch destination while in San Francisco.",

Nestled in a little back lot off of Al Scoma Way, this place can be tricky to spot if you're not paying attention. If you do drive there, the parking is strictly valet unless you park on the street.   The decor gives off almost a boathouse type of vibe. Depending on where you're sitting you can catch small glimpses of the city or the bay. The service here is excellent, they are friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and very attentive.  I highly recommend the Spice Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Cake as a starter. Cooked to perfection with just the right amount of crisp, you catch both the salmon and shrimp flavors with each bite. For an entree I recommend the Scoma's Shellfish Saute which is an assortment of shellfish (2 Lobster Tails, Jumbo Prawns, Large Scallops, \u00a0and Dungeness Crab meat) served over penne pasta, rice pilaf and a vegetable medley in a buttery wine sauce. This is the epitome of perfection. Each savory bite is filled with sweet decadent flavors of the shellfish. Whenever we dine here I can never bring myself to order anything else. The Saute is a winner and worth every penny.  Whether you consider this a touristy spot or not, it's definitely a must if you're craving fresh, delicious seafood. It's a bit on the pricier side so I wouldn't say this is a go to every time you're in the area but it's definitely a great spot for a nice intimate dinner or special occasions.",

We get it steamed plain (you can get garlic steamed or something too) and it is served with warm drawn butter. I usually don't use butter with my crab but I did this time and it was QUITE delicious!! Half of the crab was cracked so it made it VERY easy to eat and the other half wasn't for some reason... I would have given FIVE stars if it had been.

Indeed! \u00a0The cioppino was delicious. \u00a0The broth was flavorful and the tomato wasn't overpowering, masking the freshness (and saltiness) of the seafood.  I enjoyed the cioppino here because it's \"lazy man's\" cioppino, meaning that there was absolutely no hands on work. \u00a0No cracking open crab shells, no pulling shrimps out by the tails.   The service was friendly and the water glasses were constantly refilled. \u00a0The wait was definitely long for a Sunday night, but we wouldn't expect anything less from this touristy place!   We also had their rich and creamy lobster bisque - very tasty as well. \u00a0Actually, I prefer the lobster bisque over the cioppino simply because I enjoy creamier soups!",

Like pretty much every seafood place across this great nation, the decor is outdated (wood paneling ) the silverware started out formal but has been run through the dishwasher one to any times. And the food options are more originals and old fashion as opposed to more modern cuisine.  With that being said some things don't go out of style and fresh seafood cooked well never does.   I had the scallops in saffron cream sauce. These little puppies were delightful. Nice crispy on the outside with a perfectly grilled crust, moist and juicy on the inside. Some of the best I have ever had.   My wife had the local caught salmon. Man oh man could I have eaten this everyday. The salmon is so stinking good I would call you crazy to order something else.   Ordered the fresh \u00a0caught salmon.   Order the fresh caught calamari. Boom best app  Clam chowder...enough said. \u00a0Thank me later",

However, when I tried the lobster bisque here, it didn't have that strong taste of bitterness. I'm a fan! (4/5)  As for our entrees, we ordered:  Swordfish: Everything about the fish was perfect. The meat was moist, soft, and fresh! The penne pasta that came with it was great too. Only thing we didn't like was the capers. You can request to have them taken off. (5/5)  Lobster Ravioli: A TOTAL MUST! It's served with saffron sauce! The ravioli itself is large and pretty filling. The lobster meat was fresh and delicious. Yum! (5/5)  This place is a little bit hidden near the piers, but it's a seafood gem! We made reservations ahead of time and were seated promptly with a wonderful view of the waters.

As a trendy foodie-type I rolled my eyes disdainfully of anything up in that darn touristy area, but ultimately acquiesced. When we walked in the door, it was packed to the gills (fish pun!) and I was wishing that I had been able to sway my mother earlier. It looked like it was straight out of the sixties and reminded me of restaurants we'd end up going to when visiting my grandparents.  I shall scoff no more at Scoma's. They're still in business for a reason. All the seafood was fresh and excellent, and I was able to pick good wines by the glass to go with. I don't remember what I chose w/ the cioppino other than it was red, but I recommend the Grgich Hills Fume Blanc w/ the mixed seafood plate. It's a sauv blanc that has spent some time in oak, so it's light, yet has some body.",

    "review_text": "2.5 STARS   WELCOME TO TOURONVILLE!  Touronville is where you will find a flock of homogeneous tourons. You know...the khaki, socks with Birkenstocks, and fanny-pack wearing tourists who naively wear their $1k DSLR camera around freely like a puka shell necklace. Like a moron, they overpay for a mediocre meal that ends up hurting more than having your wrists cuffed to your ankles.   Sadly, I was THAT touron last night...  I've heard great things about Scoma's being this great \"SF Institution\" serving superb seafood. Well that may have been the case 40 years ago when their only competition was Sizzler's, Lyons, or Auntie Flo's diner (my lame assumption at least) but today it's more like an SF retribution.   Craving sashimi, I ordered the closest thing to it on the menu, the Sea Whistle Smoked Salmon Plate. For $19, I got a $5.99 three ounce pack of grocery store quality smoked salmon that had been laid out on a plate to air dry like a Downy detergent commercial with red onions, capers, solidified cream friache, and sliced toasted baguettes. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jqEpBbf_qNfWuz_GBkwCjw?select=tOxNhmV_ulIJAZrCXleA3g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jqEp\u2026</a> Don't worry Costco, Scoma's got nothing on you.   For my entree, I chose the highly acclaimed $37 Lazy Man's Ciopinno. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jqEpBbf_qNfWuz_GBkwCjw?select=nF3o9GaR4HGq66eNF4zffA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jqEp\u2026</a> After having a the most phenomenal bowl of ciopinno from Anchor Oyster Bar on Monday (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZDvIMjJ-7I0561ckM4pAeA?select=LTriXoXcFiSWY6eWFdqGqA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ZDvI\u2026</a>), I was sorely disappointed when a pho sized bowl of Campbell's tomato soup was laid before me. It was like going from an artisan cup of coffee from Philz to Sh*tbucks coffee. The cioppino was more like a fish stew and a poor one at that. The fish was noticeably \"fishy\" and there were just 2 clams, 4 scallops, 4 tiger prawns, crab lint and a plethora of bay shrimp suffering from Napoleon complex. With the exception of the scallops, everything was overcooked. The tomato broth was too thick and tasted like diluted Hunt's tomato paste yearning for fresh herbs (garnishing with herbs does not count) and garlic to rejuvenate it from its lonely canned shelf life.   Service was equally as unremarkable as the food. Our brusque waiter was MIA the entire night catering to the whims and wants of the obvious tourons trying to get the non-existent San Francisco treat at Scoma's.  Sitting in the outdated restaurant surrounded by 70s-80s sports memorabilia and a adorable congregation of those casting to be on Grumpy Old Men Part Deux made me feel like young cub as opposed to the usual cougar that sticks out like a sore thumb in a nightclub.  The best part of the meal was the FREE valet parking...now that IS a San Francisco treat! *Woot Woot*",

At about 5pm on Memorial Day, there was already a good crowd in the dining room. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table for 4. My mom and I split the seafood saut\u00e9, my sister got the prawn risotto, and my dad got the fettuccini with smoked salmon and shrimp. We all got some of their famous clam chowder, also. Their portions are quite large, so I'm glad I split my place with my mom. Even so, I didn't even finish all the pasta, and was still full!  The chowder was creamy, but not too rich. It did have potatoes (not a big fan), but also a hearty helping of clams. My seafood was cooked to perfection with a mini lobster tail, shrimp, scallops, and crab leg meat. The sauce was also quite good and light, without being overbearing in flavor. I also liked that the rice (pilaf?) soaked up all the juices.  Our waitress was also very personable and nice!   Fresh seafood and great service! Their prices are a bit on the high side, but it is Fisherman's Wharf, so it's to be expected.",

They took a plan from the airlines play book and stuck as many micro tables as possible within their footprint. It is very cramped. I was practically leaning into the window waiting for the exit procedures to be announced.  Waited for the seat at the bar. Very cool. The bartender was one of the best. I had a cable car to get an \"authentic drink\". It was amazing even though I'm not a tequila fan. My friend on this business trip had a bloody mary which he said was perfect.   The host really was pushing us to get our seats, which was funny. Told him to tell the bartender and the two should work it out as we were waiting for him to make our drinks and then to close out the tab.  The waiter (as all of them appeared to be) probably had worked there 30 years. Very knowledgeable, confident and humorous. He gave us a rapid tour of one of the most ambiguous menus I've ever seen. Unlike Cheesecake Factories encyclopedias, this was a couple pages of bullet notes. I kid you not, my choice was \"Mixed Shellfish $40.\" I also ordered the Lobster Bisque.  At these prices, my quality meter went way up. I don't mind paying, but now I'm expecting. I love Captain D's cause for bucks you get $5.  The Lobster Bisque was fantastic, but I think a lobster may have bathed in the pot two years ago. I don't remember anything solid bumping into my teeth. The mixed shellfish was a huge plate. Half of it crisp vegetables (quite a \"mix\") and a third was rice and pasta. The pasta was incredible and the sauce was very good. The mixed seafood consisted of \u00a03 scallops, 3 shrimp, and two chunks of micro lobster tail that made me think they were fishing in the crustaceans' preschool.  The fantastic waiter practically disappeared after serving us long after our order. If I had my wife on a romantic evening, the alone time would have been welcome. On an airline with a business friend, it only reinforced how uncomfortable this was. The bill eventually came back. I thought the food was very good (not exceptional), but totally not at the same level as the bill.  Would I go again? If someone else was buying and if I wasn't choosing. San Fran has thousands of other untried restaurants that I would rather check out. I can understand ANY rating between 1 and 5 depending on how crowded/busy and what's ordered.",

Then, the overall feeling - elegance yet unpretentious, quality yet not snobbish, efficient yet not pushy.  Tonight, I was \"party of one\" - probably least interesting type of guest. Perhaps I was lucky, but I got excellent table, and no waiting.... I'm pretty sure that they don't recognize me from before, so this is luck and/or standard practice. As for the food, I ate all. The portions are not \"amerikanski\" XXL, nor French \"taste a spoonful\" - this is genuine Italian - you get decent size meal. This evening it was Mr Sonny, but service was very decent any time before as well. So, price/performance this place is a true Gem. Yes, there is better food to get in restaurants that are significantly more expensive, but hey I've had more expensive \"stuff\" that is far behind what Scoma's delivers. Consistency, quality, style.

We were seated quickly and were able to peer out at the docked boats gently lolling on the mellow water ripples. Seals even swam by with relaxed elegance as we dined.  Our waiter was suited in up in a formal white shirt and black pants. It was evident by the way he discussed the menu that he's been a fixture at Scoma's for awhile. We ended up getting a plate of the prawns and scallops - which came nestled beside creamy garlic mashed potatoes, seasoned rice, and steamed vegetables, the Petrale Dore, and the Broiled Wild Salmon. The salmon was incredible. Moist and paired nicely with the mashed potatoes and simple vegetables. The scallops and prawns were huge and exploding with flavor. The Petrale Dore was tasty - but it is served fish and chips style - so it was a tad heavy and greasy.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our meal, but moreover we enjoyed that we could hear each other talk and welcomed the quietness apart from the busy main wharf.  Highly recommend this fresh fish restaurant and would definitely love a return visit to enjoy their other acclaimed dishes such as Scoma's \u00a0\"Lazy's Man's\" Cioppino.  Trust.",

I cannot sing it enough praise. The lobster salad was okay, but the lemon wedge made it better.  The lamb I ordered rare and it came out the way I wanted it: nice and bright pink. It was tender and juicy. The veggies that came with it just made this wonderful dish just better.  I liked the tiramisu; I wished there was more of it.

Just minutes after this conversation, the hostess called us. \u00a0As we passed the other patrons and then the front door, my cousin darted out and I was just behind her. \u00a0We never got to eat there, because of the British gentlemen, but we felt hijacked, and laughed about what their faces must have looked like when we pulled a sly one on them. \u00a0  I can only speak from my experience here, and the hostess should have never changed our reservation without our consent.",

    "review_text": "It's been a while since I've been to a restaurant that is a solid 4 stars, no borderline 5 or borderline 3.   Scoma's is an upscale and classy seafood spot in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf with a staff well versed in everything seafood and wine and an impressively extensive menu. The servers can sometimes feel a bit lethargic and come across as a tad pretentious but given the upscale ambiance and old-SF vibe, it fits right in.   My friend and I headed here to celebrate the crab season and thus ordered the Crab Risotto and Garlic Roasted Dungeness Crab. We also prefaced the meal with some calamari as an appetizer. All three items were fabulously solid in their own exclusive way - the risotto was creamy in a tomato-based broth with large chunks of fresh crab meat spread evenly throughout. The dungeness crab was fresh, tender and came with some butter for dipping pleasure. And the calamari was crispy and fried to perfection. We paired all of the above with a some Prosecco and it matched perfectly.   The food gets 4.5 stars, service gets 3.5 - 4 stars and ambiance gets 4 stars - hence the 4 star average.   If you're in the Fisherman's Wharf area and are in the mood for an upscale seafood dining experience, definitely consider Scoma's.",

The food was excellent (as always), but the service was not up to the standard I am used to and the changes to the menu are equally disappointing. \u00a0Their prices have increased but the portions are smaller, the side selections have narrowed and are not up to the standard of their traditional rice pilaf and garlic mashed potatoes. The main dishes are still the highest quality and in the 15+ years I have been going there, I have never had a bad meal, but the 25 minutes between ordering my salad and getting it and the additional 15 waiting for the entree (while waiting the whole time to get a refill on my coffee), was unacceptable. The explanation of why they replaced the traditional rice and potatoes was to offer more\"healthy\" choices. Clearly, they mistake the purpose of a fine restaurant. If I want someone to watch my calories for me, I'll get married. \u00a0When I go out to dine, I am looking for quality food and service. \u00a0I felt this was not what I received.

Upsetting.  We started with a bottle of wine and the calamari. It was so-so....I was really expecting the best calamari I've ever had...but then again when the fish is fried, I guess it doesn't really matter how fresh it is anyways.   For my entree, I asked the waiter what his favorite risotto was...he said the Prawn Risotto, so I went with it. So disappointing. It was so FISHY! The entire dish was, not even just the prawns. I will give them credit that the risotto was cooked properly, but still...just a disappointment.  Boyfriend had some fish dish...I did try it, but don't recall what it was, so it must have not been that memorable...or perhaps it was just the second bottle of wine that is making my mind so fuzzy...but even if so, you'd think I'd enjoy the food then, right? ;]  Anyways...had it not been for the wine and the really outstanding service, Tim was his name, I would probably give Scoma's only one star.

I dont care either way for scallops or shrimp (my friend left most of the scallops behind, and he loves scallops)- but the crab and lobster were delish.

Wow, what a great setting, all these little boats moored up and this great looking restaurant overlooking the bay and harbor. Walking up I see the white table cloths so you know its gonna be fancy and then looking at the menu outside the prices confirmed it but you get what you pay for and I wanted more than bar food. Quite posh inside, we get seated at nice window table and our waiter, Jose A and his helper were quick with menus, bread &amp; water. He was very helpful as I couldn't decide which fish to go for tho ended up on the Alaskan Halibut. He was also great help with some of the beers that I was not familiar with and I tried Anchor Steam and Liberty Ale.

After a very long wait a Saturday night (30+minutes), they generously gave us a window table so we could see a bit of the bay/sunset.  Appetizer  Calamari- best ever and best dish of the night to me!!! So perfectly crispy and well-seasoned without being too heavy.  Comes with a very delicious tartar sauce and spicy tomato-based sauce.   Entrees  Mussels in white wine/garlic sauce instead of a tomato-base- very very good, the sauce was more of an afterthought but the mussels were very fresh. I liked this base much more than the cioppino.  Cioppino- Great seafood, but not the best tomato sauce (too watery, not memorable in terms of taste). Since the sauce was so bland and the dish was hyped so much I had really high expectations and though the seafood itself was steamed/cooked well I would not order it again. Nothing in the soupy sauce enhanced the seafood to me.   Wonderful free Birthday dessert:)!!!! Splendidly rich fudge cake with some whip cream, raspberry sauce, and powdered sugar.  Fantastic serivce once we were seated (water filled all the time, wonderfully kind waitress) and ambiance overall. Will come back for the Calamari whenever I'm in SF:)!!",

Some reviewers note that the prices are on the high side, even if worth it. \u00a0Scoma's does have a three course price fixe for $45, a great option for those on a budget.   Ok-now about the food. Amazing lobster bisque, and this is coming from a New Englander. The price fixe version comes with a deconstructed lobster salad on the side. I added the lobster meat from that into the bisque and was in heaven. The main course was a scallop and pasta dish in a light cream sauce. Everything about it was perfect. Dessert was a brownie and ice cream duo. The brownie was mediocre at best. BUT, the homemade caramel sauce that accompanied the ice cream was pure heaven, so I didn't mind not eating the brownie at all.   I would definitely recommend.   We went on a Sunday night, without reservations. They were very busy, but the wait was less than half an hour. It is down a small side street, so you have to have an idea of where you are going.",

The Shrimp and Crab Louis Salad has the Louis (Thousand Island) dressing over a generous portion of Bay Shrimp and Dungeness Crab Meat (no shells to peel or pick at here!) on top of a bed of lettuce with beets, and other garnishment. \u00a0This is the lunch sized portion, not to be confused with the full dinner entree portion which costs over $30. \u00a0But, make no mistakes here, I'd assumed it would be a small portion, it's actually a very fair and fulfilling portion, that is perfect, it's big enough as an entree to get you filled.

    "review_text": "When in San Francisco, go with seafood. On a referral from my boss, Scoma's was the place to go. Situated in the wharf area, Scoma's is tucked away from the street, almost secluded. They process the seafood on premises - cleaning, filleting, etc. You can watch them through a picture-glass window right next to the restaurant. The interior design is nautically themed, yet classic. A long bar is near the entrance where you can have a libation while waiting for your table. The dining room is beautiful with glass on both sides of the restaurant. While there's not much to see at night, we did watch seagulls perch on the wooden wharf beams outside watching us eat our dinner. I love clam chowder and it is usually one of my staples that I use to test the level of the food. This has to be the best clam chowder I've ever had! It's creamy, buttery, and chocked full of clams. It was held and served at the perfect temperature so the cream didn't break. I worked with clam chowder for 9 years at Disneyland and you really had to watch the holding temperature. Once the cream breaks, the soup loses its creamy texture (almost like curdled milk) and needs to be discarded. The fresh cracked black pepper on top sealed the deal. Scoma's, you had me at \"clam chowder\"! I decided to try something off of their daily special menu, Lobster Raviolis topped with lobster tail and salmon fillet. It was pretty good. The salmon needed a little more seasoning, but had a nice buttery flavor and soft texture. The lobster tail was tender and perfectly cooked. The raviolis were okay. I would have liked more herbs like tarragon, rosemary, and/or oregano to punch up the sauce as it was a little heavy. \u00a0My mom ordered the Dungeness Crab. \u00a0As it was summer, it was out of season so it was \"fresh frozen\". She was a little disappointed that she couldn't have the insides (miso or mustard of the crab) as they are cleaned out when prepped. Our server assured us that if we came back during Dungeness crab season that we could order it with the \"miso\" intact. She enjoyed every bit of it as it came out steaming hot and ate it to make our ohana proud, bib and all. Our meal ended with roses. A man proposed to his future bride that night. They were leaving on a flight back to China and couldn't take them. The staff gave us a couple to take back to our hotel room. They were beautiful!",

My boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque and was thoroughly surprised by how delicious it was (coming from the east coast he was skeptical). He said it had the perfect balance of cream and lobster. He also ordered his first Dungeness crab and loved it. It comes with a side of either regular melted butter or garlic butter and he said the garlic butter was definitely the way to go.  If you aren't a seafood eater there are few options for you so i would suggest going elsewhere. They do seafood exceptionally well and that's definitely what you should come for.  As far as ambiance it seems to be on the fancier side though it's filled with tourists for afternoon lunch and it doesn't appear to enforce a dress code. I imagine that's different for the evenings. It's also situated back off the main drag basically in the marina which makes for some wonderful views and a quieter atmosphere.",

I'll begin with the fried oysters, which were fried perfectly. Breading was crispy like a panko breading, and the oyster was fried just enough to give it that crispy edge, but without drying the oyster itself out. The lobster bisque was on point, savory but not too salty.   Now, the Ciopinno was great; the tomato broth was a bit on the rich side, but not enough to cover the taste of the seafood. Mussels were cooked just right, soft and not rubbery. Scallops were amazing, and the fish was fantastic. The mixed seafood plate was amazing; their grilled shrimp was probably the best shrimp I've ever had. The seasoning was SO good, and the shrimp itself had that snap/crunch which all grilled shrimp should have. Salmon was perfectly cooked through; moist but not raw, and was seasoned well. Scallops were great too, as expected.   I'd recommend coming here for any special occasion. The staff is well trained, courteous and very accommodating should you have any special needs.",

The service was great, they helped us navigate a somewhat vague food menu. The food was also really good. My scallops were outstanding, but my prawns were a bit dry. Everyone else at my table really enjoyed their meals as well. One person we were with - who is originally from SF - swears by the Cioppino and made all of us try it. It's HUGE, and despite four people trying bites, and her giving it her all, she still took a boatload home.   It's pretty pricey, but it feels like one of those classic, old-school seafood restaurants that you have to try. Why change if it's still good, right?",

When my brother said he wanted the whole crab and then ordered the halibut the waiter said so you don't want the whole crab?? And we all looked at him crazy!  My brother said he wanted both and the waiter said oh that a lot of food and told us the market price for the crab, making us feel like we couldn't afford it or something.... This guy was pissing us off! Maybe because he serviced the Caucasian people a lot faster then he did us brown folk!  Everything took forever to come out!!! Our drinks were empty and our waiter was nowhere to be found!  The food was honestly mediocre... The ciopinno is nothing fancy at all. For our bill being $230 for only 3 of us wouldn't have been bad if the waiter didn't take so long! We still left him a decent tip even though he made us feel like we weren't worthy to dine here.

I asked where it was and was told ats just around the corner on the right. Walked over in 2 mins and put our name in(always busy here btw ) and were called in 15 mins. WOW !!! one of the best I ever had and I have had it in a lot of places too. Will be back next time in town... WE LOVE SAN FRANCISCO !!! Great city to be in",

Many reviews mentioned that the resturant needed updating, but a Detroit girl like me can appreciate a resturant with history, good service and an ole school feel :-)  The food was amazing!! We ordered crab cakes for an appetizer. The cakes were soooooo FRESH, served with a delicious sauce and atop a small bed of lettuce.   I ordered shrimp annuzzi. Let me tell you...this dish was bursting with flavor. The shrimp were cooked to perfection (lightly pan fried in an egg batter) along with rice and veggies. Btw, the dish had eight large prawns, for thirty bucks. Really??? Why are people complaining about prices??? Very satisfied!! I have no issues with paying for good food.   My boo ordered shrimp/Dungeness crab risotto. I had a spoonful of it. It tasted amazing.   Too stuffed for dessert. This is a MUST STOP if you're in San Francisco. The waiters were cute, with their formal outfits.",

That all makes for one memorable night out in San Francisco, and Scoma's delivered on a an enjoyable Fisherman's Warf Dinner out. I am old school seafood and cut my teeth at The Rusty Pelican, putting in almost a decade as a manger, so I know quality when I see it. The only reason the place got less then 5 stars was it needs a face lift and a good dusting. The hostess stand is antiquated and needs to be changed. The hostess stand is almost like a betting window at an old race track, only less welcoming, and the rest of the place, except the dining room seemed dingy.  Would I recommend Scoma's? HECK YES!!!! plan on a wait but there is a bar!",

My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday celebration last month, he knows that I love seafood so much and I don't like to go anywhere fancy. This place passed all my expectations! They serve the best seafood in Fisherman's Wharf although very pricey. I didn't know what to order because there are so many selections to choose from. But our server recommended the food that I had. I forgot what it's called but it has lobster, crab, scallops  , shrimps, pasta and rice in it. I was first hesitant to order what the server suggested because I always know what to get and I'm not quite use to being told what to get. But soon as they serve my food, it smelled great and it tasted great! The portion was really big too! After that, they serve me a surprise birthday chocolate cake (on the house), I love how it's not too sweet, just perfect!   I want to talk about our server really quick, he is very nice and funny because he sang me the happy birthday song even it was just by himself singing. Lol Thank you, server!  The ambiance of the place is OK, it's dated and there are more oldies than young people. It's casual attire and the place is not too loud. If you want to go to this place, make sure you have a RESERVATION!  Highly recommend and I would definitely go back again! :)",

Cioppino was very big! (Thank Tony for the warning!) The sauce was amazing, salty, tomato-y, and full of flavor. Big chunks of fresh fish, crisp shrimp, and fresh clams. Lots of pieces of crab too.

Best fried calamari I have had. And another 1.5 star for the trio appetizer the boyfriend and I had ordered.   As for my plate, the Sand Dab, it is usually a great tasting fish but what came with my fish was boiled Pennae pasta and over cooked asparagus. The sand dab did not have the garlic caper flavored sauce that the fish was to be cook in. Instead, it tasted like a light white fish in batter. I would call my sand dab, fancy fish filets or fish sticks. As for the Pennae it had no flavor. When I say boiled that's it. It was dry and had no seasoning. And as for my asparagus it was too mushy and soft. Not worth $30. I wish I ordered something else.   And I did not want to hurt my boyfriend's feelings cause he raved about this place being awesome, and that he wanted to take me here to try it out. So thanks to him, but I guess I wouldn't order the sand dab again. At least not here.   But overall, I will come back one more time in hopes I order something better and not be a disappointment.",

I ordered the clam chowder in a bread bowl and oysters, along with a Brancott Sauvignon Blanc ($9). The only open bar was facing the parking lot and pier, which was a bummer. They have another bar with a better bay view, but it wasn't open yet.   I arrived at 4:30 on a Wednesday, the bar was full. The service was quick and attentive. As soon as I sat down, the bartender took my order. The clam chowder bread bowl was excellent and quite substantial. The non happy hour price is $11, for $5 this is the best deal in town.

The interior is upscale, classy, and dated. The host was in a full suit and the wait staff were all in white tuxedos. Our request for a table with a view was honored.   Our meal started off with bread which was the worst part of our meal. The bread was cold and stale. ...the butter was also cold and didn't even start to melt on the cold bread...  The appetizer sampler was out of this world! At $26, there was plenty of fried calamari which was super fresh, perfectly cooked (not rubbery) and lightly battered. The crab cakes were melt-in-your-mouth good and the shrimp scampi was delicious too! :D  The Lazy Man's Cioppino that our waiter and Yelpers raved about was over-rated and over-priced at $36. The seafood stew was okay. The best part was probably the garlic bread that was dipped into the marinara sauce.   Service was friendly by our waiter.

    "review_text": "Excellent old school seafood restaurant. This place isn't fancy (save for the classy white dinner jackets of the waiters) but it is pricey. It's definitely worth experiencing at least once since it's such an institution. The wait on a Saturday can be easily a hour or more without a reservation.  From the time you walk in until you walk out, you are greeted from friendly hostesses and waiters. The waiters are funny and know the right amount of attention to give you.  The shrimp cocktail starter is a bit pricey for what you get but it's solid and on par with the value at any other place that has something like it on the menu. The clam chowder is EXCELLENT and I recommend splitting a bowl for two if you are thinking of each getting a cup (they just give you 2 cups worth in a bowl for $2 more). There's a lot of clams in the chowder. This place overall gives big portions though you're paying for it.  The ciopinno is excellent though it's more about the parts than the whole. The broth is almost a tomato bisque and it is filled beautifully with large pieces of seafood excellently cooked. It's less about the stew mixed together like other places in North Beach.  The whole garlic roasted dungeness crab is amazing. It's generous size and well cut up and prepared.   Definitely worth trying once. I spotted the large size crab louie salad and was blown away by the sheer size of seafood -- must try it next time.",

They do not take reservations, but there was no wait for a party of 6 Sunday night at 6:30. Had we been a group of 3-4, there would have been a wait, but all of the larger tables were empty. So I guess if you don't want to wait, find some friends at the bar and see if you can't come up with a bigger group.  Cocktails were very good and I thought the bread was fresh and chewy. The portions here are enormous! I ordered the pasta garibaldi (linguine with salmon, scallops and mussels) in a sundried tomato pesto and could barely eat half. The sauce did not taste anything like sundried tomato pesto - in fact I'd be willing to bet money it was tomato sauce - but it was good, so whatever.  Others at the table got cioppino, crab spoon-bread, prawns and scallop platter, lobster bisque, and the crab cocktail. Everyone had good things to say about their food.  Service was ok - our waiter seemed like he was in a rush and left the table before everyone had a chance to order drinks. Water was refilled frequently and special requests were accommodated.  The atmosphere is really nice but the tables are much too close together. This would be a bad place for secret plotting, as the table next to you will 100% hear every word that you say.   Free valet is nice, but drive VERY slowly when entering and exiting their lot as it's one lane and a blind corner.",

Large wine list. 4 different kinds were selected at our table and all were delicious.  Calamari for appetizer made the spicy way... Perfection!!!  Highlight of this meal... My dads CIOPPINO!!!! Omg!!!! Please. You must get this. This is the end all to be all.  My half baked crab was exquisite and garlicky, but if you are not willing to get cracking and stink like a shellfish the next 24 hours... I don't suggest it:) crab takes work!  A standout in this meal was my sisters lobster ravioli. Wow. Fresh lobster stuffed in pasta with a huge piece of salmon laid on top. Need I say more?  They have the best sourdough with EVOO for dipping..... Pair this with the huge bucket of cioppino \u00a0(it's seriously a huge portion) and you are set my friend.

My partner in crime had the pasta with the little clams and holy jebus there was a lot of clams. We counted at least two and a half dozens of clams in that pasta.. which wasn't a bad thing.

Its kind of hidden and you have to walk off the main street to get here. Anyway, I got the Fresh Salmon and my gf got the Clams. I have to say, everything was so fresh and tasty!! The clams were so delicious and the sauce was to die for! My Salmon was very flavorful and tasty as well. We also got the appetizer sampler, and I will say this, the crab cakes were so good they practically melted in my mouth!! MMMM  Service was top notch and service was prompt. If you are ever in the SF area and want fresh seafood, then give this place a try!!",

The food here is solid! I loved the lobster bisque! So rich and creamy plus a bit of lobster pieces. This was my favorite part of my meal here! I ordered the rock shrimp and smoked salmon fettuccine. The shrimp and smoked salmon were cooked just right. Not overcooked at all. My only gripe with this dish was the over abundance of red onions! I like red onions, and a healthy addition of finely chopped pieces would be ok. Unfortunately, they put large slices that were overwhelming. Everyone else in my party was happy with their orders.  Seating here is kind of tight. The service was just ok. The host and our server lacked personality and enthusiastic service. Overall, good food and nice views. I definitely recommend to remedy those seafood cravings!",

Went here for lunch on a Friday. The lobster bisque rivals the best I've had in Boston. The flavor is perfect, not too creamy, not salty at all. Just fresh lobster goodness. I also tried the Grilled Tuna Steak sandwich. It was moist, and tasted super fresh. My companions had the Cioppino. It was the best I have ever tried. The broth was sweet from the tomatoes, but the natural seafood flavor added just the right amount of flavor without once making me think it was salty. Everything was cooked perfectly. The scallops had that snap and texture that is the mark of true freshness. Wow.  Our server Sean was great, very friendly and welcoming. In fact, the entire waitstaff here is all over the place (in a very good way), always attentive to the customers.  My only regret is that I got full. They have a great wine and draught beer selection as well.  Don't be a tourist, go to Scoma's!",

Don't mind the raccoons that live in the alley, they are as afraid of you as you are of them.  I started to see a trend that if you walk into any restaurant that has been opened for any length of time on the bay, it will be known as a \"tourist trap.\" This is another one of those places. Tourist trap or not, it wouldn't still be open if the food wasn't good. I didn't identify where everyone was from in the place, so from a qualified standpoint I can say it was busy without the known tourist status of the visitors.  The place appears small, but deceitfully seats more people than you'd expect.  We sat at the bar and had their Seahorse cocktail, in other circles this would be known as a Moscow Mule in glassware. The drinks were refreshing and our bartender was extremely helpful during our visit.  From the menu, my fianc\u00e9e ordered a cup of the clam chowder and the dungeoness crab cocktail. She said both were excellent. I had the dungeoness crab risotto. It is served in a generous portion and is a tasteful mixture of vegetables, crab, and risotto. \u00a0For those with gluten intolerance, the menu has an asterisk next to the options that are safe for you.  Scoma is a great seafood restaurant that is worth a visit if you're in the area!",

The restaurants been around forever and most of the servers have worked here for over 20 years or more per my waitress however they didn't have good food , well at least our lobster's wasn't good.   It's extremely pricey, it's an older restaurant, older demographic. Nothing trendy or hip. I wouldn't call it classy or elegant either, my chair was uncomfortable and my silverware was dirty, my waitress was super sweet about getting me a new set of silverware.. The servers have cute uniforms.   Our food cost around $150 for two of us, salad, entrees and desserts.   Both of our lobsters were super over cooked. My pasta had no flavor but it was cooked perfectly, no sauce , no seasoning just pasta. My steam veggies were just veggies , no flavor. I asked the server if the lobster is usually over cooked. She seemed offended that I asked her, she got into this whole thing about how they broil the food and how they have been in business since 1960's before I was even born, yeah she said that. She was an older lady and it was cute how she took pride in her job and the food, but at the end of the day we didn't like our rubbery over cooked lobster and the comment about when I was born was unnecessary. \u00a0My parents raised me to be polite to my elders, I just smiled and thanked her for letting us know. Anyways we didn't finish our meal and thankfully there is a thing called Yelp :) Despite our lobster experience I wanted to try the Jack Daniels bread pudding, so glad I did.   Personally I won't go back for their food however I might go back for the dessert if I'm in the area, however will never again make a trip to dine here. For us it was a complete waste of money and time.   The Jack Daniels Bread Pudding - 5 STARS - Delicious !!! \u00a0  Lobster / Food - 0 stars  Customer Service - 2   2 stars overall because of the bread pudding !!",

I used to see the ads for it when I went to Golden Gate Fields with my Papa 20 something years ago and he'd always rave about the freshness of the fish there. It has that \"old SF\" vibe that has been dying bit by bit in The City. If you like wood paneling, sweet heart Filipino waitresses, and a great piece of fresh sea steak!  Because people like lists: 1) Fish so fresh, it blinks at you before you dig in. 2) Rule #1, Never eat at an empty restaurant, and this place is hardly ever empty. 3) All are welcome, look around, it's damn near the UN 4) Bring your water jug full o' pennies, you're gonna need them cause this place is pricey. 5) Don't go pasta, just go with the special/catch of the day, best bang for your buck. 6) Get yourself a souvenir glass, to remember these good times when you're at home eating Ramen. 7) This place looks like your grandmother's old house... before you sold it, and put her in a home... you know, you should call your grandmother more often.",

The restaurant itself is located right off of pier 39 in the fisherman wharfs area. The decor is very underwhelming compared to the food.   We started with the some fresh oysters which were very fresh and went down well. My fianc\u00e9e ordered the market special, it was scallops on on spinach and potatoe pur\u00e9e. The scallops were large and flavourful. I ordered the wild king salmon on lobster ravioli. The wild king salmon was so fresh it had a dark pink colour and the lobster ravioli was perfection.   Overall the food was delicious and we would definitely revisit if we go to San Francisco again.   The only negative we had was the server we had was a little too slow. But she was nice and pleasant. Just not attentive enough.   A must go!",

Don't be fooled though, the inside of the boat was very nice and intimate. It was a very cute place to have a date and that's what we did!  My boyfriend and I started off with the Mediterranean Mussels and it was amazing. One of the best mussels my boyfriend and I have ever had. It was lightly sauteed and steamed in a buttery wine sauce and it was simply amazing.  I had the Shellfish Saute and it was lightly seasoned so you could really taste the seafood itself. This dish comes with a generous amount of scallops, shrimps and I believe there was lobster in there. I had a side of veggies and pasta. I wished the pasta was seasoned or had some sauce with it to make the dish more flavorful. Overall, this dish wasn't heavily seasoned and so it was simple and plain. But the seafood was so fresh and so good that it made up for the lack of seasoning.  Overall, we will probably come back for the mussels and to try their other seafood selections.",

The pork was served very dry and overcooked for my liking. The veggies were good; however, the polenta was fantastic.   Overall, this restaurant is overpriced and outdated inside. I imagine many of the dishes are very good, but you are really paying for prime real estate, not the food in front of you. Also, the view isn't that great, it has a parking lot view with a bit of wharf water and a warehouse across the waterway.   The valet was very rude to our party on several occasions. We were taking a group shot and he asked our uncle holding the camera to move so he could park a car. My uncle said he was almost done and would move, but it wasn't the immediate jump that the valet has expected. So he rolled his eyes and made several hand gestures showing his displeasure. It took another 10 seconds, and we moved our party inside to spend our couple thousand dollars on lunch.   I understand the valet is busy and has a job to do. However, there are ways to act, especially when we are your patrons who just tipped you, and are about to spend a bunch of money at your establishment.   We had a similar rude incident when leaving with this particular valet - I'm sorry I tipped him.   We also saw him park another patrons car too close to the edge of the dock, opened their car door into a wooden pier (somewhat hard), and then moved the car and walked away. Didn't check for damage, and I have a sneaking suspicion didn't tell the owners of the vehicle.   Needless to say, this valet left a poor taste in our mouths. Overall food was ok, prices much higher than the quality of the food was. Polenta was amazing though!  Also, sorry for getting long winded. My attempt to keep it short was obviously a fail.",

We had a linguine with light white cream sauce and shrimp, clams, etc. which was cooked perfectly... pasta was al dente, seafood tasted really fresh, cream sauce was packed with flavor and not too heavy.  Sad to admit this but at the end of the meal when the server was coming to take our plates I looked at her like she was crazy... i wasn't letting that plate go til every last drop of sauce was sopped up by their sourdough bread... which btw, was pretty awesome on it's own (as I guess most sourdough in SF is). \u00a0I mean, by the time I was done with my plate, it looked like it was already washed, dried n ready for serving again...  Ravioli was so-so, nothing special... calamari was great! \u00a0Another pasta dish with dungeness crab (can't remember if it was a special or on the reg menu) was just as amazing as the pasta dish above...   The restaurant has an outdoor deck which sits right on the water... inside looks a bit old-school... clean but if you ever make it out here on a decent day, def sit outside... beautiful spot.",

I mean, it was fine but not how others have raved. We started with the crab cakes. Perhaps I'm crazy, but they were in no way as good as the crab cakes at Pappadeaux! We split a pasta dish, which was decent. I personally think there are many other fantastic seafood restaurants in San Francisco in which to choose.",

Unfortunately our experience this past weekend was terrible. \u00a0While prices remain the same the portion sizes have been cut in half if not more. \u00a0We always order the lazy man's cioppino which used to come in a large bowl with tons of seafood. \u00a0Now it is served in a small soup bowl and the sauce, which used to be AMAZING, tastes terrible. \u00a0My mom had the crab louis and it was half the size it used to be (she pulled up pictures on her iPad of what it looked like the last two times we dined there). \u00a0The crab sandwich didn't even have lump crab meat on it....it had a pile of stringy crab. \u00a0 Service was excellent as it always is, which is why I am giving it one star. \u00a0We normally leave the restaurant full and feeling like we got a great value for our meal. \u00a0This time when we left we were all starving! \u00a0I don't understand why management wanted to change something that was so wonderful. \u00a0It looks like other reviewers are noticing the same changes and are deciding not to dine here anymore.  Sadly, management probably doesn't care about customers like us because they know that tourists will continue to dine here because they don't know any better. \u00a0We will surely miss Scomas and all the wonderful servers who work there.",

We knew this place would be pricey but we expected the food to be worth it. \u00a0We ordered the stuffed portobello mushroom and what we got was just one small portobello mushroom with barely anything in it. \u00a0I ordered a lobster salad and bisque, what I got was a tiny cup of tomato soup and a tiny clump of lobster meat. However, The entree portions were much better and cioppino was very good. But when it came time to dessert we were treated to a tiramisu inside an espresso cup. I seriously ate it in one bite it was that tiny.  I think I might have been able to over look all of this had our server not been horrible. He was very dull and unfriendly. It felt like he didn't care if we were there or not. There was another server there talking and being entertaining with all of his tables. I might have given this place 3 stars if we had him. Overall I was really excited for this restaurant but ended up leaving broke and hungry. Pretty disappointed.",

A plate piled high of dungeness crab meat. Seriously, PILED HIGH. It's accompanied by some lettuce, thickly sliced and crunchy carrots, slices of tomatoes, wedges of lemon, and a thousand island dressing on the side. It's so good you won't even need the dressing.  We've been here so many times and have had a number of different items on the menu and nothing ever disappoints.   I also love that there's free valet parking (aside from what you tip) and the waiters here are all so pleasant. They are professional, friendly, and very experienced.

It never seems like they're trying to conserve the ingredients. My favorite dish at Scoma's is the Mixed Seafood Plate. It consists of rice, noodles, scallops, lobster tale, shrimps,..etc. The portions are huge! I usually go to Scoma's for a family dinner (I'm a broke college student, and therefore can't afford food above 20 bucks sighs) and we order about 4 plates for 5 people. We always come back with leftovers!   If you're searching for a place that gives generous portions, delectable taste, and a beautiful view (at the pier), this is the place for you!",

We'd already tripped down to Alamo Square so my mom could get pictures of the Painted Ladies, and up to Lombard to check out switchback alley (I mean the Crooked Street!) so the only thing to do from there was walk/run/jog down Hyde and head for lunch at Scoma's!   Ok, I've never been here, but the reviews are really great, and who doesn't love a little old school charm right along the waterfront? I knew we had to be in for something pretty great when I saw how many open seats a lot of the restaurants we passed had, and then how few there were at Scoma's. Maybe it's just good marketing?   The building is pretty unassuming, the interior however is all dark wood, low ceilings, and tablecloths. White shirted black pantsed men hover EVERYWHERE. We were seated quickly and brought menus. Drinks were ordered and bread was munched upon. Now, the ever important task of deciding what to eat!  Well...I had to try the cioppino...despite its' steep price tag. Seriously...40 bucks for soup? It's soup. Again, trusting to my reviewing counterparts, I just didn't see how I could turn it down. My mom was apparently feeling the soup vibes as well, so we both ordered it. My dad got a scallop/shrimp dish, and the boy got salmon fettuccine.   Oh. Holy. Crap. This soup was...ok, first off there's a ton of it. It should come with some kind of warning like Caution - Bowl Will Be Size of Your Head. I don't think I could have eaten this whole bowl if I'd starved myself for three days. As it was I barely got through half. My mom was the same way - if only we'd known, we could have split it! Dad loved his food - he felt they were a little chintzy with the scallops, but he really enjoyed the shrimp. The boy was just kinda meh on his salmon. I tasted a bite and I could tell why. Seasonings were a bit off, and, well...he's from Alaska, and has pretty high standards for smoked salmon.   The service was really on par. Our waiter was helpful and very chatty. I just wish he'd given us some indication about the enormity of soup that was coming our way.  I mean, by all means, get it. There's a ton of fish and crab and scallops and shrimp and everything under the sea. It's seasoned excellently. There's just so. so. much.  I felt bad cause we couldn't really take it with us, given all the sightseeing still left to do, but...yeah.  The place is legit, the food is stellar and plentiful, and the servers are excellent. Totally go here. Bring your family.",

    "review_text": "I came here this past weekend because my favorite restaurant (House of Prime) was all booked up.. This place doesn't take reservations but luckily we have a connection with one of the waiters and were able to score a table within 30 minutes.. Scoma's was packed from the time that we got there, 7, until the time that we left, 10, with a bunch of people still waiting for tables! From what I've been told it's normally like that but I'm guessing that the NFL Playoff game being in town didn't help the crowd control either :P.. So there were a bunch of rowdy New Yorkers present as well as the usual San Francisco/Bay Area crowd.. The waiting area of this restaurant is pretty narrow so expect to stand in a cramped area while you wait for your party to be called by a hostess who looks unhappy and gives you a fake smile when you enter or speak.. The bar is right by the entrance so that's a good way to dish out $10-12 per drink while you wait.. Probably the most annoying part of our wait was listening to a group of drunk New Yorkers (I do not dislike NYers just this particular group!) yell to each other across the bar.. This isn't Applebee's it's a fine dining restaurant so let's get it together guys!  Being that our family friend is a waiter at Scoma's he would naturally know what the best things to order are so we left this in his hands and offered a few suggestions for what our party of 7 likes.. For our first course we had 2 plates of clams and oysters on a bed of ice, calamari (mmm baby tentacles!!), garlic bread, shrimp cocktail, steamed clams, and a cup of clam chowder (packed with goodies!).. I didn't try the hard shellfish because I'm not really a fan of it raw or cooked except for in a few dishes.. The only time I tried the clam was when it was steamed and even then I just couldn't take to the taste or texture of it.. The shrimp cocktail came with jumbo prawns and was absolutely amazing, as well as the calamari and clam chowder.. The garlic bread was probably some of the best I've ever had and was flavorful, well textured, and warm.. My guests thoroughly enjoyed the shellfish platter and the steamed clams so I'm guessing that was good too! For our second course we had a platter with an assortment of seafood including sole, seared ahi tuna, scallops, and crab cakes.. Everything on this platter was delicious except I'm not very partial to scallops, especially raw, and these were only partially cooked (75% maybe).. The seared ahi tuna was the most impressive item that they brought out and I could've eaten it all night if my stomach allowed for it.. We also had spinach, garlic mashed potatoes, and steamed veges as sides with some seafood pasta.. I didn't get a chance to try the mashed potatoes but the veges and spinach were okay.. I don't generally like my veges steamed since the flavor can be quite bland.. By the time the pasta got to our table I was already quite full so I only tried some of the lobster tail that was in it.. Surprisingly this was my first time trying lobster, ever! And with my under developed palate for seafood, naturally, I wasn't that big of a fan, haha! I still enjoy crab now and then though [: For all of the above mentioned our bill came to ~$340 +18% gratuity and we didn't order and drinks once we were seated..",

Scoma's was recommended for the view, but we didn't have a view from our seats. \u00a0The service and meal made up for it and the ambience was still nice.  I cannot say enough good things about our server. \u00a0He was attentive to our drinks, made suggestions and answered questions, and helped my daughter with crab etiquette. \u00a0While the service was excellent, it was not stuffy or snobbish.   We started with a bottle of the house white. \u00a0It was mildly sweet and not dry-- the way my husband prefers. \u00a0He liked it, but I would have preferred a red. \u00a0That is my taste issue, though.

I followed the advice from the iPhone Yelp app and it brought me to this restaurant with 400+ review and a solid 4 star.   I decided to go full tourist style and went with the prix-fixe lunch menu. What could one possibly get from a $23.95 lunch at a tourist district?  Starter  Cup of Clam Chowder - (5/5 stars) - Their chowder completely blew my mind. I only found out later that Newsweek had named Scoma as one of the five best chowders in the US. While I can't totally agree with that claim, the chowder is still definitely one of the better ones. Solid 5 star quality.  Entree Scallops with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Mixed Vegetables - (3/5 stars) - A bit disappointed by this. The scallops were flavorful but was a bit too salty and over cooked. I have had better scallops elsewhere.   Dessert  Chocolate Mousse Cake - (4/5 stars) - I usually dislike chocolate cakes but I was managed to finished my dessert. The cake was rich in taste yet light in texture. The strawberry puree paired well with the dark chocolate flavor.  I also managed to 'sample' the other entree. Petite Dungeness Crab Salad - (4/5 stars) - Nothing petite about this salad. There were tons of crab meats. The meat was very fresh. Yummy salad dressing.  Great quality food for only $23.95? I have possibly paid close to that for lunch at some mediocre restaurants in south bay.  I am very tempted to try their cioppino that everyone was raving about.

BUT I'm not sure if it's because I don't normally dress up all fancy and nice, and maybe I look younger than my actual age, but either way, the service is not very good, especially the hostess. I went in last week and they gave me some bread and grissini with butter but the grissini were soggy and the bread too chewy and my silverware were a little dirty too. I also asked for a beer and they never checked my ID. I would think that for being such a nice restaurant they would be more professional and clean, but the clam chowder is amazing, so I'm guessing the rest of the menu is too...? Also, first time I went, the bloody mary was really good too.",

The decor was straight out of the 70s -- not in a retro cool kind of way, but in a never changed kind of way. The walls are festooned with faded color photos of older people having good lives who are probably long dead.   I suspect the menu hasn't changed much in decades. Same old staff. Same old uniforms (service was fine though). A bit rain down, but not dirty.

We got calamari frutti dinner, pasta alla scoma, and \"lazy man's\" cioppino. Two girls ordering three main dishes must have confused the waiter. She was like, \"You girls are ordering too much..?\" Ha Ha.   The calamari was really good, it came with rice, penn pasta (why..?), and steamed veggies. We both liked it. Pasta alla scoma was not so great. Pasta was overcooked and I thought my teeth would break from all the lil rocks/sand from my clams .. However, The biggest disappoint of this experience was the cioppino. After seeing a lot of reviewers raving about how excellent this was, I decided to get it and ugh what a waste it turned out to be. It's way salty. Basically, it's a \"lazy\" dish with bunch of seafoods thrown in a marinara sauce. SALTY. I literally drank 4 cups of water just to eat the swimming seafoods.   Although the food we got sucked.. Atmosphere is great here. All the waiters seem really veteran and know what they are doing. I think we just chose bad food perhaps.. Maybe I will try Scoma's again..",

The hostess, somewhat unwillingly, brought us to a \"better table\". She definitely had an attitude. Sorry, but we don't like sitting next to the \"hangout\" spot for the servers, especially if Im paying the prices they charge to eat here. Food was ok. I got a sampler from the appetizer menu. I believe my boyfriend got whatever the fish special was. It was just ok, that I can't recall exactly which one he got. Our waiter was nice, a little eccentric, but friendly enough. I forget his name. Im sure this place has many return, local customers and then of course, the tourist types, such as ourselves. I was not impressed, at all, with this restaurant. The whole experience, from the moment I walked in, to the end of the meal, I felt very uncomfortable and this place is just not \"my cup of tea\".

Scoma's came HIGHLY recommended by family, friends, and fellow travelers on our recent trip to Fisherman's Wharf. We were prepared to enjoy a fabulous meal. We didn't make a reservation but put our name on the waiting list and took a walk around Ghiradelli Square. We arrive back in about 45mins and were promptly seated. So far so good right?  No... Our waitress quickly profiled the three 20-something professional women sitting at the table as not her priority. We asked for specials and got a short hand version of \"scallops with rice\" without any further explanation or offering (this was also not the special). When we asked for her recommendation on wine, she picked the cheapest bottle on the menu after stating she can't recommend a bottle because she \"does not know us\" and her choice was unrelated to our meal choices (we chose a different bottle). She only came back to our table to bring us food and collect the check. Not the type of service I EXPECT when I'm paying $30 a plate and buying a bottle of wine for the table.  But, on to better things! I hope others can report a better time with service and this review does not deter you from trying to AMAZING food Scoma's has to offer. First off, the Salmon was fabulous in a butter dill sauce paired with garlic mashed potatoes. The calamari was fried to perfection and melted in my mouth. And the crab cakes are a must! Hands down the best crab cake I have EVER tasted. The crab stuffed portabella mushroom is a worthy appetizer but a small portion if you want more than 2 bites.  Overall a great tasting meal, and I would return for the food alone. I'll over look the service this time, but don't burn me twice, and if the Scoma's Manager/Owner is reading this... I recommend a chat with your staff on profiling. We may have looked young but we still walked out of your restaurant with a $150 bill :)",

When we arrived at Scoma's we did not have a reservation because we were travelling in from Concord, and did not know how long the drive would take. We waited at the bar for about fifteen minutes and then were seated in the renovated section of the restaurant overlooking the marina. It was a gorgeous view!  Our server was so knowledgeable about the menu and shared that he had worked here for many years. My in-laws and husband all ordered the same thing. It was a seafood medley, so they could try a little bit of everything. I decided on the Dungeness crab and a side of French fries.   When they brought out our food, my crab was steamed in a garlic seasoning (which I did not order) but it smelled so good that I ate it anyways. While the garlic seasoning was incredibly messy, I loved the flavor it gave the crab. The French fries came in a massive order. My hubby and I split them, and even then we couldn't finish! \u00a0   Everything is fresh. You see them cleaning the seafood and fish in the building over when you walk by. Seeing that made me love Scoma's even more.   I would come back here in a heartbeat. Be prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation. But, the food and atmosphere is worth it.",

    "review_text": "A truly classic seafood restaurant on the San Francisco waterfront. I've enjoyed dinner here on numerous occasions and have never been disappointed. The cioppino has so much shellfish and seafood that it is difficult to finish unless you have a huge appetite. The lobster is the best I have ever tasted, and it is available served at least three different ways each night. Crab perfect, chowders loaded with clams, etc. Warm fresh bread and a variety of salads compliment probably the best dinners available in the Fisherman's Wharf area.   Located a bit off the main drag of wharf shops on Al Scoma Way, this restaurant brings back the memories of what the waterfront use to be like. Great service, nice bar, quality food, in a very clean environment. Wait staff has been nothing short of perfect on every visit. Plenty of small tables in the bar to relax if you do have to wait for dinner seating.  I have also had lunch/dinner at most wharf restaurants and while many of the menus have been adjusted to the tourist crowd and are somewhat disappointing, Scoma's maintains the quality and atmosphere that you should expect of a higher end restaurant along the waterfront. They don't cut corners. Valet parking is available at the front of the restaurant, and by donation.   I usually call in about 30 minutes before arrival to check on wait times and never have had to wait more than 10 minutes on weekends, no wait ever on weekdays. The atmosphere is nice enough for any occasion and the bar serves up a long list of quality wines, as well as your favorite cocktails.",

I had the cioppino and my bf had half a roast garlic dungeness crab and some clam chowder.  The oysters: Delicious. For $3 a piece, they better be!!!!! Clam chowder: YUM!!!  Now on to the bigger better things.. the Cioppino: Good, but Fish Market in San Mateo makes MUCH better cioppino. As much as I LOVE anything tomato, the consistency was more like that of a pasta sauce rather than a soup or stew. Though yummy, a little too hearty and takes away from the flavor of the seafood. For $40, I wasn't floored...  Roast garlic crab: Good, but better at Thanh Long....  I really liked the atmosphere of the place, and loved our Italian waiter who called me \"Bella\", didn't catch his name, but he was great.  Overall, Scomas is good, but not as good as I expected.

As for the dinner, I started off with a very tasty bloody mary and the BLACK-N-BLUE AHI, which was perfectly seared. My main course was the SHRIMP AND SCALLOPS ALLA GANNON which came with a side of veggies, mashed potatoes, and rice. The shrimp and scallops were really great; you can tell the seafood was fresh.   Overall, I would recommend this place to dine in at least once. The menu has many options, if I end up there again I'll be going for the Lobster ravioli.",

We came on a Sunday at around 4:30pm and the wait was already about 45 minutes. It was highly recommended by a friend so we decided to just stick it out. The place itself is kind of dim and has a sort of old-school-class feel to it. We took a look at the menu beforehand and I was blown away by the prices. We were seated in a section that I think had just opened up for dinner because we were the first ones there but it filled up quickly. Our server was beyond friendly and knowledgeable, answered all our questions and patiently waited as we debated what to ordered.  We got an appetizer, Oyster Rockefeller Alla Scoma (cheese, lemon, and spinach on oysters), which were SO GOOD, so flavorful and really just blew me away even more than the menu prices. My main dish was the Pasta Alla Scoma (garlic butter sauce linguini with clams) and it was filled with lots of clams (which it better be for the price). It was pretty good.  Again the appetizer and server are what have me really liking this place. I want to really love Scoma's but I'm just not sure the price lives up to it. If you do stop by though, definitely try the Oyster Rockefeller Alla Scoma (if you're into that)!",

    "review_text": "So, my manfriend had been waxing poetic about a place he dined while at a conference in San Francisco ages ago. The way he described it, it sounded like an unknown diamond in the rough. Separately, I had bookmarked Scoma's as a place we might want to go for a nice dinner. Lo and behold, they were one in the same.  We hadn't planned to hit Scoma's in advance, so the best we could do with Open Table was an 8:45 reservation. After a day of walking around and an impromptu bar crawl, we decided to try our luck for an earlier table. We grabbed a drink at the bar after \u00a0putting our name in; definitely a happening place with a friendly crowd. For him, The Dinghy and for me, The Calm Before the Storm, a tasty, spicy take on a margarita.  Scoma's is tucked away from the madness of Jefferson and the Embarcadero, but the secret is out, so make reservations. The ambiance reminded me of a steak house; waiters in white coats, attentive service, large portions and the absence of any gimmicky seafood decor (nets, plastic crabs and lobsters, etc.).  To start we had Black and Blue Ahi, a crusted and seared ahi served with greens, which was just as tasty as it looked. We struggled choosing entrees, everything sounded delicious. I will say though, if you abstain from pork, let your server know. There were a couple of dishes that didn't list panchetta in the menu description that I scrapped from my list. He ended up going with the swordfish piccata, which was perfectly cooked and flaorful. I went wit the scallop risotto, so wonderfully decadent. The scallops were cooked beautifully.  With limited time in the city, I keep a short list of places I make a point of returning to. Scoma's has easily made that list. The steakhouse ambiance makes it an easy choice for a nice date, business meeting or fancier meal.",

I've been avoiding swordfish because of its previous avoid status on the Seafood Watch list, but our very competent waiter assured me this swordfish was handline caught, and I succumbed. One of my non-fish-loving dining companions was sorry that she'd ordered the mediocre steak instead of the swordfish. The other orders at my table included a decent pasta dish and a crab risotto, and both diners were quite happy with their orders. The bread slices were huge and really good. Next time I'll avoid the bread basket, lol, because half of my swordfish came home with me for lunch. :-) If you don't like seafood this is probably not the best place to eat. For seafood lovers, you could eat here every night for weeks before you'd make your way through all of the seafood entrees. I'm looking forward to going back.",

The bisque was completely smooth with no actual chunks of lobster meat. The fresh lobster meat on the side was only about the size of a quarter, but at least it tasted great. I was a little annoyed that my cup of soup was about 2/3 full.  My entree was linguine with diver scallops. They definitely didn't skimp on the fresh scallops, but the sauce wasn't memorable.  For dessert, I opted for the tiramisu. It came in an espresso cup, and while it was delicious, it was only about two bites. Tasty, but nothing special.  I'm glad we weren't rushed, but the service was incredibly slow and the atmosphere was too stuffy for me. Maybe it would have been better if we'd sat by a window to better enjoy the views.

After 45 minutes, the hostess said \"just another few minutes\".  After an hour of waiting, we were seated in the back portion of the restaurant, near a bus station. The bad part about this area is that there is a door that the waiters use to step outside and smoke. Unfortunately, they don't shut this door when they smoke and the smoke travels back into the restaurant. I mentioned this to our waiter, who basically ignored me.  The food was average. The experience was not good, and we will not go back.",

He said it tasted like old fish! Yuk!

I asked the 'keep if he needed us to settle or if we could carry the check to our table. \u00a0He looked at me like I had three heads and told me no, I needed to pay for my drink here. \u00a0ok ... so I ask for a check. \u00a0I got this gruff attitude, and he sticks the check in a plastic cup in front of the two of us and turns his back. \u00a0We know we are about to be called, so I put a bill in the cup. \u00a0From the size of the bill, I clearly had change coming, but the guy ignored it. \u00a0the cup sat. \u00a0our name was called and I was forced to flag him down. \u00a0It all felt kind of icky. \u00a0What can I say ... gut feeling.  Lunch itself was also a letdown. \u00a0I had crab cakes (they don't have this as an entree, only an app, so no sides for me.) \u00a0The crab was tiny slivers in too much filler and there were several shells. \u00a0Nothing turns off crab-cake love faster than shells. \u00a0His fish was .... meh. \u00a0Literally nothing to mention one way or the other, totally forgettable. \u00a0And if I can't even remember dessert (I can't, even looking at the menu) I can promise you it's bad. \u00a0b-a-n-a-n-a-s bad. \u00a0  Prices are just too high for the quality and service. \u00a0Scoma's is really not what it pretends to be. \u00a0There is so much potential ... a magnificent view if you are lucky to snag a window table, and a better than prime location. \u00a0but other than that, Scoma's feels run down and in need of some reworking.",

My first impression of the local restuarant tucked back in Al Scoma's Way was one of wonder. How cool it was to find a piece of \"old San Francisco\" hidden among the touristy confines of the Wharf. After my first meal at Scoma's I was hooked. I came back often and nine times out of ten I would order the blackened salmon. It became one of my favorite restuarants in SF and even had many of my \u00a0birthday dinners at my \"favorite\" spot.   But things have changed.....  A couple of years ago I knew the end was near when Scoma's replaced its bound menus to a one page laminate. The menu had been replaced and was scaled back. But the food was still excellent and I saw no reason to complain.  Until now......  Took a date my to old \"favorite\" restuarant last night. I talked it up all the way to our seated table. But once the food arrived I was sorerly disappointed. Gone was one of my favorite places to dine. Chalk it up to another place in disappearing San Francisco. My date and I shared the trio appetizer for two......it was disappointing but still looked forward to the main dishes. I couldn't wait to get my blackened salmon! My date ordered the once famous shellfish saut\u00e9. When it arrived It looked nothing like it did back when Scoma's cared about presenting quality dishes. My blackened salmon was an even bigger bummer. The size of my fish was a third the size it used to be. And it wasn't even blackened......the waiter offered to have it blackened but after I saw what was to come I thought to myself why even bother.   It just sucks forking over $150.00 (including a couple of cocktails) on mediocre food at best. What was once one of my favorite places to take my out of town friends and myself is no more. I have spoken to many other of my local friends and they all agree. Scoma's is no longer the restuarant that it used to be. And I will miss it.

Service was just okay. \u00a0Our waiter said they had a full bar and asked if we wanted a drink. \u00a0After walking through the crowds, that is exactly what we wanted! \u00a0I wasn't into the drink list and tried to order a Dark'n'Stormy which their bartender had never heard of it. \u00a0I found rather odd if they have a full bar but was good sticking to the menu. Our waiter really pushed the pre-fixed lunch menu saying it was a good value. \u00a0I was a bit hesitant but he said it had Scoma's best items. \u00a0We went for it, but in the end I am not sure if it was the right call. Also, at the end of our meal, we felt rushed as it appeared to be shift ending time.  The food was good and fresh. \u00a0Their clam chowder was very good and probably my favorite item. \u00a0I ordered the Combo Crab &amp; Shrimp Louis salad and my husband ordered the fish of the day (halibut). \u00a0The Crab &amp; Shrimp Louis was very fresh and I can see why it is a popular item. My biggest complaint is that I had shell pieces and quite frankly expect better from a restaurant of this quality. My husband's halibut was fresh, perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. \u00a0However, the cheddar polenta that was served with the fish was a bit heavy and didn't seem to fit with the dish. The raspberry desert cake was excellent and not too sweet.   With the service and pre-fixed menu choice, I am not sure we had the chance to really get the best taste of Scoma's.",

    "review_text": "Mediocre, overpriced seafood at astronomical prices!! \u00a0  This place is old-school, in the sense that it's a flashback to the restaurants of yester-year: \u00a0white table cloth, aging male servers who are politely brusque, middle-aged tourists and older diners who have had too many cocktails and have gotten a bit too loud for the comfort of their neighboring tables, uninventive \"classic\" recipes that all too often remind us of just how far this country has come recently in terms of culinary creativity...and therefore how much of a dinosaur this restaurant really is.  My biggest objection: \u00a0The prices. \u00a0$15 for shrimp cocktail??? \u00a0$7 for garlic bread???? \u00a0$16 for a spinach and goat cheese salad????? \u00a0 And most offensively, $26 for penne bolognese???????  It would be one thing if the food really were exquisite, an explosion of new, creative flavors in your mouth, the sensation of \"oh my GAWD this is SO GOOD, I can't eat enough of it!!!\" \u00a0But that's not what I felt here. \u00a0Instead, as I dined on a fairly by-the-book Lobster Newburg ($36), I couldn't help but wonder why I was feeling so \"meh\" about lobster, ie, my FAVORITE FOOD IN THE WORLD!!! \u00a0It was just sort of...bland. \u00a0And why the steep prices? \u00a0The portions weren't large. \u00a0The boring ol' steamed veggies on the plate didn't lend me any clues. \u00a0And my friend's flacid pasta didn't give me any answers, either. \u00a0The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't exciting. \u00a0And since we weren't sitting near a window, and it was also nighttime, it's not like we were enjoying any exquisite view. \u00a0  And then I remembered: \u00a0I'm on Fisherman's Wharf. \u00a0I never go here, because it's famous for one thing, and one thing only: \u00a0tourism. \u00a0Aha. \u00a0So when someone comes to San Francisco and opens a guide book, they see Scoma's listed as being located in a tony location on the wharf in what all their not-from-San-Francisco friends tell them is the area of the city they simply MUST go see (because certainly there is NOTHING to do in SF unless you see Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf!!! \u00a0Ooo, don't forget to buy an Alcatraz t-shirt!!!! \u00a0Otherwise, how will people know you've been to SF?!). \u00a0And they suddenly rationalize paying $26 for an average bowl of pasta and meat sauce. \u00a0Because after all, there WAS a white table cloth, so certainly this MUST be a classy joint, a San Francisco landmark!  Listen, people: \u00a0if you want to experience really good Italian food and/or seafood, there are a ZILLION better restaurants in San Francisco to go to. \u00a0A little research will reward you with a dinner at a far more delicious (and reasonably priced!) restaurant in town! \u00a0Sure, you may not be able to buy an \"Alcatraz Triathalon\" t-shirt on your walk back to the hotel, but you'll have a far more genuine and exciting culinary journey if you venture outside of the Fisherman's Wharf bubble. \u00a0Scoma's might've been what spelled class to your grandparents back in the day, but nowadays we've come so far from over-priced entrees made up of protein, pasta, and a heap of limp, favorless steamed veggies....",

If this place got a revamp, it would be so much better!  Ordered the lobster bisque, forgettable. Okay, honestly I don't even remember the name of the entree I got which is really sad considering I remember almost everything I eat. This is how forgettable the food was. I just remember it being overcooked fish with different sauces and broth that were all mixed together with some vegetables plopped around it. The dessert was not good - got the brownie.  Would never come back here, but the reason for 3 stars instead of 2 was for the service. The waiter we had was incredibly sweet. Although he didn't really pay attention to us, he was really nice when he did. It was a very casual and comfortable dining experience that I can see regulars coming in and ordering their favorites. The view is pretty nice, and the location is great if your'e a tourist and want to go walk around the pier aftewards. Okay, just to give you an idea about the unsatisfaction of this 3 course meal, I bought a whole steamed crab from the pier after and ate it all.",

It's nice to get away from the hussle and bussle of the touristy fishermans warf area and drive your car into valet parking, hop out, and get seated. We only waited about five minutes after having a opentable reservation. We were seated next to the waterfront and served with bread and water.  For appetizers, we started off with the crispy calmari. Lightly fried to perfection and so flavorful! The two options of dipping sauce: tartar sauce or cocktail sauce. YUM! Oh boy did it not disappoint! \u00a0I ordered The Diplomatica ($38) with linguine and red sauce. They don't mess around with seafood here and I found my plate with 2 lobster tails, a handful of clams, 5-6 scallops, and 2 shrimps. The sauce, the pasta, and the seafood was cooked to heavenly perfection. I could only finish half my plate! Bf ordered Steamed \"skookum\" Clams ($25) and comes with the biggest bowl topped with clams. The butter, garlic sauce is delicious and i found myself putting down the clams and just drinking the sauce!  If you're looking for a place for a business meal, birthday lunch, celebration, or a simple lunch and dinner, you will not be disappointed! The only thing that I get frustrated with are the stuck up waiters. The first time I came, I felt like the waiter was snobby. This past time, our waiter was even worse. When we inquired about the specials, he sarcastically said, \"everything on the menu is a special!\" Then proceeded to point out some things and laugh at the prices and said it was a \"good deal..sort of\" The only reason why we asked was because there were some dishes on yelp but we didn't see on the menu.. Anyway, after the meal when about to eat dessert, they usually take a knife and scrape off the crumbs. Nope, he didn't bother. Didn't felt taken care of at all by him. The other staff was very helpful on clearing our tables and refilling our drinks. I guess they make the most tip on large parties, business people, or \"fancier\" people drinking wine but he really didn't make us feel like we belonged there.   I give this place two thumbs up but prepared to spend $50+/person for dinner!",

    "review_text": "so my boss recommended this place based solely on their famous cioppino. Being italian i was intrigued, i'm from Boston and love seafood. I'm also italian and love italian food. Combining both was bound to be good. I was not disappointed!  First, this place is expensive. The bill for the soup alone came to around $50. But high cost does not diminish the experience. Scoma's is a CLASSIC place, the kind of place you want to take your wife on special occasions. Places like that are worth it.  Second, the ambiance is old town San Francisco from the North Beach of the 1960's. This is a place that the wise guys used to come for the best food around. I was most definitely in my element.   Third, the food... WOW. As soon as I ordered the cioppino Salvatore advised me that I didn't need to order anything else. Now I can eat but I got a little nervous about the breadstick i had eaten. When the food arrived I realized Salvatore was right, this was a huge bowl of seafood with a big slice of garlic bread. But having walked to the restaurant through the cold and wind i was ready. In fact that made it better, warm soup on a cold day. The broth was heavenly, i sipped most of the broth before I started on the fish. Now most fish in soups gets a little tough as it cooks. Somehow this fish was incredibly tender, the cod, the scallops, the clams and shrimp, it was all delicious.  Lastly, the people. Everyone was awesome! Salvatore was a true professional. Salvatore was hard working, knowledgeable, friendly. I was very lucky to have him as a server. Then the chef, Donnie Grey, came out and talked to me about the cioppino. Donnie was a great guy, very down to earth and friendly. He treated me like I was a celebrity!  Scoma's is a four star restaurant and a San Francisco landmark! I would highly recommend it if you're visiting with someone special and you want a romantic night out or you want to celebrate a special occasion....or if you just want GREAT food and service. i know I will be back whenever I am in San Francisco again.",

We arrived at approximately 4:20pm on a Saturday, and it didn't seem to busy. \u00a0The hostess greeted us, and we were waited on by Chris. \u00a0He had some good descriptions and recommendations from the menu. \u00a0Honestly, I was NOT planning on paying more than $15 for a pasta dish. UNTIL one of the servers passed by, and presented another table with a huge plate of seafood pasta! \u00a0The little devil on my shoulder said, \"Screw it you cheap bastard, you're gettin' that dish!\" \u00a0   I ordered the Diplomatica ($38), and this made for all the reason to write my review. \u00a0It had two small lobster tails, fresh shrimp, perfectly cooked soft scallops, and clams. \u00a0With linguine noodles drowning in a savory white cream sauce. \u00a0Maybe a bit too saucey, but just add some parmesan cheese and you're good! \u00a0So glad I tried this, and I had mega-leftovers! \u00a0  The gf ordered the Mixed Seafood Grill ($39) with penne pasta, rice, veggies, shrimp, scallops, and two small sized lobster tails. \u00a0You can tell all of the seafood were fresh because there were just juicy; Not overcooked, and again made perfectly well! \u00a0If you cannot decide on what to order, this huge dish will absolutely satisfy. \u00a0It's a mix of everything, so you can't really go wrong with this one.  Oh yeah, the appetizers: \u00a0The Calamari! \u00a0Soft and well breaded! \u00a0Another winner! \u00a0The sour dough was good, but I was expecting it to be warm. \u00a0No biggie!  Our server started out with Chris who was very polite and funny. \u00a0His shift ended and we were waited on by CC. \u00a0Both were well attentive, and always filled our water glasses. \u00a0One minor mistake was serving my Diplomatica to the gf and vice versa. \u00a0Also no biggie, but as a compliment we were given some Lady Fingers for free. \u00a0Those Lady Fingers were a nice crunchy sweet treat!  I'll absolutely come back, because there's much try like the \"Lazy Man's\" Cioppino and the King Salmon. \u00a0But if I were to recommend anything, it would be to try something that has shrimp or scallops, or both!",

Having grown up on the Chesapeake Bay, I've never had \"roasted\" crab, so this was a fun treat. \u00a0  I would definitely eat there again, if I ever make my way back out to San Francisco!",

    "review_text": "We decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary with dinner here and were thrilled with our evening. We started at the bar where I had a great Jamison and Ginger courtesy of Phil, the bartender. For dinner, hubby started with some clam chowder and we both agreed it was amazing! I started with a house salad which was simple yet so fresh that it was a perfect way to start the meal. Hubby chose the Cioppino which is something they are known for. It was a huge portion and could easily have been shared, but he thought it was wonderful. I had the grilled salmon with lobster ravioli and thought it was excellent. It was a perfect combination of decadence with light and healthy. Because our waiter knew that we were celebrating our anniversary, he brought us a wonderful chocolate dessert to finish off our evening.",

Where have the good seafood restaurants gone? They've turned into Scoma. Its tucked away so you have to hunt it down. That's a good thing.  Stormy managed to wolf down a garlic baked Dungeness Crab faster than I've ever seen her eat anything in my life. She almost passed out from the sheer bliss.  I had ok lamb chops (word guys... you must scrap the soot off the grill occasionally. Tasting ash on a chop or a steak is not a good thing!).  Great wine list. Surprisingly good beet, bleu and romaine salad to end the evening.",

Then, I got the rock cod (caught that day) and the person I was dining with got the scallops. \u00a0I will also say, that the scallops were some of the best scallops I have had. \u00a0My rock cod was great too! \u00a0I almost forgot the dungeness crab cocktail - not to be missed.

So me and my girlfriends got there and parked outside without the valet just becuase we didn't know they even had it. big mistake. I admit we should had researched the place before going becuase it would had saved us time and pain from our heels walking to that place that seemed secluded. \u00a0It took a 20 minute wait without reservation, which is good but all in all it was good.

Well, I can't completely blame them since it's in the touristy part of town. \u00a0  I like that this restaurant has valet parking and it is beyond spacious, but the whole atmosphere (wall decor, customers, employees) made me feel 20 years older than what I really am. \u00a0Other than that, the food was good.   We ordered: Dungeness Crab Cakes, Lobster Bisque, Char Broiled Fresh Ahi , Seared Dry Pack Sea Scallops on Linguine Pomodoro, Pumpkin Cheesecake, and Tirimisu  My favorites of the night were the crab cakes, lobster bisque (best I've had so far), and scallops. \u00a0I actually had scallops for lunch on the same day and the scallops here were wayyyyy better. \u00a0Why? Because the scallops were \"dry packed\", meaning there were no chemical additives which in effect tasted sweeter, bouncier, more flavorful, and more tender.   Thanks to Scoma's, I am now on a \"dry packed\" lookout.",

We ordered some oysters, seafood pasta, lobster ravioli, clams, calamari, and a mixed seafood grill. Everyone also had their own little bowl of clam chowder. I can honestly say that everything was delicious!!! Seafood was very fresh and portions are pretty big. I was stuffed after sharing all of that with 5 other people. On top of that, the service is also amazing. Just thinking about this place makes me want to go back! This is a must visit especially if your a tourist!",
