Subtle yet vibrant decor: red brick walls, wine rack, chalk art, hardwood ceiling, ambient lighting and minimally spaced seating, outdoor smoking cage, make this place a comfortable hang out spot after work hours during the week.   The bartenders are true mixologists in the art of the cocktail and as a trade off you must be patient for your drinks. If possible avoid the busy nights which typically are thursday thru saturday if you'd like to truly experience this place.   the ONE special is normally posted on the chalk board behind the bar but it's best to walk in with a list of drinks you'd like to try for the evening.   I normally take advantage of their \u00a0fresh selection of fruits by ordering a few rounds of blackberry lemon drops. Huckleberry when they are in season. As a side note, most drinks are misleadingly strong.",

The best cocktail my group tried tonight was \"The Flash\" by far. With gin,muddled kiwi, lemon, cucumber and sugar, it's dangerous. Dudes will be scared to order it because it comes in a pretty little delicate glass, but just suck it up and try it. It's amazing. I ordered the daily special, which included tequila, strawberry, lime and jalepeno and the bartender made sure to check to see that I liked it.   Rye has a regular mixing contest as well, so if you think you can beat this place at its own game head down and show them what you've got.   On Wednesday night, the place was buzzing but not bumping, just the way I like it. I was able to hear the excellent soundtrack playing over the ambient noise (Spoon, Wilco, Modest Mouse, oh yes).   One star docked for the sketchy neighborhood (maybe not a factor to some people but scary for me as a girl who has to walk back to her car/hotel alone), pretty high prices and limited sitting space.",

Rye's like that kid in school who was the first one to wear Windsor knots in their tie when everyone else's was skinny, the person in the office who knew all about True Blood before it crossed over to UK shores, the fashion-forward types who wear Buddy Holly glasses and quiff their hair, the student at uni who doesn't listen to a band unless fewer than four people have heard of them.  You want to acquaint yourself with their Pimm's Cup, especially if you're a British visitor. It's a fantastically interesting take on the usual lemonade, strawberries, orange, cucumber and mint combo we get over in Blighty and is very, very tasty. And if you're a fan of sharp, tangy cocktails like myself, the Basil Gimlet will be a treat for the senses. And at Rye, you get entertainment too. Those mixologists are darn good at their jobs, and watching the way they smash the fresh herbs before throwing them in the glasses is a joy.  They take their work very seriously too. A particularly good-looking female bartender was muddling lemons and said irritatedly to her colleague, \"These lemons suck!\" alluding to their freshness and the difficulty they had in yielding. A lesser worker wouldn't have mentioned it or even realised. As for the decor of the place, think bare brick, think industrial seating, think minimalism - think a blank canvas for a group of flamboyant, creative young individuals to descend upon and call their own. Marvellous! Also the free Chex Mix lining the bar in bowls is tops, and there are M&amp;Ms and sweets to munch on too. All just there. Free to take. That's SF, baby.",

Basically, this girl tried to sneak in the door when someone was leaving and the kick-ass bouncer grabbed her and told her (and 3 of her friends that tried to join her) that they couldn't get in. \u00a0He even shouted to the other bouncers and those 4 people were flagged for the rest of the night. \u00a0Pure awesome.  Came here on a saturday night after we couldn't get into Ambassador due to multiple birthday parties (ie. line too long), even after above birthday girl was kicked out of line.  The line at Rye wasn't all that long, and the bouncer, I believe his name was Quentin, (and his friend) were really friendly. \u00a0One of the friends of the aforementioned birthday girl apparently had been at Rye before so got in immediately, but the awesome Quentin told her dudeguy friend that he had to wait in line like every one else, cuz Quentin remembered the girl but knew that dudeguy friend was trying to fool him. \u00a0Uh-uh, Quentin's not gonna take that crap. \u00a0I was not-so-secretly smiling, mostly because I was next in line and freezing (even with a coat on!)  Anyway, once inside, the place was nice, though crowded near the bar. \u00a0We sat down (yeah, there was actually space) in the lower level but it was freakin' cold cuz the door to the outdoor smoking area kept opening. \u00a0Naturally, we left after getting tasty drinks that were not very expensive at all ($6 for soco w/ lime) so I was happy. Maybe too happy...  But no dancing, so we left for Le Colonial later on.  Still, the bouncer dude was cool. And I like tasty fruity drinks from Rye (costs around $10+ each)",

As the name implies, expect to have drinks that are mainly based whiskey based, but trust me; they're creative. I had a drink that infused lime, maple syrup, and whiskey in a way that allowed me to savor the flavor inherent in the whiskey, aided by a few notes of sweet and sour.

Do not have the door to the aforementioned unpleasant bathroom right in the middle of the main lounge. It's a great way to dampen atmosphere and make everyone uncomfortable.  4.

If I have to wait more than 7 minutes to get my drink at any place in the City, I leave. I think it's fair - I mean, do you really want to have a drink at a place that's THAT crowded anyway? Well, at Rye, it has been more than once that I had to give up on a beverage. The place gets incredibly busy for the tiny bar with only 1, sometimes 1.5 working bartenders (.5 for the guy who is too busy washing up, although occasionally he does seem to serve beers).   Don't get me wrong - the bartenders are not even rude like at some other places, and the female ones are actually quite friendly. The place just gets too damn busy for its size, and then it's \u00a0- well, just forget it. Even the poorly reviewed (by me) Ambassador across the street is an easier place to wet the throat.   What else? Design of the place is just so-so, I can't quite decide whether I like the 2-section setup or not. Up front, well, there is the monkey-zoo of a bar, with a fairly useless pool table in the back. I've only seen someone play pool there once, and there are no seats to make anyone want to stick around.   The back section has seats, but there are too few of them, and standing there is just not cool. The female toilet is located right at the back wall. The best area to hang, unfortunately, is the smoking section in the patio, caged away from the Tenderloin in the perfectly appropriate zoo fashion. But is is tiny as well, it is cold on most San Francisco nights and you do have to hang out in the filthy smoke.   On weeknights, when it's calmer and you can actually get a drink and situate yourself on one of the seats in the back, it can be a fairly pleasant stopover on a TRenderloin bar-hopping route.   Extra star for the drink selection. Some are quite inventive, if a bit pricey for the location. I like the one called Apple Bomb. Not sure if they have rye, but I'll ask the next time.

It's not the kind of place I would go for a rocking good time, and if I'm trying to have a chi-chi sophisticated evening, I still wouldn't come here. \u00a0Especially because the glasses they serve cocktails in are so small that they have to fill them to the top, and you end up spilling half the vodka all over yourself. \u00a0Not because you're drunk, but because your name ain't exactly Grace.

The bartenders here are true mixologists. I can't even name all the crazy concoctions we had. Some of them had raw egg whites in them.

The Basil Gimlet is a delicious mixture of gin, basil, lime juice, and agave nectar. Although it tastes sweet and can't taste much of the alcohol, it sure is there. I think I might like The Flash more, which had gin, kiwis, lemon juice, and cucumber. You can really taste the cucumber and the kiwi after you take a sip and it tastes very fresh. The Flash wasn't as strong as the Basil Gimlet. I loved both though because I really like gin.  A big plus here was that they serve free snacks!

It's so new that they haven't yet equipped themselves with a credit card machine. It was a good time. We spent the entire night monopolizing the outdoor spot enclosed with a cage-like door (aka the Monkey Cage). It makes for perfect people watching...Similar vibe to Rosewood (which makes sense that they're owned by the same people). Definitely a welcome addition to the Tender Nob neighborhood. Plus, the location allows you to top off the evening with some grub from Osha next door.",

The detail that was put into this place is really a joy, because it is anything but precious.  The drinks are classics, but with a creative handmade twist. If you know and love the lower east side's Milk &amp; Honey, you'd be pleased to find this place. Who takes the time to muttle blackberries?! Um, they do.

Located on Geary and Leavenworth, right around the same neighborhood as Swig, Hi-Tide, and Cortez, the bar is sleek and modern, yet very welcoming.   There is a definitive wood motif going on, and the wine wall is a cool touch as well, plus they have a nice pool table too. There is also a designated outdoor area that looks right out onto Geary, very cool at night to watch passersby.  The bartenders are super friendly and fun, but more importantly know how to mix a drink. I had a perfect dirty martini, served with 209 Gin, with 2 meaty olives, hard to beat that. They also use fresh fruits for their cocktails - as somewhat of a self-stylized professional drinker, I earnestly believe that can make all the difference.",

    "review_text": "Why Rye, why!?  Why are you located in such a sketch area??  Thankfully, I was with an individual who doubled as my bodyguard. I already had my cocktail-crazed eyes glued to the $10 PIMM'S CUP #5, a house-made recreation of the original Pimm's No. 5 with a rye whiskey base, lemon, english cucumber, mint, ginger syrup, and seltzer. Ultimately, my friend decided on the special written on the board: the $11 \"This Ancho First Rodeo (?)\" made with 1.5 bourbon, 1 ancho chili liquor, 0.5 creme de cacao, 0.5 lemon, a dash of angostura bitters, with egg white, topped with bourbon barrel aged beer (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rye-san-francisco?select=12AM0e4ypK1M9g7KpOKVZA#12AM0e4ypK1M9g7KpOKVZA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rye-\u2026</a>). And, staying true to its name, he asked for his drink as a question ahaha.  I adored their rendition of the Pimm's Cup #5, which I would colloquially describe as a strongly gingerfied mojito with rum swapped out for whiskey. After some Wiki research, I learned that Pimm's Cup is a fruit cup, an English-specialty long drink comprised of a spirit base (#5 uses rye whiskey) and a soft drink (ginger syrup in this case). Despite it being labeled a starter rather than a cocktail (thanks for calling my palate a wimp, Rye), the drink harmoniously highlighted the duo of mint and ginger, the perfect partners-in-crime for masking the taste of alcohol. The bartender muddles...smashes some real ginger into the drink, and he sticks in a cucumber peel to seal the deal. Ooh I should request smashed cucumber in it next time. Mint + ginger + cucumber = EPIC TRIFECTA.  My friend said that the egg white in the Ancho First Rodeo (?) lends to the creamy froth of the drink, but not so much the flavor. The bourbon went down smoothly and paired well with the blend of light ancho chili and cacao creme, sprinkled with some dark cacao bits. I didn't really taste the lemon or ango, but perhaps the chocolate and cream dimensions outweighed the citrus. This was a drink that grew on me, mhmmm.  Menu: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rye-san-francisco?select=12AM0e4ypK1M9g7KpOKVZA#2nQxi8z9lnRTLxy9oPooeQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rye-\u2026</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rye-san-francisco?select=12AM0e4ypK1M9g7KpOKVZA#GZxIG2JgFp37d46UsKV2Fw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rye-\u2026</a>  Random facts: They have a lone restroom in the back, next to the humongous chalkboard (omg we forgot to leave our marks! Too busy moving on to the next one...next time grr), which is also next to the pool table. The seating includes bar seats, some small tables in the side area and back, and chairs along the side wall. It can get cushy, but it never got crowded. Oh, and they have an open air porch in the front of the venue...which comes off more as a prison for smokers =__=  tbh, I enjoyed Rye's drinks as much as I enjoyed the Alembic's, and I would give them 5 stars...but, y'know, I don't think 2 drinks is a large enough sample size. I need to have tried a representative variety of drinks so that I can appropriately evaluate this cocktail bar with statistical significance. A very valid reason to return to Rye, o' course.   Which means a return to the Tenderloin...why Rye, whyyyyyyyyyy.",

It was quite refreshing, the basil flavor was perfectly prominent. Ten dollars for that was well worth it because it was something new that I have never tried. My fellow lounger ordered the Flash with muddled kiwi and cucumber...that was even MORE refreshing. More citrusy than cucumbery. If you haven't tried the Basil Gimlet or Flash, I'd recommend those. Oh, and 4 kamikaze shots is roundabout 28. First time trying it, and it's pretty tasty! Someone else ordered a Stella which was $5.   The alcohol content in the drink was well-balanced...there wasn't a strong taste of alcohol, but it was not a cocktail that tasted like juice. Bravo.   We had an underage lady in our group, but she was allowed to go in since no one checks the ID until you actually order at the bar. We went on a Wednesday night and it was not crowded at all.

Every once in a while you want to get a little bit dressed up and go somewhere kinda swanky where they serve something other than Pabst on tap and the lighting is dim so you look way hotter. The basil gimlet is delish--I probably had one or five too many by the way judging by the way I feel today, but it was totally worth the hangover and I'd do it all over again. The only reason Rye doesn't get a full 5 stars is because the bouncer let in that relentless bitch at the pool table who was so not cool the whole night. Gotta weed out the riff raff Rye...there are plenty of bars in the city for WT fat chicks to hang and shoot pool. Other than that, great place...I'll be back.",

This place specializes in Whiskies and Scotches and carry a good amount of both.  The only reason this place isn't get 5 stars is because I ordered a Rye Whiskey \"Neat\" and the girl made it wrong :-\\. She mixed my whiskey with ice then drained the ice out... So i got watered down whiskey which made me sad but it was still good... Just would have been better if it had been neat (no ice, water etc just straight whiskey/scotch).",

It takes a pretty intensely snobbish atmosphere for me to take heart to such a thing, and this was not one of those situations.  It was a little pricey, but isn't everything in San Francisco? In SF, I feel a lot like I do in New York - from the second I land at the airport, I open my wallet and the city sucks out its contents like a vacuum.   Our bartender wasn't exactly a beaming light of sunshine and smiles, but she was patient with us non-regulars and helpful with suggestions.

You wouldn't BELIEVE how many people don't want me around. But my compatriots were a bit more savvy. Instead of running home and sobbing into their pillows, they looked around. There was no one at the door, no list, nothing to indicate that there was in fact a private party.   So we ignored her and ordered an Aviation, a Spiced Ginger, and a Grey Lady. Now, I've said this before: I'm not a cocktail guy. But as the saying goes, when in Rome...order some sort of girly drink.  Our bartender was actually a pleasure to watch. She wasted nary a movement and was clearly very knowledgeable. Also, the end result was fantastic. It turned out my Aviation was not girly in the least. It kind of rocked.   Perhaps I'm entering a new chapter in my life, one where I will indulge in fewer, but higher quality cocktails. Or perhaps I will continue to drink forties, Popov, Ten High, and be the drunk we all know I am. It's like 80/20 in favor of the latter.  Armed with superior cocktails, we stepped out into the small screened-in patio area. It quickly became apparent our friend at the door had not been hallucinating, and there had been a private party. The remnants of a catered dinner were strewn about, and nearly everyone in the bar was whammered.   Some Drunk Girl was out there swaying up a storm. When she noticed that one of my companions smoked, she came over, played around with an empty box of cigarettes that had been left on the table, and then worked up the courage to ask for one. As a peace offering, she said, \"I have an open bar tab...\"   I'm cutting the rest of that story off, as it's not interesting enough* to share. But Rye seems like an exceptional place for cocktails, provided that you don't have to deal with Some Drunk Girl. ___________  *Certainly not because I drank too much and don't remember the rest of it.",

I could live out here and she could live in there.\"    \u00a0 \u00a0 we laughed, all knowing that it may actually be a great spot for him, this cage.    \u00a0 \u00a0 he said, \"I'll shit over there in the corner and just spray it off with a hose.\"    \u00a0 \u00a0 Eric asked, \"what would you use to hose it off, Tom?\"    \u00a0 \u00a0 Tom replied, \"hell, I'll shit over there in that corner!\"    \u00a0 \u00a0 Eric interrupted Tom's scowled expression as Tom sat hunched over and pointing with an index finger at the corner and said, \"you could fling your shit, Tom. \u00a0you could fling it across the street\" and again, we all laughed.   \u00a0 \u00a0 Tom continued, \"yeah, hell man, you could put a tire swing out here\" and as he was saying this, looking up languorously, an effortless vision arose in all of us featuring Tom swaying back and forth hanging onto a braided rope, hanging on with one hand, his feet resting atop a beat up BF Goodrich knobby tread tire. \u00a0we were envisioning him swinging around like a great ape, flinging shit out onto Geary street. \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 Eric was smoking a cigarette and I was watching Tom sway back and forth with a dark and stormy in my hand. \u00a0I had on a hoodie. \u00a0it was one of those nights when everyone recognizes you and says things like, \"so, you're Ben's Dad! \u00a0I know Ben from when his company was sued by some other big company, something about trade secrets.\" \u00a0it was one of those nights when the bartender kisses you right on the mouth and mountains move and the particles creating blank space try to hold strong together, swimming around the room.    \u00a0 \u00a0 I guess it was about 1:30 when we managed to leave the bar. \u00a0I walked courageously, laughingly stumbling all the while, out into oncoming traffic to summon a cab. \u00a0we got into the cab and while being attacked by the rubber lining of the door I said, \"hey man, your car is falling apart\". \u00a0Tom leaned over childishly and whispered, \"ma'am - not man\". \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 I looked up and I saw one eyeball, her right eyeball, and a pair of cherry red lips glancing back at me with indifference from the rear-view mirror. \u00a0I named the cross-streets and she drove off. \u00a0we went an interesting and new direction, one that I may have refuted at 1:30 PM with a clear head but at that moment, we did not give a fuck. \u00a0we laughed at nothing (nothing, being things like direction or red lights or a man with a boom box and a headband strolling up McAllister). \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 it didn't matter to us. we were on the cusp of this night. \u00a0we were riding it the way we've always known to ride it, not forgetting where we came from. \u00a0that is exactly the thing that got us here. \u00a0that got us out here to California, and it was never an easy ride. \u00a0leaving is never easy. \u00a0poking your head through some doorway, looking to both sides before entering not knowing if something is coming at you or not is never easy. \u00a0but there we were, exiting the cab toward the curb so we didn't get run over in the middle of the street. \u00a0the crazies were out. \u00a0we were them. \u00a0we were tough and knew it, and therefore did not go looking for it. \u00a0we were hungry but not tired. \u00a0we were full of what it is to be jazz. \u00a0we were proud, and we were back. there is no changing that. \u00a0not tonight or any other night. \u00a0we were swept away by a blood lust haze of fog gathered in the street lights of the lower haight. \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 and so we were granted entrance into the night, the true night as it were, by that little brick encrusted bar at geary and leavenworth. \u00a0without the spiral, there wouldn't be a ride and soon, without fail, I will be right there at the gate of that steal lined wooden door to get my ticket from a man named Q wearing a stocking cap and a smile. \u00a0I will order strong beverages from the beautiful people behind the bar and I'll be at the helm once again, knowing what it is to float above normalcy.",

This translates into free appetizers, and the first drink being on the house. Plus of course fostering a fun, festive party atmosphere. #2 I knew one of the judges, so got hand-fed the drinks that were being rated in the contest for a few hours. These were *amazing* btw (but don't ask me to recount what they were). I DO remember that the complementary margarita I got to start was also very good. Not mojito...margarita... #3 As a result of #2, I got to meet the owner who was just WAY cool. Super nice, explained the different drinks and why they worked with different ingredients. Oh, and I also got to feel really important hanging with the judges, and really happy and festive due to the hand-feeding.  I'd be curious to know what the music is like on nights when the competitions aren't happening. But I have a feeling it'd still be a great experience: the alcohol is good, the service is friendly, and the decor is hip. On this last point: a nice touch is the fact that the \"smoking room\" is in the front with open windows, which makes the addicts feel less marginalized as they subsequently are perched just adjacent to the Tenderloin sidewalk. It just makes everyone happier. That, plus the spirits, of course.",

Other panty meltin' mind grapes regarding Rye:  - Dimly lit. Perfect for a make-up monster like myself. A little goes a long way and I appreciate that.  - STRONG drinks. I probably could have gotten away with just a couple stripes of eye-liner now that I'm trying to recall the rest of the evening. Not looking so hot? NBD. Buy yourself and your date a drink. Both of you will stop caring about that extra fun but feckless sh*t real fast.   - Sit in the caged 'Alfresco' area if you're a big zoo fan. I'm an animal, natch, so this area was a fun one to let my imagination run wild in. And after a few cocktails, you might have more than your imagination going wild. Keep your tops on, girls. This is still a classy place. Or don't- whatever, I don't really mind either way. \u00a0   - Speaking of chests, most of the cocktails will put hair on your chest.

The place blends in well, so it's not loud or showy from the outside. It makes it a little incognito if you do a quick drive by down Geary, making it easy to miss. Not such a big fan of the unisex bathrooms. In drinking establishments there should be one bathroom dedicated to the cleanlier sex. Two single stall bathrooms didn't seem sufficient for the amount of crowd that streamed in. Two bartenders were working their tails off trying to keep up with orders and the complicated drinks. The server was also working extremely hard to get \u00a0all those drinks \u00a0distributed, but with the crowd that came in on Saturday night, you would think they would up their staff numbers.

The dark interior and the lower seating area as well makes this place swankier than most bars in this 'hood. They have a good drink selection and when it's not packed to the gills I'd imagine this would be a good place for a date.  Overall, I would recommend this place to people looking to gather folks for a drink.",

It was starting to get pretty crowded, with people crowded around the bar talking, not exactly ordering drinks.  The bartender in my section really took her sweet time, and refused to look at anyone or acknowledge anyone while she very VERY slowly made her drinks. When she finally got to me I asked her what drinks come with the fresh fruit that was in front of her, and I got a menu shoved in my face as she turned her back on me. I think it would've taken all of 5 seconds to suggest a drink, but apparently me and my friends weren't worth that.  So after that I sent the bf to the bar to get us drinks, where he was basically ignored completely by the same bartender. She'd take the drink order of the guy on his left, then the one on his right, then the guy on his left again. I got all worked up about it and made everyone leave without even trying the fresh fruit drinks that everyone has been raving about, which was kind of disappointing.   And maybe the timing was bad, but all the beautiful people either haven't shown up yet, or have realized that this bar has crappy service and moved onto the next hot spot...",

I've been a little nervous about ordering one from just anywhere- I was waiting for the place that looked like it could handle it expertly. Rye did. The bartender was quick and efficient, and the drink was amazing. He definitely made it right, and it even came in the chilled pewter cup, the traditional way.

FREE!! i know we were all a drunk mess but the staff was still very accomodating and patient with us haha. it does seem however, that they focus so much on their specialty drinks that they can't make normal ones [ie AMF, 4 horsemen, they don't carry goose or belvedere]. the tokyo tea and long islands were ridiculously strong. like... forgot the second half of my birthday strong. \u00a0  overall, it was an awesome night. they let my roomie collect a few candles so i could blow them out at midnight haha. thanks to the staff for making my birthday one to [kind of] remember!",

Picked this place to gather some friends for a pre bday showdown in the hopes of facing the last days of my still very youthful status with grace and it turned out to be an overall successful celebration! Just a few annoying things but I was a very happy camper at the end of the night! And my friends all had a great time too!  My PROS: 1) No dress code and no cover! 2) Awesome crowd - friendly, patient, non pissed off mix of patrons even though everyone and their brothers, sisters and cousins were crowding the bar! 3) What others have been saying about the bartenders is true - friendly bunch and mixes great drinks! 4) At least they have one little table with a few seats that doesn't require a bottle service reservation located near the pool table area. Thank goodness a couple of friends got there a little early and snagged it! 5) Pool table!!! \u00a0No fees to use it! No fights over it either! \u00a0Good distraction. 6) Clean bathrooms! 7) There's an outdoor cage for smokers with a couple of small 2-person bar type tables.  My CONS: 1) Dang it was packed when we arrived at about 10 on a Saturday night! Not a lot of places to sit so beware ladies who decide to wear stilletos into this venue! \u00a0I think the lounge area requires bottle service because two friends got booted out when they tried to sit. I didn't think they'd require a reservation for seating but I guess they do... oh well... (correction: bottle service is not usually required but the night I came I guess someone reserved all of the tables) 2) so packed it could take anywhere from 10-20 minutes to get a drink at the bar 3) They measure their drinks to the tee but guess what their drinks are pretty awesome (well at least the ones I ordered were!) 4) Aww pretty good music but no dance floor?   It's more of a bar or club that's missing a dance floor than a lounge because you can't really have a normal convo without yelling at your companion. \u00a0However, I think with the exception of the few annoyances I was entirely happy with my experience here at this bar. \u00a0Too bad the actual lounging area may require bottle service Saturday nights though (correction: nope, bottle service usually not required but you are able to reserve all their tables if you wanted to). \u00a0Drink prices were decent; they aren't wallet breaking, at least in my opinion... but hopefully that doesn't mean there was a calculation mistake in there somewhere! 2 jack shots, 4 kamikazes, 1 vodka cocktail - all for $50!

I was expecting green, obviously. \u00a0The watermelon-cuke-basil flavor was excellent. \u00a0Sweet and cool. \u00a0Next we tried the Widow's Walk - made with rye, du bonnet, strawberries, lemon and something else. \u00a0This was a very interesting drink and smelled like fermentation. \u00a0Very yeasty. \u00a0But I finished mine and half of my friend's. \u00a0She went back for another green thumb. \u00a0YUM. \u00a0Both of these were $10 each so it's not cheap, but each cocktail is so expertly made and tastes so wonderful that it's worth it. \u00a0I'll try the gimlets that everyone is talking about next time.

Best nights are during the week, it gets extremely crowded here on the weekends and you'll wait a long time for a drink.  The mixologists here are top notch and meticulous in their preparation; like a well-oiled machine. Incredible list of cocktails. Order the basil gimlet, you will not be disappointed.

I do have to say that the bouncer was very nice and friendly, I have a thing about that and it's always nice when the first person you meet in a place is friendly and gives you a nice smile. However it was pretty much the last bit of friendliness I experienced that night at Rye. It's packed and you have to wait forever to order your drink. It's full of people who are there to be cool and frankly just about the only good thing about getting older is that you no longer feel the need to be part of that scene so I was very much over Rye in about five minutes. I am going to give them an extra star because the place is very nice looking, the staff was friendly and the pool table was free. I have a feeling this place might better on other nights of the week but on a Friday night it sucked.",

The fact that there isn't much on the inside actually makes for a really great drinking atmosphere. No one wants a cocktail bar where people just sit down and stay down all night.  When you're sloppy, you might as well be mingling by the bar, dancing in between the few tables, or pretending to be a caged lion on the smoking patio.

She then finished the drinks and walked away. We had to call out to her and follow her across the bar to pay for the drinks.

I told her to make me anything she wanted and she gave me the most delicious cucumber infused drink called the Amoure. The next time I went in though, the bartender hadn't heard of it but made me a muddled kiwi and cucumber confection that still makes my heart jump. Plus any bar that plays indie rock without being pretenious in a city like San Francisco, gets double points my book.  I also had a company party there and it was open bar so I got to drink and try a million of their muddle magnificence (well it felt like a million the morning after). Everytime I go the bartenders are helpful, cheery, and willing to make you a delicious drink if youre overwhelmed with the marvelous selection of fresh fruits waiting to be muddled. It's fun to just grab a drink, settle into the leather seat next to the brick wall and people watch the cage (the smokers spot) or the door in the Tendernob without dealing without too much B&amp;T crowd or the annoying.",

    "review_text": "This could possibly be the hardest five stars a bar has ever earned, because man-oh-man, was this just not my normal cup of tea.\n  After dinner at Canteen, we decided to head over to Rye because, well, it's named Rye. Let me explain. If you're from the East Coast, especially the New York/New England/Pennsylvania area, you probably have some ancestral memory lodged deep in your mind about the virtues of rye whiskey. For those of us from the Northeast, Rye is our historical tipple of choice. Unfortunately, as a result of many years of marketing from the bourbon and vodka vendors, this perfect grain distillate had faded out of vogue.\n  But there is hope - in the late 1990s, Anchor Distillery launched a single malt rye whiskey - and since then a number of great rye whiskeys have come back onto the scene. So with this in mind, when I heard about Rye, I decided to make a trip out there.\n  The bar is beautiful, more East Coast than West - Scandinavian designed with wood accents everywhere. Down to every detail, the place screams \"The Bubble Is Back! Long Live The Internet Bubble!\"\n  But just on the promise that they may have rye, we went in.\n  The crowd was, well, horrible. Yuppie trash that decided to go out slumming in the Tendernob. Screeching bleached blonds and boisterous jock assholes vying for attention and hoping to get laid.\n  But they had rye, and we could get two seats at the corner of the bar near the door in case we needed to make a quick getaway.\n  It was at that point that I recalled what I thought about Paris: a beautiful city, if you could just get rid of the damned Parisians. Same thing goes for Rye.\n  Our bartender, Jennifer, was the saving grace of the night. In between churning out 7&amp;7s, Rum and (Diet) Cokes, 7 and Waters, Gin and Tonics, Stoli Vanillas and Ginger Ale and other drinks better suited for frat parties than a sophisticated bar like this, she served up some of the most amazing Manhattans (Jim Beam Rye, Noilly Prat Sweet (Red) Vermouth, Peychoud Bitters and a single sour cherry) - possibly the best I have ever had. She admitted that she had a soft spot for that cocktail, and she treated it with the respect that it deserved.\n  We went in planning on having one, or at the most two drinks total, as we didn't hit the ATM before heading in (yes, they are cash only for now). By the time we left, we had each had four - because I don't think either we or the bartenders wanted the night to end.\n  As we left, we mentioned to Jennifer that she was the saving grace for the bar because she made the crowd there \"tolerable\".\n  So, here is the breakdown:\n  The bar - The atmosphere, architecture and sense of style is great, and the inclusion of both an outside cage (where we saw a blond chickie climbing up and comically (to us) trying to sexily writhe for her man) for smokers and a pool table warrants a definite 5 out of 5. Hopefully next time we'll see someone smack into the wall-length mirror thinking there is another bar on the other side of the wall.\n  The bartenders - Everyone we had there was amazing, not only making great Manhattans, but muddling a pair of perfect Basil Gimlets (vodka) and a house drink called a Gold Rye Fizz - a rye drink with mandarin oranges, rye, bitters and a splash of cream as a substitute for the missing Advocaat/Eierlikor/Egg Liquor. Jennifer gets extra points for gracefully dropping a whole lemon in a martini glass full of Absolut Citron - the perfect \"lemon drop\" in my book. 5 out of 5\n  The selection - 5 out of 5 - this is a hard one. The beer was well selected, but I still winced when seeing someone order a can of Tecate (the crowd was mostly drinking Stella, but a good number of Chimays came out of the fridge). A number of good whiskeys were available with the well rye being Jim Beam Rye (yellow bottle). Some bimbettes wanted Crown Royal, which they were out of, or didn't carry... which thoroughly distressed them but amused us.\n  The crowd - 1 out of 5, and if I could give lower scores, I would. Loud, annoying, drunk and the sort of people that makes me reconsider ever going back there, even though I loved the place. Once this crowd finds the \"next greatest thing\" I am sure it will be a much more tolerable group of folks frequenting the bar.",

    "review_text": "This place is kinda stupid. I took a friend there last night looking for something different than our neighborhood favorite, and was, at first, a little disgusted. Later, I was just humored by the ridiculousness of my experience.   We scored a couple of barstools--a stroke of luck on a Saturday night--and sat down. The bar-back cleared the empty glasses in front of us, but didn't bother to wipe the bar, so our hands, when we rested them there as people do, rested in the sticky residue of whatever the people before us had been drinking and spilling. Not what I want after paying $15 for an ounce-and-a-half of whiskey. If you're going to charge that much, you better pay your staff to do a very good job.   We ordered two Yamazakis, ice on the side. The bartender said something like, \"you have to be some of the most particular drinkers out there,\" which seemed a little weird because whiskey, relative to the haute-cocktail culture in SF, is pretty straightforward regarding the bartender: pour and serve. No frills. Then he mentioned something about his father and Scotch and cigars, and how he wouldn't drink unless he had a smoke and a place to sit. I guess my buddy and I triggered this bartender's daddy issues. (Look, pal. I'm sorry your dad was a particular asshole, but I just want you to pour my drink. If I think you're a good bartender and I want to trust you, maybe I'll tell you about my father, and I'll tip you for listening and pretending to give a shit. Until then, shut up and pour and don't tell me I'm \"particular\".)   The place looks great, all concrete and wood, brick and glass. I'm not a fan of the wall art, but that's just a preference. Also, they have gender-neutral restrooms. This is a telling detail. It's telling because no woman in her right mind would venture into a bar restroom that men are also allowed into. I think they have a ladies' room, too, but the question remains, 'why, for a place with classy decor, do they make gender-neutral restrooms?' Rye needs a men's room and a ladies' room. The men can spray the fucking ceiling with their piss-drunk piss, and the women can have a safe place to sit. Don't invite women to go into the men's room. It's not classy.  Above the bar at Rye, amongst all the back-lit bottles, is a glass tankard of kitschy rye tincture. It's flavored with citrus and spice and smells like Christmas. Stay away from it. It tastes like Triaminic. The bartender was nice enough to pour a round of shots on the house when I asked for a taste, and I appreciated that gesture. That's good bartending, and, along with the interior design, it earned the place a second star from me. But, the shit is shwag. You don't have to have a rye tincture if you're going to call your bar Rye. You do have to have a reasonable selection of Ryes, though, which I can only assume the place does. I don't think I'll be going back there to find out. If you're going to charge me $15 for a couple of ounces from a bottle that retails for $45, I expect to be drinking on a clean bar in a classy establishment. Ostensibly though it tries, the attempt is specious.",

Drinks were well made and tasted good. The basil gimlet was good although I'm not quite sure what the fuss is about...the Carovello is the drink I would go back for; it had much more complex flavor and texture (from frothed egg white) and was really well balanced.  Things that happened that I wish wouldn't have:  * I was asked to pay up after the first round. I like the offer to start a tab. Asking to pay up after the first round means \"you're done after this. right?\"  *The menu was whisked away after every order. I don't like to have to keep asking for it. Also tends to mean, \"you're done. right?\"  * The bartender chucking empty bottles REALLY hard into the bin (especially when there's no one in there). Very jarring and unpleasant.

I forgot what I ordered but it was their special drink of the day with dragonfruit vodka. I really liked the drink. The drinks are expensive at around $9-11.   What my friends noticed though is that all of our drinks had mint, so in the end, our drinks were like mojitos. (Not to discredit Rye's drinks.)  They have 1 bathroom and it's clean when I went in there.  If you want to try new and interesting cocktail drinks, give Rye a shot.",

The bartender regained her composure, took our order and served up a perfect rye Manhattan and a Flash with lots of kiwi and a refreshing cucumber garnish. \u00a0On top of it all she only charged us happy hour prices! \u00a0What a gal!",

I think \"Rye\" is maybe for their wry sense of humor. \u00a0  What you get is your standard tendernob/loinhill bar - slash - lounge. with your usual vodkas, gins, and a couple whiskeys only. stark chic with no substance. \u00a0dark sleek walls, concrete floors, sticky tables, you know the drill. \u00a0The 'signature' cocktails list seemed a bit confused, not only were they seriously missing the firewater but no booze list. well i guess they don't really need one since there's nothing notable on the shelves to refer to. \u00a0 My gimlet tasted strange. \u00a0and so did the other two even less memorable cocktails i had. \u00a0their bottled stella tasted like bottled stella.   The iron cage out front makes this place stand out from swig and the others down the street. \u00a0nice touch. \u00a0except that it adds to their whole creating the false illusion that you will find caged barrels overflowing with bourbon inside. \u00a0sigh. \u00a0and sitting in the patio inside the cage does make one feel like an animal, and not in a good way, but more like a creature held captive at a zoo exhibit. \u00a0also, if you can suffer the smoke long enough to sit out there, expect to get panhandled on, which is another mind-jarring experience. \u00a0me behind bars and the downtrodden strolling free back and forth and hitting me up for cash.   and on this particular night, someone had their giant cream colored lab crossed with a st. bernard looking dog with them. \u00a0it was certainly grand to look at. and i wanted to pet it too like everybody else. \u00a0but i am allergic and so i tried to stay away. \u00a0but those were some tight quarters in there. \u00a0and the hives that that furry creature caused me all over my face and neck, arms and legs really helped keep that good feeling all night. \u00a0(think what's his face in that last scene in there's something about mary.) if it wasn't the hives, it was moving across the street to swig that really did the night in. \u00a0did YOU know that the tendernob turns into a suburbia-in-the-city-gala event on the weekends?? seriously, prom dresses and all.",

My disappointment was quickly handled via tried and true bar first aid...I applied Glenmoranghie to the wound liberally...\n  Now Rye seems to be noted for it's mixed drinks...I will say that I am not been much of a mixed cocktail guy of late - I'm settling into a more refined stage in my drinking evolution (the expensive, tasty, hard stuff on the rocks) - but, I was given a cocktail when my scotch glass runneth dry and while it did have peach something-or-the-other in it (which usually instantly provokes projectile vomiting) it was quite tasty and so doing what I do, I drank it...I never did quite catch the name of it but it was like a fine dessert after a meal of scotch and topped off the evening in a fine fashion.\n  The venue is interesting and I will have to go back to check the vibe on a weekend as a Wednesday night is generally not indicative of a bars true character but I will say that what I saw I liked.",

The mint julep comes all fancy in a metal cup, and they have fresh mint and other herbs that I couldn't identify here. I ordered a double whiskey smash.

They're all too crowded, and you have to make threats or put some appealing body part on the bar in order to get the bartender's attention and get a drink. But, I was only there on Satuday night, so here goes.  They do have a good selection of rye, which gets them three stars. I like me my whiskey, and anyone who has a decent selection will get some props.  I suppose the decor is nice, in a generic, Scandinavian-esque sort of way. Personally, I like my bars a little warmer and cozier. But whatever; that's a personal preference. There was a neat chalkboard art-mosaic thing in the back. If you know who did it, drop me a line; I'd like to commission a mural for my apartment (don't tell the landlord).  The people were pretty much standard Tendernob weekend bar people - Marina-ers slumming, it looked like mostly. (If you've ever been to a bar in the Marina, you'll know why they come down here.) That's OK; not my crowd, personally, but OK. The music wasn't bad, but no one was dancing (except us, a little).  I did have a major problem with the fact that when we set our half-finished drinks down for ten seconds on the side of the pool table (which no one was using), a barback swooped in and took them away. (Aside: I HATE overzealous cleanup people. What is wrong with them? Can't they ask \"are you finished\" before taking my food and drink away? I mean, if there's still some left, don't assume I'm done just because I'm not talking with my mouth full. Jeez.) They did give us a free replacement drink, but we had to wade through about 917 people to get to the bar to get it.  Overall, I prefer Whiskey Thieves. Or Hemlock Tavern.",

Cans of PBR, generous vodka shots, frou frou cocktails, and smoking in the patio on Geary in the TL. Not a bad way to spend a Monday night.

The bar section can obviously get crowded but I've always found that the second room has always given me enough space to feel comfortable.  Tough to find any sort of parking in the area, but once you're settled, you can grab some drinks, hit up Osha that's right next door and call it a good evening.",

When she finally came by to take our order (2 basil gimlets and a Stella), she went back to the bar only to never return with our drinks. She brought drinks to all of the other tables. We just went to the bar after that.  2. I could not for the life of me figure out how to turn on the sink in the bathroom and neither could any of my friends. I ended up using someone's Purell. Gross.   However Rye still gets 4 stars for everything it does right. The basil gimlet was one of the best drinks I've ever had. Not too sweet, not too strong, just right. It was like a mojito with basil instead of mint. My friend's kumquat drink was equally delicious.  I also really liked the energy in the bar. I prefer places where there actually are places to sit and that don't pack people in like sardines. There were plenty of people there, but not so crowded that we couldn't move. The music was also great, and pretty eclectic. They played some typical bar music, but a lot of 80s and indie bands as well. Bonus points for any DJ that plays the New Pornographers.",

Appleseed: roughly speaking, bourbon, tequila, ginger beer, and bitters. - Birds of a Feather: tequila, orange oil (very fragrant), bitters, and vermouth.  Both AMAZING drinks! They are expensive, maybe a dollar or two higher than the ones at 15 Romolo, but when you're already paying more than $10 for a drink, another dollar is fairly inconsequential.  Our bartender was also super nice (probably connected to the fact that it was a bit of a slow night), and after hearing that one of our friends didn't have a taste for gin, she came up with a delicious shooter involving gin, cucumber, and mint, to change her mind. And she brought not just one, but five, one for everyone in our party to try. It was nominally on the house, but of course we tipped her a fiver! :)  Big plus for the place being really empty (good, more space for me), good patio (slight minus, it doubles as a smoking patio, but you can't have it all) and also holla to the nice, FREE pool table!

We arrived a little early so the place wasn't very crowded, but the girl sitting in the front booth was talking like it was packed. Her screeching shrieking voice was literally penetrating the lining of my eardrums ahhhh bad start@! So I swiftly more out of earshot from that cackling hen and ordered a round of Glenfiddich Rocks. OUCH 15 flicks to the nuts!!! So, the drinks are costly, whatever I've been flicked in the nuts before. It's really not that bad. After a couple more flicks to the nuts I get outside for a smoke in the \"Cage\" \u00a0and have a nice conversations with a couple friends that I don't get to see regularly. The nippy weather is getting to us so we mosey back in to see that the crowd has tripled and gotten like 2 feet taller. \u00a0I think it was GIANT night at the bar. I'm not the shortest dude in the world, but come on. I think the Warriors practice squad must've been there. The women are pretty and they wear the cute little tops that show off their sexy little shoulders and gym sculpted backs, the drinks are stiff, but there is not much room at the front and middle of the bar. \u00a0Definitely a place to meet a hot chick spend lots of money on her drinks and hope that she didn't just reaffirm that you really are a sucker. Usually along with these girls and LV bag and the 7 Jeans (Are those even still \"in\"?) come that bitchy pretentiousness that make me want to shit my pants so everyone can say \"What is that smell?\" All in all the place is somewhere to burn holes in your pockets and get drunk. I'm more of a dive bar kind of guy, but none of my friends are so I have to go to places like Rye. BTW if we hadn't swooped and when i say swooped I really mean \"Mutha Fuckin SWOOOPED!!!!!\" on the front booth for the whole freakin night, my rating probably would've dropped to 1star.

This is what emanates from this little gem stuck so close to the stumbling drunks and crack addicts twitching away. \u00a0I had to make sure to step around certain things, my heels clicking on the hard pavement.  Okay, I must confess. \u00a0Most of my dates are coffee based. \u00a0Why? \u00a0So I don't end up biased due to being under the influence. \u00a0Everyone starts to look better. \u00a0Motions get diluted. \u00a0Words start to slur and so do actions. \u00a0A possible relationship ideal will suddenly become a one night stand. Trust me, I know. \u00a0  After my Campton experience, the man pulled through again and through persistence, we ended up at Rye. \u00a0I've always heard of this place but have never been (just got out of a 8 month long relationship with a liar) and keeping a low profile from the social scene. \u00a0It was nice to dress up and go out on the arm of a very cute BR man (swoon, my type ;) Rye invokes memories of my several visits to the Pacific Northwest where the interiors are made of rich wood with muted steel accents. \u00a0My kind of place.  It was pretty busy and crammed with a good looking thirty-something crowd. \u00a0Most of the men dressed well (after work crowd) and the ladies well put together (no hoochie mamas, thank the lord). \u00a0I ended up with a Whiskey Sour which was more whiskey than I could handle and my date had Glenlivet. \u00a0Apparently, we were doing whiskey tonight.  The bartenders were slightly busy this night, so I recommend persistence and just being cool. \u00a0A smile doesn't hurt either :) For people who truly want a pull at their cancer sticks, Rye comes clean with a little area just for smokers (like the Hemlock Tavern). \u00a0  We'll be back, I can vote on that!",

If you don't pay attention you may just miss it! Their smoking patio is 'like being in a prison cage' as I like to describe it- but oh the more reason to love it! Great for people watching and a bit incognito ;) \u00a0  Love the brick walls and casual yet modern interior, good music that isn't too loud and you can actually hear what your date/friends are actually saying. The drinks are well made and strong, unlike other places that pack on the ice and call it a drink. The crowd here is contemporary, hip, and chic- every time I go I see beautiful people ;) But without all the pretentious snobbery you see in other blazer adorned lounges.   Not the place to go if you're looking to go crazy dancing, but definitely a place to get your drink on with friends and start the night. Everytime I have friends from out of town to visit I bring them here for starters and they are always impressed. Good drinks, nice vibes, beautiful people. love Rye.",

I went on a Monday and it wasn't busy at all, but there are these stools that are between tables and on a busy day, I could how it would be annoying to have to share with a different party.   Drinks: I had the following- basically everything that was on the Yelp Drinks Menu  Cold Whiskey Punch- For someone who doesn't like Whiskey this was a surprisingly good drink  Rock &amp; Rye- There was no description for this on the Menu, but it was something that was already pre-made and had cinnamon in it. It was pretty damn awful in my opinion.  Blood &amp; Sand- tasty, but not worth the $11 it would originally be without the Yelp discount.   Overall the drinks are good, but way too pricey.. and therefore it gets three stars.   Service: Three stars. It was a Monday so they probably weren't expecting to be as busy as they were, but everything was kind of a mess. It didn't look like they had any good way of keeping track of credit cards. They were all just sprawled out on the counter. I also know this because they didn't charge me for two drinks and took 10 minutes to find my card... I can't even imagine what it would look like on a Friday night.   Neither bartenders were very social. One of them, when I asked her what was in a drink, she just handed me another menu and told me to look it up. They did their jobs, they gave me drinks, but if they are trying to be an upscale place, which I think they are, it's the little personal touches that are going to make a person come back.",

Both bartenders were great, though we mostly interacted with Jennifer. She was great at making suggestions based on what we liked or had already tried and mixed awesome drink after drink [Rock Candy Rye Manhattan (I think it was): Amazing.).

Fresh ingredients, simple setting, a great way to end the Thursday night. It was quiet, yet a day after St. Patrick's Day, so we lucked out on the small crowd. Quite the selection of liquors and the gin drinks are a must.",

Had a little kick to it and was quite smooth. It was a drink that catered to mostly females.   Drinks of the night (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rye-san-francisco#AgEMNYWoOJoagAcvLmDD5Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rye-\u2026</a>)   I also had a few of their MOSCOW MULES which are served in a copper mug. Apparently that's the correct way to serve it. I guess I've been drinking mine the wrong way. But then again, I hardly order this drink. If you do order this drink, you gotta give the bartender your I.D. because people seem to steal the copper mugs (which are about $30 each). Once you return the mug, you can retrieve your I.D. back. This drink was a favorite amongst the crowd.  FYI = -Parking on the street (good luck finding a parking spot!) -Bathroom door does NOT lock all the way through (you might get walked in on....) -Pool table in main area at the back -Mini out-door patio  -Urban, modern, dark, candle-lit (great for a date!) -Cocktails $9-11 -Wine and beer also available -CC's accepted -Most importantly: STRONG DRINKS SERVED HERE  My visit to Rye was on a whim. And I'm kinda glad we stumbled upon this establishment as it's ambiance was very sultry, sexy looking people and they served strong drinks. I wouldn't mind coming back here again for drinks with my friends or to people watch ;)  Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #97",

And that seems like just the scene on a Tuesday night. \u00a0It was entirely too much of an ordeal to get a drink -- once you got to the bar, it was cool, the bartenders were *on it* and the drinks were good. \u00a0But the getting to the bar was somewhat of a mess.  Then again, for how crowded it was, I never felt claustrophobic, warm, or really uncomfortable at all. \u00a0That's impressive. \u00a0I was definitely rockin the whole \"dammit, why is this place so popular that I have to stand outside for 20 minutes\" while I was waiting in line... but I was pretty happy once I got in. \u00a0As I said, though, I think the feeling would be entirely different during the week, and entirely better, which is impressive.",

I wanted to show him a good time so we joined up with some friends of mine on a bar crawl to a few bars that I hadn't been to before.   This was the second bar we ended up going to. The vibe walking into to it on a Friday night was very welcoming. The bar and the decor is fairly simple and classy. \u00a0Prior to approaching the quite busy bar, I had a slight apprehension of what the service was going to be like; which to my surprise the service was some of the best I've had in the city. Because of such great atmosphere and service we ended up canceling our bar crawl with friends and staying here till last call.  I'd recommend this bar and atmosphere to anyone that is visiting or a local looking to have a great evening out.",

All four were well-balanced, flavorful and we'd have them again.  It was a Friday night and apparantly there is a happy hour until 7:30 with $8 drinks. Right before we were ready to leave, table service started. The waitress was delightful. She seemed to really like working at the bar and was very friendly and talkative. We wanted to stay just to enjoy her prescence. \u00a0She explained that in the future we could bring our dinner in if we wanted to. And that's what we plan to do next. A word on the atmosphere. It's not a super busy place (or at least not between 6-8 on a Friday), but it's steady and the crowd is an eclectic mix of people in jeans and sweaters and even some sweat pants and another guy in a suit. \u00a0It's very casual and welcoming. \u00a0We'll be back.",

Once inside though, you're treated to excellent wooden and metal visuals, a pool table and a second room in which you can chill and socialize in. What really kicks ass is the Prison of a smoking area that is to the right of the bar. I really thought it was interesting if not innovative for a lounge.   But nothing is ever perfect, such is the state of this part of my review. I have to say that for how small it is, they could have used the space better. One Bar? Is that even a concept anymore? And to top it off I am a beer drinker, true beer consumers get their beers from the tap...Rye has none on tap...perhaps I was seeing things...simply odd. That being said...those two things knocked this potential 5 star establishment down to a 3 star semi disappointment.",

Go here if you are serious about cocktails and willing to spend a bit of extra time and money to have one that is properly made. Order off their drink menu and try something new (or old, if you're going with a vintage cocktail such as the sazerac). Just live a little and trust your bartender.

Egg whites? Maple syrup? Yes, you heard that right!   I ordered the basil gimlet and the Added Bonus. \u00a0They were each $10 (a bit steep in my opinion). \u00a0The gimlet was actually not very basil-y, but very strong otherwise. \u00a0I'm not sure how it got on that 7X7 \"Must Eat Before You Die\" list; it's admittedly good, but certainly not \"last meal on earth\"-good. \u00a0I also ordered the Added Bonus solely based on the strangeness of the ingredients, which included basil, maple syrup, and egg whites. \u00a0It was a STRONG drink; I watched them take their time making it, and our bartender poured a ton of alcohol into it. \u00a0Thank you!   I tried my friend's drinks too, the Bella (a special they had that night, with huckleberries) and the Sao Paolo Sin, which she ordered also because of one of its interesting ingredients: Thai chili! \u00a0SPICY. \u00a0Too much spice for me, but it was a good drink. \u00a0Very new and interesting.   The bartenders take their time with the drinks, maybe it's more appropriate to call them mixologists. \u00a0I noticed all the fresh fruits and other ingredients lying around, and it seems like they take making drinks pretty seriously. \u00a0I also liked the atmosphere here, very chill and at the same time, it's a pretty nice place. \u00a0  So, overall: + Creative, good drinks with fresh, interesting ingredients - Somewhat steep pricing  + Chill atmosphere + Good bartenders/mixologists  Oh, and the final awesome point: you have a great selection of post-drink food choices within walking distance, ranging from Osha Thai next door to Bang San Thai down the block to Shalimar down the street! \u00a0Great food options after some great drinks! \u00a0Or, if you want to continue drinking, Bourbon and Branch is also just down the street.

I also tried my sister's La Lambada with tequila and sweet peppers (wasn't too impressed) and the Basil Gimlet (no longer on the menu but they'll still make it for you), which was just the perfect summer drink -- sweet/sour and crisp, with a basil mint aftertaste.

Well, heads-up foodies, this is your bar.\n  10 years ago, bars that served mojitos with fresh, muddled mint were rare delights. It can be had almost everywhere now.\n  Well, Rye has one-upped everyone with a mise en place that probably confuses their supplier.\n  My first friend had a recipe that included muddled strawberries, rosemary simple syrup and egg whites. It was served to him, giggling, in a champagne flute. He was almost annoyed at first, until he tried it. He finished it fast, but not because he was embarrassed.\n  I had a \"Thai me up\" with thai basil and peach puree. It was less tasty, but no less interesting - I ate too much of the chile pepper that was supplied as a garnish.\n  I had another buddy order his standard, a \"plain-ole\" manhattan which he quickly declared one of the best he'd had.\n  The staff is amazingly friendly. With the wealth of knowledge they so easily display, it would be such an easy misstep into snobbery. No way. They'll explain each and every drink they make, but If you just want some whiskey on the rocks, it's served with a smile.\n  I asked a different barkeep if the dark syrup he was using was made with turbinado sugar and he quietly spoke to me at length about how he liked the flavor but he found it muddied some other drinks.\n  I wish I could remember everything he said, but all of a sudden, I was tipsy. It sneaks up on you at Rye. Everything tastes so good, there's no nausea to warn you of your impending liquor limit.\n  Another example of their uncomprising search for flavor - they won't stock popular drinks for popularity's sake. I heard one customer ask for a Corona - he was handed a can of Tecate instead with assurances it was better. I asked for a Red Stripe and was given a Sessions with the same guarantee. Risky? Not if you know what you're doing like Rye does.\n  Don't go if: you just want to get your drink on at peak hours. These cocktail masterpieces take time to make and the two-man bar is often backed up three levels deep.\n  Extra-Something. I'ts right next to Osha, some of the best Thai food in the city.

Someone mentioned Rye and we decided to go on (although there was some confusion at first, the sign on the cheap looking wood-plank door was probably 3 inches tall. More leniency if these guys are remodeling as of 12/5/10, but I highly doubt this is the case). Look for a very unassuming place.   Ambience: The bar itself is nothing flashy - There's loud music coming from some speakers, an outdoor section, an elevated section where the bar is and some places to sit. A quick Foursquare \"Tips\" check hailed the Basil Gimlet as the top choice, so we made our way to the crowded bar.  Drinks: My friend Daniel (very important) headed to the bar first as we hung around and caught up, and came back with a Basil Gimlet after what seemed to be a while. He offered me a taste and I took a sip. It tasted weaker but had more flavor than a mojito. I headed to the bar to get my own.   Service: Rye gets a *ZERO out of ONE HUNDRED* for service. To be honest, I have never gotten angry at a bar to the point where I have to rally up my friends and leave.  The queueing process at the bar was extremely slow, and I was getting agitated on how long I had to wait. According to my Omega, it had been roughly 8 minutes before I even got to the front of the bar. Then I saw what the problem was. There was two females with empty drinks just conversing freely at the front of the bar. FFFFFUUUUU.... I didn't want to be rude but I was thinking \"Can you ladies please move? Some of us are trying to get drinks....\". I finally made my way to the front of the bar. I respected the line as the bartender made drinks for the people around me who got there first. But dammmmn this guy is SLOW. He is a curly haired, white male bartender with a gold watch on his left hand and tattoos on both his arms. Finally, he made eye contact with me and approached me. \"Yes!! This is my time! I can finally enjoy a nice Basil Gimlet to myself, and cross off the 100 things to try before you die\". My eyes eagerly perked up as I smugly pulled out my wallet. Suddenly, some San Francisco douchebag hipster BUTS IN OUT OF NOWHERE and orders a drink!! The bartender takes his order. WHAT!?!?!?! Are you kidding me douchebag hipster, and inexperienced batender!??! At this point I said fuck it, found my friends, and left.   So... thanks Daniel for letting me try the gimlet, although I didn't get to fully enjoy it. Your selflessness enabled me to write the \"drinks\" portion of this review lol.  As to Rye: I am not an MBA, and can't really recommend any managerial advice, BUT PLEASE, DO NOT STAFF YOUR B-LIST BARTENDERS ON A BUSY SATURDAY NIGHT.",

The cocktail creations?  Don't kid yourself.   No, it usually comes down to the \"Vibe\". and the \"Vibe\" depends on the people that frequent the place. \u00a0  If they are your kind of people, and it makes you relaxed, hopeful, excited, happy, then it is a good bar for you.   After all, there are only 3 reasons you go to a bar: 1. To meet with friends, chillax, and have a good time. . 2. To meet strangers and get lucky 3. To get drunk because you are not doing 1 or 2.   And like Cheers on TV, it's great to go to a place where everyone knows your name.   I had never been to Rye, so possibly nobody knew my name, but since it was Yelp's SFCM Ruggy's place of choice for a farewell party before heading off to NYC, a lot of people knew my name. Mainly fellow Yelpers.   The place reminded me, at least this night, \u00a0of a bar in NYC, actually. Especially when it got crowded. It had that Vibe, where you have to squeeze by people and get your accidental grope, which may turn into eye contact, which may turn into conversation, only because it is right in front of you. And there were a lot of attractive people here, looking to get lucky with others.   The bar has some large art pieces on the walls, a small pool table in the rear, a downstairs lounge, and a caged outdoor smoking area off the lounge onto Geary street.   It is sort of the place where you go after work or after dinner, but before you go to the clubs or elsewhere in the city. It is a place removed from the FiDi, so no suits, but on the edge of the Theaters, Union Square shopping, and Tenderloin clubs.   The crowd is mostly Caucasian 30 somethings, with a sprinkle of SF's diversity. \u00a0They do have some tasty and popular drinks here, which helps to bring the ladies.   Most men, well they drink what they always drink, so it doesn't matter, as long as there are ladies present.   So I came for reason #1 to meet friends and say goodbye to Ruggy.

You see, it all started with Brian Barneclo. The artist. I met him at an event last night while he was doing some live painting. He was painting live. Oh, you know what I mean. Anyway, I walked into Rye tonight and saw his paintings hung all around the place. I was so excited... For me, his paintings capture very essence of San Francisco. So, I started to drink.  Those who know Rye know the specialty cocktail menu never disappoints, and lest you think you've tried them all, there's always a new special on the chalk board. I started with the absinthe drink with muddled strawberries and moved on to the gin basil gimlet. Well, absinthe makes me loopy and gimlets are just so damn drinkable. But who can resist with all of the ice crushing, fruit muddling and heavy pouring going on?  Brian Barneclo, I blame you.",

The Basil Gimlet is refreshing, tart and not stuffy or fake-tasting like some cocktails can get when they've been mixed with sugar water. The Strawberry lemon drop (because they ran out of blackberries) was sweet, delicious to sip on and made differently, depending on which bartender serves you. I like this. The first lemon drop had a sliver of strawberry garnish, the second lemon drop had a light fruity foam. Both so good.  Want to hang out at a bar that exudes trendiness but doesn't reek of snobs or creeps? Come enjoy Rye. It gets crowded, so they must be doing everything right.

When I crave a drink I don't really want a mixer and I don't relish beer. Wine is fine but truly I just want a smooth glass of whiskey or bourbon tossed on some rocks and I'm a happy camper.  Enter Rye. I've been here a few times now, it's dangerous. Dangerous in terms of I could spend a stack of cash here consistently if I don't watch my step. The vibe and ambiance are upscale lounge, inviting you off the cold streets of the TL right up to the bar. Glancing about you'll see the exposed brick, candles, modern woodwork, casual art, and may think pretentious but I assure you the welcoming tenders of the bar are far from aloof.  I'm no veteran in the world of whiskey and thankfully on several occasions the bartenders have walked me through tastes to make sure I found a good fit. I tend to prefer smoky/peaty whiskeys but I have no clue which distillery to select or what region or age I favor. That's where the guidance and samples are much appreciated, they make sure I'm headed in the right direction. I've tried a whiskey cocktail or two here as well and Rye has certainly hit their mark.  I love the Tenderloin but at times a dive bar just doesn't fit my mood. Crazy I know. Maybe I want to enjoy a setting other than a vomit stained floor with a loud drunk man at the pool table. Maybe I want to lazily gaze at art on the walls not of the beer advertisement variety. When I don't want to leave the TL but want to step up my drink game, money says you'll find me at Rye.",

(Not to mention pricey as hell, and none too strong.) On the positive side, our bartender was prompt, friendly, and skillful. The crowd early-evening was casual with a gratifying touch of hipster. But as mid-evening gave way to midnight, the crowd became decidedly younger and more awkwardly self-conscious. A formulaic sea of plunging necklines and tight black sweaters flooded the space. Hip-hop-inspired pop started thumpin' and the vibe settled into girls-just-wanna-have-fun vs. guys-just-wanna-get-laid.

I have been wanting to go to Rye for quite some time now, based on the recommendations of friends in SF. Last week, during one of my many trips to SF from LA, I finally got to experience Rye, and lemme tell you boys and girls, it did NOT disappoint. This, in fact, is the epitome of MY kind of bar; rad art on the walls, low key vibe, great bartenders who are experts in their craft (yes, muddling &amp; mixing the perfect drink, is a craft to me), minimal amount of clutter so there is plenty of standing and sitting room. We were here on a Tuesday night, and it was late, so it wasn't packed but it certainly wasn't empty. I imagine this place does get packed, especially on the weekends and during happy hour. There is an outdoor smoking area (bonus) and clean bathrooms (double bonus).   Funny enough, the day after I visited Rye, I attended a happy hour event put on at the Farmer's Market in SF, to celebrate Cocktail Week and the peeps from Rye just so happened to be there. I ran into one of the bartenders from the night before and she was super sweet. I had to give her props in person because that's just how I do.

Now the people. \u00a0So the typical crowd looks to be around early 30's, which is younger or older depending on where you usually go. \u00a0The pool table and the smoking area make it have a more relaxed vibe then most places but the soft lit seating room gives it an upper class feel. \u00a0No dress code (or at least I don't believe so). \u00a0Go in suit or shorts, you're going to have a good time (but wouldn't recommend shorts).

Second on the list is the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. \u00a0I did not run through the entire group but I did confirm that while they did not have George T. Stagg, they did have Thomas H. Handy hidden away.  The rest of their whiskey selection is has enough variety to separate itself from other joints and their cocktails are also pretty well-made (My Mint Julep was mighty fine).  I will definitely be back for my favs!",

You don't care what floor we work on or who we report to, as long as we pay our tab at the end of the night!   With such an extensive drink menu, it's hard to figure out what to order. Lucky for me, I come here enough and can give you a hot tip: order the Flash (cucumber, gin, kiwi) or the Basil Gimlet. Both are fresh and tasty - I could really drink them all night, but would regret that decision the next day.   The best thing about Rye, besides the booze, is the laid-back atmosphere. Some cocktail bars have an air of pretension where you feel like you can't sit down and relax. No worries, here. Whether you want to play a game of pool, sit back in a cozy booth or enjoy a smoke on the front patio, the folks at Rye don't care. That's not to say that the bartenders aren't hustling - they work their asses off making fresh drinks and ensuring that your glass is never empty.   Love, love, love - will always come back for one more round!",

But once you're past the original get-to-know-you questions, this place will do nicely. There are lounge booths in one half, and a cool bar in the other. Even a pool table.  I like their moscow mule (although it's called something else) - they'll take your ID as collateral for the bronze mug, so make sure you don't forget it. Not that I did. Ok I did. Don't judge me.

The sweetness of the agave nectar masked most of the taste of the alcohol, which I really liked because I'm not too big of a fan with gin. But, be careful! However sweet it is, I still get that slight Asian glow.   The party I came here with were a mix of people, some working and some who were still in school.

With its bare-brick walls, reclaimed wood paneling, exposed pipes, and wire grating, the interior of the bar is reminiscent of a New York City loft. The bar is often hectic, and always spread with eccentric ingredients (kumquat, falernum, maple syrup, and purmusuled kiwi). The ladies and gentlemen working behind it are mixologist-bartender hybrids of the highest caliber. Knowledgeable and witty, they're capable of giving recommendations tailored to any patron's taste, or conducting a snappy conversation over the sounds of ice rattling in tumblers and bottles clinking in toasts. With local beers on tap and fancier ones in bottles, Rye has got a selection that will quench most anyone's thirst.  Up-and-coming young entrepreneurs love this spot just as much as the classic barfly or the addled local relishing the revitalizing fresh ambiance, and if you're not lounging on a leather-upholstered custom bench or having a cigarette in the designated smoking area, a glance out the front door might be rewarded with a view of a passing troupe of pub-crawlers or a late-night bike parade.",

I forget what exactly my date ordered, but both that and my Bank Heist Swizzle were tasty drinks, albeit a bit on the sweeter and lighter side - or so I thought, because I did start feeling just a little something towards the end of my cocktail: in other words, the bartenders here do a pretty good job of masking the alcohol in the drinks, which is great for those who don't actually like alcohol that tastes like, well, alcohol.  The space itself has kind of a chic, modern, industrial look to it. Pretty nice, especially on a Monday, when the place isn't crowded.  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - A pretty large space with an open floor plan, albeit on two separate levels, so only one of them (the main level, from the entrance) is actually accessible.  Bathroom - Fortunately, they have two sets of bathrooms, one per level. I didn't actually check them out, but I suspect they were accessible as well.",

The drinks were average price for the city and the neighborhood was chill enough for us to find some parking but you may not always be so lucky so have a backup plan. There is a pool table in the back near the bar and that's nice and all but it takes up a bunch of room that could go to the bar but that's another story. They have an outdoor smoking area which is caged into the actual bar which I really liked. Instead of going outside and getting your hand stamped and getting hasseled to get back in, you can just go outside and still be in the bar to get some air or a smoke if that's what you're into. Chill atmosphere except for a few bitches trying to start drama but we shut it down and had a good rest of the night.",

No crazy drunk girl assaulted us. \u00a0In fact, it was a super mellow crowd, and there was even enough seating in the lounge area below for all of us to share some comfy couches. \u00a0I will admit that it was loud enough that I felt we had to holler to make ourselves heard in conversation. \u00a0On the whole, this was exactly the speed I needed after a long week of long days, short nights, and lots of excitement.  Back to my drink. \u00a0After the magic of watching my bartendress craft my delightful Ginger Spice, I was looking forward to the same experience this evening. \u00a0Expertly eyeballed volumes of liquors and mixers went into a glass. \u00a0Ice was added and smoothly stirred. \u00a0The freshly chilled martini glass was emptied of ice water and refilled with Ginger Spice. \u00a0The bartendress siphoned up a small straw full of the drink and sampled it to ensure quality... and it was passed to me.  What? \u00a0No lighted toothpick? \u00a0No flaming orange peel? \u00a0This must be what it feels like when the honeymoon ends, and your partner stops treating you like you're special. \u00a0I was just a little bit crushed... but I paid up, took my drink, held my chin up, and weaved my way back to my colleagues to drown my sorrows in rye whiskey.  And drown them I did. \u00a0Flaming orange peel or not, this drink was still expertly crafted, ridiculously strong, and by the time I found the bottom of my glass, I forgot all about my earlier disappointment.  Rye, I still adore you. \u00a0But you remind me once again that nobody's perfect all the time. \u00a0Sorry, I have to go. \u00a0Reality's calling for me.",

First, you don't have to wait in an enormous line to get into Rye and the doorman is friendly and professional - it's as if he's an entirely other species of doorman from the Ambassador/Los Angeles variety. No attitude at all, very chill, and no cover on Saturday. Five stars.   The music is energetic enough to support the social buzz without being so loud or having such a drivingly fast beat that you can't hold a conversation. The pool table is also a nice addition to the atmosphere. Four stars.  The crowd was a good mix of men and women, with the ratio hovering at about one to one all night. The atmosphere was friendly and social, with small groups and singles mingling freely. Four stars as there was a (quite small) contingent of the North Beach striped-shirt brigade.   The staff... This is where Rye really ascends into the nightliofe pantheon - the bartender, Jenn, is absolutely the best in San Francisco - PERIOD. This woman successfully knocked Voda off the \"best martini in SF throne\" with a dirty hendrick's martini that was besically an orgasm in a glass. Add in the \"most well-made mojito I've ever had\" according to the D, and you're ready to start your night properly. The very cool waitstaff were cracking jokes and having a good time with us without letting it affect their efficiency a bit, and we ended the night throwing back shots at the bar and laughing it up lioke old friends. Combine that with the doorman experience, and you have 5 stars... I wish I could give 6!  Overall, I found Rye to be a fantastic place to go with a small group of friends for great drinks and atmosphere in a place where you can actually get a spot to sit (no packed like sardines in this bar!). I would also suggest it as a place to go for a few drinks with a date after dinner - great drinks, places to sit and chat, not too loud, fun, relaxed atmosphere. It isn't really a pick-up joint, though, from my experience, but that may vary with the night.  EDIT: The absolute rock star of a doorman referenced above is named Quenton - give the man some love, as he keeps cool, calm and very personable despite having a job that can often be thankless.",

Happy hour means a good game of pool in a place that remains \"intimately lit,\" even as it takes in the last of the southern sun through the steel grating of the smokers' patio.

He whipped up a raspberry gimlet (not on the menu), which I dare say, might be better than the Basil Gimlet! It tasted really fresh, and I liked that it was more tart.  Tried a couple others, some were pretty good (blood and sand was made perfectly), and some were just OK.   I want to note that I felt that the bartenders were quite unnecessarily rude.

Rye was more than decent. The bar service was unparalleled, at least to us LA natives. The venue was very modern, crowds were friendly and talkative, and drinks were good too.

The good: - again, this bar is pretty great - lots of seats, good layout, generally pleasing aesthetics  - my drink was excellent - clean, good restrooms - pool table (unfortunately overtaken by people who were... not playing pool) - great details - the concrete block in the floor of the doorway is poured around the namesake and the wood in the ceiling above the bar looks great - staff was cool, welcoming and friendly - good music  The bad: - i didn't really like the other people patrons (see: douche factory, here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2FBCfIc&amp;s=3659b1991b383f82ff57e419ed91630eea6c0f93d6411a9782d8a8498233182e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">goo.gl/BCfIc</a>) - I hate their artwork. I get that they need a bunch of huge pieces but I hate the ones they have. They're just huge and meaningless. This is actually my number one complaint about this establishment. Bad, huge art. - our party was accosted by a drunk, who started out trying to buy Kat drinks at the bar. She unwittingly brought him back to our table (hey, isn't that my move??) where he immediately fell in lust with Mike's beard, regaled us with stories of the complex customs forms he has to complete legibly at UPS (he's employed?) when mailing things to Canada, then bought Mike a drink under the guise of it being for a \"fellow Canadian\" (he was definitely from south america) and... it was just very confusing, but I have a lot of great photos of the situation. \u00a0Harmless/funny/confusing.  I would come here again if someone else picked it, but I would never choose this venue for anything. The other patrons were kind of obnoxious for my taste and the drinks were exorbitantly priced (average $13). \u00a0  I wish I could teleport this venue to a different location and fill it with people that I actually like, then I would never leave.",

And, the bartenders take their drink making seriously, this is not the place to slap down a 20 and get your rum and coke in 2 minutes or less, good quality takes time, so, relax.   The winter cocktail menu is heavy on egg drinks...yes, egg, as in egg white. A very classic touch and it makes for some great drinks. The Added Bonus was fantastic, classic, and even won a \"what are your drinking?\" from a woman next to me. (If you really care about such things).   It's not just a place with a great liquor selection and careful mixing, they also use top notch ingredients, including about 10 different kinds of bitters.   Personally I would trade the pool table for more seating...in fact if someone was playing pool it would ruin some of the ambiance.

I don't remember the other drinks that we tried, but the Basil Gimlet was a hit with everyone. If you watch the bartenders make the drinks, you will see that they use a lot of really FRESH ingredients in their drinks which is great, but just keep in mind that it takes them longer to make the drinks, so the service is a little bit slow at the bar.   Since Yelp Drink's Week, we have gone back to Rye, but only for their Basil Gimlet.

Well, the one problem I have with Rye is that it always takes me forever to get a drink. \u00a0The bar area is too small and often too crowded for me to push my way to the front and get a drink. \u00a0I don't think I've ever managed to get a drink in faster than 15 minutes there.  Other than that, though, Rye isn't a bad place. \u00a0I do wish the layout was slightly different as the bar is often a bottleneck for moving around the bar. \u00a0I love the fact that there's a patio. \u00a0Being able to hang out on the patio at midnight with a drink in my hand is something I love about Rye. \u00a0Granted, Geary Street isn't exactly the best view; but it's not about the view... it's about the people.",

Its usually never too crowded, the drinks are well made, and the ambiance is relaxing and cool.  But the only downside thus far has been an unbelievably mean and rude bartender who is usually there on friday and saturday nights. Most bartenders here will wait until they have completed someone else's order before asking for yours, this woman asks for multiple orders at a time. So after waiting about 20 mins to get her attention you will usually have to wait another 15-20 mins to your drink. On one occasion she yelled at a patron, who had not yet ordered from her but was standing in the vicinity, to not order from one of the other bartenders and to just wait for her. I found this pretty shocking and rude considering we were all still waiting to place an order. Since it didn't happen to me I simply ignored her sour puss attitude.  On my most recent visit to Rye the same bartender had taken my boyfriends order, questioned if he was making the right decision \"Are you sure? Its a white wine spritzer you know\", then taking 20 mins to even start making the drinks without even saying a simple, \"It will just be a minute\". After too many false alarms with the drinks we simply decided to cancel our order and leave. She shot us a look, and walked away without saying anything. Long story short. This is a great place, but I think I will try to order from somebody who doesn't let their indifference ruin people's night out.",

We had a few drinks off the specialty menu, all were underwhelming.\n  The crowd was eh (but like a lot of folks say, many nights lead to many vibes, can't really judge the atmosphere from a single trip)\n  The reason I'm conflicted is because I love having half-way stylish bars coming into (nearly) my hood.

Coziness is my litmus test for a bar, and that's not the vibe here. Sure, there's a pool table, but I also wouldn't feel uncomfortable wearing (trendy) business casual. I never, ever want to feel comfortable in business casual.  The drinks are well-made, with an obvious bent toward whiskey. I've had a couple memorable Manhattans in particular. However, you can order memorable whiskey drinks a couple of blocks away at Bourbon and Branch and get atmosphere too. It just doesn't compute.  So yeah, Rye does what it does well. If that's your scene, cool. If you're my friend and that's your scene, I'll tag along without complaining. If you leave it up to me, though, it won't make the cut.",

I have low tolerance and I have never had straight hard liquor. My friend goes to the bartender and asks for a drink that is strong but goes down easy.

This was probably my favourite drink of the night (We went to five places, and I had one drink at each place). The basil flavour balanced nicely against the dry gin and lime. It's somewhat of an adventure on your tongue. Starts with the basil, and immediately switches to sweetness, then tartness, and finishes with a dry sweet basil that comes off the tongue nicely.  The bathroom was decorated for Halloween. Decor was simple, speakeasy-esque. They had good music playing (somewhat indie). Even with the music, I was still able to hold conversations with my friends at a slightly elevated volume.   I enjoyed my time here. The Basil Gimlet was good (affordable too!) and the environment was swell.   Recommended and I'll be back.",

(seriously guys, if you're going to order drinks named after sex acts and invented by college students, go to The Bus Stop). \u00a0i'm a pretty big fan that a place with such great cocktails will also throw some gangster rap my way (not found at say, bourbon and branch or beretta), but sometimes it prevents conversation. \u00a0my sympathy for the bartenders, but maybe if they turned the music down and refused to make lemondrops, the crowed would chill out. \u00a0but this rye deserves no more than two stars. \u00a0there is a special circle in hell for people who waste good liquor, and this place is an abomination.   but then i went to rye last night, the rainy sunday night before MLK's day. \u00a0the place was perfect. \u00a0the bartenders know what the hell they are doing and are really happy to talk about their cocktails and the creative stuff they want to do. \u00a0the cocktails here are every bit as good as beretta and more creative than bourbon and branch. some of the best drinks in a city of good drinks. \u00a0 and the crowd was great. \u00a0it's a lounge and people were acting like it was a lounge, and by that i do not mean they were wearing sunglasses and taking bottle service. \u00a0it's what is should be: a place where people talk to other people. \u00a0 one bartender, whose name i forget, joined me in spraying soda water across the bar, made a damn good seasonal blood-orange whisky sour etc. \u00a0they are infusing whiskeys and getting really creative with seasonal fruits and infusions. \u00a0this place is awesome. \u00a0i didn't tip the bartender enough, as i left in something of a hurry, but i really want to come back to this bar... not the doucemonkey lounge. \u00a0five stars for this one.  and as i believe we should evaluate these places at their best, and because the average doesn't mean anything, i'm going with the five.",

I've never ordered any of the listed menu drinks. I drink classics and just straight booze. Because I exercise proper drink ordering etiquette, my wait for a drink -even during busy times - is minimal.   I find the music can be a bit too loud for me around the seated area towards the caged bottles. I'm kinda bummed the pool table is gone, but those are minor complaints.

So this was the third (and last because after drinking at two other spots trying everything on the drink menu it was time to stop or head to SF General for a good old stomach pumping, you remember those days in college) stop in my odyssey to find that great bar and perfect drink.   Well this place came mighty close to great bar and perfect drink. The Manhattans I ordered came out cold, crisp and packed with bourbon flavor like they are meant to be, best of all they passed the cherry test with brandied cherries.   So skip the other two place (Piso and Brick) and just head here, order a drink and then order another.  Cheers",

    "review_text": "Unlike other craft cocktail bars I've visited, Rye isn't promoting the whole super dim/ dark wood aesthetic. It's comfortably lit in there for a bar, there are concrete floors, and generally a funkier vibe. Yet make no mistake, Rye's tenders mix a mean cocktail, and there's something for all palates. Well as long as your palate craves liquor. Let's face it, if you're there with me, why wouldn't it? You're just a weirdy, and I don't think we can be friendsy.  Speaking of weirdies, there was a drunken dude that was all up in everyone's bizness around the bar. He said he was a friend or relative of one of the bartenders, but it didn't excuse his too-friendly, no-regard-for-personal-space antics. He would just plop himself down at our table, reach over people for drinks... just really inappropriate, unwelcome behavior. At one point, he claimed he was a werewolf and was feeling crazy because the full moon was coming, and then he plucked the basil out of my friends' drink, took a bite, made a sneer, and spit out the rest... BACK INTO MY FRIEND'S DRINK. Not cool at all dude. If that had been my drink, I don't think I could've been as forgiving, but my friend just laughed it off.  Aside from that guy invading our space and making some of us uncomfortable, we had a great time at Rye. Our party kept growing as friends and friends of friends kept popping in, and the drinks kept flowing. Like I said, they have something for everyone, from a long list of specialty cocktails, to custom-ordered ones, to a decent beer selection (Hitachino Nest White Ale was the popular choice that night). I'm pretty sure this will be a staple of my visits to the city.",

Music was pretty eclectic from what I remember but the drinks were pretty awesome.

I think I asked for another drink off their old menu and they didn't know how to make that either :( disappointing. So I got the basil gimlet, and it was really good! So +1 for that. I think I also got the Pimms cup and it was pretty good too. But my boyfriend had the opposite experience-- he got some drink on the menu that had black tea in it. Sounded interested but tasted disgusting lol. He got another drink on the menu and that one didn't taste good either.  Overall, I'm pretty disappointed at the limited variety of drinks that the bartenders could make. Also, the drinks aren't very consistent. Some are good, some aren't.

And the other yelp reviews are pretty accurate about the crowd.  The drinks are great. I was dumb and started off with a high-maintenance \"this is how I like my drink\" order, instead of testing the waters with one of their standards. It turns out that they have a Rye Manhattan already on the menu and I had unwittingly applied my own modifiers on top of it. Long story short, there was constructive interference and I got a drink that was way unbalanced on the sweet side. Props to the bartender for keeping it drinkable; in other circumstances I think it could have gone pretty badly.  The basil gimlet is amazing. Can I call it a revelation without sounding like a snooty choad? The basil is completely on target for this drink.  Well, you get the point. I'm repeating what everyone else is saying.

Oh man I sound like a booz snob, I'm not I promise, i was wheened on Smirnoff and other horrible swills... but seriously, it's a good place, its just not consistent from visit to visit. I see a lot of eye balling of cocktails at this joint. The jiggers don't come out regularly, funny enough, the Jalisco heat which was great the first time was measured, the 2nd time, it was a Friday night, it wasn't measured and didn't exactly jive, rather the flavors of the various ingredients didn't jive the way they did the first time around.

Upon entering, the bartender was expecting us, so the flight was ready to go. The warm and inviting ambiance offered a cozy feel, a little swanky but rustic at the same time.   After taking the 3 shots and learning about each one, she asked us to pick our favorite and she would create a cocktail with it. She asked us our taste preferences and went to work creating a customized drink on the spot. And damn, did they hit the spot! Seriously, one of the best cocktails I have ever sipped. I didn't want it to end.   Our bartender was a sweetie and very knowledgable, personable and gave us a great background on each selection. The price was awesome since I went through Sosh and it was all taken care of (including 20% tip) though the app. I would never have discovered the place despite living in the neighborhood for a few years since I tend to stick to the same dive spot, and I am glad I did. I read, I think in a 7x7 article, that hanging out in their smoker's cage at Rye (which is quite beautiful) and watching the people walk by was listed as one of the top things to do in SF before you die. So I can knock that one off my bucket list, even though I didn't even know it was there :).

We got there pretty early (the place still smelled like fresh cut limes and lemons) so we were able to grab two seats at the bar. They have a great selectiong of whiskey and even their own infusion. We decided to try some of their cocktails. Pretty darn tasty! We soon realized that having an open tab might become dangerous. But again... why not. We were even gutsy enought to try out their rock and rye whiskey- neat.   As the night and happy hour progressed, another coworker joined us. I was also able to spot the Yelp crew - yay!Met a couple of cool people and enjoyed the lounge area behind the bar. This place is pretty chill and even has a little patio/smoking area. It does get crowded quickly though. But everyone looks to be having a great time, except for the homeless person who strolled in for a moment.

Good crowd, good music, laid back atmosphere, not too busy. Two of us had whatever special drink that was on the board.. I want to say it was called a Statesman. I seem to recall it containing Wild Turkey, but I can't remember what the hell else was in it, only that it was absolutely delicious. My friend's girlfriend had a rum &amp; coke and was surprised at how strong it was (that's not a bad thing).  I'm not in the city much in the evening, especially for bar hopping, but this place is definitely worth another trip.",

    "review_text": "When: Saturday night, ~10:30pm  We went to Rye to celebrate a friend's birthday. It's a small, inconspicuous spot and easy to miss if you're not paying attention. First thing I noticed on the way in was a homeless man bugging the patrons hanging out on the smoking patio for money. Ah, the night scene in SF...  Inside: For a Saturday night, it wasn't too crowded. My group of seven people managed to snag a table after about 30 minutes of standing around. I hardly noticed the wait though, since it took me about that long to get the bartender's attention anyway.  Drinks: Specialty drinks run about $9-$10, but I have to admit they are quite good. Recommend the basil gimlet and the blood and sand cocktail.  The bartender: I was tended to by a guy bartender, who I have to call an elitist. He refused to make my friend a long island, and responded with some kind of comment about how he doesn't make \"those kind of drinks.\" Ooookay. Sure he mixes up a mean-ass vodka tonic (glass of vodka with a splash of tonic), but seriously, don't be a prick. Given the cocktail menu, you wouldn't think a long island would be an issue. \u00a0It's not like we asked for a round of daquiris.  The venue: The bar gets quite crowded, so good luck getting in there to order your drinks. You're better off grabbing the cocktail waitress and having her bring them to you. The music is loud, but not to the point where you can't have a conversation with the people sitting next to you.  Final verdict: 3 stars for tasty drinks, but relatively bad service. I'd probably only go back if my friends insisted.",

The place had diverse crowd, with a pool table near the bar, smoking area for my smoker friends, a wine arrangement in the second lounge area, with bricks completing the far right wall. \u00a0There was enough room to stand or sit, though we stood as much as we sat that night. \u00a0I'd come back here again unless the Tenderloin becomes even less attractive on weekends.",

On the negative, the drinks are teeny tiny. We went on a Thursday around seven, so I was half expecting some special but none was to be found. Her cosmo appeared to be half sized but was full priced.

What I had was one of the best champagne cocktails ever made. It had an essence of strawberries (but not sweet) and a nice floater of meringue on top. I think this could almost qualify as healthy.  The bar itself was not hard to find, but figuring out how to get in wasn't so obvious. The patio is surrounded by a cage, which has the immediate effect of making you want to get inside the bar right now! But the unmarked door, that looks more like a plate glass window, takes a certain amount of faith to try to open.   The decor is very Hotel-Bar 2006 Chic. Dark walls, clean lines, a lone vase full of pussy willows (I guess they are a conversation starter) coupled with the dim lighting and moody music, make this bar a fabulous place to get together with friends for a few healthy cocktails.",

Cecilia S., \u00a0Janice. C., Bobby L. and I rolled in here sometime after 7pm on a Saturday in January. \u00a0I KNOW it was after 7, because we had tried to go here earlier that night and discovered they were closed until 7! :-) \u00a0We were joined shortly after we arrived by Mish L. and David B.  The atmosphere at Rye is cool but welcoming, and the lighting is low. \u00a0It wasn't at all hard to figure out what I wanted as my first drink - a Basil Gimlet! \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GIm5jbvmymBNo_e7Y84efw?select=Xccqmz1BKiUX-SSJXQ66qg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/GIm5\u2026</a> Slightly sweet with a bright citrus tang from the lime, and the refreshing herbal note of basil, a basil gimlet feels light going down - the combination of basil and lime gives the cocktail a nice refreshing taste that isn't heavy at all. \u00a0So well mixed and finely balanced are the tastes of this legendary cocktail that's it's also got a deceptively non-alcoholic mouth feel to it - while it's got a punch as potent as any thrown by Mike Tyson in his prime, it's sheathed in a velvet glove... \u00a0  When it came time for my 2nd drink, I was fortunate to be able to consult that celebrated Mistress of Mixology, Janice \"vesper\" C. \u00a0There ain't nobody nowhere that knows more about cocktails than Janice! \u00a0In fact, she's more knowledgeable about alcohol than Dick Cheney is about waterboarding... \u00a0Her suggestion for my 2nd drink was a Bobby Burns: scotch, dolin rouge vermouth, benedictine and orange bitters. \u00a0It was pretty good, but I guess I had a decided Basil Gimlet jones going that night, and didn't need to think long and hard about what my 3rd drink would be!  When it got to be that time, I hung out at the bar for a few and watched the professional Mixologists do their legendary deeds. \u00a0It's a total pleasure to watch them work; they make some amazingly complex moves look easy, and who can argue with the quality of their work product? \u00a0Case in point - CiCi invented a whole new concoction (subsequently dubbed \"The Drink with No Name\") which she described to them, and low and behold it came to be! \u00a0I don't know if CiCi's invention can truly give the Basil Gimlet a run for it's money in my book, but the process was impressive all the same, and she totally LOVED the end result!  It was around this point when our waitress asked the bunch of us to change tables because a larger party wanted the one we were at. \u00a0To make the process completely painless, she bribed us with a round of free shots of chilled Ketel One, which inspired Bobby to take a group picture. \u00a0Due to the low lighting, it's not the greatest digital photo by any stretch of the imagination, but it's good enough for government work :-) \u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_photos?select=2vIBvjParjh7PVj3L5hs1w&amp;userid=DfmtZlDE8JJv-boorp1PAg\">yelp.com/user_photos?sel\u2026</a> In fact, we were so pleased we were still recognizably ourselves that we bought several more rounds of chilled Ketel One shots to celebrate...  It was great coming here as part of my first PYE. \u00a0Meeting half a dozen uber-cool Yelpers in one night was awesome, and I especially enjoyed meeting CiCi and Janice after having Yelped with both of them for quite a while. \u00a0My special thanks to CiCi (Cecilia S.) for her PYE inspiring review of Rye and it's incredible cocktails.  To those of you who haven't taken the time to check out the legendary drinking establishment that is Rye, there's no time like the present - don't forget to try the Basil Gimlets!",

But on to the drinks. \u00a0Basil Gimlet is where its at! \u00a0Well...I have had better at the Alembic ;) but this one was pretty darn tasty. \u00a0I ended up ordering the special of the week next, which was some kind of habanero/tequila concoction....good, but not nearly as spice licking as I wanted it to be....I have had habanero infused drinks before and they have left my lips tingling as they should! All in all....Rye....you are a decent bedfellow, while the serious bf is away, but other than that....its a no go.",

The name told me it should be what I'm looking for.   There were only a few people sitting at the bar when we arrived (it was 6:30ish on a Tuesday night). It had a cool vibe to it- dark, lots of dark distressed wood and candlelight. I asked the bartender (a girl squeezing herself into a midriff-exposing top that she really shouldn't have been trying to wear) if we could sit anywhere, and she said yes but we had to order at the bar.   My date sat, while I waited at the bar to order. She was conversing with some customers she seemed to know, and it took a long time for her to move her attention to me. I stood there awkwardly waiting at the end of the bar. Finally should took my drink orders, and proceeded to make them. It took a long time, but was pretty neat to watch- they are definitely particular about their drink-making there. With all of the hullabaloo that went into making them, I expected to have two of the best cocktails I'd ever had. They were good, but not outstanding (see pictures).   It seems like a cool place for small groups to hang out. Definitely a hipster vibe.",

I was a mother fucking Genghis Khan of pretentious drinking establishments. Rawr. Entering Rye with a defiant (and very inebriated stare) I'm pleasantly surprised. This place does not completely suck. Then a dark haired man approaches me with a gimlet. The man behind him says \"My friend thinks you can use a drink\".  Me: What is this? Cyrano de Bergerac? Can't your friend speak for himself? Guy: I apologize, this is my friend Erastus, he is from Greece. I am James, his interpreter.  Oh my fuck, that shit is hot. Drinks basil gimlet handed to me.  Panties. Drop.  So while speaking to this James/Erastus hybrid I find out one of them thinks he met me in Greece, went to school at Fordham (me too!), wants to take me out sailing tomorrow (cheesy, but whatever), spent their childhood being raised by nannies (twinsies!), has a name that means \"Loving One\", is a ordained MINISTER. At that point I can't keep them straight, everything blends into each other like limbs at an orgy.  Ummm..... somewhere in the night, things started going down.....  And I think I'm married  The funny thing is that I don't know if I'm Mrs. James D_____ Or Mrs. Erastus Snufflafagus  Eh. Worse shit has happened.",

We were here a bit early and were able to enjoy our surroundings before the masses came.

The first time the bartender took a little while to pay attention to us, but once he did he was smooth and efficient and awesome about answering questions and letting us sample apertifs, etc. I ordered the Basil Gimlet (but with vodka) and the Dimmi More special (lemon bitters, simple, muddled strawberries and Dimmi). Both were AMAZING, high quality delectable cocktails. I wished I could have had 5 Dimmi Mores instead of just one. Boyfriend had the Nevada cocktail and the Vertigo (Earl Grey and Chai-infused gin--what?!) and they were also fucking superb, even though I hate whiskey and gin.  Each time they've had good tunes and just a few mellow people sprinkled around the bar. What a haven in the middle of the Tenderloin.

I HATE GIN....seriously hate it. \u00a0But I had the Basil Gimlet, and knowing that it had no hint of gin taste, because i ordered it last time as well, it proved to be totally refreshing on my palette. \u00a0We then asked what we should get for our second drink. \u00a0The other hottie male bartender suggested The Flash. \u00a0Seeing as though it was another gin drink i was a little hesitant, but he insisted that it would change our lives. \u00a0A perfect mix of sweet and sour, cucumber, kiwi, gin and probably a bit of magic had me convinced at the first sip. Life changing. \u00a0Not that often one can say that about a drink, but it was true. \u00a0So true in fact that we both ordered another one, and got one for our third person who had just joined us. \u00a0  I know that i woke up today a new woman. \u00a0Thats saying something. \u00a0Life changing....fo realz.",

I was ordering drinks and mulling over what to order my non-alcohol drinking friend other than soda. The bartender made some great suggestions, made him a drink that looked like a cocktail but wasn't and made the him feel like one of the crowd. I found the fact that she took the time to make suggestions and be very friendly about it, even though the bar was packed, to be a nice change from the brusque attitude you usually get from bartenders in that situation. If you sit in one of the booths, there is a cocktail waitress and for you smokers (cough cough hack weez) the smoking area is kind of cool. Drinks are excellent. The bartender made us some crazy shots with pomegranate juice and pomegranate liqueur and something else. Crack, maybe, since they tasted so good.\n Check this place out.",

I walked in with the infamous Nish N and of course the bartender knew his name. You could say that he's a bit of a regular here. He asked the lovely bartender to make him, his wife and our friend one of their infamous cocktail concoctions. And then for me he asked for a virgin cocktail that was so good I'd feel drunk. The bartender worked her magic and I ended up with a fruity drink that was way tastier than any cocktail I've had in the past. Who needs alcohol?  We were able to score a table (not too crowded on a Wed evening) and enjoy our cocktails.

Nothing special.  I was told I came on a bad night. Whatever that means, the feel of the place was blah too, the waiter at the bar not too friendly and the people seemed quiet. I don't even remember the music.   If you're a bar in SF, sorry I'm expecting something more than another sterile, cookie cutter bar. Too bad I was really looking forward to finding something good.  Wouldn't be a place that I'd rule out forever but don't get your hopes up high, all in all nothing special.",

Love the look of the place, although the pool table at the end of the bar is awkwardly-placed and anyone playing a game typically has to worry about hitting patrons with their cue.   Drinks were standard lounge prices. Tasty and potent. Seems like a nice place to start off an evening and then jump somewhere else.",

The drinks took forever to make. \u00a0The bartenders/\"mixologists\" spent what felt like at least 10 minutes per drink, and trying to get their attention was almost equally as frustrating.  The ambiance (if there was one) felt like I was in a very crowded, black room. \u00a0Very dim, very dark, very stuffy.

Still, if you come for an early happy hour during the week, it is quite delightful. You might even get a sofa seat and table service. Score. Bartenders... sorry I mean mixologists, are pretty deliberate with their concoctions which means meticulously crafted cocktails if you don't mind the wait. Leave your ID as collateral for a copper mug and enjoy a crisp Moscow Mule. Also like the fact that they have a tiny smoking nook just inches from potential tenderloin street craziness. It sometimes can be a drink and a show.   Typically skipping Rye if it's packed, I don't mind it as a weekday happy hour spot in the Loin but it is getting competitive for \"craft cocktail\" bars in the neighborhood. Rye thankfully is an early pioneer.",

We sat at one of the tables- at around 9 the place is not terribly crowded- and are served by a very nice waitress who is patient as we deliberate over the oh so many mouthwatering cocktail choices. After careful consideration, my drink of choice consisted of gin with pummeled kiwi, cane sugar, cucumber, and lemon. In fact it came with a sliced cucumber floating inside and I made a comment, perhaps inappropriately so, to the waitress that it looked like spa water (ie that water they serve with cucumbers and fruits). Maybe she didn't know what I meant, since she looked appalled, but I quickly informed her that it was only a compliment, since I do indeed love spa water! I only tried one drink here, since next stop was Toronado, and I had the Bay to Breakers to run early the next morning, but I will indeed be back, and plan to sample a specimen closely related to the kiwi-cucumber variety, but instead with basil.

And it helps that my token gay friend has the best taste in music ever and is constantly introducing me to the hottest new repressed, emo chick-rock.  Most bars in this grand city must have tone def staff or just prefer to get funky to electronic remixes of bad pop songs that were crap even before the remix.  But Rye, oh my dear Rye, knows their shit. I'm telling you, if I can sip my frosty dirty martini while listening to \"Number One\" (I know, it sounds like she's referring to pee, but she's not, so just go with it) instead of the new R. Kelly song that makes me want to vurp my precious olives back up, I'll dry hump your leg in a nanosecond. Sound inviting? Cause it should. I'm that good. Well, not really. But I'll totally gossip with you and tell you totally inappropriate things I should never repeat. Deal?  In addition to the totally delectable dyke tunes this bar offers some amazing drinks that knock me on my ass, which to be quite honest, isn't that hard of a feat to accomplish. But the drinks are damn tasty. I haven't tried the fancy shit like raspberry, honey, mint gimlet with a dash of lavender body oil and a hint of vitamin E, but the dirty Ketel martinis treat me like a rock star.  The decor is modern, yet homey, although I will bitch a little about NEVER getting a seat here. Come on ladies, aren't those ass cheeks getting tired from sitting in the same spot for five hours straight? Why don't I help you get up and walk around a little? Well, soooorrrry! I just think your hooker ass has been taking up all the g-d damn seats for days! I mean my bad. You sit back down. I'll just stand here next to you and rub my blisters for a while.  The crowd varies from douche central (if The Ambassador is turning away crowds) to alright; I can hang with these folks as long as they stay the fuck off my toes and don't spill my delicious drink.  Another reason why I think this place is swank is because the few times I've come here the bouncer comments on how good I look in my driver's license photo. Dude, I'd stand in line at Dolce for three hours if the bouncers told me I looked hot in my ID. Err, ok, getting ahead of myself. But the bouncer at Rye can rub my blisters any day.",

As a smoker, you get to mingle with the other smokers in a fancy smoker cage, and as a non-smoker, you get to watch smokers mingle and do their mating dances, a la the zoo. It's a fascinating sociological-experiment night out. I'll be damned if I didn't see at least two future walk-of-shames come out of that cage. I wasn't exactly blessed with any record-breaking talents, but I do have the innate ability to spot THAT much.  I gave the bartender a list of my favorite drinks, and she concocted something of a raspberry-mojito-meets-a-bellini for me, and I sipped the hell out of it as I watched an episode of \"What Will Hook Up In The Cage?\".",

It's really hard being here on a Friday or Saturday evening when the crowd around the bar is over 3 people thick and everyone's packed like sardines against each other. But on the more lax evenings it's a great place to park myself on a stool and ask their friendly and expert bartenders to whip me up something on the fly.   They also have great community events. Recently, thanks to a tequila sponsor, they had invited many well known bartenders from across the city to compete on making the best mixed drink. Everyone was of good cheer as competitors egged each other on, stole equipment from each other, chatted up their neighbors and snuck sips from their rivals. Their creativity was amazing, as their concoctions held everything from hand-mashed watermelon, cinnamon, chili, fizzy baby tomatoes, mint, and the like. As a customer who happened to pick the right night to stop by, we got to sample all these amazing drinks and vote on our favorite.   In fact, I had SUCH a good time sampling oh so many drinks, I wobbled home and promptly passed out for the night, completely forgetting to close out my card from the beer I had pre-event. \u00a0  They still have my card (it's probably assumed reported lost and cut up by now). This was maybe 3 weeks ago.   Yes, beware the good times to be had at this place.",

That came to thirty bucks...not bad but not cheap either. The rum and coke was nice and strong(plus). There was a nice mix of people; no cheap and slinky shirt girls and ghetto boys. No dance floor but you could dance if you wanted and the music was great!(plus).

And he turned 25 so I was thinking he should be over that s*** ; but he was definitely all over and inside the sloppy drunk M.O. Then real subtle-like he turns his head and spews all over the floor next to the booth he's sitting in.SICK!! So I ask the bartender for a stack of paper towels and attempt to sop it up a bit. Everyone around me was all disgusted and his buddies were embarrassed and avoiding each other's gazes. The more paper towels I spread onto the mess the more comical it became...like sprinkling petals in a wedding or something. Someone came by with a can of Folger's coffee to sprinkle on the mess and it was swept up. Ingenious!! They left, or more accurately, they were helped out by the bouncers. After that it was smooth sailing. The bartenders were all really nice and when I closed my tab after the first and only round they took off part of the tab because of the whole vomit fiasco.

I've liked the aesthetic for a while--from the fact that they have a smoking patio so you don't have to stop the cocktail action while dosing yourself with cancer to the impressive, enormous wooden slab door that's pulled aside every night to kick off the evening. It's one hell of a fine-looking door.  Finally, after much walking past it and thinking to myself that I really needed to give it a try, I went in for some mid evening cocktails with a friend on a Tuesday night (about 8PM or so). They are, apparently, part of this whole cocktail haute couture that consists of \"mixologists\" making \"slow cocktails.\"  Look, darlin', I don't care how tasty of a cocktail it is, if I'm paying $12 I want my cocktail in something less than 20 minutes, especially when the bar is nearly completely empty!  We had two rounds of drinks, which took us until about 10:30 to manage, despite the fact that we weren't really nursing said drinks. Around 10, the bar started to fill up, and I can only imagine the cocktail service got even slower.  I enjoyed my drinks. I enjoyed my sips of my friend's drinks. It was just slow.  If slow is your thing, or at least you don't really much care, then give Rye a shot. I'd like to say it would be a good date location, due to the dark lighting and leg-touching conducive seating arrangements, but it can get loud. So, how much do you want to talk to your date? Decide accordingly.  I'd definitely steer clear on the weekend. I've never actually gone in, but again, living nearly right next door, I pass it on the regular, and it gets really crowded. Unless they exponentially increase the number of bartenders, service must get crazy slow.  A good place, I'm glad to have it in my neighborhood, but nothing to write home about.",

I was not impressed by the weird music or the drink selection. Thankfully I was in good company and Bourbon &amp; Branch was right around the corner to rescue the evening.  Pros: *Lots of seating *Cool atmosphere  Cons: *Bad music *Bad drink selection  Tips: *Don't order the prosecco - it tasted like the bottle had been open for months  Bottom line, don't make Rye a first stop or even a last stop in a night - the jury's still out on whether it's even worthy of a stop at all.",

Luckily when we walked in I noticed the about-to-be-a-real-bitch-to-us barfly comment to her friend about how much she liked my jacket. Hell yes. You know you love that feeling. Everyone does.   So after that little boost of confidence, I was set. Until the barfly reappeared to inform us it was a private party. Ehhh... whatever, we were already at the bar and I needed a drink, so we just kind of ignored her. That ended up working out juuuust fine.   I had the Aviation, which was great. The perfect amount of sweet without being overwhelming, I loved it. I also loved watching the bartendress carefully concoct the drink, sampling as she went along.   I returned the next night and sampled a fantastic Belgian, if only I could remember the name. It was pricey at $9, but as that's what I often end up paying for a Chimay so I suppose I can't complain. Again, the bartender was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and I really appreciated his candor.   Rye isn't the kind of place I'd make a regular hangout for me. I like my nightlife a little more divey and a little less \"private party.\"",

Um. \u00a0Right. \u00a0Rye has been open less than a year, Lainie, why you frontin'? \u00a0  'cause Rye is where my dad's bar used to be. \u00a0Way, way back in the day that space was called The Rebound (has there ever been a better name for a bar?) and my daddy ruled the roost there. \u00a0He was the man. \u00a0Mostly I just remember the long bar and my dad setting it up with me stowed behind the bar after being told emphatically to stay out of sight. . .I sat there for hours ganking marachino cherries out of the jar that was big enough to stick my whole head into (I know this 'cause I tried this). \u00a0Sometimes, after the beat cop had his daily shot and left, my dad would let me run around the bar and play pool or give me money for the juke box. \u00a0At home he was daddy or Bill or honey but here he was Willie and everyone knew him and everyone loved him. \u00a0My dad had a soft spot for folks that were down and out and there would be a line at the door at 6am when he came to open up because these guys knew dad was a softy and he'd hook them up with a shot on the house to steady their hands and nerves. \u00a0 When my dad died, it was SRO and a lot of people there were the same ones I saw in front of The Rebound when we would drop him off in the morning. \u00a0I was young when my dad passed away and a lot of my memories are of him in that bar. \u00a0   So cut to present day. \u00a0I had seen the spectacle that was Rye and had no interest in joining the fray - not my scene but I wanted to check out the place so I went at an off hour when I knew it would be empty. \u00a0Wow. \u00a0Total deja vu. .. it's completely different but somehow the same. \u00a0I sat at the bar and ordered a Jack Daniels, neat, raised the glass, toasted my pop and took the shot. \u00a0A wee tear escaped my eye so I threw a twenty down and walked out into the sunshine of Geary Street. \u00a0My eyes took a while to adjust to the sudden light, just like it did when I was a little girl.",

But we stopped in for happy hour yesterday ($2-off drinks) and it was quite nice. Dark and completely empty inside, and it was a beautiful day so we sat outside in the little caged in patio overlooking Geary. I cannot stress enough how very sweet the bartender was--just such a nice and funny guy. Such baretenders make life worth drinking. The beverages were top notch too. I had the Honey Melon (or something...it had honeydew in it)--very light and refreshing with mint; one friend had the Thai me up (??)--spicy drink with basil; and another the Apple Bomb (??), with apple brandy.

A reliable concoction for teenage angst or just plain new to SF rebellion.   I am really happy to see they have added more upbeat music these days. The ambiance is chill, dark, high ceilings, cool artwork, lounge tables, an outdoor patio for smokers, pool table, and two bathrooms. I seem to enjoy more Thursdays and Fridays here, but its always a pretty chill vibe.   The drinks are always top-notch and beautifully crafted. I recommend ordering sazerac, birds of a feather, pimms cup, mojito, old fashioned, campari, \u00a0and their usual specials.

Though the name of the bar is clearly an ode to a distilled spirit, that's where the connection to the modern-day mixology 'trend' ends. Here, you won't find a frontman ironically mustachioed for mere effect, you'll be hard-pressed to pick up on sneering attitude and you won't overhear contrived loose talk about the latest flavor in bitters just so said loose talker will appear well-versed in the art of cocktails, for the gain of street cred. And why not? Because the bartenders are too busy tending. Less talk, more legitimacy my friends.  I also appreciate that all of the bartenders can turn around a bonafide craft cocktail in less than five minutes... none of that unnecessary fluff is involved, which means my drink gets into my hands quicker = a happier, spendier me. It's true - a proper libation doesn't need to be coddled, nursed, weaned, sent to an Ivy league college and then groomed into corporate America's next millionaire to be good. Nope, it just needs to TASTE like a million bucks.  What else do you want to know? Just go, and now.",

Music was kinda \"rocking country.\" Love the other side of the bar where they actually have sofas for people to sit down and chat instead of pure standing room. The cage is definitely for chain smokers who love to have a drink in their hands at the same time...

The basil gimlet (made with gin) didn't sound all that special but it was flawless. Smooth as silk, well rounded, tasty. I could have sat at Rye for 3 hours, racked up a $100 bar tab , and drank these all night. Alas the others in my party saw this as more of a quick stop than a destination.

Rye is very rustic with the brick walls and an almost dive bar-ish type of feel. \u00a0I didn't venture around the place, but it was quite quaint with it being a smaller venue for a lounge. \u00a0Oddly enough, I didn't buy any drinks that night, so I can't tell you how much the drinks were, but I think I heard from a friend that it was around $7 per drink (typical). \u00a0They also have an outdoor standing area right around the front, which is nice for those who want to get some fresh SF air for a change. \u00a0I wasn't paying attention to the music much, but it wasn't really a lot of music that I'm attuned to, but the good thing about it was that it wasn't so loud that I couldn't hear what people were saying to me when I'm standing next to them.  In terms of lounges go, this place is a cool place to chill at especially if you don't want to pay a cover to go drinking with the buddies. \u00a0I think Saturdays was a bit too busy, but I can imagine going here on random days and getting yourselves a booth and chat / drink your night away. \u00a0And I almost forgot, parking is not that good in this area, so if you're driving then expect about 20-30 minutes to find parking.",

I kind of forgot what the name of it was because my vision was cloudy from having such a good time. Hah, but I vaguely remember the drink being called something along the lines of \"Scorned Wife\" or \"Scorned Lover\", either way the bitch was wrongfully scorned. But the outcome was totally delicious. These bartenders or, excuse me, mixologists have got their shit down to an art. If you're even the least bit unsure, these guys will treat you well and whip you up something that would probably suit your tastes.  Even on a Saturday night the place still had enough space to walk around and chit chat with friends, hang around the pool table, and come back just in time for your specialty cocktail. The music isn't too loud and it's a great place to lounge, especially in the smoker's den. It's a great hangout and every time I hang out at Rye, I definitely have a good time. Just come in a bit earlier so you can have some prime seating at the bar. But even then they have a server ready to take drink orders to you, too. So no need to fiercely guard that prime corner booth you've been looking at and finally got. Just sit back, relax, and tell me what the correct name of the Scorned lady drink is.",

Stopped in around midnight I think on a Saturday night and was met by a bar that didn't seem to resemble anything in the pictures. A dirty bar devoid of anything pleasant in a big gray rectangle shaped room. In the back was a heavily stained and dying pool table and to my right a broken bathroom door on it's last legs.   Beer selection? Pretty non-existent and nothing very good. No taps. When I asked the bartender just opened the fridge door and pointed at it. I ordered and sat down to contemplate my next destination while observing some sketchy people. One fellow was \"falling over drunk\" and kept using me to balance while he ordered another mixed drink at the bar. The bartender complied. WHY!? When a person is that drunk you don't give them another. Get them out-isn't that what you're paying the doorman for. The bartender looked like he was in college and a bit nervous.   In summary, perhaps I goofed on the demographic here and type of place I was anticipating (I just turned 30 and I don't think I'd like this place unless I was in college and looking for a bit of grungy lounge in a shady area). I always grade fairly and tend to err on the positive side, but this place got everything wrong.",

My friend and I just wanted a \"chill\" night so we ordered two drinks each. I wish I remember what they were called! I'll post a picture later. Anyway, they were pretty good. They took their time making the drinks, which a lot of bars don't usually do. So I'll commend them on that.   I do remember ordering two spicy watermelon margaritas. They were so good, a bit peppery and more on the spicy side though! I am a lover of watermelon and delicious fruity cocktails, so this was pretty good. It was only $6! I am not sure if they have this as a weekly promotion, but if you go - do try the margaritas. It isn't all too crowded, so it was easy to find a seat. I would say this is definitely a more \"pre-game let's chill here before we go hard\" kind of bar. Don't get too trashy, now.",

London Dry Gin, Bitterman's Commonwealth Tonic Liqueur, hopped grapefruit bitters and soda. It was a bit too heavy on the soda/tonic for my tastes, but was refreshing nonetheless. $9.  I happened to be at a hotel just down the street, so this was a welcomed find in the Union Square/Tenderloin area which all too often can feel like the Times Square of San Francisco.",

(ambassador is another spot, directly across the street)  they serve incredibly tasty liquor. their selection of scotch and whiskey is better than most hot spots. however, the prices for mixed drinks are insane for a spot in the 'loin.  i think the thing that bothers me most about this place is that it is a constant reminder of how great things COULD have been, but also how, in the end, chance and circumstance can ruin a very good thing.",

They did honor the prices, and charged us $10 for the two.  We also ended up trying the gimlet which seems to be the go-to drink here, and it definitely lived up to the hype. It was a very smooth combination of flavors, and for someone who's not well-versed in her alcoholic concoctions - this was good!  The crowd/line outside can seem a little intimidating, but it actually moves fast, and the bartenders are great. They are really well-staffed and we didn't have to wait long to order drinks at all.  It's a little more upscale than what my bf would call an \"everyday bar\", but it's nice for nights where you want to feel a little classier.

My best friend and I wanted a good bar to hang out at in the city on a Saturday night that was walkable from the BART station and I did a little research. It's a couple blocks from Union Square and at night the area is a bit sketchy, but Rye is such a cool place that once you're inside, you'll forget about the homeless people outside. The ambiance is awesome...cool, dark, candle-lit and pretty.   The bartenders are really good at the mixology they do, and hopefully you perused through Yelp before going here because you won't find their signature drinks on the menu since they are just THAT well known for them! Get the Basil Gimlet FOR SURE. One of the best drinks I've ever had. Really. Ever. But it's also dangerous because it tastes so good that I can't taste the alcohol. It'll hit you before you know it. The Flash is also good, but we had ours without kiwi for the night because they ran out. I'd be curious how much better it would taste with the kiwi instead. Ours was just more cucumber-y. Which was still delicious.   Ask them to make anything you want and I'm pretty sure they can do it. If you come early in the night, it's a great spot to chill and talk. We got there around 8:30 and left maybe an hour or so later so we probably avoided whatever crowds that might have come later at night and had a pretty good spot on a couch to talk as well as at the bar top counter. The space at the bar is very limited though, so I can imagine it would be hard to get your drinks later in the night. All in all, we had a chill experience and I'd come back. Just wish they had food to munch on too!   P.S. I followed Thia G and Ngoc N's suggestion to order from a guy bartender since they need that arm strength to crush the basil and shake up your drinks real good :)",

Cheryl got my first drink to which my only preference was that there be no vodka in it (as I had a bad time with vodka the night prior). The bartender fixed up some crazy drink with ginger beer and at least three different bottles of alcohol (I couldn't see which ones since I wasn't at the bar), a slice of lemon and lime, two mint leaves, and a slice of cucumber. It was really good.  The atmosphere is nice, but the drinks are pricey, or more pricey than I'm used to. But their drink selection is positively unique!

Perhaps because it is tucked away in the Tenderloin it's far enough off the touristy beaten path of Union Square.  This place is known for hand-crafted cocktails -- in the tradition of the speakeasies that have popped up all over recently. I tasted quite a few, some better than others. I'd definitely like to come back on a quieter night and enjoy them more thoroughly.  Decor is chic and subdued. Service was a little scattered, but I guess that's to be expected on a holiday. Music selection confused me very much. Didn't start playing anything remotely upbeat 'til about midnight.

I love gin and the GF hates it but even she was impressed. These people come up with some weird drinks but they are worth trying (probably not in the same night unless your piggy bank is really full).  One issue I have run into the 2 times I was here is the service. Everyone is very nice but they seem to be understaffed. They work hard and as fast as they can but when some of the drinks require a significant amount of manual labor the drink orders start to stack up. \u00a0They seem to put the effort into their drinks, which is awesome, but they need an extra set of hands.  UPDATE: Went to Rye this week for a birthday party and had a great time. Drinks were as great as ever and the bar didn't seem to suffer from being understaffed (I imagine going on a Tuesday had something to do with it).  I would love to leave my 4 * rating alone for this place but something happened after I left:  I made the incredibly rookie mistake of leaving my credit card at the bar... I know I know but there is a first time for everything I guess. When I went by the next day to pick up the card they were happy to return it to me saying:  \"There is nothing to sign we already closed the card out last night... have a good day.\"  Cool! The amount was right: $40 for 4 drinks not cheap but not wallet breaking either.  A few days later I discover that in addition to the drinks they added on their own $6 tip for the night (exactly 15% for you non math majors).  I don't mind that they added a tip and I am totally in favor of tipping bartenders (not an easy job!). But I am pretty pissed they tacked it on without letting me know and then gave no indication that it was done.  It feels like they are trying to put one over on me. \u00a0I'm not going to dispute the charges or make a stink in the bar but it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth.",

Rye is spry...and a good gin drink is the apple of my eye.   Thanks to Nish to promoting a Damrak mixology contest here, I decided to go.   I love the bar, very extensive array of fine spirits and clients in even better spirits. And what was even better, the drinks were on the brand! Woo hoo!  As an ex-smoker, I really admired the glass enveloped smoking cage they have created at Rye. It easily gives you access to the street to talk to your friends or enemies who are coming/going as well as provides a hefty set of ghetto bars to keep you safe from the n'er do wells of the TL.   I especially like the look of the brick wall you can prop yourself up against in your fedora to puff while looking oh-so-cool-and-aloof....as if a basil gimlet never made your taste buds dance like a stripper with ants in her...pants?  It's also breaks up the design of the bar quite well, and kudos to them for having THREE very clean bathrooms in the joint. Did I mention they also had a pool table?   Douchebags aside, it was nice to be amongst the pretty people for a night with new and exciting drinkies to try.",

Strong drinks (around $9) Somewhat slow service since each drink takes a while to make. Mildly pretentious. No cover.  Take all that, mash it together and ta daaa!! You have RYE.",

    "review_text": "I don't know what happened to me, but I am just not the young whipper snapper that I was 2 years ago. I used to love the loud, trendy, over priced lounges that have always infected NYC, but after moving to SF, I have seemed to have lost my love for everything that is the \"lounge\" or even worse, the \"ultra lounge\". But when I came to Rye, it was a special evening.   Seong, Omar and the gang were here having drinks and Eugy and I wanted to meet them to celebrate our engagement. After driving from Cupertino to SF with a drunk Eugy, I definitely needed a drink! hah... So we said yes, we will venture into the FiDi on Friday night. Parking was a bitch and once at Rye, squeezing our little short frames into the bar was even a challenge.   10 minutes in there and I felt as if I were in a sauna. Cramped to the core, sucky music and extremely rude bartenders? Why the hell would anyone want to come here??   After 20 minutes, I was sweaty, my ears hurt and I kept saying \"it's past my bedtime\".. It was time to go. And I'll never come back.",
