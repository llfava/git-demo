Because that's when you get the best of everything; and in the case of Kanpai Lounge, you get great service and even better drinks! Located just one block away from Union Square and within walking distance from BART (don't drink and drive), if you're looking for a semi-private area to have a casual business meeting or meet with friends for a few drinks, look no further. Keep it classy at Kanpai Lounge!:)",

I'm really interested in seeing what they do with the performance space, there's a lot of potential there. For now though, they've got a great selection of spirits and it seems like it could be a sweet place to take a date or meet up with people.",

The wait staff were very attentive; we actually had TWO tending to us!! LOL!! Even when we asked to order desert, the waiter graciously told us the kitchen had closed but accommodated our request for chocolate for our teas anyway! The drinks are a bit pricey but I am from NY so I am used to those prices, but they were delicious. I will definitely visit this establishment again!!",

    "review_text": "Anyone that knows my dining partner &amp; I, knows we are pork connoisseurs. If pork does not hit our table in a great way, I will discuss it openly. With that being said, we ordered the pork skewers &amp; were sadly disappointed. When your menu says the pork is glazed, we expect a melt in our mouth, sugary piece of pig to excite our taste buds. Instead, we received a poorly plated &amp; seasoned pig on a stick that was dry, \u00a0not so tasty &amp; glazeless. They were sent back.  We move on to the chicken spring rolls. It's hard to mess up fried food but it was hard to swallow the price for 3 rolls @ $12. You can get the whole bag from the market for $3.99 &amp; be happier. They were decent &amp; their peanut sauce was great. We also ordered the chef's special Makimono(sushi). It was salmon rolls with spicy tuna on top. It was better than the pork, but wasn't \u00a0spectacular. \u00a0  My dining companion commented , \"For San Francisco, I expected a better menu for the price.\" We would agree. We do not believe any local would regularly hang out here when a well priced happy hour is steps away from them. The pricing seems to be geared toward hotel guests &amp; tourists. We paid $60 for 2 appetizers &amp; 2 cocktails. That would have been a great dinner somewhere else. We felt we were paying for the ambiance of the room, rather then the quality of food.",
