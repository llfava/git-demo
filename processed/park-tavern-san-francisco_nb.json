    "review_text": "This place has potential, but it currently still has teething pains. Arrived on time for a Friday 9PM reservation, but the table wasn't ready yet. Instead of giving us a spiel about how it would only be 10-15 minutes, they gave us some free drinks. The drinks arrived fast, but our table was already prepared so they comped us the drinks. Nice!  Out of the deviled eggs from the appetizer list which bummed out the GF since she wanted to try them. Wait, out of deviled eggs? How can you run out of eggs? Anyway, by the time the table next to us ordered, they were out of 2 other appetizers. So yeah, teething pains. The raw halibut was great. The brussel sprouts were tasty, but had way too much lemon. Tell Juan to chill out with the lemon bottle. Appetizers came out quickly and promptly.  It took a while (20-30 minutes after apps cleared) for the main course. After arrival, the food was cold and my pork was undercooked. The GF's scallops were coldish, too. Dunno if this was a kitchen screwup or waitstaff, but I'm guessing kitchen. (The table next to us had similar delays). My pork was undercooked. I'm ok with the new pink-in-the-middle trend, but my pork was cold and red. Not medium, but more on the medium-rare to rare side. That aint cool. Luckily, the waiter came to check on us, I told him, he took it away and fixed it up. Upon returning he said he should have told me that's how they serve it and that it's \"brined.\" I don't care if it's been irradiated. You can't serve pork that rare in a dark restaurant. Everyone will think it's way undercooked (mine was and it was cold). Plus, pork that rare doesn't have the same texture as beef. PT staff if you're reading this, make sure they cook the pork to medium! Food was good, once it was recooked and the GF's scallops were tasty.  Overall the ambiance is weird. It feels like a NYC boisterous alphabet soup lunch spot....yet they're mainly going after the dinner crowd. I can't quite put my finger on it. There are some great restaurants which are loud and dynamic like Galatoire's in NOLA. I just can't say what's off about this place, but something is. GF and I both think that we'll be going to Marlowe instead of PT in the future.  Service was excellent, so keep up the good work there.",

    "review_text": "Park Tavern is a perfect place for a date where you can sit outside during nice weather. Or just a perfect place for reunion or sex-and-the-city kind of brunch.  Service was good and not overwhelming; parking was tough but there's $10 brunch valet.   Unfortunately it was hard to love the food here. Our crab toast was delicious but there was't sufficient crab. Veal Schnitzel sounded much nicer than how it really tasted. Surely bacon fat eggs that accompanied the veal sounded delicious but there was nothing special with the taste. Perhaps the concept was similar to duck fat french fries but was not good once implemented. Even worse, the schnitzel seemed like something you can fry it yourself at home.   The dessert on the other hand was quite good.  TCHO chocolate creme brulee was not your regular brulee because there wasn't hard sugar to coat the creme. The taste was decent and the salt was a good touch. Panna Cotta with orange was good but also not great - you could possibly find the same dessert at other joint.   All and all, Park Tavern has a warm ambience for intimate dinner. You won't be disappointed if you lower your expectation or if you are here when you are hungry from the mad Mama's line.",

The fried brussel sprout leaves were everything I dreamed about...crisp, salty and nice hint of lemon. The girls loved the burger they shared and I thought the fries that accompanied it were solid with a nice horseradish aioli. Also had the delicious deviled eggs, the thinly sliced jalape\u00f1o was sweet and spicy &amp; divine. Beautiful interior, welcoming and on point service. Can't wait to go back.

    "review_text": "Our friends made a reservation for 6 of us on a Sunday at 2pm and when we arrived we were promptly checked in and seated. The place is large on the inside with high ceilings and an overall nice decor. We were all vegetarians but we do eat eggs. We shared a baguette with a trio (pistachio, walnut, almond) of nut butters and honey to start -- despite being house-made the texture was not spreadable on the baguette, the nut butters were under salted (it tasted like they used raw, unsalted nuts), and lacked bold nutty flavors. We also tried the avocado toast which was delicious, but the portion was small (1 piece of toast, halved). We ordered the crispy polenta cakes and brioche french toast. The brioche french toast was well executed -- crispy on the outside but soft and eggy on the inside with a delicious blueberry compote. However, the highlight of the meal was the crispy polenta cakes, which were essentially 2 deep friend polenta cakes (crisp outside, soft, creamy inside) with a poached egg and a mushroom-truffle salad. This was one of the best brunch dishes we have had in San Francisco. Our friends ordered french toast as well as the oatmeal pancakes and everyone was happy with their order. One thing to note -- the kitchen closes at 2:30pm so all food orders must be in by then. We were surprised and appreciative of the complimentary coffee cake which we received at the end of the meal -- it was also pretty tasty.  Overall, we enjoyed having brunch here and would highly recommend it. It is close to Mama's but takes reservations which is a huge plus.",

    "review_text": "Park tavern is such a great place in the neighborhood to get a fancy meal and treat yourself. It's basically impossible to get a reservation, but we decided to go and eat at the bar, which turned out to be a lot of fun. The bartenders are so friendly and helpful, and they sat us almost immediately. I ordered the Mclaren (Hendrick's Gin, cucumber, lemon &amp; ginger beer) which was delish. We decided to try a bunch of things on the menu, which ended up being a great idea. For starters, we ordered the venison carpaccio, the deviled eggs, and the brussels sprout chips. The carpaccio wasn't that great, and there was too much onion on it. The deviled eggs were fantastic though, and the chips were also very good.   For the entree, I ordered the poulet noir and my date ordered the mussels, cockles and clams. The chicken was AMAZING (caps are necessary here). I actually finished the entire chicken, and wow, the truffle flavor! And that stuffing! And that juiciness! Almost too much to handle. Seriously though, if you don't like food really salty, or think that truffles can be overpowering, I would not suggest this dish. It was verrrry flavorful. Thankfully I can't get enough of salt, so it worked out in my favor. The mussel dish was also delicious, especially the broth! And the bread, which is soo good, is the perfect way to sop it all up. When the dish first arrived we noticed that a good number of clams/mussels were still closed, and when we brought it to the bartender's attention, he immediately brought them back to the kitchen and we were given a new bowl. We also ordered a bottle of white wine which was reasonably priced and perfectly complimentary to the meal.  I really appreciated how attentive the servers were. They knew when to step in, and when to give us time. They also knew the menu inside and out. While the meal as a whole might be worth 4 stars, the service and overall ambiance makes it a 5. Will definitely be going back!",

We went to the bar to grab a cocktail, and were seated 20 minutes later. It was the perfect opportunity to try one of the many specialty cocktails they make.   I went with the Twin Peaks drink which was a Four Roses drink and I actually didn't like it at all. It was way too sweet for my taste. I asked the bartender to add something to take some of the sweetness away, and he graciously made me a totally new drink that had more lemon and I really enjoyed. My husband got the classic manhattan, it was made very well.   Once we were seated we ordered the scallop, shrimp and crab salad since we knew we were going to both get beef for our entrees. I really enjoyed it. \u00a0Very light way to start the meal. I then got the Bar Steak, which was served with french fries. It was cooked perfectly rare, just the way I ordered it. The steak was seasoned perfectly. Overall it was very good, I was just wishing the juices form the steak didn't get all over my delicious fries. Maybe the fries in a dish would prevent this.   The It's It dessert was the best. Mint ice cream with crunchy cookie crumbles and a hard shell on top. I highly recommend it! The service was also attentive, friendly and help with suggestions.",

Not always easy to come by!  Here's a run down of what we had:   Deviled eggs. Yum! A crisp and crunchy piece of bacon atop the light whipped yolks, just a touch of heat in the back of your throat from the pickled jalapenos!  Compressed Watermelon and goat cheese salad with olives. Perfect salty and sweet combo. The watermelon was sooooo good!  Brussel sprout chips. A great munchie app. Nice touch of citrus. Not overpowering but just right.   My friend had the seafood special. I tried her scallop and fried oyster. Both very tasty. She cleaned her plate so I imagine the other sea creatures were also delicious.  I had the roast chicken. It was insanely good! I would say better than Zuni! They poured fresh au jus with lemon over the chicken when it was served which sizzled in the skillet and blended beautifully with the spinach. My friend was eating my spinach before I even took a bite!   A-Mazing waiter. So fun. He didn't rush us along and was very helpful in explaining different items on the menu. He gave us a free dessert on top of the dessert we ordered. Chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with sea salt and then he brought us chocolate ice cream on cocoa nibs which was light and sweet. They apparently do whipped egg whites with whipping cream. So light and fluffy! Heaven.   Will def be coming back here!",

The ambiance and service at the place are spectacular. The food is original and quite delicious. My only hope is that they might add a few more items to the menu. I was also unimpressed by the brunch drinks. Their Bloody Mary was way too spicy and I am still not sure what they were trying to accomplish with their Tequila Based Bloody Mary as it came out in an odd green color and had a rather odd flavor to it.  Ordering Advice: I see that people have been writing about the toast below. I actually found the toast to be quite delicious. It is a little bit expensive and rather basic, but there is something quite original and truly delicious in the toast creations that they have made. If you are in a large group, they are a great starter.  For main courses I would recommend the duck pate sandwich and the polenta. Both were so delicious.

My entree was the pork chop. A thick, double cut, pork chop. Let me tell you... I was reluctant to order it, not because I dislike pork (quite the contrary, as pork is my favorite protein when done right), but because pork is all too often done poorly at nouveau American joints. I'm not sure what prompted me to actually order it this time, but I'm sooooo glad I did. This was one of the best pork chops I ever had. It was cooked perfectly medium rare, the flavor was full and smokey, it was fatty but not excessively so, and it was quite juicy.  I will end it right there before I drool on my keyboard.",

I've been here twice now (both times for their brunch) and I think this is a great place to grab brunch with a friend or a group of friends, since they take reservations. This place is a little bit nicer than the average brunch place. I think it's decorated in a really clean and cute style.  For brunch, Park Tavern serves an assortment of little bites (toast with various toppings, pastries, fruit, etc.) as well as larger entrees and cocktails.   We had (see photos!):  POMELO &amp; AVOCADO (8) - cottage cheese &amp; cracked black pepper. This appetizer was very light, refreshing, and healthy. I thought it was a good start to our meal, but something I could definitely prepare at home.  PAN-FRIED CORNED BEEF HASH (16) - crispy potato, poached egg, arugula &amp; red wine jus. This was super delicious. Last time, I had a chicken hash, but I thought the beef hash with the red wine jus made this dish taste even better! I loved how savory and flavorful the sauce was, and I liked the crispy texture of the potato and hash, along with the soft poached egg. It was a tad bit on the salty side, but I would most definitely order this again. Highly recommended!  WARM OPEN-FACED DEVILED EGG SANDWICH (14) - pickled jalape\u00f1o, chicken breast, bacon &amp; provolone cheese (served with skinny fries). I wasn't the biggest fan of this dish. I thought it tasted more like a chicken sandwich and couldn't really detect the deviled egg component. The fries were really good though!And just a tip, we got some hot sauce on the side to add some bite.

Wine - expensive, but well paired.  Service - on point.  Wait - if you don't make reservations well in advance you can still show up and wait for a cancellation. We got lucky doing that but you can't count on it and you have to be with a group (or date) who's good natured enough to be willing to waste an hour or so hanging out in the bar. If you keep good company this shouldn't be a problem.  Price - it's expensive. but it's worth it so just be prepared for it. Decide before hand wether you can afford it so once you get there you can forget about it. This isn't a place to go if you have to worry over every little item. But if you decide you can treat yourself then do it! Enjoy yourself, check the diet and the budget at the door, you can pick them up on your way out.

What a fabulous restaurant and I can't believe it's taken me 2 years since its birth to get here.   The venue is fantastic - high ceilings, lots of space, outside seating (the sun, when out, always hits north beach nicely), and modern-rustic decor. This would be a good place to take your out-of-town family for brunch rather than a girls mimosa thing.   The service...wonderful! Given the older, more serious, and well-dressed demographic, I was expecting some attitude when my friends and I rolled in our in Sperry's and t shirts. It wasn't so. Not only that, we had about a 3 hour brunch discussing important things like yoga class logistics, breakups, and pedis (I know, #marinagirlproblems) and not once were we given looks or hints to leave...as a matter of fact, the server who didn't even have our area refilled our water as we gossiped and figured out our early-twenties lives.   The food - very, very good. I recommend:   1. Open-faced deviled egg sandwich with chicken and jalapeno. The jalapeno adds a great kick to the entree.   2. Crispy polenta cakes. Interesting mix of poached eggs on top of lightly fried polenta. I really appreciated the contrast in textures of these two. And mushrooms came with this dish. They were fantastic.   3. Marlowe burger. I don't eat beef, but my friend was very satisfied.   This is not one of those absurd wait-time brunch places, but they do take reservations, so call ahead.",

Thanks to stellar California weather, it was perfectly comfortable easting on their patio at 8 pm. The food was exceptional, and I found myself wishing I wasn't watching calories. We shared a variety of appetizers, and I could have eaten an entire plate of any of them. I had a pork chop, which was enormous, cooked perfectly, and was really tasty. Might be the best pork chop of the year. I've walked past this place several times over the years, and always wondered what it was like. Now that I know..I'll not walk past it again.",

After about 15 mins, no one had come out to take our drink order or turn the lights on. So I went to ask about the lights, they went on, then after 10 mins, they went off again...this happened all night.  When we finally ordered, the appetizers came out fast and the waiter was polite but we never got the warm rolls everyone keeps raving about. The ikura and fish dip, mushroom soup, and arugula salad were decent, but nothing stood out. (much like Marlowe, their other restaurant, that we live 2 mins from)  We waited another 20 mins after we were done with our apps, and watched our waiter help other tables, and our main course still hadn't come out. There was no apology, no explanation, no acknowledgement that there was a very long wait between courses.   The steak was was a little tough, not too flavorful, and just disappointing. I thought about giving them two stars but the apps were good and the ambiance is great, they could work on their service a bit as well.",

For starters you don't bring kids to a tavern, there was no dartboard, and they have waaaaay too many kinds of wine to be a real tavern.  That being said it was a nice place with good service. I really liked the menu options but still settled on the well named Marlowe burger. It was a nice piece of beef with bacon and caramelized onions. Fries on the side with a beer up top and I was ready to praise this place as a great new stop. Prices were in the middle of the road but it was a nice place so the $14 for a burger didn't seem too out of line. They did have Speakeasy and IPA on tap after all...  Onward boys!",

The menu and ingredients are promising, and it's in a gorgeous space -- and it serves beautiful food to beautiful people. \u00a0Service can be disjointed, though always friendly. But the food is uneven. \u00a0Some dishes in the same section of the menu are very small, some are pretty big, most are rather oily, and quality varies between visits. \u00a0And it's all a tad pricy for being often less than stellar.  I've had one perfect Marlowe Burger here. Other times, the bun has been stale (even after sending it back -- though, I got it, I was there on Stale Bun Day), the patty mis-prepared, or it was too salty.  Loved the spiciness and juiciness of the Poulet Rouge, but I only had it once and its vegetables were so salty and oily that I can't quite bring myself to order it again.  The deviled eggs, with pickled jalapeno and bacon, have always been perfect, and the build-your-own Fried Caesar Salad is fun and tasty.  The Grilled Sea Scallops dish has a cool combination of flavors, but the scallops were overcooked.  The brunch dish with kiwi and strawberry w/ whipped coconut milk is refreshing, and the avocado toast is, as well, as long as too much oil isn't poured onto it. Many of their main brunch dishes seem to involve lots of eggs on top.  Drinks are consistent and the wine always at the perfect temp, though the brunch Boozie Smoothie really should be served in something larger than a coupe martini glass.  I love the idea of the Birthday Cake dessert, and it's always superbly airy, but sometimes bland.  I'll probably still come here -- it's really the only modern SF restaurant of its kind in North Beach -- but I still hope that it lives up to what it wants to be. \u00a0If I didn't live close by, I would never go out of my way to go here.",

Had not checked out this location since the venerable Moose's closed and so wasnt sure what to expect. The place was packed and so we sat at the communal table - fantastic experience and fantastic meal! The menu isn't extensive but very well-rounded and everything sounded great. The recommendations from the people sitting around us made the decisions even more difficult as everyone was raving about what they were eating. I finally decided on the Halibut with fennal and potatoes but was still debating on the sides - either Dungenss Crab Salad or Smoked Pumpkin Soup. The waiter recommended the soup, which I ordered and it was truly spectacular; it had a very smoky flavor, toasted pumpkin seeds and fried sage - outstanding! The Halibut was perfectly seared and roasted and was served with fennel with an excellent creamy-type sauce on it - very nice combination and something I'm going to try to recreate at home. My friend had the short ribs, which were extremely tender and flavorful. I had no expectations of having dessert, but I succumbed to \u00a0the \"White Russian\" Affogato - fabulous! Homemade white russian ice cream with an espresso and rum sauce and homemade marshmallow and cocoa nibs. Really spectacular and not overly large, which for me is actually a good thing in a dessert. My friend had the Almond Joy and raved about it as well.   The service was very good, although perhaps a tad slow, but really nothing to complain about. The other diners at the communal table were all very social and we had a great time talking with everyone so any slowness really wasn't an issue. The atmosphere is excellent - upscale and a bit trendy, but restrained and tasteful at the same time. Overall a very diverse crowd with a very healthy sampling of the young and beautiful.   Park Tavern is a great addition to the North Beach dining scene and I will definitely return. I strongly recommend it!",

The food and drinks were outstanding but what really put it over the top was the opportunity to sit in the best seats of the house- the chef's table.   Coming in on a Saturday night without reservations can be risky, but luck was on our side! We could have sat at the communal table at the bar, or at the chef's table- which is on the side toward the restrooms...but you get to see all the chefs working their magic and creating magnificent looking dishes. They work very efficiently and the plates they're carefully assembling look mouthwatering and absolutely beautiful. It made dining at Park Tavern dinner and a show. When I come back I only want to sit here!   The food didn't disappoint either. Some of the chefs were laughing at us because we were outright enjoying our food so much! We started with the brussel sprout chips which were AMAZING! I could seriously eat these all day, everyday. They were nicely seasoned and fried for just the right amount of time. Next, we got the duck liver mousse which was smooth and flavorful. (Note: different from foie gras, but a perfect alternative now after the state ban). The plate comes with two generous spoonfuls of the mousse, cherries, pistachios and grilled bread. Finally, we got the burger. Mmmm...from the first bite you can immediately tell all the ingredients are high quality and it just melts in your mouth! There are fries with a horseradish dip that accompany the burger which also were perfection.   From there, there wasn't much more room for dessert and we really wanted to try the Birthday Cake- so I'll be back soon for the brussel sprout chips and a slice of cake!",

We grabbed some drinks at the bar and waited for our table and got to visually explore the mix of modern and classic style of the restaurant. \u00a0Upon being seated my SIL was again wished a happy birthday by the server!

They were amazing, I couldn't get enough! \u00a0The fries were seasoned and hot and accompanied by a soft cooked egg to one side and the egg was topped with caviar, it was the perfect dipper! \u00a0ON the other side was a truffle aioli. \u00a0We ate every single fry. \u00a0The waygu jerky was exactly as described, beef jerky....kind of an interesting app. \u00a0The deviled eggs were fine, but not something I\"d explore again unless I had a craving although the jalapeno being pickled did add an interesting flavor that I was not expecting.  I ordered the scallops as did the other gentleman at our table and he loved them. \u00a0I found them salty and didn't care at all for the way the mushrooms were prepared. \u00a0I talked to the server and told him honestly, this dish was not for me. \u00a0It may just be my personal taste, but I'd prefer to have pretty much anything on the menu. \u00a0He was completely understanding and offered the pork chop. \u00a0What at great suggestion, this was one of the juiciest pork chops I have ever tried. \u00a0I almost cleaned my plate.

Because every single time I've gone here, the prices have gone up. They've been open for less than a year.  Two examples off the top of my head: deviled eggs - from $1.50 each to $2 after they were featured in 7x7's 100 list. That might not sound like a lot, but it comes out to about a 33% increase. Next: the PT fries. I can't remember exactly what they used to be, but it was under $15 (probably more like $12). They're now $20!!! They're just potatoes with some truffle oil and caviar that you can't even taste.  I understand that you have to pay for quality food in San Francisco, but could the owners be any more money grubbing? I guess this is what happens when restaurant owners care more about money than loyal customers. I'm not sure if they think that the locals won't notice the large increases or if they're banking on a tourist crowd that will never know they're getting screwed, but they've definitely turned this local away for good.

The fried pork-belly bites with horseradish aioli are not to be missed. The whole chicken with greens was stellar (albeit a scooch salty for my taste). The yummy, cheesy twice-baked potato topped off our American Heart Association recommended meal.   I also give extra star power to the lively, lovely space the new proprietors have created. Also of particular note: these folks seem to be making a point to pay attention to the neighborhood, it's long-standing businesses, those who live here. They \"bring it\", but do so with a complete lack of hubris and they seem very sweetly inclined to honor North Beach's true character and long history.  Go here. You won't be disappointed.",

    "review_text": "New favorite restaurant in sf. We've been trying to get to park tavern for a while now but unsurprisingly it took forever to get a saturday reservation. Annoying. Worth the wait though as park tavern lived up to the hype. One of the coolest atmospheres I've seen in a while, a great bar area and scene to have a cocktail before dinner. The vibe of the whole restaurant is lively but cozy and classy, hard to explain but pretty much exactly what I'm looking for. The hostess was very friendly and even offered us a few choices as to which table we wanted.  As for the food, top notch! Everything we tried was absolutely amazing, the only exception being the burrata which was a bit strange and not very good. Deviled eggs, amazing but I actually like wayfare's better but these are awesome as well. Demons on horseback were also a pleasant surprise that I would order again. For entrees we ordered the mussels and pork. Mussels were good and the cream sauce was something different that you usually don't see mussels in. The pork was some of the best I've tasted in a while. So tender and flavorful!! Amazing. We also shared the twice baked potato and brussel sprout chips. Both I'd consider must haves. I would say the dessert was a little bit of a letdown but by this point we were so full I didn't care that much.   Bartender, hostess, waitress were all very nice and accommodating. Prices aren't cheap but fairly standard for sf dining. Parking is tough but they \u00a0have valet if needed for 10$ or cab it. Will definitely be back ASAP had a fabulous time!!",

    "review_text": "I had the most delicious meal at Park Tavern last night. Great ambiance, great food, and great service. Since our meal was last minute, we weren't able to get a reservation and ate at the communal table. This was a perfect solution and was great.   Favorite food item: For sure, for me it was the venison carpaccio. Slices venison, small bite size deep friend bone marrow, and a nice portion of steak tartare made this wonderful. Lots of hidden little flavors that popped out along the way.   Gnocchi was another win. Delicious and light.   We also had the scallops and the sole. I am not sure in the future I would have ordered both of them. The sole was a little heavy and I was hoping for something lighter. By the end of that meal, I was a bit over salted, and I love salt. I think I would have ordered one or two more appetizers.   The waiter picked our dessert. (We like surprises!) When it came and I had a bite, I immediately was transported to my Bay Area childhood days- a restaurant version of an Its It. Combined with a pot of french pressed coffee and some good conversation, it was a really good night and very delicious.   I can't wait to go back.",

    "review_text": "Have been looking forward to trying out this neighborhood restaurant for a while. Finally had the opportunity to check it out for Sunday brunch with a group of friends. One great plus is that they do accept reservations and you can find them on OpenTable.  The restaurant itself is beautifully done, classic and modern which matches the food being served. They have a great selection of dishes for brunch that covers everything from vegetarian options to great American breakfasts. The wife had the Crispy Polenta Cakes that she describes as \"delish.\" I had the Cast-Iron Baked Farm Eggs which was also an awesome dish. The food is heavy, but the portion is reasonable. The quality is very high which allows them to charge the premium prices that they do.  So why only 3 stars, you're asking yourself. Well, when we were first sat and our waiter came to take our drink order, he was obviously disappointed that we were not ordering alcoholic drinks. The whole backside of the menu is dedicated to cocktails, beer, wine, etc. But, you know, not everyone is looking to get shwasty pants in the middle of the day on a Sunday. That should not change the way that the waiter treats you. Plus, technically and for etiquette you're not required to tip on alcohol anyways, so y'know.   Anyways, we enjoyed our time and one of the other members of our party had her diet coke refilled a few times throughout the meal. When we received our bill at the end she was charged full price (somewhere around $3) each time they refilled her drink. What place does that? I understand if they're coming out with a small bottle/can each time that they would charge you. But when they're filling it at the fountain? You definitely do not expect it to be charged. If you are going to charge, at least say that when you're offering a refill and not make it seem like it's a complimentary service.  Regardless, we brought this to our waiter's attention and he did take the additional charges off of the bill. Again acting slightly disappointed with us. I will definitely be back to give them another chance, perhaps at dinner when I will be ordering a cocktail, but when you're already paying a premium price it's annoying to leave feeling like they were trying to nickel and dime you.",

For starters, we got stuck at a 2 person table up against a wall and squished up against another table. I can understand that table for a walk-in but with a reservation - I expect better. Then the service was totally slow. I am in no rush but don't take my drink order and walk away for 25 minutes to come back for an appetizer order. If these guys consider themselves upscale then they should offer those services. My husband and I decided to share the soup of the day. To serve us the soup, she brings a large bowl with two spoons and expects us to share that way. Come one...split the soup into 2 bowls like every other \"upscale\" restaurant. I had to ask them to do this. The wild arugula mushroom salad was incredibly salty so don't get that. Lastly, my husband's entree which was the steak was COLD. This place is OVERRATED.",

    "review_text": "\"YOU'RE SO HOT!\" Those were the words my buddy James dared me to write on the check as we left, for our gorgeous waitress.   And when someone says \"I dare you,\" I'm all in since I feel that my honor is at stake.  Came here for lunch and had the banana-coconut fritters, crab toast, corned beef hash, and burger.  The fritters were undercooked and James said they were \"burnt,\" so we sent them back. I was hesitant though since I didn't want to draw more attention to use, since both of us couldn't help but notice that our waitress was stunning.  And you know me, around stunning women, I turn into a mime. Silent. Nervous. Stumbling around. Can't find my way out of an invisible box....  After we told her about the terrible fritters, she was great and took it off our bill, as James, who has enough confidence and swagger to fill the whole restaurant got her name.  She had no interest in me whatsoever, and honestly, I could have been wearing a chicken outfit and clucking and she still wouldn't have noticed I was there.  The crab toast was soggy, and had more water than mayonnaise. It also tasted like canned crab, though I'm sure it's not (or at least I hope it's not for $16).  The corned beef hash was hearty and flavorful, but I would have liked less arugula. It's not a salad after all. And the burger was surprisingly good too. James couldn't stop raving about the aioli. He could have cared less about the burger, he just wanted the aioli with fries. He's easy to please that way.  The waitress (who I won't embarrass by writing her name) was a good waitress and split the burger and fries for us so that we could share the dishes.  My only complaint was the crab toast, fritters, and 53 minute wait to get our burger and hash. Luckily, she was so gorgeous that I almost forgot the time (notice I said almost), cause it took forever to get our food. Hence the 4 stars.  We also tried the TCHO creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e because she recommend it. And in my eyes, she could have recommended anchovy creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and I would have bought it.  Anyways, after James dared me, I wrote the note on the bill gave her a 23% tip, and ran like a track star out of the restaurant as James walked out casually, laughing behind me.  P.S I didn't leave my # because knowing my luck she would have called me and asked for James LOL",

I've made this at home and the frying process is tedious because you have to pull each of the leaves off and quickly fry them or they burn. \u00a0It was OK. \u00a0The carrot soup was bland, $11. The butter lettuce was not remarkable. \u00a0The Marlowe burgers were the stand out and the fries were very good - crispy. \u00a0I'm not a big fan of burgers but this burger was moist and had good flavor with onions and lean crunchy bacon, $15. \u00a0The bar steak also accompanied by fries was disappointing. Jr.Yelper said the steak was chewy.  The Tcho chocolate creme brulee' was not what I expected.

    "review_text": "Park Tavern is in a prime location overlooking Washington Square Park, itself a crown jewel in the charming neighborhood of North Beach.  The difficulty in getting to the restaurant is eased by their valet parking, which is all but a necessity in North Beach. Easily worth the eleven dollar fee plus tip to not put yourself through trying to find parking anywhere in that vicinity.  We began the evening by sipping on a PT Old Fashioned and an Ed's Negroni while perusing the menu. These drinks were strong and gave us the impression that Park Tavern is going for an old school, no-nonsense approach to their cocktails. While the bartenders could certainly whip up one, don't count on seeing anything featuring egg whites on the drink menu. It also made me realize how firmly ensconced I am in new school cocktail culture. Guess I'm a wuss.  For food, we started with the NY Steak crudo, horseradish, arugula &amp; parmesan, and the PT fries, shaved black truffle &amp; parmesan, truffle aioli, soft boiled egg &amp; Osetra caviar. The presentation of each was great, the fries arriving in a small urn and the crudo plate sparsely yet artfully decorated with steak, arugula and parmesan. We would have preferred that the dish arrive with a third more steak than it did, but the quality was high. Those fries were *really* good. Every bit worth the twenty dollar price. With the shaved truffles on top, dipping the fries in that egg and caviar was pretty darn divine.  We followed those nice starters with the Petit \"Poulet Rouge\", Bloomsdale spinach &amp; Peewee potatoes, and the Angus Filet Mignon, twice-cooked potatoes, creamed greens &amp; black turnip mushrooms. The standup chicken ended up requiring a lot of work to consume, but it was moist and flavorful. The filet mignon was marvelous. A generous portion that was soft and juicy, with a wonderful flavor. The juice alone elicited several 'MMmmmms' from yours truly. Both chicken and steak lay in a bed of spinach and potatoes that was tasty and complimentary.  We washed down the entrees with glasses of the Fisticuffs Cabernet Sauvignon and the Segromigno Sangiovese. I hemmed and hawed between the Cab and the Tierra Secreta Malbec. Should have gotten the latter, as I felt the Cab was a bit sweet for the steak. The tannic Malbec would have made a better pairing.  We finished up with Lemon Cheesecake Parfait and one of those boozy floats. The French 125 featured Prosecco, lemon sorbet and maybe a splash of bourbon. The parfait tasted every bit as good as it looked. Marvy.  The waiter was fairly friendly and certainly knowledgeable. The wait staff overall was attentive without being ever-present.  The noise level here is lively, encouraging you lean in a bit to hear each other. It's not however so loud that you can't hear yourself think.  The bill plus tip had us shelling out just over two bills. Not surprising given the environs and quality of the food, but also not something that we could do very often. I'd give Park Tavern five stars if the bill was 15% less.  We did like the decor and the ambiance of the place, and the wall of windows were great to take in the beauty and charm of Washington Square Park.  I'm sure that we'll be back, provided that they don't lose that valet parking...",

Nearly every person in my party ordered the crispy polenta cakes, veal schnitzel, or shrimp and grits and the ranking from best to worst was grits, polenta, schnitzel. It was all about the sauces here, with well executed dishes but nothing too mind blowing. Someone actually sad, \"if I had all the ingredients I could definitely cook all this at home,\" and I agree.

Waiter was extremely attentive and accommodating. Busboys ensured that water was never less than hall empty. Hostesses were polite and waitresses cleared our plates immediately.  -Clientele was mostly upper middle class to upper class yuppies. Well dressed, and I presume well educated. An interestingly far cry from the usually SF restaurant.  -Food was spot on. Waiter's suggestion of the deviled egg single toast with pickled jalape\u00f1os, cheese, chicken, and bacon did not disappoint. Not gonna lie either, the fries on the side kind of made my day. I was less impressed with the Brussels sprouts chips, perhaps because it was overhyped on Yelp. In reality, $6 for a bowl of mini Brussels leaves seemed anticlimactic.   Cons: -Only major major major disappointment was the price to portion ratio. My friend and I were not ravenous or anything. In fact, we were mildly, or normally hungry. However, we were still noticeably hungry after $15 individual brunch plates and a shared side of Brussels chips. A tall and husky guy seated next to us ordered drinks, appetizers, two brunch entr\u00e9es, and ate part of someone's burger! Definitely not enough for a normal appetite; you will either over order at Park Tavern, or continue eating your way through the city. Personally, I suggest the later potentially cheaper option!",

The egg dishes are absolutely divine, and the french toast (which I prefer to split with a tablemate) is not to be missed.

Bottom line: don't come here expecting a quiet, romantic dining experience.   The menu is short and simple, as is the main kitchen with only about six chefs prepping, cooking, and dishing food. I had the pickled carrot appetizer and hanger steak entree. Both dishes were good, but not exceptional.

Eggs were smokey and the pickled jalapeno gave it the bit of acidity it needed to cut into the bacon on top. The bottom of the egg has been shaped flat and sits on the plate like a bateau of smokey yolky bacon cargo.   I was actually taken aback by the punch of flavor from the bisque. The cognac (or dry sherry?) was dominant but in a good way. I couldn't quite taste crab as much as lobster but it added another layer of flavor.   The Marlowe burger tasted even better than I remembered from Marlowe. And it's worth mentioning that another amazing burger is just around the corner at Don Pisto's!  This place was poppin' at 10 pm on a Thursday night. If you make good food, people will come. When was the last new place you tried where everything was surprisingly good, when you already had expectations? If it has been too long, come to Park Tavern.   Definitely going back.",

Plus for having lots of open reservations on OpenTable, beautiful ambiance and decor. The food was solid, a bit on the pricier side, and didn't exactly knock my socks off.  Whole wheat toast with avocado, lemon, chili, and salt ($7) - We ordered this to share. It was good, but tastes like what you'd imagine it would taste like. Toast with avocado and a hint of lemon and spice. You can make this at home. I'd save your $7.  Confit chicken &amp; potato hash, wild arugula &amp; poached egg ($16) - The waitress said this was the best thing on the menu, so I had to try it (my friend and I split this and the polenta cakes). I didn't think it was the best thing on the menu. It's basically rotisserie chicken with potatoes, very little arugula and egg. It was not bad, but I was underwhelmed.  Crispy polenta cakes, wild mushrooms, poached eggs, wild arugula, truffle salsa verde &amp; shaved parmesan ($15) - I thought this was the best - the polenta cakes were delicious, the truffle oil was abundant and all the flavors meshed together well. The yolk from the poached egg was delicious when mixed with the polenta cake.  All in all, it was a nice brunch with a great decor, and I was happy I didn't have to wait for an absurd time in line. It isn't the best brunch in the city, but the food is still great and a nice place to take guests. I was laughing at the people (or rather, tourists) waiting in line at Mama's - I was in and out of this place in one hour.",

The place itself reminded me of a few restaurants I had been in Chicago, very 50s-60s feel, trendy, young ambiance. We were seated right away and I started with a Cruel Summer cocktail, which was tasty. More so a summer drink then anything else, but still good.   Since I arrived late, as soon as I sat, \u00a0smoked deviled eggs were placed on the table. I don't eat them, but as far as deviled eggs go. they did look pretty tasty. We also ordered the PT fries, which were truffle fries and came with 2 dipping sauces, truffle &amp; soft cooked egg with caviar. It was an interesting combination of flavors. The fries were pretty tasty. The demons on horseback app was interesting, the shrimp was good, I just didn't love how they added a ton of meat and fat onto everything we ordered. I honestly felt gross after leaving this place, too many super fatty foods and so much meat!   Anyway, I ordered the scallops for dinner and was told they ran out. That really annoyed me because they have all of 8 entree items, 4 of them non-meat, and I don't eat meat, so I was left with 3 options. and the other options didn't really excite me. I ended up with the wild atlantic cod, which in my opinion, was lackluster at best. The cod itself was okay, nothing special, and it was paired with a ton of vegetables including mushrooms, onions, fennel, and some other greens. The sauce itself was kinda bland, and overall the dish did nothing for me, I barely ate it. As a side dish I got the brown butter brussel sprouts which were tasty. I also tried a bit of my friend's butternut squash made 'au gratin', like everything else on the menu...super heavy and fattening. Not really my style.   For dessert, we got the birthday cake, which came with a candle, that was a little little touch. The cake was okay, white cake with white icing. Nothing out of the ordinary there. We also ordered the ice cream sandwiches, which I really liked. The gingersnap cookies gave it a unique touch and the caramel ice cream was delicious.  Maybe since I came in with such high expectations, I left feeling disappointed. I thought the \u00a0menu was very limited, the food was okay at best, the service was decent and the ambiance was nice, but I've been to a lot better. The meat dishes looked pretty good. Maybe if you're a huge meat eater, you'll enjoy this place more than I did.",

(and his special guest) were already there ensuring our table wouldn't be given away (and enjoying drinks while they waited).  Since we were late, and we weren't sure what the parking situation was in the area, we decided to valet the car. \u00a0$11, in case you wanted to know.  We were seated and sat around for a while before our waiter came and got our orders for appetizers (and drinks for me and our NYF). \u00a0  Drinks: I got the McLaren (Hendrick's gin, cucumber juice, lemon, ginger beer), which I actually liked - even though I am most definitely not a ginger fan. \u00a0It was light, cucumber-y, and tasty.  Appetizers: We all split the brussel sprout chips because almost every review on Yelp has raved about them. \u00a0I'm not the biggest fan of brussel sprouts, but these were actually quite tasty. \u00a0We all also each got a Deviled Egg (one without bacon for our vegetarian special guest). I think the bacon definitely added to the flavor though. \u00a0The bacon and the extra little kick from the jalapeno. \u00a0Yum!  Entree: \u00a0Hue L. ordered the scallops (caramelized sea scallops, roasted cauliflower, braised baby fennel &amp; grapefruit). \u00a0Our NYF had the tuna (Hawaiian tombo tuna, crispy sunchokes, white anchovies, baby artichokes &amp; salsa rustica). \u00a0Our vegetarian special guest had the soup (caramelized onion &amp; wild mushroom soup, slow-cooked swiss chard &amp; poached egg) and polenta (Anson Mills polenta, Seville orange &amp; red cabbage relish). \u00a0I had the pork chops (Italian butter bean pistou, dinosaur kale, toasted garlic &amp; chili flakes). \u00a0The biggest plate went to the smallest person (that's me). \u00a0It was huge. \u00a0I didn't expect two pieces of pork. \u00a0I managed to *almost* finish my dish. \u00a0Yay me!  Desserts: Our NYF and I shared January's Birthday cake (Chad's Jamaican rum cake) and Hue L. and his special guest shared the tcho chocolate cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \u00a0The birthday cake actually comes with a long, skinny candle. \u00a0How festive! \u00a0And, hey, my birthday's coming up! \u00a0But, the cake was really good. \u00a0Moist, slight rum taste. \u00a0I'm not a big cake fan, but it was really, really good.  Total for four people w/ drinks ~$180 pre-tip.  Final Note: \u00a0The food was good, but not great for the price. \u00a0Also, it's WAY too loud in there. \u00a0The tiling is not conducive in muting the noise. \u00a0And yes, the smell of pot wafts in every now and then when people open/close the door. \u00a0Blech.",

I have also previously had a dinner experience here, which I can't complain about either, and of course the burger is to die for which I opted out of that evening and got the muscles, which were a bit on the over salted side for my taste, but still delicious nonetheless.

I don't know how they made it so light and so different from the typical thick, heavy iceberg wedge salad, but they did. The only issue I had was when we were waiting at the bar for our table, I asked the bartender if they had a Moscato d'Asti, and he said they didn't. But his bartending partner corrected him. They did have my favorite Moscato, but it had already been opened and was flat. I could have sent it back, but why? I'll be going back for more good food.",

Made reservations a month in advance, as it's gotten quite popular of late. \u00a0Upon entering, you get this feeling of stepping into a huge space (for SF at least) and very energetic (read loud). \u00a0Most of the time I felt like I was yelling to my friends. \u00a0There was a lot of \"what did you say?\". \u00a0In any case, we were seated promptly.  Food (apps) * brussel sprout chips - probably my favorite app there. \u00a0I could see myself sitting in front of the tv scarfing these down. \u00a0although, after eating a bunch, they def. started to get salty. * beef jerky - nothing special, other than the fact that you can order beef jerky at a restaurants * watermelon, feta, olives - this dish was ok, i'd pass next time * seasonal fig dishes - if you like figs, elegantly put together and very balance in flavor * demons on horseback - very well put together bacon wrapped shrimp. \u00a0I love bacon and i love shrimp, so how can you go wrong. \u00a0  Food (entrees) * Grilled pork chop - next to the roasted chicken \"Poulet rouge\", this was a very delicious pork chop. * Poulet rouge - striking presentation, a small whole chicken served in cast iron, upright. \u00a0look for the images \u00a0you'll see what i mean. \u00a0Very flavorful and moist, rounded out with spinach and mini potatoes.  Service - so so. \u00a0Perhaps it was a busier night than normal, perhaps it was a relatively new waitress. \u00a0We were left waiting around a lot, for water, for the check. \u00a0When I asked our waitress for a wine suggestion, she could not give her answers promptly. Granted there is a huge wine list, so I will not fully fault her.",

Probably one of the best restaurant burgers in the city. The decor is gorgeous and detail oriented. There is not one part of the restaurant that hasn't been perfected by the owners even the restroom decor is gorgeous. The service has also always been consistently great!  Dislike:  The pricing is a little on the steeper side and I do not believe it is in line with the quality of the food.

We felt slightly rushed by our server but not horribly so.  Aside from the noise and busy ambiance, the food was very excellent and fun. We had the raw steak and raw salmon for our appetizers - both very good. We had the chicken and the pork chop - both very great flavors. And then we had the cheesecake for dessert - which was just okay - tasted more like a panna cotta then a cheesecake but still very good.   Over the food was excellent - and maybe if we had a different table (we were seated right by the pathway to the kitchen) then the servers rushing around and busy feel of the restaurant would be less distracting.",

Came here for brunch in a large group. Thoughts about particular items: Avocado toast - this was incredibly incredibly tasty. But I have to kick myself in the face every time I start to think it was worth the $10 for ONE piece of toast, half an avocado, and seasoning. Smoked Salmon Benedict. Since when is one and not two poached eggs delivered with your benedict? Never unless you are at Park Tavern. On the plus side, the smoked salmon was plentiful and tasty. No way you'd fill up on this single $17 dish Marlowe Burger - can't speak for the taste but my friend who ordered it was not too ecstatic that the burger patty did not come close to covering the surface area of the bun.  Service was friendly enough but our coffee cups sat empty for a good 45 minutes until someone finally came by to refill at the very end of our meal.

Also, having an open kitchen onto the dining room is fun, but we left smelling strongly of fried food- clothes went straight into the laundry basket.  Reviewing as a vegetarian in a meat-centric restaurant so our menu choices were limited to begin with. We ordered the County Line salad with avocado crostini- greens (only greens) were lovely, as we expect from one of our favorite farms. The fava bean hummus was not great- I'm a fan of fava beans, but in this puree they were a bit too earthy tasting.   Our 'second course': the twice baked potatoes came out bubbling in a mini cast iron pan and were good and very cheesy (probably too much cheese for my dining companion but I enjoyed it). Also had the smoked \u00a0Brussels sprouts hearts and kabocha squash- really \u00a0looking forward to this one as I was hoping it would be the most hearty dish we ordered, but it was so overwhelmingly salty and fake-smoky tasting that I actually sent it back. Our very kind and efficient server offered to replace it, but we weren't all that hungry at this point and declined.  So not the best food, but an enjoyable atmosphere and great service. I would return to try some of the yummy sounding cocktails and maybe get a cheese plate or something. I imagine for carnivores the menu may be more tempting- I would love to see at least one vegetarian entree done well. Our server did recommend brunch for more vegetarian choices so I'd try them then as well.",

It IS crowded, and all that (like most other places in North Beach), but the food is phenomenal: I will drive down here from Mountain View for the fries alone... On a more serious note: what makes the food great here is not just the fresh ingredients but the meticulous detail that goes into every dish; The above mentioned fries have the standard fancy restaurant truffle oil and some greens, BUT they also come with three dipping sauces: something truffle oil based (yummy), egg yolk (yummy-yummy), black caviar (foaming at the mouth yummy), this great attention to detail and thoughtful preparation extends to all other items on the menu I have tried. If you are in the area and the wait time is less then 30 minutes you simply owe it to yourself to try this place out. Period... oh, and whatever you do, don't forget to order the fries ;)",

For entrees, the seafood special was good - scallops, bay scallops w/ crumb top, calamari, and octopus. \u00a0Again, not better than anywhere else, but good. \u00a0The whole roasted chicken was good, but pretty much equivalent to any other roasted chicken. \u00a0The spinach at the base was disgustingly greasy, just swimming in chicken grease which really is not as good as you'd think. \u00a0The halibut was a little sad. \u00a0A diminutive portion of fish arrived on a big, long white plate with some legumes scattered about. \u00a0It did not inspire excitement and tasted just okay. \u00a0The pork chop, on the other hand, was thick, juicy and tender. \u00a0The only dish, I felt, that lived up to what we expected of the restaurant.  We departed not hungry, but a little disappointed in the food. \u00a0Also, be warned - this place is a definite scene. \u00a0Not everyone is going to enjoy and/or feel comfortable in this type of scene. \u00a0Most people will figure out whether they want to stay or go as soon as they get there. \u00a0On the plus side, the servers are very attentive and warm.",

Brussel sprout chips: Flaky, crispy, salted goodness with just the right amount of charring. Lemon chips: Thin and crispy, with a bit of citrus and tang, and good with the burrata cheese, but just as good without.  Foie gras terrine: I have to taste this one more time before foie gras gets \u00a0banned! Here's the thing, my allergies were acting up pretty bad and my nose was clogged, but i could STILL taste the \u00a0goodness. I can only imagine what it would taste like if my taste buds were at full capacity. Smoked kumquats were also yummy as well. Twice baked potato: Dripping with yummy butter and creamy, with big bites of potato skin. Fish dish: Can't remember what fish, but tender and moist, with a very nice crispy skin. Could have used more salt. Would pass for the next time though. Marlowe burger: This was a bit of a disappointment and I can't understand the hype. True, the patty was juicy, but I didn't taste anything unique. \u00a0Also, I had one small clump of what looked like iceberg lettuce (maybe about an 1.25 inches in diameter placed exactly in the middle of my bun, along with the caramelized onions dead center and the aoili, so there was a pretty uneven distribution. Bites all around the edges only got me meat, bun, and bits of bacon (okay, the bacon was perfectly cooked, so I'll give you that. bacon chips!). \u00a0Anyhow, pearl's burgers are much better to me. \u00a0Oh, but the french fries were really good. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with just the right amount of salt.  Pork chop: Omg. Looks like a freaking steak. Moist and flavorful, even with a clogged nose. \u00a0Great char on the outside too. \u00a0My friend (who actually ordered the dish) thought the pork belly was wonderful. Imagine foodgasm face.

Park Tavern....food comes in at about a 6 out of 10, service closer to 9...here's my story and I'm sticking to it:  Brussel sprout chips are delicious, but there must be a pound of butter in each bowl...everything's better with butter, sure....  My dining partner and I both had steaks, which were pretty good...she got hers with fries, I had the entree version which came with some other things....fries were way better than those extra bits and bobs, so stick with the fries as a side. Not the most tender steaks in the world but tasty enough.  I had a carafe of rose that was quite nice, the partner had a couple of fancy shmancy cocktails which she seemed to enjoy....  Desserts were a miss, one a very very dry cake, the other a shortbread with strawberry rhubarb, the fruit was tasty, but again the shortbread was super dry...  A note on the private room, where I attended an event not long ago - it has comfortable furnishings and is pleasant enough, but is more of a loft type space so the noise from the very noisy resto below will creep up into your event....the service was great, which seems a constant, but another very annoying thing about this room is that the stairs leading up to it are used by staff coming and going to the next level up....I don't know what they're doing up there, but the seemingly constant foot traffic was very intrusive and noticeable.   Still, there's a lot to like about Park Tavern - the Washington Square location, complete with outdoor seating, the communal table and bar seating which I assume is for walk ins, the decor (nice and sort of private club-like), the crowd - very San Francisco, as it has become an institution for a certain set in a short time.

We were able to snag a couple seats at the bar and were helped by the bartender.  My bf ordered an espresso and the pan-fried corn beef hash. I ordered the warm open-faced deviled egg sandwich. After several refills of water (hydration was key), our orders arrived. The corn beef hash was pretty good, but I think I won with my open-faced sandwich. The bread did seemed a little TOO toasted, though and the edges were slightly burnt, making it difficult to cut into.  This place was busy the entire time we were there and a small wait started to form at the entryway. On our way towards the restaurant, I caught a glimpse of the avocado toast -- looked so good, I think I'll try replicating it myself unless I can get myself back here again!

I will also give the service staff five stars for their patience with us because we didn't order any entrees this evening yet he never rushed us through the meal and he made excellent recommendations throughout the meal.  I highly recommend coming here although it is best to make a reservation as the place is always packed. \u00a0 I will be back!!",

Waited an hour before our food arrived, they brought us one of their featured toast's as an apology (could have given us free drinks rather than pushing more product), but unfortunately when the food finally arrived it was less than average. Not sure what happened in the kitchen today but I could have made myself a better meal and it wouldn't have cost $60.   I will say they were apologetic, but I honestly do NOT get the hype of this place!   Next Sunday Brunch at my house! I guarantee it will be better, and I won't charge my guests $60 a piece!  so disappointed!",

I guess toasts are already becoming passe, but the toasts here (particularly the one with dungeness crab) are tasty little morsels. Both the sweet and savory brunch options excel: I particularly like the oatmeal-raisin pancakes and the warm, open-faced deviled egg sandwich.   Dinner options are well-executed and tasty. The NY steak and Colorado lamb are very good. I like the pork chop a ton, but think I prefer the one at Foreign Cinema. All in all, a great and predictable food experience that could use a dash more creativity.   A couple last notes: I love the space. It somehow manages to feel fashionable and timeless all at once, though the bar area can get loud and crowded. Service is always reliably polite and competent.",

Cold roasted cauliflower: interesting take, good flavor but I'd rather have them warm..  Bar Steak : cooked right, amazing french fries but the butter wine sauce didn't go that well with the steak NY Steak: I finished everything on the place, except the bone. Each was tasty on its own but better eaten together.. yumm..  Roasted sea bass: my party really like the fish but not the sides, too salty.

We left our cars with the valet which is $12 flat, cash only, great option! Way better than tired yourself trying to find parking!  It was packed but we found places to seat by the bar and we were so amazed by how great the service and food is!  JACK the Bartender is really the best and all the other bartenders are so nice and friendly too, they are there to make sure you have a good time!  I had the Maryettas Bubbles to start and it was good, not too sweet! We also had a bootle of a house champagne which was so good, can't go wrong with bubbles right?! To eat we just had appetizers that were to die for!!!! We shared:  - PT Fries - I had no idea how wonderful french fries dipped in a soft boiled egg with caviar could taste - You must trie this dish! - Brussels sprouts Chips - how can they make it taste so delicious and crispy?! Even who don't like brussels sprout would eat this! - Smoked deviled eggs - really yummy and the pepper inside the egg gives it the perfect kick! I didn't eat the bacon that comes on top of the egg but my friends said that it was so good!  And after those 3 dishes we got kind full so we jumped straight to desert, we tried the October's Birthday Cake, it was good but the appetizers wowed me more!!! Overall was such an awesome experience! I can't wait to go back there and have the Pt Fries again and try some more of their food!!!",

We stopped by for brunch the other day after making our reservations through Open Table and while doing so we'd requested window seating. \u00a0Lo and behold, upon arriving we were lead to a window table just like we had asked - surely an indicator of fantastic, detail oriented service.   The restaurant was decked out with Christmas decorations adding some festivity to the ambiance. We sat next to a very large, plush black and white houndstooth wreath. Very chic. The patrons, sophisticated, older.   When we lived next door to Marlowe on Townsend, my husband would grab a Marlowe burger for lunch quite frequently so he skipped the burger this time and opted for something new, the hash. I had the poached eggs and crispy polenta cakes which was exactly texture and flavors I was wanting; earthy, velvety with a crunch and the bitterness from the small bed of arugula and mushrooms. We also had the Breton butter cake which was reminiscent of a Kouign Amann minus the sweet, glazed top. The buttercake, I'd probably skip next time.   Service was quick and no-fussed, just how I like it.",

After putting my name down at a pizzeria for a 1.5 hours wait (with the car at a 2-hour parking) a woman standing by with her kids suggested we go to Park Tavern, which has more seating, so we took her advice!  Service was good. We sat down at the bar area, and someone cleaned the table right away, someone else got us our menu and water. The waitress, Aura, and all the other people were friendly, helpful, attentive, and fast. We had our waitress but I there were about 5 people filling the water, serving food, getting drinks, taking plates, etc.  Even though service was fast, we weren't rushed at all, and I like how they took care of us.  I ordered the Poulet Rouge, which is game hen standing on top of spinach and peewee potatoes. Sauce was good, meat was juicy, but the spinach was salty. If you eat the chicken with the spinach I guess the salt is balanced out. I was happy with my dish! $28  Dad ordered the scallop. We laughed at his plate, because he had 3 little scallops with some veggies decorating the plate. Fancy-Schmancy! My dad likes a hearty meal and more bang for your buck, but he defended his dish. The scallop did taste very good, and the salt was more balanced than mine. Dad approves. $29  Mum ordered the bar steak, which came with fries. Steak was good, but she did not like the red wine sauce. Too bitter for her taste. The fries were good, but she was upset the sauce was soaked into the fries. Might have been better for her if the sauce was on the side, or the fries on a different plate. $27  The coffee was good. Did not need sugar or cream. It went well with the July Birthday Cake, and it was fun blowing out the candle, even though none of our birthdays is in July. The lemon poppy cake wasn't really standout, but the apricot on top made it a treat! $8 and $9  Afterwards, it was funny to think how we got to Park Tavern. We originally came to Little Italy, to eat at Original Joe's, but we passed on it, because we thought it was too expensive and 20 minutes too long a wait, not knowing all the pizza places had even longer waits and all the other restaurants were just as expensive. So we ended at Park Tavern, which is more pricier than Original Joe's. The food and service though was worth it. And it's nice to treat your family to good food once in a while. Especially if Dad is picking up the tab!  Overall, Park Tavern was a good place to eat, and I would definitely suggest it as a place to take visiting family and friends.",

Out of morbid curiosity we tried them but the heaviness of the fries, the buttery black cod, the swimming pool of lobster bisque, even the kanpachi sashimi with shiso and garlic (how do you make sashimi heavy?!) put us all in a bit of a cholesterol funk.  The biggest downer? Not the resident, late night mouse - it's kinda cute - it was the chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I swear they microwaved it. The br\u00fbl\u00e9e top was super chewy. Pass.",

The place was packed and you really have to snatch any seat that opens up.  Anyway, thankfully the food was worth the wait. Marlowe burger ($14), you really can't beat that burger. It was simple but it's simply the best. We also had the brussels sprout chips ($7) and the deviled eggs ($2 ea). The brussels sprout chips were ok. The first few bites were great but then it got really salty. I would not order that again. The eggs however were really good. We also had the poulet rouge ($26), presentation was awesome. The meat was tender and juicy, however, it was kind of bland. The veggies at the bottom of the plate was flavorful but the chicken was not. For dessert, we had the panna cotta ($7). It was good but not spectacular.   Street parking sucks in that area. Luckily they have valet.",

    "review_text": "I'm going back for the chicken... \u00a0I mean the Petit Poulet Rouge...  Enough said right? If chicken is that good to deem a return, there's nothing more to say. But why? Now I would say it's the best damn chicken I've ever eaten, but I'm going to save you the hyperbole (that often exists when people talk about food) and note it's not actually chicken... it's game hen. Yeah same deal, but there is an advantage of using a young chicken that lends itself to being tender and juicy. That being said (and I'll go ahead use the word \"best\"), it is the best piece of roasted poultry I've had in the city. The fire roasted and perfectly seasoned skin would raise suspicion that the meat could be dry. Not so! As I attacked the wings and legs the meat was, excuse the KFC reference, finger lickin' good! Then as you slice into the breast meat and see the juice seep out you already know it's a winner. It was. Go get it. Stop reading all this hype. I should also mention that its standing at your attention when served to your table! You'll see. Go get it. Damn, I guess I did not save you the hyperbole...  As for everything else, it was above average if not very good. Park Tavern could be just another cookie cutter, urban socialite, new American cuisine with a signature bar program resto that has flooded the restaurant scene. So many of these types of places are just another face in the crowd. The element that hits is the food. And obviously that's the element that brings an establishment up to the high echelon of restaurants that will ensure its longevity. Soon enough it will be mentioned in the same breath as NOPA, Marlowe (its sister restaurant), Zuni Cafe, etc.  And one last piece, Park Tavern's poultry blows the following out of the water: Zuni Cafe's Roasted Chicken on Warm Bread Salad that has a one hour prep time from ordering and NOPA's Rotisserie Herbed Chicken.   Damn, I really suck at controlling my excitement for food. Yay hyperbole!!!",

I've shown up later a few times and have been forced to give up on getting in at all. Reservations are a must if you aren't okay with squeezing in at the bar or communal table.   We had a bottle of champagne to celebrate, good rec from the bartender on one of the more reasonably priced bottles (Laurent Perrier). We each had one deviled egg, wow. The little crunch of bacon on top was amazing. We then shared the lemon chips with burrata. Flavor. Explosion. The lemon was sliced extremely thin and then fried to a crisp, and served with a very light burrata. It went so well with the champagne, I could have eaten just those all night.   We then shared the gnocchi, which was loaded with wild mushrooms and just the right amount of truffle. Finally, just to be extra gluttenous, we shared the pork chop. This was so delicious, but after all the other food the meat combined with the parmesan risotto was a bit rich for me. I brought it home to feed my boyfriend and he more than appreciated it.   This place is a true gem amid the touristy Italian spots that dominate North Beach. I will definitely be back for more indulgence soon. I've got my eye on the cocktail list!",

The Poulet Rouge does not disappoint as it is indeed tender and so juicy with that iron cask holding the thing together. \u00a0That is one piece of impressive equipment to roast a game hen in. \u00a0The only gripe i have about the overall experience is that they love salted everything. \u00a0I left with a very dry taste in my mouth and it can only be attributed with salt. \u00a0Everything was drenched in salt, but not to the point of disgust, but a little over enough to notice \"my, this is kinda salty\"  Appetizers -Lemon chips with burrata - simple, and yet refreshingly indulging -Foie Gras Terrine with caramelized kumquats - excellent, but whenever is anything with foie gras not? -NY steak crudo - probably skipable as a simple beef carpaccio would have been better imo and the pieces didn't come out in nice large thin slices, rather they were kind of scattered around in small pockets of the plate. -Fried Oysters - comes in 4 and came with romaine lettuce and a sort of thousand island sauce. \u00a0Surprisingly good -Chicken Sweetbread - if you didn't know what it was, you probably still wouldn't have figured it out at the end, because this thing is rich and pretty damn amazing. \u00a0Deep fried yet retaining a moist rich center. -Deviled Eggs - needless to say, each person should get one of these  -Demons on Horseback - but not everyone should get this. \u00a0its ok, but that bacon drags on the saltiness. \u00a0The prawns are delicious but again, nothing to rave home about. -Brussel Sprout chips - still on top  Main -Poulet Rouge - excellent over a bed of kale and potatoes but indeed salty -Pork Chop - very tasty and moist -Mussels - probably better as an appetizer for many to share because this monstrosity is so damn rich I my appetite can't afford it  Sides -Creamed veggies - tasty creamed spinach -Polenta w/ seville orange and red cabbage relish - very good -Twice baked potato - kind of too much, but you should anticipate that -Brussel Sprout hearts - I see where the rest of the brussel sprouts have gone now. \u00a0hah, but nothing too great.

Came here on a Sunday morning about 30 minutes before our reservation time and grabbed a few seats at the bar to start off on some libations (orange juice mimosas, grapefruit juice mimosas, and a bloody mary made with beef stock.. super hearty) and avocado toasts while we waited. The toast was delicious, don't get me wrong, but not worth the $10 in my opinion. We also nibbled on some banana coconut fritters before our meals, but they were a little too fried-tasting for me and not really a light bite before the main event.  The brunch entrees, however, were divine. I ordered the cast-iron baked eggs (without the ham), two of us ordered the smoked salmon benedict, and another went for the Marlowe Burger. My eggs were cooked to perfection and were topped with just the right amount of gruy\u00e8re to give them a nice bite without being over-indulgent. My fellow brunchers all gobbled up their dishes with high praises, though I didn't happen to try any of them (other than a couple of those golden, crispy, delicious fries).  On top of good food, the service was really impressive. Our waiter and his shadower were charming, friendly, attentive, and perfect on their timing and offerings.

We already ate just came for a night cap before bed but none the less still and I still had a peak at the menu. The PT fries were calling to me so that will have to be saved for next time.

    "review_text": "The TL;DR Version: AssHat Bartender. Mediocre Fare. The End.  The Full Story (It's a long one):  Early arrival calls for a trip to the bar, where we sit and peruse the house specialties. I inquire with the bartender: \"Tell me about this Cr\u00e8me de Violette in the [cocktail_name]\" to which I receive a response in the tone of someone speaking to a toddler: \"It's a lavender liquor.\" Really? Wow. Thanks for that enlightening description.  We review the menu some more but opt for traditional drinks. My fianc\u00e9e opts for her favorite, which she likes to compare across the various venues of the city, and asks: \"Do you do a brandy Sidecar?\"...and the reply: \"Of course, this is San Francisco. Here you can get all sorts of complicated drinks.\"  What? Are you kidding me? You fucking *AssHat  Allow me instruct you on a few things:  1) I was inquiring about the flavor of the lavender and maybe how it impacts the overall cocktail...as a **mixologist you might want to look into it. It's on YOUR menu and you are serving it to people.  2) The Sidecar cocktail is served in a variety of forms...often with either Brandy or Cognac. Since yours is the ***second worst example I've had the displeasure to experience, you might want to take the time to visit other venues such as Zero Zero, AQ, Lark Creek Steakhouse, Top of the Mark, et. al. where there are bartenders with talent. You have none. Your lemon juice with a twist might pass on a child's roadside lemonade stand, but that's really about it.  3) For some reason you pegged us as tourists. I am personally offended to think that you go about mis-representing our fair city so rudely.   For the management: It was the big guy...the one who likes to wear watches about the size of his head.  Moments after receiving our fresh squeezed juiceboxes, we are informed our table is ready.   This bit is extra fun. So it appears that someone is very anxious to pack in as many people as humanly possible into this space. Because that is what top-dollar restaurant goers are looking for, right? And our table? Shoved into the corner where the frame for the restaurant's front sliding doors intrudes fully into the right side of where I'm sitting on the booth. For extra fun I have to sqeeze ever so carefully between the table next to us and ours, so as to not knock over anything on their table (I'm sure they *loved* my ass sliding by over their entr\u00e9es) and then yoga myself into position...it was...odd. I then re-realized that I was not indeed an amputee, and still have a right arm I typically use to lift my hand so I can eat. Not here. Apparently I'm only permitted to eat left-handed. In order to use my right hand I'd have to sit in the lap of the gentleman at the next table. Awesome.  I brought this to the attention of our server, and indicated that it really wasn't acceptable and that we'd like a different table. She went and spoke to the hostess...and a few minutes later we were moved to a table by the kitchen. Much better. Nice even.  After introductions to our new server, we made our selections and started receiving our food...which is pretty much the punchline: SAUCY.  Yep. Saucy. That is how I would describe the fare. Shrimp with remoulade? (Demons on Horseback) There is more remoulade than shrimp, and they are buried in it. Blech. Something akin to what one would expect at Outback Steakhouse. My fianc\u00e9e ordered the Herb Crusted Petrale Sole. It should be named \"LAKE OF VELOUTE\" with fish in it. I'd never seen a veloute fish soup before. She didn't eat it. As for my main dish? I've forgotten what I had. Enough said.  To the credit of the staff and manager, they did inquire about our experience...and I was earnest in my response. The manager offered to give us a gift certificate for a future visit...to which I declined. Yes, our experience was so poor I would not come back and eat here for free. My time and palate deserve better.  To really hammer the point home, we left here and grabbed a quick Uber to Hillstone for dessert and cocktails to try and wash away the crap experience.   As a final shocking side note: Upon hearing some of the highlights of our evening, do you know what Hillstone did? They comped us a round of drinks. You heard that right. HILLSTONE comped us to make up for PARK TAVERN ruining our evening.   Wow.  In S.F. we have a huge selection of amazing fare. The differentiators are the overall experience. Sorry Park Tavern, but you are far below par. I think you know where we'll be recommending friends and visitors go.  * I should note that everyone else was quite friendly, in a North Beach sortof way. (This will only make sense to locals)  ** I am using the term mixologist ironically here, in case you (the muscle-brained barback-posing-as-a-bartender) happen to be reading this. Clearly your communication skills are lacking and I want to be clear.  *** The worst sidecar I've had came with a salted rim by accident. Yes, your drink made it over this spectacular hurdle.",

Brussels Sprout Chips -- were good, very greasy Pork belly bites, horseradish aioli- tasty however, some of them were just battered deep fried chunks of fat with no meat Deviled Eggs, bacon, pickled jalepe\u00f1o &amp; chives-- one of the best things.. maybe we should have listened to the waitress and gotten more than just 2  Seared scallops, roasted cauliflower, braised baby fennel &amp; grapefruit --meh nothing special.. didn't finish them  my friend got the pork chops-- all he said about it was that he's had better somewhere else...  maybe the food was just too rich, or maybe we just ordered fatty foods, or maybe we didn't order the right dishes, but i didn't finish my food, and i left hungry",

It's located right by Washington Square Park in North Beach, so it's super convenient and popular.   I will say that the service here is great. Our party had a reservation, but we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the waiters to clean the table. In return, we got free brussels sprout chips. Our waiter was also super effusive and happy to explain everything on the menu and make recommendations. He actually recommended one dessert we didn't end up liking, so he comp-ed that. Um, amazing.   As for the food, I really liked the pork chop. However, the poulet noir was a little underwhelming. The chicken was dry, and for $28, I'd expect something a little bit more special. They also have an amazing dessert menu, so definitely check that out.",

Again, brunch is ubiquitous in SF so I'm hard pressed to find a favorite amongst it all, but here's my story:  Mama's had nearly a two hour line. Unless I poop golden eggs after eating there I decide to bail and head over to Park Tavern. I get a table for two within five minutes. Finish my meal of a great mimosa and poached eggs (try anything on the menu, it all seems great, even the famed burger for brunch).  I'm very pleased and leave only to see the same people still waiting outside of Mama's and clearly starving, cold, and from out of town with another 15 minute wait. Is the choice hard? Not at all. Check it out here. Make a reservation, it's easy. Done.",

Crispy Lemon chips- Perfect bite of sourness and crunch to be eaten with a side of buratta. 3. Venison carpaccio and crispy bone marrow- just a small bite is enough. 4. The Bar Steak- I only liked the edge of the steak. 5. Seared Scallop- the scallops were delicious but small and not worth the price. 6. Grilled Pork Chop- I'm not a fan of pork chops so this dish was ok. 7.Banana Bread Pudding- a hybrid of banana bread and a s'more. 8. July's Birthday Cake- I really liked just the cake I could pass on the compote as it made it mushy.",

    "review_text": "My first time here was great!  We had reserved a table for two at around 7:30pm on a Wednesday night, however it didn't seem like we needed one because there were a few tables still open.  The restaurant is fairly loud due to the popularity of the bar, and it happened that we caught the tail end of happy hour.  Decor and set up were great! \u00a0It has a very rustic feel, and the best seat in the house (in my opinion) is the two counter seats near the open kitchen where you can enjoy the chefs hard at work!  Now onto the food!  Since me and my girlfriend are lightweight foodies, we generally like to sample a variety of things on the menu.  We started off with the deviled eggs. \u00a0We ordered one each because we had a lot of food coming, but it was so good we ordered another round! \u00a0I could have easily eaten 20 of these. \u00a0It is definitely the best I've had in a while.  We also ordered the Uni, brussel sprout chips, demons on horseback, and the lobster bisque.  The uni was very fresh, and up there with some of the best Japanese restaurants. \u00a0The bussel sprout chips were alright, and it's something that I'd probably never order again. \u00a0However, the demons on horseback was delicious!!! \u00a0It's basically 4 huge pieces of prawns wrapped in bacon, and their oh so delicious sauce. \u00a0  The lobster bisque was a something we added in the middle of our appetizers because there was a party of 15 people behind us, and they each ordered it. \u00a0So we thought why not order one too to share? \u00a0And it turns out that party did us justice. \u00a0The bisque was savory, sweet, and rich. \u00a0A little too rich when you kept eating it. \u00a0If you order this, make sure to share because I think it definitely tampered with the rest of my meal. \u00a0Although it was delicious, the flavor kinda coated my palette and made everything thereafter too salty.  For our entrees we ordered the Cod, and the grilled pork chop.  The Cod was very average, and it didn't really possess any flavor to me. \u00a0Again, this could be due to the bisque. \u00a0My grilled pork chop was definitely too damn salty due to the bisque. \u00a0I only managed to eat a quarter of it because I started to get full, and the saltiness was a turn off. \u00a0However, I did bring it home and ate it the next day, in which it definitely held up very well. \u00a0It also tasted much better the next day, but I'm sure it tasted great the first time they made it!  So ultimately, the bisque is really good. \u00a0Just don't eat too much of it because it's heavy, or pair it with a burger. \u00a0Deviled eggs, and demons on horsebacks are both winners!  Definitely coming back!",

The only time slots they had open were for a 6 pm slot and then something around 9ish. Yep. They are THAT busy. I ended up calling in and we were able to get a seat at the chef's counter at 7:45 for 2. So, if you have a small party (1-4 people) and don't care TOO much about where you sit, try calling in and seeing if they have any space at the chef's counter.  When we went here, the restaurant was REALLY busy so service was only okay. Our server did come in and check in on us and apologize for not being super attentive. Water was consistently refilled though. We got: lobster &amp; crab bisque, deviled eggs, pork chop, and the petit chicken. The appetizers were AMAZING. As was the pork chop but the petit chicken was only okay. It was cooked well but was sort of bland. The spinach and potatoes at the bottom was also oily and meh. Cool concept though.

The valet parking is perfect since as most of you know this neighborhood is almost impossible to park in after 7 PM. The space is really nice and we scored a corner table where we were able to see the entire dining room and also the open kitchen. Our server seemed very green - he had a difficult time telling us what the specials were for the evening. He wasn't able to remember what they were exactly. Seemed a bit odd, but not a big deal. He took our drink order and then came back a few minutes later saying they would be right up and took our order. We of course ordered the much talked about deviled eggs which deserve all of the praise that they get! But strangely these came to our table first, then a few minutes later, our drinks arrived. After we polished off the eggs, then the bread arrived. Just a very strange order of things. For starters, I ordered a salad with white asparagus, hearts of palm and avocado - it was delicious and had a nice refreshing taste. Exactly what I was looking for. My friend had the warm chicories which was also very tasty. Then our mains arrived - this is sadly where our meal took a turn. I ordered the petite poulet rouge. The presentation was impressive but I noticed that the bird looked a bit burned and the vegetables also were overcooked as well. The dish was a bit bland and needless to say, I was disappointed. My friend ordered the \"Marlowe\" burger and it was also unimpressive. Not bad or anything but nothing really special either. We ordered the lemon cheesecake parfait to share for dessert. There was barely any lemon flavor to the dessert. I have to say that I probably won't \u00a0be rushing back here anytime soon. But if I do go, I might just stick to their starters!",

The line at Mama's was ridiculous and we had walked from PH and did not want to wait. We did eventually eat there, as well, check out the review if you want (not good).  Our breakfast was excellent. We shared the Pomelo &amp; Avocado w/cottage cheese &amp; cracked black pepper. After a couple of mimosa's, I ordered the Crispy Polenta Cakes (wild mushrooms, poached eggs, arugula, truffle salsa verde &amp; shaved parmesan) and J ordered the Pan-Fried Corned Beef Hash (crispy potato, poached egg, arugula &amp; red wine jus). Excellent brunch.  A few days later, J and I returned with N for dinner. We intended to go to Tony's , but forgot they he's closed on Tuesday. Since we had such a nice brunch at Park Tavern, and it was just a block away, we stepped into the bar. There were not any seats available at the communal bar table so we waited. It was a great opportunity to sample a cocktail and peek at the orders as the servers passed by. Wait was about 10 min.  Our order, which the three of us shared:  FRIED SUNCHOKES creamy harissa &amp; lemon zest BROWN BUTTER BRUSSELS SPROUTS parmesan &amp; chili flakes  STORYBOOK MOUNTAIN VINEYARDS \"Anteaus,\" Napa Valley, 2009  \"MARLOWE\" BURGER caramelized onion, cheddar, bacon, horseradish a\u00efoli &amp; fries  THE BAR STEAK \u00a012oz c.a.b. hanger french fries &amp; buttered red wine jus  All were tasty, but our favorites were the brussels sprouts and the bar steak. The Storybrook was a good value. Our sunchokes were overcooked and we did not eat them, nor did we complain, but our server noticed, and offered to take them off the bill.  Much appreciated!  Overall, great service and great food. Wanting to go back now!",

Before the service even started I immediately felt at home in the warm ambiance of this large, yet intimate dining area. I wish I remember our servers name but suffice to say she was impeccable. Extremely friendly and when we had some questions on wine she gladly sent over the sommelier who was great as well. We tried the deviled eggs, duck pate, twice baked potato, burrata and tomatoes, and the steak. All the food was prepared very well. I loved the twice baked potatoes! The combinations were very inventive and I was impressed when each order came out. Another thanks to our waitress who was very conscious to stagger when our orders came out providing a perfectly seamless dining experience. \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Never did I think that a dish lacked a certain \"somthin\". \u00a0Do yourself a favor and take your next date night to park tavern!",

I wish they had a side menu to add extra protein as hubby only had a slim slice of ham on top. Hubby's plate looked pretty but the flavors weren't strong enough for me.

With tip, we spent 90 bucks for two entrees, one appetizer, and one glass of wine, which I felt was steep.  The good first - service was friendly, and reasonably together for such a new place. It's beautiful in there - I loved being in Moose's, and they have lightened up the decor and made it even better. My friend ordered the mussels which were a very generous serving, and had a great flavor.  The bad - the watermelon/prosciutto appetizer that everyone is cooing about did not work for me - the flavors with the truffle and the lemon zest were too disjointed. I also was not crazy about the scallops (which, by the way, set us back 27 bucks).   I will definitely go back to enjoy the decor with drinks, but (big) if I ate it would be some of the \"safer\" options (the Marlowe signatures like the burger and the brussels).",

    "review_text": "Sometimes the kids table is the most fun place to be at a gathering.  We were a last-minute party of six and ended up at the \"short table\" in the bar. When you go, you'll know the one we were at. It turned out to be a great spot for people watching, drinking and dining. I would not have changed a thing.  Upon arriving, we were greeted with champagne and the restaurant's signature deviled eggs. These are not your Aunt Myrtle's deviled eggs. These flavorful deviled eggs benefit from the picked jalapeno and piece of thick smoky bacon on top. They were terrific and I could easily see us going back just to have a pint of Anchor Steam and those eggs. But, last night we forged on.  The next course was porcini mushroom soup. As you know, mushroom soups are usually cream flavored with mushroom. Not at Park Tavern, this was a dense, flavorful, all mushroom cup of soup served with a garlicky piece of sourdough with parmesan on top. Very earthy and perfect for a chilly evening.  Then came prawns wrapped in lardo, which is of course thin petals of fat. The fat actually cooks off so all you are left with is the smoky essence of the lardo on the very fresh, perfectly cooked prawns. This was a winner. The lemon chips with burrata were good, though not earth shattering. The signature brussel sprout chips were not available, because it's not like you can just go down the street and buy brussel sprouts at any market at this time of year. Oh, wait, you can.  For our entrees, we tried a little of everything. The steak is actually a New York served with braised Kobe beef on the side. I was wondering why a chef would braise Kobe and drain all the fat out of it since Kobe beef is all about the fat, but the plate was one of the first to be cleaned completely. The first member of the clean plate club was the pork chop, which is served on ribs that must be picked up to be fully appreciated.   Two of us had the seared scallops served on greens with these amazing beans served pieces of pork belly. I loved mine while the other diner found her's to be too salty. If you like salty pork belly, then this is probably a great dish for you. If you are looking for a light seafood dish, then this may be too hearty and salty for you.  For sides, we had twice baked potatoes, which are not for people shy about flavor and fat, and wild mushrooms. I personally thought the wild mushrooms were the winner. They were oven roasted with thyme and rosemary and had a simple, earthy flavor I really enjoyed. They went great with the beans and pork belly that came with the scallops.   For drinks, a couple of us enjoyed the Southern Lawyer, which is little more serious Knobb Creek take on sweet vermouth and bitters than your standard Manhattan. The fresh orange peel in the drink just makes it. You need two of these.  The service was professional, responsive, always there when you wanted them to be, yet laid back and unpretentious. We never felt rushed and our server was happy to guide us to his favorites without sounding condescending.   The atmosphere, as advertised on Yelp, is indeed trendy and casual at the same time.   The wine list is not for bargain hunters. Plan on spending $70+ for a mid-range bottle of wine.   So, if you are one of the cool ones, or, like myself, aspire to be surrounded by people cooler than yourself, I'd recommend Park Tavern for a romantic evening or a fun place to bring your group of friends.",

While the burger, my main motivator, wasn't the best in the city as friends had told me, it certainly was very good. Candidly, ordering it in such a nice setting concerned me by perhaps passing up on more adventurous items.  Pro move: Consider limiting your prior meals to build the hunger. You'll enjoy the additional time, and of course the food and drink, at Park Tavern.  Demons on Horseback? Yes, of course. Fried sunchokes? Most definitely. Smoked deviled eggs? No, but only because I've eaten them so often at Marlowe. Seared scallops? Oh, they were excellent. Grilled pork chop. Nom nom.   Yes, the burger was not my only entree. Sigh.",

    "review_text": "Greg and I had been wanting to try out Park Tavern for awhile, especially since the American restaurants have been a huge success in San Francisco (namely Wayfare Tavern, Bix, and Baker &amp; Banker) in our opinions. \u00a0I took Greg here for an early birthday celebration last Friday night, and I was surprised with how amazing and vibrant the crowd was there. \u00a0Usually when I think of North Beach, I think of late night pizza, King of Thai, and cheesy Italian restaurants. \u00a0Park Tavern, however, is a total gem right by Washington Square Park. \u00a0We showed up to our reservation just about 20 minutes early, so we were prepared to sit until our 9:15pm reservation was ready. \u00a0Just as we were getting comfortable at the bar, we got seated! \u00a0The whole restaurant is a little on the noisy side, and while normally sitting in the back corner is a bad thing, I actually think that this made the whole experience that much better. \u00a0We were shielded away from the noise, and got our own private nook right by the kitchen. \u00a0I had done some research on the place (thanks Yelpers!) leading up to this, so once we sat down, I knew almost exactly what I was ordering. \u00a0And the decision went as follows: -Twin Peaks and Panhandle cocktails. \u00a0Personally, I thought my drink (the Twin Peaks) was better than the Panhandle. \u00a0But the bourbon and lavender combination in the cocktail was unique and definitely tasty. \u00a0 -One deviled egg. Yes. Just one. \u00a0Isn't it awesome that you can order things that way? \u00a0Now, Prospect has exactly the same style of deviled egg, and while this one tiny appetizer was amazing, I have to say that the deviled egg battle goes to Prospect. \u00a0Still, it was an impressive take on something that is usually meant for Super Bowl finger food. -Brussel sprout chips. \u00a0It's true Yelpers, this is exactly as awesome as everyone proclaims them to be. \u00a0Greg typically doesn't like brussel sprouts (I'm just coming around to them), but the one word we both used to describe these are \"addicting\". \u00a0You couldn't just have one without wanting to dig back in and have more. \u00a0I would definitely say that this is one of those things where I attempted to clean the bowl without licking it. -Classic Angus steak tartare, quail egg, wild arugula &amp; grilled baguette. \u00a0In comparing to our previous experiences with steak tartare, this was definitely good appetizer, and I would definitely encourage people to get this, but this comes in second in comparison to Bix's version. \u00a0Like I said, the arugula and baguette that comes with the dish is a nice pairing together. -Both of us ordered the Marlowe burger and enjoyed every bite of it. \u00a0I was tempted to order the Poulet Rouge, except cutting through a chicken that size seemed a little intimidating. \u00a0We ate everything on our plate. \u00a0And I mean, everything. \u00a0For something under $20, I thought this was a complete steal. -Earlier on we had ordered the artisanal cheese sampler and asked for it to come out after our dinner. \u00a0By that point, I was reaching maximum capacity in terms of stomach space, so I only got to sample a small tasting of each one. \u00a0The soft cheese, which was probably goat cheese was my favorite. -Normally I stop here and discuss how great of a meal it was, but being that it was Greg's birthday, we couldn't have dinner without a small slice of this month's Birthday Cake. \u00a0Yep, they change the birthday cake each month! \u00a0This month's sampling was of Doolin's Gingerbread Cake with quince compote &amp; cream cheese frosting. \u00a0And really, when you see cream cheese frosting, all of a sudden your stomach has just created a little bit more space for you to try it. \u00a0  Our waitress was great, and always made sure we had our glasses full. \u00a0I really enjoyed our whole experience there, and thought that it was a great place to take someone for their birthday. \u00a0Overall, it doesn't quite overtake Bix or Wayfare Tavern, but this is definitely a solid four star meal. \u00a0A big restaurant, a great crowd, delicious food, a wonderful date, and good service. \u00a0You really can't ask for more than that on a Friday night!",

I got the Washington Square and this drink made my face pucker so hard that the creases on my face overlapped, I looked like a Chinese shar pei. I love me some sour patch kids but this drink was too sour for me. My next drink was the Mclaren. That was a nice change. I really enjoyed this drink, it was refreshing.   For appetizers, we ordered the local halibut and brussels sprouts chip. The halibut had a party in my mouth, there were so many different flavors but it all tasted really good together. For $12, you only get 4 pieces. This dish is overpriced but it's a must try item. The brussels sprouts chip was very addicting. Once you start eating it, you can't stop. One small complaint, the salt and oil were unevenly distributed, I had a few chips that were either really oily or extremely salty. I had the steamed mussels for dinner and it was incredible! I ate every single mussel, finished the grilled bread, and even ate more by dipping the house bread in the sauce.",

I've been there several times since she's opened and can't wait to go back again and again.  The food is incredible and the service is fabulous. Anna makes a personal effort to reach out to all her guests while you're dining, whether she knows you or not. The elegance and class of this restaurant drives in a wide variety of guests from the average foodie to the San Francisco elite.   Reservations are definitely helpful, but not a must - Because dining at the bar area is just as fun.  Make sure you at least go once a month because the \"Birthday Cake\" of the month (based on Anna's friends and family) is delicious!  Appetizers to try: Deviled eggs and \u00a0fried green tomatoes!  Delish!",

    "review_text": "A group of us had brunch at Park Tavern recently to check out the brunch menu that was unveiled in March. A fairly new restaurant in the North Beach neighborhood, Park Tavern is spacious and modern, while maintaining a rustic appeal seen in distressed wood ceiling columns. It is restaurant decor that I could easily see Bobby Flay or Tyler Florence embracing.  While having a beautiful interior, I have slightly mixed emotions about the food. I sampled a decent selection...some was good and some was easily skippable:  - banana and coconut fritters with raspberry compote: A huge fan of banana served in sweetened preparations, and of coconut in general, I had high hopes for this starter we ordered to share. However, apart from the banana flavor, I tasted nothing but oil from the deep frying process. Coconut was unfortunately absent. Yea it was cool that it was served on a piece of black slate. But for $9? Don't bother with this dish.  - brioche french toast with blackberries and vanilla-maple syrup: I'm not sure why this dsh doesn't have better reviews on Yelp, but it was actually decent french toast (yes, I've had much better, but I could've easily been pleased with this dish). The portion size was ridiculous with two monstruous pieces of brioche. Consider sharing with a friend, else this dish can, and will, overwhelm you with its sweetness.  - cast iron baked farm eggs with baby spinach, gruyere, and prosciutto: Nice menu description, but unless you're Popeye or an extreme spinach-lover, skip it. The spinach is lightly sauteed and very much in its raw form, so its flavor overwhelms the other components of the dish. While an egg dish to begin with, you forget egg is even involved.  - crispy polenta cake with wild mushrooms, poached egg, arugula, truffle salsa verde, and shaved parmesan: Hands down the best dish on the table. Also a large portion size with two large squares of polenta each topped with a poached egg, I actually could've eaten the entire dish had I not been sharing. The tuffle flavor complemented the egg, polenta, arugula, and mushrooms perfectly! I really enjoyed the various components of this dish.",

I would have given a 5 star rating however I had a bad experience with the valet and management wasn't very helpful. Valet service seemed very friendly. I even gave the guy an extra big tip. Unfortunately when I got home and remove items from my trunk I noticed a huge gash in my brand new car. I contacted the the restaurant the next day and spoke with Peter. He was very apologetic and said that he would contact the valet company. The Murat from the valet company told me that he would not pay for any damages unless it was reported before I left and told me \"This is why you have insurance\". Peter offered to send me gift certificates to make amens for my bad experience however he never came through with it.",

If you're dropping in just for a drink, good luck since the whole bar area was filled with diners and this is not the watering hole like Moose's or Washington Square Bar &amp; Grill was. \u00a0  As for the food, the deviled egg was simple and delicious ($2 each for a small egg) and the brussell sprout chips were good. Since we were pressed for time we ordered the Marlowe burger which was good, but I've had better gourmet burgers for less than $14.   Overall the food was good and the service was excellent, making for a nice dining experience. I will have to come back to try their pork chops, other appetizers, and sample some of their unique cocktails.   FYI...reservations are hard to come by on a short notice so plan ahead.",

For our first dinner, we shared the brussel sprout chips, the pork belly bites, the deviled eggs, the steak crudo, and the burger. \u00a0Even split, that was WAY too much food for 2 people! \u00a0Everything was very good. \u00a0Although, if you're going to order the pork belly bites, be sure you're a party of more than 2. \u00a0They are so rich and you can only have one or two. \u00a0The brussel sprout chips were thin and crispy, with just the right amount of salt. \u00a0The deviled eggs were to die for...the pickled jalapeno and crispy bacon marry very well with the egg. \u00a0The steak crudo was nice, but nothing to rave about. \u00a0And the burger was fantastic! \u00a0They ask if you want it medium rare, and they mean it. \u00a0It's very pink inside, so if you don't like it that way, be sure to have them cook it longer. \u00a0I am a fan of medium rare and it was just perfect for me. \u00a0You can't beat a burger with crispy bacon and melty cheese. \u00a0The fries were perfectly crispy and salted as well.  Last night we enjoyed the beef jerky, the deviled eggs (seriously so good!), the halibut crudo, the porcini salad, the clam chowder, and the burger again. \u00a0If you are a fan of beef jerky, you must order this. \u00a0It's got fantastic flavor and texture. \u00a0The halibut crudo was just lovely...small bites of raw halibut, jalapeno, avocado, sweet corn and chive. \u00a0Yum! \u00a0And the porcini salad was fabulous...the mushrooms were to die for. \u00a0We ordered the clam chowder based on the rave reviews it's gotten and it was delicious! \u00a0Be forewarned, it is very rich and I think it would be difficult for one person to finish by him/herself. \u00a0And just as it was last time, the burger was fantastic.  My one gripe is that I felt rushed...both times. \u00a0The bus boys came around 3-4 times asking if we were done, when I clearly wasn't. \u00a0I hate the feeling of being rushed at a restaurant.  Other than that, Park Tavern is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to go to!",

    "review_text": "Reservations were made weeks in advance for a friend's birthday dinner. Staff were a half hour late seating us and then to a round that would comfortably seat five set up for six (which was tight) until we reminded them we were seven. They reset the table for seven--it was ridiculous. I got nowhere with the host staff \"if you want to wait another hour we'll have something\". Are you kidding me? Finally the floor manager came and offered that we could start our night at the round and once the two fours behind us finished dessert, we could move. We agreed. She sent over a couple of appetizers, which was a much appreciated gesture, and had the rest of the evening gone well, that and switching tables would have been enough to save the evening. As it was, the service at the round was poor and /beyond/ slow, but at least we got to move before the main course came (over an hour after we ordered it). I will admit some of the food was delicious (Brussels sprout chips! Pumpkin soup!) but my salad was meh and awfully small for twelve bucks, my NY steak was tough as shoe leather, but at that point I had to just eat it and go because the birthday girl was late getting to her party because we spent three hours at the fricken restaurant! I couldn't wait to leave anyway. The place was /so/ loud and crammed.  I felt bad for our second server. I give her top marks. She was no-nonsense, efficient, and did her best to recover the evening for us. I wish I had gotten her name. Management if you read these? Hang on \u00a0for dear life to the 40ish bleach blond with the glasses and ponytail who worked the dinner shift on Friday the 25th.   Note: after we were moved they crammed /another/ party of seven into that small round. It was a bunch of very young women who were clearly cramped but either too timid or otherwise unable to manage to get their party moved. We watched them elbow each other and constantly shift in their chairs as staff tried to move around them and thought, \"well, at least we got to eat our dinner without getting hit in the teeth\".  Will not go back.",

I rarely ever say this, but everything is amazing. However, the dessert lacked. There were only 2 choices and they were both slices of cake. We chose the Yellow Birthday Cake and it was decent.

    "review_text": "So many things delicious things to try! Finally, a great reason to visit North Beach for dinner.  I attended the friends and family dinner and can't wait to become a regular. Similar to sister restaurant Marlowe, the newly opened Park Tavern understands the needs of the neighborhood and delivers.  The menu offers diversity depending on whether you want small bar bites, apps and salads or sides and entrees. It's a large and enticing menu (especially all the apps and starters), and I can't wait to try it all from a perch at the bar. My favorites from the meal- oysters caeser (fried oysters in lettuce wraps with caeser dressing- unique and so delicious), beef carpaccio with fried horseradish, and the pork belly.   One of my favorite things about the restaurant is how they make the beautiful grand surroundings feel intimate by the delicious food from the same award-winning chef at Marlowe. There's a beautiful sit-down dining room for the impress-your-date-or-out-of-towners meal, a gorgeous bar and communal table for locals that want to drop in for tasty food and a full bar, and cafe-type seating by the windows overlooking washington square park for a more informal bite with a glass of wine. To me, this type of ambiance is part of what makes San Francisco restaurants so special, and Park Tavern nails it. \u00a0 \u00a0   Plus, there's valet parking. Yay!

GREAT setting for brunch, pretty big restaurant, and such a great menu. You know it's a good restaurant when you want to come back just to try the rest of the menu (the rest of the brunch menu, the lunch menu, the dinner menu!)  Avocado Toast with chile, lemon &amp; sea salt - Simple concept executed so well. It's exactly what it says it is but it tastes way better than I imagined it.  Warm Baguette with 3 nut butters - The baguette is a little bit on the way harder side (but some people might like that) but the nut butters were really great flavors. We even had a bet going on at our table as to what was what. Good for sharing with the group.  Cast Iron Farm Eggs with spinach and prosciutto - What a solid meal. It's not too much and it's not too little, it's just right. Very savory but doesn't leave you feeling like you want to throw up  Veal Schnitzel with bacon fat-basted eggs, spinach and anchovies - How can you say no to anything that is \"bacon fat-basted\"?! It's definitely a heavier dish so it's a good share with the table but the savory dish is definitely worth getting.  Parking is terrible but if you're not driving, then that's irrelevant for you to know!   Definitely want to come back and try the rest of the menus.",

Soon after we were seated at our table our server came over and poured the champagne that we had brought with us. \u00a0I called beforehand to ask about the corkage fee and they said they would waive it if we purchased of their bottles. \u00a0Our server recommended a fantastic Spanish white (Albari\u00f1o Legado del Conde). \u00a0He also suggested a few apps that would go well with it including the Demons on Horseback and one of their raw apps. \u00a0Both were amazing. \u00a0We also ordered the Brussels sprout chips which were equally as good. \u00a0for mains we had the steamed mussels, pork cop, and the burger. \u00a0My mom said it was the best burger she's ever had and my pork chop was pretty amazing as well. \u00a0For dessert we had the apple crisp and the chocolate creme brulee. \u00a0Both were very good. \u00a0 Service throughout the meal was excellent which included a friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable server and bussers who came to fill water and clear plates at just the right times. After dinner we had friends meet us at the bar where we stayed the rest of the evening. \u00a0The bar area was crowded but not so much that we couldn't find a spot to lean up against. \u00a0 The bar area also has a long communal (I think) table for drinks and apps. \u00a0Not sure if they serve the full menu there, but it's a great spot to wait for your table with a drink if there's no room at the bar.",

    "review_text": "Tossup between four and five stars but they're new and oversalt the crap out of their food so I'll give them four.  Gorgoues location. \u00a0Inside is epic and outside is perfect if you have a dog or kid or noisy monster.  It's only been open a few weeks and I've had half the menu. \u00a0Let me tell you, it's all delicious. \u00a0Perhaps the best so far is the pork chop (sorry, Jewish ancestors). \u00a0It's a double thick, moist, smoky tender lump of deliciousness. \u00a0Seriously, one of the best pork chops in my life.  Other random stuff is inventive, inspired,and tasty, without breaking the basic idea that it's all comfort food. \u00a0The heirloom baby carrot salad, the most giiry thing on the menu, was pickled and salted and delicious. \u00a0On the other side of the coin, the caviar style fried oysters were like five po' boys without the roll, days later I'm still fantasizing over that.  The service? \u00a0It's what I call \"your hand been shook\" service. \u00a0Back when Bill Clinton was President people met him and they all said, when Bill Clinton shakes your hand, your hand has been shook. \u00a0That's what I think about Park Tavern. \u00a0When you eat there and you get service, youv'e been served. \u00a0These people are professional career waiters, with that perfect combination of skills, weird semi-snarky cockiness and teasing, loving concern over you and your food, and just plain interesting personalities that makes for an experience you come home and to to sleep with. \u00a0 I can't say enough good things, it's like an hour and a half experience with a personal food guy and you leave smiling all the way home.  The main reason for four stars instead of five is they need a little more work to polish it up, and way too much salt and butter. \u00a0Nevertheless this has the potential to join the pantheon of great SF restaurants. \u00a0I'll definitely return for the second half of the menu.",

I arrived on time for my reservation and was told to wait in the bar. Fifteen minutes later my party was seated. Our waitress greeted us and was a little off from the start. She gave two of the three people at the table water and walked away. She then returned to announce that bread and pork fat butter would arrive soon with great enthusiasm. The bread and butter shortly arrived and I was less than impressed with the fancy hawaiian bread and butter that tasted simply like butter. We ordered a bottle of wine and our food. The pork bites arrived first. What the hell is this restaurant doing serving fancy pork rinds?!? I was so confused when they were placed on the table. These are the pork bites I have been reading about?!?! On a better note the deviled eggs came next, the highlight of my meal. I wish we ordered more than one per person for the table, because these are keepers. For my entree I ordered the famous Marlowe burger. A burger I have enjoyed many times at Marlowe, a burger I only ate half of at Park Tavern. The burger was simply OK, nothing like the Marlowe burger and nothing to write home about. We also ordered the twice baked potato side to share for the table, my first bite was amazing, my second was just OK and the third just sucked.  I know Park Tavern just opened, so I will give you a second chance. Please don't let me down again.",

We also tried their famous Demons on Horseback which are lardo-wrapped smoked prawns with some remoulade and cucumbers. \u00a0It had a nice kick to it and the prawns were cooked perfectly that it was fresh and juicy. \u00a0YUM! \u00a0  After the cocktail, I wanted a glass of wine with my dinner. \u00a0I was happy to see they had grenache so I ordered that. \u00a0It's not very often that the wine glass list consists of various regional wines. \u00a0  For dinner, I had the Roasted Sea Bass which came with fennel and baby artichokes. \u00a0My husband had the C.A.B. NY Steak which came with braised Kobe beef and marrow-stuffed bone with potatoes and broccolini. \u00a0We both enjoyed our dishes that we left nothing behind. \u00a0After all the great food we had, we decided to try their dessert as well. \u00a0The only thing the stood out for me was the Tcho Chocolate Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \u00a0 All I have to say is, what a great ending to a lovely meal!",

By the time the pork chop and cheeseburger arrived, I wasn't as hungry and thought they were almost unnecessary for our meal.  The decor is bold and bright, giving the sense of old-time glamour and spaciousness. The draft beer selection is above average.

    "review_text": "After the symphony Saturday night, I took my boyfriend for a birthday dinner at Park Tavern. The staff seem intent on making the place feel more casual and friendly than its pricing, location, and clientele -- much appreciated. We were given a cushy corner booth, which was perfect.   As for the food: They were out of deviled eggs. (Our reservation was for 10:30p, so running out of something was not unreasonable.) We ended up with this: homemade jerky (as expected) brussels sprouts chips (they were simply the fried leaves of sprouts) warm chicory salad (salty!) tombo tuna (good! sorta salty) apple crisp (super salty -- how? why?) with black tea ice cream (superb!) McKinley cocktails (no. do not order.) glasses of a malbec and a torrontes (both great)  Overwhelmingly, this meal was salty. The salad was delicious at first, but not finish-able. Indeed, I kept retreating to the jerky as a palate cleanser (jerky is salty, too). The tuna was really nicely prepared and, had the preceding dish not been so salted, I probably would not have found the fish so. It was nicely seared, in good portion, and nicely seasoned (salt notwithstanding). We were both excited for the fruitiness of the crisp when it arrived, but the crumble was incredibly salty as well! (I generally like the trend of salting sweets, but this was excessive.)   I remarked that the whole meal had the feel of having been over-tasted by the same person during prep. I have made some horrendously salty soups when I've been the only taster, getting more and more used to the salt and feeling as if the dish could stand just a pinch more. (The black tea ice cream was lovely, though.) Yet, I have hope for reform!, since the food is potentially delicious. If they'd remove like half the salt.  The cocktail we had, from a \"program\" much lauded in reviews, was also disappointing in that the McKinleys we both had were veeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrry sweet.   On the upside, our waiter was great. We were the last in his section, but we didn't feel rushed, we never waited for something we wanted, and he was helpful.",

Did you also know that surprising your SO with dinner reservations here, will get you... : )  During a really crappy day at work on a random Tuesday, I get a text asking me if I can get off work early and take off to SF (from Sac) for dinner. Didn't have to ask me twice! Suddenly the clouds parted. I figured the Oldman wanted to stalk Tyler Florence again but, I hadn't heard of any new TF spots opening recently. So, I bit my tongue and held my breath while my inner child voice kept yelling at me to ask where we were going. As we walked into this restaurant, my first thought was \"Oldman IS stalking Tyler\". Park Tavern reminds me a lot of TF's Wayfare Tavern - it's rustic hunting lodge (complete with animal head wall mounted trophies) meets Posh Spice's dining room. Okay, I say that because we were dressed really casually and eventually seated next to the Real Housewives of sur-reality TV.  Oldman made a reservation (the only time he was able to get was for 9pm), but we had to wait a little bit for our table. So, we waited at the bar which was packed with most patrons choosing to enjoy their meal at the bar... a good option for those ill-prepared. And, a nice opportunity to strike up random conversations with strangers toting expensive goods \u00a0- got a great tip on a very nice looking iPad case (Mulholland Brothers... there, now I won't forget).  We were very pleased with the booth Oldman requested; it was in perfect view of the kitchen action. I LOVE watching beautiful food being prepared. Between the kitchen action, the wonderful menu, and the bright shiny objects adorning the Real Housewives, I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to order.  Oldman was set on the burger, after a friend's high recommendation. I wanted to try a little of everything!   Our wonderful meal that night:  Deviled egg with bacon, jalapeno, and chives - excellent (I sopped up whatever lovely sauce was sitting under the egg with their warm delicious bread). Brussels sprout chips - Oh my! Absolutely amazing (the housewives and I ended up discussing how we could possibly re-create that dish at home... we were thinking the chips had to have been flashed fried). Pork Chop served with baby turnips, carmelized apple, AND even more pork... pork belly. Who does that!? I think every restaurant should! \"Marlowe\" burger, sans the caramelized onions, with bacon, cheddar, and really nice horseradish aioli and fries.  Standout of the meal had to be the Brussels sprout chips and pork chop. Unfortunately, the friend that recommended this place was a little too slow to text me back with another rec to order their homemade beef jerky! We'll just have to make another visit to try more of their menu.  After we finished our meal we were stuffed and in a hurry to get back on the road but, we struck up a convo with the housewives - Oldman just had to know whose birthday they were celebrating, and I just had to know what dessert they were sharing... and, actually ended up fighting over. Turns out it was a \"Boozy Arnold Palmer Float\" (Black tea ice cream, whole lemon gelato, and St.Germain)... are you kidding me! Arnold Palmer is my absolute favorite beverage, and they have made a dessert out of it!? \u00a0If it weren't for the booziness factor, I would have knocked one of them over and ran off with it!  Two thumbs up for PT, and Oldman!",

I think this place began my kick for deviled eggs and egg sandwiches haha!) Had seared scallops as an entr\u00e9e, which was melt in my mouth happy. Dessert though was a bit meh, they had a \"birthday\" cake and it tasted a bit frozen. They also had a chocolate creme brulee-esque dish, and it was good, but very, very indulgent.  Service was impeccable and they have an extensive drinks list (cocktails and wine). Make a reservation if you want to come and eat here!",

Park Tavern is the perfect place for special events. \u00a0  We came here during the holidays so the handsome dining room felt extra festive. With fantastic service from our waiter and good timing of dishes from the kitchen, we were able to relax and savor every moment.  The brussel sprout chips and deviled eggs with bacon &amp; pickled jalapenos are house favorites for a reason: just right blend of texture and seasonings, these will disappear faster than you can say \"feed me!\" My grass fed ribeye was a generous serving, done medium rare as requested, with tender baby carrots and buttery mashed potatoes. Your dining experience would be remiss if you skipped on the signature PT fries, these potato sticks are so posh, you would need a pedigree in eating them. Truffle, soft boiled egg and caviar as your accompaniments, the best thing to do is to dip the crunchy fries into the soft boiled egg and eat away. Oh. My. GOD. (wait, was that really $14?!?)   I was at my favorite speakeasy before heading here so I wasn't impressed with the cocktails even though they were 17 cocktails deep on the menu. The Maclaren with Hendrick's gin, cucumber, lemon and ginger beer was refreshing, but also overpriced at $13.  Nevertheless, I left with a the warm and fuzzies here. It's a meal that won't soon be forgotten.",

This was most likely due to the fact that this is a newer restaurant, and there is a shortage of this type of fare in the North Beach Area. It was just full to the brim with people! We arrived exactly on time for our reservation, but our table wasn't ready for about 20 minutes. I was about to get upset when, out of nowhere, a glass of champagne appeared for my troubles. We're back on track!  Shortly after, we were taken to our seats and our server gave us a rundown of the menu and the specials. We couldn't hear her though - it's fairly loud in there - definitely buzzing.  We ordered:  Demons on horseback - believe the hype, yummy Scallops - very nice Steak and fries - very nice Twice baked potato - The top layer was great, but the bottom was burned. Fail.  Caramelized onion and mushroom soup - interesting flavor, but prob wouldn't order on a regular basis.  Oh, and I've had the Marlowe burger at Marlowe, and it's nothing short of fantastic!  It's a great atmosphere in there (especially with the beautiful Christmas tree they have up right now), and the food is pretty solid overall with interesting twists. Definitely worth trying :)",

Plus the fact that two of our friends had been to Park Tavern before and were raving about the burger.  Must try the frickin' burger!  The minute we sat down, the service was exceptional.

Since I couldn't eat it all in one sitting, i brought it home and even the leftovers were good.  My dinner companions had the scallops, the steak and the pork chop. \u00a0All three were tasty.  Last but not least we had the birthday cake dessert...in honor of my bday, and it was a nice carrot cake. \u00a0It was good, but in terms of carrot cake, I have definitely had better.

We reserved dinner to celebrate my boyfriend's 31st birthday - \u00a0party of 4 at 9pm which was the only availability they had two weeks in advance. I attempted to update the reservation to include one more person but the hostess said there was no flexibility. \u00a0I was very upset to see vacant tables that could have fit 5.  However, the most upsetting part of the night was the fact that our waiter provided poor service - slow and unaccommodating. When we asked for bread, he said they ran out but I then asked the busboy for bread - he seemed to have made it happen. Hmm.   Half the entrees on the menu were \"sold out\" - I ordered a steak but was told later that they ran out. They also ran out of scallops and pork chops....oh, and carrots! I was extremely upset to have resorted to having mussels for dinner. Mussels were mediocre.   To top it off, what was the point of sharing the birthday occasion via open table and confirming with our hostess if our waiter and the restaurant did not even wish my boyfriend a happy birthday?   Overall, this place is overrated. I will never recommend it to anyone.  Luckily, we went out for a second dinner somewhere else and then made it up to my boyfriend by going to NOPA SF the next day.",

I really want to love this place; we live in the neighborhood and walk by it all the time. \u00a0It's cozy (if a teeny bit dark), with lots of black tiling and dark wood. \u00a0There are cozy booths around the perimeter and a great bar to sit at.  Went there last night for 'date night' with hubby. \u00a0 As with another reviewer, I was unimpressed with the 2 Hawaiian rolls we were given (with dishes whisked away practically as soon as our hands had left them - no refills as with other places). \u00a0The butter has pork fat in it, and so we were given an additional one for me without the fat.  If you want to be complete vegetarian the menu is severely lacking - the veggie on the table next to me ended up with the tiny appetizer of heirloom baby carrots as her main course. \u00a0I opted for the steamed mussels &amp; fennel sausage, leeks, cr\u00e8me fraiche, white wine with two WAFER THIN slices of grilled bread - and picked out the sausage on to hubby's plate. \u00a0Tasty but disappointing as there were several mussels that were closed up, and therefore not fit to eat, but still served to me.  On the upside if you are a meatatarian the mini chicken \"Poulet Rouge, Bloomsdale spinach &amp; Peewee potatoes\" looked impressive and husband said it was delicious!  We shared a tasty fig and apple crisp for dessert - the apple peel was a little tough but it was yummy.  Wait service was friendly - very prompt, even if they were a bit rushed on a Thursday. \u00a0However it is LOUD in there, date night was a fairly shouted affair.",

First of all, it's HUGE, with a scrubbed tile floor and open kitchen, reminiscent of Old New York (at least in my memory of Old New York). \u00a0It has a lively, bustling atmosphere, with a noise level that might be too much for some, but I found energizing. \u00a0The crowd also feels very \"established\", as in moneyed, but in that casual San Francisco way.   Cocktails are delicious and range from the classic to the inventive. \u00a0I enjoyed the Country Lawyer, a bourbon cocktail with a dash of chocolate bitters as a subtle surprise.  We shared numerous appetizers, with my favorite being the Deviled Eggs, the Lemon Chips with Burrata, and the Uni. \u00a0I was disappointed with the Brussels Sprouts Chips, which were not as crisp as I would have liked. \u00a0Without even knowing that it's the same restaurant team behind Marlowe, I said \"They have these at Marlowe and they are much better\".  My dinner was good - seared black cod. Next time I would get the Poulet Rouge, which comes standing upright (like beer can chicken). \u00a0Unfortunately, my friend's halibut was not good and we sent it back, but luckily there was plenty for her to eat from our dishes. \u00a0They were very professional about it and offered another dish, and didn't charge us for it.  The desserts were just ok - we had the Chcolate Creme Brulee and another one I can't quite remember. \u00a0 Next time I am getting the Fernet with a Ginger Back!   The service was very polished and friendly, so I would feel comfortable taking anyone there, from a rowdy group of guys to my in-laws. \u00a0   All in all, a solid experience, and a place where everyone all around us seemed to be having a good time.",

Enough of that and on to the food: - Deviled Eggs - Great! \u00a0But one was enough - Crispy Lemon Chips - With burata on top! \u00a0Was good, but burata is always good. - Fried Sunchokes - Too close to the sun, because they tasted BURNT and chard  - Framage Blanc Constini - Like an hor dourves from a wedding... or company party - Brussels Sprouts Chips - Not that great.. too much chip, not enough Brussels  -Salad - This came with fried chicken skin which didn't work. \u00a0Salad with the blue cheese was great, but the innovative part fell through with how unavoidably salty the skin was  -Halibut - This was amazing and really brought up the stars. \u00a0Fish was cooked perfectly, the sauce was yummy, I loved it.  --Birthday Cake - Dare I say it? \u00a0boxed cake? \u00a0No... but I didn't think it was special at all.

My Level 5 Vegan friend had them create a special menu for her. \u00a0To my delight her dishes were off the menu and off the hook.   I ordered the Twin Peaks drink which tasted similar.. almost... to an Old Fashioned drink with bourbon, but it came out in a strange color and in an awkward martini glass. \u00a0We asked for a second round and asked the bartender to put the drink in an Old Fashioned glass.. it just felt better.

I'm overdue on submitting other reviews, though this one couldn't wait.   I'm sure you're wondering why 5 stars? Was the meal perfect, you ask? No...and stop looking for perfect, by the way. A wise person once said that perfect is the enemy of good, and last night's meal at Park Tavern was GOOD, heck, it was GREAT.   As much as I wanted to dine here, I've been relatively passive about coming to this place, and it has everything to do with making time to get out my 'hood and do the North Beach thing. My passivity came in the form of lazy attempts at getting seated after having a few cocktails at Tony Niks, only to wander down to Park Tavern and ask for a table...on a Friday night. I know, I know, a man can dream right? I was often too hungry for the 45 minute wait and often settled for a slice of Golden Boy Pizza instead. The half-assed attempts continued, off-and-on, for a good TWO YEARS - whenever I was in the neighborhood, and through it all, the Park Tavern hosts ALWAYS had a good and funny nature about the absurdity of some dude waltzing into their joint on a Friday or Saturday night expecting a table for 3 or 4 without reservations, with a wait under 60 minutes. (OK, I never expected a wait under and hour, but the answer is always \"no\" unless you ask.) In a town with restaurants and foodies who sometimes take themselves too seriously, hats off to the Park Tavern hosts for always being professional, happy, and funny.   Soooooo...I broke down and actually made a reservation. Me and my companion got a nice table, and man, I really loved the energy in this place! It was the right kind of \"loud\" where it was a good background buzz, yet we were able to carry on our conversation with straining our voices. Jeff, our waiter, was very attentive and knew the right times to check-in on us. Anyways, I highly recommend the Demons on Horseback (only a poet can describe this app) and Devil Eggs!! Patrick (one of the managers), hooked us up with the Twice Baked Potato, which is something else I encourage everyone to try. I confessed to Jeff and Patrick my 2 year journey and they used the Twice Baked Potato as their way of saying \"welcome...and please come back\". I shall come back, dear sirs! \u00a0My entree was the pork chop - cooked medium - served on a bed of \"brussel hash\" mixed with some sort of savory sausage. Very hard to disagree with all this pork goodness!! With a meal so good, I am going to sleep like a king tonight. Oh yeah, my lesson has been learned and I will actually PLAN to come back to Park Tavern and make reservations in advance. It was worth the 2 year wait. Thank you!!",

We then finished with the banana coconut fritters with a vanilla strawberry discs and a chocolate coffee rum sauce.   Make sure you sample their coffees.

Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and provided some good insight for a firs timer. We started with of course the deviled eggs....I thought they were good- not sure if they are top 100 good- but oh well something different. We also had the venison carpaccio since it was so different. I thought this dish was very tasty and we enjoyed it quite a bit. \u00a0Also had the brussel sprout chips which were difficult to stop eating. I had the Poulet Noir which was amazing! they let you know up-front this will take 30 minutes to cook but totally worth it. Love the stuffing and the sauce, everything about it is delicious. It is very filling though so I recommend splitting it or taking it home. We also had the cheesecake which was deconstructed and not sweet at all, so more like a cheese plate desert. Overall it was a great meal. It was a tad loud in the restaurant due to the crowds at the bar, so I wouldn't say its a romantic spot- but fun for a night out.",

I heard nothing but good things about this place too so I was totally shocked by the poor service. We sat for like 35 mins after our meal waiting for the check.

Or go to one of the many coffee shops and stores nearby!   Grapefruit Br\u00fbl\u00e9e ($7): totally unexpected! I thought it would be grapefruit creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but they were 4 slices of warm grapefruit with a crispy caramel glaze. Yummy!   Banana Coconut Fritters ($9): these were good, but really heavy and there were a lot. If you plan on getting a big entree, make sure you have more than just 1 person to share these with!  Oatmeal Walnut Raisin Pancakes ($12): these usually come in a set of 3, but we only wanted one pancake and they let us! Unfortunately we couldn't just order one French toast. This pancake was super soft, moist, and delicious.   Three Nut Butters ($9): this appetizer is also heavy. It comes with 4 big pieces of thick bread and pecan, walnut, almond butter, and honey. So yeah you can probably imagine how heavy that is. But all the butters were really good!  Crispy Polenta Cakes ($17): these weren't as good as I thought they would be. I am a huge polenta fan and this came with a lot of things I like - poached eggs, arugula, and mushrooms. It was a very light, clean dish, but just not as flavorful as I'd hoped and I was just expecting the savory creaminess of liquid polenta.  Smoked Salmon Benedict ($17): this is my favorite item so far! I am also on this crazy sushi craze phase, but the salmon is really great and the poached eggs, capers, horseradish sauce, etc make it taste fantastic. It's a light dish, and I hate wasabi but I don't taste the horseradish at all.   Warm Open-Faced Deviled Egg Sandwich ($14): this one is pretty heavy. The portions are big and has bacon, a chicken breast, eggs, cheese melted on top, and fries on the side. A bit much for me for brunch, but it's great if you're starving or are skipping appetizers! The fries are fantastic.  PT Bloody Mary ($11): I am a huge Bloody Mary fan and this one is fantastic! Great peppery kick (I love black pepper), topped with some beef jerky and some other pickled veggie I don't remember.",

The charge should have been for $35 dollars plus tip. I tipped an appropriate amount but they added a much larger tip, $19. I called to let them know, they took my details and were pleasant but never got back to me. After 3/4 days I decided I would just dispute the charge with Amex. Amex was quick to respond and refunded the money. I have still not heard back from the restaurant.

The food is truly that good. I was going into the evening hoping to spare my waistline a calorie overload, but once I looked at the menu, I knew I'd be throwing those goals out the window.   This restaurant has a charming, cozy and trendy vibe wrapped into one. Each table is within pretty close proximity of each other but it's so vibrant inside, you don't really pay attention to the table next to you. We began the feast with brussell sprout chips, burrata cheese with lemon basil chips and deviled eggs. I wasn't quite sure what to expect with the burssel sprout chips and my taste buds were pleased with the choice after just one bite. These are the leaves of the sprous basked in olive oil and baked to perfection. They are cirspy, salty and just plain delicious. The deviled eggs are just a perfect little taste and you can order them individually. I'm not typically a deviled egg fan but these were delicious.   For the entree, I was told they are known for their poulet rouge (rotisserie chicken) so I had to order it. Yes, this chicken actually came out completely whole on the rotisserie skewer and sitting on a bed of potatoes and spinach. It was the most phenomenal presentation I've seen in awhile and the table next to us even made a comment! This is not your ordinary chicken either. No, they do something to this chicken to make it moist with flavor that's spicy and sweet all together. It almost tasted like a gourmet buffalo wing sauce. The spinach complimented the chicken. I didn't really eat the potatoes but mostly because my tummy was already begging me to stop consuming food! However, you can't end the night with chicken, so we shared a piece of birthday cake. Yes, they have birthday cake on the menu and each month has a different flavor. This month (March), they are featuring strawberry birthday cake. It's a heavenly combination of fluffy cake, creamy frosting and fresh strawberry mixed inside. It was a perfectly sweet way to end the meal and I can't wait until I get to visit this foodie's paradise again.",

    "review_text": "A lovely Anniversary dinner choice...kudo's to the hubster. My hubby is always scanning the Sunday paper or reading articles online about the newest places to eat local and in NYC (for our treks to the big apple). So this year since we couldn't be in New York for our Anniversary he'd been wanting to go to the Park Tavern. So he surprised me with making the reservations 3 weeks in advance (Go dude!). It was pouring rain when we arrived for our Friday night 7:30 reservation, but no worries with $11 valet. We were seated in a small corner seat. Our waiter got our drink orders out to us right away, and we ordered some starters while trying to decide what to order. We heard the deep fried bussel sprouts and deviled eggs were really good, the deviled eggs come with a small slab of bacon and a slice of jalapeno. WoW! Spicy, fatty and rich. The \u00a0deep fried brussel sprouts were crisp and airy and melted in your mouth (a tad salty) but delicious.  We decided for an appetizer we'd share the truffle fries with caviar and a soft boiled egg? (I know, talk about cholesterol overkill...hey it was our anniversary). Never waited more than 10 or 15 minutes between each dish. We both decided to throw caution to the wind after all the other starters and go for the Fillet Mignon with twice baked potato. It came with a wine sauce and it was pretty much \"I've died and gone to heaven...\" delicious. Whoa.....but alas....silly me ate too many fries, and other things and couldn't finish my dinner. So I took my dinner home in a box. Which I got to enjoy for lunch at work the next day (and was equally as good). That Steak which we both ordered medium rare, was perfect. and the sauce was rich and the crunchy twice baked potato.....oh and they gave us strawberry cake and after dinner drinks for free since it was our anniversary. What a perfect evening! (one small thing on a rainy day, their tile floor is uber slippery) I hope we get to go back here sometime soon for dinner, I really enjoyed my evening and food...oh and my fabulous company! Score for the hubster!",

The drink selection alone was impressive - and wines were also varied.  The food was simply excellent. \u00a0I tend to shy away from the new age 'deviled egg' that has less egg and more deviled - but the waitress convinced me to give them a try - and I am ultra happy that she did. \u00a0They were delectable.  We shared the scallops (entree) as an appetizer, which they properly split for us - I had the twice baked potato and a salad for dinner, my friend had the marlowe burger - sub truffle fries.  With regard to price, I'm not sure what some people expect - it's SF and you're either a foodie or not. \u00a0If you want $5 toast don't come to a restaurant of this stature. \u00a0The end.  Everything was simply awesome. \u00a0I will be going back many times to come. \u00a0Happy to have a version of Marlowe even closer to my apartment, and a larger more upscale rendition of one of my favorite restaurants to boot.",

Coming from the San Francisco Symphony's show, I was starving; and when I'm starving, I'm not picky. \u00a0We started off with the trout dip appetizer that came with their own chips which was only so so. \u00a0I'd rather have some unhealthy onion dip with kettle chips. \u00a0We also got the deviled eggs which are supposedly a \"have to get\" \u00a0item. \u00a0It was pretty good, but I don't understand what all the hype is about. \u00a0It comes with a piece of bacon on top that is just WAY too salty and it overpowers the egg completely. \u00a0I didn't really mind that these were only average dishes because I was so hungry. \u00a0Then, I ordered their black cod. \u00a0When the fish came, it looked shriveled like an old grandma's toe. \u00a0It tasted even worse. \u00a0It wasn't fresh at all; it was almost as if they let it sit in the corner of the kitchen floor for days! \u00a0And plus, they charged us up the hoo-hah for it! We sent it back immediately and instead of receiving a new menu to decide what I wanted, the waiter just said, \"What do you want to order now?\" pressuring me to make a last minute decision. \u00a0My dad piped in and said I'll take a burger. \u00a0Luckily I didn't have to wait long for it-- keep in mind that I was famished. \u00a0It was a just an average burger: nothing special and somewhat under seasoned. \u00a0After we all finished our entrees, I figured that maybe they could redeem themselves with dessert. \u00a0Nope. \u00a0However, I've complained enough, and you can probably figure out what I'm going to say. \u00a0I'll spare you, Park Tavern, from my rage.

The waitress was very helpful in choosing a wine that would complement my ahi tuna. I love that. If you are a waitress or waiter in the city, you need to know this. It's the basics. When I received the ahi tuna, I could immediately see that it had been overcooked. Usually ahi is this nice pink and this was almost pink-brown. Not a good look for ahi tuna. Also, whatever they had grilled the veggies with tasted like burned rubber. It was just not good. I ate it solely because I was starved. I was disappointed to say the very least. Other than the atmosphere and the location of the place, I would pass on this place. I am inclined to try it again, just not the ahi.",

The restaurant is REALLY BIG, it looks small from the outside! We made a reservation and were seated right away (it is best to make a reservation for this place!). Our waiter was nice but I think he could have been a little bit more friendly, I had noticed more friendlier staff waiting other tables.   The food was very good. We ordered the Saikou salmon, baby beets, creme fraiche &amp; dill and the Brussels sprout chips the share, both amazing! Then I had the Grilled pork chop , sauteed baby turnips, carmelized apple, Nueske's bacon &amp; mustard jus and my man had the Hawaiian tombo tuna, crispy sunchokes, white anchovies, baby artichokes &amp; salsa rustica, he liked it, but liked my pork a little bit better ;) For dessert we had the \u00a0apple &amp; red wine-caramel crisp, is was SO GOOD!  I don't remember what cocktails we ordered but I do remember what I had was VERY GOOD!  For sure this is a place to bee seen but what I also liked about it there were all walks of life as well, it was not all posh people, their were families and older couples. After your done with dinner I highly suggest you take a walk (thats if your wearing okay walking shoes) to Coit Tower to walk off your dinner, on a clear night the view is so beautiful!",

It has the perfect level of sweets where it isn't overkill but just the right amount to be so dang good. The polenta cakes are really good as well but rather small in size. I would avoid the marlowe burger - it's good but definitely not the best item that Park Tavern offers.   For dinner: The truffle fries are godly. Though, it's hard to go wrong with anything with truffles and caviar. I really liked the half chicken. The presentation is great and the chicken is really tender. For appetizers, I didn't like the waygu beef jerky at all. I do recommend trying the brussel sprout chips. It's just like kale chips but tastier if you like brussel sprouts.  Overall, Park Tavern is a great spot. The decorations are great and it always seems like a popular place to be. I definitely recommend making reservations in advance to avoid waiting for a table.

    "review_text": "I think those stinky trust fund kids who continue to occupy the world are talking about places like Park Tavern and the folks that inhibit their four walls when crying foul about the 1%. I don't think I've ever found myself situated around so many well-to-do older men and their diamond-studded escorts in my 29 years on this planet before a recent stop into PT. Sitting at the bar alone (it's how I roll at times) and overhearing some of the conversations that only wealthy people could ever relate to made me feel so bad for less-fortunate members of our society, I actually seeked out the nearest panhandler and gave him a $5 bill upon exit. It made me feel roughly 99% better than I did before I left the bustling traditional American juggernaut across the street from Washington Square Park.  Aside from a pretty stuffy hang and an hour-long wait just for a single seat at the bar (it's not their fault they make delicious food that many, many people want to eat), Park Tavern is worth its weight in gold. Being a fan of Marlowe since they opened in SOMA, I knew right off the bat I'd be a fan of their latest project taking over the old Moose's space in North Beach.   If I were on a deserted island and you were to ask what five foods I'd want around me at all times, you'd find deviled eggs somewhere towards the very top of that list. And when I heard rave reviews from friends and colleagues alike about their version of the classic comfort food item, I just had to get in there and try them at any cost. Sure enough, while not as good as the deviled eggs at Wayfare Tavern in my opinion, they didn't disappoint. They were spiced up with jalape\u00f1o and bacon, and a sweet element that I couldn't quite put my finger on (but added a nice, unexpected twist). Upon future visits, I'd order these every single time.  In addition to the deviled eggs, I had to tackle a couple of their other standout bar bites: the brussels chips, and the demons on horseback. The latter features grilled shrimp wrapped in lardo and grilled in olive oil until the fat melts into the outer layer of the crustacean. It comes accompanied with slices of cucumber dotted with a black pepper buttermilk cream sauce that adds a nice visual touch to the smokey snack. It was fantastic (as I'd hope at a price point of $13 for four of them total). Regarding the brussels chips, there's not much I can say except you'd be a lunatic not to order these if you find yourself splurging on Stockton. The delicate leaves of the brussels sprouts are separated from the hearts, grilled, and doused in olive oil. For such a heavily-oiled appetizer, it's a light snack that packs an intensely flavorful punch. Perfect for sharing, or in my case, devouring every last piece until you're left with nothing but glistening fingertips, an empty wooden bowl, and a defeated soul.   It's worth mentioning that the cocktail program is as good as any in the city as well. They have a scaled down list of craft cocktails that concentrates on the classics, and they have a few Park Tavern originals as well. They also boast a nice-sized wine and beer list for folks looking to avoid the hard stuff.  It's about as far from my comfort zone as it gets, but Park Tavern rewards with a truly memorable epicurean experience. I've been an Anna Weinberg fan ever since I shared a symposium panel with her before SF Chefs in 2010, and while I'm not even close to the bullseye of their core demographic, Park Tavern will be on a short list of special occasion hangs for ol' Ruggeford H.

    "review_text": "This review is for the brunch only.   Park Tavern is such a classy brunch spot tucked right into the quaint North Beach Washington Square park neighborhood (not the strip clubs part of NB). With a direct view of the park from both the ample outdoor and indoor seating options, Park Tavern boasts a creative take on traditional brunch entrees, great service and a somewhat upscale ambiance.   Here's what I recommend:  1. Crispy polenta cakes with truffles: It's basically like an eggs benedict but with poached eggs (not as runny as normal benedicts) on top of fried polenta served with a bed of mushrooms. This is seriously a one of a kind dish that you've got to try!  2. Marlowe Burger: Deliciously juicy - in the same realm as the NOPA and Maverick burgers. 3. Orange mimosas: freshly squeezed and absolutely traditional in concept. It's almost a rarity nowadays to have just a classic quality mimosa. Everyone always tries to make theirs unique with weird funky twists but Park Tavern stays authentic.   Seriously though, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Go with what your taste buds desire but if you're trying to decide between two entrees, pick one of the above!  Happy Eating, Yelpers!",

For starters we had the deviled eggs and the lemon chips with burrata.   The deviled eggs are by far the best I have ever had. We ordered two and immediately ordered two more before we were finished swallowing the first two.  The lemon chips were on point. I was worried they might be slightly bitter, but the were bright crispy bites that paired well with the burrata. They are also served with some fresh fine herbs that take it to the next level.  Our second course was the Panissa with fresh peas/snap peas and mint. This was one of the best dishes I have ever had. It was bright fresh and cooked perfectly! I could have ordered several of these for dinner and been completely satiated.  For third course we had the Ribeye and the Wild Ling Cod. The Cod was out of this world. It was served with roasted sunchokes, sunchoke pur\u00e9e, &amp; baby fennel. The fish was executed perfectly and the set was as well.  The ribeye was cooked to perfect medium, and was seasoned well. The set was pretty standard fair for a steak dish (i.e. blue lake beans &amp; potato pur\u00e9e)  For dessert we had the strawberry shortcake on a biscuit. It was a pleasantly light finish to a large and indulgent meal.  To really take it to the top the service was completely seamless/flawless!  This is without a doubt my new favorite establishment.",

Now, I love salt. In fact I can sit and eat a bowl of rice sprinkled with just salt and be a happy camper. But the intense amount of sodium I experienced at Park Tavern last night was unbearable. We started with the duck liver mousse, which was very good, however we noticed it was quite salty. We moved on to the persimmon, buratta and coppa salad which was excellently balanced and quite refreshing. At this point the food seemed quite promising. Then came the lobster bisque and the steak tartare and both dishes were insanely over seasoned. By the time we were done eating I felt as though I'd been licking a salt block like a farm animal might. I'm not over exaggerating when I say that I could actually feel my blood pressure rising by the end of our meal! It was pretty unbearable. I was even fearful that dessert might be salty and we agreed that we wouldn't order any dessert described having \"sea salt\" or \"fleur de sel.\" We ended up just skipping dessert due to our fear and left the restaurant with disappointment. Had the food not made me want to immediately drown myself with a gallon of water, I would have recommended it, absolutely. But I can't see myself returning if the food remains a salt bomb.",

Secondly, we had people in our party who have major food intolerances, the hostess relayed this information to the kitchen - the waitress had this information on her docket when she brought our menus. This level of caring for one's customers is special. For this reason alone, I'd dine there again.  Overall, the service from the barman, to the waitress to the waterboy was excellent. I like my food on time, my waterglass filled without asking, and unobtrusive service. I don't need to be asked more than once if the food is to my liking. I don't need to know my waitress's name , and I hate fawning. All of my requirements were filled. Service was great!  The food was good too.

Thanks be to yelp for allowing me to pen a discursive narrative that subverts the stars.  MM and I ventured here this week after realizing that we'd both placemarked it. Made a quick reservation for 8:30pm but arrived an hour earlier hoping to sit at the bar or snag a table. Were the stars aligned for these aspirations? Yes and no.  We were seated at the communal table and told that we could either dine there or wait, but that we probably couldn't get an earlier seating. Hakuna matata. The place was packed and \u00a0it was a vibrant and kinetic scene. Laughter, cocktails en route, discourse, and all that makes a place worthy of your presence. Just after ordering we were told that we could be seated, as there was a last minute cancellation. Wunderbar. We had already ordered drinks but were told that they'd be able to catch our connecting flight to a real table. They failed to be rerouted, but we ordered them again with our waitress, and were soon delivered a gorgeous bourbon sidecar and a negroni for my classy companion that were perfect representations of the ideal.  MM wanted the Mendocino uni with chili served on butter lettuce because I'm from Mendo County. Actually because we both love uni, but the former reason sounds cooler. We soon ordered entrees, mimicking each other and choosing medium-rare Marlowe burgers. The uni came quickly, and was delicious, though didn't need to be served on lettuce as it detracted from the uni. The burgers took over an hour to arrive, because the order was misplaced! It was nice to have time to catch up, but wow, that was a long time. Once the misdeed was realized, several beautiful people dropped by to express their apologies, and the drinks and entrees were graciously compensated. The burgers were perfect as perfect. They've got this TCHO chocolate creme brulee with chili that purged any misgivings I might have been having about this restaurant, and when paired with a glass of Mary Etta's bubbles, I was a forgiving bubbles.  I might have been initially bruised by the frenzied service and misplaced orders, but the gallant gesture to waive most of the bill, and the bill of fare itself turned my scars to stars.",

    "review_text": "Since I'm a fan of Marlowe and I happened to be hungry and in North Beach the other night, I tried Park Tavern.  I was alone, so I only managed to eat 3 dishes, and 2 of them weren't very good. But the 3rd was so good that I'll reserve judgement until I explore more of their menu.  I started with the raw Alaskan halibut, a \"flavor-decorated sashimi\" type dish, 5 small pieces of the fish sprinkled with flavor add-ons. Rather uninvolving I thought, compare this to the Hamachi shots at Alexander's. Simple sashimi either needs to be the highest quality fish such that adornment is unnecessary, or throw so much flavor at it that it's an explosion. This is somewhere inbetween, and reminded me of the pathetic \"look at me I'm fancy food but really I have no taste because nobody actually put effort into this dish\" hors d'oeuvres they often serve at upscale catered parties.  I downed that with a glass of the Laurent-Perrier Brut, lovely and toasty.  I next had the Manila Clam Chowder, which imnsho completely missed the target. There's not much need or way to re-invent creamy clam chowder; there are hundreds of recipes and variations, and the whole thing is a known quantity. Stick with traditional preparations and just use high quality ingredients.  Park Tavern seems to be trying to re-invent clam chowder, so the soup is not as creamy as traditional, and the clams are whole, not chopped. The problem is that the clams are very salty and well, clammy, so chopping them distributes both the flavor and the salt throughout the chowder. What you get at Park Tavern is instead a relatively weak base with occasional whole clams that commandeer all your taste buds in a salty, under the boardwalk kind of way. I give them a B for effort, but the end result should be scrapped.  But then we get to the pork chop, which was not only the best pork chop I've had in 15+ years, but was cooked perfectly, exactly the way I asked for it. Too many restaurants overcook pork because of old school fears of trichinosis, and even a brined chop can be very tough. I specifically asked the waiter how tender the chop was, and told him how much I hate dry pork. Well, there was no need for concern because it was buttery smooth, perfectly pink, and so good I was gnawing at the bones afterwards. I'd go back just for that chop.  I didn't try the desserts, but the very limited selection seemed perfunctory, as if they don't have a dessert chef.  I'll have to try the Marlowe burger to see how it compares.  Edit September 2013: I've now eaten at Park Tavern probably 5 times since my first review, and they keep getting better. I've raised my rating one star in appreciation, it's my go-to restaurant in NB. I've had so many good meals there now, I guess they keep vetting the menu to remove things that are not so good and keeping the things that are. The last time I was there 3 of my party had Marlowe Burgers, but I didn't, they all thought it delicious, and one of them had been to Marlowe and tried it there.",

The atmosphere is always lively, but not too loud that you can't enjoy the group (or person) you're with. \u00a0Also the wait staff is immaculate and always caters to your every need.   The food though, that's the biggest wow. \u00a0Most everything I've ate has always been divine, and I think that this spot has the most high quality food in North Beach. \u00a0  Details.... Deviled Egg = MUST. \u00a0Really unique flavors, and the little crunch of bacon on top is perfection. Brussel Sprout Chips - delightfully crunchy (brussel sprouts are so \"in\" these days - ha) Lemon Chips Burrata - I love the flavor of burrata, so I didn't necessarily enjoy the burrata ON the lemon chips, but thought it was nice to eat on the side.  PT Waldorf Salad - really fresh, tangy with a hint of sweetness (although my date said it was a little sweet) Carmelized Onion Mushroom Soup - this was perhaps my least favorite... just wasn't on the top of my list. Marlowe Burger (ordered medium) \u00a0- JUICY and delightful medley of flavors. \u00a0The horseradish aioli is such a great addition. I almost had to ask for a 2nd serving of aioli so I could dunk everything in it. It's not particularly large, but still one of my fav burgers.   Overall I LOVE park tavern. \u00a0From ambience, service and most importantly the food, this is the type of place I can count on.",

    "review_text": "It was an annual holiday dinner with two of my great girlfriends and this year chose Park Tavern to be part of our holiday experience. Dinner was at 6 and though we arrived to an empty place, by the time our waitress came to take our order the floor was filled with diners.   After many recommendations from our waiter, we decided to share a few starters, a side and to each get a different entree so that we made get a taste of everything.  Starters: -Demons on horseback -Deviled eggs, bacon, pickled jalepe\u00f1o &amp; chives  -Brussels sprout chips  Our favorite starters for the night was the Demons on horseback- the melted bacon fat gave the prawns a pop of flavor. My second favorite was the famous brussels sprouts, and I don't usually eat brussels sprout. There is a rave about their deviled eggs but to us it was just mediocre.   Sides: -Anson Mills polenta  Finished before I had a chance to dig into my Petit \"Poulet Rouge\". Yup, it was that good!  Entrees: -Grilled pork chop -Seared local albacore -Petit \"Poulet Rouge\"  Out of the entrees, I would have to say that my favorite was the petite poulet rouge. First the dish came out cold, when we notified our waiter he quickly took it back to the kitchen and the manager later came out with a new and hot dish. It was wonderful! Moist, juicy and full of flavor of spices. \u00a0The seared albacore and the pork chop was good too but nothing compared to the hen.   Desserts: -Lemon cheesecake parfait  -Apple &amp; red wine-caramel crisp   Lemon cheesecake parfait was creamy and rich. Can't really taste the \"cheesecake\" in this dessert but it was still good. The apple &amp; red wine caramel crisp was a tad bitter, and it is probably because of the red wine. However, the bitterness balanced perfectly with the sweet and tart lemon ice cream that it was served with.   Overall, the dining experience was really delightful. I admire and respect restaurants who will own up to their mistakes and are willing to take that extra step to make their service more than exceptional. Their generosity in making up for their errors made my dining experience with them much memorable.",

Why not 5 stars? \u00a0It was just a bit expensive for me. \u00a0Each drink, glass of wine, main course/appetizer, was, like a dollar to 3 dollars too expensive (except for the poulet rouge - that was a good price). \u00a0And that really all adds up. \u00a0I mean, 8 dollars for a french press of coffee that puts out one large mug of coffee? \u00a0Hmm. \u00a06 bucks for a tiny plate of olives? \u00a0Hmm again.

Mains: \u00a0The burger is really good, and stands up to its well deserved reputation in local food blogs/rankings. \u00a0Again, it was very well balanced with discreet complementing flavors and textures. \u00a0A nicely toasted bun that held up well and didn't get soggy; crisp, with a fair bit of melted butter. \u00a0The right amount of cheese and grilled onions, so they don't all fall out on your first bite. \u00a0The actual patty, wasn't super awesome on it's own, but combined with everything else, worked really well together. \u00a0 \u00a0 The chicken was really succulent and tender. \u00a0The seasoning isn't too heavy, allowing you to really taste the chicken. \u00a0  Decor: \u00a0Upscale modern casual, but not overly so. \u00a0It wouldn't feel overly out of place taking your parents/family here. \u00a0Some tourists, but that's expected for the area. \u00a0Acoustics get a bit loud when it fills up.

As we go to SF at least once a year, this time, we decided to dine there again as it's next door to our Bed and Breakfast, and we remembered the food was good. Unfortunately, we were disappointed this time - both the service AND the food.  For drinks, we opted to have cocktails in lieu of wine - hubby had Treasure Island (Barrel-aged gin, fennel syrup, Dolin Genepy des Alps &amp; lemon); and I had Duboce (Bank Note scotch, yellow chartreuse, Benedictine &amp; bitters) -- they were good and very strong - straight to your head strong.  We started our meals with Crispy Soft Shell Crab, it was good, it had very good crispy coating that's not oily at all - we were happy. \u00a0We also had Brussels Sprout Chip - pretty good but they were very oily. For dinner, I had The Bar Steak while hubby had Grass Fed Ribeye; ordered medium rare for both. \u00a0For mine, with description of grass fed bisto filet - I expected the filet to have nice flavor. \u00a0To my surprise, it came sliced and I already knew I would only going to have my first bite as the juicy bite as I saw the juice from the meat was on the bottom of my meat. \u00a0I'm sorry, but. . . I had better meat from regular market. \u00a0It was not taste good at all, overcooked (more like medium toward well done), and super dry due to the slicing - which they possibly not let the meat rest first as well.  Hubby's ribeye had better taste and cooked perfectly as medium rare; his was also served sliced, but his was not dry like mine - possibly because lots of fat on the meat.  To cap off the night, hubby had May's \"Birthday\" Cake while I had the TCHO Chocolate Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \u00a0The \"Birthday\" Cake was plain yellow chiffon cake with plain cream cheese frosting - couldn't taste any of the brandied apricot coulis &amp; peach cream cheese frosting as they detailed on their menu. \u00a0As for my Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, it was not as good as I remembered I had it couple years ago; plus the chocolate biscotti that came with it were soggy and old tasting.  As for the service, our waiter was pretty ignorant - she only came by to take our order after I gave her the look as we were sitting for 20 minutes or so waiting while she was too busy \"entertaining\" 2 other tables next to us that were bigger parties (6-people table). \u00a0The bus-boy was much more attentive as he asked if we wanted some bread and never failed to fill up our water glasses.  We definitely will skip this place on our future annual visit to SF. \u00a0There are so many other restaurants that offer much much better food and services - sorry Park Tavern, you definitely failed us.",

The carrot cake was not as good as the one Neiman Marcus used to have. \u00a0That one had shavings of carrots, walnuts and raisins in the moist cake and the frosting had wonderful cream cheese. \u00a0This was not even close. \u00a0 The manager knew we were unhappy and took it upon himself to take care of the food charge and we paid for the drinks. \u00a0Between the very loud noise level, the feeling that we were being rushed with the entree and then delayed by the long wait for the dessert I can assure you we will not return. \u00a0 There are far too many restaurants in San Francisco where you do not \u00a0have to put up with a loud noise level, inconsistent service and so so food. Too bad since Park Tavern is convenient for those that live in the neighborhood.",

So glad there is finally a little variety in eateries lining Washington Square Park!  I love the ambiance; dim lighting, view of the park, seating arrangements with a long family style tall table by the bar. The staff were all attentive, friendly and offered great suggestions. I remember hearing complaints about the service when Joey and Eddie's occupied the space so it was great to find that was not the case.  Sat at the long table with two dinner guests; we were right in the thick of conversations, cocktails, and delicious food...it was perfect for a Saturday evening girls dinner.  Starters: 1.Deviled eggs  - Delicious! Served as singles so we ordered 1/each. Love the bacon on top and will go back for more :) 2. Burrata  - Pretty good...I am a big burrata fan and may just be being snotty but It was tasty and I would recommend it; just not the best I have had. 3. Prawns  - Very tasty...the sauce was a little spicy (how I like it!) and made for a good sauce to sop up with the table bread.  Entrees: 1. Pork Chop - Really liked the dish as a whole, well prepared and enjoyed it. We all 3 shared each of the starters and entree's.  2. Arugula Salad - The server mentioned this salad was popular and I can see why. It was flavorful and since none of the other dishes we got had much green it was refreshing to include a salad. 3. Mussels - Yum! I love mussels and thought these were really good. Loved using the broth to dip table bread in and the sausage was a nice touch.  Great first experience and can't wait to come back for more!",

Fried Brussell sprout chips were as good as ever, the deviled eggs fantastic, and the pork chop as tender as JLO's ass. Wife had the mussels and whatever they put into that broth at the bottom of the bowl is so addicting, I want to swim in a pool of it.

Overall, some dishes were very good, some were less impressive.   In particular, the roast chicken is good, but not unique or interesting in terms of flavor. I was more interested in buying a Staub pan ($160 at William-Sonoma) afterward than coming back to eat that particular roast chicken again.   Everyone (including my parents) seem to rave about the deviled eggs -- I was disappointed. Maybe I prefer different things in my deviled eggs, but while the toppings were unique and flavorful, I found the egg yolk too yolk-y and not creamy enough.  All complaints aside, nothing was BAD. And the PT Fries were amazing (but it's hard to go wrong with fries and egg yolks...) as was the braised lamb tongue. Would come back, but will skip the deviled eggs and the chicken.",

Drinks are also great - my only complaint is that the menu pricing seems to be off. Two separate occasions I've ordered a bottle of wine to be told later the price on the menu is incorrect.

This place looks super cool, so I was excited.   The staff here was great. Everyone was super friendly and smiley. The hostess and I shared a laugh while I bounced around in my seat. CP had a glass of wine. The people watching here is great. We were seated adjacent to the bar area and there was some interesting happenings.  We had to, without a doubt, start with the deviled eggs. CP thought we should also give the fried mushrooms with french onion dip a go. The special for the evening was a sol fish with little potatoes and egg and veggies.   Even with the jalapeno, the deviled eggs weren't overwhelmingly hot. They had great flavor. I loved the touch of bacon. These are definitely a winner. Deviled eggs at restaurants can be a real joke but these lived up to the challenge and the fame. I almost bought more! Definitely delicious. As good as the eggs were, the mushrooms were very average. They were fried and they tasted fine but it was a very monotonous appetizer. Not much punch. Could have used a kick in their shroomy bottoms. Maybe some paprika? I was bored after a few bites.  Special sol was interesting. It probably wouldn't have been my go to for the meal but CP enjoyed it a lot. It was good and had many dynamic flavors, many of which I couldn't pinpoint. The egg was a brilliant touch.   Though the appetizers were both hit and miss and the entree was probably not my first choice I still enjoyed my time here. I loved the energy and the vibe, plus, there are many more exciting things I can try on the menu. SF dining success!",

The perfect end to our 2011 working life. \u00a0Cheers!",

    "review_text": "Wanted to go some place special for my boo's birthday and we decided on Park Tavern.  Although the attire said \"casual\", one should've taken the restaurants location into consideration. To me, casual means jeans and a t-shirt. Casual for the edge of North Beach/Marina though, means all clothes should be bought at Ambience or similar and to wear 4in stiletto heels. So mind that, cover up your tattoos and you might save yourself some looks from snooty rich kids spending daddy's money.  Now, once you've gotten past the clientele, literally everything is amazing though.   Food; We started with the lemon crisps, served with burrata - it was so delicious. Never encountered deep fried, super thin slices of lemon, but it was delightfully tangy, well completed by the sweet and creamy cheese.  My fianc\u00e9 had the bar steak for his entr\u00e9e - it was cooked perfectly and the red wine buttered sauce--to die for. (It's wine and butter. Of course it's good.)   I had the roasted red snapper, and it was DIVINE. Served with creamy beans and the most flavourful bacon bits I've ever had. The nest of yam on top of the fish provided a nice texture.  Opted for the gingersnap ice cream sandwich for dessert and again - very good. Not overly spiced, and the ice cream super rich. Comes with chocolate ganache that's extremely decadent.   Service:  Immaculate. Nice, friendly and accommodating staff. Water-level consistently full.  Overall, highly recommend Park Tavern. It might not be your go-to-every-evening-place (as it's around $80-100/person) but it's definitely worth several visits.   PS. Once you're done with dinner, get away from this area asap. Like mentioned, money is all around and money loves to drink. A lot. Like, a looot. (I.e. I saw a man with his pants down, peeing on a car.) Seriously, get out of there.",

    "review_text": "Being from out of town, I rely on Yelp, Open Table, and other review sites when choosing restaurants. So, upon reading an article on San Francisco's best new restaurants, I decided to give Park Tavern a try and was glad I did.  First off, I didn't make my 8:30pm reservation until 6:00pm that same evening and had no trouble at all, whereas all of the other SF go-to hot spots were completely booked days in advance (my own fault, I know). I'm assuming this is because Park Tavern is huge, and also it's still pretty new.  Upon arriving, the hostess was extremely friendly and helpful. Our table wasn't quite ready yet, but she made sure we were seated within a few minutes and even offered to take our drink orders while we waited. The place was insanely packed and loud, and I could definitely tell she was a pro at her job.  We started off with the deviled eggs which were INCREDIBLE. The lobster bisque was also amazing. Some of the other dishes we tried, however, weren't as great, like the arugula salad which was drowned in truffle oil and the filet mignon which was insanely salty (and I like my food over-seasoned, so you can probably imagine how much I felt like I was eating a block of salt). Overall the food was great, though, including dessert. I had the birthday cake which comes complete with a lit candle. Drinks were also amazing. In fact, their margarita is the best I've ever had-- seriously. And, the coffee comes in an adorable mini French press and is served with a cute bowl of sugar cubes.  Service and ambiance were great. I loved the Washington Square/North Beach location, the decor (love the wallpaper and tiles), and the bar area. Overall this is a great place and I hope to see it on even more \"best of\" lists next time I visit SF.",

    "review_text": "Had hear a lot of good things about Park Tavern. \u00a0I usually dig the New American style food. \u00a0I feel like it's the best type of menu to read my mind and present me with something that I want before I know what I want. \u00a0Also, this new place looked a bit out of the ordinary from the usual restaurants in North Beach. \u00a0So yes, I was sold, had to check it out, and finally ventured in with some friends this past weekend. \u00a0   Now one item in particular that I had heard about: *Deviled eggs, bacon, pickled jalepe\u00f1o &amp; chives \u00a0$2 ea  This is supposedly a must order item. \u00a0Upon deciding to go here I immediately started thinking about them. \u00a0How good could they be? \u00a0Would they literally be the best deviled eggs I had ever had of all time? \u00a0Would I potentially eat 100? \u00a0They are only $2/each. \u00a0Would we all have a deviled egg eating contest with the winner getting 1 million dollars in Monopoly money? \u00a0Literally anything could happen...  That includes the plot twist of sitting down and upon opening my mouth to order them, the server said, \"sorry to interrupt, but wanted to let you know we are out of deviled eggs.\" \u00a0He explained that they give these complimentary to tables that have a longer than normal wait. \u00a0I asked what they were going to send us complimentary for being out of the one item we were all desperately been wanting to try. \u00a0He stared at me blankly...Holy #$%&amp;, the night was ruined...  But then life went on and the following was ordered among the various folks at the table...  *Kettle One/Soda with two orange slices $10 - It looked like they had a lot of good cocktails, and normally I would have gone for something like the PT Old Fashioned, but I was in a vodka/soda mood, so continued on with that simple order and made it just high maintenance enough by throwing in the two orange slices thing. \u00a0Cocktail next time. *Demons on horseback \u00a0$13 - Deliciously tasty prawns. *Housemade beef jerky \u00a0$7 - Really? Beef Jerky? Ok, whatever, it was damn good. *Lemon chips, dill pollen, burrata, &amp; Shelley's pea tendrils \u00a0$13 - Not enough lemon chips to go with the burrata, but I guess that is ok, I managed to finish it off. *\"Marlowe\" burger, caramelized onion, cheddar, bacon, horseradish aioli &amp; fries \u00a0$14 - I didn't order this, but of course I tried a bite. \u00a0This burger alone is worth a trip back. \u00a0It was delicious! *\"Poulet Rouge\" Bloomsdale spinach &amp; Peewee potatoes \u00a0$25 - This was my epic order and this game hen rules. \u00a0I honestly enjoyed this more than the uninspired chicken at Zuni Cafe. \u00a0Throw in the delicious spinach and pewee potatoes and this was simply a homerun. Not to mention they serve it upright in this giant iron skillet type thing. \u00a0We were sitting in the middle of the dining room, so I'm assuming that anyone on the fence of what to order saw what I had and followed my lead. \u00a0 This obviously most likely lead to soaring profits that night, which I'll take credit for. \u00a0  So I wish I had room for dessert, but that game hen won. \u00a0I was stuffed. \u00a0Good times, and I plan to be back. \u00a0Hopefully they will deliver complimentary deviled eggs based on this incredibly sad story about being out the first time I visited.",

    "review_text": "Was super busy on a Wednesday around 7:45pm. We talked with the hostess saying that a table would be about 45 minutes, but they gave us the option of dining at the bar or at the communal table. Decided to get a drink and put our name on the bar's dining list. The bartender was really nice and said that there was a party of two before my friend and I, and he got us started on drinks. About 15 minutes later, he came over and said that he had to unseat us because someone had to take the seat I was sitting on to dine. He felt really bad, so he comp'd our drinks (@ $12 each, I didn't mind that one bit). He then sent us back to the hostess and within 10 minutes she got us a seat. Granted, it was at the communal table, but I didn't care at this point. At least they were super nice and accommodating about it.   Now the review:  Bread: Eh, could have done without it, but I was starving.  Fries: Eh, standard. Not much to say about it. It came with parsley and horseradish aioli which made my face scrunch up. Weird combo, but I guess there's people who like it...  Roasted Halibut: Fish was cooked perfectly, but a little too salty for my taste.  Friend ordered the Pork Chop: Really good from my taste of it.  For drinks we both got the Greenpoint (Bulleit Rye, Yellow Chartreuse, vermouth &amp; bitters). I love this drink; I've been here once before for drinks and I ordered this one then, with dinner this last time, and probably if I ever make it back out here.  Overall, the food was good, but I'm giving 4 stars mainly because of the service.",

    "review_text": "This is one of my new favorite places to eat in San Francisco. \u00a0It's big and comfortable, and I really appreciate how the staff is friendly and helpful.  Thoughts on Park Tavern:  1) The \"Marlowe Burger\" is better here than at Marlowe. \u00a0Strange, but convenient for me.  2) The service is much better at Park Tavern than at Marlowe. \u00a0Marlowe servers are somewhat unfriendly and sloppy.  3) Must eats:  -Poulet Rouge. \u00a0A whole game hen served standing on a cast iron pan. \u00a0People will stare. \u00a0I actually loved the accompanying spinach the first time, but last night the spinach was too salty!  -Pork Chop: \u00a0This is no Nopa pork chop, but the flavor is great and the texture is perfect (if you're ok with pink pork). \u00a0The first time we tried to order this, they ran out! \u00a0So go on a weeknight.  -Birthday cake: I'm not kidding, their layered cake is perfect. \u00a0I got chocolate; next time I want to try coconut. \u00a0Not too sweet. \u00a0When I ordered this, the bf didn't want dessert....but he ended up eating half of it in 10 seconds!  -NY Steak Crudo: This is the best raw beef I've had. \u00a0I like it better than tartare (although I do love Marlowe's spicy tartare!)  -Wild arugula, mushroom conserva, porcini &amp; charred onion vinaigrette. \u00a0Yes, this is a salad. \u00a0The charred onion vinaigrette is delicious. \u00a0It's smoky and pungent and I tried to lick my plate clean. \u00a0It's a large portion and shareable. \u00a0We split this in 2 and each had a \"dinner salad\" at some other restaurants. **If I came alone, I would actually order the Steak Crudo and the Arugula salad as my dinner.  -Deviled egg: I thought this would taste too bacony (as in the bacon flavor overpowering everything else), but the bacon, pickle, and egg together are pretty awesome.  -Brussels Sprout Chips: I love these at Marlowe--they're fried perfectly and are lemony. \u00a0When we ordered these last night, they came out over-fried and burned-tasting. \u00a0Also they were greasier at Park Tavern. \u00a0Could just be an off batch. \u00a0:(  4) Things I'd Skip:  -Fried Pork Belly Bites: not for me. \u00a0You have to really like pork fat to eat these. \u00a0They're mostly fat, almost no meat. \u00a0And they're coated. \u00a0I prefer flash fried and braised pork belly.  -Creamed seasonal greens: When we ordered this, the sauce had a truffled goat cheese in it. \u00a0I had not expected this. \u00a0I don't like things to be truffled (overpowering taste) and I don't like goat cheese. \u00a0I couldn't eat it.  -Twice baked potato. \u00a0I also didn't like this one. \u00a0It was just OK. \u00a0Cheese was a little sharp for me for such a rich dish. \u00a0I would have liked some acidity and some more salt on this.",

Rabbit, duck and foie gras terrain - didn't pair well w/the mustard and pickles. The dish itself was very acidic and the flavors weren't well balanced. The terrain was a little too salty for my liking.  Oysters Caesar - way too fishy! While the concept is nice, I'd rather have fresh raw oysters w/o the grit, slime and fry.

Then we also tried the following items: Raspberry &amp; Blueberry Dutch Baby - This was delicious and we saved this for our 'desert' item. The berries were a good combination of sweet and tart.   Butter Lettuce &amp; Maine Lobster salad - This left little to be desired. It had a nice flavor but we couldn't find much lobster on it. Not worth the $17.   Crispy Polenta Cakes with Wild Mushrooms - The flavor of this plate was amazing, especially if you are a mushroom/truffle lover. I'm usually not a fan of grit-like texture and runny eggs, but the combination of ingredients on this plate were great.   I enjoyed the entire experience - the decor, the meal, the company.

Duboce: Bank note scotch, yellow chartreuse, benedictine &amp; bitters ($12) A very pretty cocktail.   Now onto the food! Between the four of us, it took us a while to pinpoint what we wanted. We finally settled on the following.   Smoked deviled eggs: bacon, pickled jalapeno &amp; chive ($2 ea) Best deviled eggs ever! The bacon, jalapeno and chive just elevated the eggs. If I were coming back for a snack at the bar, I'd come back for this! Sooo good!  PT fries: truffle, soft cooked egg, caviar ($14) Omg! These were amazing! Probably one of the best versions of truffle fries that I've had. The fries were crispy but soft in the center. And dipped in the egg and caviar or truffle dip?! I was in heaven!  Wagyu beef jerky ($7) I didn't care for this. I typically like my beef jerky softer, so this wasn't my fav.  Braised lamb tongue: french fingerling potatoes, mustard greens, soft cooked hen egg &amp; horseradish ($14) I picked this dish since I love tongue! The tongue was soft but I wanted something crunchy on the dish to give it texture. Everything on the plate had a rather mushy texture.  Grass fed ribeye: potato puree, baby carrots, cipollinis, blue lake beans, arugula &amp; chimichurri ($38) The steak was cooked perfectly!  Poulet vert: fines herbs, french fingerlings, thumbelina carrots, baby leeks &amp; mustard jus ($29) This was as beautiful as it was delicious! The hen was super moist and juicy! I was actually expecting the hen to be larger, but it's a good size for one or for sharing.   Venison carpaccio: classic angus beef tartare, capers &amp; crispy bone marrow ($18) The tartare was excellent! We got this a little later so I only took a bite. I didn't realize there was crispy bone marrow until after dinner when I was looking over the menu! So bummed since I didn't try the fried marrow!   The rest of the dishes I don't recall too well. A few drinks and lots of coursed plates can do that to me from time to time, but we also got: -Grilled pork chop: cranberry bean &amp; sweet pepper ragout, preserved tomato, red mustard &amp; peppadew ($27) -Wood oven roasted beets: agrodolce goat cheese &amp; breadcrumbs ($8) -Brown butter brussels sprouts: parmesan &amp; chili flakes ($8)  Since it was Bobby's birthday and we were celebrating, our server gave us a free dessert! We got the birthday cake since it was fitting and also ordered the creme brulee. The July's birthday cake ($9) with James vanilla &amp; strawberry creme cake, mixed berry compote &amp; cream cheese frosting was light and fluffy and not too sweet. The Tcho chocolate creme brulee ($8) with chocolate biscotti, chili, lemon zest &amp; sea salt wasn't really my cup of tea since it mixed sweet and salty, but everyone else loved it!  After the meal, we were all talking about how great the Deviled eggs and PT fries were. Everyone loved them! I'd definitely come back just for those dishes! Add the Poulet vert and that may just be the perfect meal!",

Finally, we decided to stop by since it has always been on our to-try list. \u00a0   The crowd ranges from mainly 30's to 50's.   Generally, the establishment is modern and chic. After getting seated, we knew immediately that we wanted to try the brussel sprout chips, the pork chop, and the Poulet Rouge which is a whole chicken. Be warned that the Poulet Rouge may take awhile to cook. \u00a0  The brussel sprout chips were delicious. Perfectly salted and crispy. They were fun to eat!   The pork chop was moist, I thoroughly enjoyed the taste with the sweet apple pairing with polenta. Halfway through my meal, it started to feel a bit heavy.   \u00a0 The Poulet Rouge looked intense as it is served on a platter sitting upwards. Overall, my boyfriend thought it was okay as it started to taste heavy as he ate further into the dish.   \u00a0 Our waitress was splendid. She constantly came back to check on us to make sure everything was tasting okay and that our water was filled. \u00a0  3.5 stars. Park Tavern. Check.",

Our charcuterie board (our waiter's favorite thing on the menu) was mediocre at best. The bone marrow, which I didn't know could be anything be succulent and delicious food of the gods, was undercooked and just not cooked right somehow. The foie gras was lacking in the rich buttery flavor it should have and had a texture more like the gelatinous bone marrow fat.  The only other thing I actually enjoyed were the Shrimp with avocado and lardo (the name was something horseman, I dunno) but that's just because I fucking love shrimp. The avocado was so unripe it was literally crunchy. I don't know how they cut the thing into slices.  Obviously, I would be judging the place much less harsh if my bill was under $175 for two people, but it wasn't. I would consider myself ripped off for mediocre food I could have easily made better.",

    "review_text": "My friends and I came to Park Tavern to celebrate a couple of birthdays (and yes, one of them was mine). \u00a0We had a 5:30 pm reservation on a Saturday night and expected to walk into a half empty restaurant but the place was packed and bustling at that early hour. \u00a0I would describe this restaurant as a place that serves comfort food with great service in a brasserie setting.  Seated at a table along the wall, we had a great view of the restaurant, kitchen and bar area. \u00a0While waiting for the rest of the party to arrive, three of us started off with some of PT's house cocktails. \u00a0I tried the Washington Square and really enjoyed the various flavors of the drink - hints of bitterness with citrus and ginger. \u00a0One friend ordered the Country Lawyer and although that drink smells like it could put hair on ones chest, it was actually quite pleasant and went down rather smoothly. \u00a0No hairy chests to be found on all those that took a sip!  To whet our appetites we ordered the Demons on Horseback (shrimp wrapped in lardo), burrata with lemon and basil and the charcuterie platter. \u00a0Personally the housemade charcuterie platter was my favorite, as the salami and pate were delicious. \u00a0The shrimp was okay, but nothing special. \u00a0The burrata seemed to be a hit with one friend. \u00a0The fried lemon slices are really, really good and I would pop them like chips if I could.  For the entree I ordered the Poulet Rouge with spinach and peewee potatoes (they were really cute). \u00a0The chicken is roasted on a vertical rack, with the spinach and potatoes recipients of the juices that drip down from the chicken. \u00a0The dish is so simple, yet so good. \u00a0The chicken, aside from being a sight to behold, was moist and tender and full of flavor. \u00a0The meat was pretty much falling off the bone, and a knife isn't really needed. \u00a0Make sure you ask for extra bread to sop up all those chicken juices.  For dessert, we ordered the birthday cake (with two candles), Arnold Palmer boozy float, the cheese plate and the apple crisp. \u00a0They ended up delivering two very generous slices of birthday cake (chocolate with chocolate buttercream frosting), each with a candle (trick candles too!) and both were on the house! \u00a0That was so incredibly nice of them. \u00a0And who doesn't love a well made birthday cake (sorry, but supermarket cake frosting icks me out)! \u00a0The person that created the Arnold Palmer float is a genius. \u00a0There is no stopping after that first sip. \u00a0The apple crisp was good and full of the flavors of the fruit. \u00a0I'm not big on eating desserts but in this case that cake was so good I couldn't stop digging my fork into it. \u00a0 I wish more places offered birthday cake for dessert. \u00a0Sometimes a simple dessert is the perfect ending to a meal of comfort food.  Our wait staff was on point and provided great service, answering all of our questions and making sure our needs were met. \u00a0Given how busy it was, we were really happy with the attention we received. \u00a0PT is a good place for dinner and/or drinks for large and small groups. \u00a0 Would I come back? \u00a0Absolutely. \u00a0How does it compare to Marlowe? \u00a0PT is more like the big city cousin, a bit more formal than Marlowe, which is more laid back and casual.",

    "review_text": "Wow... (slowly nodding my head sideways). Expectations can be high after reading the numerous reviews about this rejuvenated North Beach hot spot; especially, when hearing that I no longer needed to trek to Marlowe to try their famed burger or deviled eggs. \u00a0I called the restaurant about ten days earlier and scored a 5:30 pm reservation for a Friday night. \u00a0The dining room was barely half full, but the bar was already hopping. \u00a0We were seated at a window table, which probably sheltered us some from the noise level that progressively rose as diners arrived. \u00a0The menu offered a large selection of choices, but I already had some idea of what to order. \u00a0Our waiter was helpful in recommending the third appetizer and fulfilling my fruity nonalcoholic drink request. \u00a0Here's what we ate:  Appetizers (all shared) 1) Deviled Eggs (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pWX0F9mi_VlN1IAxweSQ?select=-BpBA2ePshJbkHA8yrBrVA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pW\u2026</a>) - This signature dish lived up to the hype.  2) Lemon Chips (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pWX0F9mi_VlN1IAxweSQ?select=UmGs6fQjtjfTFqGloNYFWA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pW\u2026</a>) - Paper thin slices with pleasant zest, but, given the price, something we'd probably pass on next time.  3) Demons on \u00a0horseback (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pWX0F9mi_VlN1IAxweSQ?select=n8iM1d4gf7oEroTz5d6qJg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pW\u2026</a>) - Recommended by our waiter, the large spot prawns were clean flavored and the bacon gave a nice fatty, savory contrast.  4) Marlowe Burger (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pWX0F9mi_VlN1IAxweSQ?select=nmnx1kjjyvKuIcR_KkRzeQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pW\u2026</a>) - Cut in quarters for sharing, the burger was good, but not quite to die for.  Entree 5) Grilled Pork Chop (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pWX0F9mi_VlN1IAxweSQ?select=J30m39thFwXVEfvGh8xrzQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pW\u2026</a>) - Cooked to a perfect medium temperature, the pork had a pleasant combination of tenderness from the center meat and firm bounce from the grilled outer areas.  Dessert (shared) - 6) Creamsicle (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pWX0F9mi_VlN1IAxweSQ?select=R-7hWbO79JG8zpexmw5l3w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pW\u2026</a>) - Topped with a candle for the birthday guest, the visual surprisingly lived up to the namesake's flavors. \u00a0Hope this is on the menu next trip.  As we relaxed while waiting for our food, we couldn't help but notice the variety of vehicles that pulled up to the valet stand; one could liken it to an auto show, testament to their customers' demographics. \u00a0Service was efficient and water/drink glasses were filled; empty plates were quickly cleared. \u00a0 Overall, this was one of the finer meals I've experienced recently in the City. \u00a0Plus it left me wanting to return for MORE!",

We set reservations for 10am when the restaurant opened and when we got there, we were seated outside in front as it was a bright sunny day. We sat there fore a while without anyone coming to take our order. Right when I was about to speak up, the owner came out and explained that the main waiter was running late. So the owner who was extremely nice sparked up a conversation with us and apologized for making us wait. He ended up taking our order which was fine.   So we ordered the pan-fried corn beef hash, cast iron-baked farm eggs, and an order of  buttermilk pancakes. To top it off, I ordered the boozy smoothie cocktail. We thought the food was delicious. My only complaint is that the boozy smoothie, while really good, was definitely smaller than I expected for the price.   We didn't really experienced the ambience inside (since we sat in front) but the outside tables had comfortable chairs and the tables were nicely decorated with white flowers (my wife's favorite).   Overall, we enjoyed the experience and the food. We would definitely recommend that our friends check this place out at least for brunch. We hope to make it back sometime to check out their lunch and dinner menus.",

I enjoyed Moose's back in the day, that gave way to Joey and Eddie's and has since shuttered. Now the Marlowe team with Dave Stanton of Tres Agaves has taken the Marlowe concept and multiplied it in a singularly large space. They've darkened the interior and given it a nice brasserie classic look. After having a business meeting across the square, we made our way over for dinner.  Some Marlowe classics and some new ones to be sure read across the menu, all sounding very good. With four people you can do a lot of damage so our order storm looked like:  -NY Steak crudo, horseradish, arugula &amp; parmesan -Brussels sprout chips -Sea salt &amp; vinegar pork rinds -Pork belly bites, horseradish aioli -House made beef jerky -Fried oysters \"Caesar\" salad -Yellow Doll watermelon &amp; Mangalitsa prosciutto, truffle &amp; mustard greens -Creamed seasonal greens -Roasted farmers market peppers -Twice baked potato, cr\u00e8me fraiche, cheddar &amp; scallions -Anson Mills polenta, roasted nectarines &amp; balsamic glaze -Park Tavern \"Poulet Rouge\", Bloomsdale spinach &amp; Peewee potatoes -Lamb chops, Merguez sausage, greens -Fernet milkshake -Seasonal Fruit crumble  Did I say we were having a feast? As to Marlowe's excellence everything was delicious. We finished just about everything. A fantastic meal. Even their cocktail program is excellent. I had a drink I'd never seen before, the County Lawyer,which is a classic throwback to the days of yore. Our server took great care of us and made quite a few great recommendations. I think one of the highest praises you can give a restaurant is that if you can't tell that they just opened, they're doing something right. It flowed like they'd been open for a while. Definitely worth a trip back if you're on this side of town and not already at Marlowe.",

Ambiance: \u00a0This place is sleek. \u00a0Like really sleek. \u00a0It has a very sophisticated, 1920s decor. \u00a0I was personally absorbed with the vantage point from the front door; to the right you see a very classic bar that has both standing and tall tables, while to the left you have the main dining area. \u00a0You may catch yourself being absorbed with the modernly metallic, yet classically appealing lighting, same as you may come to appreciate the intricacies of the tiled floor. \u00a0The bathroom is also quite impressive.  Service: \u00a0Ack, the sticking point. \u00a0We ordered about 5 things - two entrees plus three items from the small plates/appetizer menu. \u00a0The food came out in a disjointed series of some together, some later on, and some being forgotten. \u00a0We sat for a good 15 minutes before our order was taken, and we spent another 10 minutes before our drinks arrived. \u00a0Mind you, this was on a Sunday night, but it was the Sunday before MLK Jr. Day, so it was unusually busy. \u00a0The bright spot is that when we asked for our Deviled Eggs (the item that never came and had been forgotten), the waiter was kind enough to comp us for it on our bill.  Food: \u00a0We came here specifically because of a review that I saw in the San Francisco Chronicle. \u00a0We were prepared to be wow-ed if not amazed. \u00a0In the end, it was good, but nothing was amazing great. \u00a0One item in particular that we REALLY wanted was the Brussel Sprout chips. \u00a0They were out (grin). \u00a0So we got the Deep Fried Oysters... \u00a0They were okay. \u00a0We also got the deviled eggs... which were tasty. \u00a0We split a burger, and they were kind enough to double up on the fries that came with it, but... nothing about this burger was remarkable.  Maybe next time we'll try different items. \u00a0I give this place a 3.5 - 3.75. \u00a0I'll try it again someday, but hopefully I'll have a better time.",

I have been here twice and each time, i had wished that I just ordered an assortment of appetizers instead of my $30 entree that I didn't love. This past visit I ordered the halibut(one of the two pescatarian items on the menu. No vegetarian item entrees and the other fish entree had bacon in it) the portion was extremely small and my favorite part ended up being the corn that sat underneath the fish. It just didn't have much seasoning or any sauce.(on a side note, my friend ordered the pork and he loved it. and the portion was HUGE). I know their menu is seasonal so i may have better luck next time.  The hostess staff is excellent. I know they are always busy and you always need to have a reservation but when the 4 of us walked in, they were able to seat us immediately outside under a few heat-lamps and provided blankets. wonderful. :)  I was disappointed in our server. He seemed a little out of it. We ordered drinks and they took close to 20-25 minutes to get them. When we ordered our second round of drinks, again it took close to 20 minutes. Our bill was almost $300 and we couldn't get our drinks. IT was just weird. The whole meal process was very long....  On the upside, i love the appetizers. The brussel sprout chips, marinated olives and devilied eggs are yummy. I can't wait to try the crab dip and the cornmeal crusted oysters :)",

NY Steak--which was 3 or 4 pieces of Steak served with fingerling potatoes and it was just ok...when I order a steak at a bistro, please serve it hot, sizzling and WHOLE...what's this piece meal crap? \u00a0Didn't want to chance a mediocre dessert as it certainly wouldn't be worth the calories if it was anything like the dishes we received up til then. \u00a0 Prices seem very high for the quality of food--I'd rather spend the same amount of dough at House of Prime Rib when I'm in a carnivorous mood. \u00a0Probably better to go there for Cocktails before heading elsewhere in that fabulous North Beach Location. \u00a0 What a disappointment...I really was hoping Park Tavern would be great.",

Must eats - deviled eggs, marlowe burger, short ribs. Must drink their cocktails, everything is amazing and reminds me of the mixology at Beretta or Locanda.   * BREAD: Tasted like Acme - always a good thing :)  * DEVILED EGGS ($2 / half egg): Topped with a crispy, thin slice of bacon, and made with pickled jalapeno and chives. Wow, I did not know deviled eggs could be so delicious!   * TRUFFLED FONDUE with torn bread ($14): This was an interesting dish, with a hint of truffle which you could smell more than taste. $14 for a small-ish bowl of cheese and a side of torn up bread seems steep.  * MARLOWE BURGER ($14): Wow, delicious and juicy I can see why people rave about it! It seems so simple - carmelized onion, cheddar and bacon, but it was so delicious. Comes with fries and horseradish sauce on the side.  * POULET NOIR ($28): This is a whole chicken, incredibly flavorful down to the core. I just wish it was a little more tender and that they used a bigger chicken. Still prefer Zuni, for overall flavor and juiciness, but this was really good.  * BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIBS ($24): Every component of this dish was so perfect, and tasted very soulful. I could eat this every day.  * SIDE BRUSSELS SPROUTS ($8): Too bitter on the inside, yet overcooked with too much butter. Pass.  * HARBISON CHEESE: Soft, white cows milk cheese. I never order the cheese course because it's too extravagant, but this was a winner and I'm glad I got it. The cheese was soft and paired perfectly with cab. Awesome cab.  * PANNA COTTA ($7): I'm picky with my panna cotta and like when it's uber thick and creamy. This was good, but more delicate like the type at Seven Hills, like it's made with more gelatin or low fat milk. Good but would not get again.  * APPLE CRANBERRY CRISP ($7): I was surprised by the large portion size, it was good and tasted exactly like I would have expected but don't plan to get it again.  * BLOOD AND SAND ($12): If you like scotch mixed with something sweet and tart, this is the perfect balance.   * OLD CUBAN ($12): I preferred the old cuban because it was more refreshing and felt less potent than the blood and sand.  * LADERA ($18): Amaaazing cab, but ouch it was expensive.",

Granted it's not a big deal, but the people at the table behind us had left, and the table wasn't cleared of a big pile of dirty plates for at least 20 minutes.   Unfortunately the food was also nothing to rave about. Two people ordered the pork chop, which was a huge piece of meat on top of veggies that basically amounted to pure mush. Another individual's fish stew was too salty to eat, and the cornish game hen, for all the hype, was unfortunately nothing special. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing? The appetizers - Jerusalem artichokes and salted fish on toast - were delicious, though.  Overall the experience was disappointing for the price class; I would recommend this restaurant for a drink and appetizers.",

In one word? \u00a0Heaven. \u00a0Polenta cakes with truffled mushrooms and poached eggs? \u00a0Devine. \u00a0I don't even like mushrooms, but these were to die for. \u00a0My husband had veal schnitzel and fried eggs. \u00a0Washed down with a bourbon smoothie (booze, espresso, banana....hello, best milkshake EVER?)

Park Tavern, I know you're sexy. \u00a0I get it. \u00a0See and be seen, and all. \u00a0So evenings at Park Tavern are for lovers, and hot singles looking for other hot singles (with good taste in restaurants), and classy couples trying to keep their cool quotients high. \u00a0I get it.  But weekends, circa 11 am? \u00a0Weekend brunch is for families. \u00a0I was a little embarassed bringing my two year old to a restaurant that has been coined SF's new hot spot, but then I looked around, and the preschool set pretty much ruled the restaurant. \u00a0Because brunch is for families. \u00a0So Park Tavern, can you do us families a favor? \u00a0All we need is a single selection just for kids. \u00a0I'm not talking junky paper kid's menus with a cup of crayons. \u00a0I get it. \u00a0You're sexy and all. \u00a0I'm just saying a discreetly placed note on the side of the grown-up menu, maybe a \"Little Combo\" (one pancake, some scrambled eggs, a piece of cinnamon sugar toast....I mean, since you asked). \u00a0Because really, your food is rich and delicious and spectacular, but a little too out of this world for the 5 little girls that came for a \"ladies lunch\" with their moms one table over. \u00a0Brunch is for families. \u00a0Just sayin'",

Entree - 4, all the food was on the salty side, which took a little away from the food. However, high quality ingredients, decent menu selection. \u00a0Unfortunately, they were out of duck. \u00a0Mussels were cooked perfectly and large portion, but the tomato broth was disappointingly bland. \u00a0Pork chops and salmon looked good.  Dessert - 4, apple crisp was delicious and generous portion with Fuji apples and ice cream. \u00a0Tcho chocolate Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was bad. \u00a0Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was never meant to have chocolate. \u00a0It was more like a mousse. \u00a0Don't call it something it's not.

The drinks are great, this gin drink called the Maclaren is my go to, and the food has never disappointed. It can be incredibly rich so I've learned to order a bit less than I'm tempted to get. The bday cake is a fun touch and the staff is always great. The bar and hostess staff in particular is good. The waiters/waitresses that service the communal table seem to rotate a lot.

Will definitely order this again.  Warm baguette with nut butter - 2/5. Basically just filler food. This is pretty identical to getting bread at a restaurant.  Crispy polenta cakes - 4/5. It was good, but portion was small. May consider ordering this again if I wanted something light.  Overall, I would come here again for brunch with friends. Food I tried wasn't particularly spectacular.",

I LOVE this place! \u00a0Hippest, hottest restaurant in SF right now by far! \u00a0Not to mention the food and beverage selection is absolutely amazing- they stick to classics (with a twist) and are always adding new exciting dishes/drinks to the menu! \u00a0GREAT wine selection! \u00a0Priced well for fine dining in the city, too! \u00a0Service is excellent...not pretentious but still has a very VIP atmosphere- extremely accommodating! \u00a0Make a reservation if you don't want to wait (it's busy because they are doing something...or everything right)!   They recently opened a lounge area upstairs that I have been dying to pay a visit also!  My faves: Deviled eggs are literally the best I've ever had (bacon and truffle oil...duh?!)! \u00a0Brussell sprout chips are a must! \u00a0Fries with caviar, need I say more? \u00a0At brunch...POLENTA CAKES- to die! \u00a0On a nice weekend, the outside sidewalk seating is awesome.  If you are local or visiting, it is a must try!!",

I was way intimidated by the crowd when we first arrived but after huddling by the bar for a few minutes we were able to grab a spot. Customers and staff alike were so good-natured that the hubbub seemed more festive than chaotic. Phew!  We ordered the fried tomatoes, fried pork belly, deviled eggs, brussels chips, a salad and... ? It became a hazy, salty, greasy swirl as the wine flowed. We let their wine guy pick a couple bottles for us and we couldn't have been happier. Why don't I EVER write these recommendations down??  Can't wait to try their dinner and see how the menu develops \u00a0- I'm hoping my first impression holds up and it becomes a place I can take anyone. Down home food done upscale, woohoo!",

    "review_text": "Food was good - some dishes great. While I did enjoy my meal and the space is really nice, this didn't quite live up to all the hype.  Also: the prices were fairly steep. And the restaurant is LOUD. If you go with a group of 8 like I did, you could really only hear the people sitting immediately next to you. Not really an atmosphere for group conversation.   Not good for vegetarians. My friend couldn't see much on the menu for herself, and had several back &amp; forths with the server about getting something especially made from the kitchen.  MUST-HAVE: oyster caesar.  * Local halibut, avocado, onion, tomato $11: 3 stars Not bad, but just didn't stand out in any way. The dish is exactly as described, nothing more.  * Brussels Sprout Chips $6: 2 stars Had this at Marlowe, where I thought the lemon flavor was overpowering. Gave it another shot here, but still felt there could be a greater sea salt to lemon ratio. The chips are just too small and really could use more crisp. I am being picky.. brussels sprouts are my thing.  * Chicken fried green tomato, remoulade $7: 3 stars Nicely done, thin but crisp breading. Not bad, not fantastic either.  * Pork belly bites, horseradish aioli $6: 2 stars Pork belly should be much more fatty &amp; tender! I found the meat quite hard.  * Deviled eggs, Nueske's baken &amp; chives $1.5 each: 1 star I found this to be really plain in flavor. The yolk filling was just too egg-y if that makes any sense - I could barely taste the bacon &amp; chives, which should've balanced out its flavor mroe.  * Fried oysters \"Caesar\" $12: 5 stars Amazing! The oysters were absolutely delicious. When you took a bite and the soup-y insides poured into your mouth, it was savory and had an amazing rich flavor. The lettuce leaves with caesar dressing balanced out what would've been an overly intense rich flavor in the fried breading and the oyster.   * Yellow doll watermelon &amp; Mangalitsa prosciutto, truffle &amp; mustard greens $12: 4.5 stars Surprisingly wonderful! Loved the interplay of flavors, temperatures, and textures. Who would've thought that juicy/sweet watermelon would go so well with salty/dry prosciutto? Each time I chewed, my taste buds burst with more new flavor combinations.  * Lamb chops &amp; merguez sausage, broccoli rabe with garlic &amp; chili $28: 4 stars I didn't get to try this but a couple friends got the dish and it looked wonderful. The lamb was cooked rare to medium-rare and looked incredibly rich &amp; tender.  * Herb marinated whole cornish game hen, Bloomsdale spinach, carrots &amp; baby turnips $22: 4 stars Really delicious, juicy, tender, and well seasoned meat. A nice dish to get for the \"ooh's\" and \"aah's\" - the whole hen is served standing up!  * Risotto: 4 stars My friend got this special ordered as she's vegetarian. I had a bite &amp; it was creamy and had amazing texture. It had a tart sauce on top, which gave it a little too much of a sour flavor. Otherwise really good.  * Apple &amp; fig dessert with ice cream: 4 stars Loved it. Warm, soft slices of apple &amp; fig under a wonderfully crunchy yet subtle crust. The ice cream was a great contrast - we forgot what the menu said the flavor was, but we all agreed it had hints of lemon. It was light with a very smooth texture.",

The dessert made of chocolate and coconut that we had tasted like a bounty bar, so it was indifferent -- they gave us some small desserts on the house that were not on the menu and were much much better.  Only downside, the side chanterelles with sunchokes. It was not good. It was hard to believe that they came out of the same kitchen. Why do this to chanterelles, they are such a great ingredient?!  Oh, and I like the ambience: on the nice side, but modern, stylish and laid-back, not stuffy -- good for both the younger and older crowd.

I made my own entree so to speak by ordering everything a la carte, so I had shrimp covered in bacon, deviled eggs, brussel spouts, and mushroom pate. I would have to say the mushroom pate was the only thing I didn't care for. Not especially tasty. But everything else was to die for. Everyone around had dishes that looked delicious too. As far as the service, I did think our waiter was had a bit of a snooty attitude, but I guess that is what you would expect in a place like this. (He's not there to make friends) \u00a0I did like how he explained how everything was cooked to give you an idea of how the texture of your fish would turn out, for example.

Super packed, loud ambiance, \u00a0The tables are very close together, and things are even closer at the communal bar table. \u00a0We heard some very interesting conversations our neighbors were having that night.  We started with the PT fries, which were served with a spicy remoulade sauce, and a soft boiled egg with a little caviar.

They are attentive, even with a bar packed with people. Wine selections are great and I like that they offer carafes for certain wines.  2. The way the menu is laid out. It makes it super easy to find something for exactly what you're craving.  3. The ambiance is great and it's excellent people watching. The overall crowd is skewed older (40+), but you get a nice smattering of young professionals as well.   4. The food is so good and perfect for sharing.   I've been twice with just one other person, and deviled eggs, brussel sprout chips, burratta and one entree were more than enough. With three people, we did the same, but added a side and we each had more than enough to eat.   My picks: deviled eggs (cut it in half though, since the flavor is so powerful that you'll need two bites to savor the full flavor. Stuffing the whole thing in your mouth is just tragic.), burratta with fried lemon and basil - yum!, polenta side, the steak and the burger!   I'd skip: the brussell sprout chips don't do it for me. Not because they're not yummy, but because they have a funky aftertaste to me. The scallops entree - they were fishy. \u00a0  Pro tip - make a reservation on OpenTable. If you don't get the time you want when you make it, check back a few hours before. They usually have openings at the most desirable times.",

I was happy to eat here and was happy to sit at the bar and speak with the barkeep, who was experienced, knowledgeable, and friendly.  I'm envisioning you, dear reader, as one of several possible archetypes:  1. The guy looking for the top-rated place to take his girlfriend, irregardless of cuisine or neighborhood  2. The tourist (like I was) looking for a place to eat that is good and not filled with non San Franciscans.   3. The Yelper  If you're a number 1, you better make sure the girl is a number 1 equivalent because otherwise she'll be bored with the place, thinking you have no imagination although the food is good.

I came back the next weekend and then for dinner a few days later. I am rarely this enthusiastic about restaurants.   I rate Park Tavern 4.5 stars, but I'll round up and give it a 5 since I had out 4s pretty often.  The toasts were delicious and visually appealing:  * Sourdough toast with Dungeness crab + green goddess - $9 * Seeded whole wheat toast with avocado, chili flake, lemon + sea salt - $7  * Buttermilk pancakes - $10 for 3 So so so fluffy!  * Cast iron-baked raspberry + blueberry Dutch baby - $12 Sweet and tasty but small and gone too soon.   * Butter lettuce + Maine lobster, cucumber, shaved market vegetables, + dill vinaigrette - $17 Generous portion. The salad contrasted well with the other heavy carby foods I ordered, but I got a bit tired of the salad at the end. I recommend sharing this with at least one other person rather than tackling it alone.  * Veal schnitzle with poached eggs, marinated Spanish anchovies, frisee with lardons - $18 Nicely plated. The meat was tender and well-seasoned.   * Deviled eggs with bacon, pickled jalapeno + chives - $2 per half Super creamy and yummy!!   * Grilled pork chop with sauteed baby turnips, caramelized apple, Neuske's bacon + mustard jus - $24 The pork chop was a bit fattier than I expected, but it was cooked nicely.   A few things I was not that impressed with:  * French toast with caramelized bananas and vanilla syrup - $12 Given how good all the other brunch items were, I was surprised that the French toast was actually bad. The toast was not soaked through in batter, and half of it was extremely dry.   * Bloody Mary, Bloody Maria (tomatillo, cilantro, jalapenos, Anaheim chiles), Bloody Mariko (wasabi, miso, dashi) - $10 each The Bloody Mary variations were interesting but not memorable. The Bloodys are served with too much ice and get watered down quickly. (Ever since experiencing the $5 Bloody Marys at Thieves Tavern, I've had trouble appreciating Bloodys elsewhere.)  * PT fries with shaved black truffle + parmesan, truffle aioli, soft boiled egg + Osetra caviar - $20 We all balked at the price but had to satisfy our curiosity. I don't think the PT fries were much better than regular truffle fries. I could barely detect the shaved black truffle. I enjoyed the fries dipped in soft boiled egg yolk, but I didn't think the caviar added much to the combination as it was also barely detectable.  Other bonuses: * Beautiful space * Relatively easy to get reservations for small parties the next day or same day * Trendy, Pinterest-worthy touches like cocktails served in jam jars and toast served on slate * Outdoor or window tables with a view of Washington Square Park * Sightglass coffee served as well. I'm not a coffee drinker, but I know this meant a lot to my highly caffeinated friends.",

    "review_text": "I'm not sure what has taken me so long to write a review for Park Tavern, but I can easily say that it is my favorite restaurant in San Francisco along with Gamine which is located in Cow Hollow. I love both of them for very different reasons.   I've been here for both brunch and dinner several times (both amazing), so bear with me while I walk through the menu.  Beer and cocktails- My boyfriend and I love craft beer, and if you have read any of my other reviews, you'd know that I love Sudwerk out of Davis, CA. The Sudwerk Pilsner is on draft and is also featured in the Michelada at Brunch. Holy Moly does the Michelada leave a fiery sensation in your mouth, but the combination of the pickled jalepeno and the beer make it an amazing combination. The other three cocktails i've had are the Kentucky Mule, Dirty Martini, and the Country Lawyer. All I can say, is that the bartenders are fantastic and poor some amazing drinks.  BRUNCH: Boyfriend and I usually like to order several things when we go out to eat, so I'll give a tidbit of our favorites. \u00a0I'm not an egg person, so I'll give his opinion second hand.  Avocado Toast: SO good. I've tried to recreate this at home several times. The combo of the avocado, chili, and lemon is nothing short of amazing.  Grapefruit Brulee: Carmelizing the grapefruit definitely cuts the tartness of the fruit, and the sugary goodness just melts in your mouth.  Pan Fried Corn Beef Hash: BF loved the poached egg, and I mean, you really cant go wrong with corn beef hash.   Banana Coconut Fritters: delicious, but they are a bit on the heavier side, so be aware of that when ordering a lot of food.  DINNNER: If you only get to make it here once, here is what I'd recommend trying.  Brussel Sprout chips: These are flash friend brussel sprout leaves? that are tossed in lemon and salt. I'm almost positive that every time I've been to Park Tavern, we've had to order more of these chips. They have them at Marlowe (their sister restaurant) as well. SO good.  The \"Bar\" Steak: It's the perfect amount of steak and salad without feeling like I overate and leaving me with enough room for dessert. (I opt for the salad over fries because I like to pretend that I am healthy.)   \"Poulet Noir\"- This is hands down the best item in my opinion on the menu. For a first timer, order the baby hen intact. It comes sitting up and literally falls off the bone and has an amazing truffle taste. DISCLAIMER:it IS a little annoying dismantling the chicken, but we later learned to order it already chopped up. It just looks so pretty when it is still intact.   I've never had the lamb or porkchop, but i've heard they are both amazing as well.   Long story short, food and drinks are awesome, atmosphere is great, servers were great---Park Tavern= great.",

The waitstaff suggested some great wine (can't recall the name) to go with our mains. Don't miss the polenta side -- totally worth it even if there isn't really any more room in your stomach.

    "review_text": "Park Tavern has a fantastic location of overlooking Washington Square and a large and spacious interior. I have a feeling that chances of it being fully booked is a little slimmer than some of the other trendy but smaller venues with like 10 tables.   The menu has an array of interesting looking dishes. Although most tables around us were munching on squash blossoms, we opted in for the lemon chips with hummus dip. \u00a0So glad we went for that! The thinly sliced chips combined the crispiness of a potato chip with the lovely fragrance of a lemon. Refreshing and tasty!  The famous deviled eggs did not disappoint. Nice kick from the jalapeno bits inside and the bacon on top gave it a nice texture and additional flavor.  My entree, the red snapper, itself was okay. \u00a0I really was hoping black cod would still be on the menu, but it wasn't. \u00a0The bed of cabbage and leeks the fish sat on was incredibly flavorful. \u00a0That alone I can eat again and again.   One of us had the halibut which came on a nice bed of corn risotto. \u00a0The corn risotto was so smokey and sweet, again, made the fish itself pale by comparison.  Another friend got the Marlowe burger. I am not a burger eater so I didn't try but she said it was worth the hype as well, being very moist.   Some unknown birdie must have informed the restaurant that it's one of our birthdays. \u00a0Wasn't the intention of our dinner get-together, but one of us does have a birthday coming up next week. \u00a0The restaurant generously sent us a slice of chocolate cake for dessert. And when I say generously, I mean, the cake was large! It was delicious, but the four of us didn't finish it!  I would absolutely come back again. It seems to be the type of restaurant that has something for everyone, but still serves food innovative and tasty enough for the easily-bored, hard-to-please foodies.",

So frou frou it hurts. At least it was dee-lish.   Demons on horseback was shocking as my surf tasted more like turf; shrimp isn't supposed to taste purely of lard(on.)  Deviled eggs were not the absolute best I've ever had but the jalepeno &amp; generous crisp bacon gave it a smokey, spicy kick.   And finally, my salad (an appetizer I chose to have as an entree as the above mentioned grub was filling enough) was unexpectedly divine. I didn't think I'd be okay with chicories but when it's warm &amp; wilted like that, I'd gladly eat that bitter mess forever. And the poached egg mixed with bread &amp; bagna cauda(anchovies, garlic &amp; olive oil)... Let's just say the chef knows what he's doing.   Attention to decorating details (rivets in the leather, a tree at the entrance, the rustic wheel as a lighting apparatus), an enthusiastic waiter, food that makes me feel the $85 per person bill was worth every penny...five fancypants stars.",

The bar area was very lively and busy. We had a reservation and they seated us right away, although we were about 15 minutes early. We started with some cocktails, I enjoyed a Moscow Mule, my current favorite. Here though, they were a tad heavy with the lime juice and bitters - it was too tart compared to the ones I usually enjoy at other establishments. \u00a0My Dad and StepMom enjoyed some sauvignon blanc which they both said was very good. \u00a0Dad is serious about wine, and he remarked that their selections were impressive. \u00a0We next had the brussels sprout chips - soooo good. I'd had them at Marlowe and they were just as yummy here. I also had the pea soup, it was a summer style soup served at room temperature. It was a tad runny, but had excellent fresh pea flavor. Hubby had the prawns in lardo (sounds gross, I know, but it isn't what you might think) - they were heaven. Best prawns either of us had ever experienced. Dad enjoyed the anchovies and we all loved the fresh bread. I had the halibut on a potato and corn \"risotto\" and it was one of the best preparations of any fish dish I've had. Portions were perfect. \u00a0Hubby and StepMom had the black cod, they loved it. Dad had the Ahi, and also enjoyed it. We finished by sharing the peach cobbler and the dark chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e...they were very good, cobbler was a tad bland, but it did allow for the flavor of the peaches to dominate, rather than the toppings, I guess. \u00a0Husband had a nice espresso and Dad and StepMom had dessert wines - all three were happy with their selections. The people watching was fabulous - a see and be seen sort of vibe. \u00a0Lots of very young women wearing clothing that left nothing to the imagination and/or shoes that were two sizes too tall and trying to gracefully navigate their way to their table or the restroom, and plenty of men admiring their efforts. \u00a0I think our only constructive criticism would be that every time our plates came out from the kitchen, they were delivered to the wrong person at the table and that the wait between appetizers and main course was every bit of a half hour, maybe more. That's a little too long, but we made the best of it with all that people watching. I would go back, for sure, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.",

The only item that was really below par was the lobster and crab bisque. It was so salty it verged on bitter and this is coming from a gal who likes her sodium. After a taste I thought my hands were going to swell up to the size of baseball mitts!  As for everything else - they had a very comprehensive wine list and a few cool beers, like the red rice Japanese ale. The service was on point and very efficient.

When they opened up their super-sized Park Tavern in Washington Square, I knew it was going to be awesome. \u00a0You can fit probably 10 Marlowes in the old Moose's space. My party scored a table on a Friday night at 9pm. \u00a0I really liked the dark wood decor and open kitchen.  The bar was packed and lively. They had a handful of interesting cocktails, so I started off with a Washington Square with hangar vodka. Later on I also had a Golden Gate, made with shochu. I forget what else they were mixed with, but both drinks were inventive and tasty. They're definitely going to bring in a lot of thirsty bar hoppers with their cocktail program.  We went all out with the appetizers and shared pork rinds, fried oysters, fried pork belly, beef jerky, and brussell sprout chips. All the fried stuff was amazing, especially the oysters. I'm not a fan of brussell sprouts, but I enjoyed the crispiness. We also shared a bunch of side dishes, including the polenta, potatoes, and peppers.  For my entree I had the lamb chops and merguez sausage. The lamb was medium rare and perfectly cooked for my taste. The sausage was a flavorful bonus, but I thought the greens with the dish were way too salty. I finished off the meal with an awesome Fernet ice cream shake. It sounds funky, but I recommend it if you like Fernet.  The service was excellent and cheerful. You can tell they were all excited with the opening. I look forward to visiting them again soon.",

I especially loved the Devil on Horseback (prawns with lardo), lemon chips (fried lemon slices! Strangely delicious) and two applications of brussel sprouts.  Their wine selection kicks ass and we progressed from light (Pinot) to bold (Zins) reds. The cocktail selection was pretty sensational also.  Come eat outside on a sunny afternoon/ early evening... it is well worth it.",

Earliest reservation 9pm! Oh well we took it.   When we got there I was a little surprised how very busy and loud it was! Why the 4 stars? Because the food was very good, the famous brussels sprout chips were a unique experience, braised short ribs were cooked perfectly, and my wife said her pork chops was a win too! However I really can't get over how loud the restaurant was ...maybe just an extra busy night?

I had the Marlowe Burger which was awesome. The sauce that comes with the burger is (in my opinion) the best part (I am big fan of house-made sauces). I also had the grapefruit brulee.

We drove and used the $11 valet which is super convenient for the heart of North Beach.  We started with the deviled eggs and NY steak crudo. The eggs were just OK, with all the hype I was expecting a bit more...but they were almost too pickled like they had been sitting in juice for a long time. The steak crudo on the otherhand was fabulous. Slices cut about 1/4 inch thick, lightly covered with a lemon sauce, arugula pieces, and breadcrumbs. All the flavors complimented each other perfectly and the only downfall was that is wasn't twice the size to make me twice as happy!  For entrees we ordered the poulet rouge - tender, large, and living up to it's reputation; the pork chop - cooked perfectly, worked with all the sides it came with, yumm; and the tombo tuna - this was our least favorite, not much flavor, small. We also ordered a side of polenta - the richness of the dish contrasted perfectly with the pickled cabbage on top. One of the better polentas I've had!  For drinks I had the Mckinley to start. At $13 I expected more, it was nothing special. The Au Bon Climat Chardonnay was amazingly buttery and delicious, went perfectly with the fabulous meal!  We a port to end the night and were sad they didn't remember to bring out the birthday cake since we had stated with our reservation it was a birthday dinner. Oh well, we were satisfied enough with the overall experience that I will happily go back - as long as someone else is picking up this bill because this place aint cheap!",

We were a few minutes early for our reservation, so we ordered drinks at the bar, but were seated by the time we got them. Nice.   Service wasn't great, but it was only their second day, so it can totally be forgiven. Our server was very pleasant, just not very attentive.   We each a had a DELICIOUS deviled egg. I was impressed they could get so many textures and flavors in such a small item.   Neither of us had ever had fried green tomatoes, so we had to try them. They weren't overly greasy, (which is always my fear with fried food.) It was a perfect amount to share, and we both enjoyed them.   My hubby had the burger and fries, which was just as good as we remembered from Marlowe.   I had the mussels, which were awesome. The broth had great flavor, and i loved the bits of leek and sausage.   We shared the \"birthday\" cake for dessert, (it was even going to be my birthday soon.) It was light and moist, and a perfect finish to a great meal.   I really liked that many of their dishes are smaller, that way I get to try more items.   Good drinks, good food, beautiful space, and service that is sure to improve.",

I really can't say enough about the food at Park Tavern. The NY Steak crudo is delish as is the coconut cake.   The ambiance is amazing. The use of wood is exquisite and adds to the overall warmth of the place. The excellent use of the lighting just completes the overall environment.   The staff is friendly and brought out the courses in a timely manner. The cocktails were good and the wine selection is superb. I thought the restaurant experience matched the hype.  However, I made the mistake of using the valet service. It took forever for the valet to acknowledge me and took even longer to get my car back afterwards. I know he hates his job but no need to give attitude to the customers. They don't even have to be nice or smile. \u00a0A casual grunt and eye contact would suffice. \u00a0But that dude today - he definitely needs to learn how to work with his customers better. I can't believe this guy is allowed to park cars for a living. I highly doubt he knew what he was doing.  In conclusion, I love this restaurant.

The only reservation we could get was at 9:15 (they are always packed), but we got there early (parking spot right out front... how lucky is that?!) and had a couple cocktails.  We were seated right at 9:15 at a cute 4-top in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant has this hip new york feel to it, which I love. The server was super friendly and informative. We started with the Steak Crudo and Brussel Sprout Chips. The Steak was good... but it didn't blow my mind. The Brussel Sprout chips, however, we're out of this world.  I had the steamed mussels with fennel sausage and leeks, and it was incredible. \u00a0The sausage and leeks were minced very finely into the butter sauce, which tasted ohhhh soo good when I spooned it into the mussell. They served it with a crusty crostini, which I used to soak up the remainder of the sauce. Everyone else got the \"Marlowe Burger\", which was good.. but I wouldn't go that route at Park Tavern personally. Go to Marlowe for it! Park Tavern has much more variety than Marlowe, so I recommend trying something different on the menu. Will absolutely be back!",

Jennifer Puccio, executive chef, does both places, and I'll be damned if I forget how incredible that burger at Marlowe is.  I came here on a Sunday brunch around 1pm. Shockingly, there were reservations open and some of the tables were free as well.   FOOD: Banana coconut fritters with a tart raspberry jam were incredible. Not greasy whatsoever, this confection (clearly not calorie-free) was the perfect beginning to a brunch. I ordered the Marlowe burger after much debate between going savory or sweet (there's a smattering of carb-winking items stuffed with sweetness on the menu). The burger is large and comes with fries. I suggest you order it medium, as the medium-well was almost too done. My dining partner ordered the eggs with spinach. Portions were large.   ATMOSPHERE: The cavernous square shape allows booths to be placed within a square to the left of the bar and then free tables within that central square. It's very NYC restaurant. Decor is pulled straight out of the Restoration Hardware catalog-- many pieces I've seen in the showroom were in the dining room at Park Tavern. Y'all can't fool me! It's got a cosmopolitan yet French \u00a0countryside vibe- full of creams and dark chocolates. There IS outdoor seating, not much, but it's available. And because you're in North Beach, expect to see the shellacked faces and overpriced brows of Marina females, with heels and gloss, sitting not three feet from you. You get used to it if you're here long enough.  SERVICE: They're quick but I feel that three servers confuses the matter of tipping.   PRICES: It's not super cheap. But you know this going in.",

They throw a little black sea salt on the burrata cheese so each bite has good flavor and just a slight tang. With all this heavy savory appetizers, it's nice to have a little green on the table. I love the snap peas in the Sweet Baby Lettuces salad. You can taste the dijon in the vinaigrette and it's refreshing - especially if you're planning on having the steak! Unfortunately, the steak wasn't as exciting as the rest of the meal. Far too smoky for my taste. Not sure if there was some extra worcestershire sauce in the meat or au jus but i preferred the Red Snapper. Healthier, yet still outdone by the classics AND sides. I often roast brussel sprouts at home and still wanted to eat the entire dish at the restaurant. The twice baked potato surprised me in that it came in a scalloped potato plating. It was great, probably due to all the room that created for creme fraiche, butter and cheddar cheese. For dessert, i enjoyed the August Birthday Cake which could have been made for me! It was the lightest coconut flavored cake with lemon curd and plenty of whipped cream. I only stopped at 1.5 slices because we ran out of dessert at the table.. I'll absolutely be back for brunch.",

First, they take reservations, which means I know I won't be waiting in a two hour line after driving up to the city ... hugely valuable! Second, it's a great location right in front of Washington Square; they have tables out front and a full wall of windowed seating so that you can enjoy a little sunshine while you dine. That's how brunch should be eaten.  The drinks are totally on point. Let's face it, if you're not drinking at brunch, then you're doing it wrong ... that's just having breakfast late. They have a John Daly, which is a boozy iced tea that I can (and do) drink 3-4 of. Guess how good that makes me feel? Totally sets me up for Sunday funday.  Finally, the food is very good. I've had the Smoked Salmon Benedict; perfectly poached eggs (not easy to do and most places leave the white a little runny, which I hate) on top of a thin layer of smoked salmon, red onions, cream cheese, and toast. Damn good. The Crispy Polenta cakes are a close second. If you love umami, this bad boy has mushrooms, truffle oil and arugula! Finally, don't forget to grab an Avocado Toast as a starter. It's simple, but very tasty. My mouth is watering as I write this!  So, Park Tavern ... a total winner for brunch!",

My experience here came in waves of not good, ok, great, and amazing. I just love when that happens! Love it love it love it!   I pulled up to see the thing I love most - Valet! For $12 you can dress to thrill and wear sky scraper heels to dinner because the door is less than 20 steps away. That always makes me very happy!   The space is nice. The last time I was here was when it was Moose's. We were upstairs in the tiny private area after my friend was married at the church across the way.   Our meal consisted of things that were great and things that were not so great:  Skip the deviled eggs and demon on horseback appetizers. The Halibut entree was really nice. I loved the balance of the rich hearty broth with fresh peas and pea tendrils. The sear on the fish was a wonderful contrast.   The vertical poultry reminds me of beer can chicken. Any home chef familiar with Williams Sonoma has vertical roaster in their cabinet *wink*. I am not a fan of brining poultry because often times it winds up being too salty so I employ other methods. This baby was was tender and flavorful despite being salty for me. The rustic bread stuffing that served as a catch all for the poultry drippings was delicious. I especially liked how they didn't over use truffles because those can ruin it for me. I can see why people love this entree. I would easily recommend it.   Dessert. Banana Split. YES!! The house made ice cream was good - not as rich as I like, but perfect after that heavy meal. The carmelized bananas turned what we consider an everyday treat into something special. Just taking the time to blowtorch or flash broil the bananas makes this the kind of dessert I love. I really appreciate attention to detail. Rare to see that in desserts, which made me love it more.   We enjoyed service that was friendly, professional, unrushed. I was really happy. The seating isn't comfy, but when you are in good company - that matters little.   After our leisurely dinner we walked to Washington Square across the street. Ok - I held on to Mike for dear life trying not to break my neck navigating the uneven terrain in my heels.   Hey, if I fell, I would have looked undeniably faabulous. You can bet money on that!   Go to Park Tavern. Valet Park your car. Enjoy dinner and dessert (skip the over hyped appetizers). Take a short walk across the street, sit on a bench, and chat at Washington Square while your food digests ... because life is meant to be savored.  Park Tavern is a great place for that experience.",

The star of the show though was the chicken. SO GOOD! Moist and juicy and oh so flavorful. Such a neat take on beer can chicken. This is a mustttttttttttt try if you are here.  For dessert we shared the cheesecake parfait with smoked salt. Wow- it was a crowd pleaser!! The smoked salt atop was a great compliment to the creamy parfait.   Overall, a wonderful experience. Service was excellent and they even comped my mom's soup because it didn't come out at the same time as the rest of our dishes. Talk about customer service!!!! :)",

The appetizers (we had cheddar cheese and then fried sunchokes) were incredible!!!! So much flavor and great portions for apps. Then I had the bar steak which was so much food and so yummy and the boyfriend had the NY steak which was also SOOOO yummy!!!! \u00a0The only thing was the bone marrow we got was actually just bone and not any marrow (oh well- the rest was DELICIOUS). They comped us 2 desserts for his birthday which was so nice! The restaurant was clean and management was always around from what I could tell. The two hostesses were very pleasant.

First thing you notice is how loud the place is. \u00a0Definitely raised voices needed for conversation.  As for cuisine, it's standard American but with unique twists on classics. \u00a0The appetizers sounded more exciting so we ended up ordering a bunch of those rather than any entrees. A couple of standouts:  - Deviled eggs with bacon, pickled jalapeno and chives: I don't think I've ever met a deviled egg I didn't enjoy ... but some are better than others and the ones here are some of the best.   - Lemon chips with dill pollen, burrata &amp; Shelley's pea tendrils: this is probably a dish you won't find anywhere. \u00a0Literally thinly-sliced lemons that are fried ... extremelyl delicate and not overly sour as I had anticipated. \u00a0Very nice.  - PT fries with shaved black truffle and parmesan, served with a soft-boiled egg topped with caviar. \u00a0 At \u00a0over $17, probably the most expensive fries I've ever tried but they were decadent and delicious. \u00a0  - Demons on horseback (lardo-wrapped shrimp) - you can never go wrong with this combo.  - Brussels sprout chips - a must-order side.  The only so-so dish was the foie gras terrine were just ok (definitely have had better) and the crab dip (which, honestly speaking, may have been good but it was somewhat forgettable compared to other standouts).  The Country Lawyer cocktail (bourbon, vermouth, benedictine and chocolate bitters was outstanding (so good that I went and bought the bitters the following day just so I could make the drink at home).",

Well cooked and presented, but the flavors just weren't that exciting to me, and my dining partner was even less impressed than I was. I would eat here again, but probably won't seek it out, which is unfortunate as it's in my neighborhood.  And on a side note: when dining out, get off your smart phones and live a little! It creates a really different atmosphere to have everyone staring at their phones, the blue from the screens illuminating individual faces, rather than \u00a0people chatting with each other in convivial conversation.

The beef tartare was prepared really well. It had a very good balance of citrusy acid with the sweetness of the onions and beef.   All of that doesn't matter once you eat the crispy bone marrow. Each crunchy cube of deep fried bone marrow exploded with rich, savory, beefy goodness. I could keep eating those scrumptious pieces of heaven until they'd have to wheelbarrow me out. Although they're amazing on their own, they also enhanced the rest of the dish. Not only do they provide a crunchy contrast to the soft tartare and tender carpaccio, they also lend a rich fatty undertone to the otherwise raw and fresh nature of the other ingredients. The ingenious use of flavors and textural contrasts combined with the perfect balance of this dish make it a must have appetizer. Actually, forget what I said; skip it. I just want it all for myself!",

I've been procrastinating on this review, and they've already changed a couple of the dishes on the menu since my visit a couple of months ago, so I had to take a guess for some of the descriptions. I made reservations for an early dinner for a party of 5, and it was easy to do a couple weeks in advance for a Saturday night. We arrived and were seated quickly. We ordered:  -Complimentary Bread and Butter (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/park\u2026</a>): The bread and butter were really good- it's hard to go wrong with epi bread! -\"Marlowe Burger\" (Caramelized Onion, Cheddar, Bacon, Horseradish A\u00efoli &amp; Fries, $14, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#aew2-QxxyeL_NJBnMQ8APA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/park\u2026</a>): Just as delicious as I remember it being at Marlowe. Highly recommended. -Herb-Crusted Halibut (English Peas &amp; Pea Tendrils, Crispy Shallots, Prosciutto, White Wine Velout\u00e9, $28, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#fICBimLI_n5YnDY9Z8pwsA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/park\u2026</a>): My friend actually ordered this dish, and it was amazing! I rarely order fish at restaurants since I've had so many bad experiences with it being overcooked, but this halibut was cooked perfectly. The herb crust also added a nice crunchy texture, and all the components in this dish worked really well together. Highly recommended! -Heirloom Beet Salad (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#GHVYEfh5Xb5GqHLqZOA6Jw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/park\u2026</a>): Just ok. I liked the different varieties of beets, but overall the dish wasn't anything special. Skip. -Crispy Lemon Chips (Burrata, Nigella Seed, $14, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#Z5yOUZZaLC-DAsIF-NzA-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/park\u2026</a>): Very interesting, and something I've never seen before or tried, and probably for good reason. The burrata was creamy and delicious, but I didn't get the lemon chips idea. Skip on the lemon chips but the burrata is recommended. -PT Fries (Truffle, Soft-Cooked Egg &amp; Caviar, $14, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=bc5IsPTz39oVAcr5B5J7Ww#bc5IsPTz39oVAcr5B5J7Ww\">yelp.com/biz_photos/park\u2026</a>): Yum! The truffle fries were crispy and super aromatic, which added to the delicious flavor. I loved the soft cooked egg that you dipped the fries in, and the caviar on top of the egg. Highly recommended! -Smoked Deviled Eggs (Bacon, Pickled Jalape\u00f1o, Chive, $2/ea, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#yMLlFP470A0NQgFQBYkRkw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/park\u2026</a>): A-MAZING! A must order.! I'm not a huge fan of deviled eggs, but this version is the best I've had, ever, and this was an excellent addition to the 2013 Big Eat list. Make sure you order yourself more than one! -Brown Butter Brussels Sprouts (Parmesan &amp; Chili Flakes, $8, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#xpx_LG76RbSKaNj98QH6wg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/park\u2026</a>): Disappointing! I love brussels sprouts, and these were just ok. They were a little underseasoned and not quite crispy enough. Skip. -Strawberry Cake (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#9c85ppSiI_OQpBaK3TlGoA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/park\u2026</a>): Yum! This cake was delicious, and not too sweet. I loved how fluffy the cake was, and that you could taste the fresh strawberry in the frosting. Recommended.  Overall, I loved my dining experience at Park Tavern although there were some misses. Service was on par, and the kitchen was efficient. I also loved the decor and ambience here, and will definitely be back for another meal (and more deviled eggs) in the future! The biggest negative about dining here is the parking- it can take a while since this area gets so busy!",

They even did a couple of vegan/gluten free platters for the \"special\" people in my crew which were delicious and much appreciated. \u00a0A total success- Thank You PT!!!!!!",

    "review_text": "It has always been, and will always be, what's inside that counts.  While the space remains relatively the same, the heart and soul of this Washington Square location has been masterfully rewritten by Jennifer Puccio and the leadership of one of SF's best, Anna Weinberg.  Park Tavern is a sweeping space, with a penchant for details hidden under the history of a storied block.   There is a caffeine like energy which adds springs to conversations, and a charming glow that sets the very diners visiting at the core of it's design. Genuine, heart felt and hungry.   Our group began with a special unlike anything I've ever experienced. While fries may not seem extraordinary, the imagination of Puccio delivered.   Truffle fries nested on a plate, accompanied by a 3/4 eggshell which contained a creamy yolk cr\u00e8me topped off with caviar. The rich gravy coated each fry with a decadent cloak, which was only elevated by the delicate black ornaments of caviar.  Ketchup just lost the rose ceremony...  The house made charcurterie plate was a brilliant display of craft, and the duck liver crostini was a marvel. If you didn't feel guilty, you weren't enjoying it.  The grilled pork chop with dinosaur kale and toasted garlic served as the entree.  Fork to protein brittle, and matched with timed seasoning, the pork is a hit. Every note was selected with purpose, and the dish proved itself a phenomenal keeper.  Park Tavern is a mature adoption of another of my Weinberg favorites, Marlowe, and if this type of re-imagining continues, Anna might just have to run for Mayor.  Bravo.",

    "review_text": "Ed and Mary Etta Moose made Washington Square Park the cradle of civilization in North Beach starting in the early 1970's when they brought us The Washington Square Bar &amp; Grill on Powell at Union and later at Moose's across the Park. \u00a0Each was a landmark destination that became the hub or portal that unified San Franciscans in dialogue and spirited collaboration that enriched and never eroded the quality of life and spirit in 'The City That Knows How\". \u00a0I loved Park Tavern before I nibbled a single bite for the tribute table honoring Mary Etta Moose, the artist, gourmand, philanthropist and spirited voice of beautiful North Beach, the community.  I haven't tried the much of the menu yet, but I can attest to the quality and scrumptiousness of their burger, my heart's true calling. \u00a0I first tried Marlowe's after it first opened and loved it, especially the burger and fries. \u00a0Kinship to Marlowe's becomes harder to see the deeper you explore the eclectic, electric and exciting menu, and the more you take in the design that marry's so many warm and comfortable elements, remembered and wanted, that simply aren't in evidence elsewhere in the city. \u00a0The place is crowded like Moose's was, and the crowd is a melting pot like Moose's so it's got the feel of a place you want to be a regular at and be known by name and your unique peculiarities by the staff and your fellow regulars. \u00a0Former Mayor Brown has dubbed the place a success and a must stop on his weekly rounds, so maybe it arrived before the delivery.  The exposed kitchen that Ed and Mary Etta created is spiffed up and is the anchoring element of the well executed restaurant. \u00a0It's amazing how good the 'bones' of Moose's remain, because I still feel Ed's warmth and big personality greeting one and all in the space he so lovingly created. \u00a0I said the menu is exciting and that may be an understatement because although the focus appears to be on small plates and the unusual, the food is stylish and uber sophisticated. \u00a0It's also a little on the pricy side, but that isn't hindering anyone from making their way here and back so I'd say they're doing a lot of things right and their customers think so too. \u00a0The bar is wonderful and drinks are inspired and delicious, the staff are well trained and well chosen. \u00a0Beer and Wine lists are well thought out, and the whole place is clean and inviting, masculine and powerful, a real testament to North Beach and Ed Moose, this place is a compelling winner.",

This is slightly uncomfortable, but I will chalk it up to the fact that I couldn't stop eating despite that my body was definitely telling me that my stomach was already too full to go on.  What's to love about Park Tavern: - Lovely decor and great location central to North Beach and across from Washington Square Park - Hostess was super friendly, which is so important as they make the first impression. I mixed up the dates for my reservation and came in on the wrong date (seriously, this is the only time this has ever happened to me!) and the hostess was able to accommodate us on a friday night. THANK YOU!  - Since we were sharing the two entrees that we ordered, the server offered to split them up for us, which honestly never happens as an offer from other restaurants.  - We had been waiting for a while on the Marlowe burger and our server came over to us to tell us he had checked on it and it was being plated. Thanks for taking the initiative.  - Grilled pork chop was absolutely amazing! Wish it had more yellow peaches though.  - They have cocktails named for SF landmarks. Love love love.   Now the not so great things: - WOW parking is so terrible around here. They do have valet ($11), so use it if you are terrible at finding parking or just take MUNI. \u00a0 - Had high expectations for the Marlowe burger and only thought it was OK. Not a burger to write home about  I would highly recommend this restaurant. Next time, I'll have to try more of the items from the smoked/cured/fried sections.

The restaurant was nicely decorated for Christmas with white lights and a nice Christmas tree. \u00a0We were seated in the window area, a very pleasant section with views both outside to the park and into the restaurant. The tables were a little close together but with enough aisle space that it didn't feel crowded. \u00a0With a full house of large and small tables happy pre-holiday diners, the noise level was a bit high at first, but the overall atmosphere was so nice, we wouldn't let this keep us from returning.  Service was warm, efficient and knowledgeable. \u00a0The menu is varied and interesting. We enjoyed everything we ordered:  duck liver crostini arugula salad with mushrooms - unusual and very tasty pork chop with kale and butter beans scallops with cauliflower puree and braised fennel twice-baked potato \u00a0- so yummy with a lovely scallion flavor  There's a very nice selection of wines by the glass and the servings are very generous.  As a non-meat eater, I'd like to see a few more seafood and vegetable options on the menu. \u00a0Without even a vegetarian dinner option, a vegetarian would have a hard time ordering a meal here.  EDIT: I'm bumping my rating from 4 to 5 stars in response to the restaurant's decision to remove the \"healthy SF\" surcharge. This bugs me EVERY TIME I see it on a bill. It's as if the owners are saying, \"I'll give my employees health care...but I really don't want to.\"  Owner Anna Weinberg said \u00a0\"The way I saw it is that it's just become a cost of doing business, so you adjust your prices just like you do if your rent goes up.\" \u00a0 EXACTLY.",

The eggs were the perfect balance between creamy with a pickled pepper and a cilantro sauce. (better than Wayfarer Tavern). The smoked crab dip was plentiful and had a great smokiness top with Ikura. The truffles fried were seriously amazing. Shaved truffle, white truffle aioli, then a soft boiled egg with osetra caviar... Can it be any better? Then the lobster bisque was explosive with flavor not with too much cream. It came with a perfect bread pastry stick that made it almost too rich, but really it was perfect.then we had the pork chop which was brined then grilled. This was 3 stars in my book bc it leaned on the salty side and the polenta was overly creamy. I needed something to cut the richness.  The birthday cake was probably the least exciting.

The secret is to mention french fries; there's just something about potatoes fried to a golden crisp.   Park Tavern had me at PT fries, more specifically fries with truffle oil, soft-cooked egg, and caviar. I chose this restaurant for my friend's birthday celebration based solely upon that description for fries. I was pleasantly surprised that everything else we ordered was just as good, albeit nothing can take the place of the french fries.   (1) Lemon chips: Burrata has never done me wrong and did not this evening. (2) PT fries: Can you say food-gasm? (3) Marlowe burger: The burger is melt in your mouth good. The only thing that can make it better is bacon and low and behold, bacon is part of the burger. My tip is that you ask for the sauce that goes with the PT fries for the fries that come with the burger. You can thank me later. (4) Ribeye: Delicious meaty goodness with some veggies to \"balance\" out the gluttony thus far. (5) Chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e: The only item we ordered that was average. It tasted more like a pot de creme but I can't knock the restaurant for one item. (6) June \"birthday\" cake: Sizable portion that we devoured despite being full. This only helps to prove the theory that people have a second stomach for dessert.   Reservations recommended and try to book earlier rather than later. We were famished as we waited for 9:45 pm to roll around because that was the only time slot I could reserve.  Parking is a pain but I'm willing to sacrifice the money to pay for lot parking in order to get the fries.",

It'd been awhile since I was really faced with too many choices of things I wanted to try at a restaurant. Seems like they have a great balance of classic dishes that stay on the menu awhile, and some great seasonal additions.   The smoked burrata and steak tartare dishes were nothing short of amazing, although be prepared for some kick-ass zestiness on the tartare (which I loved). The NY Strip (my favorite cut of steak) was also perfectly seasoned and delish. I opted for the twice-baked potatoes over the fries and couldn't get enough of them--carbtastically amazing.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "review_text": "Good Times and Brussels Chips!  And so it was as Rene C., his wife Erica, Joanna M. and her friend MM gathered at Park Tavern after a Gogobot Party at Rosewood. It was a fine second choice as Tony's Pizza had a long wait on this Wednesday evening.   When we first walked in, the place was full and bustling with \"beautiful people\", including maybe even Mr. Joesten the 3rd. :) \u00a0Sometimes this much \"buzz\" means that both the clientele and restaurant are full of themselves, but in this case the Maitre D' was super accommodating in finding us an outside table. That sort of attentive and friendly service continued on with our waitress, the wine steward, and other support staff. We felt well taken care of during the entire evening, even though our total bill probably didn't come close to a few bar tabs still running inside.   Sitting outside also makes for better conversation and we had some good ones. The center of the conversation was MM's fascinating explanation of his new Marker App and tales of travel that have both experienced and wished that I could. The Yelp and Gogobot comparisons came up, as did OCD-fueled writing, and what how virtual social interaction is evolving. And all this engaging interaction timelessly continued while life on this side of Washington Square went walking or whizzing by on this comfortable evening. I knew I eventually had to get in the car and drive back to Pleasant Hill, but I was in no hurry for the evening to end.  But that did mean that I limited my alcohol intake to a glass of wine. That delicious red came from a shared and well priced bottle of Cabernet Franc. I passed on the great looking Templeton Rye (from Iowa!) Side Cars and was intrigued as talk then centered around similar specialty whiskeys such as Whistlepig.  The food was great too. Everyone else at the Table went for the Burger, which unfortunately I passed on as I had already filled up before and during the party. My Bad. However, I was just fine as I happily munched on the Brussels Sprout Chips and Brussels Sprout Hearts (sauteed with lemon and cheese).   So there you go. When you put together a nice venue, great conversation, and good food, it's an experience that bears repeating.",

The food is fantastic, the service was on point and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We started with the deviled eggs, the brussel sprout chips, the burrata and pepper tart and the sunchokes. All were very good. I had the pork chop as my entree. It was very good as well. My only minor complaint there is that it was a little fatty. I would have liked a slightly leaner piece of meat. It was cooked very well though. We order one of each of the sides (twice cooked potato, brussel sprouts, spinach, broccolini and french fries). I could not stop eating the french fries. They were SO good. Extra crispy but still moist on the inside. Delicious! For dessert we had the smore and the birthday cake. The birthday cake was cute because they brought it out with a candle in it. The smore was good, but not the best I've ever had. This was a business dinner, so I didn't have to pay for it personally, but I can imagine it would get pricey for a date night. I think it's definitely worth the splurge every once in a while though. I would definitely come back.",

    "review_text": "My first impression of this place: why the heck is it so freaking cold in here? It's a tavern, isn't it? Isn't a tavern the traditional place you go to shelter from the cold? I mean yikes, I never took off my jacket or scarf. I know restaurants make it colder because that makes you want to eat more, but I just felt sort of chilled the whole time I was there.   I really liked the way their menu was organized (smoked, fried, marinated, tomatoes, etc). And there were lots of choices, whatever your craving was. I especially loved the heirloom tomato and burratta dish, presented on a very cool piece of slate. I thought all the dishes were presented so beautifully, and came out at a great pace. Our server was lovely, and it seemed all the people around us were lovely, too (tables are kind of close together, it got hard not to eavesdrop). Everything was delicious, and I encourage anyone to try their chocolate creme brulee with chili and lime. Very unique, with great flavors.   Still, I'm not sure I was down with the atmosphere. In addition to being chilly in the front table section, the place was very loud and around 8pm, they dimmed the lights. This might have created a nicer vibe if we hadn't been ordering, as the print on their menu was seriously as small as they could possibly make it and the space was already kind of dark before the mandated dimming. Also, it seems like they went to a lot of trouble to fit their massive wine list on one page of paper, which made it extremely difficult to read (even for the folks at the table with perfect vision).  The location is prime, and it was nice to take a walk around the neighborhood after our meal, so I think I would rather come back here during the day. Maybe it wouldn't be so damn cold inside then, and I would be able to read the menu without the squinting.",

We were a four top, and spent $240 on wine, 3 apps, and main courses for four. Hard to talk across the table with the noise. LOTS of looking going on, attractive people. Waiter acted like he was sure we knew he was good, but couldn't get bread on the table, candle lit, silverware didn't make sense, all done by rote, timing was very off, and no thought applied. But the food... must try the brussel sprout chips, fabulous. The \"Demons on Horseback\" are heavily sold, but honestly, shrimp with a little fat and veges, didn't impress me. Deviled eggs are hard NOT to like, these were actually good. Two of us had the pork chop, a disaster of odd misses. Oversalted, HIGHLY oversalted, \u00a0long leaf spinach, mixed in with turnips that were rubbery, (honestly, couldn't cut them with the knife), and chunks of bacon, square cut, but TOUGH, along with a butterflied pork chop, (really, the only reason to do that is to hurry up the cooking). But the meat WAS tasty, mostly due to the high level of fat on the chop, \u00a0in a delicious reduction. Rubbery scallops, (same word 2x), but in a nice sauce on as skewer. The other entree was the tuna, not memorable. Chef friend of mine, also said he had a terrible meal, accented by really lacking service.  When restaurants get hot, they just get frantic, and forget how to keep up the ideas and effort that all DO work, and they go for the turnover, and hope to be successful being formulaic without good management. This is one of those spots. You have to go to see the buzz, but PLEASE, rate it right, forget the hype!",

    "review_text": "I made a reservation for Brunch four days prior. I wanted to choose a nice / fancy-ish place for my best friend's birthday and we have been eyeballing Park Tavern for a long time.   First off, this place has a really nice and warm ambiance about it. The circular light fixtures with yellow bulbs, large sofa seating, large open windows, and exposed wooden structure is only part of the reason why I fell in love with the interior of this restaurant. Secondly, the service is on point. They are filling my water to the brim constantly as I am drinking it and our waiter was super funny and patient with us. (C'mon, we are three kids at a fancy-ish restaurant, you can only imagine).  So here we being with our \"fancy-ish\" meal: 1. Jam Jelly Baguette - The baguette was extremely crunchy and chewy. The variety of jams included: cranberry, blueberry, orange and butter. The orange one was my favorite. It was the first time I've had an orange jam where it wasn't too sour nor sweet, it was right in between and it was delicious.  2. Dungeonous Crab Toast - They packed a thick layer of crab on top of a lightly toasted white bread. The white bread was light and thin and crunchy on the outside, I actually didn't like how the crab overpowered the bread.  3. Farm Eggs - Nice presentation. Baked with 10% eggs on top of 90% spinach. Fair taste, not too salty but couldn't taste the eggs.  4. Smoked Salmon Benedict - Packed with a strong tasting salmon. Tasted like capers to me. The egg wasn't as runny as I had hoped.   5. Cod Sandwich - Perfectly cooked. Seasoned marvelously. Smelled amazing. \u00a0Amazing potato chunks. Delicious.   I would have to say that the food did not impress me. Everything somehow came out to be too salty or not salty enough. I felt like the food was way overpriced for what it is. But the service was amazing and the ambiance is beyond comfortable. Maybe the dinner option might have a better chance of winning me over.",

The food was compelling enough to distract us from bachelorette mayhem. \u00a0My faves:  - Crispy lemon chips with burrata: Just genius. \u00a0I thought a slice of lemon, dredged in rice flour, and fried in rice oil would still be bitter (given the pith) but it was uh-maaaaazing! \u00a0Someone get me a bag of those chips now! - Poulet noir: Others were not so impressed, but this was a creeper dish for me. \u00a0The more I ate, the more I realized how excellent it was. \u00a0The skin's truffle perfume matched divinely with the moist, tender meat. - Parisienne gnocchi: This dish made me swear and shake my fist. \u00a0Even after numerous attempts, my gnocchi cannot compare to those light, silky pillows. \u00a0Fucking bastards. \u00a0Cotogna's gnocchi has now been shoved into second place. - And while not as mind-blowing as the above, the brussel sprout chips, roasted chioggia beets, lamb croquettes, and variations of duck were solid and drool-worthy in their own right. \u00a0The beets were plated like a gorgeous, smattering of jewels. - Mary Etta's Bubbles and Washington Square were very refreshing.  - Finally, deviled eggs: everyone else's eyes rolled back in their heads. \u00a0But as an oenophobe, I can't comment.  I wasn't as impressed with the leafy salads, halibut, jerky (I don't think this is a worthy expression of Wagyu), the squash soup du jour, strawberry-rhubarb shortcake, nor banana split.  Service was impeccable (aside from the initial resistance to seating 7 people). \u00a0Valet at $12 was totally worth it. \u00a0And our waiter was terrific. \u00a0 He comped us a scoop of chocolate ice cream with cocoa nibs. \u00a0 And he was such a good sport with our bachelorette game of dares...poor guy is probably still trying to remove all the pink feathers.",

Service was very good, nice interior, and the atmosphere was lively and festive. \u00a0The menu had good gluten-free options. \u00a0I would consider going back and trying some of the meat entrees next time.",

The fruity and bubbly Mary Etta's Bubbles with raspberry flavors was right up my alley and a nice homage to Mrs. Moose ($11). \u00a0  6) \u00a0Order two bowls of the Brussels Sprout Chips.  Because once you've tried these warm, crisp, salty, and lemony \"chips,\" you will immediately want more! \u00a0($7).  7) \u00a0Order the infamous Deviled Eggs. \u00a0  At first, we didn't receive them for some reason but they were worth the wait. \u00a0Topped with bacon and minced jalapenos, these savory bites will convert even the most staunch deviled egg hater ($2 each). \u00a0(Plus they were graciously comped due to the mix up.) \u00a0  8) \u00a0Next time order more appetizers and fewer entrees.  The disappointingly gritty Mussels, Cockles, and Clams came in a too salty for me tomato broth ($21). \u00a0However, the Diva loved her Scallops dish with Butter Beans and Sausage ($28) and the Better Half liked his hefty Pork Chop ($27).  9) \u00a0Save room for desserts (note the plural).  The May's Birthday Cake was a gorgeous cake layered with raspberry cream cheese and raspberry buttercream and topped with a lighted candle ($9). \u00a0Fun! \u00a0We were less enamored by the \"It's It\" as it was a scoop of chocolate covered mint ice cream and salty and sparse oatmeal cookie sprinkles ($8). \u00a0The rhubarb addicted Better Half scarfed down his Strawberry and Rhubarb Shortcake in short order ($8). \u00a0  10) \u00a0When the Diva declares this the best meal of the trip, think \"Mission Accomplished!\"",

They split it for me and my friend as an app. We also split the green goddess salad, which was just ok. (Fresh parsley was the only flavor that popped; chicharrones were soggy and one of them way too spicy compared to the rest.) \u00a0  Then we split the poulet noir chicken. Cool presentation, moist &amp; delicious. Beware: it comes whole and you carve it yourself. Gasp! I dig that, but imagine a lot of foofy people would balk it. Relax, the pieces come apart easily with a little knife work, and you can impress a date with your skillz.  Good wines by the glass. Hostess and servers had upbeat attitudes without being fake &amp; annoying. Overall reasonably priced. Crowd seemed like mostly locals, which is refreshing in north beach. Packed on a Monday nite is a good sign that this place will last in a notoriously high turnover location.",

Our group ordered the following appetizers:  Deviled eggs - awesome smokey flavor, a must have! Brussel sprout chips - really taste. Takes a healthy food and makes it into a lovely snack that is sinfully crispy and salty. Smoked fish dip - a bit underwhelming, leave this to your Jewish deli Lemon &amp; basil leaf burrata - the burrata is like any you've had before. The draw here are the awesome lemon chips for dipping! Charcuterie board: definitely underwhelming. Leave it to a charcuterie/salumeria  For dinner we ordered: The roasted chicken which is served on a cast iron sticking up in the air and very juicy. It was a delight. The creekstone steak. Buttery and soft, the sauce was lovely too but the steak lacked a deep meaty flavor.  Would go back - very fun restaurant with friends.",

    "review_text": "I can't help but feel that Park Tavern is coasting. Kind of getting-away-with-it and laughing all the way to the bank.  Not that it's bad. It's not bad at all.. but it's a premium priced establishment which 'only' offers good food.  PT seems to have reached that critical mass of popularity at that price point of which restauranteurs must dream - it's always packed, and judging by the crowd it's a Destination eatery in the city at the weekend for bridges and tunnels folks.  What you get:  - Location: On Washington Square, so it looks kind of pretty but parking is a disaster unless you valet. - Great space (think classic NYC brasserie feel) - Without a reservation, probably 45mins-1 hour wait. Although there is bar seating and a first come, first served communal table which is a nice touch. - Menu: modern Californian, with a few nice twists. I like the brunch menu the best, and specifically the polenta cakes with mushrooms, avocado toasts and pastries. The famous 'Marlowe Burger' is also well thought of by the burger-eating community.  - The Bloodies are worth checking out. As a beer person, I'm always disappointed with the draft selection - but then, it's not really their thing. Wine list is fine.  My issue is one of price and consistency. If the service and food was consistently excellent, I would feel like PT was about 15% overpriced but I'd still come back once in a while especially if I lived nearby, or wanted a boozy brunch in a nice space - possibly for a birthday or something. But the fact is they have consistency issues - the service can get surprisingly sloppy when it gets really busy (which it often does), and for a premium price you do expect the food to be on-the-money every time (which it isn't) - soggy burger buns, overcooked eggs have been served up to my party more than once.  Exec Summary: You can do better for the money.",

Hostess told us to wait since there are no tables available even though when we looked around there were a couple of tables free. Went to the bar and grabbed couple of cocktails which sounded interesting. It came almost devoid of alcohol. 15 mins go by and no one has sat in any of the tables, so we went up to her and told her it's past 10pm. She then said \"oh, I was actually looking for you\". Surprising considering she was standing there the whole time clearly not looking for anyone and we were a foot away from her the entire time. Fine whatever.  Sat down. We were actually excited since we live in the neighborhood and finally someone has opened a decent looking place with what seems like a good bar scene. \u00a0  We usually are price insensitive when going to restaurant's food and cocktails. But this restaurant takes the cake. The bread given to us albeit tasty was stale. \u00a0I ordered the uni for an appetizer which was a big mistake, it was more like lettuce with a taste of uni. A quarter of an uni was divided by six, so it looked more like dots on top of lettuce. Having worked with the restaurant industry in New York, this was really insulting. \u00a0My husband ordered the burger and his fries were fried to a crisp that it just tasted like oil. My scallops were good, but again for the price you'd think you're eating at french laundry except you will actually be full at french laundry. We skipped on dessert after that meal. When we looked around us, the table of 3 to our left is sharing one side dish. And to our right, a group of 6 girls, didn't order alcohol and had 2 burgers between them. That means the place is too pricey for the hood.   The only thing they really have going for them is the ambiance and the fact that they look over the park. After we got the bill, all alcohol we ordered had hidden charges on them so a cocktail really came out to $14-16. If you want to get robbed and lied to, go to this place!",

I had been there a few times when it was Moose's, and hadn't been back in the neighborhood since... that's what a toddler will do to your social life.... in any case, we ended up in bar seating, which was fine by me, but wtf is up with people who continue to elbow you once, not twice, but multiple times during your meal? seriously dude in plaid shirt who probably works in some douchebaggy industry... NOT cool.   Anyhoo. Service was brisk and friendly, but I guess the idea of a bowl of Brussels Sprouts 'chips' is not that amazing to someone who makes kale chips on a regular basis....   scallops were decent, dessert (i think it was a creme brulee?) was decent but not amazing.",

    "review_text": "I came here with some people from my firm as a work dinner and I am so happy that my firm partner chose this restaurant. \u00a0Our 4+ hours there were so amazing and I cannot wait til I can come here again with the bf.  As soon as I sat down, I ordered the Moscow Mule. \u00a0It's a bit stronger here than I'm used to but still good. \u00a0Their drink menu looks very extensive though so I'll be sure to order something else next time.  We had the much raved-about Deviled Eggs, half with bacon and half without for the vegetarians on our table. \u00a0I don't know if it was the bacon but these were so damn delicious. \u00a0I loved that it had a little kick from the smoked jalapenos.  The Brussels Sprout Chips surprised the entire table - who knew that baked vegetables can be so darn good? \u00a0It has inspired me to turn every vegetable in my fridge into a chip with the use of olive oil, salt, pepper, and an oven.  The Lemon Chips with Burrata were okay. \u00a0They fried the lemon peel with it so you get a slight bitter taste but it was a refreshing dish. \u00a0I'd rather pick the sprout chips.  The table forced me to pick another appetizer so I asked our waiter what he recommended. \u00a0He responded PT Fries and he promised it would be amazing. \u00a0I have to say, I was very hesitant because how amazing can fries be? \u00a0Yeah well, they can be pretty amazing if you fry them in flavorful truffle oil. \u00a0I'm talking about truffle that you can taste, not like other restaurants that call their regular french fries \"truffle fries.\" \u00a0On the side was a cracked soft boiled egg with caviar inside, which not only made the dish visually appealing but enhanced the flavor of the truffle oil. \u00a0There's also sauce on the side, which I think was some kind of aioli, most likely garlic. \u00a0In any event, you don't need it - the fries are perfect as they are.  The boss wanted the Butter Lettuce Wedge to take a break from all the fried and heavy foods. \u00a0The fennel vingaigrette made it a great refresher.  Some people at our table really liked the Cool Roasted Cauliflower but I did not, mainly because of the bellpepper sauce (romesco) the cauliflower laid on. \u00a0I'm not a fan of bellpepper so that's that for this dish.  The boss ordered the Scallops and she was very satisfied with it. \u00a0I had a taste and it was just okay for me. Someone else ordered the Sea Bass, which was really good. \u00a0The fish was so soft and juicy it melted in our mouths.  I, being a red meat fan, ordered the CAB NY Steak. \u00a0For all of you who are immediately captured by the words \"bone marrow,\" just be aware that it's fried kobe beef stuffed back in the bone. \u00a0In other words, you're not going to get the creamy, full-flavored deliciousness that is bone marrow. \u00a0Trust me, I found out the hard way. \u00a0But that is not to say that it wasn't delicious. \u00a0It's creative and it was flavorful (though the flavor and texture reminded me a bit of corned beef) but it's kind of a waste to fry perfectly good bone marrow. \u00a0The NY steak was done perfectly to my liking - medium rare. \u00a0You get two pieces, though I did not need that much since I was popping out of my buttons by this point. \u00a0The broccolini and crispy potatoes were also done well.  Though dessert seemed ill-advised and impossible, we still manned up and ordered an Apple Cheddar Crisp and the Chocolate Creme Brulee. \u00a0The apple cheddar crisp is really the way to go. \u00a0You get ice cream on top of a warm apples with a hint, but not too noticeable, of cheddar. \u00a0The creme brulee was a little burnt on the top so we tasted some bitterness but even if it wasn't, I don't think it would've been anything amazing.  All in all, we had a great time. \u00a0We enjoyed our servers a lot (they were all very accommodating and didn't mind when we sat at the bar longer than we needed to) and the food was terrific.",

Facing Washington Square, the restaurant is in a prime location. \u00a0The interior is hip and clean and I dig the white floor tiles. \u00a0You can see the entire kitchen and the waiting staff is friendly and helpful.  The must eats: deviled eggs (probably the best I have ever had AND they are topped with bacon), burrata with lemon chips, and the poulet rouge. \u00a0The chicken is somewhat disturbing in its presentation and is sitting upright, waiting for you to slice it and eat it. \u00a0It made me guilty to be a carnivore but it was so tasty. \u00a0The cocktails are good and strong, especially the Ed Negroni.  The deviled eggs take the cake though and I could have ate them all night. \u00a0I want some right now! \u00a0The lemon chips are innovative and I'm hoping they catch on as a great dried fruit that can be purchased in stores.",

We came here for dinner on a Tuesday night (made the reservation about an hour before so they were really good about getting us in). We got there and were seated at a small 2-person table extremely close to the surrounding tables on either side of us; however, it wasn't awkward or too close for comfort. I don't know how they manage to pull that off, but they did. Props, Park Tavern.  We ordered: 1. Brussels sprout chips - 3 stars. They were good but extremely salty. 2. Devolved egg - 5 stars. BOMB! The pickled jalape\u00f1o made it. 3. Salad - 4 stars. I can't remember the exact name of it but it was a simple salad with avocado and a nice vinaigrette. 4. Burger - 3 stars. The meat was cooked well (we ordered medium rare) but there was way too much sauce/aioli on the burger. I like my meat plain and it sort of overpowered the burger. Ask for it on the side next time.  5. Porkchop - 5 stars. Dank. Rivals the pork chop from The House. This one is more traditional and served with Parmesan risotto and root vegetables.  No dessert so can't vouch for that but the ones that the table to the left of us ordered (approximately 5 inches away) looked great.  I'll be back but not for the infamous burger. It's better at Marlowe and I think there are much better burger options around the city.",

Once the food started coming out things got much better. \u00a0Between the three of us, we sampled the deviled eggs, the lemon chips with burrata and the beef jerky. \u00a0After overdosing on the burrata, we decided to simply take the jerky with us when we left. \u00a0  I had the halibut, which was amazing, but as reviewer Gwynnie P mentions, everything is drenched in butter, including my piece of fish. \u00a0Not that I mind butter, but wow. \u00a0My hons of husband had the duck four ways,which was killer. \u00a0Duck confit, slices of breast, pate and crispy skin. \u00a0Sister ended up with the salmon, which was another fantastic piece of fish.

If it was a Friday or Saturday night I would not have minded waiting a half hour but it was Sunday at 8pm. \u00a0I ended up calling back and they said to just come in and they would seat us as soon as they could. \u00a0Upon arrival we were seated within 10 minutes which I appreciated. \u00a0We had a fantastic server (I wish I could remember his name) and all 3 of us loved our dinners. \u00a0We started with the brussel sprout chips which I personally think are overrated but they certainly didn't taste bad. \u00a0Just greasy and overpriced. \u00a0I had the Poulet Noir which was very flavorful.

Overall, I love the decor and vibe of this place and think the service is fantastic. \u00a0But giving it 4 stars as opposed to 5 because of some of the food items (just not worth 5 stars) and for what you get for your money. I think I may go back and just sit at the bar and get the burger. \u00a0If I did that every time I'm pretty sure it would be a solid 5 stars!",

The pork chop is one my favorite entrees for flavor and portion size. This thing could easily feed two people! Don't forget the classics that they've brought from their first restaurant, Marlowe, like the brussel sprout chips, the Marlowe burger, and the truffle fries.  If you're there for drinks only then sit at the bar or the community table which serves as an extension to the bar and allows visitors to eat too. You can eat at the bar too but the table allows you to sit face-to-face with your friends, etc.  This is and will always be one of my favorite go-to spots in town!",

    "review_text": "Disappointing. \u00a0Went with in a group of six, we had reservations. \u00a0The restaurant is beautiful, the cocktails were good, and some of the food we ordered was good. \u00a0But much of it was overpriced and poorly executed. \u00a0  Our server was okay but bad about taking drink orders. \u00a0When we ordered our first round they took a long time to arrive, and this was true for every round we ordered. \u00a0The bar area is busy and the drinks are creative so I understand that it takes time to put them together, but it's important to get drinks on the table and keep them there when a party is seated for dinner. \u00a0Our server was not prompt about taking our drink orders when our drinks were empty or near-empty, and at one point took the drink orders of the rest of the table but not mine. \u00a0The drinks were so slow in arriving that there was a time between courses when the entire table of six had finished their cocktails, the empty glasses had been cleared, and we were without drinks (or food) for a good fifteen minutes. \u00a0It's very unusual to sit at an upscale restaurant mid-meal with nothing but water glasses on the table for so long.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers, some of which were okay, but when we asked the waiter for a recommendation for a vegetable appetizer he recommended the raw vegetable plate. \u00a0I expected something more creative than the unseasoned carrots, cucumber, radishes, and dip that arrived. \u00a0My first thought when it arrived was that it must be unbelievably cheap for the restaurant to prepare but very profitable. \u00a0I couldn't help but wonder if the waiter was instructed to recommend the dish because of the margin. \u00a0I'm still shocked it's actually on the menu (not to mention that it was recommended), because it was essentially the equivalent of veggies and spinach dip. \u00a0  One other thing about the appetizers--they came out very quickly. \u00a0Too quickly. \u00a0As though they were all sitting somewhere pre-prepared and had just been loaded onto plates when the order came in, rather than made to order.  I should have learned my lesson about taking recommendations from our waiter, but I couldn't decide between entrees. \u00a0I asked the server whether I should order the tuna or the sturgeon and he recommended the sturgeon, so I went with it. \u00a0It was a huge mistake. \u00a0It arrived cold and bland, with an unpleasant chalky taste. \u00a0The accompaniment didn't add much, as it came with sad looking vegetables in the exact same sauce that had been on one of our appetizers.   Someone at my table ordered the scallops and offered me one when she noticed I wasn't eating my fish (although she noticed this, the waiter did not). \u00a0The scallop had sand in it. \u00a0Someone else ordered the burger, which was good but not spectacular. \u00a0The truffle fries were very good, the Brussels sprouts were good but not particularly unique, and a prawn appetizer we ordered was very good but mostly because it was cooked in bacon fat. \u00a0The deviled eggs were okay, but I've had better at Wayfare Tavern.  All in all I had the impression that the restaurant's mission is not to make excellent food and provide a high quality dining experience, but to do its best imitation of doing so to earn as much money as possible to pay for that enormous, beautiful space on Washington Square Park. \u00a0When I first walked in I was struck by it and commented on how they could have possibly afforded it. \u00a0I guess it's by recommending the veggies and dip.",

However, I do have two complaints about my experience, although they didn't really alter the enjoyability of my experience. First off, I have to recommend that the staff take down their \"foodie\" knowledge. I enjoy a waiter who knows what he's talking about, but ours came off as a bit snobby. Also, the 'birthday cake' dessert I ordered was very, very dry. It almost tasted as if it had been left out overnight. Other than those two blemishes, I enjoyed my dinner there.",

While this place looks like the kind of dimly-lit bar your pa or grandpa might frequent (complete with soft-rock soundtrack, at least on the night we visited), the menu's all inventive and modern. Crispy, salty lemon chips pair up with fava been puree for an appetizer that's cooly creative. A seasonal seafood plate aims to boot charcuterie off your plate and and back to 2009. The corn soup is surprisingly creamy and flavorful, and perfect to go alongside something fresh and fishy. And the only thing stopping me from calling the deviled eggs \"divine\" at this point is my desire to avoid too much cloying alliteration in this paragraph.   It's the kind of place that makes you feel guilty for ordering a burger, but since I come from an amoral, bohemian-type background, I was able to move past these feelings and do it anyway. And it was good. So good that my dining partners found themselves straying from their fascinating entrees and stealing my fries.   The only thing I wouldn't order again was the squash blossoms (which may be off the menu now anyhow). Skimpy portions, not ideal for sharing, which you definitely want to do when the food's this tasty. I'd rather have like, 5 more bacon-topped deviled eggs. So good!",

    "review_text": "A MUCH Anticipated Opening...  As a huge fan of Marlowe, I was excited when I found out Park Tavern would be opening its doors on September 1st. As the sister restaurant to Marlowe, I have to say Park Tavern is definitely the \"big\" sister with its larger, sophisticated space and what I thought to be a more refined American bistro menu (there are some parallel items) complete with cocktails.   On Sunday, 10.16.11, my friend and I came for an early dinner at 5:30 pm (with reservations) and were promptly seated.   F O O D *BRUSSELS SPROUT CHIPS ($6) - 4.5 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pWX0F9mi_VlN1IAxweSQ?select=UC9h6h6p3P53R7cuCYcTxg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pW\u2026</a> Aside from the Marlowe Burger, the Brussels Sprout Chips is what Marlowe is known for. It's crispy, salty and citrusy; simply ADDICTING! Just get it.  *YELLOW DOLL WATERMELON, PROSCUITTO, TRUFFLE &amp; MUSTARD GREENS ($12) - 4 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pWX0F9mi_VlN1IAxweSQ?select=1A--nFZxr3yI4GLTXa0d-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pW\u2026</a> A refreshing start to dinner, the sweet watermelon was a nice contrast to the salty prosciutto with the mustard greens adding a subtle bitterness.  *PETIT \"POULET ROUGE\" w/ Bloomsdale Spinach &amp; Peewee Potatoes ($23) - 4 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pWX0F9mi_VlN1IAxweSQ?select=EAyjMl8SaHq7HxsbVj9BCQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pW\u2026</a> Flawlessly cooked, the hen's skin was crisp and the meat was succulently moist and tender. Even the breast was moist and could easily be mistaken for the thigh meat. Well-seasoned, the hen was rich in flavor with a light kick. The condensed meaty flavor from the accompanying au jus gave it that extra oomph. The bloomsdale spinach was slightly charred which gave a smoky component while the fluffy as clouds peewee potatoes added a subtle sweetness. A perfectly balanced dish!  Though I thoroughly enjoyed this dish, I would not recommend ordering it on a date unless you want to scare your date off with your lack of proper dining etiquette. The poulet rouge arrives whole and you have to carve it yourself, though it's much easier to eat it caveman style. I plead the 5th on what approach I took. So again, don't order this dish unless you're totally comfortable with your date or if your date is Fred Flintstone.   S E R V I C E Professional, friendly, and attentive (different from my experiences at Marlowe). The hostesses were welcoming, our waitress always had a smile on her face and the busboys were on their game making sure our water glasses were always filled and plates were promptly taken away.  My biggest gripe is that our entrees took a while to come out and the restaurant wasn't busy at the time.  A M B I A N C E / D E C O R Vintage meets modern chic with grey tile and red brick walls, open kitchen, communal table, wooden drop candle chandelier, black/white photos and large mirrors.   Park Tavern is a much larger space than Marlowe (~3 times larger) and more sophisticated with an older crowd. The sidewalk seating is perfect for people watching at Washington Square Park.  Overall, it's a great place to bring out-of-towners.   P A R K I N G Difficult street parking.

Brussel Sprout Chips-Super addicting.   $2 each for Deviled eggs-Now that is pricey, but so worth it. Very good and it comes with bacon and pickled jalapeno.  Venison Carpaccio with angus beef tartar and crispy bone marrow-I wasn't sure about eating raw venison, but it was very fresh and good flavors. The beef tartar was excellent. Very well seasoned. They give you little bite size fried bone marrow. That just hit the spot!  Scallops w/ tempura mushrooms-delish. They give you about 6 to 8 pieces. Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Steak-now this is what a steak is suppose to look like. Not no cold chewy messed up meat (See Radius review). N.Y steak that was prefectly cooked. 2 square pieces that had so much flavor and it melts in your mouth. Came with kobe beef stuffed bone marrow. That was amazing. It was like beef jerky! There was a big crispy potato and even mash potatos. The broccolini was a good touch to all that meat. DROOL!!!",

Yea, now you want to run there and grab some too right?!?!  My seared black cod was super delicious, cooked just right where the meat stayed together but was fork tender. It was pretty funny how the restaurant had 2 sets of customers. The older crowd seated in the dining area and the younger crowd hanging around the common table and bar.

Walking home the other day from work on a bright and sunny day I realized as I passed Park Tavern I had yet to be in to the highly acclaimed \"new\" spot in the hood. I felt like a disgraced North Beacher thinking that I hadn't made my rounds to one of the newest editions in the hood. So I stopped, turned around and walked inside.   The bar is well lit but not overly bright, with just enough mood lighting to make any drink look sexy. Though small in size, I was able to navigate the area and find a stool right up front in the heat of the action (just the way I like it) and upon touchdown met two of the nicest bartenders I've ever encountered. Upon their recommendations I started with the Brussel Sprout Chips (to die for!), the deviled eggs (even better!) and ended with the beef tartar (holy cow, blew my mind away fantastic). Washed all down with the Country Lawyer and I do believe you've made me a loyal fan.  Thanks gentlemen for the lovely evening...",

The food, on the other hand, was fair..about the same as sister restaurant Marlowe..overrated, and just on the border of being reasonably priced for the neighborhood... but at least the menu was more diverse. \u00a0I would say maybe we ordered the wrong things, but given that one of us at the table was pregnant, we basically ordered everything. \u00a0  The brussel sprout chips a la Marlowe are the same, crispy at the top, oily on the bottom. \u00a0The clam fritters were more fritter than clam, though the corn salad, fresh corn hushpuppies and grilled avocados that came with the clams were AWESOME. \u00a0The sardine toast was ok...good portion and a good balance of salty, sweet, and umami flavors. \u00a0A little sweet for my taste, but my wife thought they were the bee's knees! The squash blossom salad was ok, though the ricotta stuffed squash blossoms were fried to the point that i didn't actually recognize or taste the squash. \u00a0  As for the main course, I had the seafood soup which was really disappointing. \u00a0All the seafood in it (literally everything) was overdone and a bit rubbery. \u00a0The soup itself was overly vinegary. \u00a0My wife loved the corn soup. \u00a0  As for dessert, we got the coconut birthday cake and the almond pear crumble with cinnamon ice cream. \u00a0Nothing worth noting aside from the cinnamon ice cream being so cinnamon-y it blew out my taste buds for everything else. \u00a0  I would try it again, if only for the great service...and hope that maybe it was an off night....",

We ordered a variety of appetizers ranging from gnocchi, carrot salad, corn soup, PT fries, fruit de mers, and demons on horseback. \u00a0Overall the appetizers were good and probably worthy of coming back for. \u00a0For entree, fish, poulet noir, pork chop, burger and duck. \u00a0The portion on the duck was small and my brother said it was on the salty side. \u00a0My dad's pork chop wasn't good, he left half of it on the plate. \u00a0The fish, I forgot what kind of fish, was decent but on the salty side. \u00a0The burger which is supposedly the best burger in town is not the best burger in town. \u00a0What was most disappointing were the fries that came on the side. \u00a0There were probably twelve pieces of fries, as if half the order was missing. \u00a0The poulet noir, had a good truffle aroma but that's about it. \u00a0It's a small piece of chicken, the greens on the bottom were swimming in oil which isn't exactly enticing.  We ordered the birthday cake since it was my mom's birthday and let's just say we were glad that wasn't our actual birthday cake.  When the bill came, we noticed a bottle of wine for $42 which we didn't order. \u00a0The waiter apologized and said he gave us the wrong bill but you know what, everything that was on bill was ours except for the bottle of wine. \u00a0I don't know if he was trying to pull a fast one or made a mistake but that was definitely our bill unless another table had exactly the same things we had which seems unlikely. \u00a0  I would say it was somewhat of an average experience. \u00a0I want our mom's birthday dinner to be great but it was well short of that. \u00a0We asked for more bread plates since they took ours away and they never came back with it. \u00a0It seemed the dishes came out quickly, maybe a bit too quickly. \u00a0I may come back for the PT fries but that's about it.",

She complied, but then without stating that there would be an extra charge for a few slices of cucumber, placed a $3 charge on the tab. We did not mind the charge as much as the absurdity of it, and the fact that it was not communicated. The manager came over to check on things after the meal, and after we calmly explained all - including the fact that we are locals - she stated that it was policy and that we had to understand that the restaurant had \"very high food costs\".

Overall, my husband and I left saying that we would have rather eaten at Absinthe. \u00a0I think the comparison came from the fact that they're both \"California-French bistros\" in both look and menu. \u00a0But PT, because of its size (not terribly cozy) and a couple of flaws, came in second place for us.  Let's eat, shall we?  Deviled eggs: \u00a0Yep, these are pretty f*cking delicious. \u00a0Zero complaints here except that our dinner kind of peaked too early.  Lemon chips with burrata: \u00a0I defended this dish not because it blew my socks off flavorwise but because I've never had anything like it. \u00a0Its very light and perhaps not the best pairing with the deviled egg-flavor bombs.  Brussel sprout chips: \u00a0Solid. \u00a0  Crab and lobster bisque: \u00a0The first 3 bites of this soup were orgasmic. \u00a0The remainder was more of a struggle-- its a VERY rich, flavorful soup. \u00a0I literally don't think I could finish this bowl on my own. \u00a0  Rabbit and lardo terrine: \u00a0At first too simple, but actually when you mix all the components on the dish (er, slab of slate)-- mustard and spicy arugula-- it elevated it. \u00a0I could have used some kind of a cracker type thing to go with.  \"Marlowe\" burger: \u00a0This is where you really lost us, PT. \u00a0THE BUN WAS NOT GOOD. \u00a0Like, really, I'm not even being picky. \u00a0Its just a bad bun. \u00a0Crumbly and dry with no give, it really ruined the burger. \u00a0My husband has had the Marlowe at Marlowe and he says their bun was 100x better. \u00a0The burger was good but I couldn't tell because I was so angered by the bun. \u00a0The fries on the other hand, made me very happy.  May birthday cake (cappuccino): Tasted like refrigerator. \u00a0Kind of like, supermarket cake with half the sugar and better frosting. \u00a0Love the idea though!

The only reason I remember our waiter is because he kind of looked like Mark Zuckerberg, but I don't remember his name because he never introduced himself and only came back to take our order and ask us if we wanted more booze, in passing like he couldn't even make a full stop. For real?  2) Can you say pretentious? I did about 12 times while seated on the patio watching the other patrons arrive in their maserati's wearing micro mini skirts and bandeau tops grasping the shoulders of the people they were meeting and pulling them in for air kisses saying \"bisoux bisoux!\" I kid you not. This ain't Beverly Hills, lady, take a pill.  3) The food was honestly nothing to write home about. I don't know if it had to do with the rush the kitchen was in, but my pan-seared sole looked great and the fish itself was cooked well, but the flavor was just not hitting the mark for me. The veggies that came on the plate were good, but the sauce tasted like whipped mustardy hollandaise and mayo and I ended up avoiding it a little. The BFs roasted halibut was much better, but made me realize that maybe we're very gifted chefs, as it wasn't in any way better than what we make at home. I think it would have been more enjoyable served on top of a warm salad, and once again, the sauce was a little mustardy or tart, why? The PT fries were very good, the caviar in a soft boiled egg is an idea that we will be using but the horseradish mayo, while cost effective for the kitchen I'm sure, was unoriginal and not particularly enjoyable. My etta's bubbles cocktail was delicious, and paired pretty well with my meal, good job bartender person.  While the flame of my love for this place's brunch menu burns on, I will avoid dinner hour here because it turns into a \"see and be seen\" reality tv sideshow, instead of the upscale but laid back place to get a good meal and take in little Italy, that I described to the BF to get him to give park tavern a try. Overall I think the service and food suffered from a focus on quantity over quality and crowd was too \"chic\" to notice, or maybe didn't care. But we found ourselves disillusioned by the experience :/ Oh well...",

This review, however, is about service, attitude and integrity of those who served us. We intentionally came in about 45 minutes before our reservations and set in the bar area relaxing, waiting for our table, having drinks. We ordered specifically Ketel One Vodka martini. When the martini arrived it was not Kettle One. We did not make a big deal about it but for the next round we insisted on Ketel One. Waitress assured us she will get that drink right and that she placed the order for Kettle One. She went to the bar, talked to the bartender, he took a bottle of Gray Goose made two drinks in a shaker and served us one of the two. WFT? We saw the whole thing and at this point returned the drink back. Did we get a cheerful apology from the bartender? No way! Instead we got a really watered down Ketel One martini with attitude.  Our table was ready only 30 minutes after the time of reservations. When we got to the table our new waitress told us that to comp for the wait she liked to offer us free Brussels sprouts appetizer ($9). We then went to order two more appetizers and a whole chicken ($15+9+28 + 3 martinis +$20 wine). We never tip less than 20% and you would think we spent enough money so that there would not be a need to scheme us for $9 bucks? \u00a0But when the bill arrived the Brussels sprouts app was included. We pointed that out to the waitress and in ONE second she produced a copy of the correct bill. Wow! So this was actually planned? I had many dinners at PT but mainly in the bar area. Never had I experienced this shameless petty scheming and F+++U attitude. Bar scene is fun and sharing a dish in the bar area is OK, but a sit down dinner here again: I'd be worried.",

I really recommend just paying the $12 and valeting your car instead of circling for an hour. You also really need a reservation or you will easily be waiting an hour for a table because this place does get packed.",

Oaxaca cocktail was good...a little smokey. Appetizer demons on horseback [shrimp] arrived cool not at temperature, which killed the flavor. Scallops good, not great. Too much going on with the plate to experience the true flavor of the East Coast Diver Scallops. Broccolini, good but smoke dominated the flavor. Stopped there, not enticed by the desert menu. Check came to over $100 pp. \u00a0Overall, the hospitality was warm, but just another expensive, unmemorable meal prepared in volume by line cooks... Absolutely nothing memorable except the check.",

Great location, the place is amazing inside, very chic and sophisticated at the same time. \u00a0  The food was tasty for the most part, however there were a few misses:  The good: The warm bread rolls, the fried green tomatoes, the brussel sprout chips, the defiled eggs, \u00a0the pork chop (probably one of the best around), and of course the burger. The chicken looked good and tasted good, it was just a project unto itself to eat the thing, and the coconut cake was amazing   The not so good: \u00a0The pork belly bites, usually anything with pork belly is a hit, however all we got was deep fried fat, it was pretty gross. The salads, they tasted ok however they are tiny portions, a few bites and it's all gone.  The table service was fantastic. the front of the house service was fine, just be warned that if you and your dinner party arrive on time and prior to a celebrity (in this case Tyler Florence) you'll only be sat after said celebrity is taken care of...a bit rude, but the food made up for it.

Now next I come I want to try the lemon with burrata and the deviled eggs.  Entrees we both got the pork chop. It was nice an tender and cooked perfectly. They give you a big sized chunk of meat too!  For dessert we got the banana spilt. It was a fun dessert to each together. It comes with peanut butter ice cream, raspberry and chocolet. OH SO GOOD!",

North Beach is a funny one for me because I love the neighborhood and have never had a bad meal there. But the parking is horrendous.  Park Tavern solved that, valet! Love it because I think valet helps raise the expectation a bit and lets you really make your dining choice feel like an occasion.   The decor was lovely but I'm wondering if just a few more noise canceling pieces might help. However, that's really nit-picking because the food was pretty notable that I honestly did not care if the conversation was interesting or not, I just wanted 'one-more-bite'.   Favorite bites were: The Polenta. Hot diggity was it good. Small portion but a good bite doesn't have to be a trough of food. Perfectly crispy on the outside, delicious soft center with very clear flavors.  The Hash. Wow, this is not your average interpretation of hash and 100% better for it. My poached egg was lovely and the corned beef devine. It was a little salty but nothing the acidic greens didn't correct if combined in the bite.   Yum yum yum guys. Yum!",

But the three of us felt the food really fell short. My husband and I each ordered the standing game hen perched on spinach. The hen was moist, but was devoid of flavor, just no wow factor to the dish. Another person in our group had the strip steak, a big disappoinment as the meat was thin and flavorless. The deviled eggs were tasty as were the brussels sprouts chips even tho they were awfully salty. We ordered two desserst,the fig/toffee/cheese plate and the \"almond joy.\" Nowhere had I ever seen such tiny desserts, really just miniscule to the point that we just had to laugh. For the price, the food was mediocre (although well conceived) and the dessert presentation just has to be a joke. With so many restaurant choices in SF, this one will not be on our list again.",

The waiter was super friendly giving personal suggestions and letting us take our time to chat, sip our wine, and review the menu.  Some of the dishes were a hit or a miss, but the apps were all very superb. We had the brussel sprout chips, deviled eggs, and cheese fondue. But the star app was definitely the truffle fries. The fries were accompanied by a soft-cooked egg with caviar as well as an aioli. Yummy gooey delish!  For the main courses, we tried almost everything but the star of the table was the \"poulet noir\" which was a poulet in command on a cast iron pan with onion stuffing below to soak in all the goodness. All that goodness was accompanied by a brown truffle sauce which the waiter poured over the chicken upon service. Yum! If you are a Californian eater, I suggest you split this since it was huge! \u00a0The braised beef short ribs came in as the 2nd most favorite on the table.   For dessert, the buttermilk panna cotta with mandarin wedges, oats, and toasted oats was perfect - not too sweet, deliciously creamy, and very clean and light.   This would be the perfect place for a date or to grab a glass of wine with snacks (highly recommend the truffle fries!) after a long day at work.

Brunch:  Delicious and got to sit outside with a view of Washington square park. \u00a0Had some Stumptown coffee, really interesting 'toast' with sliced avocado on top with sea salt and olive oil (so good!) and some perfectly done poached eggs on some (baked?) polenta. \u00a0Honestly, I was pretty tired, so don't remember too many details besides how yummy it was. \u00a0Also, the dudes next to us ordered lots of cocktails that looked pretty good.   Dinner:  Went with my family for this one, started with a couple of salads (good - not too memorable), but my God was my steak frites (Bar steak?) amazing! Sometimes you just want a good cut of meat and this is the place my friend - steak and fries, no frills, just delicious. \u00a0Be warned though, medium is not that pink. Definitely glad I ordered mine medium rare. \u00a0  We ordered the brussel sprouts on the side for veggies, and these were really good and complemented our steaks perfectly! And for dessert, we were totally caught off guard by how amazing the 'strawberry rhubarb shortcake' was. \u00a0It came in a cast iron pan (small), and was basically strawberry rhubarb pie filling (yum!) with short cake and cream in the corner, and strawberry icecream on the side. \u00a02 weeks later I still dream of this dessert!   Scene:  Valet parking! woot Also - the Bar at night was POPPIN OFF, had to yell across the dinner table to keep the convo going! I also saw these long tables which have full food service (I think) so you can just come by if you're in the area. Definitely will have to come back for an evening out on the town.  Highly recommend this spot, and if you don't find a rez on open table, just try calling!",

    "review_text": "I made a reservation here on *someone's birthday, but then had a little too much fun that day and we ended up missing the reservation. \u00a0So I made another reservation for a Sunday evening to make up for my indiscretions (with an emphasis on the \"s\" at the end of indiscretions). \u00a0And so it goes. \u00a0  We arrived right on time for our reservation at 7:15 p.m. and were promptly seated. \u00a0My companion didn't like the table, however, and we were promptly re-seated with no questions asked. \u00a0In the interest of brevity, I will only note the highlights, as follows. \u00a0  We settled in and got down to business. \u00a0We started with two cocktails - the McLaren and the Aquatic Park. \u00a0We also ordered two appetizers: (1) the deviled eggs; and (2) the Demon on Horseback (shrimp). \u00a0Both were scrumptious, but boy, those deviled eggs were something to write home about -- do you hear me? \u00a0Those flavors were WORKING: Pickled jalapeno, bacon and chive? \u00a0YES, YES and YES. \u00a0  I also want to note right out of the gates that the bread and butter were yummy. \u00a0I love when all of the small details are attended to. \u00a0  For dinner, I ordered the Marlowe Burger, medium. \u00a0The burger was served with caramelized onion, cheddar, bacon and horseradish aioli (plus fries). \u00a0So, let's discuss the bacon. I don't care how trendy it is or is not, I frakking LOVE bacon. \u00a0But this bacon was pretty special because it was cooked so perfectly--crisp, but not crumbly. \u00a0When you took a bite of the sandwich, the bacon remained in tact on the rest of the sandwich, which I frequently find to be the hallmark of finely cooked fare (I am insane about this with onion rings as well - if I take a bite out of an onion ring and the onion comes out of the ring on that bite, it was not cooked properly, in my humble opinion). \u00a0  For dessert, we had a piece of \"September's Birthday Cake,\" which is champagne chiffon cake, pears and mascarpone cheese. \u00a0Oh heavens, I could be very satisfied with a piece of that cake every evening. I didn't get any cake on my birthday - so I feel entitled to go back and have another piece. The whole reason for birthdays is cake, after all. \u00a0  Our server was lovely, attentive and pleasant. I think the evening was pretty successful overall. \u00a0Now, I'm going to need to come back to PT for brunch, obviously. \u00a0And I believe I'm owed a piece of cake. \u00a0Loved it.",

What sweethearts :)  For an appetizer I got the venison carpaccio, which I highly recommend. It was zesty, bold, and not gamey at all. Bone marrow is incorporated into the dish as crispy little nuggets, which I think is more approachable to the average diner than its usual presentation.   As entrees, my friend ordered the duck egg sandwich and I got the fried chicken one. Both were good and I usually don't eat sandwiches since I have a slight aversion to eating bread. I will definitely be back to try their brunch, which has been listed as one of the best the city has to offer.   Outdoor seating was nice, but the inside is exceptionally beautiful - rustic with a modern twist. The lighting is dimly romantic and the place is classy, but extremely welcoming and comfortable as well.",

    "review_text": "Came here with a friend after SFGate alerted me to absolutely nothing going on in the City. It was a Monday after all. I heard Park Tavern was popular, and thought if anything was going on at Washington Square, it would center around the tavern. I had 9pm reservations, but we showed up early and found a spot at the bar. Jake, our bartender, greeted us like we were regulars... his charm and skillful mixology was enough that I abandoned my reservation of an outdoor table in favor on eating on the old Moose's bartop. I thought Gary Danko made a great blood and sand, but this one - served neat with an aromatic orange peel kiss to the sides of the glass - was tops. We had the obligatory deviled eggs and brussels sprout chips (YUM!), and while I ordered the only beef entree on the menu (NY Kobe Steak) my friend ordered the Poulette Noir. One note: it's best to sit at the bar when you order the Poulette Noir, it really does take 30 minutes, and you'll need at least one drink refill before it arrives.  The food was outstanding, but what made the night was Jake. He was soft spoken and cheerful, joining in on jokes and telling us stories about the bar and his travels. We were having so much fun, we actually closed the bar after an impromptu grappa tasting and a particularly tasty bit of cheddar.   For my experience, Park tavern is a place to go alone or with a good friend. Belly up to the bar and find Jake or one of the other skilled bartenders to guide your night.",

Located in the space the formerly housed Moose's and Joey &amp; Eddie's, Park Tavern is the perfect antidote for these uncertain economic times. \u00a0Rather than frou-frou, Park Tavern is solid and simple; it is American food: \u00a0reasonably priced meat and potatoes, not tarted up fris\u00e9e salad with poached organic, free range quail eggs sprinkled with some esoteric salt harvested by blind one-armed nuns on a remote island in Java.  With white tiled floors, dark wood paneling, and nicely dim lighting, the frill-free, the dining room is cozy without detracting from the main event: \u00a0the food. \u00a0Park Tavern is not a place for vegetarians. \u00a0It is a meat-eater's restaurant--the kind of place that makes you want to order steak medium-rare.  The Brussels sprout chips ($6) are so good they will make you forget you are eating a vegetable. \u00a0The \"Marlowe\" burger ($13) served with caramelized onions, cheddar, bacon, horseradish aioli, and fries was tender, juicy, and delicious. \u00a0Moist and tender, the Park Tavern \"poulet rouge\", (AKA Cornish game hen, $22) was served on a upright spit with spinach &amp; Peewee potatoes on the side.   While the food is good, the bar is not far behind. \u00a0High-end, \"mixologist\" cocktails are available, at least six craft brews are on tap, and at least 25 well priced wine selections can be had by the glass or carafe. \u00a0  Service was spot-on. \u00a0Water glasses never went unfilled, dishes arrive with good pacing, and used plates and utensils were quickly removed. \u00a0Servers were knowledgeable about the menu, easily answering questions about ingredients and how dishes were prepared.  With Park Tavern, Weinberg and Puccio have a hit on their hands. \u00a0Grab your reservations before everyone else finds out and you cannot get in.",

I was not that hungry to begin with. My friend's pork I thought could be better. It would have been better if it was marinated in a citrus or vinergette, rather than just the chili rub that it came it. The fattier parts were better though. The corn soup was good, I would recommend it. I liked the oil that was drizzled on top of it. Also, order the gnocchi. It's the best gnocchi I've had.",

My concierge had arranged a reservation at a different restaurant, but my friend's husband was intrigued by the gnocchi here and asked if I could switched the reservation. The restaurant said they were booked for reservations (we were a party of four) until 9 p.m., but that we were welcome to come in and try to snag seats at the communal tables.   \u00a0 We were quoted a 45 minute wait time, which is standard for any decent restaurant at prime dinner time. They have a fantastic cocktail selection and very friendly bartenders. The wine list had a nice list of options as well.   \u00a0 After waiting for an hour, my friend asked the host how much longer it would be. She was told the reservations were running a little behind and it would be another 20 minutes. I understand it's hard to predict when tables will get up but it was getting ridiculous. After two hours, we were sat with no apology. While we certainly could have chosen to leave and go to another restaurant, it was ridiculous.   \u00a0 On to the food. The deviled eggs and gnocchi were well received at the table. Two people got the burger, one got the steak and I had the sole. The sole was very good, the steak got rave reviews, and the burger had lukewarm reactions. Desserts looked delicious.   \u00a0 All in all, the food was very enjoyable, but absolutely not worth a two hour wait. While I would eat here again, I would never try without a reservation or with a large group.",

    "review_text": "Park Tavern is definitely at the top or near the top of our favorite restaurants. Everything from the food, service, ambiance, and location are spot on.  Foods: Brussels Sprout Chips - Love this stuff. Great starter to order and munch on while you wait for the rest of the delicious food to arrive.  Smoked Deviled Eggs - So addicting! You'll definitely want to order more than one!  PT Fries - The perfect crisp-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside fries! Nicely seasoned and a hint of truffle oil? The dipping sauce they serve with it is just fine...but the best part is definitely the soft-boiled egg with caviar. Whoever thought of egg and fries...genius!  Poulet Noir - We've gotten the Poulet Rouge here before which was amazing, and this dish was no different. Don't think we've ever had a chicken that's been cooked so perfectly or so tasty before (other than the Poulet Rouge, of course)!  C.A.B NY Steak - The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Incredibly juicy and well seasoned. The pole beans were delicious as well, but what tied everything together was the red wine jus! The only part of the dish that I was hoping more from was the braised Kobe and bone marrow. The braised Kobe was a tad overdone and a little on the dry side. But...what could've saved it was if there was more bone marrow! It was really tough to identify the buttery, fatty, taste of heaven that we crave in bone marrow.  Desserts: Wood-Fired Roasted Strawberry &amp; Rhubarb Shortcake - Oh my goodness, this was so yummy. The strawberry and rhubarb was cooked down and oh so tasty with the wonderful shortcake and vanilla ice cream!  Afternoon Delight - When a restaurant offers Captain Crunch ice cream, you have to just get it! It was as you would expect, Captain Crunch-y and rich ice cream with a dust of cereal. This was served with a delicious shot of cereal milk cr\u00e8me. (Also eating this with the strawberry and rhubarb shortcake was awesome.)  The service here is always top notch.

    "review_text": "Overhyped. Overpriced.   *Note: This review is for brunch, not dinner.*   I freakin love brunch. It's kind of a problem. I think about it during the week, planning for my next brunch fix. There are few breakfast establishments that miss my scavenging eye. So, when I discovered that Park Tavern had recently begun to serve brunch, I was giddy with excitement. I mean, they serve cocktails in PITCHERS for god's sakes! What could go wrong?  Do not be lured in by their pitchers (although their menu insinuates otherwise, only 2 of their cocktails are offered in this form) or the flawless, if sterile, Restoration Hardware decor. This was a highly average brunch experience. Here's a breakdown:  To Start:  -Sourdough, Dungeness crab &amp; green goddess toast: \u00a0This could have been fabulous! But what was the deal with the toast? Instead of the crunchy, flavorful Tartine-style slices we were hoping for, we received small doughy triangles, already getting soggy from the crab and green goddess on top - kind of like old lady cucumber sandwich bread. Plus the dungeness crab topping was only so-so. You know it's a fail when you think to yourself, \"I could have made this better at home.\"  To Drink:  -PT Bloody Mary: \u00a0 I'm really glad they got this right, otherwise I might have cried. However, these bloody maries are made with a beef broth, which was a sad discovery for my vegetarian sister, who loves bloody maries and couldn't get one here. The \"veggie alternative\" (see below) was such a sad excuse for a cocktail - it should really be taken off the drink menu.  -Bloody Maria: \u00a0 This is usually made with tequila, but my sister asked for hers with vodka to make it more like a classic bloody mary. Unfortunately, nothing could help this drink. \"Grass\" is the first thing that comes to mind when drinking this, and not in a good way. It's essentially like drinking watered-down salsa with alcohol. Not good.  -Boozy Smoothie: \u00a0Another radical drink. Coffee, banana and bourbon. Amazing. Only sad thing was the tiny glass it came in.  Main Courses:  -Cornmeal Pancakes: These were dry and uninteresting. The lemon curd was good, but they were not even close to Mission Beach Cafe's pancakes with bourbon syrup and vanilla cream.  -Country ham steak &amp; poached farm egg: This dish was an odd combo of cold potatoes, mustard and cabbage with the eggs and ham done in the style of a benedict without the english muffins. It just felt off. \u00a0All of the egg dishes at Zazie blow this out of the water.  -\"Marlowe\" burger: My brother in law is a burger eater. He gets them pretty much everywhere we go. His rating for this one - good, but not on his top 5. (If you're wondering, NOPA's burger is #1 on his list.)  -Crispy polenta cakes: This dish was the best of the batch. The polenta was crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside, the eggs were perfectly poached. However, even this dish was lacking something. A spice? Another ingredient? Not sure, but it didn't make up for the rest.  If you're going to charge as much as Park Tavern does, your food should be exceptional. Sadly, PT's brunch was really a let down. The hardest thing for these guys will be living up to all of the delicious and reasonably priced competition in this city. So far, I would tell anyone considering this place to keep walking a little further to Mama's at Stockton and Filbert. There may be a line, but it's definitely one of the best brunches you'll get in in San Francisco.",

I had made a reservation for 4 but 3 of us arrived originally. We were seated at a table, given menus, and ordered drinks. My friend asked out server's opinion of one of the wines, and rather than speak about a wine he hadn't tried, he brought her out a sample of the wine she requested, plus one the bartender said she might prefer. She loved both and ended up opting for the bartenders recommendation.   Our 4th arrived with an unexpected 5th in tow. Park tavern was able to move us to a new table, and even brought our drinks to follow us. Basically, we felt incredibly cared for, despite realizing the in convince we posed.   In summary of the food: \u00a0the Brussels sprout chips were delicious, simple, and tasted like lemon. The demons on horseback was the least kosher thing one could imagine, but savory and delicious.

I've been here 20+ times (I live 2 blocks away), and I have never been disappointed with a single dish or cocktail. Things you must try at dinner: deviled eggs (GET THEM!), poulet noir (and I don't usually order chicken at restaurants), PT fries, brussel sprout chips, \u00a0bar steak, and cheddar apple crisp. Things you must try at brunch: avocado toast, cod cakes, and polenta cakes with mushrooms. The only downsides to PT are the prices and crowds. It's easy to rack up a hefty bill when you're ordering multiple dishes to share and $13 cocktails. Plan to make a reservation well in advance, or go early to grab space at the communal bar and table. IMO, the best way to experience PT is to make a reservation for brunch, sit outside on a nice sunny day, and watch all the tourists wait in line at Mama's while you dine on far superior food. :)",

The patrons are a diverse mix of young &amp; old that have a passion for wining and dining in the big city. It's cozy with a hip &amp; trendy vibe. Definitely a \"see-and-be-seen\" crowd on the weekends, but not pretentious. It definitely has an NYC restaurant feel. Most importantly the food is the center of the attraction and will have me returning more than once.   A must is the smoked deviled eggs and the brussels sprouts chips to start of your meal on the right track. The highlight, of course, was the rotisserie chicken from their wood oven. My first bite was a food orgasm in my mouth. SMH, chicken is usually the most boring item to order from most restaurants unless you get it from Costco (Joke).  Park Tavern had me at first bite.",

Had the pork belly bites, brussel sprout chips, and fried oyster caesar for apps, the scallops, mussels and a side of polenta for entree. Like I said delish!   Why not 5 stars than you ask....Got here a couple minutes early for my reservation. Told out table was not quite ready...no problem, I will have a drink. Person who was community table server was at the other end of the table but never bothered \"looking\" down his station to be aware of the whole picture (major pet peeve of mine) After trying to get his attention several times my friend and I went to the bar at which time our other friend finally waved him down. So we got our drinks and were sipping them and he comes over and asks us what time our reservation was for 8p he says, and I say no it was for 7:45p (it was a bit after 8p) and proceeds to give us a check and asked us to get up as there were several people hovering around for our seats...OMG, are you joking??? especially since the drinks were close to $40. I was very turned off by that and did something I never do at a restaurant, I went to the manager and asked if it was OK if we sat there till out table was ready (especially since we were on time and it was going on 30 min at this point)...she said absolutely and asked who said it wasn't...I had to tattle on this guy as it was some of the worst customer service I have encountered in a restaurant in a LONG time. About 10 minutes later they sat us at a nice table by the line ( I love watching the action, I have been in the business for my whole working life). Thank you manager/head hostess (gal with blond hair, wearing a gray sweater, sorry I forgot to ask your name) as you changed the sour taste in my mouth that your ridiculous acting server put in it...then also the food helped.",

We had lemon chips w burrata and PT fries w truffle, soft-cooked eggs and caviar to start.

Had Dave's classic carrot BDay cake w cream cheese frosting which could go down as the best carrot cake in history! \u00a0Both the olive oil polenta cake w almond ice cream and the carrot cake were incredibly light yet delicious which are hard to do. \u00a0  Will go back to explore the rest of the menus for sure!",

We were all very hungry, but luckily our table was ready when we arrived.   Atmosphere: classy, trendy, modern. Perfect for impressing a hot date. Not especially intimate and can get somewhat noisy when crowded.  We ordered a few starters to share: Toast with avocado - eh, I could have made this at home Almond croissant - yum! Ginger scone - good  Service was a little lacking, but we didn't need much and our waitress looked frantic trying to deal with all of her tables, so I'll let that slide.   For my brunch meal I ordered the butter lettuce and lobster salad. It was...small. In fact, all of the dishes at our table were small. The french toast came with 3 measly little pieces. The baked farm eggs seemed to imply that there would be multiple eggs, but it looked like just one.   On the plus side, plating was beautiful and the food was tasty. The salad was fresh and had a nice citrus/dill dressing that was not too overwhelming.   As a brunch restaurant, I thought it was pretty pricey for the quantity/quality. But it's a beautiful restaurant and their dinner menu looks amazing so I will give them another try at a different meal time.",

Brussels Sprout Chips ($6) are a classic dish moved over from Marlowe, light, greasy, perfect.  Lemon &amp; basil leaf, burrata ($12) featured homemade mozzarella cheese that was slightly runny along with deep fried lemon wheels that made an interesting but workable combination.  Manila clam chowder, shaved bottarga &amp; chives ($12) was creamy and full of flavor, all in all very good.  Deviled Eggs, bacon, pickled jalepe\u00f1o &amp; chives ($1.50 ea) are a must order. We were not fans of deviled eggs, but with one bite we were believers.  Petit \"Poulet Rouge\" Bloomsdale spinach &amp; Peewee potatoes ($24) was a Cornish game hen presented at the table facing upright with a tableside sauce pour. This chicken was very tender and juicy and a must order. The Bloomsdale spinach and kiwi potatoes were also excellent. This dish gives Zuni Cafe a run for their money.  Grilled pork chop, Italian butter bean piston, dinosaur kale, toasted garlic &amp; chili flakes ($24) was cut in two and perfectly cooked to a juicy medium rare. A must get for pork fans like us.  Creekstone NY Steak, red wine jus, Mangalitsa butter &amp; french fries ($29) featured two triangles of medium (slightly pink in the middle) tender meat with angular charcoal grilling embedded on the surface. Excellent french fries and a very robust sauce.  Special of the Day: Brussel Sprout Hearts ($7) were sauteed with lemon and cheese, a very nice side dish.  Dessert:  Fig &amp; apple crisp ($7) Whole lemon gelato took about 15 minutes to arrive, hot out of the oven, but worth the wait due to the very fresh fruit and tasty crumble. The gelato was first class.  Birthday Cake - November ($7) Casey's carrot cake was the cake of the month and a great version of the classic. Better than most people expect.  Pans: Mendocino uni, butter lettuce, chili &amp; avocado oil ($11) - Simply did not work. They need to perform some surgery on this dish.

    "review_text": "*3.5 stars*  Park Tavern is designed to be perfect for any occasion -- birthdays, business meetings, catchups with friends, anything. It has a great atmosphere, thanks to the excellent design of the place.   The service was absolutely incredible. From the hostess to the bar server to our wonderful dining server, Emily, everything was on-point. We had to add 2 people last-minute to our table, and Emily graciously and happily helped us move to another table halfway through our meal. It really made our experience that much more enjoyable.  The food was a hit or miss for us. I'm a fan of Marlowe, so I was expecting the same level of excellence here, but it was just lacking a bit when compared to Marlowe.  ---------------------------- FOOD:  Deviled Eggs = Delicious. Everything goes together perfectly.  Brussels Sprouts Chips = Addictive as always. Can't go wrong here.  PT Fries = Good, but nothing spectacular. The caviar wasn't salty enough to bring the flavors together between the egg yolk and the aioli. Half of the fries were overfried.  Grilled Pork Chop = Tender for the most part and had a pure flavor to it. It wasn't exciting, but it was definitely a well-cooked pork chop.  Mussels and Clams = This was good, but again, nothing exciting.  3 Variations of Duck = I had high hopes for this one, but again, it fell short. The duck breast was a bit dry, the duck confit was a bit overcooked, the duck skin wasn't crispy enough, and the duck liver mousse was too watery. The flavors were all there, it just could've been so much better. Plus, the beans didn't really add anything beneficial to the dish.  Venison Tartare = This dish was a great attempt, but was definitely lacking in execution. The beef tartare was good, but it was missing something with a bit more umami (for instance, it could've used some sesame oil or quail egg). The deep-fried bone marrow is an interesting idea, but was completely lackluster in execution. The bits of bone marrow was easily overpowered by the breading and it just tasted like fried oil.  Hamachi Crudo w/ Gin &amp; Tonic = This dish wasn't good at all. There was no depth or excitement whatsoever -- it needed a couple of extra layers of flavor (something salty, something tangy) to really make the hamachi pop. Unfortunately, it ended up being just a bland, strange mixture of flavors between the overpowering cucumber, the bland gin &amp; tonic ice, and the nonexistent flavor of the hamachi.  ----------------------------  All in all, Park Tavern is a good space with a great bar and phenomenal service. I'd definitely come back for some drinks and small bites. The food, however, just doesn't match up to everything else.",

Even with a group of 6, no one liked it enough to have another one. What was delicious was my basil, burrata and lemon appetizer. Very innovative and clean.   I made the mistake of ordering the mussels which after reading Anthony Bourdains book, you should never order mussels unless you know the chef. They were fine, but for the price, it wasn't much food and it wasn't anything exciting. \u00a0Talking to some of the girls after, everyone thought the same thing, the food was fine, but nothing great and not a place that we'd go out of our way to go back to.",

The reason I gave 3 stars instead of 4 is that the service was spotty.

We arrived 15 min before our reservation and the hostess had just left her station to seat another party. \u00a0Someone else asked us if we had been helped to which we said no and that we had reservations. He asked if we'd like to sit at the bar and wait for a few minutes or if we'd like to be seated right away. \u00a0We said we'd like to be seated. \u00a0He left and the hostess came back.

We asked if our bar tab could be transferred to the table and she said it was preferable that we take care of the bar tab first. \u00a0So, I had my husband go get seated white I paid the bar tab. \u00a0When I got to our table, I saw that most all the tables around us (about 6?) were all empty. \u00a0So, why did they make us go to the bar first only to come get us 5 min later? \u00a0Mind you, everyone (including the bartenders) was super friendly and nice. \u00a0They just created a slight inconvenience right up front.  Our server at the table started off a bit odd too. Just as she started to explain the special to us, she abruptly excused herself to help serve the food to the next table. \u00a0She then came back to finish explaining the special. \u00a0Really odd. \u00a0After that experience, service was almost flawless (almost because we asked for more bread but had to ask again before we got some). \u00a0If it weren't for the experience right up front, we would have rated the service at Park Tavern 5 stars (I'll explain later).  Deviled eggs, PT fries, and steak tartar (special of the night) were had for appetizers. \u00a0We really had come prepared to eat! \u00a0All were all great as we had expected and hoped. \u00a0We finished off the drinks from the bar and had the 2000 Caymus Cabernet that we brought with us decanted during appetizers. \u00a0(Corkage is $20, by the way.)  Dinner was seafood plate and filet mignon. \u00a0Both were completely forgettable and were a bit on the salty side (and I tend to eat a bit salty usually!). Filet wasn't what I expected (to melt in my mouth). \u00a0The twice cooked potatoes with the filet were too salty and creamed greens a \u00a0bit too mushy.  The real disappointment was the dessert. \u00a0Hubby had birthday cake because it was his birthday. \u00a0I ordered raspberry blueberry crisp and I couldn't take more than 2 bites (hubby took 2 bites too). \u00a0It was so salty and that flavor mixed with meyer lemon curd just made it inedible. The server offered to take it back and see if they could bring me another one without the sea salt (I asked no lemon curd either). \u00a0A different person (maitre d maybe?) came \u00a0by to tell me that the breading on top (the crisp par of the crisp) had salt in it already so he didn't think I would like it without any topping either.. He asked if I wanted another so I got the panna cotta. \u00a0(He was so nice and gracious!) \u00a0It was plain and a bit... yes, salty. \u00a0When the guy came by to ask how my dessert was, I didn't have the heart to tell him I didn't like it (hubby ate it b/c he hates to leave leftovers). \u00a0He was so genuinely nice!  When the check was brought, the server let us know that they didn't charge for either desserts. \u00a0Again superb service.   How to rate?",

Amaze me the number of great reviews this restaurant has, I would have to come again and see if it amaze me as well, it definitely didn't this time around.  Things you need to know, for brunch this restaurant is in the pricey side and portions are not too big. I loved my dish and everything else looked delicious, but was a bit meh that some of us left hungry after eating here. Figured we should have ordered more than one dish. I ordered the beef hash and was very delicious, a bit salty for me but I enjoyed it very much. We also had a pitcher of a vodka lemon drink, was just ok.  I was not a fan of the service, super slow! It took a long time to get our food, to get the check, to get receipts back. Lots of smiles but there's opportunity for improvement on the service part. Service is a big part of a good restaurant, I was upset the Whole time because was too slow for me.  I would love to check it for dinner. The presentation of dishes was great, but again for brunch I personally would like bigger portions.",

The first time I came here the stuffing with the chicken was amazing (crispy but juicy), but the next time I came there were just some vegetables which was a bummer. Hopefully it's seasonal and the stuffing will be back soon!",

    "review_text": "I have such mixed feelings about this place...  I live in the neighborhood, so I badly want to love it, but it's just too inconsistent.  I've had a decent dinner, a great dinner, a pretty terrible brunch, great snacks + drinks, and awful service.   Today in particular was a low point: I brought my parents here for a late lunch &amp; cocktails. I requested a table outside and was told it would be about a 30 - 45 minute wait. Ok, cool. So we strolled around the park and Goorin Brothers as we waited for our table. Upon our return, we were told our table indoors was being set up. I reminded the hostess that I had requested an outdoor table. She shrugged her shoulders and told us they didn't have one. If we wanted an outdoor table, we could be put on the list and it would be about 30-45 minutes. I, then, reminded her that I had been on that list and waited 45 minutes. Our hostess than flatly said that there weren't any notes on our reservation and that there must have been a communication error. I told her that if there had been a communication issue, it would have been between us, since it was she I had spoken to 45 minutes prior. She again shrugged. Ridiculous! In the end, they didn't really seem to care that they'd made a mistake nor did they try in any way to make it right. So, we decided not to, again, wait 45 minutes for the outdoor table... instead we walked down the street and into Original Joe's.  I also happen to work by their new sister restaurant The Cavalier, which I actually like much better. Better interior (funnily enough - it used to be Million Dollar Thai), better cocktails, and better service.  I agree with most of the reviews;  Come here for the smoked deviled eggs, marlowe burger, cocktails, the pt fries.  Better dinner spots in the neighborhood: Capo's, The Square, Don Pisto's or Ferry Plaza Seafood.",

    "review_text": "Park Tavern is my favorite restaurant in the city.   From the owners to the janitors, this place is world-class. It was built right, it is staffed right, and the food is f--king phenomenal. I eat there maybe once a month and they treat me like I'm family. My friends ask me why I'm so obsessed; \"There are way nicer restaurants than Park\" is often what I hear- that's not what I care about. Quality and class have nothing to do with price or exclusivity.  The host/ess is always in full control of the restaurant; they take a drink order if we arrive early. The bartenders are professionals. The servers are informed and discreet about any special requests, and not once in the many times I've eaten there have they made a mistake.  The food- I show up, order two deviled eggs, a McClaren, a glass of water, and the pork, and I'm good. It's priced right and the reviews here speak for it.   Anna Weinberg is doing things right, customer for life right here. I have plenty of places I love in the city but there is nowhere that makes more of an understated, flawless effort to simply get ev-er-y-thing right from the reservation to helping you into your jacket on the way out the door.",

My BFF went for the poulet noir which comes with stuffing and black truffle, WOW -:)  We sat at the Bar and Brian was just amazing. \u00a0Keep up the good work Park Tavern.",
