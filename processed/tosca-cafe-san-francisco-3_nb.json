    "review_text": "Been years since I've been to this old-school spot and was truly impressed with the overhaul. The fused enhancement--keeping the classic, faded North Beach charm with the addition of an excellent mixology program and hip cooking--really worked well. Definitely shell out for one of the menu cocktails, I loved the Suffering Bastard (always try a bastard drink) as well as the the Polo Cup. The Oaxacan Firing Squad will be perfect for anyone enjoying the Mezcal craze. Their Rosita differs greatly from my understanding of the recipe, so I'll have to try this one next time. On the food front, best thing is to share all your dishes for the optimal experience. Props for the pressed pig ears which we reluctantly tried. They tasted a bit like bacon sashimi, if such a thing exists, and we were pleasantly surprised. Make sure to add a tad of salt to the pieces lying under the top piece as a means to bring out the best flavor. The moscardini, aka octopus is tender, grilled, and I'm sure you will love it if you are a mollusk fan, like me. For mains, they were out of the cod, major bummer, so we got and loved the grilled polenta. The pork sausage is worth a go as well, very tender and different from any other. We were so full but tried the cannoli for dessert. Like everything, it was great. Can't wait to return. PS: Outstanding A+ service.",

    "review_text": "Tosca - it's so good to have you back.  This used to be one of my favorite North Beach watering holes back in the day. It's one of SF's classic bars. Many a celebrity used to frequent the place (and their infamous \"private back room\"), including: Sean Penn, Francis Ford Coppola, and famous rock stars. But over the years, Tosca started to experience some noticeable wear and tear in both upkeep and service. Finally, it was at risk of shutting down... until the team behind New York's Spotted Pig swooped in to the rescue. After a few months of revamping the interior, updating their bar program, and adding a kitchen, Tosca's doors are open again. And the best way I can describe the change - it's a like an old friend who's studied abroad over a year, and now he's back and a changed person. It's still the same old friend that you know and love, but just more sophisticated and mature (and quite frankly, the better for it).  My co-workers and I came in here the other night for some holiday cocktails and grub. After wading through the crowded, narrow bar area, we finally made it to their dining area. Fortunately for us, they were able to seat us right away. Looking around the room, everything looked somewhat familiar (the wooden bar, the large Rat Pack-style booths) but more spruced up than i remember. Obviously, the most notable change to Tosca is the kitchen and the smell of food. Our thirsty/hungry gang ordered some festive adult beverages and anti-pasti (pickled peppers, grilled octopus, roasted Romaine with pine nuts, charcutterie, fresh focaccia bread). I wound up sipping on a classic Negroni on the rocks (or one giant rock, I should say). This is an old-school cocktail and very easy to screw up if you over-pour one the Campari or Sweet Vermouth. My Negroni was perfectly balanced. One of the best ones I've ever had. I then indulged in their Point Reyes Blue salad (Heirloom Radicchios, Croutons, Dutch Shallots, blue cheese dressing). It was kind of like a more sophisticated take on a Wedge salad. I loved it. In fact, I pretty much licked my plate clean.  One warning - this place is LOUD. If you're looking for an intimate night out, this isn't the place to go. You'll be shouting at each other the whole night long.  All in all, we had a most enjoyable time at the new Tosca, I'm delighted to see it surviving and thriving in its new incarnation.",

Like others have said on here, the food is salty. \u00a0Some of the dishes were overly salty that I drank so much water during dinner and drank more water when I got home. \u00a0That said the meatballs, gemelli and linguine were great (but could have a bit less salt). \u00a0For main I had the braised oxtail and I found it mediocre. The meat was a bit gummy probably from too much fat and oils - needed more braising time. \u00a0  I got the gelati thinking it would be a palate cleanser from the too salty food but even that had salt! \u00a0I couldn't believe it - they sprinkled salt on top!!  For the wine lovers, note that they store their wines on a wall out in the open with accent lighting behind them. \u00a0I hope they go through the bottles quickly. \u00a0The exposure to heat and temperature fluctuation is not good.   On the plus side, they finally got their act together and you can now book a table via OpenTable instead of standing in line. \u00a0There aren't many tables so highly recommend making a reservation.  With so many other wonderful restaurants in SF, I don't think I'll come back.",

The wait for a dinner table was around an hour, so we put our name down and took a seat at the bar. The staff was very friendly and made some delicious cocktails. My favorite drink is the Polo Cup (with gin), followed closely by the Cap Haitian Apple Toddy and the Bennet. While at the bar we ordered the marinated olives, the fennel salad, and the moscardini (octopus salad). The octopus was incredible, as was the fennel. Everything was done to perfection and tasted like food you would get in Italy. Once we were sat at a table, we ordered the two specials, a meatball dish and a crab salad. The crab was super fresh and the dressing was a crab-ceasar dressing. The meatballs were made of three types of meat and were extremely tasty. For the entree we split the bucatini and I was blown away by how good it was. I usually don't order pasta at restaurants, but this pasta was perfectly al dente with a rich tomato sauce.   It was an overall perfect meal. The decor is warm and inviting; a mixture of the new and the old. I love this place and I can't wait to go back.",

    "review_text": "I half expected a celebrity spotting at the newly face-lifted Tosca, with it's Rat Pack grandeur still peeking through the new polish. My friend tells a story of the time he watched a fancy car pull up right in front of Tosca, moved the orange parking cones out of the way, and claimed the restricted zone as his parking spot. The rockstar parking suddenly made sense when Huey Lewis stepped out and waltzed into Tosca.   Fast forward to 2013...only rowdy, cocktail-sloshing businessmen lined the bar on this chilly December night. The atmosphere is very North Beach: tightly-packed, with that European brand of unusual weekday vivacity. The narrow front half of the space is all bar, the back half is a small dining room with leather booths and a few casual dining tables. As we squeezed our way to the hostess stand, we passed the charcuterie station where hunks of cured meat were being sliced paper thin. Little bowls of olives, octopus, peppers, and fresh foccacia beckoned a bar snack. I never knew the old Tosca, but I was feeling optimistic about the new one.  We were able to get a table for 6 with no reservation on a Wednesday night. From there, we sampled the drink &amp; antipasti menu. The wines by the glass are limited and pricey - most reds are $12-13, so you might as well try a cocktail. Their signature is the \"House Cappucino\" (Armagnac, Bourbon, Chocolate Ganache, Organic Milk). Tempting, but you've got to be in the right mood.   The antipasti menu is great for bar snacking with things like: Giardiniera (pickled peppers), Moscardini (grilled octopus), and Roasted Treviso (roasted romaine with pine-nuts). From the dining room, you can see the open kitchen where the main courses come out: fancy incarnations of pasta &amp; polenta, Italian meat dishes, and classic desserts. Starters are $9-16, Secondi entrees $15-17, and Mains $29-42. Basically, a drink and a snack will run you about $25.   Service was fine -- not overly friendly, as you might (unfortunately) expect in a posh new spot. The food was creative &amp; comforting, and the ambiance is sleek &amp; lively. Overall, Tosca has retained the simplicity of an Italian taverna with the panache of a modern SF dining destination. If you're curious, it's worth a taste!",

Instead, we decided to focus on the menu, and after a brief review of the limited menu choices and the above average prices, by mutual agreement, we left and went elsewhere in North Beach.  BTW: At the bar we noted that one of the bartenders was clearly under the influence, and openly knocked back a shot glass of something other than H20. Not sure if drinking on the job is tolerated, but there was no attempt to be discrete about it.  Otherwise, the new Tosca looks a lot better than the original but is clearly designed to attract the under-30 demographic.",

After having waited for 1hr40mins (not my choice, a friend really really wanted to try this place) we were told that a table was being set, but we'd have to wait another 10 minutes because they were \"trying to pace the kitchen\". Really? At least let us sit down and liquor up!  They have an item on the menu (chicken for 2) which says \"please allow us 1 hour to prepare\". We thought OK (even though we've already been waiting for an hour and 40 minutes), we'll order lots of appetizers and pastas, etc. and at the end, the chicken will come out and will be amazing. 2 hours after we had been seated - there was no sign of any chicken. We had to check in again to make sure it was coming. When it did come out - it was truly divine. So moist. So flavorful.   Overall - I would never ever return again.

The flavors were there, and it breaks my heart because there was so much potential. Unfortunately, the salt rendered the food nearly inedible. Our table went through at least 5 or 6 pitchers of water to wash everything down. We most likely would not return.

Too bad Tosca fell so short of our expectations. The restaurant's decor is charming and comfortable. They did a great job of maintaining it's original vintage feel without resorting to clich\u00e9d reclaimed wood and filament bulbs. The service was slow and amateurish. The waiter presented the wine to my husband to taste even though I had been the one to order it. There were a couple of interesting tuna appetizers on the menu. The egg tonnato was very good, the egg making a natural pairing with tonnato sauce. It was a great alternative to the traditional veal recipe. \u00a0The tuna conserva with radishes on the other hand lacked brightness that should have counterbalanced the heavy oiliness of the tuna and the creaminess of the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. The crispy pig tails, while cooked perfectly and full of flavor, were over-salted as were the crispy potatoes many of which were fried to death. The turnips were so very average. There weren't many enticing secondi choices. We settled on the hangar steak because we wanted a meat dish and didn't want to wait one hour for the chicken. Had we known the service would be so slow we might have ordered it. The hangar steak was tasty if uninventive. Not all the dishes were uninspired. The bucatini with guanciale and chile was undeniably the star dish of the evening. We should have foregone all the other dishes and just ordered 6 of those instead.",

Loved the music playing on the jukebox. \u00a0My only knocks on the place are (1) the service - I thought it was just ok. \u00a0The waiter was not really very attentive, empty plates sat in need of clearing, another cocktail was not offered. \u00a0Yet I saw a lot of waiters just kind of hanging around in the corners of the restaurant. \u00a0(2) The bathroom - I get that this place is a former dive bar that hosted celebrities &amp; has a long history - but today I'm at a nice restaurant &amp; while your bathroom might be considered kitschy, it's old &amp; a bit on the gross side.",

Fortunately we were able to nab a recently vacated booth and enjoy a round of drinks.  The music ranged from Tom Petty and Bob Dylan to some current top 40. Definitely a great hangout for someone in their mid 20s-30s. Was too full from dinner elsewhere to try the food but many items jumped out at me.   At the top of the cocktail menu they feature a a signature drink called a Tosca Cappuccino that's definitely worth trying! I was tempted to try other drinks as well because the menu had a lot of interesting options, but going on the advice of a friend on a chilly winter night I couldn't resist tasting this 'adult hot chocolate.' Made with Marie Duffau Bas Armagnac, Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Dandelion Chocolate Ganache, and Milk, it's obvious why this is the house specialty cocktail. In fact, I'd come back just for that!  The lights are a little dim, the fixtures are clean but dated in a cool way, and hanging out there I definitely felt like I was out and about in a unique to SF spot.

Saw Tosca pretty hip and busy thinking why not.  Ambiance: From the outside looks modern after complete make over the bar area was fill. People smiling picking up food taking a sip here and there. Noise level was pretty darn close to not hearing each other may need hand gestures. Front to back looks good enough for anyone who walks in without RSVP.   Staff: This is were I had a problem with the bouncer guy. I stood there looking in trying to get pass him while he was flirting with the ladies. I know all too well with situations like this were you want to impress and hope you can get in their pants after. The guy was light skin black shave head with a suit and tie, walks and act like he owns the place. Shit being a local and have roots in little Italy as well as Chinatown I know most of the owners that operates in the area. He was piss that I try to walk past him without acknowledging him. For what? Your attention was turn towards to three ladies hehe haha there and here I didn't want to bother you. Don't try to talk to me in front of the ladies for showing off or might be an (ADD) aka attention deficit disorder.  Cleanliness: It's clean all around step in there for about 30 seconds til he pulls me back out.  Eats/Drinks: Didn't get a chance to eat or drink due to bouncer who wants to show who's boss.  Punch Line: Hip,vibrant,for the 35+ crowd,clean concept,nicely remodel,a little dim,hard to park after 6pm,located on a busy streets,lots of foot traffic during weekends,Hustler Club next door,lusty ladies gone,great picture of Transamerica building.  Final Thoughts: You see what happens when your role as a bouncer does to a person. It fucks up their mentality so they want to really show that they're are better than a door person. I don't see it that way, it's like security guards with badges trying to act like police. Remember now you maybe somebody there many look up to.

It had a classy and fun vibe and lots of energy there. The dining area seemed small which I liked and I also liked the open view into the kitchen.  The service was above average. We had a lot of questions about the menu items since some of them are a bit different and our server was more than willing to help out. We stuck with beer and wine for alcohol. The wine list seemed a bit limited but I was able to find something satisfactory.  The food was hit and miss. It started out great, we started with the pickled veggies, a market salad, and the oxtail terrine. All three were above average. The best thing we had all night was the pasta dish. I forget what it was called but it had a lemon flavor and some toasted breadcrumbs. Very tasty. We ordered the lamb ribs and a nightly special veggie of turnips. These were \u00a0a letdown and a big miss. The problem was that the piece of meat was sooooo fatty. I'm not talking a little added flavor, it was almost inedible. The veggies were tasty but soaked in oil. \u00a0This seemed to be a bit of a common theme for all of the food. It was all too heavy/creamy/buttery/oily. You can serve heavier food without going overboard, but Tosca wasn't successful in doing this. I may go back for a drink at the bar or maybe try to order some different things, but I'd stay away from the lamb ribs or any veggies soaked in oil.",

    "review_text": "Perhaps my expectations were too high. Was really happy that they started taking reservations tho. My friends and I had wanted to come here for awhile. Checked in at the host stand for an early res (5:15) and was told they would come and get us when it was time. Sat at the bar and ordered a very delicious cocktail - so far so good. It was past our res time by about 10 minutes and no one came to get us so we went back to the host stand and were seated in a nice rounded booth. Service was nice - I don't know why others are so critical.   The food is where the disappointment came for me. Had the pig tail app - delicious! Had meatballs - very good. Cesar salad - overdressed for me. I ordered the gemelli, done in the cacio a pepe style and it wasn't made correctly - very grainy with cheese instead of smooth. This is a dish I have had elsewhere better. The rigatoni was very good and the bucatini was tasty but the noodles were quite thin - bucatini should be thicker and chewier. hmmmm. Foccacia is delish and we had some broccoli that I didn't try and the potatoes.....too much food. Potatoes were a bit too salty for me. \u00a0Way too full for dessert but nothing on the menu seemed that inspiring anyway.   Glad I went but don't really need to go back. I find it interesting that this received such a glowing and high review in publications. Maybe when the chef/owner is there it's better but I don't get the idea she is there often. Maybe it was the chef de cuisines night off. Anyway.",

We had a nice social time in the line with co-line participants. The doors opened we went in and sat at the bar. This is what we intended. The bartender was very helpful with the menu and the recent background on the restaurant. My wife and I have been to the Spotted Pig and The Breslin in New York 2 of April's (the owner) restaurants. We do love both of the New York Restaurants. We were impressed with Tosca. At the bar we talked to the bartender and the people near us. A very friendly atmosphere.   We had the meatballs and the bar sandwich. The meatballs were a wonderful combination of meats and spices. They are worth the walk! The bread with the meatballs is wonderful and the bar sandwich was small but very good.   We will return!",

    "review_text": "One of my favorite things about San Francisco is that you really do not need to make reservations for some of the great restaurants our city has to offer, Tosca being one of them. \u00a0We arrived around 8pm and were told that it would be a 1.5 to 2 hour wait, but literally snagged two seats at the bar within 15 minutes. \u00a0I'm a big fan of April Bloomfield and was eager to see what she has done with the restaurant, so would not have minded the wait, regardless. \u00a0Besides, we were in no hurry and happy to have found a restaurant open on New Years night. \u00a0  The atmosphere reminds me of a classic mobster movie, playing old Italian music, with dim lighting and dark booths as you pass the bar. \u00a0Very cozy, even sitting at the bar. \u00a0I was also very pleased with the service, as they were attentive despite how busy it was. \u00a0  We started off our night with a cocktail to settle in, both of us ordering the Polo Cup (vodka, cucumber, mint, basil, elderflower, lemon soda). \u00a0Much care was taken to ensure they were made properly, as we watched our bartender beind the bar. \u00a0If you like cool, refreshing drinks like myself, this one definitely made an impression.  We ordered several dishes to share; my recommendations being the linguini with mussels, pancetta, and toasted coriander. \u00a0The combined flavors of the dish were excellent and the linguini cooked perfectly. \u00a0When I return to Tosca, this will definitely be a repeat. \u00a0Although I was disappointed that they ran out of the caulifower gratin, the crispy potatoes, prepared in pork fat, rosemary and garlic, did not disappoint. \u00a0And when you dip the potatoes in the remnant tomato sauce from the linguini dish? \u00a0Even better.  1 cocktail and 2 very generous glasses of wine later, how could you say 'no' to their House Capp (armagnac, bourbon and dandelion chocolate) and cannoli? \u00a0Perfect ending to a perfect dining experience...",

The only dishes that we had that weren't over salted was the baby octopus antipasti, and the pork sausage dish from the seconds section of the menu. The quality of the ingredients were wonderful, how ever the preparation was lacking a lot.   Not only was the food an issue for us, but the service was inattentive, not very helpful with ordering or answering questions, and it took forever to get seated and even longer to get our food. We arrived around 7:15pm and the hostess told us it would be a little more than an hour to be seated but probably less. We checked back with her at 8:30 and they still needed 30 minutes before we could get seated. In the end it took almost an hour longer than we were told it would take to get seated. Then we ordered. Our first dishes came in 10 or 15 minutes. But after that we had at least half an hour \u00a0gaps between courses while others who arrived after us had, in the meantime, been served 2 or 3 courses. We spent over 2.5 hours at Tosca; 80% of the time just waiting for service, food, or drinks.  I would not go back and would not recommend.",

My recommendation is to go early in the week close to opening and sit at the bar so that you skip the cluster this place can become at prime time. \u00a0Pro-tip; if you're tall, sit at the end of the bar closest to the door. \u00a0The bar bows out in the middle/toward the end and makes it tough if your legs are long. \u00a0You don't want to be hunched over your soup.  Speaking of soup, get the Italian Wedding Soup. \u00a0It's perfect and a must have. \u00a0Also, fried pig tails with balsamic reduction, yum! \u00a0This is another place where I think you get more bang for your buck and more interesting flavors by sticking with small plates. \u00a0The entrees are good, but my preference is the pastas and small plates. \u00a0  If only the space was a little bigger and less hectic, but there isn't much they can do about that...",

Last Saturday, during the height of the weekend dinner rush, I was able to walk-in to Tosca at 7pm and score a table of 4.   Dont ask me how. Maybe I can be that persuasive? ;)  I was ECSTATIC to eat here because I had just finished Season 2 of Mind of Chef\" on Netflix and was really impressed with April Bloomfield's cooking style: fresh ingredients done simply or honest ingredients in unforgettable dishes.   The food lived up to my expectations and I really enjoyed my meal here:  The standouts: -Crispy pig tails: One of those dishes that are so good that you think, man, why hasn't someone done this before? A classic example of throw away bits that you can re-purpose into delicious dishes. Crunchy coating, succulent fat, and the carnal experience of eating with your hands and gnawing fat and cartilage from bone. So satisfying. -Rigatoni: One taste of this dish and you understand why Mario Batali flew her out from London to New York and offered her a job that day. This British girl knows her Italian. So simple, so delicious.  -Roasted chicken for 2 in marsala and ricotta bread: I wasn't a fan of the soggy ricotta bread under the roasted chicken, but the chicken itself and the marsala sauce was delicious. Moist, juicy, flavorful chicken and silky, decadent marsala sauce mingling with the jus of the chicken. Comfort food brought to another level.  -Crispy potatoes in pork fat: the perfect accompaniment to the roasted chicken. Perfectly crispy and slightly salty on the outside and creamy on the inside. Slight notes of herb.   Pretty good: -Grilled polenta with mushrooms, mascarpone, and parmesan -Artichokes in oil, red wine vinegar, aioli, mint and oregano  Pass:  -Oxtail terrine: strange dish for me. Cold, identifiable gelatinous substance solidified around meager chunks of oxtail.",

    "review_text": "Oh Tosca. We will be dreaming of your Spring Minestrone soup. So delicious that we went back 4 days later. I feel the Yelp ratings are a little lacking and probably a testimony to high expectations of a celebrity chef / angst over a SF legend. I have been to Tosca when it was just a super cool bar with a famous juke box, and now I've had the privilege of enjoying dinner twice. Most recently with April Bloomfield in the kitchen. And I was very satisfied.   The pastas are legit. Exactly what my Italian husband was looking for in terms of comfort food and taste. The soup was, well, let's just say I would pay money to get the recipe (hint). We also had the meatballs. Oh. My. God. A meat combo of pork shoulder, beef short ribs, and guanciale. GUANCIALE!! I don't get the overly salty thing mentioned by others. I thought all the seasoning was spot on. There were other amazing things like roasted carrots and broccoli, but I think you get the picture.   I thought the wine by the glass options were exciting. I love a Sicilian Frappato (trendy, I know, but I do). And there was an amazing red frizzante (lightly chilled) that was absolutely perfect for an abnormally warm SF night. I admit I am a fan of April Bloomfield, but I also do not tolerate a mediocre meal or service. I felt well taken care of. I will recommend to all my friends. And I hope you get to enjoy as well. Oh - I tried the house cappuccino. It was good. Yeah... I said it. It was real good.",

And heard from other chefs that this place is nice for late dinner (especially for industry people who get out late everyday like us). Anyways....like everything we got. Octopus was good. Cacio de pepe was too cheesy it was gloppy and not creamy. The tiramisu was perfect. The problem is here.....We got the chicken liver. We both love chicken liver. We are BOTH chefs here in SF.!! It came out and it was on a skewer. Took it off the skewer and noticed it was very medium rare. \u00a0Not the best idea to eat chicken liver so under done and we knew it. Not blaming tosca. We poked at it and talked about weather or not we should eat it. We ignored our better judgement and ate it cause we were so hungry. Finished our meal and went home. 5 days later I became extremely I'll from food Bourne illness aka food poisoning. To be honest I had no idea what it was from. I was in so much abdominal pain that I almost fainted twice. It lasted strong for 3 days. A couple days later after returning to work I texted my same friend and asked her when we can schedule our next meal together, that's when she said she has been bed ridden due to food poisoning. That's when my jaw dropped. I told her I had the same thing and it must have been our dinner from earlier in the week. We remembered the \"if-y\" liver we ate. I emailed tosca and told them what happened. Only seemed like the right thing to do. I wasn't blaming them And I wasn't mad or upset, but being in the food business I just thought it's something I should share. We would want someone to share that kind of info if it was our restaurants. It's been over a month and I haven't heard anything. No sorry. No thank you for sharing. No we will try to be on the look out for that. No nothing. So I took this time to write a yelp review to share my experience with people who actually care. Here it is. Enjoy everyone. Bed time.",

It was SO good that we ordered another round.  *Meatballs w/ house baked focaccia ($12 + $4): 5 STARS <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F14qkeKj&amp;s=15e23ed116920df23bcaf0e9af3052e1041d3808890356ba35c335eef1093e60\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/14qkeKj</a> These were disappointingly tiny but the flavorful meatiness and airy texture made up for it. The crunchy yet cloudy focaccia dipped in the marinara sauce was deliciously satisfying.   *Lucamoni w/ prosciutto, treviso, lemon breadcrumbs ($17): 4 STARS <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1AxfL4r&amp;s=d78e32c2185e81aeaf309b6fd00651d0c87b98fb895a9ed3d85b6dfaf55b2649\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1AxfL4r</a> All their pastas are made in-house, and you must order one. The lucamoni had a great toothsome bite and I loved the light saltiness from the prosciutto and the crunchy texture contrast from the breadcrumbs but it was way too lemony.   *Roasted Half Chicken For Two w/ ricotta, pine nuts, marsala ($42): 4.5 STARS <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Ihkh7t&amp;s=8ac3a1acb9e415c15a83f64289a3d9b31fbe3ececb6d757bc0b5a25c7abcd959\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1Ihkh7t</a> For the price of 8.4 whole rotisserie chickens at Costco, you get a whopping half a chicken at Tosca Caf\u00e9...BUT, this roast chicken beats Zuni Caf\u00e9's hands down (their chicken is so boring and overrated)! The skin was lightly crisp and the meat was succulently moist; even the breast meat. The marsala sauce added a great complex savory sweetness. Loved the crusty bread topped with creamy ricotta and pine nuts. Best roast chicken ever but the price tag is just too ridonkulous to warrant 5 stars.   *Crispy Potatoes w/ pork fat, garlic, rosemary ($7): 2 STARS <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1xLmnNg&amp;s=d8238055135d371a96356f5407e143decc06028d5a556422367e1fa1cd91e974\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1xLmnNg</a> People raved about this but our order oddly tasted like bitter, burnt garlic.  *Tiramisu ($9): 4 STARS <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1xvNt9u&amp;s=69df2f3c4d47878f5f4a14ecc695fd0e98f1ba3617cebdb76a5c35419024ee24\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1xvNt9u</a> This tiramisu will rock your taste buds. The espresso flavor is super strong; way too strong for me but it was well-executed and nicely fluffy. \u00a0 \u00a0  ~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~ This would be a 5 star review except the staff is cold and the service very slow (we had 5 pm reservations).   The only friendly people in the army of staff are the hostess and the American Indian waitstaff (super nice guy). Hopefully one day their kindness will rub off on the rest of the other staff. Obviously, it's their job to get sh*t done and they do but a little kind reciprocation would be appreciated. They wouldn't even acknowledge our \"thank you\"s. Don't expect them to ask you how your meal is either.  Our meal was coursed out so there was an unbearably long lag between courses. Dinner took over 2.5 hours for 4 courses so liquor up!  Only knocking off a star for service because we expected this given all the other reviews.  ~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~ Dark, old skool, and insanely loud. There's 6 tight booths, 3 four tops, 4 two tops, and a private room in back for large groups. Not recommended for an intimate date.  ~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~ Insanely difficult street parking which is why I normally avoid the area. They need to offer valet parking.",

The bar is hopping, but there are plenty of 2 person tables open. The hostess informs us she can seat 2 but she cannot accommodate our friend if she decides to join (despite many open 2 tops) - minus points.  Service starts off well - attention to the water glasses, folding napkins after the restroom... But then it starts to slide quickly. Our waitress informs us that we must make a complete order... What? We were never given bread and then the water refills started to slip.   We started with the baby octopus. Outstanding! I didn't know it was possible to get such a wonderful texture from octopus.  The tuna salad with radish was bright and full of flavor, very refreshing.  The salmon entree was exquisitely prepared, it had a dual personality that was completely balanced between sashimi and cooked. The crispy skin on top was the icing.   We ordered two espressos and this is where service really fell off. Plopped the espresso down without a plate, no sugar, no espresso spoon- had to ask for these items. On top of that the espresso was terrible! Bitter, and not in the strong espresso way! But in the, omg this is almost inedible way (even with 3 scoops of sugar)!",

Had crispy pig tails, meatballs, Dungeness crab salad, Bucatini and Gemelli, Tiramisu for dessert. Overall everything was overseasoned.

Overall, most things weren't that balanced; with a lighter touch I bet they would have been really good. Nowhere near as good as other Italian places in the price point and nearby, like Cotogna or Perbacco.   Digression: Arrived about 515, wanted to start with cocktails and small plates, but waitress said we'd have to order everything at once. \u00a0Little strange for a bar/restaurant, especially when we wanted to space a couple of cocktails over the meal. \u00a0Most places seem to prefer it the other way, to order drinks first and have those arrive before ordering food so that you'll order more booze over the course of the meal.

No problem though, the place was crowded and we totally anticipated a wait. We went to a bar across the street and came back/ checked in with the hostess after 40 minutes. She told us we'd be the next couple of groups seated. 20 minutes later, we saw we had a missed call from the hostess, who we were literally standing 3 feet from and had at this point checked in twice with. Apparently she had completely forgotten who we were and passed us over on the list-- long story short, we waited 2 hours to be seated, instead of the quoted 45. The only reason we stuck around was because we were starving and a little tipsy after some strong drinks at the bar. We explained the situation to the waitress and said we were disappointed with the experience thus far, and she mumbled some lame excuse about the previous party taking a while to (not relevant to our situation, we were repeatedly passed over on the wait list). Their sorry attempt at appeasing us was to bring a free (gross) cold vegetable plate-- would have been more appreciative of some comped drinks. Sadly, the situation didn't improve-- drinks took 20 minutes to arrive, and the grilled lamb ribs we all ordered were 90% fat. Only highlights were the brussel sprouts and the foccacia (which we devoured in our starved state). Went home hungry and disappointed! Hope others have better luck.",

Why'd they have to make it all snooty? The House Cappuccino, used to be awesome, now it's super sweet and way fancier, the servers made sure I knew, but sorry, the expensive ingredients don't make it taste better. And the charm it used to have is gone. The food is very good, yes, but it's basically a completely different restaurant now, not a charming neighborhood bar, and I miss the old Tosca, where I'd spent hours drinking and chatting with friends and loved ones. \u00a0Sadly, my husband and I won't be back.

Hot, luxurious and just boozy enough to make you fall in love. \u00a0  The Polo Cup was decidedly unpleasant. I usually love a cocktail with lots of different flavors - and I'm a sucker for any drink that combines cucumber, mint and citrus - but this combination just didn't work for me. Alas. Maybe with vodka next time instead?  We split the charcuterie plate to munch on while we sipped our drinks. It was a surprisingly hefty plate and a great pairing to our drinks.

    "review_text": "I really don't believe in sighing in print unless you're truly sighing and not just playing for effect. Sigh.   Prologue: I happen to like April Bloomfield's cookbook very much. Her food is hearty, smart, and well conceived. While I realize she is neither in the kitchen nor creating the menu top to bottom, I do believe this is wholly her method and her essence. At Tosca, the food is *all* seasoned heavily - taken right to the brink of being too salty. This is actually a great plus because it's hard to reach and easy to pass that salt line into failure. None of this or the previously noted contributed to the failures of our meal.  We started with the meatballs, which were not on the regular menu but an app special for the night. There were three nice meatballs in a shallow plate of well seasoned marinara. A nice start.  The focaccia too was well seasoned - again, almost too well seasoned - but very tasty. This is not the focaccia I grew up with on the East coast, but that was many years ago. Our waitress said we would love the focaccia to dip into our marinara, but that did not prove necessary (or true).  Next, the crispy pig tails, which I'd never tried before. My guess, they're braised/boiled until soft and then deep fried - the result is a pig tail chicken wing. Except they're fattier and stickier than a chicken wing and the meat is not as easily discerned as it is on a chicken wing. Part of that is due to the darkness of the room, but it's also due to the nature of the cut. No matter, such was its unctuous deliciousness that I chewed it down to almost nothing (which I do not do with a chicken wing). They were not dressed with anything and they were delicious. The highlight of the evening.  Alas, the mid-point of the meal is where all went awry.  First, the fritto misto - butter clams, padron peppers, and salsa gribiche. The most unforgivable problem was that it was served with our pasta dishes. There was a lull after the pig tails when the fritto misto should have been served. Served with the pasta, we had to set the pasta aside because soggy fritto misto is merde. Second problem, the clams were a little too tough. Third problem, either it was a mistake or intentional, but one of the battered pieces was a piece of lemon. This may be a delicacy to some, but I found it repellant and spit it out. The gribiche was okay but it didn't matter because of all the rest.  Then as quickly as we could go to the quickly cooling pasta...  Sigh.  The gemelli, my dish, was in the style of Cacio E Pepe ('cheese and pepper' - pecorino and grated black peppercorns), one I adore. It was over cooked, over-cheesed, and the sauce had seized and separated. Terrible. The proportion of pecorino to pasta was all wrong. I happen to put too much cheese on most of my pasta so for me to complain about it here is (almost) stunning. In addition to that, the sauce tasted lemony - so maybe they added lemon (which is not Cacio E Pepe), I don't know, but it was dreadful. As to the pasta itself, I absolutely demand al dente. Yes, the pasta was briefly set aside to pick through the fritto misto, but this pasta was too soft because it came out overcooked.  The date had the linguini with mussels, pancetta, and toasted coriander. The date is a soft touch who likes almost everything she tries in a nice establishment like this one. Her pasta was not as overcooked as mine, but she said the sauce was so sour and nasty that it tasted like vomit. Seriously, she said vomit. I have never heard her describe anything like that before. I tried a bite and it *was* vomitous - it had the raw, uncooked taste of poor quality tomatoes right out of a can. Sour like bile - hence, vomit.   Okay, so the pasta experience was awful - so awful that I actually complained to our waitress. This is also a first. I swear on the lives of all the puppies in the world that I have never done anything like that before. To the restaurant's eternal credit, they took both dishes off our bill. In retrospect, we ate almost none of either so that just makes sense - but I certainly did not expect it and I respect the integrity of the staff to make this decision without my request.  Some might say that every restaurant can have a bad night. I don't care. I don't have the time, inclination, or money to care - as professionals, I really don't think a restaurant deserves a bad night - or at least as bad as this one was at points in the evening.  In closing, but for the pasta dishes, this would have been a fine experience. The space is great, it's charming to see how they fit an open kitchen in there, the cannoli was very good, the house 'Cappuccino' still a treat, the service very good, and the cocktails quite excellent. This is why I cannot go below 3 stars.",

    "review_text": "Oof. We wanted to love this place. My boyfriend raved about the bar it used to be. In its new incarnation, it was pretty sad.  1. Ordered wine and a cocktail. Wine came right away, with a ton of sediment in the bottom, and the cocktail came 15 minutes later.   2. Ordered the chicken liver, which came out fast and was the highlight of the event.  3. 50 minutes later our one pasta dish had still not arrived.   4. Ordered an old fashioned, which came 10 minutes later almost HALF full, including the enormous (we're so fancy) ice cube. So it was basically two sips for $12. I like to think they spilled most of it and just sent it out anyway.  5. Switched to a chianti, which came out ICE cold. Like, your hands are too cold to hold the glass cold.   6. The pasta dish we waited so long for was: Gemelli, black pepper, pecorino toscano. That is fancy talk for mac &amp; cheese. Now I know. I huffed it in 45 seconds and then wondered if it would be another hour until we ate again.   7. For a main I ordered the pork sausage with squash, brown butter &amp; sage. Thank god for that squash b/c it was very good and could be used to mask the sausage, which was moist in a really odd way. It almost had the consistency of a pate.   8. For dessert, instead of getting out of there, we ordered gelati and a coffee drink they're all proud of. Ten full minutes after we had finished the gelati, the coffee came.   We were there for two hours. There were so many missteps along the way, both in service and in food.   My least favorite part of the event actually happened twice, to my surprise. This was that the waitstaff smeared food ONTO our table as he attempted to be fancy and wipe up crumbs. It was so gross.   TL; DR: slow service, weird food, bad at drinks, smeared food onto the table twice.",

    "review_text": "What is the best way to describe the Tosca Caf\u00e9? It's a legendary stop in San Francisco's North Beach that any native and quite frankly any tourist has to hit the next time they are walking the famous Columbus Avenue.   My friend and I arrived at 5:30pm on a Friday evening and the place was already packed. (And they only opened at 5pm!) It was loud and the crowd was a we bit tipsy already. By the time we left by 7pm the place was hot, suffocating, extremely loud and absolutely overflowing with people. A place with the narrow bar all the way in front and the main dining room in the back does not provide for great aesthetics (or great breathable air for that matter), but then again this place is well, shall we say, \"vintage\" so like a fine wine we should celebrate the fact that it's still alive and kicking with providing great drinks and delectable dishes. \u00a0  We managed to weasel ourselves two barstools to drinks and food. As for drinks since we were at the bar, my friend and I had try Tosca's world famous \"House Cappuccino\" a hot totty if I've ever had one before. It was rich and strong, just like I thought it would be. For the bar bites, we decided to try the roasted beets with pesto, the Frito Misto with clams and prawns, and the grilled polenta with heirloom radicchio. My friend said it best when she declared it was \"one of the best meals\" she's ever had in her life. Quite the high praise Tosca's. I too found Tosca Cafe's menu delightful and rich with flavor and meaning. Star chef April Bloomfield's menu has clearly has a purpose and it's not just geared towards the casual tourist or barfly.   So that's a very good thing. Since the place is so popular now it tends to fill up very fast and gets loud even faster. The place is popular now with locals and tourists alike. In this case, the place is no longer the romantic gem of North Beach. But still I plan on returning in the future, so I can sample their pasta dishes and more of their flavorful bar bites.",

My friend and I showed up for dinner on a Thursday night around 8:30 p.m. - no reservations or anything, and the wait was over an hour. But food is served at the bar, and the bar is first come, first served; we found a couple of seats at the bar and were able to sit immediately.   We had prosecco, the speck and citrus salad, bucatini with guanciale and cauliflower gratin. Both the bucatini and the cauliflower gratin were both so great. The bucatini had some good bite and chewyness and not overly saucy. The cauliflower gratin was rich but somehow you feel okay eating it because it's cauliflower...  I don't find myself in North Beach very often, but if I did, this would be my go-to spot for drinks and bites.",

My friend and I went in on a Tuesday night and I realize that I didn't have a reservation, but we had to wait for over an hour. On a Tuesday night!   Once we were seated, a member of the wait staff brought us water. He was very friendly... at first. When our waiter came to take our order, my friend and I had already had a chance to look at the menu and knew what we wanted. Our waiter read out the specials of the day, and when he had finished, we told him that we were ready to order. He then said to us, \"So I just wasted my breath then.\" RUDE!!! When we told him what we wanted, he asked us if we wanted anything else to go with it, and we told him no but we would let him know if we changed our minds. He was very persistent and weird about telling us multiple times that if we wanted to order anything else, we had to let him know NOW because the food has to all come out together (what he should have said was are you sure you don't want anything else to go with your pasta, the portions are on the smaller side). I don't know what his \u00a0deal was. He then proceeded to walk over to where the host was standing, whisper something in his ear, and then they both turned to look at my friend and me in an obvious way.  Summary of our experience there: WEIRD. Not going back. Ever. Wait staff was weird, not to mention RUDE, food was expensive for such small portions, wait time was long, some of the prices for food was not the same on the menu as online menu.  Most likely will NOT be returning. What a disappointment.",

From all the coverage in the traditional media and the blogosphere, you might have confused the re-opening of Tosca Caf\u00e9 with the Second Coming. \u00a0No, it's just a re-take on an iconic North Beach restaurant / bar. \u00a0  While there are now great food offerings at Tosca Caf\u00e9, the star, as before, is the bar. \u00a0 Isaac Shumway has created a cocktail program based on the classics: \u00a0from the Casino Bar negroni ($12, Beefeater gin, Campari, Antica Formula, and orange peel) to the aptly named suffering bastard ($12, almanac, St. George Terroir gin, pressed ginger, lime, bitters, and soda), they are all good--maybe too good. \u00a0There is a fine selection of wines by the glass and by the bottle, and with Drakes IPA ($8), Borgo oyster stout ($11), as well as other offerings, beer aficionados will not be disappointed.  Chef April Bloomfield's food is almost as good as the drinks. \u00a0The bucatini ($17) with tomato, chili pepper, and guanciale was delicious. While it may not give Zuni Caf\u00e9 a run for its money, the roast chicken for two ($42) is succulent and juicy. However, despite the accompaniments of mushrooms, mascarpone, and parmesan, the grilled polenta ($17) was a little disappointing.   While well-meaning, service was a little confused: servers, bus personnel, hosts, and bar staff need to learn the ins-and-outs of their positions. \u00a0Pacing of courses was a little off, but the timing errors were not egregious enough to destroy the experience.  Buzzing again with life, the all new Tosca does justice to, and improves upon, memories of days past..",

It was honestly like fried bones. pickled veggies - came in a very small teacup, meh. 3 pastas: Bucatini, Rigatoni, Linguini. All of which, were lacking in real depth of flavor.

Fresh and addicting.  2nd course- Bucatini. Wow, the pasta was amazing! The perfect bite and just enough sauce. Highly recommend getting this dish.  3rd course- Whole Roasted Chicken. (Broccoli and Crispy Potatoes as sides) The chicken was so moist! Their marsala sauce was perfect atop the chicken and sides. The crispy potatoes were fried in pork fat- reminded me of my favorite potatoes at Plow except more fatty and fried!  4th course- Tiramisu with orange zest. A perfect end to the meal! There was definitely a lot of rum which we all loved.  As in other reviews of the restaurant, the service was spotty but not entirely horrible. It was tolerable but there were some long pauses in between courses and getting refills of anything.  Overall, a solid 4 stars and definitely want to try their famous \"Cappacuino\" next time.",

    "review_text": "I have to commend the group that did the renovations of Tosca. It still has the classy vintage feel, warm and inviting. It was nice to see the gigantic vintage steamer machine sitting at the end of the bar first thing upon entering. I remembered the old warm cocoa and brandy drinks we had one late afternoon when I came in with out of town friends to escape the cold, foggy, wet mist about two years ago. The bartender back then was an older gentleman, who had lined up about 12 of those cute vintage glasses, which they still use, (Yay) and was filling them with some kind of powder. I remember thinking it looked like nestle quick mix. Back then it felt charming.   Last night, the first time going back there since they reopened, I missed the old gentleman immediately. He doesn't work there any more. The new staff was friendly enough, I love the crisp white jackets they wear, but I found it annoying that the gal bartender was texting in front of me. I must be old fashioned. She recommended I give the house cappuccino a try, and it was so much better than the nestle quick one I remembered. Better than charming. Truly a little piece of heaven and worth the $12.   We did not order any food so I can not comment on that. The 3 star review is because the modern music, which I love in other locations, felt discombobulated in a classy vintage environment. It was later in the evening though and there was a young crowd...I get it. I'm young too, but I wanted the throwback-nod-to-a-more-gentile time, experience. The two person ladies room with the door that locks really sucks. A woman went in and locked the door with just herself in there. Maybe she was sick? Maybe I should say thanks for not letting me hear you do something nasty? Maybe they should take the lock off the door?   I will say the hand soap in there smelled wonderful. I kept smelling my hands all night. I need to eat food before I pass judgment and get too negative. Plan to go back earlier so we can really appreciate the full experience and hope they play some old big band tunes or something like that.",

    "review_text": "Wow....Let me begin by saying,\"After reading several Yelp reviews and the initial vibe I was getting when first entering the restaurant, I was skeptical.\" (When we get caught in traffic driving into the city for 90 min., it's frustrating to arrive just after the restaurant has opened and wonder if we'll get a table - just a personal challenge of mine.) Fortunately, I had the chance to sit at the bar for a bit and unwind before my husband met me. A friendly bartender greeted me and shared the cocktail and wine list...even offered a taste of Italian wine. After he offered to mix me up something special, I requested a margarita. (I know, not very adventurous.) From the alcohol offerings on the menu, I assumed they would have some tasty tequila. Margarita was delicious. Just the right mix of tart and sweetness. The man sitting next to me noted Tosca's bar menu included a very rare Bourbon - $50/glass. Upon checking in with the host, the restaurant has a policy that you cannot be seated until your entire party arrives. Unless there's valet, parking is never easy in SF. As I watched parties arriving, I assumed there was no way we would have an opportunity to be seated in the restaurant without a long wait. Fortunately, my husband really wanted to try this restaurant, so once he joined me, we relaxed at the bar, enjoying drinks and conversation. You often meet friendly and fun people sitting at the bar. We chatted and shared experiences about other nearby restaurants. I began to relax and decided not to stress over the wait. We could always eat at the bar. We ended up being seated in the back of the restaurant. My husband is all about ambiance and atmosphere. He would have preferred to sit in the front and more active area of the restaurant, which gives one a look at the open kitchen, however, it was nice to hear our conversation and check out all the pictures of famous people who we gather frequented Tosca Cafe in the past. Given what we've read in the foodie and SF Magazines, Tosca Cafe has been around forever and the likes of Sean Penn, Mickey Rourke and others, out of sight from the front of the restaurant, played pool and talked late into the night. As we ordered, chatted with Jordan, our server, you could imagine the nostalgia of years past. Our selections included warm rolls, meatballs, grilled polenta, asparagus and clams. The rolls, doused with olive oil, garlic and parmesan cheese came out with the meatballs. OK, so I'm Italian and make meatballs, which I've been told are pretty tasty. I've never had meatballs that were as tender and perfectly seasoned. Amazing flavors. I could have stopped after that course. The polenta was served with delicious mushrooms and the asparagus was grilled and topped with parmesan cheese and almonds - also perfectly seasoned. Finally, I believe it was Manilla clams in a scrumptious tomato, garlic and onion mix that completed our delicious tastings. Desserts looked inviting, however, we were stuffed. It was probably that extra order of garlic rolls. The only comment (and it's not negative) that I offer for people interested in eating at Tosca Cafe, arrive early and together, if you're hoping to get seated in the first round, otherwise prepare for a wait. Tosca does not take reservations. Our very competent and friendly server did say that the rear area of the restaurant can be reserved for larger parties, etc. Tks Jordan for a delightful first experience at Tosca Cafe. We'll return and bring friends.",

The meatball is tender and juicy, but the sauce is the star of the show. Foccacia is humongous, nicely salted and seasoned with rosemary. The buccatini is small, but incredibly rich. The guanciale is crispy and adds a pleasant crunch. Try the linguine and clams, nice and light, again on the small side portion wise, but it's rich. Come for the cocktails, the \"cappuccino\" has no coffee in it. Try the \"dirty\" if you're looking for a coffee buzz. The decor is too dark to snap instagram photos so don't bother.

Over-seasoned, small portions, and checked-out service.  I was with a party of four that started off sharing several small plates to begin, as well as some house cappuccinos all around. Cappuccinos were alright, nothing that I would write home about. We shared meatballs, focaccia, fried artichoke, and the crispy potatoes. Focaccia and meatballs were great, but I will definitely say any sharing of the small plates (antipasti) is best done between two people. You'd need at least two orders of everything we had to constitute a decent serving size per person, even just for an appetizer.  As for the artichoke, I could not taste the mint or oregano for the life of me. The red wine vinegar overpowered any other flavor that could have possibly come through. Crispy potatoes were so crispy they were difficult to bite into by the time they got to our table, and way too salty.  All around we had a decent meal, but if you're going to be touted as one of the best new restaurants in America by such a respected food publication, you had better be ready to deliver on the title.",

    "review_text": "One of the best dining experiences of my life. I went with just my mother, and we definitely got more food than was necessary. But it was so hard to choose what to get because it's an amazing menu. To start we got giardiniera, meatballs, focaccia. For the larger plates we had the skirt steak, lumaconi, and roasted beets. For dessert we shared the dark chocolate sorbetto and a coffee gelato (we might've mixed them like children). For drinks I got a moscow mule and a glass of Vallana Spanna. Every time I began to taste something I would freak out, but I seriously had to try and not make a scene in front of the waitstaff. It's been two weeks since this meal, and I am still thinking about the brussels sprouts in the giadiniera and how they have no bitterness at all and only taste like their pickling juice, which was so subtle and sweet and spicy. Those brussels sprouts are haunting me. The focaccia is by far the best I've ever had. It's lavishly covered in really strong olive oil, it crackles when you bite into it, but it's so warm and doughy. It's also extremely thick for focaccia, and like the brussels sprouts, I can't figure out how they do it. The lumanconi was delicious, probably my favorite, and our waiter said it was the staff's favorite as well. They use the prosciutto ends! PROSCIUTTO ENDS! It's really lemony and the breadcrumbs make it crunch. The steak was cooked perfectly, and came with mushrooms that were just as good as the steak. I swear. They were ridiculously flavorful and meaty and just perfect. It's hard for me to think of words right now because I am recalling all of the great flavors and textures of the food, and I'm becoming lightheaded.   NOT ONLY WAS IT PRETTY MUCH THE BEST FOOD I'VE EVER EATEN... The service was by far the best. My water glass was never even halfway empty, or was it always more than halfway full? Whatever. My glass was always full! I went to the restroom and they refolded my napkin for me. And yes it was formal and professional, but the service didn't lack personality or generosity. They saw how much we were enjoying the food (because we were pretty much screaming), and brought us complimentary potatoes! We had a really nice conversation with our waiter too. The waiters were so nice and somewhat restored my faith in humanity? Yes, maybe. It's also in one of the best parts of the city, and is such a beautiful space. It's pretty much the perfect restaurant and I don't need to go to another restaurant ever again. Thank you, April Bloomfield.",

I would say that the Crispy Pig Tails and the Rigatoni were definitely the standouts of the meal, while the Linguini, Hanger Steak, and Crispy Potatoes left much to be desired. The rigatoni sauce was PERFECT.  The linguini was extremely oily, and didn't have much of a flavor to it save for the clams. The Hanger Steak was cooked extremely well, however also lacking flavor. Unfortunately, the Crispy Potatoes were way too salty for our palettes, and we had to wash it down with a lot of water.

    "review_text": "Expectations is a game people play. No one should expect Tosca to remain the same after such a shift from the old guard to April Bloomfield's team now owning it. And every type of approach to a bar like this is commendable, even more commendable considering that Bloomfield's team saved this place from the unsavory landlord who owns North Beach's notorious strip clubs as he raised the rent with nefarious plans for the space. Take it as a sign of the times for San Francisco, certainly, however the negativity coming straight from the gullet here in these first few fistful of reviews for the new Tosca are pretty unwarranted.   I frequented the old Tosca about one sixtieth as much as Sean Penn use to back in his prime. I use to sit in the back booth and order proper martinis either alone or with a friend, and the most astonishing aspect of the nights was the table service. Rarely do you get such a perfect San Francisco martini at your seat. Guess what... that hasn't changed. Not a bit. They spruced up the place and kept the same red lamp tone of the space. Yes, of course, after the litany of Eater emails in desk jockey inboxes, of course the front of the house is packed every single night as the allure of being a part of the old guard of San Francisco is strong for the new era of this city's polished aristocracy, however effete. I have no qualms at all with the company of parrots paying seven shekels a pint to maintain the possibility that I can linger in one of these booths all night long.   The menu has upped its game to near Spotted Pig levels. Thank you Ms. Bloomfield. The drinks just the same. The House Cappucino remains.   Maybe Yelpers haven't recognized the change as a good thing. If anything, Tosca's increased prices are properly supporting a growing reliance on the service industry. Consider the sky-rocketing cost of living in this city, and Tosca is on par, and no I'm not someone who can afford to be at this place more often than most. In fact, I'm not someone who could afford being at any bar, including the old priced Tosca, more than most. I'm just realistic about how much booze should cost. Yes, there's an immediate urge to defend nostalgia and the abandonment of a lost time. Most of us were never a part of that era. While people complain about the exorbitant costs of a lemon drop, the old guys romanticized of the old days of this city are likely thinking about how charming this city use to be -- when people cared enough to complain about having to step over their brethren on the streets who can barely afford to eat. I really question whether or not their allegiance to the old guard of Tosca is as vehement as they say, or are they riding the wave of disdain of a changing San Francisco?  Money was the motivation to ruin this place into the ground. Money saved it. They could've gutted it and stuffed it with $40 salami. They could be serving $15 martinis like we see in D.C. and Manhattan. Instead, they have integrity. I'll fork over earned dollars to make sure Tosca stays in the hands of those whose allegiance is to Tosca. My expectations for our city remains the same: look hard enough and you find integrity resting in a red booth over a proper martini.",

Service was mixed, starting well but then sliding into neglect. Our server was friendly but then forgot to refill wine and the length between courses got longer and longer. One person's steak took extra time so they comped a dessert.   The food itself was pretty good but very salty. The focaccia bread to start was delicious. I got the radish salad and bucatini which were both good. Others liked their dishes but too salty was a common refrain. The desserts were very one note and surprisingly ordinary. The cannoli lacked any sweetness. The last thing is the wine list which struck me as very expensive.

    "review_text": "I don't understand the 3-star overall rating for Tosca Cafe. Other Yelpers ripped their food for no good reason. However, I think I discovered why after doing some research. Tosca Cafe was taken over by Michelin Star chef April Bloomfield sometime last year. If you're not familiar with Bloomfield, she's a British chef famous for her New York restaurants, The Spotted Pig and The Breslin (both hold a Michelin Star) and for her beatdown of Michael Symon on Iron Chef in 2008 where she still holds the highest score of any challenger (56). I believe a lot of the \"hate\" Tosca is receiving has something to do with her being a New York chef. It's not a secret that SF and NY have an ongoing culinary rivalry. I believe that very element has forced hardcore SF locals to downplay Tosca Cafe. I don't fault anyone for showing pride for their city. In fact, I welcome and encourage it. But it shouldn't prevent people from giving credit when it's absolutely deserved.   Dined here this past Saturday night with 10 other people. We ordered several of each item to share. Before I dive into the dishes, I have to give everyone a heads up - Tosca's portions are very small. Their menu is constructed to encourage you to order four courses (Antipasti, 1st, 2nd and 3rd course with the possibility of sides and desert).   ***ANTIPASTI*** MEATBALLS (Three pre order) ~ $11 ~ 5 stars CRISPY PIG TAILS ~ $9 ~ 5stars FOCCACIA BREAD (Enough for 4 people) ~ 4.5 stars MOSCARDINI (Octopus) ~ $9 ~ 4 stars  ***PASTAS*** BUCATINI ~ $17 ~ 5 stars GEMELLI ~ $16 ~ 5 stars LINGUINI ~ $15 ~ 4 stars RIGATONI ~ $14 ~ 3.5 stars GRILLED POLENTA ~ $17 ~ 3 stars  ***MAIN*** WHOLE ROASTED CHICKEN (1-hour prep time) ~ $42 ~ 3.5 stars  The Meatballs (off-menu item) are to die for. Flavor is on-point and the texture is what you expect from a Michelin Star chef - moist, tender. The Crispy Pig Tails might sound disgusting but it's anything but that. Deep friend to perfection. Imagine combining the best pork rinds you've ever had with little morsels or perfectly cooked, fall-off-the-bone meat. Absolutely amazing. The Foccacia had excellent flavor. A very aromatic bread that went very well with the Meatballs and the sauce it sat in. Moscardini? Never heard of it? It's octopus cooked to an amazing tender texture. Dressed with a simple vinaigrette and you get a winner.   We sampled all their pasta offerings. Don't waste your time on anything else but their Bucatini and Gemelli. The Bucatini had amazing flavor. Imagine macaroni pasta stretched to the length of spaghetti. That's what bucatini is. The sauce had very deep and complex flavors. You can taste all the quality ingredients and the Gruanciale (essentially bacon) really adds another layer of taste and texture. The Gemelli was on-point. It's a type of pasta I never heard of. It essentially looks like two strands of pasta twisted together, each piece about 3/4 of an inch long. The pecorino comes through beautifully and you get a nice subtle black pepper finish.   The roasted chicken was good but not great. However, the sauce was creamy and a tad citrusy. It's perfect with the foccacia.   They have a healthy list of premium cocktails. I tried the Casino Bar Negroni, Suffering Bastard and House \"Cappuccino\". All were very good and well made. The Cappuccino is the perfect way to cap off an awesome dinner. We also brought six bottles of wine. Each one had a standard $25 corkage fee.   The biggest knock I have on Tosca is their service. The staff makes you feel like you're below them. Everything from how they say things to their facial expressions are big turnoffs. It's not the most welcoming place. They did show flashes of courtesy and quality service once in awhile but it's definitely something they need to improve on. Plus, it's nothing several drinks can't take care of. This is one place I'd be happy to return to even though the service was bad. The food was THAT good.   We didn't have reservations. However, our party of 11 only had to wait 45 minutes after showing up around 6:15pm on Saturday. Don't show up any later if you have a bigger party because the place got packed by 7pm.",

The gracious thing would have been to apologize and send out a couple of apps on the house instead of telling the table \"I'm just the messenger\" and pointing out pasta dishes we could order while we wait.",
