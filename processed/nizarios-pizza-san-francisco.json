The slice is pretty big and costs around $4.00  They once had chairs with their tables, but the last time I went (Feb 2011), there were only tables. So, you have to stand and eat your pizza (or take it out to the curb).  The lines can get pretty long when the bars let out so if you're one of those people who hit the bars and get a bite to eat afterwards, I would suggest leaving just a little before the bars close to beat the rush.",

The Nizario's Special is a meaty slice if you so desire. On weekday vegetarian nights for me, a simple slice of pesto just hits the right comforting spots.   Nizario's Pizza is a welcome counterpoint to the heavy pours of Castro bartenders. For that, many a drinking night in the area probably warrants a quick pit stop here before heading home.",

Ordered a Nizario's Special (but substituted the Green Pepper for Black Olive) and I swear it seemed like 15 minutes after I hung up my doorbell rang...like, was the guy already outside with my pizza when I phoned? Seriously though, the delivery was amazingly fast. The pizza was hot and looked great. It definitely hit all the buttons for me, not too much sauce (which yes had a little bit of sweetness to it, but wasn't 'sugary' as was mentioned in an earlier review. GREAT sourdough crust, just the right thickness. Lot's of good coverage with the pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms &amp; olives. (BTW, the sausage is more like the crumbled 'small chunk' variety, versus the bigger hunks. Great flavor, great fast delivery, great value - all good in my book. Would I consider it a 'gourmet' pie, like Pizzeria Delfina or Little Star? No, but that's not why you'd order from a place like this. If you want a good tasting, solid, quick, decent, affordable pizza - I highly recommend Nizario's",

Maybe other Yelpers visit the wrong part of the day, but at night, my slices were consistently piping hot- the cheese soft and gooey, the bacon and pineapple perfectly blending together in saltiness and sweetness. I will have to open my horizons to the other flavors, but the Hawaiian pizza is my #1. There will be a line, but they take orders efficiently, and you will need to stand and eat your pizza.",

Would our teenage heads have exploded? Can a line even be drawn here? Is there any connection?  Here's the thing. I've enjoyed other Nizario's slices. And by enjoyed I mean, I was tanked off of my ass. Juiced. Pixelated. Had you thrown me into a cab before a slice of Nizario's, the cabbie would have just slowed at the nearest corner and rolled me out, tiring of the 20 Questions \"Where The Fuck Do You Live Asshole\" game. But nibble a Nizario's slice and the two fingers of dough, veneer of cheese-like goo and coagulating orange stuff (seriously, I think the foundation is Fake Tan) all work in concert so you get your legs back under you. At least enough so you can stagger home to pass out face down over the covers with your boots on.   But eating this shit sober? I'm sorry. It makes no sense. Use it to patch a draft. Buy some stuff at a craft shop and turn two slices into a pair of groovy flip-flops.  Don't get me wrong, I've had worse and paid for it. But. No thank you.

You might wonder why I'm writing you this letter. \u00a0Well, I have a confession to make. \u00a0I thought it had been a good long while since I had talked to you, so I was ready for that thing you do. \u00a0To my body. \u00a0But since we've slowed down, I've gotten addicted to this thing called Yelp. \u00a0Don't worry; it's not another pizza place. \u00a0But this Yelp makes me do things I normally wouldn't you. \u00a0You of all pizza places should know that when I find something I like, I stick with it. \u00a0Well, Escape from New York Pizza on Castro Street, I was at your corner last week--and I went to Nizario's instead.

I don't know what to say. \u00a0It might be horrible, but I've been honest with you this whole time, and I want to keep being honest. \u00a0Nizario's sucked. \u00a0It's ugly. \u00a0You know I'm not that shallow. \u00a0It's what's inside a pizza place's oven that counts, but you're much more attractive than Nizario's. \u00a0And cleaner. \u00a0And you've got much bigger slices. \u00a0And your toppings--God I miss your toppings.  I even ordered delivery from Nizario's once and they got my order wrong. \u00a0They added pepperoni when I had asked for cheese. \u00a0I know you wouldn't make that mistake; you know I'm a vegetarian. \u00a0You know everything about me. \u00a0And you don't stop accepting credit cards thirty minutes before you close.

First and foremost, when I pay $4.00 for a slice a pizza, I expect a rather large slice of pizza from a \"hole in the wall\" joint. You want to keep me as a customer, don't you? THEN FEED ME. My $4.00 slice was medium sized, but you would think that businesses would step up their game, especially in this economy. I am used to getting a 1/6 of a rather large pizza for around $2.00, so receiving an 1/8 of a pizza for double the cost seems like a rip off!  Whatever. I paid it. Time to sink my teeth into it.   Maybe it was the cold. Maybe it was my altered state. Maybe not many people were eating the same pizza as me (after all, I am a vegetarian and there were pretty much only men in the place, so you KNOW they were all eating the MEAT pizzas), but my pizza tasted like it was under a heat lamp for some time -- not fresh at all. I ate part of the crush of my friend's meat pizza (a part that was not contaminated), and I really tasted the difference between fresh and not-so-fresh. My veg combo pizza was the latter.  The crowd was consistent the whole 30 minutes I was there. There was a crowd of cute Filippino boys who will hella chismis-ing, and I totally entered their conversation and gave them some good comeback lines. Needless to say, they loved me. Duh.  Any who, the place was ok: not dirty nor clean -- it's a walk-thru pizzeria. There is a little area for the pizza sprinkles stuff (Parmesan cheese, chili, salt'n'pepper, whatever) right next to the register, so that made it really easy to decorate my pizza right when I got it -- not like it was fresh though... psh.  I would say something about Nizario's being open late, but I realized that I'm pretty much a grandma when it comes to staying out late, and what felt like 1 am, was really only 10 pm.",

Located right in the heart of the Castro, you can find a line here on many weekends and few parking options. Many patrons, I'm sure, will find other options along with busy corridor of San Francisco, but Nizario's is at least worth one's curiosity.   Here, you have limited options for both meat and veggie lovers. For meat lovers you have your Hawaiian, pepperoni, and a few others. For veggie lovers, you have a cheese, mushroom, all-out veggie, and a pesto as well. The pizza's here are warmed up as you order, and ready-make from hours of prep to meet their peak periods. Please note their pizzas are pan-style, and not thin crust, or deep dish like your Dos Minos folks may push onto you. Here, you get what they have, and that's really it. What they have, however, is quite delicious and simple.   I tried the pesto pizza, which was cooked to perfection. The crust was buttery enough, and the cheese wasn't melting off my plate. I was able to bite in with ease, and taste the subtle flavors of pesto as cheese oozed between my bite and the remaining slice. It was so satisfying, somehow, that I went back for another slice.   If you're in the area, consider all the great options, but also consider Nizario's for their basic and cheap after hour eats.",

    "review_text": "Suffice it to say, the majority of my experience with this place has been when I'm completely hammered off my ass. And every time I come, I have to wade through the sea other other drunkards only to stumble up to the counter and have the dilemma of my life in choosing what type of pizza I want. What I think is great about this place is that no matter what, they will always heat your pizza for you. This is in stark contrast to Pizza Orgasmica, where you have wait in an endless line in a super hot entry way only to be served a thin, cold slice of pizza where the cheese oils have created a congealed layer of disgustingness. (Side note I don't understand why every one raves about that place; the pizza is pretty crappy, particularly if you've had to endure the throngs of drunk, obnoxious Marina-ites in their infinite line). Nizario's is fast, their dough is good (doughy in the middle, slightly crisp on the bottom) and their prices are quite average, which is fine.   Now, I thought that this was simply a drunken revelation; warm, gooey pizza is always delicious when wasted. However, last night, I was shown that this place is pretty damn good sober. Maybe it was because I was starving and had had a really shitty day, but nevertheless, it was yum. And, for the first time in my experience, it was empty. I guess all the drunks were waiting until later to invade(although, it was already near 10). Try the Castro special: spinach, feta, chicken, and pesto. mmmmm. Or the super combo, which basically has everything on it. I'm not saying this is the best pizza in the world, but it hits the spot when you need it. Major plus: the people working there are super friendly, even when you're near belligerent.",

I never really sat down and ate IN Nizario's, but during the day looks like they have a few places to sit and eat, night time always to crowded to tell, but loooove the pizza!",

    "review_text": "Castro pizza is a very personal thing. Between Marcello's, Escape from NY and Nizario's, everyone has their favorite. (Guess which one isn't mine?)  Most of us eat it when we're blitzed in the wee hours of the morning, and Nizario's has the benefit (or rather, the strategy) of being open later than most. I've been here many times, and while the pizza is decent, it just isn't my favorite in the 'hood. The crust is so doughy, and the per-slice price isn't really that great of a deal.   Four drinks in I'll eat here in a pinch, but at that point it's not really about getting great pizza, is it?",
