However, the main bartender dude is very weird with drivers licenses. The first time I went my friend had just gotten his CA license and still had his old one - but it had a hole in it and he didn't bring his paperwork - ok understandable - its his fault for not bringing the temporary CA paperwork, so he was not let in.  The 2nd time I went in here - this happened AGAIN with another friend - but he had actually brought his CA papers - you know the ones the DMV tells you that you can carry around temporarily until your actual license came in as well as his old license. The bartender still would not let this guy order drinks - how ridiculous!  I'd still go back because its a fun bar - but too stressful for those kind of unnecessary confrontations.",

And I really love you, Laurie, vivacious bride of said Mark. Both are from the New England area, I believe. Or maybe they just like the Red Sox. But if you like the Red Sox and live in San Francisco, then you must be from New England. Yeah, that makes sense. These two are the coolest vegetarian bar owners I know of. Well, the only vegetarians that I know of that own a bar.  I knew this place existed. Hell, I pass by here every so often. Just never went in for a drink. Until one night after work, a bunch of co-workers dragged me with them on their drinking adventures. I was game, thinking what can go wrong? I live in the North Beach area so I can stumble home no prob if I got sloshed. Funny thing is I was freaking buzzed that night. I remembered everything that happened. I know I went home to sleep for an hour because I had another shift in said hour. And I know I woke up late for work. The funny part is I actually clocked in on time...Anyone wanna try to explain that to me?  Anyways, the bar has a great atmosphere along with great bartenders. Nick and Nick are awesome. I know there are others but I always somehow end up with either Nick or Mark. The jukebox is internet ready so they have fresh music along with some moldy oldies that go great with too much drinking. And North Beach pizza knows where this place is in case you wanna go and order a pizza instead of walking a couple of blocks to Safeway to buy something cheaper. Oh, and if you ever have a need for a taxi, they have them memorized for you and will call them as well. Courtesy service at its best.  So Red Jack, you ROCK! Even though I am in the Sunset now, I will be back to conquer your bar in due time...Like after major surgery...Alcohol and surgery don't really mix well...",

Just hit the Red Jack and you'll be pleasantly surprised (and well taken care of).  We made the mistake of going to a bar on Pier 39 for a beer on Saturday night, just because there weren't many other options we were aware of. After paying over $10 for two Coronas (!!!), I got on my iPhone and looked on Yelp for other options. Turns out The Red Jack was only about three blocks north of the pier and thankfully outside the touristy area.   The Red Jack has great \"curb appeal,\" as it's located on the ground floor of an old apartment building. Inside, it has lots and lots of charm. We sat right at the bar and were very happy to learn that the beer special of the day was Widmer Hefewiesen draft for $3 a glass! \u00a0Being from Portland, where Widmer is brewed, (and which also happens to be one of our favorites) this was indeed a nice surprise.   The bartender was a very nice young woman who took good care of us. She was friendly and engaged us in conversation throughout the night. The bar has a dartboard, pinball machine, a great Internet enabled jukebox (so you can request just about any song), and a bunch of board games you can take up to the bar (which we did).  Another nice surprise was the OTHER drink special of the night, which was the house Bloody Mary for $4.25. I'm not a big bloody mary drinker, but this one was really good and quite spicy. I may be hooked.  The bathrooms were small but clean. They have a nice outside patio with a wall painted to look like Fenway Park's \"Green Monster.\" It was a bit too chilly to sit out there, but it was an appealing space.  Unfortunately, we found out last night that the Red Jack is in danger of closure due to complaints from neighbors about noise. What kind of jerk moves to a neighborhood with a long-established bar like this one then is surprised that there's \"noise.\" Idiots. Anyway, hopefully the RJ's loyal local clientele can save the place. It's a gem.",

Moron female bartender cards us all. \u00a0Ok, I get it , following protocol. No big deal. We are all well into our 30s and on.  One of my friends from Greece hands her ID- written CLEARLY in ENGLISH and Greek with her picture on it. \u00a0Female bartender \"Oh. I can't accept that. I need a passport. I can't accept that ID.

You can see it if you can actually read English and have some semblance of a brain.

So that you can actually return home. Never, ever heard of this policy before. Anywhere.   But, dive bar bartender probably has never been outside of CA, so she doesn't know that.   So, we left. And went to Cigar Bar and spent lots of money and had a great time until 2am. Oh, they carded us too.   Your loss, Red Jack Saloon. No wonder it was empty inside.   Hope the owner reads this.

The bar was filled with festive, fun Halloween decorations and lots of Red Sox and Patriots paraphernalia (a Boston fan we were with and I were excited!). The drink special of the night was $3 Red Stripe beers. So for 4 pints of beer, one vodka-pineapple, and one cosmo, the total was only $21. I love cheap drinks!!! They also have great drink specials every night- margarita Monday's, rum cocktail Tuesdays, and so on...  We found a table and so many fun games. Immediately, we started in on our own Connect Four tournament then Jenga then darts. Fun!   The bar was not too packed but definitely had its fans. Also, the girls' bathroom was kind of interesting in a fun way (but you'll have to see for yourself what I mean...).

My personal favorite is Margarita Monday, which has margaritas for $5.50. They have a ton of beer on tap and in bottles, and I never have to lean over the bar and/or wait 20 minutes to get one. The bartenders are friendly, on a first name basis with many of their patrons, and they serve drinks fast.   I love to hole up in a corner and play connect-4 (they have a big basket of games for people to play in the back), or kick my boyfriend's ass at darts. The only downside is that there's no music unless you want to pay for the jukebox, and sometimes you get stuck listening to someone's awful drunken music taste for an hour.   Cheap, fun, and relaxed.

And in the unlikeliest of locations (1.5 blocks from my house) and far from anywhere that anyone not living in North Beach would ever travel to.  Once, I took a friend here for some 21st birthday pre-drinking. Within twenty minutes of her actually turning 21 (yes, 12:20 AM) the entire bar was buying her shots and by 1:00 AM she was out on the sidewalk throwing up. (Yes, it was supposed to be a pre-drinking destination but we never made it any farther).   To this day I don't think she forgives me.   (It probably doesn't help that sometimes when I'm walking by, I take a picture of the sidewalk where she was hurling with my camera phone and send her reminder pictures.)  Gotta love the Red Jack!",

The place bleeds Green (Celtics) and red (Sox) and gold &amp; black (Bruins).  The drinks are cheap and strong and the bartender was nice and attentive... granted it was a quiet Sunday afternoon. The bar was fully stocked and had drink specials.  There are plenty of tv's, games like darts you can play and the crowd looks like a mix of locals, workers from the area, and tourists. Overall it seems homey and a fun place to watch a game (I happen to bleed Green :)  The restrooms did NOT smell like yak (as stated by previous reviewers) but the carpet in the front area DEFINITELY did! Or something in there did. You know that musty, wet bar floor, 1,000 year old carpet smell? Well its there. And its not nice. But if you can get past that everything is else is cool about this place.  I'll be back definitely... especially with playoffs around the corner!",

If you ever wondered where all those really cool and relatively unknown dive bars are hiding.... Well I just discovered one the other night. The selfish part of me was reluctant to write this review for fear of letting the secret out..... but since I love you yelpers so much I decided to share.   because sharing is caring. and i care. \u00a0  Ok I lied... a little. I didn't exactly find the Red Jack Saloon myself.... a friend is in town right now visiting from boston and he actually found it. after pre-drinks at michelle's we headed out to fishermans wharf to watch the Sox game. The first thing I said when I walked inside was, \"huh? No f'ing WAY is a bar this perfect in fishermans wharf!\" \u00a0  Its certainly not my usual cup of tea..... but i knew i had stumbled upon something really good. Its very low key and you can almost feel the history pouring out of the walls.   The best feature to me was nice local vibe. Everyone we met knew each other already.... And when we walked in, we instantly became a part of their family. We were there on Wednesday which they call \"Whatever Wednesday\".... Meaning whatever drink the bartender chooses that night (he gave us 3 options) is $3.50   yes $3.50-- all night long. way CHEAP! I picked the rum. naturally.  They also have darts.... Or as my boston friend called it \"daahts\". \u00a0  Then, there's a jukebox-- YAY! And just when you thought it couldn't get any better.... They have a great little outdoor patio are in back for smokers. The entire back wall is painted like the Green Monster so you feel like you're sitting in Fenway Park.  And speaking of cool...... one of the regulars here is a former inmate of Alcatraz. Yes, its true. His name is Darwin Coon and he was an inmate there from 1959 to 1963. yes i asked, he was in for bank robbery. We were trying to get him to tell us some good prison stories but the Sox game was on and we had our priorites...... anyway, he was a nice old guy and when he left I actually gave him a big hug. See what a little rum will do? Here's a great story about him: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfgate.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Farticle.cgi%3Ff%3D%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2000%2F08%2F14%2FMN88235.DTL&amp;s=f518baf9e8c2b2a7d51085c06ec2149779cfa6b96a0985c33da04a4cbde775bc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sfgate.com/cgi-bin/artic\u2026</a>  Really, how much more do you need? Red Jack Saloon has \"daahts\", a jukebox, red sox fans, a smoking patio with the green monster, cheap drinks, Alcatraz inmates and a lot of history..... i for one \u00a0will be back. in fact, its been awhile since i've done this but....yes i think a little Yelp outing here might be in order. stay tuned",

The special drink of the day \u00a0runs around $3, but other drinks are priced pretty normally (about $7 for a mixed drink). There is one dart board, three or four big screen TVs, and that about sums it up.  I know other people are yelping that this is a \"hidden gem,\" but, honestly, I don't see the hoopla.

The bouncer explained the policy as we pleaded with him to just allow an exception using my Canadian DL. He wasn't too rude.   Standing next to me was a man eavesdropping.

A quick Google Maps search for \"Dive Bar\" leads me 3 blocks to Red Jack Saloon, and what a bulls-eye that was.  The bartender was friendly, welcomed us, and took our drink orders as soon as we were ready. We all started with delightfully stiff vodka sodas for $4 a piece, a pretty unbeatable price in the city. I eventually switched to my favorite Belgian beer (Palm) that I was so surprised and pleased to find stocked here, also for $4 a piece.  The place is small, quiet, cozy, good dive-y atmosphere. We grabbed a table by the front window to visit and were really comfortable the whole night.

Ambiance: A local neighborhood dive bar that knows everyones name comes through the doors. Homey feel as I can say that you can even make it your home. At night the brightest spot on the block. I notice that they've no 49ers of anything I thought I was in DC. Come to think of it the 49ers next game is against the redskins.   Staff: Big guy at counter knows my friend and they talk about the up coming game my friend is from DC. I was sitting there without a drink because I didnt want one as it was getting late plus I have to work. Finally he gave me some water I said thanks and told him he I was with his buddy. He said why didn't you say so I thought you was an tourist.   Cleanliness: It's a dive bar didn't expect much but it's pretty clean. I was surprise that this place was more clean than a restaurant lounge.  Eats: N/A  Punch Line: Local bar,Redskin diehards,dart board,jukebox,finger food (mostly apps),easy street parking after 6pm.  Final Thoughts: Good thing I came here with my friend after all these times droving by here never thought about stepping in. So I met bartender and learn it's an Redskin hangout so this coming up game I probably will not be here with my bright red Gore jersey on. Lastly it's a fine place here no one cares how you are or do as long as you spend so money on drinks.",

They also have a bunch of board games and dice, if you are so inclined. I love the back smoking patio. With lattice walls and picnic tables and benches, it's a great place to kick it and smoke and drink and shoot some craps. I also am dying to steal the giant Deschutes bottle cap and bottle opener that are mounted on the wall. If anyone's willing to do it in exchange for a night of debaucherous drinking, hit me up. They have a fairly good beer selection at Red Jack, better than most of the other bars I've been to in SF, with actually like five or six beers on tap, as opposed to three AND they have Inversion IPA from Deschutes which impressed me. If you haven't guessed by now, Deschutes is one of my favorite breweries. I paid like four-fiddy for a pint, reasonable, I guess. \u00a0The location's cool, too and Red Jack has a real cozy, kind of down-home vibe to it that makes time really fly when you're there.",

Sooooo, when some co-workers of mine broached the subject of watching Kobe Bryant whoop dat ass in North Beach this evening, the idea of checking out the action at Red Jack was born. Little did I know, though, that this spot was a well-known Boston bar! Arrrrrrgh! Had I known that, I'd have opted to listen to the game with a strung out trucker named Gil over a CB Radio along the dusty roads of Barstow. But hey... I was already there with some good company (meaning the people I came with), so I really had no other option but to stick it out.  The bar itself wasn't all that bad, but if you're not a fan of Boston sports, you might be pretty annoyed. I guess you have to give credit to those jerks for having relatively good sports teams and being passionate about their city... so I can't knock 'em too hard... but seriously, do you have to be sooooo obnoxious? I mean, they were cursing at The Joker fer Christ sake! There's no reason to bad mouth Jack Nickelson just because he's sitting court side at the Staples Center, right? What about Chris Rock and David Spade?!?! Anyhoo, I digress....  The bar has some pretty decent drink specials, which made up for the rowdy, potty mouthed fans. Though not reinventing the wheel by any means, tonight was \"Thirsty Thursday,\" which meant we were privy to $3.50 well cocktails for the entire evening. They have a chalk board with the rest of the week's bargains, but I was too busy being sprayed with saliva by a rotund gentleman with a thick accent and a faux-vintage green Celtics shirt from Urban Outfitters to soak it all in. But even though I wasn't able to take notes, I'm willing to bet the incentives would leave me with no option but to return at a later date.   They threw in some free hot dogs for the entire bar, so that was a pretty nice treat (if you like manufactured meat byproducts, that is) so even if you're a sports fan in the minority, you have to respect the generosity. If you despise Boston sports, however, you may want to wait until all of their teams have the day off. Just sayin'.",

    "review_text": "So after my horrible experience at Butterfly, we decided to trek towards N.beach for some hopefully better bloody mary experiences. \u00a0On our way down Bay, we noticed this bar in a unusual area of town - not much else around at all.   We were there pretty early and there was only a couple older locals in the place. \u00a0Seemed like a nice local/sports bar. \u00a0I noticed ingredients to make a bloody mary on the bar, so I 'thought' I was in luck  ******Bloody Mary Review***** After I order a BM, the bartender grabs a quick pour filled with pre-mixed BM. \u00a0First sign things were not going well, since I knew he could have obviously made me one fresh. \u00a0He \u00a0sipped a small amount himself to make sure it tasted good. \u00a0Well I realized that after tasting mine, this guy didn't know what \u00a0a good bloody mary tasted like at all, since what I got was HORRIBLE!!!! \u00a0It not only didn't taste good, it actually tasted bad. \u00a0  So I will likely not go back. Any bartender should at least know what tastes awful and refuse to serve me something that tasted that horrible. \u00a0  It might be a good bar at night, it did seem like it had potential, but I most likely wouldn't recommend the need to travel to this area of town just to go.

We came in it was half way full and the Bartender welcomed us and we had a seat. We ordered some cocktails and we stated conversation with some of the locals that frequent the place.   Everyone is friendly, Northeast fun attitude. Mark the bartender has a funny remark every couple words that will cracked you up. Some of the patrons are young and talk alot of smack that makes you laugh. I swear I thought I was at a place like cheers. Everyone knows each other and if you are new everyone introduces themselves. We met the Laurie, Mark's better half. She was very nice and accommodating.   Thanks for the hospitality. One of our new places to hang out on a Fri after 5pm...   Keep serving great spirits...",
