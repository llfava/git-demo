One person in our group got the wings - so good you didn't even need the sauce and very meaty. I shared some Chicken Tenders - made fresh from scratch, well seasoned, and perfect for dipping in their many sauce selections. Buffalo and Pomegranate BBQ were definitely the best! After our meal, the chef came out to check on us and see if we had any feedback for the food.  Great experience for a sports bar. Clean, good food and drink and plenty of games. Highly recommend and will be back for more games and chicken!",

CONs: \u00a0This place was not open til a few minutes before noon. I get noon is its regular open time but the Conference Championship games happen on one day out of the entire year. Score! should definitely know this and open a couple hours early if it wants to pass itself off as a sports bar. Having TVs and knowing which channel is ESPN does not a sports bar make. Because there were no other sports bars around, I ate at Little Szechuan across the street that was (1) open and (2) had the game on its TVs. Good job, Chinese restaurant.  Hopped over to Score! after it opened. Staff was setting up tables, chairs and cleaning up through the 2nd quarter. My friend complained the place reeked of bleach because clorox was being used to clean surfaces.   PROs: \u00a0Did have audio of the game on. That is very important to me. There are a lot of TVs so you'd get a good view of a, if not multiple, TVs anywhere. The staff works hard and tries to get your order to you AQAP.  Conclusion: \u00a0If the game was at 3pm, I wouldnt have any complaints. Definitely open to coming back if circumstances so dictate. Not a go-to and won't go outta my way to come here. Business needs to be more savvy if it decides it wants to be a sports-viewing destination in a city with hundreds of them.",

Just a note to the event marketers: please be more specific about the address on the flyers/online ads. It took us a few loops up and down the street to locate the host bar.  From what I remember, once you get past the property bouncer, the beer games are in a separate space behind the bar you see when you walk in. (The whole place is pretty dark.) There's another bouncer at a podium, who is there to take your money as a participation fee. Then you're on your own, or so it felt like. We were completely confused as to how the whole thing worked. There was no explanation, just a number given to us at some point that corresponded to a table where we would team up with others. It got even more confusing to read and explain the rules of each game from a tiny sheet of paper. Given that a large percentage of the crowd was international and were that the majority of the people just wanted to drink, by the second or third round no one paid attention to completing actual games, let alone play by the rules and keep score. At the beginning, you're encouraged by the bartenders to a bunch of Pabst beers. It's cheap, but we still felt coerced into spending too much on unfinished alcohol--we ended up leaving after it was obvious the games were going nowhere.  It was a cool/fun place to meet a bunch of different people, but from an event standpoint, it was poorly organized. Upon walking out we caught a glimpse of the food and drink menu in the main bar. It looked okay, but who knows when we'll be back in town to give this place another shot.",

Good TV's and great variety, they had 5 different games on. \u00a0I've only been here once but so far it deserves 5 stars.",

    "review_text": "I went to ther Gin Mill with a group of friends to grab a few drinks and got such a suprise. Not only were the drinks really affordable, and plentiful, but there were so many different baseball and basketball games on , everyone in our group got to see what we wanted. The other customers in the bar were great, all drinking, talking and just having a great time. The music was a mix of newer stuff with some 80's classics and the staff was unbelivable, not only in getting all of us all drunk (the shots flowed like water), but they were frindly and good looking. If you want a fun place to hang out with friends, drink, catch some games, drink some more and look at attractive patrons and staff then you need to visit Score! Bar and Lounge!!",

The main event here though is the Beer Olympics. It's located in another part of the bar but everyone is having a ball. There also is billiards and big screen TV's. I hear they play the big games every weekend. Def a good place to come meet nice people and come out with friends for a casual but fun night out near all the strip clubs on Broadway! Stephanie served us tonight and she is great! Come see her! I will recommend this place and come back with a bigger group, \u00a0they have the place. \u00a0Last thing! \u00a0They have a good play list!",

Shows that management truly knows how to train their employees, to provide the best customer service in the Bay Area! Definitely going back.",
