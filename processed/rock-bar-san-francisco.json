It's no secret that I love a good dive bar with a quirky theme, and when you throw in a gaggle of handcrafted cocktails into the mix, it makes it even better.   Not only can you get down on cheap, shitty American beers and craft variations from breweries all around the Bay Area, but you can sip on their version of a martini (Dirty Metamorphic - Dirty Tito's martini with muddled Fresno chilies), something strong, yet delicate for the ladies (Basil Mudstone - Templeton Rye, Pineau, basil, lemon, and white tea), and something noteworthy that'll go viral among your circle of friends (Fire in the Hole - The above-referenced shot-and-a-beer special with Schlitz, Bulleit bourbon and complimentary charcuterie). All of their signature elixirs are quite tasty ( and named after gemstones), but if you want something a bit more traditional, they'll be happy to whip up a classic Manhattan or a Sazerac as well.  If your'e feeling hungry, word is you can order fried chicken from Front Porch right across the street (they own the bar). Talk about the best bar bites ever, huh? If you've yet to enjoy a greasy piece of their renowned fried chicken, you haven't lived!",

I got the Ichi Rock which is a gin and yuzu cocktail, and then their play on a whiskey sour, the winter sour. The sour was so warming and spiced, I felt like I should have been sitting by a fire.   Idk, it was a Saturday night and it was chill as hell. I'm smitten.   By the way, I walked in and a cat greeted me and proceeded to steal my heart. And also a bar stool.

I heard you can order bites, and they will deliver from Front Porch across the street.

Refreshing.   * Real Thunderberg ($9) - 1 STAR: Four Roses, Bunderberg Ginger, Underberg. Tastes like medicine.  * Rhuby Mule ($10?) - 3 STARS: Vodka, Cherry Heering, ginger ale, rhubarb bitters. Love moscow mules but this cherry version was way too sweet for me.   * Soft Rock ($10?) - 3.5 STARS: Lillet Blanc, soda, lemon, cucmber. Refreshing and tasty.   * ICHI Rock ($10) - 3.5 STARS: London Gin, St. Germain, Yuzu, grapefruit bitters. This was another one that reminded me of Mike's Hard Lemonade. Super refreshing and tasty but not the type of cocktail I gravitate towards. Too frou frou for me.

The atmosphere was chill and mostly people in their 30's were around which is quite fine by me.  The bartender came over and told us about the mixed drinks. Somehow he appropriately mentioned that there's a discount if it happens to be your birthday and lo and behold it was the lady's B-day (hence the dinner at La Ciccia).  The drinks were expertly done and the bartender kept coming back to see if we were ok which I appreciated. There was only one of the TVs playing quietly in the corner which was perfect. The rain and the atmosphere didn't really call for a bunch of big screens blasting. Just a really cozy bar.

It still scarcely makes sense to me as I'm walking into a building that probably served up about a million fifty-cent Budweisers in a past life. Once you're inside, though, it's clear that you're about to tangle (or tango) with a legitimate establishment.  The manhattans are great. The negronis are great. Weird stuff that they made up (like the Donkey Show) are, surprisingly, also great. Definitely worth checking out if you like expertly made cocktails or a laid-back atmosphere.",

First it comes in a fitting rocks glass and not in a foofy martini contraption thats both uncomfortable and looks decidedly uncool, unless you're doing the whole secret agent thing.  Second its served on the rocks - which is what makes it sbagliato - and may cause a purist to take away points, but in this reviewer's opinion - actually enhances the original drink.  Third RB's negroni has a subtle yet distinct smokey fragrance and flavor which takes already properly tasting (neither at all sweet nor harshly bitter) negroni to the next level.   ** proper sbagliato = proper broken/bungled/wrong/incorrect. Not sure that its proper because in Negroni follows the formula of gin, sweet vermouth and Campari, with an orange peel garnish. Negroni Spagliato replaces the gin with a dry sparkling wine, and requires to be served on the rocks, according to some sources, but according to others - all it takes is addition of ice.  PS i dont remember the last bar where music was (forget good) not annoying - but at RB it is decidedly awesome (in both selection, and perfectly not imposing volume) at least it was on one Thursday night 4/9/14. This little detail is what brings this gem of a bar over to the 5 star level",

We managed to squeeze in at the end of the bar, and snag the last two seats.  Even though it was busy, and there was only 1 bartender, drinks came quickly.His efficiency was pretty amazing to watch. He also managed to be pleasant and friendly, despite being slammed.He even checked to see if we liked our drinks.  After it cleared out a bit, the bartender came over, and we asked for recommendations. Based on what we said we liked ,he made us both some interesting cocktails. My drink was perfect, and highlighted the ginger flavor I'm into right now. It had some unique ingredients in it, and I was really happy with it. My husband liked his, but not as much as I liked mine. Their cocktail menu seems well thought out and definitely has some different drinks than I've seen.  This is a great bar, but be advised, it's ***CASH ONLY.*** Not a fan of that.",

Okay, back to the real business. It is a new bar that is not quite swarmped with hipster yet, and it should stay that way. A short list of special cocktails at $9 each, this place is following the cocktail trend. Most of those cocktails are good, not spectacular, but my boyfriend didn't really like one of the drink and the bartender gladly replaced it with a beer. They have Abita on tap, out of 8 that were availible.  There is a pool table, and if it is not crowded, you can squeeze in a game or two. It is not a really big bar.  Over all, it is a good place to chilled with friends if you are in this part of town. Nothing worth traveling to.",

On the heels of a dashing dinner at nearby ICHI, we made our way to Rock Bar for that one last cocktail. He drank a Manhattan, she sipped on the Earnest Diamond, and both shared the same small bench.   There's a certain aesthetic that keeps me in a bar longer than I'd usually stay - an arcane coziness; a strange brand of delicious anticipation (maybe this night could be the best one yet?). Mismatched glassware. Delicately vintage votive holders cradling subdued punctuations of light. Whispers and secret smiles and a room full of beginnings. Rock Bar brings together an attractive collection of irregularities yet somehow, it's such a harmonious space. Really lovely.  Maybe most importantly, the cocktails are good... very good, even!

There is a dive bar element interiorly speaking, but there is something about the tranquility that lends itself to a steady and easy ambiance. This doesn't feel like a place I'd bring 20 of my friends to, but rather a spot where I'd catch up on some conversation with close ones while imbibing with the best of them.  Speaking of drinks, the Manhattan is the real deal. Strong without squinted reactions, potent enough to keep the flow and the vibe going. The Winter Sour also gets a nod in the grand scheme of drinks in their lineup, and the Ichi Rock also has me smitten. Whether it's bourbon, gin, vodka, or tequila based, there is a little something in it for everyone.  The prices aren't as steep as the rest of San Francisco cocktail spots. Friendly bartenders and a seasonal selection of cocktails means I'll be back soon enough for more. Bringing good company while thirsty is highly encouraged.",
