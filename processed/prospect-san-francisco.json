We arrived fashionably early for dinner and had plenty of space before the crowd started rolling in.   Starter: Wagyu Beef Tartare was excellent!   Main:   - Liberty Valley Duck = I had to ordered this because one can never get tired of duck meat.   - Chef's Special Pork = took a bite from my partner who ordered this, but I can't quite remembered if I liked it or not.   Dessert: Banana Cream Pie Sundae = the banana pudding was impeccable! This was probably my favorite dish throughout the night.  Overall, I enjoyed my dinner with great company. Service was on point and attentive.   p.s. The restroom seem like a mile walk away from the restaurant...why?",

You see people celebrating birthdays and other special occasions because every once in awhile it's ok to eat somewhere really nice and spend all your money. \u00a0  We ordered the scallops and quail as starters. I thought the scallops were cooked perfectly, seared just enough so it was still soft and succulent. Quail was breaded so it had a nice crispy crust. I generally don't like quail because it's lean and often dry but it was juicy and delicious here.   For entrees we went with the New York strip and the pork chop. The steak was cooked medium when my date wanted it medium rare and it was on the salty side. \u00a0The pork chop was perfect. \u00a0It was a thick cut and so even though the crust was a bit salty it was a balanced bite.   We also ordered a few drinks. One was a tea infused bourbon which I thought was delicious. \u00a0I also tried the brandy and apple cocktail which I thought was a bit sweet.  Service was great. \u00a0Food was great. \u00a0Ambience was great. It was a really nice evening. The portions were a bit small given the price. 4.5 stars.",

The wine list is expansive and we opted for a mix of wines from Cali including a great Pinot and a decent Cab.   Food wise it was excellent. I read on chefsfeed that we should try the fries, which are only on the bar menu. The server said she could sub them in.  I started with a buffalo mozzarella ravioli appetizer with tomatoes and such on it. It was a special, but it was very well executed. Highly recommend it! The main I got a skirt steak, which normally can be a bit tough but it was perfectly cooked and really excellent. The fries were actually not all that, but I would still come back.  Good spot.",

The calamari was tiny portions and skimpy for what it was and left us wanting more. \u00a0 I had a tough time finding a vegetarian plate that was appealing for a main and the risotto with truffle butter was amazing and the chef was kind enough to make me a side dish of brussel sprouts that were delicious. \u00a0  Our friend had the chicken and sausage which was ample portioned and he loved it. \u00a0Two of us had the black bass and lobster special which was really over priced for the portion - 3oz of fish and a nugget of lobster about an inch or two long. My girlfriend is teeny tiny and isn't a huge eater and she was left feeling unsatisfied - as in still a bit hungry. \u00a0My husband felt same. \u00a0We had a great bottle of wine and split one dessert. \u00a0  The bill game and it was way over what you'd expect for what we ordered and what we received. \u00a0In other words - value for price, way way off. \u00a0What made it worse was our server couldn't have been bothered. \u00a0She never came back to ask how we liked our dishes - not once, after any course, didn't make eye contact and was just off her game; perhaps we should have known once the cocktail order got forgotten. \u00a0  We are foodies, eat out a lot, eat all over the world and have no problem paying amply for a great meal. It's not the dollars - it's when the dollars don't feel like they delivered what you paid for. \u00a0Service was a 1; meal was good but portions off - it felt like Prospect was more about hip vibe which is icing on the cake - the restaurant fundamentals need to be there and they were off last night. We won't write this place off and will go back but with all the options n SF we were bummed by the experience. \u00a0I agree w/ Jay C. that this place is way better than Boulevard whose menu got too complex and didn't deliver. \u00a0Nadeem says it best though when she says 'it's just sort of there.'",

    "review_text": "The first night in SF, we tried eating at Hogs. However, because of parking issues, we gave up and on a whim decided to come here instead. We were super lucky to get a table for 5 as the restaurant was packed, but we were seated immediately after our full party arrived on a friday night.  After sitting down, we waited on my friend before ordering. The menu is pretty small, only one page and straight to the point. We ended up getting a bunch of appetizers and a few entrees to share, and the server was very insistent that we got two of everything. It was to the point where we felt like she was pushy.... was not too happy about that. We had told her we wanted to just order first and get more if we were still hungry, but she didn't really give us that option. Anyways, on to the food.  Half Dozen Shigoku Oysters, 21- The oysters were very fresh and had a light marination. It was a great start.   Belgian Endive &amp; Roquefort Cheese Salad, pears, pomegranate seeds, hazelnut brittle, pickled herbs, charred pear vinaigrette, 14- the salad was interesting yet good. The hazelnut brittle was my favorite part, and it was slightly fruity which was a great combination.  Maine Lobster Pyramid Ravioli, golden chanterelle mushrooms, melted leeks, lobster nage, 17- this was one of my favorites. Loved the foam sauce, it really added a lightness to the ravioli. The put the chanterelle mushrooms on the side of the dish, which I thought was kind of random.  American Kobe Zabuton Carpaccio, shaved perigot truffles, pntarelle, peccorino, lemon aioli, baby greens, 18- this was my absolute favorite. The meat was marbled and super tender, and the truffles on top of the meat was amazing. Definitely recommend this dish!   Roasted Berkshire Pork Chop, cabbage, baked potato puree, marble potatoes, apple and quince relish, pork jus 32- The pork was very succulent and tender; it was definitely one of the better pork chops I've had. Great entree.  Pan Roasted Organic Chicken Breast &amp; House Made Chicken Sausage, lentils, foie gras,winter mirepoix, nettles, celery root puree, and rich chicken jus. 25- I dont know what's up with organic and not being as good, but this chicken was not that good. Kind of dry and bland. I didn't even taste the foie gras (maybe I didnt get it because it was a shared dish), but after eating one bite of the dish, I was like uhhhh... no. Stay away from this dish.  We also ordered a few drinks; I got the barrel-aged chocolate spiced negroni, which was too strong for my taste, but it was made well.  Overall, our bill came out to be around $240. The food for the most part was delicious, and the service was good (besides the pushy incident). Very glad I got to try this place while in SF, thanks to the really nice hostess!",

Atmosphere is nice more on the professional side I felt, so definitely a place to take a client or have a lunch meeting . We were greeted at the front by a very smiley hostess, then were seated to the main dining room where we were handed the menu. I already had my eyes set on several items when checking the website, however it was on the Bar Menu, which is only available at yes, the bar. The bar menu is a specific menu filled with small plate items and only available at the bar from 5pm - close, this is not the Happy Hour Menu, although they do have that at a set time as well. The main dining room menu had great choices for main dishes, but we were more interested in trying several different dishes to share instead of eating one big dish each. So we politely asked if it was ok to move to the bar area and was replied with, \"It is your dining experience so feel free to sit wherever you would like\". We were pleased and very thankful of his response, cause in all honesty we felt very naggy at that point. We were moved over to the bar area, which wasn't bad, had a roomy table with view of the dining room. The only thing we found weird is that the bar area was not as loud as the dining area, where as typically it would be vice versa.   Started off with the drinks, found the drink choices to be more on the manly side; no cosmos, mojitos, or anything girly. One of my girlfirends even said that their drinks seem like it would put some hair on your chest. After eying the cocktail menu, decided on the Il Terranova: Botanical Vodka, Cynar, Cucumber, Agave Nectar, and Lime. Thought it would be refreshing and light, however it came out to taste somewhat like I was drinking whisky. Then we ordered, and ordered a lot and to be honest it was really hit or miss and to the extreme. Some dishes were either really good or really ehhhh.   To the food:  Ahi Tuna Tartare - Hit: This was one of the faves of the table, fresh with a little kick due to Jalapeno and Black Siracha Pork Belly Fries - Miss: Not what we expected coming out. We ordered thinking it would be sliced pork belly, mocking the shape of fries or pork belly w/a side of fries. It was actually minced pork belly and kimchee sprinkled on top of thick cut fries. This was disappointing because the fries were the main attraction but the least wanted. What we did try of the pork belly was really good, however not enough of.  Crispy Squash Blossoms - Hit: 2 squash blossoms with a couple fried green beans. Squash blossoms were light, yet very crispy which I liked.  Mushroom Arancini - Miss: We were told they were out of, so asked if we would like to opt for the crab cakes. Sure!!! The server brought it out.. Wow someone said, and a giggle came another. Is this what they feed the crabs that they are using to make the actual crab cakes?!?! They were tiny, good but way to tiny..  Duck Liver Mousse - Hit: This had to be my favorite. Very smooth texture, not overly mineral in taste, and paired with the pickled rhubarb and shallots, mmmmmmmmmm.. The best thing I had there.  Smoked Halibut Brandade - Miss: Texture was nice and smooth, but flavor was bland. So it made me feel like I was smearing seasoned mashed potatoes on a crostini Cheese Plate - Hit: But I mean how can you get cheese wrong Steak Frites: Kobe Bavette was tender and flavorful. Then had another serving of those really thick cut fries.   Overall, nice filling meal. However, was maybe looking for a better dining experience.",

We were quickly seated towards the back of the restaurant, which was fine, in a round booth, which I hate. Seriously, booths sucks. No one wants to be shoved in the middle. When someone needs to use the restroom everyone has to get up to let them out. It's like being in the middle seat in an airplane.  Despite being shoved in the middle (can you tell I'm biter?), I survived, due in part to the amazing cocktails! I love the use of bitters and rye in so many of the drinks. I wish I could remember the name of the drink I had, because it really was like drinking Autumn.  Our waitress was great. Our meals were divine. They were very accommodating to both me and a coworker who are both gluten free, and the bathrooms were beautifully done.  We were there on a Thursday night and it was packed. From the bar to the private rooms, there wasn't an empty spot in the house.",

That impressed me and showed me they truly value taking care of their customers. \u00a0In addition to that, she sent me a few drink coupons to make up for it. That was so sweet of her and she really didn't have to do that especially since I said I'd still return after my last visit.   So I wanted my family to try it, i gave the drink coupons to my brother and he brought my dad and step mom. I was receiving live feed on their enjoyable time there. They got to meet Callie and thought she was wonderful. They all enjoyed their food and drinks. \u00a0My dad loved everything from the appetizer, the main and the dessert! \u00a0Overall they said they would definitely return as well.  Looking forward to going with my family and bringing my husband this time!",

We ran a little late to dinner and the hostess was super super nice about it.   As for the food it's pretty good. I got the seared scallops which came with the strangest enoki mushrooms. I was not feeling the sauce. So the seared scallops were not for me. I also got the calamari and the ravioli. The calamari was BOMB DOT COM. I loved how it came with this sauce that had a spicy kick! The ravioli was a little bit overcooked but the filling..drools. The entree I ordered was the chicken...YES. GET THIS. So tender. So juicy. It laid delicately on a beautiful bed of spinach and mashed potatoes. Dessert was the ice box cake and they aren't lying when they say split this! It's super filling and really rich! The peanut brittle on the bottom adds a nice crunch.   All in all worth the price. Good atmosphere. Good staff. Good food. Which all equates to a pretty darn good time!",

This place serves many options for lunch &amp; dinner with an ambience &amp; decor that I loved and I think everyone can appreciate.   One of the things that stand out is their amazing wine selection. It's incredibly large and takes up and entire wall. The staff is very professional &amp; make you feel so welcome.

    "review_text": "I don't say this very often, mostly because I can never decide on what I feel to be the \"best\" of anything, but Prospect has THE best brunch in San Francisco. \u00a0Brunch is always such a weird meal for me since I can never decide if I want breakfast and start the day off with a normal meal, or skip straight to lunch and enjoy something more savory. \u00a0Anyway, I took my parents here for brunch since a) I heard some fantastic things about the place, and b) it's close to where I live. \u00a0Anyway, I made a reservation for 12pm on a Sunday but it didn't seem necessary. \u00a0After perusing the menu (and Yelp) for appetizers, we came up with the following:  - Monkey Bread - Deviled Eggs  Two very distinct dishes, but two OUTSTANDING ways to start off brunch. \u00a0The Monkey Bread, which has nothing to do with monkeys, was one of the most decadent things I've had. \u00a0It was like a cinnamon bun that got fluffed up to be the same texture as a cloud. \u00a0It took all restraint to not eat half the pan and then some. \u00a0The deviled eggs were highly touted on Yelp, so being that this is one of my favorite hors d'oeuvres, I had to get it. \u00a0The tiny plate of deviled eggs came out with a tiny sliver of jalapeno and bacon on top of it. \u00a0The texture of the filling was nothing I had ever had. \u00a0The jalapeno was also mixed into the filling of the egg and combined perfectly with the bacon garnish. \u00a0Yeah, I ate half the plate. \u00a0Moving onto the dishes, we all got something different, which translates into a sampler platter for me:  - Me: The Prospector - Mom: Huevos Rancheros - Dad: Braised Short Rib &amp; Smoked Potato Hash - Greg: Buttermilk Waffle  So, to start. My dish, The Prospector, was your standard eggs, bacon, sausage plate...except that it came with AMAZING corn skillet cakes which came off as pure tasty cornbread which was my favorite part of the dish. \u00a0I had a small bite of Greg's waffle, which was awesome, but I had to give up a piece of bacon and sausage. \u00a0We decided that it was probably best to stock to our own dishes after that. \u00a0My parents loved their dishes and at the end, and there were absolutely no leftovers. \u00a0Our server was great, and everyone always made sure we had enough coffee in our cups. \u00a0I absolutely loved Prospect and can't wait to go back and try something new!",

This is a hardcore FiDi after-work crowd and I have to say, predominately male, on a random Tuesday night.

The summer dinner menu skews towards seafood lovers but there was something that appealed to everyone in my group including a vegan. We split the ultra-fresh Heirloom Tomato Salad and battled over the creamy pieces of Burrata. The Seared Sea Scallops were accompanied by long beech mushrooms and okra, swimming in a surprising Thai curry broth. Prospect also had a daily special: a lovely risotto served with a fresh farm egg. Don't let the visuals fool you, it looked a bit like bland oatmeal but tasted far from it.   After devouring the bread plate, I decided to order two appetizers for my main course. If you know me, that's a rare moment of restraint. The Monterey Calamari and Potato Ravioli were of course, appy-sized, but it was creamy and decadent. The Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho was definitely the star of the show. It arrives dotted with prawns, peppers and avocado mousse and they make a light show of it by pouring the chilled gapacho tableside. It also comes topped with uni (sea urchin) that you can request with or without. Plus, it is SPICY as all get out.   All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by the fare and our NYC guests couldn't stop raving about the dishes so chalk another one up for the SF food scene!",

Nonetheless, I feel their service and quality of food is worth talking about.  Before I begin, you should know that Prospect is one of those restaurants where you should be ready to dish out a good amount of $ for a meal. Yet, I'm often surprised when people complain about price, as if they just popped into the restaurant during a stroll around the neighborhood. The menu is available online and the decor is swanky enough so that you know you're not going to get dollar tacos here.   We had a party of over 20 for a birthday party and they were able to accommodate all of us, albeit it took a while for us to get seated even with reservations. Once we were seated, I dived into the menu and ordered a couple appetizers that I cannot remember. This only means that I didn't think they were that great. Another person at our table however ordered the gnocchi which was excellent - warm, soft, delicious.   For the entree, I ordered the special for that night, which was goat. Half our party ordered the same thing and I, along with everyone else, thought it was an excellent dish. We enjoyed it so much that the people who didn't order goat was regretting their choice. Hehehe. I love it when that happens.  Next, we had dessert, my favorite part of a meal. I ordered a caramel cake of some sort that I no longer can find on their menu. Amazing. Best caramel cake I have ever had. I was practically melting on my seat. And this is coming from someone who has a major sweet tooth.  Finally, I'd like to give thanks to the waiter who helped us. I didn't catch his name but he was so attentive and helpful with his recommendations. Definitely one of the best waiters I've ever had.",

One of my friends ordered the goat dish that was the special that evening. \u00a0It was tender and flavorful, but \u00a0not gamey in the least. \u00a0It had the texture of pork but looked like beef. \u00a0I like that Prospect changes it menu constantly and prepares its dishes in a manner different from what I typically see.  For dessert my friends and I split a dessert. If memory serves, it included a semi-freddo and a black velvet cake with meringue (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=ZiVsUtPCllBRroSwqFJr6Q#gS4RpSEwvnKVzAjXuuHCTg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pros\u2026</a>). \u00a0It wasn't too heavy or too sweet and a great ending to our meal. \u00a0On my prior visit, I had tried the ice cream sandwiches and the caramel popcorn and they are worth trying as well.  The service we received on this visit was excellent. \u00a0The wait staff was top notch, professional, friendly and helpful. \u00a0 I would recommend Prospect to others without hesitation.",

    "review_text": "I've been here twice, once during a first date gone horribly awry and another for dinner with friends from out of town. I feel that this must be where all the old money in SF must come, as I don't think I've ever seen as many patrons over the age of 60 eating in one place, with most of the men in sports jackets or suits. (I swear one of them was Aaron Spelling...) Eating here reminded me of being back in NY, as the high ceilings and tasteful shades of tan/gold and greys/black made this place seem regal and sophisticated. That being said, this is not a particularly quiet restaurant.  From the date experience, I had the duck liver mousse which was served with rectangular logs of toasted potato bread(?), which was not surprisingly a great vehicle for delivering the rich and creamy concoction. The sticky chicken wings are reminiscent of Bonchon or any other decently-spiced Korean fried chicken. From the cocktail menu, the Domino Effect is like a slightly spicy spiked apple cider, a great choice when chilled to the bone but not so wise an option immediately after working out and on a first date.  From dining in the main room, we shared a bottle of wine that I sampled and was not particularly keen on but felt somewhat pressured by the sommelier to accept. (Never again!) A friend and I shared the seared abolone which would've been better if there was more of it to go around; the tomatillo puree and gin &amp; cucumber emulsion helped make this a fresher and lighter dish than it otherwise would've been. Our other friends shared the burrata, which is hard to mess up. I had the skate wing, which was cooked perfectly but over-salted (is it just me, or does everyone over-salt skate?!) over a celery root puree that needed some salt for itself.  I'd be willing to give this place a second chance as a dinner option, but overall I'm much more interested in ordering everything from the bar and people-watching for the rare SF celebrity sighting.",

We ordered: --Prospect Eggs Benedict ($14.5) -- a pretty decent benedict but served with 2 pieces of SUPER YUMMY pork belly. \u00a0I also appreciated that it came w/ lots of cream spinach and not too much hollandaise sauce. \u00a0Felt slightly healthier -- thought can't be quite sure... --Prospector ($16) -- basically a big breakfast platter - 1 pork apple sausage, few strips of bacon, eggs, 2 corn cakes, and home fries. \u00a0Eggs were very tasty and bacon was of good quality -- but nothing call home about... \u00a0I think corn-cake lovers would appreciate Prospect's version as my bf loved it -- but I'm not big on corn meal treats so can't judge. --Monkey Bread ($8) -- it's their signature. \u00a0Kind of like 7 super-doughy donut holes wedged in a circle pan, and drizzled with cinnamon-butter-sticky-goodness. \u00a0It's definitely a treat if you've never had it.  The waitress looked like Rachel Weiss and was the nicest. \u00a0Only problem was that we waited a good 45 mins for our food, gave us the wrong check, and told us \"good night\" as we left at 2pm -- but they were very very apologetic with the wait and gave us zucchini bread on the house. Ms. Weiss must have just had an off day --so I forgive and forget! \u00a0  All in all, it won't make my top 10 list given SF is brunch haven, but it's a solid place for brunch if you are in the SOMA area.",

We arrived and after letting the hostess know the name which our reservation was under, she wished him a happy birthday. The server who greeted us also did the same. They even made a special menu for him and gave us a copy to bring home. They did a wonderful job making him feel special!  The wine list was extensive and our server did a great job recommending wines that matched each of our palettes.  The food was delicious and portions were more generous than expected of a place like this. We ordered the heirloom cucumber and avocado salad which was very light and had layers of flavors which prepared us for the next dish, wagyu beef tartare. It was AMAZING. It melted in our mouths. A must if you ever go. We shared the petrale sole which was like a seafood black rice paella. Very tasty and the foam was a nice touch. We also had the snake river farm Kobe with fingerling potatoes. The beef was cooked perfectly medium rare. We finished out meal with some chocolate bon bons. This was a bit too much for two people. The chocolate mousse was very rich and sweet. Perhaps better to be shared with a group.   Overall, a wonderful experience. Can't wait to return!",

    "review_text": "Best meal at a place we'll never go back to...  Let's start with every dish we tasted was excellent. The sommelier was knowledgeable and attentive. The service was generally good - but this place needs to \"get over itself\".   One of our party is vegan and ordered the radish salad without the bread crumbles. Seems pretty simple...not so simple. What followed was a litany of excuses ranging from the pretentious to the absurd.  First the server returned saying the Chef would not do the dish without the crumbles because it ruined the presentation. We decided to risk the aesthetic trauma.  Then the manager came out and brought a picture to show us how integral the crumbles were to the dish. Seriously how could we be so gauche. When we explained that the request was based on a wheat allergy we were told to order something else, but we were never brought a menu. Apparently we were suppose to memorize the menu.  Then the same dish was actually brought to another person in our party. The crumbles were just added on top. Not rocket science to skip the crumbles.   When we pointed this out to the manager she then said that they misunderstood and could make it without the crumbles. Wait, not done yet.   Then Chef came out and explained that the radish salad had radishes saut\u00e9ed with bread.  Ok, the fourth version of why we couldn't get this salad made some sense, and finally the Chef did offer to make a gluten free salad. It's really too bad they didn't start this way, because at this point the vegan diner was so put off she didn't eat at all.  Moral of the story. Come here to eat and be grateful. Don't speak. Don't question and above all don't even think about altering the perfection that they place on a plate. Anaphylaxis is preferred to adulteration of any food combination. You're only the customer and in the relative scheme of things that's not worth much here.",

    "review_text": "Being that Prospect is the sister restaurant to Boulevard I thought I'd be debating on a 4/5 star review, not a 2/3 star review. Well, to explain briefly Boulevard won the James Beard award in 2012 for outstanding restaurant which in the culinary world is top honors for a restaurant to achieve. Also, being that I've dined at Boulevard and was thoroughly impressed I thought it was a \"no-brainer\" to dine at Prospect for I thought the entire experience would be equally impressive. \u00a0How times have changed....  Upon arriving at Prospect for a 7:35pm dinner reservation I was told that our table would be available momentarily. Roughly ten minutes later we were seated. During the five minutes it took to be seated by the hostess to the time I was greeted by our server I had a chance to admire the decor and overall layout of Prospect. Tall glass windows with visual access to Spear St. surrounds the restaurant. \u00a0Designer went the hip, trendy route while incorporating soft, subtle, warm tones to give the restaurant a modern feel.   After meeting our server and receiving our standard bread and water, \u00a0I ordered the Garden Of The Infinity Cocktail. (Square One Botanical Vodka, Cucumber, Lavender, Aperol Foam). Drink was ok but somewhat of a girly drink in my opinion. Not willing to make the same mistake twice I had to just stick with thee 'ol faithful \u00a0\"Goose Cranberry\" or in bartending lingo \"Cape Cod\". \u00a0  Appetizers were the Monterey Calamari &amp; Chili Glazed Pork Belly.(Bonito Aioli, Pickled Daikon Salad, House Made Kimchi). Calamari was tasty and delightful with spicy ingredients to really engage your pallet.   Entree consisted of Brandt Farm Ribeye. (Roasted Whole Baby Cauliflower, Bandage Cheddar Sauce, Heirloom Potatoes, Sauteed Bloomsdale Spinach, Baby onions, Beef Jus). Ribeye was juicy and flavorful. Prepared, seasoned, and cooked well. Potatoes, Spinach, and onions together with the Ribeye was quite delicious.   For desert, House Made Sorbets. Sangria &amp; Mango Sorbets. The Sangria Sorbet taste exactly like a glass of Sangria. Very pronounced aftertaste. Well crafted Sangria Sorbet. The Mango Sorbet was good but a little off. Had good Mango flavor but the aftertaste tasted a bit processed. I had a taste of the Strawberry Rhubarb Crepes (Yerena Farms Strawberries, French Vanilla Ice Cream, Oat &amp; Almond Streusel) which were absolutely incredible. The whole concept of Crepe, Strawberry, French Vanilla Ice Cream &amp; Oat is a masterpiece. \u00a0  In conclusion, Appetizers and desert were great while the drinks and entree were good. What really swayed my decision to give Prospect a three star review versus a 4 star review and occasionally a two star review was something so very basic and crucial. Service! Service was hit or miss, delayed, and somewhat shotty at times. Our server didn't seem too enthusiastic and at times I got the vibe that she was just \"going through the motions\". In any event service is something that should never be overlooked. Without quality service a restaurant cannot function properly. I would come back but I have other restaurants to visit. By the way the restrooms are quite far if you have a table in the front of the house.",

The restaurant was really spacious and the hostess was super bubbly &amp; friendly.  Here's what we had: - Strawberry Shortcake Scone: w/ creme fraiche &amp; fresh strawberries. (P.S. Creme fraiche will always remind me of Southpark) The shortcake scone tasted like a huge snicker-doodle. The scone was fluffy and crispy at the same time. I also loved the fresh strawberries! - Short Rib &amp; Smoked Potato Hash: Short ribs were tender, the hash was super flavorful but could have been a tad bit crispier. I'm also a huge fan of shishito peppers so that was icing on the cake. - Tomato &amp; Burrata Tartine: The Burrata, basil, tomato reminded me of a caprese salad. The prosciutto was delish and the italian batard was crispy and perfect. The confit garlic scramble was great on flavor but so-so on consistency.  Each dish was ~ $14, which is pretty reasonable.

I made my reservations a week or so in advance, and we were seated right when we arrived. The lighting inside is very dim, which makes for an intimate setting. We ordered:  -Tuna Tartare w/Taro Chips (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=pa-jJPSfDrYYrLkp-M2stw#pa-jJPSfDrYYrLkp-M2stw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pros\u2026</a>): Yum! The tuna was really fresh, and I loved how all the different flavors worked together for the tartare. My only complaint is that the taro chips break apart really easily, and they didn't give you enough initially. Our server let us know we could've ordered extra, but we didn't want to have to wait longer for them to arrive. However, I still really enjoyed this dish! -Green Goddess Salad (Mixed lettuces, Cucumbers, Avocado, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=pa-jJPSfDrYYrLkp-M2stw#vo4HuugO8TN1ZJNfVkJzuA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pros\u2026</a>): This dish was on the 7x7 2012 Big Eat List, and I loved this salad! It was a smaller portion for the price, so I wished they could've given you more lettuce/vegetables, but the cucumbers in it were super fresh and crispy, and I liked the taste of the dressing. Recommended! -Mushroom Soup w/Braised Pork Belly, Soft Cooked Egg (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=pa-jJPSfDrYYrLkp-M2stw#X8sZ-oqAbCR13tiTlJ1XLA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pros\u2026</a>): Deliciously rich! I had to share with the bf and didn't want to part with it. A must order if you love pork belly and soft cooked egg. -Snake River Farms Kobe Bavette (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=pa-jJPSfDrYYrLkp-M2stw#DWNEpfqclUkz9WwWe4cxYg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pros\u2026</a>): Pretty good. The bavette was tender, but this dish wasn't anything spectacular or different like some of the other dishes.   Overall, Prospect has some great food. You are definitely paying for that quality, but I think it's worth the cost. Parking in the Financial District can be difficult to find, but there is some street parking around this area. They also offer a valet service convenience. Service here is attentive but not suffocating.",

After hearing plenty of good things about Prospect, I was pretty stoked to finally check them out with a couple of friends. \u00a0Admittedly, I was a little disappointed we weren't going for dinner, but it didn't matter once I got a look at their brunch menu. \u00a0Since I've been on a bit of a potato hash kick lately, I went with the Braised Short Rib and Smoked Potato Hash (with Soft Cooked Eggs, Hollandaise with Beef Jus, Shisito Peppers, and Toasted Epi).  On their own, each individual part wasn't anything to write home about. \u00a0Combined, the dish wasn't bad (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Sh-XNVgGDRwiN4K3UEQJA?select=ZiVsUtPCllBRroSwqFJr6Q#H8Eiw39uQHdvtpTfm5AE4A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0Sh-\u2026</a>). \u00a0The chunks of short rib were pretty large (albeit a little dry) and the hash itself was seasoned and flavorful. \u00a0At the same time, it didn't enough to set itself apart from other hashes I've tried, and it was really the hollandaise sauce that tied everything together. \u00a0Not bad overall, just that it doesn't compare to my favorite short rib hash so far (Mission Beach Cafe).  While my dish might have been more like THREE AND A HALF STARS, I rounded up because my friends were fans of their dishes and I liked the great ambiance and the friendly service. \u00a0Between the giant windows and the modern decor, I really liked the vibe of the place - nice, but not stuffy. \u00a0Even though I may not have been blown away by the brunch menu in the end, it was still a decent meal, and I'm still curious about checking out that dinner menu!",

Of course, as expected, the price tag is high, but what else can you expect from any restaurant in SF.   Ordered;  1. Calamari with squid ink pasta - creative Japanese Italian fusion creation, but the pasta is a little taste less while the calamari on top is too salty. I don't think this would be an appetizer to order if you want something to start with.   2. Grill swordfish - perfectly cooked, perfectly season, and the grill taste is profound. It's paired with dirty rice, which adds a perfect texture to the dish. There's also brocollini on the side; my favorite vegetables.   3. Duck - the duck is cooked medium, just the way I like it. Duck sausage came on the side; I like any kind of sausage. The crunchy brussels sprouts pairs perfectly with the texture of the duck. The brussels sprouts has no bitter taste which will change the way you think about this vegetable ever again.   Tip: Make sure you make reservation or there will be no chance for you to get a seat on a Friday or Saturday night; weekdays will be based on luck.",

Leaving me to fend for myself I called my long lost gal pal and BARTED my blubberous butt to San Francisco for an early night on the town.  My BFF made dinner reservations which meant we had a table reserved. I arrived early and waited in the bar from my skinny ass bitch friend to walk in wearing her slutty short dress and high heels. This meant I could start ordering every fucking thing on the menu and get a head start on adding more pounds for my boyfriend to love.  The Beef Tartare sounded highly caloric and went with that. BRING ME MORE OF THOSE CRACKER THINGS. I said this in a very nice way to my waiter who was more than happy to indulge.  Finally skinny bitch friend showed up (on time) and looked down at the nearly empty plate of Beef Tartare. YES BITCH I WAS HUNGRY. I do love my friend but she is fucking beautiful and did I mention I am feeling fat?  I was already seated at a nice quiet corner of the bar facing the street so my SKINNY BITCH friend asked if we could just have dinner here instead of the douche-filled dinning room. Though let me add, the douche count was much higher in the bar.  The dinner menu is not offered in the bar for whatever the hell reason but I didn't care and asked the waiter for the highest calorie item the kitchen could throw my way. It was a burger, which are you fucking kidding me it was the size of a fucking slider. Bring me six BITCH. The French fries were served fancy and shit and each time my skinny bitch friend tried to take one I nearly ripped her arm from her socket. STAY SKINNY BITCH.  The burger (though small) was good and still feel bad the bar patrons had to witness me finish it off in two bites. AGAIN BLAME MY BOYFRIEND FOR LEAVING ME THIS WEEKEND. I'll show him by cleaning out his frig. The French fries were a nice complement and a classic one.  This place reminds me of some place Carrie Bradshaw would come to. Loving me some of this.",

This place is extremely amazing so I have to write reviews for each of the plates we ordered.  Seared Day Boat Sea Scallops (Charred Eggplant Puree, Tomato Jam, Basil) - Total three scallops with light basil and tomato jam on top and side. It also had a sprinkle of EXPRESSO powder which give that little bit of bitter taste. \u00a0Extremely creative and unique.   Wagyu Beef Tartare (Hot Mustard Ice Cream, Capers, Cornichons, Assorted Pickles, Soft Pretzel Bread) - Instand of corn chip, the chef replaced it with his creative recipe \"Soft Pretzel Bread\" with bit of light mustard + the capers and pickles. \u00a0I was able to taste the light sourness and it brought out the freshness and tenderness of the raw beef. \u00a0  Snake River Farm Kobe Bavette (Potato Galette, Buttered Peas &amp; Maitake Mushrooms, Cippolini Onions, Smoked Shallot Puree, Beef) - Steak was sliced in pieces with onions and smoked shallot that makes the dish with a bit of light sweetness. \u00a0OMG ..... the potato galette was my favorite because it came in round stacked slices, I'm not sure what the chef puts in there but every bite I took, I could taste the layers of differences. \u00a0I don't quite know how to explain this very special taste but you just have to try it yourself. \u00a0  Bordeaux Haut-Medoc Chateau Larose-Trintaudom 2009 - This bottle was introduced to us by the sommelier, great French wine.",

The drink menu is robust and has personality.  I love this spot. Definitely worth a visit. And the price is right!",

The food wasn't memorable in terms of taste. \u00a0The only thing that stood out was how perfectly fried the soft shell crab appetizer was. \u00a0The couple next to us thought the portions were too small, and the other couple thought their pork dish was so dry.  I asked for more bread to the bus boy and he acted like I was being a burden to him. He eventually brought more bread but it seemed like it was leftover bread. \u00a0They were already cut up and spread apart rather than how it first comes when they bring it to you. \u00a0one felt awffully cold and old. \u00a0I informed the waitress and she brought more, but still it wasn't the same when they first bring you bread.  Then to top it off, we waited forever for our dessert. \u00a0Then finally it arrives, but the ice cream was melted, so I asked whether the ice cream is supposed to be melted. \u00a0Obviously it was because it was just sitting at the kitchen waiting for someone to bring it to us. \u00a0My fiance was already impatient and said he's not waiting for another dessert. \u00a0So we cancelled that order.  At the end the waitress was apologetic and nice enough to give us popcorn to take home. \u00a0  Unfortunately I will not be recommending or returning to this restaurant.",

By date I mean coffee next week, confirmed on calendar, and if you're thinking it's completely one sided then you're right. But I can dream right?  So, I came here to Prospect to splurge on some good food, and to psych myself up.  When I saw the menu, almost all the appetizers seemed to jump out at me, so I decided to make my meal out of a bunch of appetizers.  --Black Truffle Beet Risotto (Creamy, and delicious texture, and not too much dark or sour beet flavor, very mild)  ---Seared Sea Scallops (Overcooked in my opinion but the cashews and eggplant really brought out the flavor of the dish)  ---Sweetbread and Bone Marrow Ravioli (decadent and delicious, one large ravioli)  ---Italian White Truffle Gnocchi (my favorite, very light cream, and a nice helping on mild white truffles to bring out a crunchy texture)  --Chocolate Pistachio Ice Cream for Dessert (Like a nice Chocolate Malt in ice-cream form)  The service was great, and the food was stellar. I really enjoyed their use of truffles and how they combined them with your not so average pasta dishes. The dishes were not overly salty which is always a plus in my book, and all in all, I would like the \"prospect' of returning again.",

We spilt 3 desserts, the snikerdoodle Ice cream sandwich ( the best) the egg nog ice cream profiteroles, and the warn sticky toffee pudding cake (which was oddly served with clementine segments and granola - which I just thought was a bit odd.

I ordered the pork chop, which our server recommended, but I thought it was meh. Didn't finish my dish.  We then figured might as well try the dessert too because, well, it's dessert and we both love eating. Ordered the banana ice cream sundae because the description reminded me of banoffee pie I had in London five years ago that I still dream about once in a while. It was good, but wasn't amazing. We also ordered the house-made caramel popcorn--also good, but not amazing.   I've had better food for the price we paid.

    "review_text": "Thank goodness Prospect came through. Otherwise my weekend of eating would have been ruined. Great cozy atmosphere. This restaurant has longed been on my list to try by I finally got a chance to try it now.  DRINKS:   Spicy Margarita (off the menu) - It was SPICY and just what I needed.  Wines by the glass are very reasonably priced.  STARTERS:  Baby Beets, Peach Farm Figs &amp; House Cured Duck Prosciutto - Fresh beets with light flavors of manchego cheese sprinkled on top. The one thing that made the plate was the pistachio brittle. I am used to a fig, beets and prosciutto combination but the brittle added a nice sweet flavor and texture to balance the salt of the prosciutto.   Monterey Calamari &amp; Potato Ravioli Nero- Slightly sweet but perfectly flavored calamari. The Ravioli \u00a0added a nice touch to the dish.  Seared Sea Scallops- Perfectly seared and salted scallops. The citrus from the vinaigrette complimented the ssubtleness of the thai curry broth.  Poached Local Petrale Sole- great piece of fish. They couldn't have cooked sole any better. Wasn't chewy and tough as most places and the flavor was on point.  Crispy Skin Local King Salmon (Wild) - \u00a0Probably one of the best cooked piece of Salmon I've ever eaten. That's saying a lot since I don't order fish very often at restaurants because most of them cook it wrong. I could eat this dish over and over again. You can taste ever flavor of the fish without any of the fishy smell.  Snake River Farms Kobe Bavette \"au Poivre\"- Just a good piece of meat cooked medium rare. Crusted with peppercorns \"au poire\" and plated with broccoli rabe. Put the rabe, meat and mushroom and you have the perfect bite.  DESSERT:   Butter Brickle Icebox Cake - very rich and I figured out why when I asked the waitress. It's because it's made with cream cheese. It was slightly on the rich side. I could only eat a couple of pieces.  OVERALL:   Great restaurant with good service. It was quite busy that night so I had to search for the waiter a couple of times to get a drink order or to order my dessert. Wait staff was really friendly and helpful. If you aren't sure which wine to get the sommelier is very helpful and will suggest a great wine that won't break the bank, like some other places.  PARKING:  Valet or there's is also metered street parking.",

Overall, portions are small and it is encouraged to order 2 or 3 dishes (appetizer, main, and something else) to get a taste of what Propsect offers.  Bread service: nice crunchy bread with butter. bread was delicious.  Here are the dishes that we tried:  Local sand dab [$15]: it was stuffed with dungeness crab, upon crispy fiorelli squash blossoms, and sweet red pepper puree. Presentation was superb (see pictures). It was like a painting. Fish was crispy and had much flavor. Surprised that it was stuffed so cleanly with crab meat. Red pepper puree offered a tinge of sweetness and the kick that the sand dab needed.  Ahi tuna tartare [$15.5]: came with miso aioli, ginger, radish pickles, and spicy tiny popcorn with furikake. A Japanese inspired dish, furikake usually goes over fish as a natural flavor enhancer. The popcorns, which came at the end of the meal, were sweet, crunchy, and surprisingly good. It was fresh and gave the tuna a dessert-like quality. An excellent dish.  Maine lobster &amp; prawn salad [$17.5]: came with lobster aioli, lemon cucumber, brokaw avocado, sungold tomatoes, and watercress  Seared day boat scallops [$16.5]: immersed in a spicy coconut lime soup (tasted like a tom khar from a Thai restaurant), shiitake mushrooms, basil, and cilantro. Really impressed by the flavors in this dish and the freshness of the scallops, which were bouncy and seared perfectly. I just wish they didn't use day boat ones, which were small. At the end, I sipped up the soup, which was smooth and hearty. Recommended.  Ca\u00f1a de cabra goat cheese, truffle and beet ravioli [$16]: came with shaved summer truffles, parmesan, and chioggia beet relish. This dish was good. The texture of the ravioli was al dentea and firm. I wish the immersion of flavors into the pasta came through more. The inside was filled with goat cheese, while the outside had beets to provide some contrast.  Snake river farm kobe bavette [$30]: great slices of beef, though not worth ordering, in favor for ordering a variety of small dishes  Dessert course:  Dirty girl strawberry and pistachio tart [$9.5]: came with balsamic strawberries, almond cake pistachio mousseline, and frozen sour cream. This was amazing. The frozen sour cream which was creme fraiche went well with the crunchy, sweet, slightly sour strawberries. The tart was delicious, gritty, mildly sweet and toasty.  Chocolate mousse: great rendition and nice end to the meal.  It's restaurants like these that create an impression upon someone to make them return soon. At the end of the meal, we got those bags of popcorns as physical evidence and reminder of the great meal and experience.",

    "review_text": "A group of friends and I had very last-minute plans to come here on a Friday night and were still able to make a same-day reservation through oh-so-convenient OpenTable. Having lived in the Bay Area for all of my life (excluding college) and having never heard of Prospect, I wasn't expecting much from this place. I honestly thought that it would be just another expensive but satisfactory restaurant in downtown San Francisco. Wow, I was so wrong.  The inside of the restaurant is really modern, with tall ceilings and glass walls facing the street. Ambiance here is dim and feels a little luxurious while not overly fancy; it's great place for any occasion, whether it be an intimate date or a social get-together with a group of friends.  APPETIZERS - Wagyu Beef Tartare: This was surprisingly different from other tartares I've had before; it kind of reminded me of an ahi tuna poke, except with wagyu beef. Pretty refreshing. - Seared Day Boat Sea Scallop: Mmmm the scallops were cooked perfectly--crispy on the top, and soft and tender on the inside--paired with a nice flavorful sauce. - Seared Monterey Abalone with Crispy Pig Trotters: I still have no idea what a pig trotter is, and I don't care. This appetizer was my favorite. It comes with this green foamy soapy-looking sauce, which is also a mystery to me, but it pairs very well with the abalone and pig trotter. My only gripe is that it's so good yet the portion is too small to share amongst 4 people!  MAIN ENTREES We ordered the following entrees:  \u00a0 - Berkshire Pork Chop  \u00a0 - Snake River Farm Kobe Bavette  \u00a0 - Liberty Valley Duck &amp; Lightly Smoked Sausage  \u00a0 - NY Strip Steak All of the entrees were dressed with various vegetables and sides, and each component of all the dishes was packed with flavor. The stand-outs to me were the kobe bavette (partly because it comes with barley, yum!), and the pork chop, which was surprisingly moist and tender.  DESSERTS At first I was a little disappointed because I wanted to try the ice cream sandwiches mentioned in a lot of Yelp reviews, but I'm so glad we decided to order desserts anyways because we discovered something pretty great here, which is... - Chocolate Praline Bonbons with Valrhona Fudgesicle: I think this was one of the best desserts I've ever had because it has so many different components, all of which were spectacular. So many different textures--crunchy, crispy, soft, icy--like my cousin would say, it's like a party in my mouth! - Salted Chocolate Caramel Tart: This dessert was also really good, especially the soft, warm cookie, but unfortunately the chocolate bonbons and fudgesicle dessert stole the show. Still, this one is definitely worth getting.  DRINKS On top of all the great food and desserts, Prospect also makes really good drinks! Among us, we had the Il Terranova (mild and great for people with low alcohol-taste tolerance), I Am D.B. Cooper (super spirited!), Prospector, and Domino Effect. My friends and I ended up liking our first round of drinks so much that we ordered 2 more rounds, and each of us stuck to our original picks!  Prospect completely exceeded my expectations, and I would definitely recommend giving this place a try. The tab can rack up pretty quickly especially if you also order drinks, appetizers, and desserts, but it's absolutely worth it. I can't wait to come back, and I'm constantly trying to find an excuse to dine here again.",

Are you serious? I was completely dumbfounded. What transpired after that is beyond comprehension. I have NEVER seen such incompetence from the manager/GM. They said to our friend, who lives next door and frequents this place regularly, that they wouldn't serve us because someone smelled like alcohol. What? What does that mean and no one was intoxicated, perhaps 1 or 2 had a couple drinks, call that buzzed but not drunk. We left, of course. We were all beyond livid. Then as if that wasn't enough...the minute we left I looked in the window and the GM WAS LAUGHING, laughing with her staff. Prospect has not only lost a long-term customer, I will make it my mission to let others know the kind of treatment you can expect. I'm sad to see such a great place become my least favorite in SF.  AND...all you had to do was show some decency and respect, seemed relatively simple, no?",

The tater tots and tacos we had about two hours later tasted pretty good, too, and didn't make me worry about my budget for the rest of the month. Try filling up on the bread?",

    "review_text": "If it wasn't for One Market being fully booked on the last night of Dine About Town, then I probably wouldn't have dined at Prospect which was right around the corner. \u00a0After walking around SOMA browsing at menus from other restaurants in the area, Prospect had one thing that caught my eye and was also something I would've ordered at One Market - Liberty Valley Duck Breast.  Because I was dining solo, it was somewhat easier for me to get seated right away. \u00a0I loved how the hostess was able to accommodate me by having me sit at one of their small bistro tables by the window. \u00a0It made for great people watching while enjoying my meal.  So let's get to the food.   Liberty Valley Duck Breast ($31) \u00a0w/ added Pan Seared Foie Gras (+$15) Black &amp; Red Quinoa, Chard, Pickled Baby Turnips, Bing Cherries Walnut Brittle, Cherry Infused Duck Jus. (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1dj3OFa&amp;s=059eb6cb120092d44bff0510e756888212521dfd49ec87cf96db82ffa5ee3167\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1dj3OFa</a>) The entree was art indeed. \u00a0When it was brought to my table I didn't know where to start because it looked spectacular! \u00a0And since the California ban on Foie Gras was closely approaching (two weeks later), I decided to splurge a little and added it to my Duck. \u00a0And they gave a very generous portion of it and it was very good and complimented the Duck Breast very well. \u00a0The Duck Breast itself was very tender and had a lot of flavor, especially when put together with the walnut brittle, black &amp; red quinoa, and cherry infused duck jus. \u00a0It was definitely was a carousel of flavors!  After my dinner entree, I really was done but then Katie, my waitress, showed me the dessert menu, I figured \"what the hell\" and decided to satisfy my sweet tooth.  Apricot Cake ($9) (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F16vnXAf&amp;s=f262721ab386237fd98324681ab8273bb8d3315dc1ed3c729bbaaf97b98c2b2c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/16vnXAf</a>) This particular dessert was chosen by Katie, my waitress. \u00a0I can't remember off hand what the ingredients were, but I can tell you this......with the cake, berries, and ice cream, the whole thing tasted like a glorified Twinkie!!  Service couldn't have been any better. \u00a0Katie was exceptional and very friendly! \u00a0And she was always there to check on me even on a busy Friday night.  Overall, I'm so glad that I was able to dine here instead of One Market. \u00a0According to my friend, it was a huge upgrade in terms of food, service, and atmosphere, and he was right. \u00a0I would dine here again for any occasion whether it be for happy hour, date night, or just for solo dining. \u00a0And If you know me from my reviews, I'm huge burger fan and I heard their \"Secret Burger\" is a definite must-try. \u00a0So that will probably be what I'll be ordering on my next visit. \u00a0I'll be looking forward to it!",

I ordered a Kobe steak medium rare which was cooked perfectly if not necessarily substantial, but everything served with the dish complimented it beautifully.

I made a reservation for a party of 7 for a business dinner to be held this week. \u00a0The restaurant called 2 days before my reservation to confirm, and since not everyone in my party could make it, I communicated that a reservation for 4 was only needed. \u00a0Less than 24 hours later and 24 hours before my reservation, one of my guests changed his plans so he could make dinner. Great! \u00a0Except for when I called the restaurant, they could no longer take my party at the scheduled time and then said it \"would be tight\". \u00a0  The hostess tried telling me that I didn't understand...I replied that I was being penalized for telling the truth when they confirmed my reservation the previous day. \u00a0I could have just left it and had the restaurant sort it out upon our arrival...I told her I would be looking for another place...her response? \u00a0\"that's probably for the best.\" \u00a0Wow! \u00a0This place has got to be one of the most arrogant in the City! \u00a0Apparently, they don't need business. A party of 5 at that! \u00a0  Do NOT book a reservation here. \u00a0There are too many great place to settle for an obnoxious, arrogant restaurant who doesn't care about accommodating customers. \u00a0I was a fan of Prospect, but I won't be coming back and I sincerely hope the owners and GM read this post. \u00a0You should be aware of how your guests are treated. \u00a0Poor taste, Prospect!!",

Thankfully, the food, drinks, and service after we were seated made up for the poor first impression.

FOOD -We ordered the Green Goddess salad (simple, but delicious) and a morel mushroom special as appetizers. \u00a0It was my first time having morel mushrooms and it won't be my last... they were rich and absolutely delicious! -For my entree, I had the duck breast served with braised duck-stuffed cabbage and smoked oat risotto. \u00a0I'm a huge fan of duck, so the fact that I got to have it twice on one plate was amazing!

    "review_text": "I've been wanting to come here for a while. \u00a0The space is beautiful with simple neutral colors, high ceilings, large windows. \u00a0The restaurant itself is actually pretty low key.  As for the menu, it's more Californian with no tasting option. \u00a0We ended up with a bottle of wine, but the cocktail list looked really appealing.  We started with a wagyu beef tartare that was probably one of the most creative ones I've had, served with a spicy mustard ice cream, which mixes in really well. \u00a0There was crunch and tartness from the cornichons and capers, and it's all spread on warm pretzel bread. \u00a0There was also a truffle tagliatelle with light summer flavors (squash blossom pesto), but it was under-seasoned for my tastes.  As for the special roasted chicken breast of the day, it was cooked just right without being dry. \u00a0The beans underneath were a nice accompaniment, and it was presented nicely. \u00a0The highlight of the main courses was definitely the pork chop - well seasoned, topped an apricot relish to make it a lighter dish. The okra croquette was also creative and just the right amount of fried goodness. This would definitely be my recommendation for the night.  As for dessert, we had a strawberry and pistachio tart with creme fraiche ice cream and strawberry ice cream. \u00a0It's a good, lighter dessert for summer, and there are lots of textures with the nuts and other crunchy bits. \u00a0It goes well with espresso.  Overall, food was awesome (wagyu tartare and pork chop). \u00a0Pacing was good. \u00a0Prices are reasonable, and it's not stuffy at all despite that most of the crowd was on the older side on a Monday night.  Warning: the area is not ghetto, but my car was parked right outside on Spear near Folsom around 7:30-9pm, and the back window of my SUV was smashed (I had the trunk cover on covering the contents, and no I did not place anything in the trunk after I parked). \u00a0There are plenty of people walking around, and it wasn't that late, but you never know in SF :(",

Apps came in all different sizes so one salad served one and the other salad was for like three people. This is fine but we had no idea so ended up with a lot. The polenta truffle app was possibly the best thing. Devine! 2. Some of the food was cold and it was all very salty. 3. Generally, components of the meal were great but overall it fell flat. 4.

We showed up with a group of 10 people for dinner and have never been treated so poorly in my life. We had reservations for 10 and waited in the bar where we were informed we could not be served due to some people being \"intoxicated\" by Kaeka who was one of the top 10 worst service workers I have ever seen. Our situation was then escalated to the manager, Cathy, who tried but was so indecisive and turned it back on me saying I \"smelled like alcohol\". Hmmm, I told her I just had a holiday cocktail party at my place next door...so of course I did (a few glasses of wine now gets you on the do not serve list??). \u00a0Most of us had a couple glasses of wine and were refused service!!!! \u00a0 Yes, at 9pm, after a couple glasses of wine, we were refused. \u00a0Not one person acted out. \u00a0I can't say again how pathetic both Cathy and Kaeka were. \u00a0Smelling my breath and refusing to serve our entire group??? \u00a0Are you kidding??? \u00a0....at 9pm during the holidays? \u00a0I think she needs to get off her pedestal and stop playing GOD!!!! \u00a0Cathy, you don't deserve to be in the service business!!!  The group of 10 of us walked to Ozumo and ended up taking out $1500 tab elsewhere. \u00a0I can't stress enough....STAY AWAY!!!!!! \u00a0 There are way better places in SF. \u00a0They only reason I went back is the convenience of being next door...not any more. \u00a0I will put in the extra effort to avoid ever having to speak to people like Cathy and Kaeka.

The huge sized sketch drawings on the wall were very eye catching. \u00a0There were lots of business people and that got me a bit worried. \u00a0The waiter mentioned zip that I was the worst dress person on premise. \u00a0For that, he got extra tips.  The chef was daring. The flavors were pushed and I like his/her adventurous mood.  The appetizers beets and lobster gazpacho (a soup) were sharply acid and brought up the appetite and opened up the wine (house red, a Rhone blend). \u00a0The chicken was to die for and made the seabass (very good) felt a bit bland.  The chocolate ice cream sandwich use real and fresh mints, instead of using those green dye and synthesized mint flavor. \u00a0The apple toffee cake has some kind of oriental aroma that I still cannot place.  Everything was intriguing , flavorful, well presented. \u00a0Services were excellent (they wipe clean the table after each course) even the restaurant was sold out and teeming with loud activities.

Definitely a prospect for a nice dinner -- if you're feeling adventurous enough to spend $$$, or if you're going out for a team dinner on the company, like I was the first (and so far only) time I have been here :D  Since the whole menu is in fancy restaurant language, let me break it down for commoners like myself based on what my classy, sophisticated co-workers ordered, since they know this place and it totally worked well for us.  The warm-ups: McCormack Ranch Goat \"Bolognese\" - Not bad, but this one was passed around a few times during it's life cycle, if you know what I mean. Wagyu Beef Tartare - Very nice. Shaved Burgundian Truffles - Yum.  The goods: Local King Salmon - Teach me please. I want to make salmon like this. Snake River Farm Kobe Bavette - Oh my beefy goodness. So tender, so juicy, and relatively decently sized. Others: Didn't try them but they are all probably comparably delish.  The finishers: Peach \"Melba\" Strude - Ay que fabulosa. Me gusta! I'm so useless but the dessert wine menu looked like a load of gibberish to me so I just ordered what my co-workers ordered. It was some light red wine and it was some sweet goodness, just how I like it.  As expected in a $$$ restaurant with 4 stars, Prospect did not disappoint. The food was good, the service was swift, efficient, and polite, and the dessert was a very satisfying finisher. Maybe it was the 4 glasses of wine that the waiter just kept refilling as soon as the fill line dropped, but I'm really feeling the classy atmosphere and everything about this place. And it is actually totally reasonably priced for everything you get. If I somehow decide to become fancy in the future, I'd totally come back often. Love it.",

On my most recent visit to Prospect, I already knew even before setting foot in the restaurant that I would be ordering the burger. But not just any burger, the \"Secret Burger\". Both the regular burger and \"secret burger\" can only be found in the bar, so upon arriving my wife and I scored two seats overlooking the hard working bartenders.   Now how about to a bar menu dammit!   True to their word, the secret burger cannot be found listed anywhere. So I leaned over and whispered to our bartender \"pssst, hey\" \"how about that secret burger?\"  Our bartender nodded and said he would go find out what tonights offering would be. See the secret burger changes nightly. Sometimes it isn't a burger at all and can be pork or a piece of fish, so knowing what's on it before ordering is of the upmost importance.  He returned with the good news. The burger tonight is actually a burger! And it came with foie gras, sliced pineapple and caramelized onions on a toasted brioche bun. I must admit, I wasn't super excited at the \"prospect\" of pineapple on my burger but I went with it anyway.  The burger finally arrived and now I know why sometimes you find stupid pineapple on burgers! It works! The sliced pineapple help cut down the richness of the foie gras and added a slight tang and sweetness to each bite. If you are into large portions, this burger isn't for you. It's definitely on the smallish side, if you have been to Unami Burger then you \u00a0would know what to compare it to. But honestly I am more about quality than quantity and the burger size was A OK with me. And this is without a doubt a quality burger. But it is pricey. My wife and I each had a cocktail, one glass of wine, split a salad and one burger and bill still came out to over $80 (pre tip). But again, for the quality and the venue I was ok with it.   In the end, good burger but not great. Better than Burger Bar but not up to Unami, nopa or Bix Standards. But worth giving a try anyway.  I've dined at both the bar and the main dining room and both times treated to a fantastic experience. There is plenty of free parking after six and if you don't want to deal with this at all, they offer valet parking at a reasonable price.",

SERVICE: I was impressed with the courteousness of the hostess. \u00a0Our waitress was friendly, and the busboys made sure our water glasses were always full.  FOOD: - Pumpkin bread pudding cake ($10): Delightful flavors. \u00a0I thought the pairing of the pumpkin bread spices with the orange white chocolate ganache was unique and delicious, especially when paired with the salted caramel sauce (yay sweet &amp; savory!). \u00a0I was a little leery of the pomegranate sorbet, but it actually worked very well. \u00a0Bonus points for having the slightly brulee'd bread pudding cake tops. \u00a0YUM!  - Domino Effect ($11.50): The autumn spice syrup made this drink taste like a sophisticated version of Thanksgiving. \u00a0Slightly sweet/girly, but that's the way I like my cocktails.  I also got to sample the Blood &amp; Sand (VERY good), and the Il Terranova (also quite good, but sweeter than the Domino Effect... which was a nice balance for the bitterness of the Cynar).  OVERALL: A nice place to grab dessert and drinks, though I do find it to be on the pricey side (hence 3.5 stars). \u00a0I'll be back if I ever find myself in the area.",

Made me feel fancy! :P  Appetizers We shared this among the party so we each got a small taste of each. \u00a0 SEA SCALLOPS - Delicious! Perfectly cooked.  HAWAIIAN KAMPACHI SASHIMI - So refreshing with cucumber and citrus notes. SOFT SHELL CRAB - Very tasty. The breading was light and airy.  I would order all of these again!  Entrees PORK LOIN &amp; PORK BELLY - Both were very good. I would have liked more of the pork belly..hehe. This dish also included two very yummy chickpea fries.  HALIBUT - This wasn't very memorable for me.  QUAIL - The quail was good, but the bacon stuffing was even better!!   Dessert MINT CHIP ICE CREAM SANDWICH - A lot of people in my group didn't like the real mint taste, but I loved it. Very refreshing and was heavenly with the chocolate!  CARAMEL POPCORN - Yum yum yum! This is totally on my list of favorite popcorn.  CAPPUCCINO - Perfect way to finish off the meal and pair with the desserts.   Overall, we had a great time. The staff were attentive and the decor was lovely. I always appreciate restaurants with large windows. They let in so much light and give the illusion of spaciousness.

Food was prepared well, with good balance of flavors while focusing on fresh, seasonal ingredients. Their black cod was buttery yet still had a perfect charred top that gave each bite a light crunch.

    "review_text": "This review is for their \"Grab &amp; Go\" lunch only which they started along with lunch service last Tuesday, 9/17.   Since they started opening for lunch, I've been a frequent patron of their Grab &amp; Go lunch as I work 2 blocks away and food options are limited. The quality of their lunch is excellent. Some may say that $8.50 for a sandwich and $12.50 to make it a meal (add chips and soda) is a bit on the pricey side, but I disagree. It is a great value for a no-wait lunch in downtown San Francisco, prepared by a chef at an upscale venue like Prospect. \u00a0  That said, there are definite drawbacks. I've been back three times since their grand opening and every time the selection is extremely limited. For instance, there has never been a pre-packaged salad. Sorry light eaters!   Also, of the three times I've been there, they've only ever had two lunch options. The first time there was an option of two sandwiches Ham &amp; Brie or Chicken &amp; Tomato, but as of this week, the second and third time I've been there, there's only been one option: the Chicken &amp; Tomato sandwich. Sorry vegetarians!  Granted, this sandwich is delicious with its butter poached or gently pan-seared chicken breast, herb jam, heirloom tomatoes, and variation of cheese (usually Burrata or today Ricotta Salata, yippee!) -- but give me a break! It's only a matter of time before I get bored of this. For a first timer, yes this is exciting, but seeing as their patrons are likely going to be the same recurring office workers day after day, let's try to add in some variety. Maybe try a salad or if that's too much change, maybe chicken salad (no grapes please).   The point is if they're not growing, they're dying. And I don't want to see this fledgling Grab &amp; Go operation die because I love their $8.50 Chicken &amp; Tomato sandwich! Here's hoping there will be a new $8.50 option soon.",

Dinner was amazing. \u00a0Appetizers of pressed raviolis, squash blossoms and heirloom tomato salad. \u00a0Ravioli dish was to die for. \u00a0Main course, pork loin with pork belly - do not get the appeal of pork belly at all, but the pork loin was perfectly cooked and the perfect portion. \u00a0Came over a bed of sweet/nutty faro + black mission fig. \u00a0Really excellent. \u00a0  My mom had Snake River Farms Kobe Bavette steak...hands down BEST steak ever eaten. Perfect in every way. \u00a0My sister had the halibut. \u00a0great crust, perfectly cooked, but could have used more lemon and salt (which she added herself and then was very happy).  Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the service. \u00a0Our server was Gabriella. \u00a0She was lovely, very competent, really knew the menu, the wine list, etc. very well spoken and obviously pro. \u00a0The problem was she kept running away from the table and we were struggling over wine choices and had to ask several times for help. \u00a0It shouldn't have been that hard to order wine, and we're wine drinkers!  Also we were told that two wines we wanted to try were not available for tastes. \u00a0This is a no no in my book. \u00a0It's not like these were $1,000 bottles, not even $100 bottles, so that should never be a no...just my personal opinion. \u00a0If you have clients sitting at your table ordering dinner, let them try what they want. \u00a095% certainty they will order what you just poured them.  Also when ordering our food, we requested the squash blossom appetizer and were promptly told that it was only available at the bar (we had been sitting at the bar and looking at that menu) but that she would check with the kitchen.  Really? \u00a0That was annoying. \u00a0Again, clients at your table, get them what they want. \u00a0Does the world end if you run out of squash blossoms at the bar? \u00a0No.  All in all, I would HIGHLY recommend. \u00a0The meal was fantastic and the ambiance is perfect.",

I ordered the steak medium rare. \u00a0It was served medium and stood before it made its way to my table. \u00a0 The meat itself wasn't very good. \u00a0I could have had better by buying from Whole Foods and cooking at home myself. \u00a0At this price point, I would expect a perfectly cooked steak :/ \u00a0I don't think I'll be back. \u00a0There are too many other choices in San Francisco.",

    "review_text": "My partner and I decided to spend a night out at a place that we have never been. I had heard about Prospect from a friend so we decided to give it a try. We made reservations on a Wednesday night on the later side 9:00. We were greeted at the door by a very nice host who pointed us to the bar to grab a drink before our table was ready.  The bartender said he would be right with us. We weren't sure what to order so he guided us through their specials. I had a prospector and my partner had a rye Manhattan. Great drinks! The host came and got us at the bar so they could seat us. We were walked in to a large dinning room with beautiful hanging iron chandeliers with Edison bulbs. We were seated by the window banquets. Our server came over and introduced herself to us and then left us to look at the menu. We decided to pick a few dishes to share. We decided on the Maine lobster ravioli and the Ahi tuna tartare. Both dishes arrived at the \u00a0table with amazing plating the pyramid ravioli was delicious and the tartare was great the had dried and shaved a ahi jerky over The top of the ahi and the puffed rice cracker was a fun way to interact with the dish. For our main courses we ordered the quail and the NY steak. Cutting in to the quail was a treat with the wild rice and mushrooms each bite was heaven. My partners steak was cooked to perfection and the twice baked potato covered in dripping Gruyere and crispy potato skins.  Our server was great always close by to see if we needed anything and steered us on to the amazing snickerdoodle \u00a0ice cream sandwiches. We weren't going to have anything because we were so full but I am glad our server had us order them.  We had such a great time we will bring friends with us the next time as well as enjoy it on our own.",

I rarely eat meat and I decided to splurge on halibut since it's an expensive restaurant. \u00a0It was so buttery and salty, I couldn't even finish it. \u00a0Good chefs can spice their food to make it taste out of this world -- butter and salt could not be more obvious! \u00a0  I did like the bar decor and loved the way my cocktail was presented, but again, everyone was twice my age so I just felt out of place. \u00a0It's great if you're eating with your parents or like hanging out with an older crowd, but there is absolutely no way I would recommend Prospect to health conscious people in their late 20s to early 30s. \u00a0Probably the worst date night my fiance and I have had in San Francisco (and we go out a lot).",

Rating per Area: Service - 2 Stars - Inconsistent Timing Decor and Atmosphere - 5 Stars - Modern Elegant Cocktails - 5 Stars - Excellent Food Ingredients - 4 Stars - Fresh and good quality Food Flavors - 4 Stars - Nice combinations of flavors Food Preparations - 1 Star - Inconsistent...Perfect, to Overdone, to Underdone Dessert - 3 Stars - Just So So  Seating was prompt and professional We ordered cocktails. They were inventive and excellent quality  Wine list was impressive. Many nice wines by the glass as well  Pre Appetizer:  We asked if we could order the Cesar Salad Deviled Eggs from the bar menu. Our server had to ask permission from the manager, since they do not allow these items in the dining room. He returned and let us know that they would allow it. They were Very Good  Appetizers: Timing was great Abalone was very good. Only issue was too much pork to abalone. Once you separated the two you could taste the abalone. Perfect preparation.  Scallops were inconsistent in preparation. The first one was way overcooked (rubber), the next two were Perfect. Flavor combination was very nice  Entrees: Timing was horrible, waited almost 30 minutes. Server came to apologize. Risotto (off appetizer menu). Very good. Personally don't care for foam, but it worked. Preparation was perfect.  Pork Chop started off great. First 3 bits were absolutely incredible. Then I made my way towards the center. Grossly undercooked and I like my pork medium rare. Center was cool and chewy. Sent it back.  I will say that the gentleman next to me had the same thing and his was perfect. I noticed that my cut was much thicker than his, which may explain the difference.  Dessert: Timing was poor again Ordered dessert, coffee and after dinner drinks Chocolate Bonbons were OK, Nothing to write home about Coffee did not arrive until Dessert was almost finished. Just bad form...  Bill was incorrect. They charged me for the Pork Chop. Server got it fixed though.  The server also brought us a to-go bag of Chocolate Caramel Popcorn. It was a nice gesture. I will say it was good. Had a few while walking down the waterfront to view the bay bridge lights.   Overall I thought that the food ingredients were great, but preparation was lacking.   I really want to like this place. It has all the right parts and pieces. They just need to get the service timing and food preparation down.",

Our table was probably a server's nightmare because no one was drinking alcohol and almost everyone modified their selections to accommodate various dietary restrictions. Despite this, our server was unfailingly gracious and was able to help everyone find delicious dishes to suit their needs.   The food: I had the lobster chowder which was exquisite, and the liberty duck entree which had a sweet potato pur\u00e9e and house made marshmallows. For dessert we had the caramel popcorn which was a perfect treat at the end of a wonderful meal. I look forward to going back again and enjoying their amazing food and service with some wine!",

It's located right on the corner of Spear St. and Folsom, pretty much in the Financial District of SF. Walking in, you'll notice how sleek and modern the decor looks like. The restaurant itself is pretty big. Our brunch was actually in the private room towards the back of the restaurant. The room itself was large enough to fit about 50 people, about 5 large tables. It had its own private bar in the room, as well as someone asking for coat check. The room was really nice and decorated with pretty lights. There was a ton of room for guests to mingle around while drinking delicious mimosas.  While we waited for our servers to come around and take our orders, we had these donut like items as appetizers. We actually had a set menu of four items to choose from: - Smoked Salmon &amp; Everything Bagel - Warm French Toast - Today's Omelette - Egg Sandwich  The smoked salmon and egg sandwich were calling out my name, so the best friend and I decided that she would get the smoked salmon bagel and I would get the egg sandwich and we would split it so we could try some of each. Not gonna lie, I was a little disappointed to see that the portions weren't that big, but surprisingly enough, they were very filling and pretty damn good! The main courses came with some potato pieces as sides, so while we split our meals, the best friend and I were well-fed. Afterwards, we were given salted-caramel popcorn! They were so addicting! You couldn't just get one handful - you just kept reaching for more. And for dessert, servers passed around these peppermint ice cream sandwiches. They were AMAZING. I've never had anything like it. Like you could actually taste the peppermint pieces in them. So good!  Service here is amazing. There was always someone coming around to see if we needed refills on our drinks or whatever else we needed. Overall, I had a wonderful time here. I would very much come back again during my next SF trip to have dinner or lunch.",

I also tried the rum drink - which was a little on the sweet side, but not bad overall.  we ordered some finger foods as well, the only thing that stood out were the fries.  note: this place gets pretty packed for happy hour so i would recommend coming a little early if you want to grab a table.",

I have been there a couple times and every time I go there, I finish my dinner happy:) The first time I had dinner here was a couple month ago, and on the next day, they called me to make sure we enjoyed dinner there. \u00a0How many restaurants have this kind of heartfelt services? \u00a0Very impressive!  Some dishes I had last week were:   Soft Shell Crab and Kimichi Pork belly - Softshell crab was just good, but Kimichi Pork Belly was delicious. Northern Halibut \u00a0- Amazing! \u00a0Sweet and flavorful halibut with lots of vegetables arranged colorfully. \u00a0My favorite dish here. \u00a0Beautifully done. Prather Ranch Pork - Scrumptious. \u00a0The pork is brilliantly cooked in pink color and tender.  The portion is just perfect for me. \u00a0Not too big or small. \u00a0All the dishes are delicately flavored. \u00a0I love their modern and chic d\u00e9cor with the glass walls, which makes it look very spacious and \u00a0I feel very comfortable there with the great atmosphere.  Again, service is topnotch! \u00a0They are always helpful when I ask for the advice on my food and wine choice, furthermore, they are so friendly.  Their bar looks very cool as well and their happy hour is very appealing, which I want to go back for next time.  I highly recommend Prospect if you like to enjoy sophisticated dining experience.",

The only aspect of our dinner where Prospect dropped the ball was in our attempt to connect with the sommelier to pre-arrange the wine selections. \u00a0After an initial contact, our email with some initial thoughts and selections was ignored. \u00a0A request to have the sommelier contact us by phone? \u00a0Likewise ignored. \u00a0So, on the evening of the party, we were left to fend for ourselves. \u00a0Consequently, two of three selections, a total of four bottles, were big hits. \u00a0The third, the most expensive bottle we chose, a roaring dud! \u00a0And, had Prospect's sommelier deigned to work with us, we might have avoided an expensive mistake.  On the whole though...great food, pleasant atmosphere, an extensive wine selection, contributed to a wonderful, if not quite perfect evening at Prospect.",

I was also a little disappointed that they didn't offer a substitution for the potatoes that I asked they hold, because of my sensitivity to dairy - which had my plate come to me looking pitifully bare.   What I was actually most impressed with was the space. The decor is contemporary, and lots of windows help create a nice open feeling. \u00a0The service was prompt and professional, if not overly friendly.   Overall the experience was a positive one, and I'll likely return at some point, but probably not for awhile. There are too many comparable restaurants to explore first.",

The service is fine, the menu is fine, the location, you guessed it, fine.  The menu changes every few weeks and consists mostly of upscale American'ish food. Scallops over risotto, fried chicken sandwiches, salmon, you get the picture.   The last time I was there, I had the salmon over a bed of shaved brussels sprouts. The food is good but nothing really stood out.   No wait, something did stand out. The tiny portions. In all honesty, I have never seen such a small amount of food on such a giant plate. I was starving twenty minutes after lunch. In the past, I've had the steak and the hamburger and so I can honestly attest to the tiny portions.  The starters and the dessert are actually more innovative than the food. The last time I was there, they had an eggplant dip with miso, served with toasted nori chips that was quite tasty. And for dessert, their homemade caramel corn can't be beat.  As a final point of note, you have to request bread before the meal if you want it and in light of the doll-sized food that's to follow, my most helpful advice is, \"Get the bread.\"",

    "review_text": "STILL REELING... This is a mixed review, as my actual meal and the table service was lovely. Spectacular, really. But the nausea set in before I even had a chance to order a cocktail. I had brought in a beautiful chocolate cake for my dear friend's birthday, which we were celebrating at Prospect. \u00a0Upon my arrival I asked the hostess if she knew who our server would be for the meal (we came early for drinks and the group was still at the bar), as I wanted to be sure the cake got into the correct hands. She then asked me if I was aware of their cakeage fee (yes, that is a real thing in case you are wondering). I said I was not (as it is not listed anywhere on their website), but that I understand some restaurants do charge for bringing in an outside cake. At which point I said, \"No problem, do you mind me asking how much your cakeage fee is?\" - to which she answered, \"It's eight dollars a slice.\" $8 a SLICE!?!?! You must be joking! That is the most obscene fee I have ever heard. She assured me that it was a great presentation, with ice cream. EIGHT DOLLARS????? No way. I have heard of $2, at the absolutely max $4. But what are my options? I am standing there with a cake for the birthday girl, so I said fine, but be sure to put it on a separate check and present it to me only. \u00a0There were 14 people in our party, so in the end, my cakeage bill came to $115 - yep, \u00a0they taxed it. \u00a0Not to mention they botched the cake presentation as well.   My beautiful dinner with wine service was only $89 before gratuity, so color me confused. \u00a0   All in all, I would have rated the dinner and service quite high, but I just can't do it due to the ridiculousness of the cakeage fee. \u00a0  To boot, I also happen to book high-end group dinners for a living, but I certainly won't be booking them at Prospect any longer. \u00a0In conclusion, please PLEASE don't bring in a special cake to Prospect, it's literally not worth it.",

Prospect is a swanky, modern upscale restaurant with oak and walnut colored interiors and a sumptuous lighting scheme to bring a dramatic ambiance throughout the restaurant. \u00a0There is a resident pizazz in the air, the sounds of multiple conversations ensuing and joyous laughter over exquisite food and drink. \u00a0-no long faces here!  Despite being seated an hour over our reservation time, our party's disappointment quickly dissipated with gracious personal attention from the manager who brought out some sort of potato dumplings for our party of five and a sample of their creamy cauliflower soup. \u00a0As expected, the service was impeccable throughout the night.  I ended up ordering the Liberty Duck Breast with crispy duck fat potatoes, shaved brussels sprouts, baby white turnips, pickled quince (small yellowish fruit) in foie gras sauce. \u00a0Although small in portion, it was a finely herbed, zestful indulgence.  The only thing here I find disappointing are their dirty martinis. \u00a0Even with top shelf vodka, their dirty martinis will never be up to par with the vapid, flat olives they use which is confirmed when taking a bite into them. \u00a0Maybe, they were old that night.

We arrived and we instructed to go to the bar and our table would be ready shortly (from the looks there were MULTIPLE tables open in the main dining room). This is really the ONLY bad thing I can say about Prospect. Had an absolutely delicious cocktail at the bar (granted it took a few minutes to be served).   When seated, we looked at the wine list, and were instructed it was 1/2 price bottle night (hostess was supposed to inform us of this). We ended up talking to the sommelier and she recommended a Merlot blend that phenomenal. Would not have ordered it had it not beed for the 1/2 price night, but still, well worth it. It paired perfectly with every dish we had.  Ordered the Lobster and cauliflower annolloti, which was buttery, had a great sauce, and was just really solid. \u00a0Coupled that with the candied walnut and blue cheese salad, which was also outstanding.  We proceeded to order dinner (we were informed b our server that they were running low on certain menu items, so we ordered and then had them hold the order) -- the special was goat which was fabulous, and my girlfriend ordered the sole which was good, but not great (not much taste).  Overall Prospect was very good. Would definitely go back, especially on Sunday for 1/2 price bottles of wine!",

It's very spacious so ideal for large groups. The service was great and they kept my coffee filled to the rim (much needed after a late night out).   We ordered Monkey Bread for a starter, which was basically a cinnamon roll. Didn't try it but apparently gauging from the \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" emitting from my friends, it was delicious. I learned what \"epi\" is: a type of artisan bread that's often made at French-style bakeries. They have toasted epi accompanying many of their brunch items but I gave mine to a friend since I'm on the Paleo regime. My Short Rib &amp; Smoked Potato Hash was very flavorful and the eggs were perfectly poached. Everyone else commented that their food was yummy and we had an enjoyable time.

I've lived in Portland and NYC, both very much foodie heavens, and expected this to be a good inventive foodie place based on their menu, but was fairly disappointed. The ambiance was lovely, but a bit loud with some loud groups seated nearby. For drinks, my dad got a chocolate-based cocktail that was too bitter and not very exciting, but my husband and I got good glasses of wine. They had a pretty good selection of wines and dessert wines. The food itself was ok, some better than others (the pork chop was our best dish and the closest to an inventive/foodie dish as I expected), but the chicken and steak weren't especially exciting. All the dishes seemed to have high-quality ingredients but the pairing of sauces, side dishes, and flavors could have been better. Service was on the slow side too, and not very friendly wait staff.  I think this is a good place to go to if you want a decent fancy/expensive meal in a nice location but don't care much about exciting or inventive dishes.

Service was slow - ordered coffees and juice and took more than 15 minutes to arrive. Last time I checked coffee takes only a couple minutes to make and I'm sure they aren't squeezing their own juices.   Food was decent - started off with the deviled eggs (not bad) and monkey bread (pretty much a regular cinnamon roll). Entree- the short rib was a bit dry and salty. The chicken sandwich was well made but I have had better.   Overall, I guess this would be a convenient spot for brunch for us who live in soma (and want to avoid long lines everywhere else).",

Palomino was a frequent choice, but I generally steer the conversation to Prospect. The roast chicken salad is very tasty, as is their burger. My favorite appetizer is the kobe beef tartare with shaved black truffle, and the scallops with risotto is wonderfully buttery. Only three scallops, but a little portion control never hurts.",

    "review_text": "Seriously I came here twice in one day.   Lunch: I ordered the soup (delicious lobster bisque) and the chicken roulade. The soup was so warm and inviting. The chicken was very moist and risotto that came with the dish was so delicious as well. The mushrooms (and I don't even like mushrooms) were good. Dessert was the best one I've had in a LONG time. The salted caramel chocolate tart. That was amazing. I loved the caramel and the chocolate ganache covering the entire tart. The ice cream was good and complemented the tart very well.   Dinner: Now for dinner (which was only about 3 hours later), I ordered the scallops and the duck. Whenever I go out I like to look on yelp and see what everyone else loves, and they suggested these two. The scallops were delicious. Cooked amazingly with a great caramelization on them. The duck was fatty, but oh so good. I mean the fattiness is part of eating duck really. \u00a0I went with a lighter dessert the sorbet. I wanted to try the honey ice cream, but they ran out, so I just went the apple sorbet.   Overall, I had a great time both times and definitely would go back - especially for recruiting.",

We came here for a late birthday dinner for my fiance and the waiter took the dessert off of our bill.   Aside from the libations and service, the food is uneven (at best) and the portions are very small. We ordered three appetizers (squid stuffed with shredded pork, tuna tartar and scallops) and an entree (the duck). The scallops were overcooked; the squid was a bit rubbery, especially combined with the stringy pulled pork, the tuna tartar was the best of the three, but there was barely any of it! The duck was well cooked, with crispy skin and nice medium rare center.   We shared the ice cream sandwich for dessert. It was good, but unspectacular.   Overall, I was disappointed by my dinner at Prospect. The bar menu actually looked pretty promising so we might go back for dinner at the bar/lounge area. Definitely not worth the money.",

    "review_text": "Excellent fancy pricey dinners here that attract a business casual or better crowd, but this review is for brunch.  Prospect is actually reasonably priced for brunch! But I suppose it's also due to all the decent to great brunch competition in SF and that corner of the city alone. The crowd was decidedly younger and more casual dressed; the restaurant was maybe half full at any given time. Brunch seems like a good ploy to lure in the younger crowd, and get them more intrigued about the pricier dinners. At least our super talkative waiter really hyped dinners up. On to the food:  The pumpkin beignets were pretty good, but I wish they tasted fresher. They weren't as warm as you'd expect if it came recently out of the fryer and into the sugar; oh wait, it may have been our over-caffeinated waiter being a tad extra enthusiastic about his accent and us not wanting to be too rude by stuffing our faces while he spoke, haha (he was cool though; just wish that if our food doesn't need a little cooling down when it's served, I'd love the friendly banter more during order/dessert taking ;). I'm guessing they also prep batches in advance given the volume, so they can squeeze in a little of the pumpkin sauce filling more efficiently. They come with a ton of chocolate and bourbon caramel sauces, but they can be overpowering relative to the pumpkin flavor if you use too much.  Pork cheek cassoulet was very tasty; get it. Heard they have a similar version using swordfish for dinner. The omelete of the day (chard and goat cheese) was a healthy portioned size, not overly huge like say, Stacks. That was good as well, although I most enjoyed their slice of their perfectly toasted buttery epi baguette, so simple and so good... It also came with roasted potatoes, but eh nothing special there.  Lastly, we topped it off with a bag of their cacao nib carmel popcorn. They gave it to us in a cute little Prospect brown bag, which was great for taking to go and munching along the bay. Hooray for brunch!",

    "review_text": "My chauffeur, Alfred, pulled up along the curb right in front of Prospect. \u00a0He opened my door... and as I stepped out with my beautiful wife, I made sure to put my elegantly carved wooden cane to use for my bad right knee. \u00a0To be sure I was on time for happy hour, I pulled out my Audemars Piguet classic pocket watch from my charcoal grey n textured custom tailored Zegna sports coat. \u00a0Ah... perfect 3:51pm. \u00a09 minutes until happy hour menu would start. \u00a0I started to make my way to the entrance while Alfred closed my Bentley door behind me. \u00a0Before I even made it to the door, their entire staff including their chef, manager, and owners quickly gathered to greet me. \u00a0Swell.  My love and I made ourselves comfortable on their sofa while we thoroughly enjoyed their wood grains and contemporary decor throughout the restaurant... what grandeur. \u00a0We got things started with a happy hour sparkling for my lady... it was very acidic and sour as if it were a pure sparkling lemonade with no sugar. \u00a0To our luck, it was a very warm weekend so the sparkling turned out to be quite refreshing. \u00a0We most likely won't be ordering that again. \u00a0For a more substantial cocktail, I had the Booker's Old Fashioned, a very attractive mix of Booker's gin, agave nectar, prospect bitters, on 3 cubes of ice and lemon rind. \u00a0Quite the sipper... but they must've thought I couldn't hold my liquor because it was a small cocktail filling about less than a third of the rock glass maybe even a fourth if it wasn't for the ice.  A few happy hour snacks before our fancy and lavish dinner to seduce our appetite for the night. \u00a0My palate danced with their devils of basil pesto and cherry tomatoes... egg? basil? pesto? devils? \u00a0Some of my favorite things in life all in one. \u00a0Exquisite. \u00a0Fried Shishito and Jimmy Nardell Peppers... accompanied by a wonderfully crispy pork belly and wasabi breadcrumbs. \u00a0Peppers and pork belly... mouthwatering. \u00a0Wasabi... irrelevant although the breadcrumbs were a nice light crunch. \u00a0The Saffron Arancini were fried to crispy golden little spheres with a fluffy risotto-like filling. \u00a0What was not to love? \u00a0Last, the Chicken Liver Mousse with dates and pickled shallots on crostini. \u00a0A little too sweet for my tastes but was enjoyable nonetheless.  I'd say that was a successful happy hour...  HOWEVER... Let's straighten out some fibs and confirm some truths to my story.  I don't have a chauffeur and I drive a toyota. \u00a0The only Bentley I can afford at the moment is the one in my dreams. \u00a0I am not married... but I very well should be because my gf is just amazing. \u00a0I don't have expensive fancy Zegna tailored suits, a luxurious Audemars Piguet pocket watch, or a rich man's cane. \u00a0I had my cap on with blue jeans and a t-shirt. \u00a0My knee isn't in its best shape... that is true. \u00a0I wasn't headed to an extravagant dinner, rather it was going to be some quick home cooking. \u00a0 I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that my beautiful gf and my bad knee wasn't enough to get any greeting whatsoever at the door. \u00a0We sat ourselves without being greeted even though they saw us walk in. \u00a0Maybe if I had a Bentley or a nice designer suit, then that server I approached would have perhaps given me better help with my questions about their happy hour. \u00a0No smile, no eye contact WHILE we were having a quick Q&amp;A. \u00a0He looked rather flustered with wiping down the happy hour leather padded menus I so desperate wanted to look at. \u00a010 minutes before happy hour would start, I asked the bartender if there was a happy hour drink menu I could see... he says it's not 4pm yet. \u00a0That was it... that was all to his answer. \u00a0I think it wouldn't hurt to let me see the menu though. \u00a0Funny because the server said the same thing when I asked to see the happy hour food menu while he was wiping them down but he didn't let me see a menu until I insisted he hand me one just so I know what I would want to order once their kitchen opens at 4. \u00a0They weren't mean about it or anything but the air about the whole place and the staff was a little snooty and arrogant. \u00a0Just stating the obvious. \u00a0Their happy hour menu is pretty tasty and pricing is very reasonable. \u00a0I've been here quite a few times for dinner and it's delicious!  Normally it'd be a 4+ at my dinners but 3.5 this time and I will have to round down on this one for a 3.",

Succulent, melts in your mouth and again potatoes can be replaced with greens, get the Brussel sprouts.  3) Halibut- cooked to perfection.   4) Kale and Radicchio salad with goat cheese- GET IT! Do I need to say more?  5) Hawaiian Kampachi- LOVE THIS ONE. This dish has an array of flavors that just plays so well in your mouth.   6) California Burrata- just okay. Had better one somewhere in the Mission. Comes with pork belly and sundried tomatoes.   7) Strawberry Rhubarb Crepes- delicious and not overly sweet. Perfect pairing with a Red port wine.  8) Caramel popcorn - Delicious!!!   9) Ice Cream Sandwhiches- aacording to my team- tasty!!  10) For the Gin lovers like me, ask them to make the High Thyme with Gin instead of Vodka. Luv it!!!! Can have 4 or 5 of this.   Service is excellent and our server made really great recommendations.  Great place for Happy Hour because the place is packed on a Thursday evening!!

This place does a superb brunch. With a partially rotating menu due to its use of seasonal ingredients, it offers a nice selection of both sweet and savory fare. The ricotta doughnuts are a must try...it's like a beignet, but levels better.   Today, I got the Peaches and Cream pancakes: cream cheese pancakes, peach syrup, brul\u00e9ed peaches, whipped mascarpone, and honeycomb. (I added a side of bacon.) Mmm. \u00a0And to drink, the Spring to Life: Gin, Raspberry Gum, Grapefruit, Soda, and Rhubarb bitters. Need I say more?  The service here is beyond excellent. The staff is always courteous and helpful. I rarely find myself in need of anything. The ambience is one of modern decadence with a bit of a hipster touch.

Service was great and the food was delicious.

Food/drink- I ordered the pork chop ($33.5) and it was pretty huge and cooked perfectly, it came with purple sweet potato gnocchi and endive which were good and the dish was nicely seasoned with asian pear, pomegranate relish and escarole cream (that I had asked to be served on the side and they did). I had a class of Sancerre ($14), recommended by the waiter when I asked for dry wine and it was sooo good! I chose their house made pear sorbet ($4.5) for dessert and it tasted like a really ripe pear, it also came with an almond biscotti cookie that was light and yum.  I've dined here previously for dinners and brunch as well. Never disappointed.

We ordered the following apps/entrees:  -Prospect Spiced Fries, \u00a0 Aioli - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=BP3q6sfToMw7Kd8nyghWeA#BP3q6sfToMw7Kd8nyghWeA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pros\u2026</a>  -Foie Gras - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=sBeE3zeJ2RDkpLPXXtNA6g#sBeE3zeJ2RDkpLPXXtNA6g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pros\u2026</a>  -Snake River Farms Kobe Bavette  -Pork Chop (don't remember the name) - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=Fefjiqp88VZ8kybp0S7t_w#Fefjiqp88VZ8kybp0S7t_w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pros\u2026</a>  -Liberty Valley Duck Breast - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=5jkN59MfSXIoF8tX0m3X4Q#5jkN59MfSXIoF8tX0m3X4Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pros\u2026</a>  -Grilled Local Swordfish - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=VNYPynfldAwxyNtgTKv-Og#VNYPynfldAwxyNtgTKv-Og\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pros\u2026</a>  -Short-Ribs (don't remember the name as it was a special) - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=or4mchzA1Bz7KhyGEMo5Bw#or4mchzA1Bz7KhyGEMo5Bw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pros\u2026</a>  The fries were served with an aioli sauce. \u00a0It was pretty tasty, but a bit too crunchy (I think it may have been a little burnt). \u00a0  The duck liver pate was decent, but I had better in France.   Everyone seemed to enjoy their entree as I didn't hear any complaints. \u00a0I ordered the pork chop, which I thought was DELICIOUS. \u00a0It was very juicy \u00a0and nicely brined, which was a plus. \u00a0It's probably one of the best pork chops I've ever eaten at a restaurant as usually pork chops come out dry. \u00a0I really enjoyed this dish.  Dessert:  -Ice Cream Sandwiches - must order! \u00a0this was DELICIOUS! -Beignets - not memorable  Wrap Up: \u00a0 Prospect is Boulevard's spin-off. \u00a0Prior to coming here, I had heard mixed reviews about the place so I didn't know what to expect. \u00a0I was skeptical of trying Prospect as I wasn't a fan of Boulevard at all. \u00a0However, I'm glad I ate here as the food was great. \u00a0The service is definitely better here than Boulevard.",

    "review_text": "I am pleased to tell you that my friends and I decided to dine at your restaurant for a special Birthday. The entire Restaurant was phenomenon and not a single detail was left unfinished; from the French doors to the silver ware to the art work all around. We were really impressed. We were quickly seated after valet and coat check-in - major plus. After some time looking over the thought-out menu, we decided to go with a couple bottles of wine, appetizers and dinner choice. The presentation of each meal was set to perfection. The taste of each bite was orgasmic. We had a good time, chattering, laughing, drinking and it felt nice.   Unfortunately, I have to report that there was a couple disappointing factors that would prevent us from returning or recommending your restaurant to others. Please hear me out and let me know your thoughts:  1.) Our server, Gregory, seems extremely busy during his attendance with us. He seemed rushed and flustered when prompted with questions about the wine options. He failed to check on us during dinner time. We scanned for him in the vicinity of our table and when we found him, he was so busy; we could not get eye contact. We ended up flagging another server to request for more wine and water. This is very disappointing as this made the experience less enjoyable considering the stature of the restaurant.  2.) After our plates have been cleared from our tables, we were left unattended for about 15 minutes. I was very annoyed by this point so I asked another employee to grab our server. When Greg arrived, I asked him what kind of desert is available for birthdays since he did not give us a desert Menu. He answered with \"Ice cream sundae but we have other options\". Seeing that he failed to even offer one desert menu, we just went ahead with the Ice cream option. After what it seems like poor customer service, we decided to just ask for the check.  3.) Greg brought our check over; we gave him a couple cards in addition to cash as we split up the bill. . He brought back our cards to sign but failed to bring back any change. We were hoping to get some change back since we wanted to tip the Valet guy. I was really surprise and for the first time, the server doesn't return my change. What if I wanted to tip from my Card and Keep some cash for our next endeavor?  Overall, I can not recommend this place whether it's a birthday, meeting or just a hang out. Not sure how to qualify to get better service as I see others on here giving them 4-5 stars.  10/23/14 - After having a horrible experience the first time, I got in touch with management. Quickly Cathy turned things around for me. She convinced me to try again and apologize for my first experience. I brought my boyfriend to try it for himself and we were very pleased. The Staff were extremely professional, warm and helpful. Each made our dining experience a 5 Star. I was thrilled to meet Cathy as she was such a kind and sincere person. I'm glad she is part of Management because she truly handled this kind of problem very well. BTW, besides knowing how to fix a problem and providing great customer service, the food was amazing. My taste buds were going crazy with each bite. The Steak was cook to perfection. I'm definitely coming back.",

It's of a higher end restaurant so both the ambiance and services are great. Went there on a Monday evening and it was so \"happening\" and busy and since we had made reservation we didn't have to wait.   I enjoyed everything we ordered, including beef ribeye, salmon, ahi tuna tartar and a bread and salad dish. Loved the beets that came with the salmon dish, and the arugula that came with the burrata dish. The ingredients were fresh and the flavors were great and the portions were just right for the two of us to share. The dark chocolate ganache cake was also great, not overly sweet.

    "review_text": "Oh. My. God.  Last night 3 friends and I had dinner at Prospect after not feeling Waterbar post a few drinks in the cold...we wanted something hearty and warming and boy did we pick the right spot!  We started with the white truffle gnocchi (2 orders), seared scallops, and cucumber avocado crab salad. The white truffle gnocchi is a game changer, I could literally eat pounds of it. And then probably succumb to heart failure, but it would be well worth it. The scallops were also delightful and perfectly prepared, and the avo crab salad was fresh and delicious, seasoned perfectly with a Thai flair.  Two of us then had the Kobe bavette- so good. Whatever that sauce is...it is like crack! I couldn't stop scraping my plate to get one last taste! Another friend ordered the halibut which was also delicious, perfectly flaky and tender, not over seasoned so as to mask the fish. Wonderful. The last member of our party had the swordfish. Wow. This dish was killer! So much flavor, nice and steaky as swordfish should be, but tender as all hell. Just amazing.  We didn't stop there. Of course not- how could we neglect desert?!?! We got the bon bons, the mint ice cream sandwich, and the cheese plate. All were incredible beyond measure, but the mint ice cream sandwich really resonated with me. The mint in the ice cream was fresh and bursting with organic flavor, no mint syrup used here! So good. I am depressed that this meal is over.  Service was also amazing. Our server Anson was friendly, super helpful, and made legit suggestions without seeming to push anything. In a city where bad servers abound, Anson really shines! The Sommelier was excellent as well; the first bottle we ordered had oxidized a bit and thus I regretfully had to send it back. He was extremely accommodating, as was his assistant, and cruised right on over to help me select a replacement. The replacement, by the way, was such a great bottle of wine I wanted to drown in it!   Overall this place is awesome! I have come for lunch a lot, but the dinner menu is absolutely worth testing out! Woohoo Prospect!!",

    "review_text": "Went here for my mom's birthday and was not disappointed.  Walking in, you are greeted with the modern looking bar with glass windows looking out onto the streets. Go back a bit more, and you enter the dining room with their nice pieces of artwork and table set ups.  Choice of Water: Tap or Sparkling, complimentary for both.  What I had the privilege try:  Seared Day Boat Scallops with truffle shavings and potato Gnochi: The scallop was cooked perfectly on this dish and its flavored enhanced by the truffle sauce and the truffle shavings. Not to mention the potato gnochi was nice and fluffy and soaked up the truffle sauce to top it off.  Seared Monterey Abalone with Crispy Pig Trotters: The highlight of the dish was truly the crispy pig trotters. If they made a dish of that alone, I'd be all over it. The trotters were nice and crispy and was a mountain of flavor in your mouth. The abalone wasn't too bad either, but it was overshadowed by the trotters. Still a solid dish nonetheless.  Snake Rivver Farm Kobe Bavette: This was my first time having bavette but I am a true believer now. The meat was so tender and juicy that it really melted in my mouth. Along with the mushrooms and potatos, it made for a well prepared dish.  Local King Salmon with Crispy Skin. The salmon was well cooked and full of flavor and was only made better with the addition of the nice and crispy skin.  Liberty Valley Duck breast: the duck was cooked just the way i like it with the fat and nice tender bites. The flavor was all soaked into it and every bite released the juices of satisfaction.  Dessert: Unfortunately they just stopped serving the ice cream sandwiches the week before so we tried the Chocolate Praline Bonbons with Valrhona Fudgesicle, Caramel Cream, candied rice crispies, and chocolate sabayon  I enjoyed the dessert very much. The rice crispies went great with the caramel cream and sauces on the plate. The bonbons themselves were deliciously chocalatey (emphasis on the chocolate part) and would satisfy any chocolate lover. Although i was looking for a softer middle (like vanilla ice cream filled bon bons), the more solid chocolate middle wasn't too bad either.  Although the food was all fine and dandy, my only qualm was the plates weren't warm coming out and the food on the dish was at best luke warm. Otherwise, I really enjoyed my experience here.",

The short ribs were very tender but you only get about four slices. \u00a0My companions said the special of the day oyster po boy was good but not the fried chicken ramen. \u00a0She said she had it better elsewhere.  Ordered the apple pie sundae and came to my shocking surprise that the small cup of sundae cost $11!! The sundae had two small scoops of ice cream, one small scoop of whipped cream and about a table spoon of Apple meat with cookie crust.) \u00a0 It's part my fault that I didn't pay attention on the price on the menu. \u00a0The point is I'd pay for a $11 dessert if it's worth the price but this sundae completely not worth the price. \u00a0It's not very often I felt ripped off but this sundae definitely was one so be warned.

Not making THAT much, I still didn't feel awkward, so bonus points to you, Prospect!  Scallops: Pretty nicely done. It was just a TOUCH less seared than I'd like (I kind of like that nice brown crust you get from a hard sear in contrast with the soft scallops), but the taste was really good.  Soft Shelled Crab: This...had the crisp I was missing a bit from the scallops. It was to a point of overly crispy, but it might have to do with the fact that I only had a claw/leg of the appetizer.   Stuffed Quail: Only had a bite of this off my friend's plate. It was good, albeit a bit overly salty. The stuffing was the salty part, and it was SO good, but my friends couldn't finish the stuffing because it was overly salted. Maybe if they paired some bread...but I feel like that might be blasphemous. The quail was done very well and was super tasty. Lots of rosemary taste, so if you like that, it's a winner.  Pork: I had a bite of this as well, and it was good. Almost made me wish I ordered this instead. \u00a0The pork was done perfectly - just a touch pink in the center, which always makes me happy. It's terrible to overcook pork, and if you have good quality meat (which, I assume Prospect does), it's nice to highlight the meat. Juicy. Yum!  Swordfish: This is what I decided on, and it was pretty solid. It came with some potatoes (papas = fried potatoes), which were good with the sauce it came in (aioli maybe?). The swordfish was cooked very nicely. I've had overcooked swordfish which is not good. This one was juicy, and cut like a fish steak. It was so good.   Our service was good, until about the end. Our waiter was very nice and friendly, but near the end, he inadvertently became part of the table conversation. One friend mentioned something about hitting the table, and our waiter banged the water carafe on the table...which made my other friend laugh (with a full mouth). She couldn't explain, and he seemed to get a bit upset. Our service went from warm to cool, and there's no blaming him for that. Overall though, the service and staff were very good and on point.

Both times there were problems with the kitchen and the speed an accuracy of service, so I though, I'll just let them get through their growing pains. And I haven't thought of going again based on those poor experiences.  Yesterday I was invited to a business lunch with two colleagues. \u00a0We ordered an appetizer to share, then each of us ordered a salad an an entree. We were just finishing the appetizer when a back waiter appeared with what seemed to be our first course. No, he had in hand the entrees ordered by my two friends, and a salad for me that was not the salad I (or any of us) had ordered. We told him it was wrong, he took all three plates away and our main waitress came over. She seemed to have a hard time understanding what had happened but said she'd fix it.  Then the back waiter returned with my colleague's same main course (the same dish, stone cold) AND her salad, my other colleague's main dish again (no salad), and nothing for me.  I told my friends to please start eating without me, and they did. By the time my salad arrived, they were basically done. It was at least 15 minutes. very awkward.  Then they rushed my entree out and the back waiter plonked it on the table in front of me while I was still eating my salad. Literally mid-bite. BY the way, my entree (risotto with a poached egg) was so rushed that the egg was badly undercooked - the white was still basically liquid. I feel sick thinking of it.  The waitress offered by way of apology to take my salad off the bill, which was a nice touch, but when the bill came, it was still there. The manager came over with little baggies of sweet popcorn for us as an apology and we had to remind her that the waitress forgot to take off the item.  All in all it was a cluster-&amp;*^% and a waste of time and money. The waitress and manager both seemed nice, but honestly, this place just can't get it together after all this time.

    "review_text": "Though the interior design did not put me off particularly, my more-travelled girlfriend couldn't help but liken it to a hotel bar in a nice airport Marriott in Kansas City or Atlanta. I was last here closer to its opening, a time when the d\u00e9cor might have seemed fresher than it does now.  House cocktails were interesting but generally too sweet. We had the Anti-Hero, an almost candy-like drink where the sharpness of white rye is completely lost, and the D.B. Cooper, a much better concoction with good mouthfeel that just didn't quite make it from \"interesting\" to \"delicious.\" I would never complain about such a drink, though: I love trying interesting cocktails even if I might not choose to order one again. I wonder, though, how far the program must have strayed from Brooke Arthur's original vision to arrive where it is now.  House olives were tasty.  Oysters (six for $21) were a variety I wasn't familiar with but which did have a surprising complexity. Some were so creamy the finish couldn't quite cleanse but overall I did enjoy them.  Green Goddess salad had great flavor and texture. The presentation was confusing -- with all the green goddess hidden inside a shell of lettuces we thought we might have gotten the wrong dish. In the end, though, we wished the chef had stuck with little gems; the baby lettuces added more bitterness than the dish called for.  Burger was above average though the bun had no structure. The fries were disappointing (too fat and starchy) but accompanied by outstanding aioli.  Later we asked for a dry Manhattan with Rendezvous Rye and got one made with dry vermouth. When questioned the bartender said, \"oh you meant dry like a dry martini.\" At least he made us a new one, but no color of Dolin vermouth is going to make a Manhattan worth paying $14 for. (We asked but no other variety of vermouth was available. What fancy bar in SF does't have Carpano or Punt y Mes?)   By the end of our time at the bar the bartender had apparently decided we weren't worth the trouble as we had to ask the barback for our check. After I placed the card in the presenter, another long wait was broken by the barback taking the check presenter and placing it into the bartender's field of view.  Later that night as we got ready for bed, I couldn't help but compare two receipts in my wallet from this week: one from Wexler's ($106) where we'd just days ago had a truly wonderful and memorable meal and the one from Prospect ($112) where the experience dripped with disappointment.",
