Across from us was a couple with a cute fluffy dog that they let sit in a chair with them before going over to pee on the rosemary! \u00a0Felt like Chuck E Cheese than an expensive, romantic San Francisco. \u00a0Isn't there a health code to control these thoughtless people? Or at least a trained manager?",

Unfortunately our entire group of 8 sat around for well over a half hour before they ended up seating us. We made reservations for 9pm not 9:45. We had plans that night for our friend's birthday so it was incredibly inconvenient to say the least. The Manager did end up apologizing and giving us all our appetizers for free (we must have had 5) so that was a nice gesture.  We sat down, had our appetizers, a drink, then... ended up sitting around for another 20+ minutes before I had to frantically wave my hand in the direction of a couple of servers, who were standing there talking to one another for them to fetch our waitress. We finally ordered our food and they gave us another appetizer for waiting so long for our waitress. That's nice and all but we don't want to stuff ourselves on appetizers, we just want our dinners and to go out and have fun!   Even though they have a tiny menu. to be honest though, the food was all delicious. They definitely know how to cook their meat. We got prime rib, pork ribs, a filet and another steak. It was all delicious! One of our friends fish was raw and had to be remade, so again we had to wait for him to finish. We didn't end up getting out of there until 11:30. \u00a0On another note, they do have nice decor, some nice fireplaces, and live piano.   4 stars for food, 2 star for service = 3 stars.",

One of their other great dishes is the burger! \u00a0They grind the meat every morning, and is the juiciest and best burger you will ever have. \u00a0I am not huge into burgers, but I have come back to Hillstone just for their burger!  As for appetizers, I would definitely go with the artichoke! \u00a0It's the combination of the grilled artichokes and the r\u00e9moulade that make them so good. \u00a0 They grill them in house. \u00a0So great, and I always finish the r\u00e9moulade before the artichokes and have to get more. \u00a0  I have got the prime rib here. \u00a0It was good, but if your going for great prime rib, I would suggest you to go to House of Prime Rib. \u00a0I would recommend my friends on one of the other options.  They have a good wine selection and reasonably priced. \u00a0And a great modern steakhouse atmosphere.",

We ordered the apple walnut cobbler for dessert, which was pretty good but had too much caramel sauce.  All in all the service was pretty good, attentive but not overly so, and she brought everything we asked for. \u00a0For the prices I'm unlikely to eat here unless there's an expense account involved, but the quality of the food seems quite good overall.",

But, then I was happily surprised when our waitress came over to tell us there was a chocolate mousse special! So, we got that. yum yum.

Not a problem b/c we didn't have reservations, so we checked out the menu (way more expensive than it should be) while we waited and everything sounded great! We were standing right next to the kitchen and on a few occasions I started to salivate when I noticed a giant rack of ribs grilling away. I also saw a very large, nice steak on that grill, so that's what I had my mind set on.   We sat down at our table and the restaurant is very nice, a bit dark for my taste. Our waiter, remains nameless, got our drinks and took our order, so far so good. I ordered the Hawaiian Rib Eye (we were on a budget so we decided to share) and the Tuna Salad. Both came out at the same time, which I'm not a fan of b/c a salad, in my book, usually comes before the entree, but what the F do I know. The salad was giant, tasted great, although they skimped on the avocado and I'm Mexican, so you know I'm all about some avocado. The steak look great, was cooked exactly as we asked, BUT, for $30, trim the fuckin fat off that bitch!!! I mean come on, I had a lil pile o fat on my plate and that's just fuckin nasty!  Mr. Waiter was too busy folding napkins, with his back to the tables, to come over and hook me up with some more soda, which is cool b/c I asked another waitress and she hooked me up. Overall I'd say the food was good, not great and a bit overpriced.  Pet Peeve #1 in the guest handbook: DO NOT leave me the check while I am eating my dessert! That's just not cool b/c nobody wants to spend that kinda cash and be told GET THE FUCK OUT, I have better things to do. What did Mr. Waiter do during dessert?? Yup, you guessed, check on the table while eating dessert with the casual \"Whenever your ready sir\" comment. That's boots dude. I wasn't pissed, I was trying to be compassionate, maybe he had a long day or a shitty day, whatever, but you know I had to mention that on my yelp review. FFFEEEWWW, now I can go about my day in Peace.  I would go back again, not soon, but I would and I think the food was really good, despite the minor detail mentioned above.",

Spinach &amp; Artichoke Dip: So why are they wasting plate space with sour cream and salsa? \u00a0The headliner had awesomely tender artichoke, non-bitter spinach and enough cheese to make my cardiologist afford a U.C. school for his kids! \u00a0The nachos were standard, but fresh. \u00a0Really wish they ditched the sour cream and salsa for more spinach &amp; artichoke dip.  Rib Eye: One of the specials with a creamy mushroom sauce. \u00a0Better than Tad's, but not up to steakhouse quality. \u00a0Too thin. \u00a0Definitely not a repeat.  Barbecue Pork Ribs: Friends and Yelp reviews were right, the ribs are so fall of the bone tender. \u00a0I like how they grill them up before serving to give a crispy edge. \u00a0Was not a fan of the BBQ sauce, was way too generic. \u00a0They need to take lessons from Oola's sauce.  Baked Potato: Huge. \u00a0The real bacon was a nice touch. \u00a0The sour cream and cheddar was tasty, but far from sophisticated.  Brussels Sprouts: Pretty bland. \u00a0I'm so used to pancetta, truffle oil and parmesan that I forgot mainstream brussels sprouts are unpopular for good reason.",

The spinach dip was good and the prime rib was a good thick cut - it was a rather big dish, if you ask me! I was pretty much begging my BF to finish my prime rib with big, puppy eyes... in which he had to decline because he was surprisingly full as well. The meat was tender and overall it was pretty good (I would order it again). I had requested to have my prime rib come with a baked potato but somehow the server confused it as me wanting the alternative side dish. When the prime rib came out with the other side dish, I told her about the confusion and she quickly apologized and gave me a baked potato on the house! Man, that baked potato was good! I think I was talking about the baked potato more than the prime rib (but then again, I'm pretty much obsessed with baked potatoes, haha).  I love the atmosphere of Hillstone! It was rather dark with a lot of wood elements and the pine cone-looking lights were beautiful. Definitely intimate/romantic! The noise level wasn't too bad either, especially since we sat near a corner of the restaurant.  I definitely would love to come back here and try out other dishes! Oh, and their cocktails too!",

I ordered the roasted chicken with mashed potatoes as did my boyfriend. The chicken was really dry and you really had to smother it in the juice in order for it to get any flavor. But there wasn't enough juice. The potatoes were mediocre and weren't great tasting or anything.  We did order thsi brownie dessert that was actually pretty good. Not overly sweet. Oh and we also ordered the cheese toast. Now the cheese toast is good. If you go, you have to order that. I think it's pretty unique and i haven't tasted anything like it anywhere else before.

The atmosphere is great, food is great, service is great, and Rachel, our server was par excellence.   The only thing wrong with this place is the bar scene, which is basically comprised of only people whop are waiting for their reservations. It is not that vibrant! No sexy girls in black dresses getting loopy on cosmopolitans, and no guys getting their \"drink on\" before the hitting the town. The bartenders make seriously weak drinks. They use a jigger, which to me is a death sentence. This place would a regular hang out for me if they figured our their bar scene. That being said, though they have weak drinks, not having any corkage fee is a huge compensating factor.   Everything on the menu rocks. The crab cakes are some of the best I have ever had because they don't grind up the crab. They use chinks the size of of a small Asian's pinky finger. Excellent!!    My only criticism on the food \u00a0is that the two best meat dishes they have (double cut pork chop and Hawaiian rib eye), though cooked to perfection, have very sweet seasoning, which takes away from the true flavor of the meat.   Overall this place is fantastic, and the change from Houston's to Hillstone has added a few more arrows to its quiver.",

If you're proposing to your future wife, they will gladly come and ruin the moment for you to sell you their dessert. We ordered cognac to have the waitress go away for a while, and she came back with the bill without us asking for it.  Basically, they took the initiative to end the night, our conversation on our behalf.   I spoke to the manager after this, she came back and she interrupted our conversation as well to apologize.

The overall decor is very welcoming and cozy. There is a large bar as you enter, with screens if you want to catch a game or tune in the news. The staff is incredibly friendly and warm and are very attentive. There are comfy spacious booths, beautiful lighting, a fireplace and even a jazz \u00a0band on the weekends that ads a special touch to any visit.  And I haven't even gotten to the food yet.........omg. I am never dissapointed by this place. I've tried (almost) everything on the menu, but my favorite by far is the pork chop. The most perfectly cooked piece of meat I have ever had in my life. Trust me, everything on the menu is amazing.  I highly recommend this restaurant, it is one of my favorites and frequent is at least once a month. 2 thumbs way up.",

First, I had to wait 20 minutes for the waitress to bring a menu and water to me (and I was sitting at the bar) and I watched her take orders from everyone else who walked up to the bar. Then I had to wait another 20 before I had to approach another bar tender at the other end of the bar to place my order. Second, I ordered the artichoke appetizer and 1/3 of the way through I found a WORM roasted right along with my artichoke...gulp! I didn't make a big fuss, but the manager never came over to apologize for the \"gross error!\" \u00a0The waitress was apologetic and once the restaurant crowd died down was much more attentive. But needless to say, I will wait for my next trip back to DC before I go to \"Houston's\" again.... :(",

    "review_text": "**Friends of mine wanted to go - so we did...NEVER AGAIN.   SO, I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about...this place is barely even a 1-star. The food is BLAND and boring to say the least. My house salad was \u00a0the best thing and that's not good. The people we went with got the burger, the rib-eye, the 'Cajun' fish (they should be ashamed to use the word 'Cajun' for that fish, it was cooked well but BLAND and flavorless). I got the veggie burger which was so dry and grainy that I could only eat half the patty and couldn't even have the bun. The whole thing was super dry. The fries were good, but really, how hard is that?   Our server was cheery which was a far cry from the gals behind the front of the house...they looked miserable and they were! When we left, they didn't so much as say a single 'Thanks' or 'Bye' - and there were three of them just standing there!   I cannot for the life of me understand WHY WHY WHY are so many people flocking to this place and what is it about their terrible food that hooks them? It's not upscale dining, the chairs at the tables are conference room chairs (with wheels!)...the booths are dated...I just cannot see the appeal. It's not a steakhouse, it's not a burger place, they can grill fish, but don't know how to season it and if you are vegetarian, forget it, you can have a salad or a super dry veggie burger...they don't even have a single pasta dish for vegetarians.   Meh/ Blah/ Never-again...to say the least...I'd rather go anyplace else but here. If you want steak, go to Harris' or Epic, not much more $$$. If you want a burger, there are several other places you can go. If you want fish, go to Catch on Market or Woodhouse on Market or Fillmore...there is no reason to come to this chain in San Francisco with so many other amazing restaurants waiting to be discovered.",

    "review_text": "The last time I was there, It was called Houston. Why the name change?  We actually went there because they had a chain in Napa that we liked. I believed it was called Rutherford Grill. They got great corn bread.   That night, we were a group of four. The wait was a bit long and we were hungry. We decided to order the shrimp cocktail which was very expensive (almost like $5 a piece).   Once we were seated, the waiter took our drink orders which we all got the sweeten ice tea. To our surprise, the ice tea was not a free refill like the ones in Napa. They did re-fill one more time for us thou, and told us the next re-fill would be charged.   As we all made our decision on what we wanted for our meals, most of us got the soup and one got the salad. To our surprise, we saw a tiny slug like worm moving really fast on the outer edge of the salad bow. We flag the waiter right away and she took it away. After that, the manager dropped by our table and apologized. He did ask if we would like another salad or maybe soup for replacement. The friend who order the salad didn't want soup or salad anymore. The manager at the time asked if everything is okay, we said that would be fine and he walked away. After the manager walked away, we started to compare how the service are with Olive Garden or Black Angus with Houston. At Olive Garden, the manager would of comp our meals after giving us such a bad experience like being stingy with the ice tea re-fill and the worm in the salad. We just laugh it off and try to continue enjoying our dinner.   After finishing our dinner, the checks came. We all chipped in and one of use decided to keep the cash while he charges it on his credit card. Dinner that night was about $180, but when the waiter brought back the receipt for signing, the charge on the credit card was like $1,800. We finally had enough of the disappointing dinner night and calls for the manager back. We informed him how they seemed very cocky and for a 5 star restaurant the service was a lot worst then Olive Garden. The manager was shock and said, \"I can't believe you're comparing us to Olive Garden!\". I informed him that if we were eating there, they would totally taken care of us. They would not being stingy on the refill, and they would of at least offer us desserts. With having a bad experience at a 5 star restaurant, not once they offer us anything, but instead they gave us their stingy attitudes and on top of it all, they over charged on the credit card about $1,600.  After that, the manager did comp our meals but he still gave us an attitude. Even thou our meals were free, we did leave a $40-50 tip at least just because that should cover the cost of the food itself and we're not there to take advantage of a free meal like the manager thinks we were. We will never return to this place again.   As we were about to drive off, the waiter stopped us and gave us a $50 gift certificate. Why? If they really wanted to give us that, they should of done so before we left. We suspected it's because of the tip.  With the new name and probably a new management, they might, should I give them another chance? There's still so many other restaurants out there to try.",

    "review_text": "I've been here a handful of times, and have had dinner at the bar only, so I can't say anything about the dining area. However, each time that I have been here.. nothing has ever been mediocre.   For starters, I would highly recommend their Home Smoked Salmon, Oak Grilled Artichokes, or Spinach and Artichoke dip. They smoke their own salmon (to perfection) and it comes with some crostinis and a sort of aioli that is perfecttt with it. (Probably so bad for you, but so good, I can't stop myself from smothering the salmon with it, even though the salmon is sooo good on it's own..) The Oak Grilled Artichokes are also very delicious. If you want something more filling, than go with the Spinach and Artichoke dip. Tons of chips, tons of ooeygooey dip. Good stuff.  For an entree, If you want something light, but filling, go for the Thai Steak and Noodle Salad. Delicious! They give you tons of perfectly tender chunks of steak and avocado. The noodles are a nice soft noodle, and the mango lightens it up. Another light dish would be the Flying Tuna Platter. Perfectly seared tuna with mixed greens, chunks of avocado, and mango.   I've heard about their prime rib, but I've yet to try the actual dish. I did however try some prime rib from their Famous French Dip. Layers and layers of melt in your mouth prime rib on a lightly toasted roll, dipped in au jus.. Sooo good! If you're going for the serious meats, the Hawaiian Ribeye is very tasty option. I hear great things about their loaded Baked Potato also.. next time!!   Service is always excellent.  I don't stray too far on the wine list. I usually go for the white table wine, Conundrum. It's nice, light, and sweet. It's not too great with a red meat dish though. Ask Ben for a wine recommendation to go with your meal, or cozy up to a cocktail. I hear those sidecars are quite good...",

The Chicago Style Spinach Dip is a must try appetizer. I love their prime rib as well as their Hawaiian rib eye (there is a sweetness to the rib eye due to a special glaze they use). I also like how their French fries are skinny and fried to perfection. One time after lunch, we splurged on the calories and got a decadent hot fudge sundae, two thumbs up!   The menu is more meat friendly, but they have a couple good vegetarian options as well. For example, their veggie burger is actually very flavorful.  Also if the weather is nice outside, the patio seating is perfect. It gets taken up very fast though since the restaurant has a great view of the Embarcadero.  ~A",

    "review_text": "Came here for a friends birthday dinner last week. We had a reservation and they refused to seat us until our entire party had arrived, there were 11 of us, so it took a little while for everyone to get there.   Once we were seated our waiter came over and started opening the wine we had brought. (best part about this place is that there is no corkage fee!)  I had a really hard time finding something on this menu that I found appealing and that I could eat without having to alter the dish, I have a few nut allergies and a mango allergy that prevented me from eating a lot of their salads and fish dishes.   For dinner I ended up ordering the veggie burger with fries. (Hoping that it would be a \"lighter\" option than a regular burger...) The burger was huge and the fry portion was also very generous. The burgers are house made with brown rice, black beans and oat bran, it was served on a house made bun with jack cheese, lettuce, onion, pickles and tomato. The burger was OK, I felt the patty was a little bland it could have used something else, I'm just not sure what...the fries were pretty good. They were pretty thinly cut so they didn't hold a lot of the oil they were cooked in, which was nice.   I think I would come back to Hillstone for their no corkage fee, if anything. I heard that their french dip is good, maybe I'll try that next time...",

We started off with the Chicago spinach dip ($13) which came piping hot in a ramekin, creamy and neither too salty nor ingenious. Served along side with (I swear that's what it exactly tasted like) Pace Picante' salsa and 2 sm. scoops of sour cream and thin, crispy tortilla chips. \u00a0(the chips were good!) \u00a0We had the cheese toast ($6) which was 4 triangular wedges of French toast type bread, covered with melted cheese. \u00a0It was OK.  We shared 2 orders of the sashimi salad ($18 each) which was really, really good. \u00a0Sashimi -grade Ahi seared on the outside and \u00a0dusted with some blk sesame seeds and a mixed baby salad with a delish dressing. \u00a0BFF &amp; I had the prime rib, a thick 1 in cut slab with bone. \u00a0It was so large that I ended up taking home 1/2 of it. \u00a0It was tender and cooked just right. Some Yelpers have commented that it's better than HOPR, I'd have to disagree. \u00a0They do serve it with a large bowl of au jus and a large baked potato ($28) and \"everything\" comes with sour cream, cheese &amp; real bacon.  Hubs and BFF's hubs had the BBQ pork ribs. \u00a0Heavily darkened with a nice rub and both would comment \"The meat falls off the bone, must've been cooking for hours!\" \u00a0I had a bite, it was OK. \u00a0Came with a cole slaw (good) and DELICIOUS shoestring French fries ($27). \u00a0BFF's hub gave her a few and told me he didn't want to do that becuz he knew she'll be back for more. \u00a0True to form, \u00a0she helped herself to his fries continuously. \u00a0We finished with coffee ($3) or ice tea ($3.50) and hubs had the apple walnut cobbler which was overpoweringly sweet ($8). \u00a0It reminded me of a loosely formed apple oatmeal dish with ample walnut halves over it and topped with a maple ice cream. \u00a0Our friend had the ice cream sundae ($8) which was a large bowl of vanilla ice cream accompanied by a gravy bowl of chocolate sauce (too sweet) to add accordingly. \u00a0  What's cool about the take-home packaging is that they even boxed the horseradish and au jus from my plate in separate containers! \u00a0I loved that au jus, it was good enough to be soup! \u00a0  Our waitress, Aleksi, was friendly and very fast in clearing our tables. \u00a0The place was loaded with people by the time we finished dinner and there were many souls at the bar. \u00a0An open kitchen affords you the view of the frentic rhythmic pace of the staff who all appear to know exactly what they're doing without colliding into each other in the milieu. \u00a0The restaurant has booths and tables for 2-4 in a pleasant atmosphere. \u00a0 They do add 2% health tax to your bill. \u00a0Parking can be challenging but there is a nearby garage with $10 self-parking.",

Another reason why I feel so special here. \u00a0  I always stuff myself silly here. \u00a0I had the grilled artichoke, the chicken sandwich and a brownie to top it off. My date had the french dip. \u00a0We inhaled it all. \u00a0My chicken sandwich came out a little undercooked, but I sent it back and they were extremely pleasant about it. \u00a0No stink eye. \u00a0No sooner than 10 minutes was it back in front of my face being inhaled alongside the fries. \u00a0  Houston's, err I mean Hilllstone, is a consistently fabulous restaurants where you can have a classy time. \u00a0I highly recommend it and I hope you feel special like I do when you dine here.",

Anyhow, we ended up sharing a sashimi tuna salad as a starter - awesome! As an entree, I chose the crab cakes with fries and super cole slaw - all extremely nice. My wife picked the grilled fish with veggies, which I think didn't taste all that good. Now, why only three stars? First of all, I'd say this place is a bit overpriced. We ended up leaving $160 for two (including two aperetifs and two glasses of wine, no dessert).

Either way, I was already uncomfortable with my hunger, so sitting uncomfortably wasn't an issue.   I ordered the Hickory Burger, which include 3 slices of Canadian Bacon (not BACON!), shredded cheddar, diced onions and a decent heap of potato strings (fries, but it's thin like strings!). I have to admit, Canadian Bacon wasn't something I really like, but in a burger, it's easy for everything to connect together. I like the combination that Hillstone's have!   The waiting staff were very professional and flexible from helping us take the orders outside to all the fine detail like ketchup and water.

My salad plate was wet; I was willing to accept that because the plate was chilled, the wetness was caused by being chilled. 5). The wait staff never refilled our water glasses.  6). We ordered coffee with our dessert; We were never asked if we needed a refill.  7). Nothing was done to recognize our guest's birthday; All we got was a \"Happy Birthday,\" when we left. A lit birthday candle would have been nice with our dessert; we got nada.   Our meal was not remarkable at all.   I felt no warmth from the hostess or wait staff; They seemed very busy walking by us but avoiding eye contact throughout our meal, i.e., There was no dining experience;   I have been treated better eating at Denny's or the Olive Garden for ten times less money!   Bye bye Hillstone.",

Quick service at lunch and I love the fresh fish and veggie sides.  On the downside...WAY to overpriced, especially for lunch! The yummy veggies are super yummy because are swimmming in butter and olive oil. Some of their food gives me a headache, maybe a little heavy handed with the salt perhaps. Also, you can't call in an order to pick up???Why??? That is very inconvenient when you only have a few minutes to grab and go!  My work is so close to Houston's that it is hard to go anywhere else, but it is so expensive that it forces me to pack a lunch most days of the week.",

    "review_text": "A and I stopped in after our cruise around the Bay. \u00a0We parked near Houston's so we checked out the menu when we were walking to Pier 43 1/2. \u00a0He spent the rest of our afternoon trying to sell the grilled artichokes to me. \u00a0I LOVE artichokes, so there really wasn't anything to sell, but I liked having him trying to convince me that I wanted them.  Anyway, it was kind of a really late lunch/early dinner - probably around 4pm. \u00a0We walked right in and were seated immediately. \u00a0I like the interior. \u00a0It's kind of dark, has some low ceilings. \u00a0Very intimate seating. \u00a0And the servers are all very uniform. \u00a0They all wear black. \u00a0The men have hardly any facial hair (or any hair for that matter). \u00a0The women all had their hair pulled back with absolutely no hair in their face. \u00a0And if their hair was even longer, they had to put multiple hair rubberbands down the length of their hair to make it look \"neater.\" \u00a0  So we ordered the grilled artichokes right as we were seated. \u00a0We also ordered some green tea and chili. \u00a0The chili came with some tortilla chips, which was a nice touch. \u00a0Our table was a little small for all the plates, cups, and teapots we had though. \u00a0The grilled artichokes were sooo good! \u00a0Very tasty. \u00a0A and I had seen a show on TV a couple of weeks ago where they were showing viewers how to grill artichokes. \u00a0That took the guy like 5 hours. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0There's no way I'm ever going to grill an artichoke so the one at Houston's was definitely worthwhile. \u00a0They give you 3 halves. \u00a0So we each had one and then split the last one.  For our entrees, A had the halibut sandwich (which was one of the specials of the day) and I had the chicken sandwich (which A tells me he heard was one of the best things on the menu). \u00a0The chicken sandwich was HUGE and I only ate half of it and couldn't eat another bite. \u00a0It comes with shoestring potato fries. \u00a0Yum. \u00a0A had half of my chicken sandwich and half of his halibut sandwich. \u00a0I took the other half of his halibut sandwich to go and I just ate it today, two days later. \u00a0It was still really good, so I could only imagine how good it tasted when it was freshly made.  I'd go back to Houston's to try their full-out dinner. \u00a0I hear they make a mean steak!",

Even though there are countless other places to try in SF, we keep coming back to Houston's ever so often because food and service is consistently excellent.  A big plus is that they welcome bringing in your own wine by not charging a corkage fee. Also there is plenty of street parking.

We're going to live on! We're going to survive! Today we celebrate our Independence Day!\"  A food experience so epic deserved the most epic monologue a 1996 blockbuster could provide.

I had the chicken hacked salad - really good, but I saw that there was dark meat. Just wasn't used to that, but the salad was good overall.   BF had the cheeseburger, which I was drooling over. I loved the fries he had. They're small and remind me of those potato chip \"sticks,\" but I like it when fries are small and crispy. I added some to my salad =)   Service was great - our server was so nice and prompt. Even other servers acknowledge you to let you know that someone'll be coming by shortly. The ambiance reminded me of Chicago for some reason.   Would come here again but not on a frequent basis. On the pricier side, especially considering these days, and my low standards.

Love the fancy, loungy atmosphere and the live cello/oboe performance. \u00a0Love the classy ambiance. But Hillstone is very down-to-earth establishment. I feel casual and classy here at the same time. It's my go-to place for a simple, tasty meal.  Reservation was done through OpenTable but upon arrival, we were informed that their system was down. The hostess wrote down my name and reassured that we would be seated promptly, even before the stipulated 7PM.   Hillstone service is a choreography. No sooner did we sit down at the booth were we greeted by server (who wasn't our server) for drinks order. Then server came to tell us the specials and took own food order. Smooth and efficient.  *Hillstone Cheeseburger ($19): is one of the best burgers in town. Served in a fluffy homemade brioche bun is a juicy beef patty cooked medium. The cheddar cheese is melted such that it's completely glazed over the patty. Served with cole slaw or shoe string fries.  *Thai Steak &amp; Noodle Salad ($23): always my favorite. I honestly cannot finish the entire Filet Mignon plate and I don't care for mashed potato so I always get this salad instead. They are very generous with the filet mignon, also cooked medium rare. Big clumps of meat tossed with avocado, basil leaves, tomatoes, Thai noodle and crushed peanut. The only downside is that they don't make it spicy like in Bangkok.  Moscow Mule ($11) is a welcoming bubbly drink with a touch of lemon. The Fiddlehead Pinot Noir (Santa Rita, $14/glass) has a velvety blackcurrant finish. Great drinks to accompany the meal.  Another excellent tasty meal.",

    "review_text": "While a vegan obviously couldn't expect much from a steakhouse chain restaurant, my meal at Houston's San Francisco location was the most ridiculous of my life.  First, you may ask why I was there in the first place. Well, my girlfriend's mother was visiting from Texas and refused to eat at restaurants that do not serve meat, so my girlfriend did some research and discovered that Houston's had a vegan veggie burger. We called in and confirmed that yes, the veggie burger is vegan.  Upon arriving at the restaurant, my girlfriend and I again asked the hostess what we could eat on the menu. She pointed to the roasted vegetable platter, grilled artichokes, and the veggie burger, when ordered without cheese or butter. None of these options are anything to get excited about, but we were satisfied to see that we certainly would not be going hungry.  After ordering, the waitress returned to the table to tell us that the burger's bun is in fact NOT vegan and contains eggs. She said that all their bread is house-baked except for Oroweat wheat bread, which was also not vegan. While this was bad news, we were happy that she came to us with the information and ordered the bare patty with a baked potato as a replacement for the bun.  Only a bit later, I excused myself to the restroom. On the way back, I noticed a bread basket by the kitchen with an entire loaf of Acme Bread Company 'herb slab,' which I know for a fact is vegan. However, the waitress had said that all bread was baked in-house, so I asked her in order to be sure, \"Where is this bread baked?\"  As I had thought, it was from Acme. \"Can we please have our burgers on that bread?\" I asked.   The logical answer would be yes - and the waitress seemed to know this - but she said \"No, we can't make sandwiches on that bread.\"  Why?  She replied, \"I asked the manager and she said it is not for sandwiches. But we can bring you some of it sliced.\"  I returned to the table defeated, and our food arrived shortly along with a plate of sliced Acme bread. We decided that this was too ridiculous and needed to talk to the manager about this non-sandwich bread policy. She arrived shortly.  The exchange lasted nearly 10 minutes. All we wanted was a simple bread replacement, but she acted like we were asking for them to create an entire new dish. \"We have chips on the menu and we have cheese on the menu, but we can't make nachos just because someone wants them,\" she argued.  All we wanted was bread sliced horizontally in sandwich form. But since it was not \"tested and approved by the company's lead chefs\" they could not serve it. Even thought it was one of the only things we could eat on the menu.  \"What if we served you the burger on that bread, but then you didn't like it? You wouldn't be happy, right?\" she asked.  I responded, \"I am not happy NOW because you are here explaining why I can't have this bread instead of just giving it to me. And isn't that what the restaurant business is all about - taking risks to satisfy the customer? Not everyone is going to like everything that you serve!\"  She eventually relented and said she would bring us some bread. Five minutes later, we received more bread - but SLICED just as before! Remember, I saw a whole loaf in the basket, so this was as if the manager intentionally sliced it the wrong way out of spite.  In a surprise move, they did not charge us for the veggie burgers. But it's not like we would have paid for them anyway, so the gesture was insignificant.  The manager should be fired for speaking to customers in such a way. I have never been to a restaurant where I have been treated with such disdain. Houston's is an expensive place and I am baffled that they have a policy that dictates that managers cannot alter dishes to please customers. Seriously?!",

I've always loved the environment at Houston's but I don't like that fact that it's so dim there. I can't see my food. NE-wayz, we ordered the spinach dip for appetizer and she got the Hawaiian Rib Eye Steak and I got the Prime Rib.   The spinach dip was good, it came out hot and the chips was crunchy and not salty. When our entrees came out, I was kind of stuffed by gobbling down the spinach dip. My sister loved her Hawaiian Rib Eye Steak because she said they made it just right. I liked my Prime Rib but I liked it at House of Prime better. I should've ordered something else other than Prime Rib. Oh wells.   The server guy was nice. I had on a chip and orange juice run all night. I felt bad so I gave him a good tip for all the hassle.   If you never been to Houston's, it a cool place to take your date. The food is good but I would recommend the spinach dip and the Hawaiian Rib Eye Steak. The light is dim so it gives it a nice romantic feel. Also they have a fire place outside.",

He made a reservation through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&amp;s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">opentable.com</a>, and we got seated right away.  It was intimate and noisy at the same time. I really enjoyed the noise level, because it was perfect for having a conversation and not having to use an indoor voice.  For starters, we got the home smoked Salmon that was recommended by one of my bf's coworkers who said it was so good that it would make girls do...unmentionables. I don't really know if it was THAT good, but it was definitely delicious. It was baked, but not completely, so the texture was super tender. Came with tarter sauce and bread. Yum.  For entrees, I had the special which was the Lame Shank and my boyfriend had the Prime Rib which apparently is one of their top dishes. Super large portions, good flavor, and actually cooked the way we asked them to be cooked. Service was really attentive and friendly.  One disappointment: My boyfriend reserved at a time where he knew they were going to lit the fireplace, but apparently in order to sit near there you have to specify or have a big group? We were a bit disappointed because those tables were near the music and the window which was featuring a beautiful SF sunset while we had to strain to have a change to glance at it.   My boyfriend was a little more disappointed than I was I think. He said it was a bit like Applebee's turned fine dining because this restaurant is a chain. Overall, great restaurant, but I don't know if I would necessarily come back because of all the other choices for finer dining.",

    "review_text": "Growing up in Georgia, I knew Houston's--the nice restaurant across the street from my high school that my parents took me to when I got a good report card. The cheesy bread was divine and the French fries in a league of their own.   Then I discovered in other parts of the country the same restaurant was branded \"Hillstone.\" I've eaten at the one in Boston and the one in New York, and was passing by this location and started bragging to my friend about their veggie burgers. Coincidently it was lunch time, and 10 minutes later we were seated at one of their white tablecloth tables near a window.  SETTING: Like other Houston's/Hillstone's, interior is classy and a little bit on the darker side with richer wood and red tones. White tableclothes for both lunch and dinner.  FOOD: Famous for the veggie burger (one that is probably not healthy), Houston's also has great Spinach and Artichoke dip and salads. Back in my non-veg days I ordered the Hickory Burger. Unfortunately, the cheesy bread has been off the menu for nearly 10 years.  SERVICE: The service at Houston's/Hillstone is good on the whole. But the fifth star here is for today's service. When we ordered our food, I mentioned non-chalantly that we were going to split our dishes. The burger then came split into two pieces and they brought an extra plate with no further request from us.  It's the small things folks, it's the small things.",

I made a reservation weeks in advance as my bf and I planned to have a nice dinner date. Highly recommend to make a reservation because the Saturday night we came, it was packed! Not just speaking about the dining tables, but the bar area too (Giants vs Royals World Series)!   Parking is hard to find on the main street of Embarcardero &amp; Montgomery. When my bf &amp; I arrived around 7 pm, there was plenty of parking behind the restaurant where the apartments or office buildings are (turn on your nearest right in front the restaurant and \"circle\" the block).   The restaurant is dimly lit with a causal/romantic ambiance. The Houston restaurant that I went to in NOLA had a sign by their waiting area that said no sandals, shorts, hats, etc. because it was a semi-formal restaurant. I thought that was the case here too, but this place seems more casual and I felt over dressed.. but its kewl, it's nice to dress up time to time! The dining tables consisted of 2-4 seating by the walls/windows and the tables in the middle of the restaurant were mainly booths. They also have an open kitchen by the side of the entrance. I loved where we were seated because it by the wall/window and there was great lighting for taking pictures of our food (yes, I'm one of those Asians..)! The light was shining just above the center of our table. Look at my food pics and you'll know what I mean! ;)   The menu (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hillstone.com%2Fpdf_menus%2Fhillstone%2FHillstone_Embarcadero.pdf&amp;s=3d87e4b9ab9a5a059c105e81d9b9405a3811f63f86e9a14437d1a90e7fde3dac\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">hillstone.com/pdf_menus/\u2026</a>) has five categories: Starters, salads, burgers &amp; sandwiches, house specialties, and side dishes. They also have a good selection of wine - Sparkling &amp; Champagne, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Rose &amp; White wine, Cabernet Sauvignon &amp; Cabernet blends, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel, and more red wine! You can order them by the glass or bottle. For glass, they range between $10-18, and bottles range from $28-120. According to other yelpers, they don't have a corkage fee, so bring your own bottle if you must!  *Remember not to drink &amp; drive! If you need a DD, the restaurant can call a cab for you :)   Our waiter was Greg, was great! He was attentive and gave us time to finish our 2 appetizers before placing our entree orders. Side note: Don't order 2 appetizers if it's 2 people eating.. cause it started to fill our stomach!   FOOD!  Appetizers:  Spinach &amp; artichoke dip ($14): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hillstone-san-francisco?select=e_8YQ4rtpY57lIOQej5GYQ#e_8YQ4rtpY57lIOQej5GYQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hill\u2026</a> Honestly, I would've never thought about trying this but because my cousin recommended it when we went to Houstons, I fell in love! This consists of tortilla chips and 3 dips - spinach &amp; artichoke, salsa, and sour cream. My favorite is the spinach &amp; artichoke - it has a warm taste to it and it is just delish! A must try!  House-Smoked Salmon ($17): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hillstone-san-francisco?select=e_8YQ4rtpY57lIOQej5GYQ#zkpYDM5aRjwvTCVWqVCcUw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hill\u2026</a> My boyfriend loved this dish and it is one of my favorites too! This dish has smoked-salmon, toasts, and the Chef's dressing. What I do is grab a toast, cut bits of salmon onto it (not wholes cause it'll be complicated to eat when you bite into it), and slab a bit of dressing on top. The best thing about this dish is the salmon itself. It has a unique and tasty flavor to it, and just makes the dish stand out. According to my bf, this is what he said, \"If I could, I would order 3 plates of this just for the salmon!\" Shows how good it is ;) and he also said, he would come back just for this! Highly recommended.   Entrees:  Roasted Prime Rib with Baked Potato ($37): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hillstone-san-francisco?select=e_8YQ4rtpY57lIOQej5GYQ#qPqj_RH2EPgWE7mYqjLBYA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hill\u2026</a> If you are not a steak person, like my bf, you shouldn't order this. He wanted to give it a try but did not really enjoy it because it was so 'rare' in the middle and didn't expect that out of a prime rib.. tsk tsk. I tried a piece and I thought it was good, but there wasn't anything that stood out to me. They also have a fully b  Hawaiian rib-eye ($36) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hillstone-san-francisco?select=e_8YQ4rtpY57lIOQej5GYQ#dLXswpZGM9eTJtv3YExeag\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hill\u2026</a> One the best rib-eyes ever! It is to die for! The rib-eye looks like a 10-12 oz. It has pineapple soy ginger marinade, with hand-cut French fries and everything about it just yummy. When you first bite into it, you can taste the juicy pineapple soy ginger marinade, and just feels like it melts in your mouth... I highly recommend this dish! Their fries are also good, as they are hand-cut and not from your typical frozen food fries. My bf tried a piece of mine and wished he ordered this!   Because we had 2 appetizers, we were too full and not able to finish our entrees..sad face. Don't be like us!! Everything was great &amp; I'd definitely love to come back again!",

All of the food tasted good, but was nothing special. I felt like I could have eaten at Boudin's and felt the same way about lunch.   Honestly, it isn't the price that turns me off (I didn't even see the bill), but if someone wanted to take me out to Hillstone for lunch again, I'd probably suggest somewhere else.   Maybe I ordered the wrong things? I don't know. Everyone else's food looked fairly mediocre as well. I wouldn't mind drinking wine and sitting outside on a sunny day though.

I have been craving for that juicy, tender, mouth-watering steak so I visited this place during our big day.  Parking was a little bit hard to find(it's SF) but we were so lucky to be able to find a spot right in the front of it.  Hillstone to me is a mix of fine dining and a steakhouse. It's dark and upscaled but at the same time it's loud. It was a full house on Saturday night and everybody talked so loud as if you were in a bar.  We ordered spinach &amp; artichoke dip as an appetizer which is highly recommended. They offered to refill our chips for free which was nice.  They have a full bar but they do not have a cocktail menu, so I ordered a cosmo, It was good but nothing to brag about.  I ordered the rib eye(the one with the bone) because that's what I came there for and my gf ordered the Hawaiian Rib Eye.  Our rib eye came and let me just say that the rib eye met my expectation if not more. All the flavor, the tenderness, the juicyness that I have been craving came on that first bite. It was that damn good!!! Suddenly, there was no conversation between me and my gf. We were too busy enjoying our own rib eyes.  We couldn't finish the whole thing because it was so big. We had to bring it home. Even a few days late, I microwave the leftover and it was still good.  Price was reasonable for special events dinner, not every weekend though or I will go broke. They had live jazz too which was cool.",

I asked the server to provide me raw horseradish and it was actually sweeter than the creamed horseradish that came with my entree. \u00a0The baked potato was nothing special but it was a bit on the dry side.   Hawaiian Ribeye ($36): very tender but too sweet for a Ribeye. \u00a0My date liked the sweetness, \u00a0he wanted something different. \u00a0The winter vegetables were OK, I was not impressed. I think there was potatoes and spaghetti squash...   Apple Cobbler ($8): More like WALNUT COBBLER!! Totally not what I was expecting. \u00a0The supposedly apple cobbler was actually walnut cobbler!

I felt myself getting healthier with every bite.  My BF had the French dip again. He described it as: larger than average and the beef was delicious, but there was some mayonnaise secret sauce on it that wasn't mentioned on the menu. Sauce makes him angry. Literally. BUT he said that dipping it in the au jus kinda rinsed the sauce off and he could deal with it.  Since my meal was perfect, I'm only taking off one star for his input. The service was still super-speedy, but I guess that's part of the deal when you eat there...empty plates are cleared immediately so it's a good idea to keep pace with your friends.

(...spoken with Borat's sense of comedy timing)  Yes, yes, I know it's a chain....do you think my epicurean pride would prevent me from chewing like an obsessive carnivore incautious about \"mad cow\" disease?...\"HA!\", I say as I pick my teeth for residue meat.  My friend and I were lucky for a Saturday evening. Immediate seating. A nice-sized booth. A truly service-oriented waitress amid the heavy foot traffic. The spirits of Borden's Elsie the Cow and Stuart Andersen's Black Angus steer must have been smiling on us. Taking no prisoners, I went for the $28 Roasted Prime Rib on the Bone. Extravagant, I know...but I just salivated at the thought of a juicy thick slab of beef with a big baked potato.  When it came, I may have clapped my hands like Ross the Intern did when he met Christina Aguilera for the first time. It was a huge cut, medium rare and pink with a crusty edge to it...not Christina, the meat. It came with a bowl of warm au jus and a ramekin of creamy horseradish sauce. The potato had the works - sour cream, crispy bacon bits, chopped scallions and butter. My one disappointment was that the potato was a tad lukewarm with the ingredients not nearly as melty-melt as I wanted them to be. Does anyone make twice-baked potatoes anymore?  I actually think the service is great here. Water glasses were filled quickly, and refreshers on beverages came responsively. My friend's fervent desire for a fish sandwich - not on the menu - was met with enthusiasm as he was served a special one with the catch of the day and a pile of fries. Dessert was not an option, at least until we pretended to exercise by walking to North Beach for gelato. The place is awfully dark. The search for the restroom in the back became a spelunker's adventure. And the bar next to us was loud and raucous with semi-drunken regulars staring dead-eyed at our meals.  **Please note that since I wrote the above review, Houston's has changed its name to Hillstone.  FOOD - 4 stars...stellar prime rib balanced by a lukewarm potato AMBIANCE - 4 stars...Papa, can you see me?...Papa, can you hear me? SERVICE - 5 stars...really prompt and friendly TOTAL - 4 stars...gimme the meat....GIMME THE MEAT!",

So many people and fellow yelpers convinced me that this was the place to have a good cut of meat, namely a great prime rib. Finally Hillstone, your number was called and when you stepped up to the plate you did come swinging but dribbled a grounder to short.  That pretty much sums it up in terms of the prime rib. It was a good mighty serving. However, it lacked taste and I'm not so sure it was the best quality meat. It came with a loaded baked potato and that was awesome but what does that say about the prime rib when I rave about the potato?   We had two appetizers...the smoked salmon and the roasted artichokes. Both were delicious and items I would have again. I know artichokes are plain and simple but too many places mess it up. Here it was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. The smoked salmon was my favorite. It was served with a tartar sauce on a crunchy toast. My wife had the bass and I'm not sure that was bass. It didn't look like bass and it certainly didn't taste like it. It was served with Brussel sprouts and almonds and when you took a bite with the almonds it was good. But I'm still not convinced it was bass. The bass is called the Loup De Mer and should just be advertised as Bronzini. To me it looked and tasted more like a slightly bigger trout. I feel Bronzini itself is completely different from the American expectation of sea bass.  My buddy had the blackened ribeye and that was tasty. I'm not sure I like the preparation though. I'm not sure that something blackened the way it was should be pre sliced. They tried to give it the seared ahi effect and I'm on the fence about it. The dessert was a walnut Apple cobbler. That was delicious and a good close to the meal. It was well balanced in taste and was generously served with walnuts.  Their wine list was decent. Lots of local offerings and I appreciate that when I'm here in my favorite city. I feel we should serve the best of local. We had a bottle of the Sangiovese and it was good. My only beef was that it was advertised as a 2010 and they gave us a 2012. We also had a bottle of the Malbec and it was probably one of the best I've had.  The waitress was friendly, attentive, and even shared a story to our table. They still have the old Houstons sign up inside. Why?  It was dark there and a little too dark for dining comfort. \u00a0  Overall it wasn't a bad meal. It just didn't meet expectations. I mean HOPR is still where anyone should have prime rib. I would rank 5A5 ahead of this in terms of steakhouses. But I also wouldn't mind going back. It just wouldn't be my first choice.",

On Saturday my wife and I headed out to get some brunch in the City before furniture shopping. Originally, we had set out to go to the Wild Hare to get an omelet but the wait was over 90 minutes, so we decided to give Hillstone a try since I saw a Spinach and Cheese Omelet on their menu.   We arrived and got \"rock star\" parking the 1st space #28 in front of the restaurant. After being seated and looking at the menu. We asked if they could change some of the ingredients of the Omelet in instead of the cheese. The server \" insisted \" that they could only leave out the cheese and nothing else could be substituted. So we had no choice but to order the \"Spinach Omelet\" along with the Thai Beef Salad, and a Hickory Burger.  Before the food came the server brought two plates with silverware. After picking up the plate I felt some left over stuck on the bottom of the plate so I checked the bottom of the other one. Both had food stuck on the bottom. \"Yuck\". I pointed this out to a server walking by and without a word they just exchanged the plates. humm....   The Thai Beef Salad was good except for the beef. The meat was so so salty and must have sat in the soy marinade for days. 2 stars.  The Spinach Omelet \u00a0no cheese was plain and none descript. 2 stars.   The Hickory Burger was good 4 stars.   Asked for the check, normally I only glace at the check but this time I found that they charged us for two coffees but we only had one. The server took it off.

I look forward to heading back to Hillstone, it really was a perfect spot to relax after fighting tourists throughout the morning!",

Anyways they said there's nothing they could do. We waited another 15 min and at 9:45 we got to sit.

We came here in the late afternoon, which wasn't busy. It was fairly quiet which was nice. It does look very nice on the inside. But right away we felt we were out of place. We just didn't get that good or comfortable vibe.  They have a very small menu. And for what they offer, the prices are a little on the high side. $17 for a Caesar salad with chicken added. The Caesar dressing was eggless, so it was a clear thin consistency. Very disappointed with this. I love a good Caesar dressing, and this wasn't it. The rest of the menu items didn't appeal to us and was just to high for a simple lunch. That's why we stuck to our salads.   This restaurant just wasn't for us. The service was average. Nothing spectacular.  Personally, I can't recommend this restaurant, even if it's for a special date night.  Sorry Hillstone. We wanted to like you. Just not a great first impression.",

The kale salad is nice, light and filling but do go for the filet mignon if you're indeed having a power lunch.  Dinner there is a lot less casual than lunch with the sound of soft live jazz in back of the room and the best perk, NO CORKAGE FEE, like ever.

It was forgettable but definitely a fancy west coast steakhouse feel. The view of the pier and the crowds was nice.  Fiancee wanted to know about the crab cakes which come with two sides. You only get two cakes and they are about average size so he asked how much would it be to add two more. The answer was that he would have to pay the entire price of the plate. What? But it's just the crab cakes, not the side dishes as well so he changed his order to something else.   We ordered two diet cokes and the rosemary foccacia and olives first. The focaccia and olives were great although since the dish was so salty we quickly ran through our first round of cokes. We then discovered that there are no free refills; their soda comes from a glass bottle brought to the table. \u00a0The bottles are only 8 ozs and so is smaller than even an ordinary can. We were also offered no water at the table until we asked ourselves. Our very kind waiter waived our second round of cokes from the bill.   I ordered the Veggie burger that came with fries. SO had BBQ Pork Ribs. He was very disappointed in the ribs. The ribs were neither hot nor cold. I would say, tepid. They had a strange aftertaste, too. The creamy coleslaw that came with them was very lovely. I should have ordered that! The fries were nice as well; they were thin and crispy and properly salted. I tried the dipping sauce with Siracha in it but didn't like it.  The Veggie burger was quite large. I couldn't finish it, although it was very hard to eat. The patty was comprised of vegetables (of course) and lentils but it fell apart very quickly. I suspect it only held together so long due to the large piece of cheese melted on top. It came with the usual trimmings. After awhile of me trying to keep my burger together long enough to eat it, it got kind of soggy and gross so I gave up on it. I did eat about 75% of it maybe. \u00a0It tasted fine but wasn't very memorable except for how hard it was to eat it.   It was a bit too early for us to eat dessert so we didn't try anything.  Also, as for price I was unhappy with it. I have no problem paying good money for good food but this place was a crap shoot.   Our waiter was great. He, as mentioned above, waived our second round of cokes, and kept up with SO's odd humor. He also was pretty knowledgeable about the menu.  If we're in town, we probably won't come back.",

I had the roasted prime rib with baked potato. The plate was covered with a HUGE slab of meat that was perfectly cooked. Juicy and succulent. Wow, I never ever had meat so good. The baked potato enveloped a huge serving of butter, bacon bits, cheese, green onions, and sour cream. \u00a0It was a heart attack waiting to happen but I didn't care. I tried my coworker's barbecue pork ribs...just fell off the bone...DELICIOUS!  I thoroughly enjoyed my gimlet cocktail with mint and cucumber...refreshing! We finished the lunch with the harvest cheesecake and fudge sundae. I think the cheesecake was suppose to be pumpkin flavored but all I could taste was the orange zest (or something citrusy)...a bit disappointing.

Either way, we actually arrived an hour later than our reservation and didn't mention that we made one.  Their setting was nice. Dim lighting, candle light, and interesting lights. It was a very nice interior design.  Our waitress was extremely nice and enthusiastic. She just had an aura of happiness around her. (I think her name was Nicole Anne.) So, good job on service! She was very excited that it was my birthday celebration! (:  I went for the Rib-Eye steak while my boyfriend went for the a salmon dish. It didn't take them long to take it out. It was delicious! When I order steak, I'm always worried that they will over cook it or under cook it. They did a good job cooking at medium rare.   My boyfriend also ordered a brownie a la mode, and it is delicious. Just order it regardless of occasion. It's delicious. The brownie just melts in your mouth ....   Overall, great experience and great food. Wonderful services! And the place just looks amazing!",

We had some sort of cheese bread appetizer which was fine, just a way to sate our appetites and then had the crab cakes, ribs and steak. \u00a0The crab cakes were amazing!!! It was all crab meat, no fillers of any kind, just chunks of amazingness. \u00a0The ribs were to die for, next time that's what I will be ordering and the steak was great too. \u00a0I have to say the fries were just OK and probably worth substituting, they just lacked the crunch and golden tone. \u00a0  We didn't make it to dessert because we were full. \u00a0I think this is a great place to go to with friends, a date or just sit at the bar and have a meal.   It was a bit noisy but I just expect that when a place is full of happy, satisfied customers.",

    "review_text": "First time here this past weekend and it certainly won't be my last. We were staying at the Hyaytt Embarcadero so through a recommendation, we decided to check this place out. We were certainly not disappointed. I liked that this restaurant was casual but yet classy at the same time with an open kitchen area which I can always appreciate. We were lucky to find a place to sit in the bar area at a table next to the bar (far right side at you are facing the door to the front entrance of the restaurant). Excellent bar seating location to have an intimate dinner. Our server was Allison, she was wonderful! The other servers that also assisted us in the bar area were also very helpful. The complimentary live jazz music was a nice touch.   OK, now to the food. We ordered the following: Nice little house salad, 14 oz. roasted prime rib (end-cut/medium) w/ a large baked potato, flying tuna platter that came along with a amazing mixed greens that included: avocado, mango, and a light but perfect vinaigrette, and last but certainly not least, a five nut brownie with french vanilla ice-cream which came sprinkled with what tasted like espresso shavings? Everything we ordered was simply perfect!   One note, this place was busy throughout the entire evening which is another sign of a good restaurant but I can imagine that getting a reservation may be tough, especially during the evening on a weekend but if you can get seat in the bar area, you are set. The location was ideal, service and food was excellent, and the prices were very reasonable for what you may be paying for at a restaurant along The Embarcadero. I can't wait to go back to Hillstone! One more thing, no corkage fee. Score! We were able to enjoy a Sonoma Viansa Winery 2011 Primitivo that went along perfectly with our dinner. Did I mention, I can't wait to go back to this restaurant??? lol",

    "review_text": "Hillstone is in a great location has a nice bar and a real cozy feel to it. I would give it the highest rating if the prices were more reasonable. \u00a0I am probably in the minority but, to my mind, the restaurant is unnecessarily expensive.   The Bar  The bartenders are pleasant and observant and the wine list exhaustive; however, there is no happy hour and the cheapest wine that I could find was $9.00 a glass. Listen, there are many Bay Area restaurants and most of us appreciate finding a good deal: you will not find any here. Maybe I am cheap but come on now, can't you include a $7 a glass wine or two on the bar menu? \u00a0Two glasses of Alois Lageder Pinot Grigio was $22.13 after tax which is just plain ridiculous for average white wine.  Dinner  Our server, Brian, was terrific. He was really attentive, had a great sense of humor and great recommendations. \u00a0His helpers were not so attentive, especially when they bought four plates of food simultaneously and I was only half way through my salad. This made for a very crowded table. \u00a0  I would recommend the \"Nice Little House Salad.\" It was exceptional and a real bargain at $8.00. Unfortunately, this is the only bargain on the menu. \u00a0The cheeseburger was excellent as were the pork ribs and salmon. There is no arguing the quality of the food. They have well above average food, but $31 for ribs and $29 for salmon is ridiculous. We asked for bread and were told \"there is bread on the menu,\" which is \"restaurant speak\" for we have no free bread. Again, come on now, would it hurt to provide some bread, a few olives and oil free of charge? For desert the \"Warm Five-Nut Brownie\" \u00a0is a bargain at $8.00 as is the Apple Walnut Cobbler so at least the evening ended on a sweet note.   In sum, Hillstone is billed as a unique collection of upscale boutique restaurants. I cannot argue with that. I can tell you that they are overpriced by about $5.00 per entr\u00e9e which is entirely too much considering the fact that the restaurant is situated near restaurants having food of similar quality that are substantially cheaper. I go to Hillstone once a year to satisfy one of the people in out \"restaurant hopping group.\" Frankly, I would never select this restaurant. I left full but I felt I had been cheated.",

Smoked salmon appetizer is the fish pick. It's like salmon butter, it just melts in your mouth.  The prime rib is excellent, it is a nice sized portion and it has always been cooked perfectly each time I have ordered it.  The filet has been well cooked two out of the three times I have tried it. On one occasion it was charred on the outside and raw on the inside, but besides that experience; it is solid.  The Hawaiian ribeye just does not agree with my taste buds. \u00a0Maybe I am old fashioned but there is no reason in my world to make a steak sweet.  The pastrami sandwich is just a disappointment, fatty and not too much flavor to me.  The sides  The only complaint about the wilted spinach is that they do not give you enough of it. Nice texture with a pleasant yet not overbearing saltiness from the parmesan cheese: its wilted bliss. The mashed potatoes are excellent, using the green onion to give it texture and a nice taste is simply genius. The French fries are nothing to write home about. As you can see by the many times I have been there I recommend this restaurant to anyone, it has a nice atmosphere and excellent staff. Combine that with the consistent food and it is a great pick for any night out.  The fish has spoken.",

The tables are set up for good noise reduction. The kitchen is exposed, giving more of a homey feel.  The food is delicious and worth the drive into the city JUST for the hot spinach and artichoke dip.   I know it's a chain restaurant and this fact alone might turn many people off.

    "review_text": "Hillstone has terrific service at each location I've been to. While I enjoyed my experience at this location, I've also been to the Midtown East location in NYC, and quality was the same there. This brings up a good point - Hillstone is definitely a chain, yet they make it feel like a bit more of a local experience in each of their locations. Service is capable without being overwhelming.  To eat we had:  Oak Grilled Artichokes - These were simple yet a nice way to start. I didn't dip mine in the remoulade, as I don't prefer very creamy sauces/dips, but the artichoke itself was nice. It was a fun change to get a whole artichoke, rather than a puny piece of one. Note that if you don't dip it in the remoulade, ask for a lemon to give the artichoke itself a bit more flavor. $14 was a bit steep for three artichokes, though not outrageous.  House-Made Veggie Burger - My boyfriend and I both got this and loved it! Again, this I've had in both locations, and each time it was fantastic! They are gigantic. I get mine with no cheese (again, try to avoid a fair amount of dairy), but the sweet soy glaze adds a nice flavor profile to the dish. Each bite has a punch of flavor - this was quite zesty with the perfect sweet and saltier mix. The burger itself is made with beets and some type of grain and I believe prunes - fabulous texture. This is no wimpy box-like veggie burger, but a truly unique burger that you can tell they put thought into designing. I eat it without the bun, as it's still massive and filling this way. Next time I may ask to get it wrapped in lettuce to make it a bit easier to eat, but I used a knife and fork. It may also be good to split it into two right when you get it and bring the other half home for lunch the next day. As the flavors sit, it may taste even better!  As a side, you have a choice between tabbouleh, hand cut fries or coleslaw - I went with the tabbouleh. While it wasn't anything you'd find at a more traditional Lebanese restaurant, it was refreshing with a nice m\u00e9lange of vegetables and grain. The ratio between the two was nice - however, be warned that this is also a generous serving (save some room for dessert)!  Dessert - This isn't listed on the menu, but they keep it simple with two dessert options, an ice cream sundae and a brownie sundae. We went with the brownie sundae - not a huge brownie but a very good size to share between two or three people. The full top of the brownie is studded with walnuts and a delicious chocolate sauce. It really feels decadent and chocolatey - and I'm a huge chocolate fan, so I loved this! It was topped with a classic scoop of vanilla, which is always a nice mix with the dense chocolate flavors.  Overall, a fantastic meal! Worth it to make a reservation, as it can get a bit crowded. Nice outdoor seating area as well if the weather is good.",

My typical meal here is the grilled artichoke, the artichoke dip ( which is one of the best I've ever had), and the filet. Surprisingly, they do their steak much better than a lot of fancier places out there. In fact, its phenomenol! Its tender , favorful, and always cooked to perfection.   The fries are also wonderful, and yes its true, if you stand near the kitchen, the cooks will just give you a plate of them. The service is always good and you can get a table relatively fast without reservations. On a nice day, they have outdoor seating, its nice to be able to sit out side and soak up the sun.  I spend so much time trying to hit all the hot spots and try all the other resturaunts that I always forget that Houston's is there for me.

For me a city like San Francisco has such higher standards for restaurants that this place was a total disappointment to what else is out there in the city.  My complains:  1) Our bread came without anything (butter, olive oil, etc) and the waitstaff had to be asked to bring it to us. 2) My waitress didn't know the price of the specials 3) My friend asked for coleslaw on his baked potato instead of sour cream, butter, etc and the waitress said she could probably do that (he is English). Then she went and talked to the kitchen and they said they had to charge him for a full side order. In my opinion when you make an offer to a patron it should stick; the restaurant needs to eat that cost. 4) The fillet minion came out cold and had to be sent back. When it was sent back the manager dropped off the replacement steak with a pissed off attitude. IT WAS STILL JUST WARM! Sent it back again and this third steak was still just warm!  On top of all of these problems, and clear fact that \u00a0the waitress knew we were unhappy, there was NO apology nor adjustment to our bill.  This is not the way to encourage repeat business. This restuarant is obviously not service oriented, but rather run like a typical fast-food chain in trying to increase turnover and keep filling tables with tourists.  I will NOT be back again.  UPDATE: I did also fax a letter to Houston's general manager and they got back to me pretty quickly with an apology and asked me for the chance to prove themselves again. I went in, had a much better experience but I still felt rushed.   It was a bit odd that the waiter brought out the check as he brought desert. I told him to take it back until we are done eating, but what else could I expect? They stil have some work to do in my opinion at getting service staff trained to the point of providing the right service for the dollar.",

    "review_text": "Sometimes I wake up and the first thing that pops into my mind is a little voice that says, \"Treat Yo' Self!\" Well, one day I woke up to a crack of sunlight hitting my face and that little voice telling me to do something special. So I did. I Yelped for the top steakhouses in San Francisco and got a reservation for two at Hillstone...or is it Houston's? I'll discuss that later.   *Sidenote* A trend I have noticed amoung restaurants is that it seems that the nicer and more expensive a restaurant is, the small and shorter their menu becomes. Compare the novella that is an IHOP or Cheesecake Factory menu to Hillstone's and it feels like you're reading off a cocktail napkin. That being said, simpler menus do allow the chefs to specialize and do those select dishes very well versus the general \"meh\"ness expected of your neighborhood 24 Hour Pancake House. *End Sidenote*  In the spirit of \"Treat Yo' Self\", I decided to splurge during my July 4th dinner date by ordering the Emerald Kale Salad and the Hawaiian Ribeye. The kale salad was easily one of the best I have enjoyed. The kale was crisp and not waxy and shredded finely enough that it was easy to eat and not at all tough. The peanut dressing was also very nice. The small chunks of peanuts added a nice textural crunch which contrasted with the crisp and light kale. My boyfriend got the clam chowder with bacon and croutons, that night's featured soup, for an appetizer. He enjoyed it but it didn't blow his mind. When our main courses rolled out, I was greeted with a beautiful, dark mahogany, and grilled marked ribeye and the smell of soy, garlic, adn pineapple. My mouth immediately began to water and I dug in. FIrst and foremost, my steak came out exactly as I ordered - medium rare. It may seem odd to be happy about this, but I have been to restaurants costing upwards of $100 per person who still don't cook steaks properly to order. As for the dish, the steak was tender, supremely juicy and well rested, and the glaze, while salty, was simply addictive. I used the crisp, thin fries to sop up as much of the sauce as possible. My BF ordered the Flying Tuna Platter, which despite being kind of a misnomer (The Tuna obviously never sprouted wings and flew off his plate), was met positively. Definitely a lighter dish, seared cubes of tune are served with a nice salad with mango and massive whole tomatoes. We aren't talking cherry or grape tomatoes, but whole tomatoes bigger than golf balls. Odd.  While we were both quite full with our meals, the spirit of \"Treat Yo' Self\" urged us to at least give the dessert menu a peek...if there was one. The dessert menu, like the regular menu, is quite tiny. So small, in fact, that it does not even exist. Instead, your server will tell you the three or so available that night. Slightly disappointing honestly. Fortunately, this does provide a convenient segue into the service at Hillstone. Our server was definitely new and it showed. He did not check in on our table very often and food delivery was slow at times but when we was there, he did his best to tell us as much as he knew which is always appreciated, Moving on to the space, the restaurant does not look very impressive from the outside. It's low, semi hidden, and pretty anonymous. Inside, however, the space is quite warm and cozy feeling. Thanks to those low ceilings, the use of dark woods, and a live jazz band, I would venture to call it \"intimate\" but not quite \"romantic.\" It can become a litte loud as crowds and the wait area begin to grow and fill up. The only odd thing about the space is the red, lit-up \"Houston's\" sign above one of the doors, harkening back to the restaurant's old identity before it's rebranding. Curious they still had not removed it. Finally, we come to value. My salad, steak, and a drink rang up to about $70 after tax and tip. It's a pretty penny for sure, but it was overall a delicious meal.  If you're near Fisherman's Wharf and are looking for something a bit more intimate and away from the tourist bustle, call in a reservation and make the few block trek down Embarcadero to HIllstone. It isn't cheap, but you can avoid the crowds and enjoy some great food. Hey, go ahead and Treat Yo' Self. You deserve it.",

    "review_text": "Sadly, the food eclipses the service. One tip to management is to step up \"training\". We had a secured reservation for two tables=14 persons. We checked-in at 7:15pm for a 7:30pm reservation, only to finally avoid an altercation with diners that refused to leave their table after occupying the table for over 2 1/2 hours. Our party finally sat at 8:45pm. The diners refused to leave telling the manager that he spent $600 on dinner for his family of 8 persons and had the right to sit there all night if he chooses. He then threatened the restaurant manager as well as the waiting diners. Dear god...\"The Bridge &amp; Tunnel Crowd\" has arrived to the Bay Area. There is a way to handle these situations and the restaurant management was totally unprepared to handle thus situation. I noted that there was another party waiting in the bar and finally sat down almost 11/2 after their confirmed reservation time. It looks like an unacceptable trend here. I will avoid this restaurant in the future since management staff is very inexperienced in handling these situations. All &amp; all a bad ending to a holiday celebration with friends and family.",

My favorite part about this experience was that everyone from the managers, waiters/waitress, host/hostess, seats you, greet you, assist you, check on you.. this gives you a very warm feeling and plus it was game 5 of the NLCS championship series. My lady had prime rib and I had a burger.. I would give this a 5 star but the menu needs more variety for their pricing.. Seriously the wine list was way longer than the menu list..

However, I don't think it's a good idea to go out dining in a holiday weekend, because it felt like the real servers or maybe even the chef were taking a holiday off, too. Two out of three main entree were too salty. Service was not as good as usual. We 4 people were seated at a relatively small table while there are sill a lot of empty tables around. When we just started trying to taste the starters, all the entrees were already there. So foods were allover the small table and we couldn't \u00a0even move. And \"she\" keep asking if we were finished a plate or still working on it. It made me feel like they were trying to take off early while there were still new customers coming in... It embarrassed me badly because I was the one who suggested to go there.",

    "review_text": "Here is a secret. \u00a0Hillstone is one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. \u00a0Here's the confession. \u00a0I often forget about it. \u00a0In a city where chain and franchised restaurants are frowned upon, Hillstone is one of the rare exceptions that deserves a native's visit. \u00a0Previously Houston's, Hillstone is a great choice for almost any occasion. \u00a0Going on that first date? \u00a0Hillstone's atmosphere, dim lighting, and live music (jazz or piano) is great for a romantic first get to know ya. \u00a0Going on a power lunch? \u00a0Great for that as well. \u00a0Catching up with a friend and want to grab a drink? \u00a0The bar is solid too. \u00a0I've gone to HIllstone on numerous occasions for numerous events. \u00a0I've never had a bad meal there. \u00a0My personal favorites include the Prime Rib and loaded baked potato or the French Dip, which is amazing. \u00a0I usually kick a meal off with the spinach artichoke dip which I highly recommend. \u00a0But even when I've strayed from the regulars, I've always enjoyed my fare. \u00a0  Hillstone may be a franchise (they also own the Bandera restaurants as well as The Rutherford Grill in wine country) but it's worth a visit. \u00a0It really is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, even if I'm embarrassed to admit it sometimes because it's not unique to SF. \u00a0However, once I nestle down to eat, I tend not to care at all.  Oh, and free corkage. \u00a0A huge plus if you don't feel like splurging on their wine list. \u00a0The wait staff is always friendly. \u00a0Honestly, this place doesn't fail me on any level. \u00a0Definite 5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review_text": "I heard about this restaurant on \"Check Please\" local PBS food review show and wanted to give it a try. \u00a0I do not like/patron chain food restaurants but from the show it sounded like they understand that SF diners demand quality therefore they have to compete. \u00a0We gave them a try last night (Sat.).  At 6 p.m. we walked into a very busy scene. \u00a0We put our names in for a table and was told 35 min. or so. \u00a0and we went to the bar for a drink. \u00a0Almost all seats were taken at the bar so we had to sit at a tiny tiny high table top next to the window. \u00a0I wasn't sure if the bar staff would come over to ask for our order, but one of them did within 10 min. \u00a0We ordered 2 tap beers....very disappointing to get a 16 oz. stem beer glass with 12 oz. of IPA to pay 7.00 for that beer. \u00a0We know the mark-up is high...but for 3.00 more we could have bought the 6 pack. \u00a0Tip...don't blatantly rip off your drinking patrons.  We were taken to our table within 20 min. so that was very pleasing! \u00a0Nice table, the room layout is very elegant and w/ nice partisans (love booth seats...nice too when it is a two top booth). \u00a0  We ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer (heard it is the best!). \u00a0Oh my GOD! \u00a0It is the best artichoke I've ever had! \u00a01 1/2 pieces (would have enjoyed 2 artichokes split for 2 people...at 14.00 that would seem a more fair price). \u00a0Grilled to perfection w/ a lovely herb and salted exterior w/ nice charred flavor. \u00a0The dipping sauce....YUM!  The menu is a bit eclectic American fare food. \u00a0They omit the side items that come w/ the entrees on some things (like the Arctic Char which comes w/ herb mashed potatoes but it isn't stated in the listing). \u00a0My partner did not know his meal came with a carb so I ordered a side of fries mostly for him. \u00a0I really wanted some seafood but the only choices were shrimp or trout or Char which wasn't what I craved. \u00a0  I ended up choosing a Caesar salad to go w/ the fries. When the salad was delivered there was no offer of fresh ground pepper...but I found the pepper grinder on our table. The salad was just so so. \u00a0The dressing just didn't have a zesty flavor. \u00a0The oil (eggless) dressing had a muted flavor (not lemony or much hint of anchovy). \u00a0About 6 croutons w/ somewhat flavorless shaved but plentiful Reggiano cheese and lots of greens but a mix of baby kale w/ dark romaine lettuce. \u00a0I'm not real fond of kale...so it might have been good to know what the salad was made of. \u00a0The fries...plentiful shoestring fries, not too salty and not oily. \u00a0They were ok. \u00a0I just wasn't \"wow'ed\" by them. \u00a0  My partner's Arctic Char was very good. \u00a0Nice size fish filet w/ yummy herb butter sauce on top. \u00a0Side of broccoli and very yummy herb mashed potatoes. \u00a0  We shared a dessert a hot fudge Sunday. \u00a0This was very good. \u00a0It was really too much for one person. \u00a0I wish restaurants would offer two sizes of dessert so you don't have to get gigantic portions. \u00a0Ice cream was very good quality....not too creamy/thick...real whipped cream, the chocolate sauce was nice quality (not sickly sweet..lots of cocoa flavor) and bits of roasted pecans w/ some kind of light sweet crust on it. \u00a0This was my second favorite item of the whole meal.  Service....ok. \u00a0We almost got served someone else's meal when the food runner didn't know we were not the right table. \u00a0No big deal. \u00a0However, I would have liked to have known what comes w/ the entrees (since the menu lacked some of that info). \u00a0She wasn't very inquisitive about what we might be craving or selling us on a certain thing that might be extra good. \u00a0It was busy there, but I felt like the service was just mechanical (if that makes sense). \u00a0  Bathrooms clean/nicely maintained.  Very nice jazz quartet in the room...the volume was pleasant and enjoyable. \u00a0  I would go back for the artichoke...but I don't feel compelled to return otherwise.",

My husband's friend recommended Hillstone. \u00a0So, we made reservations for Saturday night...they only had a 5:15 open. A little early to eat but really wanted to try the place! Earlier in the day we stopped by to check it out...I asked if we could make our reservations maybe an hour later? The hostess with a warm smile said \"Sure!\" So, we got a 6:15 reservation, which is what we originally wanted.  We were able to walk from our hotel, Hyatt Regency, to Hillstone, which was fabulous considering the long taxi lines and $$ . We were also lucky it was a beautiful night in the city as well!  When we arrived the place was hopping! Ooohhh, the ambience was everything we love in a restaurant! It was lively, swanky and very low lit, which by the way is my FAVORITE thing in a restaurant! I had read one reviewer said the lighting was too dim...not at all!!! That's what makes this place so warm and inviting! I loved the red lights and cool ceiling lights. The jazz music was an awesome addition....so smooth and lovely to listen to. I give it a total thumbs up for ambience for sure. As for the food and service.........my husband ordered the prime rib! He thoughtt was fantastic! I went ahead and ordered the ribs.........WOW, I have never finished a rack by myself before...I couldn't stop eating them, total fall off the ribs! It is pricey at $ 32.00 but worth every morsel! The boys ordered burgers, which were also delish! Oh, almost forgot we had ordered the grilled artichokes to begin with! Out of this world if you love artichokes! A \"must\" for a starter! \u00a0 \u00a0  We were surprised to see wines by the glass you rarely see by the glass! We were delighted by that.....only one tiny glitch! My hubby ordered a glass of cab to go with his prime rib and it showed up after he was finished. The server immediately told us it was no charge for the glass. By the way, our server couldn't have been nicer, great smile and charm! The manager also came over to make sure we were happy with everything. We had a nice conversation with her and told her how fabulous our evening had been and that we certainly made the right choice for an evening in the city!! By far!! \u00a0 No room for dessert and the walk back was good for us after the amazing dinner!",

Walked here from our hotel. \u00a0Just missed a rain storm and got here just in time to beat the dinner rush on a Saturday night. \u00a0Corner table with windows on both sides, overlooking the piers, a bottle of wine, live music, friendly service---you just can't \u00a0beat it!  I really miss the sushi that many Houston's offer, but the rest of the meal made up for it. \u00a0We started with Rosemary bread and olives and almonds ($3 ??!!!!), toasty and warm with the most delicious olive oil.  I ordered the Atlantic Char, which was like a less oily salmon with the texture of trout. \u00a0It was cooked to perfection, light and flaky and moist. \u00a0Super Flavorful! \u00a0I was ecstatic with it!  Husband ordered the filet, which NEVER fails here. \u00a0One of the best steaks ever (Far preferred over places like Nick &amp; Stef's, Mastro's, and Flemings). \u00a0Super tender, juicy and the steak had a nicely grilled beef flavor. \u00a0Delicious.  After my second glass of Gamba (Amazing fruit-forward Zin)---I was skipping on the boardwalk back to the hotel. \u00a0A little bit giddy! \u00a0(Gotta watch that 16.5% wine!---Whew!)  Did I mention that I love this place?",

My idea of heaven was to come in on a Sunday afternoon for a dirty martini, their amazing creamed spinach and artichoke dip, and a hot fudge sundae for dessert.  The drinks are really well made.  The food is hit or miss depending on what you order, but once you know what's good you can stay away from the average dishes. The items above are fabulous. The chocolate sauce they use is out of this world and is served in a gravy boat which is always a plus.  The prices on some dishes are a little exorbitant even for San Francisco, for instance, $36.00 for a rack of ribs that has nothing special about it. It's not a large rack of ribs for 36.00, and the BBQ sauce is your run of the mill basic sugar sauce. It comes with fries and a dollop of coleslaw. Given the choices in SF for BBQ, they should really just hang their heads in shame and give up on this item, or price it where it belongs, somewhere around 18 .00- 22.00.  My main issue with them is their service and their attitude. I ride, and for the last 5 years I've been coming in wearing my motorcycle jacket, with my helmet and gloves in hand. The staff tends to look at me like I am something that just crawled out from under a rock. In one instance they told me the restaurant was closed when the people in front of me walked right in and it was obvious to me they were still serving. Now if they had a dress code, I could understand this, but you are as often surrounded by tourists in flip flops, shorts, and tee shirts as you are by suit sporting business folks, and it's not as if I look like something out of Son's of Anarchy. I am a neat and put together person and so is my gear. I'm very tired of the attitude, and attitude is what permeates their service mentality. My feeling is that if you are laying out big bucks for a plate of mediocre ribs, they could at least deliver on service, but often they don't.  And, I've had it.  Hillstone: You are losing a customer you have had for a very long time. You are losing my Sunday Afternoons, You are losing my Birthday Dinners, You are losing my friend's Birthday dinners, and  You are losing the business dinners I used to schedule into you.  While I know that in the grand scheme of things my patronage is a small drop in your bucket, my point is that I am not willing to pay your prices for the sort of treatment I've been getting.",

The artichokes were nicely seasoned and grilled to perfection. I could this as meal by itself   - Ribs with Shoe String Fries and Sauteed Kale -- Absolutely delectable! The meat was SO tender, it fell off the bone! Fries was very good and addicting too. They were cut thinly and fried very crispy. Can't go wrong with sauteed Kale and it was good. \u00a0  -Thai Steak Noodle Salad -- It was good but I wasn't too thrilled about. They put SO much peanuts in the salad that it should've been called Thai Steak Peanut Salad instead. There wasn't enough noodles in the salad and the meat was a bit tough for me. I wouldn't order it again.   -14 oz Rib Eye Steak Special with vine ripen tomatoes, bleu cheese and basil.  -- Love it!!! Rib eye was nicely cooked and very flavorful. I love meat and the piece of meat was delish!  Next time, I would definitely order Ribs and Rib Eye steak again. Skip the Thai Steak Noodle Salad.",

I came committed to getting the steak.  Lunch crowd was the expected business types from the nearby financial district. Many people in suits and business attire. I suddenly became aware of the cardigan and jeans wardrobe my fiance and I were wearing and hoped that it wouldn't reflect upon the service we were about to receive. Especially since we looked like the youngest patrons there.   However, much to my pleasant surprise, our service was top notch. Food came out quickly, glasses refilled before I could even ask, and the occasional \"How are you guys doin'?\" without being overwhelming.   We shared a spinach and artichoke dip. Generous helping, but have had better. Mostly spinach and not enough artichoke. I actually think the spinach dip at BJ's is better.  I got the Hawaiian ribeye and she got the Prime rib. My steak, cooked to a perfect medium, was seared masterfully with a nice blackened crust on the outside with a perfect, pink center. I think the only think that made this steak Hawaiian was the distinct teriyaki flavor, which I liked. I sampled a few bites of the my fiance's prime rib. I would say it was a little above average, but not on par with House of Prime Rib or the prime rib offered at Alexanders.   Four stars for the food. Five stars for the service.  Would come back again.",

There's a reason why we hit 'chain' restaurants in another city. We're looking for a familiarity. The service, while a lovely girl was woefully inept-however she gets points for being accountable.  1. Took more than 8 mins for someone to greet us, get water etc. Everyone else avoided eye contact w/fervor 2. They charge for bread here, Santa Monica doesn't or didn't last I was there 3. I am very specific in the way I order and how I want it cooked and she noted she liked the hand movement Spinach dip was lukewarm Ribs came out, were not charred and my baked potato had everything on it-as opposed to on the side. This is where the server was awesome. After I pointed out the gaffe-she was apologetic and ran it back to the kitchen.  Apparently they don't often receive requests for 'charred' ribs. When the plate returned to the table the ribs were shriveled beyond belief.  I guess all wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't gone to the manager and let her know of my experience, that it was my birthday, I'd been looking forward to coming and that I was really disappointed.  She basically said, \"We don't do free bread service. And if everyone wanted free dessert after a meal...\" She was nice about it, and I suppose if their bottom line is what she's protecting they found a bulldog. She offered to pay for dessert but at that point the taste was too sour in my mouth and we'd paid the bill. I was surprised she hadn't done more to ensure that I'd come back, but I suppose w/the killer view they don't need repeat business.",

Last year's Valentine's day massacre at Blue Plate, where seating was delayed by 1 1/2 hours, lead me to expect the worst so we arrived 10 minutes late. We waited another 15 and were seated. Whew!  The place is big, and has the feel of a well-oiled machine. As well it should since it's part of a 48 restaurant chain.   Prices are high but portions are generous. We had crab cakes ($38) which came with two sides. French fries were perfectly cooked, and a Cesar salad was unmemorable.The cakes themselves were almost all crab, and the crab was fresh (see my other posts for info on how sensitive I am to unfresh seafood...). There were two cakes, and each was about the size of a hockey puck.   For a main course, we shared the filet mignon ($42), which was also large at 10oz. It tasted good and was cooked well, and came with a choice of vegetables. We had the spaghetti squash, which was just ok. There were mashed potatoes included too, and those were not particularly smooth or interesting in any way.  Wine was not a great value, and the selections we had were only drinkable, not delicious.   Service was friendly and prompt, the place was comfortable and well run.   3 stars because the food is fine but not sublime, the wine isn't notable, and the prices are high.   Still, if you have no other great options and you want a steak, and you don't mind spending money, Hillstone is a perfectly reasonable, safe choice.",

I know I know, so stab me for partaking in the bounty of a major chain, but honestly, I've never had one bad experience here. \u00a0Granted they were all evening visits, but this establishment makes me feel at home immediately: the warm and cozy feeling. \u00a0Not sure if it is because of the dim lighting, cushy bench seating or the simple robust menu. \u00a0Maybe because the company with which I was always blessed with were just wonderful people full of lively conversations and swathed in good intentions. \u00a0  The wine menu is also extensive (had a lovely Meyer Family Syrah, sweet notes of fruit balanced with the spiciness of the tannins) and went well with my Center Cut Filet. \u00a0I usually order a Rib-Eye steak, but the Hawaiian Rib-Eye was not on my mind tonight (I prefer steak plain. \u00a0No marinades. \u00a0No toppings. \u00a0No sauces.)   The Center Cut was fabulous. \u00a0I always order mine rare, with a slightly warm center. \u00a0Tender and succulent. \u00a0Perfection. \u00a0A little salt and cracked pepper and I was in blissful heaven. \u00a0He ordered the Prime Rib, rare, and again, amazingly tender and savory. \u00a0I had to acquiesce to his urging of two samplings. \u00a0Both of our dishes came with a baked potato. \u00a0I barely touched mine.  Pricing on the menu is typical of a steakhouse. \u00a0If you are here for an early dinner, the crowd is usually business, with a bunch of men in suits. \u00a0It was amusing to see several of his associates at another table and they all assumed he was on a date when he introduced me (noooooooooooooo, no no no) He's my friend, see? \u00a0F-r-i-e-n-d. \u00a0Friend. \u00a0I pointed to the \"friend\" sticker so easy to see on my forehead. \u00a0Come on, now!  I am aware of the dessert menu and may have to plan on saving enough room in the future. \u00a0Our server was attentive yet never over bearing and I do so applaud the warning of \u00a0\"no cellphone usage\" in the dining room. \u00a0I would happily kick the shins of anyone whipping out a cellphone at the dinner table.  He picked up the entire tab as if we were on a date. \u00a0I felt bad, even though I almost threw my share at him. \u00a0He refused and said it was for his friends who caused a scene earlier at the table. \u00a0Awww, thankful for such a nice guy. \u00a0 \u00a0  Love this place. \u00a0I'll be back!",

Dinner went perfectly after that. \u00a0I had their grilled salmon special with vegetables. \u00a0The salmon was perfect. \u00a0Lightly grilled outside, and just rare enough inside. \u00a0The veggies has some kind of balsamic vinegar dressing on it. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0My husband had the Thai Steak Noodle Salad. \u00a0I'm getting that next time. \u00a0Hunks of steak with mango and yummy noodles with a peanut sauce. \u00a0The food came very quickly - which was good. \u00a0  No room for dessert. \u00a0Like I said, the evening started off a little rocky, but the restaurant pulled through in the end.",

I was so excited! \u00a0I feel like they had a hard time getting a good following but I'm happy to see that 10 \u00a0years later, they are going strong. \u00a0A few tips: the BEST spinach artichoke dip on earth. \u00a0Amazing salmon, make sure get the chef's sauce too. \u00a0VERY tasty and unique Couscous. \u00a0I stole the recipe and now my family loves it. I should dock them one star for taking the chicken tenders off the menu. \u00a0They are the best chicken tenders on earth but, thanks to our \"san francisco\" ways, they have removed the fryer from the premises. \u00a0I suppose now there's still a reason to go to my original Houston's in my hometown.",

    "review_text": "This is seriously a meat lover's paradise. And I'm not even someone who enjoys red meat as much. I'm an avid chicken and pork eater but not a huge fan of steaks. Yet I am wholeheartedly giving Hillstone 5 stars.   The ambiance is romantic, intimate and classy and the location, right on the cusp of North Embarcadero, is one for the books. The waiters and waitresses are attentive, friendly and very helpful. We ordered everything our waitress recommended and were not disappointed.   Here's what we got:   Spinach and Artichoke Dip: YUM. It's creamy, smooth, flavorful and addicting.   Double-cut Pork Chop: Oh my. This is just too good. Juicy, tender, succulent, well textured and intensely flavorful. I love good pork chops and this just probed perfectly at my weakness.   BBQ Pork Ribs: Yes, the rumors are true. It is indeed \"fall-off-the-bone\" tender. This dish might just be worth the messiness.   Hot Fudge Sundae: This is definitely not your ordinary traditional sundae. It's unreal how good it is... so unreal that I cannot fathom words to describe it.   Drinks: Great wine selection (the Champagnes are especially noteworthy) and a decent cocktail menu.   Thus, I highly recommend Hillstone to both meat-cravers and those who are meat indifferent. However, obviously it's not the best fit for vegetarians. So give it a try on your next Steakhouse outing!   Happy Eating Yelpers!   TIP: Portions are huge so order accordingly - 1 entree per person and maybe share an appetizer instead of ordering 1 per person. You'll probably still end up with left overs.",

    "review_text": "Of course, it's not cool to support a restaurant chain, but this place ain't TGI Fridays, Chili's or even Chevy's, it's actually f***ing great!  I have been to Houston's many times over the past two years and it's always good. The food, service, live jazz, and drinks are great. The restaurant is roomy and has a friendly vibe with a big exposed kitchen.  I started coming here when my girlfriend discovered that this place is very kid friendly. Since the restaurant is large, the tables are spread out, it's easy to bring a todler and not disturb the other diners (and we usually eat early). I always look forward to going to Houston's because I know I'm going to have a great meal with attentive service.  The food: the baby back ribs are excellent, the roasted artichoke is fantastic and so is the spinich and artichoke dips with chips. The young lad is always happy with his child's chicken and fries plate. The seared tuna with butter lettuce, mango and avocado salad is very good too.   It's always a treat when there is live music. The young lad likes to watch the jazz musicians and do a little dance. Too bad they don't play on Saturday nights when we were there last, but he was very entertained by the outdoor fountain and fireplace.  Houston's is a cool restaurant that has something for everyone. I am happy to eat there anytime. We used to drive up to the Ruthorford Grill in Ruthorford (Napa Valley) to eat ribs and I recently found out that the Houston's chain owns this restaurant (the ribs and grilled artichokes are virtually the same). My mouth is watering now.",

    "review_text": "Houston's was good. Very good. Not in a super fancy is that foie gras on my plate kind of way but in a meal that hits the spot kind of way. Plus it's cozy, hits the nail on the whole mood lighting thing and has these nice leather chairs you can just sink into.  We waited about 35 min for a table on a Wednesday night. Since it was so loud and dark indoors, we opted to wait in the outdoor seating area where it was basically empty except for one group who had just polished off a bottle. Happy hour indeed. It was a very cold summer SF evening and my only chance of warmth came from the outdoor fire pit. While the outdoor fire pit shoots mesmerizing orange flames, sadly it provided no warmth on this chilly night. Luckily, being the January baby that I am, I was fine.  When we were finally seated, it was if the loudness subsided and my friend and I were able to chat. There was a bit of confusion with the drink order and waitress but that was all settled quickly. We got the cheesy toast (yummy) as an appetizer and both ordered specials of the day. His was a fish we could no longer pronounce by the end of the meal and my choice was a flat iron steak in chimmi-churri sauce. And since he had raved about these hand cut skinny fries, we both got the fries as the side order. My steak was amazing! Perfectly cooked medium, it was still tender and juicy inside. It was just full of flavor and I ate the whole damn thing. This is the steak I had expected to have at Ruth Chris'. The fries were fantastic too. I did not try my friend's fish but I did look at it. It looked as if it were topped with sliced pineapple but the slices were in fact *ta da* dungeness crab. He said it was good.  In the middle of our meal I had recognized the song the band was playing. Yup Houston's got the whole baby grand piano thing going on. The band was playing the Beatles \"There Are Places I Remember\" and that is one of my favorite Beatle's songs. I am immediately propelled into reflection mode. Anyhows the live entertainment was impressive.   For dessert we both got the apple crumble. It was good except it was too sweet. After about 5 caramelized walnuts, I was done. The scoop of vanilla ice cream was the saving grace on this dessert because it cut down the sweetness.   If not for the dessert, I would have given Houston's 5 stars. When did I know for sure that it was four star worthy? When the waitress brought me out a new glass of coke and took my original glass away. I was a little confused and surprised since I had not asked for a refill nor was I even 1/2 way done with my soda. My friend explained,  You should never have to drink coke mixed with water, ya know when the ice melts.\" Ah yes. Some rave about always having their water glasses refilled, I can rave about not drinking a watered down soda.",

    "review_text": "What is your preference? \u00a0Prime Rib or Ribeye? \u00a0  I enjoy both, so today I did a little research to see the difference between the two meats. \u00a0Whats the difference?  Apparently rib eye and prime rib are from the rib section. Although they come from the same part of the animal, they are cut differently and require different means of cooking.  A rib-eye is a steak, a piece of meat that is cut across the muscle into a slice, with or without the bone, which should usually be cooked quickly. Prime rib is a whole roast, which is a larger piece of meat that will serve more than one person and should be cooked whole, normally in the oven.  So why the question of preference or difference? \u00a0Because I ordered both ribeye and prime rib today at Hillstone. \u00a0I had been to this location back when it was still called Houston's. \u00a0Now years later, it has the same ambience as I remember. \u00a0It's a great place for large groups or even couples. \u00a0A lot of privacy so people can socialize. \u00a0A comfy fireplace to sit and have drinks at. \u00a0  The menu is fairly simple. \u00a0Only four simple appetizers, maybe 12 entrees, 5 salads, and a 1 soup of the day, and few desserts to choose from. \u00a0So here's what we ordered:  Hawaiian Ribeye: \u00a0this was an average cut of steak. \u00a0Charred nice with of course a sweet carmelized taste from the marinade they use. \u00a0It's tasty and prepared well. \u00a0  Prime Rib: \u00a0my guess is this entree was about 16 oz. of prime rib. \u00a0It came with au jus and mashed potatoes. \u00a0Very tender and flavorful. \u00a0  The rest of the folks at my table ordered ribs and chicken, desserts, etc. \u00a0All the food seemed to be prepared nice. \u00a0And while nothing was really lacking at Hillstone. \u00a0Nothing stood out either.   For ambience, being on the Embarcadero at a nice restaurant, Hillstone is great. \u00a0For food and my overall satisfaction I would say average. \u00a0  But the question still remains, ribeye or prime rib? \u00a0  While I enjoy both and I know some will disagree. \u00a0But I'm gonna go with ribeye.",

Because dim lighting and good food creates an ambiance, dim lighting and scarcely seasoned fish is more like a bad dream in which you yearn to wake up and profusely apologize to your taste buds.

The artichoke dip was ehh, they should named it hot spinach dip, there wasn't really an abundance of artichoke in it.  All of us ordered the rib eye, but I was the only who ordered the Hawaiian Rib Eye which was tastier compared to the regular rib eye. The Hawaiian rib eye was crusted with caramelize brown goodness, but I recommend subbing the mash or bake potatoes instead of the stringy fries.   Ambiance reminded us of the old Pepper mill with out the cheesy carpet and crystallized rainbow sugar, it was pretty loud due to our waitress flub a couple of our request.s They did have a two piece jazzy setup covering M Jackson and Whitney Houston songs. \u00a0IF you do try this place, take advantage of the no corkage fee.",

My husband always gets the ribs. For desert I love their sundae; it is the very best that I have ever had. It is served in a huge cappuccino mug with hot fudge and incredible candied pecans on top. It really is too much for one person so you may want to share and because it was just a sundae it was only $8, I think that is pretty affordable for a semi fine dining restaurant that is big enough for two.   I am only giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because the first time I went there I was totally starving and expected bread but they don't serve any. That is pretty odd giving the type of restaurant this is. And also, they have a spinach omelet on their dinner menu that just stands out like a sore thumb and I don't think a spinach and cheese omelet belongs on a steakhouse menu. I mean, this isn't IHOP where you can get breakfast anytime of the day.   One more thing, their menu design leaves much to the imagination. Being that my major was in hotels/restaurants, menu design was one of the most, if not the most, important aspects in a restaurant.",

My boys and I came here for dinner after seeing a magic show on the pier. We wanted something that was well prepared, good quality and a nice relaxing atmosphere. The hostess greeted and seated us right away. It wasn't as busy as I have seen in my other visits but busy nonetheless.  The low lighting, wood tables and burnt orange leather seats makes the ambiance posh yet masculine and classic in design. As our server took our order live jazz music danced in our ears and brightened our senses putting us in a good mood. I love trout so I decided the order Cajun Grilled Trout with Wilted Spinach while the boys opted for Kobe Beef Burger &amp; Fries.  The trout was delicious! It was grilled to perfection; slight crunch on the outside yet moist and tender on the inside. It was seasoned well- not overly salty or seasoned I could taste the freshness of the trout. The spinach was sooo good, wilted slightly with a crunch and topped with fresh shaved parmigiano. Squeeze lemon over both the trout and the spinach and we are talking heaven on a plate.  My boys said the burger was very good and I knew they were telling the truth because they finished 3/4 of it! I made it a point to taste a piece of the meat and it was very good- juicy yet charred.  Our server was ok. She wasn't friendly as the other staff and she lacked the attentiveness one would expect and as I have experienced during my other visits. She didn't smile, wasn't energetic and seemed liked she didn't know the menu very well.  Overall, I enjoy dining at Hillstone especially on the days when they have the live jazz band. The atmosphere is upscale casual, the food is delicious, the cocktails are great and the service is nice.",

Nope, one of the maitre d's came over and requested he take it off. He complied, but come on, if you're going to put on airs, don't give your customers silverware wrapped up in their napkins. You might expect that from Denny's. In addition, they really should do something about their acoustics. It's really impossible to have a conversation there unless you're a narcissist.

The atmosphere is great, the food is great, and the ambiance is just perfect. I don't recall the night that I came here, but I do remember a live jazz band preforming off to the side. It was a great touch and it just added to the whole vibe of the place.  The food (and drinks) was also pretty good. I ordered a rum and coke from the bar. The bartender had a pretty heavy hand for the mere price that he charged me. Love it! Also, we just came back from a day trip to Napa, so we definitely took advantage of the no corkage fee! YESSSSSSSIR!  I had the bbq pork ribs with fries. When they say \"fall off the bone tender\", they really mean it. It was just so good. Partnered up with some coleslaw and fries- no complaints there. I had a latte at the end of the night to top it all off, and for a meat joint, they make a pretty mean latte.   This place was well worth the money.

Those double-cut pork chops make my Top Cravings List. \u00a0The Thai Steak salad has a great sweet &amp; spicy flavor. \u00a0And the tortilla soup and brownie are staples of my mid-week diet. \u00a0The pork ribs are what originally kept me coming back years ago, and 9 times out of 10 they deliver. \u00a0  The only thing that concerns me are the menu tweaks they've been implementing in the last year. \u00a0In particular, the new bun on the French Dip. \u00a0Taking an item so spectacular and then changing one of the key elements makes no sense. \u00a0The new buns are denser, and don't have the crispy-chewy texture that make the French Dip overwhelmingly grubby. Now it's simply above average.  You lose a star for screwing up the FD. \u00a0If you ever mess with my DC chops, I don't know what I'll do.  UPDATE, 1/16/08: \u00a0Popped in for dinner last night. \u00a0Asked the waitress about the French Dip bun... \u00a0she said they're still using the new one, and she gets complaints all the time. \u00a0Head Houston's Chef... \u00a0step up and get your act together with the bread!

As for ambiance, it's very nice. \u00a0Very classy with nice water and stone decorations everywhere. \u00a0But there was one problem, and I'll get to it in a bit. \u00a0  So, we go for the big stuff on the menu. \u00a0My wife's friend and I get the prime rib and my wife gets the Filet Mignon. \u00a0And we start with the salad and spinach and artichoke dip to start. \u00a0  The house salad, while very tasty, was tiny. \u00a0And at 10 bucks, a total rip. \u00a0The dip was delicious and plentiful, well worth the $13.  The fries we got for my son were just average. \u00a0It would have been nice if it were seasoned or had some truffle oil, and at $5, not very happy with it.  Onto the main course. \u00a0The prime rib and the fillet were well aged and very soft. \u00a0But it wasn't seasoned well (if at all). \u00a0And prime rib had a non-existent crust. \u00a0I have had much better at Ruths Chris or Donovan's. \u00a0So, for the price, it was just okay. \u00a0  At these prices, would have thought that we would have a great view of the Bay and the Bay Bridge, but we were just 1 block inland and had a view blocked by Pier 23. \u00a0  While it wasn't a bad experience, when dishing out almost 2 bills for 3 people, I would like to come away more satisfied by the experience. \u00a0I think I need to try House of Prime Rib next time.  I will say, the staff was very nice (albeit a little slow) and was very friendly to my son. \u00a0They had a toy for him to play with and I didn't get any stink eyes when he shouted a couple times.",

I also liked how I didn't encounter a gristle on the way, too.Their House-Cut French Fries come with either ketchup or spicy mayo...or both! I was surprised to see my sister dipping her fries into the spicy mayo! She typically doesn't like foods that are spicy, but I guess the flavor and spice was just that good!   My sister ordered the BBQ ribs. At first she was scared because she was wearing her brand new shirt, and later I looked at her plate and it was all just bones. It turned out she used her fork and knife only since the meat literally just glided off!   My dad got the Hawaiian rib-eye, cooked rare. It was definitely smaller than what I got, but the soy ginger marinade complimented the rib-eye very well.   Last, we got the hot fudge sundae. You actually pour the fudge on yourself. The fudge was really thick and sweet and just the fact you got to do the pouring was awesome! The ice cream was good and the whip cream was somewhat light, but the fudge really stood out for me the most.  The service is definitely nice with the surprisingly fast service and the waiters always checking up on you. So that's a plus.  I hope to definitely come back again. Mmmm!",

I really thought that you and I had something special...different, if you will. I was in a party of about 14 and you tended to us perfectly; nary a mistake was made! So imagine my delight upon finding you located right in my backyard!  With an 8:30pm reservation tucked into my back pocket, we were off to the city to enjoy everything that I so lovingly remembered about you...the perfect appetizers, the succulent meat, the way you placed your hand in the small of my back just so...Needless to say, I was very happy to be rendezvousing with you again.  Imagine my surprise as we walked in 5 minutes early and were told that our 8:30pm reservation couldn't be honored, but that you would be able to seat us \"just after 8:30.\" Hmmm...as I recall, a reservation is supposed to RESERVE you a table at the specified time, no? Fine...we can be patient...FOR A MOMENT.  So, why? WHY? Why in the love of God were we made to wait for half an hour? 30 MINUTES? Standing. Waiting. WITH A RESERVATION?!?! This annoys me endlessly my love. My date was almost ready to walk out and eat somewhere else...in fact, he went back up to your hostess podium to inquire as to when our table would be ready.  Once you seated us at 9pm, after several apologies and the offer of a free dessert, we finally ordered dinner...now that we were STARVING!  But that's not all...Of course, the your waitress swapped the cooking orders for our steaks, so we had to send them back because one was too done and the other not done enough. You totally failed. TWICE.  When we finally got to eat dinner, your food was good, but when we had to pay your $100+ bill at the end of the night, the experience just hardly seemed worth it...  After the AMAZING experience I had with you at the Houston's in Dallas, your San Francisco restaurant has taught me that Texas Steakhouses definitely aren't overrated.  Where's your A-Game San Fran...pull your life together!  Yours Truly, Becky M.",

I gotta love a man who will bring me a freshly frozen glass for my warming martini.   I need to thank those Yelpers out there who shared the free bread and olive secret with the rest of us...just ask and you will receive a tasty treat.   Now, on to the review...the spinach artichoke dip was yummy, the ribs (baby back pork ribs) are to friggen die for, the crab cakes were tasty and crabby, the prime rib was cooked to perfection (but not better than House of Prime Rib, so don't use this as a substitute), and the french dip was meh (nothing to write home about). Finally, we shared two desserts \u00a0among 6 of us - hot fudge sundae was amazing and the apple walnut cobbler was....oh...my...god...good.   If you get there early, like we did, they will allow you to put your name in for a table, but you cannot make reservation (which sucks). So, if you are hungry and it is before 6 PM on a Friday, you will eat promptly...if you want to eat later, bring a snack, 'cause you'll be waiting for a while. But, make sure to ask for Ben's table, and he seemed to love it when I asked for the free olives.  Oh, I almost forgot...easy street parking which is a plus in the city, and the loaded potato contains green onions, not chives (in case you care, like my husband does).",

We also had the oak grilled artichokes, which was my first artichoke experience. Very good although I was a artichoky noob. I am also Chinese so I tried to get as much artichoke out of the leaves as I could. That was pretty fail. I ordered the ribs and they were delicious. I swapped the cole slaw for a side of dirty rice and it was kinda like Chinese sticky rice to me. The ribs was delicious and the meat fell right off the bones.

Also note that they have no private lot and tht they're directly opposite the Pier (forgot which number)...   So, gf and I both had the prime rib except she had corns seasoned with curry on the side and I had the skinny fries... both were super yummy!

The spinach &amp; artichoke dip tasted like it was from a package. It was pretty bland and you didn't get much of it. We had two orders for our table and I found myself dipping the chips into the sides of sour cream because that's all we had left and it honestly tasted better.  The filet mignon was ordered medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The problem was, it wasn't seasoned at all. It tasted like a steak you cook at home, you're so worried about cooking it for the right amount of time that you forget to do anything to the meat. Even a pinch of salt would've done wonders.  Overall, Hillstone is a fun experience. We had a blast and it's convenient if you work in the Telegraph Hill area. But I'm not going to be craving their food anytime soon.",

Had heard many great things about Houston's from Ryry's friends and finally got to enjoy a meal with them and had them show us the ropes. Here's how it went...  We started with the spinach artichoke dip which I thought was like regular restaurant fare. The salsa that accompanied it, I believe, tasted a lot like Tostito's Medium Salsa. I personally like and buy that brand and heat-level of salsa but I was expecting more from a fancy schmancy joint like Houston's. Oh well. Onto the next course...  The house veggie burger was highly recommended so I chose it with an open mind as I am not a veggie burger connoisseur... but I was interested. And when it came... wow! It was huge! A huge mound of skinny fries came with it, too! I took my first bite and... thought it was okay. The burger was falling apart which was a little annoying but I still ate it. The burger itself was sweet, bean-y and rice-y. I'm glad I tried it but it didn't really appeal too much to my taste buds. I ate almost all the fries (as I usually do) and ate almost all of Ryry's garlicky brussel sprouts that came with his meat burger. MMMMMM! SOOO GOOD. Perfectly cooked - I could have made a meal out of those and the fries. Awesome.   3 stars for the brussel sprouts, the great service (the waiter accommodated my pickiness very nicely) and the fact that they don't charge you when you bring your own bottle of wine (thanks to Ryry's friends for the wine!). Minus two because I wasn't really wowed by my burger and because the bill came out to $50 for the two of us with tax and tip. Kinda pricey for 2 burgers, fries, veggies and a splitting of dip and chips. But hey, they've got to pay for the rent in the Embarcadero somehow.",

If you don't like French dip sandwiches, beef or me rambling you may as well stop reading here and check out what the rest of the fabulous Yelp community has to say about this joint.  Still here? A'ight (Hmm, does anybody still say this other than the count on 'Greg the Bunny' and old crackas like me?), let's roll.  Simply put, Houston's has one of the two best French dip sandwiches (the other being offered by Harris Ranch) that I have ever eaten. Featuring tender slices of beef piled high between a roll with some kind of glossy coating (butter, I hope), this sandwich almost melts in your mouth. It's complemented nicely by a huge pile of shoestring fries and the standard au jus for dipping, although it's so good you don't really even need the au jus!  I've had a few other things here over the years, but this sandwich has blocked out any memories of them...in comparison to the French dip they're kinda like the anonymous crew members who get killed in those old 'Star Trek' episodes...forgotten by the time Captain Kirk is tapping the alien chick.",

I've had the cheeseburger and the chicken sandwich as well and they are both excellent and very filling, enough for two for sure. The service has always been positive with fun and enthusiastic servers. I need to go here more :)",

    "review_text": "I came here based upon a review from a fellow Yelper for my anniversary dinner. I was craving red meat and my bf didn't know where to go; we ended up at Hillstone. I'd like to think this restaurant choice was one of the better ideas of mine. GO ME! WHOOOO! Ok, enough of that...  We made a last minute reservation on a Sunday evening after a long day of doing touristy things (The SF Zoo &amp; Fisherman's Wharf). We parked the car, exchanged gifts, waited for our reservation time and to my surprise I was happy that I did make a reservation because the restaurant was packed!   The ambiance was different from what I expected. It was dark, had mood lighting, live music but was quite noisy due to the boisterous laughter and chatting. It's a 'fancy' restaurant with a downtown vibe where conversation is ok and being dressed down is better. We sat down, ordered the Barbecue Pork ribs ($29) (like my friend and so many other tip leavers suggested) and the Hawaiian Rib Eye ($34). The food arrived and it was food fireworks everywhere! The ribs' meat was literally falling off the bones and the rib eye was juicy and flavorful. Heavenly sigh...  I must also add that our waitress was literally like a ninja. She somehow knew when we needed something and knew when we didn't. It's not like some other restaurants where the waiter/waitress hovers over the table constantly checking on you nor was it the kind of service where no one comes to check on you. The waitress was darling, well-mannered and efficient.   Thank you Hillstone for making my anniversary dinner a success!",

We've been going to their restaurants all across the country (from Bethesda to NYC to Miami to Boca Raton to San Francisco) over the past 10 years and it never fails to disappoint. Start at the bar - I usually go with a gray hound since they have fresh squeezed grapefruit. My top 3 plates for a Houston's newbie are:  1. Crispy chicken sandwich - Ask for honey mustard on the side and spread onto buns. This is the one of the best sandwich you've probably ever had.   2. Cheeseburger - The best burger out there, IMO. Made with fresh ground sirloin every morning. Its great - up the game by putting some fries beneath bun.   3. Baby back ribs - Tender and flavorful. Not the biggest plate in the menu, so I order when I'm not as hungry or have had some appetizers.",

We walked in at 5 and we are told that since we did not have a reservation wait time would be 30-40 min max. Let's just say we ended up leaving at 6:50pm. Only reason we stayed that long was 1) it was my wife's birthday and she wanted to eat there, 2) One of the chefs saw how long we were waiting and was nice enough to give us some fries while we waited to be seated. While we were waiting to be seated I noticed that the guy who was encharge of giving the chefs the tickets and double checking to make sure that the order was right made 3 mistakes while we were standing there. On one of the plates that he was spicing up he over spiced one of them and wiped it down with his bare finger. Something I'm sure that the client wouldn't like to know or see.. After that I asked my wife if she wanted to go somewhere else at which she replied \"yes\" immediately. Never again will we go here. Just wanted to thank the nice chef who offered us some freshly cooked fries, didn't ask his name but he was the one working the grill where the salmon, steak, and burgers are made. Thank you.",

The Boston location gets 5 stars, no question, as does the NMB location. \u00a0I'd give 4 to the other locations. \u00a0But I've never been treated more rudely than at the San Francisco location. \u00a0So this is a review of the treatment, not the food, which is consistent with Houston's quality. I've been to Houston's at least two hundred times in twenty years, maybe four hundred. \u00a0I was new to CA at the time (July last year), and I told the waitress how much I liked the Boston Location and was happy to be there at the SF location. She could care less, though she told me the name of one of the managers who work at the Boston location. \u00a0Since I was returning to Boston the following week, I asked her to write it down so I could ask for that manager when I returned to the Boston location. \u00a0She refused, then disappeared and must have passed me on to another server. \u00a0It was the first time I left a marginal tip at Houston's \u00a0 I will never return to Houston's Embarcadero. \u00a0By the way parking is awful here. \u00a0The price was higher than I've ever paid at any other Houston's \u00a0and add to that the 1.5% San Francisco health tax and you have the recipe for a bad experience. \u00a0Okay, I can't blame the stupid tax or bad parking on that, but the service was awful. Maybe that's snobbish San Francisco, or a bad waitress. \u00a0Nonetheless I'll never go back. \u00a0Well I get my Houston's fix at Bandera in Sacramento-- nice folks, 50% same menu with the Evil Jungle Steak Salad, Spinach Dip, etc. I give them 4 stars since they don't have those shoestring fries. \u00a0 \u00a0I'll save my Houston's visits for Boston and Miami. \u00a0Skip this place-- it doesn't live up to the Houston's name. \u00a0It's amazing how a bad server and also an impersonal hostess, coupled with high prices can make a fan into a detractor. \u00a0Maybe they were upset that I came here alone-- well that's their problem.",

I have visited the Pasadena location recently and still a \"Houston's\". \u00a0Menu and selections are unchanged, still one of the best restaurants for gourmet dining along the San Francisco Embarcadero.  I have never had a bad meal at Houston's-Hillstone. The food is fresh, the meat dishes always tender and flavorful. \u00a0Two guests with me recently tried the gourmet cheeseburger plates and both said it was hands-down the best cheeseburgers they have ever had. \u00a0In-house ground sirloin with seasonings and spices added during the grind process. \u00a0The salmon has always been my favorite and never disappointing. \u00a0Desserts are a real sleeper, freshly made and delicious.   Hillstone isn't stingy with either main courses or dessert portions. You won't leave hungry.   Service has always been good, the wait staff attentive. The interior is low level lighting, dimly lit to give a very classy feel to the restaurant, yet at the same time giving off a warm glow. \u00a0Very comfortable seating with a pleasant level of privacy. Great location on the Embarcadero, easy to find, but street parking at times a bit difficult. There is a pay to park lot a short block away and Hillstone's will validate your parking stub to get half off the fee. \u00a0As San Francisco restaurant pricing compares, Hillstone is a great value and you are getting high quality fresh food, nothing touristy here.   Located roughly half way between the Ferry Building and Pier 39, a great location for lunch or dinner. Easy walking distance between the two or you can catch the F line streetcar out front that will take you in either direction along the Embarcadero..",

While the ribs were a go-to for a good portion of our party, I opted for the tuna plate and was a big fan; it's a great option for those that aren't meat-eaters. Their appetizer menu isn't short on deliciousness, either. Between seven of us, we grabbed an order of grilled artichokes, smoked salmon and spinach/artichoke dip. They were all great choices, but the salmon was definitely a standout for me!   While the food is not cheap, the fact that there wasn't a corkage fee really made it an affordable evening out. We each brought a bottle of wine to share and aside from a few cocktails that we had while waiting for our table, we saved a ton on what could have been super high drink costs. I should also note that our service was great. I recognize that handling larger groups can be a pain, but our waitress was spot on. Overall, great experience.

My boyfriend and I wanted an upscale, relaxing dinner after having a crazy/busy week and after considering a few places on our \"to try\" list, we ultimately picked Hillstone, which had great reviews on Check Please! Bay Area.   From making the reservation, to showing up early and sitting in the bar, to enjoying every bite of our meal, and then returning to the bar to watch the last half of the Warriors game, our experience with the service was second to none. Our server, Natalie, was sweet, genuine, and extremely helpful throughout our meal. And the bartenders (both ladies with brunette hair tied up in a bun--didn't catch their names), were also very charming, friendly, and skilled at making the array of cocktails we ordered (mojito, French 75, kamikaze shots). And the hostesses were very accommodating of our last minute reservation changes.  As for the food: we were very impressed with the kale salad (ordered without chicken) and the bread and olives appetizer. The entrees we ordered--Hawaiian ribeye and crab cakes--were both quite good, but overall, we felt that the range of entrees were a bit too limited and that there was nothing on that part of the menu that we couldn't make as good or better at a much lower cost at home. But that said, clearly you are paying for much more than the food; you're paying for an upscale yet consistent dining experience, for romantic, contemporary ambiance, and for a great location in the city.   The best part of all: no corkage fee if you bring your own bottle of wine! This was huge for us as we had a bottle that we were saving for a special occasion--and it went perfectly with our meal.

And then there's the fact that Houston's remains one of the only restaurants in the city to waive any charges for corkage. \u00a0  HOWEVER. \u00a0Being raised in the bay area during the 70s and 80s has made me particularly sensitive to certain ridiculous PC extremes. \u00a0This one in particular has always grated me raw, and is broadcast in all its frosted glory above Houston's womEn's restroom door (photo courtesy of Cat C.). \u00a0  \u00a0  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_D1Ev_zTZs5ijHkleK6C2w?select=AJtXPiqgxxnJEE90-b8F0Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_D1E\u2026</a>  I still love you, Houston's, but really??!!",

I ordered two appetizers and the Spinach Dip was amazing! \u00a0As well as the chili soup, I left that restaurant satisfied and extremely full. A year later I decided to go again, and this time I got the steak... And it was amazing! I love how juicy and flavored it is.. It definitely got me bloated after.  I really recommend getting the Spinach Dip because it's just a great starter and it keeps you satisfied until your entree come!",

We had the grilled artichoke dip (it was amazing especially the dip), crab cakes (best I've ever had..crispy on the outside and so juicy on the inside), and pork chop. I heard the ribs here is really good, I can't wait to come back and try it out. Everything was perfect, even the side dishes! Our waiter was very attentive and helpful too.  I am so glad this is not one of those super fancy restaurants where you empty out your wallet for mediocre food and have to talk really quietly....instead this place is filled with live music and delicious food. I really love the ambiance- it's romantic but cozy at the same time. The layout of this restaurant feels like dining inside a boat...I also love the artichoke lights they have, it makes the restaurant look extra nice.  There are very few restaurants that I love everything that is ordered but this is definitely one of them. I am already craving the artichoke and crab cakes.  Dining right on the Embarcadero water with dim lights, live music, amazing food, good wine, and great company just made the night oh so perfect!",

Crowd - Skews toward the Bridge and Tunnel and touristy types. \u00a0Also a bit geriatric. \u00a0  Location - Relatively easy to park here especially compared to other places in the City.   Service and Atmosphere. Nice clean atmosphere and decent service.   however for some reason they refused to give me the wifi password, which is annoying in this day and age.  Value - Slightly overpriced, but there is NO CORKING FEE. Take advantage of this.  Again, I recommend this place if you going to a Giants game or the Exploratorium and you need a place to take the kids and Grandma and Grandpa from the suburbs. It's a safe choice for groups.

You have many options in terms of where to sit, including a nice outside area as well as great bar.

Artichoke dip is a good appetizer choice though being strangely paired with sour cream/salsa. The prices are very high and something you would expect from a sit down on the Embarcadero. Remember, the no corkage fee only applies to the first two bottles. It's $15 per bottle after.  It's a good location with a parking garage next door ($10 after validation).

Once you walk in, you can view the kitchen over the shoulder-height wall and see the delicious food being cooked up and served. Cleanliness is definitely a factor, making patrons feel welcomed and not deterred upon first sight. My party and I made a reservation, and service was fast, so fast that it made Denny's feel like the DMV line on a busy Friday afternoon before closing time. We came, we sat, we ate. In that timely order.  The food was delicious. I had the special that night (of which I have forgotten the name) served with a large, medium-well steak, fresh vine ripe tomatoes and super soft and creamy cheese. The flavors almost burst with every melting mouthful. With a great dish like this, came a not-so-great price. As expected, it was at least 30 dollars. However, I feel that night was worth the extra pocket pain. I left pleasantly full and satisfied. I hold service with a high regard and a necessary component to great customer service in any store or restaurant that I am a patron at, so I would love to recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves steaks, has a group, and like a real fireplace and not one of those cheesy propane-filled faux-pits.",

I had a \"sashimi ahi salad\" which of course wasn't sashimi since it was seared ahi, but whatever. The sashimi was good although over seasoned but the salad was so overdressed it was almost inedible. The husband had a cheeseburger which he said was ok, nothing special for $18.

    "review_text": "Hillstone was good, but it wasn't great.   For the price of the restaurant (after tip, around $170 on 2 meals, 2 drinks, &amp; 2 salads), I expect a lot more in terms of atmosphere and food quality.  Positives First: The ribs were very good, and very tender. \u00a0My wife liked the sauce a lot, and she's extremely picky on meat sauces. \u00a0I would have preferred some choice in the sauce, or maybe something with more kick and less sweetness, but either way, it was good.  The caesar salads were also very good - it was an eggless caesar dressing (I assume olive oil -based), and had just the right amount of kick from the anchovy. \u00a0However, when you go to a fancy restaurant, you expect shaved (or at least grated) cheese on the salad - it was sprinkle cheese, like the kind that comes out of a can from the grocery store. \u00a0Maybe they finely chopped it up themselves from real cheese, or maybe not - I didn't notice anything fake tasting about it, but it had a very cheap look to it. \u00a0Croutons were good though.  Jazz. \u00a0Live jazz is awesome. \u00a0  The not-so Positives: I don't understand restaurants not having tables for couples. \u00a0They set us down at a booth that could have easily fit 8 people (and there weren't many people there), and we had to talk extra loud to hear each other. \u00a0Also, it was one of those booths where it's far enough away that you can't actually reach the table properly without sitting up away from the seat back.  The fries were bad. \u00a0I would like to think they were fresh, but they looked and tasted like fast food fries. \u00a0Okay, that's hyperbole, but they definitely didn't taste good. \u00a0My wife only ate a few of hers, and I only about half.  The steamed broccoli was mushy. \u00a0I steam broccoli all the time, and I get steamed broccoli at restaurants whenever it's available. \u00a0I've never had it mushy. \u00a0It's supposed to have a firmness to it, a crispness. \u00a0I couldn't eat it.  The atmosphere of the restaurant had the trappings of high class, but beneath that, it felt cheap. \u00a0The waiters dressed nice, and everything looked clean, but the tables &amp; booths felt cheap, and everything in the area we sat in felt very crowded. \u00a0By the time it started filling up, I could hear everything being said by any other groups around me.  It got really loud, really fast. \u00a0We were some of the first people in for the dinner hours, and the volume was a nice, soft restaurant ambiance (with live jazz). \u00a0However, as soon as we were no longer the only people in our section, it started getting really loud. \u00a0I don't know if it's because of the floor tiles, or no window treatments, or what, but in combination with the size of our booth and the amount of other people also talking much louder than normal conversation volume, my wife &amp; I felt like we were having to yell to hear each other - which of course, would stack and increase the overall room volume.  There were only two dessert options... Again, I don't understand high-classed, high-priced restaurants that have these kinds of options. \u00a0We would have loved to have a nice, \"homemade\" dessert of some sort, but choosing between nut-brownie with ice cream and chocolate sundae (more ice cream) isn't really a choice.   Anyway, that's all. \u00a0Basically, I would say that we were not upset with our visit, but we were somewhat disappointed, and though we don't feel like we were gypped, we would not go back and spend money there again. \u00a0It's a shame, because everyone (including the bus tour guides) kept saying this was the fine dining place to try, but what we ended up feeling like was that it was just okay-dining, dressed up as fine-dining to increase the price of meals.",

And I won't attempt to argue against the finger-lickin-goodness that is their ribs. However there are two things about this restaurant that, you might say, lets the air out of the balloon for me.  1. On occasions where I'm craving something a little lighter than sauce and/or butter drenched red meat, I order the fish. I have tried their fish specials thrice now and have been continuously disappointed. I understand that they are a steak house and seafood is not their specialty but in the perfect restaurant world, if you are an upscale establishment charging prices of $30 and up for every dish, they need to be really good, specialty or not. 2. The service is really erratic. I seem to always get servers that fall on extreme ends of the spectrum. Either they are sugar and sweet and everything nice to a point of obnoxiousness or they're cold and inattentive, as was the case last night.  Just sayin - as much as I love their signature dishes, if it wants to keep up with all the other amazing steakhouses in the city, it needs to step up its game with the rest of the menu.  To end things on a positive note - the location and ambiance are pretty unbeatable - smack dab on the embarcadero and sporting a sleak, dark, romantic interior lined with comfy leather booths. If it wasn't for the messy makeup smearing finger food this would make a great date spot.",

And I'm not even a steak person! \u00a0Their rotisserie chicken is great, and anything with artichokes is fantastic, but really their best dish, which I go back to time and again, is the veggie burger. \u00a0Yes, I said veggie burger! \u00a0While not a steak person, I do enjoy a good beef burger, but have also been known to partake in veggie burgers from time to time, so decided to try it out on my first visit. \u00a0Holy cow! \u00a0I've never seen a \"meaty\" establishment put as much attention and care into a veggie entree like this burger possessed. \u00a0Richly flavored, made of beans and grains in such a way you could actually discern much of what was in it (I like this), just wow. \u00a0The ONE drawback: b/c it's house-made and not full of junky fillers, oh and HUGE, it can tend to fall apart. \u00a0Be prepared with either a fork &amp; knife or lots of napkins. \u00a0Totally worth it.  Service is excellent as well. \u00a0I seem to somehow go there when it's generally not busy, and you can see the staff turning the sugar packets and salt/pepper shakers so that everything is facing the same way. \u00a0This attention to detail is carried through to their service at your table as well, and is consistent across locations of this non-chainy chain restauarant. \u00a0At a different location, my brother ordered a burger, and after a wait short enough we didn't even realize we were waiting, the manager came over to inform us that they'd run out of ground beef. \u00a0My brother's face hadn't even finished falling when the manager continued to tell us that they were grinding some fresh for him and they'd give us a dessert on the house for our extra wait. \u00a0A freshly ground-in-house burger and a dessert for an unnoticeable wait? \u00a0Um okay! \u00a0From what I've seen, you can expect this kind of service at any of their locations.  I feel like the prices are appropriate. \u00a0I like to suggest Houston's/Hillstone for occasions that are special, without breaking the bank. \u00a0I couldn't afford to go here every day, but it feels fancy enough that I'm not sure I'd want to if I could, yet it's still affordable for when you do want something just a little extra special.",

I find it difficult to enjoy my dinner if servers are switching during service without any explanation, can't get the orders right, firing entrees way too early, opening dessert wine while we were halfway through with our steaks and the bottle of red (Shafer Hillside select). At the end we left most of our dessert wine (Palmaz Muscat Canelli) cause we felt rushed.  Manager (or whoever was in charge for closing walk-troughs) was walking around with the flashlight checking under tables while servers were following him around.

    "review_text": "I'm what you would call an absolute elitist when it comes to restaurant chains. Simply put, I try to avoid them like the plague because, to me, they're like public school lunch served to the masses - one recipe, cooked the same way in pretty much every corner of the country, with absolutely nothing that separates it from the food they serve in prison (not that I would know what prison food tastes like, but I'm sure it's not that bad, but not that good either). Anyways, this brings me to my point...Houston's is one of those restaurant chains I don't mind going back again and again...and again.  I haven't been to Houston's since my rodeo days back in good ol' Texas when I was traveling back and forth between Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, and Austin for work. Houston's was always one of those places I always ended up in during business trips. And not once has it failed me.   So I found it quite nostalgic when I found myself back in Houston's today, after an almost three-year hiatus. The Caesar salad was fresh and flavorful. The grilled artichokes was perfection - and OMG, don't even get my started on how amazing the aioli is. A mixture of mayonnaise, mustard, salt, pepper, lemon...and I dunno...crack?...made the aioli something I want to literally inhale in spoonfuls alone. The burger - huge, meaty, and flavorful. And as a little plus, they put butter...yes BUTTER!!!...on their toasted sesame bun. But if I had to rank the burger, I would have to say it's much better than Burger Bar and NOPA, but still not as good as Sideboard (Danville) or Father's Office (LA).  I'm sure the 600+ Yelpers who have already mentioned the steaks is convincing enough to tell you to um...try a steak there...so I'm gonna leave it at that and say...yes, go for it.

We are regulars here, and we've even had the chef decide that the fries weren't up to par so we got a couple other sides for free instead! Talk about quality control.

Recent reviews have been favorable, too.  When I made my reservation in person the day before, the young man at the front desk was very cordial, and when we arrived today a young woman was similarly welcoming. We were seated in a spacious, comfortable banquette which was ideal for our group.   Waitstaff here is excellent; our server was very friendly and accommodating and she cheerfully answered questions about menu items.  I had the SPINACH &amp; CHICKEN WALDORF SALAD which was very good and I'd recommend it. The salad was quite large and fresh tasting with healthful ingredients.  Other items served to us (chicken sandwich, grilled artichokes, plus other salads) looked good. My guests seemed to be pleased which is what mattered the most for me.

The Hillstone is in an ideal location on the SF waterfront and looks right out on the Embarcadero.  The ambiance is great, the service is fantastic and they have live jazz in the evening. \u00a0Everyone is friendly and accommodating, from the hostess, Christina, to our wonderful and charming waitperson, Ariel Noricks. \u00a0  We started off with clam chowders and Cesar salads. \u00a0Our entrees consisted of two white snappers with crab, a grilled Salmon with a very unusual but delicious cole slaw, and a chicken salad. \u00a0For desert, we shared the most incredible key lime pie I have ever tasted. \u00a0And to top it off, we had a bottle of Rombauer Chardonnay. \u00a0That stuff is good!  The only negative aspect was that the moment we sat down, we were bombarded by screaming and misbehaving young children at three tables that surrounded us. \u00a0The ambient noise level was high anyway so with the added screaming it was almost unbearable. \u00a0Ariel was wonderful and sensed our displeasure. \u00a0A table in the corner and away from the screaming opened up after about 15 minutes and she arranged for us to change tables. \u00a0We very grateful for their valiant effort to mitigate our discomfort. \u00a0Too bad the parents of these kids were so insensitive to the commotion they were causing. \u00a0My kids would never think of behaving that way in a restaurant.  The din was exacerbated by the low and flat ceiling and the general design of the interior. \u00a0There were no sound absorbing features so the sound waves just bounced around and around and around.  It was too bad because the food was delicious and Ariel was wonderful - probably the best waitperson I have ever encountered - charming, helpful, knowledgeable, and beautiful. \u00a0I think we would return some day but first check out the clientele to make sure we were not going to be seated next to any families.  Their website is: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hillstone.com%2Fhillstone&amp;s=1dda6cf42a65d360c060876c3456d2cd451925a31b41cc51150ff0ae70343b04\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">hillstone.com/hillstone</a>. \u00a0Click on \"Embarcadero\"  But for the noise, I would rate this restaurant five stars.",

Food: \u00a0Consistently good for basic American fare, and I mean consistently good. \u00a0If you liked your meal once, you will like it the next time, and the time after, etc., and so on, yadda-yadda, you get the idea. \u00a0Meat's the focus here, and they got it down--prime rib, ribeye, pork chops, rotisserie chicken, smoked salmon (appetizer). \u00a0Veggies are good, too (grilled artichoke is a standout). \u00a0This is not about daring or avant garde cuisine; this is about well executed standards. \u00a0Never had a bad meal here.  Service: \u00a0Efficient, cordial, again, consistently so. \u00a0My advice is to hold off on ordering your entree if you want to savor your appetizer, since the entree is likely to arrive fairly soon after you place your order. \u00a0We counteract this issue simply by waiting until we are halfway through our appetizer to order our entree. \u00a0The servers are so well-drilled, you can expect them to return to your table to ask if you are ready to order with alarmingly clockwork precision. \u00a0That is not a complaint, just a testament to how well-managed this joint is.

The burger is sooo juicy and delicious. Second in the city only to the burger at The Front Porch. And the fries? Houston's has the best fries ever. So skinny and crisp! I can down them with a side of BBQ sauce in about 5 minutes! The ribs usually also come with a side of coleslaw, but I always sub it out for corn or brussel sprouts. Their veggies are definitely not short on butter but taste soo good. (already raved about all these things in a previous review, but having been there a few times since then I thought I would just reiterate!)   Of the appetizers, I love the smoked salmon. It is pretty much a meal by itself though so I usually go straight for the burger.   Also has a great bar, nice patio, and they make home made dog biscuits.

We were sat in a booth and then forgotten. No server, no drinks, no anything. I got up and told the hostess that we somehow were not on anyone's radar. We were told that there was 'a mix-up in communication' and when our server Gabby arrived, she apologized sincerely.  It's really amazing how this could happen. First day opening up? Nope. First time seating customers? Nope. Confused about how to seat a customer and then take a drink order? Maybe.  I told my friend that when restaurants go out of business, they always say that the competition was too fierce or that 'it's the economy', but neither is true. They go out of business because so few have the ability to simply get it right: seat the customer, and ask if they would like a drink while looking at the menu. Assuming that the food is good - and I think that most established, upscale restaurants have pretty good food - then the other KEY factor is service, and how the customer is treated.  I couldn't believe that in a high-priced restaurant, I had to get up and actually ask for service. In truth, there WAS a mix-up, and we really were forgotten. No back-up plan, no follow-up from the hostess, no checking to ensure that all customers are attended to. Hmmmmm  OK, enough whining....... After our server arrived, feeling bad that we were ignored, everything was great! Gabby - our friendly and helpful server - was terrific. She came back several times to check on us, and was very professional. She apologized for the mix-up again, and bought our drinks. She was everything a good server should be. Friendly, helpful, professional, and knowledgeable.  I had the ahi tuna salad and my friend had the cheeseburger. Both were outstanding, especially the tuna salad. It's a bit of a pricey place - my ahi salad was about $23. and my friend's cheeseburger and fires were $18. But, it's a very nice place with great food, and try to get Gabby as your waiter.",

Quickly after followed a great dinner for all. \u00a0A Spinach and Artichoke Dip appetizer . The Thai Steak and Noodle Salad [Highly Recommended]. \u00a0 Prime Rib with a loaded Baked Potato. \u00a0And, not surprisingly, a good-sized wine list (try the Napa Valley Mi Sueno Cab).  Hillstone is good enough to go \"out of your way\" for, even on a cold Winter night in January. \u00a0I look forward to going again!",

I ordered the Hawaiian Ribeye and it was simply amazing, definitely a flavorful and satisfying dish.

They are located right along the Embarcadero, so you have somewhat of a pretty view (if you don't mind looking at cars passing by). And the restaurant itself is cozy &amp; beautiful. I've usually gone here during lunch time but I was told that they usually have live music at night which I have yet to experience.  But let's go over what I know/LOVE about Hillstone...  Their service never disappoints, I want to make that known. But I want to highlight the food:  THAI. STEAK. NOODLE. SALAD. I can never have enough of this! I've recommended this to others and every single person enjoys it as much as I do. Also, it's the perfect portion... better yet, perfect everything!  Crispy Chicken Sandwich You could totally share this between 2 people. If I'm not mistaken, the sandwich is served in 4 pieces. I tried this from a co-worker who couldn't finish it and brought it back to the office and that in itself is good. So imagine getting it fresh...   You get what you pay for, so I usually go here for special occasions or to take/meet any friends that are visiting.",

Hillstone is definitely consistent and fulfills the average level of expectation I have for this place. The food and service are both decent. The ambience is nice and they have live music during dinner hours (I can't remember if this is daily or just on the weekends).   Warning - there is usually a long wait for a table during dinner hours (at least 45 min). They have an adequate bar space so if you are a party of 1-3, I suggest this as your plan A.",

We're all human.) Wait tends to be long on a Friday or weekend night, but there is a bar where you can order drinks and appetizers already. Well-worth the wait.   Ambiance: Suitable for couples. good if you're on your first few dates because it has a lively atmosphere and sometimes live band (Piano, Double Bass, Guitar). Diffuse out any initial awkwardness.  Suitable for group of friends. lively atmosphere and large plates that could be shared or kept to yourself.  Good eats: - Artichoke dip!! with chips: another good recommendation is at Skates on the Bay in Berkeley Marina (Artichoke crab dip with focaccia bread but only go during Happy Hour) - Prime rib: it's different from House of Prime Rib because the edge of the rib is crusted with pepper and salt, so when you take a bite into that piece with a peppered and salted edge, mmmmmmm; medium rare is the juiciest. The ultimate orgasm is a piece with some fat, pepper/salt crust and juicy meat all in one bite. - French dip: another good recommendation for French dip is Fenton's Creamery in Piedmont Oakland. But the meat here is a lot juicier.  So-so eats: - Their fish dishes - Smoked salmon appetizer",

    "review_text": "Had a wonderful dinner Sunday evening with my wife.   With so many choices to pick from in the city, we just picked this simply because it looked like a nice place. Right on the Embarcadero, it set a nice mood for the evening. The restaurant itself was modern and oozed out some class, but not too much to a point that you felt underdressed if you weren't in a suit and tie. I'm sure many tourist also frequent the place as seen by several families we saw dining at the time. The lighting was very dim. It does assist in setting the mood properly for a date night. Some may consider it too dark, but it didn't bother myself or my wife.  I had the Prime Rib, and my wife had the steak and fries. My prime rib was requested medium and it came out just right. It was a nice thick cut. Definitely more than enough leaving me so full at the end of the night. Mind you this is without any appetizers or bread which they do NOT provide if you were wondering. So NO, if you were wondering, there is no complimentary bread. My prime rib came with a fully loaded baked potato and a side of horseradish sauce. The potato was ok, nothing spectacular, but everything you expect it to be. Overall the prime rib was good. Would I recommend it over House of Prime rib? I forgot the price of the prime rib here, but I know it was around the same price as a smaller cut at the House if Prime rib. So if you want a bigger cut for same/similar price you can't go wrong here. But all the additions at the \"House\" may consider that to be the go to place. I did fully enjoy my prime rib here and would get it again. My wife ordered her steak medium well and it came out just as it should. It was tender and very tasty. They had a marinate on it that really was evident with each bite.   Overall, we had a splendid time here. The staff was very nice and the food was good. It wasn't mind blowing good, but I had no issues with my experience. Your in a prime location in the city, nice dining atmosphere, and good food. Can't go wrong, and didn't during our time here.",

Food was excellent.  Service seemed intentionally inattentive to us. Beverages were never once refilled and our friends' stroller (we offered to collapse it and stow it under the table mind you) was first whisked away near the piano and then re-parked near the fire place. Felt like we were dumped when they saw we had a baby with us and presumably no alcohol ordered to rack up a bill there.  Great place to take out-of-towners from smaller places who may not have a daring taste for non-American dishes. If you have kids, you risk being snubbed and may fare better elsewhere.",

I live down the street from Houstons. \u00a0Because of this and some of their delicous menu options, my bf and I would dine here often.  After last Saturday's experience, I doubt we'll be back ever again.  We got there on Saturday (March 21,2009) around 8:00. \u00a0We knew they'd be busy, but didn't know that we'd be completely ignored. \u00a0We put our name on the wait list and proceeded to the bar to get a couple drinks. \u00a0We sat and waved at the THREE bartenders FOR AT LEAST THIRTY MINUTES. \u00a0By the time we FINALLY got the guy's attention (the ONLY GUY behind the bar) he litterally looked at us, shook his head and rolled his eyes.  I WAS DISGUSTED!!!! \u00a0I wanted to leave right then and there. \u00a0My bf on the other hand, really wanted the burger - so we stayed. \u00a0We tried to rationalize that this guy wasn't a bartender, but maybe a bar back. \u00a0In any event, he could've just said so rather than rolling his eyes and shaking his head at us. \u00a0  Finally, one of the female bartenders served us and 5 minutes later, our table was ready. \u00a0As we started to walk to the table, guess what we see? \u00a0The Jerk bartender guy pooring wine into glasses. \u00a0So, can anyone explain this to me?  Once we sat at the table, we ordered our appetizer and shortly after that, ordered our salads and meals. \u00a0  Out came the app. \u00a0YAY, our favorite. \u00a0We started to dig in - 2 minutes later, our salads came out. \u00a0Now, I'm a little irriatated that I have to eat my app and salad at the same time. \u00a0I thought - I hope they leave us a little time to eat this before our meals come out. \u00a010 minutes later, out came our food. \u00a0We still had a ton of salad and app left. \u00a0They tried to clear it to make room and I snapped saying - \"NO, can we please eat what we ordered? \u00a0We'll eat it with our dinner.\"  So at this time, we're pretty irritated that our meal was completely rushed, while it was impossible to even get service at the bar.  Finally, we finish and we're ready for the bill. \u00a0The server comes to the table and offers to box my steak. \u00a0I refuse and politely ask her to bring me a box so that I can box it myself.  As we're waiting for the box to come, all of a sudden, I SEE A BIG (I MEAN BIG) SPIDER crawling down it's web, dangling over my steak. \u00a0I freak out because I HATE spiders, grab the web, and throw the spider to the ground.  At this point, I look at my bf and say - \"I REALLY JUST WANT TO LEAVE NOW!!!\" \u00a0I had my legs propped up on his seat across from me, scared that the spider would crawl up my leg.  My bf on the other hand was quiet calm and just shocked by the entire chain of events. \u00a0The waitress finally came out, gave us the box, and I boxed up my steak.  Mintues later, as we were about to leave, my bf jerks and slaps his face. \u00a0SPIDER GUTS ALL OVER HIS FACE. \u00a0Now at this point, he's pissed, disgusted, and we left.  Sorry Houstons - I realize you're a chain restaurant, but, you need to learn a few things about customer service and perhaps have an exterminator visit your place",

They have an outside patio where you can bring your dogs to eat too. And they have a nice fireplace going on outside at night. It's usually busy here so you sometimes have to wait for a bit but they have a nice outdoor area with benches you can chill at and people watch.  Is it just me or this place is way dark inside? I know they want to set the tone, but it's a little TOO dark in here so ladies, be careful not to trip. But otherwise, the atmosphere is nice and cozy and the live group on the pianos and violins add to the ambiance. The service is always superb from the hostess to the waitress. Everyone in my group except one ordered the famous french dip sandwich. It's good, but I'm not a fan of that anyway, but it is the best one I've tasted. I ordered it cause it was one of the less expensive dishes on the menu and I didn't really feel like eating a hot steak on that hot day. What I REALLY love is the humongous fully loaded baked potato. I know, heart attack waiting to happen, but hey, sometimes you just need one. It's NOT as good as how I can make it though *wink* but it's still great =D   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! Couples, friends, parents, tourists etc. Try sitting out on the patio on a nice evening and bring your doggie along!",

Hawaiian rib eye - that marinade they cook it with is bomb dot com. get it medium or medium rare and that meat is going to melt each bite not gonna lie 3. flying tuna platter - tuna was seasoned perfectly and this plate   In the end - everything just blended well together and made a great complete dinner.",

We went through so many chips and asked to get more chips at least three different times. Our request was always pleasantly answered with more crispy chips and never a small amount!  I ordered the french dip and it was perfect with the au jus and horseradish. The fries were a tad salty but overall, very pleasant.  My friend got the pork chop which was great then--and still great the day after which is saying a lot!  I'd like to go back and try the ribs one day and a burger in restaurant.

    "review_text": "My feelings for this establishment is a little ambiguous.   I usually have come here for weekend brunch or on the way back from wine country on the mission to self-defensive eating but also dinner like last night.  For brunch, this is a great place, the food is always enjoyable, I normally like the Ahi Tuna salad at this time of day. The real deal for me is the comfort of not ever having to wait at least to sit. Lines are my enemy at restaurants and in life and weekend brunches are notorious for them at Hillstone it was never the case and quit enjoyable for that reason.  For dinner if you like me, need to feel the comfort of fries and burgers sometimes especially at the end of the weekend this is it. And this place does not have the nervousness of new establishments but the comfort of a place that has been around a while, a bit like Zuni in that sense. Relaxed, warmer then Zuni too and the bar, my favorite spot, has great seating to eat and drink.  My ambiguousness boils down to the service, its never charming, sweet, happy or friendly. In fact I would say down right boring, inattentive, aloof and a little snotty. Apart from when the bill is served of course. We have had to wait a lot after being seated or seating ourselves at the bar. Last night a good example, we sit at the bar hungry and thirsty, the waitress seems to not see us, and as a side note I hardly go unnoticed otherwise and even if I did, even better reason to see us.   So we flag down the waitress just in front of us which apparently till that moment has been able to see straight thew us, and as a note is working there with 3 others, which should allow her the ability to see everyone she is supposed to.   When we finally get her attention the snotty, unfriendly attitude makes me wonder what is wrong with her that day, did she fight with her boyfriend or not get laid in years? Whatever the reason I really do not want it to be my problem, it was completely devoid of charm and appalling the way she carried out her little rendezvous with us that night and with food as good as this place has it the little adjustment needed to make the guests, such as ourselves, feel more comfortable should be so easy.",

Specifically, I had planned a work dinner for 8. \u00a0We were seated at a round booth that more than accommodated our group. \u00a0Shortly after we ordered appetizers and wine, a spouse of one of the attendees decided to join us, for whom we had plenty of space at our table. \u00a0After having been sat for more than 30 minutes, the manager came over to our table and told us that he was going to have to split us into a table of 5 and 4, because they have a \"policy\" that does not allow nine people to sit at a table, regardless of whether or not there is more than enough space for everyone. As this was my work dinner, I was appalled and appealed to the manager to allow us to please sit there as it was not bothering anyone. \u00a0The manager, however, refused to allow us to sit there. \u00a0Instead he forced us to move to two adjacent booths and split up the party. \u00a0After a short time it was clear this arrangement would not work and I was forced to have everyone get up from dinner, and walk up the street to the Fog City Dinner, where they were more than willing to accommodate us. \u00a0  I can understand if we were making another party uncomfortable or causing a safety hazard (such a blocking a fire hazard, etc.). \u00a0No such issue was present. \u00a0Instead, Hillstone management, in essence, threw my group to the curb for absolutely no legitimate reason. \u00a0I am incensed that a restaurant would act in such a manner. \u00a0It caused a ridiculous shuffling and scene that was entirely unnecessary. \u00a0And moreover they had three empty tables sitting there with no one to fill them. \u00a0  I called to their corporate management this morning, and they could also care less. Over the years I have spent tens of thousands of dollars at their restaurants, which again, they could care less about. \u00a0Ok, that's there decision. \u00a0Very, very disappointed with the restaurant and it's management's attitude!",

Next time, I will get the prime rib, it was a nice thick slice with a fully loaded potato.   I noticed a lot of tables having 5-6 bottles of wine, which I concluded there wasn't a corkage fee.

    "review_text": "Hillstone (Houston's) is always one of our top choice for a first rate meal and happy dining experience, especially when we don't feel like taking chances exploring a new place and when we don't feel like dealing with the annoyance of bad service elsewhere. My husband and I have been dining at Hillstone for about five years, probably with an average of once per month, and I can say with confidence that we are always happy when we leave and always happy to go back. Even though this is a midsized family-owned national chain of boutique restaurants, the experience is on par or better than other high-end and \"yelp-raved\" restaurants.   At Hillstone there is no risk to be seated at a bad table or to be assigned to a bad waiter: the service is always excellent and pleasant. Even the host employees are always nice. Your order will not be messed up and if you ask for modifications on the preparation of your meal, they will be happy to accommodate them AND they will get them right. The portions are satisfying and the food is not heavy... so unless you eat more than you should, you will not leave feeling heavy and gross. And on top of all this, there have no corkage fee.   ---------- Summary --------------------------   SERVICE: excellent, always  FOOD: very good and always perfectly prepared  ATMOSPHERE: high-end but comfortable, low lights, comfy upscale boots and tables, live jazz on some nights, fireplace at one end, lots of dark wood.  BAR: great place for a drink, where you can sit comfortably and talk, with enough going on to make it lively, but not too loud. Great to also eat here.  PARKING: easy street parking - a plus when you don't feel like dealing with it.  TIP: they have NO CORKAGE FEE 7day per week!! So now you have another reason to stock up on amazing wine during your visits to Napa or Sonoma Valley!  -----------------------------------   MORE DETAILS:   Some of our favorite entrees:  The fish sandwich (which is not on the dinner menu, but most times they have it at night too, if you ask them), the \"evil Jungle Salad\" (also called Thai Steak Noodle Salad), the Double Cut Pork Chop, the Ribs, the seasonal Vegetables or vegetable plate. All the appetizers are great: the home-smoked salmon is our favorite lately, but the grilled artichokes are a close number two option.   For dessert:  You can't go wrong with the classic American five-nut brownie with ice cream (this one WILL make you feel bloated but it's yummy), or the Hot Fudge Sunday, which arrives with a whole gravy boat filled with melted TCHO chocolate!! Dreamy!   The bar is also very nice. I love the lighting and the atmosphere. Sometimes we purposely go to Hillstone to eat at the bar. And the bartenders are always nice, attentive, and make great classic cocktails.   Sometimes be the wait, especially at peak hours on weekends, and they don't take reservations. \u00a0  SUGGESTION TO THE MANAGEMENT:  Can you get rid of the newer oval plates that say \"Hillstone\" on them? They look too mainstream and are a bit of a step down from before.",

    "review_text": "Hat's OFF Again - WHAT??? \u00a0We've been a devoted fan of Houston's, Hillstone and their many evolutions of fine restaurants at various locations for 28 years. No other restaurant group has such good management, food and consistent service. \u00a0I used to give them 100% , the past few years, maybe 95%. Still our go to place about twice a month for Sunday night, living in SF. \u00a0About 5 years ago, as we were being seated, manager announced to us that they had a \"no baseball hat policy.\" Strange as NoCal started the whole business casual thing and we were dressed in cashmere sweater and jeans. As an embarrassing moment- best to be called away from the table and guests to address this but we thought - fine enough. Upon later visits, noticed lot's of baseball hats and sloppy dressers so chocked it off to someone had a new idea but no longer appropriate. \u00a0So on occasion, baseball hats return - don't give it much thought. After all, this is a SF restaurant with sports games broadcast over the bar and a friendly casual place. Not the Pacific or Bohemian Club. \u00a0So tonight we had guests in from out of town, one gentleman just finished a round of chemo, hair line isn't looking the best so he wore a hat. So tonight, we have a young hostess ask him to remove it as they have a no hats policy for men. Strange was the table next to us had a gentleman with a Giants hat on, on the other side of the restaurant, we found another. Needless to say this was unpleasant but more importantly found the management of such a frivolous and inconsistent policy, a policy which is not notated on the web or front door, ego, \"Jackets Required.\" \u00a0So tonight, our dear friend, who is fighting cancer, who looked forward to a night out and who had no idea it would be inappropriate to wear a hat and who would then be embarrassed by a hostess who might have been doing her job but whose execution was a disaster. \u00a0If Hillstone wants such a policy, they need to give proper notification of such a policy and \u00a0polity address it by asking the guest by stepping aside and most importantly, be consistent. \u00a0Going forward, if we have a bad hair day, we might skip Hillstone but will certainly return because they serve great food. Will be interesting to see how this plays out.",

We had just put in a long day, (early morning, 12 hours straight, no breaks, no lunch,) and just wanted a place that served a decent amount of grilled (non-fishy,) protein.   Walking along the bay, reading each menu, examining the number of open seats, we bypassed location after location. Until finally, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted Hillstone across the street. Shaded among the trees, I couldn't tell that it was a dining establishment at first.   Luckily Yelp's iPhone app saved the day, and we dodged cars and train to arrive at Nirvana.   First off, the Rosemary Focaccia and Olive Plate could easily be a meal for one by itself. I have never had focaccia that was just so perfect! My only complaint, is that the individual pieces were huge!   I settled on the Prime Rib, I've somehow never had it bone in Prime Rib before. Let me tell you though, I am sold on that practice. This was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever had, even compared to the place in Dallas Texas where the owner's brother raised the cattle and only sent over the choicest cuts. Even better then what I and my degree in Grillology can manage in the back yard at home.  The Hawaiian Rib-eye was just as good, and simply sealed Hillstone as one of the best places for a side of beef around.",

My problems started right after this, and after a lot of googling i realized it was because they didnt rinse the salad i ate there good enough. So, im telling this to save the rest of the people who think about going here. Im sure this isnt all of their food, but i do regret eating their salad that i heard so much about.

But it wasn't until my friend Robyn introduced me to their prime rib that I started dining at Houston's regularly. \u00a0Bone-in and medium-rare, w/ a loaded baked potato and both creamed and straight horseradish on the side. \u00a0Yum. \u00a0I've probably had this same meal over 30 times now. \u00a0  Their spinach and artichoke appetizer is second to none. \u00a0The aioli they serve alongside their grilled artichokes is unlike any other, and quite honestly, is one of the many reasons why I keep coming back (mainly because I haven't figured out how to make it myself.)  With the holidays, I've been somewhat overwhelmed with prime rib lately (yes, I know, I didn't know it was possible either) so on my most recent visit to Houston's, I opted for something different - their burger. \u00a0I usually get burned for straying away from the usual but felt a little adventurous that day, and am glad to say that I was not disappointed. \u00a0The patty was well seasoned, but the details that differentiated this burger from many others I've had were the fact that the buns were toasted AND buttered and \u00a0that the slices of tomato had their core removed. \u00a0Definitely one of the better burgers I've had in San Francisco.  No corkage fee doesn't hurt either.  Conveniently, I've always had a Houston's nearby. \u00a0Back in college, it was a short drive down Jamboree. \u00a0My first job out of college, my office was down Rosecrans from the Houston's in Manhattan Beach. \u00a0My sister even lived down the street from the one in Pasadena. \u00a0And now, I make the trek across San Francisco to the Embarcadero for my fix. \u00a0I think I'm a Houston's lifer. \u00a0At least until I figure out how to make their aioli :)",

I highly recommend the following   Starters:  Grilled Artichocke's with the aioli mayo dipping sauce PHENOMENAL  Spinach Dip- they do it right served with chips, salsa, and sour cream. I recommend ordering the rosemary bread and marinated olives plate before this arrives so you can dip the bread in the dip...the chips can't hold a flame to that combo!  If it's Friday order the clam chowder...it puts all the wharf stands and their stupid bread bowls to SHAME...quality over quantity is the name of the game here and Houston has it in spades. BIg juicy NOT CHEWY pieces of clam, a light creamy soup base that isn't gelatin-esq or heavy on the flour, and the onions/potatoes are cooked perfectly.   Main Course:  RIBS RIBS RIBS....they marinated for days and are smothered in a great tangy BBQ sauce order a side of grilled asparagus if your not a fan of coleslaw (but I will say their coleslaw is high end stuff and not 80%mayo like many other places)  STEAK mmmm its worth it  PORK same as above and have it served with the mashed taters because the sauce they top the chops with goes great with them  Desert:  The sundae is so decadent....so rich...if you have room I highly recommend OH GOD the fudge sauce is homemade and is thick and gooey just the way you want it...none of that thin runny funny business.

Ah to be young and naive.  Last night after not visiting for a year or so, I came for dinner with my grandma. We ordered the focaccia + olive plate to start. I remember when bread was free here, but at $3 that wasn't exactly breaking the bank. However, there were only 4 olives on the plate so they should probably rename this.   I ordered the thai steak and noodle salad. It was beautifully plated and tasted good, but I felt it could have been great, and that always bothers me. Here is what they should improve:  - Our waitress didn't ask me how I wanted my steak cooked. It came out well done... I like my steak medium rare to medium. - My noodles were undercooked. Either make them crunchy or cook them until they are soft. There is no middle ground. \u00a0 - If avocado is listed as an ingredient in the salad, I expect more than 1 tiny chunk of avocado. No one has ever said, \"there is too much avocado in this salad.\"   Our food came out quickly and service was good so overall it was pretty good, but at those prices I expect better than pretty good.",

You expect everything to be good but usually you're paying for ambiance and service. The bartender hand me my bourbon and holy! That was a huge pour. She hand my buddy a drink and the same thing. Awesome. I'll probably go back just for that reason alone.  So we finally sit down and there were 6 of us and one of the cool things about this place is they don't charge a corkage fee so we brought a couple bottles of our favorite wine. \u00a0Waiters make their money off tips including drinks so we didn't want to go overboard but two bottles we felt was not overkill since there was 6 of us. We still ended up ordering drinks and a bunch of food.  Everyone's food was great. My steak was perfect. No one had any complaints. Server was great. The one complaint we had was when it came to the wine we brought. It wasn't cheap wine that we brought but the server simply opened it left the glasses at the end of the table and then left. We kinda all looked at each like ummm ok I guess its self service on the wine since we brought it. That is the first time I've ever had to do that at a restaurant corkage fee or not.   Not a huge deal but we had some friends in from out of town and we all were puzzled by that. Not sure if the waitress was irritated that we bought our own wine or what. We're good tippers usually more than 20 % and we're pretty easy going, not very demanding.  Regardless when I'm the mood for a big hearty dinner Hillstone is the place I'd head to.",

Me &amp; my boyfriend were visiting San Francisco for the day &amp; needed a quick place to eat before our bus left. We were quickly seated &amp; waited on. The server was helpful, nice, &amp; knowledgeable. We ordered the rosemary foccacia &amp; marinated olives as an appetizer and it was delicious. Later that evening, a busser &amp; I were discussing the olives and I asked the name of one because it was fantastic &amp; I had never had anything like it. Not only did he go to the kitchen to ask, he brought me more! For dinner, I ordered the Thai Steak &amp; Noodle Salad. It was exceptional. Whole mint leaves, tender steak, fresh avocado. I was very impressed.  Since my boyfriend &amp; I were in a rush, we asked that the check be brought as soon as possible, and the waitress was very understanding &amp; fast.  A great experience!",

The last time I was at Houstons it was easily 8 years ago, and it was the one in Pasadena. \u00a0I ordered the exact same thing this time from then and it was exactly as I remembered. \u00a0Kudos to consistency and complete quality control.  I had the Hawaiian Steak with a baked potato. \u00a0Yummy. \u00a0Perfectly cooked and that's a lot coming from a girl that orders her steak medium well. \u00a0Wasn't dry at all. \u00a0Yeah, I said it. \u00a0practically well done. \u00a0I don't do the mooing cow steak. \u00a0Can't. Do. It. \u00a0The potato was perfect too. \u00a0Sorry, I was a bad Yelper and didn't take a picture of my plate. I know. I know.  We had great service, from the hostesses to the server. \u00a0  Parking tip - the lot behind the restaurant (I believe it was 80 Francisco structure) - 50% off validation is available for their customers. \u00a0$7.50 is the max with this validation. \u00a0Sorry no valet. \u00a0My friends were saying that the street parking was free after 6.

The exterior supplies a gorgeous display of lighting, as well as a peek into the restaurant itself where the ambiance comes off as cozy, sophisticated, and classy.  The restaurant features a live jazz band that plays catchy tunes throughout the night, a grand fireplace with seating, and a full bar by the entrance.  The food is absolutely amazing! Their artichoke dip with chips and their salmon bruschetta appetizer plates satisfied every tastebud pre-entree. By the time our main course arrived, everyone dug straight in to their food regardless how much we ate during appetizers and drinks. I've got to give them mad props for their garlic-mash, which is better than any other mash-side I've ever tried at any other steakhouses (yes, including House of Prime).  Post-dinner, you must get their \"worth-the-wait\" (?) drip coffee. As full as I was, I still managed to down some of that simple-yet-orgasmic brew.  Overall, I had a great experience here at Hillstone. The staff are more than courteous. Though the kitchen did manage to mess up our prep-preferences, our waitress took back one of my more voiced friend's plate, who actually spoke up about her medium being done, and brought her a new plate and took care of the appetizers for us. We left more than happy, not because of the deal, but moreso for her hospitality.",

For our appetizer we had the artichoke dip with tortilla chips and we all had salads to start. Main courses were ribs and the hawaiian steak with fries. Our server gave us some spicy mayo dip for our fries which was to die for. The food took awhile to come out of the kitchen but the manager came by to apologize. For dessert my friend had the brownie sundae, CL had the hot fudge sundae and I had the apple cobbler. The hot fudge sundae was SO good. The chocolate sauce that came with it was really delicious. My apple cobbler was okay but it had alot of walnuts in it. My friend enjoyed her brownie sundae. We all left stuffed and happy. We even got togo reusuable containers.

One thing I noticed right away was the crackling fire in their fireplace which gives a romantic feel. Also, there was a lit candle at each table which adds to the ambience. There was live music playing (piano, bass guitar) as well.  The quality of food here is excellent. I ordered the prime rib (medium rare), it was very tender and juicy- just the way I like it. It was served with steak sauce and a baked potato. \u00a0My boyfriend got the BBQ pork ribs, which were SO tender and practically slid off the bone as soon as they were forked up. His order came with fries and cole slaw (I think). The orders were generous portions, so it's not as if you're going to a pricey restaurant that serves food covering only a third of the plate. Steak and beer- an awesome dinner! You get what you pay for. :)  As another reviewer wrote, you won't be disappointed if you order one of these. Unfortunately, we were so stuffed there was no room for dessert.   This is a good place to celebrate an anniversary/birthday/romantic evening out. I'd definitely come again to try their other dishes.",

Basically after I had ribs at Houstons I couldn't eat them anywhere else. Ribs at places like Tony Roma's, Outback Steakhouse, Hard Rock Cafe, etc are all just unacceptable now.  Of course their other foods are not bad. The spinach artichoke dip is a must try. The steaks, the prime rib is all good as well but it's the ribs that make it special for me.",

Get the spicy mayo with them. Husband had the filet mignon and garlic mashed - he loved both. We finished with the deconstructed cobbler for dessert - diabetes on a plate. So good! The service was perfect, I wouldn't have any constructive criticism at all. They had a piano and cello couplet playing, and it was just loud enough to enjoy, not so loud you couldn't have conversation at your table.

For $14, I would of expected at least 2 rolls instead of one! Although it was pricey, it was really good.   For my entree, I tried the Baby Back Ribs ($28) with coleslaw and shoestring fries. I finished my shoestring fries before I even ate two ribs! It was so good. Crispy and hot with just enough salt. The ribs was fall off the bone! Don't even need a fork and it was finger licking yummy!  I can't wait to go back again!",

    "review_text": "The plus of working at Levi's Plaza is the excuse to go to Hillstone (or Houston's or whatever you want to call it) for lunch. I've been here about three times and made sure I ordered something different each time. Here is what I've ordered:  -Spinach and Artichoke Dip: it's all right. Nothing super special, but the chips that they are served with are warm, crunchy, and not super thin. Not sure If I'm a fan of the salsa and sour cream that it comes with---what? are we at Chevy's?  -Famous French Dip: the place is known for it's french dip, but it's my least favorite dish of the ones I've tried. It's pretty average and not all that, considering it's $18.   -Thai Chicken and Noodle Salad: so flavorful and a party in my mouth! Includes mango and avocado and it has the perfect amount of spice throughout. Would definitely order this again.   -Nicoise Salad: a nice, light salad when you are in the mood for something that isn't too heavy. The tuna is very fresh and I couldn't get enough of it!   -Reuben Sandwich with Fries: a very generous portion of the meat is provided. Very juicy and unapologetic. Great choice for when you're ravenous. It will definitely make you feel like you need to be rolled out of the restaurant.   The service is pretty spot on and it's the food is very good, but it's rather pricey for lunch. All in all, I would go here again when I'm in the mood to splurge on a $18 sandwich. I'm a fan!",

    "review_text": "My affair with Houston's started some years ago. A friend of mine was in the wine biz and on rainy Sunday afternoons we'd belly up to the bar, order a bottle of Conundrum, one of their big ass burgers with a side of fries and cole slaw, and spinach artichoke dip to start the whole thing off. After the Conundrum, we'd get down to trying the many bottles she'd had stashed in her car. Sometimes we'd have to try as many as 5 or 7 different bottles. At most restaurants, this might be a big problem. Not at Houston's! Corkage is FREE! We'd crack bottle after bottle, blather on about God knows what, mow-down on an amazing burger and dip and fries, peruse one of their newspapers, and while away the dreary Sunday. And let's just say, when you're trying lots of wine, the bartender gets to try some, too, and that sum's up to some good service. O, them's were some good times!   The next phase of my affair with Houston's was less festive. And less lively as no wine bottles were cracked open. Let's call it \"The Honeymoon's Over Phase.\" \u00a0But none-the-less, still yummy. \u00a0I started working across the street and on sunny days I'd take my book or research or what-have-you out to the sunny patio and have a little salad or one of their delightful chicken sandwiches. Consistently yummy, though, maybe because I was so terrifically sans wine, I noticed that the service wasn't as warm and fuzzy as I'd remembered. In fact, I started to notice quite the opposite. Yet, since it was efficient, I figured What the Hell. I let it slide.  Next up, we have the \"I-was-knocked-up-and-all-I-wanted-was-a-baked-\u00adpotato with everything phase.\" Pretty much all I wanted from Houston's. Which was unfortunate, as because I wasn't even indulging in caffeine, all I would order (at the bar sometimes) was the baked potato (which is consistently delish!) and, well, water. Unfortunate for me because service was really not so hot. In fact, it was cold as the iced water in my glass. But that didn't stop me from coming in. I even brought my sweetie in for dinner. We sat at the packed bar. We ordered lots of food. We did not order alcohol. We were pretty much ignored. I decided that (despite the consistently good food) my affair with Houston's must end. I will not be ignored! ;P  Now here we are at the present day and I have yet again sparked up a thing with Houston's. Today was all about getting out of the office. About a crisp green salad. I sat at the bar. I did not order booze. I got Houston's service. Not too warm. Not too cold. Is it my favorite service style? No. Do they make a great seasonal salad/baked potato/burger/etc.? Yes they do.   All-in-all, it's nice to know that some things are consistent. Even cool service. Hey, the food is good, the free corkage is great, and the location is perfect for days like today when I need to clear my head with a little salad of beets and goat cheese at the bar with a glass of water, just so I can feel connected to the greater world.",

    "review_text": "A chain (with many other names) - but still, one we like. It's our high end comfort food restaurant of choice. The cocktails are very good (albeit pricey). Although, I've yet to get a mixed drink where the exterior of the glass wasn't very wet with spillage - it can get awfully sticky if you have a sweeter drink - and this is even when the drinks are straight from the bartender when sitting at the bar.  Food is all very good - good meat options, salads, hot fudge sundae...all good. Thai salad has a bit more heat than expected, something that probably should be noted on the menu (I've had it twice). It could surprise those who like a more mild offering. It works for me as long as my water is refilled often. :-)  Atmosphere is slightly clubby - slightly, and very nice. Servers all all very nice, professional, smiling (love!), and articulate. I have a minor complaint though. On a couple occasions we've been 'educated' about their policies - and that's how it feels. The very nice, smiling server will say, \"Oh - sorry you didn't know that adding steak to your salad is so much $$ (a lot more than I'd imagined), so we'll take that off your bill (nice), but now you know this for next time.\" Well, that is VERY nice/generous - but not *quite* right. Tell me that it's $$$ to add steak to my salad beforehand (or even better, add that on on the menu - but I realize this was my customization). It was good though, but the steak on the salad was cold. Same with the Thai steak salad. I'm used to steak salads of any kind having warm/hot steak on cool/cold greens. But, now I've been educated.   Other thing - salads are invariably overdressed. Knowing that, I asked for dressing on the side last time, but was told that it's not possible for the salad I had 'cause they use two different dressings mixed in the bowl. I was told to ask for 'light dressing' or 'regular dressing'. Still, I think 'on the side' could have been done using two different little ramekins (the way their sister property in Los Altos does it).  Still, we really like the place a lot, and we're never wondering \"have we been forgotten.\" That's great. And, now, as we are more 'educated' about how they do things and have learned how to be a better customer in many areas (cough-cough/wink), we know what to expect.  Oh - parents - by the time your daughter is 15, she should know that you don't pick up an entire steak with a fork and gnaw around the edges, head tilted to the side, long hair dangling on/near plate. Sorry - just had to vent. I feel better now.",

    "review_text": "I've been here two times to eat - one with a group of 10 guys, the other with a lovely lady accompanying me. Needless to say, these were two very different experiences! Irregardless, they were both exceptional!  Obviously one of the best parts of Hillstone is the no corkage fee, a rare find in SF! I enjoyed one bottle on my latter experience, and the on previous, between 10 guys we polished off 22 bottles on a Tuesday evening. Suffice to say the couples and families around us were not amused by the end of the night. The staff on the other hand, were extremely good-natured about the rowdiness, and they deserve 6 stars for their service.   I've had several things to eat here  - the artichoke dip - if you're a fan of CPK's spinach dip (and by a fan I mean you can't stop eating it when its in front of you), then you will love the artichoke dip. It's served with chips, so I'd ask for a bit of bread if you really want to enjoy it right - the classic burger, w/ bleu cheese &amp; bacon on top, was insanely good. Better than most gourmet burgers I've had (save for Father's Office in Santa Monica), it was done perfectly medium, and seasoned well - the FILET. This is the big boy, the badass that Hillstone *cough*Houstons*cough* is known for. It did not disappoint. I'm fairly sure it was dry-aged, and it was deliciously beefy. I ordered it medium rare (why ruin a great piece of meat?!), and while there was a bit of juice, I ended up asking for a side order of their mushroom sauce to add a bit of juicyness. The mushroom sauce (usually meant for the ribeye) was out-of-this-world. I'd recommend ordering a side of the sauce just to try!  For a SF steakhouse, Hillstone does not disappoint. Dinner for two ran about $80 including tax &amp; 20% tip. I've yet to have dessert here, as I'm generally stuffed by the end of dinner, but it looks delicious.  A minor drawback, especially if you're looking for a quiet place to eat - it can get fairly loud here. There is usually live music (piano, bass) going on in the background, and with the low-ish ceilings, both the music and other conversations carry right to your table. It can be distracting and I found myself speaking much louder than I'd expect at times. Food for thought.",

I'm in, let's do this...  The house salad was well portioned, full of delightful treats, you have the basics, mixed greens, sliced vine ripened tomatoes, toss in some walnuts, watch out now flavorful soft goat cheese, and ver sweet chunks of beets or another root veggie, I asked for blue cheese as my dressing, they don't have the dressing, just sliced in chunks, perfect. \u00a0Sprinkle a few croutons on there, and slightly drizzled with their sweet vinaigrette, a wonderful intro along with my Trumer Pilsner.  Enough with the silly details, It's all about those RIBS, they give you a steak knife, I picked it up in order to slice into my half rack and the slightest amount of pressure from my knife knocked the meat right off the bone, wait, what? yeah, their plating chef's must use magic to hover the meat onto the plate with ancient BBQ pixie dust, I swear one cough or sneeze, the meat will drop down onto the plate eagerly waiting your salivating mouth piece.  The ribs come standard with fries and cold slaw or two sides, we opted for the asparagus and baked potato, and it was an awesome combo, the asparagus was tender but crisp and full of flavor, the potato was solid, I'm not a baked potato guy, if you are, I'm sure this will make your taste buds do the running man, the best part was eating the skin at the end, yuuumay.

The hostess was really nice - she said hang out at the bar, it'll be about five minutes, and she would come and find us. I immediately liked that.  Bartender. Really nice. I'm getting a good vibe. Do we want to order at the bar? Why yes we do. Does he want to pour me a nice big glass of Pinot Noir? why yes of course he does! Hostess comes to find us before the Gimlet can be prepared. . . we transfer the bar tab to the table (it always shocks me at how many restaurants don't allow you to do this).   Watch the little step, the hostess says. Nice of her to point it out. We sit.  Nicole, our server, very friendly. Why is everyone so darn friendly here? We share a ceasar (average), and order the special rib eye (very fatty) - served rare (curbed my sometiimes insatiable desire for a thick cut of meat). This thing was like 2 inches thick. And it was huge. We split the steak and I still couldn't finish it.   On to dessert... bonus points for having soy for my cappuccino. Another shocking thing about restaurants, is when they don't have soy for my cappuccino. You would think that every restaurant and cafe in San Francisco (and the Bay Area) has a backstock of soy, but it's really not true at all.. .and shocking. So anyway, pretty good cappuccino. The Key Lime pie that it came with however...  home made whipped cream deserves a shout out. Key lime pie that tastes like it's made with actual key limes... even better. tarty goodness that is not compromised by whipped cream that you know has some sort of sugar whipped in (which this whipped cream did not, thank god).  All in all, a very nice meal. For a chain, I really like this place.  Plus, they are one of the few restaurants in the city who do not have a corking fee.",

Savor every last bite.\" And savor every bite I did. This entree came laid upon a one of a kind sauce that would just melt in your mouth.  The mash potatoes were also magnificently seasoned with the perfect texture and consistency.   The service was out of this world. Unlike most restaurants where you are assigned one server who stops by periodically (if that) to check up on your meal, the employees here work together. One would pass by and notice that your water was running low, and refilled it without a second though. Another would pass by to pick up dirty plates on their way to another table. Amazing team work. And our assigned server was just delightful. Genuinely nice, attentive, and pretty cute if you ask me :).

I noticed that I wasn't a complete fan at how dark the place was.. but I guess they are trying to set a mood. The aroma of BBQ and firewood filled the air and made my stomach growl. I was super excited at that point to eat some ribs.. I looked at the menu prior to going and had my eye on the Hawaiian rib eye so that's exactly what I got and split half half with my friend who got the pork ribs. I basically got the best of both worlds that night. My Hawaiian rib eye was cooked to perfection.. a bit chewy due to my medium rare liking but that was okay.. the ribs were fall of the bone and wasn't overwhelmed with sauce. I subbed the fries in my dish with mashed potatoes which were good and the fresh cut fries with the ribs were good too.. they indeed were fresh and reminded me a lot of in&amp;out fries. Everything was good.. service included. Had a good time and wouldn't mind coming back for a romantic date or something in that category!",

    "review_text": "A great thing about San Francisco is that the city has a wide variety of places to Drink, Dine, and Socialize, meaning that no establishment needs to satisfy everyone nor every need.  In the case of Hillstone it became the host for my office teams self reward for accomplishing several goals, and No We Did Not Sandbag On Expectations So Goals Could Be Reached :)  So with a party of 8, and some Petty Cash, 1/2 of our team headed out to make the journey from the South of Market to the Embarcadero and the environs of Levi Plaza.  With our office located next to a busy hotel, and the Giants playing away getting a cab just before Noon was a snap, though we had to give the driver the exact address of 1800 Montgomery so he could figure out the route via the navigation system. It was an easy ride, but 4 of us got delayed due to a conference call, and those of us at Hillstone had to wait to be seated since the host would not seat our party unless more then 1/2 the party was there (4 is less then the needed 5 when you have 8).  The positive of waiting was that I could check out all the Taxis roll up, and drop off customers many of which were wearing office/ dress jackets though few ties for lunch, Yup, good sign this is a good place for expense account lunches, and dinners. The space has a rich feeling due to how, woods, metals and stone are used, it is fitted with a large oval bar with hanging video screens so the game of the day might be watched for those that want to interact but may not feel the need to talk, and the dinning area is set with booth seating that is best for parties of 4 - 6.  Okay, so after about 15 minutes or so of waiting the balance of the party arrived, and with an extra chair added to the table our group was seated.  This was work, and lunch but we still covered a good portion of the menu, with the first easy recommendation being the Spinach Artichoke Dip, which the table started with. This was not only \u00a0very tasty. but even with 8 of us this was a generous serving.  Now to be fair I think that this is a great place if you are on an expense account, or if you are in the area, and just wanting a nice meal with a slightly upscale experience where price is not a huge issue. But that said, they have some nice beverages On Tap, and the dishes we had were all good, from the Burgers (including Veggie), Sandwiches like the French Dip (though the dip was just okay and did not taste like it was made from scratch), Salads, and Entrees with the Shrimp, Rib-Eye, Chicken, Barbecue, Prime Rib all getting good reviews.  The only thing that seemed lacking other then the value were the House-Cut French Fries that reminded me of Potato Sticks. So in short, Hillstone is a good choice if you have no issue paying a premium or if you are not footing the bill, and want a nice semi dressed place to meet a client or just have a nice meal.",

Moving forward a year, the wife and I decided to try Hillstone in SF. Can the service and food be just as good? Let's see....  Picked up the wife from work and drove over, no reservations. Waited 10 minutes and sat near the Jazz pianist. Music was just what we needed and service,once again, was great. I tried the same Hawaiian Ribeye. The steak was just as good, maybe better.

My previous review (for a different company completely, not a restaurant) was my first one star and it made me real sad to do that.. blah. So here it is ya'll...  I've been eating at Hillstone (formally Houston's) for about 10 years. About 6 years ago I moved 3 blocks away and started going way more often. The best thing about this place is its consistency in providing a great over all experience.   -The food is solid, you can taste quality ingredients and it is prepared well. Every time. While it isn't going to be the best thing you ever ate in your life or Michael Mina style hype, Hillstone's food won't disappoint you and will easily satisfy (or exceed) your expectations assuming you aren't some crazed foodie.   -No corkage fee!! Well, for your first \u00a0bottle (or maybe two?) anyway, but who is really bringing that much of their own wine to a place? I go wine tasting/buying enough to want to grab something from my own stash before I walk over. Especially if you have a great Cabernet that should be paired with a steak that you will never make yourself.   -The service is amazing! \u00a0I can't stress this enough. The staff is put together, friendly and on top of it! It irritates me to have an unprofessional wait staff, these guys could write the book on how to do it right! I don't think I've ever sat around with an empty drink for more that 5 minutes.   -The ambiance. Don't get me wrong, I'm \u00a0not coming here to get all romantic but you could easily do so. There is often a live jazz band (which has never been overly loud) and the place has nice mood lighting. If you're outside, there is a cool fire pit too.   Hillstone, lets stay together.. We've shared so much and I'm looking forward to more!",

Expect to pay $15 for a burger or sandwich that would cost $9-11 elsewhere. While many rave about the ribs, the portion is inadequate for $29 and the taste is common to any rib joint, BBQ specialty establishment. To add insult to injury in the department of being inadequate; fries are one of their key offerings but when asked for malt vinegar, the reply was that they carry only balsamic and champagne vinegars.   Wine is the only reasonably priced item on the menu. If you bring your own there is no corkage fee, a big plus; I suspect this has a rather spurious kick to their rating.  Outdoor seating is nice but quite noisy due to the very busy location. The immobile tables and umbrellas make some covering such as a hat is must for avoiding excessive sun exposure.  Service is average for what you would expect in this area.  Note that they add 18% gratuity for tables of five (5) or more, yes five (5) rather than the more usual six (6).",

I enjoy coming to this place because its a nice place to dine at while still being casually dressed. It definitely offers the best of both fine dining and casual dining. The restaurant had a romantic atmosphere because of the dim lighting and dark oak interior design and there was also a live jazz band playing at the time.   FOOD: Spinach Artichoke Dip with Chips - Best dip I have ever had at a restaurant. The dip is amazing and instantly melts in you mouth and has a great flavor that pairs well with the chips. They also give you a sour cream and salsa dip. Best of all there are free refills for CHIPS!  Ribeye: I ordered this medium and it was extremely juicy and not dry at all. It came with mushrooms on top of it with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The cut was thick and well seasoned. You can definitely tell the meat is well roasted and cooked in the fire.  Apple Vanilla Ice Cream with Walnuts: I am a big fan of apple desserts and this one definitely hit the spot. The apple slices with the walnuts instantly melts with the ice cream. What a perfect combination on the palate!  SERVICE: Great service all around. The waiter came by multiple times to help us with our plates and refilled our water constantly. We also ordered a bottle of wine to top it all off and the waiter was always attentive with our wine glasses.  I will definitely be coming back again for another savory slice of steak!",

Was seated right away at 6:30pm on a Wednesday (and I noticed it was fairly easy to get a reservation via urbanspoon for not long after) Same menu,same ambience, and same friendly service. Live music was a nice bonus. Stuck with my usual order: hacked chicken salad (generous helping of chicken!) and a side of fries but laid off the hot fudge sundae this time. Although, I HIGHLY recommend it over all the other desserts. Had I planned on coming here, I would've also brought a bottle of my favorite pinot noir (not so crazy about the ones they offer). Gotta take advantage of the free corkage!   Definitely a great place for an after-work beverage or just a tasty, well-done meal.",

I still think this is a great restaurant, but they seem to be a bit inconsistent. The last time I came here, the server gave us a basket of delicious olive bread to start but this time we didn't get any bread whatsoever. My party even noticed that there was some bread on someone else's table; perhaps it is no longer free? Maybe.. Maybe not. I ordered the prime rib for dinner and requested that it was prepared medium rare - a reddish/pink but when the steak arrived, it was at least a medium - a dull pink. The meat was not exactly as I had requested but it was still tasty nonetheless.   I'd recommend this restaurant to all and I would highly recommend the Hawaiian Rib Eye, it is absolutely delicious. The next time I eat at Hillstone, I hope the restaurant stays consistent and maintains their good quality meals.",

Any who long story short I believe I received horrible food poisoning from this establishment. I called to let them know, because personally I would want to know if I was a manager that one of my customers thought they received food poisoning from my restaurant. I also understand food poisoning is just a consequence of eating out in some cases and only restaurants with obsessive hygienic habits are able to produce food with a very low possibility of this type of situation and I also cannot be absolutely certain it came from Hillstone however the only other thing I ate that day was a coffee soo...... it seems rather suspicious too me. That said, what really bothered me was the fact that I called to inform them that I thought I received food poisoning from the Hawaiian rib eye. The woman I spoke to on the phone seemed upset and concerned about the situation and she told me a manager would call me back to get further info. I never received a call back and while I understand restaurants get busy, it is a pathetic excuse in my opinion to ignore a food poisoning complaint. Also we spent 150$ on our meal and while that might not be considered crazy expensive by SF standards, I look at it as paying 150$ for near kidney failure and fever for 4 days straight.

As an opener, we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. We got this the last time and it's still as scrumptious as I remember. For entrees, I ordered my favorite Thai steak &amp; noodle salad and she got the Red trout. I swear both dishes are out of this world. Seriously. No joke. I don't even know if you could put my dish into the category of salad because in a way it makes it less important. It's so *bleeping* delicious it needs its own category. No doubt about it. My mom's trout was especially tasty! And how'd they get it to be crispy, moist and flaky all at the same time?! By the way, it's a huge filet of fish. I finished it for my mom after demolishing my \"salad.\"  For dessert, they brought over that walnut fudge brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it and a lit candle. They knew it was my birthday so THANK YOU! My mom also ordered the apple crumble dessert. She \u00a0died over it. I ate all the ice cream. I admit it. No shame here. 'Twas my birthday so I did not give a *bleep!*   I also must comment on how well their food travels and stays fresh. I ordered take out for my dad because he wasn't able to make it to lunch so we got him the famous Hawaiian ribeye. Now my dad eats all his cuts of meat medium well so most people think that the end result would be a drier dish. NEVER. From the time we received his food till when he actually ate it, 5 hours surpassed... and it was still as juicy as ever! Not to mention flavorful! Wow. I could not believe it. Crazy.   Moral of the story, Hillstone still reigns supreme as my favorite restaurant. Although it's pricey, you pay for the quality.  Thank you for an awesome birthday, Hillstone!",

We have visited Hillstone on each of our birthdays. \u00a0The first visit (March 2011) was my husband's day. \u00a0After dinner, it was pouring rain and we requested the host call us a cab (we were staying in the City). \u00a0The host refused indicating they \"don't call cabs...\". \u00a0We ran through the ran and entered another restaurant, soaking wet. \u00a0The hostess there then called us a cab.  We went back to Hillstone last night (August 2012) hoping for nicer service and to celebrate my birthday. \u00a0Again a severe disappointment. \u00a0When we arrived and were standing at the hostess table we saw a waiter carry out a dessert with a candle in it. \u00a0While I was in the restroom, my husband approached the hostess table and indicated it was my birthday. \u00a0He was quickly told \"we don't do birthdays!\" \u00a0When he inquired about the celebration we saw earlier, the hostess rudely advised \"that table must have brought their own candle.\" \u00a0In essence, the attitude we always get is \"you are not good enough here...\" \u00a0It just feels yucky in light of the fact that this is just a regular restaurant and we were there to celebrate. \u00a0  Houstons (and other locations) is already a bit over priced, but then to have rude service is not worth it. \u00a0 If you are looking to check out this chain, I recommend that you wait to go to Orange County and check out Houstons or Gulfstream in Newport Beach. \u00a0I know we will be. \u00a0SF has too many other amazing restaurants to waste your money and be treated like we were here.",

Unfortunately, while the food tasted good, the service here was really atrocious. We had many different people stopping by to drop things off or pick things up without saying a word. When they did speak to us, most of them seemed hurried and rude. Our food took an extremely long time, and when it did come out, it was cold.",

Once we came here for my birthday dinner, and they somehow messed up our order or forgot about it, so the server informed us right away and told us not to worry about the bill because it was on the house. We didn't even notice we were waiting that long!   I even introduced it to my friends for our Christmas dinner and they loved it!  Sometimes if it's a super long wait, the cooks offer fries behind the window. There's also a waiting area by the fireplace. It's really a nice atmosphere there. Once they were completely booked for reservations, so we just did a walk-in. They sat us within 10-15 min.?  My favorite things to get are the cheeseburger w/ shoe string fries and artichoke dip.

We went to Hillstone after visiting the Exploratorium on Easter Sunday. \u00a0I was expecting a wait, but we were quickly seated. \u00a0After being seated, our server quickly asked if he could start us off with a beverage. \u00a0Really?? We barely warmed our seats and didn't even have a chance to look over the menu yet.   The food selection was better when it was Houstons. \u00a0I felt Hillstone's selection was very limited and the appetizers consisted mainly of salads, which they also have a separate section for salads on their menu.  Items ordered:  Famous French Dip ($22) - Served on a house made french roll with thinly sliced prime rib and au jus. \u00a0Beef was tender, but not as good as when it used to be Houstons.   Grilled Chicken Salad ($21) - Decent size and portion, but don't think it's worth $21. \u00a0Came with fresh greens, crisp tortilla strips, and chicken. \u00a0The honey-lime vinaigrette, peanut sauce had lots of flavor, but next time I'll ask for it on the side. \u00a0My salad was drenched with the dressing, which made it salty. \u00a0  There was nothing bad about our meal, but also nothing great either. \u00a0Service was average.",

From the one on one service, to the large plates, and the soothing dim ambiance of the venue, Houston's is an oasis among the conquering FiDi trunks.  After organizing a successful volunteer symposium ( OakTown MeetUP ), a friend and I decided to celebrate by grabbing dinner at Houston's.   Situated on Embarcadero, Houston's rests as a modern day Sinatra hangout. Perfect for that late evening dinner, with a straight up menu, and a bustling vibe cloaked within the mild lighting.  We sat at the bar, situated perfectly by the patio windows and a clear view of the flat panels for nightly highlights.  As a burger guy, I was repeatedly told that the veggie burger here was something to experience, and while there was a regular cheeseburger on the page, the look from our server pushed me into trying their specialty.  I don't have the widest spectrum on grading a veggie burger, as I've probably only had a few in my life, but this one was spectacular. The chopped onions, the warm jack cheese and a crisp bed of shredded lettuce and tomatoes made this burger evaporate.  It came with a side of grilled corn and white beans which coupled with the burger perfectly. I was celebrating the 4th again.  The guy next to me ordered the ribs, and I can guarantee you I will be coming in soon for those...  Houston's is a place I could put my name on. Our server was a gem, she was one of the multiple highlights of the evening, and was a pleasure to get to know and meet.  Save me that seat, I've found my in-city vacation landing spot.",

If you state on your menu that you charge 18% gratuity and stand by your service, you better live up to it! Our waitress didn't seem to know what so was doing at all. She would bring us food that we did not order, and then take it away to the right table. Or she would be gone without coming back to take our orders or even bothering to check in with us.   After I read all the great things Yelpers had to say about the Hawaiian Rib-eye, I decided to give it a try. Boy, did I regret that choice! The cut was not tender and the marinate was too sweet for my taste. But the baked potato side was delish!  Surprisingly the lamb was very tender and juicy. I must add that I was not impressed with the mashed potato. The chopped up bits of green onion did not add anything to the mashed potato. Should just leave it out.   Overall, I think they need to expand on the appetizers. I still can't believe they cook lamb better than steak! I mean this is a steakhouse, right? I'll just stick to Ruth's Chris and Morton's for my steak. Most likely not coming back here for steak or the service.",

Per many yelpers recommendations, we got the spinach dip and the Hawaiian rib eye medium rare.

Salsa and sour cream was also provided and paired greatly with the dip. At first we thought we weren't going to finish but by the time we finished, we felt we didn't have enough! shortly after, our main course came - the rib eye. at first bite i was like O.O this is sooooo soft. The rib eye melted in my mouth and all that pineapple juiciness just exploded in my mouth. it was pretty delish. the portion size was great too. i actually didnt finish. the rib eye also came with a side - we opted for the loaded baked potato and i did not regret my choice! the baked potato hmmm so good. loaded with everything from butter and sour cream to bacon and cheese. the potato was so soft. wasn't like any bake potato i've ever eaten...

Unfortunately, it's one of the only restaurants in SF with a very limited vegetarian menu. I ordered a Spinach Omelette for dinner. For DINNER! In front of coworkers. I looked even dumber than I normally do in this situation.  It's also a bit on the pricey end, but it's set up to be a nicer joint to begin with. I'd have to pass in the future due to my dietary restrictions. I'm sure the steaks are delicious though?",

We liked it so much we went back on our last night in San Francisco. We didn't have a reservation and the place was packed (on a Wednesday). We had a drink at the bar and were seated 45 minutes later. The bar staff are professional and make a mean mojito by the way.  We started with the foccaccio and olives. We'd been 'suffering' from the lack of good bread and olive oil on our 3 week vacation, and this $3 (!) starter hit the spot.  We had the Hawaiian ribeye and the ahi tuna, both of which were perfectly prepared and delicious. No room for desert unfortunately.  This was one of the best meals we had in California. We highly recommend Hillstone.",

First thing that struck me was how large the interior was -- it didn't look nearly as big from the outside and the design is gorgeous. We will certainly be back for a date night.  We split the French dip sandwich and the tuna burger. They use shaved prime rib in the sandwich and it was positively divine! It was tender, flavorful and melts in your mouth. The bread was good, too, and gives the sandwich a firm bite. It's amazing what good ingredients will do for a sandwich. There were no bells and whistles to zazz up the sandwich, just great bread and great meat.   The tuna burger was not what I expected. I thought it would be a big slab of fish, but instead, it was almost like canned tuna, formed into a ball and grilled. I wasn't much of a fan.   I saw the restaurant on Check Please Bay Area and their artichoke dip is suppose to be great. Will certainly try that next time.",

    "review_text": "I've never had a bad experience at a Houston's chain, and last night, my parents and I had an amazing dinner at \u00a0Hillstone!  Here's what we loved:  1. No corkage fee for 2 bottles for 3 people. I'm guessing the number of complimentary corkages depends on how many people in your party, but 2 bottles for 3-4 people is plenty! Hillstone also has a pretty decent wine list themselves, so there's really no reason to bring your own bottle if you didn't have one in mind.  2. Kale salad. I'm not a huge fan of kale, but this salad was delicious! There wasn't much of the bitterness of the kale because of the cilantro and light dressing. The salad was a pretty good portion, but didn't fill us up before our entrees came. The peanuts added a nice crunch to it.  3. Awesome steak! My dad had the prime rib, which was so tender that I couldn't believe it was beef. I got the hawaiian ribeye which was wonderfully marinated and had just the right amount of fat for my liking. The meat was also really tender and flavorful. Both steaks went wonderfully with a bottle of Chalk Hill blend that we brought. It was one of the best food and wine pairings I've had.  4. Portion size. You will not go hungry at Hillstone! My mom's steak salad was humongous and she couldn't finish it. No matter what you order, you will get a hearty portion. But the portions aren't so big that you feel like a pig. The steaks were a good size and I was able to down 2 glasses of wine with mine.  Go to Hillstone for a solid delicious meal. You can safely pick this restaurant knowing there will be good food, with plenty of options for everybody. The quality of food and service is always consistent and something you can count on.",

I live one block away and have eaten there for years. I frequently go when my husband is travelling as he doesn't care for the restuarant. I usually sit at the bar. \u00a0All the bartenders know me and know my \"usual\" order. \u00a0My main course is usually the chicken salad with the peanut sauce and dressing on the side. \u00a0I know the kitchen doesn't like it, but they always accomodate my request.  This evening a new manager, Jill Kanofsky, approached me. \u00a0She acknowledged that I am a regular and requested that I try the salad with the dressing already on it. \u00a0If i didn't like it, I could then have it with the dressing on the side. \u00a0I accomodated her request, didn't care for it and subsequently received one with the dressing on the side.  A few minutes later, Ms. Kanofsky approached me. \u00a0She explained that they would no longer be able to perform this accomodation in the future. \u00a0My response was that I come to the restaurant, because I like the salad that way.. \u00a0She then reiterated they would not be able to accomodate this in the future.  I don't think my request is so outlandish or exceptional. \u00a0I feel that you have lost a longstanding customer for inconsequential reasons.",

We needed a place to eat late night and one of us refuses to eat anything not stamped with a USDA stamp on the side of roasted rump. I ordered the pork ribs and they were so TENDER and flavorful! The fries were hot and thin and yes I'm one of those people who love ranch with fries. They gladly obliged and dinner went without a hitch.   I didn't order any alcohol but the tea was exceptional and our server was spectacular. Dinner was delivered right on cue, plates taken away when the main course was served and she checked back on us during appropriate moments throughout the meal. I've heard awesome things about their Prime Rib and it looked good but I'm a bbq sloppin' rib girl myself so I'll be back for their ribs again definitely.",

They have like, the BEST artichoke dip, omg, it's so yummy! Their service here is also really good and the atmosphere isn't too bad either. Every table has a candle lit and there's even a fire place!   But overall, the BEST part about this place is their desserts. All I can say is, OH MY GAWD. You HAVE to try their sundae. It has the perfect amount of vanilla ice cream, with their warm, homemade chocolate sauce, all topped with these really special nuts (not like some cheap kinds you get at baskin robins) , homemade, fluffy whipped cream, and a cherry on top.  BEST SUNDAE EVER.",

Even my Jewish Mother, who hated the movie, \"ET\" loved this burger, so if she likes it, then it must be ok.   First off, a personal note...I have passed this establishment many times and never went inside...didn't even consider it. But I do a radio bit at \u00a0a nearby building and one day decided to try it.  Fantastic service! Bravo!! Who cares if its a chain in la-de-da San Francisco?--They make good food and they're consistent! \u00a0And yes, the aformentioned \"BEST damn $14 cheesebuger, which by virtue of fate, led me to meet my current favorite female friend. I hope she's more than just a friend but that's another story...  I DIGRESS.  Houston's is a really cool restaurant; pretty good food, great bar, nice, friendly people, fantastic atmosphere and yes, a \"damn good burger\". I joke about the \"$14 burger\", but try it--I swear you'll call/e-mail all your friends; even your enemies too. It's that good.  And who knows? Maybe you'll even meet your future wife/husband too!

Extremely attentive, kept using delightful little catch phrases like 'cheers' and 'just a tidbit more?' - very entertaining -the roasted artichokes appetizer. for $12, probably the most expensive I've ever seen this app, albeit at a nice restaurant, but completely worth it. I would order 2 and call it a meal -ambience - bustling, boisterous, but not too loud. a hearty crackling fireplace behind us warmed the chilly SF night and made our table glow!  Downs :( -the food, besides the delicious artichokes, were completely lackluster and overpriced. Roasted chicken? yawn. Their signature cous cous? Served chilled, and with far too much greenery. French dip sandwich? Meh. All in all, not the great food that should come out next to such high prices.  -also, a pet peeve of mine is when you make a reservation at a restaurant but then have to sit and wait at the bar for 20+ minutes anyway. just ticks me off!",

This time I topped off dinner with the apple cobbler and vanilla ice cream. My request to add cheddar to my cobbler was met with skepticism but they complied.   The service was good on another busy night. They also had Hall Merlot. Yum!  No, I didn't put out when we got home. He says, \"i like to do my own meat.\"  -- original review 04/15/2007 --- Hodie and I invited a few of our friends to the city for a night out last night. Jeremiah eats only a few things (7 total.) Elaine is a vegetarian. Hodie and I just like to eat.   We decided on Houston's on a recommendation. We found nearby parking with no problems even though Houston's was packed. We found a spot near the bar to wait for our table. I had a glass of Chard. The glass had what appeared to be dishwashing soap stuck to the outside. Eww. \u00a0  A table finally opened up for us and we placed our order of drinks, appetizers, and dinner. I switched to a nice Merlot recommended by our waiteress. However, the Merlot came in a similar glass with dishwashing soap on the outside or it was the same glass.   There was nothing outstanding about the menu or the food. Our appetizer was the spinach dip. It was pretty good but the chips ran out before the dip and the salsa tasted like a jar of Safeway salsa. Bleh. Surprisingly, Jeremiah sampled this spinach dip.   For dinner I ordered the Prime Rib, medium. I expected pink but got mostly red. I'm not too picky but this was not what I ordered. It was still very good. (Don't mind me, I'm a Libra.)  Kudos for getting Jeremiah to try something out of his comfort zone and the excellent Merlot recommendation. Booo for the seemingly dirty glass and my meat being rare.   Props to the waiteress for being attentive and honest despite the large crowd. I did watch the cooks work hard when we got there. So I can appreciate the effort and overlook the doneness of the meat.   Overall experience is a 4 star.",

The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because my burger was literally separated on the buns with toppings on one side, and the meat and cheese on the other. Toppings were so thick it was impossible to eat it like a normal burger and put it together. I had to cut everything up, but the flavor was delicious.

It takes almost no effort to really chew, except when you bite into the roll. And with the accompanying hot dip it's a snap. I finished my meal in no time at all. The house salad is also good. Fresh, light and a perfect way to balance your meal. I normally don't order honey-mustard dressing, but this time I did and it was very good. Not too sweet or tangy.  The desserts are decadent! I tried the apple cobbler and key lime pie. The cobbler had huge chunks of halved roasted walnuts in a rich buttery caramel sauce. Make sure you spoon a bit of everything into one bite. The scoop of vanilla ice cream is a great contrast to the warm apples and crunchy walnuts. The key lime pie is the best I've eaten. It is not on their regular menu, but that nite it was a featured dessert. The absolutely best part was the graham cracker crust. It was chunky with bits of nuts, graham cracker and something else - perhaps crushed shortbread cookies? The pie filling was just tart enough and it was topped with homemade whipped cream! The portions are generous enough for several people to share.   The only cons I have are - very dim lighting, fries could have been hotter/crispier and not enough accommodations for large groups. (We had a group of ten that squeezed into a large booth) We would have split up but a few of the guests were from out of town, so we all wanted to catch up together.  All in all, I had a great time and will be back.",

    "review_text": "This was my second time visiting Hillstone's. The last time I visited was two years ago for a birthday dinner. It was a GREAT meal, but the problem was that on a Friday night--there were just WAY too many damned kids in the restaurant. Nothing infuriates me more than fine dining gone awry by unattended children making noise and interrupting my experience. Thus, I have avoided this location for a while.  I had a good friend visiting SF for the weekend and he was staying near the Embarcadero. Not wanting to visit my usual dining haunts, I decided to try Hillstone's again. This time a Saturday night visit was in order. I made the reservation, crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.  I was pleasantly surprised by dining at 8:30 pm than my usual 6 or 6:30. By then I guess people have to have their brats in bed, or they aren't dining out. I didn't spy any errant children in the establishment. I really like their big booths and the privacy they convey. All restaurants in SF are loud, but at least in a booth you don't feel like you have to be a part of everyone's conversation.  Our dinner had a variety of servers, which made the level of attentiveness a bit odd. Our main guy seemed to be all about getting the initial food info taken down, but then he wasn't very good about seeing to our needs afterward. Thus, 4 instead of 5 stars. The rest of his \"support\" staff for the evening did a great job of making sure that everything we asked for we got. He was there for the beginning and the end. Whatever, the food was delicious and I'm not dining out to make a new friend in a waiter.  I had the rib-eye that was the special. My partner had the ribs and my friend had the pork chop. We all raved about our various dishes. Even their basic house salad was divine. I WANTED the wedge, but I know better when dessert is a goal. I simply can't stuff myself with too much salad. With that said, the house salad is not small. It WILL fill you up to a certain degree.  The mashed potatoes that came with the rib-eye were enough to make me eat them. I DO NOT like mashed potatoes as a rule, so when I WILL eat them, you have done something right. These tasted like a combination between mashed and potato salad--if that is possible. Truly delicious is all I have to say.  I had the brownie for dessert but I'm not sure how I much I remembered of that. I was in a food coma after the second bite. The ice cream on top tempered the chocolate goodness. The other two diners had the cobbler. Nothing was left so I guess you could say they liked it. I also didn't get bothered to share my dessert--FOR ONCE. That's when you know the rest of your table is happy with their choices. No one wants to share.  We had a few cups of coffee and basically shut the restaurant down. They didn't try to hurry us out. It's a great place to catch up after you've consumed your mountain of food.  This is why we journey to San Francisco to dine. The choices in other parts of the Bay Area just aren't on the same scale. They exist but the options are greatly reduced.",

We ordered the Ribs, Smoked Salmon, and a glass of Prosecco. The Smoked Salmon was delicious - I loved the particular smoky flavor that was of this dish. The ribs were slightly disappointing - for a $30 dish of ribs, I would have expected more. Yes, the meat was soft and did fall right off the bones, but the sauce was just so blah. It tasted just like A1 - nothing special or unique. It didn't taste crafted or specially made by a restaurant of this type of stature.   I'm sure the other dishes are good, but I would skip on the ribs here. Lastly, the service was also disappointing. Our server was slightly rude and just didn't seem to have the care in the world to be waiting on us. I strongly believe in excellent customer service, especially at a semi-upscale restaurant. Other than that, I really enjoyed dining in the restaurant. When I first walked in, it really reminded me of a restaurant I had dined at in Florida.

Amongst us we orders the Baby Back Ribs, Ribeye Steak and a Skirt Steak. They were all mouth watering. I think that the most tender piece of the Ribeye was the best part of all. It just dissolved when it hit my tongue. But it was all fantastic and I can't wait to go back.",

    "review_text": "Oh Houston's! I really wanted to give you all 5 of your stars, but you had several downfalls that forced me take keep that one star.  But let's start with the good, shall we? -The ambiance: romantic and cozy. nice dim lighting with a pretty fireplace at one end. a live band came on for a little bit, but they made the place a bit too loud for my liking. -The food: Uh-mazing! I had the crab cakes.. the $32 crab cakes.. the most expensive two crab cakes, cole slaw, and fries I've seen/had in my life. They were perfect, though. Not too heavily breaded and I could taste the crab meat so well. The sauce was not too rich, either. Someone else in my group reported the pork chops were extremely good. Our vegetarian diner reported the vegetable plate was awesome.  -Service: They were attentive and quick with the food. Two thumbs up. -Desert: Two of my friends and I ordered all three deserts on the menu so we got to sample the brownie, sundae, and cobbler. My favorite was the brownie, but they were all delish! -No corkage fee? I wasn't sure because someone in my party did bring wine and I failed to ask, but according to another reviewer there is no corkage fee. That's a definite plus!  And now for the bad: -We had a large party of 9 total. We tried to call ahead for reservations. Initially (meaning a week prior to the event) we were told reservations could be made. When it was a day or so before, we were denied reservations. -So we figure what the hey we'll just go and wait. We arrived at 6:45 (possibly earlier than that) and were not seated until 8 pm - mind you this was a Wednesday night! We ended up splitting the group into two tables so we could get our tables faster. -On the same note, good for groups? I think not. They have a note somewhere that they split up groups of 7 or more. So in my opinion, this place isn't so good for groups. They way they are set up is better suited for groups up to 5 or dates of 2.",

After all, it IS one of my favorite places to frequent in San Francisco; aside from BIX it's one of those places I tend to 'default' to when eating in the city.   Is it the ambiance? After all, dining on steak covered in a peppercorn sauce while sipping on a really nice glass of pinot, surrounded by rich mahogony; is very nice. I'll even go out on a limb and say it brings a sense of 'fabulousness'.  Is it the food? Filet covered in any sauce is my favorite. Theirs happens to be VERY good. Desserts are 'ok'...but I usually like to get those at a separate venue afterwards anyway.   The location maybe? LOVE the embarcadero. And eating outside on a nice summer evening; PERFECT!

I looked at their menu online which was similar, if not the same, to the menu in the restaurant. \u00a0 We ordered Roasted Prime Rib ($37), Hawaiian Rib-Eye ($36), Barbecue Pork Ribs ($36), Caesar Salad ($12), and Rosemary Foccacia ($4). \u00a0We were hungry so that was why we ordered so much. Lol I don't think we waited long before one of our orders came out. \u00a0I will only comment on the food I tried which was everything but the Caesar Salad.   The Rosemary Foccacia was good and the bread was very soft. \u00a0Our waitress said all of that bread was baked daily. \u00a0While I didn't eat any of the Caesar Salad, I thought it looked like it was enough for one person's appetizer because it wasn't big enough for a meal; however, you wouldn't order a Caesar Salad from a place like a steakhouse like Hillstone. \u00a0That was just what I thought. \u00a0The Hawaiian Rib-Eye was delicious and I would recommend it to anybody having trouble deciding what to order. \u00a0The Roasted Prime Rib was good especially when dipped in their sauce. \u00a0The Barbecue Pork Ribs tasted similar to what they did the last time I was here. \u00a0The meat pretty much fell off the bone and the BBQ sauce was not bad but added some flavor to the ribs.   Hillstone was great for dates and the food was delicious. \u00a0I'll be back whenever I'm in the area.",

(The French fries are on the skinny side which I prefer)! I like the kale salad too but ask for the dressing on the side if you prefer a lighter coating of dressing- they are too generous with the dressing when you have them put it on. I like the warm spinach dip but the salsa that comes with it was not good. The shrimp cocktail appetizer is huge and filling. There were 5 HUGE I mean HUGE shrimp -even large for a prawn. Meaty, not fishy, served with a mayo based sauce and a cocktail sauce. Everything we tried was very good and service was excellent.",

The mashed potatoes and cole slaw that came with the ribs were equally good, and we don't really like cole slaw either. I ordered the french dip, very meaty and very filling, it was good. The service was fast and courteous and they thought of things that we needed before we asked (like a warm wet towel to wipe hands from the ribs).  My only issue I had was that I had made a reservation for 7pm and I wasn't seated until about 7:30-7:45ish.

So I went with 2 friends recently and had a good experience. We started with the artichoke dip which is accompanied by sour cream and salsa. Like my girl Suzy C said, the salsa tasted like canned Pace Picante, but the dip is quite good. Suzy, you are kind of a snob...lol!  The NY Strip was excellent and I went with the brussel sprouts instead of potatoes. Good choice in my opinion as I'd like to be able to move after eating. One of my friends let me try the ribs and I loved 'em! During the meal I started with a glass of Pinot Noir followed by a glass of a blend they had which was a Zin/Cab/Cab Franc and liked them both. Unfortunately, like many places in town, no real red wine glasses to help the wine find itself. Such a bummer when they get everything else right and serve you with these amateur glasses. Oh well. I guess I'm a snob too Suzy!  Overall, good experience. Very cool server, great and generous portions, and some decent wine to take it down with. I'll be back.

Although I've only dined there with big groups, the dimly lit seating area, live jazz band, and fireplace with couch seating in the back corner all scream one thing: first date place!   I recommend calling in advance for a reservation but remember that they don't take any reservations for over 4 people. Make sure to ask for a booth and bring a favorite bottle of wine (or two or three) to take advantage of their no corkage fee policy.   My hands-down favorite dish there is the chicken sandwich. It isn't the fanciest item on the menu to order but I promise you will not be disappointed. The entree portions are substantial and come with a side of vegetables or some starch. I recommend the baked potato. I've ordered the seasonal vegetable before and its either a hit or miss.   Other favorites are the spinach and artichoke dip, the french dip sandwich and the tuna tartare salad. I've ordered dessert twice before and although they were tasty, I don't recall them being that memorable.   Go eat at Houstons, you won't be disappointed!",

I splurged on behalf of the company and got the Ribeye Steak &amp; Frites. And I LOOOVE ribeye... but I was disappointed slightly with Hillstone.   First off, the steak was thin and overcooked. It was tasty with the marinade on it but that's about all that it had going. It also wasn't very big, which is fine, but not for the price. It came with shoestring fries which were tasty. But bleh for around $40 for LUNCH, it was very lacking and disappointing, even though it was a free lunch on my company. I'm so glad I didn't come on my own and shell out the $40 for something that was lacking.   The highlight was coffee and offering it in a to-go cup so we walked back with it. Their coffee was very flavorful and delicious. Kind of sad that that was my highlight of the meal.

A few were \u00a0sent back and the kitchen replaced each with steaks cooked more carefully. But even when grilled correctly, we all agreed the filet themselves were flavorless. So on top of the grilling faux pas, it seems the grade of the filet has dropped off significantly. And on top of the that, the price has soared! The $34 filet went up to $45! Kind of drag to pay more for less. Would have given 3 stars, since that better reflected the quality. But $45? Really. Wow.",

I really like this restaurant collection, and have been to several locations. One standout is the Embarcadero (San Fran) location. It offers a nice option away from some of the crazy tourist trap places on the more northern piers. There is also a lovely outdoor seating area framed with rosemary bushes - combine that with the bay breeze on a sunny day, and it's one of the best choices in the area.   My hometown, and favorite, Hillstone is Coral Gables. I'm a regular, for good reason. Hey have the best mojo to in town, and a fantastic sushi bar. The food and service is consistent, and consistently on point. The few times I've had a mediocre experience, they've immediately made it right. Great restaurant management shows.",

    "review_text": "I hate chain restaurants but I LOVE Hillstone!!!  Until this past weekend, it's been over 2 years since I've last been to Hillstone (formerly Housten's) and it's just as good as I remembered it to be, perhaps even better! \u00a0I'm not a fan of chain restaurants because I see most as glorified processed food, but Hillstone is certainly an exception; they use fresh, high-quality ingredients. Hillstone is a well-oiled machine, the food and service is consistently top notch and I've never been disappointed, so for this I have to award them with 5 STARS!  On Saturday, 7.30.11, my friend and I came to Hillstone for dinner at 8:15 PM (this was my fourth time). It took about 10 minutes for us to be seated with reservations so we grabbed a drink at the bar first. We both got a Goose Tonic which was stiff, but for $12 each + tax? That's a bit pricey and more expensive than most clubs in SF. They offer NO corkage fee, so definitely take advantage of that instead!  F O O D There 3 best things on the menu are the BBQ Pork Ribs, Hawaiian Rib Eye and Roasted Prime Rib. Order one of these and you will NOT be disappointed. *pinky swear*  *SPINACH &amp; ARTICHOKE DIP ($12): 4.5 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_D1Ev_zTZs5ijHkleK6C2w?select=5Nl1zTcZB6lZlWY2nE0dpQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_D1E\u2026</a> Hillstone has one of the best spinach and artichoke dips, if not the best in the city! The dip is filled with spinach and artichoke chunks that's tender but still has a bite to it. I like that the dip is creamy but not overly creamy so you can really taste the freshness of the veggies. The warm tortilla chips have a nice hearty crunch and the accompanying salsa gives it a fresh brightness while the sour cream gives it a nice layer of creamy tanginess.   *ROASTED PRIME RIB w/ a Loaded Potato ($30): 4.5 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_D1Ev_zTZs5ijHkleK6C2w?select=Eb80RrQPmiPmECcNRqi0Zw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_D1E\u2026</a> The huge slab of prime rib was roasted to perfection and my rare cut was pink throughout just the way I like it (I've since been ordering my meat \"rare\" since many places tend to overcook my meat when I request \"medium rare\"). It was so soft that it cut like butter and with minimal effort. With a touch of au jus, I was in prime rib HEAVEN! Each bite was full of rich beefy flavor that literally melted in my mouth. The prime rib here gives House of Prime Rib a run for their money; it's seriously THAT good!  The loaded potato was topped with butter, sour cream, cheese, real bacon bits and scallion. I'm not much of a baked potato person but this \"loaded\" potato was sinfully good. The potato was soft, tender and fluffy and the combination of the butter, sour cream and cheese added a rich decadence with the bacon giving it a smoky porkyness. It's definitely not for the faint of heart.   My friend ordered the Hawaiian Rib Eye and it was the BEST rib eye I've ever tasted. It was uber tender and had the perfect balance of savory sweetness. It was like eating Korean kalbi in a steak form; I'm definitely getting this next time!  S E R V I C E IMPECCABLE! The entire Hillstone staff is well-seasoned professionals which is evident in their customer interactions. Our waitress was very friendly, courteous and attentive without being intrusive. Even in a packed restaurant, our food came out quickly and we were in/out in a little over an hour.   A M B I A N C E / D E C O R Rich woods, candle lights and the pianist created a classy yet casual feel which is perfect for dates and small parties. The outdoor patio is perfect for those warm summer nights which unfortunately seem to be a rarity these days. Even when busy, noise level is usually at a medium and conversation is easily made without having to shout across the room.   P A R K I N G Easy street parking. Please note, meters are in effect till 11 PM.   As a foodie who is always on a prowl for new restaurants to go to, I rarely go back to the same restaurant twice. However, Hillstone is not your cookie-cutter chain restaurant, so I plan on coming back again and AGAIN...",

If you're in the mood for dessert, get the hot fudge sundae. The hot fudge comes on the side and you can pour as little (or as much) as you want with each bite. It's a fun dessert!

    "review_text": "When a restaurant elevates your perspective of what a classical dining experience needs to be, this obviously warrants a 5 star rating. \u00a0Hillstone has proven to me its reliability in quality food and service, and above all, its character.  Before I talk about the technical details (food quality and ambiance), I feel that I should spend a few moments praising the staff, who have given my friends and me the \"warm and fuzzies.\" \u00a0All of the waiters who we've encountered whenever we visit are humble, honest, prompt, and graceful in their interactions with us. \u00a0For instance, one of our steaks had a touch too much char (though the texture was absolutely fantastic otherwise, just the flavor profile was a bit compromised by the cooking technique), and the waiter immediately handled the replacement and completely wiped off that order from our bill with a genuine smile. \u00a0This is only one example of how Hillstone is serious about delighting the customer, though it is already impressive and seldom makes missteps, and I think other restaurants and even other American businesses can take a few tips from. \u00a0  You can come to Hillstone with some friends or business partners expecting to have a classy yet fun time eating an impeccable meal. \u00a0I like to describe Hillstone as a place where American classics are done upscale and done right, so expect to lick your plate of unctuous barbecue ribs or decadent Apple Walnut Cobbler. \u00a0Your mixed drinks are either the perfect palate cleanser or that catalyst for a good hardy buzz. \u00a0I'm a fan of the White Russian or a drink called \"The Trinity\", which was named after my friend whom the bar tender customized it for. \u00a0The venue design affords well-dimmed ambient lighting and a controlled volume for that special night with your buddies.   To start off a meal, I'll recommend the artichokes. \u00a0They're well-seasoned and well-charred, and pair perfectly with the tartare sauce. \u00a0Their prime rib, barbecue ribs, and crab cakes demonstrate clean yet complex flavors and superb structural integrity. \u00a0Fall-off-the-bone, no knives needed; this is when you know meat is cooked with a passion.  And you definitely HAVE to make room for dessert, no exceptions. \u00a0That Apple Walnut Cobbler will take you back to your childhood memories with a vengeance. \u00a0The depth of the hot caramel that coats the earthy walnuts and soft apples, which perfectly juxtaposes the cold vanilla ice cream will knock you into a happy place.  No restaurant is perfect, but I am thoroughly impressed with this place's consistency. \u00a0Their integrity reflects in the food and in the people, and convinces you that impressive sequels do exist in the world.",

Preface - I'm not a huge steak fan and would occasionally eat a few bites of my fiance's steak. You could say it takes a lot to impress me since a steak is so simply prepared.  I gobbled up every bit of my OWN Hawaiian Rib Eye here! Best steak I ever ate. It's a really tender, juicy, and well marinated steak. Picture this...party of 8 with 6 boys and 2 girls. Every single one of us ordered the Hawaiian Rib Eye. Enjoy!  My next runner up to this would be the Bone-In Filet Mignon (dry aged) at Boboquivari's Steakhouse in SF. Dry age makes the meat extra tender. Tons of marbling with gives it flavor. Salted just the right amount to bring out all the wonderful beefy taste to it.",

Holy jeepers, are they delicious!   We split an artichoke appetizer and a small salad while we waited for our mains. I got a steak (I know, I'm terribly predictable) while he got this monstrously sized prime rib. The only way we were able to fit these in our artichoke-filled bellies was to neglect large portions of the generously sized potato things we had on our plates. He got a generously filled baked potato and I had a mash of potato and onions.   My dearest had enjoyed a lovely cocktail while I entertained myself with my can of Coke. I appreciated the ice-filled frosty glass but I couldn't help but find it terribly amusing that I was served a can. I think the last place I got my soft drink in a can was at that hot dog stand in Alameda.   Anyway, come for the artichoke thing and amaze yourself with the size of their prime rib.

Our maitre'd was fantastic - seated us with a smile, knew exactly what we needed with our specific reservations (it was a surprise dinner), helpful. And for the first 30 minutes or so things went well while we waited for our friends - our waitress Casey was nice enough to open our bottle of wine, to take our appetizer order.  Our friends arrived and things went downhill. Requests for extra plates were taken but never fulfilled. Our waitress didn't even remember to get one person's order and after bringing this to her attention, gave no apology as if we had just wanted extra time to figure out his order - is this supposed to be a commonly expected occurrence? With her reaction it sure seemed like it. Although most of the food was good (french dip, cheeseburger, ribs) with the fries being especially tasty, the rib eye gave our friends a chewy workout. When we finished I asked for a box for my leftovers. Considering the type of restaurant I was expecting her to take care of packing my leftovers. Instead she brought me a box to do myself... normally I wouldn't be so offended had she not made multiple mistakes earlier in the evening already and had we not been paying a good amount of dough to eat here. Coffee took about 15 minutes to come out (really?) and nobody ever came by to offer refills.  If the service is bad enough to overturn the lure of the beautiful ambience, the nicely balanced music, and the food, that's got to be pretty bad. I don't think I will ever feel inclined to return to a restaurant where I am given the opportunity to pay $40-50 for a meal with service that is to say the least, indifferent and cold.

Food is consistently amazing just like Los Altos Grill and Rutherford Grill, service was only OK, we had reservations and checked in early yet others who checked in later with a larger party got seated before our party of 2. My fiance finally had to say something about it. Crowded, definitely make reservations ahead of time.   We couldn't find our server throughout our meal, we finished our drinks AND our water and no one was around to either take a 2nd round of order or refill our water. Forgot to mention, I had to ask what the special of the day is! He didn't even introduce himself when he asked if we were ready to order.   We ordered a dessert to share with a few request and asked for it to be sent back because it came out wrong (we ordered the apple pie/crumble and had the ice cream on the side, not a big deal) but we saw that it was covered with caramel which was not described to us by the server (we wouldn't have ordered it if we knew it was drenched in caramel sauce). Then he suggested the brownie and he described it with NO mention of NUTS. If you're not going to have a dessert menu and your brownies have nuts in them - please make sure your servers emphasize which ones have nuts or potentially all of them may contain nuts! I was tired of sending stuff back or asking for things, so I ended up eating it since I'm not allergic but \u00a0come on - gluten free, allergies, vegans, it's so common especially in SF!",

The menu is brief, and in this case, the brevity is much appreciated. It's better to do a few things and to do them well.  Small Plates. I usually have the smoked salmon as my entree--it is so good, and you should know that I'm generally not a big fan of smoked salmon. The creme fraiche spread is so good, it's nutters. If you can only choose one small plate, choose the salmon. If you can do more than one, the artichoke is delicious. I also like the spinach dip.   Main Course (Lunch). Their French Dip might be the best one I've had. The only minor issue I have with it is that the meat is cooked medium rare, and sometimes the sandwich arrives a little too cold for my tastes. Other than that, it's pretty yummy. The horseradish aioli is a must--it's certainly way more important than the au jus. Many of my colleagues order the spicy chicken sandwich, which is cut into three, topped with avocado, and looks pretty appetizing. I've had a couple of the dinner entrees, but I feel like I haven't been here for dinner in so long that it would be unfair for me to opine about those dishes.   Wine, Beer &amp; Cocktails.

Well, because I work downwind and every day when I get off work the smoke from the grill comes my direction. \u00a0I begin to salivate uncontrollably and my mind becomes instantly delirious. \u00a0My friends have to hold me back otherwise I would run across the street and probably get hot by a bus. \u00a0Damn them!  Occasionally, when my friends and coworkers, cant hold me back I do run across 5 lanes of traffic and I stop in. \u00a0Everyone greets me with a smile. \u00a0  You can sit on the patio, at the large circular bar, or get a table. \u00a0Last night a trio was playing smooth jazz at the far end of the restaurant. \u00a0Over there right by the fireplace. \u00a0  My favorite dishes so far: the red trout. \u00a0Its a fillet of trout with paprika and its delicious. \u00a0Comes with a head of broccoli. \u00a0Its just so good. \u00a0No bones. \u00a0So light. \u00a0So good. \u00a0Did I mention it was soo goooood. \u00a0  They have several wines on tap but also a large wine list. Of course with no corkage, bring your own too. \u00a0  For desert, my favorite is the Sunday. \u00a0They use dark chocolate from TCHO down the street. \u00a0A big ball of vanilla ice cream. \u00a0Whip cream. \u00a0And pecans. \u00a0It is sooo good. \u00a0Do not even think of sharing this. \u00a0You were a hero today, you get it for yourself!",

    "review_text": "Last night, my girlfriend and I hopped into a cab. \u00a0All I wanted in the whole wide world was a grilled artichoke and some ribs. \u00a0\"Take us to Houston's!\", we cried.  The cab driver then politely informed us that the place that was Houston's is now called Hillstone's, and touched off in my life a crisis of Faith. \u00a0  Why would God allow Houston's to close? \u00a0I'm such a good person. \u00a0Why would He do this to me? \u00a0  I've never had a bad meal or anything short of exceptional service at Houston's. \u00a0It is one of my favorite places to relax with a solid meal, nice scenery, and pleasant company. \u00a0It always seems crowded, but never gets too loud to enjoy a good conversation. \u00a0Basically, it provides a great venue for the vast majority of occassions, and has been known to lift me out of a bad mood when I thought the sky was falling (how can the sky possibly be falling when these brussels sprouts are so good?).  Could the economy be to blame? \u00a0Because if it had been, I would have sponsored a personal bailout. \u00a0Houston's in my mind is like AIG: too big to fail. \u00a0The Titanic: unsinkable. \u00a0If only I had known, I would have hosted a bake-sale, found a way...  We decided to see for ourselves. \u00a0If Houston's had indeed closed, whatever replaced it would likely be at least a decent endeavour to afford that space, and obviously I was going to need massive amounts of wine to cope.  We walked up to the building. \u00a0The neon sign outside had changed, but the \"No Corkage Fee\" sign on the door upon which I've come so utterly to rely after trips to Livermore, Napa or Sonoma, was still firmly in place. \u00a0The hostess looked familiar. \u00a0And, importantly, it smelled like ribs.  Thank you, Jesus. \u00a0You are truly a merciful God.  The waitress explained that Houston's had long been owned by Hillstone Group, and that it had (along with the location in mid-town Manhattan) been promoted to a flagship site, and thus re-branded.  I'm all for promotions, especially in this instance.",

Pricey but the quality is consistently high. Btw, it used to be called Houston's but it's still the same restaurant (also same as Bandera), just with a different name. Same owners.   The/my \"usual\":  Spinach and artichoke dip is money. Fresh chips. Dip comes with sour cream and mild salsa. Odd combination but when you mix them all together (on your chip, not in a bowl) it's incredible.   Cheeseburger - always cooked exactly how you requested it which is a rare feat at restaurants these days. Cheddar sharp enough. Kaiser bun delicious. The elements are always fresh and you can really taste the quality.  I would recommend substituting the shoe string fries for spinach which comes al dente, seasoned just perfectly, and sprinkled with Parmesan chunks.   Also features outside seating patio which is very pleasant. Firepit.   The clientele is quite unique, which I really like. The atmosphere and the price of the dishes, to me, suggest a young professional/30-something/\"the marina\"-minus-the-douche-baggery crowd but I often find hipsters, regular old sports fans and families frequenting the joint.",

The venue was comfortable and homey with a live jazz band (which I actually didn't notice till my friend told me) as well as a fireplace. I thought the place had a nice set up (large comfortable booths, sturdy tables, nice lighting) but that the crowd was a bit more casually dressed than I had anticipated.   As for the food, I ordered the pork ribs with coleslaw and a fully loaded baked potato. The ribs were pretty good but half of them were a little burned and chewy for my liking. The baked potato in all of its sour cream, bacon, cheese, green onions and glory was delicious. The coleslaw was disregarded and I dived into my potato and some of my friends delicious french fries. He ordered the rib eye and upon sampling I agree that it was cooked perfectly and was very tender and tasty.   Overall the place was very good and I'd love to return again someday.",

Not too dry, and the marinade they used was tastey enough to outlast the slow cooking of the bird. The side that came with it was actually better than expected, the Dirty Orleans Rice. It was like a Mardi Gras rendition of Asain style fried rice. hmmmm. I liked it a lot. I also had a couple bites of the prime rib (wow) and the Pork BBQ Ribs (double-wow). I should have gotten the ribs. Meat that falls off the bone is hard to find in a restaurant these days.  To wash all of this down with, I had the house Merlot which wasn't bad for the house selection. I actually liked it, since I ordered a couple more glasses throughout dinner.

They had a really good location... parking on the street with meter was easy. it was a Saturday evening.

My husband and cousins started with a drink at the bar while we waited for our table to be ready.   we sat at a cosy booth and they had the little kiddle seat right in the middle. It was great. Tried the artichoke dip - YUMM.... had to try the hawaiin steak that everyone on Yelp was talking about... and it was YUM! the mash potatoes were good too! Also tried the fish of the day and it was well cooked and tasteful. I would agree that its on the pricier side, but $ wasn't an issue for my cousin from SJ who was treating us out... so glad we had an opportunity to try Hillstone out.   omg... forgot to mention... tried dessert: the brownie a la mode - Sooooo good. it was perfectly baked, not too rich, melted in your mouth and amazing balance with the ice cream.",

I overheard the host mention that they bake their own doggie treats, so if you're ever walking by in this neighborhood, stop in and ask for some!   I had the veggie burger, which seemed fairly home made and was very tasty. I'm usually more a fan of the \"tastes just like meat\" Boca-type veggie burger, but in this case the crumbly, textured patty really won me over. Fries with my burger, but these are the super thin cut fries I'm not a huge fan of. Next time I'll ask to see if they serve steak cuts.   Our waittress was really friendly and attentive. It's funny, but see if you're reminded of being in a Robert Palmer video when you see how the wait staff is dressed.",

However, this neighborhood has fairly inflated prices in general, so for a few more bucks than nearby Fog City Diner or Pier 23 you can have an excellent meal in a high-class establishment. \u00a0The food is GREAT. Anything from a \"simple\" ahi tuna salad or bean soup, to the famous french dip sandwich, ribs, are all beautifully presented and oh so tasty. The service is so friendly and professional all the time. They definitely train them well here! And the drinks at the bar are also nice, they have a good wine selection and nice service there too. They also have jazz most evenings (perhaps just weekend, not sure), and it makes for a great place to go on a romantic date or just for drinks with friends.",

Service is always great, the bar scene is chill, and the environment is warm, inviting and bustling with couples and groups of friends having a great time.

Three pieces of advice: Try the grilled artichoke appetizer, don't miss dessert (especially the warm five-nut brownie), and call ahead for a reservation on weekends (no OpenTable - this is old school).",

In addition to my own enjoyment, I have referred countless clients, industry associates &amp; family over the years. I have never had a bad meal, the consistency is simply amazing. I do have to say that the #1 reason I return over and over again is the team that provides such wonderful service. It starts with the welcome as the door opens but it is absolutely the team behind the bar. They are all exceptional. I have come to know quite a few of them personally and sadly it is time for several to move along. It started with Jillian disappearing, now Rachel :( \u00a0too many talents to mention!! Yoga  Diva (despite being published..continued on to be a pro) and Ben...:( All extremely talented and will be sorely missed. A few other Super Stars...Randy..always a breath of fresh air. Happy &amp; up beat..Always! Claudia...the Godess of dance...has returned and thank God!! An extreme delight. Exceptional in her service. Caitlynn and Joe are holding strong.... This group of young professionals and all their contemporaries that I do not have the pleasure of knowing are rare. I come from a corporate background. It is hard to miss the presence of a heavy handed corporate structure behind the scenes at Hilstone. Despite the energy at times...this team carries on without a hint of notice. They are true pros...consistently.  I do hope that the organization who built this wonderful chain of restaurants does not underestimate the talent pool that exisits. We live in a city where there is a wealth of good restaurants with great food. I cannot say in 25 years there is any place in the city I would rather revisit over and over again. The number one reason is because of the people who provide the service and the experience. !! Highly recommend!!",

    "review_text": "Hillstone SF blows all my previous 5-star reviews out of the water and puts them to complete and utter shame. What sets them apart from any restaurants I've ever been to is not the quality of food (don't get me wrong, I ain't complainin' at all!), but their impeccable service. The hub, best friend and I spent the last half hour of dinner thanking our servers, Brian and Michelle, for being incredibly good to us. We made sure to let them and their bosses know that they have completely won us over and we'll be coming back. On a regular basis, too. Like my hub says: \"I want to give them my money.\"  That's saying a lot because the three of us have impossibly high standards, especially when it comes to food and dining. You know 'those people' who always have a negative opinion about everything and analyzes--no, criticizes--everything down to the very last diminutive detail? Yeah, that's us. We are annoyingly hard to please.  Here are just a few examples of how Hillstone has done right by us so far:  1) One night I couldn't decide on a drink, so the bartender suggested something. It was gooood. After 4 of them I asked our waiter if it had a name. It didn't. So I recommended the name \"Trinity\" (gin, grapefruit, elderflower). A few weeks later I returned and asked for it by name, thinking they'd be clueless. Sure enough, the waitress returned with said drink. This shows how much Hillstone listens to their customers.  2) Last night the hub ordered the special, NY strip. It came out too charred on the outside and left a bitter taste to an otherwise perfect medium-rare. He was reluctant to place a complaint. Our waitress, Michelle, did not for one moment question him \u00a0or act and look inconvenienced. She was so incredibly gracious. So incredibly gracious.  3) Brian, who I assume is her supervisor, took the time to come by and apologize in an unobtrusive manner. He explained how the steak is prepared, which was rather unconventional and why it left a char, but reassured us that they'd try and prepare the steak as close as possible to what he desired. Listening to your guests without compromising the chef's vision and expertise? That's classy.  4) While there was some confusion regarding the bill, it was handled exceptionally well. When we called Michelle over to get some clarification, she already knew what to say and do.   5) They took the NY strip off the bill! Because to them, our loyalty to the restaurant is more important than a $44 steak. Of course we included the price of the steak in the tip we left. That was the only decent thing to do. It was a 30% tip that was well-deserved.  Needless to say, we left not just happy but amazed. And actually, a little inspired. All businesses--not just restaurants--can learn something from Hillstone SF. They operate like a well-oiled machine and the end-product keeps hard-to-please customers like me happy and loyal.",

The bread they use is truly a SOFT roll, in that its so soft and fresh that it will literally soak up the dip in an instant of 'dippage'.   Warm Five Nut Brownie-$8; Good sized brownie with vanilla ice cream-Very tasty. Very sweet. Not for the faint of heart.

I've been here a second time too in Aug 2009, dining before a jaunt to Mighty SF to get SALTED (see: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/events/san-francisco-miguel-migs-mesmerized-on-salted-saturdays-mighty-sf-08-08-09\">yelp.com/events/san-fran\u2026</a> ) with Househeads - Jesse and Denise (see: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=VjOo_y7NYxtt7iaOxXu8-w\">yelp.com/user_details?us\u2026</a> )  Food, Drinks, Service and Ambiance are always on par for this restaurant. \u00a0Yes, prices are up there but this is a great spot no doubt for business dinners or for out-of-towners looking for a great meal, service, and ambiance.   + Portions are generous. \u00a0 + Rib Eye = perfect + Prime Rib - Incroyable! \u00a0Better than the House of Prime Rib, Gullivers, etc... + Ribs Awesome. + Artichoke &amp; Spinach Dip = consistently decadent and sinful junk food + Crab Cakes - WOW + Desserts to die for!   I'll be back. I'm a fan!",

Cramping 8 people in a booth was pretty difficult so I was a bit unhappy about that.  I ordered the veggie burger and that bun that came with it was amazing!!!! The burger was mehh, wish it stayed together more.  Second experience coming here was definitely better. I ordered the Dungeness crab cakes and they were so damn good!! I love that it wasn't pan fried on both sides (bread on the one side that it was pan fried). It was basically full of crab meat! Just drooling thinking about it! My boyfriend ordered the baby back ribs are they literally just fell off the bone, a whole chunk of meat. It was incredible to see and my boyfriend enjoyed it way too much.  The ambiance here is amazing, i love the live music playing! Makes the food so much more enjoyable and tasty!  Had a great time and will definitely be back. Parking is always a breeze.",

The salmon is smoked but it is really more like cooked salmon then the smoked salmon traditionally eaten on a bagel. It is moist and oily and the flavor is delicious!  Unfortunately the service barely gets two stars. I am a local and come here fairly frequently. \u00a0The service, provided by bored but beautifully-coiffed teenage girls is consistently lacking.  Expect to have to search out your waitress (or someone else) for anything, including getting your water refilled and paying your check.  Getting your check is another story.

My wife had the baby back ribs and she was happy. I snuck in a rib onto my plate and became very envious but I quickly turned my attention to my hawaiian rib eye. I ordered my steak medium/rare and it was cooked to perfections. It was seared on the outside locking in the juices and the flavors were outstanding. I appreciated that the steak had a hawaiian flavor to it without having a thick glaze or sauce. The mashed potatoes and asparagus complimented the steak well.  I love to try new restaurants and I recommend this place 100%. There are so many places to choose from in SF but next time we go back we are definitely stopping by Hillstone.",

We sat at the bar. \u00a0Service was excellent, waitresses/bartenders were very pleasant and helpful, although they don't explain much on the menu unless you ask specifically (like the couscous... it wasn't explained that it was more than just couscous).   Drink/bar menu is fantastic... lots of choices and variety in the brands of the liquor and spirits. \u00a0Water is chilled in bottles in fridge, which is very nice and a favorite point of many of my top restaurant choices.  Food was quite good. \u00a0My husband ordered the French dip sandwich and it was amazing, done perfectly and melts in your mouth. \u00a0He ordered the mashed potato side and they were very good too.  I wanted to do a bit of mix match, so I did a couple of apps/sides... the spinach/artichoke dip and couscous. The Spinach &amp; artichoke dip was really good but I didn't like the chips it came with... I prefer pita or breads of some sort... I actually asked if they had bread or if I could do a side of bread and all I could get was the focaccia bread and olive plate... so I had to spend a bit more getting this additional app, wish they could have accommodated a bit with the bread... the bread was very good though and the assortment of olives/peppers were great... just became too much food with that additional add, since I had done the couscous too. \u00a0The couscous, from what I could tell, changes daily. \u00a0The one I had was very yummy but not what I was expecting... it was served as a cold dish with mint, lemon, raisins, and a lot of other ingredients. \u00a0It was really good, just not what I was expecting.  Only low point, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as you do pay for good food, but it can be a splurge, it was a pretty big lunch bill. \u00a0Prices don't vary too much from lunch to dinner.",
