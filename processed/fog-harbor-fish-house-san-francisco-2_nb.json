We were going to eat at 2 separate places for the items, but found this place served both and had good reviews so we went here instead.   We started with the clam chowder in a bread bowl and the crab cake risotto fritters. The clam chowder was delicious, best I've tried. As someone stated in the tips below, just get the soup because they serve bread and butter for free, so our bread bowl was pretty much left un-eaten. The crab cake fritters were amazing as well. It was so much food so we shared the fish and chips. Fries were good, but the fish was underwhelming. The fish itself was flaky and light but the batter was unseasoned and made the whole thing just bland. I didn't care for the tarter sauce or cole slaw either.   Overall, pretty good! I'd come back just for the clam chowder.",

These were slightly disappointing, was hoping for crispy hot fritters and received this lukewarm, kind of soggy conglomeration of crab and risotto. Also got a moscow mule and bowl of cioppino - the moscow mule was standard (a little weak), and this was my first venture into ordering cioppino, after tasting others' at different restaurants and really liking it. This one was very solid in quantity of seafood, with lots of crab, scallops, shrimp, clams and mussels, which made it a delight to eat. However, I think the seafood might have been cooking a little too long, because the scallops were near disintegrating and the crab tasted straight up like the broth. So, the seafood was fresh and plentiful, but the seafood all tasted the same, as if it had been boiling in the broth together for a long time. Shrimp and mussels were the highlight, they seemed to be have cooked properly and still had some firmness. The broth was simple and tasted like tomato soup, though some salt and pepper brought out the flavors well. Also, wanted more than a small sliver of garlic bread! Waitstaff was friendly.  Overall, very much enjoyed the meal, but there were a few things that stood out as pieces that could easily be improved upon.",

No worries, we ordered some other dishes, and waited for our food. \u00a0And we waited, and waited, and waited.... After 40 minutes our server told us that the chef had made a mistake - I had ordered a gluten free dish, and the chef made prepared it improperly. \u00a0So I had the server bring the rest of the dishes and sat there and watched my family eat for 15 more minutes while they made my dish.  Finally, after almost an hour, I got my tuna. \u00a0Admittedly, it was pretty tasty... but by that point I was hungry and in a bad mood, so anything would have tasted good.   For our trouble, the manager offered us 30% off during our next visit. \u00a0When I told him I was in the military and we were moving overseas and we wouldn't be back, he simply said, \"Okay, well, we'd still love to have you back.\" \u00a0Didn't offer to take care of our appetizers or take the 30% off of our bill that day... would have been a nice gesture. \u00a0  The view is nice, the food is above average, but the service is terrible. \u00a0Wouldn't go back even if we weren't moving.",

The waiter had a really thick accent which made it impossible to understand him over all the noise. Once he got orders it took him 15 min to bring us some bread which I was dying for! and then about a minute later he brought the food, which was quick considering the amount of people there.

Through the open door to their back room I could see their ops schedule - very impressive whiteboard with names and rows. And the service lined up with that. Everything was quick, and no mistakes.   I also noticed that the restaurant was determined to get reviews. Case and point: I got a free appetizer for checking in and a free desert for giving a quick review (note that it was a review on their website. My yelp reviews can't be purchased with a desert or anything else!)   The food was good, hot, and came out quickly. It just wasn't that unique; it didn't have a chef's touch, which is the primary reason for my 4 rating. But I did enjoy the experience and would certainly go back.",

We were seated and asked our server for recommendations. \u00a0We ended up with:  \u00a0- Goat cheese garlic bread: very rich in flavor (goat cheese mostly) but crispy and warm.  \u00a0- Crab cocktail: it's crab season so the crab tasted extra fresh. \u00a0Perfectly chilled and served with traditional cocktail sauce.  \u00a0- Menu special, Scallops: this was okay. \u00a0It was served with a quinoa salad but there was a bit too much balsamic vinegar to appreciate the taste of the scallop.  \u00a0- Seafood platter for 1: served with crab, shrimp, mussels, and clams in a butter herb sauce. \u00a0We were disappointed with this. \u00a0The food was lukewarm, at best, and there was so much butter it drowned the taste of the seafood. \u00a0Since we came here with high seafood expectations, this is the reason for my mid-scoring review.  All in all the experience was just okay; nothing spectacular or fancy. \u00a0Our server gave us this card to text in a review of the restaurant, with a promise of a complimentary dessert at the end of the meal. \u00a0Well, I took the survey. \u00a0But I guess they have no way to monitor who takes the survey from each table? \u00a0I didn't bring it to her attention, as I wasn't really in the mood for dessert, but for a promotion that's supposed to gauge a customer's experience with a promise of a small reward at completion, I would think they could track better. \u00a0But again, this wasn't a make or break for my opinion.",

My bf and I went there last night to celebrate our anniversary. \u00a0Granted we weren't looking for anything too fancy or high maintenance. \u00a0After we were seated it was close to 15 mins. until anyone came by, so we sat there with no water or anything. \u00a0When the waitress came she was abrupt and pretty rude. \u00a0We ordered our wine and the oyster appetizers. \u00a0The oysters were small and I've had better quality at the super market.  For dinner my bf ordered the rib eye and I had the seared prawns over linguine with the house salad to start. \u00a0When the salad came it was WILTED spring mix, two cherry tomatoes, one slice each of red onion and cucumber, and super stale croutons. \u00a0The food took a long time after that. \u00a0The steak was ok, nothing special and my pasta tasted worst then a noodle roni dinner. \u00a0I've had much better frozen food from Trader Joes.

    "review_text": "Came here with my friend to celebrate my birthday two nights ago. I'd been craving clam chowder for over a week and I wanted to see if this place really had the \"best clam chowder in SF\".  I booked a reservation for 6:15 and called to change it to 6:45 and the lady on the phone was fairly accommodating and friendly. When we arrived, we were immediately seated at a table by the window (probably because I had mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday on our reservation) with a spectacular view of Alcatraz and the seals! Our amazing waiter, David, came by and introduced us to some special dishes on the menu. He also knew it was my birthday and told me they would prepare a chocolate dessert for us. When he came back with our drinks, we just ordered two bread bowls (we weren't crazy hungry because had sundaes two hours earlier). I knew about the Yelp check-in offer for the free appetizer but didn't now it only came with an order of an entree, but David was so kind and said he would bring us one out because it was my birthday.   The bread bowls were fairly large and definitely met our expectations. It was presented nicely (it wasn't messy like most bread bowls we order from other places) and not too salty or bland. Perfectly creamy. Had a lot of clams and potatoes too. Clam chowder is my favorite soup (and arguably one of my favorite foods in general) and I'd have to say this was the best I've ever had. Our only complaint would be there wasn't enough soup. The actual bread the soup came in was HUGE, but I'd say there was only about two cups of soup in the actual bread bowl. I was alright though (my friend was still a bit hungry but luckily we had our free appetizer!) because I was stuffed when I finished. I couldn't even finish the bread!   Our waiter came by many times to ask us how our dishes were and how we were doing and even sang me happy birthday when he brought us our free chocolate dessert! The chocolate cake was a bit too sweet but it was extremely rich and went well with the scoop of vanilla ice cream next to it.   Our bill only came to about $24 only because we had ordered two bread bowls, but it was amazing considering the fact that we got a free appetizer and dessert.  OVERALL: Clam chowder bread bowls - Best I've ever had and I'm a local! Not too salty and not too bland either. Only wish there was more soup and it was less pricey.  Blue cheese bread appetizer - I love garlic bread and I love cheesy bread but this wasn't that good. I've never really liked the taste of blue cheese so this definitely wasn't my favorite. But it won't hurt to get it for free if you check in on yelp!  Service - absolutely amazing. The waiters were all extremely nice, especially David.   Ambiance/View - has one of the best views of Pier 39. If you happen to get a seat on the left of the restaurant by the Bay, you'll be able to see Alcatraz and the area where the seals are. I specifically chose a reservation right before sunset and the view of the water was breathtaking. If it's too sunny they have blinds they'll be happy to pull down (or up) for you. Restaurant wasn't too loud and the restaurant was pretty busy (esp. for a Wednesday night).   **they'll also validate your parking ticket for up to 4 hours if you came by car  I'll definitely be coming back again!",

Once I salted it, it was good. \u00a0Unfortunately the shrimp was bland and badly needed the cocktail sauce. \u00a0The coleslaw was bland and taste like just cabbage &amp; mayo.

It turned out to be serendipitous. \u00a0We live in the North Bay and come to the City often. When it comes to restaurants, we are nothing but a bit jaded. That said, we had a splendid meal at Fog Harbor. Instead of a main course, we ordered several items listed as starters because that gives exposure to more dishes especially when there are only the two of us dining.  We started with the fried calamari which was served with a lemon aioli for dipping. The dish was all rings, no tentacles. The batter was light, something like you would expect to find in a very good tempura bar. We also had the sliders, the crab cakes and the red curry mussels.  The sliders were great. Cooked perfectly (medium rare) and smothered in caramelized onions. My wife loves crab cakes and pronounced them as good as any she has ever had. I'm not much of a crab cake lover, but I thought they were good. I will never love crab cakes, so don't take my word as gospel.  Then I had the red curry steamed mussels. I am a mussel fanatic. I've eaten them over half the world, particularly in Belgium (where mussels is the national dish), and I can honestly say that these are the most delicious steamed mussels I have ever had. These are not the red curry mussels you will find in Thai restaurants. You are going to have to try them to see what I mean. By the way, although listed as a starter, there were enough for a main dish, especially when accompanied by Fog Harbor's terrific sourdough bread which is made on site.  I asked the restaurant manager for the mussels recipe, but he couldn't comply. I then emailed the company and was sent the recipe by one of the senior execs. That is service above and beyond.  By the way, we were there during happy hour, and were able to enjoy a very good house Pinot Grigio for $5/glass - an added bonus.  Fog Harbor is located at Pier 39, a venue most locals associate with tourists and would not normally think of as a place to go for fine dining. Wrong. \u00a0Fog Harbor is considerably better than most of the famous places in the Fisherman's wharf vicinity. To make matters even better, with the appropriate coupon (available everywhere in the City) you can park free, a huge benefit in San Francisco where parking fees are equivalent to winnings in the Powerball lottery.",

We were seated promptly and offered waters right away. Our server (totally bummed that I can't remember his name) was great. He was polite, prompt, helpful and courteous. We ordered:  2 cups of chowder - chowder was just okay. Not to thick, not to thin, just lacked flavor.  We also had the special appetizer, crab &amp; risotto balls. These were tasty, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Our server suggested these over the crab cake. \u00a0  Lastly we split a crab salad sandwich with sweet potato fries. This was nice but not out of this world great.   Overall the restaurant is lovely with gorgeous views especially on a clear beautiful day. Service was top notch. The missing star is for the food. Although good, I think it could be a bit more flavorful.   4 stars along for the fact that they validate for the garage across the street. Saved me over $20!  I love the City and this is a nice place among the touristy trap terrible restaurants on Pier 39. \u00a0It's worth a try just for the validation!",

For a party of three on a Sunday, the wait was minimal which was a plus.   For the food, my table ordered the seafood cioppino, seafood penne, fried calamari appetizer and the Moscow mule. Seafood cioppino was above average. More of a soupy tomato cioppino vs a stew like many places. Generous helpings of properly cooked mussels, clams, crab, scallops, shrimp and fish. Just wish the flavor was a bit stronger instead of resembling a tomato based seafood linguine. I'd say sotto mare was better. The seafood penne was very well done. Fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was perfect, paired extremely well with the sourdough bread which was some of the best I've ever had. Soft center and flaky crust with chew. The calamari was well fried and flavorful, but the lemon aioli was very plain. The Moscow mule was watered down like crazy and might as well have been ginger ale mixed with water.   The service for this restaurant was disappointing considering its a tourist trap. My server failed to give me plate/silverware, bread and water refills requires multiple requests and drink came 15 minutes late. Expected a lot more and there wasn't even an apology for lack of plate and utensils.   I would probably not return based on the overall dining experience but the food was definitely some of the best of pier 39.",

The hostess seated us at our reservation time to the minute, and we had a great window seat looking directly out on the pier, the Rock, and the beautiful bridge. \u00a0Our server Barry was excellent; he was friendly and attentive without hovering, and he got everything right the first time with no hesitation. \u00a0I think I overheard him say that he just moved to San Francisco. \u00a0I mention this because it sounded like he was trying to play down a heavy British accent - don't you know us American girls (well, at least me and my mom) love that sort of thing?!  All of our dishes and drinks came out perfectly. \u00a0We had an appetizer from the specials list - the Dungeness crab and spinach dip - which was delicious, and mom had the \"Escape from Alcatraz\" cocktail, which she loved. \u00a0I had the Gewurztraminer, which is impossible to get by the glass in Florida, so I was thrilled. \u00a0For the main dish, I had the Halibut special with quinoa, pine nuts, and arugula, and mom had the garlic whole Dungeness crab. \u00a0Both of our dishes were wonderful - perfectly cooked and seasoned, and everything was obviously fresh and carefully prepared.  The meal wasn't too expensive, and certainly worth the price both for the quality and the volume of food we received. \u00a0It is definitely a worthwhile spot to relax, refresh, and refuel while seeing the sights!",

I chose the steamed method with just saut\u00e9ed vegetables. If you enjoy the inside of the crab, let your waiter know that you would like them to steam it whole and not to break it open and clean it out. The best part of the crab is inside. It reminds me of crab bisque. Grab a spoon and dig in! A tip to the kitchen: if someone orders it like this, serve it with the legs up and do not crack open the body shell so the \"soup\" doesn't drain out. You can also dip your crab meat into it for a luxurious flavor. The drawn butter is good too just like with snow or king crab legs. The crab was steamed to perfection and the meat is sweet and juicy. Fog Harbor receives crab deliveries every day, freshly caught off the California coast, transported in ocean water filled tanks, held until you order it up. You can't get anything fresher than that! The vegetables were saut\u00e9ed to perfection -crisp with a wonderful butter flavor. Add a little salt and pepper and you're good to go. Thumbs up, way up!",

Before anything, Jennifer A.'s tip caught my eye: \"First, go to the visitor's center also on the upper level and get a 15% off coupon for this place.\"  Despite its touristy location, Fog Harbor delivered a DAT meal that was surprisingly delicious and affordable. I would definitely recommend making a reservation through OpenTable because it was packed on a Saturday evening.  Our table was started off with complimentary sourdough bread and butter, which is always appreciated.  For the appetizer, I opted for the AHI TUNA POKE, which is marinated raw tuna, avocado, mango, and a sesame-soy sauce and wasabi aioli (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Y5MO3qA68Z4v6MvKgGl9ZQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). It's normally $16 for their full serving, though we only got a poke pile rather than the poke slices shown in other pictures. The tuna is decently fresh, the mango is refreshing (though not very ripe), the avocado is smooth (also not very ripe), and the aioli ties it all together.  My friend chose the BAKED OYSTERS as her appetizer, which came with 4 fresh shucked oysters topped with spinach, bacon and a creamy parmesan sauce (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). Each oyster is normally $2.50, and she enjoyed the rich flavor of each one.  For entrees, one friend decided on the SEAFOOD CIOPPINO, which is crab, fresh fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels stewed in a tomato herb broth served with pasta (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#2AAhYWe5iBS33VciM-7V5g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). It's a hefty portion normally priced at $30! She said that her favorite part of the dish was the crab. Her boyfriend ordered the CREEKSTONE NY STEAK, a 10 oz steak grilled and topped with whisky peppercorn sauce, served with garlic mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed vegetables (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#3MgOxfwSYmu_cBpmwqcQnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). It was also a generous portion, normally priced at $27.  I chose the GRILLED SALMON, a fillet served on a bed of roasted corn, arugula, red peppers, fingerling potatoes, and tarragon with a citrus beurre blanc (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Of8IrIHQdLcfmBdpixj99A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). Normally $28, the salmon dish is worth it. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and moist the salmon meat was, especially given how often I've been underwhelmed by salmon dishes. But, goshdangit, Fog Harbor did it right. *snaps*  As our desserts, we each ordered something different:  The VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE, a smooth, creamy custard with caramelized sugar top and a Biscoff cookie, normally $8.50 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#n77J_bT5cjGss76X1FdSPw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). My favorite, hands down. I tend to avoid cr\u00e8me brulees because past ones I've tried have had sugar tops that were way too thick and overpoweringly sweet and sticky. But the sugar coating is delicate, allowing the custard to really shine through. If you're a fan of egg custard, especially subtly sweet custard, you'll be a fan of their cr\u00e8me brulee.  The MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE with a rich creamy chocolate center, served warm with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, normally $8.50 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#W-e5gxE978hMPMfp1k7nDA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). Many reviewers have complained that this isn't a true molten cake because the inside doesn't ooze melted chocolate, and I would have to agree--it's just a warm, gooey chocolate center. The vanilla bean ice cream is tasty, and I liked that the chocolate cake wasn't overly rich since it paired well with light, fluffy whipped cream.  The CHOCOLATE BANANA BREAD PUDDING, a huge square of Fresh Boudin's sourdough bread baked with chocolate pudding, served warm with cr\u00e8me anglaise and vanilla ice cream (most similar to the pumpkin bread pudding, normally $8.50) (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dYa4c4vsHCPEF7PxSyRxjQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). I asked for the cr\u00e8me on the side because I didn't want it to soak the bread (not a huge fan of soggy bread). The cr\u00e8me itself is very light and was fun to dip, and the banana and sourdough undertones make for an intriguing combination. However, the chocolate is so rich that it overwhelmed even my sweet tooth...ridic.  All in all, I would recommend the GRILLED SALMON entree and the VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE dessert. Don't forget the 15% coupon!",

I am a huge seafood person and so I know the difference between good and bad seafood. The waiter offered a new tuna steak, but I had better at many other places and it was not worth the money.   My boyfriend's pasta was good and so were the crab cakes, but I believe that for a 4 or 5 star rating a restaurant that is a seafood place would have all of its seafood at a high standard.   I would recommend the restaurant and I would go back myself, but order the pasta or crab cakes or something that is fully cooked.",

We decided to sit at the bar instead of waiting for a table. Our bartender/server was very rude. I am not sure if she was having a bad day or what but working with the public she needs to work on her people skills.   We put in our food orders and beer. After we got our beers we were delivered fresh warm sourdough bread. The bread was what dreams are made out of. I knew this place had promise.  Our food came out in a decent amount of time. Meaning I still had one slice of bread let to enjoy with my meal. The greedy monster didn't completely come out. I ordered the salmon club salad and it was good. I was surprised not to be asked how I wanted my salmon cooked as I normally order it rare. It was tasty but not worth the cost.  My husband ordered the fried combo that included fried fish, calamari and shrimp. I had a taste of the fish and calamari which was decent. However my husband wouldn't part with the shrimp because they only gave him two. Wtf??? The two sides were the traditional fries and coleslaw.   Overall the food was decent but seemed overprice. I guess not overpriced per the location but I would considered a bread bowl at boudin or a food truck next time.",

We also have a baby but she doesn't need a highchair (baby's 6 months and was in her stroller). Denise then proceeds to tell me \"oh, well it's a longer wait then...it's kind of an inconvenience to be honest for us to have highchairs and strollers in here.\" At that point, my father heard Denise, and said \"umm..okay, we won't eat here then.\" Without apologizing or ANYTHING, she just didn't say anything and started talking to her coworker next to her. She was so rude and disrespectful I couldn't believe. I then asked to speak with a manager who didn't know her left from right.

So when I tried Fog Harbor at the Yelpin' La Vida Loca Party, the Crab Ceviche, the Ahi Tuna - I wanted to come back. I received a coupon for a free appetizer with dinner at the Yelp event, but it was the food that kept me thinking about trying it out. After having a touristy boat ride on the Bay, me and my friend went over to Pier 39 for an early dinner.  Don't be fooled by the novelty of the Pier, Fog Harbor is a nice classic seafood restaurant. Nice big booths with great views of the bay to Golden Gate Bridge. \u00a0The place is huge and would be ideal for a Holiday Party, dinner party or event. They have a nice big bar that serves up anything you want, although they have quite a few custom cocktails.  I ordered myself a Bloody Mary, I can appreciate a good bloody mary outside of normal brunching hours, especially if I'm enjoying some seafood. \u00a0Since we were going for the full tasting experience, we ordered the:   *Ahi Tuna on a fried wonton and Cajun seared with cayenne aioli \u00a0~Absolutely delicious. I tried this at the yelp event and had to order it again. *Red Chili Garlic Prawns: Red chili paste, onions, peppers and garlic ~Spicy and so good, the sauce and peppers had so much flavor, I added a couple spoonfuls to my bloody mary. Yeah, it's THAT good. *Garlic Roasted Crab: Roasted 1/2 crab with a garlic herb butter ~At $15.00, I could eat this every night. Served with hot butter, I sat there happily cracking my crab and tasting every bit of that garlicky buttery goodness. If you need a crab fix, I highly recommend this dish.  *Salmon BLT: Served on a toasted french roll with a pesto aioli. ~ Really great, probably one of the best salmon sandwiches I've had. You know that feeling when you take a bite of someone's sandwich and you want more. If I wasn't so entertained cracking my crab, I'd be all over this sandwich.   When they came up with the dessert platter, I didn't know if I could possibly do it...but there was the cr\u00e8me brulee. Just tempting me. It was just as good as expected, creamy with that sugar glazed candy crunch top. \u00a0I had my dessert with an Absolute Lemonade cocktail, very refreshing.   I really enjoyed my dinner at Fog Harbor and will definitely come back. \u00a0The service was excellent, the food was incredible, affordable for the quality and the whole overall experience was worth coming down to the pier to try out. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!",

After a quick glance at all the menus, we finally decided on Fog Harbor Fish House.   The menu is pretty pricey, but the food is pretty good. Fresh warm sourdough bread was complimentary, which was surprisingly delicious (Note: I am a sourdough snob).  We ordered the following: beet and blue cheese salad, california crab and avocado caesar salad, the soup and salad combo (caesar salad and a clam chowder bread bowl), and the crab roll. Didn't get a chance to try dessert, but the dessert tray they had looked amazing!   Great views of the Bay and the seals!",

OMG we could actually have a conversation without shouting, and it felt really clean. We are locals, so exploring new (tourist? oh my!) 'hoods has become a weekend adventure. We were drawn to the outdoor coctail area, and will now count it as a must for out of town guests' breakfast, as well as ours. \u00a0Yep, you can have an Irish Coffee for breakfast! Good place to rest feet and have a drink, too, if enjoying the waterfront area. We will try it for other meals as well. Parking across the street at the grungy Pier 39 garage. It's a quick walk over the pedestrian bridge to the restaurant. \u00a0Ask the server to validate your parking ticket.",

After waiting 30 minutes we were brought to a very nice dinning room area that overlooked the water. Ordering the calamari to start with a coupon that is provided by the visitors center and to eat my son got the Mac and cheese, my wife got a custom designed linguine with garlic crab dish and I ordered the crab ceviche (avocado, mango and fresh pulled crab meat).  The calamari came and I was worried about the other items we ordered. It was not awful, but tasted like any other frozen squid with breading and very little seasoning which was a little over fried. I even sampled the \"aioli\" which is really become just a new way for a restaurant to put mayo in a ramekin and call it something cooler. That being said it did not help much and I was not looking forward to the meal.  Then the waitress came with a basket filled with sourdough bread and it was exceptional. Did not ask for it, but the timing was perfect and just as we enjoyed our first piece the good bread... The food arrived-  My ceviche was amazing! The quality of the seafood is evident on the first bite and I felt like the combination of flavors that was more than I expected. The avocado was very flavorful and the mango was such a mild taste that all together it was a perfect mix. I cannot say anything bad about this dish except it was an appetizer and wish I ordered two.  The linguine was cooked with garlic, sun dried tomatoes, spinach and garlic crab meat. It was actually from the chicken penne pasta sub crab and linguine. This was a great way to try some fresh crab meat and the way it was pulled and placed on top of the pasta you could have some crab in every bite. The sun dried tomatoes played a great supporting role of adding color and a great finish to every few bites that were lucky enough to have some in it.  Lastly was my sons Mac and cheese. I never find it worthy of saying much about kid items, but this macaroni and cheese was gourmet and the steamed broccoli about as fresh tasting as can be.  This was a great final bite on our visit to San Fran! We will be back!!!",

Tip: to get to Pier 39 from Caltrain, just walk to the BART track, pay $2.00 and ride it to Embarcadero. Then get off and walk to the F Street car, pay $2.00. Your other option is to cab there for $12.50 each way.  On to Fog Harbor Fish House:  Good value for large parties.  We did the prix fixe, \u00a0for starters every four people were served a platter of yummy calamari perfectly deep fried, cheese toast with fine blue cheese and a small plate of prawns sauteed in a spicy hot marinara (V. good). Next, you get a salad of a few leaves of high quality romaine lettuce with creamy blue cheese or, you can have a white clam chowder. The main entree is either salmon, new york steak, or braised chicken, comes with sauteed zucchini's and pearl onion. Mashed potato's and a dessert of lava cake or tiramisu. $38.00  I had the NY steak, cooked medium, it was tastey, if a bit skinny at 1/2 inch thick cooked. \u00a0The excellent romaine salad comes with four pieces of lettuce with a creamy blue cheese dressing; it was perfection. The mashed potatoes and sauteed zucchini were ok. \u00a0  For dessert, I chose their lava cake: it was very chocolately,&amp; moist n' sweet on the inside; it was served with a side of vanilla ice cream drizzled with more chocolate. A sprig of mint leaf added to the sensation.  My friend had the salmon and it looked phat, well over an inch, about 6 inches by 6 inches. She said it was delicious.  Their coffee was very good: black and delicious.   Decent appetizers, entrees and desserts. I just figure you are paying a very reasonable $33.00 for the food and $5.00 for an excellent water front view, fine linen and silverware. I had to ask for my coffee to get refilled. Ditto for water.  Bathrooms: clean and modern.  Customer service: a bit slow.  Ambience: very nice, trad. American.  Tip: from the BART at Embarcadero, walk upstairs and look for the train tracks and hop on the F Street Car, to Pier 39. Just $2.00  Tip: due to the deluge, we cabbed from Pier 39 to CalTrain at King/4th, it was $12.50 without tip.",

To start, we had the crab cake, clam chowder, and a salad. \u00a0The cake's consistency was perfect--dense with crab meat, lightly seared, accompanied with a red pepper aioli. \u00a0The clam chowder was thick, rich and..well...clammy (in a good way), and my boyfriend said the sourdough bread was divine. \u00a0I was bummed to hear that they were out of baby spinach...but the portion of romaine more than compensated for this.   We chose the whole dungeness crab for our entrees. \u00a0Ladies, if you're wearing a nice outfit, I'd opt for a different dish instead of this messy treat. \u00a0The seafood cioppono looked tasty, as did some of the cuts of meat. \u00a0We were bibbed for the big event and spent a good 15 minutes hacking away at the shells prior to digging in (our plan of attack: \u00a0shell all the meat before feasting). \u00a0The waitstaff kept our area clean, even as the shards of shell flew around us. \u00a0  I wish that there had been more veggies on the plate, and the potatoes were a little runny for my taste. \u00a0We spent a good two hours enjoying our meals and each others company, never once feeling rushed to leave. \u00a0It was a good, solid meal for to conclude our adventure in San Fran. \u00a0My senses are piqued and I'm eager to return to the Wharf for more fruits of the sea.",

I ordered a nojito (since I cant drink) while hubs ordered their cucumber gimlet drink. \u00a0they were both really good. \u00a0for apps we shared crab cake--crab cake was good but the salad that came with it was warm and soggy. for entree hubs ordered a filet mignon (med well) with mixed veggies while I ordered their seafood plate. \u00a0filet mignon was too rare for my husband so although he ate it, he didn't enjoy it. \u00a0the squash with his veggie mix weren't that great either. \u00a0my seafood plate on the other hand was good... not too much seasoning and the seafood weren't overcooked. for dessert, we ordered the molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. \u00a0it was a bit disappointing. \u00a0the cake needed to have melted chocolate and the vanilla ice cream tasted weird...more like imitation vanilla with some alcohol. I also thought the fake dessert sample plate that they show you instead of the dessert menu was a bit tacky for a pricier restaurant.  the service was good... food was hit or miss.",

The friend that I went there with and I are still trying to figure stuff out with her bank because she double charged her and then charged me for my half as well. She also NEVER refilled my drinks and I always had to ask for more water from someone that seemed like the manager.  I got the fish and chips and she got the half garlic crab. It was good, but there was hardly any meat in the crab for the price. I guess it is expected for a touristy place.  Probably wouldn't go here again. THere are amazing places to eat in the city and I would just avoid this place for another down the street or a uber ride away!",

So now months later, a friend of mine who moved from NY to CA is traveling from Fresno to SF. \u00a0I suggested that we go to pier39 and meet up with a couple of our other friends. \u00a0Now here comes the \"bad experience\" part. \u00a0  We ordered Clam chowders, Fish and Lobster. \u00a0Well, I did order the Lobster because it was so good the last time we were here. \u00a0Wrong choice. \u00a0It was the saltiest Lobster ever! \u00a0Why not just give me pure rock salt and charge me $32 at that! Im not kidding it is real salty. \u00a0To top it off, our waiter didn't even bother refilling our water. \u00a0Well, I know some of us didn't order any drinks and just water but can't you even bother ASK if we want our glasses refilled. \u00a0After all you're still getting 18% \u00a0or $35++ in tips. \u00a03.5% health fee is $6.88. \u00a0WTH is that for when you gave me salty lobster and no water refill. \u00a0Now, I always ask the waiter to leave the little desert menu wherever I go as I have the tendency to change my mind about getting a desert afterward. \u00a0He didn't even bother. \u00a0Oh and did I tell you that I was still munching on my french fries when he took the plate right then and there.  So far, this has been my WORST experience in a restaurant ever. \u00a0I will NEVER go back and I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone ever! \u00a0At the end of the night we ended up paying well under $300 for lousy service and bad food. What's funny is at the receipt there is an option for Additional Tip even after they put in 18%. \u00a0Never again.",

I have to admit that my meal at Fog Harbor Fish House was just as tasty as some of the local hotspots i\"ve tried. And the view of the pier was also quite lovely.  Our waiter was eager to please and when he thought he had mixed up my wine with a colleague's wine I thought he was going to have a slight heart attack. He apologized about 80 times and bought us some delish chocolate banana bread pudding (yuummm) for dessert. \u00a0We didn't even care about the mixup, but we're never ones to say no to free dessert.  However, before dessert comes apps and entrees. For apps we ordered the crab ceviche and shrimp cocktail. The crab ceviche itself was pretty tasty, but they were pretty skimpy with the chips that came with it. 4 total chips for our group of 5! The shrimp cocktail were a bit wimpy looking, especially for SF where I've had some incredible seafood, but they still tasted good.  My entree was incredible. I ordered off the special menu for the night. Pesto halibut that came with mozzarella cheese, figs and some other delicious goodies on the side. \u00a0This was the best fish I remember enjoying in a long time. Hopefully they'll be adding it to their main menu!  I'd definitely go back during my frequent trips to SF and may even drag some local friends with me next time!",

Fried Calamari: I was disappointed that there were no tentacles. They were cooked properly but the breading was unimaginative. Not bad but not great.  Blue Cheese Bread: very rich and delicious.  Most of us ordered some fried seafood. I had the combo and others had the fish &amp; chips. The fried fish is excellent: beer battered, tender and juicy. I also really enjoyed the fried shrimp. They were butterflied and cooked perfectly with a nice panko coating. The disappointing thing was that I only got one piece of fish and two shrimp and a big pile of calamari. The fries were standard.  My brother ordered the Cioppino. I got to taste it and it was very good. I've had lots of cioppino since moving to the area and I'd say this is one of the best around.  To sum up: I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a good meal on Pier 39. Skip the calamari and the fried seafood combo (because of the calamari) but try the fish &amp; chips, shrimp &amp; chips, or the cioppino which were all excellent.",

The crab cakes were okay, although nice and crispy on the outside. The mashed potatoes were blah -- seemed obviously from \u00a0a box and could have used a healthy does of garlic. My husband enjoyed his fried platter, although he said it was hard to tell the difference between each seafood item's taste. My friend enjoyed her fried calamari, saying she could still taste the fish in spite of the fried exterior.

I ordered a clam chowder cup to start, a dungeness crab roll for my entree, and a blondie for dessert.

It was perfectly cooked, moist but rather tasteless. Halibut is a fish that can soak up sauces and be flavored as the chef determines. This was just cooked with a few tomatoes on top and some quinoa underneath neither of which added any taste. When we told the waitress that we had had better halibut she was quite nice about it and a minute or two later the matre de was at our table asking what we didn't like about the halibut. We told him, he thanked us for our feedback, adding that usually the halibut is the most praised item on the menu, and comped us a dessert of our choice. The service, the setting, the experience were all fine and would have been perfect if not for the main dish. We would go back and try a different item except there are so many other seafood restaurants we want to try first.",

The hot and fresh sourdough bread was also nice and came out early on.   Only mild complaint was the food took a bit longer than expected considering what we ordered but to be fair the place was packed the entire time we were there.   If you can get, or are willing to wait for, a seat closer to the window you've got quite the view of the sea lions, definitely a nice touch.

The service at the place has gone down the sh*t hole. Seriously? I brought an old friend here today after boasting about how great it was.   1. The hostesses paid more attention to the sign they were putting up than us. We weren't acknowledge for a while.  2. Our waiter ... oh wait? Did we have one? I never saw him.  3. We never got our bread and butter. 4. Took forever for the bill.  5. We were trying to pay and get the hell out and were ignored. I mean..the guy walked right by us and our waving.   Times recently before this:  *The hostess that was supposed to seat us sat a large group that came after us first.  * The hostess told us to wait and that they'd seat us. They FORGOT about us.  *Waiters were never around and when they were, did not seem to want to be there.   I'm sure there was a lot more that bugged me/ pissed me the f**k off.  The only reason I'd come back is for the chocolate lava cake, but then again I've discovered places with the same thing...probably even better.   As to not say that ALL their waiters and..well, everyone working there are horrible, Pedro is the only good waiter. He's friendly, attentive, and tries to make sure everything is good.   Maybe it's gotten busier since we've discovered it. Maybe management changed. Whatever the reason, I will probably no longer be coming back or at least not as often as I used to (not even a third as often).  Fog Harbor is now the ex-boyfriend that has treated you like a princess and then turned into a complete douche. You want to go back to him hoping he'd go back to the way he was, but you know it's a lost cause.",

We were right on time and the other people were walk ins. We also went to grab a drink at the bar while we waited and a tiny drink had a hefty price tag of $15. Not to mention it took the entire 15 minutes while we waited to get the drink.  We finally got to our table and sat there for 10 minutes before we got menus, water, or any kind of service or attention. Finally a gentlemen came up and greeted us and asked us what we wanted. By that time we were ready to just order anything and get out of there. We got the blue cheese bread that was available for free if you checked in on yelp. I ordered the crab cakes and my boyfriend ordered the Surf and Turf.   A couple minutes later we were greeted by our actual server, and you could tell he was a bit flustered. He apologized and definitely made up for the horrible experience that we had had up until that point. He was really relaxed and gave us great recommendations on local spots to check out and go out and have late night drinks at.

I had garlic mashed potatoes, but I think they left out much of the garlic. I actually had to add salt to mine! That was not good.  The dessert trays looked fantastic. But we were too full to indulge. The calamari app was very large, great for 3 people!  The servers were nice and dressed well. I like women in ties! The views are nice as well.",

Service was slow and kids entrees came out with our appetizers (my kids are pretty normal and they are not going to sit by patiently while we eat). The crab ceviche was missing the promised lime juice and didn't have enough seasoning. The clam chowder, which is touted as the best in SF, was decidedly not. Gloppy, gritty, and devoid of any authentic flavor does not define greatness. The crab cakes were atrocious -- almost all filler and no nice crust from a proper own fry -- the purveyors should be embarrassed to offer those. The lobster in the lobster mac n cheese was overcooked. Hint: if you fully cook a lobster and then put it in hot mac n cheese and then put it under the broiler, it will turn horribly chewy. \u00a0The only positives were the view, nicely appointed dining room, reasonably priced kids meals, and the sourdough. That's not worth about $50 per person.",

The crab &amp; shrimp sandwich was a little too bland for my taste though. \u00a0I think it needed a little more flavor to it. \u00a0Perhaps salt? \u00a0  Our server was a sweetheart. \u00a0Kept checking up on us and he looked like Liam Hemsworth. \u00a0A total plus!

We were seated at a U-shaped booth with a nice view and the ambiance made us feel as though we could've been anywhere -- Newport Beach, Maine, 1990s SF.  I was in the mood for something sweet so my girlfriend and I asked for a dessert menu while my friend ordered the clam chowder bowl ($8) he wanted. Our server came back with a tray filled with all the various desserts they offer. Impressive and such a cool way to show what's on the menu! My friend's clam chowder was fresh, tasty, and filled with clams. The bread bowl it was served in was just as tasty as the chowder. My Blondie with vanilla ice cream was a large enough dessert for two, but I managed to finish it myself. It was that good.

We were starving so we basically went to the first restaurant we saw which was fog harbor. We were seated immediately and had a very friendly waitress. The view was fantastic and the fresh warm bread they brought out was perfect. But that's about where it all ends. Some of my friends had the crab cakes which they said were not as good as they thought they would be. I remember the words overly salty and very little crab. I had the Alaskan halibut which I found dry and flavorless. I was looking forward to the vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which wasn't bad but the harden sugary top was soft and didn't even cover the whole thing. We all left a little disappointed and needless to say will not be returning.",

The real estate and drinks are what bumped up the rating to 3 stars, but in a city with tons of amazing eateries, this one is better left to the tourists who don't know any better (obviously none of which are Yelpers).",

Everything was fine, though there was some miscommunication about what we'd ordered the staff was in general perfectly friendly.  I ordered bleu cheese garlic bread (this was really good, actually) and the ahi dish as my main. The ahi was underwhelming: quite bland, in part I'm sure because it was overcooked. To be fair, the presentation of the fish was pretty well done (heh). It was dressed with what I'm assuming was supposed to be a wasabi paste which, though already weak, was completely overpowered by the pickled ginger \u00a0scattered liberally over the fish.  If I were to come here again, I'd give their \"higher end\" dishes a pass, I think, and go straight for the fish 'n chips, which looked much more promising once I'd seen it.  If you're a one-plate kind of eater, this can be a $$ restaurant; if you tend to get a starter *and* a main, like I generally do, you'll quickly find yourself in the $$$ range, especially when you add a few drinks to the equation.",

Having grown up around here I have a fairly typical disdainful attitude about 'tourist trap' type places, I have to tell you, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here. \u00a0The prices were not nearly as bad as I expected (about $30/person with drinks but without dessert) and the food was actually quite tasty. \u00a0It was here that I had my first experience with oysters, and raw ones at that! The cocktail sauce served with them had just the right amount of sinus clearing heat, the oysters themselves were very fresh and delicious.   Between the three of us we had the seared tuna salad, a pasta dish and a burger, we were well satisfied with our meal. \u00a0The wine list had several pleasant options and the view was, of course, spectacular. \u00a0It was one of those rare days when the sun was shining, the sky was clear and the water was sparkling, the perfect day to enjoy a table by the window, which we did. There was a bit of a miscue at the beginning of the meal, we hung out in the bar while waiting for our table and despite being there for about 15 minutes never did manage to get one of the bar tenders to take our drink order.  What made our experience though was our server, Jay, apparently it was his first weekend there (though not his first weekend as a waiter), he was quick, attentive without hovering, friendly and funny.  While I don't often spend time in this part of town you can bet that the next time I have visitors we'll make our way back here.",

I was coming from San Jose, and was planning on having dinner before I go back home. \u00a0I was craving for sea food. \u00a0You come to San Francisco, you gotta have some sea food if not steak. \u00a0Anyways, I was looking for seafood, and found some reviews that shows this place was pretty good. \u00a0I didn't know how reservations were, so I had made reservations via Yelp. \u00a0When I did it on Yelp, my reservation became at 9:30PM. Meh, lame.   So we came to Pier 39 walked around a bit, and said screw it. \u00a0Let's just ask them how long the wait is. \u00a0If it's longer than expected, we've already made reservations anyways. \u00a0So we walk up to the restaurant and their layout is quite cozy and warm for those who have to wait. \u00a0They have a nice little fireplace that will keep you warm because everyone knows Frisco can get quite cold. \u00a0So anyways, I ask the young woman at the podium about the wait time, and suggested I would like a window view. \u00a0I didn't expect it to be available considering it's around 6-7ish. \u00a0She took me by surprise and said, we are currently cleaning the table right now, and it's window view. \u00a0We sat down for like literally 2-3 minutes boom, here comes our waiter--let's go! \u00a0Omg, the view was amazing, I mean of course, I'm a sucker for scenery, but damn. \u00a0We sat towards the back, window view of the hills and the bridge, to the left was Alcatraz. \u00a0Perfect.   Our waiter was Shawn, absolutely amazing. \u00a0Very fast pace, generous, and helpful on the suggestions. \u00a0My brother thought differently, felt although he could have been more helpful. \u00a0So.. Maybe I was more excited on eating than service. Who knows!  OK, food: \u00a0Quite expensive if you ask me, but was it worth it? Yes and no. \u00a0Some of the items, you can go out to the fish market and get it for cheaper. \u00a0But how it was cooked, well.. Stay tuned.  1/2 Oysters: \u00a0Mini oysters was what it was really. \u00a0The sauce they had made was delicious, I don't remember what it was, but I have pictures. Haha! Foodie! \u00a0It was placed over some ice to keep it cool, which everyone should place raw fish over ice, if you don't... Ugh...  Crab Cakes: \u00a0Oh my, these were so good. \u00a0They were going for $16, only two pieces, which I felt kind of ripped off. \u00a0I cannot deny it, they were bomb! \u00a0Once in a while, yes worth the $16. Lol, I'm all for cheap eats.  Bread Bowl: \u00a0Personally, I feel although they were better than Boudins. \u00a0I had Boudins down the street where you had to get it via cafeteria style and I am not a fan. This bread bowl was much smaller though, but you could taste the clam chowder better. \u00a0Not too much breading either, just enough to distribute.  Fog Harbor Burger: \u00a0Made was Angus Chuck Patty was quite amazing. \u00a0Definitely cooked to perfection without asking. \u00a0Medium rare, but not too rare that it made you feel weirded out to eat it. \u00a0They got it down as far as burger goes.  Fog Harbor 1/2 Lobster/Crab Meat: \u00a0Ok... This was quite disappointing. \u00a0This was their current specialty on the menu, and I honestly felt like I should have just gotten a full damn lobster tail. \u00a0The crab meat was just baked crab. \u00a0Nothing special about it. \u00a0They charged me a little more than just the lobster tail. \u00a0I prefer the lobster tail so much more than to order this again.  Fish and Chips: \u00a0Fried to a golden texture, very delish. \u00a0On point \u00a0Not much I can really say, I didn't really eat it. \u00a0My boyfriend ordered it. :P Sorry guys  Overall my experience was great. \u00a0The best part was that I got to see the sunset, and oh yea, even if you're not facing the window, there are mirrors so you can reflect the image. \u00a0I sat right in front which had the perfect view. \u00a0I loved it.",

Don't go to a restaurant in a tourist trap if you want inexpensive. The wine list was good, the food was large portions and tasty. We had the breadbowl chowder, calamari, bleu-cheese garlic bread, hamburgers, tuna, and I don't know what else. We had extra to take home. The deserts about killed us, but we couldn't resist. Our waitress was fabulous and I left extra for her. We had a great experience.",

My coworker had the shellfish platter which he also found to be very good. We started off the meal with some of the biggest and best crab cakes I've ever had the pleasure of eating, and the service was fantastic as well. We were in and out of a very busy restaurant inside of an hour. I should also mention that the view was quite impressive and this looks like it would be a good place for a date.   The not so great: Not really the restaurant's fault, but the address really confused my GPS... both the sprint nav and google maps put me in an industrial area, which I later found out meant that I drove right by the Mythbuster's warehouse. The price is also a bit on the high side for the amount of food you get, but the quality of the food was spot on.",

We went for dinner so it was packed but we had a view of the harbor during sunset and it was ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. We could see Alcatraz Island too and the ambiance of the restaurant was really fancy (at least to my poor ass) for somewhere meant for tourists.   For our drinks we ordered the non-alcoholic Blackberry Press and Strawberry Basil Nojito and both drinks were super super sour and I will probably stick to just water next time.   The bread was really fresh, warm and fluffy and tasted great with the butter. We ordered a second helping.   My friends ordered the chicken penne (it was pretty good) and the sole (really soft and flavorful) and I split the whole dungeness crab.   I am going to say right now I am not a fan of crab due to my past experiences with suffering cracking it open and how bland and dry the innards usually were, BUT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. It was super moist and had a strong distinct crabby flavor. There was lots of meat available, thus making the tedious process of cracking it open totally worth it. Easily the best crab I've had in my life. The potatoes that came with the dish were kind of greasy and mediocre at best.   The meal ended with a free Biscotti cookie which I thought was neat.   Definitely worth it for the crab and bread, but next time I'll skip out on the drinks and pray for a shorter wait time.",

Being California, there's always some nonsense like this going on that people are forced to deal with. I will leave it to you to investigate the origins of this surcharge, but the bottom line is that restaurants are not, in fact required to apply this charge, and their reason for doing so amounts to a political temper tantrum at customer's expense.

We stopped at Fog Harbor since our Aquarium of the Bay ticket allowed us to get 15% off the bill. Additionally, since it was on the second level, the view of the bay was fantastic. The inside was very nicely decorated and had plenty of seating.   We were seated right away and our waitress was quick to greet us and answer any of our questions. We had a tough time deciding what we wanted to eat, but our waitress had some good advice and offered her favorite dishes. For drinks, we both ordered the Alcatraz Escape. This drink was super tasty and my husband is still raving about how delicious it was. The drink was very tropical with orange and pineapple juices with grenadine, coconut rum, and a float of dark rum. I would definitely order it again.   For lunch, my husband ordered the whole dungeness crab with garlic. This thing was huge! It was really tasty, but honestly, it was a mess. I watched my husband crack open the entire thing and this literally consumed all of his time. By the time he was done cracking, I was almost done eating my meal of seafood cioppino. This came with crab, fish, scallops, clams and mussels in a tomato herb broth. It was delicious and hit the spot. I eyed the dessert tray, which looked delicious, but we were both stuffed from our meal.   Overall, I would recommend this place for a seafood fix. It was a little on the pricey side, but I felt it was justified with how delicious everything was, the great service, and the great view. Next time we visit Pier 39, I would definitely come back here and try the other items on the menu.",

It was rock shrimp with aioli -- delicious. I had the wild salmon, and it was incredible. I am a huge salmon fan, and this was the best I have ever had. It's served over a bed or arugula, fingerling potatoes and crispy onions. It's delightful. The dinner was satisfying but not heavy, so we had room for dessert. We split the tiramisu. It was delectable. The wait staff was highly attentive throughout the dinner and very friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for your time in SF.",

We walked in and it was such a nice restaurant and great service. \u00a0The place did not spell fishy like next door, and they had sourdough bread, yum. \u00a0I ordered and loved the Fish and Chips the Cod tasted like it was just caught and cooked just for me.

    "review_text": "Fog Harbor Fish House is the cliche Pier 39 restaurant, average food quality, but rather expensive. The clam chowder was wonderful and those sitting next to me enjoyed their lobster mac and cheese. On the other hand, for me, the crab roll was mediocre. \u00a0  It felt little different than as if it were out of a can, but the Texas Toast made it work a little. The prices were also fairly high, but the server was attentive despite the difficulties of working at a crowded Pier 39 restaurant.   The moral of the story is not to be some dimwit who eats at Pier 39. Pier 39 is the land of the $5 corn dog and $4 soda. It's a tourist trap of worldwide proportions, filled with every museum or giant machine that wants to grab your money in existence.   Sure, Pier 39 has great attractions like Rocket Boat, Musee Mecanique and so on. But for god's sake - save the eating for the Mission or somewhere else you can get to on the streetcar. Anywhere but in Pier 39.  Fog Harbor Fish House is best avoided. If you go out to San Francisco's many neighborhoods, you'll have better food, even regarding fish and seafood. Fisherman's Wharf also has some wonderful seafood in stands and restaurants which is a lot better than the more touristy Pier 39. And it's only about two blocks away.",

My family and I came here for dinner and we had a good time. We started off with complimentary sourdough bread and a calamari appetizer as well as clam chowder. A trip to SF isn't complete without some clam chowder! The bread had a wonderful crunchy texture and the clam chowder was delicious without being too heavy.  For entrees, I ordered swordfish while the rest of my family ordered ahi tuna and the seafood spaghetti. While the food was a little on the salty side, it was pretty good. I actually liked the swordfish the least out of all the entrees because it was rather dry. The tuna was surprisingly generous in portion and I liked this entree the most. The seafood spaghetti was pretty good too, and that's coming from someone who typically doesn't like seafood. I tried their rose wine soda, which was non-alcoholic. It was yummy! It just tastes like a light fizzy soda, haha. They should just call it grape soda, but I guess they just want to make it sound fancy.  All in all, I'd recommend this place if you're in the area and looking for a nice sit-down restaurant.",

I don't usually like to eat at restaurants off the Wharf because they do feel a bit generic, especially in SF were you can find some of the best food in the country but we were at the Warf and got late so we gave this place a try and so happy we did. It actually reminded me of the quality of food and restaurants that use to be on the Warf before Applebees and Subways were added to make it of course appealing to tourist lol So that being said I am not a fan of seafood I know SF known for seafood and all but whatever I don't so get over it lol. But I do like Fish n Chips so I ordered that and my hubby had shoot can't remember but some kind of braised chicken meal and both were so good! I hate to say this but the food here was better than what we had at Gordon Ramsey's Steak in Vegas a few months before! I know what?! I didn't want to admit it either but I gotta be honest ;) The warm sourdough bread was so delish and the waitress was on top of refilling the bread and drinks And I l loved the ambiance and the lighting, fancy &amp; romantic...but still could wear shorts and Tshirt because of the location so not a bad deal lol. So I will definitely be back here, probably not when I am at other locations in SF but for sure when I am at the Warf =)",

We were startled to see several waitresses and waiters with white uniform button up shirts but no undershirts beneath!! I could see the women's bras and one mans nipples clear as day!!! For a place like this I would have expected management to have that under control at least!  We were seated in the far back of the restaraunt where a party of about 15 teenage girls of 15 years old were seated with no adult supervision and were so loud throughout our whole meal that I could barely make out anything my friend was saying to me. And I really feel bad for the people who were sitting next to them as we were half way across the room! When I said something to our waiter he stated \"yeah, they are pretty annoying\" but never attempted to rectify the situation.   It took about 15 minutes for someone to come get our drink orders and I ordered a margarita and was able to hardly drink it because it was about 70% syrup and way too sweet. We ordered the ahi tuna poke which I really enjoyed and my friend had the crab dip which absolutely loved and devoured. When the main meals arrived my friend had the chowder and said it wasn't really all that special and was just ok. I ordered a plate of clams, mussels, shrimp, crab and corn. The dish was absolutely COVERED in Garlic....there so much garlic everywhere and I had a hard time scraping it off. The clams were ok and there wasn't too much to the mussels. The corn was ridiculous as you couldn't really bite into it but if you scraped it with your teeth you might actually get a little bit. The whole dish was hard to eat because of the ridiculous amount of garlic. It was like someone took about 6-8 whole garlic, minced it and to threw it in. With what we paid, we were severely disappointed....this restaurant needs someone competent enough to actually make this place worth the price...",

I probably paid more than I should have, but the food was good, the service was attentive, and I had a beautiful view of Alcatraz and the San Francisco Bay out the windows. I may be a tourist, but I'm a happy tourist!  Before I went, I was told to definitely order Dungeness crab. My dining companion ordered the whole crab, steamed, and it was delicious. As a crab aficionado, she was happy to report that the crab was good quality and cooked perfectly. I had the special of the day - a blackened fish (I'm sad to say I can't remember what kind of fish!) served on a bed of sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes. The spinach was served in an absolutely delicious sauce, I had to refrain from licking the bowl!  If you're a local, you can probably take the time to dig around in the area and find somewhere less expensive to enjoy seafood in the area. Compared to other tourist-\"friendly\" locations, though, this was definitely a good choice.",

We've ordered seafood cioppino and it was a home run. \u00a0Fresh tomato sauce based broth, mussels, shrimp, scallops,and crab legs perfectly blended together. The dish was large enough for 2 people to start with but added pasta to our order and it was a perfect compliment to the seafood. Order a bottle of wine to go along with the food and you have a complete meal.   There is a little bit of a wait line when you get to restaurant. Make sure you tell the hostess that you want a table with a view on the bay. There is a different waiting time on these tables but the view makes up for it.",

We also got window seating which had the perfect view of the pier from our table! :) The restaurant is super cute and fancy. Between my boyfriend and I, we shared the sourdough clam chowder bread bowl, the red curry mussels and a beer. Both dishes we're amazingggg. The clam chowder- super creamy and filling that pair perfectly well with their warm sourdough bread. Red curry mussels- I'm not a huge seafood gal, but as one bite, yum! They paired it with what seems like toasted garlic bread (they need to include more pieces!). I'll be back!",

Well, it's good to know that this place was rated pretty good, and I can't say I went to SF without eating some kind of seafood so here I was with 4 others (note: \"cooked\" seafood...I don't like anything raw).  My friend actually called them around 8:15ish to see if we can make a reservation, but at that time, they were booked and walk-in would be about a 30-minute wait. \u00a0By the time we got there around 9:00, the restaurant was maybe a 1/3 empty so we were able to sit down right away (thank goodness, I would've had to chew my arm off).  Although we got hot sourdough bread with butter, we ordered the blue cheese garlic bread ($8) and crispy lemon calamari ($12) on top of that and pretty much scarfed it down. \u00a0The calamari was tender with crispy batter...so good. \u00a0The blue cheese garlic bread was good too, but the blue cheese was rich so if I wasn't overly hungry, I wouldn't be able to eat 3 slices. \u00a0But I did.  For main, I ordered the Pacific Sole ($20), but by then, I was already getting stuffed...(didn't help that I had a virgin Pina Colada with the appetizers). \u00a0I still ate some of it. \u00a0The pacific sole was fresh not fishy and went well with the spinach, peppers, and tarragon cooked in a caper sauce (buerre blanc). \u00a0The others ordered coffee and dessert after that, but I had to pass. \u00a0Sooo sooo sooo (did I say \"sooo\"?) saaaaad to miss out on dessert!!!",

We started with the bleu cheese garlic bread (free with yelp check in) and as a non-bleu cheese fan, the bread was surprisingly tasty. The bleu cheese was very mild and broiled crisp on top.   The clam chowder was thick, creamy with large chunks of clam-just the way a good chowder should be. The oysters on the half shell were fresh. The steamed crab legs were delicious although a little drier than I'd like. Drenching them in garlic butter definitely helped:)  I washed down all this garlicky seafood goodness with a Skinny Ginger Lemonade.

You're paying for the view, the service, and a decently cleaned bathroom.   My date and I were seated at a table with the view of Alcatraz with a very friendly (and cute!) waiter. I wasn't extremely hungry, just tired and wanted a clean bathroom (which can be hard to find in the tourist zone), so Fog Harbor Fish House isn't a bad place to be at.   I ordered the soup and salad combo for $14. Definitely not worth it, considering how I get the same stuff as I would at Boudin. Salad is better than Boudin's though, slightly larger portion and with fresher ingredients. I've experienced wilting lettuce at Boudin before. The clam chowder wasn't spectacular. That's probably because no clam chowder in the Bay Area can top the best chowder I've had at Seattle's Pike Place Market. The one here was very generic. I do love my breadbowl though. Yes, that was the deal with this combo, your breadbowl is at no extra cost. If you order a regular bowl of soup and a house salad, it'll just be $14 as well.   My date had this burger with fries, nothing too amazing. I didn't like their fries just because it was too bland. My date loved it though, he doesn't like his fries too salted. So that's just personal preference.   TMI material, skip this paragraph if you need to. I wasn't sure if it's because I had coffee in the morning, or their food wasn't prepared well, I had a major stomach ache shortly after the meal. Another good reason to have a clean bathroom.   Instead of giving you a dessert menu near the end, your waiter will carry a huge tray of desserts to tease you. They are at portions to share. All looking very rich, but I'm not sure how long they've been sitting out. Nonetheless, good tactic.",

So we decided to give it a shot. The views seemed pretty good, but heck if I know, because we weren't asked if we wanted to sit near a window, despite the obvious fact their were many open window seats. Strike one. We asked the waiter if it was okay to drink our own wine and whether their was a corkage fee (their wine list was overpriced), and he didn't know. There was a twelve dollar corkage fee. Strike two. We told him as soon as we got our waiter that we had a coupon for 20 percent off, which he took to put on the tab, but never did. Strike 3-5. He neglected to remember our waters: twice. The food was pretty good, but certainly not better than many other nearby options. We decided to look at a desert menu, which apparently is one of those fossilized versions of the food itself there. My girlfriend had to pee, and the waiter gave me shit for having to wait with the menu until she returned. The next day, when we realized we had been overcharged the 20 percent that should have come off when he took our coupon, we called and tried to get that money refunded, and were refused very shortly.

He said he knew something was off but didn't like to \"interfere\" with his wait staff so that's why we were left just sitting there with no service.

Anyway we were in the area and starving and I saw that it had surprisingly good yelp reviews so we decided to give the harbor a try. It was quite a good experience.  Let me start by saying that the waiting area is really nice. We had to wait a bit to get a table but it was an enjoyable time spent sitting on the couch by their fireplace outside. Inside there was a really great view of the bay and Alcatraz.  They have a really great selection of seafood and I had a really hard time making a decision on what I wanted. I ended up getting the swordfish. It was cooked to perfection. I also loved all the seasonings and sides that came along with it. Though I have to say that on the menu it said that it came with a chimichurri sauce (which I was amazed to see paired with a seafood dish) but what was actually on it was nothing like a chimichurri sauce. It seemed like more of a parsley oil mixture. While it is probably for the best that they did not pair a intense sauce like that with a mild flavored fish, I think they should change the name on the menu. We actually ended up getting charged for someone elses (much more expensive) bill, which was a pain. But the management was very nice about it so it all worked out in the end.  So if you end up being a tourist in SF and feeling hungry after hours of hanging out with the sea lions this is the place to go!",

Plus they purchase local, sustainable seafood right in the SF bay. Very close (5 minutes walking) from Alcatraz cruises so if you are looking for a good place to eat- this one won't disappoint.",

We had a fantastic table with a view of the Golden Gate bridge and a waiter (Ryan) who treated us with a lot of care and attention.  We had a dozen oysters which were on the table shortly after our drinks and delicious bread. I had the Ahi Tuni starter that was very fresh and had spectacular flavor, would be a recommendation for those looking for some good flavor. My daughter had the seafood pasta which was huge and when she was done he offered a to go box. Even though we had a coupon for 20% off, he made sure we were taken care of. When we asked him about movie theaters in the area he was enthusiastic and offered info on three different locations. While the food here is amazing, make sure you ask for Ryan to make the experience even better! We will be coming back the next time we visit the West Coast.",

The Bad:We didn't even see our server for 10 minutes.What kept us entertained while waiting was dodging chairs being moved above us to add to the table next to us. No waters, no bread. Finally the server shows up. \u00a0Got our waters and ordered appetizers. Waters showed up and nope can't order main yet so our server can get a couple of people out of there first...Ok then..alright, he's back so we ordered our main courses just in case we don't see our server for another long while. \u00a0Kids get clam chowder bread bowls(they miss these since we did live in Monterey) and burgers &amp; fries. \u00a0Hubby gets the linguine with crab added on top as recommended by our server. \u00a0I get the shellfish combo also recommended by our server. Appetizers showed up-poke &amp; sliders were really good. Baked oysters-nothing special. Glass of Sauv. Blanc. maybe thins will get better? Finally had to ask for some bread &amp; butter (SF sourdough should make up for something). Another family of 3 gets seated next to us. \u00a0 At this point, I'm envious of the table of 8 in front of us whose server is checking on them constantly. Appetizers gone, kids &amp; I start to draw w/ the crayons they gave...waiting...waiting...  and now The Ugly: family next to us got their food before us? \u00a0I watch another server take our food (had to be because that table were already ordering desert) to the table in front of us then walks away..Our server returns and asks,\"You guys ordered the bread bowls right?\" I say \"yes, but she went to the wrong table-the one in front\". \u00a0The poor girl apologizes to our server. \u00a0Not her fault she was given wrong directions. \u00a0Hubbies linguine arrives-no crab added so server asks the girl to have the crab added. \u00a0My shellfish plate arrives-I try a clam &amp; mussle, oh great-it's cold. \u00a0Server takes it back saying well the bottom is warm..ok..girl server comes back with another bread bowl? \u00a0uh, not us. \u00a0Our server puts the bread bowl in front of me to start with until my plate is fixed. \u00a0Taste the chowder--oh my how much I miss my Monterey Old Fisherman's Grotto. The 14 year old eats it instead. BTW, the kids were starving after a long drive and golden gate bridge adventure. \u00a0Hubbies linguine comes back with crab on top all right. \u00a0They threw a pile of COLD crab on top of hot pasta? \u00a0Yuck. \u00a0Hubby is starving so he decided to just mix it all together to warm the crab. Shellfish mix shows back up-and now it's hot since according to our server he watched just come off the grill. I look down at what was my original plate just reheated so now the food is over done. Clams, crab and mussles are dried up. The shrimp were overcooked so they were tough-I gave these to the hubby. \u00a0The best part of this $35 plate-the corn on the cob. Considering the price ($196) is about the same as our family usuals-Sardine Factory, the Whaling Station, Old Fisherman's Grotto, Saporo, etc., we were all very disappointed.",

    "review_text": "Appetizer: The clam chowder was just average. \u00a0It arrived in a plain white bowl garnished with some parsley that did not seem very fresh. \u00a0On the menu it said that the chowder was award winning but my guest and I did not feel that it was great. \u00a0The soup was not hot enough when it came out so I felt that it was slightly older. \u00a0My guest commented that he had a couple pieces of clam where that was sand. \u00a0I however did not come across any sand.  The second appetizer was the crab cakes. \u00a0I felt that the crab cakes were well made and had a good flavor. \u00a0I felt that the crab was fresh which is very important, especially for a restaurant located on the pier. \u00a0With that said, I'm not sure about the salad that accompanies the crab cake. \u00a0The salad had a good dressing that was somewhat tart and a little spicy. \u00a0It was very good but overpowered the natural flavors of the crab. \u00a0By itself, the crab cake is good but I would suggest pairing it with a salad that has a lighter dressing that can enhance the flavors of the crab more rather than over power it.  Our final appetizer was the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and it was actually our favorite. \u00a0The shrimp was fresh and large. \u00a0It was served in a martini glass filled with cocktail sauce and the cocktail sauce was perfect! \u00a0It had just the right blend of horseradish in it and it was delicious. \u00a0I would definitely order this dish again.  Entrees: My husband ordered the whole lobster and it was served with two sides - mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. \u00a0He said the corn on the cob was very good. \u00a0The mash potatoes were good also but compared to the corn, it wasn't as memorable. \u00a0The lobster was fresh and \"sweet\". \u00a0It was a little on the smaller side but adequate since we had a few appetizers.   I got the shrimp scampi. \u00a0The shrimp was in an oval dish filled with oil, garlic, and parsley with tons of shrimp. \u00a0The rest of the plate was filled with wild rice and fresh vegetables. \u00a0Instead of the mash potatoes and I requested wild rice. \u00a0  I was extremely pleased with the wild rice because I felt that it went very well with the shrimp. \u00a0The vegetables were abundant and I was only able to eat about one third of it. \u00a0Now onto the shrimp - it was delicious and nicely flavored. \u00a0The shrimp was cooked just right and was very crisp. \u00a0I was happy with the portioning, often times restaurants will skimp on the shrimp but I felt that Fog Harbor was more than generous with their portioning.  Service: A bit on the slow side",

Even better (I'm drooling thinking about it now). It made me wish I'd ordered the chowder in a bread bowl. For the main course I had the lemon sole with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes. I stuffed as much of it into me as I could, while savoring every bite. I passed on dessert as I couldn't eat another bite.  The prices for the food were reasonable, the beer (though in a very tall glass) was a bit overpriced. Next time I'm at the wharf, I'll be back.",

But the food just doesn't make you crave to remember. The place has a nice view, it's located on the pier, and the decor is very lovely.   I had the oysters and I believe they were from fanny bay if I could remember. Only 1 selection. The condiments given could have been better. They are a seafood restaurant so I expected to have a larger oyster selection. The ceviche with crab was very delicious, but I felt the chips that were given to compliment it were just thrown on there. It felt a little stale to me. The ceviche could have been a bit more sour as well. I split the cioppino with a friend and because I'm a girl it was an okay amount. I didn't leave feeling full. The seafood in the cioppino tasted a bit dry and the mussels I had did not taste so fresh. I've had better cioppino with much more seafood in it before. We had the Alcatraz escape and the drinks were well made. It tasted great and it wasn't too weak. Instead of giving mints they gave a biscoff cookie, which I thought was weird. Overall, its's an okay place. Not great but definitely not something you must try. I tried to like the place, but I can't still. 3 stars because it's not a bad place.  My friend had the lobster stuffed crab. He enjoyed it. Still he agreed that it's not a memorable place.   The server was nice though. He helped us quite a bit.",

We had a very nice server for a few minutes until he came over to tell us he was leaving and Clementi (sp?) took over for him. (At least, that's what my husband saw on her name tag. She never introduced herself). She took our orders and left. A few minutes after that, a runner brought us an appetizer that wasn't ours. We told him and he left. A few minutes later, a different runner and another wrong appetizer. We told him it wasn't ours and and he also left. Clementi sees this from across the room and comes running over and wants to know what is going on. Not as in, \"Oh, is there a problem that I can solve for you?\". She wanted to know why we were talking to the other employees. She seemed very accusatory, like she thought we were complaining or something.   So we finally get our correct appetizer and then our main courses. THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT. The only \u00a0thing that really ruined our experience was our server's attitude and lack of attentiveness. At the very end, she comes over with the check and says \"I have some treats for \u00a0you\" and literally throws a tiny cookie onto the table in the general direction of each of us, like we were dogs. It was just so ridiculous. The restaurant seemed like it could be very nice and I think, with the right service, it would have been a great experience.

We came here in the afternoon and enjoyed sitting by the fireplace outside and listening to the waterfall while we waited for our table. The restaurant has beautiful bay windows with panoramic views of the wharf. It's worth asking for a table next to the window where you can actually see the seals below!   Being in SF I really wanted fresh baked bread so I was delighted when a bread basket of warm, freshly baked sourdough bread arrived. To kick things off, we enjoyed the Crispy Lemon Calamari ($12), which was delicious! The calamari was seasoned with lemon zest and delicious on it's own even without the lemon aioli. For lunch, one of us enjoyed the award winning Clam Chowder in a Bread Bowl ($9) and the other had the Soup and Salad Combo ($14) with a Caesar side salad. The soup was served in a fresh baked sourdough bread bowl. We enjoyed the complimentary Biscoff cookie that arrived at the end of the meal.  Visit Fog Harbor Fish House, you won't be disappointed!",

    "review_text": "There was one thing I was determined to do while in San Francisco, and that was to find a good seafood place in Fisherman's Wharf where we could enjoy fresh fish and a nice view of the harbor. So I went to Yelp, because I did not want to chance ending up somewhere not so good on my SF Fisherman's Wharf seafood adventure!  I was looking for a nicer dinner place, not just a clam chowder hut, so Fog Harbor caught my eye and with good reviews, we decided to give it a try. I am *so* happy we did .... best meal on our entire vacation!  We had problems figuring out where to enter the place! lol. I saw the Fog Harbor sign on the wall, but finally after walking around some, we realized we had to walk up the stairs and enter from above! :) It is a very touristy area, but we didn't have to wait to get seated. It's a good-sized restaurant, also with options for eating at the bar, so the capacity for customers is quite good. \u00a0 They escorted us to a nice table where we could oversee the ocean, Alcatraz and the Pier 39 traffic below while we ate. Loved it.  We started off with some clam chowder. \u00a0While waiting for soup, we were served nice fresh sourdough bread, it was so delicious! Nice and smooth and not \"too sour\", it was perfect. \u00a0The clam chowder was wonderful. \u00a0Full of clams!! (As a clam chowder should be, but you'd be surprised at how often you can count the clams in a chowder on one hand ....). \u00a0We mopped up every single drop with the remains of our sourdough bread, that bowl was clean and ready for service again by the time we were done with it.  For dinner, I had selected the swordfish. It was served atop ratatouille and fingerling potatoes and was accompanied by pesto sauce and chimichurri. The flavors were amazing, I loved the combination of all these vegetables and sauces along with the swordfish, it really brought the fish \"to life\". I love swordfish, but it can be a little bland if served with the wrong sides. \u00a0 This vegetable/ratatouille blend along with the sauces really did the fish justice, I loved every bite!  My husband decided on the crab cake dinner.  Now, I'm very picky when it comes to crab cakes. \u00a0I'm picky on seafood overall actually, but especially food involving crab. \u00a0If it is fishy tasting at all, I won't have it, so most crab cakes never pass \"the test\" ;-)   I'm very happy to say, the Fog Harbor crab cakes DID pass the \"Laila\" test with flying colors!! They were so smooth and delicious, I even reached over for a couple of extra bites and luckily my husband is good at sharing ;-)   At the end of the night, when our bill came, we actually did feel we got our moneys worth ... between the food, the service and the beautiful view, it was totally worth it and it was exactly the San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf seafood experience that I had dreamed about!! :-)",

The hostess is very friendly and attentive (given that we are actually Asian looking Asian). 3. The Clam Chawder with bread bowl is delicious and of high quality, the waitress actually told us it is pretty big portion, so we decided to share, which worked out great. 4. The deserts, especially the Tiramisu is phenomenal, even in my opinion ( I almost never order desert and liked desert voluntarily) 4.5 The price is very reasonable -- not outrageously high because of being part of the touristic area. 5. The view is great if you could get the window seat (we did not, but we can still see because of the large windows the restaurant has).  All in all, I will come back here to try more food, and I recommend you as well even if you are not a tourist :)",

Clam chowder was mediocre at best. Fried shrimp was good. Sandwich was alright. The spoon that came with my soup was wet with a brown colored substance. I smelled it and it was unmistakably coffee. Not sure I even want to think about how that happened. Nothing, besides the dirty spoon, stood out to us. I kinda felt like this restaurant thinks it can just serve anything simply because it's on pier 39. Not impressed. The fact that my spoon had coffee on it did this place in.

It came with an ear of corn that was grilled and he opted to get the mashed potatoes with it.   For desert I ordered the creme brulee.

It is my favorite item on the menu and since I am such a potato lover, they replace my spinach for an extra side of mashed potatoes. I've also had the salmon, steamed clams (an appetizer) calamari, popcorn shrimp and clam chowder, all of which are delicious. The food is fairly priced.   The service is good, the waiters/waitresses are very friendly and attentive. They also seem very knowledgable about the menu and will give recommendations and suggestions. I remember going there one time with my friends, our waiter was so sweet he hooked us up with free dessert and put it on the check as a \"free birthday dessert\" -- awesome!

The place is all white tablecloths and beautiful views. It was semi-crowded and smelled really good.  Our waitress Claudia was extemely friendly and helpful. She brought our drinks right away and sourdough bread just out of the oven. Yum! We all ordered crab dishes. When in San Francisco you have to get the seafood, yes?  I had the Bloody Mary (spicy), it was decent. The bf had the Angel Island Iced-Tea, he said was very refreshing. Some of us ordered the crab melt. The crab was delicious and the fries were hot and crispy. The bf ordered the crab louie...it was huge! He ate the crab and said it was good. My niece ordered the fried combo (shrimp, calamari and deep-fried fish)...another big portion. I didn't try any but everyone else did so it must have been good.  All in all a pleasant dining experience. Great service. Good food. Great view. The best company. A little pricey, but hey, it's the city. It was worth it.

Our waitress Brenda was also lovely about splitting our portions. \u00a0She even had the kitchen put our entree on two separate plates. \u00a0We came in ~5:30 on a Saturday and didn't need to wait for a table of two and everything came out of the kitchen very promptly.",

I had the mixed grill which comes with salmon, swordfish, and shrimp-mashed potatoes and broccoli. The salmon wasn't great-it was a bit overcooked but the rest of the dish was super filling.

    "review_text": "My gf and I were in SF for the Daniel Tosh tour and asked our friend for dinner suggestions. \u00a0First on her list was Fog Harbor, so we decided to give it a try. \u00a0 I saw a long wait list and wasn't too thrilled about that. \u00a0To our surprise it was just a 15 minute wait on a Saturday evening. We were seated and perused the menu to see what I would like to feast upon for dinner. \u00a0Our server Khaiman took our drink and appetizer orders. \u00a0 When he came back I asked him what was the popular item on the menu. \u00a0He immediately said the shellfish platter is a popular item as well as their mixed grill and a couple other items. \u00a0I ordered the shellfish platter and my gf the mixed grilled. \u00a0Khaiman recommended she get it Cajun flavored for the fish and he was right, but more on that later.  We were given some fresh sourdough bread with our appetizers and it was amazing. We had the Dungeness crab, mango and avocado ceviche and while good, it wasn't amazing or to die for. \u00a0 We also decided to each get a cup of their clam chowder. \u00a0This is a definite must have and something I would get again. Nice flavor with a good amount of clams. \u00a0It's not overloaded with fillers like potatoes that other restaurants utilize. Now for the main course. \u00a0The Shellfish platter came with 1/2 a Dungeness crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, and corn. \u00a0All of those was drenched in a garlic and herb oil that put this dish over the top. \u00a0I love garlic so it was like this dish was made for me. \u00a0Everything was fresh and cooked just right. \u00a0Price was fair considering what was included. \u00a0 The mixed grill my gf had was amazing. \u00a0The Cajun flavoring wasn't spicy or over powering. It complimented the salmon, swordfish, and shrimp well. \u00a0Something I'd recommend to order if you prefer fish over shellfish.  We opted out of dessert cause we were quite stuffed and couldn't possibly eat another bite. \u00a0 When Khaiman brought out our bill he included some biscoff cookies to enjoy at the show. \u00a0 I should mention I ordered a Moscow Mule to sip on during dinner. \u00a0I'm picky since I make my own mules often and they did it right. \u00a0Perfect balance of ginger beer and vodka which made it a refreshing beverage. Of course it was served in a copper mug which every mule should be.  We have a wonderful experience at Fog Harbor and will be back once we visit Frisco again. \u00a0If you have a chance stop by and you won't be disappointed. \u00a0Oh and if you can get Khaiman as your server. He won't steer you wrong and will make sure your glass is always full.",

The clam chowder s really good, creamy and chunky, although there isn't really anything about it that makes it particularly any better than other places. Their baked oysters look really good, on a bed of sea salt, but it tasted slightly weird. I didn't enjoy it as much as I had anticipated. For the entree, I had the cioppino, and I have to say, it was really, very good. I like my foods more on the acidic side, so the tang of the tomatoes were perfect for me. There is a lot of crab meat, the serving size is fairly large, and the celery in it was dynamite. The fish in the cioppino was alright, some pieces better than others, so the consistency wasn't always there. The crostini that comes with the cioppino was kind of small, but was rubbed with great herbs and spices. All in all, a good experience, especially with the spaciousness and the view.",

Although it wasn't quite as rich as chowder usually is. The crab cakes were also good. The poke had a unique mango flavor and paired well with the filling chowder. Overall the food was really good. We will definitely be going back if we find ourselves in the area. I would say that the one thing everyone going here has to order is that clam chowder.",

I was seated right next to the door so whenever people were leaving or entering (which was every few minutes) a cold gust of wind would hit me. The waitress, Brenda, also did not seem I was good enough for attention so she barely provided service. I received my salad first, which the romaine hearts were brown at the tips so I had to cut them off. Then the wine that came several minutes later had visible lint around the whole goblet. The water with lemon I asked for never came. The main dish was okay, but the fish was dry around the edges. Not the food I expected right on the water. After asking 2 more times for water and already halfway through my meal, a manager stopped by and asked how my meal was. I told him that I was still waiting for the water I asked for 3 times. He quickly brought out water and I was grateful. After another few minutes, I finally see Brenda with a glass of water (no lemon) and she scowled as she saw that there was a glass already on my table. She took my water to someone else and I heard her ask very loudly if anyone else would like water....really? With an empty water glass in front of me, Brenda drops off my check - which I had not yet asked for. I really wanted to leave no tip because I felt so unwanted by Brenda but my guilt took over and I left her a around 17%. When I got up to leave, Brenda stood there and said nothing to me (not even a \"have a good night\"!) As I was pushing the door, I looked back to see Brenda opening the check book in front of my table to see what tip I left her. At that moment I really wish I would have left her nothing and should have asked for a discount based on horrible attitude and treatment from Brenda. Truly despicable. I am never going to return. I think I'll stick inland or go back to Neptune's.",

I figured any restaurant on Pier 39 would be, more or less, a tourist trap and didn't expect much from Fog Harbor Fish House.  We had no reservation so they quoted a 45 minute wait. It was actually really nice lounging by their awesome outdoor fireplace and sipping drinks from the bar. But after an hour, we still weren't seated and I got cranky. When we finally got seated they plunked us down at what is clearly the worst table in the place: poor view, low to the ground, and uncomfortable seating. When the waitress asked how we were doing, I couldn't help venting a little bit, and she handled it politely and professionally.  Now's where the good stuff starts. A few minutes later a guy comes to our table and says \"please follow me\". Apparently the waitress told the manager of our displeasure and he took matters into his own hands by moving us to a totally rad table with a killer view. We shot the shit with guy for a while since he once lived in Santa Cruz and suddenly we were in a much better mood!  The food was all fantastic. I think they make their own sourdough here as it was hot and fresh. I ordered the garlic roasted dungeoness crab which was huge and delicious. I think the kitchen will clean it for you for an extra charge, but I donned the bib and did all the work myself which was actually an entertainment of its own.  For my 7 year old daughter, they were happy to do a simple mahi over rice instead of fish and chips which was just perfect.  In retrospect, walking into a nice restaurant on a warm Saturday night in SF without a reservation was a dumb move on my part. They should probably be trying to overestimate the seating times rather than underestimate them, but people make mistakes.  The main takeaway for me is that 1) the staff here clearly gives a shit about their patrons 2) they communicate well enough to do something about it when someone's not happy and 3) the seafood here is awesome.",

Fog Harbor is a classy restaurant with gorgeous views in the middle of tourist central. I mean seriously, you can't get a better view than this! It also helped that after a gloomy summer, even by San Francisco standards, we had an epic weekend of beautiful weather!  To start we ordered the Red Chili Garlic Prawns and the Ahi Tuna 2 ways. The prawns were succulent and tasty and this dish definitely took me to the outer edges of my spice tolerance. The Ahi Tuna appetizer was sesame \"poke\" style with fried wonton and Cajun seared with cayenne aioli. The tuna on the crispy wonton with the creamy sauce was a cool and creamy antidote for my taste buds which were still recovering from the red chili garlic prawns.  For my entree I ordered the Salmon BLT served on a toasted french roll with a pesto aioli. I almost never finish an entire entree, but I couldn't put this thing down! Bacon truly is the miracle meat that goes great with just about anything. The sandwich came with fries and it was an extremely generous portion, I didn't come close to finishing all of them.  My dinner companion ordered the Garlic Roasted Crab, it's a roasted half crab cooked in a garlic herb butter. I didn't try this dish as I'm not much of a crab eater, but it was a sight to behold. It looks like a lot of work, but she is a gigantic crab fan and actually loves the whole process of cracking the thing open and pulling out every last tasty morsel.  Usually at this point, I'm stuffed and dessert is out of the question, but we were in a mood to take it to the limit so we ordered the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was creamy, crackly and a perfect way to end the meal with a cup of coffee.  No complaints out of me when it comes to this place. It was such a beautiful day, the view was spectacular and the service outstanding. It's my pleasure to give credit where credit is due, these people work hard and I would seriously consider eating here the next time I hang with the tourists.",

Once we were seated we were greeted by a sweet girl who had told us it was actually her first week. We ordered a bottle of wine and the shellfish for two! The shellfish for two was more than enough for both of us. If you love delicious flavorful shrimp and buttery garlic flavored crab legs this is the dish for you. I loved the atmosphere, the food, the wine and the service was top notch! I'm so glad I came here instead of The Crab House.",

We arrived after the lunch crowd but before the dinner crowd so the restaurant wasn't very busy. We were seated right away at the back with a nice view of Coit Tower to the left and the bay to the right.   We were given fresh sourdough bread and butter. What I ordered was simple, fried shrimp with fries and coleslaw and hubby had Seafood Penne with fresh fish, clams and mussels in a tomato cream sauce. The food was fresh and hot, good but nothing special. The shrimp was medium in size and fried to a nice golden crisp but unremarkable in taste as was the fries and coleslaw. Per my husband although the seafood was fresh the seafood penne was bland. The service was average, our waiter was more interested in the 3 girls that was seated at the table next to us and totally abandoned our table. \u00a0Even when he was at the other table we couldn't get his attention and he pretty much ignored us, we had to flag down another waiter to get our check because our waiter disappeared.   The food was fresh and the views were really nice, definitely worth a 2nd visit but would order something totally different.",

    "review_text": "3.5/5, +.5 for service  Well, Fog Harbor was my first dinner stop in my 11-day trip down the west coast. Our theme was seafood for our San Francisco stops, since I personally have never been to the Pacific coast and really wanted to test out what's so great about their seafood.  We reserved via OpenTable and had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a window seat, but we did get a seat eventually and were promptly served.  Our dinner included the \"award winning\" clam chowder, dungeness crab cakes, garlic roasted crab, wild salmon, lobster tail, and the lobster mac and cheese. Well, the first thing we realized was we ordered way too much. I understood America and their big portions, but the portions were not just big, they were huge. The garlic roasted crab had to have been at least 5 pounds, and I was actually completely shocked my mom managed to finish the whole crab (although she didn't even touch the corn cob and potatoes). The lobster tail also tasted very good, and that we were actually able to complete. The award winning clam chowder definitely lived up to its name: Creamy (but not too creamy) soup with plentiful clam chunks and easy on the potatoes. The wild salmon was also good, however once again it was so large on portions we couldn't finish it. The lobster mac and cheese was baked and was probably the disappointment of the meal as it really didn't taste anything special, especially when comparing the other orders.  Service started brilliantly, and quite frankly I don't really blame the waitress that much for the slightly worse service we got as we were finishing our meal, since the restaurant closed at 10 and we were still eating at 10:45 (I did say the portions were huge!!!). We finally left around 11 and were the last customers departing the restaurant, having finally experienced seafood in the west coast...miles better than the east coast.",

However, my recent visit this weekend left me slightly disappointed due to the service. First, we were seated at a table too small for our party though we made reservations weeks in advance. The sun was glaring on our table and made us uncomfortable, so we ended up changing tables. However, once we changed tables, we ended up with a waitress that was extremely grumpy. Maybe she picked up an extra couple shifts? She was tired and lifeless and was not keen on interacting more with us than possible. There were plenty of servers and waiters around on a Sunday evening when only 30-40% of the restaurant was filled, yet our service was so slow. Our waters were too often completely empty. It was also a birthday as stated during our reservation, but we had to remind the waitress a couple times to get a candle... When the desserts came out, low and behold, candleless... and then the waitress brought out another dessert with a candle 20 minutes later. She then, charged us for the extra dessert and we had to ask her to take it off. Sloppy... and off...   The food was quite good and well-priced, as usual and the view was nice, though slightly too sunny during sunset (they didnt lower their shades over the offending windows). Enjoyed the mixed grill, clam chowder, crab ceviche, and seafood cioppinos. Don't know what's wrong, but service is getting sloppy.",

Our waitress was sweet but the service wasn't particularly fast. To be honest, that was ok with us, we wanted to take our time and enjoy our last dinner in the city. Fog Harbor was full of tourists but didn't feel touristy.  Our food was AMAZING. She had shrimp cocktail for dinner and was happy with the six very large shrimp plus the warm boudin bread and butter. I had the half garlic roasted Dungeness crab with fingerling potatoes and corn on the cob. My mouth is watering just thinking about it and dinner was two hours ago!

For dessert we had the raspberry cheesecake and the apple crumble a la mode. Very delicious! I loved every bite.

Drinks weak so make sure to ask for strong stuff or you'll be disappointed. \u00a0  CLAM CHOWDER was too watery and lack filling. \u00a0I think a Boudin can would taste better. oh now really did I just say that?!  JUMBO COCKTAIL $13 for 4 shrimps. 1/2 OYSTERS in a nicely presented plate in center of table. Fresh!!! $13.00 1 WHOLE Garlic CRAB $39. \u00a0Great great with butter sauce on side. Well, it was with lobster but oh well, let's dip away.  COCKTAILS: Lemon Drop (strong), Long Beach (whole crab strong!), Blackberry Martini (juice was this??! disappointed), and Alcatraz (oh ok..) if you like rum.  Total for 3 adults $180with tax about $190+($60 + a person). Would that be $$$$?  Would be back here if I were not so allergic to seafood and had to just watch as my favorite other two people chow down while I feed the little babes. \u00a0Agh, the life. \u00a0Friendly upbeat service in a nicely decorated place with great view and really a great place for family (Stroller parking outside is safe).   It's on 2nd floor so find elevator by NFL store across the way. Check receipt for coupon deals. Don't toss..i know u might be buzzed...but really, check first.",

We chose Fog Harbor based on the slightly lower prices and great looking space. We asked for a table with a view and they happily gave us one by the windows.   Camille was our waitress and she was awesome. Five star service. She listened to all the various dietary restrictions - no gluten and no milk - and made several trips into the kitchen just to inquire about ingredients for us. Turns out there is a lot with milk in it. Though the menu has little \"G\"s next to all the gluten free options! She made sure we enjoyed all the food brought to us!  The food was alright. Our guests loved the heck out of everything they got, so really, what more can accomodating hosts ask?",

You can't go wrong with this one.   Lemon fried calamari - Tip, if you have a city pass or one of those flyers at the sf visitor center, be sure to exchange for a welcoming booklet at pier 39, you get the calamari free with two entrees. \u00a0This was better than we expected, with the calamari fried to just the right amount of crispness and the lemon sauce providing a bit of zest.

I've never tasted anything like it - it was beyond delicious! The lobster chunks were huge and the pasta was cooked to perfection. I am not a big fan of alcohol and hate the taste of alcohol, but the Alcatraz was delicious!

Great views, check! Located right at the pier's edge and where a lot of the Blue and Gold Fleet cruises dock.  Crab? Check! A whole menu entirely dedicated to the local Dungeness crab. Fresh and a multitude of preparations, making it very hard for us to choose a single dish.  Joe and I were in the noshing mood, planning to go to Fisherman's Wharf for dinner (post to come!). We shared the 1/2 lb crab, stir fried with onions, peppers, in a spicy red chili garlic sauce. NOM! Turned out a lot better than I thought it would be. The shell was super soft, making it pretty easy to crack even without the crab cracker, and the garlic sauce was nice and spicy! The highlight of the dish: the fresh crab meat waiting inside the shell. Sweet and juicy. Should have ordered a second crab dish in my opinion!  Our other dish: an ahi tuna poke. After having amazing poke in LA, we've been looking around for a good poke. A trip to Hawaii next perhaps? Anyways, the dish was beautifully presented with crispy wonton chips with white and black sesame seeds, a wasabi aioli, an unidentified hot sauce, seaweed, and the ahi tuna marinated in a sesame soy sauce with avocados and mango. Yum! The mango made the dish it's own and added to the refreshing taste. Still not up to our standard from Venice Beach, but satisfying enough.  Great eats, but you definitely pay the price for the location and the view. If you want straight up fresh seafood, served simple, look forward to my Fisherman's Wharf post coming this week!",

I recommend you sit at the bar .. they were so cordial and down to earth, so \"san fransisco\" and so very helpful with drink selections... their seasonal drinks were recommended by Shanna and let me tell u she was spot on !

Casual. Crowded on a Saturday at 2pm so we knew it must be good. \u00a0A lot of large groups come to this place.  FOOD: We ordered -  1. Complimentary bread  2. Blue cheese bread - yummy. This paired well with the soup broth of the cioppino 3. Swordfish w/ capers, grilled veggies - very, very good! Healthy too. Definitely would order this again.  4. Cioppino - huge portion! \u00a0Definitely enough for 2 even without the pasta which is $2 extra. I opted for the crab to be cracked for me for an extra $4. Good but probably would not order again. \u00a0 5. Tiramisu - delicious! Creamy layers. Definitely recommend. Big enough to share between 2 people and maybe even 3.  6. Moscow mule - served in a copper cup! Very good but not the best one I've had which was in San Diego and I don't think they use bitters.  SERVICE: Excellent! The waitress, Ika who was from Kazakhstan, even sang happy birthday to me all by herself, haha.  TIPS: Check-in on FourSquare, Yelp for a free blue cheese bread appetizer! Also check into the pier for a free coupon book at the visitors center which has a coupon in the book for Fog Harbor for a free blue cheese bread OR calamari appetizer. \u00a0If it's your birthday, just say so and they treat you to a complimentary desert! Score! Also reservations can be made on OpenTable.  PRICE: I would say moderate to pricey. Paying full price for a full lunch including appetizer, drink, main dish, dessert expect at least $50 per person.  CONCLUSION: Good food, very big portions, nice view, great service. Solid restaurant! There are so many good restaurants in SF and although this is not a \"must do\" restaurant, it's a good choice.",

Quick with refills and condiments.  - Clam chowder was rich and creamy. generous portions of clam. My favorite part is eating the bread bowl when the bread absorbed most of the clam chowder soup! Nom! They Claim being the best. I can attest that it's good! \u00a0 - Fish and chips pretty average. No better than ordering from a fast food fish and chip joint - Seafood penne had a lackluster taste. Don't recommend.  - Overall, very pleasant meal with a wonderful view of the Pier at a discounted price!",

He told us about the Fresh Market Fish of the Day...sounded great...salmon stuffed with crab, etc, etc.. for $20. \u00a0After looking at our menus, two of us decided on the salmon with stuffed crab..I was craving crab and for the price it seemed decent. \u00a0After taking our orders...we waited, waited, waited, and waited...and waited some more. \u00a0During the time I saw two businessmen come in, order, eat, and pay their bill. \u00a0I saw 3 ladies come in, order, and eat. \u00a0And two old ladies come in, order and eat...all while we were still waiting. \u00a0After about 40 minutes our food was brought. \u00a0BTW, during this time we were waiting for drink refills..hardly ever checked on, etc. \u00a0The food arrived...all looked great and was very excited to eat! \u00a0We start to eat... hmm...the \"salmon\" tastes okay, kind of bland... \u00a0I said to my dad..I don't think this is salmon. \u00a0So, we ask the waiter again what he said the special of the day was. \u00a0He AGAIN said salmon stuffed with crab...we then POLITELY and RESPECTFULLY said that we didn't think it was salmon and that it tasted good, but it's not the special. \u00a0The waiter then said he would go and double-check. \u00a0Come to find out...he was wrong!!! \u00a0That was YESTERDAY'S SPECIAL!! \u00a0He said that he could get the salmon for us though...no apology or anything. \u00a0Too bad we weren't checked on until 20 minutes into our meal though. \u00a0By that time half the meal was gone, and we didn't want to chance waiting another 40 minutes for our food. \u00a0We were very polite about the whole \"mistake\", which you would have thought the waiter would have been even extra nice. \u00a0No such thing. \u00a0He never refilled our drinks. \u00a0Once it came time to get a box and check...that tooks another 20 minutes! \u00a0When he brought the check, he stepped on my dad's foot and didn't say a thing. \u00a0Overall...the food was good, but the ONE waiter needs to be switched out. \u00a0The other waiter that had to start picking up his slack was great. \u00a0Wish we could have had the OTHER waiter. \u00a0Got the bill, thought we would maybe be compensated for at least one of the \"salmon\" bills since I barely even ate half, but all was full price. \u00a0Would I go here again? \u00a0NO. \u00a0Didn't expect a lunch to take 2 hours! \u00a0BTW, the waiter's name was something like Lubo.",

It also has a classy, relaxed atmosphere that was even nicer than I imagined from the reviews and price range designation. \u00a0I would have liked options for sides (fries came with everything, but I like variety). \u00a0Basically, this is a great place to go if you want delicious seafood and great service, with gorgeous views.",

I got the linguini and clams which compared to bistro boudin had much more variety. There were bigger clams and sun dried tomatoes in it, along with a piece of bread on top with red pepper flakes and regular pepper. It also had parmesan cheese already mixed in instead of on top, and it was very delicious however the parmesan on top tasted much better. Along with the clams in the shells, there were also smaller clams not in the shells spread around, and these clams were not crunchy, which I like. This place is great and highly recommended. Quick tip: the restaurant looks tiny from the outside but is gigantic on the inside, and it looks under staff compared to the size, so get there early or else you will definitely have to wait a very long time for the food, but it will not be a long wait at all for a table. ALSO KEEP IN MIND: THEY CHARGE AN ADDITIONAL SERVICE CHARGE OF 3.5% ON EVERY CHECK FOR A HEALTH ORGANIZATION, SO DON'T BE ALARMED WHEN IT COMES UP ON THE CHECK.

Got a beautiful table by the window with a great view.  Mila was our fabulous waitress with a great personality, and told us there is a 15% discount for all locals! Yay!  Right away, got the amazing warm and fresh sourdough. Love.  Started with the crab ceviche with pineapple and avocado. The crab was perfect but pineapple made it too sweet. I give it 3 stars.   Then the amazing, hearty bowl of clam chowder. I have had great chowder and this one is definitely on the top of my list.  For entrees we got the surf and turf and the seafood platter. Surf and turf is delicious with a perfectly made 10 oz steak and delicious crab stuffed lobster.  The seafood platter is generous with lots of clams and mussels and shrimp. The half crab was perfect. Corn is buttery and excellent.  Paired everything with Moscow Mules - must get!   No room for dessert but you do get biscoff cookies with your check.  Great food, would deinitely come back.",

    "review_text": "Normally I do not venture down to Pier 39 since I live here but Codmother was closed (A MUST EAT AT) and I had a visitor in town from AZ so I thought, \"what the heck.\"   First and foremost: If you are a local - SKIP AT ALL COSTS.   Pluses:  1. The wait was minimal on a Thursday night in the summer, which was nice.  2. The restaurant seems clean, upscale and has amazing views if you are willing to wait for them.   3. The drinks were amazing. Mixed very well, creatively concocted and delicious.   The minuses: 1. \u00a0VERY LOUD AND NOISY. There are way too many tables squeezed in the space available. Normally I wouldn't knock a place for this, but given everything else that was bad, I thought I'd list.  2. The service. It is very apparent that each server has too many tables to handle. Service is extremely slow. We were told 4 times our oysters and crab cakes were on the way however the actual time to receive was approx. 30 minutes. If they sent actually on the way, just don't say it. Again, I wouldn't necessarily knock a place for this however the oysters are raw (easy to plate) and the crab cakes were obviously pre-made and just dropped into a fryer. Also, it would have been nice to get or even be offered bread, when everyone seem to have it. Lastly, when we tried to joke or have any conversation with put waitress at all, she immediately became defensive and didn't get the banter.   3. The food. Crab stuff lobster ... Should include ... Lobster. Additionally the dish should not be sitting on top of boxed (at least that's what they tasted like) mashed potatoes. Or in my opinion not for $36 bucks. The swordfish had a very odd square shape, tasted at one point frozen and was dry.   If you're visiting, hungry and need a place to eat on the pier, choose someplace else. Not at all worth the price.",

I did some research and the best I could find was the Fog Harbor Fish House.   I loved this place! The staff was very very friendly and the view of the Golden Gate Bridge was amazing! You don't have to dress up super fancy but I recommend a little more than casual dress would be nice in this place. The menu choices are broad and prices aren't going to break the bank. The drinks are great too.  We started out with an order of calamari and they don't skip out on the squid that's for sure! I couldn't stop eating it. I ordered 2 lobster tails that came with fries. My boyfriend got the sampler plate with clams, crab, and another seafood I can't remember. They were both very satisfying and delicious! We were checked on frequently by a very attentive and smiling waiter and had an overall wonderful experience.  We ordered Tiramisu at the end and oh man...I shouldn't have indulged but they bring a tray of desserts over to you so you can choose what you want. Nothing worse than seeing it in front of you! The tiramisu was sooo good. Moist, creamy, and had a perfect espresso flavor to go with our espressos.   The fact that it's right on Pier 39 is great too so you can walk off your dinner around the pier and watch the magicians and performers right by the water.",

I have to tell you - and it might be a surprise to you as well since it's at PIER 39 - it is.  From the food to the service and certainly the views, Fog Harbor Fish House is about as perfect as you'll get for a San Francisco seafood restaurant.  Specializing in sustainable seafood and with a luxe, Malibu-style gorgeous outdoor space by the entry complete with roaring fireplace, Fog Harbor Fish House is a perfect choice for out-of-town friends and family you're hosting to a romantic date.   It's such a surprise to find a \"view\" restaurant not resting on its laurels or looking a little dated and frumpy (you know who you are).  From the overflowing amount of crab in the San Francisco favorite Crab Louie salad, to the crispy and fresh calamari appetizer to truly, one of the best bowls of steamed clams you may ever have, it was a perfect lunch at Fisherman's Wharf.  Sleek, modern yet comfortable, the ambiance strikes the perfect chord as does its food.  It's just a bit pricey (you will, after all, pay for the pluperfect view) however the quality and postcard perfect location equate to Fog Harbor Fish House being well-priced.  I would go there again in a heartbeat, all on my \"local own\" \u00a0 -without out-of-town family and friends.  If you're thinking, \"Wow, that's pretty high praise\"... it is.  And Fog Harbor Fish House surely deserves it.",

Ours was a big party - two full tables - and we were seated in the back of the restaurant, which had lovely views, but no air circulation. As the sun went down, the room became entirely too stuffy for comfort. I had to get up to walk outside several times just to clear my head. The bar and main restaurant areas were a good 10-15 degrees cooler. That said, it was really nice outside; the wharf is a beautiful place to have dinner.  The fried calamari is an excellent way to start a meal at Fog Harbor. Crispy and expertly cooked, they were absolutely delicious.  If you like sourdough bread, then you'll love the stuff here. People at our tables also raved about the clam chowder, the tuna and the garlic-roasted crab.   The red chili prawns are flavorful, and pack a decent zing, but the steamed clams lacked flavor. Stick with the more highly spiced dishes and you'll be fine.  Desserts were A-OK as well. Nothing too fancy. Our table had just about every dish offered, and I tried most of them. My favorites were the blondie, the apple crisp, and the cheesecake.",

We started with the grilled artichoke appetizer with the crab dip and it was... amazing. \u00a0Then our meals came out. \u00a0My dad ordered the Mixed Grill dish. \u00a0He said that everything on it was excellent but the salmon blew him away. \u00a0My mom had the fish and chips and it was a solid, well-done version of fish and chips. \u00a0My brother ordered the garlic crab which was outstanding... as was everything else on his plate (like the corn and potatoes). \u00a0I ordered one of the specials - a pesto halibut that was phenomenal. \u00a0Great flavors.  It was such a wonderful meal that we were nervous to get dessert, fearing that we might end on a clunker. \u00a0Our waitress assured us, though, that the desserts where worth trying and so we ordered the chocolate banana bread pudding. \u00a0The waitress was so right... that dessert was...

    "review_text": "Went to this place with a friend during a visit to San Fran. After seeing a lot of local fare on tv a few weeks prior and with my boyfriend not being much of a fish person thus meaning I get to eat it so infrequently, I figured I'd seek out one of the better restaurants on pier 39 to have a delicious fish dinner.  We sat by the window and had a gorgeous view of Alcatraz and the harbor, and most of the restaurant has this view even if you're not sitting at the window, so this is an excellent spot if you're a tourist and want the whole experience while you dine.  I had the swordfish with chimichurri sauce. I'm seeing some photos here of that dish served with mixed greens in addition to the wild rice, but my vegetable was broccoli mixed with pearl onions and that was it. I love broccoli, but for such a delicious fish it seemed really lackluster in comparison, and the pearl onions didn't really do much to help. I would have much preferred asparagus, or at least for the broccoli to be anything other than steamed. I dipped it in the garlic sauce from my friends meal, big improvement, sad it wasn't better.   The swordfish steak, however, was perfectly tender and seasoned. I haven't had swordfish in years and after having read that their menu is sustainably caught I had to try it. It didn't disappoint!  We also got a sampling of their seasonal dungeness crab menu by trying the mango and avocado dungeness crab cocktail. The portion could feed one person as a meal it was so huge, and between the two of us we were concerned we wouldn't have enough room for our meals (but not in a bad way, we were loving every minute of it!). This appetizer was packed with crab and really showcased the ingredient in a deliciously fresh way.  My friend ordered the seafood platter which had clams, mussels and crab legs and claws in a garlic butter sauce. I'm not much of a shellfish person, but thanks to Fog Harbor, I now know it was simply because I hadn't had them done well, and these were so delicious I'm seriously wondering where garlic mussels have been all my life. If I were to return I would order this item in a heartbeat, and if you're a garlic lover, you'll absolutely love this!  I look forward to returning and trying more from their menu, but given that their seasonal dungeness crab menu is for a limited time, I'd say definitely try something from that list if you go in the next few weeks, it all looks good!",

All right, the oysters were delicious and fresh. I'll give them that! No horseradish though. The crab sandwich was okay - the bread that it was served in was very good, but the crab itself was a little bland and just too cold. Needed a little sauce or something to flavor it better.   Anyway, our server was just flat, lusterless and almost angry at times. The place was overly busy, but she could have at least tried to appear happy.   I shan't be back.  EDIT: I'm editing this to a 3 star. The food was 3-4 stars but the service was 2-3 stars. The manager seems extremely conscientious and has contacted me with questions on how they can improve - I appreciate this chance for personal feedback!",

The place is very nicely decorated and we were seated next to the windows. We got a very good view of the ocean and the activities outside! To top it off, our waiter was also very pleasant and gave us some recommendations of what we should order too.   What we ordered: - Blue Cheese Garlic Bread: so good! It's a must-order starter. Definitely could of gotten full from this alone.  - Fried Combo: Consisted of fried fish, calamari, shrimp, french fries and cole slaw. We could not finish this. It was huge.  - Seafood Cioppino: We added the pasta with the crab, fish, shrimp, scallops, clams and mussels in the stew. This was amazing and definitely my favorite. I loved the crab and scallops; both were very fresh. We tried to finish this, but we couldn't either.   The portions here are huge. Everything was worth the price. The three of us could not finish our meals. My SoCal friend really liked this place. We really wanted to order dessert, but we were stuffed.

Naturally, we ordered a spread of different seafood dishes including crab ceviche, clam chowder, a seafood platter and the cioppino.   Clam chowder was decent, nothing special and definitely can find better in San Francisco. The seafood platter was also standard, and came with a ton of different shellfish, enough for all of us. I was most excited for and most disappointed by the cioppino; it was literally boiled array of seafood swimming in tomato sauce and immensely lacked depth of flavor.   On the other hand, the restaurant had a great view and good service, but definitely more of a touristy place. Don't know why I expected anything more from Fisherman's Wharf.",

I like to daydream while I eat, so this place was a dream come true.  Service was superb, they seated us prompted and gave us a quick meal as we mentioned we were on a time constraint. I order oyster anywhere I go, and theirs were fresh, no surprises though since this is the bay area. Really wished I had time to try the Dungeoness crab, but we were rushing around.

Service was nothing short of great: a prompt, courteous waiter who didn't hover but brought us our drinks and complimentary fresh-baked sourdough bread with butter and tended to our needs unobtrusively.  Food was delicious; I ordered the Grill Combo which featured perfect portions of shrimp, swordfish and salmon in a delicious citrus butter sauce with a side of veggies and choice of wild rice or garlic mashed potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the Fried Combo, which came with a very generous portion of house-battered and fried calamari, shrimp, and cod, with French fries on the side and dipping sauces. My one disappointment: the side of veggies was not to my liking, a green that looked like stringy broccoli cooked with some cocktail onions. I expected some mixed veggies at least!

I liked the \u00a0atmosphere with staff in crisp white shirts and aprons and a simple, classy decor. They had a nice little happy hour menu with appetizers and drinks, but I was in need of a full lunch. So they sat me at a table with a very nice view (which wasn't difficult - except for a few seats at the bar, every table in the house seems to have a good view).   The waitstaff was very pleasant and efficient, especially Monica, who was friendly and attentive. I'm not normally a big fan of clam chowder but I'd heard good things about Fog Harbor's, so I gave it a try. It was very nice - buttery, creamy, and with just the right amount of potatoes and clams. San Fran sourdough was simple but good, especially with the soup. I could've eaten the chowder, bread, and beer for lunch and been perfectly content. But I was keen to try the seafood, so I got the mixed fried seafood plate. It seemed like the best match for the Anchor Steam I was already drinking. The fish, shrimp, and calamari were good (but not great or special). And my one complaint about this place is proportions. One would think a combo plate of three items would have the items in roughly equal proportion, not one piece of fish, two fried shrimp, and a giant mound of calamari, so that was a bit disappointing.   Two managers stopped by during my meal to ask if everything was good, and while I toyed with registering my minor complaint, I decided I'd prefer to enjoy my meal rather than raise such a minor quibble. All in all, a decent meal. The food here was probably only three stars, but the service was a bit above.",

The Hot Apple Cider with Ginger Liqueur and Cinnamon Whiskey was the perfect drink to warm me up. The Crab Ceviche was also good. I had the Lobster stuffed with Crab. All excellent.   Our server was the reason this place does not get 5 stars. I agree the place was busy but when you charge $$$, one of those stars is for service. He made me feel like I was at an Applebee's; one of those eat - pay - leave places. In fact I have received better, more attentive service at Applebees.",

    "review_text": "Fog Harbor Fish House offers a nice break from the touristy feel of Fisherman's Wharf. My fiance and I went here for a late dinner after a sunset cruise on the bay. If you can, try to request a seat near the windows - the view is unbeatable! We both got fish, her the tuna and myself the swordfish. The swordfish was a little overcooked and tough, but the tuna was some of the best I've had. I suppose it just depends on what you order. The service was good, walking the fine line of giving you privacy while not letting you sit too long with an empty plate. Overall, this is definitely a step up from the normal fare on Pier 39, however your dollar will go further at a place off of the Wharf. I'd stop by again if I was in the area but won't be making a special trip for it anytime soon.",

    "review_text": "(3.5 stars) Based on my experience and the comments of my friends. We were about 20 mins early for our reservation, but were seated right away. Table was set &amp; ready. Got service right away. Enjoyed the appetizers: shrimp, bleu cheese toast &amp; my friends had 2 orders of raw oysters. They really enjoyed those. The entree portions were ample. I finished my crab cake sandwich and fries. Others finished their tuna and shrimp scampi. Others took home what was left of the fried combo plate. Although they said they did not like the fish.  The cocktails looked nice but not special. Supposedly had 2 types of rum in my drink but could hardly taste it. My friend ordered a pomegrante \"daquiri\" which the menu read $4 because it was a 'virgin'. She was charged $9 for an actual cocktail. It was corrected. They were nice enough to split the checks three ways for the 8 of us.  I got a free dessert for my birthday. Warm chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Which we shared because we were too full for individual desserts. The decor is clean and the windows are huge &amp; give a nice view of the piers.  Got parking validated. Not sure if I would ever go back since I hardly ever go to Pier 39. But overall not a bad experience.",

    "review_text": "This restaurant looks good on the surface. Sustainable fish (hooray! A priority for me), amazing view of Alcatraz, nice decor, and a tasty sounding menu. However, many of the items we ordered were mildly disappointing.  Our starters, chili lime shrimp salad and (on special) crab ceviche with mango and avocado, were bizarrely similar just with different protein. The ceviche was served on lettuce, drizzled with the same salad dressing which was mildly mustardy and didn't go with the dish. Also, while the amount of crab was decent, it actually seems skimpy on the mango, avocado, and lime. Definitely missing a ceviche sort of flavor, but it was a tasty pile of shredded crab meat. Both starters also had the same house made tortilla chips, just in different shapes.  My husband liked his crab roll sandwich, and the sweet potato fries that came with it were good. If I had realized my salmon sandwich came with fries, I would have upgraded to sweet potato. Blackened salmon was a nice option. Half my sandwich was leftover and still good the next day, cold.  Our drinks were just okay. We didn't stay for dessert. If you go, insist on a seat with a view.",

It was a beautiful and clear (not foggy at all!) day in San Francisco and the tourists were all abuzz in the pier area. \u00a0Though Fog Harbor Fish House is a huge tourist attraction, it's definitely not a tourist trap. \u00a0I really enjoyed the service (very nice!) and also the selection of foods. \u00a0I was stuck between choosing the seafood platter or the seared ahi tuna. \u00a0In the end, I went with the seared ahi tuna, and it came with this amazing wild rice and seasonal vegetables! \u00a0The tuna was a very decent portion and it came crusted with sesame seeds and a ginger glaze. \u00a0So delicious! \u00a0  To top it off, I got a bowl of clam chowder (their chowder is amazing here!) and a pina colada on the side.   We had such an excellent view of the bay - the Golden Gate bridge was in view, as was Alcatraz island. \u00a0  What a lovely visit to SF! \u00a0I will certainly be back again to eat at Fog Harbor Fish House when I'm in SF in the future!",

The restaurant is situated in the heart of Pier 39. The inside is classy without being too intimidating. You can come in here dressed up for a date night or casually stroll in wearing jeans and tennis shoes. They have sone awesome window seats overlooking the bay and the Alcatraz view.   They start you off with fresh-out-the-oven sourdough bread. I usually shy away from white bread, but I just can't say no to crunchy on the outside, soft and warm inside--fantastic sourdough bread. We also ordered the calamari and clam chowder for appetizers. The calamari is great! The batter is very light, crisp and tasty. It's served with lemon aioli sauce. The clam chowder was also very yummy. It was the right creamy texture with good flavor and the perfect amount of saltiness. For our main entr\u00e9es, I got the Seared Tuna with a side of mashed potatoes and my bf ordered the whole garlic crab with fingerling potatoes. Blame the appetizers because I didn't get to finish my entr\u00e9e. However, the tuna was delicious. Perfect seared exterior with the pink inside. It wasn't overly seasoned, and still featured the natural flavor of the tuna. My bf devoured THE WHOLE CRAB. That means it's good right?  I will definitely brave the touristy crowd and the expensive parking to eat some great seafood from here.",

    "review_text": "First off, I just want to say that I originally had 1st intentions of going to another restaurant to celebrate a 6 year anniversary. Unfortunately, that place was already booked (place is called Navio located in Half Moon Bay; attempted to book reservation two weeks ago; no luck). Anyway, I must say that I'm so grateful to have found Fog Harbor Fish House. \u00a0This restaurant was going to be my backup plan B; however, should never be considered a plan B. This restaurant is the real deal.   I booked a reservation at 9:15pm (used open-table) and right below reservation time I stated under special requests...this is my first time for the restaurant and personally wanted to see if any staff representative can label \"Happy anniversary\" on the table nearby a window for viewing and personally requested to buy a cake and have the plate labeled in icing \"Happy Anniversary Day\". Little did I know that they would actually do this; well turns out they granted all requests. My server was Pedro; hands out provided the best experience for my girlfriend and I. Thank you Pedro for a job well done. \u00a0   My girlfriend and I sat down at exactly 9:15pm as stated, anniversary in coloring on the table and a great view of the bay. Atmosphere like can be a little noisy, but that didn't bother me at all. Service is excellent and the food is superb. It's the real deal. My girlfriend got the lobster plate stuffed with crab for 35 dollars; it's worth every penny!!!! I got the halibut for 32 dollars; best tasty fish ever!!!!! They both are seasonal.  My girlfriend was speechless when she saw the \"Happy Anniversary\" in coloring on the side of the table. Toward the end, Pedro closed it by bringing a tiramisu cake, candle on top and with \"happy anniversary day\" labeled in icing for my girlfriend chanting Happy Anniversary Day. She was blown away!!!!!!!!!! \u00a0Even better, while I expected to pay for the cake (as listed on my special request through open table), I realized that the cake which was 8.50 was reimbursed as a manager compensation. I can't believe this tremendous service, outstanding food, gorgeous view of the bay and last but not least experience exceeded beyond my own expectations. Plan to come here more often. Drive is worth it. Pier 39 parking is free for two hours (make sure you ask waiter to stamp the back of card for you).   Thank you Pedro and Fog Harbor Fish House!!!!!!!",

    "review_text": "Fog Harbor Fish House is located at Pier 39 on the second level. We came here for Dine About Town 2014 and made reservations about a week in advance to secure a spot for dinner. We had parked in the Pier 39 garage where Fog Harbor would validate 2 hours of parking when after 6pm. We came here on a Saturday night and boy, the whole restaurant was packed! There were even people waiting for seats. When you first enter Fog Harbor, you'll notice that they have a really cozy fireplace area for those who are waiting. We were seated in one of the booths near the window with a nice view of the bay. I wish we came a bit earlier when the sun was setting though.  Food- Red Curry Steamed Mussels: The PEI mussels were steamed in garlic, onions, peppers, and a coconut curry broth. The coconut curry broth was not too flavorful. I could barely taste the curry flavor. However, these mussels were REALLY fresh. YUM. Definitely, the freshest mussels I have had compared to all the other restaurants I've been to.  Seafood Cioppino: The cioppino comes with crab, salmon, shrimp, clams, scallops, and mussels stewed in a tomato herb broth with pasta. What I thought was really cute was that Fog Harbor provides you bibs so you won't get food on yourself! A plus for me since I can be a pretty messy eater when it comes to seafood. The tomato herb broth was really flavorful. I ended up taking the complimentary bread and dipped it into the broth. So delicious. My cioppino came with 3 pieces of crab, a good amount of salmon, shrimp, clams, scallops, and mussels. All the seafood were really fresh and in good quality. There's no fishy taste to them. My seafood cioppino also comes with pasta too. Originally, they had forgotten to include it into the dish, but the manager on duty quickly apologized and provided me a bowl of the pasta. Regardless, the seafood cioppino has really BIG portions. They are not skimpy with their seafood.   Molten Chocolate Cake: The cake was served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. The cake was REALLY sweet. The ice cream definitely complemented well with the chocolate cake. Unfortunately, the cake didn't have any melted chocolate in it when I cut it open in half. :(   Our dinner lasted for almost 2 hours! That was pretty surprising but in a good way. :) At the end of the meal, they also provide you Biscoff cookies. Per our waiter, he stated that they are quite delicious when dipped in coffee or milk. The overall service was excellent. The waiter and the manager on duty really made sure that everything was going smoothly and checked up on us. I think this was a successful Dine About Town! :)",

The server was a Hawaiian fellow who was very eager to provide some tourist tips and to have some friendly banter. The clam chowder was sublime, creamy, textural, and seasoned well. A true highlight as the menu suggests. We had the. Ran cakes and crab stuffed lobster for main which both rounded out a great meal. The lobster was cooked perfectly with the welcomed addition of crab to give two distinct flavours. The crab cakes were seasoned well, had a nice crunch to the shell and were a good size for the money. The location is a dream for an Aussie like Myself with Alcatraz and golden gate in the background, providing a postcard like backdrop. In summary a strong performing meal with superb service has given me a second great experience from this restaurant. Food 8/10 9/10 decor 7/10",

    "review_text": "As of now, I see that the overall rating is at a 3.5 stars, and I think that is what I would give it. \u00a0I'm deciding to give it a 4 stars though, because I think if I had to go .5 star higher or lower, I would go higher because the overall experience was pretty good.  The warm, fresh sourdough bread was fantastic. \u00a0It really made me wish I got the clam chowder to go with it though.  As a starter, my hubby and I got the calamari. \u00a0I have to say, the only reason why I would give it a 3.5 stars is because of the calamari. \u00a0I'm no cooking expert, but I've heard when things are not fried at the right temperature, they absorb a lot more oil. \u00a0The calamari was SUPER UBER oily. \u00a0I didn't even feel like I could taste the calamari, just the breading and oil. \u00a0 It was on a bed of lettuce and there was tons of oil on the lettuce. \u00a0 It was pretty ick. \u00a0Did I mention it was oily???  My hubby ordered the lobster tail, which was pretty good. \u00a0He let me try some of his plate. \u00a0The vegetables were cooked perfectly, not mushy or anything. \u00a0The mashed potatoes were....regular. \u00a0They were too mushy and the taste wasn't that spectacular.  I wasn't THAT hungry so I got the tuna tartare. \u00a0 That was pretty damn good, so I would highly recommend that. \u00a0The ripe (but not mushy) mango and avocado were so good with it. \u00a0I do miss that and hope to go back for that and then probably get the soup to go with the yummy bread.  The other thing is that I didn't get to sit where there was a view since it was too crowded, but it was one of those times where it seemed everyone else had a nice view except me. \u00a0Oh wells, overall, it was a nice lunch. \u00a0I'm not going to blame them for being too busy to seat me with a nice view, but I'm sure that would have added to the experience. \u00a0I MIGHT have given a strong 4 stars. ;)  So, I guess after writing this review, I realized I don't like mushy things that aren't supposed to be too mushy...  UPDATE...  The manager contacted me and apologized to me that I did not have a great experience and for the fact I did not get a window seat. \u00a0Well, it totally wasn't their fault I didn't get a window seat, so I definitely don't blame them for that at all. I just knew it would have added to the experience. \u00a0Anyways, the reason why I felt so compelled to give an update is because I admire the fact that the manager contacted me and was not defensive at all. \u00a0And he also said he would let the whole team there know about my experience.  SO, I will take my family there and try it another time and see what my experience is. \u00a0I might take one for the Yelp team and even order the calamari again to see if it's super uber oily or fried to perfection and let everyone know. \u00a0  I'm sure with that kind of attitude, the restaurant will continue to improve. \u00a0So, we'll see what my next visit is like! \u00a0In the meantime, I think they deserve 5 stars though.",

Although the seating hostess asked us where we were from (showing they get tons of tourists) she was super nice and got us a great table with stunning view. The waiter was accommodating and kind as well as professional- he spent a bit too long eying my sisters ID when she ordered wine (she is 23).  The bread was hot and fresh and a great way to start. We also got a smoked salmon appetizer which was incredible.  My dad order the fish &amp; chips and really enjoyed them. My mom got a platter of different fish and shrimp with rice pilaf made w/ wild rice and broccoli. It was all excellent and the fish was so fresh tasting. My sister got the special- a very tasty white fish that is from the coast of Vietnam. It was prepared in a wonderful sauce on top of creamy mashed potatoes and wonderful spinach. My pan-seered chicken also had a great sauce and mashed potatoes/spinach. It was wonderful. The waiter somehow convinced me to get dessert even though I was stuffed. All the desserts looked to die for. I got the caramel toffee cake- it was wonderful. I would highly recommend going here if you are visiting San Francisco and want a less touristy place.

Fried shrimp and fried fish were ok calamari was delicate but too bland Salmon over beets and brussel sprouts hearty dish excellent  Apple crisp very good - esp light caramel sauce over high quality vanilla ice cream  by far was the customer service that was impressive my salmon was supposed to have sauce on the side- cook made it with sauce on top but Ashlie caught it before it even got to us and made them redo it That process made our wait time a lot longer for food. manager came by and offered a discount for us! Ashlie meanwhile made sure we had plenty of warm fresh bread - even before we finished the first loaf. thank you - what a great place in the midst of a big tourist trap with incredible service",

There was a heat wave in sf, and this place was insanely sweaty hot. As I sat at the bar sucking down a cold drink, I looked around at the people sitting at the window seats, where I was going to be sitting soon, to see them all using their napkins to wipe the sweat off their forehead. Nightmare status. NO AC!  This was a dinner for my birthday, and I was hoping to not have to rush through it just to get outside for some fresh air.  Bartender was super nice, don't remember his name, but when we told him we were gonna go get seated so we wanted to pay for the tab, he offered to make us another round of drinks and bring to our table at the happy hour price (which was about $5 cheaper). Awesome.  Told the hostess I would rather die than sit at one of those window seats where the other customers were stewing in their own sweat. So she sat us in this room off to the side of the main dining room, right next to a window that just wasn't in the sun and the window was propped open a bit. Perfect spot!!!!! So thank you so much for being accommodating!  Now for the food! Started with the calamari, lightly battered/fried rings, a nice lemon aoli type dip (very light).  Chili shrimp - woah. SOO good! Spicy! But flavorful!! Used the fresh sourdough bread they give you complimentary to dip in this spicy broth  1/2 garlic crab - good garlic flavor! Tender meat, have to crack it yourself \u00a0 Dungeonous crab cocktail - decent portion of shredded tender crab meat served over ice with cocktail sauce on the side.  Think that was enough? No.  Dinner was a whole Maine lobster with a side of mashed potatoes and a grilled corn on the cob. The lobsters tail was over cooked and chewy, but the claws were tender. Kinda sad about the lobster tail, but I guess that happens when you get a whole lobster?   Dessert was complimentary cause it was my birthday, I was just brought out a dessert the waiter, Rudy picked. It was some sort of warm chocolate rich almost lava melty cake with vanilla ice cream and house made whip cream. Really decadent.   Good service, lovely ambiance, and fresh seafood. Fun birthday dinner ;) Thanks Fog Harbor!",

You will receive a coupon book which contains a coupon for 20% off your meal!  Boyfriend and I came on a Monday in October around 1pm. It appeared busy and there was a 10-15 minute wait to be seated, but the gentleman seating us stated that it was \"slow\" today!   Luckily, we were seated in an empty connecting room facing the water! I liked this area better because your body is facing the water, as opposed to having to turn your body to face the water in the main dining   We were served HOT, fresh sourdough before receiving our main dishes.   I ordered the king salmon dish which was \"market price\" - apparently market price in October was $32! That's how much a salmon dish at a popular Disneyland restaurant is! It was REALLY good, though! I substituted the potatoes with wild rice.   You receive a Biscoff cookie with your check, and at the bottom of the check is a coupon for the Biscoff Coffee Corner located on the first floor on Pier 39. I think it was 30% off?  Not only was the food good, but the ambiance was quiet (while we were there, at least!) and romantic. I had a hot date, eating deeeeelicious salmon and looking out at the water, tourists, sea lions, Golden Gate Bridge, and Alcatraz.. how could I go wrong?!",

I cannot believe how awesome this place is. The staff was AMAZING and the food was unbelievably good.  We were sat down right away, because we didn't need a table by the window which I guess takes a little while. The view was still very pretty from our table inside the restaurant. I ordered clam chowder and my mom ordered fish and chips. The food took a little while, but they WERE pretty busy, so we didn't mind. And when the food came it was incredible, so no complaints at all. And then they came over and apologized for the little wait, and offered us free dessert!  I think I've just become so accustomed to horrible service in restaurants, but I was stunned and mightily impressed. And the desserts, like the entrees, were utterly delicious. Fish and chips were great, the clam chowder is the second best I've ever had (first best is Splash in San Luis Obispo), my mom's creme brulee was fantastic and the chocolate cake and ice cream I got..... no words. Just tears of joy.  Thank you to Shawna, our waitress, and Krystle, the hostess, for being ridiculously awesome at what you do. You earned yourselves some fans for life.",

I know there are lots of similar restaurant options nearby, but they either lack in food or interior or attentive servers. I tried to nitpick and find things I don't like about this place, but honestly I couldn't (again, apart from having to deal with major tourist crowds, which is no fault of the restaurant) Just be sure to check out tourist brochures and/or yelp check-in for modest discounts or freebies. In fact, most Wharf/Pier39 restaurants have some form of promotion. They also validate parking so make sure to take advantage of that.  My party had clam chowder, cioppino, crabs, shellfish platter along with some white wine and dessert. \u00a0Clam chowder wasn't the best I've had around bay area, but they were above average. Seafood was fresh and prepared right.  This probably isn't the best place for family with small children, but for more adult-oriented crowd or date nights, I would highly recommend.",

If I had a choice I would have avoided this place and gone somewhere with more of a specialty in seafood. What happened here?   What we had: Seafood platter for 2 (no butter), Iced Tea  The Good: Nice views (if you are lucky) Nice waitress Excellent claim chowder (award winning) Iced tea was clean and refreshing Clean cutlery and dishes The crab was the only redeeming quality of the platter   The Bad: Significant wait times 40 minutes - hour Rude, unorganized, woman who took down wait times (not just to me)  The terrible: Seafood platter for 2 was ~50 dollars The platter was not even close to what we were expecting: We believe it was cove mussels that were used, minuscule amount of meat inside, some were even empty (no QC check) We maybe got 10 mussels in our meal, 10 pieces of shrimp, a few clams, and 2 full sets of crab legs Corn was stale and not fresh, this was evident by the fact the core was dried out  Avoid the platter at all costs - it is not worth it. I could have easily finished it by myself with room to spare. The quality was poor and prices were very high. Check came out to almost 100 dollars after tip for 2 people.

Service: Our server, Meron, was extremely friendly and attentive. She made sure we had everything we needed and came over several times to see how we were doing. She even helped us open the towelette packet and put on our bibs. The manager, I believe, noticed we needed something and immediately helped us and thanked us for being patient. My scarf fell off my chair to the floor and a different server noticed and picked it up for me. The entire staff was top-notch. Excellent service all around. Very impressed (and I'm not usually that impressed by service).  Decor: Dark and intimate. Very fancy and upscale atmosphere, but the attire ranges from casual to fancy. Although it is fancy, nothing about this place screams snobbish (being tourist friendly helps). Even the bathrooms are clean and nice. Definitely request to get a seat by the window. The view of the bay is incredible. Where else can you go fine dining and look out the window and see the boats glistening in the water up close? I felt like I was on the Titanic.  Food: I loved how the Darigold butter was slightly warm and melted, which makes applying it on the sourdough bread much easier. The garlic roasted dungeness crab was superb and was my absolute favorite dish here. It comes with roasted fingerling potatoes, corn on the cob, and garlic oil sauce. Absolutely delicious. After having the perfect dungeness crab as the first dish, it set the bar so high that no other crab dish could really compare. The crab clam chowder was good and rich, and also another favorite. The swordfish and crab linguini alfredo were good, but personally not as impressive. The chocolate lava cake was to die for. It wasn't runny in the middle like other lava cakes, but the instant you put it in your mouth and your tongue touches it, it melts into liquid chocolate. What kind of witchery is this? Seriously. It was like MAGIC. It looked like a regular chocolate cake but it melts into chocolate in your mouth! I still can't get over how amazing and mind-blowing it was. It was very rich like a brownie and the vanilla ice cream pairing was the perfect complement to it. The whipped cream was also sweet and flavorful, and definitely not from a store-bought spray can. I was so fascinated by the lava cake that I immediately googled recipes so I can attempt to make my own cake-that-turns-into-chocolate-the-second-it-\u00adenters-your-mouth.  I am dreaming (&amp; drooling) of the day when I can come back and have another taste of the heavenly dungeness crab and lava cake.",

Normally my husband and I wouldn't head over to Pier 39 for dinner because it's so touristy, but we had a friend in town and she wanted seafood. \u00a0Thanks to Yelp, I'm very glad we ended up here.  The view was outstanding. We got a nice table by the window looking out at the water. The menu had such a large variety of items to choose from. We had crab cakes and clam chowder as an appetizer. The crab cakes were full of crab meat and not to much filler and the clam chowder was nice and thick, but not to thick. \u00a0I had the shellfish platter, my friend had the scallops, and my husband got the pacific sole. The food was all outstanding. \u00a0I was definitely having a hard time finishing my meal.   The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was for the service. \u00a0It was pretty good for the most part, but after our food was brought out there wasn't much following up. \u00a0My husband wanted a second beer and my girlfriend wanted some more wine which took some time to get. \u00a0Again it was really busy, so we were patient. \u00a0We'd definitely go back again.",

My friend and I had our mind set on clam chowder in a bread bowl on the pier. When we saw the menu had \"Award Winning Clam Chowder in a Sourdough Bread Bowl\", we immediately asked for a table.   The boyfriend and I split a Cioppino (delicious), my friend got a swordfish steak, and my boyfriend's friend got calamari. Everything was delicious but I think the clam chowder took the cake. It had big chunks of clam and the soup was the perfect consistency. I notice that a lot of other places put in too many potatoes in their chowder, but Fog Harbor doesn't overpower the chowder with too much. Bread bowl was amazing. My boyfriend is on a no simple carbs diet - but even he could not resist a freshly baked sourdough bread bowl. Crispy, just a little tart, and warm. Hrmm.   Prices are reasonable. Food was delicious. Service was awesome. Would definitely come here again.",

There were 5 of us and we were seated right away at a table by the window. Our waitress was a bit surly and seemed like she would rather be helping any other table but ours (could be due to having 2 teenagers with us).   I ordered clam chowder to start and after a taste of sand and grit, sent it back. The daughter had seared ahi and loved it, I had a combination platter that had salmon, mahi-mahi and shrimp. It came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The fish was cooked perfectly, but the cook seasoned everything with cayenne pepper. Since another in our party had the same dish (hers with garlic fries), and the fish on her plate was without this seasoning I asked the waitress if mine was a mistake (I am not the too spicy fan), the manager came over right away and claimed my dish was made with the pepper by mistake.   I really appreciated the kindess of the manager (who also comped our desserts), the really good cosmo I had and the company I was with. I would probably not tell people who live in the area to run to this restaurant for a meal, but I would tell people who are visiting to eat here BEFORE going to any other restaurant at Pier 39.",

When we were seated (after a 15 minute wait despite our reservation) there was a window open at our table (the table was immediately adjacent to the window). \u00a0Anyone who has been to Pier 39 knows how strong and cold the wind can be there. \u00a0The wind was so strong that it immediately blew both of our menus off the table! \u00a0It was so cold that we were flapping our arms for fear of numbness. \u00a0The waiter's response when I explained that we needed to shut the window: \"I'll check with my manager.\" \u00a0The cretin who she referred to as a manager came to our table and told us that he needed airflow in the restaurant and could not close the window. \u00a0We asked for an \"indoors\" seating and were given another table. \u00a0Sure enough, 10 minutes after we sat down at the new table we looked over and found that all of the windows had been closed. \u00a0So much for \"needing airflow\". \u00a0At our new table, the waiter took our drink orders and then forgot about us (she literally never returned). \u00a0After 15 minutes, I flagged down another waiter and asked what happened. \u00a0Ten more minutes of waiting produced a 3rd waiter with our drinks and an explanation that our first waiter was a \"floater\" who was used only to substitute for other wait staff when they were eating their own meals. \u00a0I have to stop this review now - there were more service problems, but just recounting them is making my blood pressure too high.  Despite the great food, I would never recommend this place and would never go back --there are so many other good restaurants at Pier 39 that know something about service.",

After a day of sitting on the beach and taking in the last day in San Francisco, we headed here. I made reservations before the trip because this place looked and sounded like a winner.   We were seated upstairs right next to a huge window that overlooked the harbor and had sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge. We left the window slightly cracked so the breeze blew in. We had the sunset and the views and on top of that some amazingly fresh seafood.   The waitress was even so sweet to give me an extra glass of wine on the house since the wine I first requested had run a bit low and she couldn't get a full glass out of it. Try getting that just anywhere! The meal was wonderful, the view was wonderful and the service was outstanding.   This was one of those places that living in Texas, I really could appreciate because we don't get those same views. Nice views from certain places, but completely different. I didn't even mind hearing the seals outside. Again, one of those things that you don't get to experience in Texas ;)  Like I said, the ambiance was completely worth the money spent, but add an amazing meal and drinks to it and it's a stellar evening. I believe the bill was close to 100.00, including a starter, two dinners, dessert, coffee and drinks.   Hope I'll be seeing you again one day Fog Harbor and please....don't change a thing!",

I loved the ambience and the fact that it's on the water and as my friend said, I suppose you're paying for the view as well as the food, which is why it's pricier.  Apparently their clam chowder is very good, and I almost ordered it but instead, I went with the curry mussels, my favorite seafood. The mussels were really soft and soaked in the delicious curry sauce. I was relieved that the curry wasn't spicy at all, although it had a nice small kick to it and was slightly sweet and creamy. I really liked the sauce and I also dipped the complementary bread they serve into the sauce. The amount of mussels they served in the bowl was worth the price, especially for a fancy place.  Service was okay, nothing bad but nothing stood out either. I would like to come here again sometime though, for both the food and view!",

I am glad we did! We were able to get a table for 6 by the window and we had a spectacular view. The service was prompt and friendly. Everyone in my party seemed pleased by the food. My FIL ordered a whole [steamed] lobster and I got to try a bite and it was delicious! I ordered the shrimp skewers which were good, but nothing special. I probably wouldn't order them again, just because I would want to try something else next time. My MIL ordered fish cooked a special way and they were able to accommodate her requests. The filet mignon was also delicious according to my wife. All in all, this is a great restaurant. It's pricey, but we all thought it was well worth it and everyone was happy, which is a miracle considering we were entertaining the very picky in-laws! Oh, and the sourdough bread is amazing. It comes out warm and you smother it in butter.....to die for! I'll be back next time the relatives come to town. It's a nice place without feeling too touristy.",

I was meeting my Sister, her husband, and his mother at Pier 39 for dinner. I'd already decided that if the place they chose had chowder bread bowls I'd finally try one.  The soup was expensive for such a small portion. It was good but it was garnished with cilantro, which completely over powered the taste, every other spoonful had a chunk of cilantro in it so I only enjoyed half of the already small portion.  The service was fairly rushed and not very friendly. I get that this is a touristy place and you are playing a numbers game but not everyone likes to feel like cattle, for these prices I expect better.  I think I had a salad as well but I'm drawing a blank, not a good sign.",

I brought my boyfriend here for lunch for his 20th birthday and I guess we were not prepared for how pricey it was going to be since we just happened to stroll by and decide to eat there since we were hungry and looking for a nice sit down restaurant. We were seated by our sever John who was probably one of the best severs we've ever had! He was professional, sweet and helped us pick out something for appetizers since we both couldn't decide. I ordered the garlic roasted Dungeness crab (it was crab season) and I don't quite remember what my boyfriend had to eat but it seemed like a fried seafood platter of some sort. The garlic crab was SOOO good and it was big enough to satisfy me even with how hungry I was. Unlike other restaurants the garlic flavor could actually be identified while eating the crab meat and not just laying around on the shell. My boyfriend loved his entire plate and finished every bite. For drinks since neither of us are 21 yet, we had the iced tea and the ginger lemonade. OMG I wish I could have that ginger lemonade right now, it was quite strong but combined with the mint and lemon it was a perfect drink paired with the strong garlicy crab. For appetizers my boyfriend ordered the fried calamari since I had never tried it before. It was pretty good even though I know for some people it's an acquired taste but I liked it as soon as I got over the texture :p All in all we had a terrific upscale experience even during lunch hours and customer service here was outstanding so we will definitely be returning. I feel a little guilty for not leaving a bigger tip than I did and after we left we both felt so bad because we have never been served that greatly and John definitely deserved it!!",

I mean it is a Saturday and today is the giants vs. LA dodgers game.  This place is upscale, fine dining type of place. I like that they offer places like these in an attraction base environment. Cause sometimes you want to enjoy a nice dinner with a fantastic view. Like this place I'm at right now.   Our server is nice, but when we asked for water she said it's coming, and made it seem like someone else was bringing it but she brought it to us instead. Sometimes she'd walk by just to walk by and see that my water is almost empty and doesn't fill it up, you're just walking back and forth, what are you doing?   Anyway, what we ordered: clam chowder bread bowl, seafood ciopponi with pasta, and steamed clams.  What it tasted like: everything looked amazing. The clam chowder was the best thing we ordered, it was hot and very good. The seafood ciopponi was ok, there was some type of flavor I probably won't remember. The noodles were hard. The seafood in the ciopponi were good, I like the variety. There was salmon, fish, mussel, clams, shrimp and crab legs. The steamed clams, I've had before somewhere else taste better with garlic broth. This chorizo with tomatoes, I didn't really care for.  Would I come back? Maybe I'll try somewhere else first before I give this one another shot.",

In a nutshell this restaurant is what it was designed to do, and that is; be a tourist destination. \u00a0My fiance had the seared Ahi and while the temp was perfect her seared vegetables were not even close to seared. \u00a0Her rice was bathing in butter. \u00a0My swordfish was dry and the seared vegetables underneath were backstroking in butter. \u00a0Clearly a common theme with the cooks this evening. We being industry folks made the quick assessments that Fog Harbor (perhaps this weekend) was probably the victim of being completely overwhelmed. \u00a0The place is so large that I cannot see how quality can be achieved. \u00a0Our waiter was so far behind we felt bad for him. \u00a0Clearly other guests were less than patient. At any rate, we take responsibility for wanting to eat on the water, after a long three days of dining in San Francisco's awesome boutique family owned restaurants, we subjected ourselves to this absurd price gouging when in comparison we had two fabulous meals for the same price prior nights earlier. \u00a0All in all, the menu is predictable, and the plating/preparations are to be expected in what is essentially a tourist plain Jane steak and seafood house. I am very upset with myself for giving this a shot, mostly because the price was not even anywhere close to worth it. \u00a0We would have rather eaten from a creative food truck.",

Because we made an online reservation, we were treated to a complementary amuse bouche which was very good. For an appetizer, we had the crab cakes, which were amazing. The main course was a little disappointing. To be fair, perhaps ordering a crab melt and fries at a restaurant of this sort was my own fault, but my thinking was that they must be able to have an interesting and fancy take on this relatively lower class meal. I was wrong. It was just a regular greasy crab melt that I could have got anywhere on Fisherman's Wharf. It still tasted fine, but I was disappointed. My companion's meal was a much more classical fish dish, and looked quite scrumptious. Taken all together, I'd say our evening here warrants the 4 stars I've given them.",

    "review_text": "We had the greatest service and the food was phenomenal. NOT! I wanted to treat my little girl to her favorite meal of fish and chips at her favorite place in the City, Pier 39. Since my daughter was famished, I stopped by the first restaurant that served a kids portion of fish and chips. It was Fog Harbor Fish House. What a big mistake that was. Our waitress, who acted like she had some sort of hearing impairment, seemed like she was on 'something'. I had to repeat my order four times. Yes four times. But whatever. Maybe she was having a bad day. We ordered the kids fish and chips, curry mussels, and the cheeseburger. After waiting for about ten minutes, my daughter started to complain for that she was hungry, and was there any bread for her to nibble on before her fish and chips? \u00a0Looking around for our waitress, she was no where to be found. Finally the double doors to the kitchen opened and out came our deaf waitress carrying our mussels. She sets \u00a0it down and I start digging in. I offered my daughter some. She refused, she just wanted bread. The mussels were fresh, but didn't taste curry enough (probably the freshest thing that we ordered) and \u00a0the curry sauce just sat at he bottom of the dish. It was like the mussels were steamed separately and the curry sauce was just an afterthought. \u00a0I looked up to ask for the bread, but the deaf waitress disappeared again. She not only forgot our bread but also a bowl to put my shells. I told my daughter to simply drink her cranberry juice that she ordered. She was quiet. I asked her what's wrong. She just looked at the juice. I grabbed the juice and sipped throughout he straw and to my horror that juice was SPOILED! \u00a0Half-way through eating, the double doors flung wide open and out comes our deaf waitress. I practically shouted for a bread basket. And as quickly as she came through the doors she quickly disappeared through them again. But too fast for me to request a bowl for my shells and to fill my water cup. Sigh. She comes out 5 minutes later with warm sourdough bread and butter. My little girl was finally in food heaven. After 10 minutes, my daughter's long-awaited fish and chips and my cheeseburger finally came. I finally asked for a bowl for my shells. Our waitress noticed that the cup was still full of cranberry juice. I politely told her that it was a bit rotten. She stated she'll take the juice out of my bill. My burger looked awesome. But at the first bite I noticed the burger was a bit tough and the bacon old and leathery, liked it was MICROWAVED :( NOT GOOD. The fries were okay, nothing spectacular. I was thirsty and asked my daughter for a little of her water, since i drank all mine and the deaf waitress was now where to be found. Then I looked at my daughter's fish and chips. I asked her why she was just picking at it. She didn't say anything. I asked her if she wanted a to go box for it. She said, \"No box, please\". She NEVER says this. I took a fork full of fish, that $hiT was COLD AND HARD! OMG. I quickly looked around for our deaf and invisible waitress, but she was no where to be found. I finally saw her robustness and asked for the check and two boxes (hey, I wasn't going to waste food. My dog hadn't eaten and could use the cold fish and hard burger). The check came and as I was about to sign it, the manager came up to me and inquired about our meal. I made a face and rolled my eyes. \u00a0He said that wasn't a good sign and to tell him what happened. So I proceeded to tell him about the fish and chips and cranberry juice. I was about to tell him about our lack of service, but he grabbed my check and went to fix my bill. He took out my daughter's meal and gave me an extra 20% off. \u00a0He even offered to fix my daughter another meal. Nice gesture, but it was too late. This place already gave me indigestion. Any minute longer there would have given me food poising.  *KUDOS*:  clean bathrooms my adjusted bill sourdough bread mussels (but see below)  *ATROCIOUSNESS*:  service fish and chips cheeseburger with the leathery bacon the lack of 'curriness' in the mussels",

The cocktail menu is a bit pricey at over $10 a drink, but consistent with other bars we've visited at Fisherman's Warf. We both had Moscow Mules; they were crisp and refreshing, garnished with lime and ginger.  More importantly, you will be delighted in the freshness and high quality of their foods, especially their seafood. Both my fianc\u00e9e and I had their blue cheese wedge salad after seeing one delivered to another person at the bar. The salad looked mouth watering when we saw it, then we proved it was delicious when we ordered our own. It is loaded with creamy blue cheese, crumbles of blue cheese and bacon.  I had the Seared Alaskan Halibut and it was perfect: flaky, over a bed of quinoa, leafy greens, dried berries and a delicious sauce to bring all the flavors together. My fianc\u00e9e did an appetizer combo for dinner including a crab cocktail and clam chowder, she said both items were fresh and delicious.  For those with gluten sensitivity, their menu is clearly marked with all the items that are \"prepared without gluten.\" They have a significant selection of gluten free dishes and one gluten free desert. Our server, albeit quirky, was very conscientious about my needs and took ownership of communicating my needs to the kitchen.  We'd also like to thank them for listing the dungeoness crab cocktail on their receipts as \"dung crab cocktail.\" My fianc\u00e9e and I can verify that the crab cocktail didn't taste like dung, it tasted like crab. However, we we appreciated the laugh.  Overall, a great meal and a wonderful view of the bay. It may be a touristy due to its location on Pier 39. Nevertheless, you'll get a great meal in a nice atmosphere!",

First off, let me just say the ambiance of the place is very...ritzy. The restaurant itself is beautiful--definitely a place to wine and dine someone special with a beautiful view of the bay (*hint hint* guys!). The servers are friendly and attentive, and they made sure my water glass was never left empty.  I had the crab cakes and ahi tuna to start off with, and the crab cakes were by far some of the best I've had in San Francisco. They were moist, creamy, and had a great balance of breading and crab. The ahi tuna was okay--I didn't really care for the seared tuna; it was a little dry but the sesame poke with the wonton chips was delicious to snack on.   I had the Mixed Grill with the salmon, mahi-mahi, and prawns, and I was worried that the fish would come out dry, but surprisingly, the fish was quite juicy and flavorful. I didn't care too much for the prawns though.  Finally, I had the lava cake for dessert, and this is where the 5 star acclaim comes from. The chocolate lava cake was the BEST cake I have ever had. Drizzeled with a heap of warm gooey fudge and served with vanilla ice cream, each bite was a taste of what heaven should taste like. They could have served me dirt for the main course and this cake for dessert and I probably would have still been happy.   All in all, this restaurant was a pleasant dining experience. The prices are a bit steep but a seafood restaurant at the wharf with a view overlooking the bay will cost you a shiny penny.",

Definitely order clam chowder, whatever the option it may be, bowl, cup, in a bread bowl, you will not go wrong.

In fact, he looks very similar to one of our nephews. if ever you are in San Francisco I highly suggest you visit them at Fog Harbor Fish House on Pier 39 - life doesn't get any better than dinning at the Fog Harbor Fish House! And I've eaten at the Top of the Mark and other 5 star restaurants all over the country - but the Fog Harbor was so good we eat there two nights in a row.

To their credit the manager did come over to apologize and we were treated to complimentary desert so it wasn't a total loss and the food was great.

(which isn't my favorite place, but we go there just for him.) He really wanted to go to a good seafood place, so I looked up reviews on yelp and found Fog Harbor. I'm always a little leery of restaurants in tourist-y places (especially since a couple other places I've been to at Pier 39 turned out to be really terrible), but Fog Harbor turned out to be a great choice.   My husband and I have high expectations for our food when we go to nice restaurants in the $20-$40 range, and we were very impressed with this place. My husband and dad both got the swordfish, which they raved about. I got the special, which was a gumbo with vegetables and rice topped with a filet of salmon and grilled shrimp. The salmon was like butter on the inside, and had a deliciously seasoned and seared outside. I also had a fresh squeezed lemonade with ginger. Not overly sweet like most lemonades, just perfect. We got the chocolate cake for desert. It was super moist and I couldn't stop eating it, even after I was already stuffed from dinner. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. My kids kept themselves entertained by drawing on the paper tablecloth with crayons provided to us. My 5 yr. old got the burger from the kid's menu and it was HUGE! enough to easily feed an adult. And it was arguably one of the best burgers I've ever had, too. We will probably go back to Fog Harbor, the next time my dad wants to go to Pier 39 ;)",

However, for some reason, a new server Morgan took over and our time here became almost perfect. She was very kind and always had a small on, and had great customer service for a high quality restaurant. She checked up on us as much as she can, and really changed our time there. I highly recommend asking for her if you want great customer service.  As for the food, the seafood was high quality and everything was absolutely delicious. We had the crab and avocado salad, clam chowder, and the crab ceviche to start off. All of the flavors were upto par and super fresh. I recommend trying their whole crab, their mixed grill, and their shellfish platter for a variety. You can order for 1-2 servings with the shellfish platter. All of the seafood was very fresh and seasoned well.   Overall, I will definitely be returning for their quality seafood and the customer service we received in the end. One tip: make reservations for the view because the view really makes it much more special. Thank you Morgan for a wonderful Christmas Eve dinner with my family!",

Now onto the food - it was good, nothing too fancy. I had a delicious steak, fried calamari, my wife enjoyed an Ahi Tuna and our guests were full from Chinese Dim-Sum - but they did have some lovely shrimp cocktail.  I can't complain, the 4 stars were really for the kid-friendly atmosphere and great views from almost anywhere inside. Oh and they validated parking.

I would recommend both. \u00a0 My wife had a bowl of the chowder. \u00a0 It was creamy, and had wonderful flavor. \u00a0Especially liked the crab meat topping. \u00a0I had the seafood platter. \u00a0The portion was a good size, and felt it was reasonably priced. All the shellfish was cooked properly and loved the slice of bread for dipping in the garlic butter. Finished off the meal with tiramisu- which was spectacular.   Our server was Shawna. \u00a0She was absolutely terrific. \u00a0Took the time to answer all of our questions, and was very prompt with her service. \u00a0She frequently checked in with us and ensured that everything was good. \u00a0If I were to be back in this area again, I would definitely ask to be seated in her section.  Beyond the food and service, the place has a wonderful ambiance. The views overlooking the water are terrific, and found the noise level was not so loud that you could not have a conversation. \u00a0All in all, \u00a0really enjoyed the meal and service we had.",

Fog Harbor exceeded our expectations. Starting off with two delicious cocktails (Manhattan and dirty martini) at the bar, we were given great recommendations from the bartender. After being seated at a window table with a wonderful view of the wharf and \"Happy Anniversary\" adorably scribbled on it, we began to indulge.   For our entrees my husband ordered the seafood cioppino which was chock full of large shell fish and a broth that lit up our tastebuds. He's literally still craving it 2 weeks later. I on the other hand decided to be difficult and create my own dish that was not on the menu. Our waiter Richard who was phenomenal and beyond accommodating, brought me exactly what I was craving (lobster and Dungeness crab pasta in a cream sauce) A-mazing!!  After dinner we were gifted with a large and decadent dessert (a warm walnut brownie with ice cream) for our special occasion. All in all, Fog Harbor made it a very memorable night for us and we thank Richard and staff for the awesome service.",

We tried: -Clam Chowder -Whole Garlic Crab -Fish &amp; Chips  The clam chowder wasn't to my taste - it was incredibly thick and lacking flavor. The garlic crab was great - sweet crab cooked perfectly. The side of corn on the cob was horribly overcooked though. The fish &amp; chips were good, with a light crispy batter and moist fish. However, the fries that it came with were bleh.  The best part was our server. I don't know his name, but he was the BEST. He was on top of it and very friendly. I can't say he reflects the rest of the staff, as a table near us wasn't greeted for several minutes and had to notify the hostess.  All in all, we probably wouldn't return, as touristy areas aren't really our thing. However, I'd recommend this to others who plan to be in that area and are in the mood for crab.",

Although the exterior isn't much to look at, once you go upstairs and even to the waiting area, it's a really nice fine dining experience.   A few friends and I were really in the mood for oysters at around 11am and found fog harbor through yelp. The view from the inside is amazing as you can look out across the pier and see all the boats and tourists wandering about.   My gf and I shared a dozen oysters ($25), a clam chowder bread bowl ($10) and a Dungeness crab roll ($19). I just had to order a crab dish as they just started their crab season just the day before. \u00a0  The oysters were freshly shucked (they shrunk as I added lemon juice) and very sweet, definitely did not disappoint. The clam chowder was very creamy and had lots of clams, although a bit lacking in the amount of actual chowder but its a novelty item so I didn't mind. The crab roll was overflowing with their crab mixture which had good amounts of crab that you could taste in a nicely toasted butter roll.   At the end of our meal, our server notified us that they were doing a promotion in which you rate your experience on your smartphone on their website and you get a complimentary dessert!! And they aren't the skimpy \"one ice cream scoop\" desserts. Actual full fledged desserts like a 5\" Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, huge slices of tiramisu, bread pudding. We got the cranberry and apple crumb cake with vanilla bean ice cream. A great way to finish off the meal.   Our meal for the two of us came to about $75 because we were also ordering a few beers. I would definitely come back here again. Service and quality of food was spot on.",

I never would have expected such poor service from a restaurant like this, especially one in a prime tourist location. A little background, we had reservations for Sunday at 4:00 PM. Here's a summary of our experience here after being seated:  -No one acknowledged us, no one as in any other waitstaff -Another server had to take our order 10 min after being seated. He tells us out waiter didn't know he had the section we were in. -Our waiter served a table that was seated after us and still don't stop by our table which was four feet directly across from their table -We didn't get water after 20 minutes and that's after asking multiple times  -Our waiter didn't acknowledge us for over 15 min, didn't say hello or apologize for the wait -We had to ask for bread -It took 50 min to get our food -We had to flag down our waiter to get boxes and the check -The general manager didn't even ask how everything was even though it was obvious we weren't happy and were looking all over the place for our waiter throughout our entire time there  I cannot stress how bad this dining experience was. How could a tourist restaurant be so poor in customer service? It should be the exact opposite in my opinion. I will not be returning here and will tell others to not go here. The food was mediocre. We ordered the blue cheese garlic bread, clam chowder bowl, crab roll, and the mixed grill. Nothing memorable besides the food was rather bland especially the mixed grill plate. Don't waste your time and money going here. The view of the water and Alcatraz isn't worth it, trust me, the ambiance isn't worth it. If anyone from this restaurant is reading this (which I highly doubt), I'd recommend on training your staff better, especially your general manager working on August 11, 2013.",

Service was great; from the hostess to our server. On to the most important part and the reason why you're reading this review... The food:   - Oysters: Fresh. Fresh. Fresh. I am not the biggest fan of oysters, but I had to try them. They are the cleanest oysters I've ever tasted. I could've eaten half a dozen by myself.  - Ahi Tuna Poke: Decent size chunks with avocado and I believe it was mango as well? The Sriracha drizzled around the plate adds a kick of spice if that's what you're looking for. Down side to this plate was that there was only 3 wonton chips to share!   - Clam Chowder: You can't come to SF and not have a bowl of clam chowder. You won't regret it! So rich and creamy, you can actually tell that there are clams in there! (Also had clam chowder from Nick's Lighthouse... Fog Harbor blows them out of the water)   - Garlic Roasted Dungeness Crab: YUMMY. So glad we went with this over the steamed dungeness. It had so much more flavor to it and was way more juicy than we expected, which is a definitely plus. (Tip: Dip the corn into the garlic/butter... Also, if you prefer mashed potatoes to the fingerling potatoes, just ask your server to substitute it for you)  Overall, we had a great experience. We also ordered 2 drinks from the bar to go with our meal which brought our grand total to ~$108 (excluding tip). Will definitely be back again!",

    "review_text": "This is your typical touristy restaurant in the Pier 39 area, which decent tasting food and a nice view, but inflated prices. Make sure you check in on Yelp to get a free Blue Cheese Garlic Bread appetizer. I came for my friend's birthday (Kellie C.!) since they have a separate room for large parties in the back of the restaurant, and were able to accommodate a group of 18 on a Thursday night. We came in around 8:15pm, and the table was ready, so we were seated right away. Although the table sat 18, we could've used a little more room. However, it worked out fine, and I got to try:  -Blue Cheese Garlic Bread (Fresh Sourdough, Topped w/Garlic, Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese, Herbs, $8): Just ok. The blue cheese overpowered all the other flavors, and you couldn't taste the garlic. The bread was also too crunchy for my liking. Skip! -Oysters (Served w/Cocktail Sauce, Dozen $26, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>): The oysters were fresh, but the cocktail sauce and mignonette were just ok. I wish they had given us some Tabasco with the oysters. Skip! -Crispy Lemon Calamari (Seasoned w/Lemon, Served w/Lemon Aioli, $12, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#3lMGE6tFW3afyze8HNomkA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>): Yuck.. the calamari rings were chewy, and the batter was soggy. This is one of the worst fried calamari dishes I've had, and they should really re-look at their recipe. Skip! -Ahi Poke (Marinated Raw Tuna, Avocado, Mango, Sesame-Soy Sauce, Wasabi Aioli, $16): Ok. The tuna tasted fresh, and I liked the wasabi aioli. However, the sesame soy sauce didn't have much flavor, and the dish overall was bland. Skip! -Crab Louis ($22, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#_pzD387ZKQjuxDPLN0KIFA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>): They didn't skimp on the crab, and it tasted really fresh, which was great. However, there were pieces of cartilage in the crab, and the salad itself was bland. I wouldn't order this again. -Crab Roll (Fresh Crab, Celery, Shallot Aioli, Served on a Buttered Roll w/Sweet Potato Fries, $19, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#FyzyT_3ZvIESH5I0qp6APg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>): Pretty good if you like mayo, and I liked that they toasted the roll nicely. The sweet potato fries were also really good. Recommended! -Fish &amp; Chips (Hand Dipped in \"Anchor Steam\" Beer Batter w/Cole Slaw, $17, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#EuuXw-pZ356IX--lG1jksA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>): They give you a huge portion (2 large and 2 medium sized fish sticks, fries, cole slaw), but the fish was just ok. I didn't like the taste and consistency of the batter- it tasted bitter from the beer, and was too crunchy. The cole slaw was also just so-so since it was very bland. However, the fries were done nicely, and the tartar sauce was delicious. -Award Winning Clam Chowder (The Best in San Francisco, Bowl, $8, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#s7bQ8LaMVBCTTvrlIYQd4Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>): This was a pretty good version of clam chowder! It was rich and creamy, and there were big pieces of clam in the chowder. Recommended! -Apple Crisp a la Mode (House-Made w/Granny Smith Apples, Walnuts, Butter Crumb, Served Warm, Topped w/Vanilla Ice Cream, $8.50): Ok. I liked the butter crumb, but the apples were a little hard. I wouldn't order this again. -Warm Chocolate Lava Cake (w/Creamy Chocolate Center, Served w/Vanilla Ice Cream, $8.50): Just ok, nothing special. I wouldn't order this again.  The best dishes from here were the Crab Roll and Clam Chowder, and the fries from the fish and chips. Although I don't think I'd come back for those dishes again, I would recommend ordering them if you are dining here. The service was good up until the end- it took them a long time to bring the dessert and our check. Make sure you ask them to validate your parking ticket if you parked in the structure across the street. \u00a0  Overall, there are so many better restaurants to eat at in SF, and it's not worth coming here unless you can expense your meal, or if you really want a view of the pier area.",

Get the clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl!!! it is delicious enough for a meal by itself! the sourdough is baked fresh and they give you more sourdough bread on the side! their clam chowder is FILLED with clams! yes a rarity since sometimes its just all potatoes and other fillers.  oh and also get the cioppino!!! its work..but it is sooo worth it! they give you the bib and all. the sauce was very tomato-ey...tasted so fresh. It goes great with the sourdough bread to scrape off the bottom of the bowl! they've got a great combination of crab, mussels, clams, and assorted fish in there! this is a must try!",

We passed by this place, thought the decor was nice enough to eat here... The crab house next door didn't look nice to us...  Had a spicy Bloody Mary ($10) at the bar while waiting for our able, it was sooo spicy, but a good one! Bartenders were very strict at carding me! They insisted to see my ID first before making me a drink! ( Hubby had my ID at the moment &amp; he went to restroom) Responsible! That's a good thing. :)   Got a nice booth facing the waterfront views, a dozen of raw oysters ($2.5 each) to start, the oysters were fresh, but the sauce wasn't so great to go with those. The complimentary bread was delicious.   I had whole Dungeness crab ($39), 2 lb crab steamed, served with mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed veggies: the crab was not meaty, very plain, flavorless, I had to dip all the crab meat in Tabasco to finish it.   Hubby had Linguini &amp; Clams ($18), fresh clams, garlic, olive oil, tomatoes: he didn't like it too much, flavorless  Had one more Bloody Mary and a Stella on draft, didn't like the food. We have had wayyyy much better seafood in LA, disappointed, the service was good, the views made up a little bit, but still not impressed. :( Let's try some other places next time.....",

    "review_text": "We wanted to have some lovely seafood while we were in San Francisco, and we chose the Fog Harbor Fish House from the many options on Fisherman's Wharf. Overall, very high marks. First, the view is lovely, and the restaurant itself is very nice and well-appointed. A nice place for a relaxed lunch, date night or a special occasion. Second, the food: -I ordered the ginger coconut cocktail, which was generally very good and tasty, but I felt had a bit too much coconut. It was kind of offputting in mouthfeel but did have a delightful ginger/lemon/spritzer type of flavor. I was torn between loving it and hating it and in the end only drank about half. -The chowder. Oh my god, get some.Some of the best chowder you will ever have. Thick, creamy, silky, delicious. Think cup, but go bowl. You're welcome. -Poke. I do love tuna, so poke is a tough thing to ignore on a menu that isn't in Hawaii. This particular poke is mixed with fresh avocado and mango, with a small amount of seaweed like you'd find in a seaweed salad. Light, gingery, soy-ey (??) and really yum. -Salmon. I got the salmon entree, which was just delicious. Cooked perfectly, with a med-rare center and beautiful grill marks on the outside, set over a creamy sauce with spinach and potatoes. A beautiful piece of fish and a huge portion! -Tuna -- perfectly cooked again with a nice big rare center. Served over a great hash-like mix that included these delightful bits of bok choy. SUPER yum.  In all the food was really excellent. We didn't have time for dessert. Our server was good, helpful and composed. Not cheap -- we had two apps, two entrees and two drinks and the tab topped $100 for LUNCH. Still.... We would definitely come back!",

Our table was right by the window overlooking the wharf. We had the calamari, halibut, crab louis salad, and a complimentary Ghirardelli chocolate cake that was to die for!

I ordered a cup of clam chowder ($6) because I didn't want that to be my main entree, and it's cool that they offer options to have clam chowder in a cup, regular bowl, or bread bowl. Personally I think this is the best clam chowder I have ever tasted in SF, and I have had a LOT of clam chowder in SF.   I also ordered the linguine with clams ($18) which has garlic, olive oil, and tomatoes. This might actually become a regular item for me, if I didn't want to try everything else on the menu at some point. It's fresh, creamy, and very filling.   Even their bread comes straight from the oven, hot on our table. Their selection of cocktails is worth taking a look at as well. I'm just in love with every aspect of Fog Harbor.

I got 3 dishes and they were pretty good, but not something that I really want to come back again for.  Clam chowder: pretty good and not too creamy, but didn't have enough clams   Crab &amp; avocado salad: delicious dressing with fresh crab meat. It comes in a HUGE portion so it's basically a main course.  Garlic Chile Crab: the sauce was amazing and it's great for dipping your bread in. But the seasoning didn't sick well to the crab meat.  Our server (Amy) was decent and attentive, but the hostess (I forgot to get her name) was so rude. She asked us to wait for a table so we sat outside near the fireplace to wait for like 15 minutes. She came up to us with an attitude and asked \"so are you ready now?\" I'm thinking what is wrong with that girl because she was the one who asked us to wait there. While walking to our table, she rudely said \"well, I have this one stable for you so you can sit there or like I guess I can move you too if you don't like it. Whatever.\" I guess certain people don't care about their jobs. I will definitely get her name next time.",

We just wanted a good bowl of clam chowder, in a bread bowl, of course. We got right in, and got a window table, and the view was amazing! The server (I think she said her name was Clementine, maybe?) was there promptly to take our drink orders and had our iced teas and water out in a flash. We ordered 4 clam chowder bread bowls ($10 each, not bad for a nice restaurant on the wharf) and we had those in less than five minutes, so so so so so yummy! It was the best clam chowder any of us have ever had, (we've tried a lot of clam chowder). We will definitely be back and recommend this restaurant to others!! All in all, great view of the wharf, great service, awesome atmosphere and DELICIOUS food!",

I've gone to the Pier Market for chowder in the past, but thought I'd try this place. I was happily satisfied.  Clam chowder - very good and full of tender bits of clam. It's not life changing or the best ever, but well worth the price.  Steamed mussels in the curry/tomato/white wine sauce - savory, cooked perfectly and absolutely flavorful. Dipped my bread in that sauce too.  Crab cakes - light and fluffy.  Complimentary sour dough- warm, fresh, chewy, delicious!  Venue- gorgeous view of the pier/sea/boats. Clean interior. Nice and cozy ambience.  Bill was ~$50 for two people.  Helpful Tidbits:  1. Recommend making early reservations if you want to see the sunset! 2. Free sour dough so why order a bread bowl of chowder?  3. A bowl of chowder with bread is pretty filling. We felt really full after finishing 2 other appetizers. Glad we didn't order more. 3. They will validate 2 free hours at the parking lot at dinner time.",

I made a reservation for Sunday lunch and made a request for a table with a good view, since it was for a special occasion: my dad's birthday. \u00a0Upon being seated, I looked around and realized that they really did save one of the best seats in the house even though the rest of the area was full, plus, they wrote happy birthday on our paper table cloth, and of course they offered me to pick any of the desserts on their menu for my dad! \u00a0I was very pleased!   Food: My family ordered the lobster mac n cheese, the cioppino, and the clam linguine. \u00a0There was also perfectly fresh and warm sourdough bread. \u00a0The lobster mac n' cheese had a fair amount of large chunks of lobster, so I was pretty happy. \u00a0My mother was very happy about the cioppino; it had a nice range and variety of clam, mussel, fish, and some crab legs, plus, she reported everything was very fresh. Plus the soup was delicious. My dad is a quiet man so I didn't hear much about the linguine, but it looked great. Overall, everything was very good. The dessert we got for my dad was the apple crumb pie + ice cream on top, which was great!   Price: Fair for the freshness of the seafood and the occasion.   Service / Experience: As written above, everything was perfect. \u00a0Our waitress was always nearby, brought everything as requested, and was very pleasant. \u00a0The view is of the bay, Marina, and Alcatraz.   Extra: They will validate your Pier 39 parking for 1 hour for lunch, 2 hours for dinner.   Thanks Fog Harbor Fish House, I'm very happy I brought my dad here!",

We then moved to the starters: Blue cheese garlic bread, Fried Scallops, Crab Cake &amp; fries. Special shout out to the fries! Just the right amount of crunch and softness that I like in my fries. CRAB CAKE was the bomb, LOVED IT! Blue cheese garlic bread was tasty. The fried scallops did not do anything for us and we left that plate almost untouched. The dips we got with each of the dishes was awesome! Unfortunately, after the above dishes we felt stuffed and did not actually try the sea food platters/ entrees that we set out to originally have.

Because they live across the street from Pier 39 it made sense to walk over and find a spot to eat. Typically I'd avoid a place so filled with tourists but they raved about Fog Harbor's views and so off we went. The views were indeed lovely! We looked out across the bay to Alcatraz and saw lots of boats sail past.   The food was by no means bad but I think because it's a large restaurant in a heavily trafficked area, some quality gets lost in the mix. There must've been at least 60 other people dining at 3pm. The interior of the space is beautiful, the staff was very professional and polite and the food was good. Nothing wowed me but if you're from out of town and you want an affordable option that's not divey or cheesy, Fog Harbor is perfect.   Expect seafood options like clam chowder in a sourdough bowl, crab cakes, shrimp louie, and even lobster. Other options include salads, sandwiches and lots of seafood pasta.

The sourdough bread that they serve is absolutely delicious and probably one of the best breads that I have tasted. We had the Steamed Clams as our appetizer and that was definitely the best dish of the night--most likely because of the amazing chorizo butter sauce.

Fog Harbor bill includes a suggested gratuity amounts. The suggested gratuity excludes this controversial tax, as it should. It does not feel right also for a tax to include this Sf Emp Ord 4% either (taxing a tax); a double tax situation.   Controversy aside, the food is very good-unequivocally. The Wedge Blue Cheese Salad with bacon was perfect with the sourdough bread. We had the fried combo(calamari, fish, &amp; shrimp), 2 orders. I prefer the squiggly ends of the calamari. My companion likes only the rounded pieces. We traded and ate the pieces each of us like since each plate had some of both. Forgo drinks, if you want to be frugal. Our food came to $52, not bad considering this is SF, Fisherman's Wharf &amp; on the pier. The view is tax worthy. The ambiance of Fog Harbor &amp; the pier area in tax worthy. So freak, perhaps taxing patrons directly for employees health insurance is okay too, just as long as the employees get all the money and none of it magically improves Fog Harbors bottom line. \u00a0The folks making all the wonderful food appear deserve health insurance.

    "review_text": "Our waiter was amazing. I feel like a bad customer because I don't remember his name and he told me twice! I really wish I can give him a shout-out, so here is the best I can do: he's from Hawaii, looks Filipino-ish, has family in Los Angeles and is probably the best, most polite, most sociable waiter I've ever had (without being obnoxious!) So there Fog Harbor Fish House, give him a well-deserved raise!  My boyfriend and I walked all the way through Pier 39 and no other restaurant was calling my attention. I finally spotted two restaurants upstairs, and right when I read the menu for Fog Harbor, I was convinced. My cheffy boyfriend is very picky as well \u00a0(though he'll never admit it) and I knew it was a good choice for the both of us.  The crab menu was super impressive. The crab season is about to end and they offered a page worth variety of crab entrees if you're into it. I ordered the crispy calamari before we sat down by the window with a great Golden Gate Bridge view, and it came out within 8 minutes or so. It definitely did not disappoint! They served it with a delicious aioli and the calamari were thicker chunks with light and crunchy batter.  With me being prego, and already having had my 3rd 6oz low-mercury dish for the week, I unfortunately had to go with a non-seafood option. I only say \"unfortunately\" because Fog Horn looks like they can serve up a mean seafood dish. I chose to go with the Chicken breast sandwich with shallot aioli, bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato. It was perfectly juicy and flavorful and the aioli brought the sandwich together, setting it apart from what a Chicken BLT w/ avocado would taste like.  Tony ordered the Fog Horn Burger medium rare, with a half glass of red wine. The Fog Horn came with caramelized onions and Tony asked to substitute the jack cheese for blue cheese instead. It also had 1000 Island Chipotle on it and he seriously savored every single bite. The blue cheese swap definitely made a huge difference. I had one happy chef man sitting in front of me!  All in all, we spent $50. With the presentation, the wine, the amazing service, the freshness of the food and the promptness of the food arrival, I was impressed and beyond satisfied. I would recommend this place and I would definitely come back.",

    "review_text": "On the No1DP's last visit to see me, he made a request: he wanted to try SF's clam chowder. What the No1DP asks he gets, I just happen to be the lucky woman to tag along. I had another restaurant in mind that was a little less touristy but after some research and consideration we ended up eating here instead.  VENUE: We went on a Sunday night, just as the sun was about to set. The host put us in a table right next to the window. The No1DP and I were able to watch the people walking around Pier 39 and people just getting off the ferries. While the No1DP and I weren't able to secure a window that overlooked Fisherman's Wharf we weren't too far from those windows and we could look at the massive amount of tourists walking the wharf.   SERVICE: Service was excellent, as expected from a fine seafood establishment.   WINE: Both of us had white wines. Although I don't remember specifics on the grape varietal, I remember my wine was a little sweet and went well with my dish.  FOOD The Yelp check-in gets you blue cheese garlic bread. The blue cheese was a bit strong, but it's good for anyone that really likes blue cheese.  We got bowls of their famous clam chowder. One of the better clam chowders I've tasted, and the No1DP agrees. It may look watery when you're served the bowl but don't let that fool you. Instead we were treated to a quite creamy (and not starchy!) soup with good amounts of CLAM. They were quite generous with the clam but they better be considering how much you pay for a bowl!  No1DP got one of their special dishes lobster mac and cheese. As a New Englander, he has a right to be picky about his seafood, especially his lobster. His dish was \"quite comparable to an equivalent dish I'd be served back home\". Lucky him. I tried it and it's quite the rich dish - the cheese is RICH and one big bite can make you significantly fuller than before... No1DP ate less than half of his dish. The lobster was to his liking.  I got another special dish: 0.5 lbs lobster stuffed with dungeness crab. I thought this would be an excellent dish as this would combine two of my great seafood loves - lobster and dungeness crab. When I was served this dish the tail part was the lobster while the head was stuffed with the crab. The crab was quite sweet, I'm not sure if this is supposed to be how the crab naturally tastes, but the sweetness took away from the crab. Lobster was excellent, soft and buttery yet I could taste the lobster. Spinach and mashed potatoes were good sides yet were not too rich to overpower the seafood.   Dessert consisted of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The sugar was hard enough that I can crack it open with one swift tap of the spoon. Custard was creamy yet not too rich. The speculoos cookie they put on top was a nice touch and gave the dessert a subtle ginger taste if you eat it.   Though Fog Harbor can be considered a touristy restaurant to some, the food was still excellent. Thanks to the No1DP for another excellent eating adventure!",

I'm surprised at how bad the reviews here are, but speaking for the three dishes that I go back for, it really isn't so bad. \u00a0  I went back something like three weeks ago. \u00a0Sometimes it's nice to just wander around touristy areas for no reason, so we thought of heading to the city to check out the wharf. \u00a0I ordered the same dishes I always have and did not notice anything particularly off. \u00a0the boyfriend did not like batter of the fish, but i loved it. \u00a0i also liked how the calamari is light, though i ditch the cocktail sauce for the tartar sauce that comes with the fish n chips plate. \u00a0the chowder is always good but i feel like i've had better in other places around the bay.  it's good, but nothing ridiculously good. \u00a0i'd still come back if i ever had to wander around the pier are again. \u00a0that being said, the view of the water is very nice and the general ambience of the place bumps this up to like a 3.5, really. \u00a0good service too, considering it's a tourist joint.",

The drinks were good, although a bit watered down. Garlic bread was yummy, and the oysters were super good and flavorful. Crab roll was also delicious, the bread was nicely toasted, although the sweet potato fries were kinda cold when it got to our table. The lobster mac and cheese was pretty epic...at one point I found myself saying \"There's too much lobster in my Mac n cheese\".   Service was excellent. They also threw in a lava cake for the birthday boy! Overall it made for a really pleasant dinner.

It's our wedding anniversary last night and my husband want a special dinner for me. After reading so many positive yelp reviews, we decided to give it a try.  Food - we ordered seafood cioppino, fish n chips and Garlic roasted whole crab. 2 out of 3 are disappointing. The only dish which is really GREAT is seafood ciopino. The shrimps, scallops are very fresh. You can feel its original freshness even with the strong flavor soup. Highly recommended. For Fish n chips, the chips are ok but the fish is obviously overcooked and very very oily. The MOST DISAPPOINTING dish is our MOST PRICEY dish- garlic roasted crab. Once I cracked the shell and trying to take out the meat, from the meat texture, I could tell it's NOT FRESH. My husband verified that since he only tasted the garlic and butter from the crab NOTHING MORE! For me, it's even worse, it's completely tasteless, maybe with a little bit of garlic flavor. But we shouldn't pay $37 for garlic and butter!! We had crab several times before from Nick's Lighthouse food stand. We can tell the difference. Nick's crabs are so fresh and with minimal processing, no garlic no butter, the meat alone is already so tasty. Our conclusion is NEVER get CRAB at FISH House. Even the crab in the seafood cioppino is tasteless. From meat texture to taste, you can definitely tell the crabs are NOT FRESH!  Service- we are surprised to have ALL our dishes coming out AT ONCE. I don't know if that's standard practice for seafood restaurant or not. But to us, this is SO WRONG. After we finish fish n chips(the most time sensitive dish), the rest were already cold as ice. Besides that, the service is ok, not very attentive but will do when you ask.   Ambiance- the view is unbeatable, 5 stars.  Other- this's the first time I saw \"SF Emp Ord 4%\" from my bill.we paid anyway. I have no clue what the heck is that. After I google it, I felt like being scammed. Why should I pay for the restaurant employee's health insurance?!That should be the restaurant's responsibility! Does that mean they treat their employees like dirt so customers have to do what they don't to keep their employees live a normal life? They don't pay insurance, customers are obligated to pay for them. They pay waiters poor salary, customers have to pay a large sum to cover it(I DO think tips are necessary for rewarding good service, just don't like it when it become obligation even for poor service) And if that really helps the employees get better health insurance, I feel better with that. But according to Wall Street Journal, mostly are just scammer and go to restaurant. I don't know about this restaurant.  Conclusion-It's very unlikely we will return. If we do, we will NEVER order any crab again",

I think the problem with crab and acidity though is that the crab flavor just gets completely hidden. Entrees were not great. My wife got the mixed grill fish. The sauce was nothing like what the menu described - it was just missing. The fish was over cooked and dry. I had the seafood cioppino. The sauce tasted like canned plum tomatoes boiled briefly with some dried herbs and was over salted. The seafood was end piece leftovers. The only reason for the second star is service.

They had a small Valentine's special menu. It has a nice setting, very romantic feeling.  We were seated close to the window but then again it was dark already. I'm sure during the day it would have been a pretty view. We ordered raw oysters, baked oysters with spinach and parmesan, steam clams with veggies in light broth and also a bread bowl chowder to share as appetizers! Those are all just starters!   For my main course, I had the filet Mignon with lobster tail ( the whole reason why my boyfriend made reservations at a seafood restaurant was so that I can get my lobster! How sweet!) My boyfriend had the fried combo with consist of fried fish, fried calamari and fried shrimp. All the food we ordered was super delicious!

It's located in Pier 39, on the second level adjacent to the Eagle Cafe.  Outdoor lobby of the restaurant is nice as well as the interior--great view of the pier/ocean...  Customer service is great!  Our waiter served us complimentary sourdough bread while waiting for our food--I'm not that much of a fan of sourdough bread, but this bread was an exception, only cuz it came fresh out of the oven...  For appetizers we ordered the calamari (everytime I eat out with my bf, and if the restaurant serves calamari, we'll \u00a0order it!)...portion is enough to feed 2 people. Love the seasoning and breading of the calamari--texture of the calamari is perfect! Soft, easy to chew, not too firm...  I ordered the fried combo (beer battered fish,shrimp, more calamari!, and fries). Love the taste of the fries--tastes like BK fries, fish was yummy--batter wasn't thick, but thin enough and crispy. The shrimp seemed a bit overfried but whatever, and of course the calamari was my fave out of all of em.  Bf ordered seafood fetuccine. Says it's one of the best he's ever had.  Overall great experience...I'll be sure to come back here again!",

The sourdough bread is really delicious. Its served with ice cold butter though - I think its nice if the butter is a least warm enough to spread. I had the whole steamed Dungeness crab with fingerling potatoes and corn on the cob. I've had king crab legs many times, but a whole crab was a new experience. The crab meat was delicious but very difficult to extract from the body. The legs were typical and easier although much smaller in this type of crab. The potatoes and corn were fine. My husband had a seafood pasta dish and he thought it was good. He orders this type of dish often and said it was good but not great compared to other places. Overall, with the amount of seafood restaurants available to choose from, you can probably do better than this one.",

But when we got there, there were plenty of table available so...I don't know.  They sat us at a table with a view of the water and setting sun. Beautiful. Our waiter was...a rock star. I asked for a virgin strawberry daiquiri but they brought it with whip cream which I can't have. My husband took it and our waiter brought another one on the house. We ordered one of their appetizer specials, risotto and crab fritters. We didn't like it but didn't complain. Our waiter asked how we liked it and we were honest. So he said we could order something else on the house. Who does that!? Plus he didn't hover and wasn't distant. We gave him 20% tip.  We ordered the following:  Clam chowder - delicious! Crab mango ceviche - yum Crab risotto balls fritters - okay Lobster tail - yum Seafood Cioppino with pasta - yum  I would have ordered dessert if they had cheesecake.  I wouldn't mind coming back.

    "review_text": "Back in Maryland, where the Chespeake churns and the Old Bay Seasoning flows, the crustacean of the day is the blue crab. Here in San Francisco, the crab of choice is the stout Dungeness, a veritable wrestler versus the comparatively dainty, ballerina-esque blueies we have back where I'm from. Having had my fair share of crab in my life, devoured mostly with mallet and mini fork in hand mind you, I was ready to give the Dungeness a try.  After a long day exploring Fisherman's Wharf, a nice plate of crab cakes, some fries, and slaw just felt right. The restaurant was quickly becoming crowded so I felt lucky that my two friends and I managed to snag a window table. Tired and hungry, we were all happy to be greeted by a basket of steaming hot San Francisco Sourdough and softened butter. I've always appreciated the tart bite and hearty crust of a good sourdough in sandwich service, so the pure unadulterated experience of quality bread led us off on a good start. Hey, it's the little things in life that count. Soon thereafter, our food came out. I was greeted by a surprisingly ordinary plate of two smallish pan fried crab cakes, fries, and slaw. Unfortunately, the \"ordinary\" aspect seemed to be a theme as I began to eat my dish.   Strike one was that the crab cakes were merely warm and didn't seem terribly fresh. Furthermore, while I was hoping for delicious lumps of sweet crab, I instead got a pretty bland interior which tasted more of filler than crab. Whether or not it was indeed filler and breadcrumb I was tasting or it was the way the strangely finely minced crab was prepared that threw my tastebuds off is up for debate, but it was disappointing. While crisp on the outside, the inside was mushy and pasty. Luckily or not, since they were small, I didn't really have much to go through before it was gone. A truly great crab cake should highlight the quality and flavour of the crustacean that honorably served in its preparation, not of bread and onion. The fries were also a disappointment. While they were hot, they were devoid of seasoning. Unsalted fries are a sin! Why why why would you ever serve unsalted fries? Finally, the slaw and remoulade were inoffensive, which is to say, pretty unmemorable.   Moving on to the service and space, I should first point out that getting to Fog Harbor can be a little tricky. You must access it from the upper balcony level of Pier 39. Once inside, you're greeted by a nice dining space. It's open, the servers are dressed professionally, and if you get a window seat, you will be greeted by a beautiful view of the bay. Service was also good. Our server was quick, friendly, and readily agreed to split our check.   So why the two stars? Well, while the service and space were very good overall, I was disappointed by the food. My dish was bland, uninspired, and got literally beat out by bread and butter. In addition, later that night, my stomach really did not agree with what I ate. Considering I ate toast for breakfast that day, I think my cakes are the guilty ones here. I hope that I maybe caught Fog Harbor on an off day since others seem to really like this place. Unfortunately for me, it just didn't hit the mark.",

The popcorn shrimp was excellent as was the fillet Mignon and crab cakes. The prices were right on target for being in a high traffic tourist area. There were many high and low priced items to find a comfort level with.

    "review_text": "I visited the bay this past weekend for my birthday and decided to book a reservation here for lunch on the pier. I came in expecting delicious fresh fish, and I left feeling a little disappointed.  Having a reservation definitely helped because it was quite crowded and we only had to wait a minute or two. Our server was friendly and checked in on us just enough - not too frequently, and not too little. We got a free Blue Cheese Garlic Bread from checking in on Yelp, and it was so delicious! (Thanks, Yelp!)   After a pretty long wait, even with consideration of how many people were there, we finally got our food. My boyfriend ordered the Ahi Tuna, and it was cooked basically perfectly. His mashed potatoes were also pretty good. I ordered the fresh salmon, since salmon is my absolute favorite thing to put into my stomach. It was not as large as my boyfriend's tuna. It was like a little strip, which I wouldn't have minded if it wasn't over-grilled and burnt. The moist parts tasted good, but for the most part, it was very dry. The smokiness of the greens under the fish were good on their own, but as a part of this dish, it made everything taste overcooked and burnt. I wish I had ordered something else instead.  All in all, it's pretty good, but I'm not sure if I would come back again. Especially since I'm not a baller (lol) and the salmon was not as tasty as I had hoped.",

Our server was attentive and helpful while explaining about the dishes. We bumped into a friend while we were there and on his recommendation we got the Red Chili Prawns and a clam chowder bowl as appetizers. It was a hit! The prawns were fresh and the seasoning was a thai-like preparation. Oh so yum! I got their crab cakes for the entree, my husband got their mahi-mahi with citrus butter and a friend got their fish and chips. The crab cakes were good and crispy, slightly bread-ier ( if I may use that word ) for my taste but the meat was fresh. The remoulade sauce which came with it was nice too. My husband loved the mahi mahi which was so fresh and moist that it was melting in his mouth. The citrus butter sauce was light and refreshing, not too buttery which was good. The mango salsa which came with it complemented the white mahi-mahi well. The fish and chips had some really fresh fish but they could have done with some more seasoning like some more salt or some paprika. One of our vegetarian friends got their Spring Salad with the pomegranate dressing which was pretty well made. Overall we really enjoyed our lunch experience here and will definitely go back!",

We yelped this before we came to the pier and gave this place a try. I know they were busy and i didnt mind the wait for an 1 hour and a half. Luckily there was a lounge so my boyfriend and i were able to rest. When we were seated we thought we got the best seat because it was at the corner near the windows. We can see the fisherman wharf but on my right, people from outside can see us which was awkward. So the waiter was very sweet and was kind to take a picture of my boyfriend and I. Since I LOVE the picture so much, i had to give him a tip. So anyways, 1 star for the service. Food....however.... Was HORRIBLE. My boyfriend order the Surf and Turf, medium rare. Nope. It was well-cooked. Then he ask the waiter for a recommendation for a heavy wine. My boyfriend thought it was all right. Wasn't heavy for him, but everyone is different. So for my food. I order the Caesar salad (idk the full name but it's close to it). Maybe it was me, but I have never really experience not having my lettuce cut so i had to cut them myself. I asked for chicken too but they only gave me like 8 small pieces and 3 croutons.....I was upset. I had way better salad at other places. Other than that, if you love oysters, you gotta try the baked one. IT WAS DELICIOUS! +1 Star. If i knew it was that good, i would have ordered three instead of that salad -_- but nope. The osyter appetizer came after our dinner. But yeah i don't think i'll come back :l",

I had the crab roll - the restaurant didn't bother with a lot of fillers and they didn't skimp on the (dungeness) crab meat either. The wife ordered the crab salad - also very good: fresh ingredients, lots of crab, not too much dressing.  Service was efficient and friendly. We sat at a table with a fantastic view of Alcatraz.

We ordered the baked oysters to start because they resembled oysters Rockefeller which we love no matter what type of oysters they are. What came out was a weird cream based, over sauced oyster plate. I was ok with eating them until I got to the last one which was totally and completely rank! I'm not a huge oyster aficionado but not only did it taste as though the cute sea lions down the pier had pooped in them but it smelled totally stank (which I actually thought was either my servers breath or a fellow patrons unfortunate gas at first...a little harsh and I feel bad for ever thinking that but I never thought an oyster or any seafood for that matter could smell that bad) Ruined the rest of the meal...the only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because my Salmon entree, which was a special with veggies including Brussels sprouts which are some \u00a0of my favs, was pretty good after I sucked on a lemon, downed my entire water, and shot some tobacco sauce in attempt to get the bad oyster taste out of my mouth. Little did I know that would be the only water I would be offered throughout the rest of my meal...

The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of the lack of attention to detail. Out server was very friendly and brought us our water, after inspecting one of the glasses we noticed it had a couple \"floaters\"... We asked for a fresh water. The waiter returned with a smile and a \"fresh\" glass. After another inspection we noticed the 2nd glass has even more \"floaters\" than the first. We inquired for the 3rd time about a fresh glass of aqua, this time she assured it was clean... It was. I decided to quench my thirst with a Anchor Pear Ale, a fricken great beer! I took the etched glass in compensation for the dirty H20. Full belly and a cool souvenir in hand we left Fog House satisfied. Next time make sure your buss boy isn't using the water pitcher as a spit cup and there should be no problems.",

We were seated right away(arrived around 6 on a Friday evening) and had a wonderful view of the harbor, sea lions, and sunset. The view is undeniably spectacular.   I would have given Fog House five stars if our waiter had been a bit better, but I realize everyone has off days. Our service was less than prompt and our waiter seemed like he didn't have too much interest on our table. He seemed annoyed that we only ordered appetizer portions of whole crab.   It was a shame our waiter was such a goof because the food was delicious and simple (how I feel seafood is best).  We started with the steamed clams, I would bathe in the broth if I could. The crab was delicious and fun to crack open and eat, bib and all. \u00a0And no review of the Fog Harbor would be complete with out mentioning the clam chowder: it really was the best I've eaten here. Not too thick, clams so tender I almost couldn't believe they were clams.   All together, a great stop. For a bottle of Chardonnay, clam appetizer, three appetizer clams and three cups of clam chowder our bill was around $200, as a heads up.",

We requested a table near the window which the host granted us but then as we sat down, the manager came over, leaned over over the host at our table and admonished him something to the effect to check if the table was reserved in the future. During the course of our lunch, we noticed the manager being all over the staff, as discreet as tried, about every little thing. It was just horrible mgt and the place was horribly run. Our waiter, while a very nice man, was very inexperienced (which he admitted). Towards the end of our lunch, his inexperience became outright annoying as we had to raise our hands or flag down the staff for every need. We ordered clam chowder (very good), crab linguini (very rich, creamy, and not so good..you have to crack the crab to get the crab meat), and a crab sandwich (very greasy). Overall, the food was mediocre but the crab linguini was very disappointing. To top off our lunch, we were presented with the bill where they charged us a %3.5 surcharge to help the place cover their staff medical coverage. WTF? I've never seen this before. When we asked about this, our waiter said it was a new law which was complete bull crap. Anyway, save your money and go elsewhere.",

The food was great and our server David is probably the best waiter I have ever had the great pleasure to meet. He obviously loves his job and the interaction he is able to have with his guests ( and I mean guests, we were not just mere customers to him).   We started off with the Red Curry Steamed Mussels as appetizers with the fresh sourdough bread. My boyf is Sinhalese and knows his curries and he really liked this dish, I loved it!! \u00a0The mussels cooked perfect!  We then moved on to a special they were offering that day, steel head over cheese ravioli and cream sauce that was truly to die for and the Seafood Cioppino which again with the sourdough was very good.   We had a couple of the hot drinks from the bar that were good however when 1 turned out to be too strong for us we ordered something else and fully expected to pay for it and were pleasantly surprise to see it not on our bill.   Dont know when I will get a chance to visit San Fran again but u can be sure I will be stopping by here!!",

Its good for the appetizer and for the regular meal as well.  2. Ahi Tuna: a BIG chunk of tuna (Seasoned on the outside of course). It was laying on a bed of wild rice and sauteed vegetables with this light soysauce/teriyaki flavor that just added soo much flavor to the tuna. if you are a tuna fan, you will LOVE IT!!!   3. Fog harbor burger: My first \"sweet\" burger ever. This burger is so juicy and tender (i usually get it medium rare). the caramelized onions add such a bursting flavor into my mouth... and the saltiness of the bacon balances the taste.  4. Prawn ravioli: i usually get this w/CIOPPINO (type of tomato sauce) sauce on top. I've noticed that the raviolis change in size once in a while from small to big-- but no matter what the size is... this dish will forever be my favorite pasta dish at Fog Harbor.  5. Seafood Cioppino: This dish is VERY flavorful. I see alot of tourists trying out this dish but for me personally, i wish i could've just had all the seafoods out of its shell. I didnt even bother eating the crab legs because i didnt have tools to crack them with.. but everything else was easy to eat :)   The service is fantastic and the hosts are super friendly! :) :)   Oh and before i forget---  Dessert recommendations: Lava cake and tiramisu!!!! I love the creme bruele.. but the caramelized topping can be often too chewy for me.  ENJOY! hope this helped!",

Our waiter took our orders and was quick to bring out our food.   They started us off with some free bread which was surprisingly delicious, but after polishing those off, we ordered Clam Chowder in a bread bowl and some sort of sampler/combo dish which came with fish&amp;chips, calamari, and shrimp. The clam chowder was amazing, but the bread bowl it came in was pretty normal sourdough. The fish&amp;chips were delicious and the batter they used was flaky, but not too oily or crispy.

    "review_text": "I was impressed by the reviews and wanted to have some good seafood while in San Francisco, hence the visit to Fog Harbor. It was good but for the price I expected more. My fianc\u00e9 and I came for lunch on a Monday. I made reservations online, which was great because I probably changed the date and time at least three times. It wasn't too crazy during our visit and we were able to get a table overlooking the harbor, so four stars for that.   However, I'd rather have an awesome meal than a good view, and that's where the issue is. We shared a small bowl of claim chowder, a Blueberry Press cocktail, and ordered the fish and chips and a spring special, the Alaskan halibut. The clam chowder was very tasty although it didn't have as many clams as I'd hoped. But still very good. And with the crunchy sourdough bread? Yes, very very good. I ordered the skinny cocktail, which is some locally distilled vodka, blueberries, lemon, soda water, and Splenda. They gave me the regular by mistake, which has ginger beer, and I quickly noticed. The regular was very good and much better than the skinny (unfortunately he whisked the first one away rather than letting us keep it). But in neither drink could I really taste any of that locally distilled vodka, so three stars on that one since the drink was $12.50. For that price I should at least taste some vodka!  On to the main courses. The fish and chips came with coleslaw and fries and were very good. It had large chunks of well cooked and nicely battered (Anchor Steam) fish, but I would expect all of this for a price of $17. \u00a0I ordered the seared halibut, which came with quinoa arugula salad, tomato relish, pine nuts, and dried cranberries topped with a citrus buerre blanc and crispy leeks. The quinoa salad was delicious; it had a great flavor and the ingredients really went well together. But the main attraction, the fish, was a disappointment. It had a good texture but was lacking in flavor and was also dry. The presentation looked amazing but it fell short of my expectations.   Our server was courteous and prompt with the service and apologized twice for the drink mistake. Overall okay but I will try something else next time I visit the city.",

We were seated in about 40 minutes when we were told 20 minutes and after we ordered it was over an hour before our dinner arrived. The waiter and the manager came over to our table several times and apologized. We were starving and were not offered bread and my drink from the bar was never refilled. When our food finally did arrive my table mates ate very quickly and were done before I really even started on my pasta which turned out to be cold and flavorless. The 1/2 crab on top was divine, however. The three other plates were cleared before I even touched my food as I was waiting for our waiter or manager to come so that I could tell him. The manager apologized and brought me a chicken ceasar salad as I requested because I didn't want to have my table mates sitting watching me eat which would have made me feel very awkward. The manager ended up taking my meal off and giving us a discount because it took so long. My dinner the next day was great because I had the crab that I would have had with the pasta the night before. Everone else said that the food was good but they couldn't really tell because they were so hungry! The entire experience took about 2.5 hours with probably 5 minutes or less being taken to actually eat.  I will be back to try Fog Harbor again and I hope that I won't be going on a busy night.",

My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips which were exceptional! Wish I had ordered that instead. It's cooked to perfection!   I ordered a Long Island, which was sub par.

Practically no wait was resulting for placing order. Initial drink delivery was prompt. The wine or corkscrew and ice were delivered promptly. Another trip a Manhattan. Manhattan was made nice and stiff.  Food order was taken and again no really a wait from order point to arrival. We had a free garlic bread coupon to which the wait staff was happy to apply to the whole table of eight of us.   Food order included chicken pasta, and seafood (paired with seasonal vegetables). Both time the staff was able to serve the sides separately due to a seafood allergen with my woman.   A warm fresh side of bread is provided free. The free garlic bread was properly portioned for group enjoyment. Chicken pasta and fish were flavorful and filling. Seasonal vegetables were tender and good on their own.  Drink refills and staff were good to refill and check on the table.  Towards end of meal, check and bill were closed promptly.   Good: Flavorful food, refreshing drinks, great service. Best cork fee on pier.   Bad: nothing to date.   Overall four stars. I'll be back.",

All along the pier, it's hard to pick out a restaurant that will actually be good for the price you pitch (it's San Francisco, you've got to make every dollar count if you want to make it a few hours). Fog House Fish Harbor was one of our first choices because there wasn't a line in front, and the lobby looked welcoming (albeit overly dressed-up like a hotel, I'm not kidding)  We were seated immediately, but the crowd that occupied the restaurant would be daunting for any staff, and I knew right away that this would take awhile. High over the waterfront on the clear day to see the whole Bay, the view from anywhere in the room was fantastic. But even I got a bit bored waiting for the waiter (I'm hilarious).  We ordered two Sourdough Chowder Bowls and their Salmon Flatbread. The former didn't stand out to me, but it's getting increasingly difficult to tell the difference between the dozens [and DOZENS] of chowder-serving locations. The Flatbread wasn't shabby, but shabby doesn't cut it for $13.00 (it's four triangles...small triangles)  Better places for better prices, but perhaps their crab and lobster put up a better meal's experience.

I was looking for a delicious restaurant that didn't have a strict dress code. (I'm 8 months pregnant and don't have the widest variety of formalwear) ;)   We decided to try several appetizers, and then split a dinner instead. It turned out to be an excellent decision. The meal starts out with a perfectly prepared sourdough bread, it was so delicious. We had the calamari, I really enjoyed the dipping sauce and found it the batter to be delightfully crispy. My fiancee, didn't agree with the breading, as he prefers the light crispy kind. We also split the steamed mussels, they came in a delicious broth that was savory and delicious. We both agreed, these were absolutely amazing! We followed it with an order of raw oysters, and they were so fresh and delectable. They were a bit small, but the freshness and taste really made up for any shortcomings. We also shared a cup of clam chowder (how could we not?), and via others suggestion used the free sourdough bread in place of the bread bowl. We noticed a bar patron eating some amazing looking sweet potato fries topped with blue cheese, which you NEED to try because they are to die for! Upon further questioning with our waitress, there is a little happy hour bar menu that you should ask for if you happen to get the chance! For our main course, we split the cioppino. It was stocked full of delicious fish, crab, mussels, and shrimp, and featured a savory and thick tomato broth. It was really delicious, my fiancee found it to have too strong of a \"fish\" taste for him, but that's what made it awesome for me. For dessert we had the creme brulee, and it was perfectly caramelized on top, and creamy thick and fabulous... they really know their way around the dessert area!   The entire meal only set us back about $150 which was pretty awesome for location and the amount of food we ordered. Make a reservation and ask for a window seat, the view is beautiful.

After a long afternoon in the rain at Alcatraz we were STARVING when we got back around 3:30. I looked up trusty Yelp reviews that had been spot on for the last 5 places we ate. Considering this place had 4 stars and a bazillion reviews we thought it would be great! Well... It was just OK.  Our waiter took over 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink orders and by this time we knew what we wanted to eat.. then after another 5 minutes came back to confirm our drink orders and they didn't arrive for another 5 minutes.   Now we've been here 20 min with only glasses of water, did I mention we were incredibly hungry??!   The bread and drinks arrived and literally on top of that was the appetisers. Calamari was nice. However for a place that prides themselves in Crab Season - their crab cakes were shit. From Maryland and I work at a high end seafood restaurant, these crab cakes were not very nice.  Then we had burgers (I know it's a SEAFOOD restaurant but we wanted lunchy food) and they weren't very good. We didn't finish them.   Since we arrived during the lunch-dinner transition our waiter changed, but we got sort of lost in the transition where no one came by to check on us long after we finished. To the point that I stacked our plates myself to let them know we wanted our check!   Now, I am a server, I have high expectations for such a highly rated restaurant but I was disappointed by the service and quality of the food.",

Luckily, two seats opened up at the bar. our waitress was great, super sweet and took really good care of us. i can't remember her name but she works at the bar and has great make up :). so we ordered drinks, i had chardonnay and the bf had an IPA. we ordered calamri as an appetizer. th e calamari was good but the main event was the shellfish platter for one and the bfs surf n turn. needless to say it was more than delicious. my boyfriend absolutely loved his steak and i was in heaven with the fresh shrimp and awesome crab. the little corn on the cob that came along with it was great also. i'm by no means a professional when it comes to eating crab. i get all messy and stain my shirt but i don't care!!! needless to say it took me a while to eat the crab but it was sooooo good and i had fun. our tab came out to 150 but it was sooo worth it! the service was truly great.   since this place is super busy on the weekend, i strongly recommend reservations. next time we hope to get \u00a0a table by the windows. also the best parking has to be the pier 39 structure since it directly connects the third floor to the restaurant and they validate.   all in all, it was a great day in the city by the bay!",

I wasn't that impressed with most of the menu (nothing too original, Pier 39 pricesfare), the by the script service (nice, but felt like a standard spiel), or even the complimentary two glasses of wine given to my grandparents for their 60th anniversary. Nice gesture, but bringing just two when there were four of us at the table? Awkward. But drink up gparents!  All said, none of the above is what I remember most about eating here. That memory is saved for an outstanding cioppino. A ridiculous amount of seafood simmering in a perfect tomato broth. Sis and I got one to split, they were kind enough to bring it on two plates, and each half was easily enough for one person. It was simply fantastic, enough so to recommend coming here just for your own, and perhaps getting one all for yourself.  Just make sure to bring some extra champagne if you are celebrating. Cioppino all over yourself is awkward enough.",

Since we had the 20% off, we decided to try this place! And I'm SO glad that we did. \u00a0  We arrived around 2:30 and were seated right away. \u00a0There was a good amount of people in there, but it wasn't busy. \u00a0I loved the front entrance because it was very peaceful and elegant. \u00a0Once seated, I knew I wanted a Bread Bowl because that is what was highly recommended on Yelp (and it was only $9). \u00a0My boyfriend had the salmon that was stuffed with crab. \u00a0We were given a bowl of bread which was so good and I almost ate all of it until I remembered that I was also getting bread with my meal. \u00a0The view was gorgeous outside our window. \u00a0 \u00a0  My boyfriend ordered a chardonnay, and I want to say that it was the floor manager who helped him pick one out. \u00a0He was very knowledgable and helpful, and knew exactly what he was talking about. \u00a0We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. \u00a0This was a FULL plate too, it wasn't just a few pieces. \u00a0They really were generous, and it was delicious. \u00a0Our food arrived about 10 minutes after we got the appetizers. \u00a0Of course the bread bowl was delicious, and my boyfriends salmon was amazing! \u00a0The salmon wasn't dried out, and the crab was fantastic. \u00a0  The service is also good here. \u00a0The waiter checked up on us and had no problem when I gave him the coupon. \u00a0He also validated our parking which we didn't need (because you can't combine the 2 hr validation with 1hr of restaurant), but he did anyways! \u00a0  Also, one more thing: \u00a0my boyfriend and I have also eaten at crab house which is right next door. \u00a0And we loved that place as well, but if you want to save some money, you get quality food at a lower price at Fog Harbor! \u00a0We will definitely be coming here again soon.",

    "review_text": "Looking for a restaurant in the Wharf that wasn't a total tourist trap, but would satisfy my lady's desire for seafood, I found Fog Harbor through Yelp. We weren't disappointed.  The food was excellent, and service was stellar throughout. Our waitress was attentive without being a hovering presence, and took care of everything from corkage (it's only $12; you might do well to bring your own bottle) to dessert recommendations (more on this later--holycarp). When we asked for more lemon, she brought a plate of six nicely arranged wedges.   We started with the clam chowder in a bread bowl, which we shared. It was, as others have noted, creamy, full of clams, and not too salty. Of course you must not only dip the small wedge-shaped bread top, but also eat as much of the bread bowl as you can handle without jeopardizing your ability to put away dessert.   Next came a half-dozen oysters, raw on the half-shell, with cocktail and wasabi sauces. Despite being an aggressively openminded eater, I'd somehow never had oysters before. Without the benefit of further experience, I think it's safe to say this was a good place to start. The oysters tasted very fresh, nice and briny, with a much more pleasant texture than I'd imagined.  For the entree, I got the special salmon (stuffed with crab) and Em had the mixed grill (salmon, swordfish, and prawns). Again, everything tasted absolutely fresh. All the fish was cooked perfectly--my salmon was just opaque, tender-firm and flaky. The swordfish, which I don't normally like much, was juicy and delicious. If I must pick a gripe, I'd take issue with the mixed vegetables--they were overcooked (to my taste; some of the zucchini strips were completely soggy) and unimaginative, though still a step up from the simply steamed carrot, cauliflower and broccoli you'd find at many common seafood joints.   The dessert tray offered some interesting selections alongside a couple old standbys. In addition to the expected creme brulee and apple crisp, there was a pumpkin bread pudding, some kind of individually baked chocolate cake, and a pumpkin cheesecake. My girlfriend is currently obsessed with pumpkin to what's likely an unhealthy degree, so we got the cheesecake. Moreover, our waitress said it was to die for. She never lied--eating it was like biting into the spiced flesh of an angel, only sweeter and less sacrilegious. \u00a0  Two appetizers, two entrees, corkage fee and dessert came to just over $100. You can easily pay more for less in the heart of San Francisco's #1 tourist trap. If you're not on a budget, and you want to enjoy some well-prepared seafood with minimal frills and gimmicks, you might give Fog Harbor a try. We left thoroughly stuffed, and very happy.  PS: Parking is $7/hr in the nearby Pier 39 garage, but dinner will get you 2 hours free if you remember to validate (NB: I did not remember to validate).",

We had scallops on the half shell (probably not worth the money, but still good). My entree was delicious: mixed grill. Swordfish, salmon and shrimp all cooked to perfection. Delicious asparagus side and garlic mashed potatoes that were strictly okay. Fresh, homemade sourdough on your table is warm and soft and crusty and delicious. I also had their yummy tiramisu, apple crisp, and a skinny coconut ginger cocktail, all delicious!",

We started off sharing a couple of appetizers: Shrimp cocktail and crab cakes. Both were good!  Entree I had the Mixed Grill which brings Grilled Salmon, Swordfish and Shrimp and a garlic mashed potatoes. Everything was grilled perfectly. My favorite was the swordfish but the other two (and that mash!) were great too.  For dessert we had the chocolate bread pudding. Big enough that three of us shared and it was just the right way to end the meal.  Customer service was great. Our waiter accidentally switched up the wine orders and gave them to the wrong people.

I ordered the salmon entree - DELICIOUS, best salmon I have had in a long time, very fresh, prepared perfectly, and the wild rice was nice and flaky with bits of fresh herb also. \u00a0My partner ordered the Mixed Seafood entree, and that was great too - the calamari was delicious, deep fried, but not too greasy. \u00a0Their portions are generous - I was almost tempted to order the sourdough blue cheese/garlic bread, which sounds delicious, but I didnt, because I knew I would get stuffed on that before the meal came - I got stuffed on the entree alone! The views are great from this restaurant, and I really dont think there is a \"bad\" table in the entire place. \u00a0The bar area looks nice too - we ate lunch at the Bar one time, and I remember the nice Coffee Drinks they have. \u00a0So after 3 or 4 visits and no negative issues, I would say safe to take anyone here with no fear of feeling like \"gee, we've been here before and it was good\" and have regrets about saying this!",

You can tell that you're not being served premade food that has been sitting there for a while.  -Fish &amp; Chips ($17): YUM!! Very fresh. This reminded me of a 10x better version of the fish in McDonald's filet-o-fish (I'm a huge fan of that fast food sandwich). It came with a generous amount of fish, french fries, and cole slaw.  -Crab Roll ($19): The sandwich was a bit smaller than I expected, but it was amazing! The bread part reminded me of the outside of a grilled cheese, and the crab part was kinda like a dungeness crab salad. It also came with a side of sweet potato fries + more crab. -Clam Chowder in Sourdough Bread Bowl ($10): Comparable to Boudin's but I might like this one even more. -Garlic Roasted Crab ($19): I didn't try any of my dad's entree, but I'll include a pic of it. He said it was very tasty. -I also loved the free bread that we got before our meal. It was still super hot, fresh, and crispy right from the oven. WIthin 5 minutes, our table already finished the first basket of sourdough and had to ask for more.  Ambience -Right next to the water at Pier 39. We had a great view of the ocean, Alcatraz, and also the sea lions. -Cute, simple, classy -Nice fireplace outside in the front of the restaurant  Service -Great!! The servers here are all very friendly and helpful.",

It was not until the couple next to us asked for the HH menu did the bartender presented them with one. By that time, we were almost finished with our food.... Oh well. We should've asked ourselves. Additionally, the bartenders, while pleasant and personable, were not very attentive even though it was not very busy. Bustling doing other things than tending to their customers. Or maybe we were not given attention due to our low orders of alcohol. That could be it.   The food, nevertheless, was very good. I ordered the Salmon \"Club\" Salad after seeing the diner next to me eat the same dish. The salmon was moist and not too dry. I would definitely order it again... that is, if I decide to go back. Good service leads to re-visits. Take note, managers.",

I tried the 1/4 Crab Languini that you can ask to be out of the shelf for an extra $4. We had as well the Mixed Grill which looks to be a little bit small but good! And last but not least, the Clam Chowder in a Sourdough is priceless. Service 3/5: I never had perfect service at this place. There's always something that goes wrong, misunderstanding or takes time to bring the receipts to cite a couple examples. Too bad for a restaurant of that quality that the service isn't at that level as well.",

Our server was really sweet and patient. They have a delicious selection of appetizers, featuring many with crab, and the drinks were really good! (I had a pumpkin pie martini which was really good!)  We split the seafood penne pasta and the surf and turf, both of which I would highly recommend.

An hour and a half later we were still waiting. Someone in our party finally complained and we were seated. By that time 2 hours had passed and mind you we had kids in our party.

I am in San Francisco on business this week, and - due to the ridiculously high hotel prices down by the Moscone - staying near Fishermans Wharf. \u00a0We needed dinner, and picked this place. \u00a0Good choice, all things considered.  I ordered the Fog House Burger. \u00a0If you are going to put your restaurants name on it, it had better be good. \u00a0To be honest, I was expecting to be underwhelmed. \u00a0Let's face it, this place is in a tourist area and serves fish. \u00a0How good could it be? \u00a0Fortunately for me, this burger came out as ordered, with a perfectly toasted bun, caramelized onions and bacon on it. \u00a0The fixings (limp piece of lettuce, two slices of tomato and a couple of rings of onion) were ok. \u00a0The fries were hot and crispy, and they have malt vinegar (which I love on fries). \u00a0Overall, this was a well-executed burger, which surprised me.  My wife had the prawn ravioli. \u00a0We were expecting the prawns to be inside the ravioli. \u00a0However, the ravioli were cheese ravioli - tasty on their own. \u00a0The prawns were perfectly cooked, and the spinach was tasty. \u00a0The sauce was sweeter than expected, but very good. \u00a0My wife was mopping up the remains of the sauce with the supplied San Francisco sourdough (which was way too strong, as is normal).  If you find yourself down at Pier 39, you can do a lot worse than this place.",

Sorry...I aint one of those stuck up critics who gives a damn about a great ambience because I am one who makes the best out of any situation.  I guess when you walk into the joint.... its all stuck-uppie high class or whatever for tourists...but i ignored that fact since i just wanted some brew, good calamari, and a new spot to check out. Maybe it was just kinda dead for the night...(cuz it was a tuesday when we came through)...but i felt like I was sitting in the lower section of a Warriors game being too loud or something.   I was like..\"Oh..you think its okay that we laugh this loudly? It is okay to have a good time right?\"  I think it was appropriate because the bartender seemed to appreciate our company. She informed us we were different from the typical customers.   There are tables there for a sit down dinner and stuff, but I decided it be best to chill at the bar because I thought it would be more fun.   The bartender we had was really sociable and rocked a friendly smile...so she provided a comfortable atmosphere. She even made us one of her famous cong-cock-shong...the all so famous....PBJ. it was good...nothing strong..just smoov since we were knockin down 24oz pints of brew and vodka tonics on the side.   i'll definitely be back juan of these days. maybe when i feel like being pier 39 tourishy or something. \u00a0I dont ask for much in life if my satisfactions for calamri and brew are fulfilled...so i give this spot a five holy smackonlies. an extra hi pibe to the bartender. thanks.",

When you arrive you are greeted by a host or hostess and are told you can wait for your table in the outdoor patio area. This area is a great lounging set up complete with a table for your drinks and a beautiful waterfall for ambience. I was promptly seated even though the pier was quite busy and it was mid evening. One of the big attractions is a wall of windows that face the bay. This offers A great view while you enjoy your dinner. Our properly dressed waiter introduced himself and offered to get drinks and an appetizer for my family and I. We quickly received our refreshments and a wonderful bread basket accompanied with soft butter. Our calamari appetizer arrived shortly after that. Both the bread and calamari were excellent starters for our dinner. Our empty plates were taken and exchanged with our entrees of the night. My girlfriend had ordered the clam chowder bread bowl, I ordered the swordfish plate. The bread bowl lived up to its name, a classic San Francisco must. The sword fish was wonderfully cooked and served with delicious potato fingerlings and saut\u00e9ed shallots. Both plates expressed a wonderful presentation of placement and color. Unfortunately we were in a hurry and did not get to experience dessert. The staff at fog harbor seem well dressed and organized. I did not see many dirty tables waiting to be cleaned and reset. Our waiter promptly brought us our check and offered to validate it since we had used the parking garage. There was a problem with our ticket and it took longer than usual. He knew we were in a hurry so for our inconvenience he graciously discounted our bill. Excellent food, great ambience and attentive service is a recipe for a pleasant dinner.

Our lobster tails were not only overcooked and chewy, but also pretty small (not acceptable for $32 each + tax); Our broccoli was spongy and waterlogged.  The service was very fast but not really friendly and welcoming. We were ignored and our waiter also forgot to bring our wine. What a poor service there.  He quickly tried to apology while giving us the check to get a decent tip, very awkward.  This restaurant ruined our night and I would not recommend it, even to my worst enemy.",

I got a chowder bowl, which was okay at best. \u00a0You can honestly get better chowder by walking down the wharf a little bit and getting it from one of the stands.  I also got a seafood pasta dish which was good but definitely not memorable (probably why I can't even remember exactly what it's called).  I think I spent like $45 total with a beer on top of those 2 dishes so this place is definitely not on the cheap side.  In the end, it's basically one of the touristy spots, and you should only expect as much. \u00a0If you have to, then it's an okay choice, but it wouldn't be my first choice, or second, or third...",

I ordered a warm spinach salad and swordfish. The swordfish was moist and delicious on a bed of ratatouille. My husband had the ahi tuna and he was shocked at how perfectly it was done. We have barbecued ahi tuna at home and there's no way he could reproduce what he had that night. The service was stellar and the staff were very accommodating as they put us at the bar even though we didn't book ahed of time. We were able to enjoy a full meal at the bar. It turned out to be a great way to meet people, too! We really enjoyed the spectacle of basil martinis being made - basil leaves were crushed with a glass pestle in a thick glass filled with ice cubes. They seemed to be a popular drink!  Highly recommended to anyone visiting Fisherman's Wharf!",

We took a seat at the bar and were quickly attended to with menus. The female bartender said the bread dough is from Boudin's Bakery, who supplies it to all the restaurants. What's special about their sourdough is that the water used comes from the bay.   We ordered the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. Boy, it sure hit the spot! The base was nice and creamy with a good amount of clams. We polished off that bowl, so the bf asked for another cup.

We ordered chowder to share, and husband went with fried shrimp platter.   \u00a0DON'T do what we did. \u00a0We soooooooo ordered wrong. \u00a0After a couple trips to the restroom which enabled me to see all the awesome food here, all I can say is DON'T order what we did. \u00a0 Order ANYthing ELSE. \u00a0   \u00a0Chowder was okay, decent and husband's fried shrimp was okay. My crabcakes were two giant FRIED cakes of lots of filler. Sooooo NOT what I wanted. \u00a0But again I blame myself. \u00a0The server had steered me in a different direction and I (stupidly) didn't listen.    \u00a0Sadly, we left feeling like we had totally ordered wrong, had not had that terrific San Fran seafood experience, and must come back and redeem ourselves next time.   \u00a0Do try this place...most importantly DO listen to the server for recommendations, and follow their advice. \u00a0Otherwise, you might have a pricey ($62 before \u00a0tip) lunchtime mistake like we did.",

The views ARE great - we looked out onto the boats at the pier and Alcatraz in the distance. The service was a bit crap - absentee and completely non-engaging or interested; Lizzie noted that the other tables were getting much friendlier service. The food was solid. \u00a0Is it expensive? \u00a0I dunno, the prices seemed pretty standard for SF prices to me, especially given its waterfront location - everywhere with views is a little pricier. \u00a0If I recall it was almost $90 for the three of us - we didn't order that much food, but did have wine. Three of us split a bottle of Pinot Grigio and shared our food. \u00a0Originally, we were all going to order the exact same thing - the halibut with herb butter, wild rice and veggies, which is why I had to branch out a bit. \u00a0I ordered the chili garlic prawns which were fight over worthy. \u00a0We must've eaten an entire loaf of the nice hot sourdough bread they give you just sopping up all the broth to be sure we didn't miss any of it. \u00a0I also got the spinach salad which was totally skippable. \u00a0 Liz did not like her fish, rice or veggies and left a bit unfulfilled. \u00a0Mel and I however seemed more into it. \u00a0I actually thought it was pretty damn tasty and ate all of my share with no problem - the fish was cooked perfectly, the rice was a good texture and the veggies weren't swimming in oil or butter and were also cooked well. I would absolutely eat here again and I really think it's an excellent bet for any tourists in the area. \u00a0Just keep in mind that entrees are $20-$30 - McDonald's pricing it is not, but it's totally in line with SF and a waterfront property at that. \u00a0Also, try not to have a heart attack at the 3.5% health surcharge which is much higher than most other spots in the city.",

Unfortunately, there were a ton of people at Pier 39, and every restaurant had a wait time of at least 30 minutes. I think Bubba Gump had a wait time of nearly an hour? We ended up choosing this place since it looked pretty nice, and the wait was only 15 minutes.  To be honest, I don't remember exactly what either of us got, but I remember the food being okay. I think we probably both got a fish entree dish. Will update this if I happen to go again sometime. The view was pretty good, and so was the service.",
