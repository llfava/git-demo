We were going to eat at 2 separate places for the items, but found this place served both and had good reviews so we went here instead.   We started with the clam chowder in a bread bowl and the crab cake risotto fritters. The clam chowder was delicious, best I've tried. As someone stated in the tips below, just get the soup because they serve bread and butter for free, so our bread bowl was pretty much left un-eaten. The crab cake fritters were amazing as well. It was so much food so we shared the fish and chips. Fries were good, but the fish was underwhelming. The fish itself was flaky and light but the batter was unseasoned and made the whole thing just bland. I didn't care for the tarter sauce or cole slaw either.   Overall, pretty good! I'd come back just for the clam chowder.",

These were slightly disappointing, was hoping for crispy hot fritters and received this lukewarm, kind of soggy conglomeration of crab and risotto. Also got a moscow mule and bowl of cioppino - the moscow mule was standard (a little weak), and this was my first venture into ordering cioppino, after tasting others' at different restaurants and really liking it. This one was very solid in quantity of seafood, with lots of crab, scallops, shrimp, clams and mussels, which made it a delight to eat. However, I think the seafood might have been cooking a little too long, because the scallops were near disintegrating and the crab tasted straight up like the broth. So, the seafood was fresh and plentiful, but the seafood all tasted the same, as if it had been boiling in the broth together for a long time. Shrimp and mussels were the highlight, they seemed to be have cooked properly and still had some firmness. The broth was simple and tasted like tomato soup, though some salt and pepper brought out the flavors well. Also, wanted more than a small sliver of garlic bread! Waitstaff was friendly.  Overall, very much enjoyed the meal, but there were a few things that stood out as pieces that could easily be improved upon.",

It turned out to be serendipitous. \u00a0We live in the North Bay and come to the City often. When it comes to restaurants, we are nothing but a bit jaded. That said, we had a splendid meal at Fog Harbor. Instead of a main course, we ordered several items listed as starters because that gives exposure to more dishes especially when there are only the two of us dining.  We started with the fried calamari which was served with a lemon aioli for dipping. The dish was all rings, no tentacles. The batter was light, something like you would expect to find in a very good tempura bar. We also had the sliders, the crab cakes and the red curry mussels.  The sliders were great. Cooked perfectly (medium rare) and smothered in caramelized onions. My wife loves crab cakes and pronounced them as good as any she has ever had. I'm not much of a crab cake lover, but I thought they were good. I will never love crab cakes, so don't take my word as gospel.  Then I had the red curry steamed mussels. I am a mussel fanatic. I've eaten them over half the world, particularly in Belgium (where mussels is the national dish), and I can honestly say that these are the most delicious steamed mussels I have ever had. These are not the red curry mussels you will find in Thai restaurants. You are going to have to try them to see what I mean. By the way, although listed as a starter, there were enough for a main dish, especially when accompanied by Fog Harbor's terrific sourdough bread which is made on site.  I asked the restaurant manager for the mussels recipe, but he couldn't comply. I then emailed the company and was sent the recipe by one of the senior execs. That is service above and beyond.  By the way, we were there during happy hour, and were able to enjoy a very good house Pinot Grigio for $5/glass - an added bonus.  Fog Harbor is located at Pier 39, a venue most locals associate with tourists and would not normally think of as a place to go for fine dining. Wrong. \u00a0Fog Harbor is considerably better than most of the famous places in the Fisherman's wharf vicinity. To make matters even better, with the appropriate coupon (available everywhere in the City) you can park free, a huge benefit in San Francisco where parking fees are equivalent to winnings in the Powerball lottery.",

This was nice but not out of this world great.   Overall the restaurant is lovely with gorgeous views especially on a clear beautiful day. Service was top notch. The missing star is for the food. Although good, I think it could be a bit more flavorful.   4 stars along for the fact that they validate for the garage across the street. Saved me over $20!  I love the City and this is a nice place among the touristy trap terrible restaurants on Pier 39. \u00a0It's worth a try just for the validation!",

For a party of three on a Sunday, the wait was minimal which was a plus.   For the food, my table ordered the seafood cioppino, seafood penne, fried calamari appetizer and the Moscow mule. Seafood cioppino was above average. More of a soupy tomato cioppino vs a stew like many places. Generous helpings of properly cooked mussels, clams, crab, scallops, shrimp and fish. Just wish the flavor was a bit stronger instead of resembling a tomato based seafood linguine. I'd say sotto mare was better. The seafood penne was very well done. Fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was perfect, paired extremely well with the sourdough bread which was some of the best I've ever had. Soft center and flaky crust with chew. The calamari was well fried and flavorful, but the lemon aioli was very plain. The Moscow mule was watered down like crazy and might as well have been ginger ale mixed with water.   The service for this restaurant was disappointing considering its a tourist trap. My server failed to give me plate/silverware, bread and water refills requires multiple requests and drink came 15 minutes late. Expected a lot more and there wasn't even an apology for lack of plate and utensils.   I would probably not return based on the overall dining experience but the food was definitely some of the best of pier 39.",

As walk-ups on a slowish Tuesday night we were seated way in the back far from the scenic window view. Ok, fair enough. We liked but didn't love the lobster Mac and cheese. We liked the creamy clam chowder. The broth for the steamed clams was dull, and the panko encrusted scallops served with jalape\u00f1o aioli were a deep fried mess.

Before anything, Jennifer A.'s tip caught my eye: \"First, go to the visitor's center also on the upper level and get a 15% off coupon for this place.\"  Despite its touristy location, Fog Harbor delivered a DAT meal that was surprisingly delicious and affordable. I would definitely recommend making a reservation through OpenTable because it was packed on a Saturday evening.  Our table was started off with complimentary sourdough bread and butter, which is always appreciated.  For the appetizer, I opted for the AHI TUNA POKE, which is marinated raw tuna, avocado, mango, and a sesame-soy sauce and wasabi aioli (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Y5MO3qA68Z4v6MvKgGl9ZQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). It's normally $16 for their full serving, though we only got a poke pile rather than the poke slices shown in other pictures. The tuna is decently fresh, the mango is refreshing (though not very ripe), the avocado is smooth (also not very ripe), and the aioli ties it all together.  My friend chose the BAKED OYSTERS as her appetizer, which came with 4 fresh shucked oysters topped with spinach, bacon and a creamy parmesan sauce (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). Each oyster is normally $2.50, and she enjoyed the rich flavor of each one.  For entrees, one friend decided on the SEAFOOD CIOPPINO, which is crab, fresh fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels stewed in a tomato herb broth served with pasta (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#2AAhYWe5iBS33VciM-7V5g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). It's a hefty portion normally priced at $30! She said that her favorite part of the dish was the crab. Her boyfriend ordered the CREEKSTONE NY STEAK, a 10 oz steak grilled and topped with whisky peppercorn sauce, served with garlic mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed vegetables (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#3MgOxfwSYmu_cBpmwqcQnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). It was also a generous portion, normally priced at $27.  I chose the GRILLED SALMON, a fillet served on a bed of roasted corn, arugula, red peppers, fingerling potatoes, and tarragon with a citrus beurre blanc (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Of8IrIHQdLcfmBdpixj99A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). Normally $28, the salmon dish is worth it. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and moist the salmon meat was, especially given how often I've been underwhelmed by salmon dishes. But, goshdangit, Fog Harbor did it right. *snaps*  As our desserts, we each ordered something different:  The VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE, a smooth, creamy custard with caramelized sugar top and a Biscoff cookie, normally $8.50 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#n77J_bT5cjGss76X1FdSPw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). My favorite, hands down. I tend to avoid cr\u00e8me brulees because past ones I've tried have had sugar tops that were way too thick and overpoweringly sweet and sticky. But the sugar coating is delicate, allowing the custard to really shine through. If you're a fan of egg custard, especially subtly sweet custard, you'll be a fan of their cr\u00e8me brulee.  The MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE with a rich creamy chocolate center, served warm with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, normally $8.50 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#W-e5gxE978hMPMfp1k7nDA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). Many reviewers have complained that this isn't a true molten cake because the inside doesn't ooze melted chocolate, and I would have to agree--it's just a warm, gooey chocolate center. The vanilla bean ice cream is tasty, and I liked that the chocolate cake wasn't overly rich since it paired well with light, fluffy whipped cream.  The CHOCOLATE BANANA BREAD PUDDING, a huge square of Fresh Boudin's sourdough bread baked with chocolate pudding, served warm with cr\u00e8me anglaise and vanilla ice cream (most similar to the pumpkin bread pudding, normally $8.50) (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dYa4c4vsHCPEF7PxSyRxjQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>). I asked for the cr\u00e8me on the side because I didn't want it to soak the bread (not a huge fan of soggy bread). The cr\u00e8me itself is very light and was fun to dip, and the banana and sourdough undertones make for an intriguing combination. However, the chocolate is so rich that it overwhelmed even my sweet tooth...ridic.  All in all, I would recommend the GRILLED SALMON entree and the VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE dessert. Don't forget the 15% coupon!",

We decided to sit at the bar instead of waiting for a table. Our bartender/server was very rude. I am not sure if she was having a bad day or what but working with the public she needs to work on her people skills.   We put in our food orders and beer. After we got our beers we were delivered fresh warm sourdough bread. The bread was what dreams are made out of. I knew this place had promise.  Our food came out in a decent amount of time. Meaning I still had one slice of bread let to enjoy with my meal. The greedy monster didn't completely come out. I ordered the salmon club salad and it was good. I was surprised not to be asked how I wanted my salmon cooked as I normally order it rare. It was tasty but not worth the cost.  My husband ordered the fried combo that included fried fish, calamari and shrimp. I had a taste of the fish and calamari which was decent. However my husband wouldn't part with the shrimp because they only gave him two. Wtf??? The two sides were the traditional fries and coleslaw.   Overall the food was decent but seemed overprice. I guess not overpriced per the location but I would considered a bread bowl at boudin or a food truck next time.",

It was topped with a wasabi aioli and fresh ginger. They complimented each other really well. Noir server Dirk was friendly and very attentive for us being a group of 11. It was nice that he didn't have a problem splitting our check. My husband and I will definitely be back. Looking forward to trying more yummy seafood dishes! :D",

Well, we stumbled across fog harbor and when I told the hostess, Denise, how many people were in our party (4) she said the wait was 10 minutes. Then I said \"oh! We also have a baby but she doesn't need a highchair (baby's 6 months and was in her stroller). Denise then proceeds to tell me \"oh, well it's a longer wait then...it's kind of an inconvenience to be honest for us to have highchairs and strollers in here.\" At that point, my father heard Denise, and said \"umm..okay, we won't eat here then.\" Without apologizing or ANYTHING, she just didn't say anything and started talking to her coworker next to her. She was so rude and disrespectful I couldn't believe. I then asked to speak with a manager who didn't know her left from right. We ended up leaving and going to crab house on the wharf where all staff were sooooo nice and friendly and were sweet to my niece. Word of caution...don't eat here, check out crab house right next store for sure!",

After waiting 30 minutes we were brought to a very nice dinning room area that overlooked the water. Ordering the calamari to start with a coupon that is provided by the visitors center and to eat my son got the Mac and cheese, my wife got a custom designed linguine with garlic crab dish and I ordered the crab ceviche (avocado, mango and fresh pulled crab meat).  The calamari came and I was worried about the other items we ordered. It was not awful, but tasted like any other frozen squid with breading and very little seasoning which was a little over fried. I even sampled the \"aioli\" which is really become just a new way for a restaurant to put mayo in a ramekin and call it something cooler. That being said it did not help much and I was not looking forward to the meal.  Then the waitress came with a basket filled with sourdough bread and it was exceptional. Did not ask for it, but the timing was perfect and just as we enjoyed our first piece the good bread... The food arrived-  My ceviche was amazing! The quality of the seafood is evident on the first bite and I felt like the combination of flavors that was more than I expected. The avocado was very flavorful and the mango was such a mild taste that all together it was a perfect mix. I cannot say anything bad about this dish except it was an appetizer and wish I ordered two.  The linguine was cooked with garlic, sun dried tomatoes, spinach and garlic crab meat. It was actually from the chicken penne pasta sub crab and linguine. This was a great way to try some fresh crab meat and the way it was pulled and placed on top of the pasta you could have some crab in every bite. The sun dried tomatoes played a great supporting role of adding color and a great finish to every few bites that were lucky enough to have some in it.  Lastly was my sons Mac and cheese. I never find it worthy of saying much about kid items, but this macaroni and cheese was gourmet and the steamed broccoli about as fresh tasting as can be.  This was a great final bite on our visit to San Fran! We will be back!!!",

Tip: to get to Pier 39 from Caltrain, just walk to the BART track, pay $2.00 and ride it to Embarcadero. Then get off and walk to the F Street car, pay $2.00. Your other option is to cab there for $12.50 each way.  On to Fog Harbor Fish House:  Good value for large parties.  We did the prix fixe, \u00a0for starters every four people were served a platter of yummy calamari perfectly deep fried, cheese toast with fine blue cheese and a small plate of prawns sauteed in a spicy hot marinara (V. good). Next, you get a salad of a few leaves of high quality romaine lettuce with creamy blue cheese or, you can have a white clam chowder. The main entree is either salmon, new york steak, or braised chicken, comes with sauteed zucchini's and pearl onion. Mashed potato's and a dessert of lava cake or tiramisu. $38.00  I had the NY steak, cooked medium, it was tastey, if a bit skinny at 1/2 inch thick cooked. \u00a0The excellent romaine salad comes with four pieces of lettuce with a creamy blue cheese dressing; it was perfection. The mashed potatoes and sauteed zucchini were ok. \u00a0  For dessert, I chose their lava cake: it was very chocolately,&amp; moist n' sweet on the inside; it was served with a side of vanilla ice cream drizzled with more chocolate. A sprig of mint leaf added to the sensation.  My friend had the salmon and it looked phat, well over an inch, about 6 inches by 6 inches. She said it was delicious.  Their coffee was very good: black and delicious.   Decent appetizers, entrees and desserts. I just figure you are paying a very reasonable $33.00 for the food and $5.00 for an excellent water front view, fine linen and silverware. I had to ask for my coffee to get refilled. Ditto for water.  Bathrooms: clean and modern.  Customer service: a bit slow.  Ambience: very nice, trad. American.  Tip: from the BART at Embarcadero, walk upstairs and look for the train tracks and hop on the F Street Car, to Pier 39. Just $2.00  Tip: due to the deluge, we cabbed from Pier 39 to CalTrain at King/4th, it was $12.50 without tip.",

They did comp up for those, \u00a0but still...gross! My dad actually spit his out. The food was mediocre tourist trap at best. But I guess what can you expect in the heart of pier 39.",

I also thought the fake dessert sample plate that they show you instead of the dessert menu was a bit tacky for a pricier restaurant.  the service was good... food was hit or miss.",

I have to admit that my meal at Fog Harbor Fish House was just as tasty as some of the local hotspots i\"ve tried. And the view of the pier was also quite lovely.  Our waiter was eager to please and when he thought he had mixed up my wine with a colleague's wine I thought he was going to have a slight heart attack. He apologized about 80 times and bought us some delish chocolate banana bread pudding (yuummm) for dessert. \u00a0We didn't even care about the mixup, but we're never ones to say no to free dessert.  However, before dessert comes apps and entrees. For apps we ordered the crab ceviche and shrimp cocktail. The crab ceviche itself was pretty tasty, but they were pretty skimpy with the chips that came with it. 4 total chips for our group of 5! The shrimp cocktail were a bit wimpy looking, especially for SF where I've had some incredible seafood, but they still tasted good.  My entree was incredible. I ordered off the special menu for the night. Pesto halibut that came with mozzarella cheese, figs and some other delicious goodies on the side. \u00a0This was the best fish I remember enjoying in a long time. Hopefully they'll be adding it to their main menu!  I'd definitely go back during my frequent trips to SF and may even drag some local friends with me next time!",

Fried Calamari: I was disappointed that there were no tentacles. They were cooked properly but the breading was unimaginative. Not bad but not great.  Blue Cheese Bread: very rich and delicious.  Most of us ordered some fried seafood. I had the combo and others had the fish &amp; chips. The fried fish is excellent: beer battered, tender and juicy. I also really enjoyed the fried shrimp. They were butterflied and cooked perfectly with a nice panko coating. The disappointing thing was that I only got one piece of fish and two shrimp and a big pile of calamari. The fries were standard.  My brother ordered the Cioppino. I got to taste it and it was very good. I've had lots of cioppino since moving to the area and I'd say this is one of the best around.  To sum up: I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a good meal on Pier 39. Skip the calamari and the fried seafood combo (because of the calamari) but try the fish &amp; chips, shrimp &amp; chips, or the cioppino which were all excellent.",

Located at Pier 39, the restaurant is surprisingly fancy schmancy with a very weekend-at-the-Hamptons vibe; it was lunch time and every table had wine glasses. We were seated at a U-shaped booth with a nice view and the ambiance made us feel as though we could've been anywhere -- Newport Beach, Maine, 1990s SF.  I was in the mood for something sweet so my girlfriend and I asked for a dessert menu while my friend ordered the clam chowder bowl ($8) he wanted. Our server came back with a tray filled with all the various desserts they offer. Impressive and such a cool way to show what's on the menu! My friend's clam chowder was fresh, tasty, and filled with clams. The bread bowl it was served in was just as tasty as the chowder. My Blondie with vanilla ice cream was a large enough dessert for two, but I managed to finish it myself. It was that good.  Fog Harbor is a classy place I wouldn't mind visiting again for a nice lunch, snack, or dessert with family or friends.",

Like everywhere else I ate in my San Fran trip, we read reviews and wanted to go to the best places. The interesting thing was that we had a reservation but other people got seated before us. We were right on time and the other people were walk ins. We also went to grab a drink at the bar while we waited and a tiny drink had a hefty price tag of $15. Not to mention it took the entire 15 minutes while we waited to get the drink.  We finally got to our table and sat there for 10 minutes before we got menus, water, or any kind of service or attention. Finally a gentlemen came up and greeted us and asked us what we wanted. By that time we were ready to just order anything and get out of there. We got the blue cheese bread that was available for free if you checked in on yelp. I ordered the crab cakes and my boyfriend ordered the Surf and Turf.   A couple minutes later we were greeted by our actual server, and you could tell he was a bit flustered. He apologized and definitely made up for the horrible experience that we had had up until that point. He was really relaxed and gave us great recommendations on local spots to check out and go out and have late night drinks at.   I wish this place was the 4-5 star rating experience that I see most people have, but maybe we just got \"lucky\" and it was an off night for the crew.",

I wouldn't go so far to say that this is the best seafood I've ever had but it's been my go to place for seafood in SF. You want to make sure to book a reservation a day or two in advance unless you're ok with having dinner at 4:00. The reason I took off a star is that although the staff is friendly they're pretty inexperienced. They're going to forget to bring you water. And bread. And that extra lemon you asked for 15 minutes ago. It's a fact. No matter which server you get. But if you're patient and persistent enough you will eventually get those things and your order. Last time we were there I told them on the reservation that it was our anniversary so they decorated the table with flowers, a candle, and they wrote happy anniversary on the paper table cloth. It was really sweet and I enjoyed that extra care.",

The salad was refreshing and tasty! \u00a0They use mixed greens, unlike the other competitor with their iceberg. \u00a0  The clam chowder was outstanding! \u00a0It had a real good amount of clams in it. \u00a0It was very hearty and filled me up. \u00a0Mama dukes had it in a bread bowl and I ordered the regular bowl, which was fine because they serve more than enough complimentary sourdough bread.  The crab &amp; shrimp sandwich was a little too bland for my taste though. \u00a0I think it needed a little more flavor to it. \u00a0Perhaps salt? \u00a0  Our server was a sweetheart. \u00a0Kept checking up on us and he looked like Liam Hemsworth. \u00a0A total plus!

To be fair, the presentation of the fish was pretty well done (heh).

So we came to Pier 39 walked around a bit, and said screw it. \u00a0Let's just ask them how long the wait is. \u00a0If it's longer than expected, we've already made reservations anyways. \u00a0So we walk up to the restaurant and their layout is quite cozy and warm for those who have to wait. \u00a0They have a nice little fireplace that will keep you warm because everyone knows Frisco can get quite cold. \u00a0So anyways, I ask the young woman at the podium about the wait time, and suggested I would like a window view. \u00a0I didn't expect it to be available considering it's around 6-7ish. \u00a0She took me by surprise and said, we are currently cleaning the table right now, and it's window view. \u00a0We sat down for like literally 2-3 minutes boom, here comes our waiter--let's go! \u00a0Omg, the view was amazing, I mean of course, I'm a sucker for scenery, but damn. \u00a0We sat towards the back, window view of the hills and the bridge, to the left was Alcatraz. \u00a0Perfect.   Our waiter was Shawn, absolutely amazing. \u00a0Very fast pace, generous, and helpful on the suggestions. \u00a0My brother thought differently, felt although he could have been more helpful. \u00a0So.. Maybe I was more excited on eating than service. Who knows!  OK, food: \u00a0Quite expensive if you ask me, but was it worth it? Yes and no. \u00a0Some of the items, you can go out to the fish market and get it for cheaper. \u00a0But how it was cooked, well.. Stay tuned.  1/2 Oysters: \u00a0Mini oysters was what it was really. \u00a0The sauce they had made was delicious, I don't remember what it was, but I have pictures. Haha! Foodie! \u00a0It was placed over some ice to keep it cool, which everyone should place raw fish over ice, if you don't... Ugh...  Crab Cakes: \u00a0Oh my, these were so good. \u00a0They were going for $16, only two pieces, which I felt kind of ripped off. \u00a0I cannot deny it, they were bomb! \u00a0Once in a while, yes worth the $16. Lol, I'm all for cheap eats.  Bread Bowl: \u00a0Personally, I feel although they were better than Boudins. \u00a0I had Boudins down the street where you had to get it via cafeteria style and I am not a fan. This bread bowl was much smaller though, but you could taste the clam chowder better. \u00a0Not too much breading either, just enough to distribute.  Fog Harbor Burger: \u00a0Made was Angus Chuck Patty was quite amazing. \u00a0Definitely cooked to perfection without asking. \u00a0Medium rare, but not too rare that it made you feel weirded out to eat it. \u00a0They got it down as far as burger goes.  Fog Harbor 1/2 Lobster/Crab Meat: \u00a0Ok... This was quite disappointing. \u00a0This was their current specialty on the menu, and I honestly felt like I should have just gotten a full damn lobster tail. \u00a0The crab meat was just baked crab. \u00a0Nothing special about it. \u00a0They charged me a little more than just the lobster tail. \u00a0I prefer the lobster tail so much more than to order this again.  Fish and Chips: \u00a0Fried to a golden texture, very delish. \u00a0On point \u00a0Not much I can really say, I didn't really eat it. \u00a0My boyfriend ordered it. :P Sorry guys  Overall my experience was great. \u00a0The best part was that I got to see the sunset, and oh yea, even if you're not facing the window, there are mirrors so you can reflect the image. \u00a0I sat right in front which had the perfect view. \u00a0I loved it.",

We went for dinner so it was packed but we had a view of the harbor during sunset and it was ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. We could see Alcatraz Island too and the ambiance of the restaurant was really fancy (at least to my poor ass) for somewhere meant for tourists.   For our drinks we ordered the non-alcoholic Blackberry Press and Strawberry Basil Nojito and both drinks were super super sour and I will probably stick to just water next time.   The bread was really fresh, warm and fluffy and tasted great with the butter. We ordered a second helping.   My friends ordered the chicken penne (it was pretty good) and the sole (really soft and flavorful) and I split the whole dungeness crab.   I am going to say right now I am not a fan of crab due to my past experiences with suffering cracking it open and how bland and dry the innards usually were, BUT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. It was super moist and had a strong distinct crabby flavor. There was lots of meat available, thus making the tedious process of cracking it open totally worth it. Easily the best crab I've had in my life. The potatoes that came with the dish were kind of greasy and mediocre at best.   The meal ended with a free Biscotti cookie which I thought was neat.   Definitely worth it for the crab and bread, but next time I'll skip out on the drinks and pray for a shorter wait time.",

In my case at Fog Harbor Fish House, it actually wasn't all bad.   Even on a warm San Francisco day, a sourdough bread bowl of hot clam chowder was one of the tastiest things I ate during my trip. For $10 you can have your fill of a comforting bowl of creamy chowder with real chunks of clams and slices of celery. Unfortunately I also gave the salmon flat bread a try, which was disappointing because of its strong fishy flavor.  Although the place was packed for lunch, the service was decent.   The clam chowder is certainly Fog Harbor's forte. If I were to return here on another visit, I'd to mix it up by trying either their plate of fish &amp; chips or calamari and chips.",

We stopped at Fog Harbor since our Aquarium of the Bay ticket allowed us to get 15% off the bill. Additionally, since it was on the second level, the view of the bay was fantastic. The inside was very nicely decorated and had plenty of seating.   We were seated right away and our waitress was quick to greet us and answer any of our questions. We had a tough time deciding what we wanted to eat, but our waitress had some good advice and offered her favorite dishes. For drinks, we both ordered the Alcatraz Escape. This drink was super tasty and my husband is still raving about how delicious it was. The drink was very tropical with orange and pineapple juices with grenadine, coconut rum, and a float of dark rum. I would definitely order it again.   For lunch, my husband ordered the whole dungeness crab with garlic. This thing was huge! It was really tasty, but honestly, it was a mess. I watched my husband crack open the entire thing and this literally consumed all of his time. By the time he was done cracking, I was almost done eating my meal of seafood cioppino. This came with crab, fish, scallops, clams and mussels in a tomato herb broth. It was delicious and hit the spot. I eyed the dessert tray, which looked delicious, but we were both stuffed from our meal.   Overall, I would recommend this place for a seafood fix. It was a little on the pricey side, but I felt it was justified with how delicious everything was, the great service, and the great view. Next time we visit Pier 39, I would definitely come back here and try the other items on the menu.",

A trip to SF isn't complete without some clam chowder! The bread had a wonderful crunchy texture and the clam chowder was delicious without being too heavy.  For entrees, I ordered swordfish while the rest of my family ordered ahi tuna and the seafood spaghetti. While the food was a little on the salty side, it was pretty good. I actually liked the swordfish the least out of all the entrees because it was rather dry. The tuna was surprisingly generous in portion and I liked this entree the most. The seafood spaghetti was pretty good too, and that's coming from someone who typically doesn't like seafood. I tried their rose wine soda, which was non-alcoholic. It was yummy! It just tastes like a light fizzy soda, haha. They should just call it grape soda, but I guess they just want to make it sound fancy.

We were startled to see several waitresses and waiters with white uniform button up shirts but no undershirts beneath!! I could see the women's bras and one mans nipples clear as day!!! For a place like this I would have expected management to have that under control at least!  We were seated in the far back of the restaraunt where a party of about 15 teenage girls of 15 years old were seated with no adult supervision and were so loud throughout our whole meal that I could barely make out anything my friend was saying to me. And I really feel bad for the people who were sitting next to them as we were half way across the room! When I said something to our waiter he stated \"yeah, they are pretty annoying\" but never attempted to rectify the situation.   It took about 15 minutes for someone to come get our drink orders and I ordered a margarita and was able to hardly drink it because it was about 70% syrup and way too sweet. We ordered the ahi tuna poke which I really enjoyed and my friend had the crab dip which absolutely loved and devoured. When the main meals arrived my friend had the chowder and said it wasn't really all that special and was just ok. I ordered a plate of clams, mussels, shrimp, crab and corn. The dish was absolutely COVERED in Garlic....there so much garlic everywhere and I had a hard time scraping it off. The clams were ok and there wasn't too much to the mussels. The corn was ridiculous as you couldn't really bite into it but if you scraped it with your teeth you might actually get a little bit. The whole dish was hard to eat because of the ridiculous amount of garlic. It was like someone took about 6-8 whole garlic, minced it and to threw it in. With what we paid, we were severely disappointed....this restaurant needs someone competent enough to actually make this place worth the price...",

The dish was large enough for 2 people to start with but added pasta to our order and it was a perfect compliment to the seafood. Order a bottle of wine to go along with the food and you have a complete meal.   There is a little bit of a wait line when you get to restaurant. Make sure you tell the hostess that you want a table with a view on the bay. There is a different waiting time on these tables but the view makes up for it.",

We also got window seating which had the perfect view of the pier from our table! :) The restaurant is super cute and fancy. Between my boyfriend and I, we shared the sourdough clam chowder bread bowl, the red curry mussels and a beer. Both dishes we're amazingggg. The clam chowder- super creamy and filling that pair perfectly well with their warm sourdough bread. Red curry mussels- I'm not a huge seafood gal, but as one bite, yum! They paired it with what seems like toasted garlic bread (they need to include more pieces!). I'll be back!",

Well, it's good to know that this place was rated pretty good, and I can't say I went to SF without eating some kind of seafood so here I was with 4 others (note: \"cooked\" seafood...I don't like anything raw).  My friend actually called them around 8:15ish to see if we can make a reservation, but at that time, they were booked and walk-in would be about a 30-minute wait. \u00a0By the time we got there around 9:00, the restaurant was maybe a 1/3 empty so we were able to sit down right away (thank goodness, I would've had to chew my arm off).  Although we got hot sourdough bread with butter, we ordered the blue cheese garlic bread ($8) and crispy lemon calamari ($12) on top of that and pretty much scarfed it down. \u00a0The calamari was tender with crispy batter...so good. \u00a0The blue cheese garlic bread was good too, but the blue cheese was rich so if I wasn't overly hungry, I wouldn't be able to eat 3 slices. \u00a0But I did.  For main, I ordered the Pacific Sole ($20), but by then, I was already getting stuffed...(didn't help that I had a virgin Pina Colada with the appetizers). \u00a0I still ate some of it. \u00a0The pacific sole was fresh not fishy and went well with the spinach, peppers, and tarragon cooked in a caper sauce (buerre blanc). \u00a0The others ordered coffee and dessert after that, but I had to pass. \u00a0Sooo sooo sooo (did I say \"sooo\"?) saaaaad to miss out on dessert!!!",

We started with the bleu cheese garlic bread (free with yelp check in) and as a non-bleu cheese fan, the bread was surprisingly tasty. The bleu cheese was very mild and broiled crisp on top.   The clam chowder was thick, creamy with large chunks of clam-just the way a good chowder should be. The oysters on the half shell were fresh. The steamed crab legs were delicious although a little drier than I'd like. Drenching them in garlic butter definitely helped:)  I washed down all this garlicky seafood goodness with a Skinny Ginger Lemonade. Advertised as only 14 calories and made with Splenda, it was light and refreshing with fresh ginger shavings throughout.",

Upon arrival we waited for about fifteen minutes before being seated (for a group of three) at a corner not far from the Crab House.   We ordered two cups of clam chowder, and one in a sourdough bowl. Apparently the basket of bread was sourdough, so the sourdough bowl wasn't necessary. The chowder was great - as the restaurant claims - \"the best in San Francisco. \"  We also ordered \u00a0Crispy Bay Scallops, Dungeness Crab Cakes, and Fried Combo (breaded fish, calamari, shrimp, french fries and cole slaw). Based on the description lots of calories for sure. \u00a0The scallops, calamari and crab cakes were the best of the lot.

I had the oysters and I believe they were from fanny bay if I could remember. Only 1 selection. The condiments given could have been better. They are a seafood restaurant so I expected to have a larger oyster selection. The ceviche with crab was very delicious, but I felt the chips that were given to compliment it were just thrown on there. It felt a little stale to me. The ceviche could have been a bit more sour as well. I split the cioppino with a friend and because I'm a girl it was an okay amount. I didn't leave feeling full. The seafood in the cioppino tasted a bit dry and the mussels I had did not taste so fresh. I've had better cioppino with much more seafood in it before. We had the Alcatraz escape and the drinks were well made. It tasted great and it wasn't too weak. Instead of giving mints they gave a biscoff cookie, which I thought was weird. Overall, its's an okay place. Not great but definitely not something you must try. I tried to like the place, but I can't still. 3 stars because it's not a bad place.

We had a very nice server for a few minutes until he came over to tell us he was leaving and Clementi (sp?) took over for him. (At least, that's what my husband saw on her name tag. She never introduced herself). She took our orders and left. A few minutes after that, a runner brought us an appetizer that wasn't ours. We told him and he left. A few minutes later, a different runner and another wrong appetizer. We told him it wasn't ours and and he also left. Clementi sees this from across the room and comes running over and wants to know what is going on. Not as in, \"Oh, is there a problem that I can solve for you?\". She wanted to know why we were talking to the other employees. She seemed very accusatory, like she thought we were complaining or something.   So we finally get our correct appetizer and then our main courses. THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT. The only \u00a0thing that really ruined our experience was our server's attitude and lack of attentiveness. At the very end, she comes over with the check and says \"I have some treats for \u00a0you\" and literally throws a tiny cookie onto the table in the general direction of each of us, like we were dogs. It was just so ridiculous. The restaurant seemed like it could be very nice and I think, with the right service, it would have been a great experience.

We were seated and asked our server for recommendations. \u00a0We ended up with:  \u00a0- Goat cheese garlic bread: very rich in flavor (goat cheese mostly) but crispy and warm.  \u00a0- Crab cocktail: it's crab season so the crab tasted extra fresh. \u00a0Perfectly chilled and served with traditional cocktail sauce.  \u00a0- Menu special, Scallops: this was okay. \u00a0It was served with a quinoa salad but there was a bit too much balsamic vinegar to appreciate the taste of the scallop.  \u00a0- Seafood platter for 1: served with crab, shrimp, mussels, and clams in a butter herb sauce. \u00a0We were disappointed with this. \u00a0The food was lukewarm, at best, and there was so much butter it drowned the taste of the seafood. \u00a0Since we came here with high seafood expectations, this is the reason for my mid-scoring review.  All in all the experience was just okay; nothing spectacular or fancy. \u00a0Our server gave us this card to text in a review of the restaurant, with a promise of a complimentary dessert at the end of the meal. \u00a0Well, I took the survey. \u00a0But I guess they have no way to monitor who takes the survey from each table? \u00a0I didn't bring it to her attention, as I wasn't really in the mood for dessert, but for a promotion that's supposed to gauge a customer's experience with a promise of a small reward at completion, I would think they could track better. \u00a0But again, this wasn't a make or break for my opinion.",

We had great seats by the water with an amazing view. Ordered a bottle of champagne ($34) dollars and made it a super classy meal. The CRAB CAKES ARE TO KILL FOR. So most and full of crab.

    "review_text": "Came here with my friend to celebrate my birthday two nights ago. I'd been craving clam chowder for over a week and I wanted to see if this place really had the \"best clam chowder in SF\".  I booked a reservation for 6:15 and called to change it to 6:45 and the lady on the phone was fairly accommodating and friendly. When we arrived, we were immediately seated at a table by the window (probably because I had mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday on our reservation) with a spectacular view of Alcatraz and the seals! Our amazing waiter, David, came by and introduced us to some special dishes on the menu. He also knew it was my birthday and told me they would prepare a chocolate dessert for us. When he came back with our drinks, we just ordered two bread bowls (we weren't crazy hungry because had sundaes two hours earlier). I knew about the Yelp check-in offer for the free appetizer but didn't now it only came with an order of an entree, but David was so kind and said he would bring us one out because it was my birthday.   The bread bowls were fairly large and definitely met our expectations. It was presented nicely (it wasn't messy like most bread bowls we order from other places) and not too salty or bland. Perfectly creamy. Had a lot of clams and potatoes too. Clam chowder is my favorite soup (and arguably one of my favorite foods in general) and I'd have to say this was the best I've ever had. Our only complaint would be there wasn't enough soup. The actual bread the soup came in was HUGE, but I'd say there was only about two cups of soup in the actual bread bowl. I was alright though (my friend was still a bit hungry but luckily we had our free appetizer!) because I was stuffed when I finished. I couldn't even finish the bread!   Our waiter came by many times to ask us how our dishes were and how we were doing and even sang me happy birthday when he brought us our free chocolate dessert! The chocolate cake was a bit too sweet but it was extremely rich and went well with the scoop of vanilla ice cream next to it.   Our bill only came to about $24 only because we had ordered two bread bowls, but it was amazing considering the fact that we got a free appetizer and dessert.  OVERALL: Clam chowder bread bowls - Best I've ever had and I'm a local! Not too salty and not too bland either. Only wish there was more soup and it was less pricey.  Blue cheese bread appetizer - I love garlic bread and I love cheesy bread but this wasn't that good. I've never really liked the taste of blue cheese so this definitely wasn't my favorite. But it won't hurt to get it for free if you check in on yelp!  Service - absolutely amazing. The waiters were all extremely nice, especially David.   Ambiance/View - has one of the best views of Pier 39. If you happen to get a seat on the left of the restaurant by the Bay, you'll be able to see Alcatraz and the area where the seals are. I specifically chose a reservation right before sunset and the view of the water was breathtaking. If it's too sunny they have blinds they'll be happy to pull down (or up) for you. Restaurant wasn't too loud and the restaurant was pretty busy (esp. for a Wednesday night).   **they'll also validate your parking ticket for up to 4 hours if you came by car  I'll definitely be coming back again!",

We came here in the afternoon and enjoyed sitting by the fireplace outside and listening to the waterfall while we waited for our table. The restaurant has beautiful bay windows with panoramic views of the wharf. It's worth asking for a table next to the window where you can actually see the seals below!   Being in SF I really wanted fresh baked bread so I was delighted when a bread basket of warm, freshly baked sourdough bread arrived. To kick things off, we enjoyed the Crispy Lemon Calamari ($12), which was delicious! The calamari was seasoned with lemon zest and delicious on it's own even without the lemon aioli. For lunch, one of us enjoyed the award winning Clam Chowder in a Bread Bowl ($9) and the other had the Soup and Salad Combo ($14) with a Caesar side salad. The soup was served in a fresh baked sourdough bread bowl. We enjoyed the complimentary Biscoff cookie that arrived at the end of the meal.  Visit Fog Harbor Fish House, you won't be disappointed!",

    "review_text": "After doing some exploring in San Francisco for the day my boyfriend and I decided to eat lunch at the Fog Harbor Fish House. We were advised to not eat at Pier 39 since it's a tourist trap, low quality food with a hefty price tag. Even though we were advised not to eat at Pier 39, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try anyways. We turned to yelp and saw that Fog Harbor had very good ratings based on their 1,000+ reviews.  For lunch on a Saturday, expect to wait. The wait wasn't too long considering how busy they were, we were seated within 20-30 minutes. Since my boyfriend and I love seafood we decided to order the Shellfish Platter for two. The platter comes with corns, shrimps, clams, mussels, and 1/2 a crab. While waiting for our order the waitress brought out fresh sourdough bread for us to enjoy and it was delicious. \u00a0  When I placed the Shellfish platter order I was excited for my seafood lunch, but when the plate came out I was hugely disappointed. The amount of seafood that was provided did not seem like it was meant for two people. The mussels were very tiny, so tiny that when I ate them I couldn't really taste mussels. My boyfriend and I established that they could've been cove mussels since they were so small. Some of the clams were missing the actual clams, we were served with just their outer shells. The crab was very delicious, I wish we had more! Butter is used as the sauce for the platter, but we opted out of it and the platter tasted fine. Just drizzle some lemons (which were provided) and you are set, a much healthier and tastier alternative.   I also ordered a cup of the clam chowder. I am a fan of clam chowder and I had to try their \"award winning house clam chowder\". The chowder was good, but compared to other clam chowders I had, it was a little bit saltier than I preferred. It was still good since I ended up finishing the cup!   Overall, for the price you are paying the quality and quantity of food was not worth it.",

    "review_text": "There was one thing I was determined to do while in San Francisco, and that was to find a good seafood place in Fisherman's Wharf where we could enjoy fresh fish and a nice view of the harbor. So I went to Yelp, because I did not want to chance ending up somewhere not so good on my SF Fisherman's Wharf seafood adventure!  I was looking for a nicer dinner place, not just a clam chowder hut, so Fog Harbor caught my eye and with good reviews, we decided to give it a try. I am *so* happy we did .... best meal on our entire vacation!  We had problems figuring out where to enter the place! lol. I saw the Fog Harbor sign on the wall, but finally after walking around some, we realized we had to walk up the stairs and enter from above! :) It is a very touristy area, but we didn't have to wait to get seated. It's a good-sized restaurant, also with options for eating at the bar, so the capacity for customers is quite good. \u00a0 They escorted us to a nice table where we could oversee the ocean, Alcatraz and the Pier 39 traffic below while we ate. Loved it.  We started off with some clam chowder. \u00a0While waiting for soup, we were served nice fresh sourdough bread, it was so delicious! Nice and smooth and not \"too sour\", it was perfect. \u00a0The clam chowder was wonderful. \u00a0Full of clams!! (As a clam chowder should be, but you'd be surprised at how often you can count the clams in a chowder on one hand ....). \u00a0We mopped up every single drop with the remains of our sourdough bread, that bowl was clean and ready for service again by the time we were done with it.  For dinner, I had selected the swordfish. It was served atop ratatouille and fingerling potatoes and was accompanied by pesto sauce and chimichurri. The flavors were amazing, I loved the combination of all these vegetables and sauces along with the swordfish, it really brought the fish \"to life\". I love swordfish, but it can be a little bland if served with the wrong sides. \u00a0 This vegetable/ratatouille blend along with the sauces really did the fish justice, I loved every bite!  My husband decided on the crab cake dinner.  Now, I'm very picky when it comes to crab cakes. \u00a0I'm picky on seafood overall actually, but especially food involving crab. \u00a0If it is fishy tasting at all, I won't have it, so most crab cakes never pass \"the test\" ;-)   I'm very happy to say, the Fog Harbor crab cakes DID pass the \"Laila\" test with flying colors!! They were so smooth and delicious, I even reached over for a couple of extra bites and luckily my husband is good at sharing ;-)   At the end of the night, when our bill came, we actually did feel we got our moneys worth ... between the food, the service and the beautiful view, it was totally worth it and it was exactly the San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf seafood experience that I had dreamed about!! :-)",

The crab sandwich was okay - the bread that it was served in was very good, but the crab itself was a little bland and just too cold. Needed a little sauce or something to flavor it better.   Anyway, our server was just flat, lusterless and almost angry at times. The place was overly busy, but she could have at least tried to appear happy.   I shan't be back.

Both of them were very good! The service was okay but not overly impressive. The ambiance and views of the water were great, although the windows needed a good cleaning (the amount of bird poop on them was gross). The 4 stars is strictly for the quality of the food.",

I ordered the cup of clam chowder and half a garlic dungenous crab (as it was in season!). The clam chowder was probably one of the best I have ever had, and I grew up along the coast so I have alot of clam chowders in my life! The crab was also very good. A bit smaller than I was picturing but with the clam chowder, I was full!  Out of all the restaurants along that pier, this one seemed the least touristy and Im glad we stopped in!",

If you look at the reviews everyone who rates it highly is a tourist.   3. The food, the crab was good but my friend's halibut was way over cooked and the pumpkin dessert sucked.

I've eaten here about 5-6 times and I've been impressed each time. The food here is very good. I highly recommend the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and spinach. It is my favorite item on the menu and since I am such a potato lover, they replace my spinach for an extra side of mashed potatoes. I've also had the salmon, steamed clams (an appetizer) calamari, popcorn shrimp and clam chowder, all of which are delicious. The food is fairly priced.   The service is good, the waiters/waitresses are very friendly and attentive. They also seem very knowledgable about the menu and will give recommendations and suggestions. I remember going there one time with my friends, our waiter was so sweet he hooked us up with free dessert and put it on the check as a \"free birthday dessert\" -- awesome!   Definitely recommend this restaurant! One of my favorites -- I am even planning on going tomorrow night!!

Make sure to have reservation as this place is right on the pier where crowds of people are looking for places to eat so they get packed quickly. I had their Fried Combo platter. I love love loved the flakey white fish perfectly battered. The shrimp however that came in my platter was just \"ok\" really nothing special about it. The Calamari rings were also good.

A true highlight as the menu suggests. We had the. Ran cakes and crab stuffed lobster for main which both rounded out a great meal. The lobster was cooked perfectly with the welcomed addition of crab to give two distinct flavours. The crab cakes were seasoned well, had a nice crunch to the shell and were a good size for the money. The location is a dream for an Aussie like Myself with Alcatraz and golden gate in the background, providing a postcard like backdrop. In summary a strong performing meal with superb service has given me a second great experience from this restaurant. Food 8/10 9/10 decor 7/10",

We were seated and perused the menu to see what I would like to feast upon for dinner. \u00a0Our server Khaiman took our drink and appetizer orders. \u00a0 When he came back I asked him what was the popular item on the menu. \u00a0He immediately said the shellfish platter is a popular item as well as their mixed grill and a couple other items. \u00a0I ordered the shellfish platter and my gf the mixed grilled. \u00a0Khaiman recommended she get it Cajun flavored for the fish and he was right, but more on that later.  We were given some fresh sourdough bread with our appetizers and it was amazing. We had the Dungeness crab, mango and avocado ceviche and while good, it wasn't amazing or to die for. \u00a0 We also decided to each get a cup of their clam chowder. \u00a0This is a definite must have and something I would get again. Nice flavor with a good amount of clams. \u00a0It's not overloaded with fillers like potatoes that other restaurants utilize. Now for the main course. \u00a0The Shellfish platter came with 1/2 a Dungeness crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, and corn. \u00a0All of those was drenched in a garlic and herb oil that put this dish over the top. \u00a0I love garlic so it was like this dish was made for me. \u00a0Everything was fresh and cooked just right. \u00a0Price was fair considering what was included. \u00a0 The mixed grill my gf had was amazing. \u00a0The Cajun flavoring wasn't spicy or over powering. It complimented the salmon, swordfish, and shrimp well. \u00a0Something I'd recommend to order if you prefer fish over shellfish.  We opted out of dessert cause we were quite stuffed and couldn't possibly eat another bite. \u00a0 When Khaiman brought out our bill he included some biscoff cookies to enjoy at the show. \u00a0 I should mention I ordered a Moscow Mule to sip on during dinner. \u00a0I'm picky since I make my own mules often and they did it right. \u00a0Perfect balance of ginger beer and vodka which made it a refreshing beverage. Of course it was served in a copper mug which every mule should be.  We have a wonderful experience at Fog Harbor and will be back once we visit Frisco again. \u00a0If you have a chance stop by and you won't be disappointed. \u00a0Oh and if you can get Khaiman as your server. He won't steer you wrong and will make sure your glass is always full.",

We were seated right away at the back with a nice view of Coit Tower to the left and the bay to the right.   We were given fresh sourdough bread and butter. What I ordered was simple, fried shrimp with fries and coleslaw and hubby had Seafood Penne with fresh fish, clams and mussels in a tomato cream sauce. The food was fresh and hot, good but nothing special. The shrimp was medium in size and fried to a nice golden crisp but unremarkable in taste as was the fries and coleslaw. Per my husband although the seafood was fresh the seafood penne was bland. The service was average, our waiter was more interested in the 3 girls that was seated at the table next to us and totally abandoned our table. \u00a0Even when he was at the other table we couldn't get his attention and he pretty much ignored us, we had to flag down another waiter to get our check because our waiter disappeared.   The food was fresh and the views were really nice, definitely worth a 2nd visit but would order something totally different.",

    "review_text": "3.5/5, +.5 for service  Well, Fog Harbor was my first dinner stop in my 11-day trip down the west coast. Our theme was seafood for our San Francisco stops, since I personally have never been to the Pacific coast and really wanted to test out what's so great about their seafood.  We reserved via OpenTable and had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a window seat, but we did get a seat eventually and were promptly served.  Our dinner included the \"award winning\" clam chowder, dungeness crab cakes, garlic roasted crab, wild salmon, lobster tail, and the lobster mac and cheese. Well, the first thing we realized was we ordered way too much. I understood America and their big portions, but the portions were not just big, they were huge. The garlic roasted crab had to have been at least 5 pounds, and I was actually completely shocked my mom managed to finish the whole crab (although she didn't even touch the corn cob and potatoes). The lobster tail also tasted very good, and that we were actually able to complete. The award winning clam chowder definitely lived up to its name: Creamy (but not too creamy) soup with plentiful clam chunks and easy on the potatoes. The wild salmon was also good, however once again it was so large on portions we couldn't finish it. The lobster mac and cheese was baked and was probably the disappointment of the meal as it really didn't taste anything special, especially when comparing the other orders.  Service started brilliantly, and quite frankly I don't really blame the waitress that much for the slightly worse service we got as we were finishing our meal, since the restaurant closed at 10 and we were still eating at 10:45 (I did say the portions were huge!!!). We finally left around 11 and were the last customers departing the restaurant, having finally experienced seafood in the west coast...miles better than the east coast.",

We watched the sunset over the marina and it was absolutely gorgeous.  I can understand how other reviewers feel about the crowds because of tourists, but it's because this restaurant has it all.

The prices were also fairly high, but the server was attentive despite the difficulties of working at a crowded Pier 39 restaurant.   The moral of the story is not to be some dimwit who eats at Pier 39. Pier 39 is the land of the $5 corn dog and $4 soda. It's a tourist trap of worldwide proportions, filled with every museum or giant machine that wants to grab your money in existence.   Sure, Pier 39 has great attractions like Rocket Boat, Musee Mecanique and so on. But for god's sake - save the eating for the Mission or somewhere else you can get to on the streetcar. Anywhere but in Pier 39.  Fog Harbor Fish House is best avoided. If you go out to San Francisco's many neighborhoods, you'll have better food, even regarding fish and seafood. Fisherman's Wharf also has some wonderful seafood in stands and restaurants which is a lot better than the more touristy Pier 39. And it's only about two blocks away.",

Great views, check! Located right at the pier's edge and where a lot of the Blue and Gold Fleet cruises dock.  Crab? Check! A whole menu entirely dedicated to the local Dungeness crab. Fresh and a multitude of preparations, making it very hard for us to choose a single dish.  Joe and I were in the noshing mood, planning to go to Fisherman's Wharf for dinner (post to come!). We shared the 1/2 lb crab, stir fried with onions, peppers, in a spicy red chili garlic sauce. NOM! Turned out a lot better than I thought it would be. The shell was super soft, making it pretty easy to crack even without the crab cracker, and the garlic sauce was nice and spicy! The highlight of the dish: the fresh crab meat waiting inside the shell. Sweet and juicy. Should have ordered a second crab dish in my opinion!  Our other dish: an ahi tuna poke. After having amazing poke in LA, we've been looking around for a good poke. A trip to Hawaii next perhaps? Anyways, the dish was beautifully presented with crispy wonton chips with white and black sesame seeds, a wasabi aioli, an unidentified hot sauce, seaweed, and the ahi tuna marinated in a sesame soy sauce with avocados and mango. Yum! The mango made the dish it's own and added to the refreshing taste. Still not up to our standard from Venice Beach, but satisfying enough.  Great eats, but you definitely pay the price for the location and the view. If you want straight up fresh seafood, served simple, look forward to my Fisherman's Wharf post coming this week!",

Matthew and myself were a little hesitant because we don't eat seafood.   Luckily, they offered more than seafood. So we started out with drinks. I had the Moscow mule and my grandma had the Lombard lemonade. The guys had some straight scotch I believe. The bread was really good too.   Matthew and I got the chicken penne which was delicious. The service was great and the view was even better! Would totally recommend this place! A bit pricey, but worth it.",

We had a table by the window. \u00a0This restaurant, to me, is a great place for a special occasion celebration. \u00a0Large open space, white table cloths. GOOD FOOD!  If I'm remembering correctly, the CLAM CHOWDER was spot on. The SEAFOOD FRIED COMBO was nicely done.  We had an assortment of dishes on our table, including the Lobster Mac n Cheese, the Ahi Poke and none of them disappointed us.  The Garlic Crab was good, but The Crab House next door has them beat when it comes to this dish. \u00a0I love it when Yelpers drop hints like this in their reviews, so here is a good tip for you. \u00a0Go to The Crab House literally next door and get the Garlic Crab. \u00a0Best I've had.  I like this place a lot. \u00a0It's between a 4 and a 5 for me. This is exactly what you would expect from a classy version of a fish house.",

With my party of 6, we were delighted to get a table with just a breathtaking view. Absolutely gorgeous. With a quick change of waiters, because why not, a new friendly lady (I should get on top of remembering my servers names...) helped up decently well. We all ordered the clam chowder in a bread bowl, a half garlic crab, and some drinks.  The chowder was delicious but pretty much the same thing as everywhere else in the Pier 39 area. I ordered a ginger lemonade, while expensive (like everything at Pier 39), was refreshing! They also had alcohol-free wines which my friend enjoyed. The garlic crab was decent, but I've had better in the area from small restaurants. The check-in for the free blue cheese garlic bread was a nice touch!   Food is high quality, overall good customer service, and an AMAZING view of San Francisco! Excited for the next time around!",

    "review_text": "We were visiting San Francisco from San Diego just for the weekend for my birthday! We were exploring the pier and found this place via Yelp.  ATMOSPHERE: Nice view of the water. Casual. Crowded on a Saturday at 2pm so we knew it must be good. \u00a0A lot of large groups come to this place.  FOOD: We ordered -  1. Complimentary bread  2. Blue cheese bread - yummy. This paired well with the soup broth of the cioppino 3. Swordfish w/ capers, grilled veggies - very, very good! Healthy too. Definitely would order this again.  4. Cioppino - huge portion! \u00a0Definitely enough for 2 even without the pasta which is $2 extra. I opted for the crab to be cracked for me for an extra $4. Good but probably would not order again. \u00a0 5. Tiramisu - delicious! Creamy layers. Definitely recommend. Big enough to share between 2 people and maybe even 3.  6. Moscow mule - served in a copper cup! Very good but not the best one I've had which was in San Diego and I don't think they use bitters.  SERVICE: Excellent! The waitress, Ika who was from Kazakhstan, even sang happy birthday to me all by herself, haha.  TIPS: Check-in on FourSquare, Yelp for a free blue cheese bread appetizer! Also check into the pier for a free coupon book at the visitors center which has a coupon in the book for Fog Harbor for a free blue cheese bread OR calamari appetizer. \u00a0If it's your birthday, just say so and they treat you to a complimentary desert! Score! Also reservations can be made on OpenTable.  PRICE: I would say moderate to pricey. Paying full price for a full lunch including appetizer, drink, main dish, dessert expect at least $50 per person.  CONCLUSION: Good food, very big portions, nice view, great service. Solid restaurant! There are so many good restaurants in SF and although this is not a \"must do\" restaurant, it's a good choice.",

We started off sharing a couple of appetizers: Shrimp cocktail and crab cakes. Both were good!  Entree I had the Mixed Grill which brings Grilled Salmon, Swordfish and Shrimp and a garlic mashed potatoes. Everything was grilled perfectly. My favorite was the swordfish but the other two (and that mash!) were great too.  For dessert we had the chocolate bread pudding. Big enough that three of us shared and it was just the right way to end the meal.  Customer service was great. Our waiter accidentally switched up the wine orders and gave them to the wrong people.

Got a beautiful table by the window with a great view.  Mila was our fabulous waitress with a great personality, and told us there is a 15% discount for all locals! Yay!  Right away, got the amazing warm and fresh sourdough. Love.  Started with the crab ceviche with pineapple and avocado. The crab was perfect but pineapple made it too sweet. I give it 3 stars.   Then the amazing, hearty bowl of clam chowder. I have had great chowder and this one is definitely on the top of my list.  For entrees we got the surf and turf and the seafood platter. Surf and turf is delicious with a perfectly made 10 oz steak and delicious crab stuffed lobster.  The seafood platter is generous with lots of clams and mussels and shrimp. The half crab was perfect. Corn is buttery and excellent.  Paired everything with Moscow Mules - must get!   No room for dessert but you do get biscoff cookies with your check.  Great food, would deinitely come back.",

Pluses:  1. The wait was minimal on a Thursday night in the summer, which was nice.  2. The restaurant seems clean, upscale and has amazing views if you are willing to wait for them.   3. The drinks were amazing. Mixed very well, creatively concocted and delicious.   The minuses: 1. \u00a0VERY LOUD AND NOISY. There are way too many tables squeezed in the space available. Normally I wouldn't knock a place for this, but given everything else that was bad, I thought I'd list.  2. The service. It is very apparent that each server has too many tables to handle. Service is extremely slow. We were told 4 times our oysters and crab cakes were on the way however the actual time to receive was approx. 30 minutes. If they sent actually on the way, just don't say it. Again, I wouldn't necessarily knock a place for this however the oysters are raw (easy to plate) and the crab cakes were obviously pre-made and just dropped into a fryer. Also, it would have been nice to get or even be offered bread, when everyone seem to have it. Lastly, when we tried to joke or have any conversation with put waitress at all, she immediately became defensive and didn't get the banter.   3. The food. Crab stuff lobster ... Should include ... Lobster. Additionally the dish should not be sitting on top of boxed (at least that's what they tasted like) mashed potatoes. Or in my opinion not for $36 bucks. The swordfish had a very odd square shape, tasted at one point frozen and was dry.   If you're visiting, hungry and need a place to eat on the pier, choose someplace else. Not at all worth the price.",

I have to tell you - and it might be a surprise to you as well since it's at PIER 39 - it is.  From the food to the service and certainly the views, Fog Harbor Fish House is about as perfect as you'll get for a San Francisco seafood restaurant.  Specializing in sustainable seafood and with a luxe, Malibu-style gorgeous outdoor space by the entry complete with roaring fireplace, Fog Harbor Fish House is a perfect choice for out-of-town friends and family you're hosting to a romantic date.   It's such a surprise to find a \"view\" restaurant not resting on its laurels or looking a little dated and frumpy (you know who you are).  From the overflowing amount of crab in the San Francisco favorite Crab Louie salad, to the crispy and fresh calamari appetizer to truly, one of the best bowls of steamed clams you may ever have, it was a perfect lunch at Fisherman's Wharf.  Sleek, modern yet comfortable, the ambiance strikes the perfect chord as does its food.  It's just a bit pricey (you will, after all, pay for the pluperfect view) however the quality and postcard perfect location equate to Fog Harbor Fish House being well-priced.  I would go there again in a heartbeat, all on my \"local own\" \u00a0 -without out-of-town family and friends.  If you're thinking, \"Wow, that's pretty high praise\"... it is.

Through the open door to their back room I could see their ops schedule - very impressive whiteboard with names and rows. And the service lined up with that. Everything was quick, and no mistakes.   I also noticed that the restaurant was determined to get reviews. Case and point: I got a free appetizer for checking in and a free desert for giving a quick review (note that it was a review on their website. My yelp reviews can't be purchased with a desert or anything else!)   The food was good, hot, and came out quickly. It just wasn't that unique; it didn't have a chef's touch, which is the primary reason for my 4 rating. But I did enjoy the experience and would certainly go back.",

The place is very nicely decorated and we were seated next to the windows. We got a very good view of the ocean and the activities outside! To top it off, our waiter was also very pleasant and gave us some recommendations of what we should order too.   What we ordered: - Blue Cheese Garlic Bread: so good! It's a must-order starter. Definitely could of gotten full from this alone.  - Fried Combo: Consisted of fried fish, calamari, shrimp, french fries and cole slaw. We could not finish this. It was huge.  - Seafood Cioppino: We added the pasta with the crab, fish, shrimp, scallops, clams and mussels in the stew. This was amazing and definitely my favorite. I loved the crab and scallops; both were very fresh. We tried to finish this, but we couldn't either.   The portions here are huge. Everything was worth the price. The three of us could not finish our meals. My SoCal friend really liked this place. We really wanted to order dessert, but we were stuffed.   All of us definitely full and were happy to walk off our meal afterwards by the bay. I would recommend coming here if you're showing of San Francisco to someone!

I was looking for some high quality, fresh seafood and this place prides themselves on their sustainable seafood selection! \u00a0First they seated us at a table away from the windows and when asked, quickly and politely got us a nice booth instead with a view of the water and sights.   Service was nothing short of great: a prompt, courteous waiter who didn't hover but brought us our drinks and complimentary fresh-baked sourdough bread with butter and tended to our needs unobtrusively.  Food was delicious; I ordered the Grill Combo which featured perfect portions of shrimp, swordfish and salmon in a delicious citrus butter sauce with a side of veggies and choice of wild rice or garlic mashed potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the Fried Combo, which came with a very generous portion of house-battered and fried calamari, shrimp, and cod, with French fries on the side and dipping sauces. My one disappointment: the side of veggies was not to my liking, a green that looked like stringy broccoli cooked with some cocktail onions. I expected some mixed veggies at least!   All in all a great meal and experience! No wonder they get such great reviews! MUCH better than a generic Joe's Crab Shack experience any day!!!",

Not sure if they were having a hard time adjusting for the Labor Day tourists, but when you have to ask for ketchup three times from three different servers, you know things aren't going well.   I had the crab roll which was great. Gf had the ahi tuna which was also great. Mom had the mixed grill which wasn't too bad. It's a typical seafood place located within the tourist utopia that is Fisherman's Wharf.   We had a nice gentleman who was taking care of us while our server was on break, and he was fantastic. Once he left things really took a hit. Our server was nice, but we barely saw her. We had oyster shells on our table for nearly 30 minutes. 30 minutes. They normally take those away within minutes.   It's a nice location, with pretty good food, but they really need to step up the service.",

The Hot Apple Cider with Ginger Liqueur and Cinnamon Whiskey was the perfect drink to warm me up. The Crab Ceviche was also good. I had the Lobster stuffed with Crab. All excellent.   Our server was the reason this place does not get 5 stars. I agree the place was busy but when you charge $$$, one of those stars is for service. He made me feel like I was at an Applebee's; one of those eat - pay - leave places. In fact I have received better, more attentive service at Applebees.",

However, many of the items we ordered were mildly disappointing.  Our starters, chili lime shrimp salad and (on special) crab ceviche with mango and avocado, were bizarrely similar just with different protein. The ceviche was served on lettuce, drizzled with the same salad dressing which was mildly mustardy and didn't go with the dish. Also, while the amount of crab was decent, it actually seems skimpy on the mango, avocado, and lime. Definitely missing a ceviche sort of flavor, but it was a tasty pile of shredded crab meat. Both starters also had the same house made tortilla chips, just in different shapes.  My husband liked his crab roll sandwich, and the sweet potato fries that came with it were good. If I had realized my salmon sandwich came with fries, I would have upgraded to sweet potato. Blackened salmon was a nice option. Half my sandwich was leftover and still good the next day, cold.  Our drinks were just okay. We didn't stay for dessert. If you go, insist on a seat with a view.",

It was a beautiful and clear (not foggy at all!) day in San Francisco and the tourists were all abuzz in the pier area. \u00a0Though Fog Harbor Fish House is a huge tourist attraction, it's definitely not a tourist trap. \u00a0I really enjoyed the service (very nice!) and also the selection of foods. \u00a0I was stuck between choosing the seafood platter or the seared ahi tuna. \u00a0In the end, I went with the seared ahi tuna, and it came with this amazing wild rice and seasonal vegetables! \u00a0The tuna was a very decent portion and it came crusted with sesame seeds and a ginger glaze. \u00a0So delicious! \u00a0  To top it off, I got a bowl of clam chowder (their chowder is amazing here!) and a pina colada on the side.   We had such an excellent view of the bay - the Golden Gate bridge was in view, as was Alcatraz island. \u00a0  What a lovely visit to SF! \u00a0I will certainly be back again to eat at Fog Harbor Fish House when I'm in SF in the future!",

The restaurant is situated in the heart of Pier 39. The inside is classy without being too intimidating. You can come in here dressed up for a date night or casually stroll in wearing jeans and tennis shoes. They have sone awesome window seats overlooking the bay and the Alcatraz view.   They start you off with fresh-out-the-oven sourdough bread. I usually shy away from white bread, but I just can't say no to crunchy on the outside, soft and warm inside--fantastic sourdough bread. We also ordered the calamari and clam chowder for appetizers. The calamari is great! The batter is very light, crisp and tasty. It's served with lemon aioli sauce. The clam chowder was also very yummy. It was the right creamy texture with good flavor and the perfect amount of saltiness. For our main entr\u00e9es, I got the Seared Tuna with a side of mashed potatoes and my bf ordered the whole garlic crab with fingerling potatoes. Blame the appetizers because I didn't get to finish my entr\u00e9e. However, the tuna was delicious. Perfect seared exterior with the pink inside. It wasn't overly seasoned, and still featured the natural flavor of the tuna. My bf devoured THE WHOLE CRAB. That means it's good right?  I will definitely brave the touristy crowd and the expensive parking to eat some great seafood from here.",

    "review_text": "First off, I just want to say that I originally had 1st intentions of going to another restaurant to celebrate a 6 year anniversary. Unfortunately, that place was already booked (place is called Navio located in Half Moon Bay; attempted to book reservation two weeks ago; no luck). Anyway, I must say that I'm so grateful to have found Fog Harbor Fish House. \u00a0This restaurant was going to be my backup plan B; however, should never be considered a plan B. This restaurant is the real deal.   I booked a reservation at 9:15pm (used open-table) and right below reservation time I stated under special requests...this is my first time for the restaurant and personally wanted to see if any staff representative can label \"Happy anniversary\" on the table nearby a window for viewing and personally requested to buy a cake and have the plate labeled in icing \"Happy Anniversary Day\". Little did I know that they would actually do this; well turns out they granted all requests. My server was Pedro; hands out provided the best experience for my girlfriend and I. Thank you Pedro for a job well done. \u00a0   My girlfriend and I sat down at exactly 9:15pm as stated, anniversary in coloring on the table and a great view of the bay. Atmosphere like can be a little noisy, but that didn't bother me at all. Service is excellent and the food is superb. It's the real deal. My girlfriend got the lobster plate stuffed with crab for 35 dollars; it's worth every penny!!!! I got the halibut for 32 dollars; best tasty fish ever!!!!! They both are seasonal.  My girlfriend was speechless when she saw the \"Happy Anniversary\" in coloring on the side of the table. Toward the end, Pedro closed it by bringing a tiramisu cake, candle on top and with \"happy anniversary day\" labeled in icing for my girlfriend chanting Happy Anniversary Day. She was blown away!!!!!!!!!! \u00a0Even better, while I expected to pay for the cake (as listed on my special request through open table), I realized that the cake which was 8.50 was reimbursed as a manager compensation. I can't believe this tremendous service, outstanding food, gorgeous view of the bay and last but not least experience exceeded beyond my own expectations. Plan to come here more often. Drive is worth it. Pier 39 parking is free for two hours (make sure you ask waiter to stamp the back of card for you).   Thank you Pedro and Fog Harbor Fish House!!!!!!!",

    "review_text": "Fog Harbor Fish House is located at Pier 39 on the second level. We came here for Dine About Town 2014 and made reservations about a week in advance to secure a spot for dinner. We had parked in the Pier 39 garage where Fog Harbor would validate 2 hours of parking when after 6pm. We came here on a Saturday night and boy, the whole restaurant was packed! There were even people waiting for seats. When you first enter Fog Harbor, you'll notice that they have a really cozy fireplace area for those who are waiting. We were seated in one of the booths near the window with a nice view of the bay. I wish we came a bit earlier when the sun was setting though.  Food- Red Curry Steamed Mussels: The PEI mussels were steamed in garlic, onions, peppers, and a coconut curry broth. The coconut curry broth was not too flavorful. I could barely taste the curry flavor. However, these mussels were REALLY fresh. YUM. Definitely, the freshest mussels I have had compared to all the other restaurants I've been to.  Seafood Cioppino: The cioppino comes with crab, salmon, shrimp, clams, scallops, and mussels stewed in a tomato herb broth with pasta. What I thought was really cute was that Fog Harbor provides you bibs so you won't get food on yourself! A plus for me since I can be a pretty messy eater when it comes to seafood. The tomato herb broth was really flavorful. I ended up taking the complimentary bread and dipped it into the broth. So delicious. My cioppino came with 3 pieces of crab, a good amount of salmon, shrimp, clams, scallops, and mussels. All the seafood were really fresh and in good quality. There's no fishy taste to them. My seafood cioppino also comes with pasta too. Originally, they had forgotten to include it into the dish, but the manager on duty quickly apologized and provided me a bowl of the pasta. Regardless, the seafood cioppino has really BIG portions. They are not skimpy with their seafood.   Molten Chocolate Cake: The cake was served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. The cake was REALLY sweet. The ice cream definitely complemented well with the chocolate cake. Unfortunately, the cake didn't have any melted chocolate in it when I cut it open in half. :(   Our dinner lasted for almost 2 hours! That was pretty surprising but in a good way. :) At the end of the meal, they also provide you Biscoff cookies. Per our waiter, he stated that they are quite delicious when dipped in coffee or milk. The overall service was excellent. The waiter and the manager on duty really made sure that everything was going smoothly and checked up on us. I think this was a successful Dine About Town! :)",

I know there are lots of similar restaurant options nearby, but they either lack in food or interior or attentive servers. I tried to nitpick and find things I don't like about this place, but honestly I couldn't (again, apart from having to deal with major tourist crowds, which is no fault of the restaurant) Just be sure to check out tourist brochures and/or yelp check-in for modest discounts or freebies. In fact, most Wharf/Pier39 restaurants have some form of promotion. They also validate parking so make sure to take advantage of that.  My party had clam chowder, cioppino, crabs, shellfish platter along with some white wine and dessert. \u00a0Clam chowder wasn't the best I've had around bay area, but they were above average. Seafood was fresh and prepared right.  This probably isn't the best place for family with small children, but for more adult-oriented crowd or date nights, I would highly recommend.",

There was a heat wave in sf, and this place was insanely sweaty hot. As I sat at the bar sucking down a cold drink, I looked around at the people sitting at the window seats, where I was going to be sitting soon, to see them all using their napkins to wipe the sweat off their forehead. Nightmare status. NO AC!  This was a dinner for my birthday, and I was hoping to not have to rush through it just to get outside for some fresh air.  Bartender was super nice, don't remember his name, but when we told him we were gonna go get seated so we wanted to pay for the tab, he offered to make us another round of drinks and bring to our table at the happy hour price (which was about $5 cheaper). Awesome.  Told the hostess I would rather die than sit at one of those window seats where the other customers were stewing in their own sweat. So she sat us in this room off to the side of the main dining room, right next to a window that just wasn't in the sun and the window was propped open a bit. Perfect spot!!!!! So thank you so much for being accommodating!  Now for the food! Started with the calamari, lightly battered/fried rings, a nice lemon aoli type dip (very light).  Chili shrimp - woah. SOO good! Spicy! But flavorful!! Used the fresh sourdough bread they give you complimentary to dip in this spicy broth  1/2 garlic crab - good garlic flavor! Tender meat, have to crack it yourself \u00a0 Dungeonous crab cocktail - decent portion of shredded tender crab meat served over ice with cocktail sauce on the side.  Think that was enough? No.  Dinner was a whole Maine lobster with a side of mashed potatoes and a grilled corn on the cob. The lobsters tail was over cooked and chewy, but the claws were tender. Kinda sad about the lobster tail, but I guess that happens when you get a whole lobster?   Dessert was complimentary cause it was my birthday, I was just brought out a dessert the waiter, Rudy picked. It was some sort of warm chocolate rich almost lava melty cake with vanilla ice cream and house made whip cream. Really decadent.   Good service, lovely ambiance, and fresh seafood. Fun birthday dinner ;) Thanks Fog Harbor!",

I'll start by saying I am not a fan of blue cheese AT ALL but figured id try the blue cheese garlic bread since it was free with a yelp coupon. It was AMAZING! Exceeded expectations.   Tried some oysters from here and they were great! I definitely recommend. Next for the clam chowder and it may have been the best chowder I have ever had!!! Loved it   I ordered the entree with the crab cakes, big mistake!!! I love crab cakes but I tasted everything EXCEPT the crab so that's obviously not something I would order here again.   My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips which were exceptional! Wish I had ordered that instead. It's cooked to perfection!   I ordered a Long Island, which was sub par. It's a pretty strong drink but the purpose of the Long Island is to not taste how strong it is. I'd try something different.",

Food was good and so was the service. We got a nice table by the window with beautiful view over Golden Gate and Alcatraz.  We both had Lobster + Crab as main dish and it was super fresh. The warm sourdough bread was also very good. Many of the dishes are not cheap ($25-$35) but you can still find some stuff at around $12-$20.  Overall great experience and wouldn't mind going back!",

You will receive a coupon book which contains a coupon for 20% off your meal!  Boyfriend and I came on a Monday in October around 1pm. It appeared busy and there was a 10-15 minute wait to be seated, but the gentleman seating us stated that it was \"slow\" today!   Luckily, we were seated in an empty connecting room facing the water! I liked this area better because your body is facing the water, as opposed to having to turn your body to face the water in the main dining   We were served HOT, fresh sourdough before receiving our main dishes.   I ordered the king salmon dish which was \"market price\" - apparently market price in October was $32! That's how much a salmon dish at a popular Disneyland restaurant is! It was REALLY good, though! I substituted the potatoes with wild rice.   You receive a Biscoff cookie with your check, and at the bottom of the check is a coupon for the Biscoff Coffee Corner located on the first floor on Pier 39. I think it was 30% off?  Not only was the food good, but the ambiance was quiet (while we were there, at least!) and romantic. I had a hot date, eating deeeeelicious salmon and looking out at the water, tourists, sea lions, Golden Gate Bridge, and Alcatraz.. how could I go wrong?!",

If I had a choice I would have avoided this place and gone somewhere with more of a specialty in seafood. What happened here?   What we had: Seafood platter for 2 (no butter), Iced Tea  The Good: Nice views (if you are lucky) Nice waitress Excellent claim chowder (award winning) Iced tea was clean and refreshing Clean cutlery and dishes The crab was the only redeeming quality of the platter   The Bad: Significant wait times 40 minutes - hour Rude, unorganized, woman who took down wait times (not just to me)  The terrible: Seafood platter for 2 was ~50 dollars The platter was not even close to what we were expecting: We believe it was cove mussels that were used, minuscule amount of meat inside, some were even empty (no QC check) We maybe got 10 mussels in our meal, 10 pieces of shrimp, a few clams, and 2 full sets of crab legs Corn was stale and not fresh, this was evident by the fact the core was dried out  Avoid the platter at all costs - it is not worth it. I could have easily finished it by myself with room to spare. The quality was poor and prices were very high. Check came out to almost 100 dollars after tip for 2 people. Stick with the lobster or other dishes that were more highly reviewed.",

Service: Our server, Meron, was extremely friendly and attentive. She made sure we had everything we needed and came over several times to see how we were doing. She even helped us open the towelette packet and put on our bibs. The manager, I believe, noticed we needed something and immediately helped us and thanked us for being patient. My scarf fell off my chair to the floor and a different server noticed and picked it up for me. The entire staff was top-notch. Excellent service all around. Very impressed (and I'm not usually that impressed by service).  Decor: Dark and intimate. Very fancy and upscale atmosphere, but the attire ranges from casual to fancy. Although it is fancy, nothing about this place screams snobbish (being tourist friendly helps). Even the bathrooms are clean and nice. Definitely request to get a seat by the window. The view of the bay is incredible. Where else can you go fine dining and look out the window and see the boats glistening in the water up close? I felt like I was on the Titanic.  Food: I loved how the Darigold butter was slightly warm and melted, which makes applying it on the sourdough bread much easier. The garlic roasted dungeness crab was superb and was my absolute favorite dish here. It comes with roasted fingerling potatoes, corn on the cob, and garlic oil sauce. Absolutely delicious. After having the perfect dungeness crab as the first dish, it set the bar so high that no other crab dish could really compare. The crab clam chowder was good and rich, and also another favorite. The swordfish and crab linguini alfredo were good, but personally not as impressive. The chocolate lava cake was to die for. It wasn't runny in the middle like other lava cakes, but the instant you put it in your mouth and your tongue touches it, it melts into liquid chocolate. What kind of witchery is this? Seriously. It was like MAGIC. It looked like a regular chocolate cake but it melts into chocolate in your mouth! I still can't get over how amazing and mind-blowing it was. It was very rich like a brownie and the vanilla ice cream pairing was the perfect complement to it. The whipped cream was also sweet and flavorful, and definitely not from a store-bought spray can. I was so fascinated by the lava cake that I immediately googled recipes so I can attempt to make my own cake-that-turns-into-chocolate-the-second-it-\u00adenters-your-mouth.  I am dreaming (&amp; drooling) of the day when I can come back and have another taste of the heavenly dungeness crab and lava cake.",

I also tried the blue cheese bread (free with first time check-in btw). I normally hate blue cheese to. the. max. but I actually really enjoyed this. It did not have the nasty blue cheese taste at all. And they weren't skimpy on the cheese either.  Highly recommend if you're ok with slightly higher prices.

The sun was glaring on our table and made us uncomfortable, so we ended up changing tables. However, once we changed tables, we ended up with a waitress that was extremely grumpy. Maybe she picked up an extra couple shifts? She was tired and lifeless and was not keen on interacting more with us than possible. There were plenty of servers and waiters around on a Sunday evening when only 30-40% of the restaurant was filled, yet our service was so slow. Our waters were too often completely empty. It was also a birthday as stated during our reservation, but we had to remind the waitress a couple times to get a candle... When the desserts came out, low and behold, candleless... and then the waitress brought out another dessert with a candle 20 minutes later. She then, charged us for the extra dessert and we had to ask her to take it off. Sloppy... and off...   The food was quite good and well-priced, as usual and the view was nice, though slightly too sunny during sunset (they didnt lower their shades over the offending windows).

I brought my boyfriend here for lunch for his 20th birthday and I guess we were not prepared for how pricey it was going to be since we just happened to stroll by and decide to eat there since we were hungry and looking for a nice sit down restaurant. We were seated by our sever John who was probably one of the best severs we've ever had! He was professional, sweet and helped us pick out something for appetizers since we both couldn't decide. I ordered the garlic roasted Dungeness crab (it was crab season) and I don't quite remember what my boyfriend had to eat but it seemed like a fried seafood platter of some sort. The garlic crab was SOOO good and it was big enough to satisfy me even with how hungry I was. Unlike other restaurants the garlic flavor could actually be identified while eating the crab meat and not just laying around on the shell. My boyfriend loved his entire plate and finished every bite. For drinks since neither of us are 21 yet, we had the iced tea and the ginger lemonade. OMG I wish I could have that ginger lemonade right now, it was quite strong but combined with the mint and lemon it was a perfect drink paired with the strong garlicy crab. For appetizers my boyfriend ordered the fried calamari since I had never tried it before. It was pretty good even though I know for some people it's an acquired taste but I liked it as soon as I got over the texture :p All in all we had a terrific upscale experience even during lunch hours and customer service here was outstanding so we will definitely be returning. I feel a little guilty for not leaving a bigger tip than I did and after we left we both felt so bad because we have never been served that greatly and John definitely deserved it!!",

Clam Chowder breadbowl was as luxurious and decadent as you want it to be. It is perfection on a cold (or even cool, for this FL gal) day. Tuna Poke was uninspired and lacked texture Chilled half crab was so fresh and delicious. Cracked - easy to eat All of the cocktails we tried were creative, well-balanced, and strong.  Total bill approximately $100 including tax and tip (two people).   *Although I didn't order them, my friend's crab cakes looked way too bread-y for the price*  Bonus points to our Ken doll look-alike server, who proactively separated our checks by couple.   Fog Harbor would've earned 5 stars if not for the lackluster Tuna and high drink prices. Still, not to be missed if you're in the area.",

I mean it is a Saturday and today is the giants vs. LA dodgers game.  This place is upscale, fine dining type of place. I like that they offer places like these in an attraction base environment. Cause sometimes you want to enjoy a nice dinner with a fantastic view. Like this place I'm at right now.   Our server is nice, but when we asked for water she said it's coming, and made it seem like someone else was bringing it but she brought it to us instead. Sometimes she'd walk by just to walk by and see that my water is almost empty and doesn't fill it up, you're just walking back and forth, what are you doing?   Anyway, what we ordered: clam chowder bread bowl, seafood ciopponi with pasta, and steamed clams.  What it tasted like: everything looked amazing. The clam chowder was the best thing we ordered, it was hot and very good. The seafood ciopponi was ok, there was some type of flavor I probably won't remember. The noodles were hard. The seafood in the ciopponi were good, I like the variety. There was salmon, fish, mussel, clams, shrimp and crab legs. The steamed clams, I've had before somewhere else taste better with garlic broth. This chorizo with tomatoes, I didn't really care for.  Would I come back? Maybe I'll try somewhere else first before I give this one another shot.",

    "review_text": "We had the greatest service and the food was phenomenal. NOT! I wanted to treat my little girl to her favorite meal of fish and chips at her favorite place in the City, Pier 39. Since my daughter was famished, I stopped by the first restaurant that served a kids portion of fish and chips. It was Fog Harbor Fish House. What a big mistake that was. Our waitress, who acted like she had some sort of hearing impairment, seemed like she was on 'something'. I had to repeat my order four times. Yes four times. But whatever. Maybe she was having a bad day. We ordered the kids fish and chips, curry mussels, and the cheeseburger. After waiting for about ten minutes, my daughter started to complain for that she was hungry, and was there any bread for her to nibble on before her fish and chips? \u00a0Looking around for our waitress, she was no where to be found. Finally the double doors to the kitchen opened and out came our deaf waitress carrying our mussels. She sets \u00a0it down and I start digging in. I offered my daughter some. She refused, she just wanted bread. The mussels were fresh, but didn't taste curry enough (probably the freshest thing that we ordered) and \u00a0the curry sauce just sat at he bottom of the dish. It was like the mussels were steamed separately and the curry sauce was just an afterthought. \u00a0I looked up to ask for the bread, but the deaf waitress disappeared again. She not only forgot our bread but also a bowl to put my shells. I told my daughter to simply drink her cranberry juice that she ordered. She was quiet. I asked her what's wrong. She just looked at the juice. I grabbed the juice and sipped throughout he straw and to my horror that juice was SPOILED! \u00a0Half-way through eating, the double doors flung wide open and out comes our deaf waitress. I practically shouted for a bread basket. And as quickly as she came through the doors she quickly disappeared through them again. But too fast for me to request a bowl for my shells and to fill my water cup. Sigh. She comes out 5 minutes later with warm sourdough bread and butter. My little girl was finally in food heaven. After 10 minutes, my daughter's long-awaited fish and chips and my cheeseburger finally came. I finally asked for a bowl for my shells. Our waitress noticed that the cup was still full of cranberry juice. I politely told her that it was a bit rotten. She stated she'll take the juice out of my bill. My burger looked awesome. But at the first bite I noticed the burger was a bit tough and the bacon old and leathery, liked it was MICROWAVED :( NOT GOOD. The fries were okay, nothing spectacular. I was thirsty and asked my daughter for a little of her water, since i drank all mine and the deaf waitress was now where to be found. Then I looked at my daughter's fish and chips. I asked her why she was just picking at it. She didn't say anything. I asked her if she wanted a to go box for it. She said, \"No box, please\". She NEVER says this. I took a fork full of fish, that $hiT was COLD AND HARD! OMG. I quickly looked around for our deaf and invisible waitress, but she was no where to be found. I finally saw her robustness and asked for the check and two boxes (hey, I wasn't going to waste food. My dog hadn't eaten and could use the cold fish and hard burger). The check came and as I was about to sign it, the manager came up to me and inquired about our meal. I made a face and rolled my eyes. \u00a0He said that wasn't a good sign and to tell him what happened. So I proceeded to tell him about the fish and chips and cranberry juice. I was about to tell him about our lack of service, but he grabbed my check and went to fix my bill. He took out my daughter's meal and gave me an extra 20% off. \u00a0He even offered to fix my daughter another meal. Nice gesture, but it was too late. This place already gave me indigestion. Any minute longer there would have given me food poising.  *KUDOS*:  clean bathrooms my adjusted bill sourdough bread mussels (but see below)  *ATROCIOUSNESS*:  service fish and chips cheeseburger with the leathery bacon the lack of 'curriness' in the mussels",

The cocktail menu is a bit pricey at over $10 a drink, but consistent with other bars we've visited at Fisherman's Warf. We both had Moscow Mules; they were crisp and refreshing, garnished with lime and ginger.  More importantly, you will be delighted in the freshness and high quality of their foods, especially their seafood. Both my fianc\u00e9e and I had their blue cheese wedge salad after seeing one delivered to another person at the bar. The salad looked mouth watering when we saw it, then we proved it was delicious when we ordered our own. It is loaded with creamy blue cheese, crumbles of blue cheese and bacon.  I had the Seared Alaskan Halibut and it was perfect: flaky, over a bed of quinoa, leafy greens, dried berries and a delicious sauce to bring all the flavors together. My fianc\u00e9e did an appetizer combo for dinner including a crab cocktail and clam chowder, she said both items were fresh and delicious.  For those with gluten sensitivity, their menu is clearly marked with all the items that are \"prepared without gluten.\" They have a significant selection of gluten free dishes and one gluten free desert. Our server, albeit quirky, was very conscientious about my needs and took ownership of communicating my needs to the kitchen.  We'd also like to thank them for listing the dungeoness crab cocktail on their receipts as \"dung crab cocktail.\" My fianc\u00e9e and I can verify that the crab cocktail didn't taste like dung, it tasted like crab. However, we we appreciated the laugh.  Overall, a great meal and a wonderful view of the bay. It may be a touristy due to its location on Pier 39. Nevertheless, you'll get a great meal in a nice atmosphere!",

The sour dough bread was the best, and it's baked every 15 min! \u00a0I had the crab cakes, and they were Yummmmy.  Everything was fresh, and served hot. We did not feel pushed to finish our meal, so they could seat someone else. \u00a0GREAT PLACE. \u00a0 If I go back, I will NOT use the parking garage (big rip -off) and will go straight to FOG HARBOR.",

    "review_text": "This is your typical touristy restaurant in the Pier 39 area, which decent tasting food and a nice view, but inflated prices. Make sure you check in on Yelp to get a free Blue Cheese Garlic Bread appetizer. I came for my friend's birthday (Kellie C.!) since they have a separate room for large parties in the back of the restaurant, and were able to accommodate a group of 18 on a Thursday night. We came in around 8:15pm, and the table was ready, so we were seated right away. Although the table sat 18, we could've used a little more room. However, it worked out fine, and I got to try:  -Blue Cheese Garlic Bread (Fresh Sourdough, Topped w/Garlic, Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese, Herbs, $8): Just ok. The blue cheese overpowered all the other flavors, and you couldn't taste the garlic. The bread was also too crunchy for my liking. Skip! -Oysters (Served w/Cocktail Sauce, Dozen $26, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>): The oysters were fresh, but the cocktail sauce and mignonette were just ok. I wish they had given us some Tabasco with the oysters. Skip! -Crispy Lemon Calamari (Seasoned w/Lemon, Served w/Lemon Aioli, $12, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#3lMGE6tFW3afyze8HNomkA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>): Yuck.. the calamari rings were chewy, and the batter was soggy. This is one of the worst fried calamari dishes I've had, and they should really re-look at their recipe. Skip! -Ahi Poke (Marinated Raw Tuna, Avocado, Mango, Sesame-Soy Sauce, Wasabi Aioli, $16): Ok. The tuna tasted fresh, and I liked the wasabi aioli. However, the sesame soy sauce didn't have much flavor, and the dish overall was bland. Skip! -Crab Louis ($22, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#_pzD387ZKQjuxDPLN0KIFA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>): They didn't skimp on the crab, and it tasted really fresh, which was great. However, there were pieces of cartilage in the crab, and the salad itself was bland. I wouldn't order this again. -Crab Roll (Fresh Crab, Celery, Shallot Aioli, Served on a Buttered Roll w/Sweet Potato Fries, $19, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#FyzyT_3ZvIESH5I0qp6APg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>): Pretty good if you like mayo, and I liked that they toasted the roll nicely. The sweet potato fries were also really good. Recommended! -Fish &amp; Chips (Hand Dipped in \"Anchor Steam\" Beer Batter w/Cole Slaw, $17, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#EuuXw-pZ356IX--lG1jksA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>): They give you a huge portion (2 large and 2 medium sized fish sticks, fries, cole slaw), but the fish was just ok. I didn't like the taste and consistency of the batter- it tasted bitter from the beer, and was too crunchy. The cole slaw was also just so-so since it was very bland. However, the fries were done nicely, and the tartar sauce was delicious. -Award Winning Clam Chowder (The Best in San Francisco, Bowl, $8, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#s7bQ8LaMVBCTTvrlIYQd4Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-\u2026</a>): This was a pretty good version of clam chowder! It was rich and creamy, and there were big pieces of clam in the chowder. Recommended! -Apple Crisp a la Mode (House-Made w/Granny Smith Apples, Walnuts, Butter Crumb, Served Warm, Topped w/Vanilla Ice Cream, $8.50): Ok. I liked the butter crumb, but the apples were a little hard. I wouldn't order this again. -Warm Chocolate Lava Cake (w/Creamy Chocolate Center, Served w/Vanilla Ice Cream, $8.50): Just ok, nothing special. I wouldn't order this again.  The best dishes from here were the Crab Roll and Clam Chowder, and the fries from the fish and chips. Although I don't think I'd come back for those dishes again, I would recommend ordering them if you are dining here. The service was good up until the end- it took them a long time to bring the dessert and our check. Make sure you ask them to validate your parking ticket if you parked in the structure across the street. \u00a0  Overall, there are so many better restaurants to eat at in SF, and it's not worth coming here unless you can expense your meal, or if you really want a view of the pier area.",

So we're glad we stayed and after we made some crazy eye contact with who we assumed was our server, it got better from there.  Definitely order clam chowder, whatever the option it may be, bowl, cup, in a bread bowl, you will not go wrong.   I had the crab roll, it was a good amount of crab in a butter toasted super soft bun. My wife ordered the soup and salad and it was perfect.",

Whoever is cutting it needs to learn 1) use a serrated knife and 2) saw back and forth. \u00a0Otherwise you are killing the good efforts of the baker to make great bread.  Overall, not bad. We'll return another day, but will probably skip the kid's mac and cheese and go for something else.",

However, for some reason, a new server Morgan took over and our time here became almost perfect. She was very kind and always had a small on, and had great customer service for a high quality restaurant. She checked up on us as much as she can, and really changed our time there. I highly recommend asking for her if you want great customer service.  As for the food, the seafood was high quality and everything was absolutely delicious. We had the crab and avocado salad, clam chowder, and the crab ceviche to start off. All of the flavors were upto par and super fresh. I recommend trying their whole crab, their mixed grill, and their shellfish platter for a variety. You can order for 1-2 servings with the shellfish platter. All of the seafood was very fresh and seasoned well.   Overall, I will definitely be returning for their quality seafood and the customer service we received in the end. One tip: make reservations for the view because the view really makes it much more special. Thank you Morgan for a wonderful Christmas Eve dinner with my family!",

My cousin came in on a cruise ship en route to Alaska or something and she wanted to see my family while she was at port.   Now - I have 2 kids, a 2 year old and a 11 month old, so I am always cautious not to go out to restaurants that are not kid friendly. Luckily, most tourist venues fit the bill - even nicer one's like Fog Harbor. \u00a0  I made reservations right here with Open Table, noted that I had 2 kids and we were set-up with crayons, a coloring menu and a very attentive, patient staff.   Now onto the food - it was good, nothing too fancy. I had a delicious steak, fried calamari, my wife enjoyed an Ahi Tuna and our guests were full from Chinese Dim-Sum - but they did have some lovely shrimp cocktail.  I can't complain, the 4 stars were really for the kid-friendly atmosphere and great views from almost anywhere inside. Oh and they validated parking.   TLDR version: Good for kids, good food, validate parking, enjoy the Pier :)  p.s. there is an awesome merry-go-round at the end of the pier, it was epic. :)",

Fog Harbor was full of tourists but didn't feel touristy.  Our food was AMAZING. She had shrimp cocktail for dinner and was happy with the six very large shrimp plus the warm boudin bread and butter.

For our entrees my husband ordered the seafood cioppino which was chock full of large shell fish and a broth that lit up our tastebuds. He's literally still craving it 2 weeks later. I on the other hand decided to be difficult and create my own dish that was not on the menu. Our waiter Richard who was phenomenal and beyond accommodating, brought me exactly what I was craving (lobster and Dungeness crab pasta in a cream sauce) A-mazing!!

We tried: -Clam Chowder -Whole Garlic Crab -Fish &amp; Chips  The clam chowder wasn't to my taste - it was incredibly thick and lacking flavor. The garlic crab was great - sweet crab cooked perfectly. The side of corn on the cob was horribly overcooked though. The fish &amp; chips were good, with a light crispy batter and moist fish. However, the fries that it came with were bleh.  The best part was our server. I don't know his name, but he was the BEST. He was on top of it and very friendly. I can't say he reflects the rest of the staff, as a table near us wasn't greeted for several minutes and had to notify the hostess.  All in all, we probably wouldn't return, as touristy areas aren't really our thing. However, I'd recommend this to others who plan to be in that area and are in the mood for crab.",

    "review_text": "Even though its centered in one of the most touristy areas in sf, Fog Harbor was an awesome standout seafood restaurant. Although the exterior isn't much to look at, once you go upstairs and even to the waiting area, it's a really nice fine dining experience.   A few friends and I were really in the mood for oysters at around 11am and found fog harbor through yelp. The view from the inside is amazing as you can look out across the pier and see all the boats and tourists wandering about.   My gf and I shared a dozen oysters ($25), a clam chowder bread bowl ($10) and a Dungeness crab roll ($19). I just had to order a crab dish as they just started their crab season just the day before. \u00a0  The oysters were freshly shucked (they shrunk as I added lemon juice) and very sweet, definitely did not disappoint. The clam chowder was very creamy and had lots of clams, although a bit lacking in the amount of actual chowder but its a novelty item so I didn't mind. The crab roll was overflowing with their crab mixture which had good amounts of crab that you could taste in a nicely toasted butter roll.   At the end of our meal, our server notified us that they were doing a promotion in which you rate your experience on your smartphone on their website and you get a complimentary dessert!! And they aren't the skimpy \"one ice cream scoop\" desserts. Actual full fledged desserts like a 5\" Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, huge slices of tiramisu, bread pudding. We got the cranberry and apple crumb cake with vanilla bean ice cream. A great way to finish off the meal.   Our meal for the two of us came to about $75 because we were also ordering a few beers. I would definitely come back here again. Service and quality of food was spot on.",

    "review_text": "Went to this restaurant based on Yelp reviews, the menu and the proximity to our hotel. I never would have expected such poor service from a restaurant like this, especially one in a prime tourist location. A little background, we had reservations for Sunday at 4:00 PM. Here's a summary of our experience here after being seated:  -No one acknowledged us, no one as in any other waitstaff -Another server had to take our order 10 min after being seated. He tells us out waiter didn't know he had the section we were in. -Our waiter served a table that was seated after us and still don't stop by our table which was four feet directly across from their table -We didn't get water after 20 minutes and that's after asking multiple times  -Our waiter didn't acknowledge us for over 15 min, didn't say hello or apologize for the wait -We had to ask for bread -It took 50 min to get our food -We had to flag down our waiter to get boxes and the check -The general manager didn't even ask how everything was even though it was obvious we weren't happy and were looking all over the place for our waiter throughout our entire time there  I cannot stress how bad this dining experience was. How could a tourist restaurant be so poor in customer service? It should be the exact opposite in my opinion. I will not be returning here and will tell others to not go here. The food was mediocre. We ordered the blue cheese garlic bread, clam chowder bowl, crab roll, and the mixed grill. Nothing memorable besides the food was rather bland especially the mixed grill plate. Don't waste your time and money going here. The view of the water and Alcatraz isn't worth it, trust me, the ambiance isn't worth it. If anyone from this restaurant is reading this (which I highly doubt), I'd recommend on training your staff better, especially your general manager working on August 11, 2013.",

Service was great; from the hostess to our server. On to the most important part and the reason why you're reading this review... The food:   - Oysters: Fresh. Fresh. Fresh. I am not the biggest fan of oysters, but I had to try them. They are the cleanest oysters I've ever tasted. I could've eaten half a dozen by myself.  - Ahi Tuna Poke: Decent size chunks with avocado and I believe it was mango as well? The Sriracha drizzled around the plate adds a kick of spice if that's what you're looking for. Down side to this plate was that there was only 3 wonton chips to share!   - Clam Chowder: You can't come to SF and not have a bowl of clam chowder. You won't regret it! So rich and creamy, you can actually tell that there are clams in there! (Also had clam chowder from Nick's Lighthouse... Fog Harbor blows them out of the water)   - Garlic Roasted Dungeness Crab: YUMMY. So glad we went with this over the steamed dungeness. It had so much more flavor to it and was way more juicy than we expected, which is a definitely plus. (Tip: Dip the corn into the garlic/butter... Also, if you prefer mashed potatoes to the fingerling potatoes, just ask your server to substitute it for you)  Overall, we had a great experience. We also ordered 2 drinks from the bar to go with our meal which brought our grand total to ~$108 (excluding tip). Will definitely be back again!",

We passed by this place, thought the decor was nice enough to eat here... The crab house next door didn't look nice to us...  Had a spicy Bloody Mary ($10) at the bar while waiting for our able, it was sooo spicy, but a good one! Bartenders were very strict at carding me! They insisted to see my ID first before making me a drink! ( Hubby had my ID at the moment &amp; he went to restroom) Responsible! That's a good thing. :)   Got a nice booth facing the waterfront views, a dozen of raw oysters ($2.5 each) to start, the oysters were fresh, but the sauce wasn't so great to go with those. The complimentary bread was delicious.   I had whole Dungeness crab ($39), 2 lb crab steamed, served with mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed veggies: the crab was not meaty, very plain, flavorless, I had to dip all the crab meat in Tabasco to finish it.   Hubby had Linguini &amp; Clams ($18), fresh clams, garlic, olive oil, tomatoes: he didn't like it too much, flavorless  Had one more Bloody Mary and a Stella on draft, didn't like the food. We have had wayyyy much better seafood in LA, disappointed, the service was good, the views made up a little bit, but still not impressed. :( Let's try some other places next time.....",

    "review_text": "We wanted to have some lovely seafood while we were in San Francisco, and we chose the Fog Harbor Fish House from the many options on Fisherman's Wharf. Overall, very high marks. First, the view is lovely, and the restaurant itself is very nice and well-appointed. A nice place for a relaxed lunch, date night or a special occasion. Second, the food: -I ordered the ginger coconut cocktail, which was generally very good and tasty, but I felt had a bit too much coconut. It was kind of offputting in mouthfeel but did have a delightful ginger/lemon/spritzer type of flavor. I was torn between loving it and hating it and in the end only drank about half. -The chowder. Oh my god, get some.Some of the best chowder you will ever have. Thick, creamy, silky, delicious. Think cup, but go bowl. You're welcome. -Poke. I do love tuna, so poke is a tough thing to ignore on a menu that isn't in Hawaii. This particular poke is mixed with fresh avocado and mango, with a small amount of seaweed like you'd find in a seaweed salad. Light, gingery, soy-ey (??) and really yum. -Salmon. I got the salmon entree, which was just delicious. Cooked perfectly, with a med-rare center and beautiful grill marks on the outside, set over a creamy sauce with spinach and potatoes. A beautiful piece of fish and a huge portion! -Tuna -- perfectly cooked again with a nice big rare center. Served over a great hash-like mix that included these delightful bits of bok choy. SUPER yum.  In all the food was really excellent. We didn't have time for dessert. Our server was good, helpful and composed. Not cheap -- we had two apps, two entrees and two drinks and the tab topped $100 for LUNCH. Still.... We would definitely come back!",

I have to confess that we decided to eat here because our parking garage said they validated parking, so we got 2 hours free :). We just wanted a good bowl of clam chowder, in a bread bowl, of course. We got right in, and got a window table, and the view was amazing! The server (I think she said her name was Clementine, maybe?) was there promptly to take our drink orders and had our iced teas and water out in a flash. We ordered 4 clam chowder bread bowls ($10 each, not bad for a nice restaurant on the wharf) and we had those in less than five minutes, so so so so so yummy! It was the best clam chowder any of us have ever had, (we've tried a lot of clam chowder). We will definitely be back and recommend this restaurant to others!! All in all, great view of the wharf, great service, awesome atmosphere and DELICIOUS food!",

    "review_text": "Going to school in rural Pennsylvania made me crave for some good, comforting SF clam chowder. I've gone to the Pier Market for chowder in the past, but thought I'd try this place. I was happily satisfied.  Clam chowder - very good and full of tender bits of clam. It's not life changing or the best ever, but well worth the price.  Steamed mussels in the curry/tomato/white wine sauce - savory, cooked perfectly and absolutely flavorful. Dipped my bread in that sauce too.  Crab cakes - light and fluffy.  Complimentary sour dough- warm, fresh, chewy, delicious!  Venue- gorgeous view of the pier/sea/boats. Clean interior. Nice and cozy ambience.  Bill was ~$50 for two people.  Helpful Tidbits:  1. Recommend making early reservations if you want to see the sunset! 2. Free sour dough so why order a bread bowl of chowder?  3. A bowl of chowder with bread is pretty filling. We felt really full after finishing 2 other appetizers. Glad we didn't order more. 3. They will validate 2 free hours at the parking lot at dinner time.",

I made a reservation for Sunday lunch and made a request for a table with a good view, since it was for a special occasion: my dad's birthday. \u00a0Upon being seated, I looked around and realized that they really did save one of the best seats in the house even though the rest of the area was full, plus, they wrote happy birthday on our paper table cloth, and of course they offered me to pick any of the desserts on their menu for my dad! \u00a0I was very pleased!   Food: My family ordered the lobster mac n cheese, the cioppino, and the clam linguine. \u00a0There was also perfectly fresh and warm sourdough bread. \u00a0The lobster mac n' cheese had a fair amount of large chunks of lobster, so I was pretty happy. \u00a0My mother was very happy about the cioppino; it had a nice range and variety of clam, mussel, fish, and some crab legs, plus, she reported everything was very fresh. Plus the soup was delicious. My dad is a quiet man so I didn't hear much about the linguine, but it looked great. Overall, everything was very good. The dessert we got for my dad was the apple crumb pie + ice cream on top, which was great!   Price: Fair for the freshness of the seafood and the occasion.   Service / Experience: As written above, everything was perfect. \u00a0Our waitress was always nearby, brought everything as requested, and was very pleasant. \u00a0The view is of the bay, Marina, and Alcatraz.   Extra: They will validate your Pier 39 parking for 1 hour for lunch, 2 hours for dinner.   Thanks Fog Harbor Fish House, I'm very happy I brought my dad here!",

We started off with drinks: Alcatraz Escape and the Blueberry Ginger beer drink (don't remember the name). AE was OK, I liked my blueberry ginger beer concoction. We then moved to the starters: Blue cheese garlic bread, Fried Scallops, Crab Cake &amp; fries. Special shout out to the fries! Just the right amount of crunch and softness that I like in my fries. CRAB CAKE was the bomb, LOVED IT! Blue cheese garlic bread was tasty. The fried scallops did not do anything for us and we left that plate almost untouched. The dips we got with each of the dishes was awesome! Unfortunately, after the above dishes we felt stuffed and did not actually try the sea food platters/ entrees that we set out to originally have. Well, then again, there is always a next time!",

Her Clam Chowder on the other hand, she took 2 bites and she was done! she said the clam chowder tasted like its been sitting out to get it to our table.

We made reservations for two on a Friday night and were seated within minutes of arriving--make sure to request for a table with a window view as the view is breathtaking.   As for the menus, both the food and wine lists were extensive with multiple options and lots of specials. The sourdough bread that they serve is absolutely delicious and probably one of the best breads that I have tasted. We had the Steamed Clams as our appetizer and that was definitely the best dish of the night--most likely because of the amazing chorizo butter sauce. For our main courses, we had Swordfish and the Lobster Mac 'n Cheese. Although both were good, they were not anything special which was very disappointing (especially considering the price).  In the end, I would recommend this restaurant simply for its location and views but I don't think I would go back again for the food other than appetizers.",

    "review_text": "Lunch cost $85 and included a somewhat controversial \"Sf Emp Ord 4%\" tax that I did not notice until after I got home. Google the quote for more information like I had to since I am from the east coast. Then we paid tax on the food bill subtotal + Sf Emp Ord 4% for a total bill of $93(rounded). Fog Harbor bill includes a suggested gratuity amounts. The suggested gratuity excludes this controversial tax, as it should. It does not feel right also for a tax to include this Sf Emp Ord 4% either (taxing a tax); a double tax situation.   Controversy aside, the food is very good-unequivocally. The Wedge Blue Cheese Salad with bacon was perfect with the sourdough bread. We had the fried combo(calamari, fish, &amp; shrimp), 2 orders. I prefer the squiggly ends of the calamari. My companion likes only the rounded pieces. We traded and ate the pieces each of us like since each plate had some of both. Forgo drinks, if you want to be frugal. Our food came to $52, not bad considering this is SF, Fisherman's Wharf &amp; on the pier. The view is tax worthy. The ambiance of Fog Harbor &amp; the pier area in tax worthy. So freak, perhaps taxing patrons directly for employees health insurance is okay too, just as long as the employees get all the money and none of it magically improves Fog Harbors bottom line. \u00a0The folks making all the wonderful food appear deserve health insurance. That is not a controversy for me.   We were seated at a window table for 2 looking at Pier 42 from Pier 39.",

    "review_text": "On the No1DP's last visit to see me, he made a request: he wanted to try SF's clam chowder. What the No1DP asks he gets, I just happen to be the lucky woman to tag along. I had another restaurant in mind that was a little less touristy but after some research and consideration we ended up eating here instead.  VENUE: We went on a Sunday night, just as the sun was about to set. The host put us in a table right next to the window. The No1DP and I were able to watch the people walking around Pier 39 and people just getting off the ferries. While the No1DP and I weren't able to secure a window that overlooked Fisherman's Wharf we weren't too far from those windows and we could look at the massive amount of tourists walking the wharf.   SERVICE: Service was excellent, as expected from a fine seafood establishment.   WINE: Both of us had white wines. Although I don't remember specifics on the grape varietal, I remember my wine was a little sweet and went well with my dish.  FOOD The Yelp check-in gets you blue cheese garlic bread. The blue cheese was a bit strong, but it's good for anyone that really likes blue cheese.  We got bowls of their famous clam chowder. One of the better clam chowders I've tasted, and the No1DP agrees. It may look watery when you're served the bowl but don't let that fool you. Instead we were treated to a quite creamy (and not starchy!) soup with good amounts of CLAM. They were quite generous with the clam but they better be considering how much you pay for a bowl!  No1DP got one of their special dishes lobster mac and cheese. As a New Englander, he has a right to be picky about his seafood, especially his lobster. His dish was \"quite comparable to an equivalent dish I'd be served back home\". Lucky him. I tried it and it's quite the rich dish - the cheese is RICH and one big bite can make you significantly fuller than before... No1DP ate less than half of his dish. The lobster was to his liking.  I got another special dish: 0.5 lbs lobster stuffed with dungeness crab. I thought this would be an excellent dish as this would combine two of my great seafood loves - lobster and dungeness crab. When I was served this dish the tail part was the lobster while the head was stuffed with the crab. The crab was quite sweet, I'm not sure if this is supposed to be how the crab naturally tastes, but the sweetness took away from the crab. Lobster was excellent, soft and buttery yet I could taste the lobster. Spinach and mashed potatoes were good sides yet were not too rich to overpower the seafood.   Dessert consisted of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The sugar was hard enough that I can crack it open with one swift tap of the spoon. Custard was creamy yet not too rich. The speculoos cookie they put on top was a nice touch and gave the dessert a subtle ginger taste if you eat it.   Though Fog Harbor can be considered a touristy restaurant to some, the food was still excellent. Thanks to the No1DP for another excellent eating adventure!",

We decided to just play it safe at pier 39.  We were debating between dining here or crab house, and finally settled for this. I ordered the calamarie and bowl of clam chowder. \u00a0My girlfriends ordered the seafood penne, new york steak, and the seafood cioppino. We all took a sample bite of each other's orders. Their clam chowder was good, but not as \"award winning\" as id expected. Calamarie tasted mediocre. \u00a0I actually only ate about three pieces, they werent very appetizing for some reason. My friends steak was kind of dry, and the penne and cioppino just were too bland for my liking.   Overall, i probably wouldnt come back. Prices were fair for being in the heart of a tourist attraction, but i feel like i would be more satisfied elsewhere for the same price. Pass.",

When we sat down I saw a window table open up and I asked the waitress if we could simply move but she had to make a big deal about it and go talk to somebody else to see if it was okay to get up and move two tables. And wow can u believe she said no! That automatically dropped her tip by $10. Her loss. I wasn't very happy about that. Plus she felt super fake. The crab fritters were delicious so was the clam chowder and the shell fish platter, honestly I was not a big fan of the lobster mac and cheese it did not appeal to me at all. The service was okay the food was good. I'd probably go somewhere else before coming back there.",

    "review_text": "Back in Maryland, where the Chespeake churns and the Old Bay Seasoning flows, the crustacean of the day is the blue crab. Here in San Francisco, the crab of choice is the stout Dungeness, a veritable wrestler versus the comparatively dainty, ballerina-esque blueies we have back where I'm from. Having had my fair share of crab in my life, devoured mostly with mallet and mini fork in hand mind you, I was ready to give the Dungeness a try.  After a long day exploring Fisherman's Wharf, a nice plate of crab cakes, some fries, and slaw just felt right. The restaurant was quickly becoming crowded so I felt lucky that my two friends and I managed to snag a window table. Tired and hungry, we were all happy to be greeted by a basket of steaming hot San Francisco Sourdough and softened butter. I've always appreciated the tart bite and hearty crust of a good sourdough in sandwich service, so the pure unadulterated experience of quality bread led us off on a good start. Hey, it's the little things in life that count. Soon thereafter, our food came out. I was greeted by a surprisingly ordinary plate of two smallish pan fried crab cakes, fries, and slaw. Unfortunately, the \"ordinary\" aspect seemed to be a theme as I began to eat my dish.   Strike one was that the crab cakes were merely warm and didn't seem terribly fresh. Furthermore, while I was hoping for delicious lumps of sweet crab, I instead got a pretty bland interior which tasted more of filler than crab. Whether or not it was indeed filler and breadcrumb I was tasting or it was the way the strangely finely minced crab was prepared that threw my tastebuds off is up for debate, but it was disappointing. While crisp on the outside, the inside was mushy and pasty. Luckily or not, since they were small, I didn't really have much to go through before it was gone. A truly great crab cake should highlight the quality and flavour of the crustacean that honorably served in its preparation, not of bread and onion. The fries were also a disappointment. While they were hot, they were devoid of seasoning. Unsalted fries are a sin! Why why why would you ever serve unsalted fries? Finally, the slaw and remoulade were inoffensive, which is to say, pretty unmemorable.   Moving on to the service and space, I should first point out that getting to Fog Harbor can be a little tricky. You must access it from the upper balcony level of Pier 39. Once inside, you're greeted by a nice dining space. It's open, the servers are dressed professionally, and if you get a window seat, you will be greeted by a beautiful view of the bay. Service was also good. Our server was quick, friendly, and readily agreed to split our check.   So why the two stars? Well, while the service and space were very good overall, I was disappointed by the food. My dish was bland, uninspired, and got literally beat out by bread and butter. In addition, later that night, my stomach really did not agree with what I ate. Considering I ate toast for breakfast that day, I think my cakes are the guilty ones here. I hope that I maybe caught Fog Harbor on an off day since others seem to really like this place. Unfortunately for me, it just didn't hit the mark.",

His mashed potatoes were also pretty good. I ordered the fresh salmon, since salmon is my absolute favorite thing to put into my stomach. It was not as large as my boyfriend's tuna. It was like a little strip, which I wouldn't have minded if it wasn't over-grilled and burnt. The moist parts tasted good, but for the most part, it was very dry. The smokiness of the greens under the fish were good on their own, but as a part of this dish, it made everything taste overcooked and burnt. I wish I had ordered something else instead.  All in all, it's pretty good, but I'm not sure if I would come back again. Especially since I'm not a baller (lol) and the salmon was not as tasty as I had hoped.",

We yelped this before we came to the pier and gave this place a try. I know they were busy and i didnt mind the wait for an 1 hour and a half. Luckily there was a lounge so my boyfriend and i were able to rest. When we were seated we thought we got the best seat because it was at the corner near the windows. We can see the fisherman wharf but on my right, people from outside can see us which was awkward. So the waiter was very sweet and was kind to take a picture of my boyfriend and I. Since I LOVE the picture so much, i had to give him a tip. So anyways, 1 star for the service. Food....however.... Was HORRIBLE. My boyfriend order the Surf and Turf, medium rare. Nope. It was well-cooked. Then he ask the waiter for a recommendation for a heavy wine. My boyfriend thought it was all right. Wasn't heavy for him, but everyone is different. So for my food. I order the Caesar salad (idk the full name but it's close to it). Maybe it was me, but I have never really experience not having my lettuce cut so i had to cut them myself. I asked for chicken too but they only gave me like 8 small pieces and 3 croutons.....I was upset. I had way better salad at other places. Other than that, if you love oysters, you gotta try the baked one. IT WAS DELICIOUS! +1 Star. If i knew it was that good, i would have ordered three instead of that salad -_- but nope. The osyter appetizer came after our dinner. But yeah i don't think i'll come back :l",

Food- we started out with the Crispy Bay Scallops.. yum! And Blue cheese garlic bread which I really liked. There was so much on the menu it was hard to decide LOL. I ended up ordering the Fried Combo (fish, calamari, shrimp, fries, cole slaw). Everything was delicious, and it's a big dish. My partner ordered the Cioppino, which was truly amazing. So good! I wish I had ordered it also. We ordered 2 cocktails each but maybe we're raging alcoholics because we thought they needed more alcohol LOL. Next time we'll order wine instead.   And yes we'll definitely be back. Pier 39 is tourist-y and we're locals, but no matter. It's actually nice to feel like we're on vacation in our own city! I will definitely take my visitors here, it's a winner. Oh and awesome service!",

We started with some beer/wine once we finally got service...the drinks were good once we got them after our appetizer had arrived....the was the start of the bad meal with horrible service.   We ordered the baked oysters to start because they resembled oysters Rockefeller which we love no matter what type of oysters they are. What came out was a weird cream based, over sauced oyster plate. I was ok with eating them until I got to the last one which was totally and completely rank! I'm not a huge oyster aficionado but not only did it taste as though the cute sea lions down the pier had pooped in them but it smelled totally stank (which I actually thought was either my servers breath or a fellow patrons unfortunate gas at first...a little harsh and I feel bad for ever thinking that but I never thought an oyster or any seafood for that matter could smell that bad) Ruined the rest of the meal...the only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because my Salmon entree, which was a special with veggies including Brussels sprouts which are some \u00a0of my favs, was pretty good after I sucked on a lemon, downed my entire water, and shot some tobacco sauce in attempt to get the bad oyster taste out of my mouth. Little did I know that would be the only water I would be offered throughout the rest of my meal...  Super unfortunate because I'm a huge foodie and love using yelp but this turned out to be an awful choice. Would have walked a bit further into the heart of Fishermans wharf to try different food or the street car (cods something...) everyone is raving about.",

    "review_text": "I was impressed by the reviews and wanted to have some good seafood while in San Francisco, hence the visit to Fog Harbor. It was good but for the price I expected more. My fianc\u00e9 and I came for lunch on a Monday. I made reservations online, which was great because I probably changed the date and time at least three times. It wasn't too crazy during our visit and we were able to get a table overlooking the harbor, so four stars for that.   However, I'd rather have an awesome meal than a good view, and that's where the issue is. We shared a small bowl of claim chowder, a Blueberry Press cocktail, and ordered the fish and chips and a spring special, the Alaskan halibut. The clam chowder was very tasty although it didn't have as many clams as I'd hoped. But still very good. And with the crunchy sourdough bread? Yes, very very good. I ordered the skinny cocktail, which is some locally distilled vodka, blueberries, lemon, soda water, and Splenda. They gave me the regular by mistake, which has ginger beer, and I quickly noticed. The regular was very good and much better than the skinny (unfortunately he whisked the first one away rather than letting us keep it). But in neither drink could I really taste any of that locally distilled vodka, so three stars on that one since the drink was $12.50. For that price I should at least taste some vodka!  On to the main courses. The fish and chips came with coleslaw and fries and were very good. It had large chunks of well cooked and nicely battered (Anchor Steam) fish, but I would expect all of this for a price of $17. \u00a0I ordered the seared halibut, which came with quinoa arugula salad, tomato relish, pine nuts, and dried cranberries topped with a citrus buerre blanc and crispy leeks. The quinoa salad was delicious; it had a great flavor and the ingredients really went well together. But the main attraction, the fish, was a disappointment. It had a good texture but was lacking in flavor and was also dry. The presentation looked amazing but it fell short of my expectations.   Our server was courteous and prompt with the service and apologized twice for the drink mistake. Overall okay but I will try something else next time I visit the city.",

Each time ordering wine or bringing a bottle of wine.   Each trip I had to wait to be seated but wait wasn't too bad. Host was correct on the time.   Seated and menus were provided promptly. Practically no wait was resulting for placing order. Initial drink delivery was prompt. The wine or corkscrew and ice were delivered promptly. Another trip a Manhattan. Manhattan was made nice and stiff.  Food order was taken and again no really a wait from order point to arrival. We had a free garlic bread coupon to which the wait staff was happy to apply to the whole table of eight of us.   Food order included chicken pasta, and seafood (paired with seasonal vegetables). Both time the staff was able to serve the sides separately due to a seafood allergen with my woman.   A warm fresh side of bread is provided free. The free garlic bread was properly portioned for group enjoyment. Chicken pasta and fish were flavorful and filling. Seasonal vegetables were tender and good on their own.  Drink refills and staff were good to refill and check on the table.  Towards end of meal, check and bill were closed promptly.   Good: Flavorful food, refreshing drinks, great service. Best cork fee on pier.   Bad: nothing to date.   Overall four stars. I'll be back.",

All along the pier, it's hard to pick out a restaurant that will actually be good for the price you pitch (it's San Francisco, you've got to make every dollar count if you want to make it a few hours). Fog House Fish Harbor was one of our first choices because there wasn't a line in front, and the lobby looked welcoming (albeit overly dressed-up like a hotel, I'm not kidding)  We were seated immediately, but the crowd that occupied the restaurant would be daunting for any staff, and I knew right away that this would take awhile. High over the waterfront on the clear day to see the whole Bay, the view from anywhere in the room was fantastic. But even I got a bit bored waiting for the waiter (I'm hilarious).  We ordered two Sourdough Chowder Bowls and their Salmon Flatbread. The former didn't stand out to me, but it's getting increasingly difficult to tell the difference between the dozens [and DOZENS] of chowder-serving locations. The Flatbread wasn't shabby, but shabby doesn't cut it for $13.00 (it's four triangles...small triangles)  Better places for better prices, but perhaps their crab and lobster put up a better meal's experience.

For three people, we each got the clam chowder bread bowl, a salad, the tuna ahi poke, calamari and two cocktails. Total before tip comes to about $95 dollars. Not worth it for appetizer meals.

What makes up for the price is the view of the bay; but depending on where you were seated it wasn't much of a view.",

I was looking for a delicious restaurant that didn't have a strict dress code. (I'm 8 months pregnant and don't have the widest variety of formalwear) ;)   We decided to try several appetizers, and then split a dinner instead. It turned out to be an excellent decision. The meal starts out with a perfectly prepared sourdough bread, it was so delicious. We had the calamari, I really enjoyed the dipping sauce and found it the batter to be delightfully crispy. My fiancee, didn't agree with the breading, as he prefers the light crispy kind. We also split the steamed mussels, they came in a delicious broth that was savory and delicious. We both agreed, these were absolutely amazing! We followed it with an order of raw oysters, and they were so fresh and delectable. They were a bit small, but the freshness and taste really made up for any shortcomings. We also shared a cup of clam chowder (how could we not?), and via others suggestion used the free sourdough bread in place of the bread bowl. We noticed a bar patron eating some amazing looking sweet potato fries topped with blue cheese, which you NEED to try because they are to die for! Upon further questioning with our waitress, there is a little happy hour bar menu that you should ask for if you happen to get the chance! For our main course, we split the cioppino. It was stocked full of delicious fish, crab, mussels, and shrimp, and featured a savory and thick tomato broth. It was really delicious, my fiancee found it to have too strong of a \"fish\" taste for him, but that's what made it awesome for me. For dessert we had the creme brulee, and it was perfectly caramelized on top, and creamy thick and fabulous... they really know their way around the dessert area!   The entire meal only set us back about $150 which was pretty awesome for location and the amount of food we ordered. Make a reservation and ask for a window seat, the view is beautiful. If we happen to make our way back to the San Francisco area, we will definitely be back!",

We got a window seat that overlooked the bay and the golden gate bridge in the far back. The service was great and on top of that, we checked in to get free garlic bread. The staff are great and again, impeccable service when we were there in February.  Now let's talk about the food. Their sourdough bread to start was perfect. \u00a0Definitely recommend the clam chowder IN a bread bowl, and the Crab was amazing. This place has some of the best seafood I've had at a reasonable price for the area. Oh and I forgot to mention their drink menu, amazing. They have amazing mixed drinks and wine selection.

Considering this place had 4 stars and a bazillion reviews we thought it would be great! Well... It was just OK.  Our waiter took over 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink orders and by this time we knew what we wanted to eat.. then after another 5 minutes came back to confirm our drink orders and they didn't arrive for another 5 minutes.   Now we've been here 20 min with only glasses of water, did I mention we were incredibly hungry??!   The bread and drinks arrived and literally on top of that was the appetisers. Calamari was nice. However for a place that prides themselves in Crab Season - their crab cakes were shit. From Maryland and I work at a high end seafood restaurant, these crab cakes were not very nice.  Then we had burgers (I know it's a SEAFOOD restaurant but we wanted lunchy food) and they weren't very good. We didn't finish them.   Since we arrived during the lunch-dinner transition our waiter changed, but we got sort of lost in the transition where no one came by to check on us long after we finished. To the point that I stacked our plates myself to let them know we wanted our check!   Now, I am a server, I have high expectations for such a highly rated restaurant but I was disappointed by the service and quality of the food.",

They also have fresh complimentary house-made sour dough bread! Although, this was not the best clam chowder I've had (best is pikes place clam chowder in Seattle, Washington) it is pretty darn tasty! I wish I had room for dessert, but I was stuffed already!

Clam chowder: pretty good and not too creamy, but didn't have enough clams   Crab &amp; avocado salad: delicious dressing with fresh crab meat. It comes in a HUGE portion so it's basically a main course.  Garlic Chile Crab: the sauce was amazing and it's great for dipping your bread in. But the seasoning didn't sick well to the crab meat.  Our server (Amy) was decent and attentive, but the hostess (I forgot to get her name) was so rude. She asked us to wait for a table so we sat outside near the fireplace to wait for like 15 minutes. She came up to us with an attitude and asked \"so are you ready now?\" I'm thinking what is wrong with that girl because she was the one who asked us to wait there. While walking to our table, she rudely said \"well, I have this one stable for you so you can sit there or like I guess I can move you too if you don't like it. Whatever.\" I guess certain people don't care about their jobs. I will definitely get her name next time.",

This reminded me of a 10x better version of the fish in McDonald's filet-o-fish (I'm a huge fan of that fast food sandwich). It came with a generous amount of fish, french fries, and cole slaw.  -Crab Roll ($19): The sandwich was a bit smaller than I expected, but it was amazing! The bread part reminded me of the outside of a grilled cheese, and the crab part was kinda like a dungeness crab salad. It also came with a side of sweet potato fries + more crab. -Clam Chowder in Sourdough Bread Bowl ($10): Comparable to Boudin's but I might like this one even more. -Garlic Roasted Crab ($19): I didn't try any of my dad's entree, but I'll include a pic of it. He said it was very tasty. -I also loved the free bread that we got before our meal. It was still super hot, fresh, and crispy right from the oven. WIthin 5 minutes, our table already finished the first basket of sourdough and had to ask for more.  Ambience -Right next to the water at Pier 39.

The whole place has wide windows that ket in natural light. -The table cloths have paper on them, I have no shame and asked for crayons.

For my entree, I had the mixed grill - \u00a0which was perfect because I couldn't make up my mind on what kind of seafood I wanted. It was plenty of food, but I didn't finish the meal miserably full.   The ambiance of the restaurant was pretty nice too; I liked our view of the bay.   When I come back to San Francisco, I'd love to eat here again!",

    "review_text": "We had a light lunch here on our last day in San Francisco and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the Red Chili shrimp which was very spicy and very good. The sauce was so flavorful that even though I usually skip the bread, I used it to get even more of the sauce. Hubby had the clam chowder bowl and thought it was solid and second only to the chowder at Scoma's during our visit this time. It was fun to watch the sea lions while we were having lunch and then to walk around on the pier after eating.",

A couple of hours later, we were able to enjoy the fireworks display over the bay.",

    "review_text": "We came on a Monday evening and ordered 1. Clam chowder in a bread bowl - 9 2. Fish and chips - 16 3. Seafood Penne - 18 a couple drinks for 43 with a 20% coupon from the coupon book from the Welcome Center  - You're on the 2nd floor so you get to see a wonderful view of the Pier. We came during sunset, so we got to see a gorgeous view of the sun near the horizon.  - Nice service. Quick with refills and condiments.  - Clam chowder was rich and creamy. generous portions of clam. My favorite part is eating the bread bowl when the bread absorbed most of the clam chowder soup! Nom! They Claim being the best. I can attest that it's good! \u00a0 - Fish and chips pretty average. No better than ordering from a fast food fish and chip joint - Seafood penne had a lackluster taste. Don't recommend.  - Overall, very pleasant meal with a wonderful view of the Pier at a discounted price!",

    "review_text": "Enjoying a few short hours in this fantastic city via a cruise ship...looking for that one fantastic seafood meal, we ended up here thanks to a glance at Yelp via cellphone before the battery expired.   \u00a0 Encouraged by 4-star reviews, and in need of dungeness crab we walked up the stairs to this restaurant and were promptly seated. \u00a0Then we waited. \u00a0For a long time. \u00a0Finally a server appeared and she was very friendly and informative. \u00a0Unfortunately I didn't take her advice. \u00a0Wanting easy dungeness goodness, I ordered the dungeness crabcakes. We ordered chowder to share, and husband went with fried shrimp platter.   \u00a0DON'T do what we did. \u00a0We soooooooo ordered wrong. \u00a0After a couple trips to the restroom which enabled me to see all the awesome food here, all I can say is DON'T order what we did. \u00a0 Order ANYthing ELSE. \u00a0   \u00a0Chowder was okay, decent and husband's fried shrimp was okay. My crabcakes were two giant FRIED cakes of lots of filler. Sooooo NOT what I wanted. \u00a0But again I blame myself. \u00a0The server had steered me in a different direction and I (stupidly) didn't listen.    \u00a0Sadly, we left feeling like we had totally ordered wrong, had not had that terrific San Fran seafood experience, and must come back and redeem ourselves next time.   \u00a0Do try this place...most importantly DO listen to the server for recommendations, and follow their advice. \u00a0Otherwise, you might have a pricey ($62 before \u00a0tip) lunchtime mistake like we did.",
