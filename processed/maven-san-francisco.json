So anyways, I recently made my way back into the Lower Haight and into Maven for the first time. \u00a0  It was weird at first. \u00a0  Kind of like going back to visit your childhood home now that someone else lives there.  Layout is the same, but shit is definitely different. \u00a0  Bottom line...Maven is a great replacement for RNM.  I think these guys at Maven are on to something. \u00a0  Given the fact that anyone under the age of 35 has a phone in their face at all times with a crippling case of ADD, i think the way we go out is changing.  Gone are the days of a long dinner and movie. \u00a0  Here are the days of number of quick visits that include food, drinks, and hopefully, if you're lucky, some sort of medicinal therapy at some point of the evening. \u00a0  Maven is cool as you're sharing communal tables and the menu layout is somewhat inspired by tapas style sizing and drink pairings. \u00a0  I am a huge fan of variety and if you start your evening at Maven, you'll be setting yourself up well for the remainder of the night. \u00a0  Huge fan of the \"bites\" on the back page as well so don't overlook those.

The Kennebec Fries were a good way to start off the meal. The Summer Squash was light and came with fresh salmon crudo.

I can't recall ever having a drink as good as Beretta until my lips tasted those at Maven. (But that makes sense bc one of the owner's here is one of its decedents!) So, hip hip hooray for another option for delicious, super well-crafted, strong cocktails. They use top shelf stuff here, and the flavors just mend together beautifully. None too sweet, but dangerously delicious!  My fav's thus far: Nauti Mermaid and Santa's Cookies :).   Favorite nosh's: The Maven Burger, Fries, Calamari 2-ways, and the grilled Fennel with Burrata. I'm gonna have to put it out there now and say that the Maven Burger DEFINITELY tops the infamous Marlowe Burger. It's super juicy and perfectly seasoned.   The decor is modern and slick, and the ambiance is hip and trendy. Totally unexpected for the area, but well appreciated! (It's kitty corner from Toronado's/Rosemunde Sausages). Oh, and the service is super nice and attentive.   All in all, I'd definitely be back for the excellent cocktails and that burger!

    "review_text": "I had dinner at Maven with my lady and 2 friends. We went around 6:45pm on a rainy Sunday. We waited for about 10 minutes for room at a common table. We took the time to study the menu. Cocktails looked amazing. Food looked good. Decent beers on draft. Prices were a bit high but it's a classy place, and we watched the bartender light rosemary on fire to get its essence into a drink, so it's obvious they work hard for the money. Being a design snob, I remarked that the organization of the menu was a little bit weird: Three columns, one each for Cocktails, Plates and Pulls, where pulls means draft beer. I found it hard to follow.   Once we sat down, the server informed us that the menu was intentionally organized around its cocktails. Where some restaurants will suggest pairing for their food, Maven goes the opposite route, and recommends food and follow up drinks to go along with their artisnal cocktails.   And, oh, the cocktails were amazing. I personally had the Corpse Reviver #598 and the Maven BullDog. Others at the table had the Hires' Hand, Fireside Cocktail, the 5 Spot, and the Hometown Vixen. And oh my, were they all delicious. My group is a familiar bunch so we all shared some appetizers: brussel sprouts, house pickled vegetables, and even the oysters. All delicious. I actually like my oysters a little more brine-y than they were, but hey, at least you know they clean them judiciously. Not a piece of shell or sand accompanied my slurps. So good. And nice and big!   I think it was at the transition from apps to dinner where Maven stumbled in my eyes. My personal dinner was quite good, and filling (I had the mussels). Unfortunately, the rest of my group wasn't 100% by the amount of food vs. price they were paying. I know, I know, classy joints serve you proper serving sizes, but... it still felt a bit off.   Maven made up for it with dessert (we all split 2 orders of the Fudgcicle pie). Very delicious, particularly when paired when the Maven Bulldog (which was really just an alcoholic dessert).   All in all a good night out. However, I would recommend that you don't do a full dinner at Maven--instead, go there for appetizers or for dessert. It's really not a dinner place at heart.",

As for food itself, it's like booshy comfort food with high quality ingredients. I would definitely get the Penn Cove Mussels again. They came with Korean chili pepper, absinthe, and grilled bread. Comes with tons of steamy, delectable mussels which are wonderfully prepared and not bad for the price. For the entree, my friend and I shared the Maven Burger which came with angostura, house pickles, and muenster cheese. You have to order fries on the side but they're totally worth it. The burger was juicy with great flavor.   In addition to all of that, we downed some killer cocktails.

First time ever I've had to send back calamari -- one of my perennial favorites.   What's worse, when we told them about it, they just thanked us for our input, whisked off the bad food and then billed us for it anyway. We usually give new restaurants in the neighborhood a second try if they miss the first time. I don't think we can trust this one again.

The lucky convergence of a special deal from Bloomspot, a nice review from Michael Bauer, and a desire to take a friend who is moving away out to dinner made a visit a reality. The Bloomspot deal was for a four course chef's tasting-menu with cocktail pairings. The exact menu turned out to be: Summer Squash Tortellini \u00a0(fresh pasta with tomato confit, our ricotta, and summer beans) paired with the Improved Whisper Cocktail (10yr cognac, lillet, orgeat, lemon, chili, and smoke) Chinatown Duck Sliders (pulled duck meat with shiitake mushroom, chinese greens, and bacon) paired with a 5 Spot (aged rhum, ginger, lime, maple, thai basil, and five spice)  Local Albacore (served with an eggplant puree, smoked creme fra\u00edche, and togarashi) paired with an Ume Goodness (Hibiki 12yr, sherry, cocchi, plum shrub)  Mayan Chocolate No2 (a dark chocolate cake with orgeat ice cream, hazelnut, vanilla, bitter orange) paired with the Beach and Hyde (bourbon, coffee, vanilla, egg white, and orange)  The standouts for me were the sliders and the tuna. The sliders were juicy and perfectly seasoned. The Asian flavors were reflected in the subtle yet compelling 5 spot. Something about the combination of lime and Thai basil always makes me smile. Add in the maple, rhum and five spice and you have a winning cocktail. The tuna was a sweetly complex dish with multiple layers of flavor, color, and texture. It was a perfectly-sized portion, served rare, just the way I like it. The togarashi brought out all the sweet/sour notes from the plum shrub in the Ume Goodness, which was my favorite cocktail. \u00a0I like the concept, and would be interested in going again and trying some of the same things with the suggested wine pairings.  Maven is bright and cheerful, with lots of greenery above the bar, light walls, dark wood seating, and fun overhead lighting.There are several seating options, which include large communal tables, the bar, and facing the kitchen. My friend and I took the opportunity to sit at the bar that faces the kitchen. Not only did we get to see everything as it was being prepared, we got to ask questions. I don't know if that would work when Maven is really busy, but it was definitely a nice option for an early evening meal. Both the chef and our server were cute (and efficient), neither of which ever hurts.  While we were sitting in front of the grill, we saw at least a dozen burgers go out, if not more. They looked like little works of art and I'm super curious. I think on my next visit that's what I'll go for. It also seemed to be the most substantial thing on the menu.",

    "review_text": "I'm glad I came to Maven with a food maven, because the dishes here deserve the highest appreciation and praise. Harmonious flavor combinations using fresh ingredients, beautifully presented in perfect portions, PLUS pairings with select cocktails and beers/wines. This restaurant will inspire the budding food maven in you.  We shared 3 plates, which range from small appetizers to full entrees to desserts, and 2 cocktails.  $12 MONTEREY SARDINES with beets, frisee, shaved celery, thyme vinaigrette (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maven-san-francisco?select=LXql3jE-JVB2HeItZVOSWQ#SIApUjOS_i0o5pr85EBhHw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mave\u2026</a>). The sardines were fresh and flavorful, but I should mention that the only sardines I recall eating in the past have been from cans. So this was inevitably a step up heh. Loved the red and white stewed beets in this dish, but I would pass on this dish for something else on the menu.  (GET THE) $10 CHINATOWN DUCK SLIDERS composed of seasoned duck meat, boy choy, hoisin sauce, and a whole shiitake mushroom on a petite sesame brioche bun (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maven-san-francisco?select=LXql3jE-JVB2HeItZVOSWQ#LXql3jE-JVB2HeItZVOSWQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mave\u2026</a>). I'm always taken aback by how small sliders are aha. I enjoyed the Asian twist on the typical slider, especially given how moist and juicy the pulled duck was. The bok choy didn't really shine through (though one wouldn't expect it too), and you could definitely taste the shiitake mushroom in certain bites. The pulled duck meat is lean and fairly devoid of fat, which may underwhelm those who prefer duck truer to the crispier and fattier Asian style. And the brioche bun is ridic soft, like baby-butt-putty soft. I should have asked where they get their buns from, dangit (update: Pinkie's Bakery in SoMa!). That would also be a poor pick-up line haha :P  (GET THE) $23 MCFARLAND SPRINGS RAINBOW TROUT with saffron, twice-cooked potatoes, melted leeks, spanish chorizo (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maven-san-francisco?select=LXql3jE-JVB2HeItZVOSWQ#YD-VTZ_DioJ2rBVm5UrLYg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mave\u2026</a>). There are so many different ingredients, all which contribute to how amazing this dish is. As the food maven was explaining to me, Spanish Chorizo (cured and dried) is very different from Mexican chorizo (raw before being cooked), and the curing makes the chorizo resemble salami in appearance but not taste. The twice-cooked potatoes are first boiled and then fried, and they are bomb. I enjoyed dipping them in the dollops of super-subtly-sweet saffron gel on the plate. Even better are the melted leeks--the butter that they stew the leeks in has crack in it. I'm positive. Last but not least, the crazily moist trout with its addictive crispy skin exceeds expectations. I still mistake it for salmon, dangit.   $11 5 SPOT made with aged rhum, ginger, citrus, maple, thai basil, five spice, was good but sharp on the tongue. The spices cannot be ignored.  (GET THE) $12 CAN CAN made with 10yr cognac, cardamom, blood orange, citrus went down so smooth. Perfect for sipping with your meal.  As for layout, Maven is fairly spacious with bar seating, communal tables on the first floor, and more intimate table seating on the mezzanine. We got there around 7:20 PM and were seated immediately, but the place was definitely close to capacity. Past 7:45 PM, there was a consistent line milling around the entrance. The service here is exceptional--the waitstaff are prompt, earnest, and efficient.  But srsly. Whether or not you're actually a \"foodie,\" as long you can appreciate well-executed slow food (and if you can eat food slowly, because you absolutely CANNOT devour/scarf/inhale the dishes here, it would be a crime, and an expensive one at that), you need to pay a visit to Maven.",

All else were dispensable: burrata (Delarosa does a stellar version), fries with olive aioli (if fries are a must...otherwise, skip), and charcuterie. \u00a0I ordered the 5 Spot: aged rum, ginger, lime, maple, Thai basil, and a house-made five spice blend. Drinks at our table were well made, though no standouts after we swap-sampled.   Beautiful space reminiscent of Nopa. 'Hood looks a bit sketch. Parking was easy in the sense that I saw four cars leave within a five-minute timeframe. Parking was hard in the sense that I couldn't get to them before everyone else.

The food on the other hand....   As I said before, we were all very hungry. A few of us ordered the pork belly ($25.00!!) I was one of them. The presentation was nice but the portion was incredibly small. It came with three pieces of meat that were cut the same size and presented the same way as a steak tartare appetizer. We were all starving by the end of our meal and my friend who got one of the plates with I believe crab or fish, and seaweed hated the food and only had a few bites. Needless to say, in a rush at that point to get the night started, we ended up going over to church and market to Sparkys (desperate!) for a quick grilled cheese and french fries.  Overall, the food did not live up to my expectations, the price was outrageous for having to leave hungry. The bar was nice.",

My friends tends toward the savory fair, while I like a citrus and bright. The bartenders were able to match our different drink tastes to the shared food courses. The menu was small, but complete. I can't be sure it was just the bar menu, or the same for the restaurant. I had the small plates salad and duck sliders. The meat was perfect - easy on the sauce which I prefer with the balance of crunch from the greens. The salad was simple and tasty. My friend had the burger, which he enjoyed.",

The servers were knowledgeable, the food was comfort oriented tapas and great for sharing, (I recommend the stuffed olives, and calamari), the artisianal drink selection had many high octane cocktails to explore,(I recommend their version of the Manhattan which had a nice bitter in place of a sweet aftertaste), and the ambiance was sleek with a cool hanging garden above the bar. All of these positives being said, this joint does not live up to the hype.

Catch up to the rest of the world, people!  The interior is really freaking cool. It's got a distinctly modern vibe, but a living garden that's perched behind the bar ensures that Maven still exudes a sense of warmth. Two levels. Communal seating throughout. A Fireplace upstairs. Love, love, love the interior. A living garden at a bar...who'd a thunk it?  We came for drinks but had a few nibbles on the side. I stayed away from the cocktails list and opted for an Old Fashioned instead. The rest of my party imbibed with both wine and cocktails. They all liked their drinks. I was exceedingly pleased to see them use a single oversize ice cube in my drink, BUT what is up with using tap water for your ice cubes? Don't you know that it gives the ice a clouded look? If you're going to go with the single cube, you've got to use filtered or bottled water so that it's clear; come on, you can do better than that!  Also, this is now the second bar this weekend that couldn't make me a Cosmo because they didn't have cranberry juice. Seriously, how is it even possible to have a bar that can't make a Cosmo. It's not like it's the most exotic of drinks that I'm asking for.  I'm a little perplexed by some of the other comments which seem to focus on the price of the drinks. Forget the fact that there are menus posted outside the restaurant for a moment. Do you people not get out much? $10 - $15 is pretty standard cocktail pricing nowadays. Live a little.   Given that there's not a whole lot else going on in this neighborhood and that you can only spend so much time in one place, I'm not sure I would go out of my way to come here. But it would make for a great date spot before jumping off to an evening's main event.  You can trust me on this one; I'm an Elite. ;)",

There were four of us (originally 5) that walked in without a reservation around 9:00 on Friday night. The place was pretty full, but a party was luckily leaving right when we got there. It's a fairly small space, and if you're not into the communal table thing, I got bad news for you son. I personally like the communal tables; it's cozy, inexplicably hip, and you have a chance to make new friends with your neighbors.   The interior is very hipster. Long wood tables, and foliage growing out of the wall above the bar. We each ordered a specialty cocktail from their menu, and they were all very good. Mine was a bit sweet for my liking, but I'm just really sensitive to sugar. We ordered some fries, brussel sprouts, and duck sliders. The fries were very good, and the brussel sprouts were AMAZING. You absolutely need to get these.   The duck sliders were a bit of a let down. While the meat is cooked perfectly and is very juicy, my friend and I agreed it needed more flavor. Prices aren't astronomical, although they're not cheap either. Service was on point. Definitely a good spot to take a date or have a low-key night with friends!",

The bad: - Pretty slow service from the start - right when we sat down we said fries and calamari - never got the calamari and when we asked - they said must have been miscommuncation. \u00a0As a new restaurant I would encourage folks to assume service mistake vs putting it on us. \u00a0Wait was fairly long between order and then our drink order and then food order. \u00a0However, when we put a credit card down on the bill and were waiting for our friend in the rest room to include his card, we had no less than 4 people in 30 seconds ask if they could take the check. \u00a0Put the check clear on the waiter alone so we don't have to say 4 times we are not ready to pay. - Fairly limited food menu - tried a lot as we shared plates and nothing knocked the socks off. \u00a0Had Sliders, crudo, winter tart, Braised fennel and watercress and it was all just ok. \u00a0Portions are very small so wouldn't advise sharing at this place with more than one other person.

My girlfriend and I arrived at 12:45 and were told to expect a 45 minute wait by the (hard-to-track-down) host. We wandered down Haight St for about 25 minutes to kill time, since there were a few groups in front of us, and when we came back, were one of the last parties waiting outside. Despite the upstairs counter being fully seated when we checked in, they weren't seating anyone else upstairs, and empty 2-4 tops at the shared downstairs seating weren't being cleared away in any kind hurry. We checked with the host a couple more times and weren't told anything encouraging or given an explanation for the stretched wait. The group of three in front of us got to loiter inside around 1:50, though it didn't sound like they were being seated proper yet, and said they had waited for 1:20 despite being told under 45 minutes. We were finally seated at the bar around 2 PM.  Once we got a seat, things turned around. The maple/ginger/sage breakfast links were fantastic, and the bartender mixed a great Bloody Mary riff with tomato water, tequila, and mezcal. The smashed potatoes were tasty and not dried out, and the bacon-cheddar scone was a great starter.  I'll come back, but I'll be second-guessing the host's wait times. Maven's dinner and bar have been great, so I'm surprised that they had such a tough time with brunch. It's wild speculation whether they were short on kitchen or waitstaff, but I hope they get it worked out.",

    "review_text": "\"Are those plants coming out of the wall real?\"  \"Uh. Maybe?\"  \"Okay. Well, this butternut squash pasta thing is uh-mazing.\"  \"Yup.\"  My friend and I went here last night to check it out after I had gotten ten inches of my hair chopped off at Firehorse across the street. We sat down and settled on the Butternut Squash Agnolotti, the Savory Winter Tart, and what they simply label on their menu as \"Cheese\" (Point Reyes Blue with Spiced Honey).  Neither of us are drinking at the moment (damn those NYE resolutions) and I think that an earthy pinot could have really brought out the flavors in both the Winter Tart and Butternut Squash dishes, but c'est la vie.  We definitely agreed that the Butternut Squash dish was our favorite; you have an option to order a small or large plate for this dish...get the large, we definitely wanted more.  The tart was more of a, uh...deconstructed tart? so the filling was decoratively plated and the tart crust was broken up into pieces on top. It was good, but trying to fork together the crust with the filling was a bit challenging, especially when trying to share this dish.  I'm not really going to review the cheese cause, well, they didn't exactly make it now did they? The spiced honey was a nice touch, I'll give them that.  On ambiance, it was pleasant with a couple small hiccups. On the ground level where we sat (I didn't see the upstairs seating), there are no hooks for bags or coats anywhere. Our stuff was on the floor which wasn't ideal. I believe I overheard the host offer to take someone's coat, but for bags, I'd probably want to keep that close by as I'm usually toting my Macbook. Secondly, the tables are shared and long and narrow and the servers have to pass behind you to get to people on the other end; a little awkward, but not awful.  So, if you're in Lower Haight and want something a little nicer than bar food or BBQ, Maven is a good option.",

The portions are tiny. I'm no Joey Chestnut, but the ratio of food to $ is ridiculous. Seriously, if you break it down, you end up paying about $3/oyster, $3/half-dollar-sized ravioli, $3/slider. Granted, the duck sliders were delicious (the most delicious thing on the menu, imho), but I'd take In-n-Out over that slider any day, especially since you have to have like 5 to feel decently full. Or even better, you could go to Chinatown for the real deal and get half a Peking duck. Oh, and the pasta that we got was also way past al dente and somewhat mushy.   What you're paying for at Maven is the atmosphere. Some people like doing that - to each his/her own - but I prefer to pay for good food.",

The broccoli agnolotti I didn't care for - it lacked flavor and I wasn't a fan of the texture.  All in all, the atmosphere is great and concept of the menu is too.

I (literally) tortured myself for 21 days during January where I abstained from gluten, sugar (mostly processed, but even some natural), and alcohol. \u00a0It was rough, I'm not going to lie. \u00a0So how else to reward some hard fought battles? Cocktails.  Greg and I wandered over to the Lower Haight on a relatively quiet but chilly Monday to seek out some food, with my eyes set on Maven's Chinatown Duck Sliders and brussels sprouts. \u00a0The ambiance/decor here is just so cool, it's got that urban/modern loft look with some awesome living garden work on the walls.  We sat up in the mezzanine area and ordered the following: Beverages: 5 Spot Cocktail, Cabernet Blend / Maudite Food: Chinatown Duck Sliders, Gnocchi, Brussels Sprouts, Pork Loin with Mustard Seeds, and the Chocolate Fudgesicle Sundae.  The highlights was the 5 Spot Cocktail, the Brussels Sprouts, and the Fudgesicle. I was \"meh\" on the Duck Sliders. \u00a0I wasn't overly impressed with the whole situation. \u00a0I know it's on 7x7's Big Eat list, blah blah blah, but I didn't finish my slider thinking that I had a life changing moment.  At the end of the day, Maven is a cocktail that pairs its specialties with food, not the other way around. \u00a0Drinks here are fantastic, but for what you pay for the food, it makes it a little bit of a lackluster experience.",

My friend had the Arctic Char which had the perfect texture flavor, and the skin was cooked to a perfect crispness. \u00a0Highly recommend that. \u00a0While I had the Monterey Calamari, \u00a0which was a combination of perfectly lightly battered pieces, and the tentacles were not breaded, but had that perfect chewiness and added a great color to the dish. \u00a0The thai chili, and the sauce are a great compliment to this dish as well. \u00a0I also recommend this. The waiter also did a wonderful job of recommending a drink to go with my dish. \u00a0I got the Border Crosser which is Mezcal, Bourbon, Amaro, and Vermouth. \u00a0Such great flavors and nowhere near as overpowering as I expected which is a good thing. \u00a0My only gripe was that it was a little pricey for the size.

Your neighborhood options now span beyond some dives and a wine bar. Hallelujah.

Food: +Duck Sliders - Like Whoa. Get this. Two petite buns chock full of awesome. Spice, tang, intense juicy shredded duck is going to warrant the last bit of the bun to wipe up the extra sauce. +Scallop Crudo - Well prepared, but sadly over-powered as they were served after the Sliders. +Arctic Char - Cooked to perfection. Reiterate: Perfection. Crisp skin, moist, flaky flesh. Balanced with well seasoned, balanced broth/fume and vegetables.  Cocktails: Damaging. In the best of ways, wallet aside. Having shared / sipped through nine different libations to date  - they are: complex, balanced and unique  Service: We grilled this guy about every detail from how the pistachio was achieved in the Hometown Vixen (roasted in-house, soaked in bourbon and pressed) to the difference between gomme and syrup.

I didn't really like the duck sliders even though everyone's raving about them. It kinda tasted like a chinese bao and chinese baos are like 1 dollar...

I beg bar designers reading this to please put a foot bar at the bottom of your bars. Stools without foot rest bars for anyone over six feet makes you very uncomfortable.   We both did not opt for cocktails because we were a little crispy from the night before but had loose leaf tea.   My wife ordered the Confit Benedict with Tomato Hollandaise($13). They call it a B.L.T. Benedict. It was delicious. The flavors all melded together and the dish was awesome. I had the Maven Burger($12). Another great choice. Great components, cooked more mid-rare than requested medium but the flavors of the cheese and onions were delicious. Unfortunately they did not come with fries but house-made potato chips that were dusted in coriander powder which sufficed.   The service was friendly and nice. The bartender made some very pretty cocktails for customers in front of us and when we go back, we would love to try some of Maven's creations. The meal was affordable and we would love to try their dinner menu sometime. Bravo.",

My friend had the absinthe sorbet drink and I had some other drink. My drink wasn't memorable but her's was amazing. It was a fun experience with the sorbet absinthe, AND it tasted good.   The souffle pancake was light and fluffy and not really a pancake but more of a wonderful piece of delicious cloudlike pancake with apple butter and cinnamon sugar on the side. Geez.   Suckling pig eggs benedict... i couldn't really taste the suckling pig/see much of it but they did something with the greens on my benedict. I don't know how much delicious bacon grease or crack they might have put in it but man, the greens tasted better than the meat/egg. Something you won't ever find me claiming.   Anyways.

    "review_text": "Maven is a bit of an enigma. Surprisingly, it's oddly reminiscent of RNM, the failed restaurant that preceded it in the same space.  The problem isn't the concept. \u00a0We're love our dranks, and so we're totally down with a restaurant that pushes drinks front and center. That's why we love Beretta, one of the places these dudes used to run. \u00a0Go have a bunch of great drinks and eat some good food in between. \u00a0We've been going there for years, early in the evening with the kids, later wild times when it's just us, Sunday brunch.  The drinks at Maven are just as good, and served with as much care. The food is even better, of a whole category (or two) above Beretta. \u00a0We had grilled fennel with burrata that got sicker with every bite and a butternut squash ravioli that was rich and deep. \u00a0The entree was an exquisite piece of grilled char, cooked 1 millimeter above the legal limit and served with a light broth that hit like champagne or something. Wicked.  But therein lies the problem, \u00a0The food is too good for the concept. Or, at least, the two don't match. \u00a0I'll give it to them: the Mezcal drink they paired with that grilled fennel rang a very real bell in my mouth. \u00a0They were great together. \u00a0But then if I'm getting pounded, I don't give a shit. \u00a0I don't want a deep eating experience when the menu is 80% booze. \u00a0I want awesome drinks served right with foods that come up between and wake me up. \u00a0I was loving that delicate, pitch-perfect char they served me, but then I had a beer and some wacky bourbon drink on the table I was just wishing for some bruchetta or remoulade or something.   I'm rooting for Maven. I live down the block and would love to have a quality spot in \u00a0the hood. \u00a0And I love Beretta, so I have faith. \u00a0But are they Delfina's or a bar? \u00a0If it's the former, flesh out the food menu and slow it down on the \"pairings\" theme. If it's the latter, get more fun with the food, give me shit that will stand up to the booze. (Maybe it's seasonal, I know it's tough to come hard with roots and shit, but you hear me. ) And maybe I ordered wrong, but if the concept is booze + food, you gotta expect people to make bad choices.  Another plus is the interior. \u00a0The changes are subtle, but the vibe in there is now cool as shit. \u00a0Really great job on turning that space into some place cool, the plant wall, the pro kitchen. And the attic is the bomb. \u00a0I saw Bryan Ferry in line for that attic. \u00a0  I give the food four stars and the drinks four starts, but not four stars together. \u00a0Also, two things: (i) you charged me $18 for six kumomotos, more than Foreign Cinema, and five out of six had shell bits in them? and (ii) we were the only people upstairs, early, and the two owners (thanks Haighteration blog) came up to sit at the bar and talk business. \u00a030 minutes they were there, we were here, and neither of them ever came over and said what's up.  What's up.",

Oh and SUPERB cocktails, did I already say that?   Maven has all these.   I'm fairly confident that I won't be downgrading this review even though I've only been here once, because one look at the menu and you know they've got their priorities straight: BOOZE.   Let's start by creating a kick ass drink and then think about what food to pair it with AFTER the fact.  An online coupon afforded us a tasting menu paired with cocktails. My favorite of the bunch being the \"Fireside cocktail\" which had rye whiskey and is suitably perfect for the season with its apple and cinnamon flavors. The chestnut ravioli filled with golden apples in a sherry sauce was so perfect with it, what an outstanding pairing!  The Chinatown duck sliders pair well with the 5 spot cocktail made with aged rum, ginger, Thai basil and five spice. Clearly, Asian influences all throughout! The herbed fries were crispy and sprinkled with juniper salt. The Chocolate Napoleon dessert is sooo good with the Maven Punch.   The only thing I'd like to note was the seared local Albacore was a bit salty.   At the end of our meal, I was smiling from ear to ear. (I mean, you would too, I basically had 4 amazing cocktail tastings! And at a little bit over 2 oz each, I was buzzed!) \u00a0The feel good endorphins were excitedly running in my veins so much that on my way out, I was gushing to the manager how beautifully paired everything was.   Great service and eats in a restaurant that has a surprisingly trendy ambiance for this part of town. If you LOVE the whole cocktail culture SF is experiencing right now, you can't pass up on Maven.   5 buzzworthy stars!",

I've been waiting for Maven to open for awhile now since RNM has left the place dark and empty. Loving the living wall of lush, green plants and beautiful redwood tables.  Service was on point. Food and drinks came out on time, and the servers knew what they were talking about. They've got a host/waiting list now, so getting seated was a non-issue. Staff was great - Jordan was great to talk to and very attentive.  My favorite drinks: Global Warming- gin, sake, lemon, and absinthe sorbet melting in it. So good! New Boy Valentine is a nice, smooth darker rum cocktail if you're looking for one. \"Nauti' Mermaid\" is my favorite name for a drink ;)  Favorite food? the Savory Winter Tart- I've never seen a mushroom tart like this before, but it's amazing! Perfectly cooked mushrooms served on top of delicious housemade ricotta. Chinatown duck sliders are a must also- shitake mushrooms, greens, bacon, and duck in Hoisin sauce. I'm Chinese, and yes, I still thought this dish was legit.  Overall, a great place to bring your friends for quality food and drinks any night of the week. I can't wait for them to begin serving brunch!

The food is really sophisticated and perfect for those who want to pop in, have a nice cocktail, and share some snacks with friends.  We had the butternut agnolotti (tossed with a divine brussel sprout slaw), the calamari (spicy, a mix of breaded and unbreaded), and braised fennel and watercress with buratta and roasted tomatoes. Yum! The chef really took the food here to another level, which I appreciate. It's creative, delicious, and there are many relatively healthy options which is rare at most bars.  Cocktails, beer, and wine were on point. The draft beers were served ice cold, which is something I'm very particular about and also appreciated.   It's nice to see such a sophisticated space in a residential neighborhood for once in San Francisco. Normally you have to go downtown to hang out somewhere this chic - so am LOVING the fact that this bastion of sophistication is raising the bar in the Lower Haight!",

The drinks are very good. \u00a0The food is hit or miss. \u00a0I had some wonderful calamari and kampachi crudo dishes. \u00a0I also had a salad and pasta dish that were very forgettable, if not down right bad. \u00a0  I would certainly go back again for drinks and food, but I will order more carefully.",

    "review_text": "Girl dates.  It's absolutely essential. It gives you a chance to gloat about the Prince Charming you have in your life (or bitch about the one you don't have), vent about the blind date from hell that picked you up on his tricycle or embarrassingly reveal the random bar hookup with the Mr. Ron Jeremy's doppelganger that you later find out works in your IT department. Eeeck. No wonder Patti Stanger always preaches the \"2 drink max\" rule.  My childhood BFF and I were due for a girl date. We both had Maven bookmarked which made our a place for date night an easy choice.  Immediately upon walking in, we both realized that Maven was in the old RNM space. The once sultry dark hot date restaurant is now a stunning industrially sleek venue that's good for catching up over killer artisan cocktails, casual dates, and small group dinners. Sit downstairs at the communal tables where all the action is at or upstairs for a more intimate dinner while overseeing the action below. Come early because they do not accept reservations.   The first of its kind (that's I've seen), Maven has a menu that's pairs a cocktail with an adjacent food item and a beer or wine pairing. There's just 10 items on the menu (5 apps, 3 entrees &amp; 2 desserts) and 6 bar bites so choose wisely because the bill can easily rack up if you do all the pairings.  I'm not big on alcohol pairings and rather order what's sounds most appealing to me so I ordered THE cocktail that all the Yelpers recommended: The Global Warming ($11). It was super refreshing and the absinthe sorbet made me glow after several sips so beware: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F11mwaH4&amp;s=9cc4f3fcda2a623f06462136950163f2c0d52ba704bb7def37c9f6fa2c6d0fa7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/11mwaH4</a>. This cocktail is not for one shot wonders.  The cocktails are the winner at Maven so don't come without ordering one. Go elsewhere for dinner...  The food at Maven was nothing spectacular nor worth going back for especially with the high prices points and small portions.  The House Made Charcuterie Plate ($16) was not appetizing especially with the burnt toast points: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F108XSFL&amp;s=51906613301e8ca6cff280ebb6aabcc9e771736c698de68eab412116e681663c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/108XSFL</a>. I never met a pate or terrine I didn't love until I met this charcuterie plate. I couldn't put my finger on it other than the textures were just off. The Salmon Crudo ($10) was like a rich deviled potato with a silky spiral of lox: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F14NLgIQ&amp;s=f6901b37a3543f02982281738438932681c9b2c52a23b0bf877d02e2e406a198\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/14NLgIQ</a>. Super yummy! The Duck Sliders ($9 for two) were mouthwatering and packed with a delicious savoryness but not very Chinesey as it didn't have any crispy duck skin: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FZ8udsS&amp;s=b262459a7865076016e2a1d56ce0eee57719e62e62b00e544a6a627917dfc18f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/Z8udsS</a>. It was more like a pulled duck confit slider but nonetheless solid. The Suckling Pig ($25) was a huge disappointment on a small platter (more tapas sized than an entree) as it didn't have the quintessential crackling skin which is what makes suckling pig \"suckling\"; rather it was several thin slices of pork loin, one pork rib and one pork croquette: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FZ8umfZ&amp;s=bfe28656b81668ab688445631102ac55fd570aae03d41886b7bd544958d7793e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/Z8umfZ</a>. Don't get me wrong, the pork trio was nicely cooked but the name on the menu was misleading.  We opted out of dessert and decided to end our girl date in true SF fashion...with a shot of Fernet. They arrived in the cutest bootie shot glasses: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FXdK9NN&amp;s=1332c79a67f1255894ec150db3fb057c695311baac8c47a95c715c66b254fd42\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/XdK9NN</a>. If I was a klepto I would have totally took these home with me.   In the beginning, the staff was attentive, friendly and down-to-earth. As it got busy, the attentiveness wore down significantly and food service was very slow. Our shared entree took close to an hour to arrive after our last app was done. It was also very hard to find our waiter as the night progressed so we had to flag down another waiter just to get our water refilled and pay our bill. By the way, this was a Tuesday night.  After said and done, $65 a person for two drinks, one unappetizing charcuterie, two pieces of sashimi, one slider and several bites of pork is pricey. Either that or my Asian CheapAssGene has finally made its appearance. My Chinesey momma would be proud! Now excuse me while I hoard ketchup packets from McD.",

The quality of what is served and the care with which it is served might just be unmatched. We saw one cocktail get tasted four times by two different bartenders (using the straw trick, of course) and adjusted once before serving. The cocktail ingredients are all top shelf or home made (syrups, infusions). The food is spectacular (fresh ingredients prepared with care). The design of the venue is modern and elegant but warm and comfortable. Yes, the drinks and dishes are pricey, but you get every penny's worth and more. 4 courses paired with 4 drinks, shared, makes a very pleasant light dinner for two and will run you about $100.

They also change up their menu often, according to what's fresh and in season. The seating is communal, long pretty wooden tables, lined with stools, so it gives you a chance to rub elbows, maybe make some new friends, and most importantly oogle at other people's food if you are milking your first cocktail and still can't decide what to order.   My #1 burger in all the city. They just do it right! From the homemade chips, to the juicy patty, and fresh homemade bun, it's everything you need in a burger. I was appalled by a review I once read, hating on this burger, this person obviously grew up hitting the $1 menu at McDonalds and never acquired a true palate for quality beef. The freezer burned patties effed up their tastebuds for sure. Anyways, haters gonna hate, and I am gonna continue loving this burger forever. Love you Maven!  The brunch is also delicious, but expect a wait on wknds.",

    "review_text": "I went to Maven last Thursday, the day after it opened to the public so I understand that things may have not been running as smoothly as they will once the restaurant and its staff has time to get it/their bearings.   The trouble started when we first walked in. Though we were seated fairly promptly, we were left for 20 minutes without so much as a menu to look at. Once we got the menu and waited another 10 minutes for our waiter to ask us what we wanted, we learned that our two top choices (duck sliders and the calamari) for food were unavailable. Not a huge deal, but still something that should be mentioned once menus are handed out.   My two guests and I settled on the kenebec fries, the burger and the tart. The tart, for starters, is actually a deconstructed tart, which was a bit off putting. Still, the taste was satisfactory and the ability to pick and choose what to include in each bite was cool. The burger, on the other hand, was entirely too salty. I'm talking INSANELY salty. The fries were, well, fries.   We were still hungry after our two burgers, fries and tart, so we ordered the charcuterie plate, which turned out to be nothing of the sort. When I hear \"charcuterie\" I think of thinly sliced salted cured meats. Instead what we got was chicken liver, rabbit in some sort of puree and a third meat that I'm forgetting. None of the three were described in any sort of detail on the menu so we had no way to know wat we were getting.   The one saving grace of the night was the drinks, which were very good. I had two sazeracs as well as a manhattan, and all three were fantastic. I really hope this place gets its act together and makes some needed changes to the menu as we've been waiting for a good replacement to the underwhelming RNM for some time.  Good luck, Maven.",

    "review_text": "WTF... I've been here before and it was F--KING amazing, so to say I was disappointed by my latest trip would be an understatement. \u00a0 What happened? \u00a0This place seems very different to me, from the menu to the wine list. \u00a0The menu selection seems smaller than it had been and many of the items that I had really didn't work. I started with the salmon crudo, which was passable, but nothing terribly memorable about it other than the overall flavor was that of potato and not of the salmon. \u00a0Second dish was the stone fruit salad, which was accompanied with lettuces, almonds, a selection fruits and smoked paprika in a vinaigrette. \u00a0That all sounds great but for the life of me I couldn't find any smoked paprika anywhere and believe me I looked! Next was the calamari with a Thai Chili sauce with ginger and cardamom. \u00a0This was terrible. \u00a0Sorry for the bluntness but I only choked down a few pieces before I gave up. \u00a0The tentacles were hard fried to the point of being unrecognizable and they tasted of old or stale oil. \u00a0The \"bodies\" needed to be cleaned better and the sauce that they were accompanied with didn't help bring anything together on this dish (and made me burp all night long). \u00a0I was surprised when the server took it that I wasn't asked why I was not finishing it. \u00a0Lastly was the burger with fires. \u00a0I will say the burger was cooked perfectly and tasted fine, a little messy but good, the fires on the other hand were not edible. \u00a0They were cooked horribly and tasted like that. \u00a0More than half of the order was burnt to a crisp while the other half tasted old and stale. \u00a0And the salt... I love salt, I have 6 kinds of salt in my house, but these were covered in salt to the point that I was brushing off the fries in an attempt to eat them. \u00a0  A quick word on the service tonight: \u00a0below par. \u00a0When the server finally came and took the order, she wasn't ready for me to give her my order. \u00a0She was shocked that I was ready; I mean I had only been sitting there for like 15-20 minutes... \u00a0The when the food came, it was generally plopped down in front of me. \u00a0Never was there a change of plates of silverware even though I was having fish first then other courses to follow.  Poor showing, very poor showing. \u00a0I see by the reviews that this must be on out of ordinary experience, and in their defense, the times that I have been here before, have been excellent, so I don't know what happened tonight, but buyer beware. \u00a0Good luck.",

The service is attentive, impeccable and friendly. \u00a0The customer (you) come first. \u00a0I used to secret shop restaurants and I am therefore hard to please, but my waiter last night was perfect. \u00a0My guest ordered calamari but doesn't like seafood (last time I eat with this guest) so he asked to send back the calamari and have it all deep fried. \u00a0Originally, some it if was deep fried and some of it was fresh - I prefer fresh. \u00a0The waiter took our calamari and came back in a few minutes with the deep fried version, no questions asked. \u00a0The waiter brought the food out in a timely fashion and while the food was at it's perfect temperature. \u00a0My burger was just right. \u00a0It was on a rather small plate, but delicious. 2. Staff - the manager was there and brought our glasses of wine over. \u00a0 He asked how we were doing and that added a personal touch \u00a0to the night. \u00a0I must note that the wine selection, while not extensive, was just right. \u00a0There are enough wines by the glass to satisfy everyone with an addition of an unknown for the wine enthusiast. 3. Location - Although I hate to drive in a city that is only 7X7, there were open parking spots everywhere. \u00a0I came from my office in SOMA and it was very close. \u00a0I like that it wasn't in the Mission, but a little closer to the NOPA, Hayes and the Castro. \u00a0It is a great location if you are meeting friends from all over the city. \u00a0I was also surprised that I had never been in the area and at how many shops there were that looked interesting.  4. Food - The menu is simple and it keeps the focus on your experience. \u00a0There is a good variety of things to choose from. \u00a0I love to try new restaurants in SF, but I look for fresh, local ingredients and a flavorful zest - something new. \u00a0Maven added a twist on the burger by adding Munster cheese. \u00a0Burgers are all the rage these days and this one is bound to pique your pallets interest. \u00a0The calamari I describe above was lightly garnished in a zesty sauce, not too heavy. \u00a0I will have to go back and try the skirt steak and the sliders...and the Winter Tart! \u00a0The Mayan Chocolate was superb with a hint of orange zest. \u00a0 5. Drinks - They have yellow chartreuse on the menu, bitters and all the fixings a mixologist would need. \u00a0Timeless, trendy....but oh so divine!",

When I entered Maven at 9pm, there was only 1 couple ahead of us with a quoted 30 minute wait. An hour later, I am hungry and slightly irritated that four couples were seating ahead. Plus, I see open seating interspersed throughout the restaurant while I am standing in a corner, stomach growling. But sitting in front of the kitchen, watching the chef's cook completely made up for the wait.   Ordered the potato gnocchi, Rocky's chicken, Chinatown duck sliders, and Maven burger. Orders came out fast and the portions were decent. Truthfully, I feel like the portion I received was bigger than the ones going out to the tables. Food did not disappoint. I was mainly excited for the burger but the other dishes surprised me - all were very flavorful, not overly salty, and had me wanting more. Watching the chefs really made me appreciate their ability to multi-task. The girlfriend also really enjoyed the food and has asked me multiple times to return.  What I recommend: - Chinatown duck sliders - Maven burger",

The beer and wine selection is superb for the price. Hard liquor is also available (thank goodness they have their full liquor license unlike several bars in the area). The small plates are delicious. The waiters are friendly and knowledgeable. The ambiance is sexy.  The comprehensive menu of small plates suggests a wine or beer to go with each. It's presented in a grid style. What a creative idea!   However, a few improvement suggestions: More seating downstairs. They have four long tables which take up a lot of room and force you to sit right next to the people next to you. A bit awkward. I bet they could fit more people in and give them a sense of personal space with smaller, individual tables.  They need a few more entr\u00e9e / dinner items around $10 - $15. The only thing they offer at this price that is suited for dinner is a burger (which is a fabulously delicious medley of flavors... hard to imagine for a burger). But, to keep people coming back, a few more dinner items are essential. I am sure the two $25-$30 dinner options are delicious, but that is a quite pricey for this neighborhood.  Nevertheless, I love this new place. I will be sure to return many times.",

A fantastic selection of drinks in unique combinations, moderately priced relative to other mixology type places. They did a great promo for a certain list of drinks, they would donate money to Hurricane Sandy which I thought was quite thoughtful. I tried about 3 of the drinks which were potent, uniquely flavored, and used some great rye whiskeys.   Food however, was another thing. Small portion might as well have been called 2 month old child portion. The duck sliders were good, but nothing incredibly outstanding.

    "review_text": "Once again I have been duped by another restaurant offering a four course taster with accompanying four cocktails via bloomspot. \u00a0  After reading the many wonderful reviews here on yelp, I thought for sure Maven was going to fulfill their obligation and treat me and my friend to some wonderful tasty eats and drinks. \u00a0Also in the Yelp reviews people who purchased Maven's promotion through Bloomspot mentioned they were seated up by the chef's bar instead of being able to sit at a table with the other dining guests. \u00a0Upon entering I noticed available seating and no one waiting for the tables, however as expected, we were sat at the chef's bar ~ no big deal.  What was a big deal were the personalities (or lack thereof) of the people serving us. \u00a0First off I asked the host to bring me a menu because I had a feeling we would want to order something else outside of the tasting menu; I never got it.  Secondly, the people serving our drinks (which were really only ONE DRINK SPLIT INTO TWO SMALLER GLASSES - NICE!) didn't bother to engage in any conversation to explain what it was we were being served. \u00a0  In addition to the one drink order being split into two glasses, the PORTIONS of the food was incredibly SMALL, I mean REALLY SMALL. \u00a0This really sucked for me as I saved my appetite that day so I could enjoy what I assumed would be an ample tasting - it was not. \u00a0  When deciding to order from the menu, I asked the host again for a menu - he did apologize and remembered that he forgot and brought one to us immediately. \u00a0I do however feel that the hesitation to bring the menu is - everything served on the tasting menu was also listed on the regular menu with its prices also listed.  Therefore - after reviewing the menu I calculated that the promoted $100 worth of food and cocktails, was really only $65 worth of food/drink (mind you, the promotion was spend $45 and get $100), so essentially we got $20 in yukkie watered down drinks which my friend did not drink. \u00a0We were taxed on the $100 and of course, we, being the good patrons we are, tipped 20% on the $145 bill (in addition to the pre-fix we ordered Kampachi Sashimi and two glasses of the Roederer bubbles). \u00a0  Needless to say, we left hungry, disappointed and completely unsatisfied with our meal/tasting; we decided we will not return based on the incredibly cold service, small portions and not so tasty drinks. \u00a0  HERE ME NOW ~ I am now making this proclamation - \u00a0I will no longer purchase restaurant promotions via Bloomspot/Livingsocial/Groupon as I would rather pay for the full price of a meal and get what I want rather then think I am getting a deal through a promotion only to realize that what I actually purchased is the ole bait and switch. \u00a08^( \u00a0  oh and Businesses be warned - Living Social is currently a defendant in a lawsuit due to these bait and switch tactics (to no fault of their own) - so get with the program and honor what you promote.",

Awesome show in a tiny kitchen. But that was the highlight of the meal for me.   Overpriced and hit or miss with the food. The duck sliders were pretty delicious but the gnocchi and calamari (which looked amazing!) were undercooked and surprisingly bland.  The menu is structured with beverage pairing, a nice touch that demonstrates a lot of thought and can make meal choices more intriguing. The cocktails were creative with gracefully blended flavors, but not strong enough for my liking.  Overall it was painfully hip and not worth the price of a return visit.",

    "review_text": "3.5 STARS  Stopped by with Peter L &amp; Rodney H after hitting the Urban Air Market yesterday. Since it was 4pm and a lot of nearby restaurants weren't open yet, we found Maven by doing a quick Yelp search. Ordered a bunch of small bites and cocktails.  Drinks: We ordered the whole Afternoon cocktails menu. :) -Corpse reviver #598: gin, cocchi, ginger, citrus, coriander ($11) -The original whisper: lillet, orgeat, spring vermouth, lemon, chili, smoke ($9) -5 spot: aged rhum, ginger, lime, maple, thai basil, five spice ($11) -Sparkling paloma: blanco, bubbles, lime, grapefruit ($11)  The Corpse reviver #598 was light in flavor but packed an alcoholic punch! Very refreshing and citrusy. The Sparkling paloma was a great play on a mimosa with grapefruit. I do love my bubbles! Peter got the The original whisper while Rodney had the 5 spot.  For food, we basically order the whole Afternoon bites menu except for the Cheese plate ($16) &amp; Maven's burger ($13).  Shishito peppers: corn puree, maldon salt ($6) This was Peter's pick. I love shishito peppers and these were prepared well. The corn puree was on the sweeter side for me though.  Housemade pickles: fennel, beet, cucumber, cauliflower, carrot ($7) I love a good pickled vegetable! It was kind of a small portion for $7, but had a good variety of veggies.  Kennebec fries: juniper salt, olive aioli ($6) My favorite dish! And I typically don't even eat a lot of carbs. But how can I say no to fries?! They were salty and soft in the center. I wasn't sure I was going like the olive aioli, but it actually tasted good with the fries. I kept picking at this dish.  Chinatown duck sliders: shiitake, bok choy, hoisin ($10) I was thinking about ordering this and then Rodney said he wanted to try it. Perfect, since I love sharing! Unfortunately, I didn't really care for the duck. It was too sweet and tender for me. Texture was nothing like the ducks you see hanging in the windows in Chinatown. Maybe they should call this duck confit sliders?  Grilled cheese sandwich: smoked mozzarella, pickled peppers ($8) Peter's pick. I had a couple bites. I think the smokiness of the cheese overpowered this sandwich. It was a little too smoky for me. Plus, it didn't have enough cheese, so you didn't get that comforting gooey cheesiness!  Overall, Maven was a nice place to check out for a couple cocktails and small bites. Typically I don't like sitting at communal tables since everyone's conversations can start overlapping. But it was fine at Maven since it wasn't too busy. Plus I like the feel of the space downstairs. Overall, I loved the cocktails! The food was a little lackluster for me, but okay as snacks while you throw back a few drinks.",

    "review_text": "I was really looking forward to liking this new neighborhood watering hole with a substantial bar menu (or is it a tapas restaurant with a cocktail list?). \u00a0 Unfortunately, there is nothing special about Maven.  One gold star because we were seated right away on a Friday night, and no one cared that we were just ordering drinks. \u00a0We were also offered better seats since they opened up before we had ordered. \u00a0Another star because when my friend was unhappy with how his food was cooked (I thought it was fine), they took it back and replaced it no questions asked. \u00a0Things go wrong in restaurants. \u00a0The real issue is how the staff deals with it, and they did the right thing in this case.  But that's about it for the good! \u00a0Otherwise the service was... inattentive. \u00a0We both ordered drinks, but only one came out. \u00a0After our food arrived, we had to ask for forks. \u00a0And flagging down a server was not easy. \u00a0Not to mention that our server smelled so strongly of baby powder (I'm not kidding) that it made it difficult to enjoy the taste of anything we were having.  The list is cluttered with some wines and beers listed on the front of the menu and a similar (but slightly different) selection on the back. \u00a0Maybe it's set up as suggested pairings, but it doesn't read that way. \u00a0 And the actual wines you can buy down the street at Whole Foods or Falletti. \u00a0Not impressed.  Add to that one kind of gross-out moment at the chef's counter, and that's enough for me to say I probably won't be back, except maybe for a mid-week cocktail.

    "review_text": "Came here with a friend since he had a coupon for a meal + alcohol pairing. It's been a month or so since I was here so I don't remember some of the pairings that came with the meal, but I'll try to do my best!  The first item was the autumn chestnut ravioli. Everything about that dish was really good. I really like the maitake that came with it, but the who dish combined was really good. The second dish was the local artic char. The char was very tasty and wasn't dry, it was cooked nicely. The brussels sprouts that came with it was tasty, I just wish it wasn't so burnt though. The entire outside part was black... granted it didn't taste burnt, it just didn't look as appealing. The third dish was the Chinatown Duck Sliders. They were pretty tiny... but I guess it's a slider. I also don't get why they called it \"Chinatown\" since it didn't taste Chinese to me at all. Other than that, the flavor and everything was pretty good and well flavored. I forgot the fourth dish but it was dessert and I don't think I cared too much for it since I don't remember it.  Some of the drinks that came with the meal that I remember were the 5 spot and the Maven's Milk Punch. The 5 spot was alright, I didn't care too much for it... not one of my favorite cocktails. Maven's Milk Punch was okay, I just didn't like the milky aftertaste it left. The other 2 drinks I don't remember but I just remembered out of the whole meal, I only liked 1 of the pairings and the other 3 I didn't care for.  Overall the meal was good. The only quirk I have is that after the meal, my friend and I were still hungry but we didn't want to order from here again so we just went elsewhere to eat. You would think a 4 course meal would keep you stuffed but it didn't. Place is clean and service is pretty nice though. Worth giving a try, but come ordering extra since the portions are a bit tiny.",

Duck Sliders: OK, decent, \u00a0Calamari: they mixed grilled calamari with fried calamari and added a boring cream sauce to it. I wasn't a fan because the grilled calamari did not go with the sauce. The vegetable tart: what can I say except for how much skill and innovation does it honestly take to deconstruct a tart and put all the ingredients that should be inside a tart scattered all over my plate with the bread crumble in big chunks everywhere. I thought it was rather dull. The steak: It was well cooked and tasted fine. Nothing spectacular was just a steak. Dessert was the the Mayan chocolate: a few brownies with a little vanilla ice cream and some spiced shavings all over the place and some chili pepper decoratively sprinkled all over the plate. It tasted fine but not all that creative really. One thing that I found \u00a0really confusing was how the menu was set up. You have drinks and food all mish mashed together all over the place. It would be nice if they separated drinks from food so I can efficiently order. That being said, the experience was OK. Nowhere near the bottom but nowhere near the top either. In the end, I'm wowed by good flavor not overly creative esthetically plated food. On a good note, the cocktails they make there are incredible so I would def. swing by the bar for a drink and maybe go some place else for dinner.  One more thing to the wait staff: When \u00a0a customer asks you \"what is amazing on here \u00a0that I have to try?\" or \"What do you think of such and such dish?\" Your response should almost NEVER be: \"Everything is good\" \u00a0Vague answers tell me that you are either not in touch with the food or that there isn't anything that great \u00a0that stands out on the menu. Your job as a waiter is to GUIDE customers to a great experience.   All in all though, the Service was Very Good and attentive and I did feel that I was served well.

The service is great. \u00a0You'll likely run into Dave or Jay, the owner operators, running around and making sure everything from the food, service, and drinks are to your satisfaction. \u00a0They have been very open to hearing feedback from customers in order to provide a 5 star experience. \u00a0  The menu is designed to allow customers to pair food and drinks. \u00a0However, you can order whatever combo you like. \u00a0I've had the Maven Burger, Fries, Calamari, Artic Char, Cheese Plate, Duck Sliders, and their Chocolate desert. \u00a0All were very satisfying, and I would order them again  The drinks were just as delicious, and were paired well with the food recommendation. \u00a0Kate, the bartender, is about as sweet as they get!! \u00a0The drinks and food came out timely, and the servers I had were very friendly.  Upstairs provides a lounge area where you can chill and relax. \u00a0The fireplace adds a really nice touch you don't see very often. \u00a0in fact, I can't recall too many fireplaces in the city.  Definitely a spot where you can go with friends or take a date. \u00a0But be sure to get there early, and understand you may have to get a drink or 2 while waiting to get seated. \u00a0It's been pretty busy every time I've been there. \u00a0Lastly, they do close at mid-night......I wished they closed at 2am :(  Good luck to Maven......they have a bright future ahead.",

So succulent and savory...I am salivating right now just reminiscing that plate.   The fries were okay, nothing out of the ordinary.  Duck sliders were like pulled pork, but it was pulled duck. Savory mushroom in the middle which I feel really pulled the mini burgers together. Ate that like a hungry monster in 3 bites. Slider came with 2 buns but we asked the waiter if we could add another bun for our odd number party and the waitress was kind to do so.   Will be returning next week so that the 3 of us could each get our own plate of Brussel sprouts. Yes folks, they are THAT good.  Romantic ambience with dim lighting. House was packed. Open-ish/peek-a-boo kitchen. Only con I'd say is street parking is horrific and peeps steal your parking spot if you don't butt in so you better pounce on that if you see one!",

The bartender whipped up a concoction with egg whites, maple syrup and lemon and it was just fantastic-- exactly the flavor profile I was looking for. If anyone knows what this drink is called please let me know! :D  The food left little to be desired in my opinion. The menu was very limited and since I was not super hungry, I opted for the duck slides-- which were tasty enough, however there were only two sliders per order.. for $10. I get it, its duck... but still... the fact that it didn't come with chips or fries left the presentation looking very bare and lacking value. Once the sliders came I ordered fries since I didn't think the pieces would be enough. When they arrived they were soggy, unlike the fries my friends ordered. It was no big deal switching them out but the fact that it had to be done was a bit off putting.  Nonetheless, I will probably return to Maven but keep my patronage on a strictly boozy basis.",

    "review_text": "I don't usually post reviews so long after I've visited a place, but a friend visiting SF prompted me to add my experience to the rest of the glowing reviews.  In short, the bread pudding french toast was and still is the BEST I've ever had in my life. I very rarely go for sweet brunch, so never before this experience had I ordered french toast in a restaurant and eaten a full half portion. I would have had the whole thing if my boyfriend had let me. This menu item alone makes Maven worth the visit.  The drinks are also quite delicious. Absinthe champagne (Death in the Afternoon) wasn't very absinthe-y in flavor because the champagne overpowered it, but you're still left with the scent which could be ideal for those who are curious but not that into licorice/anise. The Sparkling Paloma is as tasty as you expect. In addition to the bread pudding french toast, my boyfriend and I split the eggs benedict. In my opinion, this was just okay; not my style. The whites were a bit watery, yolk very soft but not at all runny. Collard greens were a little bitter, but the sauce was good and so were the potatoes. In any case the boyfriend loved it, and sitting by the counter with a view into the kitchen we both enjoyed watching the chefs make it. Also think it's worth noting that we were offered ketchup and hot sauce for the eggs, which I appreciated since places like these can sometimes get snooty about it (though maybe that's just in NYC).  Cool interior, too. It's a corner restaurant with huge windows on both street facing sides so you get lots of natural light even on cloudy day. My only complaint was that the service was a bit slow for the fact that it really wasn't crowded when we went.  Also, a warning: the cocktail glasses are indeed as delicate as they appear.",

The new food menu looks promising, though our foray into the desserts was unimpressive. \u00a0The granita had good flavors, but getting them all together in one cohesive bite was difficult. The sundae wasn't very good, and our table (of girls who love chocolate) didn't want to finish it. However, my fond memories of how excellent their burger is, and how great their burrata and tomato salad was, will keep my review higher than it otherwise might be for the menu.  Maybe it was an off night, given the many excellent experiences I've had here. When this place shines, it *shines*, so I'll be back to give it another shot at the 5 star rating I remember.",

For a first night, things seemed to be running pretty smoothly save for some odd arrangements with the host.   We called ahead to make reservations, and were told they don't take any. That's fine and pretty typical of SF. When we arrived, we were told there was no tables for two available, so we asked to put our names down on the list. Then we were told they don't keep a list, but if we wanted to get drinks at Molotov's, we could come back and see if a table was available.   It seemed like the host wanted us out of the bar/waiting area because the restaurant was at capacity, fair enough, but maintain a check-in list so we don't lose our spot for a table while we go over to Molotov's and have our drinks.  Instead we ordered drinks at Maven's bar and were seated within about 15 minutes. Kind of an odd way to start our experience though.  The drinks here are terrific. We had a Hibiki Highball, a Mr. Wiggles (their rift on a Manhattan, and the best drink we tried) and a glass of riesling.   Our waiter was excellent, attentive and had the menu and its ingredients committed to memory.   My biggest gripe with the restaurant was portion to price. I'm not looking for a mountain of food at a high-end restaurant, but asking $9 for two duck sliders (that's $4.50 a slider, people) seems steep. My girlfriend got the steak plate which was $23 for a moderately sized piece of flank steak and some vegetables.   They're essentially offering small plate portions with full entree prices.  I hope they can address that moving forward because the food and drinks are excellent, and it's nice to have some variety in the neighborhood. Best of luck to them.",

Avoid the duck sliders and go for the mussels instead; they are fresh and tender, served with Korean chili pepper and absinthe broth that you will want to soak up with the thick crispy bread.

In fact we ate until about 12 or 12:30 and there was always space.  $20 total per person including tax &amp; tip for these 3 items - not bad but not the best deal either.   The two of us opted at the bar so we could watch them make food. It was fun looking at the options as they were being made, and the chefs humored us and answered our questions. I also enjoyed the high ceilings and relaxed, low key atmosphere of the place at the brunch hour.  MUST-HAVES: I loved the Duck Hash - it was a perfect savory dish (surprising given my usual penchant for sweet options at brunch).  DISAPPOINTMENTS: Souffled Pancake - way too dry!  * Maven's Souffled Pancake - 2.5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maven-san-francisco?select=-f5JtdvrD3BTYWdNvVeFng#bsMAv7Pdaj49XkhpzfWVnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mave\u2026</a> (calvados applesauce, cinnamon. $13) Yup, like I said above - overly dry. More like a fluffy dry bread that comes in a cast-iron pan. The apple sauce is pretty good, like the homemade texture (with some chunks) and tasty cinnamon. I can imagine liking this if I completely doused each piece in maple syrup but I didn't want to offend to kitchen asking for it. Completely not what a pancake should taste like.   * Duck Hash - 4 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maven-san-francisco?select=-f5JtdvrD3BTYWdNvVeFng#-f5JtdvrD3BTYWdNvVeFng\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mave\u2026</a> (fried duck egg, braised sofrito. $14) Wonderful! First, the runny egg yolk. Yum. Makes everything taste better. Second, the roasted potato &amp; onion hash - crisp, tasty. Third, the duck - very tender, very flavorful. Loved this!  * Billionaire's Bacon - 3.5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maven-san-francisco?select=-f5JtdvrD3BTYWdNvVeFng#206LECtTw77aqi52rJdoWw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mave\u2026</a> (glazed and with pepper. $6) I chuckled when I saw this on the menu because the previous week I'd gone to Sweet Maple and had their Millionaire's Bacon. This is clearly their copy, and it is an inferior one at that. While I like that there's a spicy kick to Maven's Billionaire's Bacon, its texture is also much harder, to the point of being difficult to chew through. The sweet glaze was a little overpowering as well - I didn't get any hint of savory flavor (in the Millionare's Bacon at Sweet Maple that comes through and balances the sweetness really well).",

The duck and shiitake were wonderfully succulent and created a great burger filling.   * Monterey calamari - $9 Generous pieces of calamari and good flavors.   I've liked 3 out of 4 of the cocktails I've had here. The 4th wasn't terrible. That's a pretty high batting average, IMO. (Yes to Let It Bee, Sideways Tilt, Death in the Afternoon. Meh to Chamomile High Club.)   The space is beautifully open and well lit, with a lovely wall garden behind the bar.",

But what really pisses me off is that these guys don't even bother to answer their phone for customers.. EVER..

The seating is long-bar type seating where you share a table with other guests. If you have a larger party this may not be the best place but then again I didn't see a lot of large parties so I'm not sure how they accommodate them.   One thing to note: the portions are really small, we all left feeling hungry after ordering 4 dishes amongst 3 people.   As you probably know they pair each dish with a drink. The menu is somewhat small with more small \"tapas\" plates than larger dishes. Drinks &amp; plates we tried:   Salmon Crudo: Decent, nothing special.  Duck sliders: AWESOME! The waitress was nice enough to give us 3 of them instead of the 2 that comes on the plate so that each of us could have one.  5 spot (drink): Paired with the sliders, really like this! Has a smooth ginger taste. Local Halibut: Good, not great. Just a regular white fish dish w/ a few claims &amp; veggies.  Roasted Suckling Pig: Good, not great. Would have liked for it to be a little more juicy.  Jack of All trades (drink): meh.  Whatever the espresso liquor drink is called: very strong.   All in all we spent $140 on 4 plates &amp; 3 drinks. Not sure id go back again for the price, but it's worth trying at least once.",

Their brunch menu is surprisingly limited in terms of food, and I was immediately drawn to the smoked pork benedict.

There's more interest in getting your drink on here than in the food. Do I call it a bar? It's too nice and far too much tabled seating for it to be so.  AMBIANCE: Private tables in this two-story location are for wimps. They're also on the second floor separate from the main bar. \u00a0Go for the long wooden shared tables with the stools. Nothing says \"hello, my pretty\" than rubbing elbows with a stranger. Unless you're on the ends, of course. The space is large for the Haight, and the design is more chic than the neighborhood suggests. A vertical grass/herb garden hangs above the downstairs bar, and the stairs going up are cement. Organic meets industrial.  DRINKS: Global Warming was great and smooth. The Nauti-Mermaid was one of the most unique drinks I've had in a while-- coconut and hazelnut. The Beach and Hyde is an excellent early evening drink (as it's caffeinated with coffee) and a whisper of orange. The 5 Spot is kind of forgettable with a roundabout ginger and basil aroma. $10-12 a pop.  FOOD: Duck sliders were incredible. Only complaint: the dish only came with two of them. Not great for sharing if there's more than two people or someone with an appetite. The lemon chiffon cake was unique-- soft cake with a seriously tart rhubarb/strawberry compote on the side, with a small scoop of yuzu ice cream at the other end. $9 and $7, respectively.   SERVICE: Our server was quick and knew the menu. You could see how busy he was, so we didn't expect his attention to be focused on my little duo.   RATING EXPLAINED: Well-curated but not mind-blowing drinks, small portions of good food, and lack of privacy. It's still a great place. Look for the black doors.",

Maven reminds me of Trick Dog in that it serves yummy, well balanced cocktails that are a tad sweet and more \"girly.\" \u00a0You still gotta go to one of the B&amp;B bars to get a stiffer drink.",

I like the duck slider although my friend thought it was too salty. The brisket was basically braised pork. The Korean chili in the mussel made the dish interesting. I don't recommend the salmon, small portion and plain.   The cocktails were not bad. They pair the tapas with their cocktails. Our favorite of the night was the dessert. We had coconut panna cotta. Crunchy top, fresh mango middle layer and creamy bottom with a hint of coconut. I like it because it's not that sweet. I suggest making the bottom creamy layer denser to add some texture.   I wouldn't come back for dinner. But I heard they have a good brunch menu, and would be interested to try.",

This place is perfect for a nice out with friends if you want to live it up a little bit. Everything on the menu is worth it.   My only complaint is the service. They made the reservation we had very difficult for us, confirming our reservation, but not saving any spots for us. Also once we got there they said all of us had to be there before they even tried to accommodate us. We all eventually had to move furniture by ourselves to sit together, there were about 8 of us, and even then the service was just meh. They could have been more courteous since it was for a birthday and we were also spending a lot of money there. Luckily for them the food and atmosphere was so great that I'll still give them four stars, but they could have 5 if they improve their service by a lot.",

The beers on the menu were quite typo-tastic (\"21st Addmendment\", \"Unibourne\", \"Hennenpin, Ommengang\") but I came for cocktails. Mr Wiggles was an interesting take on a Manhattan, but it was far too sweet for my tastes.  We ordered the Kennebec fries, which came with far too little of the \"olive aioli\" - there was only the slightest artful smear on the plate - and the Maven burger, which was really quite tasty, but it was extremely salty. Nearly salty enough to send back to the kitchen.  I like the communal sort of feel, the aesthetic is really pleasant, but I think the other reviewers' comments about the price-to-portion ratio are well-founded. I mean, the burger was probably the most bang for the buck, at $11.  Either way, I'll probably be going back - it IS around the corner.",

We weren't holding space and I find it incredibly rude to drop the bill in such a rush after one drink and one appetizer. I wanted to try the chocolate mousse dessert but was rushed out in such a manner that I didn't feel like asking.

Located in the Lower Haight, parking wasn't too bad for a Saturday and we managed to get parking across the street (2$ an hour). We started off with a few cocktails which were nicely crafted. I had the \"Smokin' Maria\" which is a riff on the bloody mary, made with tomato water not juice (so don't be expecting a typical bloody mary). It was nice and refreshing, and a nice take on a classic.   We both ordered the eggs Benedict, and were a little disappointed. When they came out, the temperature was just below luke warm. We figured that they probably plated the greens and then waited for the eggs to be done (I'm assuming you also don't want to place a poached egg on hot items). Also, we both agreed that there needed to be some more ham to help balance out the slight bitterness from the greens. Eaten together (greens/egg/ham), everything was able to come into balance, which is what I'm sure the dish was conceptualized to do. Also, anything that said \"spicy\" next to it, such as the \"spicy potatoes\" or \"spicy \u00a0hollandaise\" was anything but. Too bad, because that spice would have been great!  We also had the mezcal infused chorizo, which was just chorizo-y (we couldn't really taste the mezcal), and the bacon egg biscuit which seemed to lack bacon (but also still quite tasty).  We will probably be back, but with the range of brunch places to try, it may take me a while to get back around.",

There's a soaring wall with lush plant life splashing out, providing a colorful, dramatic backdrop to the bar. The rest of the ground floor has several large communal tables that can accommodate groups both large and small. There's also a sexy, darker, more private loft space which has several places at a counter overlooking the entire restaurant, as well as sofas and lounge chairs.   Maven is definitely a great lounge for dates or drinks with close friends, and it's got some pretty good cocktails. As for the food, I've tried the same tasting menu that others have mentioned here. The only memorable part was the Chinatown duck sliders, the Asian aspect coming from oyster (?) sauce, shiitake mushrooms, and \"Chinese greens.\" From the regular menu, these sliders are probably your best bet for value, size, and quality.   Overall, Maven adds a trendy vibe to the neighborhood and I certainly wouldn't mind coming here again for their drinks, smaller menu items, and intimate vibe helped by courteous, unobtrusive service. While the food would probably merit 3 stars on its own, this place as a whole gets bumped up to 4 stars for the ambience.",

    "review_text": "Maven feels like more of a cocktail bar than a restaurant - though a really good one. The food menu's purpose is to drive alcohol sales; it's good, but isn't large enough stand on is own. Because I prefer eating too much over drinking too much, but certainly am no stranger to either, Maven's menu concerned me a bit until we arrived at the restaurant.  With that said, everything we ordered was worth eating, with some dishes being great. The duck sliders in particular were excellent: moist, even juicy, slightly tangy, and filling for a slider. The butternut squash pasta was aided by thinly sliced Brussels sprouts and other veggies. It didn't look like much but was more satisfying than expected. The Kumamoto oysters were good, like they always are.   I'd suggested Maven to a former girlfriend who'd known the space as RNM. We're just friends, and happily so, but sometimes...well, you just never know.   So when we lucked into two seats at the bar and started running down the Distilled menu, the conversation started getting a little interesting. By that I mean that the drinks aren't cheap, but they're worth it. Sitting across from a bartender making interesting drinks for a couple hours definitely made us drink more quickly.   Wait, um, did I just mix in a few double entendres or am I overthinking this?  Anyway, my one objection to Maven isn't pricing - I got over that when looking at the menu online. It's that people waiting for tables are asked, and somewhat herded, into a small corner area between the bar and the front door, to \"keep this area clear for people eating at the bar.\" Um, you mean, like me? Fine, it's crowded, no worries. But at least keep the front door when it's cold and windy - please don't prop it open! The big draft was killing the mood for...my friend.",

    "review_text": "Word of the Meal: NONCHALANT  I've only been living in the SF Bay Area for less than a year (approximately 8 months or so now), but I am quick to jump on a new brunch option as the next San Franciscan. Submerged in such a thick cultural milieu where brunch can range the gamut from classy to trashy has definitely piqued my curiosity. The search for the next Nopa or Mama's has definitely become a fun way to explore the city and spend quality time with the Mister and friends. After hearing from a DailyCandy email about Maven starting a new brunch concept, I had anticipated a crazy wait time on opening weekend. After avoiding the first two weekends or so, the Mister and I stopped in today at about 1pm and to our surprise were seated quickly. Actually, not only was there not a line, but we could also pick out our own spot amongst the communal tables - a huge plus especially when you're picky about who to avoid sitting next to (e.g. no babies, no loud, obnoxious fraternity guys or sorority girls, etc.). Immediately upon entering, we were greeted warmly by someone with a chef's coat. He didn't introduce himself, but if he did and was the chef, that would have been a sweet touch.  We sat by the window at the end of an empty communal table. The day started out overcast and by the time we left (about 3:40pm) it was hot almost too hot to sit by the window. We started out with ordering some drinks - the Summer's Kiss (a refreshing strawberry, tomato water concoction with gin or vodka I think with a metal straw, a cool detail), the Death in the Afternoon (champagne poured over absinthe sorbet which was a great presentation and had a mild, not overpowering black liquorice taste), and two Smokin' Marias (which we thought were derivations of the Bloody Mary, but to our surprise were orange and had a different take on heat; instead of pepper and Tabasco, the heat was more like a habanero chilli). All the drinks were yummy, but we would definitely go for seconds with the first two. If you're ready for the habanero kick, by all means, the Smokin' Maria is for you!  To eat, we shared the bacon and cheddar scone which was flakey and more like a delicious biscuit. It actually had visible pieces of bacon which was a nice touch to add texture to taste. I had the southern style eggs benedict which was your standard eggs benedict with smoky ham and some cayenne pepper. The eggs had some runny whites, but that didn't get in the way of me eating it and it was served over English muffin halves. The dish also came with a side of garlic smashed potatoes. They weren't exactly smashed but if they were, I think the seasoning would have been more consistent throughout the side. The Mister had Maven burger cooked medium rare. The cook on the burger was right, and it was served with what tasted like vinegar potato chips. The chips were tangy, light and crispy. I wish there was the option of fries, but alas c'est la vie.   Later in the meal, a friend joined us and we shared a large french press of blue bottle coffee sweetened with chilled agave nectar which was a nice end to a meal. At no time did we feel rushed or pressured to turn over our seats. It was a nonchalant brunch with great conversation and a nice tone to the meal. The living wall over the bar was nice eye candy. The drinks were enjoyable and the menu had a lot of sides (such as billionaire's bacon) which we will definitely try in the future.   Maven's brunch is definitely an up and comer. Located in the Haight, I hope that the tourists stay away and the feel of the brunch remains nonchalant. Although, I enjoy the like of Mama's and Dottie's, brunch places with hype and long lines, I find my most enjoyable meals over conversation and light-hearted exchanges in nonchalant spots like Maven.",

    "review_text": "The boy and I had just finished an afternoon of hiking up in Sausalito and we decided that we needed snacks and drinks to revitalize us. \u00a0I begged him to take me to Maven which has been on my list ever since they opened a month ago. \u00a0And snacks and drinks we had! (and had...and had...)  The concept here is fantastic--we've all had wine pairings and beer pairings before--but what about COCKTAIL pairings with food? \u00a0Mmmm. \u00a0And I love how the menu doesn't hit you over the head with the pairing suggestions--it just sort of pairs horizontally across the menu so you can feel free to try their pairings or you can pick and choose given your liquor preferences.  We sat at the bar, which boasts a great assortment of hand-picked liquors. \u00a0We were especially impressed that they carried St. George's gin! \u00a0I had been wanting to try it ever since I read about them on TastingTable.  I can't say enough good things about the food. \u00a0There *would* have been pictures of all this yumminess had I not inhaled everything as soon as it was set in front of us.  We started off with little nibbles: Global Warming and Three Little Birds and a plate of fries with aoli. \u00a0Then we moved on to the scallop crudo which was a bright and refreshing counterpart to the hot salty crispy fries we had just snacked on. \u00a0I could have licked the plate and made sure I didn't miss a single morsel of the tart apples on the plate. \u00a0I was sold. \u00a0Light snacking? \u00a0Forget it. \u00a0I needed to try more. \u00a0  We followed that up with the Chinatown duck sliders which were sauced to perfection. \u00a0I cannot recommend enough that you get a glass of the La Maudite to pair with it. \u00a0The slightly sweet amber red ale is an amazing counterbalance to the mildly spicy sliders. \u00a0Divine. \u00a0  Even though we had dinner waiting for us at home, we couldn't resist trying just a little more of the menu--so we chucked our best intentions of going home and having salads for dinner and stayed where we were. \u00a0On the owner's recommendation, we tried the Artic Char. \u00a0I think I just drooled on my \u00a0keyboard thinking back on it. \u00a0The crispy skin, the tangy broth, the pickled mussels, the PERFECTLY cooked fish... \u00a0It was a work of art. \u00a0I am talking, straight up, party in my mouth. \u00a0We paired that with the Hibiki Highball (which comes with a block of ice in the glass--I have a weakness for highball glass sized ice blocks or ice spheres). \u00a0  We wrapped up the night with the Mayan chocolate brownies with the house-made cardamom ice cream and the New Boy Valentine. \u00a0  The space is beautiful! \u00a0It's perfect for a cozy date, or a place to grab drinks and snacks with girlfriends. \u00a0It's modern and trendy without being crazy or overly pretentious. \u00a0The place was packed by 7pm on Sunday, which is impressive for a month-old restaurant. \u00a0I'm glad we stopped by early for our snacks and drinks since it looked like there was a wait by the time we got up to leave!! \u00a0  We'll be back soon for sure!!",

    "review_text": "Went to Maven twice in one week AND I had to cross a bridge to get here! I feel slightly conflicted with my review. On my first visit, I was completely blown away by the tasty small bites and clever drinks. However, my second visit was not as spectacular as my first. So I will settle with 4 stars for Maven.  Let me start off by saying this: all of the rage you hear about the Brussels sprouts are absolutely true. Maven brilliantly reinvents these usually despised and frowned upon mini cabbages. They are so delicious...and nutritious! Roasted in apple gastrique, the shells are crisp and smoky while the interior is nutty and tender. The caramelized sugar brightens the flavor and creates a mild tartness. But proceed with caution; the savory tartness might be a bit too much (AKA eat in moderation because they can overwhelm your taste buds and the sprouts start to lose their magic).   Now onto the Chinatown Duck Sliders! During our first visit, these were out of this world good. Succulent pieces of pulled duck topped with a fat juicy black mushroom and fresh gai lan, all nestled between two lightly toasted buns. Oh my Atlanta! My friends and I were left speechless. Simply a lot of head nodding. Yet, on our second visit, the flavors were more subtle and didn't blend as well as the first time. It was still good but the duck was dry and I barely tasted the gai lan.  We also tried their Kennebec Fries and Monterey Calamari. The fries are your standard fried potatoes--I actually prefer Mickey D's fries more. The calamari came with an addicting Thai chili. It was not cool how half of the squid was fried (arms) and the other half wasn't (body). That's not calamari if the squid isn't fried!  The drinks are consistently solid. My friend loves the Nauti' Mermaid and I recommend the 5 Spot. You receive plenty of booze and an abundance of spellbinding flavors in one glass. Maven has hipster written all over it, frequented by young and attractive ladies and gents. There is always a wait but it's never as long as the hosts estimate. The decor and atmosphere are modern and trendy with a tinge of intimacy. You sit at long wooden communal tables, but nothing wrong with getting cozy with your fellow diners. Service is exceptional. The waiters kept refilling our water. It's SF, so expect to wander and battle for parking. My friends and I speculate that Saturdays are the best nights. Our first visit was a Saturday and the food was outstanding. Will definitely return for the Brussels sprouts and duck sliders!",

    "review_text": "I really like the idea of this place. While I visited the bay last, I learned why you'd pair some wine with some cheese. I gained an appreciation. Here at Maven, I got a similar experience. Food is paired with beer and wine. Each item had a counterpart in the liquids department. This is a great way to get drunk if you order a drink with everything you eat, but most likely you'll be broke before doing so.  For a gastropub-type of place, prices are where you'd expect so I won't get into it because I don't think it's the problem. I think portions are. We were frustrated with the fact that the item we loved most (the brussel sprouts) was served in the tiniest portion ever. Even the calamari (also delicious) served more people. This is annoying.  On that note, I do recommend the brussel sprouts. They were the crowd favorite. Closely followed by the calamari. Various chunks and slices of calamari fried up lightly. Still tender and delicious. The duck sliders were a bit underwhelming, mainly because they were served cold. Considering they each took a couple bites and there were just two of them, we wished there was more for what we paid. Finally, the burger. It's a burger.  Drinks were spot on. I think this is their forte. Service was a little bi-polar with one overly excited server who was very amusing, and one extremely not so amused and bored. Atmosphere was great, with long tables and a lot of good energy floating around. Worth coming back to for the drinks and a good conversation.",

The burger was pretty bland and the person who ordered it didn't even finish it. The mussels were okay, but nothing to get too excited about.

The space is beautiful. \u00a0The tables are made of redwood, there's a vertical garden on the wall above the bar and the high windows make for excellent people watching on Haight Street if you sit on the second level. \u00a0The service is also top notch. \u00a0Every staff member was extremely friendly and our food came out really quickly. \u00a0The food is high quality and tasty, but very small, especially for the price. \u00a0The drinks aren't cheap either, but that's what you have to expect when dining at a place like Maven.  I had the Winter Tart - a deconstructed mushroom tart, which was quite tasty and butternut squash ravioli, which was rich, but very good. \u00a0I will definitely be back. \u00a0This is a great spot to enjoy a glass of wine or cocktail with a good friend over a small plate of food. \u00a0  I recommend getting there before 6:30 for the first couple of months if you don't want to wait for a table. \u00a0They don't take reservations. \u00a0I sent them an email earlier in the week and they responded very quickly and suggested I come in before 7pm to avoid a wait.",

    "review_text": "I went here on a date and was pleasantly surprised by many things (i'll start with those) and disappointed by a couple.  Pleased: -The rustic-jungly atmosphere was awesome--eating dinner in what feels like a greenhouse/apothecary's shop was quite unique. Plants hung from bar to ceiling and I couldn't help but wonder how they water them. The addition of the community seating was a nice touch but not for an intimate date. The second floor overlooks the rest of the place and gave plenty of opportunities for people watching.  -The food (most of it). Cheese plate was delicious but did not come with enough bread, and I found myself wishing it was crostini not soft french bread, but I digress...Duck sliders were delectable and had excellent flavor. The heirloom tomatoes tasted like tomatoes should: fruity, tangy and sweet. I only wished we could have eaten all of them before our plate was snagged away (see disappointed category below).  Disappointed: -The service. Scratch that, the server, who barely spoke a word to us, and gave a condescending and surprised look when we asked to see the list for bottles of wine (yes, even plaid wearing people can afford bottles of wine, sir). The only time he spoke up was when describing the wine (maybe making up for his demeaning attitude earlier) and ranted on for 5 minutes! After that though, we were back to our void-of-personality-self who either came too early and took dishes away before done (tomatoes), or taking forever to make room for new plates.  -The pork loin &amp; shoulder. It was good. But not $25 good. Slightly dry and lacked something... Chef Banks at Five in Berkeley may be at fault for my high standards, but I am OK with that.  All in all I liked Maven, and will not discredit the restaurant for a server who may have just been having a bad day....",

I have two big complaints about Maven, however:  (1) The seating is at long communal tables with bar stools, which is just uncomfortable and awkward for everyone. They need to just switch to regular individual tables. Everyone prefers individual tables. Communal tables are dumb.  (2) The prices are high compared to the portion size. For example, toast does not come with your order. In my opinion, toast should be complementary with brunch. We ordered some, and for $3 got three little pieces of toast. It was good toast, but not worth $1 for each little piece.",

The restaurant itself is really pretty (especially at night) and makes you feel like you want to sit there for hours with a best friend or lover and talk about anything and everything, while sipping their classy, smart cocktails. There's just something about this place...  Anyways, for cocktails, I had:  -Peruvian Panty Dropper (pisco, asian pear, cran-honey, lemon). I effing LOVED this drink and wanted 2 more but chose to continue to explore their awesome cocktail menu.  -Hires' Hand \u00a0(rye, maple, root beer spice, charred rosemary). This was a little sweet for me, but somehow also managed to be SUPER strong (that's a good thing!) and the charred rosemary smelled like Christmas. That made me happy.  -Pumpkin Spiced Notte (cognac, pumpkin, allspice, hazelnut, lemon, egg white). You know how basic b*tches love pumpkin spice lattes? Well, whatever the opposite of a basic b*tch is, that's who loves these pumpkin spiced nottes. Seriously. I wanted to dive into my little cocktail glass and swim circles while humming the song from the Lego movie \"Everything is Awesommmmeeeeeeeee!!!!!....\". Order this drink, or you will have 10 years bad luck.  Appetizers we shared: P.E.I. Mussels, Kennebec Fries, Broccoli Tempura and Crispy Brussels Sprouts. The mussel broth was great, the bread they serve with the mussels was BORN to be dipped in that broth (don't be shy and ask for an extra side of that bread). The Brussel sprouts were crispy and heavenly. I wasn't crazy about the broccoli and the fries were fries.   I think our waitress was pregnant. She was super nice and attentive.

The calamari was just 4-5 small pieces, stringy and a bland sauce with it - the worst I've had I think..... \u00a0The vegetable tart did not look anything like a tart, more like 3-4 cookies with some random ingredients scattered around the place and a bit of a sauce, I honestly don't remember what other 3 plates we had - must have been that bland as I normally remember great food. \u00a0So I feel ike I had to write this review as the place was a huge dissapointment.

I had the Fireside cocktail, calamari two ways, duck sliders, &amp; the brussel sprouts - all of which were spectacular and surprising. I've had each of these types of plates at a number of restaurants before but I was still surprised at how different they were able to arrange these plates. The calamari was served 1/2 of the plated grilled and the other fried all sitting in an amazing sauce. I loved the variety of textures. The duck sliders were a decent size, meat was flavorful and tender but the wow-moment was the large shitake mushrooms inside. The brussel sprouts were by far the most rich in flavor, served burnt - the brussels had a unique crispy texture and soaked in a tangy vinaigrette. I eat brussel as an every day veggie but this dish blew my mind.   Maven is excellent for dates. Soft dim lighting in an approachable community table type atmosphere. Sexy but casual.

They have a great bar area, the bartenders crafting their drinks are surely fun to watch with an open kitchen located towards the back. It's got enough food items to keep your appetite in check, but perhaps not the best place to come to expecting a full on meal.

My sister ordered the good day omelet. We got to the restaurant at opening and sat at the chefs bar, mistake number one! Let me tell you, you do not want to sit and watch as the kitchen literally throws away your food TWICE before cooking you the \"correct\" form of eggs on the third try. Probably the most frustrating thing I've experienced in a looooong time. Meanwhile we watch as they send the omelet made for my sister to another patron, because my food isn't finished, only to let my sisters remade food sit on top of the oven for another 10 minutes waiting for them to make my food, yet again. Meanwhile they have already cooked our bacon and our sausage, but do they remake those?? Of course not! Because who doesn't love dry, crumbly sausage, or weirdly burnt at the ends and raw in the middle bacon? I kid you not Yelpers, this was what was served to me. So finally I receive my eggs, gotta say I had HIGH hopes of delicious yokey (yes yokey, it may not be a word in your book but it is in mine) eggs, only to cut those baby opens and have runny white come flowing out! Who doesn't want some salmonella with their breakfast? I know I do! I literally ate one bite of everything, and when the poor sweet waitress, who was completely innocent in this entire food experience, comes over to ask how my meal was? Let me tell you!!! Nooooot great. A shining light? They removed all of the crappy \u00a0food that was served to me from my bill. What was left? The French press coffee (okay, not enough cream is given and half the coffee had settled to the bottom before it even got to our table) and my sisters omelet, which was luke warm, rather than hot and fresh, as food should be... Who knew putting a plate on top of an oven wouldn't keep it fresh and hot for the future consumer? Not the kitchen that's for sure.   All in all Yelpers, do not bother. I would suggest other meals but the couple next to use got the duck hash and looked just about as happy with it as we did with our meal.   The wait staff was great, we tipped our server based on the original bill because we didn't think she deserved to lose out.  Find a new brunch spot.",

We ordered drinks at the bar and got tipsy while we waited for our table. The drinks were amazing, btw. I was enjoying watching the bartenders make drinks. Our bartender had this awesome tattoo on his arm and in my tired and tipsy haze, I was watching his arms shaking all the drinks and thinking how his arms must be so strong. :/  Anyways, we were finally seated upstairs at one of the couches so we ordered another round of drinks while we waited for our food. I really enjoyed both drinks I got that night (International Mistress and Cats Meow) but my friend didn't like her second drink. I'm not sure what she got because the studly arm tattoo bartender made something for her after asking what she likes. HOWEVER, the point of this story is that our waitress (who was also really awesome because she asked us if we needed rescuing when two guys came up to us and started chatting) must have noticed my friend didn't really touch her drink because the bartender came upstairs and personally asked if she liked the drink. I was really impressed by this attention to detail. My friend tried to be polite but he knew she didn't like the drink so he took it away and we weren't charged for it.   I honestly cannot remember what we ordered to eat but it was all quite delicious. I just remember the gnocchi was amazing and we wished we had skipped all the other foods and ordered five of the gnocchi. Wishful thinking.",

I just went last night for drinks with my GF on our way home from dinner elsewhere. She had the Global Warming which comes with an absinthe sorbet (wtf) and loved. I need to add that she HATES absinthe, well she did at least. The service is cool, with being open only 2 night they were calm and collected and it was nice to see it so packed on a Thursday. I'm sure there will be some kinks to work out, but that should be expected with something so new. And to Noah G who's trying to get a hold of the staff, just go knock on the door in the day time. Someone is usually there or go in and get a drink at night while you make your purchase.",

The curated menu of small plates and drinks compliment the low-key atmosphere, with a high-end expectation for quality food and original cocktails.   I ordered a Hometown Vixen, which was a mix of bourbon, pistachio, orange, lemon and gomme. (What's gomme? \u00a0Says bartender: A simple syrup with a silkier texture and far better for mixing in drinks). \u00a0  The menu is divided by rows and columns. The recommended food and beverage pairings can be found along each row. Since I ordered the Hometown Vixen, I followed with a pairing of the Broccoli Agnolotti- ravioli styled pasta stuffed with broccoli, cipollini onions, tasso ham, broccoli crowns and mimolette cheese. Very delicious! For dessert I treated myself to the Honey Roasted Almonds with smoked sea salt and rosemary- a little unconventional, but my boyfriend is allergic to almonds so I have to indulge whenever I can!  A good place to go with a group of friends, after work cocktail, or kill time between Point A and B. I look forward to brunch \"coming soon\", but until then the Chinatown Duck Sliders and 5 Spot are calling my name.",

Us: \"Table for 2 please?\" Host: \"We're actually full right now.\" Us: \"OK, how long will the wait be.\" Host: \"I don't actually know.\" Us: \"OK, well can we put our names on the list?\" Host: \"We don't actually keep a list. No reservations and no list.\" Us: \"Hmmm, I understand not taking rezzies, but no list? Really? OK, well can we get a drink at the bar while we wait.\" Host: \"Um, no, we actually can't have you wait inside the restaurant.\"  OK, so now we basically have 2 options. 1) Wait outside the restaurant and check back every 30 seconds to see if a table is ready, or 2) go somewhere else.  We really wanted to try it out, but were totally put off by the service. So, we opted for a decent meal a few doors down.   Either the owners have no idea how to run a restaurant or the host has no idea how to work the door, or both. I'll stop by again in a month or so when they've had a chance to work out the kinks, but I certainly hope they figure out a better seating arrangement!",

Very clean, and rustically modern.  We opted to sit at the bar since it was just the two of us. The drinks here were great. I was severely hung over so the Bloody Mary really brought me back to life. This was a great bloody because it was more flavorful and spicy than just pure booze or tomato juice. The balsamic vinegar and basil were great additions and the pickled vegetables that came with it were so delicious that I had to ask for more.  Everything on the menu looked great and I was deciding between the Duck Hash or the Breakfast Banh Mi. I decided to be more adventurous and choose the banh mi because I had never had a breakfast version. My friend got the flatbread with a lot of seasonal vegetables on it. Both our dishes were humongous. You know it's big when it can barely fit on the plate. The banh mi had a lot of potential but I think the sum of the components just didn't work together. The bread used was quite soft and one of the most important parts about a banh mi is the integrity of the bread. This along with the oozing fried egg made it impossible to really pick up and eat without making a huge mess and falling apart so I ended up just knife and forking it and eating the interior. It was also noticeably missing a spice component. I noticed there weren't sliced jalapenos included, which is fine for this version but it definitely needed some spice factor so I asked for hot sauce. I wouldn't order it again unless they make some changes but the idea is still a good one.",

    "review_text": "Maven was awesome. It was a trendy place I found on Yelp and Google. Medium sized on the corner of Haight St. Great decor and atmosphere.   We were celebrating a belated valentines day dinner so weren't too worried about the budget, which could get easily stretched here if not kept under control. I had 3 pints of North Coast and Pam tried various wines.   We started with the Chinatown duck sliders and Penn Cove mussels. Both were FANTASTIC. Unbelievable. Portions were appetizer sized as advertised but not a huge deal - the taste made up for it. Can't tell you how good these were.   The customer service was phenomenal - our host also waited on us and couldn't have been friendlier. Hip young staff and they all seemed to genuinely enjoy what they were doing.   Strongly recommended for a taste of local San Francisco cuisine and not that touristy bullshit most people decide to do.",

    "review_text": "When you enter Maven, it really seems like the younger sibling of NOPA -- the decor, the atmosphere, the crowd. It's much smaller and seems much artsier (the artistic red lamps, the upright garden directly above the bar) than NOPA, but lacks a bit of the welcoming vibe that NOPA has. This could just be because Maven is the new kid on the block and really needs some time to adjust into its own, but I definitely felt that it was trying a little too hard to impress.  Our server, Jordan, was awesome. Very relaxed, personable, and not at all pushy. We did have one random female server come and just grab our plate (which still had about 4 or 5 fries on it), before we were finished. Even if there was nothing on the plate, it's only courteous for the server to ask if we're finished before she grabs it away. Didn't like that at all. But Jordan was great.  -----------------------------  FOOD:  Savory Winter Tart = Delicious. The combination of the flaky pastry crust, the ricotta cheese, and the mushrooms was perfect. It was oily, for sure, but not so much that you were overwhelmed.   Chinatown Duck Slider = Excellent. The duck was extremely tender and the flavors meshed together very well. The bread was a buttery brioche that complemented the duck incredibly.  Broccoli Angolotti = I wasn't a fan of this dish at all. The pasta was very tough and firm, and I couldn't really taste the broccoli. It was actually quite frankly very tasteless and underwhelming.  Maven Burger = This burger was okay. I've definitely had much better burgers in SF that have packed much more flavor. We ordered the burger medium-rare, but it came closer to medium-well. There was a faint pink in the center, but the burger was way too overcooked. I think the burger would go better with a more tangy sauce or even a fried egg to give it some more flavor.  Kennebec Fries w/ Olive Aioli = Excellent fries. Hot and crispy, with a faint but quite-addicting aioli sauce.  DRINKS:  Global Warming = Sweet and satisfying. A great sipping drink.  5 Spot = Tangy and spicy. I liked it a lot.  Three Little Birds = Decent drink. Doesn't really pack much flavor.  Hibiki Highball = It was okay. I love whiskey, but for some reason the combination of this drink was a bit tough to swallow.  Grand Total = $115.00 (including tax &amp; tip) -----------------------------  Maven is a good addition to the Lower Haight, but didn't blow my mind upon first visit. The food had its ups and downs and the drinks were good for the most part. I'm sure as Maven evolves, it'll start coming into its own and stand out as the place to be in the Lower Haight area. As for now, however, it still has a long way to go.",

    "review_text": "Maven is a trendy little spot located in Lower Haight, nestled on the corner of Steiner and Fillmore. They serve up awesome small plates/tapas so this place is ideal for sharing. It's also filled with communal tables so expect to sit next to strangers while you dine here, however, don't be discouraged. They do a good job of spacing the chairs/stools.   CRISPY BRUSSELS SPROUTS ~ 4.5 stars ~ $6: Brussels have been something I've grown to love more and more with age. I enjoy them most roasted - crispy shell, tender interior and some bitterness. Maven does an amazing job adding flavor to their Brussels preparing it with an apple gastrique. The caramelization of the sugar deglazed with balsamic vinegar gives it good bite to compliment the natural bitterness.   KENNEBEC FRIES ~ 4 stars ~ $6: Seasoned with juniper salt and served with housemade olive aioli. Great crunch, nice flavor. It's a great compliment to whatever you're having with it, however, I'd pass on these. $6 for a small serving of fries is a little steep.   HOUSEMADE PICKLES ~ 4 stars ~ $7: Pickled fennel, beets, cucumbers, cauliflower and carrots served up in a mason jar. Not too vinegary with excellent flavor. Textures were all on-point especially the cauliflower. FYI, I'm a cauliwhore.   MAVEN'S BURGER ~ 5 stars ~ $12: People often lose sight of what makes a good burger. It really comes down to two things: The patty and the bun. You can throw all kinds of unique and exotic toppings and sauces on your burger but if you don't nail down the patty and misfire on the bun, everything will go downhill. Maven delivers a medium-rare patty seasoned to perfection with the help of angostura bitters. The awesome and heavenly juices flowing out of the patty after each bite is sopped up by their awesome dense but flaky bun. You get a bit of crunch and bite with the house pickles and the melted muenster holds everything together. Served with a small side of ridiculously delicious house made potato chips, this burger is fit for a king. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS.   I went with two of my buddies. Each of us ordered two beers and a cocktail. We each had a burger and shared the rest of the small plates. Pricing was awesome. We split the bill three ways and we each paid $47.06 pre-tip. I was shocked by how much of a bargain dinner was, especially when you consider how A-W-E-S-O-M-E the burger is. Service was also top-notch and the cocktails were excellent. I don't have ANYTHING negative to say about Maven. The whole dining experience was great and I would absolutely go back.",

    "review_text": "I visited Maven after reading a lot of the reviews on-line and also the Yelp reviews.   I would have to say that my experience there was wonderful, we were greeted by a wonderful hostess (Jamie) who took our name down for a table for 2.   (Seems like Maven has taken care of the list problem after their first couple of weeks opening)  We were seated very quickly and even got a Chef's table seating, which we immensely enjoyed watching the chefs cook each meal. I would highly recommended this if you like to watch chefs cook!  They were so attentive on the food preparation that they taste tested each meal and in one case the head chef re-plated the dish because the preparation was not up to par.  Our wait staff was attentive and our food came out quickly, especially since we could see it getting made. The food was hot and tasty and even though the place was pretty crowded we did not wait long for our first course.   We had the following..   Duck Sliders - These were awesome, moist and flavorful! Warm Olives - love olives, and now even better when warm! Seared Arctic Char - Wonderful light fish and the sauce was wonderful Skirt Steak - Moist, and cooked Medium with a wonderful maple sauce, the Yams were a nice addition to add some sweetness.  Lastly we spoke with one of the Owners during our meal and he asked what we would like to dessert. We told him to surprise us and he brought out the Cheese Plate with honey which was just amazing to finish off the meal along with the pairing drink (Widow's Kiss). A subtle sweetness to a fulfilling meal.  Overall the wait staff is attentive, the food was just right, and the drinks were just great.  P.S. Try the Three little birds and the Global Warming drinks.. wonderful!",
