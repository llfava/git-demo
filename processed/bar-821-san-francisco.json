Quaint, dark, and comfortable is the best way to describe Bar 821. Great diverse crowd of HOod and non-HOod dwellers. Love the vibe and ambiance, and be sure to check out the interesting flicks on their flat screen. I've been here on numerous occasions (meeting Popchip angel and Tsaritsa for the first time, pre-post dining with L, D, or M, and even a few dates, etc.,).  Best place to sit are the tables by the window. Take heed, as it can get really noisy if super crowded (typically Friday &amp; Saturday nights).   Great selection of wines, champagne cocktails, and a few beers on tap.  My fav specialty drinks are the are the Lychee and Pomegranate champagne cocktails. My most fav aspect of this bar is.... wait for it....tada.... The HO is on tap here. Oh Mylanta! My beloved HOegaarden is in my HOod bar! Gotta love it!   Bartenders are always nice, and usually just one tending. So if it's crowded, you might be waiting a bit for your bevy. Recommend going for Happy Hour during the week, and be sure to check out their daily specials and the signage by the front door. FYI, they close earlier than most bars, and closed on certain days.   Cheers and see you at Happy HOur!",

You rarely see it and I took full advantage and ordered one or two or maybe three.  My friends were all about the strawberry mojitos and some weird champagne drink that included some strange fruit thing that resembled an aliens head. Yes, I know what an aliens head looks like.  The music was eclectic and heard everything from Blink 182 to Echo and the Bunnyman and a twangy country tune that I actually liked. It may have been a little on the loud side and it made it difficult to have a converrsation, but we were there to drink so it was all good.

But the real draw is the champagne cocktails, my fave being the sparkling ginger. For $5 ($3 if you get there before 7), you get a tasty, bubbly gingery concoction. And once you've had a few too many of those, you have the option to switch to a nice pint or a glass of wine. The ambiance is totally chill- candlelit with some comfy benches (although the accompanying chairs totally blow- good excuse to sit next to your honey for better hand-on-thigh action). In addition, there's always a classic cult movie playing on the TV (muted) with the bartender's ipod at work (he plays good stuff).

And when you're 20 and at bars at UVA, you're more akin to a senior citizen than a fresh fish.   However, apparently being 22 and at Bar 821 on a Wednesday night, I'm too young. The time that elapsed between me walking in the door and the bartender's unprovoked issuing of this statement was roughly 26.5 seconds. He then proceeded, completely unwarranted I might mind you, to assault my 22 year old friend with the belligerent denunciation that his taste in women was limited to drunk, blonde sorority girls. This may or may not be true.   Now, I really, really wanted to like this bar. Prior to my 26th second in this bar, I quickly fell in love with the low slung leather lounging couches studded with low rising circular tables, the easily manageable (un)crowd, the relaxing lighting and the $3.50 Coronas. But it's difficult to love a bar when the snarky bartender picks out your lil-bit buzzed and slow-on-the-draw friend as a target in his lame attempt to impress girls with his supposedly witty repartee. I wholly understand he was trying to impress the girls to our right. But c'mon, you're the bartender, if you're so desperate to impress them, give them a damn shot.",

There are many reasons to love this place:   * Chimay on tap (and a good selection of other premium beers)  * Sangria  * Very chill atmosphere  * Friendly staff  Last time I was here the bar tender asked us to choose the music we wanted to here, which was a nice touch.  The only bad thing about this place is that it's cash only. While they have an ATM there it does get annoying to constantly be pulling out your wallet when you know you're going to be there for a few drinks. I'd prefer to just open a tab and pay at the end.",

I stopped in last night (seriously, it's probably been well over a year since I've stepped foot in the place) and REALLY liked some of the tweaks they've made! The big change being they now serve liquor, and have a pretty extensive drink menu (written on a cool chalkboard) with tons of signature drinks.   I don't know if the chalkboard &amp; light-up liquor display are the only changes they've made, but honestly, those couple tweaks just gave this place a whole new vibe I really like.   The only reason I'm not bumping to 5 stars is because I was here early on a Wednesday night for a drink with some friends. I'd like to see what it's like on a busy Fri/Sat night to get the full effect.",

Well, the bartender had poured us the rest of an open bottle (maybe 1.5 glasses) and then opened a whole bottle that we ordered.... Great, right? Well, she made us pay for the TWO glasses that she poured. WHAT??!!! It's prosecco, it's CHEAP! Why do this?! It was WHOLLY UNPLEASANT on principle.   I am NOT coming back.

I was having drinks with my friend who rarely leaves the 4 block radius of his house, and since I am only drinking vino these days, he suggested this place. As I walked up the block, I was looking for some place called 821 and of course, it's the address. I don't know what it is about bars that take that direction, but they always seem to be pretty cool. Take 83 Proof for example. Maybe too many bars are over thinking fancy titles, when your addy is a good route to go. Just sayin...  Anyhoo, when I walked in, I instantly loved the fact that it was nice and dark. It wasn't dark and divey like I generally tend to gravitate towards, but instead it was dark, modern and very cool and still approachable and comfy. Definitely not an easy decor cocktail to mix.  The bartender (Joey) working that night instantly made me feel at home and definitely scores my coveted 5 stars for blasting Richard Ashcroft for the entire time I was there. He must be psychic since RA is one of my all-time faves!!   I will definitely be returning!

So we had a nice light dinner and wine at my place, then cabbed it over to NoPa for a change of scenery.   The place is very cute and upscaley feeling without upscaley prices. We both had specialty soju cocktails: she had the Lychee Mermaid and I had some kind of \"Gin\" Negroni. Her drink was sweet and subtle, mine tasted like earwax. Yes, I know what earwax tastes like, judge away. Surely it's difficult to mask soju in a gin flavor. And, real-talk, I didn't know it was soju until after I ordered.   Around $8 a cocktail and a very ncie ambiance, I can't complain too much. OR CAN I? One bartender for the whole place? Really? It's NoPa.

So the drink I got came from Sarah S' suggestion, although it did make the bartender whiny because apparently it is hard to make (which is why you won't see it on the menu). \u00a0The drink was Guinness+Champagne. \u00a0Sounds dreadful on paper, but it was delicious. \u00a0In fact, I think it is my new favorite drink... Sorry Bar-man...  There were only 2 negatives. \u00a0The fact that the bartender told me he hated me when I asked him to make the Guinness+Champagne, and the fact that last call was at 10:30.  I really think this place would boom if they doubled the prices, dropped it straight in the heart of the Marina, played old kung fu movies on a projector at the back of the lounge, and played <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwoxy.com&amp;s=7b81a4bf1adcf3aeb49449e19616955e1c355d6ae7500e41e5184044e1a6682a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">woxy.com</a> radio. \u00a0But I am happy to have them in my neck of the woods instead.",

Minimum age is 21 to drink... Well, I'm old already so whatever. But then the bar only serves wine, champagne sake and beers. Something about the license?... I guess some people might be put down by that, but for me it's not a problem too. I had two different champagne drinks, and I liked them a lot. And the tap Chimay was great. The beer selection looked great to me, and good prices too. I can't tell of any food, didn't try it. Bathroom was fine.  A game was on TV, but it didn't seem anyone was there to watch it. I saw _some_ \u00a0people there, mostly friends and couples talking, it seems. Anyway, I was liking the place a lot. The music was really really good, lots of soul and funk... But then, they had to close at 11pm. That's just crazy. Is it something about the license too??  So everything about the place looks great. But it made me go home earlier, and I have to take a star for that. And it looked like it was much emptier than it could be _just_ \u00a0because of that. So because this problem seems to be really hurting the place indeed, I must take a second star.  Best place to go if you want to have some good time on a place where it will be really easy to sit and to get your orders. And then come home early. If you want that real memorable \"fun times\" parties, and totally \"spend the night\" somewhere, look for another place.  Maybe it just pretends to be a good place to get the night started, whatever.",

Indeed, they only serve nice people. Everyone there was smiling and polite. None of that meat market mentality here. Also, there was an oasis of sexy accents there that night - British, particularly. Rowr. The bartender from Manchester is a sweetheart and will offer suggestions for adventurous tastes. Ask him about the ABC, which was created there, courtesy of said bartender and fellow Yelper/local Gabriel T.: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RDwgEc8o15O2wqu-YQu29Q\">yelp.com/user_details?us\u2026</a>  Tap is a selection of European beers. Cocktails are $4, Champagne cocktails $5, and they have a nice one-page list of wines as well. It's all there in the handy laminated menus they leave out on the tables. Don't worry, it's actually legible in the candlelight.  I'd love to see a collaboration with their sister restaurant Tsunami, or Cafe Abir, to bring snacks/food pairings to their wines, champagnes and beers.  Eat before or after to absorb the alcohol by going across the street for good pizza - Star Pizza and Stella Doro. And no need to drive, when the 24 Muni stops just at the next corner down.",

    "review_text": "If Bar 821 were a drink, it would be the Black Velvet.  The pairing of Guinness with Champagne is the perfect contrast between the everyday and the extraordinary that makes this place so unique. \u00a0It's one part lounge, one part neighborhood watering hole, one part hipster dive. \u00a0And it works together beautifully.  I've been here twice now and both times I have felt so relaxed and at home. \u00a0The noise level never gets too high, and people are respectful of each other. \u00a0The crowd is mixed, from people waiting to eat at Tsunami to the guys from Everlasting Tattoo a few doors down to the regulars. \u00a0The first time I was there, I watched a really cool skateboard video and just hung out while I sipped my Black Velvet and waited for my Little Star Pizza to be ready. \u00a0The next time, I brought my friend Michael and we had a grand time shooting the shit and enjoying the $3 Happy Hour cocktails.  That's right, 5-7pm Happy Hour = $3 for everything. \u00a0You be hard-pressed to find a better deal than that. \u00a0  I prefer the Champagne cocktails to the soju drinks, although my friend liked the Apple Mojito a lot. \u00a0For the champagne cocktails, I would recommend the Ginger one or the Lychee. \u00a0There is also a Chocolate/strawberry one that I would love to try when strawberries are in season. \u00a0As for my beloved Black Velvet, it will have to remain but a memory, as this lovely concoction is now off of the menu.   Lighting is low (good for dates) and seating is relatively comfy \u00a0(bench seats and padded chairs, or bar stools) - and the bathroom has these amazing walls that you just have to see for yourself.   It's a simple bar with a good atmosphere and very friendly service - a place where you can relax with friends in a chill neighborhood environment.  Note: \u00a0Cash only. \u00a0(At Happy Hour, you can get 6 drinks for $18! Yeah!)",

I wasn't able to open up a tab ,which would make things a whole lot easier (especially if you're with a group of friends).   That was my only complaint.

In my years of happy hour'ing and my years of coughing, I have never once encountered a bartender who gives a glass of water out of the goodness of his heart. \u00a0In fact when I ask for a glass of water, I've encountered exasperated bartenders, rolling eyes bartenders, dude I'm busy bartenders, but never once a thoughtful water-giver. \u00a0 Thanks Joey. \u00a0You've given this lady renewed hope. \u00a0Thoughtfulness is still alive and kicking.",

The night before we had drank and ate and spent too much, therefore we had promised ourselves a nice quiet Friday night. We arrived at 5:15 and ended up stumbling home at 2:30 in the morning... Our ship crashed upon the rocky shores of intoxication after hearing the Syren song of good cheap drinks. Happy Hour is that good here. Technically it lasts two hours, but during those two hours everything is three dollars. Granted they don't have a full bar but they do have great beers, wine, champagne and soju cocktails.   We drink our way through happy hour and then went \u00a0around the corner for some sushi. We eat and drink our way through dinner and evidently we lost track of time because the waitress asked if we would like to finish our bottle of sake at Bar 821. Bar 821 is owned by the same people that own Nihon and Tsunami, where we were eating at the time. For the inconvenience they gave us each a free drink at the bar. Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in...  We walked back in to a much more crowded bar, but they had put us at a reserved table with our drinks waiting on us. The sun had dropped during dinner and the bar wasn't near as bright and looked much better. Do you know of any bar that looks better during the day? That's not to say the bar isn't pretty because it is. It is very tastefully decorated. Throughout out the night service was top notch and I am sure we will be coming back in the near future. Hopefully, next time my internal fortitude will be a bit stronger and I will be able to call it a day after Happy Hour ends...",

With so much AWESOME going on within these walls, you can bet I'll be showing my face around these here parts a hell of a lot more often now. JAMES (Thanks, G!) \u00a0the bartender is adorable and super friendly and like I said, there are some pretty hot hotty regulars, too.   Little Star is right across the street and I hear they'll let you bring in food from outside so you can get your drink AND your eat on. The inside is cute and neighborhood-bar-ish. Nice bathroom with cool mirrors. If you live in the neighborhood, I highly recommend!",

    "review_text": "After looking for a happy hour bar around work and seeing rave reviews for Bar 821, I had it on my radar for sometime.   I made plans to meet up with a mate to see a show at the Independent at 9pm. I had separate dinner plans so I arrived at 9:10 a little tipsy after copious amounts of sake at Warakabune only to find out my lazy ass mate is still at home waiting on his harem of mingers to gather and feed him grapes.   So I wait. and wait..... 45 mins go by and the novelty of the $5 Polaroid dude wears off and no other eccentrics are around to keep me occupied. So I decide on a course of action: drinks.  So the choices at hand were Madrone, Fly bar, coffeeshop, or Bar821. And i chose wisely. The little dark chic wine bar with only a fledgling little skimp of a sign to signify its existence was A find.   The staff there were the friendliest in the city. None of that grunting that bar staff all round the city seem to communicate with but sincere, friendly service.  Going to a bar alone can be intimidating however, Bar 821 was very accommodating and made the experience very amicable.  I sipped my cab and left \u00a0to meet up with my friend. Upon leaving the bar I realized that I wasn't pissed at my friend for being an hour late but i was glad that a bar could still be cool and sexy and not fore sake the very virtue that keeps people coming back, a space to socialize without judgment.  Kudos to you, Bar 821 for keeping it real and....for having a tattoo parlor right \u00a0next door. hm  I'll leave you with Blink 182, Bar 821.  All the, small things  True care, truth brings  I'll take, one lift  Your ride, best trip  Cheers",

But on a Thursday night, there was only one bartender and it must have been over 10 minutes before we got our drinks. I ordered two drinks and she said it'd be a minute. 10+ minutes later and comes back to me and looks to me as if I haven't ordered before. I said I already ordered and she continues to give me a blank stare, kind of like a \"what do you want\" look. I repeated myself and she finally made it.  She seemed to consistently take in at least a few orders at a time before she fulfilled them, which is probably why she forgot. I saw others wait a long time, too.   There really needs to be another bartender.",

Or switch that around, depending on who you bed/board with.  The bartenders are friendly, funny, and ultimately solid; the beers are well-picked; the crowd is a nice mix of locals and folks going to shows at the Independent.

Ended up getting a pitcher of sangria (really good, very strong cinnamon). Perfect to split between 2-3 people. All drinks were around $6-8.  My biggest complaint is that they had last call way early (like 11:30pm on a Saturday). And they cleared the alcohol off our table just after midnight (some sort of rule). This was very disappointing.  Environment: Small, dark, not terribly inviting. Seating at the bar or small tables with chairs and a booth bench. Service: Order at the bar, sit anywhere.

We don't like cars so we fuck up the last Friday of the month for every single person who works downtown and just wants to go home and clean up and go out with their friends by not allowing them to get home, even when they are taking public transportation. We don't like plastic bags so we have now outlawed those. We don't like the war and at least once a week we make that known with some protest. That is cool, I am all for getting out on a Friday at 10pm, carrying my 40 in a brown paper bag (as it should be) and lets face it, a war would really put a damper on my Friday plans. So, if we can take the time to speak up about these things why cant we let the people of these neighborhoods know that we want a few more bars that serve hard alcohol!! I mean, I am unsure that serving beer and wine is going to save us from anyone who wants to be drunk and unruly. Newsflash, they can still get drunk and unruly on beer, I swear, and if the liquor store on the corner carries Jack you are not keeping it from them prohibition style or anything. You can serve alcohol in a lower proof form in a bar, out of anything you want, to people on bikes who hate war, but if they drink and want to get drunk they will!!! Can we please have some bars that afford us the luxury of doing this on our own terms!!??  Bar 821, its not your fault. You work with that permit well. You have a good selection of wines by the glass and bottle, and tasty beers and sparkly and soju all at very fair prices for a wine bar. You do your best to provide a nice selection of alcohol \"lite\" in a dark, loungy, inviting way, but damnit, sometimes I just want a sapphire and tonic. However, when I do have a hankering for some wine while in your neck of the woods you are my first choice.  Anyone up for a protest, or at least a glass of wine?",

I think things started going downhill for me when i ordered the \"Valentine\" simply because I wanted chocolate and it has a piece of chocolate in it. so there i was trying to get the piece of chocolate that was going UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN in the champagne. I finally got it but that was after chugging the champagne and swallowing the raspberry whole. but the moral of the story is, i got the chocolate.  i dont know what to say about the clientele, i was too wrapped up in my best friends who were visiting, but they were all friendly. i think.  the place is very clean and nice and the bathroom is fine as well. i remember wishing htey had more than just one unisex bathroom though.  so it's 7 o'clock and i realize that i'm drunk and that i can only maintain my facade of tipsiness for so long before I start acting a fool so i whisper to my friend \"jo, i need to get out of here i think everyone is noticing the little drunk asian girl in the corner\" and she laughs at me and orders another drink. and i said cool. so finally we decide to leave and as we stumble outside we are blinded by the sunlight and all the way home we just kept wondering how we got so drunk so early and I was about to explain to them the process by which alcohol enters our digestive system and then to the blood stream and in the process reveal the cure for cancer, but i thought that it'd be better to just suggest gettin a burrito on the way. \u00a0  all in all we had an awesome time, nextime maybe i will pace myself better so i can make it past happy hour.",

Yes, yes, I graduated from UCSB, so this was a big problem for most of my hard party nights, but I still managed to out-beer most of my peers. Heh.

Now that we've gotten that out of they way, and only one person is left reading my review (Hi Mom!), we can get into the greatness that is Bar 821.   I went to Bar 821 on my birthday before a concert at The Independent. I had been craving a good pitcher of sangria, and what do ya know? I found one here. The sangria was awesome, it had a hint of what could only be described as \"christmas spirit\" (cinnamon), and was the perfect color. Sangria should not look like hot cheetos, guys.   Sufficiently buzzed, I continued to order off Bar 821's awesomely afforable menu ($3.50 -$7.00). Champagne cocktails are my new best friend. Try them all, but definitely try the one with fresh lemon juice (the name escapes me, but I got her number).

Sometimes hipsters, mainly skateboarding graffiti artists. \u00a0A lot of couples come here too. They have a super sweet happy hour deal until 7 which is $3.00 champagne cocktails and beer. I personally love the sparkling ginger. The sad thing is, I order it so much that I don't even need to tell the bartender anymore. He basically just starts pouring it when I sit down. I hate that I'm so predictable.",

Seemingly plucked from the streets of Amsterdam, dropped on Divisadero, and populated with a smattering of neighborhood denizens, heterosexuals and the people who love them, Bar 821, my friends, IS that bar.  You'll find a great line-up of beers and bubbly champagne cocktails here.  There's also a chill, discreet, almost DL vibe, and if you know me, you KNOW I'm all about the DL thing. \u00a0Until, that is, I get a call from his wife accusing me of being an ankle-grabbing homewrecker because she hacked into his email and found all our sordid correspondence, thus forcing me to call him and say \"LOOK BITCH, you betta choose between wifey and your 2.5 kids or my exotically starved body,\" OF COURSE he chooses ME, all is wonderful for a few months until he asks me to undergo a sex change operation, so I use some ruse like \"Let's visit the Sears Tower in Chicago, sweetie\" in order to drag the motherfucker on Jerry Springer where I call him out and he throws chairs and punches Steve the security guard in the face and tells the audience \"Y'all don't know me, suck my *BLEEP!*\"  Something like that.  ANYWAYZZZZZZ, I had a wonderful time here celebrating the birthday of the sexy Sassy S. \u00a0The fabulous dotRachel was there of course, along with Quinn S, Jenniflynn, Bucky K, Lauren S, and AKA G. \u00a0I also invited myself to lesbian night at Mecca since I STAND STRONG with my Sisters in the never-ending struggle to do what we want with our VERY LARGE SEX ORGANS. \u00a0Unfortunately, I didn't stay long enough for cake or porn consumption, but I heard both activities were very filling.  But WHO IS THIS CHEWIE G people keep mentioning? Was he there? Do I know him? Most importantly, DOES HE HAVE A YELP PROFILE?!? 'Cause you bitches KNOW I don't associate with anyone who isn't on yelp -- fucking PLEBES!!!!  Okay, okay, I'm joking. Chewie is a really great guy: cool, sweet, and charming. He told me he used to have moobs, though now they're morphing into meaty, muscular pecs that I wanted to massage with Crisco. \u00a0Yeah, he's THAT sexy. \u00a0For a terrorist.",

For once I was actually sober before I hit the bar, but that would all change in minutes to come. Definitely a very intimate kinda place but although small did not seem to get overly crowded. The bartenders had good suggestions and I was all for trying out new and exotic drinks. That said we tried everything from wine to shots to those fruit infused cocktails. The portions were small but very potent. Out of the numerous bars in san francisco this place is almost a hidden gem....that is until it was first reviewed on yelp.",

The only reason I go there now is for the champagne cocktails, and that's it. I love the variety and the price. Their beer and wine selection is a bit lacking for me but again prices are reasonable. It doesn't stay open as late as other bars, so get there at a reasonable hour (It closes at 11). It is definitely more crowded on the weekends.   Overall it is a chill place where you can hang out, have a drink, and hear the person talking across from you.",

You wanna be where everybody knows your name.  You wanna go where people know, people are all the same, You wanna go where everybody knows your name.  OK....so maybe not my name. \u00a0Met up with a fellow yelper and they might have well been singing this song. \u00a0He knew everyone! \u00a0 I don't know if the personalities in this bar would have been able to rock it out like Sam and Woody, but this place for sure has character, personality, comfort and a cool quality where you hope they eventually do learn your name. Great happy hour prices, and it closes at 11 on weeknights. \u00a0That's a great way to prevent the 2am evening when you have to wake up for work the following day. \u00a0Last call...10:50, perfect. \u00a0 I don't see this being a weekend destination for me, Ill probably hang onto it for beer filled afternoons. \u00a0I have lived up the street from this bar for 2 years now, and stepped foot into it for the first time yesterday! I couldn't believe it! \u00a0They welcomed me and my pooch and i can see this definitely becoming a regular thing. \u00a0Take dog for walk. \u00a0Stop in bar with dog. \u00a0Have a few beers. \u00a0Make rest of walk that much more entertaining. \u00a0Thanks for being there 821! \u00a0Sorry I haven't gotten to know ya sooner!",
