The Best japanese dining experience I've ever had! My wife and I tried the omikaze. (whatever the chef has in mind for you. ) and wow what an amazing mouthwatering experience. Make reservations because this place is only open for 4 hours a night and only sits about 12. A very very special experience! Thank you Kappa , we will be back",

I heard about it from my friend \"above the Denny's in Japantown.\" \u00a0you go above the denny's and you see a karaoke place and a small sign next to closed wooden door. If you read Chinese, it says \"small eats\" (or so tells me my friend) if you read hiragana the sign says \"kappa\"  so, we knocked on the door. We asked if they were open b/c of the closed door. The waitress said yes \"but we don't serve sushi.\" \u00a0I thought to myself good b/c I don't do raw. When we said can we come in. The waitress again said we don't serve sushi. i said fine. Then she brought the menu to make sure we were ok.  It is high-end japanese tapas or food to go with drinking. they serve sashimi but not sushi.  divine fatty pork, divine everything. very pricey. very small, only seats like 7 at the bar, and 1 room of 4 people...  reserve in advance or risk being turned away. or perhaps just try dropping in...  there is just the chef and the waitress. perfect service.",

Everything else in the entire Kappa experience is just like the restaurant itself - the minimalist menu is devoid of glossy colorful pictures (and, sometimes, English translation), each dish (no sushi!) is beautifully presented sans fancy garnishment, and service is excellent yet not overbearing. \u00a0  Intimate and personable, this must've been what it feels like to stop by an old aunt (whose culinary skill is out of this world)'s house for a homemade dinner. \u00a0  Without the annoying inquisitive aunt hovering about in the background, of course.",

    "review_text": "Not sure how to start this review, so I'll leave it up to you; here are 3 options:  1.) Saved about $1400 on two tickets to Japan last night! Instead, I walked there!  2.) This is why we live in SF, why we deal with the outrageous costs and the damn parking tickets. It's because of places like this!  3.) Someone once told me, the first thing you should eat in a Japanese restaurant is the tamago, and the quality of the tamago would dictate the rest of the evening. The Japanese \u00a0group next to me did just that. In fact, the chef had a big block of tomago on the counter that looked and tasted outstanding. Judging by the look on their (and our) faces, it was going to be a great evening.  Now here's the rest: We were the only 'foreigners' in the place. Everyone else spoke Japanese. And we were the only ones doing the Omokase. Although I can't afford this place on a weekly basis, I feel blessed we were able to experience it. Next time, I'm ordering off the menu. But, if it's your first time, I don't suggest you do the same. Get the omokase. Enjoy. (and the flight home won't be bumpy (or long.))",

We were the only ones there at 6pm, and yes, lets just say it. it was AWKWARD! felt like we had to whisper, and although they were nice, just staring at us every second didn't make me that comfortable =/  we did the omakase, and had her suggest us a sake, i preferred something sweet and she got us just that. not too sweet but perfect.  new years soup- very refreshing, light, the mochi was chewy, mushroom was tasty crab in vinegar- perfect balance tuna in a wasabi miso sauce with wakame and scallions- the sauce was a good balance b/c the wasabi was just spicy enough to hit your nose but not too overwhelming. although my bf said thats how mustard is suppose to be but i don't really know. the platter of everything- tamago (more egg-y than sweet), fish cake (yum i love fish cake in general), duck breast, salmon, conch shell? (chewy, never had it before), \u00a0asparagus in sesame paste, shrimp, corn fritter, eggplant, tonkatsu, and one more fish, and new years beans as they said. all very delightful, one easy bite, full of flavor! the sashimi...hamachi, tuna, amber jack and halibut? was so buttery and the texture was really nice. except i think i wasn't fond of amberjack...too crunchy? chewy? yea... nigiri!! \u00a0i usually dont like raw scallops but this lil guy was yummy! and right off the shell. seared toro? im guessing from pics on yelp, but it tasted like a salmon lox? the unagiiiii, my bf's chef said it would and should melt in your mouth. it totally did. every bite was savored. DROOL then the dessert- mochi, persimmon ( i like persimmons), pear, and persimmon jello, apple sauce texture. then a strawberry, raspberry, and peach sorbet.   overall definitely an experience, if you have the money to spend. it did get less awkward as the courses trickled in and another couple joined us. the wife was very hospitable and I wish I could have used my japanese language skills on her. lol   were we full? content but not stuffed which is how it should be. we did try to take our time eating..lol since we didn't want to look like fat pigs and gobble everything up. ponder and think about the flavors, yes look smart, yes  now we're excited to try other omakases! for special occasions of course. oh and my bf got a small gift b/c it was his bday. arigatou!",

    "review_text": "Wow, Kappa was a disappointment. For a 4.5 star rated restaurant, I was expecting a lot more.  We ordered the omakase for $85 each. Overall it was a big let down.   Started with 2 sashimi size pieces of soy sauce/shiso marinated marinated tuna with scallions. Ok, tasted fine, but hardly unique. I can get that at any sushi bar.  Next was an interesting bowl of fish gelatin, fish eggs, fish, and okra. It was ok.  Then we had a plate of sashimi and other bite size foods. BBQ unagi, sardine nigiri, duck breast. I think there was nine pieces of stuff. Not that tasty, nor original, except for the single slice of duck breast.  Next was a bowl with 6 pieces of sashimi. 2 tuna, 1 yellowtail, 1 halibut, 1 mackeral, and some uni. Didn't taste fresh, and I hate mackeral.  Then a small plate with a shrimp ball, corn fritter, and grilled miso-marinated seabass. I felt like I could have gotten the shrimp ball from a street vendor for $1. The corn fritter was very salty. The seabass was a charred mess. I sent it back.   Finally we had a soup dish with an egg custard square, some fresh fruit, and green tea ice crea.  In total, with tax , tip, and hot tea we were over $200.  Aside from the food, which was nothing special, the chef would prepare everyone's (as in, everyone in the restaurant) dishes at the same time. Therefore, if you weren't the first group finished with your plate, your next plate would be preplated and waiting next to the dirty dishes in the sink, cold, or over-cooked.  If you really want an authentic japanese restaurant like this, then go to Kiss. If you're looking for fresh fish on rice, go to your favorite sushi place and you'll leave much happier.",

I did not want to miss a chance to dine here. Luckily we got to Japantown about 25 minutes prior to the reservation, as it was very hidden. It's up a flight of stairs next to a bar. Small letters on the door say KAPPA.  We did the omakase, as suggested, and it did not disappoint. If I recall, there was sashimi, \u00a0a cold cucumber salad, a shrimp, some dumplings, a red bean desert, and a melon-y ice cream, just to name some of the items. All delicious, all different, all elegantly presented. It was quiet. There were 2 other couples dining when we were there at the counter area where you sit. A table in the back which accommodated about 4-5 people. And that's it. Looks like it holds about 10-12 people at a time, max. Very friendly couple running the place. It was more than eating.

(yeah, shes the successful one, im the kid in the parents basement one). since we were a large party for the place, 3 people!!!, they stuck us in a little room away from the counter. i was so lost. ive been around japanese food all my life, but pseudo japanese (big ups to nobu). kappa is the real deal japanese cuisine. i didnt know up from down here. \u00a0glancing over the menu, everyone had the look.  me : mmmmmm i dont know. i took japanese for two years but other than _______ ku dae sai, i dont know shit.... thank you public school education.  we went with the omakase..... like ive said many times, who knows their best dishes better than the staff?   mmmmmm basically, i LOVED everything. i really couldnt tell you what i had, what it was, but i can tell you what it wasnt.... it wasnt a rainbow catapillar sunshine out my ass roll with tonkastu sauce. every small dish came out and was greeted by us with oooo and ahhhhs... the simple elegant balance of each dish was wonderful. the gracious lady matched up some cold sake for us also. excellent.  for so many courses, we didnt get stuffed. more like a very pleasant full.   it felt like a mini vacation to japan. a very good experience. now would i frequent it often? probably not. though the food is VERY VERY good, i prefer a more lowbrow dining experience. im a lowly salary man so stick me in an izakaya..

I know that sometimes things happen and you get backed up and it's hard to catch up, so I'm generally pretty understanding of less than spectacular service, but every once in a while...  Our party dropped in to Kappa for a much deserved feast after a long day of park exploration. We let our server know how we would be splitting our check upon ordering in an attempt to alleviate any confusion. It was fairly busy when we got there, and slowly cleared as the the other guests finished their meals. The staff were running around in chaos. They only had one chef that day, and you could tell it was getting to them.   None of our orders came out together, \u00a0but it did get to us eventually and when we finally got our food, it was super bomb. The sushi chef made us a special roll, on the house, which was redeeming.  Even with our orders on separate tickets, it took our server 20 minutes to get us our bills (no really, we went out for a cigarette and then still waited) and a couple of the checks were incorrect.  Kudos to the Kappa chefs, the food was incredible. They just seem to need a little more organization up front.",

    "review_text": "4.5 stars for the food, rounded up to 5 stars for the ambiance and impeccable service.   As other's have mentioned, its location is somewhat hidden. For those who remember Denny's in J-Town, this restaurant is located on the top floor of the same building. Denny's is no longer there, but there is signage for Playground Karaoke in the same building; Kappa is located right next door to Playground Karaoke, with old signage on the door for a club that used to be there.  I was in love with this place the moment I stepped through the door. I felt like I was beamed to a small restaurant in Japan, far far away from San Francisco. \u00a0The main area has 10 bar seats; the restaurant also offers a private room that seats 4. \u00a0The Mrs. is super friendly (w/o being intrusive) and made us feel right at home. \u00a0  It was our first time at the restaurant so we opted for the omakase (which has to be ordered at min. one day in advance). Kappa's omakase is a 7-course meal (including dessert) and a fair amount of food. Ingredients used on all the dishes were fresh and the Chef Kimura's skills are solid. Unlike kaiseki cuisine that sports complex flavors and more intricate presentations, Kappa offers koryori cuisine where flavors were simple, elegant, and pleasant.  These were dishes in our omakase tonight, from upper left to lower right in photo: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7hw41z5sAO6XNLzbzNCg?select=IJB-mLcTT_XVewYiVSrZdg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7h\u2026</a>  1) Sake (ordered separately) 2) Tempura fish with lemon juice squeezed on the top, dipped in some fancy sea salt - loved this dish! 3) Crab in vinegar w/cucumber and sesame  4) Asparagus in sesame dressing 5) The main course with 13 items! Fried taro with dark miso, fried fish cake, squid + spicy code roe roll, duck (very flavorful!), egg yolk roll (with seafood on top), ankimo (monk fish liver), shrimp, tofu-mochi (very interesting in a good way), scallops, meatball, anago roll, yuzu radish (super refreshing), and baby octopus (probably my favorite on this plate) 6) Sashimi course: tuna, hamachi, smoked salmon, and halibut w/fresh wasabi 7) Grilled hamachi sushi, unagi sushi, and fried corn 8) Mango mousse 9) Left: Sakura mochi (one of the BEST mochi I have ever had!). Right: Mochi with red bean filling and soy bean powder on the outside  The damage came out to be around the same as Wakuriya in San Mateo so depending on whether you prefer kaiseki or koryori cuisine, you may want to splurge at one or the other. A meal at Wakuriya is generally slower-paced and takes 2-3 hours, whereas our meal at Kappa tonight took ~1.5 hours. \u00a0We came on the Monday evening after Mother's Day (probably extra quiet at most restaurants!) and there was only one other couple at the restaurant so it may be a little easier to get a reservation here at Kappa than Wakuriya (which also has limited seating). We'll be back!",

They are open from 6-9 p.m. and reservations are accepted after 4:30 p.m.  I would love to go back but I do not want to be served the same omakase that I saw on yelp that we were served that evening. I would hope that they would serve a seasonal omakase, so we'll wait 6 months to venture to this place again.",

We felt like we were transported back to Japan and some of the great little local restaurants we had eaten at. In completing our total surrender, we allowed the owner to match the food with several appropriate sakes throughout the meal service.  Ambiance is quiet and calm...you know, Zen like feel. They must be doing something right since they have been in business for almost 25 years now.  Well worth the price.",

Not the typical Japanese restaurant nor the typical Omakase.   The location was a bit hard to find but we end up finding it after going up and down on Post street.  We just came back from eating at Kappa. Starved, we ordered the Omakase and got served right away.  The dishes were very flavourful and tasty. Loved the fact that the chef took the time to introduce us to the various types of Japanese food (fried, raw, poached, grilled...etc). It was quite impressive.   The service was excellent. We enjoyed every bite of our Omakase. Personally, I don't think that the dishes they served us were for me (don't take me wrong, I loved the restaurant) but a lot of the dishes the chef served us were deep fried and kind of on the salty side.   After our last dish and before our first dessert, my husband and I asked for some uni. IT WAS DELICIOUS. The uni was sooooo fresh and the portion was very generous!",

    "review_text": "Sure, the place was tucked in a small dark corner of a place, and there wasn't any sign of restaurant around it, just a shut-tight dark sliding door, but there is a small sticker that says \"KAPPA\", which helps a little. Otherwise, the dishes crafted by the lovely husband and wife inside was worth to go hunting for! As you go up the stairs on the corner of Post and Buchanan, you'll find 2 doors. The left side has a neon sign that says \"Playground\". The left is an open glass door with \"Milo Lounge\" sign. Walk past the Milo door and standing right in front of you is Kappa's shut-tight door. Slide the door and you'll enter Japan.  When I said Japan, it really feels like you're not in San Francisco anymore. They specialized in Omakase, in which you're served a 7-course meal that includes very small, delicately prepared dishes. Each ingredient is carefully selected, making sure that they use the best graded ones in the market. Having to experience omakase for the very first time, it turned out to be an exquisite dinner. There was always an \"Mmmmm\" moment in every dish served.  So the 7 course breaks down to:  1. Clear soup with a snap pea, and halibut wrapped uni and a slice of yuzu peel. So subtle and delicate, it opens up your appetite and gets you ready for the following courses.  2. Goma-ae. Spinach and wakame smothered with a sesame-mustard paste, and paired it up with a piece of seared maguro block. This is intense, as the sweetness of the mustard and sesame rushed in, then calms back down as you savor the maguro.  3. Sunomono. A vibrant cucumber salad, so fresh and mouthwatering. Pairs it up with a chunk of king crab meat. (could be a dungeness or blue)  4. A fun combination platter that has 12 different things: -Boiled prawn -Unagi jello -Yolk sushi (so creative and yet so yum!) -Tonkatsu -Yakitori -Sweet corn fritter -Hamachi with ginger and soysauce -Adzuki konyaku -Asparagus with sesame paste -Herring roe -Duck breast with red miso -Grilled smoked salmon  5. Sashimi Moriawase (we were served the freshest uni, hamachi, maguro and halibut)  6. \u00a0A plate of Unagi (perhaps the BEST unagi ever!), baby scallop in its shell.  7. DESSERTS! There was icecream and home made adzuki mochi (wife made these), red bean jello, a slice of grapefruit and a slice of pear.  Everything goes well with sake! omg. I will totally come back!",

Wife and husband duo have clearing been doing this a long time and work very well together. Every part of your meal with be timed almost perfectly. No need to worry about anything while here.  Pricing is steep but for us was worth the splurge for the omakase experience.  As for food...Mo and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience. I have tried many things but I still was able to experience something new here at Kappa and maybe even a little out of my comfort zone. Something to be prepared for is that is NOT your typical run of the mill Japanese restaurant. Almost everything if not everything is prepared and produced by the owners. Thus the price. The style of cooking is very homey and all of the preparations are classic Japanese. If anything you are getting Japanese cuisine in its purest form. No fuss. No fancy foams or heaping plates full of food. SIMPLICITY is the theme and the key here. Food at its purest form with as little done or added to it as possible so that you are actually tasting the ingredients. If your not down for that Kappa is NOT the place for you.

IZAKAYA? \u00a0Nope. \u00a0Izakaya is characterized by a lively casual environment, more beer than sake, and often cheap. \u00a0In some cheap Izakaya, people order sake without caring about the brand, and eat food which is sometimes microwaved. \u00a0   KAISEKI? \u00a0Nope. \u00a0Go to places like Kaygetsu (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/4ok9qA8DJMCzOeqv25u0hQ\">yelp.com/biz/4ok9qA8DJMC\u2026</a>) or Kiku of Tokyo (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/MAA074Az23TmXMoufOPtOw\">yelp.com/biz/MAA074Az23T\u2026</a>) for Kaiseki style food (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FKaiseki&amp;s=24f556a26a3b18acb890e18c8be361424577921211e13717ee5ac01796a004ab\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka\u2026</a>). \u00a0For the most part, kaiseki involves lots of prep work, dishes that involve lots of handling. \u00a0Places like Kappa, or Tekka (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/BLcV0Z4nzKLkCjneKrTclA\">yelp.com/biz/BLcV0Z4nzKL\u2026</a>), operating in a wife and husband team, cannot serve complex dishes. \u00a0Kaiseki is often served in Ryoutei --- which is known for private rooms. \u00a0Many come in medium size groups, often for business dinner.  SUSHI? \u00a0Nope. NO SUSHI at Kappa. \u00a0Japanese visitors are often amazed by the amount of Japanese restaurants in the U.S. that serves sushi. \u00a0If you go to a town in Japan with 10 restaurants, only one would be a sushi restaurant. \u00a0Here, everyone makes sushi! \u00a0I really applaud Kappa for sticking to the roots/principles by not folding to the American customer demand. \u00a0I bet that if Kappa chef wanted to make sushi, he could make it better than 90% of the sushi chefs in San Francisco. \u00a0 \u00a0   So, do you still want to go there? \u00a0If so, continue reading.  HARD TO FIND: \u00a0I highly recommend making your first visit to Kappa with someone who has been there before. \u00a0Ever since reading Dan V.'s (<a href=\"http://danv.yelp.com/\">danv.yelp.com</a>) review explaining that it's on top of Denny's in J-Town, I was in a mad hunt to locate it, peeking into the Korean Bar, wondering if they are actually a Japanese restaurant. \u00a0After an extensive search, I finally found it. \u00a0They don't have any English sign on the entrance, so I needed to bravely open the wooden sliding door. \u00a0This does not mean they do not welcome non-Japanese customers. \u00a0In fact, they want all customers to enjoy their food...as long as they don't start demanding California Rolls.  SEATS: \u00a0They have about 8 counter seats and one table for three. \u00a0They do take reservations.  MENU: \u00a0They recommend Omakase (chef's choice) ($85) for first time visitors, which requires one day notice. \u00a0The menu is written on the wall behind the chef (in Japanese); they also have an English menu (see pictures). \u00a0 \u00a0  I had: Sashimi (hamachi, maguro, clam) Hirame with ankimo sauce ($15) Crab sunomono ($18) Tsukune ($8) Grilled Unagi ($15) White Pickled Turnup ($15) Grilled fish Aka-miso with clams Onigiri (rice balls) with salmon Tara Shirako (cod milt) Takenoko with miso (bamboo shoot) Grilled soramame (fava bean) Maguro yamakake Nanohana Oshitashi (celery cabbage) Karashi mentaiko  FOOD: \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0Owners are from Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan, known for good food. \u00a0Each dish is small, but the quality is top notch. \u00a0They try to avoid unnecessary seasoning, so most of their dishes were prepared with subtle flavoring. \u00a0Food really goes well with Sake. \u00a0They have about a dozen selections of sake, including Hakkai-san, Otoko-yama, Oni-koroshi, etc.  LAST WORDS: \u00a0 - Again, NO sushi. - Come alone, or with one other person. \u00a0Never in a group. - Don't come here to chow-out. \u00a0Stop by In-and-Out afterwards, if you are big eater. - Expect to spend about $60-100/person.",

    "review_text": "Kappa is not your typical Japanese restaurant. What makes it special is that it focuses on omakase, which means diners let the chef decide what he thinks is best in terms of the food that he would like to serve you that night. This is an excellent dining experience for people who are serious about Japanese food. Sometimes people only associate Japanese food with fancy rolls and tons of (unnecessary) dressing that is not representative of real Japanese food. Therefore, Kappa is a breath of fresh air that gives us a glimpse into real and authentic Japanese food.  Kappa is run by a husband-and-wife team. The husband is the chef and the wife helps out in serving. All the food is prepared by the husband so you will know that everything is handled with care, as they don't hire anyone else to help out at the restaurant. The restaurant seats no more than 10 people so be sure to make a reservation.  We had excellent food such as sea urchin and whitefish in clear soup, seared tuna, scallops, etc. Each item allowed us to savor and appreciate the main ingredient used for the course. I also had the best mochi dessert at Kappa. My husband loved the green tea cheesecake and he doesn't even like desserts usually.",

    "review_text": "I went to Kappa because of a recommendation from the master of Japanese food, Nobu K, and because I like very authentic Japanese food. \u00a0When we arrived there were other people looking for the entrance too. \u00a0It's kind of hidden with only the name printed in Japanese. \u00a0We eventually found it and walked into a very small place. They greet you with the standard \"Welcome\" Japanese greeting and promptly seated us at the bar. \u00a0The menu behind the bar (I think it's a menu ;) )is all in Japanese but they have one menu that's translated into English. \u00a0You can order off of the menu, or they will make you \"omakase\" which means that the chef picks it for you. \u00a0For this you have to order one day in advance.  They have one table and a sushi bar which sat about 8 people. \u00a0 The atmosphere is very Japanese and we were the only couple at the Sushi bar speaking English. \u00a0It really reminded me about my trip to Japan. \u00a0 They start with a piece of fish (think it was salmon) which was cooked in a small bowl. \u00a0Very tasty and cooked to perfection. We had the Hirame with salted seaweed. \u00a0This was amazing. \u00a0The seaweed and the sauce it had complimented the fish perfectly.  The next dish has a bit of a story behind it. \u00a0So, I thought that I'd order one of the specials which she said was \"fish roe\". \u00a0It sounded interesting and I like fish eggs.  When we get the dish, it looks like kind of small sacks. \u00a0It was really slimy in a sauce and some onions. \u00a0We tried it and it tasted good but the consistency was really strange. \u00a0We tried to also pick it up various times with our chopsticks in small pieces but it kept attaching itself to our chopsticks with these huge slimy sacks. \u00a0We asked her again what it was and she said \"you know the female fish, well this is the male\" Well, at that point we determined that we were eating fish \"sperm\" but we tried to not say anything between us so that way we can try getting it down. \u00a0It was really difficult and I didn't want to seem like we didn't like it, because that can be translated as an insult in Japan. Eventually, after about 4 dishes, she finally took it away and we mentioned that we were just \"full\". \u00a0Authentic, from what I have seen especially Japan, means eating all types of things that we are not accustomed to, and this one definitely was on the edge. \u00a0 Then we had: Japanese Bamboo with a spicy green Miso sauce \u00a0- Amazingly tasty and the sauce was perfect. \u00a0The bamboo was very juicy A few select pieces of sushi which the chef picked for us. \u00a0It was amazing and melted in our mouth's. \u00a0I usually never eat sashimi but this was VERY flavorful and tender. \u00a0Cut perfectly and not a bit of fat in it. Grilled Unagi --- Probaby the best Unagi I've ever had. \u00a0It was cooked to perfection right on the skin. \u00a0Very tasty and tender. We were pretty full, but they suggested we try some type of Beef stew. \u00a0The Beef was so tender and tasty and it came with some vegetables and potatoes. \u00a0Amazing and I couldn't believe how light it was. \u00a0When we ordered it we asked for a small order and he said \"no\". \u00a0He knew that we could stomach it down. She suggested that we try the Mochi for dessert. \u00a0It had red bean paste in it and at one point we bit into a strawberry. \u00a0It was amazing! \u00a0 We also had some amazing Daigingo Sake, I had 2 Soju's which she recommended and some Green tea which was very good.  This place isn't for everyone, especially if you don't have an open mind. \u00a0If you are a typical American which craves X mixed with X in some kind of roll this place isn't for you. \u00a0It was AMAZING and as soon as I get my next bonus check, I'll be running back. :)  No more fish sperm for me! \u00a0;) Update: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fmarc0047%2F300524889%2Fin%2Fset-72157594465282534%2F&amp;s=6cffd14fe4b8112568bd5ac5535e6a6fc5eba31014458c0749523ecf98c47ca4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">flickr.com/photos/marc00\u2026</a> So check this out, I found a photo of it on Flickr, it's called Shirako and it actually means \"white children\". \u00a0 It's a delicacy in Japan.",

I only wished I was a San Francisco resident that I could frequent Kappa more often and the chef can create more personalized dishes .Our hostess made excellent sake suggestions according to preference and was a very warm person to converse with.

The good:  As other yelpers pointed out, the sashimi was very fresh and they did serve with grated fresh wasabi which is a huge plus.

Course #1  Eggplant with dried bonito  This was a delicate dish. \u00a0The eggplant was tender without being mushy.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F4326jhb&amp;s=80c004a976f1bea44d5ba3e3715cdb21cecdf68c6df8d868a9643b31394b1d5d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tinyurl.com/4326jhb</a>  Course #2  Dungeness crab with vinegar sauce  This was very good. \u00a0The tartness of the vinegar sauce was such a great background for the sweetness of the dungeness crab.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F3up7vn7&amp;s=af4a0b96a57cb6fb7f984a2f373b30892cec6bd8a844e6f2b7f3098c20a93c55\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tinyurl.com/3up7vn7</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F3k7w7n2&amp;s=6565604179d20eceb2bbc41516ad7606d63a0d29aabe5dd52b70df63db740beb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tinyurl.com/3k7w7n2</a>  Course $3   Asparagus with sesame paste  This was a enjoyable dish. \u00a0There is a grittiness to sesame paste that I do not prefer. \u00a0However, with the asparagus it worked well.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F3zn2lut&amp;s=aece569a23d3578a5a2e32f551b1cae2a075f351f6e6e8cbfc7d6881873491c8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tinyurl.com/3zn2lut</a>  Course #4  Mixed Plate - I am going to try and remember what each item on the plate was. \u00a0Rock cod, duck, squid wrapped around some type of spicy seafood, a type of fish I do not remember, egg, pork roll, whole prawn, tofu, sweet corn fritter, chicken ball on stick, hamachi  This was a very eclectic plate. \u00a0For the most part, it was an excellent culinary experience. \u00a0The squid was a little tough. \u00a0The chicken had a very unique texture. \u00a0I am still not sure whether I enjoyed it or not. \u00a0The tofu was the first tofu I've ever eaten that I thoroughly enjoyed. \u00a0I would have preferred the duck to have been heated.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F3nopls2&amp;s=f4ec796579c33d31de8e066df91636a68f0308ec69738fa73a9ea0a0906a303e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tinyurl.com/3nopls2</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F3qat2xo&amp;s=d55b5b1e6056d6865d323bb7bc5c4fdd26a048c34f611ec3f98329373846ac10\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tinyurl.com/3qat2xo</a>  Course #5 - Sushi (hamachi, bluefin, yellow-jack) - I boycott bluefin tuna. \u00a0However, it looked amazing. \u00a0My friend does not boycott it so she was able to eat hers and mine. \u00a0The other sushi on this plate was very fresh and well cut. \u00a0  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F3zel3el&amp;s=32bfc372c5f194d7e2fce549d59aa20706f6a60e25d42507b8a25eee7b9e6ae4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tinyurl.com/3zel3el</a>  Course #6 - Sushi (toro, unagi, clam) - This was an amazing plate of sushi. \u00a0The toro had a nice touch of smokiness. \u00a0The unagi was simply perfect. \u00a0The clam combined with the fresh green was a excellent combination.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F43cylky&amp;s=b7ad48138b5c13a4b3f2827e922770e69fbf96fb4756814c983a191d5319bb8f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tinyurl.com/43cylky</a>  Course #7 - Dessert - This was a dessert trio plus a ice cream with cheesecake and mango. \u00a0One part of the trio was a mochi dessert. I do not really enjoy mochi. \u00a0The remainder was very much to my liking. \u00a0The cheesecake with ice cream and mango was a heavenly dessert. \u00a0It was so good that I forgot to take a photo.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F3twtc4h&amp;s=478cd97279abc90fbf1eeaab9a454fae7e216a1b16a219a801e30d8260ae6092\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tinyurl.com/3twtc4h</a>  Overall - The food was very good. \u00a0But what really brings this together is the intimacy of feeling as if you are truly being served a meal from very kind hosts. \u00a0It is a unique evening. \u00a0I will note though. \u00a0If you plan on taking a guest insure they are adventurous with cuisine. \u00a0We both are and, for us, another part of the experience is trying different dishes.",

Was the cat bus going to come and take me there?  So my friend is getting married and asked me to be groomsmen, so we can here to celebrate!  Kampai!  It just so happens that I have a tux from my Uncle's wedding, so I'm all set.  The service right off the bat was superb. The woman in the kimono was sweet, and the chef was kind and smiled often.  My only complaint was the private party of frat boys behind me who were swearing, drinking beer, and talking so loudly I could barely hear my friend.  Nothing against frat boys, I lived in a frat house during my undergrad, but these guys were jerks and made my meal unpleasant since I could barely hear how my friend got engaged. And swearing at the top of your lungs at a restaurant...man, these guys must have been raised by wolves. If I ever swore at dinner or otherwise, my mom would beat the you know what out of me.  Back to the meal, it was, well fun. We had a lot of small \"fun\" dishes like fried corn, crab sunomono, scallop salad, strawberry sorbet.  Each dish was bite sized, except for the nigiri, which had fresh salmon, uni, and unagi.  Is this place into fancy presentation? No.  Is it nice comfort food? Yes.  I felt like I was back in Japan for 2 hours. Laughing with my buddy, and saying over and over...congratulations!",

And the food. \u00a0We had omakase - eggplant with bonito flakes; crab meat with cucumbers and sesame seeds; asparagus with miso paste; a plate filled with single bites of monkfish liver, shrimp, tofu covered in some kind of crunchy rice, duck, chicken meatball, pork, and other seafoody things I can't remember; sashimi; and hamachi and unagi rolls. \u00a0Everything was delicious and fresh. \u00a0I don't even really like seafood, but the unagi and hamachi rolls were amazing - both melted in your mouth. \u00a0Dessert was two different kinds of mochi and ice cream with green tea mousse.  It is a little challenging to find . . . \u00a0the address is technically 1700 Post. \u00a0But if you walk off the street into 1700 Post, you'll find yourself in Dimples, some seedy bar. \u00a0Which I did. \u00a0You actually have to go around the corner from Dimples and up some stairs to get to Kappa.  Definitely expensive too. \u00a0But you're really paying for an experience, not just a meal. \u00a0And it's a 2.5 hour experience so be prepared for some sore legs at the end of it.",

The wife and husband have been open for 18 years at this little place, very tiny as everyone has mentioned, but I liked the feel. I did not feel claustrophobic whatsoever. Everyone is treated with a lot of attention and food arrives very quickly in a very delicate manner. No arrogant feel, the owners are very kind, welcoming, and warm - keeping a warm smile along with class.   Dishes are pricey but this place is the definition of Japanese fine dining. You will find a variety of cooked dishes as well as cold dishes and good sashimi (they go to the Hayward fish market just a side note).   I want to come here again for the omakase but point taken - it is pretty expensive here. Just a few dishes will easily make its tab up to a few hundred dollars or so. (or omakase = $85/person).  People who don't think this place is good are probably people who only dine at sushi places that serve rolls, nigiri and call the cooked food chicken/beef teriyaki. No sir, this place is not like that at all. Rather, dishes will consist of Japanese delicacies such as Simmered Sardine, Grilled Fish, Grilled Unagi, Sea Snail, Crab sunomono, etc.  Hits: you MUST get the GRILLED UNAGI! Very good",

The service was impeccable. We never felt rushed, she answered all of my detailed questions, and she made some wonderful recommendations for sake. The food was quite amazing. Kinda like a fusion between Kyoto kaiseki and the best Japanese eki-ben (train station bento). It was delicious. Every taste was unique and to be savored. We got the more expensive omakase and were glad that we did. My favorite dishes were the sweet corn tempura and the braised pumpkin in soy sauce. I must have spent 15 minutes slowly eating and savoring the sweet corn tempura.... sigh. They have an amazing sake selection, but it's by the carafe. We probably spent $125-$150 just on sake. Do yourself a favor and buy a very nice bottle to bring to the restaurant. The $20/bottle corkage fee is well worth it.",

    "review_text": "Loved my visit here at Kappa.   As a native Japanese, I expect a lot from those reputable Japanese restaurants in the Bay Area. Being in South Bay, we have access to many good Japanese restaurants that are considered to be pretty authentic. I live in South Bay for the Japanese communities, restaurants, grocery stores and other Japanese resources (including my job).  Because of that, I don't really know many good Japanese restaurants or do not expect to find anything as good in SF. Even my Japanese friends in SF admit they come to South Bay for better Japanese food.   After living in the bay area for 15+ years, this is the first time I've heard of this place. And I'm definitely glad I visited. Maybe some Japanese people wouldn't appreciate or consider this place as greatly as I do. But I definitely appreciated its quiet and authentic atmosphere, and of course the food.   You see those photos people have already posted, and what you see on the photos are pretty much what you get. Certain dishes may change depending on the seasons, but it will be pretty close to those photos. But they are all good. It gave me the nostalgic feeling eating some of their food as it reminded me of my mom's food. But at the same time, some of the dishes were so well prepared and beautiful that you know you could not get some of their food at home in Japan (and believe me, my mom is a very good cook). Just like Kaiseki food, you can tell the chef has spent a lot of time and effort making these dishes. The service his wife provides definitely complements his food. She's very attentive, polite yet pleasant. There was a customer who was sitting at the counter alone, and I thought the wife was being a great companion for him by having an enjoyable yet polite conversation. The chef is rather quiet, but when he speaks, he's also very nice. From the moment she greets you at the entrance, it feels like you're in a Koryouri restaurant in Japan.   Honestly, I did not think I could get such a quality and traditional Japanese food in SF Japantown where it has become a multi Asian cultural spot. Their food was delicious from the starter to dessert (even their green tea was great). As we leave, the wife walked us to the door and thanked us for the visit. You will not regret your visit here in any ways. The whole experience was so pleasant and we're already looking forward to coming back.   We originally tried to make a reservation at Kiss Seafood, but they never picked up the phone so were not able to make a reservation.  Well, I have to say now I'm glad they didn't pick up the phone because we were able to have such pleasant experience at Kappa instead.",

The place only holds about 10 (with the exception of a small room to the side) and we were the only two non-Japanese people there and the only people conversing in English. How fun!   The husband and wife couldn't have been a more beautiful/adorable couple (I kept saying to my bf 'How adorable is he????' He could only smile and totally agree). The woman was absolutely a sweetheart and made the truly authentic experience a bit less intimidating (I'm sure we were eating some things the wrong way?).   The sake she recommended was dee-lish, too.   Gosh, what a great night. They even gave me a small gift for my birthday. Absolutely so sweet.   We're already saying we want to go back...and now that we aren't total rookies, we might even try our luck at ordering off of the menu!",

    "review_text": "Big tip: you've read that they're upstairs from the Dennys in Japantown. However, you also need to know that the entrance is an unassuming sliding door which absolutely does not say \"OPEN,\" \"restaurant\", or even \"KAPPA\" (unless you can read the small unlit Japanese sign off to the side).   You *will* think you've walked up the wrong flight of stairs, or it's closed.  But then you open the sliding door, and the hostess comes to greet you, and you know you've found the place.  A real gem. The food is great and the hospitality and service are unmatched. I can't think of another restaurant in SF where I can have excellent food and feel relaxed. The menu is varied, with specials that change frequently. You either go for the prix fixe menu at $75/person or a la carte, with entrees around $15-$20.  The team that works behind the counter, I imagine they're husband and wife, are so in sync it's like watching a ballet as they prepare dishes in near silence. They're quite welcoming and will talk to you, ask you what you like, where you're from, what your family name is, and so on. It's unlike any restaurant I've been to in the US; I felt more like a guest of a family in Japan.  The restaurant is tiny - there's a sushi-style bar that seats 10, maybe, and at least one small private room that looks like it might seat 4 - 6.  As others have mentioned, Kappa does not serve sushi (and they're likely to tell you this as you enter, just to make sure you're not disappointed). They do have sashimi though and while I haven't tried it, I expect it is very good.  Five stars for the food, two stars for the warm hospitality and attentive service.",

For those who know where Japantown Denny's is, it's just right above, on the second floor, and look for a yellow lantern light there as many have indicated. The place is quite small. It seats around no more than 8 or 10 people, so I booked reservations around 2 hours advance before the place opens at 6pm.   Decided on the $85 Omakase (chef pre-selected dinner) beforehand too, which we had to request one day in advance (at least). We were greeted warmly by the husband wife owners/chefs. The Omakase came with around 9 small dishes. But the fish, veggies and asparagus were very fresh.. Each dishes were presented nicely and care. The chef and server also perfectly interacted with each of the customers. The standout dishes from what I remembered were the Shitake Broth, Maguro, Fish Liver and Strawberry Sorbet for dessert.   We spent around $220 for two people after tip given the effort the put to prep, present and serve the food and interact with customers.   Probably will come back in the very distant future. Certainly glad I came and it was a very pleasant and enjoyable experience. It reminds me of a typical small traditional mom pop restaurants in Japan.",

The owner/chef is truly a culinary artist and his wife/hostess is both charming and helpful. This is not a \"wolf down a California roll before a movie\" kind of meal. This is a time honored tradition of each taking time with every course, appreciating each bite, and relaxing before the next course. If you're not adventurous, move on.

    "review_text": "I've only been to Kappa once, and it was on September 7, 2003. Granted this info is old, but judging from the more recent reviews, this place has not lost its touch, identity, or reputation and quality.  The restaurant is a lot smaller than what it appears to be from their website. The interior was quite upscale, but the intimacy and atmosphere created by the husband and wife operation, in addition to top notch service, made the dining experience even more memorable.  Rumiko-san (wife of the chef who was our server) was a delight and very helpful in recommending dishes and translating some of the menu items on the wall. Tell her what category you are interested in and she can check with availability on the wall or ask her husband (the chef).  On with what was ordered (a mix of regular menu and special wall items):  1) Tamba Kuro-mame - This is a special black bean from Japan (supposedly the bean is named after a region, Tamba). Very large sized and apparently cooked over 2 days until the right texture is obtained. Then they are soaked in a mix of sake and presumably sugar (I was able to taste box sake and something really sweet). A wonderful appetizer/dessert/palate cleanser which had a delicate aftertaste. Rumiko-san was saying that this is a high end dish in Japan, typically served during special occassions (like New Year's). We liked the black beans so much we ordered two glasses!  2) Maguro sashimi - 5 nice pieces of good aka maguro. I didn't try anything else, but the maguro wasn't as good if you went to the better sushi-ya's in the bay area (Ino, Toshi's, Sakae's, Sawa's etc).   3) Thinly sliced yamaimo. I was expecting some sort of cooked yam but to our surprise it came out in delicate thin slices, served raw with some shredded nori on top. Rumiko recommended dipping some soy sauce with some of the fresh wasabi on the side. Tasted wonderful though it was a bit slimey on the side (that is how the raw yamaimo is...probably an aquired taste). Note: I'm sure I would enjoy this way more now.  4) Grilled chicken meatballs - 3 skewers, each with two meatballs. Very flavorful and I think there is more than just chicken in it! Served with a light brown sauce that complements the dish.  5) Grilled black pork (kurobota) - yakiniku style thinly sliced pork. VERY delicious, juicy, and tasty. Lots of finely chopped green onion (or chive...arguable as it was very thin) and some sesame seed.  6) Grilled Matsutake - This was quite a treat (but very expensive for 4 pieces...$20 for this dish alone!) It was dirty white looking but more so light brown after being cooked. My first time having matsutake.  7) A simmered vegetable dish (greens) in broth with tofu skin and some spices.  8) Miso soup - red miso with a touch of green onion and what appeared to be cilantro stems.  9) A very big piece of mentaiko onigiri, served with finely chopped greens (stems) and one yellow pickle.   I believe that was it. Everything was amazing, service was excellent (the chef came out and personally bowed to thank us when we left, and Rumiko-san walked us out of the door to greet us farewell), and a good feeling overall The meal was $110 after tips for two people, without drinks. I still remember that meal to this day, that's how wonderful the experience was.   I need to go back again, so that I can put this place and Nami Nami in Mountain View (if I ever get to go for dinner), into their right equivalent perspectives. Kappa has the edge of the more personable and intimate setting, while NN's decor is more upbeat and izakaya-esque.",

We had the Omakase. \u00a0The most memorable dish was the crab meat, juicy chunky crab meat stuffed into two tight sushi rolls, and more juicy chunky crab meat on the side. \u00a0Boyfriend said he has never liked crab as much as this. \u00a0 Some dishes I like the presentation more than the taste: the large plate with 9 different items on it. \u00a0Some meat were rather rubbery. \u00a0Maybe if they kept their portions smaller, it would have tasted better.   Overall, I felt the dishes weren't as delicate as Kiss Seafood and the environment not as pleasant. \u00a0But if someone wants to take me to Kappa, I'd definitely go again.",

The service was incredible - the most attentive and authentic I've experienced outside of Japan with none of the unpleasant behavior so common among the proprietors of Japanese restaurants in the city. We ordered Omakase (chef's choice) and had a number of great dishes. I thought too many of them were chilled and too much emphasis on various seafood dishes without enough rice or veggies to balance them. A few items actually didn't taste good. I'd still give Kappa another try. A beautiful, small, intimate, and unassuming small space.",

I would recommend to people who never have Japanese multiple course dinner before, but once is enough.",

    "review_text": "This entrance is upstairs right next to Playground karaoke and easy to miss.   GOOD: - Small, intimate setting. There are like 10-12 seats along the bar, and a table for 4 on the side. - The place is run by a husband/wife combo. The wife does all the serving and is very nice.  JUST OK: - The food is average to good but few of the dishes were exceptional. Most dishes are COOKED. This is NOT a sushi/sashimi omakase so keep that in mind if you are looking for raw seafood.   BAD: - I'm all for Japanese cooked food but this place is horrendously OVERPRICED and inefficient. There is only one cook/chef (the husband) and he makes all these little different dishes so of course, it is a very labor intensive process. If a recipe needs chopped onions or panko bread crumbs, it is going to be the husband doing all the chopping and toasting. So essentially, you are paying a premium for this one guy to do everything. And you don't need to be an expert to do prep work so don't kid yourself and think that your food is any better because the chef owner chopped your onions instead of some cheap labor. There is a reason why all restaurants in the city have immigrant workers in the back. - Because the chef/owner husband is doing all the food prep, he is too busy to converse with the clients. What is the point in having a personal chef if you can't chat with him? - Many of the dishes are simple and cheap in terms of ingredients. Asparagus in sesame paste? A piece of TAMAGO? A piece of FISH CAKE? PORK KATSU? Really? I'm not paying $85 for things I can make myself or that I can buy in a supermarket with the same quality. Even if these dishes are all made from scratch, they use cheap ingredients and do not involve expert skills to make. Yet, they still probably take hours to produce because as I said, there is only ONE person doing all the cooking and food prep.  CONCLUSION: Kappa is a TERRIBLE VALUE and not worth $85 at all. If this place was in NYC, this ridiculous pricing (for what you get) would not fly because there are other Koryori or Kaiseki places that use premium ingredients and make better dishes (no tamago!) for a similar price point or cheaper. Unfortunately, there are too many people in SF who don't know better or are willing to overpay so Kappa's rating is inaccurate and overinflated.",

    "review_text": "It's a tiny little place, but one of the most personal experiences I've had in San Francisco. The husband and wife owner are amazingly adept at handling the diners--she usually speaks to the English-speaking ones, and he defers to his Japanese clientele.   I came \u00a0here a few years ago and this restaurant single-handedly changed my entire opinion about eggplant. Now, I actually like, after having been served a snow white whole japanese eggplant (it had been peeled) with a lump of ginger and a little soy. The flesh was creamy and tasted ever so slightly of smoke. And the spareness of the ginger and soy was perfect.   It's price-y, so I hadn't been back until recently and was immediately reminded why the price is worth it. Tsukune--three skewers of tender, lightly spiced chicken meatballs are wonderful; as is the more \"upscale\" hiramo (halibut) with ankimo sauce--the monkfish liver has been blended to creaminess, almost like a cross between a creamy ceviche and vitello al tonnato, an Italian favorite of mine.  The woman never blinked an eye when we ordered spicy cod roe sac, served either seared, or as the Japanese eat them, just straight up. There's nothing like it--bitter, spicy, soft, chewy, all at once, and a warning--the texture is almost like raw sausage.  Sunonomo, a traditional Japanese cucumber salad that is lightly dressed in vinegar, came heavily dressed in freshly picked Dungeness crab. It was a big bowl, and that with the chicken meatballs may have been enough.  The only thing she gave us a sideways eye for ordering (and admittedly, we ordered it because it was not on the menu and we saw the Japanese pair next to us order it specially) was a raw squid tossed with pureed squid belly, sake, and shiso. It's kind of a murky purplish-grayish-brownish. Not recommended.  The sake collection can also not be missed. It's great--ask for a good suggestion, they will willingly guide you.  This is by far one of the best, most honest Japanese meals I've had in the city.",

Their Omakase costs $85.00 per person, this restaurant is probably the most expensive Japanese restaurant in Japantown and well worth it. \u00a0The couple there operating that restaurant is very friendly, old fashioned, and formal, and this restaurant is very calm and relaxing.  RESTAURANT RULES AT KAPPA:  1) Reservations are available either by email or by phone.  2) For Omakase (pre-fixed menu) must be requested AT LEAST 1 day in advance.  3) Same day reservations by PHONE ONLY (After 4:30 pm). NO EMAILS allowed.   MY SUGGESTIONS AT KAPPA  1) Reserve their Omakase. \u00a0It has lots of variety of primarily good quality fish and vegetables. \u00a0  2) To see an example of what their Omakase looks like go to: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kappa-japanese-restaurant-san-francisco?select=IJB-mLcTT_XVewYiVSrZdg#IJB-mLcTT_XVewYiVSrZdg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kapp\u2026</a>  3) Kappa is very hidden out. \u00a0To find it at the stairs on 1706 Post Street walk to the top of the stairs,   4) Walk through the left door that says Kappa  5) Look for this light when you walk in <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kappa-japanese-restaurant-san-francisco?select=IJB-mLcTT_XVewYiVSrZdg#fuAfb3xqYKjpLxJd97hXWw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kapp\u2026</a>  6) Below the light near the door handle you will see a small sign that says KAPPA.  7) Grab the loop ring looking door handle and slide it open.  8) You will hear some bells jingle and a Japanese woman wearing a Kimono will come over and great you.

    "review_text": "Some people may say that Japanese food is bland in comparison to other Asian countries' food. Chinese food is heavy with exotic sauces, Korean food is spicy with fragrant flavors of garlic, soy and sesame, Thai food has different layers and intensity of spicy, sweet, and savory, etc. But actually, Japanese cuisine has delicate and subtle flavors and overpowering sauces or strong flavors are usually avoided so that you can appreciate the natural flavors of the food.   Kappa is just that. They hold true to drawing out and enhancing the natural flavors of the food you are eating. The entire meal was light , in small portions, and covered 7 courses. However, it was very filling. Presentation was very artful and I was amazed how talented the chef is at creating all of these delicate and subtle flavors in your mouth.   Course 1 - Shrimp Soup. A broth of shirmp stock, with snowpea, shrimp ball tempura and a touch of lemon zest. I found the lemon twist added a subtle taste in the background.  Course 2 - Fish tempura. 2 pieces of small fish, butterflied, lightly battered and deep fried tempura style. Just squeeze a bit of lemon and a bit of salt for a perfect balance.  Course 3 - Seared tuna with sweet miso sauce. This was raw tuna sashimi, lightly seared and topped with miso served with a shiso leaf.   Course 4 - Sashimi platter. 4 pieces of thickly sliced maguro (tuna), hamachi (yellowtail), tai (bream) and 1 more that I couldn't figure out, ,maybe seabass? They were all very fresh and delicious.   Course 5 - Platter of grilled shrimp, corn croquette, tonkatsu, chicken meatball, slowcooked tuna simmered in soysauce and spice, baked fish, duck with red miso, stingray, tamago egg, spicy fish roe wrapped in calamari. Everything was so good but I wasn't too crazy about the spicy fish eggs and calamari though. It was a bit salty. But everything else was impeccable.  Course 6 - Sushi course of grilled hamachi, unagi, and a baby scallop on the half shell with ume plum sauce. The unagi was fresh! Definetely not the type you find ready made in the frozen section of the asian grocer.  Course 7 - Dessert. Watermelon gelatin - A perfect intermezzo to cleanse the palate. Sliced papaya, pear, &amp; persimmon. I usually hate persimmons but this one was very sweet. I couldn't believe it! Green tea cheese cake and mochi (rice dumpling with sweet bean jam) dusted with kinako (dried savory soy powder). \u00a0The mochi was so soft and delicious. A perfect ending.   Service is wonderful. The waitress is so humble and courteous and very attentive.   I think a second visit is in order.",

We left at almost 9 and the entire evening there were only 3 couples. \u00a0I had a chance to study this place a little bit more. \u00a0Everything Kappa prepare and deliver are excellent, they are all carefully prepare, cook or raw, cut, arrange, etc. \u00a0It's all very careful. \u00a0So you won't eat anything rotten or bad here ! \u00a0Dishes are not too complicated as you can guess, everything was done by 1 guy. \u00a0For dishes that are complicated, it is usually done or partially ahead and then reheat or finish or just cut. \u00a0I ask the Mrs how's business and she said ups and downs, ok. \u00a0 As a previous restaurant owner, I learn food inventory is one of the hardest thing to deal with if the restaurant has unpredictable volume. \u00a0So I observe the raw fish display and confirm my theory. \u00a0They dont stock a lot of fishes and they don't stock very exotic fishes. \u00a0So they stock some tuna, yellow tail, founder. \u00a0I didn't see any of my favorite such as aji, toro, nama tako, ika, awabi, no raw shirmp, no mirugai this time either. \u00a0 By not stocking a lot of expensive seafood, it helps manage the food cost. \u00a0Duck breast, grill cod, those can stay for a week ! \u00a0 Our a la cart dinner still comes to $160 for 2, expensive. \u00a0But I like the services, I like the conversation, I like the envrionment, I like the consistency of their deliverables. \u00a0Will I go back ? Sure, I came back, but just not gong to be too often, may be after Blue Angel 2009. \u00a0I like more variaties of fresh and exotic seafoods.",

    "review_text": "I have many pet peeves.   From punctuality to talking during a movie to long pinky finger nails to eagle claws aka crusty toes hanging on for dear life from the edge of a sandal (get a pedi and a bigger shoe size please!), one of my main pet peeves is how people treat wait staff. I believe the way a person treats a waiter(ess) reveals a lot about a person's character.   I'm not one to put people on blast but in this case I will.   Thank you, Scott Disick doppelg\u00e4nger for ruining our dining experience at Kappa by loudly and obnoxiously boasting about your Harvard education, about your $150k minimum salary requirement as a recent college grad, and your customized Ferrari. He probably thought my gf and I \u00a0would be impressed overhearing all of his self-gloating (it's very small and quiet at Kappa) but we weren't. It was annoying and he disrupted our entire meal. You're a douche and an even bigger douche for talking to Toshiaki-san's wife in such an arrogant and condescending tone during your interactions with her. \u00a0Not cool.  Now that I got that out of the way, Kappa is a neighborhood gem tucked inside the entryway of Milo Lounge (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FUTks5y&amp;s=2e5fa7212a46b1ae2b2d40d47510d7c492492889c7b3fdce03fae9baaa595078\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/UTks5y</a>), next door to Playground (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FTeatEU&amp;s=d3d05af4aa13dc329d479a7c88a4f4fa5ff8b3f2fee12b6135f5856fc5351a77\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/TeatEU</a>). With just 12 seats, Kappa serves Koryori, a Kyoto version of Kaiseki. It's like a Japanese Chef's Tasting menu that's very simply prepared with minimal garnishes so the main ingredient is the focal point and you can enjoy it in its purest form. Though they have a la carte menu at Kappa, the only way to go is with the 7-Course Omakase for $85. Expect to spend about 2 hours for a very well-paced dinner.  Spectacular from start to finish, my dining experience at Kappa (sans douchebag) was most reminiscent to the Michelin-starred Wakuriya in San Mateo (my review: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FTOhWXw&amp;s=29d4b2acf04ba50df7d1222c9dc7845a30dd9cc874aae94a70f6372748f8bba4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/TOhWXw</a>) and Kiss Seafood nearby (my review: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FTOi7Sy&amp;s=53973ad8b0ced788c07dc446d3a6ffb42f1dadd3d3c5f504984ddfc867c8e144\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/TOi7Sy</a>) but with a lot more LOVE.   Toshiaki-san and his wifey are the cutest and sweetest Japanese couple ever. While he works his culinary magic, his wifey runs the front of the house. They were very warm, hospitable, and attentive. It's truly a one of a kind experience so make reservations, take a seat and be prepared to take a culinary trip for your taste buds to Kyoto and back in 2 hours.   7-COURSE OMAKASE DINNER ($85) (1) Fishcake w/ Sea Urchin Soup: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FUGnkNh&amp;s=f5c3f8b8eea125f522724aaeb342fbb9c51f72d0f82b5b3ba51d49e761389b78\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/UGnkNh</a> (2) Rare-cooked Tuna w/ Japanese Mustard &amp; Scallion: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FT9MGUg&amp;s=480e4d44c75d1bf98b39e2675e0ea974387c967e6fb012fc92d8fc9eadbccb9d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/T9MGUg</a> (3) \u00a0Snow Crab w/ Cucumber in a Vinegar Broth: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FT1FQjx&amp;s=e780429dae32bfe9081b9ca2b3eb0d7844a13b8d058e203b30cdf18d13653aad\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/T1FQjx</a> (4) \u00a0Variety Plate: Tsukune, Satsumaage, Blackskin Pork, Turnip, Black Cod, Tonkatsu, etc.: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F10nwvHE&amp;s=235aff19c2e680ae91a1f4bfe98377d0db2dd1ad283b45c50a8ade9a9e1b4f6c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/10nwvHE</a> (5) Sashimi - Hamachi, Uni, Chu Toro &amp; Amberjack: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FWiiPd1&amp;s=d4b1c69c53690afdccd6b55a2c76cd805a6481a294356a5528a99b19352c2608\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/WiiPd1</a> (6) Nigiri - Baby Scallop, Unagi &amp; Seared Toro: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F10nwQtZ&amp;s=ed160b6d1c0f885f1e55fd6a9f3f65c96d6d624de85a6eec17090a1d05cb571f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/10nwQtZ</a> (7) Mango Sorbet, Sweet Rice Cake, Melon, Persimmon &amp; \u00a0Red Bean Jello: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FXxDU9H&amp;s=f8852e2d77e09cb930b6863e7afe4d61bf0e6bb28f6c0da25fc16a9bcb2bce37\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/XxDU9H</a>  If you appreciate top-notch seasonal ingredients with subtle flavors and delicate textures, you will thoroughly enjoy every course at Kappa. The soul-warming soup led way to the tenderly soft tuna with a nose tingle from the mustard. The succulently sweet snow crab prepared our appetite for the abundant variety plate of 12 items ranging from the supple fishcake, richly flaky black cod, deliciously crunchy tonkatsu to the succulent chicken meatball. There's nothing like fresh fish in its unadulterated form and Toshiaki-san truly knows how to showcase this in the sashimi and nigri courses. The sashimi was ultra-silky and buttery while the slightly torched nigiri created a mouth-watering decadent mouth feel. The delicious simplicity of ripe, seasonal fruits was displayed in the fruit centered dessert closer course.   Kappa is definitely a must for all foodies who can appreciate culinary greatness in its simplistic form.   Going back to the Scott Disick doppelg\u00e4nger, you know I couldn't leave without some parting words.  You know what they say about people who brag about themselves and all their materialistic possessions... they're just compensating for something or a lack of \"something\".  *Whispers*: Lipstick D*ck.",

The husband and wife couple are a dream team, friendly, polite, and on their a-game when it comes to service.  We had the 8-course omakase style. \u00a0The dishes were interesting and fresh, although most of them left much to be desired in my opinion. \u00a0I enjoyed the sushi the most - smoked salmon, unagi, and scallop, yum!

    "review_text": "I took my date here for Valentine's Day. And it was pretty damn good. It was delicate, refined and exceeded my every expectation. So the run down is that I made like four reservations at different Japanese Restaurants because well Japanese places don't open on Mondays. I had a hole in the wall that my friend highly recommended lined up only because the top places were booked; Kappa being one of them. But about 1 hour before I picked up my date, Kappa called me and said they had a cancellation. THAT\"S GREAT SERVICE. And being Valentine's Day, I wanted didn't want to have turf and surf as cliched as that is. If I'm going to the city, then I'm going to be eating sashimi.   This place delivers. The food was so good that I had to google adjectives just to describe it and even then I'm still doing a piss poor job. For one thing, my date spoke fluent Japanese and the fact that the owners, mom and pop, could speak fluently back to her. This instantly raises the bar. Sorry Koreans and Chinese run establishments.   Secondly, prefixed omakase menu was man alive. That's the only way to describe it. My date and I were full by the 4th course. I think we had 8 courses? Everything was so delicious. I can't put a finger on which was the best. To be more frank, I don't think I have the culinary expertise to describe the experience I had at this restaurant. I was very impressed. Presentation was simple, elegant, and creative. I especially loved the squid and roe.   The only negative if any is that if you're going to bring your A game and treat that special someone to this meal: be ready to fork over a few doubloons.",

Kappa is not a place for people who define Japanese food as sushi rolls with names like \"Dynamite,\" \"49ers\" or \"Rainbow.\" It's where you go when you want authentic Japanese cuisine.   The first sign is the lack of English menu. The second sign is that you're the only non-Japanese businessmen in the joint. The final and most important sign? The perfectly exquisite morsels of food served to you.   Everything here is made to perfection, very Japanese. Just ask for the chef's menu and they'll take good care of you. They'll probably ask, but let them know if there are any foods you have an aversion to (i.e. monkfish liver, etc.). If I could find myself a Japanese sugardaddy, I'd have him take me here at least once a week.  The only downside? You'll probably be hungry in an hour or so, so you might want to head over to Sophie's for a Japantown Crepe to fill you up afterward.",

    "review_text": "One night, my friend and I decided to finally try dinner at Kappa, a wonderful gem of a restaurant tucked away in a hidden corner of San Francisco's Japantown. Locating the restaurant for the first time was slightly challenging. We went up a flight of stairs from the J-town Denny's, peered skeptically into a Korean karaoke lounge, and finally found the entrance behind a sliding wooden door next to the lounge. The only indication of the restaurant's existence was a small sign with the words \"Kappa\" inscribed in neat hiragana.  Yet aside from the odd location, this was one of the best meals I've had outside of Japan. Once I stepped inside, I was instantly transported back to the small, intimate restaurants in Japan, where salarymen drink and eat in between hearty laughter after work hours. The restaurant can only fit about ten seats at the bar, so the dining experience allows you to converse with both the chef and his wife, who served customers while wearing a full kimono (which is very commendable since it's hard to even walk in kimono without looking like a penguin). I almost forgot that I was in the States.  As for the food, let me begin my review with some words of caution. Not everyone will appreciate the food at Kappa. The restaurant serves food in the koryori style, which is harder to find outside of Japan. Small, stand-alone dishes are presented with minimal garnish and seasoning, in an effort to highlight the original flavors of the ingredients. There is no standard menu, as the availability of items varies with the freshness of the ingredients. The result is a sensual, refined dining experience that allows you to enjoy the flavors, scents, and textures of some of the most traditional Japanese cuisine.  If you're looking for California rolls, contemporary fusion fare, gyoza, and teriyaki bento boxes, do not step foot into Kappa. And take your gaijin t-shirt with you. Kappa doesn't even serve sushi, although I'm sure the chef would do an amazing job if he wanted to.  For newbies, the best thing to order is probably the omakase pre-fixe menu. For $85 per person, the chef will select a variety of dishes to introduce you to koryori dining. My friend and I were fairly confident about what we wanted though, so we just ordered a la carte.  - Sashimi: Each slice was thick, juicy, melt-in-your-mouth perfection. Wasabi and shoyu were completely unnecessary. The uni was especially amazing. - Ankimo: Creamy and velvety, served with ponzu sauce.  - Hirame Usuzukuri: Thinly sliced halibut sashimi dipped in a mixture of shoyu, thinly sliced green onions, and spicy daikon. Great play on textures. - Grilled red snapper: Best dish of the meal. Reminiscent of hamachi kama, but the meat was thicker and sweeter. - Blackskin Pork: Thick and fried in batter without too much excess oil. - Anmitsu (agar jelly served with sweet bean paste)   With the limited seating, reservations are a must. The portions are small, so don't show up starving. And the prices can add up to a hefty total, but if you're a fan of traditional Japanese fare, it's well worth it to visit once in awhile.

So, suddenly, he had no place to stay in Paris. And he didn't have enough budget for motel. Even he got a round-trip to Paris and NY for 320.  So his spring break plan was screwed. But, he remember that my gf has friends living in Paris, so that he was thinkin' hoping that it's OK to stay their house.  \"Dad, could you ask your gf?........ Please.....\" ....................  So he went to Paris for 10 days and told me that he had a blast.  Great. Life is too short. I am really glad he had a good time in Paris.  2 weeks after, I got a call from my gf.

I've never met them but I was so sure Kappa is it. I didn't even hesitate but my gf was really nervous. She wanted the best in the city. \"Nobu, you don't know who you'll dealing with. It's like... Jason Bourne. They are really hard-core for food.\"  So, I took her Kappa, for her 1st time 2 weeks ago for a small dinner as a tryout, and she said, \"WOW!\"  So I made a reservation for the French couple.  So, we took the French couple to Kappa last night. 4 of us. Omakase, $85 each 1. Goma-ae, small appetizer of asparagus mixed with grind-sesame seeds and miso paste. 2. Sunomono, crab and cucumber with Pon-zu. 3. Tsukune no Osumashi, Chicken meat ball with soup. 4. Combo plate, 8\"x10\" dish with 8 small great things! See photo. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7hw41z5sAO6XNLzbzNCg?select=kn0lMZrj-tAlKIn6LgkMbg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7h\u2026</a>  5. Sashimi plate. 1 slice of Hamachi, 2 of Aka-Maguro, 1 of Kanpachi and 1 Hirame. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7hw41z5sAO6XNLzbzNCg?select=LRjo4fWcibWOykd7GeC1pg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7h\u2026</a>  6. Combo plate of Unagi, Chicken katsu and panko fried corn. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7hw41z5sAO6XNLzbzNCg?select=Be9KqsSrqJkMckGxKRg46A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7h\u2026</a>  7. dessert, Ohagi=small sweet rice ball with sweet blackbean paste over. 8. dessert, small vanilla ice cream with Kinako=soy bean powder+sweet black bean sauce.  with great high quality green tea. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7hw41z5sAO6XNLzbzNCg?select=Gz0X8W6-C0fz4df8ASrmmA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7h\u2026</a>  4 decanter of Toranoko, Dai-Ginjo, from Yamagata prefecture. $25 each.  Great presentation of serving with Great traditional manner. And they have such a nice, cute, colorful quality dinner plates. Every single moment was awesome, authentic Japanese.  The 8 items above were all very small size but we were all full after the 5th plate. It wasn't exactly the same as the pictures but close enough.  One comment from the French couple. \"WOW!!!\"  We got there at 7 pm. We stayed there after 9 pm. It was great. I felt a great comfort in Kappa. We had a blast.  I was just thinking ... if we had a similar dinner in Japan, I think, they'll charge us more for it.",

There were parts that were the best I've ever had -- the scallops and yellow tail in particular. \u00a0The soup was excellent and all the presentation was beautiful. \u00a0The atmosphere was not relaxed, but in a way it made you focus on your food more. \u00a0It was delicate and I felt a lot more aware of my manners and etiquette.  I did pull out my cell phone to take pictures (I felt it to be a necessary faux pas fusion of modern and traditional culture!) but I will say the other diners in the restaurant kept having their phone going off -- it was on vibrate and while that generally wouldn't phase me, irritated me.  They are very attentive here and that may not be something everyone is interested in -- as soon as your glass is empty or food is finished you'll be served appropriately. \u00a0Some of the food was mediocre and forgettable, but even that was eaten with great appreciation. \u00a0There were some pieces that were amazing, but hard for me to justify going back for just a taste.  Over all, I loved the experience, but do not feel like I'd need to rush back. \u00a0It's like when you travel, there are places you're happy to visited, places you'd like to explore again, and places that you want to straight up move to -- this was the first of the 3. \u00a0  on the other hand, if I was invited to go back for a free meal, I'd drop everything =)",

FYI, they DO NOT SERVE SUSHI!! so get the fuck out of here with your i-love-big-ass-sushi-that-cant-even-fit-in-my-\u00admouth bullshit! \u00a0no seriously. \u00a0go somewhere else if you're looking for quantity instead of quality. if they DID serve sushi here, i think the chef would do a stupendous job! cuz that kani nigiri and sashimi was incredible! but do come here if you want to experience fine and traditional japanese dining. oh and learn to read hiragana. the sign in front is written in japanese. no english whatsoever! \u00a0good luck finding it. lucky for me i know how to read it. dont forget to make a reservation! oh and prepare to drop $100 per person.",

We enjoyed all this along with a fine, dry sake and green tea afterwards. \u00a0 Sounds like alot, but they portion it and pace it perfectly so you do not feel grossly stuffed at all. \u00a0Just utterly and completely satisfied. \u00a0 This is \u00a0a rare dining experience, for special occasions, and needless to say - expensive. \u00a0Plan for about $120 per person if having the prix fixe along with liquor. \u00a0A little less ($80 -100 per person) if ordering a la carte, which is also a great choice. \u00a0THere are plenty of restaurants we've eaten that I'd have to say are overpriced, but this is definitely NOT ONE OF THEM. \u00a0This is fine dining at it's best.",

    "review_text": "I am very picky about Japanese restaurants here in the bay area. \u00a0I have unfortunately haven't really found a good one, until now. The food a Kappa is amazing. \u00a0 To have the true experience, you have to order the omakase menu.  The omakase started with a shrimp soup. \u00a0The second dish was a fish tempura dish. I think the fish was saba. \u00a0The third dish was the main dish. It was composed of a lot of different pieces such as duck, spicy roe wrapped in squid , tonkatsu, stingray, tomago, seared tuna, hamachi in a tart sauce, and a whole shrimp. The fourth dish (which was unexpected) was a sushi and baby scallop dish. The baby scallop was raw and the taste was sweet and delicate. \u00a0The sushi served were hamachi and unagi (drool...I love unagi). \u00a0The fifth dish was the dessert course composed of watermelon jello, mochi with red bean, fruits, and green tea cheesecake. \u00a0 All desserts were delicious, especially the mochi (drool....I love mochi), though I considered the watermelon jello as the palette cleanser.  As the omakase is composed of small servings, I thought I would still be hungry afterwards. But I was content and satisfied. \u00a0 Service was excellent by the husband and wife. \u00a0 Very polite, precise, and all the executions flawless. \u00a0The same type of quality you'd expect and receive in Japan.   A definite must to come back when I want Japanese food.",

    "review_text": "Summary: if you have eaten very good Japanese tapas restaurants (izakaya) such as Tanto, Gochi, and Saizo, and are ready to experience the extra sophistication in taste, the food is worth the extra spending.  Now here's the whole story. \u00a0My mother, since moving to the small town in Texas, has missed quality Japanese food. \u00a0She told me she would treat me as my birthday present, so as I have not tried this place, I offered this place to her, somewhat worried that she might say no given the expected splurge. \u00a0She said yes, after not being to reserve a table at Kaygetsu.  It's not easy to find the entrance to this place. \u00a0Basically, go up the step right at the front of Denny's in SF Japan town, open the double door that says \"club ??? (I forgot the name),\" and find the lantern right away. \u00a0Right to that is the entrance to Kappa. \u00a0If you turn left, you'll go into the club.  Once inside, you'll notice that the place is definitely small. \u00a0It actually reminds me of a quality Japanese restaurant in the middle of Tokyo, even though the food served is Kyoto style (slightly sweeter than Tokyo style, with more frequency of seaweed broth being used). \u00a0  The waitress was an attentive Japanese woman who makes conversation to customers for hospitality. \u00a0The male chef likewise was attentive and quick on customer's orders. \u00a0Because this place only serves 13 people, though, they could do that. \u00a0  The menu only has 30 or so dishes, but boy, were these dishes sophisticated or not. \u00a0Fried beefsteak leaves with miso paste inside was a nice way to ignite appetite for further dishes and sake. \u00a0Simmered Tanba (a region in Kyoto(?) that is traditionally famous for beans) black bean was sweet, but also delicate. \u00a0My kid sister really liked sheared tuna with grated yam on top. \u00a0Indeed, inside there was a small amount of broth and freshly-grated wasabi. \u00a0Mixing them with soy sauce made this dish wonderful. \u00a0Tuna itself was also great.  They also had senmai-zuke, which is pickled turnip with seaweed. \u00a0They seem to make their own pickles, and the quality was mouthwatering. \u00a0Most American probably would not care for pickles, but if you like other kinds of pickles (kim chee, sauerkraut), you should try this kind of home-made Japanese pickles as well.  Their bite-size pork cutlet was well cooked, but with a lot of flavor. \u00a0The bread batter might have to do with it, but the quality of pork (kuro buta = black pork in Japan) probably plays the role too. \u00a0Stewed green was easy to eat, but still full of flavor thanks to deep-fried been curd and a hint of red pepper. \u00a0Grilled minced chicken and Shiitake mushroom were a little crunchy on outside, and soft and flavorful on inside. \u00a0It's not easy to grill like this, trust me. \u00a0Their ochazuke was delicate and light. \u00a0I was able to finish even though I was pretty full right before that. \u00a0  Yes, the bill was pretty steep. \u00a0But my mother definitely enjoyed the dish, understanding the worthiness of the food she appreciated so much. \u00a0I have to agree with her.  On the side story, my mother was aggressive enough to ask the waitress to see if they could use her hand-made glass plate for the restaurant. \u00a0While the waitress declined the offer after asking the chef, she was gracious enough to ask him in the first place. \u00a0That shows the attentiveness this restaurant gives to customers.",

Japan is full of these tiny restaurants that only seat a handful of people. Everyone at the bar, including us, had the omakase and it did not disappoint. The chef's wife was the sole server and very efficient and friendly. She explained what each course was and answered any questions we had. The courses were creative, beautiful, and tasteful. We went from course to course efficiently, yet didn't feel as if we were being rushed - dinner still took about an hour and a half. There was plenty of food and we left feeling stuffed. There was a good amount of sushi but be prepared to try other (delicious) things as well. As we are from the East Coast, where omakases from fancy restaurants can be much more expensive, we felt that the price here, though not cheap, was very reasonable for the quality of food and the service. What a special experience! I have recommended it to all of my friends in the San Francisco area for a nice date night for special occasion.",

    "review_text": "However, a stunning dinner last evening at Kappa is where I'll start... A farewell to a good friend was a great reason to return here...  An opening course comprised of a gelatinous goo comprised of okra and clarified fish stock on top fresh scallops, topped with large roe. A clean, bright starter...  Kinpira-gobo. This is basically simmered burdock root which had a dressing of mostly sesame oil and seeds with a little red pepper flakes.  A series of small bites; reading from left to right starting from the top-left: cold, seared marinated duck breast (tender and rich), squid rolled around fish roe, grilled meatball. Second row: sea snail, \"sushi\" of egg yolk wrapped with shrimp and cucumber, ankimo. Third row: tamagoyaki, smoked scallop, anago sushi. I love this presentation and all the various bites that are presented.  Assorted sashimi: Very decent hamachi (yellowtail), halibut (very good, very tender), 2 pieces of maguro, and mirugai (giant clam). Also, real wasabi, which was sweet and not too hot.  The fried bits; a corn fritter, a crab puff, cold seared toro, and black-skin pork, tonkatsu-style. The corn fritter was amazing - literally bursting squirts of freshness. The pork was tender and rich and the toro literally melted in the mouth.  Nearing the finish, served in a martini glass was a concoction of pureed fava beans in which was set a single perfect bite of shrimp. Topping all of it was jellied fish broth. I'm not sure I have ever experienced the single essence of fava beans so delicately prepared.  The sweet bites: Along with a selection of fresh melon and mango, are two house-made preparations - the one on the left is filled with red bean paste and topped with soy powder, kinako, and the one on the right molded with white bean and chestnut, a kuri wagashi.  A word on service - this is a husband-and-wife establishment and with only ten seats, reservations are required as all the service is done by the Mrs. The plates and utensils used are delicate, expensive, and quite beautiful. The entire meal is a treat.",

    "review_text": "Episode 6 of Minami-ke Okaeri (Japanese Anime), at about the 21:55 mark. Apparently one of the characters made a big deal about \"Matsutake Mushrooms\". \u00a0Wondering whats the big deal with these mushrooms, I immediately paused the episode and went on Google. \u00a0Found out this mushroom is rare and hard to harvest; piquing my interest, I then hopped on Yelp and searched for \"Matsutake Mushrooms\" to see where I can eat such rare mushrooms. \u00a0The results led me to this tiny traditional Japanese restaurant called Kappa.  Kappa is located next to Playground, a Korean restaurant/bar. \u00a0Though I had been to Playground before, i never imagined such a restaurant existed here. \u00a0First time I came here I wanted the Omakse, but that requires 1 day advance notice so I decided to pick individual items out of their menu instead. \u00a0Obviously I got the grilled Matsutake Mushrooms <a href=\"http://static2.px.yelp.com/bphoto/k0NsHvB1STOFGaXN1FWOPw/ms\">static2.px.yelp.com/bpho\u2026</a> The Hamachi Neck <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7hw41z5sAO6XNLzbzNCg?select=Z1K-KxyU8iXplNOGOlDQ3Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7h\u2026</a> and got some Ankimo, combination sashimi, chicken meatballs and the crab sunomono. \u00a0They were all very good, though I wanted to try the Omakase. \u00a0I decided to come a second time and called in advance so they can prepare my Omakase.  Started off with a light wonton soup, then moved onto the crab sunomono. \u00a0Next up was the peanut butter asparagus; not a big fan of asparagus but ate it anyways. \u00a0Finally onto the main course, this is where I have decided that the Omakase was worth every penny. \u00a0Our 4th course was a combination of many items which I forgot the names for.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7hw41z5sAO6XNLzbzNCg?select=_IECZuTFdbdgClPA9aMbVQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7h\u2026</a> A \u00a0few items i do remember is the rice crispy tofu, deep fried tofu thats soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside topped with rice crispies. \u00a0YUM! The spicy roe wrapped with squid was outstanding. \u00a0Other items on the plate consist of tamago, duck breast, ankimo, smoked salmon, hamachi, red bean paste and the giant shrimp. \u00a0 Course 5 was a combination of fresh sashimi <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7hw41z5sAO6XNLzbzNCg?select=xn9JBMDghKrcQv70vY4oPw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7h\u2026</a> Course 6 includes a pork katsu, fried hamachi, unagi and a piece of pumpkin. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7hw41z5sAO6XNLzbzNCg?select=5T6osMv17i7djZgj_U01xg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7h\u2026</a> Finally this brings us to the deserts. \u00a0The mizuyokan is a kind of traditional japanese red bean gelatin accompanied with a green tea mochi and vanila ice cream topped with grean tea powder. \u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7hw41z5sAO6XNLzbzNCg?select=hQCI6oLcNGQmvM7JZ53AcQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jI7h\u2026</a> We finished up with a plate of fresh fruits.  Everything in this little restaurant is delicious. \u00a0The wife that works here is very nice. \u00a0Both times we went she was wearing a kimono or a yukata. (i cant tell the difference) \u00a0She would talk to us while we ate and explain to us what each item is called and how its prepared. \u00a0The tea here is delicious as well. \u00a0At $85 a person for the omakase, for all the different types of food you get, Its definitely worth the money!",

Blah blah blah  After reading all of the reviews on Kappa, I thought I should lend a voice of reason to the \"oh my god you have to go here because it feels like you're in japan and there are real japanese businessmen eating at the bar and she wears a kimono\" comments on this place.  First off...I've lived in Japan. \u00a0I know Japan...and this place...well, it definitely IS a part of Japan. \u00a0But not the part that includes food that tastes good. \u00a0It's the part of Japan that makes you feel like you should like the food because it's part of a greater cultural experience or Kyoto-type overpriced flavorless zen experience.  I actually was served a fifteen dollar giant unflavored or seasoned mushroom here, with a garnish of a slice of lemon...that should give you an idea of the food you would expect here.  so, for 2...and only one of us drinking sake, the bill for very petite portions of eel, mushroom, sashimi, and other flavorless things (sashimi good but not memorable), the bill was roughly 170 bux. \u00a0For real.  I just think everyone should go into this knowing that you'll be paying for the experience of sitting in a very small restaurant with the wife of the husband wife duo watching you as you try to eat the flavorless mushroom without making a face-type experience. \u00a0but if you've never been to japan and fancy yourself the cosmopolitan type of person who would like the \"authentic\" experience of eating in a very small and uncomfortable restaurant, then this is your place. \u00a0but if that's the type of person you are then you are probably a manga-reading, english-teaching, nihon-phili-fetishist...and you know who you are.  holla.",

To date, the only \"high end\" restaurant that I would recommend unequivocally was Myth... but Myth was never special occasion high end, and now its changed owners.  And then we met Kappa.  Certainly, Kappa doesn't seem like a schmancy place: it's upstairs from the Japantown Denny's, with an unmarked door, and seating for no more than 10. But the food, the service... its heavenly. Plus, one of the things that I was not impressed by Gary Danko was that the food they served was so generic. It was damn good, for sure, but I can get good foie gras just about anywhere these days.  Kappa is like no other restaurant - Japanese or otherwise - that I've been to. John and I went last Tuesday for his 30th birthday, and it was a wonderful experience. We ordered the omakase so we didn't have to think about what to order, and what paired well with what. We were the only two customers in the place until the last 30 mins, so Rumiko (the owner) fussed about us. Everything was superbly presented. All we had to do was to order a sake, and enjoy the food.  Even though each taste was just a morsel, by the end of the night, even Mr. Hollow Leg John was stuffed. Besides, the flavors were so rich and different that we were able to savor each bite.  It will be hard to top something like Kappa. But that's ok, that's why we have special occasions only occasionally.",

The food and the service are so good, if the place looked better, it would spoil the convivial atmosphere and make everything feel cold and formal.  The food has been covered very well by other reviewers. Lots of small plates, very fresh, seafood heavy, and minimally prepared. It's great. Most first-time visitors are encouraged to try the chef's menu (a good choice), and all we were responsible for was choosing sake.  The service is extraordinary.

The service: an older Japanese husband wife team, no other help. They are cute, friendly, extremely humble and gracious. Attentive, extremely so. Very VERY friendly.   The location and space: located where old Denny's use to be, 2nd floor, in J-town. It size of the restaurant looks like a glorified storage closet for the club/lounge next door - its small, intimate, BUT NOT claustrophobic as they limit the diners, there will be no more than 8-10 at anytime, they space you out so that you have enough privacy and do not feel cramped. It is almost reminiscent of those old style exclusive japanese restaurants you see on TV.   The food: the omakase is a 7 course meal for $85pp. For the quality and portions, it is a VERY fair price. The dishes were inventive and atypical of what one might think of japanese (which is usually sushi, sashimi, udon, sukiyaki, and curry, etc). The couple who owns the restaurants hails from northern japan, they bring that region's flavor into their restaurant. They definitely serve sashimi, extremely fresh and delicious at that, but there are plenty more dishes that I have never tried before.   The highlights for me were the salmon with fermented rice, the squid with squid eggs, the squid roll with fish roe, the sake/soy eggplant, the toro (both sashimi and nigiri versions...extremely fatty sinful and creamy), the asparagus with sesame sauce, their house made wasabi, and house made red bean cake. There were absolutely no complaints on my part for the food, in fact, every dish was spot on! We asked the nice lady to recommend some sake as well, we ended up sampling 3, just tell her what texture you like and she will get it done!",

We asked the hostess to select a sake for us to start with, and 2 hours of foodie bliss began. The general format was that for each course, the chef (her husband) would come out front and prepare the course, then would return to the back while she served it and we ate. \u00a0It wasn't clear if he wasn't particularly chatty, or just didn't speak as much English.  Know that part of eating here is talking to and interacting with the hostess - she not only explains what each course is, but is also interested in chatting with you during the meal, learning about her customers and making it an interactive dining experience. \u00a0If you're looking for a place to huddle over a table in the corner and just stare into your date's eyes, this isn't the place for you. ;) Her English was quite good, but many times I was glad I could speak some Japanese - I think it helped break the ice, and made the experience more fun for everyone.  So what did we have? 1 - chicken meatball with a slice of shiitake mushroom and a couple of other things in a light but very flavorful soup broth. 2 - Japanese eggplant in ponzu sauce with bonito flakes 3 - Dungeness crab meat, and lightly pickled cucumber with sesame seeds 4 - a large square plate with a number of wonderful bite-sized items, all arranged around a huge raw prawn, including: duck breast, monkfish liver, smoked-salmon nigiri, lotus root slice, tako-yaki, burdock root wrapped in sea eel, sweet red beans, tamago, cooked hamachi, crispy tofu, and spicy cod roe wrapped in squid(?). \u00a0beautiful presentation. 5 - sashimi plate with maguro, hamachi, kanpachi, and hirame I believe 6 - a plate of hot food bites - fried fish cake with fresh ginger, panko fried scallop, fresh corn fritter, and the most amazing melt-in-your-mouth unagi I've ever had 7 - first dessert - slices of incredibly fresh, sweet fruit: mango, peach, and melon, accompanied by a homemade mochi-like gooey sweet rice ball with red bean paste 8 - second dessert - vanilla ice cream with black sugar sauce and soy bean powder  The desserts were accompanied by a fantastic green tea. \u00a0Every single thing we ate was fantastic. \u00a0Rich, subtle, simple, complex, balanced... pick a superlative adjective, and it would apply. About halfway through our meal we noticed that the slabs of fish in the display case at the bar weren't being returned (as they usually would at a sushi restaurant) after they were taken out for each course, and we realized that we were eating all of them. \u00a0All of the fish had been purchased specifically for our meal, which explained its fantastic freshness and quality.  We also ended up having 5 different sake over the course of the evening (which racks up quite a bill, but was entirely worth it!). \u00a0The hostess is very knowledgeable about all of their sake, and is happy to recommend ones appropriate to the meal at hand. \u00a0Everything we drank paired magnificently with the food; it was easy to tell these items were meant to go together. \u00a0Our favorites were the Naraman (Jyunmai), which was dry but very complex, fruity, and flavorful, and the Kagatobi (Ginjo), which was fascinatingly similar to a hard, mineral water in flavor, while very clearly not being water.  2 hours after we'd arrived, our luxurious meal had come to an end. \u00a0It had been the perfect amount of food - we were all happily full, none of us too full, none remotely hungry. \u00a0A truly spectacular meal, and an incredibly unique, very intimately Japanese experience that made me nostalgic for my time in Japan. \u00a0It's not remotely cheap (especially when you drink as much as we did!), but it's completely worth it.",
