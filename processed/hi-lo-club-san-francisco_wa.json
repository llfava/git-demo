Or more importantly, being in the right in those melodramatic situations.   And yet...  I was having a fantastic time at Hi-Lo one night. \u00a0I sat alone at the bar, was carded (natch), ordered and proceeded to sip on a beer, while waiting for a friend to meet me before dinner. \u00a0The vibe was chill: some well placed candles lit the dimmed spot (in daylight when I was here before it's a little... weirder lighting - the skylight lends some fluorescent-like beams into the space, or something?). \u00a0There was some funky jungle-esque music playing. \u00a0I hadn't known if I liked Hi-Lo before, but I was coming around. \u00a0For sure, I was digging it. \u00a0Hi.  My friend comes, and tells the bartender she doesn't have her ID - it was hung up in some problem with an African visa situation, I don't really know. \u00a0The bartender protests. \u00a0My friend apologizes and says she doesn't need to order alcohol, she can just get a soda or wait with me as I finish my beer. \u00a0The bartender won't have it, and asks my friend - who is obviously beyond the questionable \"is she isn't she\" 21 charade - to leave the bar. \u00a0I thought how it was handled wasn't polite, but whatever. \u00a0If that's your policy and you fear your job will be lost, license revoked, and bar shut down if a 28 year old sits there for 5 minutes, psssh. \u00a0That's your prerogative. \u00a0That's fine. \u00a0I won't protest.  What irked me was what happened next. \u00a0After my friend walked out to make a call, insisting I finish my beer while she did, the bartender and guests at the end of the bar proceeded to call my friend an asshole and laugh. \u00a0Dude, why? \u00a0I promise you Yelp lurkers, on all yo mommas' graves, she was anything but. \u00a0And to do so while I was still there and within earshot, quietly sipping my beer like non-assholes do? \u00a0It left a bad taste in my mouth. \u00a0And so I left with that bad taste in my mouth, bummed I realized I don't feel like returning again. \u00a0Lo.  We got over it quickly enough, went to another bar where the tenders don't power trip, and enjoyed drinks together. \u00a0Hi.",

    "review_text": "A year's worth of KoKo's nostalgia possibly made my expectations unrealistically high, but I couldn't help but be a little disappointed with Hi-Lo Club. What I remember from KoKo's: Quality cocktails at a good price with friendly service and a laid back crowd. That combo's probably too much for any bar to pull off in their first few weeks of being open, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt as they work out the kinks.  The space is a lot more open than their old spot, with big floor to ceiling windows in the front. Lots of booths are great if you get one, and when we were there they had table service. Our server also doubled as our drink-maker. She was a great server, but not so great at the drink making. I had a Sazerac and an Old Fashioned, and they were both watered down and way too sweet. After every sip of the Old Fashioned, I considered abandoning it and going to another bar, but I don't like wasting alcohol when there are starving children in China who probably don't have any alcohol at all. It's just how I was raised. Other people in my group seemed to enjoy their drinks, so I may have just been unlucky. Things were also pretty busy that evening, much busier than any time I had been to KoKo's - not sure if this is because it's still pretty new or if it's going to be a permanent thing, but I like my bars a little quieter. Geez, I sound so old and not fun.  I'll come back here again, especially if I'm in the area, but I hope they are able to capture some more of the old KoKo's magic as things settle down from their opening.",

I've lived in this stretch of Polk Gulch for almost three years. \u00a0Somehow for the first two, I managed to walk right by Hi-Lo without really noticing it was there. \u00a0It's mostly dark-tinted glass out front, with the side area where Iron and Steam does their thing during the day. \u00a0When you walk-in, it's no longer nondescript.  The environment makes me think of a bombed-out building in some European village during World War Two - believe it or not, I say that in a complimentary way. \u00a0Perhaps, romantically, I think this feels like a place where a soldier would spend the night and feel a dark and quiet refuge from the war that will come again in the morning. \u00a0Or maybe a place where the people from some French village come at night to try and carry on their antebellum way off life in the midst of chaos, knowing that one day this too shall pass. \u00a0  The walls are distressed, and there is limited natural light coming in from a skylight. \u00a0The lighting fixtures feel impromptu - and, it is DARK once the sun is down. \u00a0You gotta take a few minutes to let your eyes adjust. \u00a0That said - the bar is beautiful, and they have an amazing selection of liquors and craft-beers. \u00a0I'm not a cocktail guy, usually, but I love their beer list. \u00a0It is a little heavy on the import-side, but that's fitting for the vibe.  And back to the dive bar statement - this place is WAY too classy for that. \u00a0The service is really knowledgeable, the products are good quality and I would rate the crowd as upscale but casual, good age-range, no fratty-douche bags. \u00a0And, it's never loud or obnoxious. \u00a0Not a bad place to go after a late dinner to have a quiet conversation with someone.",

It's a great starter bar if you're out for a night of barhopping, or a great \"break\" bar if you're looking for somewhere calmer to wind down. There's nothing too interesting or unique about it -- I know that doesn't sound like a positive trait, but for me it is. The unique bars on Polk Street (like Soda Popinski's) are always so crowded that I often find myself looking for a quieter place to relax.   The atmosphere is dark and intimate, with a large standing space. From the exterior, it doesn't look like anything special (gray and boring-looking, with a faint \"Hi-Lo\" sign and a bouncer in the front), but once you step inside, you immediately feel more comfortable. The decor is classy-hipster, with hardwood flooring and concrete walls.   The bartenders are nice enough, and knowledgeable about their drinks. My friend told one of the staff to mix something random, and he whipped up some fabulous concoction that I downed within a few minutes.   **NOTE:** If you're looking for somewhere to dance, this is not the place (yeah, they shouldn't be calling it a \"club\" at all).   **TIP:** THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY. There are definitely ATMs all over Polk Street, but if you only have a card on you and you don't want to pay any service fees, you might want to bypass Hi-Lo.",

The service is pretty good. Although it would be labeled a dive bar, it's actually very clean and nicely furnished for anything on that part of Polk. It's also very dark and cozy for a relaxing bar atmosphere.  This is a great place to meet up with a large group of friends before or after dinner or to have a large happy hour. Our running club uses this as a celebratory watering hole for race celebrations. The street itself and some of the surrounding pedestrians can be disturbing and off putting so be aware. The bartenders and doormen keep the bar itself free of stragglers and very safe for its consumers.",

The bar is lined with antique mechanized cash registers, stocked to the 9's, with really friendly bartenders. I wouldn't consider this a dive bar, but just...vintage. It's not old and complete with a floor that's so sticky you'd think you were in a frat house, the way I typically think of true dive bars. It's vintage and in its own way, a touch vintage-classy.  For some reason, it reminds me of the scene in any given movie where two people have a REALLY deep, insightful conversation in their booth, under the fluorescent half-dim candlelight-like bulb that hangs from the ceiling, surrounded by a bar full of half-rusted antiques.   Cash only, so bring your Benjamins if you're planning on hanging out for awhile. Well, more like a few 20s. But you can still bring your Benjamins if you wanna to look like a baller. Just don't make it rain. There's a time, and a place...:)",

Unless of course it's 10pm on a Friday when it turns into the hotspottiest hotspot on Polk Street. \u00a0And for good reason. \u00a0 Everything that was great at their previous incarnation, Koko's, has been tweaked and tempered until nothing was left but sweet and sublime.

Often I'm suggesting off hours to convene for a drink -- 4pm on weekdays or 2pm on a Saturday... or 1am on a Wednesday. I really do this out of respect for the bartenders as... say... there's a good chance I have a hankerin' for a gin fizz, and in a bustling crowd it's poor form to order one. With that in mind, we arrived at 630 on a Friday -- their second Friday being open.   Martinis and Manhattans were the orders and they crafted a Rittenhouse Rye Manhattan that was pristine. They served it in a vintage coup glass. (If you would like to take me home, note: serve whatever you're serving in a vintage glass.)   Some don't like it loud. Some don't like simple, open design. I do. Diner table booths. Concrete walls. High ceilings. It's loud. It's airy. It's comfortable. Note: the prior business's awning is still up that reads \"crepes, pastries,\" and 1423 is the correct address. Cash only. ATM across the street.   The last thing I was expecting was table service -- on a Friday at 7pm... table service they had, and five stars they get.",

All in all, before midnight, I loved the atmosphere because it's dark, it's intimate (as intimate as can be with many other people hanging out) and the blue crackled walls and tiled ceiling with sky light give off a pretty cool vibe. \u00a0The inside looks unfinished, rugged and like a good bottle of half drunk whiskey, you can't help but be attracted to it. \u00a0Well, I guess that last statement is only true if you're like me and like a good swig of whiskey.  Shortly after midnight, I turned into a pumpkin, but that's seriously when the crowd and noise level kicked up. \u00a0If you're into lively crowds then, arrive here anytime after 10PM.  My assessment: \u00a0pretty friendly crowd, decent bottled beer and a cool; yet, unpretentious vibe. \u00a0I would not necessarily categorize this as a \"dive\" bar, but a \"local\" watering hole.

For me, I'm just too old school to talk to \"trendy\" types.  The drinks here are great! and I just love the old timey decor. I love these bars where the bartenders really take the time to make you a good drink with fresh ingredients and quality liquors. The bar staff are all very knowledgeable about the drinks and about random chit chat too. I'm the kind of drunk that sits up at the bar and talk people's ears off, and they are really chill about that. (also why I like dive bars, I'm not suited for fancy establishments)  I used to bartend at a dive in LA... I would warn people not to drink the well because it was pretty much poison. So I greatly appreciate these hipster dives where they don't serve that kind of crap but do retain the chill atmosphere and therapeutic bartenders.",

The wine was bad, I cautiously sipped it for a while not wanting to complain, but then my friends came and confirmed that it was in fact really bad. Not a bad wine, just a bad keg. It was completely corked.  I think the woman that was serving us was the owner, I politely (reluctantly) asked her if the keg was old, and she said she had just opened it and very nicely offered me something else. I ordered a Pimm's Cup which was really tasty. But then she came over and charged me for the drink (I had already paid for the wine). All my friends were shocked--that was not the impression she had given.  I paid, not wanting to cause a scene, but it was really rude. I had been planning to leave her a nice tip for changing my drink (and the $2 difference in price), but instead I left nothing.  I most likely won't be going back. It's too bad.

Not somewhere I'd go if I was trying to party on a Friday night, but definitely worth the weeknight visit when I'm wanting to be chill.  Cash only though!",

    "review_text": "If you loved KoKo Cocktails, it's the same 3 owners, and the same vibe, plus or minus some of the Polk/Marina crowd. I'd say it's a better, more mature version of the Koko.  While it doesn't have the same divey vibe of the Koko, it is bigger, better and all-together a more comfortable bar. The owners did all the decorating themselves, importing the original bar from the Koko, even going as far to import antique ceiling tiles from New York City, and putting in old-timey floor boards and a secret storage room (VIP room) with 100 year old newspapers on the wall. \u00a0 Oh yes... The bathrooms! Oh the glorious, clean, private bathrooms!! (Koko insiders will remember the less-than-ideal restroom situation...lol.) During slow times, they even allow friendly dogs.   This is a COCKTAIL BAR first, not a dive bar, as evidenced by the not-cheap and quality cocktails. They have a decent selection high-quality beers as well (IPAs!). Just don't go here expecting darts and cheap drinks, or sports TVs on the wall. That's not this bar. \u00a0  Finally, if you go to a bar, and it clearly says \"Cash Only\", respect the freedom and business decisions of the owners, and don't go writing some lame Yelp review because you were **too stupid to read the signs**. \u00a0 \u00a0Besides, did you ever think that requiring cash payment in a city known for being \"Cash Only\" filters out some of the undesirable types (ie, loud-mouth, brash Marina yuppies buying rounds on their charge card)?   The HiLo = 5 stars",

We were even treated to history and factoid lessons about whiskey production and distribution in one of our visits. \u00a0However, don't expect the same atmosphere on a Friday/weekend evening when douchebaggery overwhelms the place as it does every bar in the neighborhood (the annoying \u00a0\"Marina layer\" effect plaguing this city). \u00a0But if you ignore them and keep your eyes on the prize - your delicious cocktail the genuinely nice bartenders made with love - you'll still come out happy. \u00a0Cheers!",

I mean, a manhattan with a side of free bacon; yes, please.  So other than that rare bacon night, they also do really great cocktails on every other regular night. They've got a good liquor and beer selection and pleasant bar tenders. The interior of the place is also really beautifully done. There are tin ceilings, a huge I-beam stretching across the ceiling, and rustic crackling paint walls. They also usually have tea lights lining the liquor shelves which is a really lovely touch. Also I came one night and the bouncer had a big snake draped around his shoulders, so there's that.  The place can get a bit loud, and the crowd is sometimes a little square, but I can't dock them stars for that. Overall a really standup place.",

Overall, the space and everything was very cool, and it was nice to be recognized and greeted by one of the bartenders from the old location upon my arrival. \u00a0I just wish that bartender had stayed around to serve me and my group for the rest of the night.  The only reason this place gets a lower review \u00a0instead of 5 is upon purchasing my 3rd round of drinks for my table (with tipping each round) from the bar, the \"other\" bartender (taller, dark hair) made the critical error of taking my drink order (3 Mandarin and Soda's-Not complicated) and then within my hearing range took other people's drink orders afterwards, including one patron who had just walked in the door following my drink order, \u00a0and served them all and rang up their drinks before me, while leaving me standing at the non crowded bar like an idiot for nearly 10 minutes while my guests wondered what the hell was going on.  a thoughtful female member of staff noticed this and stopped by to let me know that my drinks would be coming \"right up\", but the real question is, why would you leave a customer waiting for so long? From the bartender himself there was no \"sorry about that\" or \"this round is on me\" or anything that could begin to excuse his lack of professionalism.  This was this Tuesday June 26th at 7:30 pm if that helps.  I'll give it another shot, but I hope someone tips off the bartender that you should serve people's drinks in the order they purchase them, and if you make choices that negatively affect your customers experience, you need to make it right.",

Great...It felt very hipster-ish, so that's likely what you're going to get.  We got a ton of alcohol, and they have a pretty good cocktail. Their Pim's cup here tasted similar to the one at Rickhouse - but not in the giant bowl (sad). The space is huge, and there's a lot of standing area near the door. Tables to the side , but they looked a little intimate to me. A couple of stools and tables near the back...ATM. I'm kind of at a 3.5, but I suppose a round down will have to do, as I've yet to return. Bouncer was super nice though!",
