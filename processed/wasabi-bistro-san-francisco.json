Every time. \u00a0The roll is finished off with a very dainty lil' sprinkling of sesame seeds. Your mouth will thank you, bow down to you, throw you a party.   This used to be our go-to spot for sushi delivery. I'll be honest, they suck at getting your order to you in a timely manner. Seriously though, you won't get your order for an hour and a half or two, and they won't even trip on that. They aren't accountable for their poor a** service, and that's what kills me. We have officially broken up.  Not cool, so I gotta give 'em 1 star.",

I'm new to the city, but not to the Bay, so I found this place on Yelp, thought it looked pretty classy, and sent out the link so my friend could make the reservation.  Tuesday night, 8 pm, the restaurant is basically empty and we get our pick of tables. Now that I think about it, it's probably because the Giants' World Series game was on, although there are TVs at this restaurant too.   I'll admit, the empty tables were worrisome at first, but the service was all the more attentive for it. We were immediately offered water and edamame. My friend brought a coupon for a free crunchy CA roll for a purchase over $35, which apparently can only be redeemed if you order online. But since we didn't know that, and because it was my birthday, the waiter told us that they'd honor the coupon anyway. So far, so good...  We ordered 6 rolls: X, Kamikaze, Martini, Miso Salmon, Crunchy CA, and Volcano. The Martini and Crunchy CA were fried really well and the Martini roll is actually served in a martini glass! As a salmon lover, the Miso Salmon roll was right up my alley. All the fish was very fresh.  We also ordered 3 of the soju cocktails, which were hit and miss. My passion cocktail (soju, pineapple juice, mango juice), was definitely the hit. Not very strong, but very delicious.  After we finished--free dessert (since it was my birthday and all)! The waiter (I wish we knew his name!) brought a plate of mint chocolate and coffee ice cream mochi with some chocolate syrup in a flower pattern, and he and my friends started a round of Happy Birthday, all in different keys. Very cute, and I love both mint chocolate and coffee ice cream.  Give this place a shot. I sure am glad I did, especially on an important occasion like a birthday. We're talking about returning for those $1 oysters during happy hour...",

First of all it was happy hour, which they have every day so we got fresh food for excellent prices. I started off with some oysters ($1 each) and it was super fresh with zesty toppings. Definitely would go back for these.   We also ordered a spicy tuna handroll ($2.95 each), Unago roll with mango and a Golden Gate Roll. Everything was fresh and tasty but the Unago roll was the most memorable and I'd come back for that too.   We also got a large order of unfiltered sake which was only $4, super good deal. Our bill came to $23 so if you want fresh food at a good deal, happy hour at this place is a great idea! Plus you get free edamame! Seems like a good place for a date night too.",

Once we ordered, it took about 25 minutes until we got our food. Before we could ask for more water, the server seemed to just book herself out of our table, so we couldn't ask for anything.

Their California roll is so good. The crab is fresh and real, and there's a hint of lemon to it (previous deluxe California rolls come with a lemon slice on it, and I loved the combination of flavors so it was great to see this flavor on the regular CA roll.)  The tempura shrimp roll was fantastic. Sometimes it's really the basics that are a tell to the quality of a sushi spot.  The calamari comes with fried onion and jalepeno pieces and plentiful squid. (the rings AND tentacles). It was perfection.  We were so full and so happy by the end of our meal. We will become regulars and urge you to do the same.  The d\u00e9cor is very stylish and posh, with unique fixtures, and wall details.   The service is professional, but friendly and personable as well.

She said she'd change it. \u00a0But she forgot. \u00a05 minutes later, I told her, \"Listen, we were actually serious about not wanting to see dead people while we're eating.\" \u00a0She did fix it then...  Anyway, the food was unremarkable. \u00a0They said they had hamachi belly, but they didn't. \u00a0So I had some hamachi, and it was rubbery. \u00a0Certainly not worth savoring in any way. \u00a0We also had some rolls, which were pretty decent... Though one was overly sweet and hella fatty (deep fried). \u00a0The garlic edamame were very good.  But back to the service... So my girlfriend's vegetarian, and we ordered her stuff very clearly as \"the vegetarian stuff\"... Then the food comes out, all vegetarian stuff first, then all the fish! \u00a0So I got to watch her eat (well OK I stole a bunch of it) and then she got to watch me eat. \u00a0Really? \u00a0Seems like that could have been done better.

But I really wouldn't expect much else in the Castro.  My date ordered some sushi for main course, and I ordered one of the entrees (pork katsu). His sushi came out in about 5-10 minutes. Fifteen (!!!) minutes later, I still hadn't received any soup or salad, much less my entree.  We had a hard time flagging down someone to help us (despite eight people front of house that we counted). We mentioned that none of my food had come out yet, waiter was apologetic, went to the back and immediately returned with my entree.  When I mentioned that I didn't receive my soup or salad still, they were surprised and brought them out immediately.  As for the quality of the food, mine was mediocre at best. Under-seasoned katsu that was soggy on the bottom (I'm guessing it was sitting out for a while). Pretty much flavorless. Date said that the sushi wasn't bad, fairly standard.  The management was very apologetic for the mess up with my food, and comp'd us our sake. They offered us free dessert too.  All said, I think they really have to work on the quality of their food for the prices they are charging, and their communication between the front and back of house. Having 8 people milling about that haven't noticed a half-served table is pretty unacceptable.  Doubt I'll return.",

    "review_text": "I work on the street and hadn't tried Wasabi Bistro since it opened because I thought it was the previous sushi place that had a terrible Chinese place in front just getting a facelift. However I found it had different owners now. I used to be loyal to Osaka Sushi in the Castro for my healthy food meals (amazing a neigborhood full of gym bunnies mainly has heavy food restaurants), however Osaka's sushi a while back was noticeably not as fresh one day and never got better, and it was still hard to leave without paying $35/$40 for a simple small lunch of sushi.   The interior looks nice. There's a host in the middle of the day waiting to seat you. They are super friendly. Don't let the fact that this place is empty fool you- it's good, just undiscovered! They have a large selection of food, some dishes such as the tuna tartare (delicious) have a california cuisine edge to them. I was impressed by the size of their side salad, and the price and quality were good (no iceberg lettuce). There is a large selection of hot and cold sakes. It's really easy to walk out of here after having a fresh, healthy, good tasting meal for around $25 for lunch (without being limited to the lunch special).  I highly recommend this place to all my clients who often ask where to eat in the Castro. I hope these guys succeed. If they can shake the old sushi place they'll do just fine.",

My boyfriend wanted to say something and we tried to catch the waiter's eye and the waiter actually just stayed in the kitchen. I did not want to quibble about a few dollars, so we left. But you know what, you stole from us. We were so nice and told you how much we enjoyed stuff, and you stole from us. You do NOT determine your own tip, and you stole from us.

Quite possibly the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. Our waitress, Wendy, was incredibly knowledgeable and gave us very helpful tips, including which things really shouldn't be dipped in soy sauce so that their flavor could be properly savored. They also have REAL WASABI in addition to the paste one almost always gets, which is a nice treat. We were actually the only customers there, which was sad and in due in part to the war zone of the Castro, which is being completely torn up and renovated these days, so I can't speak for how the service might be if it was crowded but for us it was perfect.   So we gorged on a lot of food and had a $30 bottle of sake that seemed magically bottomless, and the meal came to $100 for the two of us, which seems very reasonable. We will definitely be back!

    "review_text": "Every time I move to a new city, I start exploring. Gyms. Restaurants. Clubs. Coffee Shops. Bars. Parks. The purpose is clear; to soak in the local flavor and find things that you love about a city; to make it home.  When I moved to Phoenix years ago, I discovered Fez. Then I got to San Diego and it was Hash House a Gogo. Then in Berkeley, it was Lime (okay, in SF). Then in LA, it was Animal.  The category? Mood enhancers. Those places that are so on top of their game, do what they do so well, and make you feel so comfortable, that you just click into place and go \"Yup, this is one of those gold-star places.\"  In 2014, in San Francisco, Wasabi Bistro is the place. I don't even know what to say, other than look at my pictures. The presentation was spot-on, the flavors were flawless, the sushi amongst the freshest I've had. The sake was delightful. The waiters were handsome (Hey, you're looking at a place in the Castro. You care too.) The owner was friendly, knew half of the customers by name, and hugged half of them on their way out the door after their meal.  Chatting with the owner a bit as our party had dinner tonight, somehow he came to feel like a friendly uncle who owns a restaurant. Which is two things... one... really how you want to feel at a place to plan to return to regularly... and two... really weird because there's no resemblance at all... Okay, maybe I should stop taking myself too literally here.  Seriously, worth checking out. I don't know what the few bad reviewers were talking about, but I suspect that either they caught the place while it was still undergoing some settling-in period... they had a few bad apples they no longer have... or something. Because I'm a sushi snob, as well as, you know, a general snob, and this place just nailed it.",

    "review_text": "Was very concerned when I saw high percentage of \"spicy\" rolls on the menu. In my experience this has been an attempt to mask low quality or less than fresh fish. \u00a0I am not a spicy tuna fan. \u00a0If I wan't to add chiracha to my food I will do it myself so I NEVER order anything on the menu with spicy tuna or a lot of sauce like ponzu or unagi sauce. \u00a0When I order Sushi I want to enjoy the flavor and texture of the fresh fish. Because of that this menu made it very difficult to order any rolls. I ended up order nigri: maguro, hamachi and hamachi toro., a rainbow roll, and and X roll which did have a spicy sauce. \u00a0   They brought the Nigiri first and was quite pleased with the freshness and portion of fish to rice. The maguro was one of the best I had in a while. \u00a0Then came the X roll. \u00a0very nice roll with salon and tuna on top, but drizzled in a typical chiracha based sauce. \u00a0Once I wiped that off it was pretty good. \u00a0Then came what I thought was the safe roll. \u00a0the Rainbow Roll. \u00a0It touted no imitation crap, they used snow crab instead with avocado and then an assortment of fish on top. \u00a0Well it may or may not have been imitation crab, but it was the worse crab salad in a rainbow roll I have had in a long while. \u00a0I ate the fish and avocado off it and left the roll.   When I told the waiter what I thought he thanked me and said that he appreciated the feedback because that is the only way they can learn and grow. \u00a0He also brought green tea ice cream as an apology.   To wrap it up. The fish buyer seems on top of it. \u00a0If I came back I would probably stick with Nigiri Chirashi or Sashimi. \u00a0The Menu really misses the mark for me. Place is a bit too Hipster Hong Kong and prices are a bit high, but it is the heart of the Castro so their rent is probably outrageous. \u00a0 Oh, and the host if very HOT.  I won't be rushing back",

We ordered a lot of different nigiri and all of them tasted extremely fresh and delicious. The lobster nigiri was my personal favorite. My boyfriend and I love spicy anything, so we gave the shishito peppers a try, and we loved it! It wasn't burning our mouth hot but they definitely had a kick to them. We also ordered uni. To be honest, I am not a fan of uni but the uni at Wasabi Bistro might have changed my mind. I always have room for dessert, so of course we ordered tempura ice cream. And, it was perfectly crispy on the outside and cool and refreshing on the inside.  In the middle of our dinner the owner, Albert, came by our table and asked how our food was and gave me and my boyfriend a complimentary beer. He was kind and genuinely wanted to know our opinions on his restaurant.   If you are in the city and near the Castro district, I would highly recommend you try this sushi restaurant.

We ordered other stuff off the menu which was surprisingly good, and some misses. The hamachi kama was good. Fried tofu, good. The bbq beef was good too. One thing that was not on the menu but you should try is chicken karaage (fried chicken). That was a winner.  Some of the not so good. Aside from the Princess roll mentioned above, the Teriyaki chicken - this was just grilled chicken with a sweet teriyaki sauce on it. Kinda dry. I'm used to my teriyaki chicken being marinated. We also had ankimo, which is supposed to be the foie gras of the sea. I think it sat a little too long because it didn't have that rich, buttery flavor its supposed to have.

While I don't think the sushi is the best in the Castro (as some reviewers have pointed out) I definitely don't think it it's the worst. I went for lunch just the other day and the place was pretty empty. The waiter came over, greeted us, and answered all questions we had about the menu, which is always nice. He genuinely seemed happy to have his job, again a plus.   I ordered the lunch special, which cost $12 and included a large salad, miso soup, bowl of rice, spicy tuna roll, and 4 pieces of nigiri. That's a pretty damn good lunch special. I asked what types of Nigiri would be given and he said it was the chef's choice so I asked for anything but eel (I hate eel!). He said that wasn't a problem and left.   I agree with other reviewers in that the service is quite slow (we were the only ones in there) and the food was pretty mediocre. I mean, the sushi rice was pretty dry, but the nigiri was fresh and tasted good. I didn't like one of the nigiri pieces (albacore) and didn't eat it. When the waiter came back he was so apologetic I didn't like the albacore and offered to go get me a salmon slab of fish instead. I thought that was quite nice of him. We (my friend and I) split a spider roll, too and found it to be delicious.  In short, I'm glad I came for lunch and didn't have to spend a ton of money but If I'm in the Castro I'm probably not going to eat sushi; I'll save that for other spots within the city.",

This place might survive on deep pockets...but it is on par with Shangria and the BBQ Rib place up the street and Jakes (did you see the whine fest on the door?). \u00a0All owner's currently blame the 'community' for their mistakes; rather than taking the criticize and trying delivering a good meal, at a fair price, in a nice atmosphere with pleasant staff.

    "review_text": "I went on a Wednesday night after getting my hair cut in the area and was craving some sushi. I probably wouldn't have gone if I looked at the reviews on here a head of time, so I am glad I didn't! This place was very good! I was stuffed by the time I left as it was so good, I just kept ordering more.   The hand-rolls are extremely fresh and well prepared. You could taste the crunch of the nori and the freshness of the fish. Definitely some of the best hand-rolls I have had. The sushi was pretty good too, but I just got the standard Rainbow roll and 49er roll. Nothing too fancy, yet I was extremely excited that they use real crab in their rolls! It is so hard to find a good sushi place who also uses real crab.   The only negative that I had was that the wasabi was really weak/mild. I had to use a lot to get any sort of kick.   I will agree with another Yelp review in that it is a weird ambiance in the place (lounge music, sports game on the TVs, etc), but it would not prevent me from going back. \u00a0The service was also very friendly as well. The sushi chefs were attentive and friendly, and the waitress was also sure to check in with me every now and then to see if I needed anything.   If you are in the area, definitely a good sushi spot.",

    "review_text": "How fabulously swanky and perfectly appropriate Wasabi Bistro is for the Castro where everything just needs to be, well, fabulous. At least that's the impression I got when I entered the doors of this new Japanese eatery, the one that took over All Season Sushi. I came at about 8PM on a Wednesday after a rather long day at work, and the place was still moderately busy. I was seated in the bar area where there were plenty of empty two-tops. It should come as no surprise that the decor was dominated by black lacquer, high-end light fixtures and lots of mirrors.  It was like eating at Liberace's Vegas showroom. Like I said...fabulous. Complimentary edamame arrived almost as soon as I sat down (see photo). While I was squeezing the beans into my mouth one pod at at time, I kept noticing how the menu went on for days as it was dominated by quite an eclectic collection of sushi and rolls. I always feel guilty ordering an elaborate sushi plate just for myself, so I went modest and ordered the $6.50 Spicy Tuna Roll (see photo) - simple, risk-averse and to the point. It was just fine as a starter.  The main event came with the $11 bowl of Pork Ramen, which came in a white designer bowl more fitting as part of a Danish modern place setting. The surprise was how delicious it was with slices of rolled roast pork generously swimming in the hearty broth alongside bamboo shoots and bean sprouts (see photo). I had every reason to believe it was going to be a noodle disaster, but far from it, I think I may come back just for that again. I'm also tempted to try tantalizing side dishes like wasabi scallop, tofu steak or any of the robata since I like the challenge of skewers when I eat.  FOOD - 4 stars...killer ramen bowl is a major surprise worth trying here AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...just fabulous...it's the Castro, sweetie SERVICE - 3.5 stars...on the quiet side TOTAL - 4 stars...makes me want to try some more",

I pride myself in thinking that I'm somewhat of a sushi connoisseur, and in terms of taste, service, decor and price(not that this place is cheap, because it's definitely not).  Value wise, they have an excellent happy hour menu: $1 oysters, $5 tempura $4 gyozas, a real bang for your buck. Moreover, their happy hour starts at 11:30am, which is unheard of.  I recommend their 3pcs/ or 6pcs Omakase menu in order to enjoy the best and tastiest sushi they offer.  I HIGHLY recommend their seared walu sushi-succulent, tasty, buttery, orgy and heaven in your mouth awesomeness.  As of right now, I'm the \"duke\" of Osaka sushi, which is a far cry from what Wasabi Bistro is. It's just that the later is right across from my work and I rather not walk further.

This review is primarily focused on the happy hour menu. \u00a0But I feel if the menu fails in the happy hour most likely does not improve later on.    If you want ambiance and want to talk, and are not focused on the food's taste this maybe a good place - it never seems terribly busy.   I love oysters and the $1 oyster happy hour special is what attracted me to try Wasabi Bistro. \u00a0I've been several times now - irresistibly drawn by the oyster appeal. The oysters are a nice size and taste ( drakes bay perhaps?) and it's served with a ginger green onion ponzu dressing. \u00a0The dressing is ok but I'd prefer \u00a0a traditional mignonette with shallots and champagne vinegar. \u00a0I wish they offered the option of more than one accompaniment.  I tried their house hot sake - a lil rough...   One very good thing is their California roll made with very nice real &amp; tasty snow-crab crab-meat.. I was pleasantly surprised and would come back just for the California roll. \u00a0  I decided to try some other appetizers on the menu - the fried chicken - Chicken Karaage and Tempura. \u00a0These were mediocre, not soggy but not tastyeither. \u00a0I think this place has room for improvement. \u00a0I love meat , especially fried chicken but I think this dish would be improved if the chicken were more bite-sized and the if the dish received a sprinkle of seasalt before service. \u00a0The Tempura was not as crisp as it should be and was rather flavorless.. this place should take a page out of Osaka Sushi's playbook up the street..  The service is strange here .. a mixture of attentiveness coupled with periods where you are ignored. \u00a0I think this awkward service is due to an inexperienced &amp; untrained staff.. out of the 4 times I've been here my order has always somehow been messed up. \u00a0Once the sake I ordered failed to arrive until halfway through my dinner. \u00a0Another time the 12 oysters I ordered never came until I brought it to the attention of the staff. \u00a0Another time they removed my entree thinking I was done without asking me. \u00a0I will go back in the next month and see how things improve.. \u00a0hope they are still around and get better.",

The sushi was all fresh and the sushi rice was tasty. As was the ginger and wasabi. Absent in the dish were pickles, though some spicy sprouts were there. The dish was $14, which is about on par with the other places in the area. I ordered miso soup, which did not come with the lunch special (it should.) The miso was good.  However, on another visit, I got the sushi nigiri combo. One of the snapper pieces was completely inedible. Chewy, scaley, unfresh tasting. Really so terrible that I have never gone back since.

    "review_text": "19-October, Friday: I'll start this review with the bad points because this place is so inconsistent it is hard to place my finger on exactly why I feel so mixed, but basically here are my likes and dislikes.  CONS:  The interior feels like I stepped into the faux version of Donatella Versace's banquet hall: smelly alligator pleather upholstered on the booth seating, which is hugged by a long beveled wall of mirrors before it turns into an accent wall of more alligator pleather in the back with a flatscreen hung in the center. In the front room there are 2 dangly chandeliers that are quite ridiculously over the top, and a harsh transition to slated walls that were either made of mock-porcelain, or something resin coasted with a low-sheen to it.   -tuna poke: maybe a bit too much onion - rainbow roll: was frighteningly awful, the salmon and tuna tasted a bit rough in texture and the level of freshness was definitely questionable.   PROS: Despite the atrocity of overwhelming decadence that is the interior, the service is always friendly, prompt, overly polite, and overly apologetic. Both times I've been here they have been very proactive about taking orders too soon, without giving me time to first breathe while I am still perusing the menu in an effort to make the best of informed decisions. \u00a0However, in the same breath plates of pickled ginger, wasabi, and edamame immediately come out upon seating, along with tall tumblers of iced water.  --miso: fresh bits of tofu very firm, light on the sodium, and perfect for the cold weather. -spider roll: was nice and crisp -gyoza: were cooked very well and had with the perfect amount of seared crisp -walu nigiri: I was rather impressed with the excellent freshness, texture, and taste. -castro roll: had a subtle severity to it, as the slices of fresh jalapenos complimented the sweet sauce really well  MAS-O-MENOS: so-so -spring rolls: were descent  -hamachi nigiri: I've had much better  I would probably come back here exclusively for the things I had good experiences with, since this place is conveniently located to where I live.

I like how they removed the take-out section in the front. \u00a0Having the picture windows in the front of the restaurant are great. \u00a0It feels like you are sitting outside without having to deal with the outside noise and uncomfortable weather during cold periods. \u00a0  My wife and I like to be surprised so many times we just ask the owner or manager for their best recommendations at that time. \u00a0Many times it's different because they will give us something that is fresh or in season. \u00a0There were a couple of times I asked for one of my typical sushi dishes and he would recommend something better. \u00a0 It's kind of a team effort thing that we really aopreciate.  The food was great! \u00a0I like how creative some of their dishes are. \u00a0I don't really remember the names of the dishes because I just told the owner (Albert) to hook me up with some of the best stuff he can offer. \u00a0He did not disappoint us. \u00a0I just remember having various sushi and grilled dishes that I never had before and walked out of there totally stuffed and happy. \u00a0He actually comp'd me with a couple of dishes that were new and asked my opinion before adding it to the menu.  I did take photos of what I liked though so all I have to do is pull it up on my iPad and I'll get to re-experience the yummy dish I had before! \u00a0  As Arnie S. would say ... \"I'LL BE BAACK!\" \u00a0:)  P.S. \u00a0They are the sister restaurant to Wasabi and Ginger on Van Ness and Vallejo streets. \u00a0Their food and service are very good too. \u00a0One of the things I like there is that they have FREE valet parking!",

As I get the food try it and like it, i'll go ahead and get riskier. I ordered:  Warm Saki and a large Sapporo- to get us started =]   Gyoza- Simple nothing out of the ordinary  Spicy Tuna- Was pretty good, was lacking spice but I just asked for a side of spicy mayo  Age Tofu- Very good. I love tofu so I was happy even with the amount!   Scallops wrapped in bacon- They were good but nothing from what they were... The bacon over powered them a bit  Godzilla Roll- fried miso tuna topped with spicy crab  In conclusion very good, great service and would definitely return",

It's big so there's usually no waiting.  I used to love Tokyo A GoGo and one of their sushi chefs works here. That's a good sign. And they give you a little bowl of edamame on the house.

Enough with the flat screens! I get they're cheap crowd-pleasers but go to The Mix if you want to watch the game.  And now for the main point. Service. Have these guys ever run a restaurant before? I ordered Tuna Sashimi, Salmon Sashimi and Agedashi Tofu and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and my friend ordered California Rolls and a bottle of Sapporo. Nothing came as planned. Asahi Black came instead of Sapporo, while that was being sent back a random red wine came for me. Ok, with the drinks straightened out the food trickles in. \"Special Sashimi\" - a selection of 5 different fish came. sorry not ours. Then some rolls that looked like green hockey pucks (going with the sports theme?) came. Sent those back too. Then the Special Sashimi came back again. No takers? Then nothing for 20 minutes, our waiter studiously avoiding our stares.  We gave up at this point so I can't review the food. When we told the waiter we want to leave he just sighed and said \"I'll bring the check\".   Yet another disappointing restaurant experiment in the Castro.",
