I was nervous about my iPod Shuffle working with their sound system, but the guy told me all it needed was a headphone jack. \u00a0It worked great! \u00a0They let me bring my own food which was also awesome.  The space is really nice and if it weren't for the fact that I'm never having a party again...I'd have another one here in a heartbeat. \u00a0So if you're having a party, invite me. \u00a0If I say I'm coming, I'll be there.  The bartender was really sweet and made the whole humiliating thing as nice as possible. \u00a0I would find the coolest bartender ever at place that hosts private parties.  Anyway, if you have me over for dinner some time soon I may just show up with a hundred dollar cabernet sauvignon (Indigo must have a great wine list btw). \u00a0However, since I devote the greater portion of my leisure time to keeping the makers of great $20 cabs in business...I can't promise that it will be better than what I'd bring normally.  For those of you that were there...thanks for coming and sitting there for 5 hours while you were probably so bored that you wanted to stab your eyes out with your mother's brooch.  PS Anthongy is a nerd. \u00a0My music is the bomb.",

    "review_text": "I hosted a birthday party here with 2 of my friends. The party was a wonderful success. The Crimson Lounge was a perfect venue for our event; not too formal, really affordable, private, and set for fun.  For a Saturday, the room fee was just under $200, with a minimum register ring of about $1200. Since we were hosting the party, we ordered around $1000 in food, hosted around $500 in drink stubs, and rest went to tax and service charges. All-in-all, it cost us around $35 per person for around 60 people.   A private venue, with food (good food too) and hosted drinks, for under $35; what more can you ask for?  VENUE: The venue is right next to the Indigo restaurant. No private parking. There is no street signage, so you'll have to give your guests a heads up. You have to walk down a steep flight of stairs, and I have no idea whether there is wheelchair access. You can have around 50-70 guests in there comfortably, but wouldn't go over that---unless you're into saunas. The decor is red, vinyl red. Tealight candles are lit throughout and there are booths and tables sprinkled throughout the lounge. The vinyl is a bit of a turn off, but after 4 drinks, no one noticed. There is a definite odor (if you're one of the first to arrive, you'll notice the musty carpet smell), but it you get used to it after a while.  MUSIC: You have to bring your own music, or listen to theirs. Sound system was decent enough.  RESTROOMS: You have to share restrooms with the Indigo restaurant. However, the restaurant closes much earlier than the lounge.  SECURITY: The bouncer was really nice and was heaven sent, because he managed to get rid of a few evil party crashers, help a drunk guest get a cab, and always had a light.  BAR: The bartender was really nice and was generous with the booze. His tally and the tally that I brought with me were exact down to the penny, so I don't question his honesty (I brought a tally with me, because I knew I'd be hammered).  FOOD: The $1000 in food that we purchased was good and there was enough of it to serve all 60 guests, with some left over. The smoked salmon, tuna tartar, and chicken skewers were big hits.  PARKING: Parking in SF sucks.  Before I booked the place, I read all the previous reviews, so our expectations were set accordingly. If you are on a budget and need a private venue, with a bar, security, decent food, and music, then this is a good bet. \u00a0If you're looking to host a fancy smancy party, a baby shower, or your Grandmother's 100th birthday, then you might want to look at a different venue.",

The bartenders were great, and really friendly. \u00a0They hooked it up with well mixed drinks and friendly banter as the level of inebriation grew and grew. \u00a0If I recall, there were also a free or two that made have made their way out to the crowd as well. \u00a0Cheers to the staff!  As for the bar itself, it doesn't seem like it's a truly full bar, as they seemed to be somewhat limited in the alcohol selection. \u00a0However, they seem to carry the bulk of the staples for every bar, so I imagine they are capable of addressing most orders.  Definitely a solid venue, but it seems as though it's catered more towards larger, private parties.",

    "review_text": "My sister's boyfriend and another friend of ours hosted a party here, partially in celebration of a couple birthdays. Judging from previous reviews, there were a few things that I didn't expect from the venue.   1. It was a LOT bigger than I expected. Too much empty space that needs to be filled. While I don't want a meat market, I'd like to party in places that's reasonably packed with people. We had around 60 ish. I would definitely go with 90-100+ for any decent size party. There were 3-4 booths in the back that can fit a good 10-12 ppl each and sitting places everywhere.   2. We ran into a little issue with my coworker's driver license at the bar. His expiration date did not match the day of his birthday, partially because he lost his license recently. Robert (our bartender) said this would be an obvious sign of a fake license. I understand that establishments can get into serious trouble serving drinks to a minor but my coworker is 27 years old. Besides, there is NO where that says the expiration date has to match that of his birthday. I dug this up from the CA DMV site.   Notwithstanding subdivisions (a), (b), (c), and (d), the department may adjust the expiration date for any driver's license issued pursuant to this code. Amended Ch. 1240, Stats. 1992. Effective January 1, 1993.   His ID was legit... so I guess this is just an unfortunate issue when the bar just didn't know any better and err on the side of safety. Nonetheless, that kinda pooped the party. If you're spending that much money, you kinda don't want that happening. -1 star.  3. Never order a Manhattan. Tastes absolutely horrible. However, their other drinks were ok. I would shoot for typical drinks like long islands, mohitos, etc. Shots are fine too though they didn't have any shot glasses.  4. Sound system was too soft for my taste and they wouldn't let us turn it up. Aside from a deep base, I could barely hear any songs. Maybe we were talking too loud. -1 star  5. Too much lighting. It kinds of kills the atmosphere when you can see everyone's faces way too clearly. I like the whole dark, mysterious, faded lighting. It would probably help if you bring some kind of lighting ball (if the establishment would let you)  Ideally, this would be a venue for older crowds? Mid 30s++? I was turning 25 so my idea of partying must've been different than the establishment's. It was more loungy, chatting and sit down than dancing :P.   On the plus side, I got to see a lot of my friends I haven't seen in a long time and met a few new friends of friends. That's always a plus. Good to have friends and I was very happy to see everyone. All in all a good time. I'd come back with different expectations. Live and learn :D",

But with a bar minimum of $1995, one would expect the lounge to be clean. There was a \"funk\" in the air (it kinda smelled like an old mop). We had about 70 guests and we only made around $1200 at the bar,so we had to come with the difference of $800 plus the $200 rental fee.So needless to say, it was not worth it.In addition to this, after signing the contract , the owners increased the bar minimum to $3000.In my opinion, a bar minimum of $1000 would be fair,and not the current bar minimum. You and yours guests will have to do some serious drinking to meet the bar \u00a0guarantee. Plus, the lounge can only hold 100 people tops.",

They have a few booths in the back of the place that makes it look like a strip club that offered sleezier action. Hmmmmmmm...Anyone got a HD cam handy?  The bar had a nice selection. Most notable for me was the bottles of Macallan 12 year single Malt Scotch and Hangar One Vodka. Two names that should be found in more bars in the City. Music was courtesy of Amy's iPod. Weird playlist shuffled together. Rap with Techno with House? Whatever floats her boat, I guess.  All in all I had a great time.

First of all, I do love the fact that this place is only for private parties, so you can avoid having to interact with weird people you don't know and then going home and sleeping with them because it's the least you could do for them buying you a couple drinks, right?  The Crimson Lounge reminds me of hanging out in my friend's basement in high school except everything is red and slutty-feeling including the lights and instead of drinking whatever bottom shelf vodka we could get our hands on (from stealing) from the local Meijer (I'm from the Midwest, this is sort of like a step above wal mart but a couple steps down from Target), there was a full bar in the corner. Goes without saying that since the drinks were already paid for, I got pretty shitty on the free wine because while I don't like to get drunk, I do like to take advantage of a good deal. It's frugality, not alcoholism and there's nothing you or AA or any judge can tell me to make me admit to my drinking problem that I totally don't even have.  At one point my friend showed me the makeout room in the back, which is just this little cubby with padded benches all around and it's really dark. This is the perfect place to go if you're feeling slightly uninhibited from all the free booze and you want to be fingered by a rando stranger/possibly one of your better friends whose face you can't see.

Plus they provided two fans but we didn't need them. \u00a0  Lastly, at the end of the night some people who attended got rowdy and created a scene and a bit of chaos, but the employees were professionals about the situation and were very helpful in finding a solution and kicking people out who should not have been there. \u00a0  Bottom line if you and your friends are looking for a place to have a private party at a bar with great prices and friendly staff...this is your place. \u00a0I will recommend it to anybody I know and hopefully they'll let us back one day to have another private event!!",

The one major downfall is the bar minimum. You need to have 100+ guests to meet the minimum. I spent almost $2000 last time I was there for only four hours. Looking back, I could have just had a great dinner with 10 of my closes friends and I would have still had money left.",

Decor was okay....a little outdated. \u00a0Definitely thought it could have been nicer especially since you have to pay to party here, as it is only available for private parties. \u00a0Seating would have been plentiful for a smaller group. \u00a0One of the booths was occupied by a pile of coats since they didn't have coat check.  There were only two bartenders, but the wait was not super long despite the crowd. And because I was tired from work earlier that day &amp; another birthday party, my butt missed the free drinks hour! \u00a0My rum and coke ($7.50) was kind of watery. \u00a0Oh, how I miss awesome Vegas bartenders, I haven't had a super well made tasty drink since my Vegas trip almost 2 years ago! \u00a0There was food on the table, which was probably provided by the restaurant, but I didn't dare try any since it was so hot in there! \u00a0  Overall, it was nice to have a more controlled setting to celebrate my friend's birthday. \u00a0But I wouldn't recommend having a big private party here, especially for the price.",

There is a $1000+ bar tab minimum in addition to a room fee of several hundred dollars. Both times I've been here, the night has been overshadowed with concerns of being under the minimum and trying frantically to get more people to show up and buy drinks -- talk about a buzz kill. This happened even at a decent sized party of 30-40 people.  It's worth noting that the bar has a very limited selection. They don't have draft beer or high-end tequila which is beyond lame. $5 bottled Heineken anyone?",

We rented out the entire space, and the experience was painless...the bartenders were attentive and friendly, and the proprietors (from Indigo) made sure our transformation from a swanky dinner upstairs into the party-time atmosphere at Crimson Lounge was seamless.
