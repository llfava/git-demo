I have to say that ONCE you do get their attention they're pretty nice.   I've eaten a lot of food here and most is pretty standard--minus the burger with mushrooms and avocado which pretty much rules. There's good and bad things to every meal I've ordered here but it does usually come out quick.  So if your going for outside seating and not great food or service, go here.

We needed sustenance, and we found it. We got the killer booth up front which is perfect for watching TV, ordering food, and a fresh breeze from the entry way. The only problem is that both of us were torn between two items... Harry's breakfast, and the waffles, guess what came next... THE BRUNCH SWAP.  We ordered both items and split the heck out of them. I would give Harry's breakfast a 4/5 (when split with the waffles) and the waffles a 5/5 (when split with Harry's breakfast), I'm not able to rate either item on their own because I'm unsure what my sentiment would have been. Two mimosas later and we were the happiest people ever.  The food came, we ate it, we went to Harding Park to watch the PGA and got great seats on the 17th hole. Boom.",

I was hesitant that we didn't have reservations but we were some of the only people there until around 1330, so don't worry about resy's.   Bottomless belini's only last for 1.5 hrs which can be a blessing or a curse depending on what kind of mood you are in.   I got the Chicken Wrap which was very filling and had a healthy \"dude\" portion of delicious bacon. My gf got the Breakfast burrito with avocado instead of bacon and which she claims (after being there multiple times) is the BEST breakfast burrito in the city!  I highly recommend this place if you want a chill, delicious brunch. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you were trying to do an extremely heavy, 4 hour boozey brunch, but that's why god invented Circa and Stock and Trade!  See you again Harry's!",

We hadn't seen each other in several months, two dear old friends of 25 years who had a lot of catching up to do.  Our server was great about pointing out specials, the happy hour drink prices and appetizers. She made a point of coming back just before happy hour ended too, to check in and see if we wanted to get another round of drinks before the price went up, (\"Absolutely\", we said - as the drinks were delicious and we were really enjoying ourselves and relaxing!).   When it was time to order food, our server was totally patient with my request to substitute barbecue sauce instead of the aioli. Everything came out perfect - our two delicious meals just as we'd ordered them.  Toward the end of our stay, our server appeared and ever-so-politely asked us if we'd mind closing out our tab with her 'cause she was going home. She told us we were welcome to stay as long as we liked - she just needed to close up her part of things. We paid her and thanked her and stayed for what we'd thought was 'a little longer', talking. Occasionally, we'd glance around the room to make sure there were empty tables if anyone new wanted them, but since it was a Monday night and not super packed, there were always a few, so we lingered, talking on into the night.  When we finally got up to go, we looked up at the clock and realized we'd been sitting there for FIVE AND A HALF HOURS. Yep. It was nearing 10:30 PM. I guess time flies when you're having a good time!  What was incredible to me was the hospitality that was displayed to us and so I want to say THANK YOU for such graciousness. I think a lesser establishment might have hurried us along or been irritated at a five and a half hour stay. We were both astonished, when we realized how long we'd been there, and both remarked at how kind it was of the server to be so gracious and so welcoming, even in that fifth hour! I think Harry's did a top-notch job here. So, yeah, thank you so very much. It's nights like these that make going out to eat really worthwhile. And on top of that, when the final bill came, it was surprisingly reasonable too, given how much we'd eaten and drank! I chalk it up to those great happy hour prices.",

Overall taste was a bit more pineapple than lychee, though. - Decent burgers and fries: I wouldn't say they were the best burgers ever, but they are pretty good. I ordered the BBQ one which was satisfying, but I could have used more BBQ sauce.  - Kobe sliders: like this menu options. Mini burgers are always fun! ;-) Only thing was I couldn't tell too much difference between my normal burger and the hub's kobe. :-O  Lowlights (my flip side to highlights): - It's usually super crowded on weekends so it may be hard to get to the bar or get speedy service at your table.

The waitress was very attentive and friendly while she was wade through a sea of about 1,000 people every time she came to check on us....I went more recently for brunch yesterday morning, the bottomless bellini's were pretty stellar and the chilaquiles I ordered were the perfect blend of spiciness and crunchiness. My only food complaint was that there wasn't much so my Sunday funday of drinking led me to another meal pretty soon after buuuut it also wasn't very expensive so not too much of a complaint. The Sunday crowd was a lot less mello but the waitress wasn't as attentive as my first experience. Maybe crowds make everyone more hopping!

Brunch, however, is what I would recommend Harry's for - bottomless bellinis for $14 and some great meal choices make this a good Pac Heights weekend go-to especially if there's a game on that you're there to watch. Only complaint (assuming this is still in effect, haven't been for brunch in a while) is that they timestamp when you get started on your first round of bellinis and limit you to exactly \u00a0two hours of bottomless - understandable considering how aggressive people can get at bottomless brunches but unnecessary for most people (i.e. adults) who just want to relax for a few hours, watch a game and hang out with friends.",

In addition to the burgers, they offer a pretty complete Pub menu including very good corned beef and cabbage and a variety of blue plate specials, salads, sandwiches and lunch type food. \u00a0Service is funky and casual with humor taking the place of competence, and you might even wind up doing shooters with your sweet lass or bartender which is casual and cool. \u00a0They feature a popular and coveted smoking patio which is legal because the area is self service and only the smokers are theoretically at risk. \u00a0The bar gets very crowded in the afternoon and after work with throngs of young urban guys and gals all looking to unwind after a hard day's work. \u00a0They sell a lot of Guinness, Harp and Bass Ale here and they also serve a lot of burgers, so they're doing most things right for their customers. \u00a0Its loud and raucous but a bargain by today's standards. \u00a0This is a place to have fun at lunch and after work, and one of San Francisco's largest St. Patrick's Day celebrations.",

Raspberry mojitos are refreshing. Caesar salad was disappointing - I wanted a big bowl of the stuff, not a plate of a couple gigantic romaine lettuce leaves, and the mac &amp; cheese reminded me of the kind I used to get in a cafeteria when I was young. That isn't necessarily saying it's good or bad...just reminiscent. \u00a0Small bar so if you want a table, wait a while, it will happen.  Update: I went again yesterday, post Saturday night partying...nothing cures a hangover like a good bloody Mary, burger and fries. Amazing. The bloody Mary was spectacular. The burger sooo soo good, the bun is probably one of the best I've experienced.  Update 2: I'm hooked on their Monday night specials, burger, friends, drink = $8. Mmm, mmm, good.",

Service is horrible!!!!! Looks like they only hire bartenders and servers that are females. Don't get me wrong, that's all good, but man, they can be Bitchy!  Scenerio #1: Me: Can I get another Stella? Server: Um....I'm not your server, you should ask her over there.  Scenerio #2: Ordered a burger. Table next to me orders a burger too, after me. He gets his burger first. 10 mins past, still no burger.  Me: Where's my order? Server: Oh, looks like he took your burger. (blaming it on the other guy!) FInally get my burger, which is different from what I ordered. Ends up being the burger the other guy ordered!!!!  Scenerio #3: my friend JT: Is the pomogrante martini sweet? If so, I don't want it. Server: No it's not, it's very tasty. Drink comes.  JT: It tastes like fruit punch. This sh!t is weak! Me: (LOL!)  Better service when you are at the bar, when it's not crowded. I think the best bartender there is Patty. \u00a0Not sure if she's still working there.  Oh well, it's still a spot to get a drink, but I would only go there sparingly now.",

I don't mean to say that Pac Heights chicks are all in great shape and have the same ass -- but, rather, that they were all wearing exactly the same pair of Seven Jeans. \u00a0\n  It's time to branch out, dears. \n  But I made my way to the bar, and patiently waited for a drink. For ten minutes, without even a bartender wave. Apparently the rule is, girls ordering fruity blue drinks get served first. I contemplated reaching over the bar to grab the beer myself. \n  A guy in a button down shirt with multicolored stripes asked if my hair was, like, punk or something, because he was cool with that. Did I like Good Charlotte? It's hard to tell from the front, but I think he might have been wearing Seven jeans as well. \n  It says a lot that I was actually relieved when the booze cruise bus showed up; drunken kids spilled into the bar and demanded drinks. They were as ignored as I was, despite their wristbands, but their exuberance was refreshing. \n  Yeah, ok, the bar itself is gorgeous; but if it's mahogany you're after, head for House of Shields or Hotel Utah.",

The energy was amazing.   Drinks: I ordered a well greyhound and a jack/coke which totaled to about $20 with tip.  Service: When it's crowded, and I mean jam packed, it's better to not keep an open tab. The waitresses were coming by and would not take my order because my tab was not with them. I would have tipped them in cash anyway, but the bar lost my next couple orders and I decided to stay sober (mostly a good decision). It's impossible to weed through the crowd to get to the bar to order the second drink so when i finally got there, I just closed my tab out of frustration. Can't stay mad for too long when those 9ers are doing work :) I was drunk off of that win alone.",

Probably not the same Harry's. She and I both noticed the inconspicuous special drink menu that was plastered on the mirror behind the bar. There were some interesting choices that gave this place some potential until...  1. Pineapple lychee martini - meh. \u00a0Their martini glasses are small to begin with. It's served with a garnish of a single lychee and a HUGE chunk of pineapple offsetting the volume of the liquid for a total of 3 mediocre tasting sips.  2. Mango mojito - \u00a0Waaaay too sweet. \u00a0A glass full of simple syrup would have been better.   3. Hendricks cucumber gimlet - tasty. \u00a0This would be a perfect summer drink with a great balance of tart and cucumber mixed with my favorite gin. \u00a0I think it would be better served in a highball glass on the rocks but what do I know?   The atmosphere wasn't bad for a sports bar on a Friday night - pretty good looking 20-30 something crowd with some random older bar flies and dare I say, cougars scattered throughout. \u00a0An older Caucasian gentleman sitting next to us at the bar struck up conversation by asking me about my ethnicity:  Older man: \"Are you Chinese?\" Me: \"No, I'm Korean\".  Older man: \"Well I grew up in Chinatown\" Me: \"???\" Older man: \"All my friends are Chinese\" Me: \"That's great - is anyone sitting in this stool?\" Older man: \"People used to be very racist back in the day\" Me: \"I bet. \u00a0I remember getting teased when I was in grade school.\" Older man: \"I once told an Irish man to go f**k himself for calling my best friend a chink...\" Me (smiling): \"That was, uh, nice of you\" Older man: \"You're welcome.\" My date: \"Can we go back to Dosa now?\" Me: \"Absolutely, without a doubt, yes.\"  *sigh* Aside from the awkward conversation, it wasn't too bad...1 star docked for expensive drinks served in miniature glassware. \u00a0The kobe burger and fries with truffle oil sounds compelling enough for me to return to give the food a try sometime.",

Tonight served as the perfect reminder.  Four of us walked in for the BCS Championship game. All the tables were taken, but there were a few open spots at the bar. We left our name and headed over for a few drinks. Bar service was quick and painless, although the tap options were limited and the cocktails a bit overpriced for the caliber of the place. Overall, okay.  1.5 hours later, we were next on the list, and a table was clearing out. That's when I watched the hostess guide a completely different group of 4 to the table we should've been given. She then came and told us that \"people will probably leave after the game's over,\" and that we should just grab a table if we see one. Clearly we were also there for the game, and also had little interest in being there once the game was over. By some stroke of luck, a table emptied on our way out, and we took it.  The $11 burger+pint special looked best. Unfortunately, once we managed to get the waitress' attention and began to place our orders, she told us they weren't honoring the special due to the game. That's the kind of nickel-and-diming, baiting-and-switching behavior that comes from only the most dishonest businesses. \u00a0And that was the last straw.  We left immediately, and I have no intention of ever going back.",

It is old school dark wood all nicely polished with brass pole accents to divide the bar area from the raised platform of low cocktail tables behind it. The bar is stocked with beautifully presented shelves of booze and they have those great hard cover bar menus with some eats and creative cocktails that are, surprisingly, not too terribly expensive for this sort of place. That is where the initial attraction begins, but then when you peel away the layers you realize this bar just isn't worth your time.   Just like with dumb hot guy it is nearly impossible to have a meaningful conversation. The DJ is pumping the music so loud you feel dumb yourself by the time you leave. For what? They don't even have a dance floor....unless you ask the ditsy girls dancing on the cocktail tables. They seem to think any wood surface is a dance floor, which works out well for the guys who think a line about cooking you breakfast is the golden key into your pants for the evening.   Harrys, you seem to have such potential, but I left feeling so unsatisfied, which is really too bad since you otherwise could be another place in our circulation of bottomless mimosa brunches.

There is a group of about 8 people in the back who are taking up three seperate booths and no one is \u00a0using one of the booths. \u00a0We asked the waitress if we can sit there and she says they are using it but no one is sitting there. \u00a0Well, that was not what we wanted to hear. \u00a0If they are using it, shouldnt they be sitting there? \u00a0Weird. \u00a0The dudes across the room finally get up and my friend makes a run for it and completely leaves her purse at the bar with me because she fears it might slow her down in her pursuits. \u00a0The two of us are watiting at the bar while Wonder Woman attacks the natives. \u00a0It was actually quite funny. \u00a0I close out my bar tab and we head over to the table where my friend tells us that she almost had a knock down fight with some woman who was trying to get a 4 person table for a party of two, she said she had more people coming later. \u00a0 Well, we were all there now so we took the table. \u00a0I have never actually been in \u00a0a place where you had to fight for a table. \u00a0I really dont think drinks and dinner are as much fun when you have to get your table american gladiators style.  We order some more drinks and food and they were really good. \u00a0I give the place props for the food, it was well done. \u00a0However, the waitress had the personality of a snail. \u00a0We kept trying to be social with her but she was like a robot. \u00a0I get that servers are busy but I loved it when people were friendly to me when I served back in college. \u00a0It reminded me that I existed when most people are just a-holes. \u00a0So I took off two stars for the bad service and the lack of seating. \u00a0By the time we left, there were people standing up in the front waiting for seats and this is a small place. \u00a0I guess my best advise would be to get there early enough to secure a table or you will be fighting gladiator style.",

OK for Sunday football watchin', but the night time scene is.... well I'll get to that. The prices on the drinks are a bit high, but it is Pac Heights so I guess that's to be expected.  In my opinion the bartenders are very nice, there have been one or two that were boring but never mean or bitchy. They're all females, I hear rumor that there was a guy bartender once in a time long long ago, but I've never seen anything but ladies.  The portion of this bar that makes me shudder is the crowd. I don't need to get too detailed, it's summed up here already. If you're the guy type to try to get noticed by frantically strutting your stuff in that newly purchased $250 collared/striped shirt then by all means, enjoy. And don't you fret, there are plenty of over-dressed, over make-uped women who have been drinking fruity cocktails all day that will be more than happy to have you drape yourself on them. Same goes for the \"aging frat boy\" comments, I couldn't say it better myself.  Anyway, if you are stuck in the neighborhood and need some booze then by all means, Harry's has booze. During the early times on Sunday for sports it's fine, just expect the sports crowd. But on a Saturday night? If only I knew how to scare away half the people I'm sure it would be much better.",

Superbowl and March madness were off the hook, def a great place to go to watch the big games. Sometimes we go on Friday nights, which is not so impressive...think older not so attractive crowd, but the pomergranite martinis and goose greyhounds are yummy and it is a low key place if you just want somewhere closeby to drink thats not so Marina-ey.

Its too early in the week to dive into the hard stuff so we decided to stick with beer and lighter cocktails. \u00a0Their mango mojito wasn't the greatest. \u00a0Too sweet and I could barely taste the mango, which I assumed was probably the flash frozen type that was left the thaw. \u00a0The only reason I ordered this drink was because the boobs....uh I mean the bartender recommended it.

Might as well keep walkin'...  The bar fare is simple and pleasing..the Greek salad is a mainstay and yes they serve it with kalamata olives (not black California olives as some restaurants do)...and holey tamales, they are PITTED! (so they get a gold star for that) The lemon drop martini still can't beat the Ritz...but its tasty and after a few, who the heck cares that it isn't that tart...  The battered fish and chips is delish and I recommend it highly, as well as the calamari with that kick ass aioli (spicy-savoury). All in all, we had a great view, nice atmosphere and attentive help.

The place had a slightly older \"Cheers\" type decor, but the tables, chairs, and stools were very comfortable and pretty new; I liked it a lot. The waitresses here are great eye candy so that for me is worth a return trip in the near future. I'm not sure the drinks were discounted, so I don't know how good a happy hour place it really is for cheap drinks. I spent $13 on a Manhattan and Fat Tire. But the food is darn good. I had the best Mozzarella cheese sticks I've tried in a long time. They are big and cheesy served with a real tasty sauce. Once again for all you fellas out there, GREAT LOOKING WAITRESSES!!!  I took away a star because the service was a little shaky and there was a mix-up with the checks. Also, it's not that big, so not a great place for sports games.",

The vibe was definitely holiday and there were some people getting together to have a drink and open packages before heading off to wherever their headed to be with their family &amp; friends for the holidays.   I had a couple of pomegranate martinis which were simply delish. Then we split the Kobe Beef Burger appetizer which had this fantastic melt in your mouth flavor accented by a little Swiss cheese and some thin cut crispy salt sprinkled french fries on the side. It was pretty loud in the bar so we weren't able to talk much but, that was fine because we watched an old Sean Connery James Bond film on the flat screens that are mounted on the surrounding walls.

It was fairly crowded when we arrived, but we got lucky and another group left so we took over their table. They have good french fries and good service.",

The thought alone made me want to hurl, any who....  OK back to Harry's...Harry's was super crowded and after about two hours of waiting we never got a table, but we did get some pretty kick ass Bloody Marys. The Bloody Mary had just the right amount of spice and pickled veggies to aid in the hangover from the night before, despite the douche bag guy next to me trying to throw tequila shots down my throat.  I have to try Harry's again when it is not New Years day and hopefully I will get seated.",

I forgot the name of the bartender with tattoos but she is funny, in a good way.  Their bloody marys are awesome. You can order regular or spicy and get exactly what you want (I mean literally. I prefer regular). The other drinks are okay to try, they have specials. The food is great too. You may bump into some wasted girls, but after a few bloody marys whom do you blame.  Overall I give four stars for this place, only cas there is always a wait time on weekends.",

It's not really a sportsbar but they get all the NFL games on Sunday and get a majority of sports on other days/nights.   The food is pretty good, but the prices aren't cheap enough to where it is any kind of a deal. I've ordered burgers mainly, which are good, and came here on a Saturday morning all hungover and got the waffles which hit the spot with a nice fat screwdriver straight to my dome.   They have bottomless bellinis most sundays, but if you stop ordering food they will cut you off. Once you are cut off, you are normally drunk enough that you will fly into a fit of rage and curse Harry's Bar. I will still come back once football season comes around though.  The bartenders and servers are usually pretty pleasant, and one of the bartenders makes for good conversation, mostly between yourselves when you debate whether her boobs are real or not. Clearly they are not real, and my friend tom is an idiot for thinking they are. If they were real, I possibly would have given this place 5-stars, but sadly it is destined for 4.   Oh yeah and I destroyed their toilet, went back in an hour or two later to destroy it again, and it was clean. So the janitorial crew is top notch.",

They DID however have an eccletic mix on the music, mixing between Kenny Rogers one second and moving onto a little Ludacris or 50 cent the next minute...Hmm...interesting. I guess it's got a little for everyone, eh?  It's fun to people watch there. They have these great little booths along the walls so you can face the people and just watch, point, laugh, criticize, do whatever the hell you damn well please.   I saw some people getting served up some food but I wasn't really close enough to see what they got or if it looked delectable or not. *shrug*  Maybe next time.

Also, it's usually possible to find a place to sit even when busy in a short amount of time (maybe people are wising up?)

Honestly, you won't go wrong. It's a very great go-to bar located on the Fillmore, and it stays open till 2 am. I've literally been here on Monday nights till the very end and have had a blast. The drinks are reasonably priced (it's a full bar), and there's a ton of comfortable boothes/couches all throughout the place. For Sunday champagne brunch, you can get unlimited bellinis flowing in till 3pm I believe, and the menu is yummy, especially the mac n cheese. The baked chilaquiles is probably my favorite brunch menu - very very good. It gets pretty packed on game days and during brunch, so make sure you come early or make a reservation.

You'd think it might be a touristy bar, or daytrippers from the bridge and tunnel crowd, what with the many restaurants in the FIlmore corridor and the little shops nearby. Or at least filled with lovely hotties since Betsy Johnson is across the street, and the Shu Uemura salon down the block.  But it is really mostly a neighborhood bar, and mostly a sausage fest.  The crowd is mostly 30 somethings, with a sprinkle of 20 something drunk dickheads in suits about 5 years out of college time wise, but still in the Fraternity behavior wise. And there is a smattering of 40, even 50 somethings, even a couple of older people who hopped across the street from The Elite cafe, or the Grove next door, or Jackson Filmore up the street. The crowd is mixed but mostly White, mostly relaxed, and usually friendly.  The bar is a great, grand wood bar, related to the famous Harry's Bar in Italy. Harry Denton opened this place decades ago, back when he was the hottest thing in SF bar making, with Harry Denton's Club and the Starlight Room in addition to this place.  They have added several large flatscreens for sports. They used to squeeze in a jazz trio on the weekends, not sure if they still do. They offer some exotic Martinis, and they do serve food. But most people come here only for the meat market aspects of the place, not the meat on a platter.   They still have the elevated table seats for dining, and the classic long counter between the tables and the bar, which is the optimal place to walk through on a busy night to get maximum Eyeball time and Tactile feedback from the crowd seated and standing in the narrow ally.  Service people are friendly and professional. Drinks aren't a complete rip-off. Bartenders are efficient and hustle.   Come here some time and you might get lucky. I know I have.",

That's not to say I wouldn't like Harry's if it wasn't for this deal, but it certainly doesn't hurt there cause!   As far as the bar itself, I like it. It's basically just an old school sports bar, but it's clean, there's nice TVs &amp; the waitresses/bar tenders are nice &amp; personable! Our waitress was a complete doll this past Sunday. We showed up here at about 1:40 and two of us decided to take advantage of the $10 Bellini deal. Knowing that we were pushing it with time, our waitress brought us TWO additional carafe's right before 2:00! I will say that service was a bit slow at times, but the place was packed for football &amp; things certainly could have been worst.   We ordered quite a bit of food as well, including truffle/romano fries, sweet potato fries, nachos, mac &amp; cheese, and mozzarella sticks. The sweet potato fries &amp; mozzarella sticks (they didn't taste too heavy) were particularly tasty. I wasn't a huge fan of the nachos (too much red/taco sauce), but they're hard to mess up entirely and were still decent. Our non-Bellini drinker had Bloody Mary (which she's somewhat a connoisseur of) and said it was tasty!   This was my first time at Henry's and I'll definitely be back (if nothing else for $10 Bellini weekends), but after looking over the menu I'm also impressed with the number of specials during the week. They seem to change things up from day to day &amp; there's a lot of variety as far as both food &amp; drink specials go (there's more than just two or three options). I'm a fan of Harry's!",

    "review_text": "Harry's Bar is my neighborhood favorite for hanging out and enjoying the weekend. Why, do you ask? Well, for one, there are the bottomless bellinis, which is a good excuse for anyone to have champagne at 10am. Secondly, the food is pretty good, especially for a sports-bar atmosphere (during game days, of course). I would recommend the mac and cheese to anyone (except lame lactose intolerant folk) because of how well the buttery, creamy goodness of the cheese complements the al dente pasta. Yummmmm. The nachos are also pretty good, but opt for the mac and cheese or homemade cheese sticks if you're looking to fill a major cheese-craving. The cheese sticks come with a wonderfully spicy marina sauce too, so you can't go wrong with that. Oh right, you want to know about the real entrees like sandwiches and burgers? They're all good. Seriously. I'm not a huge burger fan but the harry's bar burger is quite yummy. I'd suggest coughing up the extra chump change for the sweet potato fries instead of the regular ones - the sweet potato fries are always the first to go at a table, no matter what.  Overall, the atmosphere is great - a real neighborhood place with nice servers and bartenders who clearly know the regulars. They have the full nfl season package and 5(I believe) big flat screens to fulfill your every game need. Oh, and this was an amazing place to be when watching the Giants - especially during post-season. It was so awesome seeing the place packed with orange and black and having the people gather on the sidewalk outside to join in watching the last few outs of every game.  AS for the service - I've been here too many times to count, but really only had 'meh' service maybe a handful of times - and every time was on a crowded evening. Overall, they're really nice at remembering you so they can find you when you're table is ready, and the only people I've seen them be somewhat curt to were loud, obnoxious jerks who had clearly overstayed their welcome on the \"bottomless bellinis.\"",

Apparently it's the only bar within walking distance of this part of town, so I guess one can't be too picky, right?  Harry's is a sports bar from yesteryear. It's old school with an interesting mix of people eating and drinking. On on end of the room, there was a table full of old dudes swapping stories about their glory days, and on the other end of the bar, youngsters were doing shots and spilling drinks on people. Definitely a generational clash, but it takes all kinds to make a bar tick.  One of my default drinks is always a greyhound. You know when you're just approaching a bar, and you get caught off guard by the bartender when you're not quite ready to order? Those are the situations where I just blurt out 'whiskey/soda,' or 'greyhound.' In this instance, I'm beyond stoked that I went for the 'hound, because they use a juicer to squeeze fresh grapefruit juice into the drink. It was, hands down, the best greyhound I've ever had in my life. I'd go back just for that alone!  I sure hope I don't come across as sexist or something, but I've never understood why bar owners choose to put under-skilled, female bartenders with giant boobs wearing next to nothing behind the bar, instead of stocking the place with people who can actually sling a drink. It happens all the time at flashy clubs and sports bars. I mean, I 'get' why it happens... but it just seems counterproductive to me. \u00a0I'd rather get a great drink from a quality bartender than a mediocre cocktail while perving out on some half-dressed college girl any day.  Would love to come back to scope out a football game someday. Looks like it could be a cool spot to enjoy sports on a Sunday, but that's yet to be seen.",

I thought it would be nice for her to get out of the house and have lunch. Harry's is both close to her house and my work so it was an easy choice. \u00a0We sat at an outside table to enjoy the beautiful day ( It was a Fri about 1)We had the little one with us. He was perfectly asleep in his little stroller. We waited about 5 minutes until the waitress came out. She said,\" We can't serve you.\" We have a Cabaret License and therefor we can't have anyone under 21.\" WHAT!!!!!!!!! ( maybe in my more cynical, I really don't want or like kids time I would be okay with this.)  \u00a0This is a Freakin' baby. I was pissed and I really couldn't believe it. My poor friend was so beside herself we ended up at Curbside.   \u00a0 I am really like what the fuck? A cabaret license is for establishments that serve food, drink and entertainment. Not, there can be no babies on the premises.  \u00a0I am DONE with you!",

It took about 15 minutes to get the bartender to even acknowledge us to take our order - and yes we stood AT the bar to place it. During that time she managed to mess up one drink. My friend asked if she (the bartender) wanted a credit card to keep the tab open and was greeted with a blank stare and a \"huh?\" response. From the looks and sound of things, she had been partying quite hard the night before and stumbled from bed into the bar. She had zero personality and clearly couldn't take care of her patrons. All I can think if that she slept with someone to get the job. Since we wanted to have some food and a table opened up, we decided to move to the raised seating area as we couldn't take much more of the vacant bartender.   The food... we ordered the mozzarella sticks and chicken quesadilla. The mozzarella sticks were pretty standard... that is until you tried it with the marinara sauce. There was something odd about it and my friend pointed out it was cinnamon. Who puts cinnamon in marinara sauce??? \u00a0I couldn't even taste the tomatoes and that should be the primary ingredient. The chicken quesadilla was pretty basic. Nothing special about it, but when you're intoxicated it does the job.   Another irritating factor was that clearly Lin-sanity took over the bar as 4 out of 6 tvs were on the Knicks/Heat game. Clearly they didn't realize that there were any other sport or games on. Unfortunately, I got the feeling that if I asked for a channel change it would take 15 minutes to get the bartender or waitress' attention, another 5 minutes to request it, another 20 minutes for them to look for the channel and by that time the game I wanted to watch would probably be over.",

Interestingly, Harry's Bar in *VENICE* was actually where the Bellini was *invented*. Neat-O! \u00a0Keep in mind they they serve traditional Bellinis... not the blended/slushy Americanize version. Expect something with more of a Mimosa consistency.... It's Prosecco and Peach puree.  Food was good. Portions aren't huge, but still very satisfying. I had the Waffle with a cinnamon whip-cream. YUM. The Brunch menu is fairly limited... I'll be honest, I like a lot of choice when it comes to Brunch. They could stand to have another few items to choose from. However, I will also say that everything they do have is made well and presented beautiful. Prices aren't bad either-- you're looking at $10-$15 plates. Not bad considering how 'nice' this place looks.  The place is pretty loud, which was a downside for me. Was actually hard to have a conversation with my friends across the table. But, aside from the noise, it's a really nice 'bar'. Well lit, busy, obviously a popular locale. \u00a0The waitress was attentive and kept our bellinis coming. I don't think we ever had to sit with an empty glass.. Which is a feat considering how busy the place was. Impressive.   I'm definitely going to go back!",

May I please say that a restroom is such a major part of the ambiance of any location and Harry's Bar's women's restroom is one of the best restrooms in the city! Much because of the 1930-40's decor. I especially would like to point out that lovely Barbie Fashion poster in the women's restroom.  The bartender was so pleasant. The bar had a good arrangement of music playing as well. The TV's had a balanced selection of sports showing. We sat ourselves at the bar and ordered the Kobe Sliders with horseradish aioli, onions, and Bibb lettuce. A nice snack to share together with a glass of beer.  I wish I could give this place five stars, but the service wasn't how it was last time. Inconsistent? Maybe just an off day? One waitress and one bartender. They'd talk to my boyfriend and not me? How odd. It felt like a fake smile and nod. Then after a while, it just felt like service with no mean to it.

The bar itself has a bit of an old rustic feel. The dark colors of the interior also makes it somewhat of a darker place.   The cuisine is American and the food is cheap and delicious, making it perfect for those \"morning after a night out\" brunch with your friends. Did I mention that they also have bottomless Bellinis served in carafes? Yes, those are dangerous.  Our waitress was very friendly and was good about refilling our carafe of bellini.

The food/appetizers are not bad - just about what you would expect from a bar menu. \u00a0One of the better menu items are the Grilled Kobe Sliders, which come with a great horseradish aioli sauce, and really could serve as a meal on its own. \u00a0The nachos are massive as well, but make sure you have several people to split it with cuz it's a beast to tackle.",

Our server was fast and efficient -- she was a little brusque but considering the drunken frat/sorority table nearby that was also hers I thought she was handling herself pretty well.  Tasty bellinis to be sure -- when you go for the all you can drink, you're subject to a time limit, however. Seems a little silly to me.

Once over summer for a quick drink, where the service was slow but nothing memorable either way. \u00a0Was in the neighborhood again last week and stopped in for dinner.  It wasn't especially busy or crowded, the two of us sat at one of 5 or 6 empty tables. \u00a0We waited about 10 minutes to order drinks, which might have been a sign of what to come.  We ordered calamari as an appetizer. \u00a0It came out 10-15 minutes later and was hot to the touch on the top, and cool on the bottom. \u00a0The first bite confirmed the squid's heat lamp death combined with being frozen. \u00a0I've chewed on rubber bands that would have gone down easier.  I rarely send back food, but it was inedible. \u00a0The response from our waitress was \"want something else\" rather than \"do you want to have another made\" which kinda makes me think she knows it sucks. \u00a0We went with a safe bet - tater tots - which were good. I ordered a chicken sandwich for dinner, she ordered a wedge salad and soup. The salad and soup came out a minute or so before the sandwich, and both were good.  The chicken sandwich came out and it looked a little, uh, dated. A finger to the chicken yielded not quite fridge-cold but not quite more than luke-warm. \u00a0It did seem cooked when I cut into it, so it might have been sitting around or precooked.. Not sure.. Sending that back doubled the amount of things I've sent back all year to 4. It was that cold.  The replacement sandwich came out shortly after, and was actually cooked property. \u00a0It was good - nothing to complain about other than we're now an hour and 15 minutes into sitting down for a quick dinner. \u00a0I think we sat down during halftime of a MNF game and it was over sooner than we were with dinner. Check time - dropped off without a \"thanks\" or \"sorry for giving you two dishes you had to send back\" or \"come again\". \u00a0I wasn't expecting a free dinner (maybe the tater tots? :-) ) but at least acknowledgement of the mess up would be appreciative.   If the waitress had been a little nicer, maybe just one apology for either mess-up, or even a smile during the 1:30 dinner I'd go back. But not now.

Harry's Bar is a well-known watering hole to the Pacific Heights neighborhood for over 35 years.  George Karas and Rick Howard purchased Harrys Bar from Harry Denton in 2001. Since then the two have a built a reputation for taking over existing bars in San Francisco. George Karas and Rick Howard also own: Brunos (since 2006), Owl Tree (since 2008), Pj's Oysterbed (since 2009) and Eddie Rickenbacker (2012).  Harry's Bar delivers the expected with well to do pacific heights clientele matching the ambiance with its dark cherry wood bar. The bartenders are entertaining and the cocktail menu is definitely something worth trying out. I would recommend Harry's Bar for watching games, grabbing a quick bite, and \u00a0group gatherings.

Four of us went to the dinner to reserve table room and the people next to us at dinner were nice enough to let us take over their table. \u00a0A group of 20 total, we took over the front corner of this bar and danced on tables, broke sooo many glasses and brought in the New Year. \u00a0No one said a word (bar tabs were hefty).   Since the bar is so close to our friends house we have eaten lunch here on occasion as well. \u00a0The burgers are fantastic, salads were fresh, soup tasty, and the selection of beer is good.

French fries are deliciously greasy and great for when you realize you might be drinking more than you should.   Speaking of drinking too much....   A word of caution: Beware the votive candles on the bar, they have a habit of attacking errant strands of hair and igniting said hair. Not that I would know that from first-hand experience. I'm definitely smoother than that. I swear. If it might have been me, I might have been very lucky that the cute boy I was trying to talk to somehow thought the fiery hair was more endearing than anything else.",

However, I will stick to my original assertion that they offer up one of the best burgers in San Francisco, and its reasonably priced at $6.95. Of course, the rub is that's for the plain burger with fries, and where they end up making most of their money I suspect is the dollar you pay for each additional item you want thrown on your burger such as grilled onions, cheese, sauteed mushrooms etc. (not to mention the pricey drink specials). Other bar foods are tasty here as well, but the real draw for me is the quality burger.",

Harry's is definitely one of the places where you've been there and dont that!   Me and my party of 10, came for brunch, the bottomless bellini's has been drawing us to Harry's for the past year and we were the FREQUENT Saturday brunch crew. \u00a0So mind you, we've been a loyal friggin customer to this place.  Me friends and friends of their friends were all in town for the UNR game at AT&amp;T and everyone was hyped up for the pep rally at union square. We came \u00a0around \"10:50\" and waited for the doors to open since for everyone wanted to make it in time to the peprally. The hostess or manager came out side to say, \"I'm sorry but we're not open yet.\" #Ho I think we know that, that's why we're waiting for the doors to open and it's 10:50!  Finally they opened the doors and we sat and waited for the server. A group of 10 showing up that early to this brunch place should've made the bartender(bitch with the tattoo's on) happy. Little did we know, she had the nerve to say we were making too much noise. Bitch isn't this a bar and you do realize people have to talk to communicate right? Ok, one of our friends was on the loud side but still, the bartender of a C U Next Tuesday shouldn't have scolded at us like that. Plus the place was friggin empty!!!  We get our drinks and eventually ordered. More people came in and most of them were out of towners or locals who were also going to the UNR pep rally. So the boys being boys, started a chant for their school team. The bartender with the tattooes chimed in and started screaming at us to shut up and that if we can put it out then we can take it.  Bitch, I'm not even drunk yet. I had like two bellini's down and this hoochie had the nerve to talk back to patrons and my friends. Your job is to serve so how about you pour us more drinks because we're paying for your rent/cocaine habit. I had to hold back my \"keeping it real\" moment until we paid.   The bill came out to 500 dollars btw. Which we all tipped too. I normally would be like, NO TIP for the TATTOOED BARTENDER C U NEXT TUESDAY but my friends, friends were out of town guests who felt bad that after all, she's just a bartender.  OK LET'S KEEP IT REAL. THE FOOD ISN'T ALL THAT GREAT. I'VE HAD BETTER BAR FOOD. BRUNCH - BOTTOMLESS BELLINI'S SOUND LIKE A GREAT IDEA BUT THERE IS A TIME LIMIT. CHECK OUT OTHER GREAT PLACES WHERE THEY DON'T RESTRICT YOU AND THE FOOD IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD!  THE DRINKS ARE OK, AVOID THE TATTOOED BARTENDER!  Overall, Harry's Brunch they like to herd people in and rush them out! Would I go back? HELL NO!   There's so many other great places in the city!",

    "review_text": "I'm not often in Pac Heights, but I've been here a couple of times to meet up with friends. Last night, I watched the UCLA - Florida game here. For a bar with a Hemingway reference, it seemed post-literary. As a sports bar, it was OK. There were several big screens, and you can reserve a table in advance.  The food was good. The fries were crisp and tasty until they cooled. Same goes for the fried calamari. My friends split a burger and said it was good. They have Stella on tap, which is nice.   But in the end, a bar is about the crowd and the vibe, and it's not my scene. Far be it from me to distinguish between the crowd in a Marina bar versus those in a Pac Heights bar. To the untrained eye, both appear to be filled with well-scrubbed young white people who look back fondly on their time in the Greek system of their local university. Maybe the Kappas prefer the Marina, and the Betas chose Pac Heights, I dunno. It's just odd to be in San Francisco and see hardly anyone of color.  Oh, and the waitstaff. They seemed generally cute and friendly, both the women and the men clad in standard service industry black.  In short, this is the kind of bar in Pacific Heights you should go to if you like going to bars in Pacific Heights.  n.b. Ordering PBR in yuppie bars is a provocative act, and while I support the concept in theory, those who don't think they're going to be hassled about it should put down the bong and come back to reality.",

Especially because I had made a reservation and we then had to find somewhere else to eat at 9:30 on Friday night.  The waitress was apologetic but the manager had terrible customer service.

It's a bar and it's near my house, so that pretty much guarantees I'll be spending a lot of time here. In all honesty, it's a pretty average bar. With an excellent burger and a decent menu. And a table section, where you can sit and drink/eat civilly on those days when you don't feel like bellying up to the bar. I myself am a bar-bellier. So that's where you'll find me. If you'd like to send me a drink, please make it a Ruby Red Greyhound.  Phil and I hadn't exhausted our collection of 6th grade jokes by the time we finished brunch and we certainly hadn't reached our full buzz potential, so we went back to my hood to drink some more and hit on members of the opposite sex at Harry's. Harry's is an excellent place to pick people up. If you like cougars and fat men. Or both (hay-ay).  Phil and I like both. So we were in heaven. Or maybe that was just the mimosas getting to us. The bartenders are ok- not rude, not super friendly and the drinks are fine. A little on the pricy side but whatever. Harry's is HUGE (yes, HUGE like Willie) so that means there's always plenty of room for everybody. I like not having to try to stand and drink at the same time :) Bathrooms are clean but there's only one per sex, so that means a line.

    "review_text": "Beautiful, classic bar with THE WORST MUSIC ON REPLAY in the world. Not just annoying. Not just an afterthought. THE WORST MUSIC IN THE WORLD. \u00a0  I have a theory as to why it is so unhip as to be studied unhip. \u00a0Every tune is so loud, and so vanilla, that it's comical. People really don't like the Gin Blossoms, Madonna, and Sheryl Crow or Michael Jackson on full blast. Seriously. Not your mom, dad, unhip banker friend, nobody. NOBODY.  I was in there the other day and this annoying late era Michael Jackson ballad was droning on and on and on. \"Feed the world/make it a better place/ for you and for me/ and the entire human race\" -- that one. The bartender asked, \"Wow. This is annoying. Do you mind if I skip it?\" The guy next to me and I were like, \"No. Please do.\" So she puts another song on. It's upbeat, but it's friggin Madonna. The next track comes on. Michael Jackson again! The dude next to me, total stranger, just starts laughing.  That's how it is in there. It's weird. You know, they have services, Muzak is one, that will provide music mixes for restaurants. These guys bought one. But they bought it back in 1995 \u00a0and they never spent another dime on it. I'm convinced they did it on purpose, as some sort of bet among rest-o people that music is not important. George bet Jay Foster down at Farmer Brown -- a guy who takes the complete opposite approach -- a dinner at Gary Danko's, or something.   It went like, \"Watch, man. I will play the worst music ever and I'll still get tons of customers. People just don't give a shit. \" -- Well, he's right. People don't care. So that's my theory. They have to be doing it on purpose, not just letting it ride.   Because if you think about ti, similar approaches from chain restaurants in shopping malls at least use Muzak that is contemporary. Kanye West and Lily Allen minus the bad words and shit. No, these guys are up to something.  So a big time \"Ouch\" on that front. Othewise, \u00a0great burgers and fries. Great bar. Great location. Kind of a friendly vibe. Nice owners. Nice management. Nice bartenders.  BUT THE WORST MUSIC ON THE FACE OF THE FRIGGIN PLANET.",

It is a short walk from the famed Fillmore theater so I recommend it as a place to get a bite before a concert. \u00a0You'd think it's pretty casual based on the prices but people always seem to be dressed decently nice; I think it is a common place to drop in after work or for a casual date. \u00a0Pretty good/underrated place also to watch sports, although I wouldn't say it is known for that. \u00a0  Lots of yuppies &amp; can slightly err on the bro / douche side at times, but it's not nearly as bad with that as you might find further north on Fillmore like at Greenwich or Union. \u00a0Occasionally can get quite loud.",

He likes to drink a pint or two, enjoys to watch the occasional game and has no idea what Seven jeans are. Thats the type of man I would expect to encounter at Harry's bar. However, if we're judging Harry's based on the crowd and the drinks, it would be more fitting to call it Chauncy's Bar or perhaps Wellington's joint. In other words, Harry's is a watering hole for metro men in pink button downs, popped collars and designer underwear. If you're into that, then this is a great place to meet some gents. They're good looking, no denying that, but they're also most likely drinking a fruit infused cocktail and tucking into their hamburger with a knife and fork, Main topics of conversation will include yachting, their ivy league and dogs.

During those hours, the music wasn't bad, and you could hear your friend sitting next to you. The girls behind the bar were friendly and quick with a drink.  Oh. I remember..... Maybe it was because during peak times (i.e. 6pm-11pm) the single, 45+ Bridge and Tunnel guys would emerge, and gross you out with their special brand of stink. That was it!  Ok, Beware.

Normally, I like going there to meet my girlfriends on a weekend night, it gets busy around 11pm. It's usually our meet-up place, then we go somewhere else, but sometimes we end up having so much fun that we stay the whole night. \u00a0There was a period of time that every time I went to Harry's something funny would happen to me or my friends . . shenanigans are always to be had. \u00a0They play fun music at night, I usually get wine so I can't comment too much on the drinks, except the last time I got a girly martini there I saw the bartender basically pour all red juice and a tiny splash of Cointreau. \u00a0I was pissed, thanks for the $8 juice. \u00a0Reminded me why I get wine instead. \u00a0I have had the same drinks at their sister bar, The Owl Tree, and they've been decent and strong. \u00a0It's always a crap shoot with bartenders though.  Which brings me to my favorite bartender, I believe her name is Marie? \u00a0Long brown hair, pretty girl with none of that shitty attitude so many bartenders can have, she is fast and efficient and sweet and pays attention. \u00a0When I was a bartender I was trained to always be looking, scanning the crowd for who needs something next. \u00a0She always does that, I've seen her multi-task making drinks for different groups of people, handle the cash/cards and be able to serve several people very quickly and without attitude. \u00a0(That may sound like what bartenders are SUPPOSED to do. . trust me so many seem like they're stoned, don't see you, don't care. .) \u00a0Anyway Marie is my favorite! \u00a0I think she may be somewhat new, but she's a very good bartender. \u00a0She doesn't act like she thinks she's all that, unlike many I see! \u00a0  Anyway, that's my pet peev, shitty bartenders, so I love it when I find a great one. \u00a0Most of the bartenders at Harry's are at least pretty fast. \u00a0And they have to deal with drunk idiots like me, so . . Oh yeah and the poor doorman .. he is always sweet even when he has to tell my friend and I to get out of the street when someone dares us to dance with their friend to OPP on Filmore street.",

UNFORTUNATELY, I don't think I'll be heading back until they change their bar policy. \u00a0It was my friend's 30th birthday on 5/5, and when we went to the bar on 5/8 for her bday festivities, and birthday girl couldn't get in because her ID expired three days ago! \u00a0Absolutely ridiculous. \u00a0I understand the importance of an expired ID, but it expired three days ago! \u00a0And she's 30; it's not that she's 22 or 23 where you are unsure of her age. \u00a0  It was horrible, we were a big group (8-10) so half of us went early to get a spot, ordered drinks and basically had to split the party until we finished our first round.

After we did order...food came out very quickly.   What we ordered... *Breakfast burrito (flour tortilla filled with eggs, cheese, bacon and salsa) - simple, but very tasty.  *Turkey sandwich (sounds just blah, huh?)...but this tasty sandwich comes with bacon, avocado and chipotle aioli on sourdough.  *Do yourself a favor and order the garlic fries. DO IT!  *BF ordered one of their many bloody mary's and loved it. Blue cheese filled olives...yes, please!  Next time...I'm getting either their raspberry mojito or one of their champagne cocktails. Or maybe all of them. So much goodness!   Bonus - several TVs throughout the restaurant and awesome daily drink specials. PERFECT place to watch a game or to just have drinks with friends.

Still have not fully explored the Fillmore area even though I live there so I decide to take a walk down the street and check out Harry's Bar. Show up right at opening time and get dibs on first choices for seats. This place got really busy as an fyi as I am sure most places are on this block but definitely check it out towards the early part of opening if you want the easy check in.  The joint is not too large and therefore has limited tables. The menu is the same and not very extensive with only 7 or so items from their \"Brunch food Menu.\" Before I jump in the food, I was pretty stoked to see a bottomless bellini deal which is $10/person for all you can drink which is a solid deal. Although dangerous if you keep drinking as you will feel the buzz quick but bravo for a great drinking deal. After looking through the menu, decide to order the Baked Chilaquiles &amp; the French Toast to get a nice savory vs sweet combo. The food comes on out and the presentation looks fine but after a few bites I figured out why they have the bottomless menu. I am pretty sure people devour their food after drinking so much and think it's awesome because of that buzz but unfortunately, the food here is no bueno. The chilaquiles came out a bit cold and tasted a bit bland with nothing really setting it apart. The French toast tasted fine but again nothing special and actually got boring to eat. Yes I got bored with eating it. So unfortunately not much to write about this spot because there was nothing memorable.  The drink special and the service were good which is what holds this review up but such a shame that the brunch food is nothing good. Will definitely find other brunch spots to venture to in the future.",

By 10 PM, \u00a0 KK and I were at Harry's, comfortably seated at the far end of the bar. \u00a0I knew Tuesdays to be half-off wines - and at the top of the menu of white wines, I spotted the magic words: \"Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc: $49\". \u00a0Excellent.  Not being terribly hungry, but then not being full either, we ordered the salmon toast (smoked salmon atop toast w/ a salad) and a Cobb Salad. \u00a0  What proceeded to happen for the next four hours was nothing short of fantastic. \u00a0We had SO much fun.  That said, we had this amazing night together despite the less-than-friendly service from the bartenders, and the mediocre food (and I'm being generous) from the kitchen.   And I have a major pet peeve: \u00a0restaurants should not serve good wine in small itty-bitty glasses; it kills the drinking experience. \u00a0I asked if they had bigger glasses, and I was informed that they ONLY have small glasses for both their red and white wines. \u00a0DING.  But the Cakebread wine was, as expected, delicious. \u00a0At half-off, the price is actually LESS than what I can get it for at the winery.  With the wine finished, we ordered the well-known (and deservedly so) Bloody Marys. \u00a0It was as perfect as it has always been. \u00a0Throughout the whole night, the \"Cucumber Gimlet\" boldly written on the chalkboard above the bar had been calling my name, so as our last drink for the evening, we finished it off with the gimlet.  As usual, I had a fabulous time w/ KK. \u00a0The evening itself gets 10 stars.  The establishment, however, has some room for improvement. \u00a0A smile or a friendly word or two from the bartender never hurts, and whoever they have cooking in the kitchen needs a lesson re: how to toast bread, where to buy lox, and how to grill chicken (while keeping its juices in) for a Cobb Salad.  We strolled out of here as the last patrons of the evening, perfectly buzzed and ridiculously chipper. \u00a0  VIRTUALLY UNREBUTTABLE! \u00a0:-))",

I'm not sure if there was any vodka in mine. \u00a0Cause I didn't even have a slight buzz after. Not spicy either, even though they supposedly use Absolut Peppar. No Horseradish in it either.

Not worth 8 bucks.

Although, I would think that a bar like this would have more that 3 beers on tap (no Newcastle!), It's huge, and I'm sure they can find room in their cooler for more kegs...the service was, well, I'd say ok. Talk about not smiling or anything. I guess they were pretty quick, but the waitress seemed to not want to be there (who likes to work, but gotta do it!). Also, she added money to my bill. The one she gave me was less than the one she ran my credit card with by like 2 bucks. Not that much, and it I told her to keep the difference as part of my tip...but still, what the hell is that?
