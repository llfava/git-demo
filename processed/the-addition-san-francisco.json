    "review_text": "I recently purchased tickets to see Chrisette Michele at this venue. The show was scheduled for this past Sunday and Friday morning I received an email saying it had been canceled and that I could either receive refund or I could go to a show that night or the following day. Totally last minute!! Given that these tickets were a Christmas gift that I purchased for a friend I chose to go to the 8:00 show on Saturday. Not only did the box office not open until 2:00pm when I called Lisa ( the customer service rep) did not apologize or offer any explanation but replaced my tickets.   The next day I arrived to the venue 10 minutes before the show started only to be standing in line while the person at the desk socialized with someone else who probably should have been working also. This woman explained to me that Lisa made a mistake and comped my tickets and I needed to pay again because the money had been refunded to my account. I asked her when the refund was issued and she told me \" I don't no I'm not a banker\" So I stood to the side to check my account and of course nothing had been refunded nor did I have any record of this transaction. So she went from asking me to play for both tickets to saying well can you pay for one ticket... then she \" said you don't even have $30 \u00a0She then blamed it on \" TicketFly\" for issuing a refund with out talking to them first and told me that she was not going to argue with me. So I took the tickets only to be sitting in horrible seats.   I did not appreciate the lack of good customer service. Furthermore had the environment been different I would have had some choice words to share with her. I've been to several events at the former Yoshi's and had a great time however it is not likely that I will return to The Addition. I will be filing a formal complaint.",

The music was fantastic, the venue is great, and the staff was very nice and accommodating, but I'm being a little generous with 4 stars because they just changed owners and I want to support them. We had a couple major complaints that will hopefully be addressed:  - They water down the beer!! We got a couple anchor steams, which I've had hundreds of in my life, and it's never tasted so watery. I thought maybe it was just the keg, so I ordered a Guinness - same problem. If this isn't fixed, I'll just refuse to order to drinks here in the future, and they'll be missing out on additional revenue.  - The set was really short. It was supposed to start at 8, but didn't start until 8:30, but then they ended promptly at 9:30 because they had a 10 o'clock set.",

We were lucky enough to see Jane Siberry's Holiday Hoes &amp; Hosers show. I guess I have to give The Addition props for booking her. The show was phenomenal.  Service was great. I love being able to order food and drinks and actually have someone bring them to me instead of standing in line at a bar. The staff was very attentive and helped us take care of the bill very discreetly during the show.  Parking in the lot across the street is extremely convenient.   Before the show I had a cup of lobster bisque. It was tiny, but very good.   I keep watching the list of upcoming shows. I haven't seen anyone else that would entice us to drive into the city, but I'll keep looking and we will definitely come back for the right artists.",

Gone is the Japanese food, which is kinda a bummer but they still have got some pretty decent eats here. Our table shared a bunch of fries, and my friends got a salad and a burger. I kinda felt the Japanese food at Yoshi's made it more unique, and also was a nice little shout out to the nearby Japantown, but oh wells, Yoshi's no more.  The venue itself is still totally the same. It's small enough so that you've got yourself a great view of the performance from wherever you sit. The servers come by often enough without being a bother to your music enjoying experience.   In all I had a pretty good time here at The Addition. I realize that the re-branding might strike the wrong chord with some people, but hey it's still great music in an intimate venue. Not much can beat that.",

Yoshis was perfect from the vibe to the menu selections and it was great to go between Oakland and SF so you could mix it up a bit. The lounge/restaurant area just seemed so desolate, definitely not what I remember from before. The menu just seemed basic, nothing to jump up and down about. Hopefully they can get it together soon....",

This place is nothing like the old Yoshi's. No atmosphere, no decor, and the menu was limited. The wait staff was very pushy about closing our tab as we were having a good time. The b'day girl almost cussed the waiter out about his pushy attempt to get the bill paid as we were eating and toasting. I see why they closed down this week...hopefully the next venue will raise the bar!",

Minus stars: - Wished the performance was longer. - Wished there was an opportunity to meet Poncho or at least buy some of his CDs. - Waitress could have done a better job checking in on our table. - Staff needs to do a better job regulating/removing patrons who use flash photography. During the show, a lady in the front was taking selfies and multiple pictures on her phone with a blinding LED which was very disrespectful to the performers and to the rest of the patrons trying to enjoy the show.

Lastly, if you can't get around to getting checks on the table and collected before the performance is over, then don't make announcements telling people to clear out!! \u00a0I hope that many people walked out without paying because your disorganization caused it! \u00a0One more thing, hire waitresses that can carry a tray of drinks without dumping these on patrons backs! \u00a0Ok-last thing- the online ticketing system probably affects your ticket sales. \u00a0It has a lot of glitches and limitations that are annoying. \u00a0Thank you for allowing me to vent about my ruined evening; Chrisette Michelle was awesome though!",

Today I received an email that the show was cancelled and gave us an option for a refund or attend another show(same artist/different day). I reply to the email stating how inconvenient because I had great seats and my schedule didn't really allow adjustments.  I called in to select my seats for tonight's show at 10pm... to be seated 6 rows back. I would have rather they reorganize by when you purchased your tickets or offer some type of incentive regardless of the flop you may have.  The customers that are calling in will not be happy, although she helped me by securing my seats, she didn't apologize for the inconvenience, and she forgot my name and when I told her again, she said oh yeah. Maybe go through a customer service class and practice empathy.  I expect some type of incentive for the inconvenience...but I'm sure this business is more focus on filling the seats for this weekends show. They are money focused, not client (customer service) focused...but in order to fill seats you have to keep your customers happy. After tonight's show I will not return to this venue, I refuse to invest in a business who does not care about their customers.  Post Experience:  Service: Wasn't great Initially until we tracked someone down to serve us. I assumed the \u00a0person who was waiting the couple at our table would serve us as well, she didn't even look at us even on our attempt to flag her down.   Show: Was Amazing &amp; Free, I was given a refund.  Overall: Satisfied!!!",
