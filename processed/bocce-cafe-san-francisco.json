Parking around this area is usually always difficult, but if you have patience, people are always coming and going.   The place itself is very spacious, and when we went for dinner, it was also pretty empty, so I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. The food was good and portions were large enough to share a plate between two people. We had the Fried Calamari (7.95), Salmon Fettuccini (11.95) and Meat Lasagna (9.95) and Steak.   I knocked off one star because the service was rather slow. But other than that, no complaints. I probably wouldn't come back here because there was nothing that screamed \"different\" from any other restaurant. But if you have never been here and are in the area looking for some good Italian, go ahead and give them a try. The lasagna was our best dish.",

If you want to eat good food, and not be saddled with the pretentiousness of many other restaurants in San Francisco, this is a good place.   I just had lunch here this past saturday after a wedding in North Beach. There was 5 hours between the ceremony and reception, so I needed a place to grab lunch. Although I initially expected to eat with a group of 5, it ended up being a group of 30. The service staff of Bocce Cafe didn't blink an eye, although I'm sure they were expecting a pretty laid back lunch. In any case, the food was good and service was excellent. The gnocchi my wife got was spot on and my penne alla vodka has the most tender cubes of salmon. Their pasta dishes are on the over-dressed side, so perhaps not \"italian-authentic\" but definitely \"italian-american authentic\".  Overall, Bocce Cafe will not have the best food or wine in SF (there's tons of competition), but as I said earlier, if you want good food in a cozy enviroment without the pretense, this is the place. Their bread is soft and warm, which is perfect for dipping into the balsamic vinegar and olive oil (and it's good vinegar and oil, no skimping here), \u00a0and the prices are reasonable (between $10-$15 for most pasta dishes, $15-$25 for specials and meat entrees). They also have valet parking, which is of tremendous value in North Beach.",

It's tucked away in an ally, and if you can find your way into the secret gaurdan then you'll be rewared with this charmingly oppen dinning experence. There is a live band playing obscure B sides from the 70's and 80's that almost sounded like they where popular are some opint in time, but nothing you'll be singing along to at your table, maybe thats the point... The entire dinning experence was very unique for SF standards. I supose it was a nice change of pase, and definatly a great place to come with a big group of people.  The pricing is totaly reasionable, and in return you'll get food that fits that bill, nothing thats going to knock your socks off but undeniably good food thats calls for a return some time.  After getting over the initial shock of this large oppen room with masive exposed beams of wood, and as my eyes started to drift down to that walls and art, i could not help but notice how cheep everything here was. One table to another it seems like i was taking a trip around a flee market viewing different old womens dinning sets. The art reminded me of old 60's food advertisements, though in italian i still felt like cheap prints of decent \u00a0art work would have cost them the same. just sothing about seeing a picture of risotto that looked nothing like mine that kinda made me want to stop eating. Non-the-less good food, good envirment, and ok service, make me think that if they idea of going back here came up i would not object.",

I had a party of about 45 people here for my post-City Hall wedding luncheon. We sat out on the patio, and we had such a great experience.   First off, it is extremely difficult to find a place in SF willing to accommodate such a large party unless you're closing down the place and spending a minimum (actually, more than maximum for us!). Bocce was one of our top contenders at my cousin's suggestion. I came here a few months early with my now husband and cousin to order a LOT of food and scope out the place. Our first visit was good, despite the leaky roof in the rain. I recall that a few dishes were delicious (calamari palermo as an appetizer was particularly wonderful!) and a few were just OK. But based on the awesome service we got, I booked it for our luncheon.  From beginning to end, they helped make our event perfect. They closed off the patio for just us and they let my cousins drop off things a few hours in advance. They even refrigerated our large cake at no extra expense. They had plenty of servers to accommodate everyone, though I do remember them running out of bowls (a little strange). I pre-ordered all the food and had them serve it family-style in big bowls, rather than on platters with veggies on the side, so people would share a bit of each course. The meal was well under what I expected it to be. I definitely wasn't paying attention to how many of each entree came out, but they were very honest and on top of it. No waiting at all between courses. They even brought a glass of champagne on the house to my husband and me :)  Without hesitation I recommend Bocce Cafe for large parties. Enjoy the Italian food and let them make your event worry-free!",

Everyone knows it's your duty to make sure this list is addressed or you are arrested and the city raises your taxes. So while checking North Beach off, I figured we should score some food.  While wandering the 17,000 Italian restaurants, you'll notice Bocce Cafe by the 'enchanted garden path' gated entrance. I can't think of a better term. The garden patio, a scruffy little cat, sun, butterflies. It's like eating lunch in a Disney movie, the old school ones. Like circa Lady and the Tramp. I half expected little blue cartoon birds to fly down and sing on the table.  Three star food for me. The marinara was good, but I could find similar or better in the vicinity. \"However\" I remind myself, \"it isn't just about the food.\" If the food were to man up I'd go five stars mostly because of the back patio. Sitting outside while eating and drinking wine is exactly what I want going on during a warm day, we were here just plain relaxing for like 2 hours.   I would grab wine on the patio, just might not sprint back for food. I'll probably give it another shot, maybe I was just unlucky. If I could see cartoon birds though, that'd be even better.",

Got to love all these delicious Italian meats. \u00a0  For our main course, we had the option of choosing either the stuffed ravioli, meat or veggie lasagna, or 1 of 5 different types of pasta (fettuccine, linguine, penne, rigatoni, or spaghetti) with 1 of about 10 different sauce options. \u00a0I was thoroughly impressed w/ all the different choices of sauces. \u00a0They ranged from a tomato and garlic sauce to alfredo, pesto, or carbonara, to feta, fresh tomatoes, and olives. \u00a0I had a hard time choosing which one would compliment my penne perfectly, but ended up choosing the basic tomato and garlic sauce in the end.   I omitted dessert after induldging at a wedding in Florida all weekend, but had the opportunity to try the gelato, which was wonderful, but so thick that I would actually probably constitute it as custard.",

I started secretly hoping to be greeted by Eve, wearing a fig leaf, and eating an apple while I tempted her with my snake. Instead, I was greeted by an Italian guy who looked fresh off the pages of GQ Magazine.  Boner time was over.  I got a great seat out on the back patio under some fig trees, which made me feel like I was back in my Garden of Eden fantasy. I ordered an Italian beer which was incredibly cheap, and appetizers that GQ guy agreed to tweak a little for me, as I requested.  Then Eve walked in.  She got seated directly in my line of vision, and was wearing the TIGHTEST fig-leaf green dress I could ever imagine. Her breasts were perfectly poised to catch glimpses of the sun rays that filtered through the trees, and glimpses from me.  The remainder of my meal was a blur of relatively good, inexpensive Italian food, beer, and 2 incredible melons that kept emerging from the flimsy green dress that was across the patio.   Here's the breakdown: 1 star for atmosphere.....the concrete jungle's secret garden. 1 star for great service.....GQ style. 1 star for cheap eats.....shared with cheap beer. 1 star for Eve.....or the hot waitress that served her.  I need to apologize to the man inside the restaurant. I wasn't staring at you through my entire meal.....I was using the reflective window between us to perve on Eve without getting caught.",

The food is somewhat overpriced for what you get. The two pasta dishes I had were somewhat bland in terms of the sauces. If you go on a busy night, don't plan on having much conversation with your guests -- between the band playing and the high volume of people in the room, its hard to communicate. In general, I would have expected a bit more of what could be a gem in the area.",

I found Bocce Cafe tucked in a walkway and was immediately captured by the ambiance meant for romantic dates and close family gatherings! The lighting is a bit dark, and there is a tree motif going on with tree branches scattered around the cafe and ceramic flower detailing.   Unfortunately, the acoustics of the cafe means that it is a pretty noisy place. We had a large group sitting next to us, and their volume made our table have to yell to hear each other. Also the band that they have is a cute idea, but not for a small place where it is hard to hear.   We were served with fresh garlic bread and an olive oil &amp; vinegar dip. Delish!!! The prices were decent, when comparing with other nice Italian restaurants around the area. My table ordered the Spinach ravioli, Portabella &amp; Chicken penne, Caviar pasta and a calzone.   In short, the pasta was very average. Nothing special at all. However the calzone was \u00a0Amazing! It was huge (enough for 2 people to share) and delicious. Also it was one of the cheaper menu items!!!",

This is a good place for an inexpensive dinner with friends, not a good place if you want to impress a date.  So why 5 stars? My now-wife and I had our rehearsal dinner at Bocce Cafe this past July on a Friday night.   As wedding planning goes, this was probably the easiest thing we had to do. The manager Ramon was extremely easy to work with. Our group was about 80 people including a few children and a couple babies. This was a few too many people to sit outside (which in July in SF would have been too cold anyway) so they gave us a nice sectioned off area inside. I talked to Ramon on the phone twice and came into the restaurant once to solidify everything. The whole process was really easy. We picked out a few menu items and pre-ordered appetizers/salads/wine.   Because it was a Friday, there was a band playing. Most of our guests thought we had hired them, which was nice. Overall I think the price came to a bit under $35 per person including tax/tip, and we had a reasonable amount of drinking going on. This was about half of what I had budgeted.   Anyway, I was really happy with this choice and would highly recommend it for a large group like ours.",

    "review_text": "Suburbanites looking for a traditional North Beach dining experience need look no further than Bocce Cafe. More than a cafe, it's roomy inside, it has lots of patio seating in the back, and it has a menu rivaled only by the Olive Garden in its predictability and blandability. OK, maybe that's not completely fair since Bocce does offer non-OG dishes like cioppino and mussels bordelaise. But it is kid-friendly which is why you are likely to be among boisterous families with gaggles of ADD monsters who would rather be on their Playstations. If you can get past the anarchy, you can find decent Italian food here.  Bocce also has the benefit of being slightly off the beaten track as it sits on a residential block on Green right off Grant. Truth be told, Jamie W. and I ended up here only because the new Original Joe's was an absolute zoo, and we didn't feel like being squeezed into a bar table an hour later. Bocce at 5:30PM was the exact opposite - near-empty and overstaffed. We were hungry, so we shared a couple of appetizers right away. And since it was before 6PM, we could take advantage of the fact that they were half-off. Woo-hoo. Jamie ordered the $9.95 Combination of Fried Calamari and Fried Mozzarella Cheese with Tomato Sauce (see photo). Pretty average.  I went with the $8.95 Prosciutto Melon, which was hamstrung by unripened cantaloupe slices despite the salty-tasty prosciutto wrapped around them (see photo). However, given the discounted prices, we didn't feel we had that much room to complain. Our risk-averse entrees were marginally better even though we did steer away from the pricier temptations on the menu. Jamie simply had the $10.95 Spaghetti &amp; Meat Balls, which was surprisingly sparse on the vermicelli but generous on the meatballs (see photo). The sauce was also a tad watery, but Jamie didn't seem to mind as he devoured it in near-record time.  I ordered one of the $9.95 Bocce House Pasta Specials, Linguine Carbonara, which was loaded with cream and bacon bits (see photo). What's to complain about with such artery-clogging goodness? I decided to undercut the creamy indulgence with a $4.95 side of Beef Meatballs (see photo). Two big, meaty spheres bathing in a pool of tomato sauce. We were full and considering a return visit for the live music they have on Friday and Saturday evenings when apparently a jazz combo plays. It wasn't the finest meal we ever had in North Beach, but we could have definitely done a lot worse.  FOOD - 3 stars...standard-issue Italian for big families AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...spacious for a North Beach venue, something to consider for your next big get-together SERVICE - 3 stars...good at first and then drifted as more customers trickled in TOTAL - 3 stars...mangia at your own discretion",

    "review_text": "My sister recommended this restaurant when I was trying to find a nice restaurant to celebrate and early Christmas with my girlfriend.   Food: Obviously the most important part of the restaurant is the food. I thought the food was fairly decent, although I wouldn't say out of this world. The portions are generous for the price we paid.   Environment/Setup: I must say the restaurant is deceptive right from the beginning. The entrance to the restaurant, in my opinion, doesn't do the inside justice. As you pass the valets at first glance it seems like you're walking through a garden. But as you walk you'll see the restaurant to your right. Although I do like the setup of the restaurant, it was confusing in the beginning. There was a table right next to the entrance of the restaurant but was empty with just a book opened up. But after a while no hostess approached us (or the group in front of us). So I noticed two waitresses standing at a table in the middle of the restaurant, I approached them and they seated us (I guess there was a bit of confusion). The lighting of the restaurant wasn't too bright which was what I was hoping for, although considering the amount of light, there was a lot of noise going around. But you have to expect that when there's large groups there. Overall the place was setup to create a more authentic Italian feel, but it's nothing I haven't seen from other Italian restaurants I've been to.  Service: I don't think there's any complaints with the service, waitresses were responsive and the food came out quicker than we thought, which was always good considering there were two large groups dining there at the time. Usually when you're at an Italian restaurant and there's large groups, you tend to wait a little bit longer for your food and service.   Parking/Price: For parking, well you're in North Beach you can't expect much. I'll admit it took us a while to find parking (at least for free) but hey you're in North Beach and it's going to be like that for every restaurant you go there. The restaurant itself is located on the edge of a residential block, so parking on that side becomes extremely limited, although everywhere else there's a decent amount of parking. But I can tell during the day, it's gotta be hell trying to park around this area, so I guess we got lucky since it was nighttime. For pricing considering it's North Beach I was expecting a much larger bill, but for the amount of food and the ambiance of the restaurant, it wasn't bad.  Overall I thought the restaurant was good but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I was trying to figure out whether to give it a 3 or a 4 but I'm going to give it a 4 for now, because it's usually better to review after you've been to the restaurant more than once. But I do plan on coming back here sometime. While it doesn't make my top restaurants, I would still recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

The waiter asked if we wanted an outdoor seating or indoor, I asked if there were heat lamps outside (since SF is always cold at night) but there weren't so we took the seats nearest to the windows. The place looks like it needs major dusting and a new coat of paint. Also, what is that HUGE AC/Heater/Generator thing that's dangling in the middle of the room on the ceiling??   The waitress was nice, but she seemed a bit uninformative of the menu. \u00a0We asked \"what must we get here?\" She pointed to the \"share\" item for two, not explaining why... it didn't look appealing so we didn't get it. \u00a0Another waiter was right-by so we asked him what's good. \u00a0He seemed to know what he was talking about. He recommended the grilled portabello mushroom with blue cheese and the linguini pescatore. \u00a0Sounded great, so we ordered that with a side of meatballs as an app. And two glasses of wine.   First, the bread comes out with a side of balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The bread tasted old, but we were hungry so we ate it anyway. Our wine tasted spoiled, so during our dinner we asked when was the bottle opened but waitress wasn't sure and she was kind enough to replace our wines with a newly opened bottle. The wines were so much better! When our meatballs came out, the texture was very mushy (like mashed potatoes), yuck! The portabello mushroom with blue cheese came after, this was so awful, the whole entire plate was drenched in a type of honey/balsamic sauce that was so over-powering then combining that flavor with melted blue cheese... I was disgusted. I wasn't looking forward to our seafood linguini, since our apps and wines were terrible. We shared the seafood linguini, it was nice of them to split it into two bowls for us. Hoping there were some fresh grated pepper and Parmesan but nada. The linguini were eh.. but the mussel tasted also OLD... Had a few bites and I was so DONE!  Lets just say I wished we went to Olive Garden instead. Oh and my boyfriend went and grabbed a pizza after.   1 Star for the nice waitress but it ends there.",

The four of us had four glasses of wine, two appetizers, four salads, four entrees, two desserts, and three coffees for about $30 a person after tax and tip. That's just unheard of for a decent meal in a North Beach restaurant.   Have to say, however, that we tried dessert this time and I wasn't all that impressed. We tried the \"Black Magic\" chocolate cake and Bocce's Tiramisu. I'd pass on both. Head to Naia on Columbus for gelato instead.",

The waiter, Jacob, was very respectful and patient with the girls (to help I gave him a list of all their orders upfront). He insured they had everything they needed or wanted. He even arranged for a special dessert and birthday song from the very enjoyable duo they have which sing classic dinner music. This is a very interesting and pretty restaurant. Being off the beaten tourist path is a little quieter and architecturally interesting. The food and service was very good also. As a native San Franciscan, I didn't know about this place until I found it on the net and was very pleased with the results. We look forward to going back there as a family. Very enjoyable, not to mention, they have valet parking for only $10.",

It was nothing special but it was good \"home style\" Italian cooking. For the three of us, it cost about USD100 plus tip which was pretty good value-for-money.  The decor is nice, the staff friendly and the food and drink selection is good.  The only downer was that they had some musicians playing during during dinner and they were a little loud making conversation difficult. There were a few other loud tables and the stone floor bounces the noise around so that was a little irritating.   It's also in walking distance of lots of great bars for before and after.

It's not gonna blow your mind away, but it's better than average, for sure. This place never lets me down.   \u00a0 \u00a0 Bocce Cafe is the girl-next-door, to other trendy north beach restaurants being the done-up quad girl in high school that you wanted to date, and then when you did you found out that she's just shallow and doesn't offer any substance and dating her was a waste of time and money, and you are now much happier that you're dating a nice girl-next-door. Does that make sense?   \u00a0 \u00a0 Anyway, Bocce Cafe has a nice outdoor patio that I can't wait to try out during the summer, and a fun atmosphere inside with live music on weekends, and comfy couches to dine at.

Five women out having a good time, in the fall, in The City, how could it get any better? I'll tell you how...walk into Bocce. If you like that rustic feel with boothy benches and high ceilings and \"italian\" atmosphere, this place'll do it. My one single complaint? It was noisy. A lot of stone and the high ceilings made for poor acoustics.   However, the gnocchi more than made up for it. The wine didn't hurt either. I love gnocchi, and I've tried to make it from scratch, so I KNOW how hard it is to get right. It is definitely one of those things that you have to work at and practice making. So, to get a bowl full of gnocchi that were tender and light and fluffy was very nice. We split some bruschetta too, which was also delicious. We might've had something else, but obviously these two things were the sticking points for me.   My friend actually asked me if I liked it because she didn't want to see a bad review of the place. Nothing bad here! I would go back in a heartbeat. And I would drink wine, eat bruschetta and nosh on gnocchi.   Thank you ladies for a wonderful evening!",

For entree, I had the Penne Portobello (which was absolutely delicious and only $15). They also allow you to BYOB but charge $12 corkage fee FYI.  We were just VERY annoyed with the service (or lack of). From the time we sat down, 7:10-15pm... we literally sat there for 1 hour and 20 minutes and still did NOT receive our food. We ended up having to take our entree to go because we had other obligations. When we finally walked up to ask for the check, it took another 20 minutes to PROCESS the check. We actually ended up walking up again to hand over the credit cards and the check. The whole paying process alone took almost 25-30 minutes!!!!!

Our usual favorite for weekend breakfast was packed, but I saw a sign outside this place that said they were now open for brunch Friday-Sunday, with a complimentary mimosa. So in we went. We stopped in shortly before noon. The place was completely dead, but it sounds like they just started to do the brunch thing this weekend, so likely few knew about it.  My husband got the mimosa, and I got plain orange juice (we were charged for neither). The mimosa was \"ok\" per the husband, until he got to the last bit - extremely syrupy. That was my experience with the orange juice, too - like it was made from (bad) concentrate and they didn't use enough water. It was gross - I couldn't drink it.  Husband got the turkey omelette with the \"fingerling potatoes\" and ordered a side of pancakes. I got the smoked salmon benedict with the \"fingerling potatoes\" as well. Why the scare quotes? I'm not sure if they normally serve fingerling potatoes and were out or what, but what they served was french fries. (Obviously frozen bag french fries, too. Not terrible, but not at all what we ordered.) Husband reports that the flavors in the turkey omelette were seriously weird. He said it wasn't so much bad as odd, but he also didn't finish it (rare for him). He didn't receive the pancakes he ordered (and we were not charged for any).  My salmon benedict was also disappointing. They somehow managed to both overcook the poached egg (resulting in hard yolks) and bring it out cold (save for a tiny bit in the center of the yolk, which was lukewarm). The hollandaise and the English muffin were also cold - aside from the fries, there was nothing hot or even warm on my plate.  The service was not as bad as the food, but could use some ironing out. For example, they brought out a basket of fresh bread just as we were finishing what we ate of our food (and promptly took it away when they cleared the plates only minutes later). For part of the meal, we were the only people in the restaurant, and at no point were there more than three tables occupied; even still, the servers seemed very uncertain what they were doing.  It almost got points for the rich decor, the trellis walkway, and beautifully lush patio. It is a pretty place, and uncommonly large compared to most San Francisco eateries I've visited. The mood created by the decor was kind of killed by the combination of odd Italian music (I like a lot of Italian music, but this was weird) and a loud football game one of the servers turned on a few minutes after we arrived.  So... pretty, but I can't see any reason we'd ever return. There's plenty of pretty in San Francisco.",

All natural wood structure, high ceiling, decorated by strings of garlics.  Maybe because I was concentrated on the decoration, I didn't realize there was no one came to seat us. But now when I think about it, it's us who went to find the waitress to seat us after stood there for some time.  It was great to be able to stay at green-covered outdoor area that day. It brings you peaceful mind and coolness. It's romantic no doubt, except that there were some really loud people. But they have the right to be happy and loud enjoying the nice place too.

No wonder we didn't get all of our appetizer.   When the food came, I thought it was appropriately priced for the most part. I had the pasta alla vodka with salmon. The salmon was a little over powering and i could not really taste the the vodka sauce. Portion sizes are good. \u00a0  After all that this yelper was gonna give this place a straight 1 star, but after requesting to see the manager this place is gonna have to throw their Hail Mary!   The manger empathized with us and volunteered to take care of everything himself. He personally cooked our guest a free meal. gave everyone free dessert (tiramisu) which was probably the best tasting dish and also removed the automatic gratuity tip leaving us the flexibility of giving them whatever we think they deserved.  its hard to recommend a place if you didn't really have a good experience from it.

We had a group of 17 and they had ample space to take all of us (and not only because we were one of two parties in the restaurant). The service was great and very quick and gracious.   The first thing that struck me was definitely the price. VERY reasonable for a restaurant in North Beach. And the food was as good as any other N.B. attempt at Italian. The little \"enchanted forest\" entryway is pretty charming, and the decor is very warm. I had the bruschetta and shared the tri-color pasta for two (marinara gnocchi, pesto ravioli, and fettucini alfredo a la the italian flag) with a friend. Yum on the bruschetta, pretty yum on the pasta (a little blandish but definitely comfort food). Great bread, as well.   Parking = a bitch. Other than that, its a fun place.",

The pizza is one of the best things to order huge and only $8.95 to $9.95. The bread is warm and fresh and the service is pretty good but it wasn't busy when we were there. The place is cosy and has a Olive Gardenish feel to it. The best thing Bocce Cafe has going for it are the low to very reasonable prices. It has to be the best value restaurant in North Beach. The ( pick a pasta and any sauce deal for $9.95 ) and that's lunch or dinner is packing them in.  Even the Rib eye Steak dinner with pasta is only $18.95. Try and get a plate of pasta for under $10.00 anywhere in North Beach . Most restaurants charge $18.00 to 28.00 for a plate of pasta (Mama Mia.)

I ended up ordering fettucini pesto pasta with smoked salmon, mushrooms, and capers. It was actually quite good. The pasta was piping hot and extremely flavorful, although a tad salty.   One of my friends ordered the gnocchi, which I highly recommend. Fluffy pillows of deliciousness bathing in a creamy pesto sauce. The meal came with some soft fresh bread that I couldn't help but dunk into her sauce a few times.  Our table was right next to the door leading to the patio in the back. We received a lovely cold draft every 5 minutes or so, since it was about 45 degrees outside, but it wasn't too annoying. Our server seemed kind of rushed at the beginning of our meal. He actually turned around to leave before we were completely finished ordering and later we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled. He was still very friendly though.   Food came out fast. Reasonable prices. Cozy spot good for groups and families. I left full and happy. I'm a bit iffy about coming back since the majority of the menu didn't entice me, but from what I did end up eating, everything was delicious.",

    "review_text": "Last night my buddy Adam came up from Stanford to hang out with me in my new hood: Chinatown/North Beach/Nob Hill. I hadn't explored much around the area since: I was wrongly introduced to North Beach as the city's answer to night life when I was a freshman at Cal, it becomes clogged with frat and post-frat/Marina boys on the weekends, and my partner in crime/love isn't usually down to go out during the week. \u00a0 I asked Adam where he wanted to go and he suggested Bocce as \"not too expensive and pretty good Italian food\". When he described the leafy alley that you walk through from the street to the restaurant, I thought I had been there years ago -- confirmed when I saw said alley again -- and I remembered it as good with a nice patio...but was also taking into account my having been 17 at the time and remained yelp-worthily skeptical. Bocce was alarmingly empty but we chalked that up to our early dinner hour: 6.30. The interior is painfully decorated, with painted ceramic foliage all over the walls, silk flower arrangements, and smashed couches lining the place. We sat at a couch, despite the ugliness factor.  The menu was pretty thorough, offering lots of seafood pastas, some expected oven dishes, and a few meat and poultry items. I try not to order meat in places where I think it will disappoint me, and Bocce was sized up as such a place. I ordered fettuccini with calamari and marinara sauce and a glass of medium-priced chianti. Well, it really was cheap chianti, but all the wine was cheap, so I aimed for the middle. Adam got the salmon fettuccini with cream sauce. The wine came a few minutes before our dinners did, and mine was pretty grape juicey and bad. You are probably beginning to wonder what justified even a three star rating, eh? Ahem. Our meals came in gigantic pasta bowls about ten minutes after we'd ordered. Mine looked exciting, with calamari and marinara piled on top of a good amount of fettuccini. I was afraid that the calamari would be tough when I ordered it, but when I tasted my first noodle-squid-and-sauce bite, I was very pleasantly surprised. The calamari rings were tender and piping hot; the noodles were al dente and just the right thickness; and the marinara was garlicky, fresh, and not oily. I ate about half of the huge portion and asked for the rest to go. The waitress, who'd been diminutive but very nice throughout our meal wasn't pushy about dessert or appetizers, which is something I rather expect when I am in a mid-range and pretty empty place.  As we were finishing our meal, more people had started to show up, and I felt somehow triumphant on Bocce's behalf. Overall, the atmosphere is what almost kills Bocce for me, but I would definitely come back for the food and for a spaciousness that seems like it would preclude a long wait. And, while I didn't take advantage of it, a full bar also warrants a \u00a0\"Bocce\" note in my feeble, sodden brain.",

I had to ask and he said this is more of a dinner establishment so we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and asked to be seated in the patio.  The waiter was very friendly and gave us superior attention (however, it is hard to gauge their typical service because we were the only ones for him to attend to). \u00a0He recommended the Lasagna which we decided to each get a plate of. \u00a0He said basically all the \"from the oven\" recommendations on the menu were good..he had that strong Italian accent to make himself and the food sound and seem authentic. \u00a0You have to watch out if you sit in the patio...figs from the overhead fig trees fell onto my co-workers head and sap from the tree fell into his drink as it was being served. \u00a0Not impressed but not the fault of the waiter, just watch out if you are eating outside. \u00a0  The Lasagna was pretty decent..a little too much sauce for my liking and not enough Lasagna...not sure what the big rave about this place was all about...but it is well priced for North Beach. \u00a0Not impressive and a little disappointed with the high expectations coming from yelpers. \u00a0I give it 2 stars because my experience was not great but I would give this place another chance, perhaps at night...hopefully I will have a better experience to follow-up review with.",

But the prices lured us in. Oh the prices (considering that it's North Beach). It's an extremely reasonable restaurant, especially when you look at its fancy setting and nice location (if you want to walk up a bit, you can see the city from the top of the hill. It's lovely.).

The buzz about Bocce, that I've heard, was the setting that they present their diners with. \u00a0You wouldn't expect your typical Italian restaurant to be adorned with 70s-looking wall flowers, wood hangings, stones, miscellaneous vases, and accompanied by retro couches. \u00a0Strange but unique, indeed.   However, as much as I wanted to fall in love with their food, I couldn't force my feelings to sway that way. \u00a0Their pizza and pasta portions were huge compared to their costs, but in terms of taste - it was good but nothing too beyond that. \u00a0The biggest disappointment, for me, stemmed from the easiest item they could make -- Italian soda. \u00a0How hard is it to get an Italian soda right at an Italian restaurant? \u00a0It tasted like carbonated melted lipstick drowned in syrup.  Another major letdown was their service. \u00a0When we asked the waiter what Italian soda flavors they had, he simply said \"Strawberry? \u00a0I don't know\" instead of checking. \u00a0When we requested to move to their outdoor patio, the waiter insisted that we didn't because it would be too cold (even though it was incredibly warm outside). \u00a0As homely as the restaurant was, the service ironically made us all feel very unwelcomed. \u00a0The only thing that helped me make it through the night was the great company I had with me.",

I have no idea. My head was spared.   Waitstaff: Looked extremely bored to annoyed.   Service: Three-quarters of our table got wine. I was on the unfortunate end of that slice, but that's probably for the best since my boss was there. My water was never re-filled, and neither was the iced tea of the other Unfortunate Non-Wine Recipients next to me. The poor guy smack dab next to me ended up prit' near sucking on ice cubes by the end of our meal.   Food: Meh. I don't eat a ton of pasta and on this day, was not in The Mood. I had the marinated grilled shrimp salad, which was ok. The shrimp was good, but the dressing seemed a bit umm, sour. \u00a0The bread was good. \u00a0Everyone ate all their pasta.

They're newer to the area and live about an hour outside of San Francisco, so we were sort of blindly trying to find somewhere to eat in the city. We actually had our sights set on another place, but it ended up being closed. We stumbled upon Bocce Cafe and decided to give it a shot.   We walked through a cute patio area to get in, and because it was fairly warm out, we actually sat on the outside patio. The inside was cute but we didn't spend much time in there. Our server was fine, but nothing really stood out and service was a bit slow for how few people were in the restaurant (we ate at a weird time, probably about 4 or 4:30pm). \u00a0  Before our entrees, we decided to get a few appetizers. I don't eat fish but my three dining companions had calamari, and we also split some fried mozzarella sticks. For some reason, they came with onion rings, which was odd but I'm also not into onion rings, so maybe that isn't weird to everyone? The mozzarella sticks were good, as was the bread and olive oil dipping sauce.   We all ordered something different. My friend's husband ordered the Cappellini Pomodoro, which he enjoyed quite a bit. It was more of a marinara-type sauce than he was expecting, but he liked it all the same. My fiance tried the pepperoni pizza, of which I had a slice. It was just okay - I am really not picky about my pizza so I certainly would've eaten it, but I expected something a little better from an Italian place. My friend originally ordered the Penne Portobello but when it came out, she was disappointed. It was much more of a stroganoff-type sauce than she was expecting, and she said it was somewhat oddly sweet, so she ended up ordering something else (the Ravioli alia Spinaci). She wasn't stoked with that, either, but took home what she didn't eat and finished it the next day, so I think it was decent. \u00a0I had the Linguini al Pesto. It was pretty good; it was a little less al dente than I prefer but I enjoyed it enough. \u00a0Although they didn't necessarily have a kids' menu, they were kind enough to make a small dish of penne with marinara sauce for my friends' daughter (who then refused to eat it - silly toddlers).   Overall it probably wasn't the absolute BEST place we could've gone, but I think most of us enjoyed our meal well enough, and the place was pretty cute.",

FYI: if you're planning any thing after this, like speaking or making out, don't do it. The garlic that permeates from your body after a meal here is enough to be smelled from miles away. Mind you, I'm not complaining. I love garlic. It's just a \"WHOA you smell like garlic\" heads up.  I can't place my finger on it, but their Caesar salad is the best I've had. I don't know if it's the vibrant hint of lemon and the lack of sardine taste, but the dressing they use is perfect. It starts my night off on the right foot.  Each time I've come here I ordered the Fettuccine Smoked Salmon, and each time I've left wanting more. Who cares that the portions are big and I end up taking it home? I don't want to stop eating it! The salmon is perfectly blended with pesto, kamata olives, mushrooms, and big slices of tomatoes. It's a heavier dish, but not overwhelming in taste. With each bite, I find myself savoring its food beauty. If you can't tell, I love this dish.  The service here is polite and kind, with my first visit on the slower side. However, our last visit and server was quick on her toes and provided efficient service without being the least bit pushy. They give you time to enjoy your meal and company here.

I just got married this past Sunday and it was beautiful.   We went to Bocce Cafe for the evening festivities. I originally searched vineyards in the south bay and considered Napa but we wanted something accessible for families with small children and older people. I was searching on Yelp and came across Bocce Cafe located in the heart of SF. They had a lot of positive reviews from other wedding couples which turned out to be 100% accurate.   Ramon, the manager of the restaurant was so organized and helpful! He was excellent to work with taking care of all the small details so we didn't even have to think about a thing.   There was NO CHARGE for the venue, only the cost of beverages and the food we chose by making a customized dinner menu. It was such a sweet deal compared to the vineyards we visited down in the so.bay!   The restaurant setting was warm with great ambiance adding to our whole Tuscan themed wedding. The Bocce Cafe crew went above and beyond what we had expected of a venue. They also set up all the tables in formation to accommodate the number of attending guests, they rented our table cloths and napkins, printed our menus for us, accommodated all our vendors by closing the restaurant early to allow them to set-up in the afternoon and after the reception, tons of guests told me the food was delicious and the service was excellent with a very attentive staff.   Nothing better than hearing that wedding guests had a great time and were happy with the party. Another bonus: The restaurant also has a small stage (for our first dance, father/daughter, etc..) and a built in speaker system (for our band and DJ). There's a room in the back for the bride to change too and they also had valet service which was more affordable (incl. the tip for the guys parking the cars) than the parking garage if your event lasts 4+ hours. It was very convenient for our wedding guests. I just couldn't ask for anything more.   You get the whole package when you hold a reception here and the bill came out to less than what we had estimated since we only payed for what was ordered and BC was very honest with adding up the bill counting only the ordered food and drink from the open bar.   It was just perfect! Thank you Ramon, Welut, Karwan and everyone else at Bocce Cafe for making our wedding day so wonderful!",

    "review_text": "After reading the menu for Bocce Cafe online we thought that it would be the ideal place for our 13 people group to have dinner. \u00a0When we walked in I was a bit concerned that our nine teens would be too loud, rowdy, and perhaps too brown for the other diners.  However, the staff made us *all* feel welcome at Bocce, the menu was easy for the teens to maneuver and the portions were perfectly sized - I don't think anyone had leftovers and everybody was full at the end of the night.  Everyone was able to order easily for under $10/person - considering how great the food was, this was a small miracle.  I do wish that the music hadn't been quite so loud so that it would have been much easier to hear everyone - but it did help the other patrons enjoy their meals, I'm sure.  The gnocci was particularly amazing and I'm still craving those little morsels from heaven!",

This place has a nice backyard outdoor/indoor patio-type area, and is good if you have a group of 40 people who want to be loud and fed cheap, basic Italian food.

That would definitely improve the entertainment factor here, and secure another star or two.   Not to mention be true to its name. Ciao.",

    "review_text": "With so many other great choices in little italy we ended up here by accident...or rather by elimination process. We were starving, it was Saturday late lunch, and most delicious places were closed for the period between 2-5. After entering a few establishments (like Sports Cafe that smelled like an alley way behind a chinese restaurant) we were left with only Bocce Cafe...and as the guys were getting cranky we knew it was crucial that we stuff food down their throats ASAP.   First impression of this place (as mentioned by almost tons of other yelpers) is great. Their inside dining space is great - crazy tall ceiling, windows, and rustic furniture makes this a great evening spot. However, it was a beautiful sunny Saturday so we opted for the courtyard - so pretty out here. Clearly this has been around for a long time because vines drape the walls and there are trees providing shade. This part of the restaurant is fantastic.   We ordered the potato soup (pretty good but nothing that makes it stand out or makes you come back for it), linguini pescatore with white wine sauce (this dish had potential b.c. the pasta itself was good but they clearly didn't let everything cook long enough because the flavor was lacking BIG time...the wine wasn't cooked down as necessary and they forgot either garlic or herbs...can't put my finger one which one), the shrimp pizza (this item was tasty BUT I warn you that the crust is not pizza crust...it's like a bread crust...weird and kind of disappointing but all the other ingredients rocked), monicatti (the yummiest of all dishes! sooo good), and the ciappino (this was actually really really good and came with a pretty generous side of pasta).   As you can see everything was good but very few items were GOOD. Also, the fresh bread that they bring you is not italian at all...basic white. That along with the pizza crust made me give this place 3 stars...just not authentic enough even though it has the atmosphere.",

    "review_text": "Basically an overpriced Olive Garden.  My boyfriend brought me here for Valentine's Day. I will say that the patio and ambiance is charming. Also, there is an awesome cat on the patio whose presence basically made my night.   BUT, the buck stops there. The food was ATROCIOUS. Cheap. Inauthentic. Poorly made. None of the pasta was homemade. I was advised by our server to order a pasta dish that has prawns in it and described as \"tomatoes, white wine and garlic\" as the sauce. I specifically do not eat cream sauces, so I am very careful to not order them. My boyfriend ordered the Gnocchi with pesto sauce.  We get our food - first, none of the pasta is homemade (amazing to me that a restaurant in San Francisco can even exist and charge $15 - $25 a plate without homemade pasta) . His pesto sauce was a cream sauce.... My \"tomato and white whine with garlic\" also turns out to be a cream sauce. It's heavy, WAY overly sauced, oily and disgusting. I called over one of the servers to explain that I didn't realize that it was a cream sauce dish because it wasn't listed on the menu. He immediately argues with me to say it was. I try to state that cream sauce wasn't in the description, despite being clearly marked in other dishes. He tells me I'm wrong. Eventually, I have to ask him to just bring over our main server, who also proceeds to tell me I am wrong. \u00a0He asks me what I would like instead - I answer capellini pomodoro \u00a0- a dish that is usually made with a sauce of light olive oil, tomatoes, garlic and basil. It's a pretty common dish, not hard to do well. Instead of bringing what I ask for; he says the chef made something else for me - it is linguini with prawns in a VERY.... I repeat... VERY heavy butter sauce made with white wine. It's DISGUSTING. It's so heavy that I can't eat it. At this point, I can't even ask them to take it back because my boyfriend finished eating about 45 minutes prior, that I just eat the tomatoes and the shrimp - leaving ALL of the pasta and that nasty, nasty sauce.   This was a huge disappointment, especially when our bill for 2 people was about $100, and I left hungry. The food was something I would expect to see on Kitchen Nightmares or something. Great Italian food does not have to be covered in heavy cream or butter to be considered good - anyone who has actually been to Italy will tell you that the best Italian food usually has neither cream nor butter. \u00a0Further, I actually picked up a copy of their menu on the way out to double check and see if either of our food choices mentioned that they were served with cream. They do not, and I have the menu to prove it. It is NOT appropriate to argue with a customer, especially when the server doesn't even know what the menu actually says.   I hope to NEVER, ever go back. I'm disappointed from the experience (with the exception of the charming cat) to the point that I wish we had asked for our money back. Such a shame to waste a perfectly good Valentine's day on this place.",

Our large group took a while to sit, but since we had to leave early to get a CalTrain back down to South Bay, we managed to sit. Our team leader had had his wedding rehearsal here, so he knew some of the staff, and got us seated quickly and the waiter allowed my wife and I to order early, before the rest of the group had even gotten seated. That was very considerate, especially since our total group was like 45 people.   My chicken lasagna was delicious - but my usual issue with restaurant lasagna applies: the serving is just not quite enough. My wife had the penne with vodka sauce and ate it up yum. Combined with the delicious warm herbed bread that came as an appetizer to dip in olive oil, it almost filled me up. Perhaps if we had time for dessert....  Since it was rainy out, our crowd tried to squeeze inside the entry area, which got really crowded. Even with half the people spilling all around the bar area, it was too crowded.   If I ever find myself in the North Beach area and looking to have some good Italian food, i'd come back here.",

While over in North Beach on a recent rainy friday night, we happend to hear from some folks who had jsut eaten at Bocce and suggested we try it as well.  Im glad they did. Its got a great quirky, old-world feel to it, yet provides incredible food and live music. the resturant itself is down a romantic path, off the main drag of North Beach and opens up into a huge, hihg cielings farm like room.  the pals I was with both got the Chicken parm. crisp and tender, with out being too bready, the sauce they use was definately like homestyle \u00a0ones not to sweet or spicy. I had the cioppino (fsih stew) and was pretty impressed. Nicely cooked, great flavors. I might have wanted it a bit spicier for my pesonal taste - but I cant fault them with that.  The staff are nice, polite and pretty attentive, but I wouldnt say they were particularly \"friendly or welcoming\" but given it was a busy night I didnt expect false friendlyness...( now maybe after \u00a0I've gone a dozen times I might like to see some smiles). They run pretty proficiently - also most to the piont where its too proficeint , in a \u00a0casual place I generally like to feel Im not the next table to turn.  Over all \u00a0- I'd say check'em out.  We didnt try the fried squid - but from what I could see at the table next to us - nicely prepared and didnt smell fishy from over used frying oil",

Secluded space with an outdoor patio, reasonably priced food and wine, and very attentive and polite staff. Was enjoying a pretty tasty pasta sampler plate at the bar, when things took a turn for the worst.  All the sudden, someone jumps on a mic and begins giving a speech to in the neighborhood of 50 Germans, all part of a visiting orchestra, the sound of which dominates the dining space. Turns out they basically have a semi-private party occupying 2/3 of the main dining area. There is deafening yelling and applause at the end of the speech, and it is hard to have a conversation with the person next to you while the speech is going on, let alone during the ovations that follow. At the completion of the speech, the mic is passed to someone else. REPEAT 10+ times. This went on for about 30 minutes and was continuing when we left.   As a customer at a nice restaurant, I would expect notice before dining that this was going to be going on. Something along the lines of, \"Sir, we have a large party in attendance tonight, and I'd like to let you know that it may at times be very loud.\" Or, at the very least, an acknowledgement at some point from someone (apology, something on the house, etc.) that this was unexpected and likely very detrimental to our dining experience.   Instead, they tried to carry on as if this was \"business as usual.\" I left with a headache and will not be coming back.",

It is definitely one of my favorite restaurans in North Beach, and now one of my favorites in the city...so the negative reviews really surprise me! I'm here to show Bocce some love.   Bocce is tucked away off Green Street and from the outside, does not appear to be anything worth getting excited over. You have to walk down a little path to reach the restaurant, making it feel like a cabin or something.   Bocce is spacious and warm, both ideal for large groups and cozy enough for intimate dates or dinners with friends. We were seated at one of the tables with couches in the center of the restaurant--perfect. Bocce was magical that night, I don't know why anyone would say otherwise about the ambiance. It's adorable and fun, with live music playing on weekend nights and festive decorations all around.  The bar looked hopping as well. So after being won over by the ambiance and the service, which I must add was great, I held my breath as our food arrived. I feared Bocce would disappoint and my newly discovered restaurant would let me down.  The food was good!!! I think it's hard to go wrong with pasta, but Bocce really delivered. I also want to add that in North Beach it can be difficult to find a restaurant that's on the reasonable end in terms of pricing, many places seem very expensive for what you get. Bocce had good portion sizes and was fairly priced.  The dessert was goooood. Definitely order the tiramisu for something on the lighter end or the chocolate cake if you want something rich.   I cannot rave enough about Bocce. It really is adorable, cozy and fun. The live music is a great touch but there's something about the space that makes you feel right at home. I have to disagree with the less-than-stellar reviews and say that I really found Bocce to be a delight, and will certainly be back for many dinners to come.",

The atmosphere inside and on the back patio is very cool (love the tables with the couch seating) and the bar has a nice feel to it. The music can be pretty cheesy at times, but strangely enough it adds to the ambiance.  I love their bread, caesar salad and gnocchi, and the insalata caprese looked really good. I've had the gnocchi (at least) the last three times I've been here, and as a result I can't remember if I liked the other meals I've had here as much as the gnocchi.  During my most recent visit the staff was totally on top of everything, but I do remember experiencing spotty service at times in the past.

Eating in the outdoor courtyard is very peaceful and relaxing while contrasting the busy North Beach streets outside. The place is a little quirky as you'll surely be greeted by the cat missing his tail but will gladly accept table scraps if it is a dish that he likes. The men's restroom is also quirky as one of the urinals is right in front of a window. Since finding parking on hilly streets in North Beach can be a nightmare, I recommend the Valet parking!",

Put a keyboard in front of someone with taste buds they feel that they can flame out anyone for a bad experience. \u00a0BTW I believe that bad experiences seem to follow people. \u00a0Many don't realize that they are the constant variable in all of the bad things that happen around them.  This place doesn't have the best service I'll admit. \u00a0Its food has always been better than average but not earth shattering. \u00a0The interior decor looks like a small version of Macaroni grill meets Olive Garden (read trying to look authentic) but it never detracts from your experience and it is slightly cozy with a super huge bar (Yes! \u00a0Booze!)  The patio is down right effin nice and always worth the wait. \u00a0So the skinny really is this: service=average, food=average+, ambiance=average+...that would make it a 3.5er...but there is something else that needs mentioning.  First, they are VERY accommodating for big parties. \u00a0I don't mean an 8 or a 10 top...I mean like 100+.  Second, they provide the canvas and its up to you to paint the picture. Allow me to explain. \u00a0Nothing of Bocce will detract from your experience. \u00a0Rather, it sets the table \u00a0(in a figurative sense) well, I guess literally too. \u00a0Bocce allows you to comfortably dine while enjoying the MOST important part..your friends and family. \u00a0Not once have I gone where anyone left unhappy. \u00a0It is always seems like there were no distractions so we can enjoy each other's company.  Its a safe bet...as long as you are not one of those people that bad things seem to always happen to.",

I've been lots of times - in groups sizes varying from 2 to 20, and the service has always been adequate and the food great. \u00a0  I really like their mussels appetizer (served in a big iron pot, and LOVE to dip bread in the yummy broth), and their chicken marsala. \u00a0Of course the food is not stellar - and it's not trying to be - just consistently good traditional dishes.... and the ambience, esp. the patio on a nice day, is great! \u00a0I take my parents here every time they visit - they are from a small town and are not fans of fancy, pretentious food - so they love it here! \u00a0  On a particularly memorable visit here, a friend and I teamed up against another two friends to see who could be first to finish the \"Meal for 2\" - basically a sampler platter with all diff types of pasta. \u00a0This was NOT a good idea..... they should call this the meal for 3 or 4 - it is huge. \u00a0And we had already had lots of appetizers, not to mention the 10 or so cocktails we had at happy hour before this. \u00a0Anyhow, it was a brave attempt, but, sadly, both teams ended up forfeiting. \u00a0Good thing it was already midnight when we finished dinner with 20+ people - we were too stuffed to make much effort at going out afterwards. \u00a0Alas, we all headed home with our leftovers. \u00a0It was a good night all around.... :)",

    "review_text": "I used to consider this place the best place in North Beach, some years ago. Since then I've discovered many other places, so I figured Bocce was old hat. Admittedly I was trying to go back to Tony's new Pizza Nepolitana, but I was disappointed to find that they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, so we walked around looking for a place to dine and I remembered Bocce. Glad I did. The atmosphere is fun. It's kind of like an old barn or warehouse or something. They didn't have a jazz duo on Monday, but I remember that when those guys play it is a good touch. We were both very impressed with the food. We started with bruschetta and caprese. We both agreed the bruschetta was excellent; not too heavy or full of garlic, fresh tomatoes and the bread was good too. The caprese was good, not the best ever, but good enough. The warm bread they served with olive oil and vinegar was very tasty and fresh. My date loved her pasta. She's not always easy to please in the pasta department, so I was thrilled that she enjoyed it.  I had the chicken picatta for an entree. I think this is what I ordered so many times in the past (funny how we stick with what we know). I was very pleasantly surprised to see that I really did know good food even back then. This dish is fantastic! It was served steaming hot, a huge bonus in my book, as many fine restaurants I've been to have brought their main courses out lukewarm..I really hate it when that happens. Not here. The picatta sauce was a perfect blend of lemony, buttery, creamy zest loaded with capers. The chicken was excellent quality, the steamed veggies as a side were perfectly cooked and seasoned (not overly seasoned) and the pasta as the other accompanying side was satisfying. All this and cheap wine to boot! We got a bottle of Hess Chardonnay for $24 (or maybe it was $32, can't remember, but Hess is good Chardonnay and that was an excellent price).  The service was decent. At one point I asked if I could have my chardonnay chilled, to which our waitress responded \"isn't it cold enough? More ice won't make any difference.\" I decided to let it go, realizing it isn't a 5 star restaurant, and it was served adequately cold, but I could have done without that. Still, I see some peoples' complaints that seem so menial and baseless, so I have to say here that overall it was a very enjoyable experience, I'm glad I rediscovered it, and I will definitely keep in mind for future North Beach endeavors.",

    "review_text": "Soulful Italian Comfort Food Here!  I came here with five other college buddies and strolled around North Beach until our 8:30pm reservations. Convenient valet parking was available if you didn't want to look for your own parking or pay to park your car in a lot. There was a large green awning covering a narrow walkway leading to a side door entrance. The place is bigger than what is perceived outside. While we waited, there was a live band playing jazz. The dining room layout was very spacious with a bar, fireplace, outside patio, and plenty of group and couples seating. The restaurant had a warm rustic old-world charm to it with Mediterranean style colored walls and tiles to match. Italian decorations made the area feel more lively and festive. The crowds were so rambunctious and loud, I found myself screaming to speak to one of our guys across my table.   The menu had a lot of selections ranging from Antipasti to Secondi dishes. I heard from one of the guys who reserved this restaurant, all dishes are huge for the amount of money you pay. Although we each ordered our own dishes, we were open to share family style as well. This is what our group ordered: 1 Antipasto Della Casa (great assortment of a couple pieces of each appetizer item on the menu) 1 Bruschetta (3 slices of toasted bread topped off with chunks of tomato, garlic, and basil) 1 Fried Calamari (golden brown fried calamari with red marinara and a chunky tartar sauce) 1 Large Ceasar Salad (shared among two) 1 Small Ceasar Salad (chopped crisp romaine lettuce tossed with a strong and flavorful anchovy and Caesar salad dressing garnished with croutons and thinly sliced parmigiano) 1 Gnocchi (A plate full of chewy potato dumplings with a creamy pesto sauce. Very delicate and yummy!) 1 Linguini with Fresh Mussels (great presentation with lots of linguini tossed with a deep red spicy marinara sauce and topped off with at least a half dozen steamed mussels) 1 Fish of the Day: Swordfish (didn't get to try it, but the presentation looked hearty and delicious with a cream sauce and vegetables) 3 Ciopinnos (This was the most expensive dish in the restaurant at $21.95 each, but well worth it! It was two-fold; one pot full of Crab, prawns, salmon, calamari, clams &amp; mussels in a hearty Marinara sauce soup similar looking to a Minestrone soup served with a heaping serving of pasta with marinara sauce on the side. Delicious and Very Filling. The seafood made the savory broth taste amazing and chunks of vegetables were superb.)  I hope you could tell my main dish was Ciopinno and my appetizer was sharing a large Caesar salad. Because the Ciopinno was a large order in itself, it took longer to completely devour than other plates. I found myself halfway done while the other 3 were finished with their plates. The hearty stock and soup was contained in a stove pot and marinara pasta in another plate. I did get to taste each of the plates except for the Swordfish. Everything looked picture worthy but I failed to take pictures because I was hungry along with the rest of my party. After we finished each of our plates, we were full enough not to order dessert. When the bill arrived, with tip, each person gave $37. I think a good hearty meal coupled with lifelong friends is well worth the money paid. I figured, if I had as much fun and enjoyment eating here, I know everyone else would too!  Bellissimo!",

Here are the highlights:  Great Service: Walking in we were greeted and led to the back heated glass patio for our table. I loved this because we felt like we were sectioned off to have our own private dinner and it felt so VIP yet welcoming. Our server was very friendly and did not ever rush or constantly over ask about the service.  The restaurant inside is beautiful as well. It has this home feeling to it. The lighting with the decor is very traditional family style. I can see friends and family equally enjoying time here.  The food: Delicious!!!

    "review_text": "I was going to give Bocce Cafe 3 stars, but they kind of dropped the ball at the end of our meal, so they got demoted to 2 star status. Here's the low down:  The girl lives on the other side of Columbus, up the hill in \"Chinatown Heights\" and we were looking for something not too far away, with outdoor seating. Yelp told us that this place might be hit or miss, but we decided that's half the fun. So away we went.  The location of Bocce is pretty keen. The little alley way that opens up to the lodge-like main space is fun and cute. Speaking of that main space, it's pretty neat. I don't know how well it functions as an Italian restaurant, it seems more suited to a martini bar or perhaps ski lodge, but it's funky and different.  The hostess warned us against seating in the patio as it was windy. Fair enough, we'll take a couch seat in the corner, then. The food was not at all impressive, but the Special (pick from 4 pastas and a variety of sauces) was decent for the price. Calamari wasn't so great. As an indication to portion and food quality, I had left overs from my Fettuccine Alfredo that I didn't really feel were worth taking home. That's pretty rare for me to leave a man behind like that.  So they collected our plates and offered us a dessert menu that was quite slow in arriving. Then it took them forever to come and take our dessert order. To top that whole ordeal off, I ordered a Grappa and what I was served was gross. Awful.  If you want some food, come here, but it's nothing special. I think Midwesterners visiting SF may really enjoy it (there was a party of such having a grand ol' time the night we were there), and it can certainly handle a large group with no problems.",

My fiance and I approached this place anticipating something other than what we found. I think the sight of valet guys out front sort of indicated that this would be a place people would want to come too. Its locale in north beach indicated to me it would uphold the standard of authenticity that is the driving force behind many north beach eateries. The walk up to the front door, down a dark but clean alley caused my spidey senses to tingle. I knew this would either be the begining of a really great, intimate dining experience or it would simply be the begining of the end.   We walked into the front door and we were caught off gaurd by the Gypsy Kings playing over the house system. All of a sudden I'm not sure if I have a hankering for tapas or tortellini. The room was big and cold. Oh, and practically empty. It had all the makings of a great Colorado ski lodge. It had none of the makings of a great Italian dining establishment as far as I can tell. I was ready to split. My fiance encouraged me to give it a shot, if for no other reason than not appearing rude. I agreed.   She, like a pro, ordered caprese salad and prosciutto and melon. It was kind of hott, seeing her so decisive and cultured and shtuff. I think it was pretty clear to the server that we would be ordering meals after the appetizer, as evidenced by the fact we held onto our menus after ordering apps. First the bread came out. And it was good. Then the caprese salad and prosciutto y melon arrived. The salad was a terrible. The cheese was soggy. It certainly didnt taste fresh and they used the wrong tomatoes. The melon was killer. This was the only saving grace for the whole experience. It made me happy. Like \"giddy\" happy. Now, in fairness prosciutto and melon is pretty hard to screw up. What does it say about a place that their only saving grace is a dish thats impossible to screw up, and fairly easy to gather ingredients for? Exactly, i think you get my drift.   Well, there we were eating our apps, menus on the table. The server never came back to see about the remainder of our order. It's just as well as at this point we were not considering ordering anything else. After our apps we waited. And waited. FInally I had to find our waiter and ask for him to bring our bill, which he had not yet prepared. We paid about 19 bucks before tip. I wouldnt consider it a total waste. For 19 bucks i learned a valuable lesson. It goes like this \"The next time I'm greeted by the Gypsy Kings at an eating establishment I'd better be ordering tapas or paella\". Lesson learned.",

I ordered a house salad with balsamic vinegrette and bruschetta.The greens were old and the salad was swimming in dressing. \u00a0 \u00a0The oil in the dressing tasted rancid, the balsamic was so bitter and disgusting I'm sure it wasn't real balsamic. \u00a0The bruschetta was so forgettable - boring bread with the consistancy of stale white bread oven \"toasted\" the day before. \u00a0The tomatoes were underripe and had no flavor and the shaved piece of \"Parmesan\" tasted like plastic. \u00a0My sister ordered the ravioli in meat sauce. \u00a0The flavor was okay but not great. \u00a0However it would have been much better if the raviolis weren't swimming in a pool of grease. \u00a0Strike two!  Lastly, the service was bad. \u00a0We had to ask for everything, including water refills which should be automatic. \u00a0You would think that only having one table to attend the waiter would have paid a little more attention. \u00a0Strike Three and you're out!",

We had a very large party (16+) people and Bocce was willing to accomodate us all at 9PM. They had several vegetarian options including soup in a veggie broth, which satisfied friends usually stuck with a salad at most other restaurants. \u00a0  The jazz was incredibly fun and we had plenty of space to stretch out.  But either the chef had gone home early, or was in the home stretch because the food was just deplorable. The gnocchi was pasty, not tasty, the meatballs...Mama Mia who does not make good meatballs at an Italian restaurant, the meatballs sat on our plates barely touched.  I had the rib eye demiglacce which seemed to be code for, bathed in sugar so I wouldn't tell what a fatty mess it was. I almost stole the tofu lasagna off my friend's plate, but it was also sitting there, half-touched.  Judging by other reviews we seemed to have caught them on a bad night, but my personal experience says not to go back.",

Low-ish prices, but quality food.  The service was very attentive (we were there for an \"early\" dinner, about 7) and non-forceful. They let us eat without interruption and were nearby if we needed anything. Oh! And our food came quickly! Neither of us could believe how fast it came out.  If we didn't already have plans, we would've stayed for the night! Comfy chairs and tables and the jazz trio was wonderful.",

Service was spotty, due to it being packed and on a Saturday night. \u00a0The noise level was high, which made it difficult to hear and understand our waiter (speaking a dialect that I did not recognize).  He sounded like father Guido sarducci from Saturday Nigh Live of years ago.  The antipasti was nice - similar to last time, but not as fresh as it could have been. \u00a0It must have been a bitch to open those containers and plate the food....  The special this evening was a tri plate of chicken, sausage and beef with smashed potatoes and 'veggies'. \u00a0I had to look very hard to find those veggies. \u00a0What I thought I was going to get vs what I got was night and day.  If they sliced the chicken breast, sausage and london broil any thinner, \u00a0you would be able to read through it. \u00a0I bet the 1 chicken breast, sausage and london broil used on this dish served 20 people. \u00a0Honestly - it was that bad.

We called ahead asking if we needed a reservation and we were told to just walk in. We saw the obvious when we arrived with only three other tables being filled, mind you, this is a bigger space restaurant.   As we were perusing the menu, we overheard our neighboring table sending back his lasagna which he deemed the content of his dish was cold and frozen! I FROZE at the thought of hearing that! I had a marvellous lasagna version at Ristorante Milano and would never attempt to diminish the good thoughts and experience so I vowed never to order lasagna in other locations and definitely not at Bocce. I signaled to bf NOT to order the lasagna, for obvious reasons!   Bf ordered the Margherita pizza - cheese and basil pizza and I had the Cioppino - crab, prawns, salmon, calamari, clams, and mussels in a marinara sauce, served in copper pot with pasta on the side. Yup, it sure came in a large copper pot, one that you'll find in your grandma's kitchen! I've never had it in a pot, it was usually served in a larger bowl. We had a good laugh as I started scooping out the content. It was a large portion considering that it came with a side of pasta dish! The soup was delicious and the mixture of seafood was decent.   We were glad that our entrees turned out decent but from the looks of other dishes and the dismay of other guests, I'm not sure if we'll return so soon with so many other Italian places to try in the city.",

We started with a beet salad and a salmon carpaccio. \u00a0Neither was particularly impressive, but not horrible.  As for the entrees, my girlfriend's penne alla vodka was decent, but incredibly salty. \u00a0I had the gnocchi alla napoletana, which was perhaps the saving grace of the entire meal. \u00a0The gnocchi were awesome and I would order them again and again, if I ever went back...which I probably won't.  For dessert, we shared a piece of carrot cake, which tasted like it was store-bought. \u00a0Various other elements of the meal had a supermarket feel to them as well. \u00a0The bread also looked and tasted as if it had come from Safeway. \u00a0When we asked for parmasean cheese, they brought a shaker like you'd expect to find at Pizza Hut, filled with some product that bore only a slight resemblance to actual parmasean.  The service was incredibly poor. \u00a0We stopped in before the dinner rush got started and still couldn't seem to get the attention of any of the wait staff. \u00a0Then the overzealous busboys would appear from out of nowhere and try to yank plates away, while we were chewing and forks still in our hands.  The only reasons that this is not a one-star review are the gnocchi and the space that the restaurant is in. \u00a0It's unfortunate that such a great, unique, romantic space is occupied by such an underwhelming restaurant. \u00a0With so many other great food options in North Beach, I can't say I'll be coming back. \u00a0But...if I do, I'll be having the gnocchi.",

It was a busy Friday night so a lot of the places we tried first were too crowded to seat us, but we stumbled on this establishment and since we were crunched for time, we gave it a shot.  Our service was lackluster and inattentive. We ordered several appetizers to share as a family. Nothing stood out as above average. Bland tastes and just lacking a chef's love.  The restroom was even a disappointment. One of two stalls was completely disgusting and not usuable, and one of two sinks was broken.  This place has potential with its location and atomospheric charm, but it needs some serious love and attention.",

    "review_text": "I think mediocre is the best word to describe virtually everything about this place, if not downright bad. The valet parking in front is more for marketing than anything, or maybe--scratch that: obviously--the owner is completely clueless and thinks the only reason his place is virtually completely empty at 7pm is because he didn't have valet parking. Why, of course, sir. All fine restaurants have valet parking, so just add that and you're automatically fine dining!  This place painfully reminds me of why people like Gordon Ramsay exist. I can intuit that the owner is likely new, riding on the coattails of his predecessor, which includes the tiny stream of customers, many of whom likely were deceived by a relatively high Yelp rating, most of which was established years ago, presumably in the hands of an earlier owner, or perhaps the same one, but who actually cared. I wonder what the motives or palates are of those recent reviews with high ratings. I must seriously question their integrity.  Besides the unsettling experience of dining almost totally alone at 7 pm on a Wednesday, the food here is pretty mediocre. Actually, it's just on this side of edible. The chef clearly doesn't have any regard for quality of ingredients and just isn't a very good chef. The caprese as part of the appetizer.sampler was pathetic. The mozzarella may as well have been cardboard, as it tasted like nothing. The tomato was gross and underripe. The chef/owner understands nothing. Caprese is about bringing out and emphasizing the flavors of the few ingredients. Just sad.   We were there for a company outing so we all shared quite a few plates. All of them left something to be desired. The pasta was tasteless. The eggplant spinach dish was very bland. The only decent dishes were the Caesar salad, with a clearly homemade dressing, and the pizza, which was at least acceptable, although not \"good.\" But you can't build an entire italian restaurant on a Caesar salad.  It's clear this restaurant won't be around for long if it continues doing what it's doing, which is serving very poor food in an area known for particularly good, authentic Italian food. People are speaking with their wallets in the empty dining room at prime dinnertime, and it's time this clearly clueless owner listens and gets help before it's too late. Maybe it already is, sadly.",

Not exactly the Tuscan villa where guests eat under a leafy awning, and then danced until the stars came out like my father had visioned as the ideal wedding reception(yes, a really unrealistic and uncharacteristic wish of his), but this is the next best thing if you want to host a reasonably-priced dinner at a cute venue with a lively ambiance.   The backyard is large enough to accommodate a big group. We fit 50 people perfectly under the roofed part of the yard, surrounded by little white Christmas lights that are cozy and endearing. We sat around three long tables, shared dishes my sister preselected for the evening.   Everything was delicious, from the steamed clams to the seafood linguine. When you think about all the mass-produced awful wedding food you've had in your life, this really good.   Service was prompt. No one rushed us when we were waiting for people to arrive. And when half of the guests left before desserts, they took that into account and brought just enough tiramisu for the remaining guests.   Price was really reasonable. I have had birthday party tabs bigger than this.   The only tips I'd give is keep constant communications with the restaurant. My sister's inquiries and emails were often not responded promptly and left her a bit nervous before the reception. Fortunately everything turned out perfect.",

We split the seven flavor pasta sampler for two (It's in a box by itself on the back page of the menu) and some bruschetta. \u00a0The pasta didn't seem to be fresh, not even the gnocchi, and the sauces were run of the mill. \u00a0The veggies in the veggie lasagna were fresh and crisp, but the flavors didn't meld all that well. \u00a0I guess it needed some meat. \u00a0The food was by no means bad, and I left full and content, but it was just nothing to write home about. \u00a0I'd love to see some more unique choices on the wine list too.  The service was great. \u00a0We had a dashing server with a killer Italian accent who was very accommodating with substitutions and maybe it was just because the place was dead on a sunny Sunday afternoon (my recommended time to visit), but he was fantastically attentive, as was the busser. \u00a0They didn't seem to mind at all that we were taking our time and reading stories to each other out of the New York Times, or that we lingered after the coffee was gone. \u00a0  The back patio is a great place to sit when the weather is nice, as it is sheltered from the road, gets indirect sunlight, so there are no blinding rays or glare, and the music still flows outside from the restaurant.  I would definitely go back in the right situation.",

So, we waited for a tow, fed ourselves with skittles from my purse and lamented about the lack of Cinque Terre.  Tow came, took car -- we walked down the street and hit the Bocce Cafe and best friend remembered eating there once before.   Positives -  Atmosphere was very cute and intimate. The back patio looked cold, but really pretty with the Christmas lights.  Waitstaff were attentive and friendly.  Pepto Bismol colored bathroom.  Bruchetta tomatoes were VERY good.  Mmm...Pinot Grigio  Negatives -  Bruchetta toast bit was COLD and really hard. Not like I am used to at all.  No water refills.  My pasta (Capellini Pomodoro) was wayyyy too salty.  Pepto Bismol colored bathroom.   But, i will give Bocce Cafe props for being so close to where our car died. And a tab of 53.00 for two people with appetizer, entree, dessert and a bottle of wine is not bad at all.  I'd go back and try something new.",

My friends didn't like the limited choices of pizza at Golden Boy Pizza so we decided to look for other places in North Beach. Luckily, we found a place not too far away from our original destination.   We saw the menu and thought the prices weren't too bad for a sit-down Italian joint. \u00a0We walked into an alleyway of vines and greenery, as if we're walking through Endor. Eventually, we found the place. The server gave us the option of choosing to dine outside or inside. We opted for the former as it was just a good day to eat outside. The interiors were really nice and would be an ideal place to take a date. If SF is experiencing a sunny day, the outdoor patio is the best place to dine. Thankfully, the place wasn't crowded so it was very intimate and quiet.  The menu had a good selection of pasta, antipasti, pizzas, etc. Prices were reasonable. We didn't feel like having pasta so we ended up getting two margharita pizzas and a shrimp-styled pizza. About the pizzas, they are 10 inches and could make four grown men's stomachs full. So yeah...portions are reasonably big. As for the quality, I thought it was very good. I don't know what the previous reviews are criticising on but I thought it was good pizza.

I really enjoy the overall atmosphere of the place. The service was ok. Last time we went we stood by the door with 4 other couple who were all waiting to get seated [and there seemed to b plenty of seats].  The food has been getting more and more mediocre over the years. The price you pay makes it worse. I really used to love this place, but if you do go, i'd recommend going for some pasta dishes you can't botch up.   I think it's still worth a go if you've never been just to check it out, or maybe even just to get a drink.",

    "review_text": "You so want Bocce to be this hidden jewel among all the other North Beach restaurants. But it's not. It falls drastically short.  PARKING: Bocce offers their own valet parking for a reasonable price of $10-15. If you choose to street park, be prepared to circle the area for least 15 minutes. This may be even longer if it's on the same night as Beach Blanket Babylon. In addition, there are pay lots that range from $15 - $25.  RESERVATIONS: I'd say make them, but it didn't seem to make a difference. Our group, along with another party, \u00a0were still waiting for a table 20 minutes AFTER our scheduled reservation.  INSIDE: Despite the unassuming nature of the outside of the restaurant, and the narrow entrance into the dining area, the interior boasts high ceilings and a huge seating area. The bar could have been situated better, oh say, not next to the entrance which clogs traffic coming and going. The decor is reminiscent of some replica Beer Hall you'd find at Busch Gardens or Disney World. The \"live jazz band\" only enhances the surreal nature of the atmosphere, as the female vocalist manages to sing several songs to the tune of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" all the while tapping away at the snare drum and accompanied by a keyboardist.   SEATING: The frantic nature of the staff is hard not to feel as their poorly planned seating arrangement is presented to us. Seven people are squashed along one side of pushed together tables, while five others are given a bit more breathing room along the opposite side. Still, four others are placed at a separate table altogether.   WINE AND APPETIZERS: Half an hour later, we finally get the wine we've ordered - though those were difficult choices as their wine list is lacking anything close to imagination. Appetizers begin to dot our tables a good 10 minutes after.   MAIN COURSE: Finally, 50 minutes after seating, we are allowed to place our orders. I realize we had close to 20 people in our party, however, it was 10 o' clock - 2 hours since our reservations - and our food entree is yet to be served. When they do bring the food out, it comes in spurts. The first to get their food reluctantly start eating as it's been 10 minutes, their food is starting to get cold, and not everyone has their dinner in front of them. Apparently the raviolis are their most difficult dish to serve. They not only came out last, but we had to remind the waiter we were still missing one plate nearly 15 minutes after they started serving.   Our party ordered everything from Lamb Chops to Lasagna to Linguine in a white wine sauce. The prices listed on the menu are reasonable. However, you get what you pay for. The food, while no one complained, was adequate. Their one redeeming dish is a dessert - Tiramisu. It is quite good, and surprisingly \"light.\"  LAST IMPRESSION: I do NOT recommend this place. There are so many other great food places in North Beach which are better organized, with fresher food and better wines.",

The waiter was extremely polite. Service is not a problem.  Food. They gave us sliced baguette. It's warm, so we ate it especially since I can't eat my entree. I ordered the linguine with clams. Sauce is extremely sour and the pasta is not fresh. It feels that they made the dish yesterday. I can't eat my pasta, so I just dunk in the bread to my pasta sauce.  Good restaurant in North Beach is so far and between since it's such a touristy area. It surprises me that despite the location that's a bit secluded, this restaurant still stays in business.",

    "review_text": "I've been craving Italian and pasta and tomato sauce for weeks now. Just *craving* it. So when given the opportunity to pick dinner for Saturday night, I was quick to offer up a cuisine. We headed over to Bocce's relatively early (5ish) before the dinner rush and easily got a table. Along with several families of tourists with noisy kids (oy that's frustrating sometimes, but not something you can ding the restaurant for IMO).  The restaurant has an elegant decor with cushy, cozy couches winding their way around. Tables are scattered around the couches so half the seating is on standard chairs, the other lets you settle back into cushiness. It's really quite comfortable, I could see settling in for a few hours to drink and relax and socialize.  There's a lot of options on the menu, from appetizers to salads, pasta, pizza, sandwiches, etc, a good range of wine and beer. The bread with olive oil and balsamic was so soft and fluffy it felt like cotton, I could have probably eaten nothing but that and been happy. But you don't go to Italian restaurants for the bread no matter how good it is... no, go for the pasta. The awesome, delicious pasta.  Torn between ravioli and spaghetti, I settled on a pomodoro sauce since tomato sauce is probably my favourite part of pasta. My friend ordered the carbonara, along with a beer of some sort (I failed to notice what brand). I had a glass of the Zin to go with my dinner.  Service was pretty quick and very considerate. Water, drinks and bread were topped up regularly (or asked if we wanted more). It's a large open-concept restaurant and I could see it getting noisy as it fills up, so be careful of this is you're looking for a quiet, intimate dinner with a loved one. Prices are also really decent, in the medium price range. Our dinner ran around the $45 range (before tip) for entrees and drinks, with more than enough on your plate to satisfy your appetite.   If you're looking for decently priced Italian food, you're in the North Beach area, and don't mind potential crowding by tourists, Bocce's is a good option to look at. I'd happily go back to try the ravioli or pizza options. Some of the appetizers look great too!",

The menu is extensive with all different pastas, pizzas, risotto, etc, etc. The salmon penne pasta with tomato cream sauce was quite good. The tiramisu was also delicious.

At an Italian restaurant?!?! Seemed like it came from Safeway. They don't have fresh grated Parmesan, just that powdered shit you shake from a glass jar like when you eat gressy pizza at two in the morning.   Had the gnocchi. I couldn't finish it - and I'm a disgusting fat ass who eats everything, especially when I pay $16 for the meal. The gnocchi was fine, it was the sauce. It comes with an Alfredo sauce, when I aksed our (Russian) server if it was made with a Gorgonzola sauce she replied, \"Pesto?\" -- She had to ask the cook what I meant. I am skeptical of a place where the wait staff does not know a simple Italian cheese, which I might add, is a staple to any good gnocchi dish.   Great atmosohere, but seriously, don't waste your time with the food. You'll be disappointed.  ***I should add, I went here on account of my roommate (a foodie) who liked it. He had tortellini. Maybe it is a new chef or a bad dish I had. Either way, there is just too much good food in SF to mess around with another bad meal.",

A hearty, soul-warming, serving of Cioppino is served in a clinical metal pot. It's half classy, half Olive Garden cheesey. But all in all, Bocce offers pretty good food, quite a lot of it, and at a good price.   The $10 pasta special (choice of pasta and sauce) is a default especially if you like spaghetti carbonara like me. The cioppino is another good dish and it's big enough to share for 2. It comes with a side pasta and you have enough delicious broth, crab, clams, mussels, and salmon for several bowls each. Plus it's only $22 I believe.   But for the sake of my sanity, please stop the wedding singer in the patio from singing \"happy birthday\" for the umpteenth time in one night. I can hear her from my bedroom and it's driving me insane.",

I ordered the margherita pizza and my boyfriend had the linguini with zucchini, olive oil and garlic. The pizza was spot on authentic thin crust italian. It was nice and salty from the mozzarella and fresh from the basil. My boyfriend's pasta was also quite delicious with really good simple flavors. Portions were about average for the price. I enjoyed this restaurant, the interior was kinda quirky italian and also really homey. Price is average for North Beach, our dinner with 2 beers, 2 glasses of wine, an appetizer and 2 entrees was only around $50-60.",

The night was magical, the pictures turned out beautiful thanks to all the rustic details and beautiful entranceway. The lighting and intimacy of the restaurant setting the mood, the food was served hot and delicious and the location of the restaurant is great for out of towners to experience North Beach.

We were sat outdoors in their backyard on a chilly night and waited about 10 minutes before being greeted by a rather hurried server. I'm guessing she had the entire patio section to herself.   We both ordered a variation of lasagna and having not eaten all day, I decided to skip an appetizer for fear of not making it to the actual main course. They had no iced tea to speak of that night-how does a place in California not have iced tea?? But anyhow, the lasagna's came out in record time and while I appreciate the little earthen pots they come in, the dried square of cheese could have been done without.   I've had better food and cooked at a better temperature too. The chicken lasagna was actually cold in the center and to save face and not ruin my friends' meal, I said nothing but continued cutting up the lasagna and mixing with the other parts of the warmer sides of lasagna to mask the grits of cold cheese...nasty.   They apparently have a mascot that walks from table to table begging for scraps. A rather large bobcat tabby is this place's very own Garfield, scarfing lasagna and manicotti like a champ. I wasn't at all impressed by the service-or lack thereof but was happy to see the server was all over the table as soon as it came time to pay the bill.",

You're better off parking it yourself and walking a couple blocks than to have your car violated. Yea parking in this area sucks, but I rather walk a mile and not have grease stains from a pizza box from an unauthorized re-con mission.  btw, I never valet my car.  --  Been here twice. Once we sat at the table next to the band... loud! order some white-sauce pasta dish with a side of sausage. I didn't realize the sausage would be in red sauce. I thought it was just sausage, no sauce, that I could put into my pasta dish...I can't mix red and white sauces now. and on top of it, this sausage was COLD! I had to send it back for a reheat.  The second time, we sat far from the band, it wasn't too bad, but we had a table in the corner, it was really hot and stuffy, no air flow. I ordered a pizza this time, much better than my first experience eating here.  There's no parking here, can't even find street parking. They offer valet. I never use valet.

Pouring over the menu, I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to try because everything sounded so tasty (I'm such a sucker for pasta). \u00a0My ever so brilliant boyfriend pointed out on the back the \"meal for 2.\" \u00a0This included veggie lasagna, meat lasagna, canneloni, gnocchi, pesto tortellini, fettuccine alfredo and linguine alfredo. \u00a0How could I pass up the opportunity to try so many tasty treats?! \u00a0And, for a mere $22, it was such a bargain.  We started with the bruschetta, which was decent. \u00a0I found theirs to be a bit lacking in flavor. \u00a0I like my bruschetta to have a lot of fresh basil, and I could barely taste it in theirs. \u00a0When our waitress brought out the pasta dish for two, I was so excited. \u00a0It was way more food than I thought - I think sharing this dish with 3 people would be perfect.  Everything tasted good. \u00a0My favorites were the pesto tortellini, the fettuccine alfredo, and the lasagna. \u00a0The gnocchi was not as flavorful as I would have liked, but they were cooked perfectly. \u00a0  Service was really good, bordering on overwhelming - the bus boy kept trying to take our plates before we were finished. \u00a0Overall, the meal was good and a total bargain. \u00a0Recommended for those who want to get their Italian grub on, but don't want to rob to bank to do so.  Thank you wonderful boyfriend for finally introducing me to the wonders of Bocce Cafe.",

I probably should have taken this as a clue and went somewhere else.  I went here a few months ago and had a poor experience but held off writing a review because I thought it might just be an off night. Cesar salad is good but small for the price. Added chicken to it last time and got exactly six toothpick sized slivers of chicken sprinkled on top. \u00a0Had pasta and meatballs this time, spaghetti was overcooked and sauce looked exactly like something out of a can of Chef Boyardee. Bad.  Service was friendly but confused. Even though there were only 4 or 5 tables seated in the entire restaurant, they brought us another table's salads, then forgot ours, then brought us another table's entrees.   Overall really disappointing.",

We made reservations on New Year's Eve so I expected it to be busy but we were agitated waiting for our table since they were not going off of the reservation list. Some people pushed their way to the front of the line expecting to be helped ahead of those in front of them, but they were good about not seating people before those who had reservations.  When we finally did get seated, we had the coldest seat in the house, luckily they moved us once we said something about being seated next to the door. It seemed like they had a really nice patio - something to check out in warmer weather.  In the end, everybody loved their food and we left very satisfied. Our waitress and busgirl were great - we just felt bad for them because they were clearly understaffed.  We will probably come back here, just when it is less busy!",

We showed up at 8:30pm and the place was PACKED, but without a reservation, the owner (?) joined some tables in the outside patio area and we were seated w/in 5 minutes.  After that, the staff literally waited on us hand and foot, they were RUNNING back and forth to get us whatever we needed, there was never more than 2 minutes without some sort of wait staff in the vicinity looking to help us, and the food came out within 15 minutes (and it was 100% correct!). \u00a0We even asked for a basket of entirely Fogaccia and the waitress brought it without any hesitation or complaint (the bread baskets they brought were mixed bread, and the Fogaccia disappeared the second they hit the table).  I've resigned myself to getting shitty service whenever I come to a restaurant 1. \u00a0with a large group and 2. without a reservation and 3. in a busy part of town on a weekend night. \u00a0If I could give them more than 5 stars for their service, I would.  Now on to the food. \u00a0I'm 100% Italian and my family is from central and southern Italy. \u00a0I ordered the lasagna which was decent, but nothing special, but I tried other friends dishes (the fettuccine w/mixed sea food, the calamari) and those were all top notch. \u00a0I have a high standard for Lasagna, however, because it was mom's specialty, so it's not their fault for being only mediocre. \u00a0At least they used Ricotta instead of cottage cheese!  In addition, the prices were reasonable (most entrees in the $9-12 range) and the acoustics were GREAT! \u00a0There's nothing worse than going to a crowded restaurant and having to yell to be heard. \u00a0 The back porch area was covered and enclosed with clear plastic, and the temperature was perfect and the acoustics great out there, too. \u00a0The decor inside was interesting--reminiscent of Tahoe in the mid 90's/a lodge in the woods.  Overall it was a fun experience, great service, good food, decent prices, comfortable surroundings. \u00a0That, for me, has always been hard to come by in N.Beach, which is why I avoid it at all costs.",

Delicious and filling, the Seven Flavors allowed us to try a variety of offerings from the Bocce Cafe. \u00a0  Now while there is no kids' menu, my 8 year-old did well with the Spaghetti and meatballs on the menu. \u00a0Decently priced, she informed us that the meatballs were tasty and the pasta was perfectly cooked. \u00a0The restaurant was also kind enough to work with us on preparing a small portion of spaghetti noodles and butter for our 4-year-old.

The sauce was tasty, but the Gnocchi were awful. They were so mushy and doughy that I could barely pick them up with a fork. My boyfriend had the Meatball sandwich.

I had the marinara gnocchi and found it to be blatantly the frozen-then-defrost kind. They poured Prego sauce on it and called it an Italian meal. So unfortunate.

Located next to one of my favorite pizza places in North Beach, Bocce Cafe was the right price and had great service. We shared the vegetarian \"tour of Italy\" (vegetarian is not on the menu, but the waiter was happy to oblige). For a measly 22$ we were brought out an aromatic white platter filled with 2 heaps each of vegetarian lasagne, fettuccini alfredo, pesto ravioli, gnocchi in a creamy tomato sauce and eggplant parmasean. Granted, these were not the most adventuresome offerings the restaurant had but how could I complain? For only 11$ each I got to try all of the above dishes in a quaint patio setting (sans people grazing by my plate on Columbus). The hits were the pesto ravioli, and the vegetarian lasagne. Misses were the eggplant (too many layers of eggplant, too eggy) and the gnocchi was a bit pasty. Other than that, this place was good eats on the cheap. I will definately be back.",

We checked in with the hostess, and was seated shortly thereafter at a table not far from the door (which was fine as we were waiting for two more guests) \u00a0However, this place gets busy, and this area gets very congested with people waiting for their tables.  Our server was sweet enough, but for an evening out on the town, I would like a server who is a little more polished, whereas if I was at Denny's, the server would have been fine. \u00a0One thing about this place-they want to get you in and out! \u00a0The server checked back several times ( we wanted to chat awhile) ever so slightly frustrated that we weren't placing our order as of yet. \u00a0We did, however, place an order for Bruchetta for the table. \u00a0This was not a good interpretation for this popular appetizer. \u00a0It was stale toast with a type of stewed tomato mixture on top that can be purchased at any Safeway or Trader Joe's. \u00a0One of my table guest actually had his bread plate cleared before he could sample the Bruchetta! \u00a0A testament to their wanting to get us in and out. \u00a0  My entree was Ravioli. \u00a0For anyone who knows me, ravioli is on the shortlist for my last meal on earth. \u00a0The sausage they used had no zing, nor could I taste the nuances of the cheeses they used. \u00a0The sauce, perhaps the most important part, was nothing special either. \u00a0The $18.00 + price was too high for what I got on my plate. \u00a0I tasted the seafood canneloni someone in the party ordered. \u00a0It was a mixture of finely chopped seafood, which was sooooo finely chopped, you could not tell what kind of seafood it was!!!  All in all, the food was just ok. \u00a0It's what I would expect at Macaroni Grill, but not on Green Street in the heart of North Beach. \u00a0Oh how I miss the Gold Spike and Dante Benedetti's New Pisa!",

I think that Stockton St is hard-core Chinatown more than anywhere else in the city. I still get such a kick out of walking around there especially Stockton Street meets Columbus and Green. The intersection is like black bean sauce meets tomato sauce, east meets west, noodle meets pasta, local meets out of townners.  But, traditional NB dining must be Italian. In my mind, North Beach=Italian Food. I don't feel eating anything else but Italian when I am in NB.  Bocce Cafe is one of our early date spot.  I haven't been here for a while, but, .... did not changed very much. You know, what I like about NB is that, .... easy going, stay as long as you want, just talk and hang out kind of attitude. It's not just food. The whole atmosphere.  And this is very typical NB place.  We got pretty ordinary menu as: Carpaccio Fried Calamari Pizza Gnocchi  Beef meat ball  a bottle of red, forgot the name, i think it was $30.  Those were very good, one of our guest ordered steamed vegetable which is just broccoli and carrot, very simple, but it wasn't over cooked, and nicely dressing w/ olive oil and vinegar that I really liked it.  I think it is easy to forget about simple things seem that it is not such a big of deal kind of things. I think the place is under-rated because most food here are not a big deal food. That's what I like about Italian food.  There was a jazz trio on when we were there Saturday night. We had a great time.",

    "review_text": "I'd forgotten how much I liked Italian food until I came to Bocce Cafe. A group of us came here for dinner before going to see Beach Blanket Babylon a couple of blocks away, and it was a good choice. For starters we ordered the calamari and the mussels, and they were both very tasty. I killed the mussels practically by myself, and I slurped every drop of broth that came with it; at least, every drop that I could get on to my spoon. If I could have, I probably would have slurped the broth straight from the pot! But my mama taught me better, unfortunately. For our entrees we tried their ribeye steak, meat lasagna, and linguine with salmon in pesto sauce, and they were also all delicious. I particularly liked the steak and the lasagna, and would definitely order those again when I come back here.   The only thing I would ding them on would be the server we had that night. \u00a0She left us alone for way too long when we were deciding on our entrees, and we finally had to flag a busboy to get her so we could place our orders. \u00a0But, the kitchen more than made up for her slack because the food came out pretty darn quick. \u00a0Hmmm, should that make me suspicious? \u00a0Did you guys just microwave our food?  The restaurant was pretty dead when my group and I arrived, and that scared me into thinking that perhaps it was dead for a reason (i.e. it's not good), but it filled up by the time we left around 7:30 pm. \u00a0I guess Italians dine a little late? \u00a0Anyway, the bill for the 4 of us came to a little over $100 plus tip, which I thought was pretty reasonable. \u00a0All in all, I would definitely consider coming back to Bocce Cafe on those days when I'm not trying to watch my figure. And who am I kidding? The days I try to watch my figure are, sadly, few and far between.",

The little secret corridor you walk through always delights first timers and feels like a little secret place.  Recently, I brought a work party of 6 for lunch and was really disappointed. First, there were only two tables going in the whole place. The lights were mostly off and on a rainy January day, it was really depressing. How about \u00a0floor lamp or something? It was also FREEZING and smelled weird. Any chance for some heat in this huge open space? We were chattering with cold.  Worst part: the service was really slow. The waiter was really nice, but it took FOREVER for our any food to come out and we waited a long time between courses. What was the chef doing back there?  Maybe this is not a good part of town to come for lunch anymore, or maybe the recession is hitting hard, but it's sad to sit virtually alone in a huge dank restaurant and feel good about the experience. Worst part: one person in our party was from the Midwest. She is the type to look for chain restaurants in the greatest dining city in the US (she even went to McDonalds \u00a0on her first day in town- gasp) and I could tell she hated her meal and was thinking Olive Garden could do better. For shame!",

    "review_text": "This is the second time I have been to Bocce Cafe. The first was lunch with my daughter a few years ago. Hubby and I were up in City for a date weekend and I remembered it as being pretty good plus it had a lovely patio.   I would give Bocce 3.5 stars. When we came in there were no tables outside but they gladly sat us inside at a nice table so we could order drinks and an app. All good - had the melon and prosciutto (excuse the spelling). We did not have that long of a wait till an outside table opened up and we moved. Still all good.   Then we waited...and waited...and waited...and..finally the waiter shows up. Takes our order and puts down the most pathetic excuse for bread I have ever had. Did they go to Safeway to get this?? And bad bread in North Beach in SF is just inexcusable.   So now we wait and wait some more. Hubby ordered the Cesar salad and it finally came. Was very good! Then we waited..and waited.. - this was ridiculous. I don't mind a relaxing meal but this was beyond slow. Plus they just let the dirty dishes sit there. Finally, the entrees come (veal for hubby and the crab stuffed ravioli for me). Entrees were very good but sauce on mine was too heavy. Basically drowned out the dish.   We finished our dinner, the waiter finally shows up again, takes the dishes and...wait for it.... hands us the check! No offer of coffee/tea, does not try to sell us dessert, nada. My husband i(s a serious coffee addict) asks if he can have an espresso. I guess this waiter was never taught to up sell. So we wait for that. Finally we are done!   Net: food was OK, atmosphere is wonderful, live music with good band too. Please go out and buy good break - really!   Service: we know the service was good for other tables because we observed other people receiving it. I think we just caught a dud. I think we would come back here for lunch but perhaps not for dinner.",

    "review_text": "Look at me go with all these back-to-back five star reviews. Guess I'm just a lover, and this Bocce Cafe joint is certainly a place for lovers. SO ROMANTICAL. The enchanted forest princess pathway entrance, delicious food and Tiziano chianti are just few of many reasons why Bocce Cafe just got added to my Ti Amo, North Beach! list. Yeah, it ain't no secret I'm a fan of this hood, and neon naked girl signs and drunks getting stoned in the street only add to my affinity for all things NB.   So after we found street parking like a pro, we made our way down this cute little back alley and found ourselves at the entrance of Bocce Cafe around the corner, all vine-covered walls, sparkly lights and trees. Like I said, enchanted forest fantasy land over here. Upon arriving inside, we hesitated at the door wondering if they were closed. \"What time is it, anyway?\" I remember PC asking, because the place was pretty much dead. DEAD. That's right, ALL CAPS dead. There were seriously only two other people dining inside and it was only a little past 8. I blame the economy for the emptiness, because it sure as hell had nothing to do with the service or the food. As soon as we sat down -- at a lovely table near the patio, where there were also twinkly lights decorating the outside (big fan of the xmas lights) -- we got warm bread from our equally warm waiter. Seriously, the guy had such a friendly, respectful demeanor and was quick to bring our wine, which was filled to brim by the way. No dinky half-filled glass so you can swirl it around bullshit here. My dad owned an Italian restaurant in Oakland back in the day and always said the key to their success was in the waiters and the wine. Treat the guests like royalty. Bravo! That's how it should be, am I wrong? Never. So out came our appetizer, the bruschetta, which I barely touched because I was so busy yapping away, but I do remember the few bites I had of it were fabuloso. I ordered the ravioli in meat sauce and my manfriend ordered the linguine with clams. My ravioli was tender and the meat sauce was meaty. What more can you ask for outta ravioli -- tender, meaty, heaven. I didn't try the boy's linguine, but I'm assuming he enjoyed it since he finished his entire bowl. I was waiting for him to pick up the plate and lick it clean, which I would've loved because nothing is more heartwarming than watching someone thoroughly enjoy their first real meal after a long day. Me? I barely ate half my ravioli because I couldn't get enough of that Tiziano! I love good Tuscan vino and this Sangiovese-based red wine really hit the spot. Like really. A LOT. Ha! Something about the spirit of Tiziano Vecellio and a beautiful autumn night in North Beach. What more can you ask of life but for the sun amidst small stars. That, my yelp friends, is a quote straight from Vicellio himself. Yea, I bring the knowledge. Best wreck.",

Well, that changed when I was given a recommendation by somebody to visit here and I was catapulted back, remember what a great time I had once had there. Unfortunately this time around was not quite the same experience.  service was piss poor. We had what felt like 4 people waiting on us and thus, had no idea what the hell was going on; we ordered a round of drinks which we didn't receive and had to ask a few people before we finally got the person who had taken the drink order. She had forgotten about it. \u00a0  I ordered the vegetarian lasagna and to be perfectly honest, was bitterly disappointed. The sauce had this weird kick to it. It tasted like it should have been poored over a burrito rather than pasta.

IF I had not come with a big party I would be complaining about our service. The waiter was pretty quick to take our order for appetizers and drinks but when it came to ordering our entrees it felt like forever. Fortunately, the appetizers and good conversations held me over.  I was disappointed when I got my entree. I got the monacatti (it's like a vegetarian italian burrito) Why did I listen to the waiter? Never listen to the waiter! there's always someone in the background telling them to push certain items. That or my waiter had really bad taste. He said the monacatti was his faavorite dish. Hmm.. So anyways, I pushed the dish aside and mooched off my coworkers spaghetti and meat ball which was much more satisfying. All the entrees were $15+. It's a good deal because of its portion, but all the dishes seem to lack in flavor.  Overall this place is mediocre in food and customer service, \u00a0but it's good for big groups.",

    "review_text": "Walking around North Beach on a mid-day Friday, we avoided the crowds by selecting this Bocce Cafe for lunch. We had the place all to ourselves! A party of 4 ahead of us actually left without being seated because they thought there was something wrong with a N. Beach restaurant without a crowd.  We scored a lovely, sunny table outdoors with a friendly cat alongside. The server was attentive, but not interruptive. We had two salads: Insalata Gamberi (grilled, marinated prawns; feta; organic greens), in which I substituted Caesar dressing for the olive oil; also, the Spinach Salad (not the warm one w/shallots), which had bacon, apple, and bleu cheese, for which we asked for additional oil and vinegar. Ample warm bread with lots of side dishes of whole garlic cloves in dipping oil w/Balsamic. \u00a0It was a perfect lunch, very quiet!  Why not 5 stars? Inside the restaurant, if you don't see the patio, it was dark and kind of cold-seeming. We had already walked down the alleyway and seen the patio out back, so we knew something those folks didn't know who left prematurely: The patio is the seller here. I think the interior decorations could be \"warmer\", and the entire establishment more inviting from the entrance to the alleyway on Green Street. Restaurants in North Beach have a lot of competition (Caffe Sport, Fior d'Italia, and Joe's are all nearby), so putting yourself out front is really important for survival. Also, while the organic greens were much appreciated, I'll harp on this again: No excuse for not having more organics on any menu in the San Francisco Bay Area.   I completely disagree with the reviewer who assigns \"suburbanites\" to this location and mentions the menu rivals Olive Garden. That's cold. And we saw no \"kid-friendly\" indications during our very quiet and enjoyable lunch hour.",

Our entrees fared much better. \u00a0I personally ordered the risotto pescatore. \u00a0Creamy, plump risotto mixed in with shrimp, mussels, calamari, salmon, and clams...I thought it was a wonderful dish that blended all the various flavors of the seafood while still keeping their individual characteristics (i.e. the brinyness of the mussels, the chewy texture of the calamari). \u00a0An awesome dish and something I would definitely go back and try again.  Another plus is that you're mere blocks from a ton of bars and clubs, so it would be a good spot to hit up before going out and having some fun on Broadway.  One word of advice though....  4 Hefeweizens during dinner+ peer pressure from your dinner companions + an insanely hot Russian server who makes Anna Kournikova look like Kathy Bates = embarassing pickup attempts at the end of the night  So if you go back and have Yuliya as your server, apologize on my behalf for anything stupid I might have said...and tell her to call me! \u00a0=)",

We arrived at 7:50 for 8pm reservation - \u00a0told it would be 15 miunutes - made way to bar to get drinks - checked back in at 8:15- only thing the hostess would tell me is that it seems people are lingering longer than usual and had no idea when we would be seated - waited 45 minutes......walked out at 8:35.

We had a huge three tables set up with our own menu that immediately when I sat down saw what I wanted Chicken Parmigiana with prosciutto, mozzarella, chicken on top of a huge bed of veggies! We started off with as much wine and bruschetta as we wanted, I didn't hold back on either. Starting off with a white wine and when I got my food moved to a Noir that I wasn't too fond of so moved back to my Grigio.   After an amazing dinner and snacking on some of my coworkers Ravioli ala Spinaci, we moved over to dessert, Tiramisu. I think I'll fly up to SF take a cab to North Beach and walk inside of Bocce Cafe just for their Tiramisu, it was THAT GOOD! Don't remember how long we were there, but do know we closed the place down.   I have to say, I loved that bartender and his patience with our group.   Oh the bar!",

    "review_text": "Blah. \u00a0Unimpressive, less than run-of-the-mill Italian food. \u00a0One star for the decor on the patio--which is beautifully decorated with white lights. \u00a0There are trees that hang over you while you eat and they were blooming huge, pretty white flowers. \u00a0 The other star is for the fact that I ate for free, which is not really attributable to the restaurant, but to a friend (from out of town) who gave me a gift certificate. \u00a0 We started with the Caprese salad, which was just ok--the tomatoes were a bit under ripe, but otherwise, it was alright. \u00a0The garlic bread was tasty. \u00a0Unfortunately, the meals were quite a disappointment. \u00a0I had the linguini tossed in garlic, oil, and sauteed zucchini. \u00a0The ONLY flavor I could detect was a truckload of salt. \u00a0No garlic, not even olive oil. \u00a0The pasta was also lacking any flavor. \u00a0My boyfriend had the linguini in clam sauce and, instead of a sauce, it was a watery broth that barely coated the linguini. \u00a0Blech. \u00a0In addition, the service was harried and interactions were brief, as it seemed as though our waiter was serving the majority of the restaurant. \u00a0Not his fault, but didn't add any enjoyment to the experience. After providing them with the gift certificate, we sat for a good 20 minutes waiting for the check to see if there was a remainder on the gift certificate (which there should have been, regardless of whether or not I wanted to return) and to see the final tally so we could tip appropriately. \u00a0The server never came back, so we threw some cash on the table and left.  I think if I get a gift certificate here again, I'll just give it away and spend my money elsewhere.",

Now to get on with it- The food really good. I had the meat lasagna- came out super duper hot so I had to wait a little bit to eat it. Really cheesy. Tasty sauce. Scott had the Manicotti. It came out with this beautiful green sauce. A little rich for me, but hey, Manicotti is a rich dish. Defintley some delish Manicotti. I will most defitley be back- really decent prices for some grubbin Italian food.",

    "review_text": "'Went here for my birthday. I said to my family, \"I'd like to go to a place that has an outdoor patio.\" I've never been to A16 but that's where they said they were going to take me. When we got there it was a two hour wait so we headed off to Bocce Cafe.  When I heard \"Cafe\" I pictured something else. I imagined eating on the sidewalk in full view of hundreds of tourists and breathing the exhaust of cars driving by on Columbus Ave. To my surprise it was not. It was tucked away in a little alley and the outdoor patio was intimate and nicely lit with little white lights. Inside was much bigger than I expected too and reminded me of a ski lodge.  The food was good but I think the cioppino was the same thing as the seafood linguine minus the noodles. We had plenty of bread and wine and all in all it was a great experience just because I was with my family... and I didn't have to pay for anything. On that note I can't comment on the prices.  The cat wandering around the patio was unwelcome though. I don't know if it belonged to the owners or if it was just a stray but while I'm eating I don't like animals crawling under the table and rubbing my legs.  I'd still go back here though. I think it would be good for a date or a large group.",

I went this past weekend for the third time and, like the last two visits, the food was great. For appetizers, I have had the bruschetta, carpaccio, and fried calamari. For entrees, I have had cappellini alla tina, eggplant with capers, and the clams linguini. Even the bread they serve is delicious, baked warm every time and brushed with butter.   Essentially, I want to try everything on the menu.  The restaurant is large and can accommodate large groups. It also has a large patio out back with extra seating. The interior reminds me of a winter lodge, with wooden frames and a very home-y feeling.  The only reason I would not give it 5 stars is because the service is consistently slow. The food comes out fine, but the waiters and waitresses seem to take their precious time, even when the restaurant is not busy.",

We clogged the bar up quite a bit until we were seated, but that was more an inconvenience to other diners rather than ourselves. \u00a0I was initially worried about them seating us outside, but the patio is tented and was plenty warm and left lots of room for the younguns to scamper about once they were done picking at their pizzas. \u00a0The staff was friendly, the food delish. \u00a0I'd definitely eat here again next time I'm looking for a spot in NB, and I'd recommend them for group functions too.",
