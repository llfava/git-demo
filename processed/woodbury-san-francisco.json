Since there wasn't a Giants game it wasn't packed, but it wasn't empty either. Perfect spot to gather with co workers or enjoy a beer. I would check to make sure there isn't a game before heading here. (Unless of course, you are looking for a close spot to the stadium to have a beer before YOU are going to a game)  I had the wheat rascal, which I enjoyed, not too sweet. Service was excellent.   The food looked delicious for what it was. My party ordered the tater tots and the sliders. I had one tot which was delicious. The menu was good, prices seemed reasonable. My only problem was that there was no option to order something healthy. \u00a0A side of broccoli would have been great, a soup? Small salad? Asparagus? Saut\u00e9ed Brussel Sprouts? All of these would be a compliment to the other food already on the menu.   I would go back, especially if I was with a party who wanted to order beer and fancy bar food.",

After leaving the Giants game, we stumbled upon this place and hoped it would fulfill our wish for creative cocktails and a cool vibe. Woodbury was exactly what we hoped it would be.   I always call myself a \"beer and wine kinda girl,\" not because I don't like cocktails, but because I'm so damn picky about them. I don't like sweet. I don't like sour. I don't like the taste of vodka. A sour apple martini basically makes me want to puke. This is pretty much what I told the bartender, Kinson. (See, my experience was so good, I made sure to get his name before we left, knowing I had to write a review when I got home.)  Anyway, Kinson whipped me up something that was the perfect balance of fresh and spicy. I can't exactly remember what it was, but I know it had basil in it. A lot of drinks followed, each one more inventive than the last. Each person in my group had at least 2 or 3 drinks, and our bill was half of what we expected it to be. We walked out feeling like we hit the jackpot of all bars. Too bad I live in So Cal and won't be going back any time soon, but I definitely recommend it if you're in the area.",

I got their a bit earlier than them and caught both a Warriors and Giants game on the tvs. Then I found something more fascinating: two people busting out Mortal Kombat and Mario Kart on the video game consoles. Now that's cool. They've got two separate bar areas and have some interesting ideas in the drink dept. A \"Pop In\" menu where they have beers with liquor floats and spirits \"paired\" with beers in complementary fashion. Went with the Oaktown Brown Ale and Averna Amaro float and it was pretty tasty. When the crew showed up we ordered a ton of the menu. Loaded poutine (with skirt steak/bacon), loaded tater tots (with 4505 hot dog). sliders, Woodbury burger, Dry Rub chicken wings. Everything was solid but I really liked the tots and wings. Bree our server took really good care of us and for a 2nd night open they seemed pretty steady. Im imagining the game crowds before hand must have been torture, so Im glad we caught the mellow time while the game was going on",

I've been to this spot when it was previously the Thai restaurant, but coming into Woodbury for the first time gave off a whole different feel. It is much better use of space with ample booths, standing tables and seating along both bars. The decor makes it feel very rustic/hipsterish...stuffed animal heads hanging on the walls, unicycle looking chairs at the bar and to my surprise, the coolest thing I've probably seen in any bar was an original Ninetendo game console with Street Fighter playing. Whaaat?! I'm sure the rest of you 90s babies would go crazy for this as well.  My coworkers originally were supposed to go the The Alchemist bar next door but since they weren't open yet, we decided to grab a drink here and check it out. It was still fairly empty but we still sat ourselves in the back bar where there was more space. We saw the beer and shot specials and went straight for those. $8 for a shot of tequila and a modelo, not bad! By the time it was well past 5:00pm, next door was open but we literally came back here in less than 5 mins because it was so dead next door, plus they had the 80s/90s jams playing, the type that'll make you do a couple body rolls here and there.  We didn't bother looking at the menu for any beers or cocktails and just went for another round of the beer and shots. At this time, spots were well taken over all over the place and I would only expect it to get more crowded on game days. I definitely would come back and try more on the menu, happy hour from 5-7. Good vibes here!",

Like most bars these days the design looks snazzy, but also makes for a loud venue if trying to talk - but I figure that's expected. \u00a0They were out of the mushroom burger which made me sad, but I got the salad with the savory almonds &amp; poached egg - a poached egg makes everything more awesome. \u00a0My guy had the basic cheese burger and it was tasty - the fries - of which I stole TWO were good - crispy but not skinny. I was a fan. \u00a0Our friend had the spicy brat which she said was delicious too. We also had beer and cocktails - I love a Paloma (tequila and grapefruit) - Everything was good and fresh - some reviews say it's pricy, but it seems pretty normal for SF to me. The standout was our service. Jamie M (I think) was super nice and attentive -offering suggestions and keeping the water and the cocktails flowing. \u00a0   Oh and while it was full at 5-6-7pm - by 8-9-10 it wasn't very full - maybe that's the holiday and no game, but it was totally chill and the guy girl ratio was most certainly in favor of the ladies.

The guy before me yacked everywhere in the restroom. Unfortunately the bouncer happened to walk in one person late and blamed me for the mess. I denied the incident and he proceeded to escalate and kicked me out. How about instead of worrying about throwing people out who just spent an arm and a leg on your disgusting drinks, you worry about cleaning up your restrooms? Wasn't going to continue to argue so my group of friends left. If I'm going to yack, Id own it. But at least in the end, I'm not the one who gets to clean the restroom - Poor guy. \u00a0  I will admit, however, that any bar with a video game system is a plus.

The atmosphere is super nice -\u00a0a bit dark, with dark wood everywhere -\u00a0just looks really nice. One look at the menu and again, awesome - they have beer and shots in one drink, or pair them up based on what goes well together. And then, I saw the video games! Who doesn't love a place that has Mario Kart on Super NES at a bar? Sounds great, right?   Well, I've now had two service-oriented issues that took my 5-star rating down to 2 -\u00a0a shame.  Long story short, the first time I was there, my friends and I were ready to pay up, but were told that the POS is down and they can't take credit cards. I get it, that happens... but to wait until we're done and then tell us is super inconvenient. I told this to the bartender (instead of just running home to post it on Yelp), but he could have cared less.  Then... this weekend... I went back. Arrived at 6:45 and the door was locked (which was odd since we were there at the exact same time the week before -\u00a0and, Yelp showed the opening time as 6:30). A couple of seconds later, an employee opened the door and let us in, saying they just opened. Great! Well, we sat down at the bar, and the bartender refused to serve us until 7 -\u00a0he made the comment that they're closed and just ignored us until 7:01. A couple of other people walked in and didn't know what to do. They asked if they could at least sit down he was ready, and he just kind of shrugged and said \"I guess, but I'm not serving anyone until 7\". Sure enough, we sat there and watched him peel oranges and stock fridges. Then at 7:01, he asked us what he can get for us -\u00a0almost as if we just walked in the door. It was odd, and was very poor service. I get it -\u00a0you don't open until 7 -\u00a0well adjust your hours online, and at the very least, tell your doorman not to let people in the bar.

A solid three stars, only because I'm a fan of fancy cocktails and places that are a bit more conducive to non-shouting conversations, and Woodbury doesn't cater to that really. If you like something a bit more pub-y though, definitely come check it out.  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - Plenty of space to maneuver about, until it gets crowded anyway.

Bartender says it's not part of happy hour. \u00a0I pointed out that we ordered a well cosmo, and well drinks are discounted. \u00a0Female bartender stepped in, easily \u00a0and confidently saying it's $2 off. \u00a0Fine, cool, whatever. \u00a0Maybe he's new... \u00a0  Mom ordered mushroom sandwich, she said it was tasty. Her salt and peppered fries were awesome. \u00a0Sister and I ordered loaded poutine. \u00a0Mushroom gravy was overseasoned with a mystery ingredient, but overall yummy. \u00a0I had a full conversation with male bartender about my desire for jalapenos, and after confirming he had some, they never came. \u00a0 Sister also ordered the bratwurst sausage, which she was looking forward to, but never came. \u00a0Isok, half order of poutine was enough food after all. \u00a0Food was good, little overpriced for what we got, and no happy hour food specials like we had hoped for. \u00a0  Sister and I agreed to go back a little later next time, as it started to fill up as we were leaving, and just drink beer, eat fries, and be open to the scene.",

Other than that...the place seems to be a nice chill place to grab a few drinks and see some old (new) friends. However, the music was way too loud for a bar...there was no dance floor...so it might be wise to lower the music so people can actually hear each other.  I wasn't sure if there was a special or not, but I got charged $8 for just a blue moon. Pretty pricey for just a beer.  I did have a good time as I saw a bunch of old friends.

Next to the bar they offer both of these systems and wall mounted TVs free to play. A few beers and some video games took us right back to our childhood and sparked some fun competition in Mario Cart.  Unfortunately, despite the great atmosphere, the great beer and drink selection, I have to deduct a star because of one incident. After my friend and I continuing to order drinks without providing a card or opening a tab, our other friend shows up and hands the bartender his card; all seems normal. It wasn't until about 15 minutes later, when we wanted to close out, that we're told that the card processing system is down and we need cash. The bartender admitted to knowing this since the 45 minutes we have been there. To resolve the issue, we each had to go to the adjacent building and use the ATM. While not a huge inconvenience, it could have been mentioned much sooner and avoided altogether.  I will still recommend Woodbury to friends and family in the area based on everything that is great about the place.",

I didn't care for it, but it wasn't hard to shoot.  Food wise, we ordered: *Poutine ($8): mushroom gravy, house ricotta, fried shallots; Get loaded (+$5): skirt steak, bacon *Brussels sprouts ($8): bacon, shallots, garlic confit, white wine, herb butter, korean chili flakes, parmesan *Shishito peppers ($5): blistered, citrus oil, lemon garlic aioli *Tots ($5): with dipping sauce *Chili cheese tots ($10): house chili, cheese sauce, creme fraiche, scallions  My favorites were the Shishito peppers and Chili cheese tots. The peppers had a nice smoke. I barely used the citrus aioli since it was a little too think for dipping. Plus, the peppers were good on their own! The chili cheese tots were also delicious. The chili didn't have beans which was great for me since I hate beans. And the cheese was ooey, gooey and comforting! The rest of the dishes were okay. I didn't care for the poutine though. It was hard to get a bite with everything and I didn't care for the ricotta.  We came on a Friday night, so the place was pretty busy.

    "review_text": "Casey U. muses on the formula to make a new bar in San Francisco sucessful:  A new, popular bar should focus on fancy-ass liquor, and pour beer for a dollar or two more than anywhere else. It should have black butte porter for seven dollars, and P.B.R. for four bucks, and bad wine, but it should be alright because they're served in mason jars. It should have poutine on the menu, and tater tots, and a burger for over 15 dollars. The poutine should be mediocre, with sad wilted fries, sad, flavorless gravy, and an artesinal cheese which does not resemble the classic curd in any way, shape, or form (which is a travesty guaranteed to offend any self-respecting Montrealer). The bar should have a SNES in the corner with Mario Kart and Super Mario Brothers for children of the nineties with too much disposable income to get their daily bath of nostalgia while indulging in their long-repressed competitive impulses. A hip bar should have meats with a pedigree, and menus printed on high-quality paper that looks like its been through a war.  Walking in to this hypothetical bar, you should feel unworthy if you make less than 75k a year. The clientele should range from 21-35 (in this town, if you're any older, you're finished), and everyone should have full heads of hair. There should be conspicuous displays of taxidermy (which means the bar is edgy), and strange chairs, possibly in the shape of unicycles (which means the bar is unique), and bartenders in ball-caps (which means that the bar is cool). It should be a place in a formerly bad part of town where you feel great taking profile pictures, and using your new selfie-pole (which I just found out is not a euphemism for a beef bayonet...if you know what I mean), and Instagramming your night for the world to see. It is a place of style, rather then substance.  Well, hello Woodbury. It seems I've accidentally described you, right down to the tragic Poutine. You do the generic new bar thing well, but, to my untrained, impoverished, and unhip eyes, you're a totally unremarkable place.",
