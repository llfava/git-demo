Smuggler's Cove is a tight little space that really makes you feel like you are sailing away on the seven seas. \u00a0The drinks are carefully and exquisitely prepared with great attention to detail. \u00a0I especially like the re-creation of famous drinks from the days of yore at Trader Vics. \u00a0  I had the Navy Grog and it was P-E-R-F-E-C-T-L-Y done; not too sweet and not too tart with just the right mix of tropical fruit juices, spices and rum. \u00a0It was fun watching the bartender prepare the various specialty rum drinks, which I think total over 80. \u00a0Especially entertaining was the flaming \"Volcano\" which we'll have to try the next time we visit.  As one of the early visitors to \"Bourbon and Branch\", which I thought was an over-hyped and pretentious joke, I'm not a big fan of these theme-based watering holes. \u00a0But Smuggler's Cove won me over and I will be back. \u00a0The place is comfortable, you can actually talk to other people without screaming and the staff seems to appreciate their customers. \u00a0  I'd give Smuggler's Cove a \"5\" if it weren't for the fact that its greatest asset also appears to be its greatest liability; the complexity of its drinks. \u00a0These cocktails take time to build and that makes the drink-making pace a little slow. \u00a0I'm not sure how to overcome that and perhaps in the long-term it won't matter. \u00a0But I think if this place gets too crowded, it will be difficult for the bartenders to keep-up with the thirsty crowd. \u00a0Then again, given these libations aren't your typical fare, the extra wait is probably worth it.",

That being said, it's the kind of place you want to go all the time, especially if you want to escape reality in a three level nautical, pirate, tiki wonderland. I am in favor of any and all excuses to drink copious amounts of alcohol served in a skull with fire coming out of it. Rum loving pyromaniacs, get ready to cry tears of happiness.   First things first, the place has a strict capacity policy, it can be a drag trying to get in here on a busy night. I wouldn't suggest it for groups and I also would make an effort to all arrive at the same time so no one gets stuck outside, waiting in line. The bouncers I've come across have been pretty chill and seem make it fair for everyone.   Second, leave your indecisive friends at home. They have a menu that makes Tolstoy seem like a breezy read. A paragraph per drink. I'd probably have to be carried out of here if I tried everything that caught my eye. The bartenders are pros and raise the bar in terms of the assembly, taste, and presentation. If I'm going to stray from my beloved whiskey and be in an ultra kitschy environment, I pray the drinks will do their job and taste like sweet ambrosia.   While it can be hard to actually get your cocktails in an expedient fashion, the highlights include the Volcano and Jamaican Planters Punch. Great value for what you get considering SF drink prices.   Third, they may have multiple floors and bars but it still only houses like 50 people and it gets particularly intimate especially on weekends. I don't mean intimate in the sexy sense of the word. I mean it in the pressed up against drunk strangers spilling sticky drinks on your open toe pumps kind of way. If you're trying to get loose at prime time, you might want to skip wearing that gorgeous white chiffon.   Fourth, the music is low enough to have a conversation so make this a destination for a first date. If the person ends up being boring, you'll be able to break the ice just by gawking at the decor. I mean, they even have a fountain. Worst come to worst, it's so dark that it's easy to make a clean exit.   *Insert inane pirate joke here*.",

Smuggler's is definitely a diamond in the rough! Strong drinks with an array of rum choices. A little pricey in my opinion though (~$15/drink). Pirate decor decked out in the 3 story interior (on subgrade and other second floor). Seating is tough so my friends and I got snuffed sitting by the miniature waterfall downstairs. Lighting is horrible (makes it more authentically dingy?) so we had a tough time reading off the menu. It's actually fun watching the bartenders make the drinks but I wouldn't come back unless someone else wanted to see this place for the first time .   I recommend the sidewinder's fang for people who like fruity drinks and don't want that extra kick. If you order the puka punch you definitely get your money's worth in alcohol--a little stronger but still delicious. One of my friends ordered a zombie/dead man something and that tasted like death--basically a mixed drink that only tasted like rum+cinnamon which is cool if you're into that.",

However, all of Yelp seems to know about it, so obviously they are much cooler than me.   But I digress. Having a bar so close totally enables my alcoholism. And it's both small and not too loud, which are definite pluses.  However, it's not a dive, which is a mild minus. The decor is actually pretty cool - it's pirate themed. I am a bad pirate aficionado, having only seen the second Pirates of the Caribbean, but not the first or third. I don't own a pirate hat, so I wasn't sure that I would get in, but the bouncer let me in with minimal heckling (actually, he was really cool).  Inside, there are three levels. There's kind of a balcony thing, which was occupied by a large party. Then there is a street level bar, and an underground bar. It's kind of cozy, but seems to work out pretty well. We found a seat no problem. They say on their website that capacity is 49, and considering how crowded it was by about 8 on a Thursday, I can imagine they hit it.  It seems like a lot of the drinks here are rum-based. I'm not all that into rum, so I ordered the house beer. It was pretty good, almost a lighter Guinness (I know, that's sacrilege). Came to $10 I think for two beers, so not too bad.  Overall, recommended. I will definitely come back.

The place is traditional tiki with no windows so a dark ambiance. There are small pools and water features. The walls are decorated with pirate paraphernalia. There are three levels, two different bars.  This is a small place. If you want a seat, get here early. They open at 5pm so I like to get there soon after. The place can get crowded and stuffy very quickly. On weekends, expect a line.  The bartenders make some classic and innovative tiki drinks. Get the Smuggler's Rum Barrel and you will not be disappointed. If you have a large party consider getting a bowl for maximum fun and drinking.  This place is seriously amazing and anyone visiting San Francisco should try this place.",

The Smugglers Cove is a rad little tiki bar near the heart of San Francisco. What looks like nothing on the outside (I would have walked right past it if i hadn't had my GPS on) transforms to a tropical hideaway the moment you walk into the door.   Smugglers Cove features over 300 types of rum. The drink menu is quite large and extensive and is broken down into different categories. They have original rum drinks that the royal navy would drink (whilst hunting down pirates I hope), Prohibition Era Rum drinks, Caribbean Rum drinks, and modern day contemporary drinks. Everything is handcrafted with care. You can really tell that the bartenders have a passion for what they do, it really shows in the drinks they create. I didn't get to try anything that they light on fire, but I was very happy with my drinks. The Original Grog is AMAZING.  I cant wait to visit again on my next trip into San Francisco. It was one of the biggest highlights of my trip.",

Albeit drinks are on the pricy side, the service, ambience, and revelry that go on there make them worth every nickel and dime you spend.

First of all, the comment that it looks to be straight out of the Pirates of the Caribbean set is spot on...gotta love the skulls and petrified puffin fish hanging on the ceilings. The waterfall and pond with the back lights was also fun and made for a very laid back and tropical atmosphere. I ordered the Kona cocktail, a hot buttered rum, a volcano and a few others that I can't remember the names of now (I advise eating a large meal of carbs and/or melted cheese before hand in order to sop up all the rum that will be consumed...I made the mistake of going in on an empty stomach). Even in July, the hot buttered rum transported me to those cold winter days where you would sit by a fire drinking this classic rum cocktail. I loved it. Contrary to the butter laden rum drink, the Kona, on the other hand, was light and fruity. I loved the passion fruit and the flower that was placed in the glass as a decoration. For the volcano, you can't get much better than lighting a huge pot of alcohol on fire and having sparks fly everywhere. This was probably my favorite cold drink and I would order it again in a heart beat. The bar tender was amusingly sarcastic, which made for great conversation, and he really took his time preparing all the cocktails to perfection. All in all, a great experience and a nice way to celebrate any special occasion.",

Super-cute bar with plenty of pirate booty (and boot-ay...no Johnny Depp lookalikes, sadly, but hats off to all the hotties in SF). The menu is like a novella--waaay too many words for when you're on your third bar of the night. I selected Don's Original Grog for both its back-to-basics title and one-liner description. I think this place only has like a 50-person capacity, and it's new enough that it stays full. Good for them, but they should learn to keep a good crowd from affecting their service. I waited for-e-vah for my drink, and would have been considerably more annoyed had the bartender not at least excused himself with a cute \"I've got a lot of drinks on deck\" quip. Turns out, grog is not really my thing. Or more likely, rum is not really my thing (no thanks to a bad college experience involving the Capn' and elevated cage dancing).

After waiting literally an hour outside this establishment (an absolute must since they allow a very specific number of people in at a time... good for crowd control, bad for late-comers), I came in expecting to be whisked into a pseudo-paradise with inspired rum drinks and a liveliness and hustle to match.  When I entered, I turned to the right to see their \"waterfall,\" which is really just a water trickle down some rocks, and a generally more relaxed atmosphere. We headed downstairs to the basement and all ordered different drinks. Their menu is expansive, and from the rum drinks I tried, they weren't bad, though none of them were particularly amazing. Part of this could be because it takes them about 15 minutes to make a drink at the bar, and after waiting outside for so long in the cold, I was expecting a bit more.  Some of the pros are that you won't feel claustrophobic while you are inside. Their crowd control does ensure that there are always a manageable number of people inside, and your group can very easily find seats. I think if I would have come here earlier, my experience would have been better, but when people hyped it up so much on the outside, it really wouldn't be able to meet my expectations.  So I think this is a perfectly fine bar. Their scorpion bowl drink looked really interesting too (they set that bad boy on fire!), but I think this is mainly a good place to bring friends to show them something new. Probably won't be a place I'll frequent or \"dive\" into on a weekly basis.",

She almost had trouble meeting the drink minimum despite there being a line at the bar for most of the night - perhaps they could bring another bartender on for events like this?

I really enjoyed the Daiquiri #3 and the Daisy, but my friends who don't like rum had a much smaller menu to choose from and one complained of his bourbon drink being weak.  The atmosphere is great, the drinks are delicious (if somewhat on the pricey side - $9-13 per drink), and the bartender was really friendly and helpful when I asked for suggestions.

And for abut $10 a drink, it's totally worth it -- I'm normally more of a wine girl and rarely like mixed drinks, but these were definitely worth making an exception.   The decor is also pretty sweet if you're into the pirate ship theme. Each floor has some unique twist on that theme, but all of them offer relatively limited seating options (but it's a small space in general, so what can you do?). Not really a problem to stand around, unless you want one of their punch bowls -- complete with a flashy fire show -- which requires some kind of tabletop (wooden, not the leather one by the pool) for them to serve it to you.   I thought it was kind of strange that there wasn't any music playing, so every room basically sounded like you're listening in on a bunch of random people's conversations because, well, that's what it was.

There's a small pool of water and dark walls--you feel like you're actually in the underbelly of a pirate ship. Warning: you may not be able to suppress singing a little \"yo ho yo ho, it's a pirate's life for me.\" ;-) - Menu: huge one given to you upon entry and lots of good stuff in there. Primarily rum, but there are other options if that's not your thing (though this would be the place to try). They have standards like mai tais and daiquiris to ones I've never heard of: mostly filled with different fruit juices and spices.  - Bowls: if you have a group it's fun to get one of these, see it be lit up, and drink through long straws. Note to get a more exciting fire show, you need to get the other bowl that's not the scorpion.   Lowlights: - Small place: can get crowded so come early if you want to grab a spot to sit - Drinks speed: since each is crafted with a large handful of ingredients, they can be a wait before you can take your first sip - Size: some drinks come in super small glasses and you get through them quickly in a few sips :-o  Had a great time here on a Friday night and I'll definitely be back.",

As mentioned in most reviews- the line can get pretty long. But I would recommend maybe doing a drink here before dinner- beat the crowd and maybe not feel too sick to go out afterwards?",

My friends arrived before me and the doorman wouldn't let me join them inside without waiting in line, so I was stuck in line by myself for 30 minutes. Bummer but the cove made up for the wait!",

Smuggler's Cove is located kind of in the middle of a housing area, and if it's not for the incredible long lines that it usually has, you'd probably miss it walking by. On the outside, there really isn't much decor. As soon as you step in though, it's pirate heaven!  Drinks are awesome, my best advice is to go with a few people and try as many drinks as possible. They have a huge selection and they even have a punch bowl style drink that is perfect for big groups.   If you are there just to hang out and enjoy the ambiance, you will have a decent time. But if you really enjoy rum and the Tiki culture, this is the place for you!  Drinks - 9/10 Prices - probably on the expensive side but hey, it's damn good! Ambiance - Its really dark, but the decor is very pirate-themed, including a tiny waterfall!",

While the bar is fairly small there are three separate levels. You enter on the second floor which has it's own bar and some limited seating around the bar and the wall. Downstairs (where we spent most of our time) there is a rock wall that has water running down it, giving the whole sunken cave feel. BE AWARE though, the water does splash on part of the bench that runs along the fountain.  We came as everyone was finishing their happy hour drinks (about 6:30 on a Sunday) and it was busy! No seating was available for the first half hour that we were there, but then at 7 everything suddenly opened, it was easier to get drinks, seats and more comfortable.  The bartender was extremely nice, he had been there since the opening of the bar over four years ago. All of the drinks that we had were awesome but the tops:  Don's Own Grog - A mixture of many different ingredients including: ground spices and an on location made blackberry liqueur. Far   Sidwinder's Fang - More citrus with lime, orange and passion fruit.  Both are rum drinks, which is kind of Smuggler's Cove's thing, and rightfully so!  Definitely worth checking out!",

Neither of us were thrilled with our second choices. \u00a0We wanted to try something different (minimum $9-10 per drink), so I ordered a second round from the apparently \"best mixologist in the country\". \u00a0My drink lost much of its flavor because this mixologist made the drink with 3/4 soda. \u00a0Bubbles aren't really my thing, as I felt I was drinking a flavored soda from can. When I very sweetly asked to bartender to counter off the soda with something - I got treated as if I had insulted the art form. \u00a0I was treated very rudely - thought my head was going to get cut off, again despite being super appreciative about it. \u00a0The other flavors were so good, I just wanted to taste them, not bubbles. \u00a0Anyway, they may be the best mixologist, but it is always a little risky to take one's job too seriously. \u00a0People have different palettes and that's a fact. The experience left a bitter taste - even someone at the bar noticed the bartender's rude response.  Otherwise, I think the place is very cool. \u00a0The decor is fun and interesting. \u00a0The seating isn't super flexible and it is a bit drafty downstairs on a cold day. \u00a0I would go back again, but probably wouldn't be too adventurous with the drink orders.",

    "review_text": "From the outside, during a torrential storm for SF, this bar is very unassuming, with its blacked out windows and small sign outside. This definitely fits into the motif of the bar, as stepping in the door reveals an amazing treasure tucked in Lower Haight.   The decorations and design of the bar could not be more spot-on for a Smuggler's Cave with a 3 level design of overhang/bar/basement. I'm especially impressed with the details, such as \"rhum\" crate tables, industrial-grade metal steps, stone wall with a waterfall, globular lighting, and lots of palm fronds all around.   The menu is just as detailed and flavorful. Each drink listing not only tells you the ingredients, but also provides a nice little description of the drink, from its history to how it should be enjoyed. One standout that our group enjoyed is the Hot Buttered Rum drink. It looks like watered down hot chocolate with a cinnamon stick thrown in, but it tastes like magic and was exceptionally delicious, considering the downpour happening outside. At the end of our stay, a nearby group ordered the Volcano, which is a group drink, complete with burning crouton. I'll definitely try that next time I'm there.  Their rum selection is also top notch. I'm personally a fan of brown sugar Jamaican rum, and was glad to find it a regular ingredient in many of their cocktails.   The only \"negatives\" I can think of are that it's a smallish bar (max 49 people) so you'll likely have to wait in line to get in, or go early to get a seat, the drinks are city-priced (expect to spend about $10 a drink), it's first and foremost a rum bar so order a rum drink, and there isn't food, so it's a good idea to eat beforehand.",

To get to the point, when I ordered our drinks, the bar tender offered to make us \"5 Hurricanes.\" \u00a0Not one of the drinks I ordered was a hurricane so I was a little surprised. \u00a0 I said we wanted the drinks I ordered and she said \" Well, it will be a lot faster if I just make you five Hurricanes because the drinks you ordered are really complicated.\" \u00a0  Now tell me why you would have a menu with 75 different drinks on it if the bar tender is going to tell you what to order because it would make her life easier??????? Being more of a bourbon girl myself, I went to this place to order a creepy fruity drink for the ambience. \u00a0Go to any bar anywhere to get a Makers Mark, \u00a0go to a pirate theme bar and I want my umbrella drink with 15 different types of fruit.  I was confused but told her to keep our order and we would be happy to wait. \u00a0Well, 30 minutes later, I was not so keen on waiting anymore. \u00a0I walked up to the bar and asked if she had even started our drinks. \u00a0She said yes but I looked at the bar and saw NOT ONE drink started. \u00a0So I asked again and she said \"No, but I will get to it right now.\" \u00a0 \u00a0Needless to say, I canceled our order and we left. \u00a0  So my question for Smuggler's Cove is this:  \" Why have such an extensive drink menu if your bar tender is going to complain about the drinks on YOUR MENU and not make them!\"",

My gal had the Daisy Santiago - liked the drink but not the crushed ice, which I and our third party agreed takes some getting used to.  I had the Twelve Mile Limit and found it tasty and would have it again but I preferred my second drink which was just a pour of a spicy sugar cane (not molasses) rum. Great!  Third friend had the El Presidente which of the four drinks I tasted was least desirable as I felt it was a bit too orange-y...but hey, that's just me.  Hung out upstairs and since it was the end of the holidays (post NYE) it was pretty mellow which we enjoyed.

By 6:30pm in Saturday night the place was packed; it opens at 5. I ordered a drink that I've never had and of course it was made with rum. I haven't enjoyed a rum drink in a while since I had one too many nights of Rum and Cokes made with bad rum.   The place was packed with typical folks I woul have assumed would be at a pirate/tiki/Old Salt hang out. A couple of John Lassetter look alikes, a rock-a-Billy couple downstairs and the rest, local bar hoppers.   The service was a bit lacking. I think people coming in that are new need some help in directing the newcomer through their special drink tasting they claim to be the focus of the bar. As I waited to make my orderI I mentioned to a woman in front of me in line for orders, \"I hope these drinks are worth the wait.\" sarcastically. She responded by saying,\"Im used to this kind of wait.\" guess it was just not funny but I thought the wait just to order was a bit much. The drinks were worth the wait though.  Being as it was busy it took a few minutes to land a space to sit. With three levels, I figured they should be a place to cop a squat.  Athmosphere was perfect and the bartender at least in the main level was very enjoyable an helpful. She knew about the drinks and the rums. Suggest this place at 5 when they open so u beat the rush.   Look for the red light above the door.",

I'll admit, the decor was pretty cool and it was really tempting to say \"ahoy mate!\" about every ten minutes...  After my date finished rambling about his ex-girlfriend, I was tempted to order another giant punch bowl, but I wanted to fit into my skinny jeans the next day. This is why I order beer or whiskey.   All in all... It was a conglomeration of \"b*tch\" drinks... So gentlemen, consider this place for the ladies that \"don't like to taste the alcohol\" ;)",

    "review_text": "Smuggler's Cove has a lot of potential... potentially.  Entering the place looks like you are going into an illegal after hours club. Not sure whats up with that? They definitely need a make over out front. Doorman was cool. Recommended some drinks.  Inside, the decor and layout, which is sort of a Pirates of the Caribbean/Disney/Hawaiian theme...pretty cool. Feels like you are on vacation. 3 levels. Small space. The upstairs, being the best of the three levels. The downstairs bar is hard to navigate to when there is people sitting and hanging out. Also, the bartender seemed like an ass and said there was a line!? When \"bar people\" are sitting at the bar, in your way, the only way to order is to weave thru or around them. Lines are for McDonalds.   As for the drinks, the two I sampled were both very unique and tasty but it becomes quickly apparent that it takes forever to get a drink because of the process that goes into building them. I think two bartenders at each bar in a must. One bartender isn't enough, period. The other big problem is they have a F-ing booklet for a drink menu. People can;'t handle that kind of selection. Definitely not at a bar. Got to treat them more like third graders and crayons. You get these colors, that's it. A dude I met there named Brian who lives nearby joked \"they need cliff's notes.\"   However, the most blatant problem that stood out above and beyond all others and caused me and my friend to feel uncomfortable was simple: There was NO MUSIC.  Yes, I said it.   No music. Can you believe that? I still can't.  They have this cool theme that they obviously spent a lot of effort with and there is no surround sound. No surfer music, no hula music, no pirate music, no rock n roll, no biggie, no Kanye, no GaGa, nuthin.   (there was music for brief time heard downstairs but it was sporadic at best and the sound trickled out at such a low level that i wasn't sure if it was real or in my head)  Again, lots of potential. Its new. They could get it together and be rockin' hard by February. Hope so! If not, good luck.",

The staff is amazingly well versed in the history and knowledge of all of their rums that I've come to try. Their menu of rum ranges from samples, to shots, and the infamous scorpion bowls. If you're new to the rum scene, don't be shy and ask one of the bar tenders- they're friendly and willing to bring you in as a part of their cult following.   They're open from 5pm to 1:15am daily and serve happy hour from 5-6pm, where all of their drinks have special \u00a0HH pricing. *Essential tip* Get there early and be on the look out for open seats/tables- the secret to this hidden cove is out and aside from the wall to wall stacks of rum, open seating is considered a treasure there as well.   *For the daring* If you sample 100 of their rums you get your name forever remembered on a plaque on the wall of the Cove AND you receive exclusive access to 100 of their reserved rum stash not on sale to the public! If you sample 200, you are graced by the Rum Deities and earn an all expense paid trip to visit a random distillery and then given a tour by the owner!   If you weren't a rum lover before, stop by Smuggler's Cove for a tasting or a bowl and you'll find yourself embarking on a journey your inner-pirate will definitely thank you for!",

Except it gets a little heated. No wonder the negative service reviews I wouldn't want to be working here when its crowded.   Service: The bartenders and security have been over the top nice to me every time I have been here. One time i was trying to leave and cash out and the bartender could tell I was getting a little bit irritated by the stuffiness so she cashed me out out of order!   Another time, a bartender, gruff guy, closed my tab when I meant to order another drink at closing time. I was expecting to hear it b/c it was a frozen drink, well not at all. He was super nice about it.   I also have had really positive experiences with security. They even let my obviously old enough balding 32 year old friend in without an ID, saving us a trip home.   That said I have read the reviews and I think management should respond with what has been done about these allegations of racism, homophobia, lying, jerkery etc, theres so many of them it makes me wonder if my experience is unique, or if its an old problem since solved or : \\.   Finally, I might add the patrons of this bar are a combination of law students, techies, concert goers and other young people. Some guy had a shirt on that said \"protect the shire\" for example.... therefore read the reviews with a grain of salt given who they are coming from.  Nonetheless, five stars; I can only speak to my experience on the service.",

I prefer to avoid the annoying Friday stupor and actually read the inciting menu and enjoy tasting the quality rum they serve. Redbull and vodka they have not, and cosmos are also a no-can-do, they do it to weed out those annoying drinkers. It's a pirates cove- complete with sunken treasure in the fountain downstairs, and three small floors (down and up from the main) that each feature their own bar to get your drinks on many levels. They do have scorpion bowls and the like, easy-to-get-drunk-on drinks, but at $12 a pop, wouldn't you rather enjoy a fine crafted cocktail? They even have beer and wine for those non-rum drinkers. They squeeze their own citrus, grate their own cinnamon, and shake with vigor for a perfect froth.  Melissa was a friendly cocktail crafter, easy to talk to and easy to get a drink ordered.",

    "review_text": "What do I say here about Smugglers Cove. A secret site of secrets showed me that there was a secret bar located just ironically near where I work. So secret it was that I never knew a place like this existed outside the Tonga Room - which by the way, is a slightly different feel as its Polynesian and this is more but not fully Caribbean.  I was thrilled when almost everyone I talked to knew of this place, told me to expect to get drunk on one drink, and that due to my childhood of growing up with a mother who was born in early 1960s Hawaii who was into the Exotica Kitsch, I knew this was going to be the place for me. So I found the red light, walked in, and immediately felt like I walked into a tall, dimly lit, secret rum runner cave. There was a waterfall, globe lights, wicker furniture and best of all, Exotica cocktail music playing, to which I commented to my friend attending with me, \"Walter Wanderley is playing\" - she had no idea who it was. Which reminds me, if you are a Lex Baxter, Martin Denny, Walter Wanderley, Arthur Lyman, Kava Kon, or Tikiyaki Orchestra (who sometimes plays here) fans, then this is the place for you. It is more Caribbean than Polynesian however make no mistake the Tiki Gods from the North and South Pacific are present in abundance if you look closely. This bar is not short on Volcano's or Skulls either!  If you want to soak in the atmosphere and watch people walk in and be amazed, listen to some great music (a little loudly), I suggest heading upstairs and sitting near the railing that overlooks the bar. There, you will be up high, next to all the rum barrels and globe lights and get a feel for what it is like to be perched high up in a cave. For a moment, I almost felt I was in Thunderball or some other James Bond 60's movie. This wont make sense to you until you actually walk in, sit down, and start drinking. You will know exactly what I mean.   If you want something a little more romantic, or dark and deep, and secret and feeling a little mischievous, head downstairs, the darker lower level is the bowels of the cave, where the waterfall plunges and where there is room to stand and dance a little on an empty night. The bar there is larger, but not always serviced during the week. Sometimes people wonder down, sometimes its more secluded, but regardless its definitely worth a walk down the grated catwalk stairs over the waterfall. Looking to be a little more social, wanna get that Volcano or Scorpion drink ($36-ish) but dont have friends to share it? Sit on the main level (the middle floor) and ask some of the friendly, social regulars to share it with you. Paying $36 for the experience of watching the Bartender or Bartendress light a rather large bowl of alcohol you will soon enjoy on fire is pretty much worth it alone, however, whats in the bowl is not only going to get you so into the mood of Exotica, but you literally will forget that you are in San Francisco and not French Polynesia, Hawaii, or Port Royal or Tortuga Island if you know what I mean, by the time youre finished drinking it. Drinks are rather pricey, I will admit that, NOTHING seems to be under $10, and the average is $11-16 PER DRINK. Which kinda is a little too high in my opinion, until \u00a0you realize that the ingredients are not only fresh juices and fruits, but with over (and I lost count) 50 types of rum from different nations, 300 years of rum history, drinks that go back from the 1700's all the way to today, and bartenders/bartendresses that really take their time and pride in making a drink worthy of being ingested, yeah, Id say that seems a very fair price. Not to mention, the atmosphere alone is amazing so consider it almost like an admission fee the first drink, and each other drink after, you likely will forget they are as high priced as they are. Are they worth it in a word, absolutely. Smugglers Cove really is a hidden gem - matter of fact, I think the walls might have some hidden gems and treasure in them, I swear I saw some - and if you ever wanted bragging rights to be a pirate, be at one of the top 50 bars in the world, or just wanted a little of that Pirates Of The Caribbean Disneyland atmosphere without actually going to Disneyland, you came to the right place.",

You have to have a table to order a bowl, FYI. We felt a bit rushed, so we had to make an early departure and move onto our next destination. I guess you could say we had to \"abandon ship\"...haha!

Rum for the most part doesn't get the respect it deserves. \u00a0At least not when compared to libations like fine wine and scotch. \u00a0Smuggler's Cove is here to change all that. \u00a0This is probably the only place on Earth where you can get an expertly mixed (Tiki) Navy Grog and a (Cuban) Daiquri and a former long lost rum cocktail that dates back centuries without having to leave your bar stool. \u00a0  Rum is historic. Rum has shaped cultures. Rum is complex and sophisticated. \u00a0Smuggler's Cove is the place to experience that. \u00a0   These drinks are works of art. \u00a0Your bartender is a master ninja of mixology. \u00a0Be patient, this takes a little longer than your usual Red Bull and Vodka. \u00a0 \u00a0   Oh and that decor, yes I know it vibes \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" but it's really about 18th Century West Indies rum smuggling.

I wasn't much of a fan of rum until I began coming here, sampling several of their rums as part of their Rumbustion Society. Ask for a membership card when you go.  Apart from that, the cocktails are great, made from many ingredients, and they're much stronger than they taste. The bartenders are pretty cool and are pretty diligent when it comes to making your drink. It's like an art.  The atmosphere is great. The interior is beautifully decorated and the people who go here are pretty cool. We meet new people every time we go, there's a crowd there every night of the weeks, but expect a line on Friday and Saturday after 8pm.  If it's your first time, I recommend giving the Hot Buttered Rum and Dead Reckoning a try. At times, however, it can take a while until you get your drink as there's only a few bartenders.",

There was a line outside, but it ended up only being about a 10-minute wait for us to get inside. Btw, don't try to cut in line- the bouncer will call you out. Lol  So we got inside inside and were awed by the decor. Ever seen The Goonies? That's what Smugglers Cove reminds me of. Although it technically is 3-stories, it is very small, and with a lot of people there it gets cramped easily. You're lucky if you find a place to sit.   As far as drinks go, I was quite impressed! I tried the Hot Butter Rum, at the recommendation of an intoxicated person in line, and it was so good! I also got the coveted Rum Barrel, which was as delightful to drink as it was to look at. My friends were happy with their drinks as well, which included the Zombie, Sidewinder, Dark &amp; Stormy, and Scorpion Bowl.   The only problem we had was with the long-haired bartender downstairs. I don't care how bad of a day you are having, you don't take it out on your customers. He made the wrong drink, and instead of setting it aside and making the correct drink, he took it and slammed it into the trash. Then he left the bar area, came back with a bucket of ice, and made his way through the crowd like a running back, with no regard for the people who were standing. At least the other bartenders made up for it.   My friends and I plan on going back, we just hope Long Hair isn't there cuz he might Spartan Kick us next time!",

Who else but these highly trained bartenders can mix together these fine ingredients via droplets and shakers and a dash of voodoo, to create for you these drinkable visual and gustatory works of art?  Why else but to relax and mingle with a quite varied crowd, melting into the sexy darkness such as Smuggler's Cove would you even go to a bar in the first place?  And finally, (perhaps most importantly),  When do you plan on returning here, and can I join you? \u00a0(And by all means if you haven't checked this place out yet, What the bleep are you waiting for?!?)  I drink by the seasons here: coconutty, fruity libations such as the Tradewinds in the summer, nutmeg spicy originals like the Pupule in the fall, traditional but out-of-this-world perfection of Hot buttered rum in the winter, and spunky &amp; potent drinks like the Jet pilot or Painkiller in the spring. \u00a0  You see, it is a bar for all seasons, the answer to all your questions. \u00a0It is, in short, my favorite bar of all time.",

I was out with a group of four and we were thirsty and hungry for trouble. I don't know the area well so no matter what place they suggested on our pub crawl I immediately responded, \"I'm in!\" One of my mates suggested Smugglers Cove (though he had never been). He had it bookmarked on yelp (shameless plug)! We circled for half an hour in search of expensive meter parking. Our fruitless, frustrating search ended in a dimly lit 10 dollar parking lot. \"You go to the corner,\" the man yelled at us, violently gesuring northward. It was 8:30. We looked at the car one last time, hoping all of it's windows would be in tact when we returned. It was a short walk to smugglers cove. We laughed and talked along the way, untill we saw ... The line. \"Are they giving away drinks inside,\" the only girl in our group asked sarcastically. The line moved slowly. Ahead of us were quiet, somber 30-somethings as far as the eye could see. We couldn't see the bouncer but every few minutes he could be heard commanding \"No cuts.\" When we reached the front of the line we were informed that the line would be moving more quickly soon because a party of 20 was about to leave. Unfortunately they were still inside when we finally made our way through the door. The bar consisted of three floors, each rather small. A staircase adorned with pirate paraphernalia led up and down from the ground level. Eenie, meenie, miney, moe. We took our chances with the bottom level. Much like the other two, it was wall to wall people. We forced our way through the crowd to the bar. Another line. Ahead of us, dozens of people vied for the attention of the two bartenders. We browsed the menu while waiting our turn. We used the pictures on yelp (wink wink) to help us make our selections. Hot buttered rum all around! Tonight we are pirates! Arrrrrrrgh!! While awaiting our drinks, we anxiously scanned the crowded room in search of a seat. Wonder of wonders, a spot with room for the four of us opened up just as our drinks were handed our way. We hurried across the room, ready to clothesline anyone who got in our way. We plopped down onto the cushioned edge of the lagoon, overjoyed at our good fortune. We all took sips from the warm mugs clutched in our greedy hands. Excellent! Warm, sweet, rich and buttery. A perfect drink for a cold night on the high seas. We chatted amongst ourselves until our cups were empty. A man quickly came and picked them up. Not wanting to brave the line at the bar again we decided to move on to the next stop of the night. Overall an intersting and tasty experience, but avast ye land lovers! This bar be crowded!",

I am not a fan of mixed drinks that you have to sip on for days since I do not like the taste of alcohol. However, these sweet drinks barely tasted like alcohol and I was sold that this is now my place. It is not like a midori sour where it is sweet but nothing really happens. I definitely felt the effects of the alchy but didnt have to scrunch up my nose every time I took a sip. I forget which drinks I tasted but I am sure that whatever you get, it will taste good. Drinks are over $12ish nish and I got this really sweet one with condensed milk haha. There is limited seating at the bar but I believe there is more seating upstairs.

My only disappointment is, altho completely unrealistic and I fully admit that, is the bartenders were not dressed up as pirates and speaking in old english. Now that would definitely have rounded out the whole pirate experience.  The drinks are expensive, but pirates are expected to do a bit of swindling on price. I wish I could remember the name of the drink, but the group I came with ordered something that came in a tiny barrel shape and was set to flames. Quite the spectacle. We all just stuck our straws into it after the flames died down and got drunk merrily.   Lastly when the place gets packed space is definitely a premium.

We stopped in for a night cap after a nice dinner in the Financial District. \u00a0We start out with a line outside. \u00a0Okay I get this... the place was wall to wall people. \u00a0I get it even more because the weather had just turned warm and it was a hotbox inside. \u00a0So I appreciate the effort. \u00a0Of note I think there is an 83% chance the door guy was Mac from Always Sunny. \u00a0I was looking for pyrotechnics on his coat when he gave me the ocular pat-down and after a few ninja moves we were in the door.  Let me preface by saying I HATE KITSCHY. \u00a0I love Irish bars and bemoan the send-away, build your own Irish Bar/TGI Fridays thing. \u00a0This is not that. \u00a0Yes there are things on the wall that shouldn't be there, there is a fountain with a colored light. \u00a0But for me, it works. \u00a0Its fun. \u00a0It's not Margaritaville and the bartenders don't wear eye-patches and call you matey. \u00a0It's a theme but that's it. \u00a0  What really sells it for me is that they easily have the best menu I've ever seen at a bar. \u00a0I love the new craft cocktail thing but hate that I now have to ask the bartender what \"rose petal infused water\" tastes like or what the difference is between \"citrus bitters and sour bitters\". \u00a0The menu here explains it all... like really well. \u00a0In fact so well I would like to see restaurants that have a period theme do the same. \u00a0I wanted to have a drink that had a historical thing to it-- BAM there's a section for that. \u00a0My wife wanted something sweet and fun-- BAM there's a section for that. \u00a0Some people might be annoyed with the breadth of their menu, but come on... at $10+ for a drink this makes me feel a little better about it. \u00a0  Also the drinks are STRONG!!! \u00a0I could do without the whole \"lighting things on fire\" jam but it is what it is. \u00a0We tried to circumvent that and get the drink in two glasses but alsa-- unless ye be a sittin, ye cannah hav tha drink. \u00a0  Okay it was really really hot. \u00a0Too hot. \u00a0We left after one drink and I may have trouble getting my wife back on a Friday or Saturday night. \u00a0I talked myself into thinking it was on purpose bc that's what a ship would be like. \u00a0Yo ho! \u00a0I will have to update when I am able to stop in a for a drink when it's less busy. \u00a0  Bottom line: \u00a0if you are into the whole craft cocktail thing, places like Alembic and 15 Romolo are awesome. \u00a0However I know a lot of people who don't like those places because they feel guilty about asking for a cosmo or a jack and coke. \u00a0Smugglers is the place you can go get snooty-toots about your drink while your friends and guzzle sweet liquor that's on fire!!! \u00a0Everyone's happy! \u00a0I see this as being the perfect place to come to just sip good rum straight but also to bring a bach/bach-ette party. \u00a0Pretty rare combo.

I think we arrived around 9:30 pm and it was already packed! It took us 1.5 hours to find a table downstairs because there isn't an efficient method to seating and people can sit for an unlimited amount of time. Even worse, the lineup to get drinks is so chaotic! There was only one bartender and the other man was in charge of just billing. Overall downstairs is a mess and on top of that it is stuffy, dark, and moist!   I enjoy the extensive menu of themed pirate drinks. All the drinks have fun names and descriptions and many are served in fun cups which I loved. I ended up getting the Hawaiian Sunset. It was pretty pricey for the amount you get, but it was sweet and delicious! I was in a group of four and we also shared the scorpion bowl. Surprisingly the four of us didn't feel anything after drinking it, but I would suggest giving it a shot just for the experience. Heads up though, to order a scorpion bowl you need a table first!  The surprise of my night here is actually pretty nasty! Apparently someone flooded the men's bathroom and it ended up leaking to the lower floor. It was SMELLY and the leak ended up taking over the whole ceiling causing everyone to leave! No one needs poopy bathroom water hitting their heads or getting in their drinks!!!! Nasty! Even worse is that I do not think the security guard warned the customers waiting in line. There was a line around the corner when we left. If I were them I would not want to step foot into a flooding bar.  The funny thing is that apparently Kanye West had also been at Smuggler's Cove earlier on in the night...I wonder how big a disaster that would have been if he had been there during the event.",

It was pretty neat to see how fast he worked and even though it took a few minutes to concoct I was thoroughly entertained by the scenery. \u00a0Not to mention the guest who came in dressed as Jack Sparrow himself.   I've also heard that you can start a card and if you fill out the entire card by buying/trying one of every drink on the menu you'll get your own gold plaque on the wall. \u00a0I only saw about 10 so far and I've only had one drink out of the hundred or so available. \u00a0It will be a goal.  Such a fun place to visit I will definitely be back.",

This place is two floors of pirate ship theme and more rum than you knew probably even existed! Drinks are pretty pricey, but they're pretty and themed and that's the kind of stuff I liked. We got one of the volcano drinks ($40!) to share. They give you a mini show by lighting the middle of your volcano on fire and then continue to give you ginormous straws so you and your friends don't have to break your backs trying to multitask holding a volcano and trying to drink at the same time. I like the novelty of it, but $40 was kind of pricey for essentially a bowl of ice with watered down juice (thought it did taste good - didn't taste like there was any rum in it though). I got another drink as well and on the flip side, it was super strong.   Overall though, I loved the theme, drinks were good for the most part, and I had a good night.",

The craftsmanship makes it worth the price.  I definitely recommend visiting Smuggler's Cove. \u00a0It's decor is amazing. The staff is friendly and extremely knowledgeable. \u00a0The drinks are made with care and precision.

The bartender will bring it out to you and light the coals on fire, which provides a nice little show while you enjoy your rather strong community bowl of libations. Just be careful not to melt your straw in the fire like I did....   Again, it is required you have a table or somewhere to set down your bowl of fire, or the bartender will refuse, understandably. It runs at about $36.   Purely because of the small size of the place, I would recommend you make this place your first stop of the night, and move on to other roomier bars in the city. It gets rather uncomfortable later on in the night even if you have a table, because the standing people will be constantly looking over at your party with their puppy dog eyes hoping that you'll get up and leave so they can enjoy a Scorpion Bowl themselves.

Tons of seating upstairs which is close to the main bar, you can also sit downstairs where again, they have another bar and a water feature that is kinda peaceful.   The drinks were awesome, started with the smugglers rum barrel, moved to the volcano and ended with an original Mai Tai (definitely my least favorite of the night).  Only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the bar tender in the basement. She was V RUDE and not welcoming at all. I won't complain about the length of time it took to get a drink because lets face it, a tiki drink is gonna take a while but her lack of any sort of enthusiasm to see another human being was a downer.",

Now lets talk about these bowls. Holy heck yeah batman, these things are so cool, delicious, and rumtacular its not even funny. I strongly suggest the volcano bowl, it is out of this world, and they light it on fire. Also beware, drink it with others it is deceivingly potent. The cove also features a cornucopia of \u00a0decadent cocktails, that are fantastic. The only \u00a0two negatives would be: 1) its too small, when this place gets crowded forget about it, its way too crazy. granted I'm a relaxed bar kinda guy. 2) the prices, still totally worth it, but still damn...

    "review_text": "\"Why is the rum always gone?\"   Captain Jack Sparrow will never ask this question once he steps foot inside Smuggler's Cove because they serve nothing but rum in all it's liquor prestige. Holding the pink slip for the most diverse selection of rum in San Francisco from 34 different countries (including Dominican Republic's Brugal), I think it's safe to say that this bar has solidified their reputation as the premier spot for rum lovers alike. \u00a0  From the outside, one could easily pass by without even knowing a bar existed behind the blacked out door, and you can't peak inside either since the windows have been painted black. This notion of shutting the world out due to its exclusivity is what gives Smuggler's Cove an illusion of secrecy - that you could be part of something illegal...  Upon entering, your vision will be feasting on the carefully thought out nautical choice of decor. Anchors, fisherman's nets, harpoons, shells, rum barrels, and not forgetting to mention the Hawaiian shirts that bartenders wear which add a very legit islander feel. Very welcoming, and arouses the anticipation of what their mean collection of liquor will do to you.   Their menu is quite helpful also, for example, if you want to try patron's favorites or would like to know which packs a strong hit, just look at the symbol next to the drink of choice. I went with the standard and picked their popular Smugglers Rum Barrel, (I promise to be a tad more adventurous next time), and I had a sip of my date's Navy Grog. Both drinks did not disappoint, and Smuggler's Cove did not disappoint.   A++++++++ Excellent rum, amazing bartenders, great atmosphere!  P.S.

For a guy who hates weddings, I spent a shameful amount of time on the subject. Let's not talk about it again.  Anyway, fast-forward to my first night as a resident of San Francisco. Smuggler's Cove transported me back to to when I associated partying with portholes.The aesthetic there is nautical without being fey, and the aroma of rum is potent in the air.   I ordered many drinks, some of them engulfed in flames. The drinks flow at a deliberate pace, but that's because the bartenders carefully measure their shots and there are some 6-10 ingredients per cocktail. But cool those jets hombre, because once you slide that rum-soaked goblet bedeckled with a paper umbrella mouthward all will be right in the world. A wonderful welcome to the west coast.  Obligatory Title Pun: Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of FUN.  Menu Readability: They have a very piratey menu.  Need to mention: I hate hate hate the name Smuggler's Cove.

But once you're inside, look to be charmed! The interior is a whole lot of fun, with terrific details and charming touches. It's tiny, but not so small that the place seems cramped, thanks to three discreet levels that allow for a lot of seating for the size and nice little nooks. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of sound muddling, so the small space can get noisy when it's at capacity.  Capacity can be an issue, since it is a small space, and the staff is really careful about not going over the fire marshall's recommended capacity. That's a good thing though, given the amount of decor!  None of those things are enough to dampen my enjoyment of the place. Especially when you consider the drinks!  If you enjoy an adult beverage that is made with the attention of a fine meal? Just check out the huge menu! It's a large book, which feels like a Chinese restaurant's menu and is filled with great drinks that anyone's palate can find a pleaser in. And for those that like to know the what and why of their drinks, each entry has a detailed entry to inform the curious.  As mentioned in some other reviews, the size of the space and the complex, gourmet-like mixing of the drinks make service occasionally slow, which means that this isn't a very good bar for going out and getting hammered, if that's your goal. And at the prices, there are better values for the purpose of getting a major drink on too. \u00a0This is a place for the mature appreciation of the drink and the society of your fellows. In summary, if you want to be a douche or get picked up on, better off going elsewhere.  Oh, and did I mention the faster way to get a drink? Shouldn't need saying, but at this rum bar, you can get served more quickly by ordering the rum!  And speaking of the rum... Like drinking? Like collecting? You absolutely need to look into the Rumbustion Society. Not only is it a guided tour through the complexities and differences in rum that serves as a tutorial for your palate to that wonderfully complex beverage, it's a great opportunity (once you've become an \"Initiate,\" to try some rare and unique rums. If you think you're going to visit more than once, you owe it to yourself to at least try out the first phase of 20 different one oz. pours.

I came here once before when it used to be Jade and I was impressed with the decor and all around feel of the place. Bartenders that night were on top of it.

    "review_text": "Oh my friends, what a find!  I heard about it before but didn't really know where it was. I found out when I actually was looking for a dry cleaner close to my new apartment; thanks to fellow Yelpers, I was told about this cleaner \"next to Smuggler's Cove\".  Oh, I thought, this is close to my place, great! Then I realized it replaced Jade Bar, which I liked very much, and sadness ensued. But I still wanted to give it a try.  Good thing I did! Yes, the pirate-themed decoration is not for everybody, but even though I'm sooooo much more Ninja than Pirate, I kinda like it. I also love rum, and they specialize in it... they have rum flights, which I have never seen before! The cocktail list is impressive (77 seven drinks!) and if you're into drinks, you will spend about an hour reading the Menu (yes, I called it a Menu) with all the ingredients, history of rum, funny quotes and all, like the girlfriend and I did. The bartender, Steven, is new there but very nice and professional.  I had a flight rum, their special Smuggler's Cove Barrel (comes in a little barrel you can take home!) and the deadly but delicious Puka Punch. The girlfriend also had a Mojito, which she didn't like, because they make it the traditional way: little sugar, little lime, more mint, more rum and less muddling. I liked it, but I am not a fan and here is my breakdown for the Mojito list:  - Taste: 2 stars. I like them sweeter, less minty. - Appearance: 4 stars. Very elegant. - Price: 3 stars. 9 bucks, fair. - Bartender's name: Steven. All the other drinks he made were excellent, so I bet he can make a kick ass Mojito if I ask for a sweeter one. - Overall: 3 stars and a half Mojito.   Just like Jade Bar was, the place is quite small and even on a Thursday at 8pm we had trouble finding seats; and some girl behind me kept elbowing me in the spine :(  I will definitely go back because 1), it's 2 blocks from my new place and 2) they have a card for the 77 drinks and you get a stamp for each one you try, and when they're all stamped.... well I don't know what happens, but I hope I get a map to the Dead Man's Chest (and that will determine the fate of the update to a fifth star :)",

The atmosphere in incredible, with nods to many of the great local tiki bars of the past. Notch and Martin have combined their visions into a wonderful temple of polypop and nautical fantasy. Love the waterfall. Meanwhile, the drinks are all we've come to expect from the country's most celebrated rummixologist.. The spices in the Smuggler's Rum Barrel are overwhelming -- ideal for me, but if that's not your taste be warned. The mai tai is excellent, an interesting variation, though closer to a \"classic\" or traditional mai tai than to Martin's former Island Mai Tai. My wife and I both loved the Euridyce rum, a distinctive, someone fiery tasting, rum specially made for the Cove by Alameda's own St. George's Distillery. A very good sipping rum. We only had the Special Reserve, the Cove's other exclusive rum, in a couple of mixed drinks, so we have to try it a few more times before we can comment usefully on it.",

However, the 100G+ remodel must have flipped a switch in my subconscious dating back to my days of eating mushrooms at Disney world.   The interior was slathered from top to bottom in pirate nostalgia that would take a 85 year old pack-rat with a Johnny Depp fetish half a lifetime of picking through Caribbean garage sales to accumulate. Fortunately for the new owners I think giant anchors and war tarnished scabbards have their own page on Ebay now.   Their Rum list was as lengthy as their drink menu was extravagant and I admit I was a bit overwhelmed by the options they had. Each drink was built well, and although I am not a fan of paying 14 dollars for a cocktail, the amount of good rum in each drink crept up on me from behind like a horny raider on a fair wench.   The staff were all extremely personable and friendly and I had an interesting chat with a Dom DeLuise stunt double while he checked libations from a list in an apparent attempt to sample the worlds finest Rums while his blood pressure soared higher than Jolly Roger during an attack on the Queen's vessel.   I can't see myself stopping in here for my routine ten drink happy hour on my income but this would definitely be a prime spot to bring a date that you wanted to impress. The copious amounts of rum in each drink may work in your favor as well if your lass is a bit of a lilly liver.   I am gonna quit before I make one more ridiculous pirate metaphor.",

I walked in thinking \"THIS is one of the Top 50 Bars in America?! Rigged.\" But gradually, I grew to like the place.   I appreciate how all the drinks on the menu are tied into the pirate theme. I chuckled at some of the drinks' names while some of my friends cringed at them. (Think about field workers - wont go into that too much.)   Ended up ordering the hot buttered rum. Worth trying, but not the whole drink! The alcoholic taste is not pungent, so recommend this to the friends that arent fond of the taste of alcohol. Just share with a friend since its very rich towards the end.  As for the atmosphere, I enjoyed how not everyone was a trendy hipster so I didnt feel underdressed or judged for coming in my work clothes. There was a wide variety of people which is very much appreciated. One group had a emo-grudge look going on and another group within my range sported a laid back hippie style. My point is that there was a wide variety of people and almost anyone could fit into this atmosphere. No pirate costumes spotted though :P",

Pain killers come in the 1oz, 2oz, 3oz, and for those extra strength days, 4oz varieties. With home made coconut cream instead of the normal bottled stuff. The decor is much tiki with a very intimate feel. I usually sit on the ground level, but there is also a bar downstairs, and additional seating upstairs. All my drinks have come out pretty fast and amazingly delicious.. So the only bad thing I can say is weekends get packed..   They have a couple giant party drinks, including volcanos, as well as two souvenir drinks: a tiki glass and a barrel one-- very cool keepsakes. If you are interested in the world of tiki and like the whole pokemon idea of collecting them all appeals to you, there is a cocktail card and a rum card. If you can hit 100+ rums, you get your name on a plaque on the wall.. I met one of the 500 guys last time I was there.. his friends weren't happy that I was encouraging him tho..  Go early.

If you see a little picture of a barrel next to a drink, know that if you have it, you're in for a special night because those are the strongest drinks.

They even have another bar down there and a freakin' waterfall. It essentially feels like you're inside a ship when you're there. You want to go now, don't you?  The drinks are all Tiki themed with rum being the main attraction. They're strong as hell and creep on you pretty late too -- or maybe because I had a big dinner beforehand? They are tasty too. Prices are more expensive than the norm but that's because you get your money's worth. I had one drink and I was good for the rest of the evening. The bartender we chatted with was very nice and outgoing and made some great recommendations for myself and the birthday girl. We saw a large group of people order a giant bowl drink with over 9,000 long straws coming out of it. There were flames. RADICAL.

First, the atmosphere inside is fantastic - the space has been utterly transformed into a piece of the Pirates of the Caribbean set; it's amazing, and really sets the mood for the amazing quantity of rum you're about to consume. \u00a0For yes, while they do make a few drinks without rum, let's be honest - that's not why you're here.  After waiting in line for about 15 minutes, I walked in the door to find Martin himself welcoming us in with a small sample of the house rum, which was delicious and a perfect way of warming to the occasion!  The cocktail menu is something like 8 pages long, with fun, detailed descriptions of each of the drinks. \u00a0They even have bingo sheets with all of the cocktails on them, so you can get them checked off. \u00a0Not sure if you win anything for filling your sheet, other than your own personal pickled liver, but it's an entertaining concept, which is continued with their Rumbustion Society - a 3-level checklist of every rum in the house, 200 some in all. \u00a0You start with a 20-rum punch card, then upon successfully passing the final exam (yes, really), graduate from that to a further sampling of 80 rums, and finally hence to an additional 100 rums. \u00a0Pass all of these tests, and you get to join Martin on a private distillery trip!  That's crazy. \u00a0Crazy awesome.  Anyway, back to the bar. \u00a0The cocktails are amazing. \u00a0Really. \u00a0All of them. \u00a0And flawlessly made. \u00a0Yes, this means that your drinks will take more than 10 seconds to make, and that you'll probably have to wait a bit at the bar. \u00a0Don't whine; art takes time, and it is most assuredly worth it! \u00a0Speaking of bars, there's the small one on the main floor, and a somewhat larger one downstairs, so when your beverage of choice starts to run low, you can choose the shorter line.  Oh, and just to counter one of the complainers, I too had the Chadburn (actually, it was the first thing I ordered) - rum, port, pear liqueur, and mole bitters. \u00a0This drink is just as unique, complex, and sophisticated as it sounds. \u00a0I thought it was fucking brilliant! \u00a0Yes, it's unusual, but that's why you're in a fancy cocktail bar, and not ordering rum &amp; coke's at some meat market. \u00a0Anyway, just had to give props to one of my favorite drinks of the night (and I had 4 myself, and sampled about 8 others).  Finally, one of the coolest things about tiki bars (or maybe it's just rum in general?) is that they just seem to make people happy. \u00a0Gin makes a man mean; Tequila makes ya crazy, but rum just makes everyone friendly. \u00a0I made a ton of friends while waiting for drinks with pretty much everyone around me.  Great bar. \u00a0Great feel. \u00a0Great drinks. \u00a0Hell yes, it's awesome.",

Add to the equation some brilliant cocktails and this place is all set to be a HUGE hit.   I was fortunate enough to be Heidi's date to the much anticipated and highly-coveted soft opening over the weekend. Let me tell you: Jade will not be missed with this jewel of a bar/tiki lounge taking it's place. If you are looking to get drunk, it's not hard. Pace yourselves, friends: these drinks, much like myself, are beautiful but lethal. Just when you think you've never enjoyed such exquisite and delicate beauty in all your life...BAM! You've been knocked over the head and kicked in the groin. In the best way possible, of course. These drinks are patiently hand-crafted with love and the artists behind the bars take great pride in their handiwork. As such, you will need to be patient. Treasures such as these require a little extra time. If an impatient brat like me can do it, so can you. Breathe. Take the opportunity to drink that much-needed water between drinks.   Particularly noteworthy are the Blonde Parisian (now named the Blonde Autumn), the Hulekale-something, and the adorable man at the door (ahem). I will be back. Oh boy will I be back. The only thing I'd change is my length of stay- this is more than a bar. It's a destination.  Might I add that that awful chlorine stench we all became immune to back in the days of Jade is now noticeably absent. Whew! No inhaler necessary.",

Looking from the outside, you would have no idea that this is a pirate-themed bar as there are no signs and the doors outside are blacked out.  Unfortunately, the execution left something to desire. While there are three levels to the bar, they are all really small. Coming here on a Saturday night, it got pretty crowded and it was difficult to move around. Not only that, but it was really stuffy in there. However, the cramped space may have been how pirate ships are, so I guess I can give them credit for being authentic. Drinks here cost anywhere from $8-$12 which is reasonable for San Francisco.  I can see myself liking this place a lot more if it wasn't so crowded.

The bouncer was friendly enough, no attitude, no hipster snobbery. \u00a0There's nothing I hate more than running across some two-year transplant who thinks he rules MY city just because he works at some trendy joint. \u00a0That was a major plus, just getting a smile at the door.

They most definitely stick to a theme in the decor. There are two bars, one on the ground floor and one on the lower level, as well as additional space upstairs on the mezzanine. Head to the downstairs bar (The Boathouse) and you actually feel like you're in the hull of a ship. They make over 70 different cocktails and have over 400 rums available in-house. For the non-rum-drinkers, there are other cocktails available as well. I enjoyed how they keep the music low and the total occupancy at just 49 people, giving it a more intimate feel and letting people enjoy their drinks and the atmosphere. I can see how on a Friday or Saturday night this place can get packed and the line for drinks can be long. I'll admit that I wasn't sure what to think of Smuggler's Cove based on reading its reviews, but once I got there I was pleasantly surprised.

Maybe 6 around the bar waiting on drinks? People were leaving the whole time the guy was waiting too. Bouncer should figure it out",

This bar is definitely unique and there are not many alike! This bar offers 3 floors of pure pirate and open seas decor and their extravagant drink menu is a journey into the abyss itself!   The atmosphere was more chill than normal bars and the drinks were definitely interesting, albeit a bit overpriced. The drinks come in a large skull cup to share with a party of 3-4, or more if you want (See my posted picture). They also light the drink on fire so that added a nice touch. Although we did have to wait about 20 minutes to get in so the bar is a bit small. Overall, their selection in drinks is worth exploring and if you've never been here, you should at least check it out with your friends once!   Pros: -Nice theme and decor. -Chill atmosphere. -Huge selection of unique drinks.  Cons: -Over priced. -Limited space. -Hard to find, no signs on the outside.   Though, while inside, it does make you want to sail the 7 seas and find your pirate's booty! Haha  You know what they say, \"Time flies when you're having rum!\"",

There's water trickling down a wall and cool seaside decor everywhere. 2 bars, 3 \"floors\" (one is an additional seating area that overlooks the main floor), and just enough space to snuggly move about.   Extensive drink menu! It took us a while to go through the whole thing. There seems to be only one drink good for a group (4 people) and that was the Volcano. But since we were just getting individual drinks, I decided on the-  HIBISCUS RUM PUNCH ($9) Was quite weak. It tasted mostly like hibiscus iced tea. Kinda tart, kinda watered down. But it did come with this edible hibiscus flower and THAT was delicious. First time I ate a flower and it was ah-may-zing. Gotta hit up a Trader Joe's or Whole Foods to find me some hibiscus!   P.S.

I had the AKU AKU which was fruity and the liquor was not overpowering.

It's more of an experience than anything else, and once you do enter in from the nondescript entrance the outside hustle and bustle immediate melts away.   The ambiance is very \"Pirates of the Caribbean (but in a tongue in cheek, classy way).\" There are 3 floors to the bar, but their tiny and it still maintains a small and comfortably vibe. The decorations are unique, nautical, and you could tell that huge attention was put towards the details (the blowfish lamps are awesome!). Something that you need to experience for yourself.  The menu is extensive (77 carefully crafted drinks in all, plus 200 handpicked rums); and for the first timer a little intimidating. Although the staff is wonderful, really living proof to the term \"bartender.\" Not just hastily throwing together a drink, but rather crafting each drink like putting together an ornate puzzle. They take their time, but in a good way, you can tell that the bartenders love their job and are passionate about what they do. And even if you don't know exactly what you want, they're there to steer you in the right direction (and I promise you that you can't go wrong with anything on that menu).   Favorite Drinks: Puka Punch, Calibogus, and of course the HOT BUTTERED RUM.  Smugglers Cove is by far my favorite bar in San Francisco (and it's perhaps the best rum bar you'll find in the US).

Additionally, they don't just have many concoction options, they have many different top shelf rums, whiskeys, gins et. al.   I will say the $10 and 10 minute wait for my drinks were worth it. Very worth it.",

Well this place did it and it was no surprise that the same creator of my East Bay love was also the creator of Smugglers Cover. But even if SC may be the younger of the two, don't let that fool you. They have an impressive rum list \u00a0and an even more impressive one that you can't even see until had enough of their beginner list (there is a fancier name for is but forgive me I was two cocktail deep when the bartender filled me in). The cocktail menu ranges from traditional to contemporary, offering something for everyone's taste, as well as torrence level. If you choose to booze it up on a Saturday I suggest arriving a little early, lets say before 10, this place gets packed. It's hard to get bored or impatient waiting for a drink when there is so much to look at but if you don't want to wait ten minutes show up before the rush. One thing that stood out on the menu \u00a0was that they had a cocktail with Akvavit, a Danish spirit. \u00a0I'm \u00a0partially Scandinavian so I had to give it a go. It was actually really good. Not really tiki but good just the same :)",

It almost seems like some kind of secret location, because it is so, SO easy to walk right by the front door without even knowing it's there, unless you come on a weekend, during which the line is known to snake around the block. Most of my friends and I are lucky (?) to be weekend workers, so we get to go to places like this on weekdays, which is definitely the best time to go.   The menu has chapters, where you can choose from all kinds of drinks, from old and classic, to new and trendy. They have a great rum selection, and apparently they make all of their fruit juices in house, so no fakey - tasting mixers here! No \u00a0My friend and I have gotten to try a good number of their cocktails, some of my personal favorites being the painkiller, and the Demerara Dry Float. They also have the tastiest Zombie that I've had anywhere.   The bartenders here are super friendly, and always down to make conversation and recommendations based on what you like, and when it gets busy, they can be personable and deal a lot of customers hella efficiently at the same time.  The atmosphere is without a doubt one of the biggest draws here, and rightfully so. As I said before, when there is no line outside, you can't even tell it's there. As soon as step inside through the blacked - out glass doors, you're instantly transported into not just the tropics, but the pirate - y tropics. The amount of pirate - ness of Smuggler's Cove is what sets it apart from all the other tropical bars I've been to, taking it to an almost \"theme park\" level of playfulness. The upstairs area (where you walk in) has its own bar, but there isn't really a lot of seating. The downstairs area is where you want to be. It looks like a cave, with a small waterfall under the stairs, and is very cozy and intimate. This place is great.",

There was no music to be found. It might've fallen victim to Davy Jones' Locker. Forreal, maybe if it was 80's or 90's themed, then at least there'd be some excuse to play music. But pirates? No way Cap. Doesn't float my boat.  Although there are 3 levels, it was a hassle getting around. Despite the growing fear of claustrophobia, each floor is pretty tight and difficult to navigate. Imagine, 50+ people in a tight knit space, no ventilation, just straight body fumes. (YIKES).  Waiting for your drink kinda reminded me of waiting at the DMV. Even then, I wasn't satisfied with my order. I probably made the poor choice there.   I get the theme and it might work for some folks. It just doesn't work for me.

On a recent Monday evening, I was asked to grab a drink and see if there was a chemistry for many more future drinks. Apparently the later didn't happen, but in the journey, I did discover a rad new cocktail lounge.  Smuggler's Cove has taken over the old Jade Bar and made many fantastic improvements. The most appreciated being removing the \"coke-den\" lighting and eliminating the scent of \"oh-crap-someone-barfed-in-the-fountain-again\". I guess you could say, they made it a little more refined...perhaps it's the huge increase in drink prices that did it...hence the minus one star.  As usual, I digress....this bar is rad. The menu is not only extensive, but is written in order of region of origin and chronilogical significance. So not only do you get a sweet buzz on, but a history lesson while you're at it!   We scored a spot right at the bar downstairs which made me happy because I could watch each of the handcrafted art pieces being made one by one. That''s right, each drink is hand made...no pre-made batches here and no bottled mixers. Everything is hand squeezed, crushed, muddled, twisted, stirred and shaken. This means waiting a little bit longer than usual, but you won't be disapointed. I ended up ordering their authentic mai-tai and another rum beverage called \"the Millionaire.\" They both came beautifully garnished and carefully crafted by the highly experienced mixologists behind the bar. When I inquired from the bar back \"How did you apply for this job?\" All he could tell me was \"You don't apply for a job here, you are chosen.\" And I see why...  The atmosphere is amazing, the drinks delicious and creative (I actually ate a candied hybiscus flower!), the staff friendly and knowledgeable and the crowd is grown and sexy.  So maybe the date didn't work out, but I intend on returning with good friends to share the wealth of my new find. Do yourself a favor and try it out soon.",

The exterior doesn't really suggest much and the actual bar resembles something closer to One-Eyed Willie's pirate ship (Goonies reference). There's a small upstairs room with a tropical theme and a downstairs that I didn't even make it to. The rum drinks are as pricey as you would expect but well made and strong.

Stepping inside, you find the decor is pretty awesome. 3 floors of straight up island/pirate/Caribbean style (bars on the main floor and in the basement). A caveat to the wise, the fountain downstairs is probably quite dangerous to be near if you've had too much to drink....  You should probably ask for the menu since the selection is extensive. Drinks can be a bit more expensive than the average cocktail but that's only because they're very elaborate and often quite large.  Can be crowded and loud so keep that in mind but otherwise a good spot for a tasty drink!",

Feels like the pirate's lair inside a wooden shipwreck. definitely a great place to set sail into rum-runner bliss.  For those who do not appreciate the burnt-sugary complexities of exotic rum based cocktails, there are plenty other inventive libations that employ any kind of poison your choosing. Bring an eye patch and a bag of doubloons because this voyage is not cheap. \u00a0Our punch bowl for 4 which in my opinion is really better suited for 2 people was about $32.

My maties and I were definitely sobering up by the time our drinks came.   We were lucky enough to snag a table at the top of the \"ship\". Yes, this bar is designed in the shape of a pirate ship. The 10 page menu of Tiki inspired drinks was over whelming especially when 30 people are trying to get up in ya, to order before you and all drinks were expensive (sheesh $15 is STEEP for a libation). From what my eyes could see all drinks were \"sugary\" in the sense that they were filled with fruit juices and lots of rum. I couldn't even finish my crazy concoction for the fear of onset diabetes.  Regardless, this hidden speakeasy is definitely a super cool and unique spot; definitely a conversation starter. And, I'd imagine on a Tuesday night, if no one is here and you're not waiting forever to get in and for drinks, this would definitely be a great stop by for a cocktail.

It's small, so there is limited seating when it gets crowded, but the drinks are definitely worth it.  I came here at around 8:30 pm on a Saturday. There was a line out the door, and we ended up waiting for about 30 minutes outside until they let us in - but once we got in, the experience was so worth it. It didn't take long to get a drink and because I'm a rum-lover, all the drinks sounded pretty damn good. I got 2 drinks (&amp; btw I love how they point out which drinks are \"strong\") and the first one I had was some sort of punch, it was very good. The second drink wasn't as good, but still okay. Both were strong and both got the job done.  Though the drinks run about $13-15 on average each, the atmosphere and decor of the place is so worth it. I would definitely return, maybe earlier in the night to beat the crowd, but I'd love to see the fire show and sip on some rum goodness again!  I also liked the upstairs bartenders (there are 3 floors, 2 floors with bars) a lot more than the downstairs lady bartender - she didn't seem to like being there too much.",

It was happy hour and the drinks were cheaper. Ordered a Mai Tai that rivaled Tahiti Nui in Kauai. It was deeeeeeeelicious but had way too much ice. The bartender certainly knew what he was doing but had zero personality. As bland as a pet rock. We were sitting at the bar (downstairs) which is a way I like to assess a new bar and get a feeling for the place. This bartender did nothing to make me \"happy\". Barely acknowledged by existence and I was put off.   Biggest problem as I see it: NO FOOD. I mean not even a bowl of frikkin' nuts. Come on!!! When a drink can cost $13 shouldn't you at least have a macadamia to chew on. \u00a0Well shouldn't you? The website states that they have a Type 48 ABC liquor license which does not allow them to serve food, but they LIE. It actually is (as follows) that they do not have to serve food. Big difference. Show me the nuts!!!!  48 ON SALE GENERAL - PUBLIC PREMISES - (Bar, Night Club) Authorizes the sale of beer, wine and distilled spirits for consumption on the premises where sold.

Granted, when it comes to theme bars there's a fine line between cheese and cool, but I give props to Smuggler's Cove and Rickhouse for putting in some damn effort and doing something different- and they do pull it off sans too much fromage.  I'm not a fan of: This new trend of novel-sized drink menus full of labor-intensive drinks with 5,000 ingredients that take as long to make (and are as expensive as) a good meal at a restaurant. Yeah, yeah, \"quality over quantity\" and all that crap- I like a good drink as much as the next guy- \u00a0but we're talkin bout DRINKS and this is a BAR....not a 5-course French restaurant. Other reviews are right...it takes foooorrreeever and a day to get a drink here. It doesn't help that the bartenders are forced to use jiggers for every pour, and that the menu is so voluminous, and that every drink is more labor-intensive than a mojito....but besides all that the 'tenders are still slow..everyone likes a bartender with \"personality,\" but when 12 people are waiting for their drinks, cut the chit-chat and pump 'em out dammit.   Plus 1 star for the chill, non power-trippin bouncer. Whatever they're paying him he deserves a raise. The owners are either completely paranoid about the fire code or they get off on having a line outside...either way there always seems to be a line outside of bitching patrons- even when it's not that crowded inside (Jade packed 'em in more)- and the bouncer handles this annoying mess with a good sense of humor and patience...a true rarity in the city.  Minus 1 star for charging $10 for a Jameson. I know, I know, it's a rum bar, but that's still disgusting.",

Now the fun parts, what's all this crap about strong great drinks? The bartender was using a shot glass to measure pours, sure if you order a $14-16 dollar drink with 2 or 3 shots it's strong...wtf ? You wait way too long and the bartenders act like they're doing you a favor. Also I get it about the bouncer, if he's the guy with the bun of hair on the back of his head he'd better be a MMA fighter because he looked like he couldn't handle my 13 year old son. I guess he doesn't have to because the clientele is 20 something hipsters dressed in jeans and Gap attire. \u00a0The pirate motif is fun for a second then it's a bore and I'm not really an umbrella drink kinda guy.

This bar is both tiny and 3 levels, but I exclusively sit on the lower level, which is where this place really shines. \u00a0Head down the flight of metal stairs as you enter, next to the (admittedly cheesy) waterfall and you end up in a little room, with enough seating for 5 moderately sized parties plus seating for 5-6 more at the bar. \u00a0The decor is some combination of carribean/nautical/pirates. \u00a0The seating is comfortable and consists of padded benches and a few movable chairs around low crate-like tables.  The bartender (whose name I never remember even though he always seems to remember which rums I've been served in previous trips) makes fantastic mixed drinks and also does recommendations on shots of rum if you so-desire. \u00a0As for the mixed drinks, all are meticulously crafted and well worth the price (about $10 or so per drink). \u00a0If its not too crowded and you're feeling adventurous, he's also not opposed to creating a new drink for you on the fly. \u00a0We requested a special drink with compari and got the most interesting cocktail I have ever tried (very complex flavors but not overpowering).  What brings me back to this bar, however is the collection of approximately 200 bottles of rum from all over the world. \u00a0When I first went here, I just asked for a recommendation and ended up with 3 really fantastic shots to try. \u00a0Even when this place is at capacity he will still take a moment to listen to what kind of rum I'm looking for and then describe the characteristics of what he has poured me.   I can't say enough nice things about this place -- anyone who wants a fantastic cocktail or wants to learn a little more about rum owes it to themselves to spend an evening here.",

Not the case at Smuggler's Cove. As for the title, I guess if you're a smuggler you would want your cove well hidden. This bar follows suit. Within the walls and design look like something out of Disneyland. Outside it's just any old nondescript store front in San Francisco.  I suppose the rum and coke is an option here, but it's really not where your focus should be. This is a tiki-bar of the highest caliber where awesome cocktail creations will run you between $9-15+ dollars. Yes, that's out of a lot of folks price ranges. Keep your budget in mind before you walk in because the tastes will lure you into more and more orders and pretty soon you'll be in pretty deep, both in alcohol and greenbacks.  They offer one of those big bowls but I don't think it's worth the price tag. Outside of that I tried the Fogcutter, a drink I've been reading about recently in its original form. Smuggler's Cove makes theirs up as kind of a hybrid but they stay true with the mix to what that drink was meant to be. Some of the other drinks I tried were awesome as well, though I don't remember the names. All in all, I don't think you can go wrong with pretty much anything in here. Check it out.

Sworn at by bouncer shortly after we asked why he was letting others in before us even tho we were waiting in line for 40mins. Bartender took forever and a day to get to us.. HUUGE jerk who has a god complex while wearing an orange Hawaiian shirt. \u00a0Seriously buddy? Check your ego.. You're not Kanye! It was so obvious that he avoided taking our drink orders for as long as he could. \u00a0The bar back was rude and randomly swore at us and again under his breath. \u00a0We kept getting dirty looks from everyone working there too. \u00a0 \u00a0  Whole place is gimmicky and you pay extra for rudeness and a pink umbrella in your drink. Save your hard earned money and take it to another bar that actually EARNS your patronage and not expects it like this place.",

    "review_text": "Went on Friday @ 7 and had to wait in line. Not really that big of a deal, and understandable considering they're new. Justin - the fellow outside, is very nice and accomodating for the people who have to wait in line. He gave us a menu, which was very helpful in being able to know what we wanted as soon as we got in. We joked and chatted, and he made the wait bearable. I'd rather wait (and subsequently have others wait) than to be in an over crowded bar with no room to walk, breathe, and talk. Because of this, there was a chair open at the bar downstairs where I sat while the fiance stood, and we got to really get a feel for the place.   The drinks- knock you on your backside strong. For our first round I ordered the Puka Punch, and the boy ordered a J. something rather. We got punch cards to start marking off the drinks we've had getting us that much closer to getting our names on Smugglers Cove manifest. The boy also started his punch card for the Rumbustion society. I like places that award you for trying new things. Especially when those new things involve booze.   Prices: Decent. About $8 and up. For 3 strong, delicious drinks, one rum straight, and one backyard rum flight (3 different types of rum) our total came to $51. Honestly not too bad.  Bartenders: friendly and focused. She was very busy behind the bar but still chatted with us while still being productive. A pet peeve of mine is when you're waiting for a drink and bartender is chatty and stops making drinks to talk. The other bartender (or barback- not totally sure) was also really cool.   Ambiance: the place itself is neat. Definitely, a lot went into it. Borderline disney-esque, but it's a tiki bar so it's an acceptable amount of kitsch, and it's really well done. Plus, I like Disneyland, so F off. We didn't really look around since it was kinda crowded, so I can't say how the upstairs is really.  I'm waiting to go back with a group and see how they do, for that last star.   But definitely check it out, and if there's a wait be thankful for it. It means in the case of a fire, your chances of making it out alive and not trampled are greatly increased. Plus you get time to peruse the menu and feel like a regular when you saddle up to the bar and already know what you want. ;)",

    "review_text": "Sigh. I hate to leave this review with only 2 stars, as I did love the drinks and the atmosphere. BUT....  The door guy is a complete douche. And so are some of the cry-baby patrons.  My friend celebrated her 30th birthday recently, and decided she would like to make this our first stop of the night. We arrived promptly at 5pm to try and secure some space for our group - we were expecting around 20 people. We were told that we would note be able to save seats and/or space for people that were on their way. Fair enough - totally understandable! It's a small place. No issue there.   We parked ourselves upstairs, starting out with a small circle of chairs for those of us who were already there. We were sharing the upstairs with two other smaller groups of people. Over the course of the next few hours, the two smaller groups finished their drinks and exited. As our group increased in size, it worked out perfectly - we were able to snag their chairs to allow for the growth of our gang. \u00a0When the last of us arrived, we actually still had more people than chairs available, but we made due. All was well.   People would wander up the stairs, see that it was a full house, and wander back down to look for space elsewhere. No one seemed bothered. UNTIL...this woman and her man come upstairs. She saw one unoccupied space on a bench seat, and made a bee-line for it. We let her know, \"sorry, that seat is taken - she is just down at the bar getting a drink.\" The woman said nothing, and went downstairs.   Shortly after, the door douche comes upstairs. He proceeds to tell us: \"If I have to hear from ONE MORE person that you are turning people away and telling them this is a private party, you will be asked to leave. If someone comes up here, you'd best welcome them with open arms and make them feel comfortable.\"   Uhm, EXCUSE ME?? Oh uh-uh. Where the hell are people supposed to sit, genius? On my friggin LAP? On the floor in the middle of the room? No. Chairs. Left. \u00a0And no one ever called it a \"private party.\" We called it FULL. No place to sit. None. Zip. Zilch.  Every single person in our group purchased multiple...no, NUMEROUS drinks! And at $11-$15 per drink, he should be thanking us for bringing such a large group in, not scolding us for not 'welcoming people' into our group. When some of us objected and tried to plead our case, he rolled his eyes, repeated his words, actually threw up a \"talk to the hand\" hand, and left.   We also left. And took our money with us. I'd rather spend $15 on a drink elsewhere, where my patronage is actually appreciated.   It's too bad. That Puka Punch was damn good. Not quite $14 good, but still good enough that I would have come back for another.",

Their drinks are fantastic and the decor is excellent and their bartenders are of that super booze-geekery variety. You can have a 3 hour conversation with them about bitters; I know people who have done that very thing. Hell, I wasn't part of that conversation and *I* got excited about bitters.  If you've never been, you should go at least once. If you've been before, don't go again, because then it's just harder for ME to find a place to sit when I go.",

We were able to go in right away, and though it was pretty much at capacity, people came and went so we were able to get seats at the main floor bar pretty easily. Good place for small groups (6 people max) if you get in at a not-too-busy time.  This is a rum bar. If you like rum, you will be happy. If you do not like rum, there are a few alternate choices, but I definitely love the rum, so I stuck with the house specialty. The menu is enjoyable and gives you quite a bit of information about what you're about to drink. It's fun to peruse even once you've chosen your drink.  The bartender was SUPERB and amazing to watch. The drinks came out with beautiful presentation in addition to tasting wonderful. My friend had a rum barrel to start off with, and i had the hot buttered rum, which was so delicious words fail me. If you have ever had a hot buttered rum before... this will surpass that experience by so much that you will never want to leave. Deliciousness! Some Tiki friends at the bar thought it was pretty sweet though, so if you aren't a fan of brown sugar in your warm rum... maybe this drink isn't for you. My friend enjoyed her rum barrel, which was a mix of multiple rums and juices. Sweet with a bit of bitter to it. Next round was a Perdido Mundo, which was nicely apple-flavored, and Dead Reckoning. Last round was Painkiller and another Buttered Rum for me. The Painkiller was a really interesting combination of sweet, creamy, and rum. Will probably order one for myself next time.  We sipped our drinks and talked, enjoying the ambiance and the company of Tiki enthusiasts at the bar. The bartender kept a good eye on us while also serving the decent number of people rotating into the bar or seated upstairs. He even made sure our seats didn't get overrun when we were talking with other people. Got to meet the owner of the bar, who was a real sweet and knowledgeable guy. Very accommodating and entertaining, bringing paper copies of the menu for some out-of-towners to take home and posing in pictures with various rums used in their drinks.  A wonderful, rum-filled experience. Strong but well-mixed and tasty drinks, a neat atmosphere, and good people. A well deserved 5 stars.",

We booked a hotel in Japantown and were able to walk to SC for our first visit on Dec 21st - Martin did not disappoint. The layout is great - tiki-poly/nautical/pirate all in one. The drink variety is fantastic with old school &amp; modern tiki, old cubans and historical gems.  The bar-huggers were regulars and were very welcoming. There was a \"hipster-choad\" factor scattered throughout the upstairs/downstairs...but guess that's to be expected with the \"all-the-rage\" places. Difference is, I think SC has a great timelessness to it that when this crowd fades on to the next big thing, the bar will live on just fine. In my eyes, Tiki-Ti (in LA) is the end-all-be-all of my tiki/poly/pirate-oriented preference, Bourbon &amp; Branch is my utimate in old-school mixology talent - Smuggler's Cove seems to hit somewhere in between in drinks.

Sorry, silicon chin resters don't count.   But yah, if you're looking for eyecandy, it's highly unlikely you'll find it here. The crowd kind of reminded me of Tonga Room on a Saturday night. Line included... BEFORE opening. Even though there's 3 levels with 2 bars, the pirates themed, tiki bar space is cramped and gets crowded fast. If you want seats, I highly recommend coming right when they open at 5 pm.   With numerous accolades including being named one the \"World's 50 Best Bars\" by the prestigious Drinks International, it's ALL about the dranky dranks at Smuggler's Cove. They make all their mixes in-house and all the juices are freshly squeezed. None of that cheap sh*t that Tiki Haven, Trad'r Sam's and/or Tonga Room uses.   The drink menu is overwhelmingly extensive; there are over 400 rums and over 70 cocktails on the menu (cocktails start at $8). Horrible for indecisive folks like myself. So what to do? Please don't be that douche holding up the line asking 21 questions. Tell the bartender exactly what kind of spirit and flavor(s) you like, and they'll whip up something fantastic for you.   I like strong, coconutty, but not too sweet. The bartender suggested the Painkiller (rum, pineapple, oj, and coconut cream). It's was a Friday night and it's been THAT kinda week so when he asked, 2, 3, or 4 oz of rum, I said without hesitation, \"4 OZ PLEASE!\" He gave me that \"slow ya roll, girl\" look and suggested I start with 3 oz. Fine, a triple is just fine with me. The bartender asked what else I wanted. I asked him to make a good pineapple mocktail for Mr. NSS. Not only did he make a good one but he made a pretty b*tch one, complete with a girly orchid for him: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1CweMil&amp;s=074f516c469b54424720d31bc751e2faa71f27e5d99fae481f358c361cbf87bb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1CweMil</a>.   The Painkiller was exactly what I asked for...strong, coconutty, but not too sweet. One of my gf's had the Batida, a passion fruit cocktail with condensed milk. It was like taking a sip of the tropics, it was absolutely delicious.   If you're with a large group, try one of their Scorpion bowls. My other friends shared one and dayam it was strong.

Chatting with the bartender - Well educated (liquorwise) man, wearing a scally cap and talked spirits, and the fun things you could do with them. \u00a0Pleasant guy, discussed some of the [legendary] places I've drank at. \u00a0Good times were had - Until I asked him to make a drink that a friend developed. \u00a0He decided that, there was no good reason to shake a part of the drink, because it was going to be strained into the glass anyway, that that would be unnecessary \u00a0and didn't do it - While it did not completely destroy the drink, it made it lesser than it should have been. \u00a0I feel like he was being lazy (I read the recipe right off my phone, as I got it via text) and made me feel like this bar disrespected me. \u00a0Hence the 2 star rating.  I'm pretty upset about the way the night ended...",

The crowd is also usually pretty fun - a lot of people go here for birthdays or other celebrations.   The only negative is the limited seating (btw, you can only get the Scorpion Bowl if you are seated at a table), however, the fact that it's a smaller place is part of its charm. You will also probably have to wait in line if you go on a weekend, but I've never had to wait for that long (worth it). The drinks are a bit more expensive than the standard SF bar (about $10 each), but since the drinks are creative and unique, I would say the price is on point.   Also, I have never seen so much rum in one place. If you're a rum lover, you will absolutely love Smuggler's Cove.",

We got off at Powell BART and walked around to kill time before midnight and then we walked all the way over to the bar from there. It was a quick walk but the bar is also close to Civic Center BART.   You have to wait in line to get in but it wasn't too bad for a Friday night. (My birthday was on a Saturday! How convenient). They let us in at 12:01! The timing couldn't have been more perfect. The bouncer was all confused since he was checking 4/29 all night and my birthday was 4/30. He wished me a happy birthday and we went in and someone told us our best bet to get a drink was to go downstairs.   The place was PACKED and extremely hot. It took a while to get a drink but it was perfect because you can't order the Volcano Bowl ($36) unless you have a table and we totally lucked out and got one!   I busted out my camera to take a video of the drink arriving and getting set on fire but little did I know, I was about to record the bartender getting the entire bar to sing me happy birthday! It was amazing!   The drink was STRONGGG but the three of us was easily able to polish it off. The table next to us got the same drink and was splitting it between 10 people!  I would definitely come back again. I didn't get a chance to check out all the awesome decor. This place is totally inconspicuous. You could easily walk right by it but if you spot the green and red light out front, you've made it.",

You could have called me Rob Bass, cause I come to get down. Instantly you know the place is happening, for better or worse. There's and indoor waterfall, pool (not people pool, just pool of water), pirate crap, and the whole nine. It's got the vibe, it's so cool.  Usually, when I go out, I get beer. It's not that I particularly favor beer, but it's usually something a bartender can't f*ck up. As a person that used to bartend myself, and considers himself a connoisseur of fine libations, I consider the bartenders in San Francisco some of the WORST!   F*uck off if you disagree, just go ask for a cocktail. I guarantee you won't be talking that mess after you're subjected to their bartending prowess. I'd say most bartenders in SF have about five drinks in their repertoire, and one of them is a draft beer.  P.S. just because a drink is strong, doesn't mean it's good. Mixing drinks is lot like cooking; some people consider it the same thing. If you like cake, you wouldn't dump a whole bag of sugar in it cause you liked sugar, would you? Then why would a bartender do that with a drink?   Ahoy, I spot the bartender and start looking over their drink menu. Now, this place specializes in rum drinks, and I love me some rum! It actually was a bit too much for my senses, but I settled on something, and was quite pleased with what I got. I should say I was more then pleased. Some of the best drinks I've had, most definitely in SF.  Their drinks cost a bit more than other places, but in their defense, the drink are delicious, strong, and huge...a bit like myself...ah ha :) Seriously, they're good. Take special note of drinks that have a small icon of a barrel by their name, it mean's they're filled with extra love (by love I mean alcohol). \u00a0  Technically there are three floors, but the lay of the land is a bit odd. With all that space, the place feels smaller than it should. I don't think it's anything a good interior designer couldn't fix, but this a small complaint that doesn't detract from the awesome experience I had.   Hot girls Arrr, I'd plunder their booty any day. The weird seating makes it easier to get closer to them; you almost have no choice. I could think of worse things than being smushed between hot women.  You bet your arse I'm going back to this place.",

The drink menu is enormous and each drink has a lengthy description plus some history. It's fun to peruse as long as you have personal space and some extra lighting.   The bartenders are really into their craft. In addition to making good drinks, there is a fair bit of show: flourished mint slapping, orange peel swirling, pineapple leaf plucking and the strategic placing of paper umbrellas. I never knew a paper umbrella could be opened so deftly. This also means drink orders take awhile...  For those who like fruity drinks - this is the place for you. Don't like the taste of alcohol?

One guy taking orders, and One bartender busting out handcrafted concoctions faster than the speed of light.

Upstairs there are cushioned seats and a few tables and chairs. The view is great.   We mostly sat at the bar area and had a few strong fruity cocktails. I forgot what I had, but one of the drinks was a pina colada and one had passion fruit in it. The prices weren't bad at around $10.00 for a large drink. The bartender is cool and friendly. He helped me decide on a drink. Maureen wanted to try the Scorpion bowl at one point which was HUGE! It comes in a skull bowl and cost $35.00 I think. For some reason she changed her mind. That would've been great to try, lol!   After a couple of drinks we sat upstairs and another yelp buddy of mine, Tom R. joined us with a friend of his. He's really cool and friendly. He liked the place to and he's been to lots of bars so that says something. So if you like anything pirate or tropical themed, you'll love this little place!

Since it was my first visit, I'll write down my impressions.  To start, the location is great. Even with its high profile, it's not exactly in the center of the city; I'm sure that helped keep the crowd lighter than it could be. \u00a0The atmosphere is first-rate: very dark with flowing water and nautical/piracy/tiki accents; having never been there or, really, having seen all many pictures, it looked almost exactly how I imagined it.  It took me a long time to select my drinks. Each selection meant sacrificing the opportunity to try something that sounded equally intriguing. \u00a0With a bar of this caliber I approached my cocktails as I would a meal. \u00a0I went with a special whose name I've since forgotten -- a lighter drink, finished with club soda -- as an appetizer and then a more traditional selection, a Daquiri #3 for my main course, playing to my fondness for the savory grapefruit and Hemmingways. \u00a0 I drank slowly. \u00a0Both cocktails exceeded the fine reputation of the bar, with fresh fruit juices and secondary liquors blending lightly with the primary rum to the degree neither seemed dominated by the spirit, they only bring out elements you rarely notice. \u00a0 As the Boathouse began to fill I left, fully satisfied with my experience.  A legend, and deservedly so. I doubt I'll ever visit the City without returning here.",

It's walking distance from my night job, so why not?  Smuggler's Cove is great. You walk up to the door and don't realize it's a bar until you see little letters on the plain-faced door that reads the name of the bar. I go there and the bouncer Charles already knows me by name and recognizes me when I come in, he's super awesome and informative (informative as in he'll ask around for the owner of the car parked across the street and tell them to move it or they'll get towed. Good looking out!). The atmosphere is crazy awesome. The place is a pirate ship: Blowfish lights, the maiden of the ship on the wall, the anchor on the celing, might as well call this place Shenanigans!  The drinks I've had there are wonderful so far. I'm not a big fan of rum, unfortunately, so I'm trying to break myself in by ordering what I know (anything gin-based) and sneaking sips of my friends' drinks and deciding for myself what I'd like to eventually try.  They have a list there that you can fill out of all their drinks on the menu, including drinks that you need multiple people to drink it with, and when you're done filling out the list, you're eligible for various prizes! What a cool incentive to drink your ass off!  I wish I had more thumbs to up with for this place. I'm making it a regular part of my week. SC rocks!",

Maybe it's a little gimmicky, but tiki bars are pretty unique to the Bay Area and chances are that an out-of-towner has never been to one. The drinks aren't exactly the strongest, but it's definitely a fun place to be drinking in. The upstairs has the best view of all the pretty lights and decked out ceiling. The ground level is pretty much regulars. The den is equipped with another full bar and the most spacious. I advise going early or going late if you care about seating. Otherwise, this place can get pretty crowded. I'm not sure if I'd come with a group larger than 6 or 8. Another nice touch I like is that this place is unmarked, other than a beacon of light out front. It's kind of like walking into a tiki speakeasy. Hawaiian shirts are advisable. Warning: menu is large and lighting is dim.  The hot buttered rum is my favorite here. It's not just buttered, but butterscotched, more like. It's delicious and good for any night. It's got a stick of cinnamon and all. The queens park swizzle was okay, was overflowing with ice. The kona cocktail was strong. There are several serves-4 bowls: volcano, scorpion, and arrack punch. They have a variety of bowls so it's cool seeing which one you get. They'll bring it to you and do a mini fire show of it too.",

Jamaican Milk Punch-I didn't have any because I'm lactose intolerant, but my friend seemed to also really like it.   **Pretty sure he ordered both those drinks so I wouldn't swoop some -___-  Hibiscus Rum Punch-Sweet and delicious! I definitely tasted the alcohol but if you're a big drinker, this might taste like tea to you.  Hot Butterscotch Rum-Warm, smooth, and comforting. They put a cinnamon stick in it which is adorable, but kind of annoying when it keeps hitting you in the face while you're trying to take a sip. Or maybe that's just me.   Tip: There is no food here. Like none. Prepare accordingly.   *Thumbs Up!*",

Went to both Trader Vic's and Smuggler's Cove (Ironically I think they might be affiliated with one another because some of their drinks are rather named the same). However I will say this place has much more character. The decor inside is totally decked out tiki island. All wood, thatch and mesh reeds lines the walls, cargo boxes and benches to sit at. Totally awesome.  Drinks range from potent to mmild and sweet to super sweet. I have had the painkiller, the grog and the fogcutter. I think the painkiller was probably my most potent and it wasn't too bad. A good balance of sweet with a little bit of a kick. \u00a0This place produces a fun crowd as well. I mean how can you be surly or angry at such a place.   There is a standard selection of beer and their special (which I think is Thirsty Bear's Vanilla ale) for those who want to stick to more traditional things. \u00a0  There is little branding on the outside, just a black door with the words, \"Smuggler's Cove\" written kind of small. This is important if you get here early and you can't find it :)  Overall a fun place, not a regular stop but definitely a place to celebrate or at least try once :)",

My personal favorites are the Jet Pilot (about 12 ingredients, including some spices like cinnamon that give it real character), the classic Mai-Tai (done right), and the Fog Cutter. Everything I've tried is unique and delicious, so you won't be disappointed.  There's also a rum tasting menu, I have yet to try, but it is really exhaustive. Something like 100+ rums. However I can recommend a snifter of the house rum, made exclusively for Smuggler's Cove. Just have it neat with a drink and you're good to go.

I did not say a word, kept my cool, which most ELITE members do and instead jumped in a cab.

He explained the origins and why the tasting is setup the way that it is as well as what we should be looking out for when tasting. It was almost like wine, except much, much stronger.  Afterwards, inebriated, we continued on their amazing list of rum based cocktails all of which were delicious (like the Zombie and Puka Punch) and enjoyed the many folks who were getting volcanos being lit up at the bar. This is such a fun spot because it's not too big to be commercial but not too small to be cramped. It's just intimate enough to be fully decorated in Pirate and shipwrecks to be a great time.",

We stepped through the door and right into a Pirates of the Caribbean set. Some may think the decor is overkill, but it's fun :)  The place is pretty cozy, despite the three different levels. Both the main floor and basement bars were crowded - especially downstairs, with the extra seating. One caveat: be prepared to wait a good amount of time for your drink (definitely worth the wait, though!). That night, there was only one bartender per bar - and most drinks have about 15 - 20 different ingredients that need to be blended into magical rum-bliss-inducing concoctions. Props to the main floor bartender - at one point, he was making 14 drinks at the same time. I swear, his hands were a nonstop flurry of movement, as everyone huddled around the bar gazed in awe.  We found some seats on the top floor above the main level, so we ordered the Top Notch Volcano for the three of us girls. It comes in a cool porcelain (aka not drunk-proof) tiki punch bowl, and they light it on fire when presenting it to you! Since it's served with long straws, it's difficult to portion how much you drink (especially when you're sitting down).  Case in point: After drinking my \"share\", I headed downstairs to use the facilities. Upon entering the bathroom, I saw someone to my right and apologized for getting in her way... and then realized I was talking to my own reflection in the full-length mirror on the wall. Yeah. Thankfully, there were no witnesses. (And yes, Jessica W. is referring to me). That punch is potent stuff.  I would definitely come back to try out some of the other mixed drinks on the menu - there's definitely no shortage in selection!",

Well, damn rule makers. \u00a0  Here's the story:  Arrive around 11:15pm on a Friday night. \u00a0There is ONE other girl standing in line. \u00a0I go to show my ID, thinking that the girl is just outside taking an air break. \u00a0Wrong. \u00a0The bouncer goes, \"sorry, we're not letting anyone in.\" \u00a0  I try to look pathetic and plead, because my friends are waiting for me inside. \u00a0He doesn't relent. \u00a0I ask the other girl how long she's been waiting, and she tells me 5 minutes. \u00a0So here we are, outside--2 girls standing alone, just waiting to go in and meet our friends!  I text my friend and explain the situation, growing more agitated by the second. \u00a0A few people trickle out and he doesn't let us in. \u00a0His rationale--sorry, I'm following my orders. \u00a0If that's the case, I guess he's just doing his job, but whoever is making those orders needs to open his/her eyes to how business works.  If you want to generate a huge line at your club to make it look like an awesome place to get in, don't make 2 girls who came by themselves to meet friends wait outside in the cold.  My friend comes out and starts pleading with the bouncer, and he still says no--despite the fact that 2 of our other friends are already inside and have ordered drinks for all of us--read: giving the bar business!  Finally, some others come out and start making sarcastic remarks about whether they'd be able to get back in. \u00a0I guess we weren't the first ones to experience this arbitrary waiting system.  Exasperated, the bouncer finally lets us in, after a growing group of people become annoyed that they can't get 1 or 2 more friends inside, when the rest of the group is already in.  Good thing the rum was able to wash the bitter taste of that scenario out of my mouth (I couldn't take away more stars because the drinks *are* pretty good and I'm a sucker for pirate-themed places), but you'd be hard pressed to find me coming back here on a weekend...unless whoever's in charge changes the bouncer rules.

    "review_text": "It's always amazed me that in a hard-drinking city like San Francisco, the only tiki bar option is the notoriously touristy and octogenarian Tonga Room. There is, of course, The Forbidden Island in Alameda (which I love), but getting there from the city is complicated if one doesn't want to worry about driving. (And when I'm tipping back Zombies, I definitely don't want to have to worry about driving.) So when I heard that one of the founders of The Forbidden Island was opening his very own tiki bar in San Francisco, I was very excited. Unfortunately, my experience at Smuggler's Cove did not live up to my excitement.  My first clue that something was amiss was the velvet (OK, vinyl) rope next to the doorman. A rope? On a Tuesday night? Over the holidays when bars and restaurants are always quiet? Seriously? The doorman was friendly enough, though, and there was no line, so we walked right in.  I have to admit that the owners did a great job with the 3-level space that Jade used to occupy. They obviously sank a lot of money into the place, and it shows. The decor is over the top, as is should be, but stops just short of being tacky. It's not a large space by any means, but the two-story ceiling on the main floor manages to make the small room seem positively airy. The upstairs area features a much lower ceiling, but because it overlooks the bar, as well as an impressive assortment of kitschy objet d'art, it feels more West-Indies treehouse than secondary seating area.  Sadly, my favorite feature of the old Jade bar, the very disconcerting one-way mirror over the bar that allows patrons of the men's bathroom to see out into the crowd in the main room, is gone. (Sigh.)  As annoying as the vinyl rope outside the front door was, it was nothing compared to what we experienced when we got inside and tried to order drinks. After we secured a table upstairs and had a look at the extensive drink menu, my boyfriend went to order for us. A full 15 minutes later, I went down to check on him. He was standing among a group of people who were looking longingly at the one bartender behind the bar. It turns out that after a reasonable 5-minute wait, the bartender took my boyfriend's order, along with those of the 3 people waiting in front of him. That would have been fine, except that there were still drink orders to be filled for several other people who'd ordered before my boyfriend's group. We gave it another few minutes, then left. We would have canceled our drink order, but we were unable to get the attention of the bartender or the other person behind the bar, who was simply standing there, totally oblivious.   Incidentally, when I mentioned my experience to a friend, she responded by saying, \"I had the same experience. About 20 sets of eyes staring at one bartender who never looks up. 20 minutes later a good drink, but then you are done and can't bear to wait another 20 minutes.\"  On the way out, I noticed that there was a line queuing up behind the aforementioned vinyl rope, even though the bar was not crowded inside. This, in my opinion, is a bar/club mortal sin. (Come on, guys. Really? Shouldn't you be above this kind of thing?)  As we were walking over to Paul K for a round of their gorgeous (and efficiently-served) martinis, my boyfriend joked that it would have taken less time for us to hop in a cab and grab drinks at The Forbidden Island in Alameda. In hindsight, I realize he wasn't joking.  I'm really tempted to give Smuggler's Cove one star, but in all fairness, I can't. They have a great space, and a pretty great drink menu (though I can't really attest to how good the drink actually are). I understand and appreciate that the bar/restaurant business is tough one, but they really do need to get it together as far as service goes. Smuggler's Cove's website offers an explanation as to why their bartenders are so slow (\"... do not want to compromise on quality... exotic recipes... as many as 8-11 ingredients... finely balanced\"), but I don't buy it. The bartenders at Beretta in The Mission and Blackbird in the Castro have been turning out superb, complex cocktails at dizzying speed ever since they both opened. True, both establishments have much larger bars than does Smuggler's Cove, but I've watched their bartenders in action on numerous occasions; they know what they're doing, and they know how to do it *quickly*.  As Smuggler's Cove has just opened, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and try them again when they've (hopefully) gotten into their groove. But not if I have to wait behind the vinyl rope.",

Apparently in San Fran there are noise constraints that need to be met as a ton of bars have apt homes above them, crazy! The windows to the bar were even tinted and you could not see a thing - so weird when I am used to Orlando having everything open, no noise constraints and loud people on the streets.  We entered and I immediately was reminded of the Swiss family Robinson tree in Disney's Magic Kingdom. There was such an immediate transition from SF street to Pirate boat! The constraints were small but there were immediate steps leading upstairs or down to different levels. I chose to stay on the main floor and order from the bar in the middle. I was handed a huge menu of options which is not normal for bars I frequent - however, this place obviously being themed after Pirates highlighted Rum! After ordering some fancy drink and tasting various others choices I immediately learned that I am only a fan of Rum in Mojitos :) lesson learned! I bet they had some ahhhhmazing mojitos too, grrrr, maybe I will revisit in 2 weeks when I'm back in San Fran!

I felt slightly guilty when ordering a Pupule and the bartender peeled an entire orange for it, but oh god that was delicious.  I can't blame the people who work here for being annoyed at the clueless \"uhm, so like, do you have beer?\" ones who wander in. That's like walking into a fancy Italian restaurant and bitching that \"why don't y'all have somethin' normal, like a burger or some shit?\" I want to dump a Jack and Coke on your head, too - it's not just the bartender who's fed up. \u00a0  And if you know your stuff, and it's not too busy.... work with your mixologist, they have more than a few interesting drinks up their sleeves, beyond the menu. :)",

First, due to City Fire Regulations, if you have a group of more than 10 people you should expect that not all of you are going to get in due to space limitations.   Second, and the biggest problem, the service is slooooooooooow. On my visit it was taking bartenders about 25-30 minutes to get my group drink orders. Might I add we only had about two to three drinks per order. Seriously. One of my friends came late to the party and went to the bar to order a drink-we didn't see him for 35 minutes as he waited for the bartender to make his drink. Not good.   Third, there is no Happy Hour. This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your demeanor. However, the drinks are expensive.

It took me 1 hour to get my first drink, not because the place was packed but because the bartender was more interested in talking to girls and sharing free shots with them than serving anyone. I managed to get one drink, which wasnt anything special and went back to the bar to get the special barrel drink with fire. This time it took me again a while to get the bartenders attention, he did at least three shots and was substantially drunk at this point. When i ordered he told me to go back to my table (upstairs) and that they will bring the drinks in no time. After waiting upstairs for 30 min I went down to ask what what the status of my drink, the bartender didnt remember at all my order and after i told him about it he told me that he had no more barrels and that there was nothing he could do. When I ask to speak with the manager he got upset, told me that i would have to wait for a while because he was busy. I decided to leave at that moment but he still had my card. Trying to show his power he refused to give me my card, he said \"you wanted to speak with the manager, now you are going to wait for the manager\" and went back to continue serving new free shots to hot girls. This guy was considerably drunk, we got into a big argument, i was kicked out of the place (still without my card) and that is when the manager showed up. After two hours in this place i got 1 drink for me and my girlfriend, spend 1 hour total trying to get a second one and had to deal with a drunk, unprofessional, trying to be cool with the girls bartender. So much for date night. This is the type of place that will get one tome customer based on their fame and can keep going without repeated customers. Stay in your local bar and tell your friends to stay away of this tourist trap. You will save yourself an awful night.",

Unfortunately, they seemingly had to cut costs and hired the world's most ridiculous bouncer and have lost all my respect, and business.   Another reviewer referred to him as Shia LaBeouf, because of his man bun and angst for mankind, and it's clear he is high on the powerful position he holds... as doorman... at a Pirate Bar.   I had not even made eye contact or spoken to Shia before he let me know I was too drunk to enter the bar, and my friends could not enter either. When asked to explain what I had done to give him that idea he said he watched my group and I cross the street. Two fun facts: I did not cross the street to get to the bar, I rounded a corner AND he was talking with someone else as we approached the bar, so not sure what sort of weird sixth sense this guy thinks he has but it was unfounded. While he was letting me know that their \"drinks\" were very \"strong\" and they had a standard to uphold, some drunk middle-aged white man stumbled out of the bar giving us all high fives and acting like a fool, which really drove Shia's point home.   Either way, I am glad he told me that I was too drunk to enter the bar because I was drunk enough to think spending $20.00 on some crap drink that takes 38 minutes to make and drinking it while surrounded by a bunch of drunk, middle-aged, overweight men was a good idea. Great job Shia, keep it up and that promotion to Mall Security Guard will surely come your way soon.  As for my husband, my friends and I, we went to Sugar and had an amazing time with reasonably priced drinks, friendly staff and a young, good looking crowd.

Sadly, dreams of escaping to a Caribbean oasis whilst clanking coconuts and singing old maritime jingles with rosy-cheeked patrons quickly vanished upon visiting Smuggler's Cove this past Friday.  First indicator of douchiness: \u00a0the line outside. \u00a0I understand lines when a.) it's a *club* in which a DJ or some other event is taking place or b.) when the venue is at capacity and people on the inside have to leave in order to make room for people on the outside. \u00a0 Sweater-vest-clad bouncer, however, let people in based on - I don't know, his benevolence? - and not at all according to people leaving the bar.  Once we actually got in, the place was quiet. \u00a0No merriment to be seen or heard. \u00a0Ladies in cocktail dresses and gentlemen in blazers sat cross-legged sipping drinks, quietly chatting with pinkies up. \u00a0  I guess I just don't get it. \u00a0I felt like I was in the Redwood Room... if the Clift hotel decided to suddenly redecorate with fake seaweed and drift wood.",

And the city and hood were pretty much dead.  We walked up and said hi to the bouncer and got reprimanded right away for entering the velvet rope from the wrong side. Even though, again, no one was there.  The bouncer then made us wait while ignoring our questions and staring at his cell phone, mumbling to himself. So, we left without entering.  Is this intentional? New York-esque vibe, and artificially implied crowdedness? Weak stuff, Smuggler's.",

Ok first off, the guy who works the door earned the two stars for the whole place. He was courteous, polite and gave us menus to read and an umbrella because we had to wait outside in the rain, due to the low occupancy of 49 people. He made us laugh and seemed to be pretty knowledgable about the drinks.  We got inside and immediately were faced with a huge crowd, no place to sit and a long line at both bars. After braving the lines we ordered drinks from the bartender downstairs. She seemed to have no interest in what she was doing. I guess I expected a little pizazz in the drink making...maybe a description of the ingredients some parlor tricks perhaps,? Nope..just some mystery liquids, crushed ice , fruit and umbrellas...and a hand waiting for our money.  The drink I ordered was very sour. It was a popule? I dont know...I never finished it. I'm a beer drinker. Their house beer \"Smugglers brew\" was acceptable but by no means delicious.  The crowd is a mix of yuppies, drunken frat boy types and a few cool kids scattered here and there.  No music playing or very low music in the backgound equals a pirate bar with no vibe.  Its definitely lacking in character. It takes more than cool decorations and an anchor on your wall to create ambiance, but at least the door guy was cool.",

Second reason is that they ONLY serve cocktails. \u00a0No beer or wine and the cocktails are very pricey. \u00a0The first drink I got was something like a Chi Chi (they don't have their menu online so I couldn't look up the exact name) and it was 60% ice. \u00a0It was delicious, but four sips and my drink was gone. \u00a0I'm not exaggerating. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0And it cost $9. \u00a0 Second drink was the puka punch, which was better but still not worth $14 plus tip. \u00a0  So basically if you love expensive crazy, mostly rum based, cocktails in an under the sea ship wreck type of setting then this is the bar for you! \u00a0Otherwise, maybe head to a bar in North Beach...that's what we did.",

    "review_text": "So we arrive at 6 pm on a Tuesday night and are told to wait in line. My two friends and I are surprised as its 6 pm, on Tuesday, and our boyfriends are inside and didn't mention the line.  The bouncer tells us they have a 49 person strict capacity so we will have to wait until someone comes out to be let in.  10 min go by AND THEN a suit in the back of the line is let in because his other old suited buddy comes out to get him.  The bouncer then gets very spicy and tells us that that guy had already been inside (false from our in-line conversations with him) and had a drink and I seat waiting for him. Well we pipe up that we have drinks and seats waiting for us inside, and he just ignores us and tells us to get over it. Instead we realize this is a bar, in SF on a Tuesday evening and it cannot be worth all this BS so we text our friends inside and wait for them to meet us at the dive bar down the street.  Report from inside: Boy says the cocktails are good but expensive. Because each one is a handcrafted specialty they take some time to make, and because each of the two bars only had one bartender it took 30-40 minutes to place and get your order at the bar. Ambiance is cool, but overall not worth the BS  Bottom line: try again in a month when the hype has died down and they hire a few more bartenders.",

We waited probably only 25 minutes. When we finally got in, the bar was pretty packed. There is a street level bar and a downstairs bar (which was too packed to visit). The menu is full of rum based drinks, and we had a hard time choosing drinks (I am not too familiar with rum). She had the Kona Cocktail which was smaller than expected, but pretty with a flower in it. Sweet, but not too sugary. I had the Demerera Dry Float, which I enjoyed, but it was very dry.   My only complaint would be that there is very limited space, and empty glasses everywhere (I'm not sure there are any waitstaff. But hey, its a bar. A pirate themed bar! Its supposed to be messy.  Overall the bar had an awesome vibe and I cannot wait to bring my friends! It was awesome watching the bartender/mixologist making 6 drinks at the same time. The drinks are very well worth the price, and despite all of the alcohol, you don't get any strong alcohol flavors (a good thing). On their website, they have an option for you to take tasting notes (a big plus) so that you can work your way through their menu and remember what you enjoyed!   Ill be back!",

As many other reviewers have noted, there's a large selection of drinks and they all taste good. Caution: it takes 5 min to decide what to order and 5 min to get a bartenders attention.   Sometimes there is a wait to get into the bar. It's two floors and they don't like to pack people in here.   Painkiller 2 is bomb if you like sweet drinks and coconut. I think I also had the kona one, which is not loaded with ice. Lots of their drinks have a ton of ice that take up space in the cup.   4 stars cuz I like it but I'm not omg about it.

The drinks are complicated and in high demand but there simply aren't enough bartenders to meet the demand. \u00a0Waiting 20 minutes (no exaggeration) standing at the bar and separated from my party to place an order was a major buzzkill for the night. \u00a0  For the Smuggler's Cove to be an enjoyable experience it either needs to hire a second bartender for each of its bars or hire waitstaff to take your order, or a combination of both. \u00a0Until then, I'd rather walk the plank than return to the Cove.",

    "review_text": "Wow, just an amazing experience. I lucked out and got preview tickets for December 5th. I went with three of my friends. They limited the number of tickets available to ensure that it wasn't too crowded and the bartenders would be able to give each drink their full attention.  The entire place is visually stunning. The decor is less tiki-oriented than some people might expect, but there are many artifacts lining the walls that have come from historic Bay Area tiki bars like Trader Vic's. There are three bars, one on each level, so if the bar you are at is crowded, try one of the others. It's not a huge space, so I'm glad they are limiting the number of patrons allowed at once - this reduces the time you spend waiting for your drink.   The cocktails - what can I say that hasn't been said already? Each one is prepared by hand, with fresh ingredients. Every single one I tried was well-balanced and delicious, with some intriguing flavors; well worth the price. While they did take 5-10 minutes to make, they are well worth the wait. I'm sure as the bartenders get more comfortable making them, the wait time will decrease.  Overall, I'm giving Smuggler's Cove the full five stars. It lived up to all my expectations, and in the case of the drinks, surpassed them. If you appreciate quality cocktails served in a South Seas atmosphere, you will not be disappointed.",

It was around 10 on a Saturday so I wasn't surprised to find a line of people waiting to get in and we waited 15-20 minutes but the guy managing the line was friendly and pleasant. Ok, we finally got in and I thought the hardest part was behind us but no. The space is small and it was packed to the point of discomfort with people jostling for drinks at both bars. The bartender overcharged us for our drinks (either that or the prices on the drink menu are out of date) and it took almost as long to get them as it did waiting in line. Once I got my Jamaican Planters Punch, it was strong and refreshing but we couldn't really find any personal space and I was eager to go once we finished our first round drinks. It's great for the owners of Smuggler's Cove that the place is so popular but maybe they should think about a larger space to accommodate the hordes of people waiting to get in. Personally, I think that Tiki bars should be relaxing and this place stressed me out.",

The \"bartender\" was continually looking up drinks on the computer.

She couldn't remember a drink's contents for the life of her, it took her nearly thirty minutes to get drinks out, and she couldn't handle the concept of \"I'm paying for these two, she's paying for that one\".

Bartender downstairs was an authority on rum and made excellent drinks. I ordered the special drink in a special barrel glass (to take home), which was outstanding. Note, we came back a few days later but had an awful experience with the bouncer (see next review).   Trip 2: 1 STAR. I wish I could write a review on our experience for our second trip to Smuggler's Cove, but unfortunately it ended at the door. The Bouncer let in 3 people who arrived just before we walked up, and then stopped us at the door and told us we had to wait. We were happy to wait, but it was very windy and cold outside so I asked if my wife could wait inside the little entry way (away from the other guests and the bouncer himself, who was waiting further inside - I guess he was cold). The Bouncer very rudely refused to let her in the doorway. We both thought this was extremely obnoxious. We had come from a fairly fancy dinner and were both dressed well (and we're both in our mid-20s, so I assume the clientele they want), and she was in a dress that didn't keep her very warm in the cold. After this encounter, we decided to just go home and not waste our time. It was a good thing that Uber was more accommodating than the bouncer. Also worth noting - while we we were waiting for our Uber (1-2 minutes per the Uber app), two more people walked right into the bar and were not asked to wait outside (even though no one inside the bar had left). This added insult to injury, and put a bad taste in our mouth on our last night in San Fran before ending our vacation.",

The place has a \"speakeasy\" meets \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" meets \"tropical version of Rickhouse.\" The place is divided into three tiers- seating that over looks the bar below (think ship-wrecked tree house), the main floor with bar numero uno, and a downstairs bar and seating. (I don't like the downstairs as much- low ceilings and not nearly as decorated.) It's definitely a fun atmosphere!  Although I'm not a huge rum fan, they have an amazing array of drinks to chose from. I've had the Scorpion punch (yummy, sweet, fruity), Hibiscus punch, and good ol' mojito.

There are a ton of interesting cocktails, including one served with a flame on top in a large skull-shaped receptacle (awesome to observe, no clue about the experience). \u00a0I would list the three drinks my friend and I tried, but I can't remember the names and complicated ingredients. I tried to be a good Yelper and find them on the website, but you can't see the full menu without signing up on the \"Tasting Notes\" section, meaning that you have to give them your email addy. Boo. I can say this: I'd give my unnamed drink 5 out of 5 stars for taste, 3 for alcohol content per unit price, and 1 for wait time per unit price. I guess the other reviewers' references to Disneyland are correct - high in price, low in adult content, and heavy on anticipation factor.   I like the mysteriously understated black tinted windows that serve as the storefront. It's nice and minimalist, and also belies the kitsch inside. As a soft-spoken person, I also appreciate that instead of allowing 18 kajillion people inside at once they insist on maintaining a line to get in. I like going out to bars and such, but standing around yelling isn't my idea of a good time.  Call it the novelty factor, call it the intriguing, overpriced mystery cocktails, I'm not sure. My carousing here isn't over yet. Ahoy...",

Offering a ponderous tome of a menu, complete with history of each drink (over 70!), I was happy with the cocktails. \u00a0I found the drinks tasty but just slightly lacking in the entertaining department. \u00a0I visited Three Dots &amp; a Dash (another nationally recognized Tiki bar) in Chicago earlier in the year so was consciously comparing the two and found Smuggler's \"fun\" factor a bit lacking, even if it excelled at the \"lore\" department. \u00a0It was still impressive all things considered. \u00a0Rum flight makes me smile, and of course the selection is large and exciting. \u00a0  The reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because of the atmosphere. \u00a0  I guess Smuggler's Cove goes for a more cozy and intentionally less fancy interior as far as Tiki bars are concerned. \u00a0I also guess, that ideally the effect was to be more piratey this way and less artificially exotic to the point of corny like some Tiki bars can be. \u00a0Unfortunately, it did not produce the desired effect for me. \u00a0It felt just a bit cramped and dowdy. \u00a0The ground level bar where we sat was small and the lone bartender was kind of surly. \u00a0Again I consciously compared this to Three Dots, and found that I much prefer the fun atmosphere which Smuggler's Cove just doesn't seem so adapt, or even keen, at providing. \u00a0Ultimately this is a matter of personal taste and can change pending future visits. \u00a0Based on drinks alone, its national renown is quite well deserved, and is one of San Francisco's best bars a visitor should try to check out.",

The drinks. Oh the pages and pages of drinks, and each on with its own paragraph-long description. Look for little symbols that tell you its either a classic, or a bartender's choice-- that will help narrow it down. \u00a0Those are great go-to's and I have not been disappointed by any drink I've had here, frozen, shaken, or straight up. \u00a0There is fine craftsmenship in each beverage, with techniques you won't see anywhere else (clapping herbs to release oils, layering creams and homemade tinctures). \u00a0And if you're serious about rum, join a tasting club and try hundreds of high quality rums from all over.  No cover, but the drinks make up for it. \u00a0Be prepared to spend a pretty penny-- but you'll be happy to do so.

I came here for the first time on Friday night and I have to say, I had a good time. The line was pretty long (and for a good reason). It's extremely tiny inside. Thank goodness when we got there some of our friends were in line for us and we were pretty much the next group. I noticed the bouncer was splitting up people's groups into two's or three's and he split us up into two groups. The total wait was about 30-35 minutes.  Once inside, we were able to squeeze everyone on the top third floor. We didn't get to sit next to the balcony overlooking the bar below and all the over the top decor, but never the less we had a good time. A bar-back brought us a couple of menus to look at and we took two volcano bowls and a couple of well mixed drinks. Getting the drinks were a bit of hassle at the bar on the entrance floor because it was literally like a damn shoe box! I don't know how the bartender maneuvers around in there because its so small. Getting drinks took about a good 15 minutes. It was worth the wait though because we had quite the show when they lit both bowls on fire at once. I didn't expect them to lite the entire thing on fire, but they did. It went up in a pretty big flame which caught all of us off guard. For $36 bucks a bowl, considering the fire show it was worth the price because you don't see that too often at a bar.. I just wish it was a bit larger. We finished them in literally five minutes and it didn't help that there was way more ice than alcohol.  We didn't get to explore the very bottom floor, which I heard has some type of fountain or lagoon, because we came here to pre-party before we hit the clubs. I definitely will be back again to try out more drinks on the menu and just to have a good time with friends. Big group, little group.. It don't matter! You'll find a place to sit everyone because the bouncer helps regulate the crowd flow inside (hence, the wait). He was very friendly and super nice btw. He got really excited when my friend's sister told him \u00a0'you look like p. diddy.' Haha. Enough said though, I say come give this place a try if you haven't already!",

In keeping with the grown-up-disneyland theme, there is a strict capacity limit, and you may encounter a line to get in. \u00a0This is nice when you're inside, because it doesn't get nearly as crowded, loud, and hot as Jade used to, but I'm sure it's annoying if you have to wait for someone to finish up their elaborate fruity concoction and get the heck out of there. \u00a0Try going early Sunday night - there was no line at 9pm.  Novelty is key here, just like Disneyland. \u00a0This will never be your cozy neighborhood hangout, unless you're truly that into rum and pirates, and can afford $8-11 cocktails on a regular basis. \u00a0Those are the caveats.  Why'd I give it four stars? \u00a0The drinks were made extremely well and had plenty of booze for the buck - I had the El Diablo (tequila) and the Painkiller #3 (rum). \u00a0I preferred the El Diablo - slightly fizzy, sweet, and sour. \u00a0 The bouncer, Justin, was also a sweetheart - as I was waiting for my friends he brought me a drink menu and told me to come inside where it was warmer, and I could have his seat (then cautioned me not to talk to the blonde girl behind me because she was super annoying). \u00a0He probably gets a star of his own just for that.  I am rarely in a pirate/tiki mood, and when I want to ogle sailors I wait for Fleet Week, but should I ever find myself wearing a tri-cornered hat and needing a fancy drink, I will go back to Smuggler's Cove.",

Here's to asking the bartender for a new recommendation every time, and LOVING the result every time!  THE WAIT: About 30-45 minutes at 10pm on a Saturday. We made friends with a group of really fun older people in line. This is what I love about SF - there's no judgement, and plenty of love between people of sorts of people!  Once inside, I made a couple more friends when I saw the amazing tiki mug (think mini totem pole - for your DRINK) they were holding. You can get it with the Expedition. We were sold.  Must-haves:   * The Expedition - 4.5 stars (Jamaican rum, bourbon, fresh lime, cinnamon, honey, vanilla, Bitterman's New Orleans coffee liqueur. $13 cocktail only, $25 to keep the Kuhiko mug) Very refreshing, a good balance of sweet and tart flavors, and it's rather strong as well! We love our tiki mug =).  * Demerara Dry Float - 5 stars (Dry &amp; tart - a vibrant mix of exotic passion fruit, lemon, lime, and demerara rums, served w/ a side of danger. $11) I asked the bartender for a well balanced tart drink and he immediately recommended this, which was perfect for me. The passion fruit is strong, and this tasted like a deliciously tart fruit punch - wasn't too fruity for the boys either!  * Jet Pilot - 3.5 stars (lime, grapefruit, cinnamon, bitters, nerves of steel, falernum, Jamaican &amp; Guyanese rums, and Herbsaint. $13) More on the strong/boozy side - a fairly well-balanced old-fashioned. More a drink for the boys, and they really liked it. I did see a guy who was completely overwhelmed by the menu just ask the bartender to make his own favorite drink, and he made this one!  * Tradewinds - 4 stars (lemon, coconut cream, apricot liqueur, and both dark Jamaican &amp; silver rums. $10) With the coconut cream, this definitely had a thicker consistency and had more of a tropical island punch vibe to it. It was still well balanced and had just enough enough of an alcohol kick to it.  * Rum Barrel - 4 stars Also a great well-balanced, spiced, tart/fruity drink. Well liked by all!",

It looks fairly non-descript and modern on the outside, but go in, and you're surrounded by fishing floats, blowfish lamps and a waterfall wall. On the main floor along the left side wall are little shrines to tiki bars past -- a nice touch. There are three levels -- the bottom being the most dark and intimate and condusive to conversation, the top level with the thatched roof gives you a birds-eye view of the action.   One look at the extensive menu and you know that you're in the \"thinkin' guy's tiki bar\" -- there are descriptions of the recipes, their history and the ingredients, including rum. Lots and lots of rum.  I tried a Kona cocktail, which was made with fresh pineapple juice, and was pleasantly tangy/sour and not icky-sweet -- finished off with an orchid, of course. My companion had a \"three dots and a dash.\" Now, I grew up in Hawaii and I have never, no, never seen a drink called that at any bar I've ever been to in Honolulu. But he had no complaints, and overall, it was a fun experience.  The attention to detail and the love for tiki culture is evident. The music was soft enough to allow me to have a nice conversation with my friend and a few friendly folks I met at the bar -- again, not a given in bar scenes.  It was a little odd that there were no snacks/nuts or whatever to go with our drinks, but we had just eaten dinner, so we weren't exactly aching for eats. Still, I wouldn't recommend slammin' back a Smugglers' Cove cocktail on an empty stomach.  street parking was easy to find -- but then again, my friend says he has good parking karma, and it was a monday.

The drinks at this bar are absolutely DELICIOUS! I'm sure you get all of your vitamin C from some of these tropical fruity rum cocktails! The scorpion bowl is also SUPER strong and really impressive.  The only down side of this bar -- tough for a large group party. The seating is a lil sparse and you end up being like a vulture, waiting to jump on the nearest seat as soon as someone makes any indication that they are leaving. Also it takes a little long to get your delicious drinks. Otherwise, I would have given this place five stars. :)",

    "review_text": "Smugglers Cove was on our MUST SEE list while in San Francisco as part of our three state Tiki Extravaganza.  The pros: Anyone who is a fan of neo -cocktail culture experience will appreciate Smugglers Cove: Really delicious drinks, Exhaustive rum menu, A history packed and educational cocktail menu (I LOVED that the menu provided provenance for most of their concoctions), top notch bartenders - WOW!  The Cons: This place is small and even on a Tuesday night PACKED from about 8-10!!!!!! Really, really packed (its tiny) .So yes your personal space will be violated and yes there can be a significant wait to both order your drink and receive it and yes it gets noisy.  So following the same form as for the other bars on my list, I rated Drinks, D\u00e9cor, Bartender, Price and Overall Experience on a scale of 1-10  DRINKS: (Taste, value, drinking pleasure) Tasty, tasty, tasty drinks. Delicious mixes with fruit and spicy and booze. Pleasantly relaxing, and each unique compared to the other. They do a Trader Vic's style Mai Tai (Don's is my fav but ridiculously complex) perfect balance of fresh lime, curacao, orgeat and rum with fragrant mint garnish! Just the right sour vs sweet with just enough boozy to make it adult. I was there with two friends - whose drinks were also delicious and different from mine.   SCORE: 10  D\u00e9cor: (Looking for Unusual, evocative, fun, cheese factor.) \u00a0Smuggler's Cove d\u00e9cor was cute - nice \u00a0touches. BUT they had very little room and really the super stars here are the drinks. As other's have commented they are playing up the pirate theme. \u00a0I do love that the front door is practically unidentifiable from outside - works with the hidden cove vibe but nothing particularly extraordinary except the menus. As mentioned above the menus are like a history lesson with booze!!! LOVED reading the cocktail descriptions and where they came from.   SCORE: 6  Bartender and staff: \u00a0(Two primary criteria here: Mixology skill and aloha spirit.) \u00a0 OK - before I wax poetic about the actual bartender couple of additional comments. The doorman was nice, welcoming and informative - what a great way to start a night out. The owner and startender Martin Cate was helping out with some bar back duties the night we were in - also hospitable and warm. When the entire staff makes you feel welcome, any bar gets huge brownie points. An inclusive vibe is of paramount importance to my enjoyment of a bar - I am not looking for status or exclusivity when I go drinking and I had enough of cliques in high school.  So now on to the bartender. The bartender on the main floor the night we were in was Dale. 1. He seemed to keep track of what everyone was drinking -including us so it wasn't limited to regulars. People would come up and ask for \"something with lime and a little coconut, but not too sweet\" and he would get them queued up and delivered. 2. Despite the fact it was busy, whenever he was on our side of the bar he would pleasantly answer questions about technique or the tools he was using. 3. I think he had the giant menu memorized - no matter what people asked for he seemed to just make without any reference. 4. No matter how many people were lining up he kept his cool and was friendly and efficient. 5. And all of this AND tasty drinks.  SCORE: 10  Price: I evaluated price with the understanding that Tiki drinks ARE pricey and I was in expensive cities. The prices at Smugglers Cove were \u00a0maybe slightly above average even \u00a0for Tiki drinks BUT they were extremely well crafted and none of them were stingy.   SCORE: 7  Overall: This was the most subjective category and scored solely on how much I enjoyed myself at the bar. I am a dive bar sort of gal, Smuggler's Cove was not really a dive bar and was obviously very popular so while \"Good for them\" I would have preferred a less populous destination. However, I will make it a point to try and stop by my next trip to San Francisco - I'll just try to go earlier in the night or something.   SCORE: 8  Total Score: 41",

It was much appreciated and set the tone for the rest of my experience there.  Not really too sure about the place being pirate-themed, but it was cozy and, er, snazzy (I'd have said it was \"cute\" by default, but I'm sure no pirate-themed business would accept it as a proper description). As many have said, the place is small and cramped, and its exterior convinces others that they're closed.  I don't know how often they bring drinks to tables and describe all the bowl's bells and whistles, but that was ... okay, it was pretty darn cute. And friendly! For a bar, that itself is a four-star. Ratcheting it up to a five for the overall feel of the place.  (Oh, and the girls' bathroom is clean. Hooray for clean bathrooms! I think real pirates would frown upon this practice ... but don't change it, ever! Beware the mirror that's immediately on the right as you walk in, though; I scared myself spineless when I saw my reflection up close. IDK, maybe that's just me.)  -- Also, I will say that they put a ton of ice into the bowls. I guess if you're a heavy drinker, you may as well forego sharing. But this just tells me I'm going to, like, sneak in a plastic spoon the next time so I can munch on the ice.  -- AND! One of the bouncers was really nice about letting patrons know to move their cars somewhere else because of street cleaning. Pretty sure that isn't part of his job description, so I thought that was really impressive. Whoever runs this place knows how to pick their employees.",

When I found out the Smuggler's Cove took over the old Jade Bar, I was a \u00a0little disappointed that my old school Happy Hour bar had closed up shop. I do like the whole Smuggler's Cove renovation, but if I knew that the bartenders were going to hold out on me I would have just gone straight to Trad'r Sam. On a non-busy Friday night, I ordered a Jamaican Milk Punch. For this drink alone I would have given the Smuggler's Cove 5 starts, but my cup was filled to the brim with ice and I could literraly finish the drink in 1gulp. As much as this drink was delicious...$8 dollars for a shot of milk. Come on?! I could have gone to Trad'r \u00a0Sam and probably spent the same amount on 2 equally delicious Pina Coladas. OOHHH and I forgot to mention, my friend waited 15 minutes for a Mai Tai after the bartender totally forgot about her order.

The is a bar on the level you come in on, and a downstairs seating area and a small upstairs seating area, it was busy in both seating areas so we sat at the bar. Between us we ordered 4 different kinds of cocktails, they have a really good cocktail menu and a huge selection of rums. The barman (sorry dont know his name) seemed to be the only one behind the bar - well it was small, but what an awesome job he did. Whilst making cocktails people were placing orders, and he was really quick and didnt forget one single order. There are two drinks on the menu that come in tiki bowls, which are set alight and look really cool, sadly I never noticed this till we were leaving, so will definitely have to go back to try those.

For all you haters out there to note: \u00a0This is not the type of bar you come to with large groups, or to pick up, or to do shots and get totally sh!t faced. \u00a0Go to North Beach or the Marina for that kids.  This IS the kind of bar to enjoy a super cool ambiance, unique &amp; fantastic drinks and beyond friendly service. \u00a0I'm going to break it down for you...  Ambiance: Every Tiki bar needs to be fun and have lots of kitsch... and Smuggler's Cove does that perfectly! \u00a0Yes, you feel like you're in a set from Disneyland's Pirates of the Caribbean, but when do you ever get to drink in Disneyland?! \u00a0Case in point.  Unique and Fantastic Drinks: \u00a0The drink menu reads like a novel with probably 50 or more concoctions I've never heard of with wacky ingredients you don't find in most modern day cocktails. \u00a0We sat at the bar and as Melissa, the bartender, kept whipping out strange ingredients I kept asking her, \"what's that?!\". \u00a0She indulged me and always answered with a smile but I'm sure she was probably getting annoyed. \u00a0Of the two drinks I ordered the Batida was by far my favorite. \u00a0Sweet, creamy... did I mention sweet?! \u00a0Probably had something to do with the sweetened condensed milk, mmmm. \u00a0My friend got the Puka Punch, which was great as well. \u00a0And then there's the Rum Barrel... $20 for the drink WITH the custom mug (the mug alone was something like $35... so its just economically responsible to get it for less WITH the cocktail!). \u00a0And the cherry on top of all this... the kick a$$ swizzle sticks! \u00a0Seriously, these are the most substantial and intricate swizzles I've seen!   Beyond Friendly Service: \u00a0Yes, you may have to wait in line, but Justin the bouncer is so nice! \u00a0Again for the haters: you're waiting in line because they strictly limit the number of people inside so you can enjoy yourself without having constantly be bumping into others, spilling your drinks down the front of yourself and yelling about the crowd. \u00a0Again, if that's what you want then please go to a bar in the Marina or N. Beach and leave Smuggler's alone! \u00a0But I digress, back to the service. \u00a0Melissa was a really nice bartender and kept apologizing to us for having to wait in line so long. \u00a0She handled the extremely complex drink concoctions with as much ease as you can. \u00a0These aren't your typical G&amp;T folks, so be patient... you won't be disappointed. \u00a0And so what if she has to look at notes, did I mention that there are probably about 50+ unique cocktails with no less than 5 ingredients each?! \u00a0Even the bar back (didn't get his name) was extremely sweet and even seemed sad that we were leaving. \u00a0Everyone said goodbye and that they hoped we would return.   And Return I will. \u00a0After all, I have to try every last one of those 50+ cocktails!",

The drinks are masterfully imagined and created with finesse in front of you using fresh delicious ingredients. I've never had a bad drink here- all are layered in flavor and intensity. The menu is large but does repeat in flavors. I can't lie that I get slightly bummed when I realize the drink I ordered comes in a small martini glass; I wish they specified what drink receptacle you may be receiving on the menu. Prices are high but the drinks are elevated. The crowds can be obnoxious as this is a 'destination'/celebration bar. My favorite thus far is Captains Grog- grapefruit, maple syrup, falernum, orange liqueur, vanilla, almond, and 3 rums. It would be nice if they had more bowls or offered happy hour.",

The cocktails, of course, are top notch - I'd expect nothing less from Martin Cate and his staff.   Sure the drinks are a little pricey, but you're getting fresh ingredients and homemade syrups. The drinks are made with intention - they aren't slopped into a glass and thrown to you across the bar. These guys are paying respect to the vintage tiki cocktails of yore. So shelling out a little more for a wonderful cocktail isn't a major hangup for me.  The atmosphere is as moody as you'd expect. Lots of rattan, bamboo and glass floats. The music is FANTASTIC, as I'm a huge space age pop fan. And every few minutes, the gentle sound of a ship bell is rung over the sound system. Nice touch!  If you're a huge rum enthusiast, you need to get yourself here and sign up for their rum program. They even have a locked cabinet behind the bar containing revolving premium rum selections for the program members. If I lived in SF I'd be all over that.  My only negative comment would be their Smuggler's Cove Rum Barrel is extremely disappointing. Way way too sweet. The other drinks I had - Three Dots &amp; A Dash and the Mai Tai, were excellent.",

I'm a fan of rum so I was excited to check out this new Hayes Valley watering hole that specialized in this amazing elixir. Unfortunately, our visit proved to be a disappointing one as we only stayed for 30 minutes (even though it took 15 minutes just to get drinks!).  The layout hasn't changed from when this space used to be called Jade bar, so the tri-level space is still quite small and narrow, which made it difficult to move around when the bar is crowded. Not only is it hard to maneuver the bar, but also the time it takes to get drinks can be quite long. I'm not bashing the bartenders as I do think they're working hard. It's more of an operations issue for the owners to tackle. I appreciate the original drink menu that was obviously well thought through, but because each drink has 7+ ingredients, the bartenders can only work so fast. The combination of the small space and the long wait for drinks did not make for a great experience. Maybe I'll check out this spot on a weekday to see if it's more manageable.",

    "review_text": "Back when Don Beach and Vic Bergeron were opening their eponymous tropical theme dining establishments, around WWII, fine dining in America was French, L'Escoffier style, with several heavy courses rich in fat and salt, and liberally doused with heart-hostile sauces. \u00a0The minor folk ran towards diners, lunch counters and neighborhood cafes. \u00a0The bar scene was just as stratified, with clubs like the Stork and 21, and neighborhood taverns for the rest. \u00a0  Power brokers drank Martinis made with gin and vermouth; scotch on the rocks; with soda; or bourbon. \u00a0Everyone else made do with beer, local wine, and rot gut. \u00a0Rum was for sailors.  Thus, Trader Vics (which, admittedly, catered more towards the high end of the dining and drinking spectrum) and Don The Beachcomber were something new, an informal take on dining, with cocktails even \"ladies\" could like; sweet and fruity. \u00a0 People did wear suits, they wore them everywhere, but the experience was meant to be informal and relaxing; fun. \u00a0Nobody took the food seriously and the cocktails were a diversion, men especially would order their \"usual\" poison from the drier spirits, and the bartenders wouldn't think of passing judgement.  So, it's rather ironic, and sad, really, that we get a bang-up reincarnation of a good old theme bar that is also a temple of rum. \u00a0The last part I had presumed to be a focus more than a religion. \u00a0Churches and Bars differ in that churches demand that you come to them, and arrive willing to accept their worldview, whereas bars hope to attract your business and adapt their worldview to your tastes. \u00a0And that's the way it seemed to work, until a recent monday evening when I met up \u00a0with my cousin at Smuggler's Cove, and ran into the bartender from Hell. \u00a0  Kansas, I suspect, but Hell will do.  I should say that I've never been good with spirits. \u00a0A few too many and my mind goes to bed while my body is still at the bar. \u00a0But now, with gout, I have even more pressing reasons to avoid spirits, and beer, and so I drink only wine, and Smuggler's Cove has a rather quaffable vintage, especially given the swill most bars pass off as the nectar. \u00a0So, I started my night with a Arrogant Bastard, gin and juice and gingerbeer--a fine drink, expertly made, and then switched to wine. \u00a0After about four glasses and a couple of hours, I was surprised that the partner was ready to leave (my cousin already had, leaving her husband and his brother behind) and so I ordered a shot of rum to close out the night, when the parsimonious twit replied, before I could even ask for him to recommend something, \"I'll just get your check\".  I've done some asking around and apparently, the pudgy little transplant from the bible-belt is known for his rum snobbery. \u00a0\"Rum snobbery\", isn't that funny? \u00a0Sort of like a whore getting particular about who she hangs out with.  Still, a tropical bar is supposed to be about getting loose, and getting away from the uptight, not adding to it, but when we live in an era of casual fridays amidst non-formal everydays, maybe things have gone crazy.  I can't go back. \u00a0I don't want the unpleasant experience of running into that twit again. I go out to have fun, to get away from my miserable job and the dreadful people I have to deal with. \u00a0Who wants to go into a bar and find the village vicar is tending, and passing judgement at the same time?  He makes good cocktails, but that's no excuse for his abominable square-state prissyness.",

It could have been my sadness over Jade closing or the huge hype this place had when it opened. But I decided to check it out, on Halloween weekend! And I was really happy with what I saw.  First of all, I love the decor. I seriously felt like I was walking into Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland. Not sure if that's what they were going for, but I loved it. And also, for their selection of tasty drinks. I often find it difficult to find a cocktail that I'll actually like at places like Rye, Bourbon and Branch, etc. The reason being, they tend to veer away from vodka and rum (clearly too plebeian for them) and go with bourbon, whiskey, and gin - all liquors I don't really care for. So it's nice to come to a bar where most (if not all) of their cocktails are made with a liquor I can get behind!  We sat upstairs at the main bar and we were lucky to get there early enough so that it was not crowded. The bartenders were super friendly and very fast! I always thought cocktails took a long time to prepare but these guys have got it down to a science.  It was such a fun experience, I have no doubt I'll be back. And to boot, I like it better than I liked Jade! Who woulda thunk it?!",

The bouncer made his way over to us and told us that they have neighbors and everyone needs to keep their voices down. Okay great. Well not even five minutes later, and we were talking at a normal volume, the bouncer rushed over to us and yelled \"that's it, everyone out of the line, you aren't allowed to go in!\" Shocked I said that we were sorry, we were just talking and I will make sure to keep everyone quiet. To which he replies \"No, get out!\" and then walk away. I was completely disappointed in this place. The rude and angry bouncer totally ruined my excitement of this place and frankly after that experience I will not be returning in the future. His attitude was completely unnecessary and he really needs to check himself.  As a comparison, I went to the other SF bar on the top 50 in the world list, Trick Dog, the night after and had a completely different experience. Trick Dog was friendly, nice and not at all rude like Smugglers Cove. Skip Smugglers Cove and check out Trick Dog instead.",

    "review_text": "I went here at 9PM on a Saturday night because one of my friends decided to have a birthday here (bad idea) and I sat in the basement level. This is the busiest night of the week so avoid it if you can. And the bouncer (tall skinny white guy) was nice and friendly to me and my date so I don't know why other reviewers had beef with him.  GOOD: - Someone at the door gave me and my date a free shot of rum each to warm us up because we had waited outside so long. The rum was good and it was a nice gesture. +1 star for that. - The Smuggler's Rum Barrel (2nd to last page of the menu) was very good and full of spice. - The place is kind of cute I guess with its waterfall and pirate ship theme. My date said that the overall structure is the same as Jade Bar, the former bar that used to inhabit this space. - The crowd is pretty laid back and not pretentious. This isn't really a pick up scene and they don't blast music so people aren't loud and obnoxious.   JUST OKAY: - The Batida (milkshake) was tasty but not great. It is basically cachacha, condensed milk, coconut cream, and passion fruit juice. It was a little too heavy on the coconut cream so that is all you really taste. - The Grog (2nd page of the menu) was disappointing because I had high expectations for drinking grog, the drink made famous from pirate movies or tv shows. It was just rum and lime juice basically. Nothing really special at all.  BAD: - The Chadburn (2nd to last page of the menu) was gross (tasted kind like a weird licorice). It was a mix of rum, port, chocolate mole bitters and something else but both my date and I thought it was gross.  - The wait to get inside was ridiculous because the place is small (max capacity of 49 people). The line when we got there was about 12-15 people long and we waited 40 minutes to get inside. If it wasn't for my friend's birthday, I would NOT have waited this long. Unless you absolutely must drink rum or have a birthday to attend, I would not wait more than 2 minutes to get into this place.  - The wait to get a drink is also ridiculous. There are 3 floors but the top floor is just for seating. There is a bar on the ground level and basement level, each staffed by ONE bartender. The capacity is 49 people so each bartender has to handle roughly 25 customers. If the bartender takes 2 minutes (conservative estimate) to make 1 drink and half the floor (12 people) are ahead of you, you are going to wait about 25 minutes before you get your drink. This happened to me on my 2nd round and I was sitting at the bar (which only had room for 4 seats). \u00a0 - They used crushed ice in their drinks. This is a cheap tactic for mixed drinks because they can fit more ice into their glasses and the ice melts faster thus allowing them to make smaller drinks. Other reviewers claim that this place is a fancy bar but a real high-end bar would use large ice cubes, preferably chipped from a block of ice because their is less surface area on the ice and it will melt slower.  - I didn't come here expecting amazing mixologists but other reviewers seem to have over-hyped the bartenders here. It would be a stretch to say that the bartenders are well-trained mixologists creating amazing masterpieces. The bartender frequently referred to drink recipes on an LCD screen (shouldn't they know these by heart?) and they would sloppily let ingredients spill over their measures from frantic imprecise pouring. If you want to see a true mixologist, I recommend Thad Volger, who I think is at Heaven's Dog now (formerly at Jardiniere, Bourbon &amp; Branch, and Beretta). The drinks themselves taste fine and I would leave it at that but I don't want readers to get false expectations from other reviewers who gush about their drink making abilities (maybe they are friends of the owner or the bartender upstairs was better? I don't know).  CONCLUSION: Smuggler's Cove is a quaint and casual tiki bar with some tasty drinks. Unless you must have rum, avoid this place on weekends because the drinks/scene is not worth waiting in line for and when it is busy, you will wait even more to get your drink because there is only one bartender on each floor. I would come back if there was no line.",

However, he let 5 of us in... and then proceeded to tell us we'd have to stagger the last few ppl. My friend obviously let out a jaded comment of \"Wow, really...?\" When we reminded him of the fact that he told us he'd let the rest of us in together, he blatantly said, \"Well, this place is small. It's a Friday night; how do you expect to come in with a F***ING group of 13 people at 11pm? Don't be sarcastic with me.\" WTF. Who said it was ok to drop the f-bomb to customers? We told him we'd been waiting since 10:30pm, and he continued to insinuate that we were being sarcastic. Yes, we were definitely antsy to get in, but we did NOT swear at all or give that much attitude. When he finally let us in, we were being somewhat cooperative and asked, \"All of us?\" And he responded with a snooty remark, \"Well if you want, 3 of you can come in and the rest of you can continue waiting if you want.\" WOW... and you were saying WE were being sarcastic? STRIKE ONE.  So onwards into the bar that we've been waiting an hour for... Got to admit, the place does look pretty cool. A pirate ship and tiki bar all in one place. Small seating area upstairs, bar on the entrance floor, and another seating/bar area on the bottom floor. But yes, I can see how they try to limit the amount of patrons here since it's not that large. Still doesn't explain the doorman's attitude though. We started ordering drinks, and the bf ordered a Scorpion ($36) that's supposed to be big enough for 4 people. The bartender insisted that we needed to have a table to be able to order it. We assured him we did since our friends were saving a table for us. But he kept questioning (2-3x), \"You guys have a physical table? Why are you down here if you have a table?\" Ummm... maybe it's because you don't often take drink orders upstairs? And of course I have a physical table... did you think I was referring to an intangible table? \u00a0He eventually gave it to us, but that was definitely STRIKE TWO.   And STRIKE THREE. We were about to leave when my friend accidentally dropped his keys off the railing of the top floor near the bartender's bottles. We were trying to carefully fish it out, but another friend unfortunately knocked over a bottle in the process. Ok, definitely our bad cause we could have hit the bartender, but luckily, it was pretty far from him. We definitely apologized, but a waiter ran up and shouted, \"WHAT THE F**K ARE YOU GUYS DOING?\" We said we were sorry, but he wasn't having any of it and told us to get the f**k out of there. (They actually said the f-words too.) We were on the way out of the bar, my friend retrieved the keys, and the bartender simply tossed the keys over rudely and said, \"Don't come back.\" Hey! Great idea, I wasn't planning on it anyways!  AND... YOU'RE OUT. Wow, what a HORRENDOUS HORRENDOUS experience. Yes, the last part was bad on our part, but totally an accident, which we sincerely apologized for. Smuggler's Cove, that gives you NO RIGHT to swear and cuss at us numerous times throughout a 3 hour period. The drinks were ok, but the service and overall experience I had here were SO BAD to make up for anything even slightly positive.  I am definitely going to share my horrible experience with others, and this will not be a place I ever come back to. I never knew a business could treat its patrons so poorly, but guess everything is possible with Smuggler's Cove!",

    "review_text": "I have mixed feelings about this place...  We have wanted to come forever, but were put off by the rumors of LONG waits.   We ended up being in the city earlier than normal, (picking up a friend for an extended layover from SFO) Since we had time to kill (our dinner res wasn't for awhile and was nearby.), perfect opportunity to check this place out. We had been told if we go there when they opened we wouldn't be stuck outside in line.  We got there at 5:15, they open at 5. There was no line, but it was \u00a0PACKED.  We ended up in the downstairs bar, and snagged some seats by the pond. I had to fight to save the hubby's sear while he went and ordered for the 3 of us.  The menu is HUGE. Since the place is slammed, I wasn't about to ask a bartender \u00a0any questions about the drinks. Wasn't a fan of the set-up, it's run like a dive bar, but clearly isn't. Most cocktail places we've been, with big lists (or in this case a book) and high prices, you also get some service and the opportunity to get some info on the drinks. Obviously, whatever they're doing is working for them, it just wasn't my preference.  We all loved our drinks, and would have ordered another round , but didn't have another 40 mins to wait for it.  We also felt a little hot and claustrophobic packed in as we were, Yes, the wait for drinks is LONG. I get that they're craft cocktails, but 1 bartender for hordes of people? Yikes, would not want to be him.  Glad we finally went, and if the buzz \u00a0about this place ever normalizes, I'd go back.  Although, seeing the droves of people lined up when we left, can't imagine that will happen.",

Nice and low-key atmosphere but why the heck did we wait in line if there were barely any people inside? Makes no sense. The bouncer's response, \"you have to wait out here so you don't wait in line at the bar.\" \u00a0Umm, ok. HINT: Hire more bartenders!!!  Upon ordering my drink the bartender was a total jerk about the situation of my order. It wasn't that busy nor loud so I couldn't understand why he couldn't hear me. So I had to point. We asked suggestions for a shot and his statement was, \"I'm not a mixologist in making shots, however tequila is what I know.\"   No duh, you-idiot-who-I-pay-to-make-drinks!  Me: Fine, just give us our drinks and a couple shots of tequila. Seriously, our buzz was already gone after staying in the long ass line outside. (30 minute wait) Along with the wait at the bar (30 minutes) So an hour has passed and we still haven't even gotten drinks yet, we just placed the order. As we waited patiently, finally our drinks came and the bartender says, \"these are a bit strong so no tequila shots.\"   I was like, ok.........usually that means NO TIP! Someone telling me that I can't take a shot when we haven't even started drinking yet?! Oh heck no!!!!  This man had the nerve to say these drinks are really strong so just stick with the drinks. That's why you didn't get a tip!  Bad Service, No manners = No money for you!   The place is nice, alittle disneylandish/rainforest cafe. Crowd is alright. It would a be a nice starter bar if the wait line wasn't so long and the service wasn't so horribly slow or rude.  Would I come back? No, it's a one hit wonder bar.",

This place is hard to find, even if you have the exact address...maybe its one of those things where the fewer the people know about it....the better it is.

Just a black glass door, with 650 gough street written on it and in really small letters \"Smugglers Cove\".  Have been here only once, so dont remember the specific names of the cocktails i had.... they just have too many to choose from....and i had too many too...lol.  amazing ambiance, great music and the bartenders are reeeaaaally good. Really know their stuff. Went up to the bar and said \"its my first time here so what should I have?\" and both of them replied in unison - \"Forgot the name but it was just awesome!!!\"   Later, we ordered a bowl rum punch...was some sort of a pineapple blend. At every corner of the bowl there was a small cup with a super strong rum which was set on fire. We then started talking to the bartender about the drink and he suggested we have one of the cocktails with the super strong rum in it. This was a rum from Guinea in africa... \"f***ing\" brilliant cocktail. Must have had atleast 6-7 different cocktails there.",

A few of my college buddies and I were deciding between Smugglers and BnB, so we flipped a coin and Smugglers won.   The inside looks like Pirates of the Caribbean, and the blow fish lights, water pond, and tiki layout on the 3 floors added a nice touch.   Like I said, I don't like rum that much, but these rum drinks were very satisfying. Of the rum drinks, I tried the Zombie which is one of their strongest drinks and a train wreck waiting to happen if you pound 2 of these down. I also tried this other drink called the Naci something Hotel (Spanish Fail) and this was a good thirst quencher, even on a cold SF night.   I also ordered the Port Light, which was a whiskey drink mix. The taste was very palatable, and you could really feel the honey blending with the whiskey and egg whites.   The selection of rum was amazing for those who are rum connoisseurs. If you don't like rum, I still think you should give this place a try.

Great option if you want an extra-strong drink. The Zombie seems to be a go-to strong drink here, but it does not taste good.

    "review_text": "Tucked away behind an innocent looking door that looks sort of like an office building along any old street is a secret wonderland of tiki drinks and rum history.   Smuggler's Cove - what has to be one of the best bars possible if you want to try that pirate drink of choice - RUM!   They have a massive selection of rums that you probably never heard of and I'll personally make you walk the fucking plank if you dare mix those small batch bottles with coke. \u00a0  When you're hear expect to get crunked, because there's really no drink that is for the weak at heart and inexperienced in the liver.   You can attempt to join their Rum drinkers club called the Rumbustion, which gives you a passport and once you channel those old Pokemon skills and apply them towards tossing back rum and you collect them all, you'll be apart of the elite group of alcoholics.   The only downside is there's, like, 200 to drink to fully master the kung-fu skills of getting wasted. So perhaps you should pace yourself. You can do so with their regular pinky up tiki drinks. And let me lay one thing out right here and right now. I will bare knuckle fight anyone who dares say that a tiki drink isn't \"manly\",   There ain't no shame to drinking with one pinky up, homie. And I damn sure can tell you that a couple of those classics and their own signature tiki drinks will easily knock you out faster and more efficiently than my empty threat of bare knuckle boxing you.   Price tag on the drinks for the potency they're packing is really well. The only down side is that this place can get pretty packed, even with the three levels they have. It's an extremely interesting bar and given that it always makes the top list of Tiki bars to go to before you sail off to the afterlife, you should be making this a destination whenever you're in S.F.   They also have their own Tiki mugs for sale. A true sign that a tiki bar isn't messing around. It's also helpful to get one simply to help you remember what exactly happened when you wake up hung over from that pinky up drink.   Consider it a medal of honor that you tore it up tiki style.",

We say downstairs and it truly does feel like you are in a pirate ship. Fabulous.   Service: a bit different than I'm used to, but good. No cocktail waiters...you go up to the bar and put your order in and they call your name out for you to pick it up when it's ready. Unless you get a bowl of some sort...then they deliver the fiery goodness to your table (I wouldn't trust a drinking person with a huge flaming bowl of booze to walk across the bar either lol). Each drink is so detailed and includes fresh ingredients...so it takes a bit longer than usual to receive your drink but not enough to bother you.   Drinks: delicious! They have a HUGE menu of rum drinks...and only like 2 each of vodka, tequila and whiskey. I'm allergic to pineapple so that held me back a bit...but my friends had a great time enjoying the huge bowls. We even got something that came in a flaming boat. Super cool. I had a rum old fashioned and it was 100% delicious. A good option if you don't usually drink sweet drinks. It's a big jump from a vodka martini with two olives to a goblet of sweet fresh tropical juices, sweet rum, and with a fruit garnish as big as your head.  Overall, we had a blast! We were very lucky to get a table...it was packed even during the week. Also...it's not really a local scene...a bit of a tourist destination.  Cheers!",

They have an impressive list of straight rums, and the bartenders are awesome at recommending a mixed drink if you tell them what you like (ex: I like a somewhat sweet drink with NO pineapple - my drink was perfect!). I was only in San Francisco for a long weekend, and we went twice. That's how awesome this place is. The cocktails are a bit pricy, but this is San Francisco, and the bar has the awesome theme going for it.  That being said, there is a HUGE caveat, which is why this is only a 4 star review. I went on a Saturday and Sunday night, both around 8pm before going out elsewhere. Other reviewers have mentioned how incredibly crowded it can get, even having to wait outside, and I can definitely see that happening if you try to go here later in the evening. This place is SMALL. If you're looking for a place where you can sit down, talk, and enjoy a drink late in the evening, this probably isn't it.  If you're earlier, though, high recommend this place!",

I was told this was a themed tiki bar, and oh boy, yes, it certainly was. A friend of mine had been here in the past, and thought I would like it because I'm all about themes.  Three stories tall, this thin narrow building has a true tiki bar theme. The majority of the menu is rum drinks and they have probably close to a hundred different alcohols (again, mostly rum) available to choose from. It seemed that the main draw for larger groups were the \"fish bowl\" style drinks, which the bartenders light on fire as part of their show.  There's a bar on the lower floor, as well as the main floor, and this place gets busy pretty early. It's a pretty cool ambiance, but definitely different than a typical bar, which made it difficult for me to figure out what I wanted to order. I settled for a $9 Hawaiian Sunset which look to have a million different things in it, but it had vodka, so I was all in! Prices are a little on the higher side, but they do take a lot of care in concocting their libations. They do a lot of things by hand which you don't see in most bars.  Fun, little place. I'd visit again.",

    "review_text": "\"There's naught no doubt so much the spirit calms as rum and true religion.\"  -Lord Byron  I don't know much about the guy that said that, but I do know that my spirits have been calmed by the luscious libations I've imbibed at Smuggler's Cove. Some of my favorites include the Rum Flip, which is a luminous, frothy concoction reminiscent of eggnog with a light dusting of nutmeg; the Mary Pickford, which I believe is a combo of light rum and maraschino liqueur (made from cherry pits, which gives off a nutty marzipan-like flavor); and the Kona cocktail, that has you diving through a pearly passion fruit foam to swim in an elixir of Jamaican rum and honey. The menu offers so many tantalizing options, it's hard to choose.  These cocktails are complicated and worth waiting for. The prices average around $9-10 a drink, which may seem steep, but each ingredient is carefully chosen for it's quality. Juices are fresh and hand-squeezed, and syrups are also made by hand. Also, you won't know it because the flavors meld so amazingly well, but many of these classic cocktails contain up to 3-4 different kinds of rum in one glass and will pack quite a punch. Don't worry, you will get your money's worth.  Although the bar is small, it is never over-crowded inside, which allows for a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Here's a place where you can escape the banality of your humdrum life and feel like, for a brief moment, you've arrived in a mysterious and exotic locale. Which also means you may have to wait in line to experience all this amazement, but if you truly appreciate cocktails and rum lore, you will be duly rewarded for your patience.  -This review brought to you by Roget's Thesaurus",

You absolutely must get better music. \u00a0I don't know what you were playing, but it was dower. \u00a0I wanted Caribbean and rowdy New Orleans. I got Elevator and at best very tame New Orleans. \u00a0  2. Unless you're a wine bar, it's important that glasses are served full (unless you're serving a cocktail in a champagne flute, in which case, you follow the same rules as for champagne). \u00a0That's just for your own ethos at stake. \u00a0A cocktail may be well worth $11 dollars at 2.5oz but if you hand it to me in a 4 or 5oz glass it certainly looks like a rip off. \u00a0And that makes me have less fun!  Fill the glass or get different glass wear. \u00a0And it's surprising that I would have to go over that!",

About a month later I met some fellow yelpers here for a powwow. \u00a0I had ordered a 3 oz painkiller and watched to my horror as the lady bartender downstairs quickly measured three 1 oz measures of rum by keeping the measure under the flowing rum and dumping out about half the measure in to the tumbler counting each time \"One, two three\" as if by uttering this incantation it was going to magically multiply the amount of rum in the tumbler like Jesus blessing fish and loaves of bread. \u00a0Needless to say the drink came out pale and sickly sweet.  My friend and fellow yelper Keane in the mean time had aquired a 3 oz painkiller from the upstairs bartender and his was several shades darker and the flavors were well balanced.  I can no longer recommend this place as somewhere to get well crafted drinks with this level of inconsistency. \u00a0After all, I have a reputation to uphold. \u00a0I will return, but I will very carefully choose my bartender.

There are so many drinks on the menu that I always have a hard time deciding what to try again/next.   I have FIVE go to drinks:  1. They make the best most refreshingly orangey Sidewinder's Fang ANYWHERE. I never leave there without getting at least one.  2. The Rum Barrel is a large drink for thirsty types and I HIGHLY recommend spending a bit more to get it in the souvenir barrel mug(definitely an ebay money item if you ever get tired of it).   3. The Rum Flip is a velvety concoction of eggnog type tastiness served in a coupe glass.   4. The Hibiscus Cooler- beautiful color, a little lighter on the rum, and of course refreshing. It is served with an edible cured hibiscus flower. Yes, eat the garnish!  5. Classic Mai Tai- This is not the overly sweet pineapple stuff you may have swilled at a luau in Hawaii. This drink is finely balanced with sweet and tart and packs a punch with two different types of rum. Refreshing and potent. Always reliably delicious.  Beyond the highly stylized interior and chill ambiance, what you get at Smuggler's Cove is an immense well researched menu of classic cocktails and innovative creations that are expertly crafted and mixed.

Having been birthed by the folks behind the kitschy Forbidden Island in Alameda, I was surprised to see a grown up version with all the fun stripped out. It's like the pirate's decorated after they scored their booty and hired a interior decorator from Pier One. Very well, though. I didn't come here to look around, I came here to drink blind.   We dove into the weeknight crowd, bellied up to the small bar and were met by the paradox of choice: the bottles gleamed on the endless shelves, every possible rum concoction with liquors we had to Wikipedia decorated the pages. Being that rum is straight crazy to my mainline, I opted for a gin-based drink from the festively-dressed barkeep and attempted a seat. Downstairs, a cozy seating area with a wallfountain from it's previous incarnation, Jade. Upstairs, who knows, I couldn't make my way through the crowd.  We waited, and waited. And finally received our delightful little coup glasses. Ready for the travesty? I've been twice and I don't remember a single drink I enjoyed. I know what you're thinking, I got blotto and forgot everything. Oh no, because you know how drunk recollections work, right? It all comes back when you're tipsy again. Well, in my inebriated states following, when people were touting its merits, I plumb had nothing to say. I know, I'm going to have to walk the plank for this one.",

From the outside it just looks like an old building with pitch black windows, but as soon as you open the door it's like you were transported to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland. This pirate themed bar is super cool with a mini pond/lagoon, barrels and crates as tables, and two bars one upstairs and one on the lower level.   My friends and I came around 8pm on a Friday night and it was so crowded that the bouncer had us wait outside for a few minutes until people left because the bar had reached capacity. All the table seating was taken but we really wanted to try the volcano drink so we waited around until we were able to snatch a table in the back corner. Of course the table had no chairs because these other chicks took like ten chairs to put around one tiny ass table. So we ordered our volcano and the bartender presented it with cinnamon and a torch to make like a fireball out of the Flames coming out of the cup. The menu said it feeds four but I think two people could've killed it easily. The drink itself was really good. My boyfriend ordered the dirty bastard which tasted like alcoholic ginger ale (really good), and we also got the rum barrel and were able to take the cup home! Super cute souvineer.   This bar has an amazing atmosphere and delicious drinks, I would definitely come back.",

    "review_text": "I have fallen in love. With rum.  I used to like only holding hands with rum, but that's probably because until recently I had never really savored good rum. \u00a0If my then-roommates and I could afford it to mix with our egg nog at the Christmas parties we threw in our early 20's, it probably wasn't of the highest quality. \u00a0But GOOD rum? \u00a0Oh, my.  And what better place to enjoy good rum than Smuggler's Cove? \u00a0They do one thing at Smugglers Cove that normally annoys me to no end, but there it works. \u00a0I have been two times now... on a Friday about a week after they opened in December and just this past Saturday. \u00a0Being weekend nights both times, there was a line out front. \u00a0Now, I never, ever, EVER wait in line to get into a bar, but Smuggler's Cove is different. \u00a0For one thing, both times the guy at the door (perhaps it is was the same gentleman on both occasions) couldn't have been nicer. \u00a0He often thanked those of us in line for our patience and apologized for the wait. \u00a0He also handed out menus, should we want to pick our drinks before getting in.  The real reward, however, came when we walked into the bar. \u00a0I officially lost patience a few years ago for bars so crowded you can barely move or breathe, so I really appreciate the capacity control they do at Smugglers Cove. \u00a0Seriously.  The wait for drinks also can be long; it certainly has been on both occasions I've visited. \u00a0However, once again, the staff made up for the wait with excellent customer service. \u00a0The same bartender was working downstairs both times, and she... while working her ass off making complicated cocktails... took the time to look up and, again, thank me for my patience and apologize for the wait. \u00a0The same with the bar back on Saturday night. \u00a0They both easily could have stressed out and thrown a bunch of attitude at me and the other customers, but they didn't. \u00a0It was quite a different experience than I had at another trendy bar in the City that specializes in complicated cocktails. \u00a0This could have been a four-star review, but the staff kicked it up to five.  (By the way, I see from other reviews here that some people have had bad experiences with the staff at Smugglers Cove, but my interactions with them have been lovely.)  Now we get to the main event: the cocktails. \u00a0They are well worth the wait. \u00a0Like I said, I have developed a new appreciation for rum, and it's because I finally tasted really decent rum. \u00a0In December we were sipping rum straight, and it was just delicious. \u00a0The fancy cocktails also are yummy and up to the standards set (in my book) by Tiki Ti in Los Angeles, which I also have reviewed, and La Mariana Sailing Club in Honolulu.  I truly don't understand why I don't go to Smugglers Cove all the time, but I will have to rectify that.",

    "review_text": "Another fantastic addition to my \"SF Cocktails\" list. \u00a0So excited to finally get here.  The place is owned by the same folks that brought you Forbidden Island in Alameda, which is mainly what had me so excited to go. \u00a0(In fact, Martin can often be seen hanging around in a Hawaiian shirt, &amp; on the night I was there, was happy to chat about some of the cocktails &amp; their odd ingredients.) \u00a0It was built into the old Jade Bar space, but the inside has been completely redone so that it now bears an eerie resemblance to the Tartuga set from Pirates of the Caribbean (think thick rope, aging wooden beams, Pirate chests, ship anchors, etc.).  The cocktail menu is gargantuan - there are probably over a 100, ranging from traditional favorites to intriguing new inventions. \u00a0In my few visits, I've had a ton of quite tasty drinks that pretty much run the gambit in terms of tiki-style cocktails, so I won't bore you with the details. \u00a0Read the menu, and if you like everything listed in a given drink, it'll probably be really good.  Sadly, the place is a little small and probably only holds around 100 people on three levels (a sizeable downstairs area with a bar and a good amount of seating, the smaller entry level with a bar and a few bar stools, and a tiny upstairs area overlooking the entry level with just seating). \u00a0On the up side, the doorman does a good job of keeping it from getting too crowded. \u00a0On the down side, this means that on a weekend, you might end up waiting for 10-20 minutes to get in.  I've read a few reviews complaining about slow service, which can be an issue of the place is crowded. \u00a0The entry-level bar is really only big enough for one tender, and the downstairs bar generally has one or two as well. \u00a0Add to that the size of the cocktail menu and the complexity of the drinks these folks are making, though, and it should be obvious why the wait can be a bit long at times. \u00a0However, I'd argue that a sophisticated, well-made cocktail is absolutely worth it; you're best served by gauging how busy things are when you get half to two thirds of the way through your drink and deciding whether it seems prudent to go ahead and get your next order in. \u00a0A little planning goes a long way in that respect.  On top of all that, they also do a kind of cocktail tasting club. \u00a0You can get a sheet from the bartender listing all the drinks &amp; have the 'tender sign off each one as you have it, and there seem to be fancy prizes for those who fill up the sheet. \u00a0There's a similar club built around tasting all their rums, which are numerous &amp; tasty. \u00a0(Did I mention that they do tasting flights as well?)  Great work, Martin! \u00a0Always worth a stop in.",

    "review_text": "As a friend said it so eloquently, welcome to Disneyland!!  If Smugglers Cove is good at one thing, that would be marketing. \u00a0From the beginning, with the months of PR around the clues to its secret location, to the custom mugs (yours for the taking with purchase of a $20 drink), to the check-off lists for going round-the-world and trying each of their rums or rum-based drinks - clearly they know how to market.   Could I easily bash this and say it sucks? \u00a0Sure. But truth be told, I had a good time. \u00a0The drinks weren't awful, the d\u00e9cor was nice, and the people running it sure care more about having a fun place to go than most of the trendy clubs in SF. \u00a0I'd much rather pay $10 for an interesting tiki drink than $10 for a gin and tonic. And the drinks were 200% better than the Tonga Room.   Will I make it my new hangout? I doubt it. \u00a0But I wouldn't discourage people to go and try it out - especially if you're into rum.   There is however one big complaint. \u00a0Most fine cocktail joints in the city are now using precise measuring for their drinks. \u00a0I'm generally OK with this when the cocktail needs to stick with some close measurements to keep its balance. \u00a0 I do the same when I'm making many drink recipes at home. However, what I didn't like seeing was the bar tender getting rushed and under pouring the jigger in haste. \u00a0To make things worse they were using lots of small ice and then when the drink was short, just adding lots more ice. \u00a0I really felt as if I was getting ripped off on some pretty watered down cocktails. \u00a0What was worse, was the use of exact measurements, then the use of tons of soda water - why first measure everything, only to be totally inconsistent with the amount of watery ice and soda water? \u00a0They were also measuring when people simply got their rum neat - always a turnoff to me.",

The crowd in line is mostly white, everyone is dressed down, seems like a young crowd, like freshly 21.   We get in, place is busy, we go downstairs to see that it is packed, so we head back upstairs to get a drink. There are a lot of people that is surrounding the tiny bar, btw, one bartender. So we take our turn, look at a menu, and get cash out so if she looks our way, we can quick order. So the menu is packed with fancy complicated drinks.   20 minutes later. Still no drink, some creepy drunk old man is talking us up.....great. finally he leaves, another old fat man sitting at the bar asks if we want a drink, we tell him we're still working on that, but she's just so busy, he said that we just need to be aggressive. He asks us what we want, we explain we want something smooth but not super strong, it is a wednesday night after all. He says the menu has plenty of smooth, mild drinks. But for $15 a drink, I don't want a fucking mild drink, it better knock me on my ass! So he told us to go somewhere else and that Smugglers Cove isn't meant for the cheap.

We met at 8PM for drinks one night, which is evidently early for this place. Got a bunch of seats upstairs, though I'm told the downstairs grotto is cooler. I'm wondering if it just makes people need to pee a lot though. \u00a0The environment is nice. A little too dark for me. Umm...someone turn up a light? I don't need glaring, but I can't read the bloody menu!   First drink I had was a painkiller. It comes in 2, 3, or 4 shots. I got 3 because the bartender recommended that...should have gotten 4. *sigh. Oh, well, they get a few more bucks off me.   The drink I liked the most was their dry float. I can't pronounce the first word. I call it a dry float. It comes \"with a side of danger\" and actually came WITH a side of another alcohol. Not sure if it's actually dangerous, but it was delicious. DELICIOUS.   This place seems like another one for the young drunks. When I sat down, my friends already saved seats from the last group to leave. Young blonde chick comes by multiple times to look for her jacket and bag. She touches ALL OF OUR STUFF digging around. Umm...I don't want your crap. If I saw it, I'd shove it at you. Not once, but THREE TIMES she comes back upstairs to look in our drinking area. The 3rd time, she lifted up my bag and threw my friends' jackets on the other chair...just looking for her shit. Definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results. Insane girl. Her bag?? Yeah, one of her friends had it. Thanks douche, if you just told this chick earlier she wouldn't have her grubby hands all over our stuff!  Supposedly they have the largest selection of rum on this side of the Mississippi. Or...in the USA. No idea. But its a large selection of rum.",

There are 3 floors. The bottom floor is miserable because it is hot, crowded, and poorly situated. The bar is at the end of the narrow room and everyone is trying to get to it. There are 2 poor slow bartenders making elaborate drinks that take a very long time, and meanwhile there are barbacks constantly pushing past you with buckets of nasty water. It took at least 30 minutes to order a drink at that bar. The middle floor is also tiny, but more open. There are a few barstools around a bar, and you'll probably have better luck ordering there, even though you'll probably be unable to land a seat. Upstairs there's a little mezzanine area where private parties can sit around tables. If you are planning any type of gathering involving more than 1 other person, try to get up there.",

The ambience was relaxed, trendy, and casual and the crowd was a mix of people of all walks of life. The pirate ship theme was neat in the context that it wasn't overdone or cheesy. My girlfriend is not much of a rum drinker, but the bartenders were patient and more than willing to help her find a cocktail that would suit her preferences. Having lived in Haiti and spent a solid amount of time in the Dominican Republic, I longed for the simultaneously sweet, smooth, and strong Caribbean rum that is nearly impossible to find in the U.S. I highly recommend a Ron Barcelo Imperial on the rocks to anybody that is coming here to try different types of rum. The bartenders masterfully crafted my girlfriends cocktail, throwing out several garnishes before finding the one that best fit the visual of the drink. Will definitely be returning here!",

The place isn't really that big so it gets crowded and might be hard to find seating. \u00a0They have a bar on the first and lower floors. \u00a0The upper floor is just seating. \u00a0The lower floor has tables you can grab if you have a bigger group. \u00a0I wouldn't suggest having more than 6 people in your party. \u00a02-4 is probably more ideal imho.  Drinks-wise they mostly do rum based drinks, but do have the other stuff. \u00a0Pretty much everything is good. \u00a0Just read the descriptions and choose what you're in the mood for. \u00a0If it says it's got milk or coconut creme, it'll be kinda rich. \u00a0If it's got pineapple juice, it'll probably be sweet, etc. \u00a0The little Rum Barrel by drinks mean they're deceptively strong (yum). \u00a0It's pretty amazing to watch the bartenders at work. \u00a0Each drink is a whole process so appreciate it! \u00a0The presentation for some of the drinks are also elaborate. \u00a0I believe there's one that's to share that actually has fire in it. \u00a0You can also get some signature drinks and leave with a little cup souvenir. \u00a0It can take a while to get up to the bar and get your next order in when it's busy so plan ahead if you're nearing the end of your drink and might want another.  If you are a true connoisseur I believe they have a separate menu that's just aged rums. \u00a0I haven't tried this out, but I'm perfectly happy with the drinks they make. \u00a0Overall very fun, chill place. \u00a0Love coming here.",

    "review_text": "This place definitely wins points for the cool decor and unique spin on things!  From a bartender's POV:  When you go to an Irish pub, you always know what to expect: Dark atmosphere, some Guinness on tap, and with some luck- a lively and outgoing crowd. When you approach the sign-less building marked with only a red light and a green light surrounding the entrance, you definitely don't know what in the name of Hey-seuss awaits you...It's the freakin Black Pearl! Very cool.  The crowd seems to be sort of a tame, mid-30's group of folks. The bartenders seem really cool, and have passion for their drink-making, which is awesome!  Here's the trouble:  1) You're gonna wait outside in line at least 15-20 minutes even if you get there early (9PM) on a Friday night.  2) When you get inside, you can't believe how small the quarters are. Seriously, I'm not picky, but this is exactly like going to see a Metallica show right when the band gets on stage, and everyone squishes together, making it impossible to move. The band in this case is the bar. The intoxicators pouring all those rum drinks are the super heroes, and for good reason, man! To hang around in this cramped bar, you need some drinks!  3) Although the drinks are really cool-looking and use very creative ingredients, they're not going to impress most people. BUT! Given the fact that you just paid $15 for a cocktail, you almost feel like you have to lie and say it's the most amazing Rum drink you ever had.  4) These are high-end gourmet drinks, and they take time to make. Considering the lines to get into the building, and then to the bar are so long, you sadly will be waiting a long time for a drink. I dragged my friends here, and understandably, they were pretty grumpy by the time our drinks when in our hands. When you have to wait an hour to get your first drink, you're bound to not give a place 5 stars ;-)  Yes, it is a long shopping list of time-related complaints, but the drinks and cool decor help make up for it.  Bottom line: Would probably be awesome on a Tuesday night when the wait for a drink is less than an hour. I personally would go somewhere else on a Friday or Saturday night, so you can party with your crew, rather than wait in lines. Oh, and the Smuggler's Barrel is pretty tasty! (Doh!

Depending on how crowded it is, you might have to wait a bit for a drink, but they are worth the wait. My favs are the Hibiscus punch and Kona Cocktail....I mean, who doesn't love fruit or flowers in their drink? AND you will see guys drinking with either fruit or flowers in their drink, so props to them for owning it!

The menu is huge; there are mostly rum cocktails ranging from the historical \u00a0to the classic, along with a variety of new creations and the typical tiki- tropical fruit and sugar-syrup drinks. Wanting to avoid the latter, I read the ingredients carefully and ordered the \"corn and oil \" cocktail from Barbados . There wasn't any corn or oil in it, and there was no added sugar or chemically-tasting mixers in it . It was just pure dark rum and some kind of Caribbean liquor. \u00a0It wasn't cheap, because the rum used wasn't cheap. It was EXTREMELY strong. \u00a0We were able to get our drinks quickly, which was surprising considering how packed it was. The crowd was actually very friendly and nice. No attitude or rudeness here. Definately not like similar bars catering to the same age group in LA or Santa Barbara. \u00a0It was fun, and we'll be back.

It's a pirate bar. Don't try to make it something its not- i.e., a regular bar, a dive bar, a gathering place.  6. Don't come here at happy hour. Either get here extremely early, or extremely late.  7. Don't tell all your friends about it- especially ones prone to doing 1-6. Telling more people increases your wait time.   On the other hand, it's a pirate themed bar. It's like you get to drink while on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland- without Disneyland!

By the time we left, music was playing very softly, but you really had to put your ear up to the speakers to hear it. Kind of weird to be in a bar with no music.  As for drinks, they do have a lot of cool options. I don't like really sugary drinks so I got a mojito, which was good and strong, but not too strong. The other people I was with got sugary drinks, which were extremely strong, which is good if you want to get drunk, but they tasted terrible.

The first obvious comparisons to this place are those throwbacks of tiki yesteryear like the nearby Tonga Room and Trader Vics, the key difference being that his place is pretty tiny compared to those venerable bastions of giant electric blue libations. \u00a0I suppose this place feels a little more nautical and YARRR!! appointed compared to those two, and theme is generally a lot more evident on a moment-to-moment basis because of the size of the space. \u00a0The drinks are also very comparable: scorpions, zombies and rum punches are all well-prepared, giant, sugary and ineffective - one double of your favorite hard stuff will wreck you a lot quicker than anything you'll consume in here (your size depending!)  I'd recommend trying the Puka Punch as it has about a billion different rums mixed in and tastes pretty good. \u00a0If you've got a big group of people then proceed straight to the Scorpion because other wise I think you're missing the whole point of coming to a place like this (plus lots of really long straws, flames, awkward angles to sip and sugary booze is a guaranteed recipe to fun!)",

I gave Smuggler's Cove 5 stars in my initial review; after visiting a few more times, it deserves plenty more stars than that. This is one of the best bars in the Bay, let alone one of the the best tiki lounges!  I came with my bestie and our night unfortunately started on a sour note. We drove ALL the way to SF and snatched a nearby parking spot only to find out as we approached the line that my friend forgot her ID. Womp womp. The bouncer, Carlos, was super cool and awesome. Nah, he didn't let us in anyway (that's illegal, y'all!). He told us if we came back (with her ID), we can skip to the front and he'll let us in. So that's what we did. Yup, we drove ALL the way back to the East Bay and then ALL the way back to the city because that is how mesmerizing Smuggler's Cove is. We walked to the front of the line, Carlos was surprised we actually did return but as promised, he let us in, handed us a menu and directed us to the bottom floor (there are 3 floors) to order our drinks because the bar down there was not as crowded. Totally helpful and charming! When we returned to the ground floor with our drinks, he informed us a big party just left on the top floor (mezzanine) so we walked up the stairs and found lots of sitting room. He also suggested some great drinks!   Smuggler's Cove is cozy and hip with a dash of Caribbean magic. The bartenders and drinks are excellent--full of character, delight and spirit! Yes, it's tiny and packed but that just adds to the fun and lively atmosphere.   Here are a few tips/highlights for y'all:  - Parking is relatively easy to find along McAllister. However, the area is somewhat shady. - Be prepared for a long line. The venue is small (maximum capacity of 50ish people). There was a line at 8:30pm on a Friday night. What?!  - Tantalizing drinks with fruity and exotic flavors like the Batida and Painkiller (for the coconut lovers), and enough alcohol to give you a nice buzz. I also recommend the hibiscus rum punch.  - Chat with the bartenders; they are quite entertaining and hilarious.  - Enjoy being transported to a tropical paradise! (Sometimes with real pirates!...OK, there was a birthday party where everyone dressed up in pirate costumes. Legit.)   Argh matey!",

Not only do they have some amazing knowledge of rum, but they really know how to put the kick in their deceivingly-fruity drinks.

Those of you who know me that I'm usually a tank, so that just goes to show how strong those drinks are. Oh, by the way, one of them had an umbrella in my drink.

On a positive note, after one stiff cocktail you wont notice this stink. Drink up!   The downstairs has poor acoustics causing it to be loud and echoy.

I was thinking ok, we shouldn't be in line for longer than 30 mins max. Well, I was VERY wrong. It took us ONE hour to get in (more than I've ever waited in line at a club/bar in my LIFE.) It wasn't so bad if the bouncer was nice or reasonable, but he threw a bunch of F-bombs at us because my friend said \"wow, really?\" when he tried to split our group into 3 when he originally said it would be 2 groups (5 and 7) of us.   When we FINALLY got into the bar (a little after 11:30 pm), we tried to order our drinks. One of my friends ordered the Scorpion, and the bouncer kept asking us sarcastically if we had a PHYSICAL table - I'm not kidding, he must've asked us FIVE times. OF COURSE we had a table - why would we order such a huge drink if we didn't? We even had to get our friend to wave at the bartender downstairs to PROVE that we had a table.   I left shortly after, but I heard they were even more rude to my friends after that. Sure, some places have bad service, but how can you swear and threaten your customers?   WILL NEVER GO BACK.",

Come early, cuz it can be difficult to find a table especially if you want to try one of those bowls you drink out with a really long straw with your friends. Parking is plenty in this residential neighborhood. Just be careful and lock your stuff because it's close to the projects. Bouncer can be a bit rude, just cooperate. Ambience is loud and dark, decorated like a ship with a water fountain in the lower level. Great place to come with friends.",

We had a chance to sample five drinks this day:  In no particular order:  England's Dreaming (By Christine England): A fantastic combination of Passion fruit, cinnamon, rum and chocolate mole bitters! I love their use of mole bitters, and the drink was \"off the chain\"! Everyone in our group agreed it was fantastic, and I personally thought it was great.  Apocalypse (By Alex Smith): The name suits the potency, and this drink is not to be taken lightly. It's power is surpassed only by it's deliciousness; a deadly combination. Using Orgeat, Licor43, campari, rum and gin, Alex has created a delicious island combination worthy of being served in Martin's exquisitely prepared vessals. Hands down AMAZING.  Polynesian Paralysis (Circa 1960): A very spiritous cocktail, containing bourbon, orgeat, demerara sugar, and bourbon. Yummy, and it definitely tasted better once you got halfway done with it.  Mastodon (By Alex Smith): This drink is not on the menu, we were lucky enough to have tablemates who were well versed in the capabilities of our bartender. It's a combination of bourbon, marashino liqueur, rum, and a bit of pixie dust, made whole on the canvas of our Pineapple. Yummy, but very spiritous. I liked it, but as our companions said \"it'll put some hair on your chest\".  Batida de maracuja e coco: Yummy! :D. Cachaca, condensed milk, and coconut milk, and maracuja (passion fruit) and we had the privilege of having it served in a pineapple!  All in all a great day at the cove, I STRONGLY suggest attending the next Domingo de Pina, it's a great time out.  TL;DR: Cool spot, potent drinks, sundays of the pineapple rock, check it out.",

Every bartender is absolutely phenomenal and manages to make long series of ridiculously complex cocktails for twenty different people and they'll still manage to call you by your first name when they finish your drink. If that weren't enough, the drinks themselves are the best I have had anywhere, and this coming from a guy that travels to a different state every week and spends unreasonable amounts of money on alcohol in each of them. I'm not just talking about the taste either... I have walked out of this place completely bombed on several occasions and have yet to wake up with a hangover. The ingredients are all such high quality and the recipes so wonderfully put together that you can drink and drink and drink and never worry about waking up near death the next day.   This place is perpetually crowded (and deservedly so) but the vibe remains completely chill and the drinks remain accessible. The pirate theme is done to the extreme and perfectly so, and even when there is a line out there the door, it never gets too hard to find a spot for you and your friends to enjoy the best drinks in San Francisco... And probably anywhere else, for that matter.   I visit this place every chance I get and drag anyone uninitiated through its (incredibly low-key, borderline sketchy-looking) door several times a week if I can help it. You can expect to pay a bit more than you might at a less special bar, but It is so completely worth it. Five out of five hardly seems sufficient to express my love for the place, \u00a0but that is all Yelp will let me give it.",

So indeed, even though there were only a few people in front of us, it still took about 30 minutes to get in.   The interior is really neat, totally pirate cove. The place is really small, hence the limited capacity. The drink menu is impressive, as is the assortment of fun rums to be had.   Drinks are made very carefully, and cost about $12 each. They tasted great, HOWEVER....I did notice that most if not all the drinks that were being made were topped off with crushed ice. So like, after they shake the drink and pour into the glass, the glass was not filled up, so it is topped off with crushed ice to give the illusion that the cup is full. The skull bowl party drink was practically all ice. filled with ice cubes, some booze thrown in there, and then topped off with a mountain of crushed ice. Maybe this would be cool if drinks were like $9 or $10, but when I am paying $12 plus tip for these things, I would like more booze and less ice.   Anyways, enough of that, this place is cool, fun to go with friends, but not really a good intimate date spot.   I will go back in a couple weeks to see if they have ironed out the wrinkles...",

What's equally as impressive, is the cocktail menu! First of all, it looks like a treasure map and it gives you a brief history about the drinks that they offer. After reading the menu from cover to cover, we decided to get a scorpion bowl - if you've been to Trad'r Sams or other tiki bars, you're familiar with this, but if you're not, it's a bowl filled with rum, gin, orange and lime - and it was tasty! But beware, it'll get ya.   This is such a fun place to go with friends. They have an upstairs area perfect for lounging and talking, and the main floor and downstairs area have bars and seating. It's a really fun place, and even though the projects are pretty much across the street, I would come here again.

When you first enter from the street, it will take a minute for your eyes to adjust to the dark. \u00a0We always head down the stairs to order a drink and try and snag any spot to sit. \u00a0The menu is extensive, so if you are unsure, just tell the bartender what you like and they will make a cocktail you are sure to love! \u00a0Mine is the Batida, which may be light on alcohol, but delicious in flavor. \u00a0Don't worry though, there are plenty of other drinks that will knock your socks off in alcohol content, for example, Painkiller has options of strength. \u00a0And the hot buttered rum is such a warm and cozy drink, you will wish you were curled up by a crackling fireplace. (Oh sorry, fireplace is not included!)  Last time we went, the bouncer was explaining to the random chick outside that this is not a place where you go to get hit on. \u00a0I wholeheartedly agree! \u00a0Come with a couple of friends, and make new friends with whomever you end up next too. \u00a0There may be a wait for your drink, especially on a busy night, but it is worth it. \u00a0It can get loud, alcohol usually has that effect. \u00a0Cheers!",

The bartenders are skilled in making the 70 some odd \"specialty drinks\" and they make it with speed and precision.   Here are the drinks I tried, so far... - Trade Winds, loved it! - Banana Daiquiri, love, loved it - its' so far from the standard and that is why I love it. Smooth, lime kick and elegant (not your little smoothie cocktail) - Pain Killer, loved it! - Mai Tai, good but I love the fun one's I have never heard of now... - Mojito, again, good but if you come here try something NEW! - Port Au Prince, FUN - Puka Punch - great bang for your buck and tasty - Mary Pickford, taste kinda like it sounds - sour  - Aku Aku, yummy! - Pupule, ah, I know I tried this but I can't remember - Zombie, this is a strong one...as the name indicates  It's easy to just come here, close your eyes, and point at any item on the drink list and be impressed and surprised. \u00a0I've been to Smugglers 6 times and I still like going.

They aren't a Trader Vic's but the Bartenders and the staff hold it down well enough to provide good drink and a great atmosphere.  Try the Zombie it'll get you effed up!  I would really love to give this place 5 stars or more but the size of the place can be a downer if you go with a large crowd. On the upside if you like the Pirates of the Caribbean you're in luck.

Glad it's reopened, since the underground section of this small bar is very charming and boasts a large fountain which cascades behind the stairs as you walk down.   The upstairs men's bathroom used to have a two-way mirror, which let you see through the bar (is my girlfriend flirting with that guy or is she blowing him off???). Terrible shame on the new owners for removing this fun accent.   Upstairs mezzanine is also very nice, a bit more private.   Nonetheless, Smuggler's Cove resembles Disney's Pirate's of The Caribbean ride, and though the decor is a bit cartooney the selection is very decent (they even offer a program similar to Tommy's Restaurant where you can sample Rum --will update on the quality of the education and selection once I finish it)   So check it out.

It's a small space filled with lots of people during peak hours, but what it lacks in space, Smuggler's Cove makes up in pirate atmosphere &amp; drinks. The bartenders here really know how to make rum cocktails, punch bowls, and quickly too, a stark contrast to their speakeasy counterparts.  Since I tend to drink vodka &amp; gin, I don't know my rum besides Captain Mo' so to my amusement when some naive patron asked what rum they used in their cocktails, \"Pusser's Rum of course!\" was chimed. Drinks here are strong and the selection is a bit overwhelming since your range of options come in a large binder (75 drinks!!).   To keep it short, if you're in a group you should definitely try one of their scorpion bowls or preferably any drink that gets lit up on fire as they're served. The Top Notch Volcano is a pretty popular one to get.   If you want something for yourself, try the Painkiller instead, it's an easy drink to chill on.  Best time to come by is after work before 8pm, there's lines even on Wednesday nights due to their increasing popularity.",

And I've had one too many experiences where Jade was a drunken clusterf---- that I'm happy for the breathing room. Ask to go over the drink menu while waiting in line because trust me, it'll take a long time to decide what to order (each drink includes details on its origin, what version recipe they're using, as well as what's in it), and even longer to actually get it.   They've blacked out the glass with really dark tint to keep the light out, the waterfall is gone, one-way glass is gone in favor of more bar shelving, and it's all about rock formations along the walls and huge primary colored globe-lights bound in rope netting. As a girl I felt like I ought to have come with a large white flower tucked in my hair.   The bartenders are friendly but distracted. They are still trying to learn the labor-intensive recipes and it's a huge elbow-bumping fest behind their small bar counter. Hopefully their turnaround time improves with experience.   The drinks are gorgeous and average $10 each. The owner really put a lot of effort into everything from decor, fresh juice squeezed daily, an exclusive rum from St. George's, frothy egg whites, to the individually hand-blown glasses that the punch is served in (a credit card deposit is required for the bowl).   Now, I'm not a person that was ever a particular fan of tiki bars, but this one brings the experience to a whole new level of fun without the cheesy campiness.   FANNED.",

You know, like bars USED to be. And yes, that means you can actually hear yourself talk there instead of just being drowned out by some overbearing bass beat. There is music playing ranging from exotica to lounge to other vintage styles, but it is meant as background atmosphere and not a replacement to conversation. This, I love! If I want to be drowned out by music, I'll go to a dance club.  This new bar specializes in rum drinks: Cuban, Caribbean and Tiki, but they also have a few other things on the menu too. The prices are not dirt cheap, but really no more than many other bars that can't make a cocktail half as good. The menu is fun to read and you can keep track of what drinks you've tried with a little \"drink map\" they will give you.  I preferred to avoid the peak hour lines and go early (around 5-7pm). Also, since it just opened and every hipster and their dog are trying it out, have some patience if you do come later as there can be a line or a wait for your well-crafted drink.

Once inside my friends and headed to the downstairs bar and stood obediently waiting to order our drinks. \u00a0I was totally cool waiting to order \u00a0- there was a big group at the other end of the bar getting flaming skull drinks and shots so I just waited my turn.  When I finally did get to order, I told the bartender we were going to step out of the way and we'd come back up to claim our drinks when they were ready. \u00a0I was trying to get out of the way of the big party AND understood that since my friends and I ordered 4 cocktails it might take a while.  I went up to the bar about every 5 minutes to check and I saw no sign of our drinks. \u00a0Finally after 15 minutes I decided to stay parked at the bar thinking maybe if she saw me there she would start making them. I realize she was busy but the bar didn't seem all that crowded and quite frankly, the bartender looked lost, confused, and overwhelmed - she was not gracious and didn't really interact with any of her clientele.   I very rarely write bad yelp reviews because i think its obnoxious but it took 45 minutes to get our drinks. \u00a0As someone who works in the service industry I was genuinely surprised that the bartender didn't offer some sort of apology for such a long wait. \u00a0As I said, I'm patient, but I'd like just a little acknowledgment of how ridiculous it is to wait 45 minutes for a cocktail.  The drink I had was delicious so I can't write this place off completely! \u00a0I think next time I'll go on a Monday...",

Unless you're in a wheelchair. Like too many SF venues, this is a tall narrow building with no elevator. The ground floor is almost all bar, and there's one tiny wheelie-height ledge (not a table, one of those kinda-bar shelves). If you wanted to hang out with friends here, forget it - you're gonna be sulking at the base of the stairs with your very tasty drink and maybe one or two other people crammed in next to you. If there's a bathroom on this floor, I didn't see it.   Everyone else: get there early or go on a weeknight as it gets crowded. Don't expect dancing or music, or food. Don't bring a huge group - this place is kinda tiny.   If you want a tiki bar, head for the Tonga Room, the Outers (Trad'r Sam) or Alameda's Forbidden Island, all of which are bigger and can handle a wheelchair that wants to be with some friends. Likewise, you can get awesome cocktails (tiki or not) elsewhere. If all you're doing is stopping in for a quick drink on your way somewhere else, it's worth a try. The drinks really were awesome, but if all I want is a great cocktail, I can go someplace with a table. Sorry, tiki pirates.",

I've been going here on/off for over a year and I think I've tried maybe 10 drinks out of a menu that is so large I don't know how people get through it all. But they do and they win prizes. The best part of the drinks is that all the juices are fresh squeezed here and the rum selection is insane. Ambiance is very old pirate ship, including a small lagoon on the bottom floor with netting. And the walls are planks. The only downside is that service can be very slow. I recommend going on an off-night like a Tuesday. Cheers!",

This place is a treasure chest of strong delicious drinks from exotic faraway islands. (They seem to specialize in rum.) \u00a0Dark, dim and mysterious. (Imagine \"Pirates of the Carribean.\") This place is cute, clean, tasteful and cozy without the lecherous smelly pirates. \u00a03 bars on 3 different floors -- we chose to stay in the bowels of the ship. (We didn't experience the slow-service that other people mentioned. And we had enough comfort space between us and the other \"drinkers.\")  First Round: (By the time I arrived, my girlfriends already finished their first round.)  Second Round: - AKU-AKU: Lighter and perfect for someone like me who can't really hold her alcohol. It was a delicious drink made with lime, pineapple, peach liqueur and Silver Reserve rum.  - PORT AU PRINCE: Made with Haitian Rum, lime, pineapple, falernum, bitter and grenadine. Nice and strong.  Third Round: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/15g05u3vgH1CZipI1eIeUA?select=L2o6tfO9sygFv1vpzFJ5fQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/15g0\u2026</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/15g05u3vgH1CZipI1eIeUA?select=-koNcsBLEQpzoah07vvpIA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/15g0\u2026</a>  -THE VOLCANO!: This definitely sealed our girlfriendship for the evening. Perfect because it serves 4. This drink could put one (or four) in a trance. Served to us in a blue skull with a burning fire in the middle. A strong concoction of pineapple, lime, passionfruit, maraschino liqueur and Private Reserve rum. The fire was created by soaking a marshmallow in alcohol. A fun drink with a price tag of $32! (Most drinks are in the $9 to $10 price range. Quite expensive but yummy and strong!)  Smuggler's Cove spells fun and good times at a place that's decent and not bawdy! I want to go back with my girls to smuggle some more after-work girl-bonding moments over yummy drinks!  Too bad, no food available and allowed. :(",

The drinks are definitely something else. \u00a0Many choices, and each one has its own little story in the menu. \u00a0Most creative drinks I've ever seen. \u00a0I watched the waitress as she was making mine and she had to have grabbed at least 6-7 different unlabeled concoctions of who knows what to make my beverage. \u00a0And it was delicious! \u00a0Strongly recommend checking out this place.",

I went after work on a Friday... got there around 5:45 and can imagine how CROWDED that tight little space can be on the weekends. The downstairs section seemed hot and I agree with another reviewer they could improve their ventilation down there.   Also, the drinks took FOREVER. I completely understand that the drinks are complicated and require a lot of ingredients but good GRIEF I spent more time in line waiting for a drink than actually enjoying my drink. I only had 2 drinks (this is really shocking if you knew me) as the bartenders seemed stressed/frazzled and I felt bad for them. Not sure what they can do to improve that, the bar is so teeny and there isn't enough room for 2 bartenders.   BUT- - - it's a PIRATE BAR, I will def be back!! (just not on a Fri or Sat).",

    "review_text": "First of all I want to correct several misstatements by other reviewers:  - This is not a \"pirate\" bar! There's not a Jolly Roger, tricorne hat, eye patch, or stuffed parrot to be found! It's a \"Nautical Rum Bar\" people!  - Several reviewers mentioned the lack of music. There is music, but it's kept at a reasonable level so that the patrons can have actual conversations. And the music is appropriate for the tiki/nautical/lounge vibe.  - There really are drinks on the menu that don't contain rum. A whole page of them, in fact.  - When there's a line outside, it is because the bar has reached its legal maximum capacity and the staff wants to keep the inside of the bar pleasant for those inside. The last thing I want when sitting at a bar is a bunch of sweaty people standing behind me pushing to get to the bar to order a drink. The line at the door has nothing to do with trying to be chic, exclusive, or snobby. It's just about capacity control for the comfort of the customers.  - There is a Happy Hour. I usually get there later and drink just neat rums, so I don't know all the details, but get there early and ask the bartender.   Now on to my thoughts of \"The Cove\" as my friends and I know it.   The things I love about Smuggler's Cove:  - The drinks are the perfect example of what fine mixology can and should be. They are balanced, they are pretty, they are little sips of heaven. I don't care that they take a while to make. Good things come to those who wait and if you're not willing to wait for a good drink then there are lots of other bars in the city where you can get a mediocre beverage with a shorter wait and less money. But why sacrifice quality for quantity? Drinking alcoholic beverages should be about enjoying the experience, not about drinking so many drinks so fast you can't even remember them the next day.  - The decor takes me away from my every day life into a fantastical hideaway where I can relax and pretend that the two-story waterfall really empties into the Caribbean.  - The staff are meticulous about mixology and customer service. They are friendly, and even when they're busy, they acknowledge you when you're waiting for a drink. Most of the bartenders have been there for a while now and have most of the huge drink menu memorized, so things move a bit quicker than in the first weeks after the Cove opened. If that was your only gripe when you first reviewed the bar in December, I encourage you to go back and give it another try.  - The cocktail menu and rum list are educational. I drank a lot of rum at Forbidden Island in Alameda over the past 4 years, but I didn't really learn much about the distillation, the different regions and styles, etc until I joined the Rumbustion Society at The Cove. Sure it's a bit challenging to answer all the questions on the quiz after you've just downed seven ounces of rum in one sitting, but it's also nice to realize how much information you've picked up by following along on the assignments that come with the first 20 rums on the list.  - The \"Mahalo Club\" is an awesome way to repay the loyal patrons. If you don't know about it already, the Mahalo Club is a card you can get and each time you pay your bill and give them the card to run through, you get credit for the amount you've spent in that visit. When you get to a certain amount, you actually get a savings on your next check! It's not a credit card, more like a frequent-drinker card. Ask the bartender about it next time you're there. Every bar should have a loyalty card!  - I love that there is super easy Muni bus access from my FiDi office, and easy street parking when I drive in from the East Bay on a weekend.  - This bar knows what it is (even when a lot of the patrons clearly don't) and it sticks to that vision. Every detail is an expression of Martin's vision of the perfect rum bar.   The things I don't love about Smuggler's Cove:  - The lack of food. I understand why there is no food. There's no place for a kitchen, and bar snacks can get kinda nasty with everybody putting their grubby paws in a communal nut bowl. I just wish I didn't have to squeeze in an early dinner before heading over for an early drink after work. I understand it, I just don't like it.  - The lack of servers. Again, I totally understand why having servers would be a logistical nightmare. I just wish I could find a comfy spot on the mezzanine level and not have to go downstairs and wait at the bar for every drink.   Overall, I am a huge fan of Smuggler's Cove. If I ever move away from the Bay Area, I will miss it dearly. If you understand what Smuggler's Cove is all about, and don't go in expecting it to be something else, and if drink quality and atmosphere are important to you, then you too will love this bar! If you want a quick, cheap drink, with two ingredients and a bartender who doesn't know what Orgeat is, then this is probably not your kind of place. Great! More rum for me!",

All of the cocktails I tried were tasty and fit well with the whimsical pirate theme. The drink menu is extensive, but luckily the bartenders are super nice and will gladly recommend a drink to you. The bouncer was less nice, as seems to be the norm in the city. Nothing gets you in the partying mood like feeling like some kind of herd.

Either fuck me over with the wait or with the menu, not both.   Oh just to add some salt to the wound the bartender was basically picking and choosing who would order next.

I don't normally like places like this because they remind me of disneyland kitsch/rainforest cafe novelties - the kind of thing you find cool when you are little but then they all start to look the same. I don't know if it was because I don't normally go out on Mondays so that in itself was so novel, but I had a great time at the cove on Tax Day Monday and I can't wait to go back with a bigger group of friends. Part of the coolness is that you could live on the same block and never know it exists - it's entirely unmarked from the outside and just looks like some generic blackened windows (...if that's a generic thing). \u00a0It's more Hayes Valley than Western Addition, and stepping in from the cold, windy, pretty empty street into this pirates haven is never something you'd expect. Someone with a real passion for pirates decorated this place and got the vibe just right - the downstairs area actually feels like the inside of a pirates ship. I probably shouldn't comment on the drinks because the one I had was their regular \"painkiller\" served up in a special tax day pineapple - \u00a0but their menu is extensive, and with a bar upstairs and down, you shouldn't have to wait long for a drink.

They should have more bars that are themed like this in the city. I don't know if we'll ever get to the point of say, Japan, where they have toilet themed ones, but I think the Maid one will fly in the U.S. ;-)  Great variety of cocktails and even some to share among 4 people, which was what we got.  - Top Notch Volcano: excellent, fruity, sweet, great show with the cinnamon to light the drink on fire and make it look like a volcano erupting, good to share with friends - Punch Bowl: strong, light tea aftertaste, comes lighted in a skull bowl just like all large drinks served for 4 people",

    "review_text": "This is currently my favorite bar in San Francisco. No bar has held the distinction for more than six months, but Smuggler's Cove has recently surpassed Blackbird for the title. Blackbird is still my go-to in the Duboce/Castro area, but if I'm meeting folks I'll push hard for Smuggler's Cove.   For background, SC is a rum-based bar in Hayes Valley. Parking is easy, but the drinks are strong enough to give you some pause as to whether or not you should be driving at all. The outside is nondescript. They seem to be trying to keep it all secret a la Bourbon and Branch, but the enormous line outside the bar on weekends will give it away.   The ambiance is awesome. Two levels, both with extremely kitschy pirate-themed decorations. If you don't go too far with kitschy, it's just cheesy. This goes all the way, and turns kitschy into cool.   The drinks. Oh, be still my soul. They say they focus on \"traditional drinks of the Caribbean islands, classic libations of Prohibition-era Havana, exotic cocktails from legendary Tiki bars.\" I've had classic libations in Havana, and these are way, way better. From the complex, spicy \"Three Dots and a Dash\" to the sweet Jamaican Milk Punch, everything I've had there has been excellent. The bartenders are accommodating, and will answer reasonable questions about the drinks. And there is, of course, the party favorite, the flaming four-person drink. I can't remember the name, but ask for the flaming four-person drink. They'll know. It'll set you back $36 plus a $4 tip, but that's not too terrible. And it's memorable. Tasty, but more of an experience than anything. They have plenty of non rum-based drinks for those who prefer other alcohols.   If there's one con, it's that the place is too popular. There's a line and it's crowded. You might have to wait 15-20 mins to find a table for a group at peak hours. But go at a non-peak time, and you'll love the place.   Oh, and they take credit cards.

    "review_text": "It seems rather unfair to judge a book by its cover. Whew! Now that that unpleasant beginning has been properly dispensed with, allow me to jubilantly eviscerate this pretty little tiki palace that's sprouted like a poisonous fungus on the rotten corpse that was once called Jade. (Note: Even though I never in this evening actually was privileged enough to receive one of the acclaimed rum cocktails, I fully intend to visit this establishment early in an afternoon to try one of their libations.) Long story short.  1) Pulled up on my heel-toe express and gained entry to said establishment 2) Was pleasantly surprised by the fact that said establishment wasn't too busy, nor was it too dead 3) Was handed a menu by a friendly manager who somewhat resembled Chris Eliot from 'Cabin Boy' 4) Read said menu at one of the tables downstairs. Was mightily impressed with what they did with Jade's trouble-prone and stinky waterfall -- it now looks like an awesome tidal pool that is sorely missing some poisonous tropical fish 5) Last complement -- Frankly, I'm a fan of tiki decor, and Smug Cove (which I'm now going to call said establishment) has pulled no punches. It's authentically awesome. Upstairs is a series of rattan (I think) chairs with empty rum crates for tables. The staircase itself has been transformed into a literal tiki chute of palm fronds and bamboo. Maybe they have Bob Denver on their payroll; it's something the Professor could've come up with. I'm not being ironic. I quite like the look; I mean it when I say it's awesome 6) Here's where the complements end. So anyway, I finish reading the menu, and I've decided on the drink I'd like to enjoy. The bar upstairs is only one person deep, so I join the queue, visions of El Draque in my mind (a Smug Cove version of the mojito). I'll try to be polite here, because I realize new bars have growing pains. But here lies a niggling problem that even Jade suffered from: Poor layout. You essentially enter the bar through the door and are immediately put into a quagmire. It's a cattle grind on the best of evenings; a channel that requires moving only forward, or to the right, which takes you down a set of stairs. Not a good design. Yet it wasn't all that busy when I made my visit. Somebody ahead of me had ordered some cocktails, and wanted a separate check, or something. The bartender was having some problems with the computer. This took several minutes, whilst the bar-back was essentially standing there, doing nothing. And then the bartender was finished with the problem, and proceeded to work on the next exclusive cocktail, which looked literally exhausting to make. There were EYEDROPPERS of some liquid which were essential to making some elixir whose taste I do not know of. Yep, EYEDROPPERS. There were about three little bottles with EYEDROPPERS, which she painstakingly pulled from their little plugs and gently dropped three or four little drops into a glass. Then she pulled out an old-school seltzer bottle and squeezed certain amounts of seltzer into a jigger. Twice. I know I'm sounding like a dick, but here's what bugged me the most: She hadn't learned the drinks yet. She was still reading from the cheat-sheet, and doing everything whilst staring at a sheaf of stapled paper. Such complicated drinks (maybe purposely so, considering the price of said drinks), such woefully under-prepared bartenders. I'd waited roughly twenty minutes for a drink at this point, and I had a friend of mine coming to meet me: I thought I'd go outside and have a smoke. 7) So I head outside. The bar didn't really get too much busier while I was there, but for some reason there was a queue outside the pleather rope in front of the door. Yay. I had my smoke in the effing freezing cold, and my friend showed up. She was keen on checking out the joint, and I was pretty sick of the cold. Went back to the front (I like that sentence) door, and was surprised that the doorman wouldn't let me in with my friend, because, and I'm quoting directly, \"It wouldn't be fair to the people in line to let you guys in ahead of them.\" Seriously.  So that's my review. I would have enjoyed the pleasure of reviewing the drinks, but sadly, that just wasn't in my cards this evening. Like I said earlier, I'll be happy to go back to have one of those blessed drinks, if only to have one and maybe taste a lovely 10$ El Draque, or a 12$ Rum Barrel. Fuck, I'll even have a Zombie. Give me something!  Another thing: I'm seeing a shitload of 5-star reviews. I'm not naive; those reviews are from friends of the owners and employees. There were like -- what, 5 -- days before the opening, with private parties. You can bet anything that the people who showed up at the bar on those evenings didn't have to wait twenty minutes for a drink. Nor did the bartender have to hurry trying to manufacture a libation requiring EYE-DROPS of some archaic liquid indigenous to some soil trodden on by pirates in 17th century Caribbean times.",

A sign nailed to a tree is all that hints theres something near. Friday and Saturday nights the line around the corner also lets you know you've arrived at your destination.   The door guy was pretty cool, a bit arrogant, calling the line \"my line\", you're watching the door guy, relax. The group behind us was openly drinking beers and passing around a bottle,I thought it was the thing to do until he walked up to them and gave them the, \"I think its pretty rude of you to be doing this in, my line\". Comical nonetheless before even stepping foot in this place. The group in front of us had a bottle also, which they hid immediately. The girl was pretty dam snobby herself and this door guy laid into her, in front of her dude, it was hilarious. He made her wait til last to check her I.D. and walk in the place. He did it in such a cool way though, I was a fan of him by now.   Finally, upon entering this place, it was instantly like a scene from, the Goonies, one of my favorites tip this day. Anyways, it was almost too much to take-in in one stay, especially knowing you're gonna have tikis in your system real soon-ish. I walked upstairs and it was super hot and jam-packed, no seats, no bar, just places to sit. It had a plank though, pretty cool. Back downstairs at the bar, tick... tick...tick... tick..., if I had a mirror I could have watched my freshly lined up to perfection beard grow. I made my way downstairs, I knew there had to be another bar in this place, you can't have a bar with three floors and only one bar!!!  Downstairs there was a bar and it was less crowded, still a good 15-20 minute wait for my drink\"s\". Yes, I double fisted tikis after seeing how long the wait was, glad I did too because the drink I was going to get first, had a pretty flower in it. Kona Kuna I believe it was called. It was complimented quite nice with the Zombie, which is the strongest drink in the bar, which they are required to tell you. I heard it 70 times. These bartenders were on top of their shit though, they knew what was going on at all times, kept their cool dealing with the crowd, stayed polite and efficient. Its cool watching them make the drinks, I bought a souvenir mug and kept my swizzle stick. I knew I was not going to remember shit, that Zombie is quite potent. A group behind us ordered the Scorpion which they put in a huge mug, give you two-foot long straws and set a flaming rum-dipped sugar cube in the center and make it a flame-thrower before leaving it to you. It was a cool show, we smashed and left. By the time I got to the door I was basically out. Blacked out on the BART. Good times!!!! Good BAAARRGGHHHH!",

I also realized that this place is on my list of 100 things to do in SF and it's definitely a surprise once you walk into the place.  There are 3 floors of pirating to be done here. The day we came the upper floor...which is also the middle floor was cash only but the downstairs accepted both cash and card. This apparently slowed the line down a bit...hence the line outside and the strict bouncer who kept us all in check. It was nice having him handle the crowd control because there was plenty of space to walk around and explore.   We ended up on the upper deck and sipped on our rather expensive rum drinks. We didn't have enough cash for a 2nd round of drinks so we carefully stretched out our drinks. Everything here's got some sort of rum in it and the most popular drink of the night seemed to be the volcano, fire, cinnamon explosion thing (I don't know what it was called) but I'm pretty sure the bartender is missing some eyebrows from serving that drink so often.  Anyway, cool decor, good crowd control, and great selection of rum but broken credit card machine, long 30 minute wait outside in the cold and not-so-cheap drinks. Still, it was a fun experience.

At the same time, envisioning myself pulling on the 20,000 Leagues diving helmet and swinging from the rafters. or maybe the cannon.  It was one of those nights.  No, not like *that*, just of good vibes and deceivingly strong drinks.  Between the whirlwind of pineapple leaves, floating orchids and flames shooting up towards the palm-strewn, fire hazard of a ceiling, it's no gimmick. What sounds like a \"girly\" drink is, in fact, a well balanced cocktail.   Feeling less than tiki? Viva Havana! El Presidente was outstanding.   Another winner: Three Dots and a Dash. V for Victory.  First timers: Rum Barrel. Why? Because your friend could finish their drink before you read the whole menu, so start here. It's equivalent to nearly two drinks and will give you time to ponder the next.  Mixed crowd here, albeit on the younger side, but a solid mix of SF: good vibes, quality drinks and a pirate-wannabe on deck.  Next time you want to brush up on your Morse Code and Caribbean spirits, you know where to go. Walking the plank not required.",

The bartenders here are not bartenders, but instead Mixologists....All the drinks are made with all natural ingredients and from what I observed any drink you order from the menu has at least 6 or more ingredients in the drink. Another thing that sticks out in my mind and is the obvious, you can't tell from the outside that this place is a pirate ship themed bar. The decor is so detailed and even in the bathroom they have the Yo ho Pirates Theme song lyrics on the wall....

(Not that there isn't in the afore mentioned! they're great too! -uh..except Hawaii) Tonight was a \"soft opening\". \u00a0The bartenders did great considering the complex drinks they were making -using ingredients you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else in the city. \u00a0Chocolate mole bitters? \u00a0Come on! What makes Smuggler's Cove rise above is that they use stuff that even Tiki diehards won't have stocked at home (at least not yet), and as much as we've all tried to make our tiki bars awesome, we don't have a 10 foot anchor, 2 story waterfall, and a three story building to dedicate to our cause.

Edit: to Thomas B., being on a mailing list and granted an invite to a soft opening because you are on the mailing list does not make everyone friends of the owner. \u00a0I have talked with the owner a few times from the other side of the bar, but my 5 star review is due to the fact that some of the drinks DO require a few droppers of something. \u00a0(an original Zombie has a tiny bit of Absinthe for example). \u00a0When the opening rush is over, I hope you get your drink. \u00a0Me, I ignored the opening issues, and focused on the drinks and decor.",

Happy to know that this place keeps their standards high so that no matter how infrequently I go, I am never disappointed. So, I have nothing to say but want to tell a story that shows how much they really care that you enjoy your time at this little sanctuary!  I went here a couple of weeks ago with a friend. By the time we got there, seven or so, the it was packed from basement to tippy top. We sat on the stools near the wall and the bouncer and studied the menu and chatted while we waited patiently for a spot at the bar on the main floor.   Patrons came to our aid, telling us that there was space in the corner if the guy in spot would move over (he was in the bathroom), and they were sure he would because he was a nice, friendly guy. So, we sat down and sure enough, this guy was a nice guy and had no problem with this at all.   My friend ordered our drinks and the bartender didn't hear her so I ended up with the wrong drink. When he set it down, he said, \"here's your **whatever***(I even forgot what I meant to order). I said, \"Oh, I thought I ordered blah blah.\" He said, \"I can make you another.\" And I, not wanting to waste and going with the flow, said, \"Oh, that's ok, I'm sure anything from this bar is good.\"   So I drank it. And, it was good.   When I was ready for the next drink, I decided to order what I initially wanted. And the bartender said, \"Since this is what you ordered, this one is on the house, but I promise you the first one was better.\" So, I got my initial drink, on the house. It was delicious. But, dammit, he was right...I DID like the first drink better.   I always rely on the kindness of a really awesome bartender. Thanks, Dude!",

The decor features fishing nets, sailing maps and other funky details that really play to the whole tiki/pirate/sailing theme. Arrghhh me-hearties!!  I loved it and simply asked the bartender to make me \"the most extravagant and over the top drink you know how to make\".

Us: That was the first time you've talked to us.  Him: You should have seen me and understood.

As you walk downstairs, there is a blue gleaming pond under the stairway leading to another room with a small bar. The waiter was extremely friendly and helpful. Like most bars, its self-seating. The moment a table was free, he notified us to quickly grab the seats. Thanks! \u00a0  I ordered the banana daiquiri and we shared the volcano bowl amongst three people. That is 8 oz of alcohol. Both were delicious! The banana daiquiri is not a blended drink. It has a small hint of banana. It reminds me of the banana flavored Runts candy. The volcano bowl is sweet with a little tart flavor aftertaste. Highly recommended!",

    "review_text": "Found this place by searching \"punch bowl\" on yelp, hehe..   This place is so cute! There are three floors. The floor you enter into has the main bar and a couple seats/places to stand across from it. The basement has another bar and gets a bit crowded/stuffy. The upstairs is my favorite as it's just seating -- easiest place to stake out in hopes of getting a spot to sit -- and there was the freshest air, I thought.   My friends and I got a volcano punch bowl, which we split among the three of us. The drink itself was great, especially the cinnamon on the surface. I liked the long straws that go directly into the bowl, but this method means it's hard to keep track of how much you've had (and it is surprisingly strong!). One of my friends wasn't aware of just how much she drank until she stood up, went to the bathroom and thought her reflection in the mirror by the door was another person.   Advice if you come: come early, so you can get a seat! Once people settle in with their drinks, they are not giving up their seats. Also, it takes awhile to get drinks, even water, so be patient!",

This can be a good or bad thing for some--note that the words \"irate\" and \"rat\" are both parts of \"pirate\"--but I usually embrace my inner buccaneer, and my times at Smuggler's Cove have been no exception. \u00a0As other reviews attest, San Francisco rum fans would be quite foolish to pass up this spot, as almost all items on their extensive menu of cocktails features quality rum. \u00a0Did I mention these cocktails are all really delicious? \u00a0It's actually a blessing they're rather pricey, because the size of your buried treasure chest is going to be the only deterrent to getting disastrously trashed on beverages that surely vie for the tastiest rum drinks you've ever had. \u00a0I was also impressed with the speed and disposition of the bartenders, who must memorize and regularly serve the large swath of cocktail options to jolly rogers and pissy privateers alike. \u00a0Be careful: the exterior is absolutely unassuming, so if you're not mindful of the address, you will walk right by this place unaware (I surmise pirates would favor discretion in hideouts, fittingly). \u00a0Bottom line: if you like pirates and especially rum, check out Smuggler's Cove.",

    "review_text": "I've been on a weeknight and it was a cool one-time experience. Cool decor, huge cocktail menu, not a bad time.  Last night, though, I tried to go with a few friends. One of my friends kept warning us that it was going to suck on a Saturday and that they were really weird about letting people in. So we got in line prepared to wait, no big deal. A few of the guys left for 60 seconds to put their jackets in my car and when they got back the bouncer made them go to the end of the line instead of rejoining us. Kind of annoying, but whatever. My friend who had been telling us not to go said to me (not to the bouncer) \"See, this is what I mean.\" And then the bouncer started yelling at him about how if he didn't like it he shouldn't go to the bar. My friend said \"No, I understand\" and the bouncer shot back \"It's clear to me you DON'T understand!\" and gave him this (really ironic) lecture about being courteous. So we left.  I'm sure this guy has to deal with a lot of annoying customers but this was crazy. Reading some of the other reviews it sounds like it wasn't an isolated incident. We get it, you're popular, you don't need us as customers, but there's no need to go out of your way to pick fights with customers. I hope this guy can chill out and have a little sense of humor about his job. It's a novelty pirate bar, not the white house.",

    "review_text": "When my friend asked me to vote on a pirate-themed bar or just about every other bar for her birthday event, I texted back \"PIRATE BAR\" right away.   I love everything that has to do with Pirates, and all things tiki and Caribbean (get it?) so this place was right up my alley.   We ended up going for my friend's quarter century, and it was a rockin' good time!   The venue is small, so we had to wait a bit in the cold, but we enjoyed talking and catching up with each other and met some of the nice bouncers (friendly bouncers?! shocking) and bride-to-be's waiting out front. This place is actually quite popular for bachelorette parties. Not sure why.   Some of my guy friends were even targeted by bachelorettes to cross things off their list (such as sit on a guy's lap for the last time, get a piggyback from a guy, etc.) so GUYS...you might get lucky here haha!  When we were finally let in, being a Saturday night, the place was packed to the door. There was literally no place to sit so my girlfriends and I got drinks at the bar first.   First of all, reading the menu to choose a drink was a pain. It was like a storybook novel, no joke, complete with the bar's history and a paragraph's length of description for each drink. Seriously!? We did not need that much information.   It was also hard to distinguish between drink names because they were not bolded. There was just text upon text in their book-like menu and it was very confusing.   After we finally settled on a couple of drinks, we proceeded upstairs to join the rest of our friends. Some friends smartly went up to the third level to reserve seating in the tiki room, and eventually we all made it up there and got seating for all 11 of us.   After trying a few more drinks, I have to say the best drinks here are the Pain Killer, one with coconut water in it (I forget the name) and the standout of the night has to be the VOLCANO BOWL!!  We saw a few people get it, looked cool so we decided to get one for the birthday girl. It's a huge bowl made up of rum and other liqueurs, comes with a light show (they light it ON FIRE in front of your face!!), and it feeds four or more people, all for the measly price of $36... haha.  Yeah, it is pricey, but it's kind of worth it if you're sharing with a bunch of people. It wasn't strong or bitter, actually kinda sweet but a definite creeper. We all got a nice, strong buzz from the volcano bowl..  In the end, this bar is great if you want to experience a tiki bar in the city, have a good time without dancing (no room and the jungle music isn't really for dancing) and don't need to sit down. And if you're with a large group, this venue isn't ideal because you're most likely going to split up.   But if you don't care about all of that, they make great drinks (for the most part) and the vibe and atmosphere are unlike any other bar in San Francisco! It's a unique gem among duds, my only other favorite tiki bar being Trad'r Sam's.   Four stars for Smuggler's Cove...Drink up, ME HEARTIES, YOHO!",

    "review_text": "What's a pirate's favorite letter of the alphabet? \u00a0RRRRRRRR  After having so much fun at Hula's in Santa Cruz over the weekend, I just had to check on Yelp for something tiki and local. \u00a0As always, Yelp didn't disappoint and came through with something amazing. \u00a0Surprisingly, although my friends have gone, I had never been to Smuggler's Cove before until last night.  Upon walking in, I immediately loved the charming pirate bar theme. Just what I always wanted...an alcoholic Disneyland! \u00a0Before ordering my first drink, I went upstairs and downstairs to check it out before settling on the main floor which I liked best due to the decor and airy feel. \u00a0The floor below also had a bar and was cool and intimate, compared to the two other floors. \u00a0The top floor was actually more of a table area with no bar. \u00a0The downstairs bar looked like it could be a lot of fun too, but last night, there seemed to be some group or party going on down there.  As always, service makes such a difference and I had the most fantastic bartender. \u00a0Dane was quite the artisan and takes great care and pride in each and every drink he makes. \u00a0He turned a nice evening into a really fun evening...this guy makes some incredible drinks! \u00a0Later in the night, I met the other bartender, Patrick, and he was most excellent as well.  Hanging at the bar, flying high on high octane, well-crafted concoctions of quality rum, I was in bar-mode and struck up conversations with the patrons next to me. \u00a0We all became good friends and after introducing new friends to other new friends, we suddenly had a fun group of five. \u00a0Everyone was having the most incredible time and we were all like old friends. \u00a0One of them, Zack, got us a flaming Volcano bowl with four loooong straws and we killed it fast. \u00a0I loved those big skull bowls, each with a slightly different glazing and personality. \u00a0Was surprised at how big the flame was as well as how long it burned...so cool! \u00a0It was the perfect end to a really fun evening...or so I thought until my new friends talked me into ordering one more drink.  During my time there last night, I had the following:  Zombie Sidewinder's Fang Volcano Bowl (for 4) Dot Dot Dot Dash Dash Dash  I loved them all and the key to ordering drinks here is to look for little icons next to the drink names on the menu. \u00a0One icon denotes favorites and the other one, a small barrel, means that the drink is strong. \u00a0Naturally, I started with the Zombie which had that icon next to it. \u00a0The Zombie turned out to be a great choice and was really strong...the perfect beginning! \u00a0Ever notice how when Adam Richman tackles his food challenges in Man v. Food, he almost always says in the beginning that there's a lot of food, but wow, it's all really good. \u00a0Well, this Zombie was the same way...it was really strong, exactly the way I wanted it, and yet it had all the individual flavors of the different ingredients. \u00a0It was really good! \u00a0Truly well-made and the best Zombie I've ever had.  The next drink I had was the Sidewinder's Fang. \u00a0As I mentioned in my Hula's Island Grill review just the other day, I used to go to a place called The Lanai where their specialty was the Sidewinder Fang. \u00a0Their version didn't have an \" 's\", but I think perhaps that was a cultural or island thing. \u00a0Their double Sidewinder Fang was always a favorite of mine and to this day I think back on it fondly. \u00a0As such, I was delighted to see it on the menu here. \u00a0Although not as deadly as the Zombie, it was delicious and came with a long orange peel which represents the snake.  After the flaming Volcano bowl which I described above, I then had one final drink which was the Dot Dot Dot Dash Dash Dash (think morse code) which was also rum-based. \u00a0At this point, I was way too happy to remember what was in it, but recall being impressed with how it tasted. \u00a0I gave one of my new friends a taste and they really liked it too.   I've seen some reviews that mention how long it takes to get a drink and this is true especially when it's crowded, but I believe that it is because a lot of these recipes are very involved and the bartenders take great care in making them. \u00a0It is definitely worth the wait. \u00a0Last night was a Wednesday though so I imagine it must get crazy busy on weekends. \u00a0  While I was there, a lot of people there saw pictures of my bird Sonny on my phone and said that I had the perfect bird for this setting. \u00a0Had some hilarious reactions to the bird porn videos on my phone of my lovebirds Julie and Jamie too. \u00a0Some of them just couldn't stop laughing. \u00a0  Among all the wonderful people I met last night, one of them was a Yelper...Josh N. \u00a0Much thanks to his friend Zack for getting us all a Volcano bowl and to Elenor (her spelling) for turning me on to the Smuggler's Cove drink sheet where bartender's sign off on every drink you have there. \u00a0I already had a great start on completing my list last night. \u00a0Lots of amazing drinks, good people...fun times!  Long live Smuggler's Cove!",

I was really hoping this was going to be a bar that I would come back to multiple times. \u00a0As soon as I walked in I was impressed by the environment. I could believe how much stuff was up on the walls. \u00a0  I headed downstairs immediately because of the huge crowd. \u00a0From what I remembered of Jade, most people stayed upstairs. \u00a0But this is not the same for Smuggler's Cove. \u00a0According to the bartender, the downstairs area was enlarged but from what I could see there was no extra room. Maybe that was because of all the people.  We quickly got acquainted with the drink ordering procedure. First you are handed a book with all the drinks. \u00a0This is a great idea but way too much info for someone only concerned about how quickly they can get me a cocktail. \u00a0There should be annotated version. \u00a0So after deciphering the menu we ordered. \u00a015 minutes late we finally got our drinks. \u00a0All the drinks average about $8/9 and are a little bit on the small side.  Later we decided to get one of the large drinking bowls that serves 4 people. \u00a0In order to do this you must have a table. And on a \u00a0busy Saturday night that took a little waiting. \u00a0Once the drink came we \u00a0finished that thing pretty quickly. \u00a0Definitely doesn't serve a group of four experienced drinkers.  All and all I had a pretty good experience of Smuggler's Cove.

We came at 2:30. Bf and I weren't the happiest of people at that moment. Feet were sore..beyond sore..so what did we do? Walk up more hills to Japan town to pass the time.   Came back at 5:00. We were determined to come here. Go inside, the I guess bouncer you would say? was very nice and informative. Since it was our first time, he kind of gave us a little tour around the place..and it was pretty nifty! 3 floors. 1st floor was like a little ship area. All 3 floors are very small. It isn't a big bar..but all pirate themed with some of that spongebob hawaiian esque music. Pretty soothing. Basically all of the drinks were of rum, and they had some that weren't..but only a few options.  Over 80 or so drinks..STRONG DRINKS might I add!   Bf and I saw from people's pictures on yelp that there is this Volcano drink that serves up to 4, and is lit on fire. We wanted. The bartenders (only 2) on the first floor actually take their time to make the drinks. The female bartender tries it with unused straws before she hands them to you to make sure it's perfect. Our volcano drink took about 10 minutes before it came out. The bartender dude did a little act with his evil laugh and blew that thang on FIYA! I loved it. Drink itself was pretty damn good! We killed it. Went for round 2! Anddddd round 3 :] ..of different drinks of course.   Within of 5 minutes of being in there, we see the crowd just run in. It gets busyyy. BUT, I definitely recommend this place for everyone to try. It isn't your typical kind of bar with your typical kind of drinks.   Get out your comfort zone and try this place. It shouldn't disappoint!   But there isn't a giant sign that says SMUGGLER'S COVE. So open up them eyes and peep for it.",

That said, I think Smuggler's Cove is quite possibly the first true \"tiki bar\" that I've been to. From the outside, it looks like a nondescript lounge/club. And it's actually fairly understated (as far as Polynesian decor goes) on the inside as well if you don't count the multi-colored fountain in the corner....no explosion of leis or grass skirts anywhere. And nary a Hawaiian shirt. Actually, I'm a bit disappointed about that.   Anyway, what they DO have is an exceptionally detailed cocktail list and a wealth of rum concoctions that would do Jack Sparrow proud! The flaming volcano drinks are quite the crowd pleaser. I highly recommend trying one, but be sure to share with a couple friends. And having extra straws on hand will quickly make you some new friends as well ;)  As for the ambiance...it's lit enough so that you can easily read the drink menu and not so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation amongst friends. I do wish they played some Polynesian themed music, but oh well...At least they have lots of seating downstairs and friendly bartenders! Good for groups and a more mellow night out :)",

The drink menu was amazing and the decor was cool, but the portions were very small for the price. I mean, $9-12 for a martini glass size? You get larger drinks and just as much ambiance at Conga or Forbidden Island.  Worst of all, the female bartender we had in the downstairs bar was so blatantly ignoring me every time I went up to order drinks. I don't know if she did this to all women that night, but my first time up to the bar she asked what I wanted, then proceeded to ask and make drinks for some guy who came up after me, before she finished my drinks. The next time I went up, I patiently waited because the bar was getting crowded by this time. When it came my turn, she looked over my shoulder and asked the guy behind me what he wanted! It just so happens he was my friend. He had to tell her that I was waiting to order before she'd even LOOK AT ME. What a BEOTCH!  It seriously ruined my night. I'm sure the owners and other bartenders are just fine, but I doubt I'll ever go back just because of her. She should be fired.",

A two story-waterfall, pirate paraphernalia crowding the walls and ceiling, pirate shanties scrawled onto the bathroom mirrors, a \"crow's nest\" for drinking upstairs, and an epic menu where each of the numerous Tiki drinks is explained in detail.   I enjoyed a very Pineappley yet very strong Fogcutter (because is there a better choice when you're in San Francisco?), and would have tried the supposedly delicious Hot Buttered Rum had my brother and I not gotten to the bar so close to last call. The drinks are pretty expensive, but that's to be expected when it comes to a bar that serves elaborate Tiki drinks that utilize many ingredients and take time to make.  A really fun place with a good crowd, strong drinks, and super fun theme, Smuggler's Cove is one of those places you should definitely visit if you're in SF for a weekend.",

Based on some pirate theme, it's a cross between a Rainforest Cafe and some shit you would see at a Disneyland restaurant (minus cool animatronics). \u00a0They made some best bars in the US list that was released. I have no idea what the source is, but check Google and you'll definitely find it.  I have to say I've never been to Smuggler's on a non Friday or Saturday. \u00a0With that said, I always have to deal with crowds. \u00a0Since the bar is so small, they have to throttle the line outside for fire code reasons. I have never really dealt with a ridiculous line here (around 10 people) so the wait isn't that painful. \u00a0Luckily the times I went, the bouncers were pretty friendly and talkative. \u00a0  Seating on the weekends is hard to come by, especially if you have a decent sized group. \u00a0If you have a few people, you can likely find some corner or nook where you guys can stand or sit. \u00a0Once ya'll find somewhere to post up at, it's time to order drinks.  The drinks here are definitely interesting and exotic. \u00a0Since there are \u00a0so many ingredients involved in each drink, the bartenders have to spend time mixing and creating each drink. \u00a0If you're the type who wants to get your drink and quickly get back to your seat, this is not the place. \u00a0There is a generally a glut of people near the bar who are waiting for their drinks. \u00a0You will probably have to wait at least a few minutes to get your drink. \u00a0  Drinks are in the 12-15 dollar range, so plan accordingly. \u00a0They do have beer here and your normal bar but what fun is that ? You \u00a0might as well try one of their concoctions right?  Other than the crowds and the length of time to get a drink, this place is worth coming back to I'd say.

Once inside, you are greeted by friendly bartenders in a cave-like, Pirates of the Caribbean atmosphere. There's even a trickling waterfall that cascades down the front wall down to the bottom floor. The music selection was something like Caribbean/ska/reggae/Star Wars/Irish/pirate?   There was plenty of room &amp; we took our time perusing the vast menu. I was overwhelmed so we went with the Top Notch Volcano to share between 4 of us. I mean, you really can't go to a tiki-type bar &amp; NOT order a strong, flaming rum drink served in an oversized skull with 4 extra long straws, can you? This wasn't anything like those watered down Scorpion Bowls at the Tonga room. This was good &amp; had some serious alcohol in it.

We tried quite a few other drinks among our group &amp; I found that I did not like the ones notated with a barrel on the menu. The barrel insignia means the drinks are strong.

Located in what appears to be the most obscure location near Hayes Valley, Smuggler's Cove has an incredibly impressive list of rum-filled drinks that will be sure to please any rum fan. Each drink description comes with its own mini- anecdote that details how some of the drink names came to be. The options are endless! My friends and I tried three out of the four shareable bowl-sized drinks, all of which were lit on fire, which was legit! Our favorite was the Volcano, which is named after the cool flame-igniting ritual that the bartender performs upon delivering the drink to the table. For the most part, each of the shared drinks had a ton of flavor mixed in with the distinct taste of a signature rum.  Another one of my favorite drinks from my first time here was the Hot Buttered Rum, which was deliciously comforting and definitely an epic win in my book! It's good as it sounds. Trust me.  Moreover, the limited capacity (capped at 40 people at a time) at this place ensures that you and your company will be able to enjoy each other's company with the usual crowded and obnoxiously loud atmosphere that can often happen after 7 PM or so. In conclusion: an exceptional list of cocktails, a great atmosphere, and eerily mysterious \u00a0props/decorations make this place a quality concoction winner in my book.",

There was a long line outside already when we got there but I was hoping it would be worth the wait. When we finally got inside we realized the place looked NOTHING like it did on their website. It was small, crowded, stuffy, and absolutely no music. We decided to be optimistic and give it a try anyways. Bartender wasn't the friendliest and the drinks were strong but not really worth $12 each.   Online it says they offer 60 different exotic rums but when I asked about a few that my husband and I were looking forward to trying they didn't have any of them. This should be noted on their website or they should update it every so often and make changes as items become unavailable.   I was disappointed and would never come back. Definitely not worth the drive from the east bay and you can't expect much here. Most people we saw walked in and ordered one drink and then left since there wasn't much room to even stand.",

Maybe it's just my desire to conform to my environments, but boarding upon this ship truly made me want to don an eyepatch, carry a sword, fight crocodiles (Er, ATTEMPT to fight em) and be merry! Smuggler's Cove is truly a hidden treasure - no huge sign to advertise its presence in an overlooked spot in the Western Addition, three small stories flowing with fabulosity, and a rich selection of rum drinks, exotic cocktails, and more!  Never have I seen a bar with an interior so immaculate. With its lighting and decor, it really does feel like being in a pirate ship- fun and zany yet authentic. I was almost wishing there would be a Treasure Island in Vegas type of show with cannons and all, but that would have taken away from its actual purpose as a bar. ;) Two metal staircases lead up to one level and another one down a bottom floor, though my date and I could only find two empty seats right up the bar in the main area. It gave us somewhat of an advantage by getting our drinks first as well as the opportunity to see up close how the bartenders handcraft and mix the beverages. It's pretty crazy! Love it when they light the bowls' sugar cubes on fire!  The menu is extensive and descriptive and I was warned to stay away from the drinks with the \"Very Strong\" icon (Shouldn't have told the boy about my unfortunate experience at another bar I reviewed on Yelp, WHOOPS), but the two that I ordered delivered a really good buzz: The Aku Aku (tropical cocktail) and the Chadburn (Nutty rum cocktail with pear liqueur). Looking forward to trying out some of the more signature drinks next time.  The place is really small and we were lucky we came when we did because when we got out at around 9:30, the line stretched to about the end of the block! Plan accordingly. If you first-timers are lucky enough to get in, be prepared to relish in some boozy gold!",

I find commenting on someone tipping habits to be pretty tacky, but in a divey bar a little rough talk comes with the territory. But to get denied service for tipping a buck on a drink?   I feel like a buck is not the worst tip in the world for a drink. He had messed up the order too, actually, but I had just shrugged and accepted it and tipped anyway because who cares.  Maybe he was showing off for this rather elderly gay man that had been tipping him with 20s in what seemed an embarrassing, misguided romantic advance toward the sexy bartender Marco, his abs rippling with each fruity drink he blended, his hands wet with condensation from the frosty wet flagons. Whatever the actual issue of which Marco had been struggling, the fact was that I had just gotten off a very long day at work and had come to Pirates Cove to relax and meet up with close friends I rarely get to enjoy. Being suddenly in the middle of a preternatural, transactional May/December gay mating ritual was not what I had signed up for.   My girlfriend was there and we thought he was kidding at first. Then we stood at the bar for 10 minutes and realized he wasn't kidding. My girlfriend spoke up and he got full on aggressive with us, angrily making a comment about my girlfriends medical conditions that she just happens to be rather self-conscious about. When he crossed that line, a lot of people around us at the bar stopped talking and that made the whole weird attack on her even worse. She ran out crying in tears.   I hesitated for a moment kind of stunned at the whole surreal series of events. To break the sudden silence of the encounter, Marco shrugged, looked me in the eye and said 'that fat C*** can go F*** herself before I would serve her NI**** A**\"  The whole encounter was really awkward and we went home for the night really upset about having my girlfriends race, handicap, and genitals insulted so loudly in public. I just don't know why one human being would say the things he said to another human being over only getting a one dollar tip on a drink.   I had been to the Pirates Cove many times and always had a good time. The rest of the staff has always been pleasant enough. I imagine this bartender Marco must have some personal issues. When I worked in a bar, if I had pulled what he pulled I would have been fired instantly. \u00a0but who knows of The Pirates Cove is run. Maybe proclaiming racial epitaphs toward handicapped black women is encouraged.",

Eh: I (i.e. my wallet) can't handle more than a drink or two at this place. You're looking at $10-plus cocktails, many of which are filled pretty good with ice. It lost points in my book for that.

Drinks are so weak--Jack Sparrow would not approve. \u00a0I even went to the point of asking the bartender for their strongest drink. \u00a0Perhaps they would've taken me seriously had I spoken in Pirate? \u00a0When he issued a warning, avast! \u00a0I thought I had hope, but it was only okay. \u00a0Arrg, these be lightweight pirates... or perhaps the management is savvy in avoiding people to get too drunk and paying a visit to Davy Jones' locker.  Ethanol strength aside, I'm still not a fan of their drinks, which generally taste like odd king's cup concoctions. \u00a0I think the mango one was the best, and it's basically a slightly alcoholic version of Jamba Juice. \u00a0  Their specialty is the bowls that come with an impressive flame-boyant (haha bad pun) show. \u00a0The fire indeed makes excellent Instagram videos, and it's fun for everyone to share the drink from the long plastic straws in an unspoken race of sorts.  The ambiance is probably my favorite--complete with a mysteriously lit pool, crates as chairs, and a collection of various weapons complete enough to be booty raided from a pirate ship, it's a swashbuckling fun place. \u00a0  It gets crowded on Friday nights and seating is limited, so I suggest going to the lesser-known top floor (well actually everyone finds out eventually, but it's not immediately obvious), because you need a table to get the bowl drinks--especially important if your objective is to get that Instagram video of catching fire. \u00a0  The lighting is dark as expected, but there are random purple spotlights. \u00a0If possible, I would avoid grabbing a seat in one of these places because it's a bit awkward and you literally look like you're glowing if you're wearing white. \u00a0Just a tip, mate.

The tri-level bar has an upper mezzanine for groups wanting a table, a main floor bar and a bar at the basement level. I'm amazed at how much they crammed in this palace because of the spiral stair reminiscent of an actual pirate ship, the water fall that is right next to it, and the three levels! Even though it's very cozy inside, I never felt crammed in or anything because it's nicely laid out.  As for the drinks, I'll need to come by and try some more, but all the drinks I tasted were stellar. The menu, although classic, is inventive and the descriptions on the menu are priceless.

The painkiller is a great first choice just be sure to choose your \"level\". The person that was with me ordered level 4 and I was definitely two sheets to the wind!!  Kind of a piratey theme but totally sigges the ambience! Want to go there again and try something new.",

    "review_text": "I've hesitated to visit Smuggler's Cove since its takeover from the old days of Jade, namely because I'd heard about the over-the-top prices and decor.  Well, that about sums it up. Smuggler's Cove (or \"The Pirate Bar\" as a friend fondly refers to it) is a novelty sort of place, which is one part awesome and about five parts kitschy. It's what you might expect a Pirates of the Caribbean type bar to be - that is, if alcohol were allowed within the confines of Disneyland.  The drink list is extensive and expensive, full of both hits and misses. I had the Navy Grog (strong, but relatively flavourless) and decided to hit up the bartender for a suggestion on the next round, preferring something strong and borderline sweet. He recommended the self-titled signature drink and definitely hit the nail right on the head. So much so, that I had two. I tried my friends' Aku Aku (delicious, super fruity) and Pirates? Paradise? Punch (I forget the name but it was strong and not as sweet) and they were both pretty good.  Myself and my companions arrived shortly after 6 p.m. and secured a spot upstairs - I'd imagine if we'd showed up just an hour later, we'd be hard-pressed to find available seating for all three of us. That's definitely one of the secrets to the place: show up early. Although, as far as I can tell, there weren't any happy hour specials, which is slightly bad form (Hook reference dudes).  In the end, I left the bar quite buzzed and with a fairly significant dent in my wallet (considering the dollar-to-drink ratio) but I also had enjoyed myself, so that has got to count for something. Overall, Smuggler's Cove is a fun place to hang out or check out every once in awhile, but I wouldn't ever count it among my regular hot spots. In other words, yes, take your friends from out of town here, but don't blow your wad here nearly every night.",

    "review_text": "Very cozy spot to lounge with some friends and drink the night away!!   This place is sooo hard to find! It was raining pretty hard outside when I was walking to smuggler's cove and even when I was actively looking for it, I couldn't find it! I walked by it a couple of times before I realized that the inconspicuous blackened doors and windows lead to the bar I've been looking for!   Once you finally find it and go inside, you feel like you've discovered a hidden treasure! The bar is pretty dim with heavy pirate-esk decor. You do indeed feel like you are in a cove in the tropics!   I had a couple of drinks here... 1) Bomba: Really strong but that's because I'm a lightweight and I drink really fruity/sugary drinks.  2) La Floridita: Fruity and sugary! Can't really taste the alcohol at all! Loved it!  3) Kona Cocktail: Comes with a tropical purple/maroon colored flower in the drink! Tasted just as good as it looked! YUM!  Loved the friendly staff! Great place to enjoy some good drinks with some good company!",

Do yourself a favor and try the Hot Buttered Rum. \u00a0They have a special hand made butter that is made into a hot drink, it's the most delicious drink I've ever had in my life. I'm not exaggerating either. Have it on a warm night too, it's sweet.",

    "review_text": "Ok so the Crow flies in from 300 miles+ away, then crosses the Bay Bridge to have a drink at this new rum bar in town. The drinks were yummy, and the bartender even accommodated the Crow's sensitivities by creating a new drink! Delicious! I Cawwwed! But wait! It's 4th of July weekend, we are hanging out, ordering the second round, relaxed in the upper Tiki level and we are told they are closing early because the owner called in &amp; can't afford the bartender's minimum wage for so few patrons. You know what? That's BS!! \u00a0There was a bouncer, a manager, a bartender and some other person I believe. \u00a0Don't kick out your customers. Their bottom bar was closed as well, so we didn't get the full effect of the ambiance all lit up downstairs. So here we are with a \"Batida\" from Brasil-( which I recommend) and my unknown Crow beverage that had a passion fruit twist, and we are having to chug because they want to leave. You know what , the manager was doing nothing but giving us his lame ass excuses why they have to leave. Send him home instead!! Decor is great, menu is stunningly thorough, but tourists beware! Don't go on a holiday. Hard core Tiki &amp; Pirate fans will probably forgive any imperfections just to drink in this place, but other places are better and have better service.",
