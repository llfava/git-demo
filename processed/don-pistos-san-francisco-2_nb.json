It seems almost blasphemous not to eat Italian while in North Beach but that just wasn't going to work for us that night. I Yelped this place out, and glad that I did. Despite being a bit off the main drag, and definitely non-descript from the outside, this place is obviously a hit with the locals.   We walked in at 6pm and could only be seated at a couple of awkwardly placed seats at the end of the bar. \u00a0It worked fine, though, thanks to the very friendly and attentive bartender. I also appreciated that she wasn't put off that we weren't drinking (the responsible choice before a drive back to the East Bay).  We each ordered tacos (el pastor for me, chicken for my dad). While not a huge portion for $9, they were nicely spiced and well prepared. The chips and salsa were a nice accompaniment. The balance of the menu also looked interesting. \u00a0I'd be inclined to come back some time and explore further, if I ever found myself back in this part of town.",

However, considering I paid $10 for two very small tacos, I probably would give it 5/10, but hey, I was in the nice party of North Beach. The closest place I could get $2 tacos with that flavor would be in San Jose/Mission. The dinner menu looks better and would love to try the soup everyone raves about.   -Drinks: 4/10 - cheap for bottomless, $15 for bottomless mimosas/sangrias, and after we finish our glass, we could continue to get mimosas or switch to sangrias. However, the mimosas were different, they didn't have orange juice but something orange flavor. It tasted a bit water down so if you want to feel something, you may need to have 5+ glasses. Same story for the sangria. I personally didn't finish either of my drinks...should have just got one glass for $8.   -Service: 10/10 - very friendly and attentive staff. Our waitress came by to check up on us often, refilled our drinks and water, and was very accommodating.   Overall: May come back, maybe for dinner.",

I just moved into the neighborhood and he assured me that everyone has each others back, which made me feel very welcomed. He made great small talk with me and my mom.  The waitress we had was very friendly and informative on the menu items. She came to the table at the right times while also lettings us take our time and not rushing us. I got some of my food wrapped up to go and she even through in a small free bag of chips. Very appreciated!   It's no doubt that the food was amazing. I personally got the fish tacos - to die for. We also got the grilled corn, not sure what all was on it but I've never had corn that great before, and I'm from Kansas City.

Don Pisto's seems like this little hole in the wall place over on North Beach/Telegraph - there's no signage or anything, so you just have to keep your eye out or go with somebody who's been there before. Very minimalistic, very small.  Incidentally, so are their portions. Tiny tacos all around. If you're hungry, be prepared to order seconds.  But the other reason not to come here hungry, is because you'll be totally willing to order half the menu. Everything on it sounds awesome, and that's generally because they ARE awesome.  It's also one of the only places I've dined in where they carry Mexican Coke, you know, the kind made with real sugar and in the old fashioned glass bottles? They'll bring it to you with a wedge of lemon, and it's outstanding. Mas refresco, amigos.  The service is good, it's about as quick as you'd want it to be, but not overattentive either. It's just right.  Ultimately, it's great for a brunch or light lunch, but if you want to really pack it in, you're better served elsewhere. Either way, Don Pisto's is quality. Check it out.",

You can alternate your choices between agua fresca mimosas, sangrias, and margaritas. I'd recommend the mimosas as it's most fresh.They say they switch between oranges, pineapples, blackberries, watermelon, etc...based on season. Nick was our server the first time and he remembered me the next, awesome memory! He's the one that looks like Ferris Bueller. He SAYS he gets Keana Reeves, but that could be from the ladies he's been pooring too many refills to. JK, he's a sweetheart and a very attentive waiter. Daniel also kindly gave me and my girls jello shots to make sure they were perfect for cinco de mayo, they were REALLY GOOD, so go get some! (I obviously had this in drafts for way too long..since it's mid May now, sorry Daniel)   Brunch food isn't phenomenal but still delicious. I've tried the chorizo scramble, comes with 2 poached eggs, chorizo, and potatoes. YUM! Also had the tacos and ranchos huervos, also highly recommend.  Definitely coming back in the summer, \u00a0someone please tell me when they have watermelon mimosas available, PLEASE!",

Anyone else feel like it's the weekend when you eat lunch at like 3 in the afternoon during the week?  This place was really relaxed, which should be a requirement for Mexican food in my opinion. You can't rush eating those chips and sippin a drink can you? I think not!  Someone had told me if I ever went to the Don's that I needed to try this 'Hamburguesa' thing. Having never tried it before, and feeling wildly adventurous even if it meant Montezuma's revenge, I went for it.  Oh I think I might have found a new love! It has this incredible bacon and onion flavor and was so good; like I moaned at least once eating it good. Moaning while eating food always reminds me of this girl I knew in college. She loved good food. Miss you Tara!  So back to Pisto's. It was a wonderful place to eat with friendly people and staff. The chips and guacamole were very good and the hamburguesa is a must try!",

The carnita is very tender and flavorful. All tortillas are homemade which is always better than store bought.   The hamburgesa was good but all so heavy. I heard it was cooked in bacon and onions. Burger was tender but I wish we had an option to cook it medium rare.  We also shared a pitcher of acai sangria. I haven't tried much sangria, but it is one of the best I ever had.",

    "review_text": "I think this place is a bit over-rated. What I really liked about it was the ambiance (young and hip), rustic decoration, and its fun environment (good music always ads to the pleasure of dinning).   However, I was quite disappointed with the quality of food. I went here with my fianc\u00e9 mid week. We didn't have a reservation and walked in. Luckily, they had an empty table for two (pretty much most other tables were taken though, so definitely this place is in high demand, and I would recommend that you make a reservation before you go).   I should say their margaritas was quite delicious! We ordered chips and salsa with guacamole, carne asada, and diablo prawns, and pollo asado. They first brought us chips and salsa with guacamole. It took them good 20 minutes to take us the next dish. By then, we were already quite full digging into the chips and salsa. Then they brought the diablo prawns. My eyes sparked (I love prawns), but shortly after, I had tears dropping from my eyes and nose for the rest of the dinner! Damn! Speaking of HOT?! The sauce on top of the prawns was super \"hot &amp; spicy\" and made me burn throughout the dinner! The food was actually delicious, but they poured way too much of that burning sauce on top, so it was even hard to see the prawns anymore.   Not until we finished the last piece of the initial dish that they cared to bring us other dishes. So the tacos finally came after I swallowed all the hot and spicy diablo prawns and dropped tears as I ate (I'm sure my fianc\u00e9 had a good laughter though because he doesn't like prawns and just watched me finishing that dish alone)! ;) \u00a0  The tacos were average (but also quite spicy)! Nothing too fancy about them though...The chicken however frustrated us....It was greasy and didn't taste great. So overall we were not too impressed with the food here, but the ambiance and vibe inside the restaurant get high scores. \u00a0   I would suggest that you go to this place if you want to have a great ambiance and care less about the quality of the food, or if is one of those days that you are feeling hot and spicy! ;)  Was this review...?",

I was really excited to try Don Pisto's, especially because I don't eat meat, and read that there was a vegetarian brunch menu. Unfortunately for me, the non-egg eating and usually dairy-avoiding patron, vegetarian here includes eggs and cheese in everything. They made me something egg-less, and it was all good. Everyone at the table LOVED the food, and we got a side of guac that tasted fresh and delicious!  My small table decided not to indulge in the bottomless brunch cocktails (alas, they looked amazing). I was SO impressed with our waitress because a) we did not order drinks, b) she did not ignore us after realizing we would not be a big ticket, c) she was just a freakin awesome waitress! Super friendly and attentive to our table, we had everything we needed without being hounded every minute.   My only real complaint is that they don't have coffee. That's just weird. However, they did allow us to go get coffee at a nearby shop and bring it in. Just a weird management choice on their part. \u00a0The other super-waitress quality our gal had was that she held the food until everyone was back at the table, ensuring no one had cold eggs. How sweet!   I look forward to returning to Don Pisto's to try out their dinner menu sometime soon!  Definitely go here.",

    "review_text": "After hearing such wonderful reviews from my roommate and reading about the bacon-marinated hamburger on a Hamburger Today blog (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Faht.seriouseats.com%2Farchives%2F2011%2F02%2Fdon-pistos-bacon-marinated-burger-review-san-francisco-ca.html&amp;s=80da0dcdef6e75e4a51fd98b3db6ed3255a9ab8089fbbd52b43c63965fffedc2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">aht.seriouseats.com/arch\u2026</a>), I had to try Don Pisto's.  Things that I love about Don Pisto's: hamburgeusa, their corn tortillas, sangria, and margaritas. Now I will go more in depth.  The hamburgeusa was one of the best hamburger patties I've ever tasted. It actually had more of a \"smoky\" taste than a bacon taste. It was so juicy and the bun was amazing too. Toasted on both sides and just delicious. I only meant to have a couple bites and practically ate half of it. I will admit that the hamburger purist in me was missing the tomato and lettuce. It's already so rich that I don't think it needs cheese and extra sauce. It comes close to one of the best burgers I've ever had except for the fact that I missed my usual garnishes.  We ordered the Al Pastor tacos (grilled rib chop, charred pineapple ), but truthfully I'm not sure if we got those. I didn't see any pineapple in the taco... maybe it was the Al Pastor... maybe it wasn't. It was still delicious and the corn tortillas are amazing. I'm not normally the biggest fan of corn tortillas (I prefer flour) but these were really delicious with a nice consistency. I hate it when the tortilla is slightly dry and starts to break while I try and eat my taco. Not really an issue here. Nice filling to tortilla ratio and they get a little messy while you eat them.  We also ordered the shredded kobe beef with 2 fried eggs on top served with corn tortillas. Think of it as a mixture of carnitas (except beef) and huevos rancheros (except no beans). The eggs are served sunny side up and they recommend you to break the yolks and mix it all together. While not extremely bad, this was my least favorite dish. It was a little too salty for me but the tortillas helped with that balance. I liked the hamburger more.  Sangria and margaritas are both solid and served in cute glasses. Apparently, Don Pistos does not take reservations for less than 6 people. We got there are 6:45pm on Wednesday and got the last 2-seater table.   I would definitely go back and get the hamburger and try different things on the menu. The soup looked really good!",

I \u00a0didn't realize just how popular this place is!  If you're gonna eat here and want to be able to talk to your friends next to you or across from you, either bring a bullhorn or have a fully charged phone so you can communicate with them via text.

The tacos were great. I tried the beef, shrimp and al pastor tacos and they were all tasty. \u00a0The shrimp dish was also good. I didn't get to try the meatballs dish, but my friend said it was just okay. I would definitely stick with tacos. The chips and green salsa are both really good. The salsa had a little heat to it. The guacamole could use more lime and cilantro though! I ate lots of chips at the beginning as we were waiting for the rest of our party that I got full real fast. Hard to resist those chips!   The margarita was good. One side of our table was enjoying it a little too much. Haha But that's cool! The birthday boy must enjoy his and his wife's night out without the kids!

The ambience was a little loud which you might or might not like. We started with a pitcher of margaritas which was good - not too sweet and not too tarty, and the guacamole had the right amount of chunkiness and creaminess.  As for of the rest of the food it was OK. Ceviche had a sweet twist which I liked but it didn't have much fish in it, the fish in the spicy fish tacos didn't taste very fresh. The al pastor was pretty good but carnitas was a little dry.  Overall the experience was good and I would come back once more.",

Super simple menu with things that you will definitely want to order. You can't go wrong with anything. I had bites of the breakfast burrito (OMG), the huevos rancheros, and the daily ceviche. All were delicious, flavorful, and fairly priced.  3. Free chips and salsa-- come on, everyone loves free chips and salsa. And the salsa is REALLY good and fresh, not out of a jar.  4. The service-- amazing staff who put off that hipster vibe, but are actually super friendly and hospitable. Our waitress bought us shots.  5. They also take reservations for parties of 6 or more. Or if you show up right at 11 when they open, you'll get a table no problem.  I will be taking all of my friends and even family here. It's a gem. What an awesome experience.",

We also had a vegetarian in our party who felt very left out of the fun as their only vegetarian option was sides and a few tortillas. It was a rather gross looking pile of beans and rice. So sad. In SF it should be better than this, at least provide some saut\u00e9ed veggies!

Don Pistos seems like a great place for picking a few things to try and share, and we split the Carne Asada Tacos and a house specialty, the Pollo Asado.

This is the honest to God fearing truth, my friends. I've dined with many large groups in SF as it turns out, so though I am not an expert in all things Bay Area, I've probably taken out more ravenous people in large quantities than the average Joe.   But we aren't talking about Joe. We're talking about Don. Stay focused, Colleen!  My illustrious colleague booked our group of 14 for the large communal table running down the middle and it was comfortable. Elbow room. Not crammed. Perfect. The restaurant is lively and tables turned over quickly, but our wonderful server didn't seem to care that we all wanted to sit and chat for a bit over multiple pitchers of MORE sangria.   Oh, the service. Please, let me tell you. By far some of the best I've had this year, maybe covering back to 2011. Sweet, sane, accommodating. Awesome. I wish I remembered her name! She was so great. Petite brunette with glasses. Also the hosts, owners, bussers, food runners...everyone we met was just so kind, really what you want to feel when you're dining and having a good time. I can' say enough things about it, but I think you get my point.   THE FOOD! Great down home Mexican with a bit of an upscale twist, but no so far so that you feel like \"WTF, I came to eat Mexican!\" This is Mexican. Tons of taco options (I really enjoyed the fish tacos the best), up to a Mexican-inspired burger (which was excellent), seafood, lobster, I saw a pork chop arrive, a burrito bowl option. I mean really...something for everyone, including our two veggie diners who were quite satisfied with the options as well.   SANGRIA. enough said. I liked it.   And the icing on the cake? They let my sweller then hell team bring a cake for my last dinner with them. How sweet is this!? How many puns can I cram into this paragraph? Through the grapevine I also heard that not only did they accommodate said cake (they do NOT currently offer dessert), but they arranged to pick up the cake for my co-workers, light the candles, bring it out at exactly the right time, take it back to cut it all up and serve everyone slices. I mean really? This is above and beyond, even for a place that doesn't serve dessert. Magical. It really was so nice.   So, cheers to Don Pisto's...I'd add you to my team any day sir, any day. Bring me another burger someone!   *def make a reservation, this place was swingin' on a Wednesday night!",

I'm not sure what that word means exactly, but it sounds Mexican, and it is without a doubt a pile of deliciously juicy meat marinated in onions and bacon.   It's so tasty that my companions should count themselves lucky that I was able to curb my violent urges when they so selfishly and presumptuously assumed we were sharing. I suppose we DID agree to share when we placed our order, but once it was clear how amazing this hamburguesa actually is, I feel as though they should have known better.  Having eaten quite literally everything on the menu, I can also report that Don Pisto's  excellence extends to their service, their al pastor tacos, the chorizo mussels and especially the poc choc. The latter dish is a fantastically flavorful pork chop (orange chili marinade!) that I'm quite certain was named after the sound you make when someone asks you what was so delicious that you so rudely crammed the entire thing into your mouth, and you try and say \"pork chop.\"  Don Pisto's is currently near the top of my favorite SF eateries, and I don't see that changing any time soon.

I got the fish taco of the day and my boyfriend got the carnitas. They actually use the same sauce for both meats, and it didn't amaze us whatsoever. Granted, it's not an authentic Mexican restaurant so we will eat our tacos at Super Taq instead.  Service was great, our server was very attentive and kept checking up on us. I was being very reluctant to try the michelada here because I'm VERY picky about it and he actually brought me one on the house when we were about to leave.

We waited at a cafe down the street and the nice gentleman called us within 15 minutes when our table was ready. The first thing I saw on the menu was Puerto Nuevo lobster! NO! Really? Because I plan on going to Puerto Nuevo to try the lobster, but I need to hire security to combat the drug cartels. Or maybe I'll just wing it one day when I'm feeling dangerous! I really would do anything for a great meal! Anyway, when I saw the Puerto Nuevo lobster on the menu, I was like diga me! Is this for real!? And it was :) This other random girl vouched for its authenticity!   So we ordered the lobster, the pork chop, the tortilla soup, and the micheladas.   Lobster: So delicious! Luckily, I've been to my fair share of lobster fests so I know what to do with a pair of those lobster cracker things [insert actual title of tool here]. I dipped the lobster in the luscious garlic and butter sauce and just let it sit there for a little bit. I then made my \"Leena-Style Tacos\" ohhh...the tacos! The corn tortillas were warm, fresh, and I think they were made directly from my Mexican grandmother (if I were to have a Mexican grandmother). They were lightly oiled and cooked just enough to melt in your mouth. I added the beans and rice, the spicy salsa, and of course, the lobster. Damn...that was a great taco.   Tortilla Soup: Because of this soup, my people will now have to travel all the way to Don Pisto's to get me this tortilla soup when I'm sick. If they try to hand me Campbell's or Progresso, that's just not gonna fly...the tortilla soup here is SO DELICIOUS! The flavors mesh so well together.   Pork chop: I was expecting it to be a little more tender, but the flavoring was delicious. It was a bit tough to cut but once you got that savory little piece of meat on a fork, MmMmM! Delicious!   aaaaand the micheladas were awesome and spicy! I was able to convince my table to get a round! They definitely come at you with a bang! :)   I can't wait to come back to this place!! :)",

The waitress keeps em coming too, I've never had to motion to her for another drink. (I feel like such an alchy lol)   I usually get the Chorizo Breakfast Burrito and it is YUMMY. I also LOVE their guacamole, I find myself just shoveling it in.  I give this place 5 stars because I love the waiters and waitresses, the bartenders are cool, the owner is cool, the cooks smile from their little area as they work hard to get us our food fast, and the random music that plays is also COOL!",

    "review_text": "How was this past Saturday the first time I had ever been to Don Pistos? I'm holding this one against my friends in North Beach because this was a truly amazing food experience that I can't wait to share with other city dwellers...onto the review...  Friday nights always end in two ways for me:  1) I go to a great happy hour with my co-workers and get unintentionally sh*t-faced, then party the night away.  or 2) I go home and lay on the couch with my roommate and down 2 bottles of red.  How did this past Friday night go? Door number 2. My parents gave me these wine glasses that hold an ENTIRE BOTTLE OF WINE. Yes, an entire bottle. How could we not test this one out? Since it was a science experiment of sorts, it didn't feel so shameful. Anyways...  I woke up Saturday morning with a real headache. You know the one...Too much wine, not enough water, and there's never food around, so what can you do? GET BRUNCH! Weeeeee.  The roomie suggested Don Pistos and I needed a longer walk than usual (to air out my purple stained teeth ha!), so off we go.   What. A. Great. Brunch.  We were seated rather quickly by an adorable hostess who was not only friendly, but super accommodating. She found us a great spot, immediately brought out water, as well as Don Pistos's famous chips and salsa. This stuff was the real deal. It was a great green salsa with a spicy twist. If you have read any of my other reviews, you know I love the spice, so this was a great surprise for me.  Onto the real upside of this place: bottomless mimosas, sangria, or margarita's. And they're interchangeable. Umm, what? That's amazing. I'll have it all! The mimosas are not mixed with your run-of-the-mill OJ either, but this amazing pineapple-OJ juice. So bomb.   For my main dish, I had their famous burger. This was probably the most juicy, delicious burger I have had in a longggg time. It was topped with guacamole and had a side of radishes, that really made this burger pop. I would definitely recommend this dish, hands down.  Will I be back to Don Pistos? Absolutely.  Cheers!",

As far as the food, they said the plates were \"meant for sharing\" and they came out as they were ready.

Order some sides of guac, pitchers of margaritas/sangria, and you're on your way to a delicious meal.  One thing to note is that though they offer margaritas, since they have a beer/wine license only, the 'tequila' in them isn't standard tequila... it's some kind of wine. It's really good, but probably not going to get you as drunk as quickly. Prices are very reasonable, so I don't find this to be a negative.

High ratings on Yelp (I should've known better to be more skeptical) , it was packed , long wait time (should've eaten elsewhere) and when we finally get up close and personal inside, it's just a disappointing mess.   After a 1 1/2 hour wait (we only had a party of 5 so they wouldn't take a reservation) we were finally seated in a strange, stuffy downstairs area of the restaurant that smelled like dirty dishes and restroom. Why did it smell like that? Oh , because it's next to both those areas.  By the way, Don Pisto's used to be an Argentinian steakhouse (which wasn't so great either) and the inside is almost completely the same.   The menu is not that big so if you come here and it's busy, don't expect to actually be able to get what you want. They will probably be sold out of many things.  Our server informed us that they were out of the following things:  No more salsa No more ceviche  No more steak  No more lobster   Hold the fuq up. I said HOLD DA FUQ UP! Mexican restaurant without salsa?!? What kind of blasphemy is this?! It's like a Chinese restaurant with no soy sauce - UNHEARD OF.   Sorely disappointed because 1) my friend and i had our hearts set on the lobster and 2) this left our group with just brunch items and a couple of tacos to choose from. I didn't wait 1 1/2 hours for some damn huevos ranchero as my dinner so I had al pastor tacos. Not impressed. Oily and all, but no heat \u00a0no spice. Man these are not al pastor tacos ok. \u00a0Estas son chingaderas!!!  Oh. We also had a pitcher of sangria. It wasn't very good. As a matter of fact it was pretty weak, there no were chopped up fruits (was it strained out?) and only a lime in it.  I don't get why Yelpers rave about the $6 guacamole and chips. Really people? It wasn't worth the $6 nor was it that tasty. It reminded me of Chevy's guacamole!! Just for the record, I never eat at Chevy's by choice. Had to put that out there. I was just soooo hungry that I kept noshing on the chips before my tacos arrived. Starting to suspect that those who love Don Pisto's are also Chipotle fans *gag*  Many of us felt that the food fell short and really needed that salsa. How sad. I love al pastor too so I really wanted this to work.  Tasted the chicken tortilla soup. It was pretty bland.   Honestly, Don Pisto's is for people who are in the area, want to eat somewhere hip/trendy and don't know any better that they should probably visit a taqueria in the Mission.   Let it be known that this was the 2nd longest I have ever waited for a meal (the first was for overrated hipster Outerlands) and it was totally not worth it. The food just fell so short for me that I don't care to find out of their salsa, ceviche, steak or lobster is any good. I mean come on, it's like finding a hot guy with a tiny lil one. Once you see that you're like, wtf am I supposed to do with that lil Vienna sausage? You dont go back to him , that's what! Sorry Don Pisto's, I'm dumping you.",

It is too bad that they only do it on Wednesdays.   \u00a0In this update, I am still giving them only 4 stars, because the last time I went, I had been told that they discontinued the chorizo-braised mussels as a regular item, and it was now only a special. Honestly, without those mussels or the burger, it is just an average (and somewhat overpriced) Mexican restaurant.   I have not been there since, and will not unless I call ahead of time and am told that they have the mussels.",

Walked in with 2 other friends on a Wednesday around 7:45 and had to wait around 15 minutes for \u00a0table. Oddly enough aside being tucked away into a side street away from the real hustle and bustle of North Beach the decor lends Don P to really actually feel like a hidden gem. Dark wooden tables accented by the brick walls with some abstract paintings gives this place a very seductive feel.   Chips: Right away when you sit down a FRESH plate of chips is placed in front of you with salsa. I think we went through 3 plates, it was impossible to stop. I worked hard to restrain myself.  Ordered family style: Taco #1 (Carne Asada: mesquite grilled steak, arbol salsa, onions, cilantro)- Delectable! Taco #2 (Camarones: Sauteed shrimp, garlic, red onion, avocado salsa) - my fav of the three. Perfectly blended and I love myself some advocado salsa. Taco #3 (Al Pastor: grilled rip chop, charred pineapple)- Just my own preference, but not a big fan of pineapple so it was just satisfactory to me. Friends agreed.   Hamburguesa (marinated in bacon and onions, guacamole)- Coming in my friend provided a lot of hype about the burger. I came here specifically for the burger and it lived up to the billing. It's a very simple burger, there aren't a million toppings inside and you can actually fit it in your mouth. What it may lack in toppings for some people it makes up in flavor. The meat is very juice and marinading it in bacon and onions is a genius move. I had a great appreciation for the flavor. The guacamole was icing on the cake. Simple and impactful... let the meat shine. My kind of burger!  The service was excellent altho the waitress found it bizarre when my friend asked for a different kind of salsa for the chips and tacos. It seemed like they only had one option. I prefer my mexican restaurants to have a full blown selection of salsa!",

Came here post-Oysterfest on Saturday evening at 7pm, with a party of 10... 8 of them being very hungry men! Our wait was 2 hours so we must have been at least 5 pitchers of margaritas + sangrias deep by the time we were seated for dinner. We were in the downstairs dining room. Group favorites were the hamburguesa, the carne asada tacos, tortilla soup, ceviche, and mine - the mussels and chorizo. So amazing, and the broth that it was seasoned with... such a sensational experience! I greatly enjoyed dipping my bread in that. Glad I met the Chef/Owner Pete prior to ordering... that was his favorite dish on the menu, and it's now mine.  I do suggest making resos, and getting there early if you want to covet a prime dinner spot during mealtime! Service was friendly, and attentive. Will certainly come back soon! And did I mention - their brunch features bottomless mimosas for a super affordable price??? Will have to hit that up soon!",

I can't complain about the food itself because it's pretty fresh with good ingredients. \u00a0The chips are pretty good, although a tad bit salty in my opinion. \u00a0I appreciate that when you order chips, it's an endless supply. \u00a0Kinda wish guacamole was like that too though, not $6 a pop. \u00a0Diablo prawns were as expected - really spicy. \u00a0Not that I can't handle it. \u00a0Al pastor tacos and pescado tacos (choice fish of day was rock cod) were well-made and had high quality ingredients. \u00a0I just can't justify paying $9 and $10 for two tacos when I've had better and bigger tacos for half that price.  Again, when you come here, you're paying for the atmosphere. \u00a0It's a fairly intimate atmosphere with plenty of ambiance. \u00a0It does get fairly loud in here because the brick walls just allow sound to bounce off the walls and reflect back into the room. \u00a0If you're young and got money to burn, this is your spot!

I would definitely go back for the Poc Chuc, we also sampled there shrimp taco, definitely also a must try they didn't give you the standard 3-4 smaller anorexic shrimp you get at other places they give you 6 full size shrimp on crack, the kind of shrimp you get at the fancy restaurants where they are litely seasoned and on a square white plate with a green circled line with a mint in the middle hahhaha. they offer you 2 soft tacos each containing 6 full size shrimp or prawn.  food ***** wow, definite 5 stars on the POC CHUC price $$ service **** very helpful staff ambiance ***** definite good spot for first time daters, small couple groups, or you can just kick it by the bar with the bartender named Kate, due to our long wait on getting a table they offered us a second Sangria on the house just for being patient. I guess the would be romantic setting, really dark inside, the kitchen is lively, flashes of fire from the stove 3 man crew in there. bar is about a 4 seater so you are up close and personal with the bartender.

The boys were happy :)   Our friends got the Carne Asada and one thought it was wayyyy too spicy for her, but others at the table thought they were manageable. \u00a0So, if you have a low spice tolerance ask for a side of sour cream with it! \u00a0  Been on my to-do list for a while and did not disappoint!",

We got there around 7:30pm on a Friday and waited at the bar for about 50 minutes. \u00a0They said it would take about that long and no big deal for us as the bartender couldn't be more friendly and attentive. We each had 3 of their fabulous margaritas and some chips and guac. \u00a0The margs are great and got us all a little drunk before dinner. \u00a0It is loud and crowded but fun and not annoying. \u00a0 We were seated and had the little burgers and the shrimp tacos which were fabulous. \u00a0I recommend both. \u00a0The service was good and then at the end of your meal they give you a shot of something - by this time I was pretty boracha. \u00a0Fun, great place before going out on the town or hanging out with friends. \u00a0Enjoy!",

In terms of food, we ordered chips and guac to start. \u00a0 I would definitely do this again. \u00a0The chips were warm and nicely salted; the guac was full of flavor and noticeably fresh (though lacking a kick). \u00a0We ordered three sets of tacos for the two of us-carnitas, fish, and carne asada; each set comes with two tacos. \u00a0The tacos are small, but pretty tasty (the fish was my favorite, though the carnitas came in as a close second). \u00a0  As for the space, the place is loud and the lighting dim (I would say a little too dark unless you are seated near the window). \u00a0 I love the brick walls and casual space (no need to dress up if you don't want to!). \u00a0Also, they have a small bar at the entrance, and if you can nab a seat, then you can eat/drink there without having to endure the wait.",

Cons: - More than likely have to wait (but that can be a good thing too. \u00a0Just sit at the bar and enjoy a drink) - Small portions, so either pre-eat, or understand that 1/3 of your meal will most likely be chips - Kinda expensive. \u00a0But be willing to share, and go in with the thought you are enjoying one of SF best places to dine.",

I am sure glad we did!!! \u00a0The food was amazing. \u00a0We eventually were seated at a table in the corner and ordered the guacamole. \u00a0Now I am an avocado farmer that has become very adept at making great guacamole, but theirs rivaled anything that I have made. \u00a0They also brought out a Tomatillo salsa that was outstanding!!! \u00a0  We first ordered the Tortilla Soup which was very good with generous portions of chicken and vegetables. \u00a0It was well flavored but not real spicy. \u00a0An excellent way to get the meal started.  We then ordered the carne asada tacos and the pescado tacos. \u00a0The portions are \"small plates\" and the tacos came out very timely. \u00a0The carne asada tacos were outstanding with the meat well marinated in a rich sauce. \u00a0My companion and I both loved them. \u00a0Then she informed me that the I could have the fish tacos because they were too spicy for her. \u00a0OMG - the fish taco's were the best I have EVER had. \u00a0The sauce that they were marinated fried and served with was incredible. \u00a0While a little spicy, the flavor was amazing. \u00a0Now I have had all kinds of fish tacos over the years. \u00a0I have never had anything close to these. \u00a0  All through the dinner, the staff was enthusiastic, attentive, and incredibly welcoming. \u00a0It is definitely a young crowd but the prices are reasonable, the food is outstanding, \u00a0The vibe and atmosphere is lively, welcoming, and the kind of place you just want to hang out. \u00a0I can't wait till I can come back here again. \u00a0Overall a fabulous dining experience!!",

The restaurant had low lighting but it really set the tone of laid-back atmosphere of the place. \u00a0  I had to try the hamburguesa and of course, the bottomless mimosas. They were serving pineapple mimosas that day which were balanced perfectly with fresh bits of pineapple.

However, I bit into it and the patty was moist, juicy and had pure bacon flavor goodness. My friend ordered the huevos rancheros and although I didn't get to try her dish, it looked really fresh and tasty.  Our waitress was really sweet and stopped by our table to re-fill our glasses every time she saw our mimosas running low.

An hour long wait, happily occupied by Micheladas (spicy tomato juice + mexican beer + lime juice + salted rim). We started with the guacamole and chips, the guac was creamy, slightly spicy and topped with cilantro... delish! I ordered the Al Pastor Beef Tacos with Pineapple and a side of the pinto beans. Everything was amazing. My friend ordered the chicken tostadas which were incredibly flavorful but not overpowering, a big hit!   The service was very friendly but I wish they moved the dinner along a it faster. Overall I loved this place and wouldn't hesistate to come back!",

    "review_text": "Let's face it, I'm a Mexican food junky/snob. I love menudo on Sunday mornings and homemade enchiladas, made by mom, of course. So sizzling platters of stringy, over cooked shrimp and tasteless strips of flavorless beef served with mashed beans and orange rice is definitely NOT my bag baby. I dig really good Mexican food and my bar of measure isn't a super burrito down in the Mission at 2am.   Located in North Beach, typically known for Italian cuisine, Don Pisto's is one of those perfect \"stand out's\" in a touristy neighborhood geared for out-of-towners. Just a block away from Washington Square on Union Street, parking might be a chore but in that neighborhood the walk is picturesque to say the least, but pay attention! Don Pisto's sports no signage of any kind so aside from a group of folks waiting for seating in front of a mostly plain storefront, it's fairly easy to miss.   They do not take reservations for parties under 6 so it's not unheard of to wait for up to an hour for a table on the weekends and around 15-25min on average during the week but that's cool, sit down and relax with Pete. The owner/operator and will make with a story or two over a drink. The acai sangria is great but as they have no liquor license the Margarita is wine.   The feel of the dinning room is rustic and simple-elegant. Brick and mortar walls, heavy, stressed wood beams, cast iron fittings, splashes of red and black make for a warm and comforting experience while dining. Heavy, high backed, wooden chairs accompany candle-lit white clothed table tops with roll-up's.  You are initially greeted with the requisite chip and salsa combo but unlike your typical taquria, the salsa is a tangy green tomotillo sauce that is acidic, mildly spicy and slightly sweet. The tortilla chips are nice and warm, light and crispy and are seemingly made for the singular purpose of scooping. The best usage of this purpose is scooping gobs of guacamole in your mouth. Bright green, creamy and chunky, the guac is a perfect match for the slightly salty, crispy goodness of the chips as you peruse the menu.   Simple. Thats the best part of this menu. Simple. No confusing combo platters. A Burger cooked in Bacon grease. A steamed lobster dinner. A carnitas plate. Taco's! Taco's, I'm not going to lie. I rarely get past the taco's. The fish taco's are downright vindictive in their tender simplicity. The fish changes frequently but on this trip they were offering Lingcod, pan seared to perfection and lightly dusted in secret spices it's finished off with a light slaw. The al pastor, made with center cut loin, is tangy sweet with a spicy smokiness and delicately tender. I have a hard time ordering anything else.  To be honest, I'm all about brunch. The Mimosas are made with agua fresca, basically just a shot of watermelon juice instead of OJ in champagne. Let me tell you, so much better than the OJ. \u00a0They hand make flower tortillas that are as light and flaky as pie crust, perfect with the chorizo and poached eggs.   Don Pistos is a locals hot spot in a tourists driven Italian neighborhood. They serve excellent food from south of the border with fresh local ingredients, bold flavors in an elegant style, distinguishing themselves from sizzling platter chains and burrito shops. Don Pistos is fun and inviting with excellent service and welcoming ownership. It's a great place for authentic cuisine and a local feel. Be sure to hit brunch on the weekends, try the al pastor -its the best in The City, and ask Pete to do \"Thai Mike\" it's hysterical.",

Bottomless mimosas, sangria and \"margaritas\" (made with agave alcohol that was somehow not tequila but still worked very well) for $18. You can mix and match too, however there is an hour and a half time limit. At first the time limit thing seemed annoying but as my hangover faded and my day drunk began i realized there was WAY more then enough time to finish as many as could be handled. The food was good but I only tried my friends because I felt too sick to eat a whole meal. Adrianne was our server, God bless that woman. The last half hour of our brunch the place was pretty packed. Our table was a loud drunken mess, laughing and saying way too many bad words...loudly. Adrianne never even told us to be quiet. She made sure our drinks kept coming then sent us on our merry way back out onto the streets of San Francisco. Next time I'm in town Don Pisto's will be where I spend my sunday morning. So much fun :)",

Nice house made chips, almost pita-ish. The guacamole is super creamy and delish. I had the pork chop. It's a) huge and b) fantastic. Great char on the outside but just still pink on the inside. So, safe but super juicy. The cucumber salad was a nice surprise. I expected it to be a waste of space. But it really had a lot of flavor.  Interesting music when we were there. Old school gangster rap. But it was made it a little extra fun.  Great helpful wait staff.   Definitely recommend.",

The service was prompt and friendly, and we were given a lot of suggestions since it was my first time.  I really love ceviche so that was one of my choices. It was extremely fresh with good chunks of seafood (delicious scallop!) and avocado. The street tacos were huge and very flavourful. For these type of street tacos, I prefer Por Que No in Portland, but these still hit the spot for me. \u00a0As a main, we shared the chorizo and mussels. The portion was generous and there was a good heat in the flavour of the dish, but I wasn't a fan of the little bits of chorizo sprinkled throughout the dish.   I saved room for dessert so I was pretty disappointed and surprised to learn they don't serve any! \u00a0Oh well, North Beach has plentiful places for dessert so we went elsewhere. All in all, great experience and worth a repeat if only for the ceviche alone.",

I didn't care about the tacos because I am a die-hard taco truck fan, and I do not like a high-end-taco-places like upper Fillmore and Marina Cow Hollow. Well, whole thing in the MCH is very slutty.   We were eating tortilla chips like crazy hen and rooster because the chili verde salsa was incredibly addicting.

(After two pitchers of margaritas for the table, these tasted like chocolate milk (although composed solely of vodka, I think). They were delicious!)

It was one of those evenings where you show up somewhere alone only knowing 1-2 people, and end up leaving meeting some great people you would like to keep in touch with.  I realize that has nothing to do with the food here, but if the food was terrible, that may have not been the case. The drinks, the service, the food and the ambiance-- Everything worked together to create a wonderful, warm and memorable evening. Everyone wowed at the food together, clinked their delicious drinks together and enjoyed the wonderful atmosphere here.  The downstairs impressed me for one big reason... There was one table near us, and we were in a big picnic table style set up since we were a large party. And that was it. They could have easily fit in one, maybe two more tables down there. By keeping it emptier, they made it less cramped, more spacious and it seemed less like a busy restaurant and more like a friends house.   We ate tacos, and lobster was brought down which I was unable to get my hands on... but everyone loved it. The tacos were delicious! We all shared their Margaritas and Sangria which were also great!  That was my first time there, and I will most definitely be coming back! A great place to bring friends, people visiting from out of town, or come here on a date (as long as you don't want intimate settings), but are looking for a more fun atmosphere.

It was one of the best and freshest I have ever had. No mixers here, they definitely use fresh squeezed lime juice and simple syrup - not too sweet. If you like Corona, order a 32 oz bottle for $9 - great deal! Food is amazingly flavorful and authentic. However, the food is very spicy, not for the heat-sensitive palate.

My favorites are the shrimp tacos because their shrimp are super juicy and the al pastor tacos cuz they have a little bit of a sweetness to it from the pineapple.  You get 2 small tacos per taco order, but they really load the tortillas up so they are enough to fill you up. Oh and they give you their homemade chips and green salsa while you wait. I could eat those allll day. So good!  They don't take reservations for parties smaller than 6 people, so expect to wait a while on weekend nights. You can always wait for a seat to open up at the bar and order from the full menu there as well if you dont want to wait so long and dont care about where you're sitting. \u00a0  Great place for girls night out, guys night out, a birthday party, and even a family night or brunch (if they are hip enough).",

Then...then we tasted the food. \u00a0Muscles with chorizo, tortilla soup, ahi tuna, pork chop. \u00a0It was agreed that no one had ever tasted a better pork chop. \u00a0The hamburgasa, has bacon in it. \u00a0Ok bacon in a hamburger, pretty typical, until you try this juicy compelation of beef, pork and avocado. \u00a0Don Pistos has made me think differently about Mexican food.",

Carne Asada tacos: good, make sure you get the gauc to make it great! Hamburguesa: guac burger? how can you go wrong with that?

Although they were busy, my food came quickly.  First I had the chips and salsa. Both very good. The green salsa is some of the best Salsa Verde I've had. Then they brought out the guacamole I ordered. It was pretty good too. It tasted fresh, but it didn't really have a kick to it. I'm more of a fan of spicy foods.  The next dish to come out was the ceviche. It was amazing! Best ceviche I've had for sure. It was a good portion for two people to share as an appetizer but not too big that it's unreasonable for 1 person to eat as well if followed by something like tacos. Which brings me to...  The tacos! I ordered the Al Pastor tacos and they were very good. They served them on small corn tortillas with radish and lime. Definitely a good set of tacos.  The only downside is that it was a bit pricey, but for a good taco outside of the Mission, it's worth it. Especially if you get the ceviche!",

After some evening debotury with friends, my girlfriend and I landed in Don Pistos just in time to cast in the last orders of the night (12:30AM weekdays).   Carne Asada Tacos $9 - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE8DTKsTFi1Vzm_zzd0Q?select=OJx6Ehk6qHIjhJJt78BHEQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE\u2026</a> You know me, and if you don't, I'll tell you how much I hate overpaying for Mexican food, especially for something as simple as a taco. I've done it, and you've probably have yourself, and sometimes, it ends up in disappointment. However, the Carne Asada tacos at Don Pisto's is well worth it!   A warm tortilla topped with nicely seasoned beef, chili verde salsa, and pico de gio. Simplicity at it's finest (and deliciousness!) Grilled jalapenos do come with the tacos, and more can be requested upon, but one set back is that the peppers have already been de-seeded.. bummer.  Lobster M/P ($36 at the time) - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE8DTKsTFi1Vzm_zzd0Q?select=nF2xM7qc0C0tOiKLYRdNPQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE\u2026</a> Lobster after midnight? That's how I cure my midnight munchies!   A whole 2-pound Maine Lobster (see picture!), bathed and poached in pig lard, with homemade tortillas, beans, rice, arbol salsa, and delicious cilantro butter. My only regret is that I ate dinner already so I couldn't gorge on ALL THIS FOOD! (This serves 2 btw!) The homemade tortillas were amazing; very light and fluffy, you could really taste the time and effort put in them. The Lobster dipped in the arbol salsa and the cilantro butter was the true meaning of calorie careless glutton!  The complimentary chips and salsa were also bomb! The chili verde salsa was incredibly addicting. Best of all, it's made fresh! That's what I like to see from other restaurants. Keep in mind that it was almost 1AM and the Don still delivered!  With so much win, do I even need to write about the service? Hell ya! Our server, Daniel, was the man! Hospitality skills off the roof. Our chips and salsa were replenished 3x without having to ask (that's how good the salsa was!), our drinks were never half empty, and was simply just a great friendly host that wasn't trying to rush our meal. Much kudos to him!  It's tough finding a good eatery pass midnight that doesn't invoke more alcohol consumption (even though the Don Pisto's does is also a small bar), but also serves damn good food. The menu is small but wild with many interesting and mouthwatering Latino fusions, like their signature Guacamole Hamburger, Raw Oysters, or even Mexican Sashimi (you heard right).   The hype is TRUE, and hands down, my new favorite Mexican joint. They also serve Brunch too!",

Once they have received your reservation request, they send you a set-menu from which you choose 5 of their ~15 AMAZING options.   Each member of the party pays $30 (before tax and tip), which includes a family style brunch served with the 5 items on the set menu, chips &amp; guacamole, and BOTTOMLESS mimosas, sangria, and margaritas. I strongly recommend the sangria!!   Christina was super helpful in organizing this birthday brunch, and the waitstaff was great!

Fresh avocado, a lot of it, with much less emphasis on the salsa on top. I always hate when most guacamoles are 3 parts salsa, one part avocado. This was the opposite.  2. Hamburguesa - I never would have ordered this at a Mexican food restaurant had it not been the server's recommendation. The meat is marinated in bacon and onions, so you get this amazingly flavored patty without the actual ingredients overpowering the meat itself. And instead of cheese on top, they put guacamole (see item 1) on it, which is a great addition. So good! 3. Carne Asada Tacos - melted in our mouths, the table loved 'em.  4. \u00a0Michelada - For those that like their drinks spicy but not tomatoey (like a blood mary), this is very good. \u00a0Perfect amount of zing, tastes great, and one will last you the meal!  The OK:  1. \u00a0Puerto Nuevo Lobster - this was actually very good lobster and the \"fixins\" (rice, beans, cilantro) were great! But for $39, we figured the money was better spent on other items that were equally good for a third the price. \u00a0  The BAD: 1. \u00a0Everything was pretty darn good! \u00a0I guess we could have done without the wait...  The Bottom Line - wonderful food, good cocktails (michelada!) and great service, with a nice yet casual vibe, this is a perfect weeknight dinner spot if you're willing to wait 30 minutes. This place gets 5 stars, not because it's the best meal I've ever had in SF, but because it's the best value I've had in SF.",

Then we had to get the guac and chips. \u00a0You get some freshly made guac along with the thick cut chips. \u00a0Good start.  We ordered the grilled calamari that came with a nice slaw. \u00a0Quite good and the calamari didn't feel chewy for having been grilled.  Next up we hit the tacos with the camarones, carne asada, and carnitas. \u00a0All were quite good and tasty. \u00a0Was definitely impressed  That turned out to be plenty for two and we stopped there, but everything else we saw going by looked darn tempting as well.  Service was excellent and we were promptly helped with the menus and orders.  All in, we came out at about $90. \u00a0Not bad all things considered.  I need to come back more often because the overall experience is quite authentic in feel and food / drinks rock. \u00a0There's a good mood here and is short of festive actually.  Definitely recommended.",

The service, while friendly and efficient, had some drawbacks, not necessarily its fault, though. \u00a0All the food came almost at once! \u00a0This is not good when you are enjoying a still-full bowl of piping hot soup. \u00a0I could not give up eating the delicious soup, so the tacos and elote got cold, a real shame.  The long line of patrons waiting for tables made me rush a bit and also contemplate a reservation policy that makes no sense to me: \u00a0there were several very big tables empty (the restaurants takes reservations for \"parties of six or more\") while all the while lots of folks were waiting for small tables. \u00a0Does this make sense?",

My group came here on a Tuesday night around 6pm for dinner. The restaurant was had a couple tables filled so pretty open in terms of seating. We had 5 people in our group so they put us at a 4 top. Seriously? We kinda sat for a bit making fun of the situation but in the end we did ask for a bigger table. Our server had to get the manager as its \"not my decision\" and the manager said they had a big party of 11 coming in at 815pm so they couldn't move us. Really? We had already sat down and ordered -- so we explained we will def be out before the large party so the manager agreed and moved two tables together for us so we could be seated comfortably. But how long do they expect people to sit at tables for -- our table would def be turned in about 1.5 hours. Anyways, for the food we wanted to try the tamales and the hamburger - but they weren't making them that night so \u00a0I ordered fish tacos. To my surprise when they came they were tiny (i guess some would call it street style tacos) but for $11, they should make them bigger or add a 3rd taco. My friend got the pork chop which was huge and made the rest of our tacos seem teeny tiny in comparison. We also ordered a pitcher of margaritas and boy were those super sweet! I did not like mine at all so I left half of it on the table. Overall the best thing I liked was the chips and salsa.....   Though i really liked the chips and salsa and my fish tacos were not bad... it would not bring me to come back here again.",

I enjoyed the hamburguesa, but I have had tastier tortilla soup and the fish tacos (snapper the night I went) were not that memorable though tasted like high quality, fresh ingredients.  They'll take reservations for groups of 6 of more, which makes meeting a group there easy though the restaurant was pretty loud for the far sides of the table to hear each other. There was also confusion on the bill - the menu states gratuity is automatically added to parties of 6+ so we assumed that it was in there when we got the check. However, the waitress had to tell us after we'd calculated it out that the gratuity was not included. I don't care which way it's done, but please pick one and be consistent on this. Given all this, I'd probably only go back with a small group.  Ok, last thing that just tipped me to give the 3 stars instead of the 4: the restaurant was almost suffocatingly smoky for the last part of our meal and as we were leaving, to the point it felt unpleasant in your throat. I assume this wasn't the norm and probably due to a kitchen mishap, but it was pretty unpleasant.",

Don Pistos is a cute little restaurant that I call secretive because it does not have any signs or awnings outside that indicates a restaurant.  The ambiance is very laidback, and restaurant is very airy feeling. Service was also great- we did not wait long and servers were quick without rushing/pressuring us, friendly without being annoying, and attentive without being overbearing.   The food here was amazing. I ordered the fish tacos, and the fish was perfectly cooked with the best cripsy crust. You only get two, but that was more than enough for me- the portion of fish was very generous and I was definitely satisfied after two. My BF ordered the breakfast burrito which was equally delicious- a little greasy, but that's expected with a breakfast burrito! The watermelon mimosa was delicious as well- they also offer a bottomless option which i wish I had opted for if it hadn't been for the rager I had the night before.   Will definitely be back!!",

Or it's one of the few places for mexican food that exist here.   I came on a Friday night and it took about an hour to get a table. The chips and salsa were good, but it took forever to refill on them. When we finally get a refill it was the leftover chips from another table that the waitress dumped into our bowl. I guess I was too hungry after waiting so long that I just ate it. \u00a0Then I ordered a few tacos and was left starving.  I had some shrimp tacos, yes there were real large shrimp in there, but they tasted like nothing flavorful. The tortilla fell apart on me and basically it all exploded. And what's up with NOT being able to get a burito? And no vegetarian friendly options AT ALL? If you're vegetarian, you'll be eating chips and salsa all night.   If you're LA purist who loves el cholo, olvera street, the holes in the wall, \u00a0or venture further down into San Diego for your mexican fixes, then Don PIsto will probably leave you disappointed. If you're here to feast on food then it won't be a good idea.   I'm giving the place two stars because it has a nice ambiance to it. It's a good place to throw back a few margaritas with your friends and be tipsy enough to not care about how the food tastes.",

    "review_text": "Hurried steps. A petite woman rushing through the door in a leopard skin string dress wearing white sunglasses. A man sitting by the bar, nursing an IPA, stood up to greet her. \"I'm so sorry I'm running late.\" She said. He stood up as she took her coat off, and as she hopped onto the barstool. It was a very crowded bar.   \"This was a very popular restaurant with no signage on the door. Like the French Laundry.\" She commented. The restaurant had two parts. One part was the communal table and bar area, the other part was a sit down dining area in a sunken \u00a0part of the space.  \"This reminds me of Ratskeller in Munich, by Marienplatz. The restaurant was built directly under the city hall, all sunken in.\" She continued.  Don Pisto was of course not a German nor Italian restaurant, it's Mexican street food located in the heart of North Beach. \"Does it look like where you just returned from?\" She asked. He was in Mexico vacationing with his son. \"No, but it felt like it should have been a very guy oriented restaurant. But there were quite a lot of women here.\" He responded. The decor was very masculine, no doubt, with open exposed bricks and fireplace for cooking. Surrounded by Italian restaurants in the heart of North Beach, this place felt like a welcoming home in Mexico, occupied by working class people, and you had just crashed their Saturday night supper party.  \"The restaurant did not take reservations.\" He said. He'd been here before once. \u00a0He struck her as someone who dined out a lot, alone or otherwise. Just then the host interrupted them and informed them that the communal table was ready. \u00a0The man asked to see if they could sit next to each other, rather than across from each other. Why wouldn't more restaurants insist on that? How could two people have a conversation over dinner if you were sitting across from each other at a noisy place where the only way to talk was to shout out from the top of your lungs? She thought to herself. The host immediately agreed and two new table settings were made for the two of them.  \"What's good here?\" She asked. \u00a0He studied menu and ordered her a glass of Sangria as if he could read her mind. It was very plum red, and very sweet. He took care of her as if he was the protagonist straight out of a Jane Austin novel, very old school. Even though they had only been friends for nearly two decades, even though she never needed anyone to take care of her, even though, she suspected, this was how he was with all of his female friends. The wait staff was very attentive and caught the dynamic very early on, so she directed her questions to this man. \"What would you guys like to eat?\" She asked. He said, \"Well, I suppose we should get the ceviche and the spicy tuna tacos. And pollo and posole.\" He decided for her. The restaurant served street food, therefore portion was well adjusted for that, a perfect way to share a meal with people without getting too stuffed and feeling guilty after.  When the posole was served, two bowls appeared with a separate plate for the herbs and spices. It was a stew dish, delightful and hearty, unpretentious and delicious. He used the ladle to scoop soup into her bowl first. She added spice and cilantro. Over that dish she learned that he was still in love with the woman he's been with for nearly three years. \"I am into her. I love her. I like her. She's perfect for me.\" \"No one's ever met 'her\", you know.\" She said. \"They know about her. The general stuff.\" He protested. This man who had never been married, was now in love and had been for sometime. Perhaps there was hope after all. But for whom she was not sure.  Turned out that all four things on the menu were exceptional. \u00a0The waitstaff brought the bill to the man. He opened his wallet to pay and she saw an older driver license picture of him. In the picture he had a broad smile, strikingly blond hair sans glasses. He had a carefree look about him, like a child. Not this man who's now sitting next to her, more reserved and a lot more serious.  A meal was ending. Simplistic street food in surprisingly non Hispanic neighborhood but completely out of this world delicious. Full bar menu, filled with Mexican and Californian beer to boot. \u00a0It was one of the best meals she's had recently.  \"Friday, I'm on Lufthansa to Frankfurt then Munich.\" She said. \"I'm on KLM to Amsterdam.\" He said. \"Perhaps we'd meet at the airport then.\" She said absent-mindedly. \"That would be neat.\" He replied.  They got up to leave, a half glass of sweet sangria left sitting unfinished on the table. It was a typical summer evening in San Francisco: fog was setting in, wind had picked up, and young people were out and about. At an atypical Mexican restaurant in North Beach: food, surprisingly authentic; goodbyes, reluctantly said; and a new journey, to be commenced.",

To the girl who said it needed more lime and salt, that's easily fixed by adding those ingredients yourself! I like the fact that they don't add too much salt because salt can be easily added but not removed.  Which brings me back to their tacos. The only reason why I don't give them a 5 is because their carnitas and al pastor are a little too salty for my taste, but still very flavorful. I have yet to try their other dishes but I'm looking forward to going back. I've already been there multiple times since I live in North Beach myself.

Although I won't go back, their brunch is fantastic.",

And I love creative Mexican food.  We sampled four different taco varieties, oysters, chips w/guac &amp; salsa, and pitchers of margaritas. $300 for five of us was high, considering what we ordered. Food wasn't bad, but not off the charts either. Flavor was lacking, except for the guac which was outstanding. Service was great, the waitress kept her cool with the packed dining room.  Just know, don't go for an intimate romantic evening, or hope to carry on a conversation with someone across the table--this place is crazy noisy.  I've heard the brunch is great, maybe it's better?

Best possibly-sketchy decision I've made 2009. Pete cooks us up Niman Ranch steak tacos...street style - AMAZING!!! Then, Pete says, \"let me cook you up some fish tacos\"...um...SURE! \u00a0But these were not your everyday fish tacos, Grilled Swordfish tacos (he offers battered &amp; fried too). \u00a0Wait, am I delusional? \u00a0No sir, this is a real deal yummy in my tummy .   Generosity and kindness is live and well in this wicked world. Pete, the owner, is by far one of the greater people I've met in SF, he offered us drinks, and asked if we wanted more food...it was soo good i really wanted to, but the fact that he even offered us free food/beer/soda was filling enough and we didn't want to take advantage of the sampling offer.  All I can say is I really wish the best for Pete and his new baby DON PISTOS. Best Cool Taqueria in North Beach. \u00a0I look forward to being a reg here and trying the rest of the menu. The spot is a hidden gem, very low key, but UBER COOL vibe inside. \u00a0I love the exposed brick and simple modern art. \u00a0There will be a spot down stairs for small/private events. \u00a0Keep an eye out for the grand opening.",

For those of you with a bottomless pit (sorry, I just had to go there), they have a short brunch menu filled with delicious items from the huge french toast with bacon, savory chorizo and eggs, hearty breakfast burrito and even a juicy burger topped with avocado.

Their burger (which I heard they only serve on Wednesdays) was also incredible, and absolutely worth coming here for. The bun in particular was bready yet light -- a great complement to the tender meat patty smeared with avocado and cheese.  Unfortunately, the one taco I tried (with pineapple and pork) was very mediocre, especially for the price.   The restaurant is charming, but not anything special.

I never would've even known about this place if it weren't for 7x7's delicious list of things to eat in San Francisco for 2011. And who would've expected a delicious Mexican restaurant in North Beach?!  My party of 4 arrived here sometime before 7pm, which was PERFECT because the restaurant started to really fill up between 7 and 7:30. We didn't know what to expect when we read that it was a restaurant mainly specializing in Mexican food. I didn't know to expect if it would be one of those delicious but filthy looking places in the Mission, or something generic like Chevy's.  Don Pistos definitely stands out as its own kind of Mexican restaurant, with a slightly dim classy feel that reminded me of a tavern, but festive enough that it was like other Mexican restaurants.  The servers were very attentive and good about checking up on us through the evening to make sure that we didn't need anything.  They start you off by serving you some chips and salsa. It's not just any kind of salsa though. It's the green chile salsa with a slight bit of spice and bursting with flavor. I know I ate almost all of it and hogged it from my friends. For our meals, we ordered the carnitas tacos (small but delicious) and the hamburguesa, which was the dish listed on the 7x7 food list.  The hamburguesa was AMAZING! It's a meat patty that has been marinated in bacon and onions, topped with house-made guacamole, served on (what I think is) a brioche bun. When I took a bite out of it, I felt like it was just melting in my mouth. I would definitely order it again. And it was only $9!!!  Next time, I want to try other things on the menu because everything smelled so good there. Looking at the other tables, you can see just how delicious the food is. As we left around 8pm, there was a large group of people congregating in the front, waiting for tables to free up.  Get here early! They only make reservations for parties of 6 or more!",

Chips/salsa was salty, just the way I like them (had three \"yelpings\") \u00a0Normally at Don Pisto, they push their lime afficionado mentality but I think with lime at $100 a case vs $20 last year, they've toned it done. (hah) .... \u00a0  Also noticed that there was three families there... so I guess if you have crying or loud kids; in this noisy place, no one will notice. There were four obnoxious twenty odd old guys louder than heck while we were there. \u00a0Did I say that the pork chop was greatttt??  Time I arrived was on a Friday at 5:30pm .. found a parking space, was immediately seated and had a great blonde cute server who went extra mile. \u00a0(btw, I am a girl making a statement and my guy was not THAT cute to warrant the extra service, so I think it was either me or she's just good at her job : ). I tipped 25%  Oh I forgot... they just opened a new place \u00a0called Pisto's Taco around the corner on 1310 Grant near my favorite burger place Mo's .... and I walked by it .. seems more bar and bar food place \u00a0(cheaper menu) and will review that one soon too.",

They had a bouncer outside checking ids and it was really loud inside. I felt like I was at a day club.   We all started with the bottomless mimosas ($17), which are made with fresh pineapple juice. Super yummy! They have servers making their rounds to make sure your glass is always filled to the brim :)   My friend's Huevos Rancheros ($9) was my favorite. Great flavor and perfectly cooked eggs.  My friend's Chorizo and Poached Eggs ($10) was pretty good. Great flavor and I'm usually not a fan of chorizo.  My Mushroom Omlette ($10) was really nothing special. It had a ton of oaxaca but wasn't really memorable.  We were all really obsessed with their side of potatoes. Perfectly crisp and well seasoned! Mmmm  If I was going to come back for bottomless mimosas though, I'd definitely choose the Radish. The mimosas aren't as good but the food is so much better.",

The place hardly has the linoleum feel of your standard neighborhood trattoria like those found in the Mission, rather it's a sleek, nondescript, minimalist, red-brick room with no sign on the outside. \u00a0It's best to keep this place secret because the food is simply outstanding- authentic, fresh, and executed perfectly. \u00a0I've tried many taco-al-pastors throughout the years and Don Pisto's is the best. \u00a0The burger, mussels, seafood items, and tortilla soup are all top-notch. \u00a0Every ingredient is fresh and used in just the right amounts and balance. \u00a0Combine this food with reasonable prices and a decent alcohol selection and I've officially found my favorite Mexican joint in SF.",

Like many have said already, I never would have noticed the place if I hadn't walked past it tens of times before leaning my head in. \u00a0The best sounds always come out from the doors -- the kinds of sounds that lead one to believe that everyone's having a good time! \u00a0So, one day, I bit.  And I've continued to bite for months, through most of the menu. \u00a0My new favorite is the chorizo and mussels -- very delectable and satisfying! \u00a0The tortilla soup is crazy good (especially with the large chunks of avocado). \u00a0When I'm feeling like tacos, I go straight for the al pastor (and all that roasted pineapple!). \u00a0When I'm lucky enough to make it for brunch, I always order the tacos sonora -- hey Pete, are you going to offer this on the normal menu anytime soon? \u00a0I'd order it! \u00a0I wash it down with either a great Mexican beer or a Mexican Coke with lime and I'm easily on the road to Extreme Dinner Contentment.

We also split the wild Monterey calamari, which was my favourite because it was grilled rather than fried. \u00a0If you have an issue with weird textures, I wouldn't order this, though.  The boys' favourite was the poc chuc, which was a huge grilled pork rib. \u00a0I don't usually eat pork, but this was worth trying. \u00a0The meat was tender, juicy, and probably not all that healthy for you... but I'm not sure what you're doing at a place like this if you're trying to be healthy.  Anyway, we topped it off by splitting a 32oz corona, and it came out to $73 in total for 3 people or $24 a person. \u00a0Pretty awesome.  Word on the street is that they also don't like groups bigger than 4.",

Our server was very friendly and explained the small but effective menu. Our waters and drink orders were brought out right away along with our chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were very delicious. Freshly fried tortilla chips salted just right with a green verde salsa that was beyond delicious with the right amount of spice. I started off with a bowl of the chicken tortilla soup. The temperature of the soup was perfect and the broth was delicious, not too salty not too bland. My entree was an order of shrimp tacos. You can tell the tortillas are freshly made in house. The tacos were loaded with fresh, non fishy shrimp and tons of garlic cilantro and that green verde sauce. Our tab was less than 40 dollars!!! It was an all around awesome experience and the next time I am visiting San Francisco I will definitely be eating here again! Los Angeles needs to get with the program and open up a gourmet Mexican place such as son pistos",

The chips were delish and I loved their salsa verde. The guac was also amazing!   They had a nice taco menu (I got to try one and they were really great), but what really blew me away was their hamburguesa (also, their item that's on the 7x7 list). Oh my goshhhhh this was the best hamburger I've ever had, I think. They cook it perfectly medium rare in bacon grease and onions (or something like that), so it had a slight hot dog-y flavor?? Not sure what it was, but it was so effing good! Served on a toasted bun with guac spread on top.. and that was it! I am salivating right now just thinking about it...  Also had some sort of tequila shooter at the end of the night (something mixed with pineapple something or other? not sure at this point..) but it was delicous nonetheless.  This is an awesome place for a birthday or get-together with a group of friends. It's not super stuffy, but also not dirty/dive-y.. perfect for Friday nights!",

The upstairs has a cool space, although we were seated downstairs (which has bigger tables and is probably better for groups). \u00a0It was very loud and somewhat warm, although it was an unseasonably warm day in SF so I can forgive that. \u00a0Service was average, although they were very attentive at constantly refilling the chips (maybe to draw our attention away from the small-ish portions).  All in all it was fine but I've had much better Mexican food in SF. \u00a0Like so many places in SF this seems to be overhyped and overrated. \u00a0Next time I'll go to Tacolicious, Mamacita, or Tropisueno instead. \u00a0That said, I've heard great things about the brunch and may give them another try to check that out.",

I'm sorry but we didn't just wait 1.5 hours to \"eat a f*cking omelette\" as my friend put it.   (2) Out of Salsa? What the heezy? Have you ever heard of McDonald's running out of ketchup?  (3) Out of Lobster, Ceviche, and Carne Asada (limited dinner menu with just 3 entrees). They must have ran out of salt too because everything we ate was ridiculously bland.   (4) Flavorless Guacamole ($6) that makes Chipotle's seem authentic. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE8DTKsTFi1Vzm_zzd0Q?select=rz8P6fmmReZyJkObNhdLag#lmRX6fjCWarKG3FSkNiGhQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE\u2026</a>  (5) Bland and watery Chicken Tortilla Soup ($12). <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE8DTKsTFi1Vzm_zzd0Q?select=rz8P6fmmReZyJkObNhdLag#9p5VdUBHtzZ5fwnkUJPBCQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE\u2026</a>  (6) 7x7's Hamburguesa ($11) that was well-done and tasted like a meatloaf. As whacked as the 7x7 list itself. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE8DTKsTFi1Vzm_zzd0Q?select=rz8P6fmmReZyJkObNhdLag#y9DbC7QcCwQTKlSfZplTwA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE\u2026</a> \u00a0  (7) Weak, fruitless Sangria.   Perhaps they forgot to go grocery shopping that day and the kitchen was having an \"off\" day but the icing on the whacked cake was the service. After waiting for 1.5 hours, we wanted to enjoy our dinner. Instead, we were rushed in and out the door in 31 minutes (yes, I timed it). As we sat down, our waiter hurriedly said, \"you guys are my last table....are you ready to order?\" Slow your roll, Mr. Testaverde, we didn't even get a chance to breathe much less look at the menu.   $38 later, I wished we went to The Mission for AUTHENTIC Mexican food instead.   W-H-A-C-K-E-D.  OTHER NOTES: *To my dear Yelpy friends who gave Don Pisto's 4-5 Stars, please don't hate me.  *I'm a fan of their sister restaurant, Chubby Noodle (my review: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/chubby-noodle-san-francisco-2#hrid:xM00NZ1lOYfL-Zqpu0093w\">yelp.com/biz/chubby-nood\u2026</a>). *Reservations only taken for party of 6 or more. *Expect 1-1.5 hour wait on weekends. *Small bar area with 5 seats. No hard liquor available that night.  *Tight and cramped seating for about 30 people in dining room and 5 communal tables in lower dining area. *Street parking is atrocious.",

    "review_text": "My friend told us we were going to this \"little taco place down the street\" and I totally thought we were going to some hole in the wall taqueria. This is definitely not that.   This place was pretty hopping for a Saturday night at midnight. It is EXTREMELY loud inside but I loved the ambiance. Its really dark inside and while there were candle things on every table, none of them were lit.   We had waters and chips and salsa set on our table immediately. The chips looked like they were made in house and the salsa was just okay. It tasted too much like lime for my liking. I got the red snapper tacos even though I wasn't the least bit hungry. My friends ordered the carnitas and another ordered the ceviche. The waitress explained how the kitchen was extremely small and the food doesn't come out at the same time or something. It was hard to hear her but I don't think it was a big deal. Haha. The ceviche ended up coming out last which my friend said was really spicy.   The fish was cooked perfectly and it might just be because I wasn't hungry but I thought the tacos were just okay. The portions look small but the tacos are extremely filling. They all came with radishes and a pepper on the side. Neither of which I tried.   Service was fantastic. We had a great waitress. I think it ended up being around $60 for 4 entrees and two beers.   Oh and right after this we ended up chasing a hobo into Chinatown after he stole money out of an ATM after my friend left her card in the machine. Haha ohhhh North Beach =D",

Apparently all their food is organic here, something I didn't know till after. \u00a0Their menu is small, but that's probably a good thing since it allows them to focus on bringing quality instead of quantity which they definitely do! \u00a0I wanted to try the tacos, but since their hamburguesa is on the 7x7 list, I was obligated to get that and am happy I did! \u00a0I'm not a burger person in general and this one was only bun, patty, and guac but it was easily one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had! \u00a0I think there is bacon in their patty? \u00a0Bacon makes everything taste better IMO. \u00a0The patty was very tender and cooked to perfection while the buns they use is out of this world. \u00a0I couldn't pinpoint exactly why I liked it so much but it wins for best buns! \u00a0The only problem I had with my meal was that the margaritas were pretty weak. \u00a0Not sure if that's a regular thing.  Either way, I'll def be back to try out their tacos next time since I was eyeing my friend's during the entire meal.",

    "review_text": "Nestled along the quiet corner of Union and Grant, Don Pisto's is the unsung hero of contemporary Mexican cuisine of North Beach. The interior from two dining rooms front and back are fairly small in all its brick lined glory, solidifying a guaranteed intimate experience just perfect for dates and small groups. I've partaken in the Don Pisto's journey before in small doses and encounters, but never to organizing a large dinner for coworkers and friends for what was an incredible experience from start to finish.  I owe it all to their incredible host Christine. She was the glue, kept the gears moving and was so professional and efficient throughout the process. After an initial call to setup, along with a barrage of back and forth emails customizing a menu with our logo and inserting various items with respect to dietary habits; everything was done within an hour. Upon learning that this was no ordinary group dining event (going away party as well), she took it upon herself to also pick up and store a cake that we had waiting in the wings. If that's not top notch service, I don't know what it is. Above all, she made me look damn good to the group and all I did was make a quick phone call.  When we had arrived, it was clear which table was ours - we were dead center and 16 seats deep in almost communal fashion. The main dining area was already small to begin with, considerably scaled back with our large group absorbing much of the scene. We weren't the classiest bunch of individuals, just the ones everyone wanted to sit with. And in the corner, smiling from afar, was Christina - plotting every little bit of our meal and getting us everything that we needed without even having to ask. It was a symphony of service and she was the leader of the orchestra.  Meanwhile our table was an endless river of sangria and giggles. The company was good it almost seemed as nothing else mattered. Our meal table was full of hits too numerous to mention, highlights include:  * Delectable shrimp taco, cooked perfectly and wonderfully juicy on a soft corn tortilla. * Mexican sashimi, with a twist of lime and cilantro and we're off to the races * Oysters, as fresh as they get from the bay. * Lobster is succulent and tasty, but very different to share. * Al Pastor was as good as advertised. Tender bits of rib chop, with the zest of pineapple.  The evening was a success. We ordered extra pitchers of sangria as the night went on, and before we knew it, it had been over 3 hours. Throughout the time we never rushed and service was stellar to the very end. Christine thanked us on the way out and even sent a follow up email the next day to offer her token of appreciation. After some cake, more sangria, a group photo, more sangria, and feeling stuffed beyond galore, we still managed to rock the rest of the night.  Don Pisto's gets nothing less than 5 stars for service alone. Throw everything else in the mix (ambiance, food, price,etc.) and you've got yourself a spectacular spot for just about anything.",

They also seemed to accommodate dietary restrictions (vegetarian, dairy-free, etc.) well.   Overall, I thought the food and drinks were all very good: -- Margaritas and Sangria by the pitcher: I only had the margarita, which I thought was just fine.  -- Chips, Tomatillo Salsa and Guacamole: Delicious! The tomatillo salsa has a kick.  -- Ceviche: Fresh and flavorful bit big chunks of shrimp, tomato, avocado... -- Calamari: Grilled, not fried! -- Fish Tacos: This was my favorite dish. A nice chunk of fish atop corn tortilla and topped with a cabbage slaw and some sort of dairy sauce.  -- Chicken Tostadas: Crispy tortilla topped with moist, chopped chicken. Tasty.  -- Carnitas Tacos: I didn't try one of these but it looked good. I was just too full at that point.  Aside from the food, the music was our JAM (90s hip hop/rap/dance hits). The downstairs room, where our group of 10 was seated, along with a few other large groups, was WARM. They had lots of fans and such but it was still uncomfortable. Service was good but seemed to stall at times, without good pacing between courses and we had to request additional drinks and wait a while for those refills.",

Except my friend built up the hype and told me this sucker was 1/2 a pound of meat...which, I don't think it was. But it was a pretty decent burger. \u00a0They can split it in half or quarters for sharing. Between our 3 people...it was harder. ha.  Burger - quite delicious. I'd like it a little more medium (or at least have SOME pink). I'd guess its not possible, since they have bacon inside it, and that needs to be well cooked. The burger has a huge layer of guac on it, and it just adds to the fatty drool-worthy ness of the dish.  The mussels in chorizo broth was so delicious. It comes with some buttered and grilled bread, which they can refill for you. It's so delicious. The shellfish is cooked perfectly, and the sauce is a little spicy, but to a level that just makes you keep going for more. We kept trying to sop up more sauce while also digging around the bottom to find chunks of chorizo. I wish I had a spoon.  The salmon sashimi....was amazing. Like, amazing. They had the freshest slices of salmon, sitting on a bed of sauce (white wine vinegar and soy sauce), with thin slices of jalapenos, cilantro, and I'm sure something else. It was just...delicious. I'd say its a must-order.  We also had a pitcher of their margaritas, which was good...but not for that price. There was a little too much ice put in there, and unless you're drinking it all in 10 minutes, it gets diluted pretty quickly.  Service was very good - our waitress was great about being attentive without being too pushy. Environment is a little intimate, but it seems good for larger parties as well. The bathroom...is in an awkward location around the corner from the kitchen, down some stairs. But is fine. Overall, a pretty good experience!",

The calamari app was good, the tacos were great and the guacamole was fantastic. But for $9 for 2 tacos (carnitas or carne asada), they need to be worth it and they weren't. They had 2 tablespoons of meat on a small corn tortilla. I also tried the fish tacos which were awesome (they're grilled!) but again, a really small piece of cod.

    "review_text": "Don Pistos is a great addition to the North Beach dining scene. In a sea of mediocre Italian restaurants, a solid Mexican spot is just what the neighborhood needed. And that's exactly what it is, nothing groundbreaking but a solid neighborhood joint.  The menu is small but everything on it sounded enticing. We ordered with our eyes instead of our heads (aka ordered way too \u00a0much food) and tried:  -ceviche of the day: shrimp with chunks of avocado -carne asada tacos (we wanted carnitas but they ran out) -pollo asado tacos -hamburguesa: they had me at marinated in bacon and onions!  The tacos came two to an order with a side of pickled chilies/carrots and were surprisingly large. The chicken was a clear winner over the steak, probably the first time I've ever uttered that phrase.  The ceviche was also a nice portion and had a great, acidic bite. It was served with homemade chips which were really tasty but served cold...I would have preferred the chips warm. We were also offered some chips and salsa as we sat at the bar waiting for our table. Nice touch.  Now, the hamburguesa. I don't know what got in to me to order a burger at a Mexican restaurant but it was definitely the right decision! Slathered in guacamole and served on a soft bun, this is a must order for the burger lover.  Service was over the top friendly, though we asked for our food to be paced it did come pretty much all at once. I'll chalk that up to opening month issues. Also, the menu doesn't offer your typical Mexican restaurant options - no enchiladas, no tamales, no three combo platters. Don Pistos is sticking to the upscale street food theme and with food this good, I think they are really on to something.   Bonus points for being open late (12:30am during the week, 1am on the weekends) and have a large selection of Mexican beer! No margaritas, unfortunately, but next time I'll be sampling the sublime looking sangria.",

Will go back someday. Family style Mexican menu is also very cool. \u00a0There will be a wait not sure on reservations.  Food- 5 Stars Amazing tortilla soup, HUGE portion (seriously, a meal in itself for 2 people)   Good tacos and great tostadas  Drinks- 4 Stars Great Acai Sangria and good beers. Very small bar they do the most they can with it.  Atmosphere- 4 Stars Loud but fun. Seems like a good date place although there was one loud ass party of 8 or so there when we were there that occasionally made it too loud to talk comfortably.  Value- 5 Stars.  Cheap as hell considering the amount of food, the quality, and the location.  Service- 4 Stars. Very good and timely. Cute never hurts either.",

We explained that we did not expect service until opening, just wanted to wait inside.

That was great and all, except I noticed when we arrived, that he was running the restaurant more like a night club. I'm pretty sure we got seated anyway in the order that we arrived in, so nothing that fancy or special there. I did hear him mention to another couple that it was an hour and a half wait...at 9 pm on a Saturday. I couldn't believe people were still eating that late!  When we got inside it smelled delicious, albeit, was super hot! We really enjoyed the margaritas but were pretty surprised to see the less then extensive menu. For a Mexican place, I have seen hole in the wall places with more food than this place offered.   The waitress was very nice and attended to us rather quickly. She answered all of our questions and I would definitely give them a thumbs up on service.  Everyone in the group got tacos of some sort. Usually when people order a taco \"meal\" there are three small ones. This place only delivered two, and they were tiiiinnnyyy! Seriously, my boyfriend took his down in two bites, but probably could have managed one. They were also super greasy which is not my preference. I thought $11 for two tacos was pretty expensive, but I also do recognize the area and apparently the hype.  All in all, I don't think I'd visit again having had the \"experience\". The food was good, but it was tiny portions, and it's not really worth the wait, especially in SFO where you can find just as great of places that are cheaper and you don't have to \"know somebody\" to get in!",

I normally don't like Sangria because it's too sweet but this Sangria was tasty and cheap! Hard to pass up.  My table ordered the chicken enchiladas, steak and eggs, and shrimp tacos. I would recommend ordering a few things for the table and sharing. The tacos are definitely a lighter choice than the main dishes. Next time, I want to get the tortilla soup because it looked awesome.  Overall, the food is great and it's inexpensive. The ambiance is great for a young group - it's dark and sexy.

It's always fun, flavoursome and the service is terrific with that great mix of friendliness and authority (ie. \"how about I just order you two serves of the octopus and a jug of margarita to get you started?\"). With more than a few people in your dining group, having a waiter who can tell you what to do means you eat quickly and there's none of those stupid conversations about what to order.  Start with chips and salsa and a side of guac. Then move on to ceviche, octopus and the must oder mussels with chorizo. Trust me, you'll want to stab your dining partners for the last slurp of the rich broth in the bottom of the bowl. I've tried replicating this dish at home and it never lives up to the deliciousness that is served here.  Finish with some tacos to fill out any gaps in your stomach before you shuffle out the door.

There are better places in SF to get similar tacos and upscale food which I believe are better than Don Pisto's.

A failed attempt for dinner at Limon brought us all the way from Mission to North Beach, where we luckily scored a parking space on a Saturday night. Don Pistos was bustling with pretty people, making us feel short and inadequate. We were not dressed in our best Saturday night attire as we had just come back from the suburbs of Sacramento. This place is perfect for pre-clubbing eats or group dinners (they have a separate area for groups). The guy who helped us, who I assume was the manager, was point on with his service. We ordered the sangria with our food and when he noticed the food came out before our drinks, he comped us for the drinks. Unexpected but really nice!  The meal came with complementary freshly made chips and salsa. We opted to add guacamole ($5), which added to the experience. LOTS of guac = happy Tina. The sangria was good, though a bit too much for my sensitive EtOH tolerance. The mango ceviche <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE8DTKsTFi1Vzm_zzd0Q?select=fMFrwqnVqwdPYby8Ijqmpg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE\u2026</a>: AMAZING. Must get for sure. Sweet pieces of juicy mango with tuna drizzled with the perfect amount of lime juice. I would come back again for this.  Our group also had the tacos (carne asada, camarones). Greasier than we would have liked but still good. The Hamburgesa (burger marinated with bacon, onions, guac) was also good.  Overall, very hip Mexican street food joint. Definitely more expensive than your typical taco joint but it's all about the experience. Plus, their ceviche is delish!",

Fine, I get it, you don't want people sitting at your tables all day, not a huge deal.   A little after that, they started charging for chips.

My entree was the pollo asado which came with mini tortillas, guac, and a very flavorful salsa verde (ask for their hotter salsa to spice it up, also very tasty. The pollo had a glaze over it and fell apart very easily into pieces, which made my taco building that much easier. Very small menu, but smart because everything is made to perfection. Do yourself a favor and stop in while you're in the area.",

Very nice indoor design, I feel like it's a place where you could celebrate any sort of occasion or just go out on a date. \u00a0Be warned though, it's important to get there early as they do tend to have longer waits and parking in the area is a nightmare.

It just feels like something is missing. \u00a0True, they don't have a liquor license and so technically the liquor is missing. \u00a0And yes, the kitchen is extremely small and they don't have dessert options. \u00a0And maybe there isn't a sign on the outside of the building so you could say that is missing, but I prefer it that way. \u00a0But, I don't really hold any of those things against them. \u00a0It's something else.   Maybe it's just that I wasn't blown away by anything that I had to eat here. \u00a0Not to say things weren't delicious though. \u00a0They were. \u00a0Just not all that memorable for me, which I had hoped for.

The restaurant is tucked away in a residential neighborhood, and if one wasn't paying attention the storefront would easily be missed. The ambiance was simple; a dark space with mood lighting, lots of chit chatting, and the smell of food and smoke wafting from the open kitchen.  We ordered the \"Hamburgesa\" and \"Poc Chuc\".   The \"Hamburgesa\" was different, definitely not the typical version we are used to. It has a slightly smokey flavor to the meat. While it is tasty, I don't think it'd be something I'd particularly crave for. It was lacking something, maybe needed more guacamole, to balance the savoriness of the beef.   The \"Poc Chuc\" was much better. It had a bold flavor and cooked perfectly. For $17 (versus $25+ that I've seen at other places), I thought the pork chop was a good value as the chop was quite large.   Overall I enjoyed my dining experience here at Don Pisto's. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit, but the \"Poc Chuc\" would definitely be the thing to entice me to do so.",

The other weekend we happened to be starving in North Beach around 5:45 so decided to cross Don Pisto's off the list. Good thing too, because a little after 6 and there starts to be a wait.   + Loved the beer list. Pretty much any Mexican beer you could want.  + Chips and salsa - yum! The salsa is a green tomatillo and is very tasty.  + The tortilla soup was just okay - the one I make is better (thanks to Rick Bayless's Sopa Azteca recipe).  + Now, on to the hamburguesa... yum. whatever you've heard about it is probably true. The beef is a different consistency than most burgers (more like a meatloaf? hard to describe), it's cooked all the way through but still very moist. It's topped with creamy guacamole. The bun is soft and a little sweet like a torta bun. We decided that it's a perfect thing to split -- too delicious and rich to eat the whole thing. But definitely a must-order. + If you have a large group reservation, there is a huge private room downstairs -- don't worry if the main part of the restaurant looks small!   There are a lot of delicious options for sharing and the Mexican beer list is great, but what I really like about Don Pisto's though, is that it's a great value.

Well, this time we beat the system by having a large group and therefore being able to make reservations! Yay!  We got free chips and green salsa to start with, which was super fresh and hot (well, the chips were. The salsa temperature was normal). The chips were those fatty kinds that have a double layer with air in between. They were also extremely accommodating and kept refilling our chips and salsa whenever we asked, and also provided multiple plates for our large table. Waitress was really friendly and joked around with us.  I got the Hamburguesa, as well as the Sangria. I like white Sangria better, so this one was kind of strong flavored for me. I liked the flavors of the Hamburguesa, but couldn't really get over how...soft the patty was. I've never had a hamburger where there wasn't some part that was hard. The Hamburguesa is like biting into a mushy meat and guac cloud. My friend said that that was how you could tell the patty was freshly made and homemade, since it was soft (he also mentioned that it's cooked in bacon grease), but I'm still not into the texture.

Dinner: What don't I love on the menu? \u00a0Guac is delish but I love to start by splitting the Tortilla Soup. \u00a0It is killer and can be shared by up to 4 people. \u00a0Because everything is so good here, I like to come with a group and share many dishes. \u00a0Even with free flowing drinks and a group, I rare spend more than $40/person.   - Chorizo mussels ($14) : perfect for when I have eaten too many chips and salsa. \u00a0Don't be fooled by the description of white wine sauce - the chorizo gives it a rich flavor perfect for soaking up with the bread  - Machaca beef &amp; eggs ($17 ish)- tender juicy marinated shredded beef with a perfectly cooked egg on top to be scooped into warm home made tortillas. \u00a0Perfection.  - Chili verde chicken tostadas ($11) - light refreshing and crunchy. \u00a0Love the side of beans. \u00a0  - Carnitas tacos ($8) - just yummmm  They serve beer and wine only but manage to make good margaritas somehow. \u00a0But the sangria is even better.",

So we saw they were open till 12 and headed over. This place used to be El Raigon an Argentine steak joint back in the day. Still exposed brick walls and dimly lit, theyve kept the same vibe. Friendly bartender-server sat us by the window. After looking at the fairly concise menu we went with:  -Grilled Monterey calamari -Carne asada tacos -House made chorizo and mussels -Poc chuc  Id say the tacos were somewhat average and for the price many taquerias and trucks will do you morejustice however the other dishes were very well executed. Seafood perfectly cooked and the pork for the Poc Chuc had a great crust and still juicy internally. Te application of citrus and chili was also well done.   The patrons seemed to be twenty somethings in large groups for this night. Service is solid and obviously the line can produce great food. 4.3 stars",

Came here a few weeks back when my cousin was in town and stopped by Don Pisto's at 11:30pm to get some dinner. He had a late work event and I was actually at an awesome Yelp event until pretty late.   The place was relatively empty except for a few people at the bar and a couple tables so the service was friendly and fast. Unfortunately, they had ran out of a few of the dishes since we came so late which was a bummer, but still had enough options for us to order.  Personally, I had the fish tacos which were REALLY good. The fish was not fried (which is key!) and the slaw provided the perfect tartness. Even after a 5 course meal, I happily ate both of these. :) We also had the guacamole appetizer and may I say, the guac is solid. Super fresh and clear that they had just made it for us moments after ordering.   I'll definitely be back to Don Pisto's for all my late night needs. I haven't tried their brunch yet but given the reviews, I think I'll be going pretty soon!",

    "review_text": "If you greet me with sangria and margarita, the odds are high that I'll like you. I like you, Don Pisto's. First of all, the main dining room isn't that large. For the people who just dropped in and expect to be seated in a reasonable amount of time... on the weekend... in San Francisco... just... no. Think, people. Think. It's not going to happen to and to fault the restaurant when reservations are possible... well, that just doesn't make a lot of sense. Chastising out of the way...  What impressed me the most about DP's (heh) wasn't the food, although it ranged from decent to pretty good (I didn't partake in the lobster taco extravaganza; I was trying to be cost-conscious). What left such a positive impression on me was the service. You know that study that says that service is the crucial element in a dining experience and that people will come back and recommend a resto with okay food and excellent service over one with stellar food and crappy service? It's true. It's 100% true. I came here with an unwieldy group of loud eaters and drinkers. Not only did our waitress handle us with a smile, she was on top of orders, drinks, plates, and silverware the entire time. I was impressed. Whereas I, likely, would have been chain-smoking out back if faced with our motley crew, she smiled, joked and navigated our table with the ease of a consummate professional. For her alone, I would come back and recommend (with reservations for a definite seating) it to others. However, since man can't live on service alone (heh), I've gotta tell you to try the shrimp tacos and al pastor tacos. The pollo asado is pretty tasty, as well -- even for those folks who recoil at the thought of ordering a chicken dish when going out to/for dinner. But, truthfully, everything tastes better with a belly full of sangria AND margarita, so be sure not to skimp on the libations. Don Pisto's is a terrific party if you do it the right way.",

    "review_text": "I am as guilty as charged when it comes to judging books by their covers. This same notion is also applied when judging restaurants by their appearances. I've never been a \"hole in the wall\" type of lady, so exterior and interior design could be the final reigning factor when trying to figure out where to dine at. With Don Pisto's, I was sold the moment we drove by.   Don Pisto's is discretely located in the North Beach neighborhood on Union street adjacent to a sweet little alley way. The missing restaurant signage and all cream brick facade made Don Pisto's even more mysterious and intriguing. I was unsure of what promises a signless restaurant could hold, but was convinced that the crowd of people that congregated at the front meant the place was popular. Once inside, we were encompassed by dim lighting, red brick walls and a noisy atmosphere. Somehow the chill vibe with a side of chips and salsa accompanied by a strong marg seemed perf for that night's dinner. Although the estimated wait time was about an hour ten, we decided to list our names and grab a couple of drinks at nearby bars since there were several that were walking distance from the restaurant.   Four beers and an hour later, we finally received a call letting us know Don Pisto was ready for us. We settled for the Wild Monterey Calamari, House-made Chorizo Mussels and Carne Asada tacos all washed down with some margs and cerveza and devoured with a side of chips and spicy chile verde salsa. I was impressed with the calamari. I automatically assumed the calamari would be the typical deep fried battered rings of goodness, however much to my surprise (and my inability to read menu descriptions) the calamari was grilled and served on metal skewers. Although I am obsessed with the usual deep fried calamari rings, I absolutely loved Don's take on grilled calamari. Also, I am not the biggest fan of radish, however the radish salad that accompanied the calamari was quite delectable.   So why three stars? Unfortunately the carne asada taco just couldn't win me over. The taco was drenched with the essence of arbol chile salsa. Now me and spice we have a civil relationship. There's a limit to how much spice I can take, perhaps one can still label me as a novice. Jalapenos, good. Arbol chiles, bad. Very bad. The first bite I took seemed promising until those small hints of heat escalated into a raging fire in my mouth. I wanted to cry, I wanted to die, I wanted to drench my tongue with loads of milk and forget that arbol chile salsa ever entered my mouth. Two bites into my taco and I threw in the towel. I could not manage the spicy no matter how hard I tried. Fortunately our server was very kind and understanding about my lack of tolerance towards absurd heat. She quickly brought out another serving of tacos with less spice, however by the time that was brought out my appetite was already lost. I tried to abate any remnants of heat by devouring everything else in front of me -- mussels, chips, chips and more chips, which ultimately resulted in me being too full to manage even one bite of the second serving of tacos.   Despite the end of my dinner ending with such unfortunate events I was really impressed with the service at Don Pisto's. I truly appreciated how our server tended to that heat mishap and continued to provide such benevolent service.",

My faves were Al Pastor tacos, Carne Asada tacos, Shrimp tacos, and Fatty Lamb Ribs. \u00a0The Hamburguesa was huge in size and had a nice twist to the typical hamburger but I probably won't order again because there are better options. \u00a0The sashimi was fresh but the portion was a bit small. \u00a0Guac was tasty though I enjoyed the free green salsa much more.   Do not sleep on Don Pisto's. \u00a0The food &amp; drinks are nothing short of amazing. \u00a0We'll definitely return... hopefully for brunch.

It's nit picky, but whoever built the bar, built it a bit too high for most patrons to sit comfortably and eat. I am 6'1, and it was still high. Get higher chairs guys.   On to the food. The chips and salsa was a purchase at $3. Kind of expected to be free at most Mexican restaurants. They give you green salsa, which is good tasting, but I generally prefer a tomato salsa. I had the Tortilla soup to start, and it was very good. It was a good size portion perfect for sharing (as it mentions on the menu). My main was the Pollo Asado. The chicken was fresh and organic, but had no real flavor other than the chicken flavor. Not much \"asado\". The dish comes with a proper red salsa, which is what should have come with the chips in the first place. Also comes with green onions. No rice or beans. For $18, a little more garnish on the plate would be appreciated  Props to the bartender Nick who was welcoming and engaging. Gave great service and was busy, but found a great balance to engage the bar eaters as well as service the rest of the restaurant. It should be noted that they only serve beer, sangria, and agave, which tastes different than tequila and is not as strong. I stuck with the beer since I personally drink tequila and do not like the taste of agave.  I am cool with trendy spots, but for the discerning Mexican food connoisseur, a little bit more would go a long way",

Cons:  * Environment, way too loud unless you are looking for a clubby dinner spot and we arrived soon after they opened.  * Parking a serious challenge in this part of North Beach * $9.00 for 2 small taco truck tacos!!! I have had better from trucks that were larger, as well I prob would get 4 at this price. The difference is what you pay is definitely not evident in the taste. * Guac boring, weak. * $45 in Mexican? You shud not walk away hungry. Servings small.  Heard as walking away: Don't believe the hype. This place is not worth the salt of 4.5 stars, unless you are looking for bottomless alcohol. It seems as though alot of reviews place serious value on this alone. Not a problem, I understand, but for this reviewer, no Senor. Will not be back.",

Fish tacos: Finally, fish that isn't dry and tough in a fish taco! Fish was perfectly flaky and not bland at all.  Torta: The bun was crispy enough so that it had a nice crunch, but just soft enough so it doesn't scrape the roof of your mouth. The meat inside wasn't rubbery like it usually is in tortas (not that I'm complaining). And the cheese was just mild enough with an interesting texture that tied everything together.

I became a fan of Don Pisto's thanks to its tacos and the wonderful Hamburguesa, burger that tastes just a little bit like bacon with great guacamole on top. I then became a big fan of the poc chuc, that wonderful slab of meat. I am currently obsessed with the Chorizo Mussels, a gorgeous spicy dish that really showcases how the chef is a magician with sauces and spices. I always make a point of asking for some extra toasted bread upfront (dish comes with three slices that you can let soak in the sauce and spread chorizo on...). I typically also have the pitcher of margarita -- not the best margarita I've had, but definitely makes me happy and works well with the dishes here.  Only downside: Yet another great place that's overwhelmed by its own success. These days wait time for a table is one hour even at 8pm on a Wednesday night. I've been here probably around 40-50 times, including one time when I brought in a group of 15, and the staff at the door still look like they don't ever remember me -- I typically get a \"nice to see you again\" at every establishment that I patronize so frequently. Upside though: kitchen doesn't close until half past midnight, so I usually roll in kind of late (or put my name on the list and go to 15 Romolo for a drink and come back for my table).  If you like this place, definitely also try Chubby noodle inside Amante bar by the same team. Once again, magic with sauces and spices.",

Service - really good, friendly, attentive, definitely one of the pluses  Ambiance - cozy but a little too loud. Something about the acoustics of the place makes it really hard to hear your friends. Also I was distracted by the copious amounts of smoke billowing in the open kitchen. It seemed to be ventilated well but I found myself looking in that direction all night and worrying that we were breathing in all that smoke.  Food - I always find \"fancy Mexican food\" to be something of an oxymoron and this place was no exception.   In terms of deliciousness and flavor their tacos really can't come close to the way tacos should be consumed: standing huddled next to a softly purring truck, squeezing limes with one hand while clutching greasy paper plates with the other. For that kind of experience try Las Peraltas in San Mateo or La Tonayense in the Mission/SOMA. \u00a0The carnitas tacos here at Don Pisto's tasted rather flat and fatty and the pescado tacos were too much on the other end of the spectrum, painfully spicy and absurdly salty.  The tortilla soup, while enormously generous in portion and well balanced in spicy flavors, was frightfully brothy. My gold standard for tortilla soup is the lusciously thick and filling soup served up at the Farmer's Market on Fairfax and 3rd in Los Angeles. Again this one was sure to disappoint when you go in comparing it to a decidedly superior experience.  Add to that that the tacos average about $4-5 APIECE and you begin to feel like it's a completely overrated/overpriced experience.",

I also tried the lobster cooked in pork fat. \u00a0That's probably all you need to read, really.

Be warned that the food is heavy and that there is not a single vegetarian option on the menu.  My favorite dishes are: * Chicken tortilla soup - Simple but delicious! A good size for sharing with one other person. * Pork chop - Amazingly juicy. I do not normally crave pork chop, but I would come back here again and again for the pork chop. The bed of coleslaw on which it is served is addictingly spicy.  Everything else is pretty tasty as well. The complimentary chips and green salsa are yummy, but save room for your entrees. The guacamole is hearty and flavorful. The lobster, cleaved in half and poached in lard, is very good, but there is not much meat to go around.  My only complaint is that the sangria is a bit too light on alcohol and comes with way too much ice!  Reservations only accepted for groups of over 6. There is a party space downstairs for large groups. Don Pisto's does not refuse to seat partial parties, which is always nice. Without a reservation, you will likely have to wait half an hour or longer.",

They don't take reservations, so they try and rush you out of there. We wanted to ahve a nice long dinner, but we were pretty much ushered along after only one hour of being there. I get they have long waits, but maybe they should think about reservations in their future, or a bigger place? Oh, and the service was slightly snooty, which wasn't fun either. Otherwise, I'd give these guys 5 stars.  Either way, definitely a treat - just know that you will wait long for a table, and they'll kick you out as soon as they can.",

I have been a big fan since I moved to North Beach a year ago, and always make sure to bring any family and friends visiting from out of town here for brunch or dinner. It is a half a block from my house and the prices are totally reasonable, not to mention the food is always amazing!  I think I've tried almost everything on the menu but favorites are the hamburguesa of course, the chorizo mussels, french toast, chorizo + poached eggs, pork chop... the tacos are good when you're not too hungry, always love oysters and sashimi, and I just tried the carnitas torta yesterday (bomb). They have hands down the best bottomless deal in the area (mmm, sangria), even their (free!) chips and verde salsa are delicious.  Yesterday it was my birthday, and the owner Pete was able to fit me and my party of 15 in super last minute, upstairs no less! The service was excellent as usual - I wish I were able to tip our server on top of the 18% auto-gratuity, but alas, getting money from 15 drunk santa clauses is never easy.   We came here one time and a couple of us ordered the chorizo + poached eggs but our eggs were overdone and cooked through completely. We asked for a few new eggs just to toss on top of the dish, and Pete came by to those of us that got it and comped our plates anyway. Completely unnecessary, and we were not irate by any means, but it does mean a lot for the owner to be attentive and take pride in the food and service - I think it's one of the things that distinguishes a good restaurant from a great one.  I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone! I will be coming back as long as it's around and so am I.  Thanks Don Pistos!",

Both were strong and delicious. The blood orange margarita is really tangy :) Ambiance: Industrial brick on stainless steel - dim lighting, reggeton music Service: A short wait for a table (20 minutes) but great service Total: $86 (dinner + 4 cocktails) Verdict: Go!

I thought I was going to be blown away because I asked for \"salt on my rim and sugar on his\" and was told by our waiter that the bartender wouldn't do a sugar rim because it undermined the integrity of the drink. WHOA, I figured I was about to be served the best margarita of my life. Unfortunately, it was completely non-remarkable. I have had a better drink from Chili's.   The guacamole was on par with the margs. It was in some serious need of flavor...lime, salt, cilantro...anything??  Entrees were fine. Had the tamale special, enchiladas, and fish tacos.

Other than that the place was cool, pretty hip &amp; trendy so its busy but good for them. It really bothers me that I had to buy chips with my ceviche though, thats pretty lame. If it weren't for that I would have given 4 stars",

My girlfriend suggested we go eat at Don Pistos in North Beach and it turned out to be an excellent choice. Being from Boston, I was blown away by the quality of the meal as I have never been to a comparable Mexican place in the Northeast. The margarita and sangria did wonders to aid my hangover and get me back in my feet. The best part of the experience was meeting the owner, Pete. He went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and even brought me a bowl of his special hangover soup. The lack of sign on the front doesn't stop the locals from coming in droves as it was literally filled with people my age. (28) I would say it was the best restaurant I visited in San Francisco and I have been constantly stuffing myself for a week now. Definitely check this place out!",

    "review_text": "They don't take reservations for smaller parties, so when i found out that we had a party of 6, I immediately picked up the phone and reserved that table!   We \u00a0got there and were promptly seated. I didn't have drinks, but had a sip or two of the Micheladas and they were delicious!   The chips and chile verde salsa wasn't too runny, and had the perfect amount of bite to it.--So far so good! and we hadn't even ordered our entrees yet!  For entrees, we decided to try everything out:  1. Carne Asada Tacos--just a regular beef taco, but it was definitely good. If I had to pick my top tacos, I would go with the Al Pastor and the Camarones though  2. Carnitas Tacos--Didn't try it, we had so much food, I physically couldn't fit the in my belly. Sad face  3. Pescado Tacos--Again, Didn't try it, we had so much food. I was so full!  4. Camarones Tacos-The shrimp was SO juicy, flavorful, and had a great kick of spice. Very good!   5. Al Pastor Tacos--Very spicy (in a good way), with that hint of citrus from the pineapple= perfection. My favorite tacos of the 5 that we ordered.   6. Mexican Sashimi--this was just ok. Of course, I'm comparing it to the one I had at Nobu. I would skip this entirely. They had a mini jalapeno on top, so I understand the concept, but it doesn't really deliver.   7. Tortilla Soup--this might be the best soup I have ever had! It definitely serves more than 2. We had a table of 6, and we all had a bowl, and some even had seconds! There was avocado in the hot soup--I don't think I've ever had it, but it was delicious. The perfect amount of salt (tortilla soups tend to be overly salty), and it wasn't creamy. There were huge chunks of chicken in it as well.   8. Hamburguesa--I can't describe it. Everyone thinks, \"what the heck is a hambuger doing on the menu?\" Well, TRY IT. There is something about it that is just so good--it has a smoky flavor, kind of like it's been on the bbq just a little longer, but definitely made with love.   9. Pork Chop--cooked and seasoned perfectly! It was juicy and not dry whatsoever, and the mini cucumber salad on the side was something I wanted to learn how to make.   10. Chile Verde Chicken Tostadas--this was good, for sure, just after all those tacos, this is the least memorable dish. you can skip this if you are ordering all those tacos. It's basically a crunchy version of those tacos.   11. 2 servings of rice--it wasn't just plain old rice. It was damn good. They did some seasoning to it, and I'm not usually a rice person, but needless to say, I ate that up like it was my last supper  12. 2 servings of beans--you can definitely tell it wasn't out of a can--or if it was, they really disguised that well! Felt authentic to me!   Overall, service, company, ambiance, food = GREAT! Will definitely be going back!",

They brought out a 1.5 lb lobster, fluffy thick tortillas, rice, beans, melted butter with cilantro and some cream sauce, and amazing salsa to allow you to make your own burritos. SO GOOD. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and we were both so happy and full after this meal. They also have amazing margaritas and sangria. We also had oysters as well, which were really great too.   I've also been here for brunch a few times, and their brunch is out of this world as well. I only got the breakfast burrito, but I think they took it off the brunch menu (sad face, but I'm ready to try more items!). I also think this is the only place that i've found to have bottomless mimosas, sangria, AND margaritas during brunch. If you come with a big group that orders a variety of the three bottomless options, they will just start bringing out pitchers of everything.   Yes, there may be a wait, but it is very, very worth it. They also allow you to give them your number, and you can leave to go to a bar somewhere else until they call to tell you your talbe is ready. After now having had both types of meals here, this restaurant can do no wrong in my book. GO THERE, I promise you will not be disappointed!",

The food is great, atmosphere is cool, friendly service, and the bartender is funny and he remembered us!   I also heard breakfast is good too, so I think I have to try that.

    "review_text": "Oh, how we've been wronged in the UK. How so very much. When our American counterparts mock our take on Mexican cuisine, *this* is why. They've not just been unnecessarily harsh. For we have not been eating Mexican food all these years. Nope, we have been eating an attempt at Tex Mex instead.  Real Mexican food doesn't come cosily under a duvet of melted cheese, like it's shy and hiding from the world. Nope, it comes fresh, light and spicy. Tacos aren't crunchy shells, they're miniature pancake-like wraps. Chips and salsa ain't from a bag and a jar, they're freshly fried and that sauce ain't bright red nor could it double up as a base for pasta bolognese. Salsa verde's where it's at, and it comes while you're ordering drinks. Margaritas, to be precise.  What genuises (geniii?) Laura N and Kevin L are. These two London-based Americans took us out for our regional UK and Ireland Yelp dinner and decided to show us exactly the cuisine we'd been missing out on. Fish tacos, shrimp tacos, pork tacos (all with zingy fresh salad, lemon juice and marinated meats), steak and eggs, spicy tuna sashimi... my oh my. Not a spot of grated cheese in sight, nor a dollop of yoghurty sour cream. Don't make us eat this then send us back to our respective cities across the Altantic where we cannot actually get this type of food, pretty please.  So I know they do a pretty mean burrito in Pancho's in Manchester, I have it on good American authority (thanks Anyonita G), but this? This is something new altogether. It's not about the refried beans, the cheese, or any of that. Oh how this carrot was dangled and cruelly taken away. Plus, it's one of those uber cool restaurants that doesn't even have a sign or anything, everyone who's worthy of its treats knows where it is just from being eternally hip. Well Don Pisto, I'll miss you greatly. And I'd happily take that 21 hour trek just to reacquaint myself with those tasty fish tacos. Onwards!",

    "review_text": "Muy bueno.  Now this is my kind of place. Pretty discrete location on Union in North Beach, but that adds to the appeal. The decor is nothing crazy, exposed brick walls &amp; great lighting -- it just works.  The menu is small, so go with a group and order everything on the menu &amp; it may just be one of the best meals in San Francisco. Well, I take that back... but it's pretty damn good. You have to go with a big group, order tons of food &amp; the fab drinks and it's unbeatable for that type of night.   Let's start with the Chips &amp; Salsa - hands down do not compare to any I have ever eaten. I honestly do not know what it is that makes them stand out but they're like crack... so addicting.  Standout menu item #1: Carne Asado Tacos. Steak was marinated and cooked to perfection. Melt in your mouth good. Def get more than one order.  Standout menu item #2: Tortilla Soup. Esssuper spicy but incredible. It was too hot to handle for some of the people in my group, but I live for this delicious-ness. I wonder if they do take out, because I could easily eat this 3 times a week.   &amp; the drinks.... I am a margarita connoisseur. And the margaritas at Don Pisto's are excellent. Except they're missing one important ingredient: Tequila. That's right - all the cocktails are made with beer &amp; wine. Including the margarita which is made with a 48 proof Chardonnay. The sangria is delish too. Get pitchers &amp; I guarantee you will have no idea you're not drinking liquor.   Ever been to La Esquina in NYC? It ALMOST reminds me of that. Let's be real: nothing compares to La Esquina but if you drink enough of the Chardonnay margaritas, you might be able to fake yourself into believing you're there.",

    "review_text": "My beloved has been driving past this place for a long time, but had no idea what it was. Our date night consisted of a spontaneous moment where i jumped out of the car in the pouring rain to put our name on the wait list of this unknown location. The signage was very limited so, up until they called to tell me our table was ready, we had no idea the name or what to expect!  We were seated within 45 minutes of putting our name down. The table we were at was COLD. They had the door open (it got very smoky in the dining room and they opened the door to vent the place out) if you are coming on a cold night be SURE to wear something that can keep you warm if needed.  The Sangria was unfortunate, very watery, no fruit and had what I think might be soda water in it. If you are looking for a bold tasting sangria, this isn't the place for that. We switched over to a margarita and that my friends, was well worth it.  We shared the Chirizo and Mussels, what a brilliant combination! I'm a huge huge fan of mussels these were wonderful, the meat adds a good spicy to the mussel without overpowering it which impressed me, I thought for sure I wouldn't be able to taste the delicate sweetness through the intense heavy flavor but boy was I wrong.. thank goodness!  J and I also shared the pork chop and when they say pork chop, I think they mean a whole side of pork.. it was HUGE, I had never seen a pork chop that large before.. It was easily enough for two of us and then for a decent meal taken home with us as leftovers. The chop was served with a very light lime/cucumber/chili salad and in my opinion that was the best compliment to the meal as a whole. it added this soft refreshing bit that cleansed the palate.   The menu is small, so be aware of that.  Music was strange, we walked in enjoying salsa music and it switched to pop/rap and all sorts of other things, an eclectic mix that is for sure  Minus two starts for the seating/ smoke/cold and sangria.",

    "review_text": "As Don Pisto's only takes reservations for parties of 6 or more, our party of 4 had to wait for an hour and a half (Saturday at around 8 pm)--understandable, but just be ready. And of course the North Beach parking was atrocious as usual.  Once we got in, it was quite noisy, with a posh crowd, loud talking, &amp; techno bass beats. We asked our pleasant waitress what the \"must try\" items on menu were--she recommended the following   - Wild Monterey Calamari - charcoal grilled, orange, lime, radish salad - Diablo Prawns - wild mexican prawns, spicy diabla sauce - Puerto Nuevo Lobster - whole maine lobster, homemade flour tortillas, rice, beans, arbol salsa, cilantro butter - House-made Chorizo Mussels - mexican country sausage, white wine, and cilantro - Poc Chuc - grilled pork rib chop, orange chili marinade, spicy cucumber salad  We ordered the calamari, prawns, and poc chuc, but replaced the lobster and mussels with this item, which would later haunt us:  - Pescado Tacos - market fresh fish, arbol &amp; avocado salsa, cabbage &amp; onion slaw  My take on the Calamari:  Maybe the best calamari I've ever had. It wasn't really rubbery at all--more meaty. Served on skewers. Wonderful grilled flavor. And the fresh citrus provided a refreshing accompaniment.  My take on the Diablo Prawns:  Big and fresh. As with the calamari, absolutely no fishy flavor. The diabla sauce was essentially chipotle sauce--strong smoked chili flavor. Not bad at all.  My take on the Pescado Tacos:  What was the \"market fresh fish\"? Who knows--they didn't tell us. It wasn't fishy I guess. The description had me at \"avocado salsa\", but I was distraught that there was barely any avocado flavor at all. The cabbage &amp; onion slaw was boring. And the corn tortilla wasn't hard, and it wasn't soft, which means that...it wasn't good.  My take on the Poc Chuc:  This was executed quite marvelously--the meat was extremely juicy, and the orange chili marinade provided a brilliant overtone. The meat surrounding the bone was superiorly marbled. I was indifferent about the cucumber salad.  All in all:  It was a lovely meal, not holy enough for 5 stars, but fancy enough to kick it above a standard 4 star.",

I ended up with the taco sonora with carnitas. \u00a0It's served on a large, homemade flour tortilla, topped with beans, pico de gallo and crema. \u00a0The tortilla was what all other tortillas wish they were: fluffy, chewy, substantial enough to encompass the mass of toppings. \u00a0The carnitas also pulled their weight (\"pulled\"...get it???), being obscenely juicy and crisped a bit for extra flavor. \u00a0Eating that burrito/taco was the messiest undertaking I've experienced since letting my students experiment with finger paints. The only addition was a healthy drizzle of their AMAZING salsa verde. \u00a0I would come to Don Pistos to eat only that salsa and their ridiculously tasty chips. \u00a0  The busser said their menu was on the smaller side because they get their ingredients fresh. \u00a0You can absolutely taste that freshness, which makes Don Pistos a necessary indulgence.",

I've been here many times for dinner, once for brunch, and once for a group dinner that was hosted in the basement (they apparently worked out a prix fixe deal for unlimited tacos).   Highlights:  - Pescado Fish Tacos (2 per plate) - SO good. Crispy fresh fish, served on two soft taco shells with salsa. - Camarones Shrimp Tacos - good, but the fish tacos are better. Also served on two soft taco shells with salsa. - Guacamole - its good...not the best i've had, but it's good to order on the side of your tacos.   - Brunch Menu: Mushroom and Serrano chile omelatte - this was delicious. I wasn't expecting much from their brunch, but was surprised by how good this item was.   Parking in the area can be tough. This place also stacks up quite a wait, but its really hit or miss. You can put your name down and leave a phone number and theyre pretty good about calling you back when your table is ready.   I live close by to Don Pistos, and it's become part of my regular neighborhood restaurant rotations. Its fresh, tasty, and well priced.",

The Poc Chuc is juicy and delicious. Can be shared between two (split some tacos too) The Hamburguesa is a great choice if you want a mexican burger. The Civiche is so refreshing. Never ever tastes fishy- and is always chilled. Also- Chorizo Mussels are neck and neck with the Lobster tacos. They are perfectly cooked and merry so well with the Chorizo. The toasted bread is like a godsend to the remaining sauce and bits of Chorizo. Orgasmic.   So that's a portion of the menu for you. Ambiance is young, hip and loud.

When the burger gets to the table you're hit with the essence of bacon in the air and that first bite is so juicy you'll need extra napkins to mop up your face. The guacamole adds a nice textual touch as the bun, not a traditional burger bun mind you, rather more akin to the bread used for a torta.   Not to be outdone are the tacos. I had the camarones for my first visit but I will definitely \u00a0be back for the others. The shrimp are cooked to succulent perfection with nice heat from the avacado salsa. Overall a great taco.  Only weird thing was when the wait staff said \"We're a bit backed up on the Pacifico beer orders at the bar...\" Were they having trouble with the bottle opener?

If I could, I would give them 4.5 stars because they are so close, but not quite perfect: - The guacamole took so long to arrive that we only had 3 minutes with it before our food arrived. \u00a0Once I tucked into the food, I was too full to enjoy any more guac and most of it went to waste. - The tortilla soup I ordered on my first visit was less than satisfying - thin and flavorless - really not up to par with their other food. - The hamburguesa was a tad too salty on my second visit.

We came here for a work dinner since I was able to make reservations for a party of 9. They wouldn't seat us until we all arrived, and the table but a little squishy but we made it work. We ordered a bunch of different dishes to share:  -Tacos (2/Order, Topped w/Onions &amp; Cilantro). My favorite was the Al Pastor (Grilled Pork Rib Chop, Charred Pineapple, Avocado Salsa, $9), then the Carnitas (Slow Braised Pork, Arbol Salsa, $9), Camarones (Sauteed Shrimp, Garlic, Red Onion, $10), Pescado (Market Fresh Fish, Arbol/Avocado Salsa, Cabbage, Onion slaw, $10), then the Carne Asada (Mesquite Grilled Steak, Arbol Salsa, $9). -Mexican Sashimi (Lime, Cilantro, Chile): This was awesome since the hamachi was really fresh and flavorful. Highly recommended! -Wild Monterey Calamari (Charcoal Grilled, Orange, Lime, Radish Salad, $15): Just ok. The calamari tasted fresh, but it was a little bland- Skip. -Ceviche: Pretty good, and I normally don't like ceviche. The fish was really fresh, and the flavors worked really well together. Recommended. -Chips &amp; Salsa ($3) &amp; Guacamole ($6): The salsa had a good level of spicyness, and the guacamole was also good, but needed a little more salt. However, the chips were really good, and salted perfectly. -Hamburguesa (Marinated in Bacon, Onions, Served w/Guacamole, $11): I've had the hamburguesa before and really enjoyed it, but thought it was just ok this time around. The patty was a bit overcooked/on the dry side.   Our server was really good, and was able to make some recommendations to help us with our order. I thought the food was good, but not amazing. However, prices are reasonable and all their ingredients seem really fresh. It would be nice if they had at least 1-2 desserts available on the menu, since I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't at least have fruit or cookies or something. Overall, I would recommend checking out Don Pisto's once if you haven't been, but there are other really good restaurants in this area to dine at also. Parking can be a nightmare in this area, but there is a lot a few blocks away that is available, as well as street parking. No valet though.",

Kim kept us hydrated, and seeing that we were from out of town, kept coming back to chat with us as well as offer some great recommendations of things to do.   Onto the food and beverages...the red sangria was perfectly tasty and strong, but the agave/pineapple shots were to die for. After annihilating the yummy chips &amp; salsa, we got a little sampling of the sashimi (great!), and tried the steak and fish tacos. I preferred the steak, but it may have been a bit too spicy for me (and I like spicy).

I had heard amazing things about this little spot in North Beach and finally tried it out earlier this year. Since then, I've been back twice with totally different groups and tried a few different menu options. The first time, I liked it. The second time, I reallllly liked it. This most recent experience? Exceptional. Like, whoa. It's not the greasy Mexican food that you're probably used to having; it's fresh, clean and puts a whole new twist on Mexican fare.   The set up of the menu makes it super conducive to sharing, so plan for that! All three times I've been in, I've had the sashimi, which has been exceptional. Most recently, we also tried the grilled calamari which was ahh-mazing! So, so good; very fresh and super healthy. The tacos that I've tried (the grilled fish and the shrimp varieties) have also been great. The tacos are on the smaller side, so make sure you're ordering enough for the group!   They don't have a full bar, so don't be shocked when you have limited drink options. Still, their margarita and sangria options are really delicious, so you won't be disappointed (I happen to be a big fan of their sangria)!",

We also know that there never really is a good time to go, and that your chances of finding good parking your first time around the block is about as high as winning the million dollar lottery. That being said, Don Pisto's is worth the agonizing ordeal of finding parking.  The flavors and textures of all the dishes we got were spot on.  - The calamari is a must! It comes out grilled perfectly, and full of flavor. Plus, the presentation is gorgeous, and the colors on the plate really pop.  - Mexican sashimi with salmon. I was apprehensive about ordering this dish, but my love for sashimi would not let me pass this one up, and I'm glad I didn't. The fish was fatty and fresh and had a bit of zest to it, which was nice because then it didn't end up being overly oily on the mouth. This dish was good, not the best sashimi, but the name tells you what to expect and it's definitely a must try for the curious sashimi-lover.  -Al pastor tacos. The pork was seasoned very well. Not over-salted like at a lot of places, and the chunks of pineapple really bring out the natural sweetness and flavor of the pork. Yum! Not your usual al pastor meat if you're used to the shredded kind, but this one gives you great texture and a mouthful of deliciousness in every bite.

I've been here five times now and have no intention of not dramatically increasing this number.",

    "review_text": "It takes a great hamburguesa to make putting ketchup on it unnecessary. \u00a0And so it was as 3 of us ordered this savory take on Mexican street food. The bacon and onion accented marinade was spot on as was the topping of guacamole and a perfectly toasted bun. It was also more than enough food despite its presence on the small plates part of the menu. To round out our 4 person table, we also ordered a delicious and spicy grilled Wild Monterey Calamari and a couple of fish tacos. Water was plentiful for the spice, while a some Lagunitas IPAs and a couple glasses of Rose kept the meal and the conversation flowing.   This place is popular and luckily we had the flexibility to wait over an hour for our Table. That was made easier by the professional touch of the greeter and his willingness to call Gayle's cell when our table was ready. The other thing is that this place is loud and hard to carry on a conversation. Perhaps this is the new generational normal, but I would have preferred something a little bit more casually intimate to match the cool rustic dining room that was nicely accented by the brick walls and heavy wooden furniture. \u00a0There's also a downstairs that could double as a room for larger groups.   Don Pisto's was a great choice and I thank Gayle's hip young professional Nephew for suggesting it. \u00a0As there's no sign on the outside, I would have walked past this place on my own, with no clue of what Nuevo Yucatan (and other Baja locales) wonders lied within. Maybe Gayle and I will do Brunch next time.",

I had a couple sangrias that were way too easy going down. The carnitas tacos were amazeballs. As an appetizer I had the Mexican sashimi, melt in my mouth salmon! Sarah was my bartender and I give 5 stars on the service. For my entree I had the mussels with chorizo. These flavorful bad boys will get you to foodgasm heaven.

Providing a contemporary take on traditional Mexican street food, Don Pisto's uses quality local ingredients to come up with tasty delights like: mexican sashimi, grilled pork chop, tortilla soup and wild Monterey calamari. There wasn't one disappointing dish amongst the bunch and everything tasted fresh, authentic and stupidly good.  The wine selection is fantastic (with several Californian options), the place is laid back and the chilled ambiance makes your 30 - 60 minute wait worth your while (this place is packed so I'm afraid you will have to settle in at the bar unless you're extremely lucky). The price/quality is also worth the trip as four of us ate (including a bottle of wine) for under $120 USD.

The guacamole was fresh, but could use a bit more salt and lime.  Overall this was a good meal. Our waitress was pretty nice though we didn't need her assistance much. The restaurant ambiance is cool, laid-back and kind of modern. Walked in and definitely wasn't expecting to see this place, I was thinking we would go to some hole-in-the-wall place for Mexican food.  I like that this place is open late. Great for the late night snack.",

We don't drink anything but it's nice to sit down sometimes. Finally we get a table for two. Our server Denise comes and brings his chips and salsa, salsa Verde if I'm not mistaken. Along with two classes of non-iced water. So we dip and sip! Now, to your average chip and salsa guy one salsa is pretty good but my girlfriend is in the know and she asks the knees for that red salsa salsa row ha ha! Denise brings it out to sweet and we get then do some serious chips! My girlfriend orders five tacos and I ordered two lobsters and we are mouthwatering waiting! Good thing we had two kinds of salsa and chips to keep us satisfied and knees made sure our glasses were never dry! Unfortunately, my brothers ex-wife showed up and we had a duck out of there without being seen because we didn't want to have to pay for that apartment incident. I'm only giving this place for stars because some of the chips were too salty.",

As far as menu choices go, I highly recommend the pork chop - its one of the best I've eaten - but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

    "review_text": "Found the restaurant while browsing Yelp for some good Mexican restaurants in San Francisco. Decided on Don Pisto's as the reviews were good, prices were right and the atmosphere was perfect for a casual dinner out.  Took the transit to Union St. Make sure you know the address if you plan on going as their is no signage, which clearly isn't needed since the place was packed.  The restaurant itself is loud and small. Full of people in my age group - mid 20's to 30's. We were told the wait would be about an hour, and after travelling across town and really wanting a Mexican fix we said no problem. We were welcome to stay at the bar; had a Margarita and a Dos Equis. Margarita was excellent - we had at least 2 more each.   Less than 20 minutes later we were seated. I have a feeling they try to weed people out by saying you won't be seated for a long time.   We shared the guacamole which also came with green salsa. Both were great. Chips were homemade and not too salty.   Next we shared the Tortilla soup (sold as 2 bowls); lots of chicken and flavour in the dish. You could tell it was homemade too.  Each of us finished with a different taco. Small, and served with piping hot mini corn tortillas I had the Carne Asada (very spicy) and my wife had the Barbacoa. Hers were not was spicy as mine, but both had a different sauce. Sharing and trading was encouraged!  In the end we had a great meal, ate just enough food not to feel like we rolled out of the place. Our server was pleasant, food came up fast without feeling rushed between courses. If in SF again we would definitely return!",

Delicious. The eggs were so creamy. What amazed me was how hot my dish was throughout my meal. My food was perfectly warm until I couldn't eat any more (there had to have been 3-4 eggs in my dish!) and the cheese was melty and yummy. We were also served bottomless chips and green salsa. Our waitress was super attentive, and came over to refill our waters and mimosas several times and never let our glasses bottom out. This place bumps top 40 music, which I thought was fun. Not so loud that you can't have a conversation, but audible enough to feel happy on a Sunday morning. And with bottomless mimosas, who couldn't be happy?

When Don Pisto's opened a few years back, many of us living in North Beach \u00a0were excited to have a Mexican restaurant with a signature menu. Although a little loud at times, the ambiance was also a lot of fun. \u00a0  I loved the food and vibe so much that in 2010, I had my birthday there with a group of 20 friends. \u00a0Pete, the owner, was very accommodating, and we had a great set-up in the main room. \u00a0The food was delicious, staff was excellent, and the evening had a great vibe to it.  I have not been to Don Pisto's now in about 8 months because the lines can be so long - which is great for Don Pisto's because that's great business and they're bringing in people from all areas of SF. \u00a0For those of us in North Beach, it's become a place we once loved, but now can't get in without waiting 1-2 hours.  I tried to go in the other night and looking at the menu I realized there were less choices and that you now have to pay for chips and salsa. \u00a0Plus, the bar disappeared and there is no place to buy a drink and wait for your table like the old days.  Another drawback is the music. \u00a0It's very loud, even outside on the street, and it appears there's now a DJ which takes up part of the space in the main room. \u00a0Conversation is difficult and the music choice is appealing to a younger crowd. More like a club atmosphere.  Sad to say, but it feels like a trendy Marina restaurant these days for 20 somethings ready for a night on the town. For those of us looking for excellent Mexican food, great ambiance, and a welcome feeling for all patrons, Don Pisto's is a restaurant of the past...",

We had the Al Pastor and the Carne Asada which was very good.

The Al Pastor and Sangria are my favorite combination but the other food is good as well. They don't have a dessert menu which is a down side, so instead I just have one order of the Al Pastor as my entree, and then order another for dessert!  The pricing is also good, about $9-11/per taco order which includes two medium sized tacos that they give you extra tortilla to make it into four.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place!

They told us that they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. When we asked how early we should get there and if they would be busy at 6:30 they said we should have no problem getting a table. When we arrived at 6:00 just to be safe, they told us it was a 45 minute wait. When they finally did seat our party of FIVE they sat us at a 4 top which meant I had to sit on the corner where there was barley enough room for my plate (while there was an open 6 top right next to us that they wouldn't sit us at). I mean, I have worked in the restaurant business before and when there is a party of 5 you sit them at the 6 top and suck it up! But that is not even the worst of it. One of the people in our party ordered (off of their TINY menu) the mussels and about ten minutes after ordering our waitress came up to us and said they were out of the mussels because they had a bigger party coming in later that they had to save some for in case they ordered them. We were there ordering them NOW and they were saving them for a party larger than 5?? It made no sense! He changed his order to the steak. He asked what came with the steak and the waitress said \"nothing, but I can add a side of rice and beans for you if you want.\" He took that as a consolation prize for not having the mussels and said yes, but when the bill came we were charged for them. Another person in our party ordered the \"fried calamari\" not realizing that the menu said that they were grilled. The waitress put the order in for calamari and when it came back they were grilled. She could have at least told us that they weren't fried! We would have changed the order! By the time we were getting up to leave, they finally sat people at the 6 top right next to us that was empty during our entire dining experience.  I will not go back.

YUMMMM  I always get the fish tacos and ceviche + Green salsa tastes incredibly fresh with the best chips to complement them - No happy hour prices so kind of expensive. Half of the price comes from flare and ambiance---also the fact that it is in North Beach. Bar is small, space is limited + Flavors are great, and have not been disappointed with the food yet.  Conclusion: I always recommend tourists to come here, its delicious and def worth trying. Its a good spot where locals go to.",

Perfect for friends visiting from out of town, double dates, birthday parties, Sunday brunch or just to satisfy your taco cravings!   In summary: tasty food for unbeatable prices in a toasty and trendy dining environment.  Now on to the food. The free salsa &amp; chips are amazingly fresh. The chile verde salsa is a perfect balance of citrusy, spicy and savory. \u00a0The chicken tortilla soup is HUGE! I've shared an order of the soup with 4 girl friends before. It's good but nothing special. All the entrees (carne asada tacos, carnitas tacos, fish tacos, hamburger, chile verde chicken tortiallas...) I have ordered have never disappointed me. My favorites though are the chicken tostadas and al pastor tacos. But you can't go wrong with ordering any of their delicious tacos!   Warning: The place does get pretty crowded on Fridays and Saturdays so expect to wait awhile if you go during the weekend dinner rush. But I promise the wait is totally worth it!",

However, the service and atmosphere were so unfavorable, they far outweigh the quality of the food itself.  The restaurant's first floor is very appealing. However, we were seated in an expansion space in the basement. It is a dark, cramped, characterless cement box that has none of the character of the space upstairs. And, it is LOUD. SO loud that conversation was limited to the people immediately beside us (we had a party of 7), and even then it was extremely difficult. I cannot overstate how loud it was. The server was literally shouting to convey the specials, etc., and we still had a hard time hearing him.   Beyond the space, the service itself was unacceptable. I'm sure this had everything to do with our server specifically. He lacked basic skills in meeting the needs of our party. Five of us received our food; it took more than 10 minutes for the sixth member of the party to receive his plate, and the seventh member of our party never did receive his meal. We were able to get one order of drinks and had to practically wring a second order out of the server at the very end of the meal. He didn't check in on us to see how things were, to ensure our drinks were full, etc. \u00a0Just bad.  Don Pisto's needs to more effectively screen its servers -- and it needs to shut down that basement until they figure out how to mitigate the sound and approximate the environment upstairs.  Until then, why not serve the food out of a food truck? It's so delicious! We had hoped this would be a regular neighborhood spot for us.",

    "review_text": "What a beautiful cure for the day after New Years Eve!   My girlies from Miami, my BFF Jess H., and I were desperately seeking last minute dinner reservations somewhere that my East Coast gals could actually get a taste of West Coast style Mexican...  My favorite Mission spots= too informal  Colibri= booked!  Orale, Orale= not quite in the mood.   Tommy's Tequila Bar= too far!  Don Pistos= JUST RIGHT!   I called ahead and was excited to hear there was only a 45 minute wait for a party of 6 so we rushed over and put our name in. Sadly we were greeted by no no sign on the door and a 2 hour wait and no space to drink at the bar, sigh. We had a flight to catch so the possibility of getting my gals something other than Mission burritos on the way to the airport was looking pretty dismal.   I went and explained my predicament to our hostess and ten minutes later we were summoned to our table. It was perfect. We headed to the basement/banquet style room that had more than enough seating. Yay!  We were greeted by our darling server Kate and amazing tortilla chips and salsa that tasted just like my Mom's. They were even served in the wooden bowls, just like at Mom's! Then we heard \"bottomless margaritas and sangrias\" and we were all in.  We ordered an assortment of tacos: carne asada, fish of the day, carnitas, and al pastor. The highlight was definitely the carne asada, it was a little dry but somehow managed to make me order a second round. I liked that the tacos were served street style: 2 small tortillas, onions, cilantro, pickled jalapenos and carrots, radishes, and limes.   The bottomless pitchers were flowing. At one point Pete the owner of the joint, came and professed his love to the ladies at the table and proceeded to give the men shoulder rubs. You get the picture, it was a great meal!  I'm not gonna lie to you folks, some places on mission have better tacos but this place is all about the entire package, the vibe. Good service, great ambiance, fabulous music, stiff booze, and yummy food.   Side Bar-I love the name, anyone who has been to Mexico should get a giggle out of picturing the real Don Pisto.",

Knowing they had bottomless mimosas for only $15 per person. It was 2:30 pm when we came in and we knew we only had an hour on the clock to essentially get the party started.  We sat down and we each ordered mimosas (with pineapple juice instead of orange juice) and both had our eye on the Chorizo &amp; Poached Eggs (housemade country sausage, crema, and potatoes).   We started on our drinks while munching on the complimentary chips and salsa on the table. Honestly, before the food even came to the table, I think we knocked back two or three yummy mimosas on empty stomachs. When we did get food, I was ready to scarf it down. The potatoes tasted great with a little hot sauce and I loved how the chorizo was crispy. Once the poached egg was broken and running down everything else, I was in heaven. For only 10 bucks for the plate, I was more than pleased!  At the end of the meal, we had four mimosas under our belt. We were the last people to leave as we finished our meal. Our waitress came by and gave us our last refill, finishing off what was left of the pitcher. I felt like a lush as I stared at the drink filled to the rim. A fellow employee decided to urge me to finish up and I felt like I was at a frat party. I chugged it down as I proclaimed that I hated the employee, to which he told me he loved me ;)   Drunk before 4 pm? Gotta love great starts to epic Saturdays. Thanks, Don Pisto's.

Can't believe some peeps are giving Don Pisto's bad reviews, but then again, I did go for brunch for my pals birthday, and my friends paid for me and all took turns giving me massages.   Jay Kay! I paid for myself and it was a whopping *$49* for effing BRUNCH, and there were sadly no massages, but what can you do?  Anyway, my roomies and I arrived and the rest of our party was seated and in high spirits, working on their Bottomless Mimosas, Margaritas, or Sangrias (all $16 and ALL INTERCHANGABLE!). Two items had started to come out and thank goodness because we were ravenous.   It's family style brunch, which worked out well as some girls were hungrier than others. We had the Huevos Rancheros (which were my favorite), and it was a different variation of the dish which I appreciated. Small, fried corn tortillas made crispy, covered with pinto beans, beautiful sunny side up eggs, and Pico de Gallo.   We also had the Fish and Al Pastor Tacos (so good!) and the Brioche French Toast that came with a side of crispy, salty bacon. Their chips are amazingly thick and salty, served with a spicy green salsa and fresh guacamole. I had the Sagria and it was refreshing and light, but got the job done.   I knocked off a star because service was not up to par; we were constantly flagging down someone to refill a drink, bring water, plates, etc. - I know that makes us sound high-maintenance, but if someone had been paying attention, we wouldn't have had to ask for much. It was also pretty pricey for what it was. Either way, I'll be back with my Russian pals to show them the gem I found!",

It was a stretch to split it that far, but i'd say 3 people could easily share the tortilla soup as an appetizer.  In fact, I'd say the only thing I take issue with is how the tacos are priced and portioned. For about $9, you get two tacos. And these are SMALL tacos. You can see in the pictures that they're not going to fill you up. In order to have a full meal there, you need to have an appetizer or two. But for $9, I find the tacos overpriced. I would have rather seen 3 tacos for $12. At 3 tacos, that would be enough food.  All in all, the food quality is good, but I'm only giving it four stars due to the awkward portioning / pricing.",

The salsa verde and tortilla chips were very yummy and the guacamole was fresh and simple.  I had the Heuvos Rancheros for brunch and asked for the sunny side up eggs to be made over medium (not a fan of runny whites). It was two eggs on top of a crunchy road tortilla and I liked the twist. The taste was simple and good, but enhanced with a little salsa verde and hot sauce on top. The breakfast potatoes are crispy and delicious. My friend had the Poached Eggs and Chorizo and the bite I was allowed was much more flavorful than my dish.  For a drink I enjoyed a Bloody Mary, which was spicy and salty and awesome.  Definitely give this place a try for brunch! \u00a0The price point is perfectly reasonable, the service was friendly, the restaurant clean and overall it was a worthwhile experience.",

The mussels also came with chorizo and garlic bread. It was so yummy. As a bread fanatic I especially enjoyed the bread. But my favorite of the night was the fish taco.

    "review_text": "Thought this would be the perfect place to bring my sister when she was in town visiting. I made a reservation for 6 (they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more). One friend couldn't make it and the other was running a bit late. When we had checked in, and let our hostess know that it would only be a party of 5, she was extremely rude, had an air of annoyance, and frankly was a B****.  When we were seated, our waitress was also very annoying. She came across as overly confident, a bit aggressive, \u00a0(to the point of coming across as a know-it-all rather than a helpful server) and kept calling us all 'hun' (sorry but females should know that no other female appreciates being called hun by women their own age). Definitely rubbed me the wrong way.   The table for 6 was so big and the place so loud that we could barely hear each other speak.   The main reason I wanted to come here was for the food -- however, several of the options that I had enjoyed the most were no longer on the menu. When I asked our waitress why, she said because it wasn't in season -- the items I had specifically asked about were the sliders and the corn. How is beef not in season?   The girls at the table (my sisters and I) also noted that our waitress wore a low cut tank to flash around her cleavage (Sorry but this isn't pleasant for female patrons).  When the bill came, I insisted that we not give a good tip as it would be the most appropriate way to let her know that the service was not good, and the entire dining experience very annoying ... but everyone ended up tipping 20% despite my protests.  Overall, it was a HORRIBLE experience and I would never come back. Not only would I not recommend it, but I would advise against it. It could potentially ruin your night, especially since SF is filled with tons of great eateries staffed with less pretentious females.",

If this was a Mexican restaurant in the Mission, it'd still be just as delicious.  I'm addicted to the salsa verde that comes with the tortilla chips. Love it, could make a meal out it, but then I'd miss out on everything else. Their fish tacos are consistently wonderful (actually spicy without even having to ask!), and tortilla soup very good too. The only thing I keep missing out on is the lobster or whole grilled fish specials, both of which I do want to try someday.   On my very first visit, our server forgot about us...but this was completely made up for with a round of sangria on the house and a plate of churros for dessert. Loved the wacky idea to serve breakfast all day on New Year's Day-- and the food was delicious too, especially the breakfast burritos.   One caveat, on my last visit, everything we had was just a bit too salty...I'm really hoping this was just a one-off. \u00a0We'll see.",

    "review_text": "This is a go to spot for my girls and I because of the unlimited margaritas/sangria.   SERVICE: although its always like a 20-30 minute wait...I think its worth it. The host guy was too funny and really perky. Obviously he enjoys working there. He told us to grab a drink at the bar while we wait and he found us right away to seat us right away.Our waitress and bus boys were very prompt. They refilled the water and our chips and salsa right away. I didn't feel like I was hounded with \"Is everything okay\" every 5 mins. Thank you for that. Our waitress even had a little humor to her.   FOOD/BEVERAGE: Tried their agave shots. I'm not a fan of shots but this was easy to take. Very smooth. Very sweet. I felt like I was taking a shot of tea to be honest. Next came the meal: Carne Asada tacos. Meat is perfectly tender. A lil bit of spice. Complimented with a dash of onion and cilantro. These tacos were very juicy and tasteful. To wash it down, my friend and I ordered their sangria. It was okay. I think it needs to be a little bit sweeter or stronger.   PRICING: price is reasonable. Drinks and Food for two came out to be like $45 overall.   OVERALL: definitely will come back again and bring more of my friends. Although, to those with cars...parking is scarce. Bus it. Cab it. Walk it. Unless you do not mind paying the garage fees. Or if you're like me...pretend your car does \"fit\" in that spot....haha lol",

I am always in the mood for excellent Mexican food, so we pointed in that general direction.   Mr C let me out so he could find a parking space and I could grab a table. While I waited I had great chips and green Chile salsa.   And then guacamole.   Eventually he showed up.

    "review_text": "Let me start off by saying that I am not really into Mexican cuisine. I don't typically mind it, but I rarely find myself craving it and never seek out restaurants on my own. This restaurant has changed all that...   A co-worker recommended it, saying it was his favorite restaurant in the city - \u00a0which is quite the claim! I decided to try it out one night while not feeling in the mode for anything specifically. Now I feel like an addict, eagerly inviting any &amp; all friends just to have an excuse to go back to Don's more often!  Food Highlights: - Mexican sushi - Mussels - Shrimp tacos  Prices are what one should expect for the city and offer a bit of a flexibility. On a more lavish night you can share entrees, or if you're feeling like a cheaper bite you can easily fill up on tacos (and chips &amp; salsa!).  The wait can be a bit long - typically around dinner the waits are 45+ minutes, but they'll take down your phone # so you can take a leisurely stroll in Washington Square park or go get a drink at one of the dozens of nearby bars.  Lastly, the seating is optimized for larger groups with a few big family-style tables and mostly four-tops. This means big groups come in and it GETS LOUD! If you're in a twosome / on a date, you may be seated at a family-style table with another twosome or small group - by no means a bad thing but \u00a0can make it a bit difficult to hear your conversation over all the chatter.",

Very plain, simple \u00a0wooden tables and chairs. The dining area has brick walls which I think makes a restaurant much louder and is about the size of a large family den, so basically the size of every single restaurant in the city. Be prepared with snacks so you avoid getting hangry before you are seated.  I have to mention that the tables also sport \u00a0glass Fanta bottles turned salt shakers. \u00a0THAT IS HOW WE DO IT IN MEXICO, CABRONES.  Here's what we got: -Tacos de pescado ($10) -Tacos de camaron ($11) -Chips and guac ($6) -Sangria ($7)  The tacos were both delicious. The tortilla was smeared with what I think is roasted arbol chile; each bite was heavenly! The flavors of fish, corn and spice were perfectly balanced in every bite!  Chips and guac: this is what chips and guac are supposed to be! Just PERFECT.   I like that the sangria was slighly carbonated and not too fruity. Highly recommended. I also saw Corona Familiar at other tables which is a 40oz bottle of Corona, but not the watery Coronas you are used to, my friends. This is a heartier, better version of the Corona we all know and love.   Don't ask me how or why, just enjoy it.",

Since I've found out about this place been here twice when I was in the city so I guess I'm a fan.   In all I've had:  Chips &amp; guac - Great chips - really great chips, on the thick side &amp; salted properly. \u00a0The guac rocks too. \u00a0Just the right amount of salt and citric - makes all the difference. \u00a0 \u00a0  Puerto Nuevo Lobster  I've actually been to Puerto Nuevo and had lobster before so I knew what to expect. \u00a0(This is a science project so if you're not a lobster person you may not dig the inner workings of the bug) - verdict - ROCKS! hands &amp; face covered with the bug and the sides! \u00a0The dish really feeds two and with the sides its plenty of food for two people  Al Pastor tacos Like others have commented these are small tacos and two of them come with the order. \u00a0 It takes a gentle touch to get pineapple into a savory dish and not overwhelm it. \u00a0Don Pisto's gets it right. \u00a0These tacos are two pieces of heaven! \u00a0Wanted to re-order another but with the chips &amp; guac I was stuffed.  Interior wise, very laid back \u00a0pretty loud. \u00a0Latin music playing and its a partial open kitchen. \u00a0I'm sure there is lines at prime time but both times I've been there around 5-6ish we never had to wait.",

The margaritas are reliably alcoholic, the sangria is excellent. Everything else I've had here is off-the-charts good - ceviche, street-food-sized tacos - I esp like the fish ones, like scallops that they sometimes have. Even the guacamole tastes fresher, more flavorful and less mashed than what you get elsewhere.  Coming from Seattle it's basically impossible to find any Mexican food that's this good.  Note: They'll take reservations if your party is 6 or more, although that almost always means you get seated down in the dungeon (er, basement). Still delicious food, even if you do feel like you're well underground. Also it's in Little Italy, which I find an odd choice location wise, but it's worth the trip.  Go now, but be prepared to wait.",

My close friends and I came here for New Year's Eve for dinner before we went to a club to dance the rest of 2011 away. My first experience with Don Pisto's was amazing, but I didn't think they could completely blow me away the second time. Yeah, I was wrong.  We all ordered different dishes, and we each tried a little bit of everyone's food. I had been wanting to try their tortilla soup ever since I saw it on the menu, but the order is big enough to feed TWO people as a full MEAL. Soooo, I talked my 3 dining companions into ordering it as an appetizer for the 4 of us (yenno, along with the chips, salsa, &amp; guacamole we already had on the table...). We did it, and we were all SO glad we did. The tortilla soup is absolutely delectable. Everything about it was cooked perfectly, and the flavor was amazing. The spice sneaks up on you, too. I LOVED it.  I ordered the carnitas tacos, one of my friends ordered the carne asada tacos, and another ordered the camarones tacos. All exceptional, as expected.   Our 4th dining companion ordered one of the specials for the night, the machaca. It's basically marinated, slow cooked beef in a chile sauce, topped with a sunny side up egg. Eaten with tortillas (and rice and beans, if you like), of course. It was fucking PHENOMENAL. If I had known it was going to be that good, I would've ordered that instead of the carnitas. If that's on the menu when you eat at Don Pisto's, you should definitely order it. Trust me, it's worth it.",

HOWEVER, last night I was made aware of a new policy: They no longer will take guacamole off of food - as it would change the \"vision of the burger.\" Even in cases of food allergy. Chef's orders. Seriously.  Thank you, Don Pisto's, for discriminating against a person with food allergies. You've just lost a customer for life.",

The four of us shared the shrimp, fish and carnitas tacos and an order of their pork chops. We also got some guac to start. I liked that the tortilla chips were freshly fried and unsalted. The green salsa was very fresh tasting.  The food arrived in quick succession. In terms of the tacos, my favorite was the shrimp and (surprisingly) the carnitas, I liked the least. I thought overall, the tacos were nothing special nor innovating. I'll take a taco from a taco truck over these any day of the week. The pork chop was well seasoned, but just slightly overcooked.   The sangrias were pretty tasty. I liked the rustic decor and open kitchen, but the food was very average, at least in my humble opinion. I don't quite understand what all the fuss was all about. The ingredients were higher in quality than most Mexican places but I don't think it was cooked with heart and without that, the food simply don't have that homey feel to it.",

Some places do this successfully, others end up charging 3x the price for the same meal you would find out of a food truck.  Don Pisto's does some things great and other things poorly. Thankfully, I am here to help you know what to order:  PRO:  -Unlimited chips and salsa verde spicy salsa - delish. -Chorizo &amp; Mussels with White Wine Reduction Sauce - 4 star! Fresh mussels topped with mild chorizo and a delicious broth. Worth the $14.  -Seafood stew - tons of fish, prawns, squid, calamari etc in a buttery chicken tortilla-like stew. 4.5 star.

It's not bad, but not worth $8 for 2 small tacos. -They decided to no longer offer mango ahi which was supposedly amazing said reviews. -They were very crowded, but the place had no sign / name decal / logo on it whatsoever. If you didn't have exact GPS or drove by, you'd have no idea what it was called. Who's dumb idea was that?",

Love the brick walls and lighting. Food is epic. Tortilla soup, salsa, sangria, tacos, all amazing! Great date spot. Good luck finding parking!! Plan ahead.",

Our table ordered a bunch of different items of the menu and everything was insanely delicious. I only had a few items but they were so yummy I am actually deeply sad I am only in San Francisco for work and that I will be leaving this wonderful restaurant behind.   Lobster -- CHECK. ***This is a MUST*** Perfectly cooked with such a unique, light flavor.   Carne Asada Tacos -- Yes. Just the perfect amount of spicy.   Fantastic chips and guacamole. \u00a0  A must go.",

    "review_text": "Ok...I thought going into Mexican food in San Francisco?....having lived in LA for the last 8 years my Mexican food standards are pretty high and I must say....Don Pisto's is AWESOME. \u00a0  From the get go I was feeling the vibe. \u00a0We couldn't find the restaurant right away because they actually don't have a sign out front, but I actually liked that. \u00a0And from going inside there is no need for a sign....it was packed. \u00a0We made reservations and got a table downstairs in a separate area from the main area. \u00a0  We ordered the camarones (shrimp), pescado, and al pastor tacos and all were really good with camarones being the favorite amongst the people I shared it with. \u00a0  Another popular thing on the menu seemed to be their Bottomless menu which is bottomless mimosa ($13), margarita ($15), or sangria ($15)...all before 3:30pm daily. \u00a0Man...what a deal!! \u00a0Leave your car behind and head on down there for some drinks and tacos! \u00a0  Will head back and try something off of their breakfast menu next time :)   Chatted with the waiter for a sec and must say SUPER friendly. \u00a0Found out it was his brother who is the chef/owner....and he also cooks for another kitchen right around the corner in some bar....ceviche and stuff...how dare I forget the name of the place! \u00a0WIll ask the next time I go back :)  Only complaint....it was so loud in the part of the restaurant we were in that my friends and I had to shout at each other to talk....the big group next to us were also super loud so mixed with the music....hard to talk to the person next to you. \u00a0It did get a lot better once that big group did leave but man......talk about loud.",

But thanks to Don Pisto, he came to the rescue.  He brought us so much joy from the bottomless pit to the....  bottomless mimosas.... bottomless margaritas.... and of course....  bottomless sangarias....  oh joy joy joy joy... need I say more...  Actually I do! \u00a0Their chorizo, to their breakfast burritos along with their omelettes are just amazing. \u00a0This is one brunch that is unforgettable for its food, hospitality and the bottomless cocktails and company.  Although it was pretty loud, it is such a great place for a get together to enjoy Don Pisto's ever amazingly brunch menu along with the cocktails.  He has made my day and I want more and more and more....",

Over the holidays I became really sick in an out of the hospital and on bed rest, so last Saturday I told my hubby that I needed to get out of town, I wanted to go to my favorite city San Francisco to go eat at one of my favorite little restaurant, Don Pistos, because of traffic my little family of four (our two kids 8&amp;6) didn't get to the restaurant until 8:30. The line was out the door and people were standing outside. We put our name on the list and it was a 2 hour wait. My hubby knew how much it meant for me to eat there so we waited, the kids were tired, hungry and grumpy, he took them to have some gelato next door to keep them up but they hostess' at Don Pistos must of felt bad for us that we were able to get in within 40 minutes. We let the kids order bottled coke to keep them from falling asleep. I seen that they had this amazing lobster on the menu, but the server told us that they were sold out :( Bummer but now I will have an excuse to go again! I told my husband that I'd like to come again the next morning for brunch so I can get my 2nd fix of Don Pisto's. Everyone in my little family enjoyed their meals when the server came with our check she let us know that our drinks were being comped. How nice!! I love this place. We came back the next morning for brunch and I enjoyed bottomless pineapple mimosa's my hubby and I got the sonora taco my daughter got the torta and my son ate off of us. We ask for the bill and I don't know if it was the manager but a really nice young lady came over and told us that the Restaurant was treating us to our brunch. WOW!! how nice! it was such a nice gesture from Don Pistos! We all could not believe how kind they were to us. She said they appreciated our business and that we drove all the way from Fresno and they'd like to see us there again! YES of course we will be back! \u00a0We left feeling so blessed and This is my go to restaurant in SF. Hand's down my favorite place to visit. My birthday is this weekend and I am thinking of asking my hubby to take me to Don Pistos to have that lobster!",

They made us lollygag around the bar for another 20 minutes when we asked one of the staff member he blew us off with a bs excuse saying he couldn't control when would be seated. We ordered food which came out very scattered and some people at our table ate cold food waiting for other peoples food to come out! \u00a0To me the staff acted like a bunch of confused children in a math class not knowing how to properly tack care of their customers. Food was decent but I will not be coming back unless they get their act together.",
