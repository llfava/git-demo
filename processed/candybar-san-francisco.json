Liked our drinks more than the desserts prepared. Board and card games!:)  Highlight: Connect 4 and the lychee guava martini....soju cream soda was alright as well. Ordered flourless chocolate torte with banana and pineapple. No banana anywhere....too busy the server. We didn't bother.  As for my ice cream sundae,uh...\" Macaroon\", thou art stale ---eeewy, to be more exact. The br\u00fbl\u00e9e on the bananas not deep enough, and the brownie underneath was also stale. No can do, say we foodies.  But the place itself, casual, is cool. Ventilation sucks so prepare to be bit warm. Tight spaces, and place seems slightly cluttered. Low dim lit interior.",

There was barely a wait when boyf and I came on a Saturday night. I was already stuffed to brim from Izakaya Sozai, but he had a Living Social deal we had to use up, and I have a 7th stomach for dessert, so why not?  Living Social deal includes 2 cocktails and 2 desserts. We ordered the lychee martini with soju and guava juice, strawberry champagne, apple ala mode, and macaron ice cream sandwich. Apple ala mode, look above. Ice cream sandwich tasted like a honeydew hi chew. Yum. Our cocktails were sweet little concoctions as well. Probably not too strong for the average 23 year old, but enough to knock a half-shot wonder off her butt. I liked the lychee one much better since I'm not too partial to champagne.   They have a pretty good selection of desserts and cocktails. I would love to come back and try some more! They have a sampler (4 desserts) that I'd definitely get next time. Though their portions are small, this is a great place to just chill with your date or some friends, and play some board games.",

    "review_text": "After hearing great reviews from the fellow yelper, I decided to make a reservation on Tuesday night.  A friend of mine and I shared the tasting menu and we were extremely disappointed with the quantity and the quality of the dessert.  Strawberry juice with lemon amuse bouche smelled really great. However, when gulped, it tasted like bad Gazpacho soup. I don't know how you can mess up the combination.  Bittersweet Chocolate Sorbet with foie gras tapioca and croutons sounded like a great concept. Unfortunately the dessert was executed poorly. ~75% of the sorbet melted, the tapioca was so small that you could barely taste anything and the croutons existence in the plate didn't add any value to the plate.  The only reason why I gave two stars for Candybar was for the Warm Vanilla Cake. The cake tasted like a good interpretation of molten chocolate cake done in vanilla flavor. Unfortunately the pickled mango with olive oil side didn't complement the cake well.   Parking is extremely hard - it took us 30 minutes on Tuesday night to find a spot.  The ambience is just OK - a little bit too dark in my opinion.  In a nutshell, spending 30 minutes to find parking is not worth your spending time at Candybar.",

My macaroon was all right, the honey dew ice cream was weird, not in a delightfully eccentric way though, just weird tasting. I tasted my friend's choco pudding with bacon and red velvet crumbs and it was more like eating pudding with imitation bacos from Fresh Choice and a chunk of red velvet cake. Not good. Hello, with the advent of the bacon reign, you should never, ever resort to imitation. Even Fresh Choice has both. Geez, I went this past weekend and I've kind of already forgotten you. Now, I can only compare you to a salad joint. Maybe I should relegate this to 2 stars... Waiter didn't really have a suggestion...how do you not effuse over at least ONE item that you are serving up to the hordes? Oh, well, I stopped listening once given that answer. If he did finally share, I couldn't hear it, nor was I interested. I became indifferent. I should have ordered my dessert from NOPA. I'm probably even more bitter because I gave up an opportunity to eat dessert there, it. Would have been fabulous, because NOPA is fabulous. Bitter also because I was cold waiting outside for a table, this place was not exceptional enough to make me want to wait again. Check mark, done. No need for another visit.",

People who complain about lack of parking in San Francisco. It's like complaining about rain in Seattle or heat in Phoenix. If you don't like looking for parking, become a real San Franciscan and take the bus or cab it.  In short: This place is top shelf in my book.   Candybar has a great wine selection that can be paired very very well with the desserts. The desserts, in and of themselves, are off-the-charts good. Like, \"holy smokes I'll have 2 more of those\" kinda good. I've never been one to use the word ambiance because I don't think I completely understand what it means, but I'll use it here and say it's great. The music is good, seating is good, lighting is good. It sets the mood for chillin' and relaxin' with good friends, your loved one, someone you're trying to catch up with, or trying to get to know better.  Yes, it's that good.",

    "review_text": "I hate when desserts are an after thought of simple ice cream or standard cakes. \u00a0This place solves that dilemma by only serving dessert so its full attention can be paid to creating innovative dishes! \u00a0Every dish had at least one component, if not the whole thing, that exposed me to a taste or combination I hadn't known before. \u00a0That exploration paired with general yummyness deserves high marks!  Nacho Sundae: This is one of those rare inspirational dishes that takes you to a place you've never been before. \u00a0The avocado yogurt and fruit salsa (kiwi, mango, papaya) with cilantro were a cool way to sweeten a well known presentation. \u00a0The horchata ice cream was nice, but got downplayed because of the cinnamon and sugar already on the chips. \u00a0The one candied jalape\u00f1o was a brilliant way to a zing without making it savory... wish there were more!  Red Velvet Cake: Fluffy cake - check! \u00a0Creamy and slightly sour frosting - check! \u00a0That's all I needed, but fresh coconut shavings were added on top of the frosting to innovate. \u00a0I would have preferred if a portion of it was toasted because raw coconut is only so exciting. \u00a0I liked that the vanilla bean ice cream was presented on red velvet crumbs.  Banana Bread Pudding: On par for bread pudding plus a lovely addition of bananas. \u00a0Could have been warmer. \u00a0The caramel popcorn ice cream was an unlikely star, but dang, what a memory it made! \u00a0A great innovation on something I had never thought of.  Chocolate Fudgesicle: Not your typical fudgesicle frozen treat, but more like a cold chocolate shell with a cold flowing chocolate inside. \u00a0Was great for the chocolate lover in me, but I kind of wish it was more true to the name. \u00a0I had no idea what a tonka bean was, but it made the ice cream taste like vanilla + spices... very yummy.",

The crowd, likely due to the opening, was on the yuppy side - but I'm not complaining. A cool crowd, a hop, skip and jump (or 3 minute cab ride home) and wine...not a bad combo at all!

The use of calamansi added a bit of an almost herbal-tangerine flavor to it with the tartness that you want with a sweet strawberry dessert. Also, I'm typically not at all into sweeter drinks because I can't do alcohol AND added sugars but I thought their fruitty drinks here were done quite well. Instead of fruit flavored vodka, they use a lot of real fruit purees. The prices are a little steep but that tends to be the case for such specialty bars.

Being that she only moved in a couple days ago, and all her stuff is still in Colorado, there was nothing to do after 5 minutes so we decided dessert would be a great idea.  My palette usually favors the savory dishes, but we Yelped desserts in the area and Candy Bar came up. 0.5 miles, only 8 pm on a Friday, we said OK!! We walked the seven blocks and came up to this savvy boutique looking place with a bar. There were booth like couches and ottomans. There was a big shelf of different board games and the different paintings on the walls. It was kind of cold that night, so we walked in to the warm place which smelled so sweet and lit by candlelight, it was almost love at first meeting.  We were greeted by a very friendly gentleman whom I later find out is the owner. We sat down, ordered and drank our water. I'll get to the food later. I went to use the restroom and immediately smiled. The bathroom was unisex, but it was big an clean and full of sexy candles. The first thing that came to mind that this is a very very sexy bathroom!;) I was over the moon. Ok, moving on.  So there was a menu of cute drinks and gourmet dessert pairings. They all sounded so amazing, it was really hard to decide, so you should look at the menu for yourself. But I had the carrot cake with bruleed bananas and some sort of granola type thing with salted caramel ice cream. MMMM right?! And Tatum had brownie with candied walnuts and caramel sauce with thyme ice cream. I practically licked both our plates clean.  So we ask for the check and our waiter/owner tells us about the tacos they have on Tues and Thurs at happy hour and my mouth starts to melt all over again. Asian tacos?! Right up my alley. I tell Tan that I can't wait for happy hour and I will be back every week to try a new dessert, and tacos! It was comfortable, delicious, warm and inviting! A well deserved 5 stars!!",

I ordered the Mango Tango Bellini cocktail and the Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo - I highly recommend both. The Mango Tango Bellini has a very tangy citrus-y punch, makes a good combination to the floating sorbet \u00a0because makes it sweeter. The Lavender Honey has a very unique texture, reminds me of Astronaut Ice Cream (if any of you had tried that before).

It occurs every day from 6pm to 8pm: $4 Sparkling Cocktails, $3 Sangria, $3 Champagne, &amp; $2 Pacifico.  I have had all of their cocktails before.  My favorites are the Mango Tango Bellini, Triple Chocolate Bellini, and Strawberry Kiss.  The Lemon Drop Shot is good as well.   When it comes to the desserts, I recommend the Tiramisu, Japanese Cheesecake, Apple A La Mode, Buttermilk Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta, Strawberry Limeade, and Peanut Butter Jelly Time!  Every single dessert I have had at Candybar was delicious.  I Love coming here!",

The ambiance was great, the servers were extremely courteous, and the desserts and wine pairings were great. The noise volume is high, but that's why it's fun.

Desserts and sparkling wine, in a chill relaxing atmosphere? Sounds awesome!! Well, it was partly awesome. Here's why:  Loved the atmosphere. It was indeed really chill, with tons of boardgames to sit back and have fun. The night was really fun...Catchphrase and a deck of cards can last a long time!  Not quite up to par? Drinks and desserts. We ordered the green tea bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, and the peanut butter time (chocolate tart with peanut butter mousse), the 50/50, jasmine sparkle, and the blood orange cocktail. I didn't think the green tea was all that - I could taste the bitterness of the green tea, but that was about it. Lacking in flavor, I thought. The pb tart had a smooth pb mousse, and hard chocolate tart shell. This was good, but not great. It didn't tantalize my taste buds :)  Drinks were good, but the sparkling ones were just syrup mixed with champagne. After seeing them make it, I felt that it wasn't worth $7. The 50/50 tasted like orange creamsicles, which were awesome, but not really alcoholic...and was served in a round glass cup with a green straw. Funny!  I think my expectations were too high for this place. Come here for the atmosphere and company, not so much for the desserts or drinks.  Ppl were really nice, fyi.",

They have ice cream on the sides of a few that are very accurate in description - basil ice cream tastes like BASIL, not a hint, but a lot -very different though and good. Could easily share a plate between 2 but between 3 is tough. \u00a0Apple a la Mode was very high end homemade feel and the red velvet cake was a bit disappointing - every one loves this stuff but here is was a bit dry and boring - could maybe use more of the mint ice cream side?  Place: Have board games on hand to play - great date spot as dim lighting plus games means never an awk moment.  Drinks - are all sweet bc sparkling wine, no hard alcohol. \u00a0If you are having dessert already - they are \u00a0a bit too sweet for me, but props for having both red and white sangria. \u00a0While this is a normally a sweet drink, you can make versions less sweet and i would recommend they do that here.

We sat, chatted and played apples to apples as we waited, really great way to distract you if the food takes a while.  I was so full from eating french soul food that I couldn't try as much as I wanted to, have a light dinner before stopping by.  The strawberry limeade is worth the hype: get it. It's so darn cute!  The passion fruit chocolate mousse: Chocolate- good, Coffee Ice cream - Mmmm, Passion fruit mousse - there's just too much of you. It's 3/4 PF and 1/4 chocolate. The ratio is just too crazy. The passion fruit took up more than my spoon could hold, it was too much. Having it with half the amount of mousse was good. The coffee ice cream was my highlight.

We arrived on Sunday and the place was pretty empty. We ordered the apple tart with cream cheese mousse and hazelnut crust, the chocolate passion fruit mousse, and a mango sorbet bellini (?). The chocolate passion fruit mousse was beautiful and I enjoyed the citrusy, tart flavor of passion fruit with the chocolate, but the blow your mind dessert was definitely the apple tart. It was AMAAAAAZING!! I didn't think it would be that great, but something about the combination of cream cheese, hazelnuts, and lots of cinnamon was over the top. We had a really enjoyable time and on a Sunday, there really wasn't anyone there. On a Friday, the place was packed and bustling, so it was a very different feel.  I had called before I arrived in SF to see if I could get reservations, and whoever answered told me I didn't need to make them if our party was smaller than 6 people. Lame. Because they do take reservations. So make them!! And PS they have board games there. Looks like fun!",

The japanese cheese cake was too bland but the gelato on the side was good.

I could, however, see where someone might mistake this place for a retail shop. Could it be the over sized book shelf looking object used to divide the front lounge from the back tables? It does look as though it could have housed several sweater vests and polo's on it. Possibly the bar and furniture wood accents? The sharp angular edges and color does come off a bit Banana Republicy. How about the lighting scheme? Over the bar is fantastic carbon pendant lighting system. The kooky, octopusesque chandelier would not have been my first pick but I can kinda see where they were going with that...kinda. But other than that, the form follows the function. Form: two low lounge areas with red fabric seating and chests used as tables up front. A gathering of 2 &amp; 4 top tables with an awesome chalk board displaying the latest in dessert exquisitery in the back. Function: Serving only dessert, wines/beers, and a plethora of old school board games. Board games people...BOARD GAMES!!!   Behind the Bar: The large chest that acts as a table in the front lounge is way to large for the space. I found my knees knocking against it as I was constantly standing up, laughing, and pointing as I was very respectfully making fun of how horrible people are at parallel parking. Apparently some drivers can't handle 7 people staring at them as they try to fit their Honda Civic into a space that one could easily park a mini van. (of course if the driver was an Asian woman that statement would be false.)   Who's Who: One would think that since there are a plethora of board games that it would be fun for the whole family. False! I would not like to see little kids running around this place. One there isn't enough room to run around. Two if im on a romantical after dinner date, the last thing I want to concern myself with is a child staring at me as I deliver sexual innuendos over a game of Shoots and Ladders. (you might be surprise how much that game can get anyone into the right mood;) It is a great place to meet some girlfriends/boyfriends after work. It is an even better place if you go on a date, realize that you have absolutely nothing in common with the person sitting across from you, however they insist that you at least eat dessert. Instead of continuing on with the utter bore that is your date, you can take him to Candybar where at least you have a game and fantastically delicious dessert to occupy your time before rushing home to call your girlfriends and discuss how just because they are a rocket scientist for NASA doesn't make them interesting. Enjoy!",

I liked the atmosphere, and loved how I saw people playing board games by the corner, and just having a good time. We looked at the menu and realized we were still in time for happy hour, and ordered the Strawberry Kiss and Passion Fruit Delight. The cocktails were so pretty and delicious, I couldn't stop myself from sipping on it. For the desserts, we went with the \"Dessert for two\" option, which allowed us to sample four desserts from the menu for $25. This was still a hard task, but in the end we went with the Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo, Flourless Chocolate Cake, Tiramisu and Ice cream Sandwich. My favorite dessert was the flourless chocolate cake, it was rich and smooth, simply addictive.

This was a totally unexpected treat for my friend and I, who shall remain nameless to protect his identity and not get him in trouble with his lady friend and young child. We were on one of our, oh shall we say, slightly inebriated nights together. (I know, me? drunk? what? Never!!!) Anyhoo. We were out causing a lot of trouble, kickin ass, takin names and numbers and just having a blast and Candybar popped on our radar.  Sweets, you say? I don't even like sweets? I am much more of a savory kinda gal instead of sweets, but hey, maybe they have champagne? And indeed they did, along with some great sweet tasting menus to boot. I can't tell you the specifics of what we had, but I know there were some yummy chocolate offerings and again, this is coming from the girl that rarely, if ever, eats chocolate.  As far as the concept of dessert bars goes, this one is a winner. The owners are sweethearts and they are all working hard to deliver one sweet operation and I say, give em a go! I know I will again, when one of the four days a year that i actually crave sweets occurs!",

    "review_text": "I bought a Groupon for Candybar while I was living in Sweden this summer; the concept sounded so fun that I couldn't wait to check them out and the deal was really good!  My boyfriend and I decided to go to Candybar the week of Thanksgiving; I checked their web site to see what the hours were and we headed over there after dinner. It really sucked that after searching for parking we walked up to a dark shop with a hand written sign stating they were closed that week. It would have been nice to post that on the web page (hello 2011). Anyway, I was still really excited so a few friends joined us in a happy hour excursion (this time we called first).   I'll break it down in pros and cons:  PROS: + Ambiance + Well thought out cocktail recipes, we had a few and all were yummy + Desserts were delicious and very creative (we shared 4 desserts) + Board games a neat touch, we started to play one but then our party grew to 6 and that was just too much to try and keep going + Happy hour pricing was cool (drinks are kinda pricey), our first round was half price  CONS: (keep in mind they were not busy, the place was maybe half full) - S-L-O-W service. The server asked us once right after seating for our order and when we asked for a few more minutes it took long stares from all six of us to get him to come back. He was one of those servers who never actually made eye contact with his patrons so flagging him down was fruitless.  - Desserts came out WAY after drinks were served. Their gimmick is drink and dessert paring, that alone suggests they should be served together.  - It took another round of stares to get a second round of drinks. And then about 15 minutes before those drinks even made it to the table. \u00a0  I will go back to Candybar for three reasons; I want to believe they were just short staffed, I really like the concept and the desserts were amazing.",

Service was okay, although when we arrived the place was nearly empty so we took a large corner booth and were told we'd have to move for a larger party. None ever came. The desserts: yuck. I was hoping for classic decadent fare especially chocolate but the choices seemed more like something middle school girls would concoct at a sleepover. Meh. Didn't impress us at all - football game was on so not the romantic vibe I'd expected.",

Unfortunately the deserts were far below our expectations. We ordered the ice cream sundae, the tiramisu and the red velvet cake. The deserts at least the ones we had, were pre-made, and as a result the quality and taste drop below average! The redvelvet cake (my order) was way to dense- bordering on the line of just plain hard, and lacked any red velvet flavor. My girlfriends didn't care for their plates either. Out of all three the sundae was the best. Bummer. The birthday girl did enjoy her chocolate martini, hence the two stars. I wont go back.

Unfortunately for Candy Bar I have gone back a few more times and am left a bit more disappointed each time...  The layout and seating really needs to be re-arranged, the bar stools are not that comfy and it gets fairly hot in the place and the lighting is so-so. None of this would deter me from coming back as it isn't that bad but the building is new so I would think they would of done it right when they built it.   What has been a disappointment is the food, I understand they are trying to be edgy with their desserts but you have to have a few staple things on the menu that everyone will like and know. The wine list has changed some and some of their best wines are no longer on the menu. Even the wait staff seems to of slipped a bit, or maybe I just got them on a off night the last time I was there.  Having this cool concept place in the hood is great and I hope they figure things out soon. I will be back but only in hopes that they will know what they need to fix and fix it. I am not a huge dessert person and the place isn't cool enough that I will keep coming back if they don't...",

    "review_text": "The best part about Candybar is the boardgames! Who can resist a fancy card game or Candyland? Or playing scrabble in real life instead of on your iPhones? Well, at Candybar, you have the option to multitask by letting your inner child flourish, engaging in silly conversations, savoring scrumptious desserts, and lushing on sparkly drinks.   If you're the type who loves pretty food, well, you're in for some eye candy. The desserts look 10x better than it tastes. This place is perfect for food porn photographers. My party ordered the Strawberry Limeade and the Almond-Honey Pina Cotta. The Strawberry Limeade comes in a pretty little jar, and tastes like an ice cream strawberry shortcake that I can whip up in the kitchen in the matter of minutes. The Almond-Honey Pina Cotta may not photograph well due to its white color, but I love the almond creamy flavor of this masterpiece. It's somewhat like the almond tofu pudding at Chinese dessert places, but you get less for your buck.   If you love specialty sparkly drinks, this may sway you to come. I swear sparkling wines are their signature ingredient. And occasionally, soju. The mango tango bellini tastes like an adult ice cream float, but be careful when you stir the drink, it's like an elementary school volcano eruption. The passion fruit bliss cocktail is far better than the mango tango bellini as I enjoyed the fizzy bubbles of it. It's somewhat like apple cider though.   Overall, you won't ever bored here as the ambiance is fun. Although the desserts are average, the cocktails are the added splash of jubilance.   Warning: The parking is terrible in this neighborhood! I was literally circling around for 30mins before I finally gave up and parked on Divisadero and O'Farrell. Furthermore, there's a 2 hr limit on all tables.",

    "review_text": "The dessert bar is a great concept that I'm surprised I don't see more of. Candybar offers a good list of desserts, dessert wines, and even some game boards for you to play.  Candybar isn't that big but it accommodates a good amount of people. There's lounge seating and table seating. We got the lounge seating. It's uncomfortable to say the least. They seem to seat all the groups in this area but since the tables for the lounge is knee high and has limited surface area, you'll be cramming all your drinks and desserts onto one table. My back strained when I tried to reach a far plate. Added to the fact that the dessert plates are incredibly huge, it makes it more inconvenient than elegant. It would've been nice if we had the option to bring the desserts out two at a time rather than all at once.  The dessert list is pretty lengthy. You get a choice of a dozen desserts and a whole page and a half of drinks. I was really thirsty so I just stayed with water. The rest of my friends got dessert wines. Some of them are good while one was over sweet. The better choices come in smaller glasses. Since everything is on the sweet side you'll be wanting to cleanse your palate with water.  We got:  Peanut Butter Jelly Time! chocolate tart, peanut butter cream, salted candied peanuts, blackberries  Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo almond brittle, nutella powder, cantaloupe  Apple a la Mode hazelnut crust, cream cheese filling, caramel, gingerbread ice cream  Passion Fruit Chocolate Mousse chocolate cake, tuile, passion fruit curd, vanilla bean ice cream  Overall I found the desserts to be fine. This is not a negative or a plus. It's just - fine. If you got these kinds of desserts at a fine dining restaurant you'd be somewhat disappointed. If your business relies on desserts I expect it to be above par. Individual elements in the dishes are tasty but as a whole it just doesn't come together. Instead of oohing and awing you'll be going \"What's in my mouth?\" The menu sounds better than it actually is.  While some elements can be tasty, it feels like it's all pre-made and taken out of the freezer. This was especially true for the semi freddo. Ours was like a frozen brick. Every dish seemed to have similar texture problems, out of balance flavors, and in general just too much stuff. If Candybar cut their dessert list in half it would put less strain on the kitchen. Then the kitchen could concentrate on creating high quality made to order desserts instead of combining pre-made elements.  The staff was decent but they felt a bit irritated and rushed. Understaffed? I dunno. The addition of games are okay. But since there is hardly enough room to play it can be an inconvenience. I think the tables, dim lighting, and blaring music are all designed to make you want to leave. At one point the music got even louder trying to drive its customers out the door.  ____  Candybar should visit NYC's ChikaLicious dessert bar and learn some lessons. Cut your menu in half, take your time, and focus on a quality experience. Will I be back? Probably not. Not worth the half an hour wait in the cold.",

Honestly, when I first walked into Candybar I thought/said-out-loud \"Wow, there's a lot of Asians in here.\" I was just stating the facts, and at that moment I figured I think before I speak...  ANYWAYS- once we were seated it was a hard choice on what type of dessert to get. Tempted to get the dessert for two so I could try a variety, but the choices they for it had weren't popping out at me. My friend and I split the lavender creme fraiche. It was delicious!! It was light with a mix of unexpected, yet vibrant flavors. Unfortunately I wan't feeling like getting a cocktail but their prices were reasonable and everything looked yummy.   The ambiance was low lighting and candles on the table, board games on the shelf if you were feelin' a little playful and unique murals on the wall. Candybar has the laid back and effortless essence.   The one thing I would recommend, is that Candybar stay open a little later. They close at midnight on Saturdays- and didn't seem like people were quite ready to leave. Maybe 1am would be more accommodating? I'd be there!",

Con: But it starts to taste a little heavy after about 4-5 bites in.   Pro: The cheesecake layer in the Apple a La Mode was my favorite part.   Con: The ginger taste in the ice-cream was way too over-powering for the Apple a La Mode dish.   Pro: They were sweet enough to hand all the women a nice long stem of red rose.   Con: You probably won't get their V-day macaroon dessert gift to bring home if you used a Group-On deal or your bill wasn't high enough.   Great atmosphere overall.   Note: \u00a0They seem to adjust their menu once in awhile so what you saw a month ago may no longer be on the menu today.",

Usually i don't like the ones that are overpowered w/ coffee and rum cream,but this was just right.  Flourless Chocolate Banana Torte - my second favorite from the sampler. I don't like pineapple in my desserts,but it really complimented the chocolate &amp; banana ice cream together. Just melts in your mouth  Apple a La Mode - my number one favorite from the sampler. It was so soft &amp; had jst the right amount of sweetness. Taking a bite into the warm apple &amp; gingerbread ice cream together was heaven in my mouth!  Peanut Butter Jelly Time - this was a disappointment unfortunately, esp as a PB&amp;J lover myself. I didn't really taste the PB that much, mainly the blackberry jelly. It might as well have been called Jelly Time instead.  Overall, as a dessert fanatic, I really enjoyed this place &amp; absolutely recommend.

Or, just to meet up with an old friend since it's not so loud that you can't hear one another. Three stars however because I think I like the idea and ambiance/decor of Candybar rather than the actual food.  They have couches + tables near the front area and chairs + tables at the rear. The paintings on the wall are absolutely gorgeous &amp; the service is great!  We ordered the dessert sampler for two and got the lemon tart (pretty good but I wasn't really a fan of the coconut snow), tiramisu (I've definitely had better), apple a la mode (okay), and the flourless chocolate cake (okay). Nothing was phenomenal which you would naturally expect since you're at a dessert bar. I had the 50/50 which is a mix of soju, orange soda, and vanilla -- it was really good but it definitely will not get you buzzed (maybe if you had 10 it might happen =P).   Overall, I might come back if a friend insisted on checking it out but it's probably not worth the difficult search for parking.",

(we had made the change to a healthy lifestyle about 8 months ago, and i was missing my chocolate). He found candybar.  It was quiet, only a few other patrons. we were seated immediately and order cocktails, i got the triple chocolate bellini and he got the 50/50, which tasted like a creamsicle.   we grabbed connect four from the wall and decided to do the 4 for 25 and share. we got the ice cream sandwiches, tiramisu, flourless chocolate cake, and Japanese cheesecake.   everything was wonderful. The ice cream sandwich had blueberry ice cream and cookies that looked like vanilla wafers but were filled with fudge. \u00a0The flourless chocolate cake was the best i've ever had. a lot of flourless cakes tend to come out very dense and almost grainy in texture. This one, while still somewhat dense, was creamy and rich. The Japanese cheesecake was light and delicious and went wonderfully with the guava sorbet and honeydew melon that came with it. And the tiramisu was great also.   As far as the reviews that say this place is overrated i think they're just cynical. My cousin was a pastry chef and cake decorator before his passing, and he would have loved this place.   Their deserts are inventive and tasty without being overwhelming. the wine cocktails are just as delicious, and the service was great.  it definitely made our anniversary.",

Downside is that they close at midnight, however it's really just to say \"get in here before midnight!\" My friends and I arrived at 11:30pm and stayed all the way until 1:30am. The workers there don't mind you staying there to chit chat while they clean up around you (but they still filled my glass with water until we left).   We ordered: * strawberry kiss (sparkling wine, gingle ale, frozen strawberry included) * mango sparkling wine cocktail (sparkling wine, mango syrup, nice helping of mango ice cream) --- my favorite. * Japanese style cheesecake (YUM!) * chocolate ganache/raspberry cake (something like that, but it was good)  Next time I think I'll try the Jasmine sparkling wine as well as some of the dishes that are a fusion of entree/dessert during HAPPY HOUR.  All the food and drinks were great and reasonably priced, along with the service! There are boardgames to play as well!

On the bartending side, I understand it was the opening but 3 separate pieces of printer paper with the menu (sloshed with wine and crumpled from the heavy usage) didn't exactly leave the best impression with me. \u00a0On top of that, it was busy because of the night but the bartender/register were not getting along well apparently, causing supernaturally long waits to order drinks at a bar that only fit 8 people comfortably.  Didn't even both with the food or desserts as it isn't exactly comfortable to hold a wine glass, a fork and a plate while avoiding the hustle and bustle of the busy waitresses.  The interior- well if minimalist was the look they were going for they get an A+. \u00a0Personally I felt like I was in a basement.  Bathroom is singular- didn't bother looking inside or trying to go as I didn't want to make unecessary waiting in line a habit that evening. \u00a0Others tried to run for the back alleyway for the bushes however were scolded and told to come back in to add to the clusterfock of people inside.  The riesling was exceptionally good considering the rest of the debacle and I would have purchased additional bottles if it didn't take the bartender 30 minutes just to get to my order in the first place.  Clientele was the atypical wine bar crowd...well- and the bum that wandered in for 10 minutes and just smiled at everyone as he paced between the front and back of the establishment.  To say the least, this after hours sweets place left a sour taste in my mouth.  1 star from me overall and collectively with the rest of the people that were there I think would muster an additional 1 star.",

Now, I am a huge fan of both tiramisu and red velvet, and the fact that this Candybar couldn't make a decent tiramisu or red velvet cake astonished me.   I also would like it noted that all the desserts we tried tasted like it had been sitting in the refrigerator for a week.  It tasted like fridge fresh. And when I asked the waiter about it, at least he was honest and said it sits around until it's sold, and that they don't make fresh stock daily and throw away the old stock.

I thought they were tasted recently made. #unsophisticatedpalette  Regardless I loved this place and here is why: 1. I got my money's worth. In SF, an amazing dessert would be worth more than what desserts here cost. So I actually felt like I was getting a deal, because I thought the desserts were delicious. Especially the s'more one #amazing  2. The cocktails were also very good, but we had to order tea/milk to go with our desserts and didn't end up finishing the cocktails- it was too much sweetness for my recently paleo dieted sweet tooth 3. Also don't let the sampler fool you- they are BIG samples. So it was a bad idea for my bf and me to get the 4 sampler plate and another dessert #fatties 4.Word of advice: \u00a0They only have whole milk. If you are lactose intolerant like my bf or questionably lactose intolerant like me....skip the milk- or you will be like my bf farting up a storm at Candybar or like me, go home to serenade your loved ones with some bodily tunes. 5.The atmosphere was great.

Being the fatties--err, foodies--that we are, we hit up both.  Candybar looks like it could be the trendy lounge section of the gold standard of dessert bars, Chikalicious in New York. Instead of bright whites and linen tablecloths, Candybar vibes more bar and less candy: thus, I got the $2 happy hour Pacifico.  That said, the sweets are to be had here. We tried a trio: the Tiramisu, the Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Time, and the Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi-Freddo. Of the three, the latter was my favorite. All solid, none spectacular would be how I would describe it.  The cocktail menu is interesting, but isn't overly dessert-conscious. It wouldn't be surprising for it to be at a regular laid-back lounge.  That last part is what I like about Candybar most. It doesn't try too hard to be all about the sweets, letting people dig the alcohol and ambiance.  Oh, the free Connect 4 boards didn't hurt either.",

I'd advise going on an off weeknight, after dinner, or perhaps to rendezvous after work (is there a law against have dessert before supper, I think not). In any case, it's the sort of spot that's best appreciated when not completely overwhelmed with people.   Find a cozy seat, check out your fellow patrons (or mingle with them), and let the staff help you pair up wines with a few dessert selections (or cheese, please!). There's a decadent sophistication to this sort of indulgence, and if you're lucky enough to meet owner Tan Truong later in the evening (especially on a Sunday when they're finishing up bottles opened from the weekend), you are in for a mighty night!   Or so I hear.",

The red velvet cake was to die for and the infused champagne was just right. It was the perfect way to end a date night.   The second time I tried this place was after the ballet on a Friday night. They were playing 80's music and the average age of the crowd was about 23. Also, I tried the same champagne drink and it was over infused and tasted like Kool-Aid. All the kids were having fun drinking and playing board games and it's nice to know that there are fun places for youngsters to go on a Friday night that are slightly more wholesome that a meat market. However as a 40 year old woman it just wasn't my scene. It lacked elegance and sophistication for me but then again...I'm clearly not their target demographic so it's all good. I would go back on another weeknight but avoid the weekend teenyboppers. I would LOVE to see a similar concept in SF that's designed for people over 30. Some kind of replacement for Citizen Cake for a nice post theater champagne.",

Fruity: Vanilla brioche soaked in custard, served alongside candied cherries and feta ice cream. \u00a0They put the absolute right amount of each item to make each bite could be perfectly proportionate. \u00a0The bartender recommended an ice wine to go with it, which I thought too crisp. \u00a0My Rousanne/Viognier blend was perfect in taste and thickness.

But after two times of really wanting to like it, I've concluded that this place is a sham. It has all the pretenses of being gourmet, but they mix conflicting ingredients in their desserts. That's why it's so hard to choose something that sounds good. There's always some ingredient that sounds out of place and as soon as the dish arrives and you taste it, you realize your first instinct was right.   The decor is hipster-wannabe and the service... well, let's just say that we were told we could sit anywhere and then asked to move as soon as a larger party arrived. Instead of moving, we just left, annoyed because the waiter started ignoring our requests for the check.   And they don't have a liquor license so all the \"cocktails\" are with a weak bubbly.",

Other than that, I cannot find a single thing that was wrong with the place or my experience here.   The place is small, and it can get crowded, but I have never waited longer than 15 minutes for a table. The staff here are very friendly. If you have any problems, questions, concerns, need long descriptions of the menu--they will sit it out and make sure you understand everything. They also provide board games and decks of cards for anyone that wants to have some relaxing fun.   The food/drinks are artfully made, and taste amazing. Here's my mini-list of reviews:  Japanese Cheesecake (graham cracker streusel, honeydew, champagne granita, guava sorbet) - Although I feel that this is more of a lighter dessert, the combination of everything together in your mouth is perfect. Tastes more fruity and like a custard than cheesecake.   Peanut Butter Jelly Time! (chocolate tart, peanut butter cream, salted candied peanuts, blackberries) - 3 WORDS: OH MY GOSH. This is a favorite. I have gone back multiple times just to get this one. It's definitely a little bit heavier and more chocolatey than the other desserts, but still not overdone. If you like peanut butter jelly sandwiches and have a craving for chocolate, get this.  Mango Tango Bellini (sparkling wine, mango syrup, mango-tangerine sorbet) - great flavor, perfect temperature, and tastes like mango sweet wine with a hint of citrus  Triple Chocolate Bellini (sparkling wine, chocolate syrup, chocolate sorbet) - chocolate heaven in your mouth. Very similar to the mango tango, except skip the fruit and replace with chocolate (not dark). Haha, such a generic description, but there's no other way to explain it.  50/50 (soju, orange soda, vanilla) - This tastes like a delicious orange creamsicle!  I've also had one other dessert there, but I can't seem to find it on the menu at the moment =\\ Sorry! Anyways, I highly recommend this place if you've got a taste for something sweet. You won't regret it! :)",

    "review_text": "Boys and girls, let me take you on a trip to Candybar, a place very similar to the wonderful world of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. It has just been announced to the general public that a handful of Golden Tickets have been hidden amidst a vast variety of drinks and desserts. The only way to come by these tickets is by consuming a dastardly amount of liquid and/or solid sweets in a swanky, dimly-lit, cozy venue that is perfect for a girl's night out or a date. Now, what makes these tickets so special is that they grant the lucky recipients a highly coveted, all-expenses-paid visit to...  A diabetes clinic.  BOOM--pessimism served. Only because I already drank more than half my drank hehe.  Candybar is the perfect concept for someone with my propensity for all things sweet: simple cocktails (though I'm becoming a creative cocktail fangirl) and simple desserts at simple prices. And for those who want simpler prices, they offer a happy hour from 6-8 PM every day in which a few of their sparkling cocktails are slashed down to $4.  My girl and I came here on a Wednesday evening to find that only one other couple was in our way of completely dominating the entire venue with our chatter. Plus, our waiter was the antithesis of chatty, especially when I asked him if he had any recommendations. If you don't like cocktails or non-fruit-flavored desserts...why do you choose to work here?  For our desserts, we got the $10 DRUNKEN S'MORES with salted caramel, chocolate, graham cracker tart, marshmallow, topped with Bailey's chocolate sauce (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/candybar-san-francisco?select=oIXCGkVZED6KDiB7hz-2Cg#AmPOXjH81zDR02iFSj_-Rg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cand\u2026</a>). Apparently, it's popular. Apparently, it didn't sit right with my taste buds. The chocolate filling tasted burnt, though my friend thought it could be because of the Bailey's sauce. I will give some mad creds for the marshmallow. But I wouldn't recommend the dessert.  We both preferred the $9 gluten-free LAVENDER HONEY CREME FRAICHE SEMIFREDDO with nutella powder, almond brittle, and cantaloupe pieces (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/candybar-san-francisco?select=oIXCGkVZED6KDiB7hz-2Cg#54iDJCkxQFn86XNDftoCFA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cand\u2026</a>). I am a sucker for sugary nuts (HAHAHA okay I couldn't help but laugh at my own line), even more so for glazed nuts (AUGH THE IMAGERY AHAHAA), and my friend adored the lavender honey flavor of the creamy ice cream. The portion was generous but did have a few huge icy parts. Also, the cantaloupe wasn't ripe. Crud.  Onto the dranks. We ordered 4 total: the PASSION FRUIT DELIGHT (sparkling wine and passion fruit puree; $7 or $4 HH), the BLOOD ORANGE COCKTAIL (sparkling wine, blood orange bitters, and sugar cube; $7 or $4 HH), the LYCHEE GUAVA MARTINI (soju, lychee juice, and guava nectar; $8), and the 50/50 (soju, orange, cream, vanilla; $8). The first two bubbly-based drinks were both light and delicious. As for the soju-based drinks, the lychee guava did a horribad job of masking the soju's alcohol tones. On the other hand, the 50/50 tasted like a creamsicle, and the sugar made it lighter and more delicious. I think I still have yet to develop my appreciation for soju (and sake, actually), but I preferred the bubbly over the soju for sure.

Upon arrival RY complains of HA 2/2 to difficulty parking which spontaneously resolved. When finally seated pt and friends ordered the Japanese Cheesecake, Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo, Tiramisu, and the Flourless Chocolate Cake. The group also ordered the pineapple vanilla bean soju shot, blueberry pomegranate fushion cocktail, Mango tango belleni, and some other drinks that RY could not recall.

Had some sorbet and fruit on the side but otherwise unremarkable. - Will d/c and will not rechallenge due to quality inferiority and price  2) Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo: probably the best dessert of the 4 and tasted like ice cream with fruits. A bit savory and messy. - Possible recommendation to others as dessert of choice  3) Tiramisu: Biggest disappointment of them all. Was quite bland, not much flavor on top of 1cm thick milk/dark chocolate layer. - \u00a0Not a candidate for rechallenge. Recommend the tiramisu at Schuberts bakery instead as a cannot be substituted.  4) Flourless Chocolate Cake: tasted like a very rich lava cake topped with white chocolate pieces and sorbet on the side. \u00a0Unimpressed and probably the most simple and plain of the 4 desserts. - \u00a0d/c as current condition of cake no longer warrants continuation of therapy.   5) EtOH drinks: All were somewhat colorful and presentation was pleasant to eyes but very weak in terms of EtOH content. Mango Tango was the best tasting of the 5 ordered. No immediate signs of asian glow were observed. - Will monitor for s/s of intoxication but probably ok to drive and will not need DD  Bill came to be $85 for the 6 of us despite the groupon coupon. Will order a wallet scan evaluating hole created. Recommendation to avoid this place in the future as desserts although were artsy in presentation does not justify the cost and make up for taste.",

Parking...was kinda sucky, but we got lucky about a block away. \u00a0Love the decor, yet you can still dress very casual, after all, a handful of people were sporting the orange &amp; black, especially since the Giant's clinched the division win a couple hours prior. \u00a0We were feeling the music playing, though a lot of it was MJ. \u00a0Though we were seated by the door, which was open, the place got kind of warm.  We ordered: *Mango Tango Bellini ($8): Sparkling wine with mango syrup and mango tangerine sorbet. \u00a0Sweet but not overly sweet, and very refreshing. \u00a0I could sip on a couple of these all night. The waitress recommended this when I told her I was thinking about ordering the Strawberry Kiss and how I like sweet drinks. \u00a0She didn't steer me wrong. \u00a0 *50/50 ($8): This was his drink. \u00a0Soju with Orange soda &amp; vanilla. \u00a0It didn't look very appealing when it came out, but tastes really good like an Orange Creamsicle! \u00a0It kind of sucks though that you could not taste any soju at all, which made us wonder how much was in there! *Passion Fruit Chocolate Mousse ($10): Chocolate cake with passion fruit curd &amp; vanilla ice cream. \u00a0Rich, but not overly insanely chocolatey and it was light enough. \u00a0The passion fruit and chocolate worked very well together. \u00a0Glad we chose this dessert, it was one of the best desserts I've had in awhile. \u00a0  Though their drinks are delish, if you're not in a mood for drinks, you can also come to this late night spot for some unique desserts. \u00a0No more having to just settle for desserts at an HK cafe (though Candybar closes at 12). \u00a0This is a cute intimate place to go with a small group of friends for some laid back fun or with the bf for a date night. \u00a0I hope to come back with the bf for one of those date nights or happy hour!",

Anyway, I will go back to Candybar. \u00a0And I would suggest it as a great place for a date, a great alternative to a birthday dinner with friends, and just a nice place to get your sweet-on :).",

    "review_text": "I really wanted to like this place since novelty bars are kind of my thing sometimes and it's in the neighborhood. Let me reiterate: I *really* *tried*, but no amount of trying on my part can make-up for the short-falls of this place.   First of all, the 200-watt lighting. Not exactly what I look for in a bar whose aim is to be a relaxing, loungy atmosphere. The seating is just terrible. So uncomfortable and not loungy at all. The staff is obviously not having it because of the early-close license they have - they can't make as much money as they aim to, and this is exactly the attitude the staff projects. I sympathize, but I hear enough about civic issues in my daytime life. I don't want to hear about it when I'm relaxing on a Friday night.   The food falls drastically short of my expectations as well. Small portions, inconsistent flavor themes... they would definitely be in the bottom 2 of my quickfire challenge. The beverages are priced for a much more comfortable atmosphere - you know what I mean? I'd be a much better sport about paying those prices if I could at least consume my drink comfortably. And I echo the yelper who said something about their mark-up which goes above and beyond anything expected at a trendy bar.   Anyway, with a license that makes them close your doors at midnight on the weekend, they would be much better off if they were more restaurant-oriented.",

I really like the concept of having a restaurant that serves solely desserts and cocktails. Having board games to play with friends is definitely a plus!  We ordered a Strawberry Limeade, Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo, a Strawberry Kiss (Cocktail) and the CandyBar Lemon Drop Shot (also a cocktail). The desserts, in the way that it's presented, looks pretty. However, I was very disappointed with how it tasted. The strawberries on the Strawberry limeade tasted too artificially sweet. The Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo was OK, but not memorable. The Lemon Drop Shot cocktail was OK, but for the Strawberry Kiss cocktail I tasted more champagne and I couldn't taste anything that's like strawberries.  I definitely appreciate that they try to be very creative when they create these desserts, but I wouldn't pay $10 for desserts that taste mediocre.",

A lovely friend of mine recommended to double date here and we had a blast. The atmosphere is cozy, candlelight tables, laid-back seats while they play your top classic hip-hop songs. I think they had jazz music right at the start too, very nice!  Menu- Most desserts run about $6-11 which isn't too bad, and that night my friend and I ordered a cinnamon almond torte. I'm usually not a big fan of cinnamon but this just melts right in your mouth. YUM. To top that off, I ordered the peach Bellini cocktail and that was superb.  Ok the best part of the place aside from your dessert and mix-drinks fix...they have a great selection of boardgames where you can literally spend the whole night playing. Monopoly, Connect 4, Game of Life, Clue, and the list goes on and on. All the games are situated right in the middle of the lounge area, and no need to sign in or anything. You see something you like, grab it, bring it back to your seats, and enjoy! We ended up playing Battleship for hours! Indeed, brought back my childhood memories.   Because this place is located in the heart of Hayes Valley, parking is well.....impossible. We looked around literally for 30 minutes almost wanting to just nix the plan and go somewhere else, but w/ persistence, finally got a spot. So with that in mind, have patience!   So if you're like me, this place is a must see. It's a great \"after spot\" for those that are tired of the bar/club scene and just want to relax, drink, and have fun!",

It's a small, dimly lit spot and doesn't fit too many people inside. \u00a0There are tables for smaller groups in the back area and two areas up front for larger groups. \u00a0There's also space to sit at the bar in the front. \u00a0We got there around 6:45PM on a Saturday and there were a couple tables in the back occupied and a party getting started in the front. \u00a0We were greeted and seated immediately. \u00a0I like the spot. \u00a0The art on the walls are really cool and interesting. \u00a0You can definitely have quite a few conversations about the art themselves. \u00a0They also have a shelf separating the front and back areas that are filled with different board games. \u00a0We were going to play Battleship, but someone else got to it first. \u00a0Darn.  As for desserts, I ordered the ice cream sandwich which consisted of a green tea Parisian macaron, blueberries, and brown rice tea ice cream. \u00a0I, of course, had to order this because I {heart} macarons! \u00a0I was hesitant about brown rice tea ice cream, but it was actually really good. \u00a0Very light and refreshing. \u00a0A ordered the Chocolate Financier Cake which consisted of frozen Bavarian cream, cranberry sauce, almonds, and breton crumble. \u00a0We decided the frozen Bavarian cream tasted like frozen cheesecake. \u00a0It was a little hard to cut into that with our spoons. \u00a0  We also decided to get some drinks. \u00a0A got the Mango Tango Bellini which had sparkling wine, mango syrup, and mango-tangerine sorbet. \u00a0It was odd having a lump of sorbet in a drink. \u00a0It was good, but I liked mine better. \u00a0I got the Candybar Lemon Drop Shot which had soju and frozen lemonade sorbet. \u00a0Again, kind of weird having a lump of sorbet in a drink, but it was really good and refreshing. \u00a0I'd order that again.  To sum it up, very trendy kind of place to go for desserts. \u00a0Go early because parking sucks and you don't want to wait for a seat. \u00a0Note: The menu says there's a 2 hour limit at your table if there are a lot of people waiting to be seated.",

It wasn't too sweet or too lavendery, and was quite enjoyable to eat. It's topped with almond brittle which I didn't care too much for.

It'd be so much fun until my brother (or SOMETIMES myself) would get really upset because we were losing and we'd refuse to continue the game.  At Candybar, I'm sure there are lots of people who are sore losers too, but the difference is that there is alcohol and desserts to soothe things over! ;D  It's a really cool place, decor-wise. There's this amazing painting of \u00a0koi fishies...in pink clouds! The lighting is dim, but I'm sure it's a popular place for couples and dates.  I came here for a friend's birthday and had a blast! Admittedly, there aren't a lot of tables for big parties, so it was a little cozy, but whatever. It doesn't matter much when there's delicious dessert to eat! We played CandyLand and pretty much ordered everything on the menu because there were enough of us! :)  One of my favorite desserts was the peanut butter jelly time (very peanut butter-y!), the cupcakes, and the sampler plate! HMmmm! :) I feel like everything is definitely better shared, so you don't overdo it.  I would love to come back here and get my sugar fix!",

Plus they were playing songs that I rocked to at my 10th grade dance back in the 90's--no pretensions there.

They have happy hour drink specials for $4 - my strawberry bliss mimosas went perfectly with my cheesecake. Both were as cute as they were deeeelicious!

My boyfriend and I tried the Mango-tango bellini ($8), 50/50 cocktail ($8), apple a la mode ($9), and the big francescos tiramisu ($10).

    "review_text": "For a place that only offers desserts and cocktails, the menu was very boring. They use a lot of fruits and not many interesting components to the dishes. We had a very hard time deciding what to order with our groupon because nothing really appealed to us. We finally decided to get the apple a la mode and the honey almond panna cotta.  Apple a la Mode - weird. Something tasted off about it. It had also been heated and then they put a quenelle of gingerbread ice cream on top, half of which melted because it's such a small portion of ice cream on a large and hot piece the apple stuff. My friend also tasted a lot of ginger towards the end so it might not have been mixed very well and there was probably a large clump of ground ginger somewhere. She finished it because she was hungry.  Honey Almond Panna Cotta - DISGUSTING DISGUSTING DISGUSTING. The soft caramel powder did not taste like caramel at all. It tasted very oily/greasy and just gross. The texture was also not very appealing and it stuck to the spoon. I didn't like the taste or texture of the panna cotta either. The chocolate ice cream was okay but because the plates weren't chilled, a large part of that was also melted. The rest of the dessert was raspberries and blueberries, booooorringgggggg. I took a few bites, ate most of the ice cream, and just left everything else because I would have thrown up if I tried to eat any more of this shit.  The groupon was not worth it because we didn't feel like drinking so we got softdrinks instead of cocktails. They weren't willing to substitute ONE dessert for TWO cocktails (even though that would have worked out better for them in terms of what the prices are). We got the raspberry Italian cream soda, which seemed alright at first, but then it just got disgusting even after I only took a few sips. Neither of us could finish our's; not even halfway.  Looking at the menu also kind of pissed me off because they offer \"dessert for two\" which is 4 desserts, but you only get to choose from a limited amount of desserts (pretty much only half their menu) and they charge an extra $10 if you want to share between more than 2 people. Why would you have to pay more if each person is getting less of each dessert. Makes no sense! So stingy.  This place is no...just....no. Ugh.",

With its selection of scrumptious desserts, delicious cocktails, and fun board games, Candybar is the perfect date night or Girls' Night Out spot. The ambiance inside is intimate and romantic with its dimmed lighting and cozy seats, but there are a few spots to accommodate parties with a few more. You may have to wait a while if the spots are taken already, though. You may have to wait a while, period, because there aren't a whole lot of seats.  On the chance of a Livingsocial deal, my boyfriend and I decided to stop by and try this place. (I was a lot more excited than he was...) As I scanned the menu, I tried to resist the temptation to order everything. They have all kinds of desserts from chocolate to fruit to cake to ice cream to cheesecake... My sweet tooth is getting excited just thinking about it. We finally settled on the Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semifreddo and the Passion Fruit Chocolate Mousse, and for our drinks, we ordered the Mango Tango Bellini and the Strawberry Kiss.  The desserts were... oh my gosh. The semifreddo was definitely the winner of the night. Creamy and smooth with hints of lavender and honey blended together in one decadent concoction... The chocolate mousse was airy and perfect as a mousse should be, but something about the passion fruit didn't taste quite right with the chocolate. (Maybe I got spoiled with the semifreddo first.)  The cocktails were tasty but nothing too unique. The bellini was the sweeter of the two; the Strawberry Kiss had a stronger wine taste to it, but it tasted delicious after a few sips and paired with the desserts.",

Unfortunately we came at around 9 and missed happy hour, which is from 6-8, but it wasn't too crowded and for seven girls we had a corner all to ourselves. Note: I think the menu said that for Fridays and Saturdays the time limit for staying was 1 to 2 hours.  We all got various drinks and desserts and shared them, which was nice because there was so much variety. I got the honey-almond panna cotta, which was delicious. The online menu says it comes with cherries, but mine had blueberries and raspberries. Other people got the chocolate espresso pudding (the bacon added an interesting flavor), chocolate financier cake, apple a la mode (so good when I tried a small bite but probably would've become overwhelming), flourless chocolate banana torte (didn't really like the pineapple chocolate combination, but others might), and strawberry limeade (adorable presentation). The drinks were pretty tiny, especially for their price, so I think I'd only get them in the future for happy hour prices.  The best part were the activities and games littered around the tables! At ours there were these cards with different conversation topics on them that we randomly picked and answered. Kind of like fishbowl, if you've ever played it, but with better questions, and they ensured we never ran out of stuff to talk about.  Our waiter was really nice and friendly and didn't kick us out even though we stayed past closing. There was some slight confusion when he overcharged one person's card, but once we pointed it out he fixed it promptly and apologized for the mix up.   Overall, a great place to go with a group of girls--not sure if it's exactly date material since it's pretty girly, but it might work. It's very cozy and dimly lit, so it's pretty romantic. I'll definitely be trying to go again for happy hour!",

    "review_text": "Desserts And Drinks, what a great combination!   I never know this place existed until I purchased a coupon for this place from Living Socials. I couldn't resist, the name alone, loved it! It's more of a lounge than your typical bar, enhanced with fancy stuff all around. The coupon I purchased was $15 and you received $30 worth. Half off, not bad. \u00a0As soon as you enter this place you already know it's going to be fun. The ambiance and the overall vibe of this establishment is happy go lucky. The lights are dim, pink and cool colors all around. Not to mention cool artys stuff.  My two friends and I decided to sit at the bar since we thought it would be a little better since there a lot of larger groups at the couches and other tables. This turned out to be a good spot, since the service was a lot faster and the bar table was just big enough for us three! They only have one bartender, he definitely seemed super busy but was nice and very helpful.  This place also had various board games available to play. All sorts of games that you've placed as a child! Connect four, battleship, sorry etc. \u00a0We tried to play apples to apples, but we didn't have enough people. But the games definitely add another level of entertainment, especially if you're with a large group.  For our dessert we ordered 2 dishes:  - Japanese cheesecake: The name sounded interesting, which was what drew me to it. Cheesecake imported from Japan?! Cheesecake sliced by Samurias!? Hhahaha.. what it really was was some type of pound cake infused with cream cheese. Not that bad. It was light and fluffy and tasted a lot \"healthier.\" Accompanying it was a scoop of Guava sorbet. Now THIS was good. I honestly woulda been happy just eating the guava sorbet. If I closed my eyes, the flavor totally transported me back on a beach in Hawaii. Next time I'll try and just order the guava sorbet alone!  -Apple pie ala mode: This wasn't too shabby either. I'm not a Apple pie fiend. But it was good tasting. They had real apple slices which i liked because it wasn't smashed or chopped up. You got an actual slice of an an apple. The caramel and cinnamon and ice cream also matched up perfectly with this dish.   Drinks: I ordered the Mango Tango drink. Wasn't too spectacular, but it was yummy. Sorta just reminded me of a Mango/Organe Mimosa, but with a scoop of sorbet in it. The sorbet made the drink a little more fun. \u00a0For some reason this drink reminded me of an Orange Push Pop hahha, i think it was because of the sorbet floating and having to multi task drinking and eating. Overall OK.  I definitely would love to come back to this place with more friends. It seems like a chill spot to come to with friends for a low key kick back night, or even for a pre-party spot before hitting up another place. Wish we had one of these in the South Bay, perhaps I'll open up my own spot just like this (but better! =)",

    "review_text": "Happy hour. $4 Sparkling Cocktails and $3 House Sparkling Wine among other deals on Sangria and such. It was a tad past 8 PM but the server was so nice in letting us have the happy hour prices. I like the fact that the host/servers are all in casual wear. Everyone is like super chill and seemed really down to earth. One of the servers seemed like RedFoo from LMFAO. YEE!  Drinks:  Strawberry Kiss: The sweetest of the three. Had a drunk strawberry at the end. Bonus Jasmine Sparkle: My personal favorite because the jasmine was just a really nice sweet and subtle flavor to the drink.  *for these 2 drinks, the flavor was really strong at the end. A super sweet and yummy end but I would have preferred it throughout. Maybe stir it around a little before you drink it.  House Sparkling Wine: EH. It was ok. The moscato I had in the water bottle in the car was better.  Dessert:  Ice Cream Sundae: I was expecting like the regular whip cream and heaps of ice cream deal. I was pleasantly surprised with a sort of deconstructed form of ice cream sundae. Three scoops of ice cream on top of brownie with a pulled apart macaron on two of the ice creams. Caramelized bananas and a decent amount of cut up strawberries. Not quite sure still it if it worth $10, but it was really yummy! I especially liked the caramelized bananas. It was the \"healthiest\" ice cream sundae I've had. :)  Value wise, I'm going to try the dessert plate for 2 for $25 next time I come. The drinks were not as sweet until the end so I was kinda disappointed. They were still yummy though. I had an expired groupon so overall it was $8 tax and tip. Pretty good! Saw a fellow yelper seated next to me. East Bay to SF, yee-uh. :)  TIP: Play drunk battle ship. Every time you get a hit, your partner has to take sip. Quite a fun game. Especially with yummy sparklys!",

    "review_text": "Little tip: Places like this are magnets for \"sophisticated\" girls-night-outs. As my friend and dessert industry insider reasoned, \"well if nobody's getting laid tonight anyway you might as well cut the crap and go straight for the 4-course dessert.\"   Unfortunately the prices are a bit steep for anyone to actually get drunk off the sweet wine so you'll have to settle for sugar highs.  We've been hoping for a dessert-focused nighttime place to come to SF for awhile. Boston had one called Finale, spun off of a HBS class project. Candybar has much better food, but what those Harvard grads figured out is that you need to be near theater destinations to get the kind of traffic you need to stay packed once the novelty wears off. And the Independent isn't quite this crowd I think. As such Candybar will have to work harder for your $9 ice cream scoop purchase. Maybe try to pull you from one of the nearby destination restaurants that are popping up around here left and right.  It might just be good enough to succeed. Everything we tasted was excellent. The cheesecake \"schmear\" (god would I love that on my bagel in the morning).. The brioche, basically a dense chocolate cake but with an insanely good balsamic caramel ice cream.. The luscious dark chocolate sorbet (you could skip the \"foie gras\" tapioca they put with it). The only off note was the baked alaska: too sweet, but you kind of expect that.",

This little cute joint is a great place to spend your evenings with your boo ting or a couple of friends. I've tried many things on their menu but my favorite by far is their Apple Ala Mode and Passion Fruit Chocolate Mousse. A bite filled of yums and noms that melts at the tips of your tongue! Definitely a dessert place to try. Finding parking may be difficult so I suggest just parking a block or two away and walking. The wait times are always longer on the weekends however if you stop by on a random weekday say Tuesday or Wednesday, there'll definitely be a table for you! :)  P.S - ALL COCKTAILS ARE DELICIOUS.",

Unfortunately, the drinks and desserts we ordered tasted like pure sugar and resembled nothing like the ingredients they're composed of. They were all so sweet that it became bland. If your tastes are refined........this place will not satisfy you much.   Nice place to hang out with friends, if you succeed at getting a table inside the small space. It gets pretty loud in there, so definitely not the spot for real talk.  Friendly staff. Lots of selections. But won't be back anytime soon.",

Drinking 4 of these would be like drinking one regular glass of sparkling wine. Not good!

The only one that came even close was the Lavender Honey. I was so sad!  I loved the location and the decor. I really loved that they had a vast selection of board games to play.

It looks a tad dirty in there with little to no comfortable seating, which is odd to me since it appears they want you to stick around and play games or something.  My husband and I were there during the week around 8 or 9pm and there were maybe another two couples in the place. We chose to sit by the front window on one of the cushioned bench seats, though the waiter told us they liked to save that spot for groups. Again, there was no one else there and there were PLENTY of tables available. But guess what happened when a small group showed up about 15 minutes later? Yep--we were told to move. Seriously---there were plenty of spots!  Anyhoo, we had already ordered and I had already paid for the groupon anyway....  I got the peanut butter jelly time dessert with a forgettable and too-sweet drink (not on the menu any more anyway), and my husband got the passion fruit chocolate mousse with a blood orange cocktail. \u00a0 The drinks were just ok. Nothing I would ever order again. Though the desserts were really delicious. I especially liked how my husband's looked like a little diarama of Chichen Itza.  All in all I probably would've been more thrilled about the place had we not been kicked off the table we had originally chosen. Or had we been a group we probably would've been treated a little better, not that the service was bad--it was just a feeling of \"we don't care if you're here or not\".",

The place itself is very small, but the set up made it feel very open and spacious. We didn't make reservations, and the place was already pretty full. The host was very accomodating and sat us within 15 minutes. It looked like he did some rearranging as the table he sat us already had a \"reserved\" sign on it.   I absolutley love champagne, and I loved that their cocktails were all mixed with champagne. Delish. Desserts were good as well- my favorite was the macaroon ice cream sandwich. At only $4 it's also the cheapest on the menu. :) The thyme ice cream I read so much about was also very good, but I didn't enjoy the brownies it came with very much.   I really liked this place. The concept is really different too- they have a ton of board games available and they don't rush you to leave. Trust me, we played Catch Phrase for a good hour or so. :) And dessert and champagne are two of my favorite things....i will definitely be back!",

The place is dressed in an intriguing style of art from a local artist. I was captivated by one in particular. It is also dimly lit to create an ambiance; but not so much that you can't see around the room. The music is an assortment of several genres; but all of what's popular one various radios stations currently.  The menu consists mostly of sweets (of course,) and wonderfully tasting ones at that! I had the chocolate mousse cake, which. . . if I had died at that moment of clogged arteries. . . I would have died happy. SERIOUSLY. YUMMY. GAH! One of my friends had the S'more dessert and the other had the tarty-granola one. All of us were incredibly impressed!  The drinks were also VERY sweet, but very well mixed.

It's a great place to celebrate birthdays or to just hang out for a night out after dinner to have delicious desserts or a drink and play board games or read a good book. I love how peaceful it is here and it's a great atmosphere. The music is relaxing but not boring. The staff is friendly and are always on top of everything making sure you have a great experience . I have no complaints of this place. The art on their walls are amazing and even the bathroom is very cute and detailed. I am very happy that San Francisco has a place like this! My favorite wine is the blu Pom and for dessert I recommend the ice cream sandwich which is a macaron with honey dew ice cream and melon bits on the side it's to die for! It's a great experience you must come here!",

Now the desserts... had the green tea ice cream sandwich. Far too sweet! Green tea is meant to be paired with something subtly sweet but \"French macaron\" wafer was heavily sticky, like a failed macaroon that gathered too much moisture.The accompanying blueberries were a little disappointing. The chocolate nibs were so sparing that there was nothing to taste. The red velvet had a nice touch with the coconut shavings sprinkled on it, but again the cake itself was too sugary. Mint ice cream was excellent- should have bigger portions! The blueberry pomegranate soju reminded me of cough syrup.  I have a sweet tooth for sure, but I like flavor not just sugar. Candy bar excels at flavored ice cream and continues to impress me in that department.  Somehow most people come here as couples or in a big group, so its not a great hang out for single guys. Warning ladies, there's shady guys that hang out at the bar.  Parking is still a challenge, but at least there's other restaurants and bars to check out all near by.",

I ordered the Peanut Butter Jelly Time and a Red Velvet Cake, per the server's recommendation (and Yelp). Both were good, but I actually didn't get all the hype about the PB &amp; J. Yes, it tasted just like the sandwich that was in your lunchbox growing up, but I don't associate those flavors with dessert and it just wasn't sweet enough. The Red Velvet Cake was served with a vanilla ice cream and the pairing just didn't work for me. Plus, red velvet is just so played out by now that it's tough to be excited by it unless it's really phenomenal. I really should have gone with my gut and tried one of the cheesecakes or ice-cream based desserts.   I will definitely give this place another try, as their other desserts all sounded good. Maybe I'll order better next time.",

Parking is EXTREMELY difficult to find, and to be honest, it's probably not worth it to trek all the way here solely for Candybar. The wait is roughly around half an hour on Saturday night.  Candybar offers drinks and dessert. The drinks aren't worth it, in my opinion, since they are some form of flavor mixed with wine/champagne. The desserts are delicious, and very reasonably priced for the portions. We tried the Ice Cream Sandwich (must get!), Tiramisu (delicious, but not any better than your average tiramisu), panna cotta (good!), and passion fruit mousse (good, but would not try again).   Overall, I wouldn't come here regularly, but I would recommend this place for a first date.",

I want to come back and try their other goodies.   Candybar presents a casual scene framed with elegance. They provided board games for groups which is a very nice touch. They also had an eye catching curation of artwork on the walls. Incredibly contemporary works and easily commercialized as they do sell each individual piece. All things combined created an enjoyable place to hang out. It felt like a coffee shop where people may study or read, except there's candle light and booze.

The staff was super-friendly and helpful. We had the pork terrine, which was tasty. The crostinis they provided weren't enough, so we asked for more. No problem. I think they're still working out their portions, but were very receptive to our constructive criticism.  We sat in the front window, which doesn't have much of a view (parked cars on Fulton). Maybe that's why they have books and games. J and I played Connect Four (J 7- Billy 6- damn, i'm buying). It was fun but maybe a little loud for the vibe of the place- every time we finished a game, the sound of the checkers hitting the table drew a neck craning from the other patrons. But screw it, we were having fun.  Derek, one of the owners, is supernice and talked to us for a long time. And it seems Candybar is a family affair with one sis serving and another providing some amazing artwork for the walls.  Bottomline, Candybar is as advertised- sweet and salty. But mostly sweet.",

Great art on the walls that make you stare long and hard, no it's not abstract or Van Gogh or anything. Just really pretty, urban and loud! I LOVE it. Need I say more? \u00a0Gladly...   We ordered 3 deserts my personal favorite and maybe the entire parties favorite is the Ice Cream Sandwich! Reviews as follows:  ICE CREAM SANDWICH: \"Takes the Cake for the BEST Desert &amp; doesn't even have any cake in it!\" A super fun \"birthday cake\" looking macron with exceptionally delicious honeydew ice cream in the middle, drizzled with chocolate ganache, berries and honeydew chunks on the side. Totally gluten free. Though the menu said the macron is Almond (which in most cases I would pass on a) this macron did not taste almondy at all, this works in my favor but the friend who ordered it may be have preferred a more almondy macron. The ice cream was sooo good, if I were to go back I would order JUST a side of honeydew ice cream   STRAWBERRY LIME AID: \"Sweet Tarty Perfection.\" A cute little parfait cup holds layers of soft vanilla cake, light cream, strawberry mousse and syrup drenched strawberries. I would have strongly preferred fresh strawberries because this is a desert bar but hey! It still taste good.  APPLE ALA MODE: \"As Expected.\" The hazelnut crust coming out soggy and cold was NOT expected but the cream cheese filling had a nice smooth texture. The caramel and the gingerbread ice cream made a really delicious blend, this desert is pretty much as expected. Just make sure when you order it you emphasize your crust being warmed.  From ALL the drinks that were sipped on I'll just review one of my favorites.  Though ordered virgin I'm sure The PEACH DRINK would be good for all you alcohol drinkers, if your looking to go virgin this may be your best option.  We played rounds of Apples to Apples and I'll have you know I won FIRST PLACE, ahem ahem... In the first round. \u00a0LOL",

My most recent visit was nice. It felt wonderfully indulgent to sit and sip frou frou cocktails while sharing three different desserts.

Heads up: the parking situation in this area is downright disgusting.

Some things are so \"practical\" it actually is pretentious.   Aaaanyway, back on track.   Surprise your date and take her here after dinner.

Desserts/Drinks ordered:  Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo  almond brittle, nutella powder, cantaloupe  Was a little iffy on ordering this, since it was something new and unusual for me, but nonetheless, it was interesting- and interesting in a good way! It had all the right textures combined, creamy and crunchy and seemed to be the right combination for my taste buds.  Apple a la Mode  hazelnut crust, cream cheese filling, caramel, gingerbread ice cream  This was not my choice, but hey, why not try something I would never order, right? It was way too sweet for me, although the ice cream was delicious.  Jasmine Sparkle  sparkling wine, jasmine, lemon  This was perfectly sweet and sparkly and passed my taste test! \u00a0Worth a try if you like jasmine tea!  Strawberry Kiss  sparkling wine, ginger ale, frozen strawberry  Not my choice again, and of course, it failed, sad to say. Very disappointing- I can easily make this myself, which I have, and it tasted ten times better! This one felt like they just poured in champagne and dropped in a couple of frozen strawberries (actually that's probably what they did). Please change this concoction up!  Overall, cute place for a girls' night out, a date or a Saturday hangout. Definitely worth a try for their unusual desserts.

Inside, I loved the paintings, the furniture/set up, and the romantic/jazzy atmosphere!   We ordered two desserts (tiramisu and ice cream sandwich) and two cocktails (strawberry kiss and a blood orange sparkling wine). Individually, each of these were pretty good. Although the desserts + sparkling wine didn't quite go together, so we had to eat the desserts first in order to enjoy the wine afterwards. The mix of flavors didn't go hand in hand as I'd imagined.  -- Tiramisu: Pretty good - but not the best I've had. Personally I like my lady fingers in my tiramisu to be more moist than Candybar's, but there was still a likable balance of espresso taste with the mascarpone cream.  -- Ice cream sandwich: As a fan of honeydew in general and huge fan of macarons, this was great! It was a giant macaron sandwich with three scoops of delicious honeydew ice cream plus some small chunks of honeydew and cantaloupe. I'd never had fresh fruit with a macaron, let alone ice cream, too. But I actually tried eating it as a sandwich, and it was pretty good!  -- Sparkling wines: The sparklyness of the wines was hard to pair with the desserts. The blood orange one was very distinct and hard to find elsewhere, which I like! The strawberry was alright.",

My pants matched my shoes, and my purse matched my sweater which matched my necklace. I was clearly still on a Sex and the City \"fabulous\" streak.  And then I learned Candybar was closed on Tuesdays.  So a few Mondays later, I met pals here, a place I had been itching to visit since it opened a few months ago. It's not exactly what I expected, as they have a range of savory dishes, but I still enjoyed the food, the location and the company.  It was odd how no other customers came in the whole time me and my gals were sampling their bites. The fun book selection almost makes up for that, but I still think the joint could benefit from a bigger crowd.  Their tiny dishes were very, very creative. They say the menu changes every day, but we decided to go with beef cheeks (lol name) with chocolate-covered pepper, pork belly with sorbet, beet salad with cocoa bits, a chocolate cannoli and something else I can't remember. The most interesting dish was probably a foie gras pb&amp;j (foie gras mixed with cream and a jelly-like side), which I cold-heartedly enjoyed since it's probably going to be banned in California before long. I loved my drink (rose of pinot noir) and downed a couple with the meal.  The most fun part was realizing that these eccentric combinations actually work. It's on the pricey end, but copious bench seating and low tables make it a good spot for lengthy girltalk.",

Dessert items are $8-$9 each and are presented quite attractively:   - The chocolate mousse was definitely my favorite. It had the right sweetness and texture and went very well with the malt ice cream. There are a few drops of mango sauce around the mousse that balanced out everything (would have ordered another if others weren't full).  - The banana bread pudding was ok, not outstanding but not a skip either. It seemed like a wet banana nut bread with excellent vanilla ice cream. I didn't notice the Bailey's Creme that well. - The blueberry mochi cake was pretty good, though the green tea ice cream that came with it really confused the tastebuds (seemed like the combination was meant for a true foodie).  - The cocktails are mostly sweet drinks (i.e., bellinis=most have champagne...oh, I mean \"sparking wine\" to the Frenchies). Prices are $7-$8 each, but the sangrias were $6. We did try the \"50/50\"=soju, orange soda, vanilla; it was good but recommend to have it before or while eating the desserts, else it will taste bland. The cappuccino to finish up the night was good too.  It's a great place to stop in after special occasions, or if you do not want \u00a0to hit bars and noisy lounges. That is, this venue is quiet enough for convos but not too much that it feels dead. It has an inviting, loungy and feels hip to hang out in. The website's pics do not give an idea of how inviting and warm the atmosphere is. There are bunches of board \u00a0games (e.g., Candyland, Connect Four, '80s trivia cards, etc.) and coffee table books for perusal. The wall is decorated with very impressive paintings.  Even with super-tough parking in the area, it is worth a visit. Since it is a small place, seating maybe 25-35 people (but can hold up to 70 if need be; no furniture, standing room only), a YEE is out of the question. But, it would be good for a UYE...coughs.",

    "review_text": "I used to really like going to this place for a fun after-dinner date. Yes, you can play board games while you drink cutesy cocktails and munch on some sweets. But when you break down the actual quality of what you're getting for the price, it's not so great. It took several trips for me to realize this.   Over time the taste of the desserts have become underwhelming. Specifically I recall their red velvet cake tasting super bland, like it was just taken out of a box, cut up, and I was charged ten bucks for it. I also don't have fond memories of their servers. They really don't do much but you feel guilted into giving them a large tip because your bill is pretty high.   But you're paying for the atmoshere, Right!?! Meh. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night you will most likely have to wait a while outside to be seated, so have fun watching everyone play drunken Connect Four through the window, hope you're dressed warm.   When you do get a table, if you're there as a couple you will probably have to get cozy with another couple. And if it's a packed house good luck getting any of the good board games. You're probably playing some matching game from your Grandma's attic.   Overall, I'd probably take an out-of-towner here for the novelty of Candy Bar but as an SF resident - i'll pass. Grab Candyland, a bottle of vodka, a Safeway cake, light some candles, and do the same thing in your own living room.",

I got the brownie, tried key lime pie, chocolate cake and red velvet cake. My favorite was the brownie, you just can't go wrong with this classic food staple. Cocktail-wise, I don't recall the name of my drink but it was champagne with a thawed frozen strawberry, kinda odd - why the frozen fruit? It was just floating there, not adding to taste or aesthetics.   The service was the worst part of the visit. It wasn't crowded yet it took almost 20 minutes to be acknowledged by the waiter, then he forgot what my friend ordered. Then they didn't have the syrup to make the drink she wanted. Then they couldn't make her drink again for some reason. After the desserts came out, they finally brought out her drink. And my other friend asked for a glass of water when the order was taken but the water didn't get to the table until after most of the desserts were eaten.",

I felt the execution of the desserts weren't that great, and based off the Yelp reviews and my friend's perception of how this place would be, I imagined the desserts would be better than the decor, at the least.  I barely tasted in lavender in the Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semifreddo, which tasted like a bland breakfast. \u00a0The smores were even subpar to the smores I've made on the beach. \u00a0Perhaps more desserts would have been ordered but I didn't want to be disappointed. \u00a0We still had leftovers on the two desserts we ordered and I'm confident I could've made a tastier dessert with a Googled recipe at home.

    "review_text": "Great concept. I REALLY wanted to like this place. Like REALLY. My sweet tooth is legendary and the idea of an entire restaurant devoted to desserts BLOWS MY MIND. This place is really new so I feel bad writing a poor review but really, there's sooooo much room for improvement. I'm hoping they get it together because I love the idea and want it to succeed. Here are my thoughts broken down by area.  Ambiance - It's a bit sterile, the walls are stark white. The tables and chairs are dark wood. There are exposed pipes and exhaust type things. I wish they'd done the walls in a warmer color. They have lighting issues too. If you go in around dusk they have to keep the fluorescent light in the kitchen on which totally disrupts the atmosphere.  Service - Pretty spotty. We had the wrong dishes brought to our table not once, not twice but three times. But I'm willing to over look this since they're so new.  Food - The important part. We were surprised to find they had a savory menu and even more surprised to find out it was pretty bad. (I later found out that in California you can't serve alcohol without a savory menu. LAME!) Anyway, their savory menu definitely needs work. I had the pork terrine and it was gross. Plus they don't give you enough crostini. I had some of my friend's duck liver pate, which was good but again, not enough crostini. I tried another friend's hamachi with kumquat and avocado which was bland and tasteless. I was really disappointed. On to the desserts. We got two of the four course tasting menus. The first course was a meyer lemon fizzy drink with mint gelee, it was to cleanse the palate and it was nice but to me, it doesn't really count as a course per se. Next came the four desserts we chose from the menu. First up, the chevre cheesecake with nicoise olives and coconut sorbet. It was a deconstructed plate that actually worked and I found quite delicious. Next, chocolate brioche with balsamic caramel ice cream and lime yogurt. It wasn't really a brioche and the lime yogurt didn't work at all. Bummer. The temperature on the cake was too hot and it was kind of burnt tasting and the lime yogurt added this totally jarring tangy note to the dish. The last thing I want my chocolate to be is tangy. Next came the baked alaska with blood orange sorbet and fennel and honeycomb which was mediocre. I think maybe baked alaska should be restricted to ice cream and not sorbet. It was again way too tart against the creaminess of the meringue. Last, the warm vanilla pudding cake with pickled mango and olive oil which I quite enjoyed. I found it light and warm and delicious. The last course was their take on milk and cookies which was a delicious shortbread type thumbprint cookie with malted milk (ovaltine!) which I found cute, creative and delicious.  So overall a kind of up and down experience. Hopefully this place will get its legs under it and balance out the menu and service.",

I was in love. \u00a0($8) Serious heart-on for the candilicious drinks here.   Dessert: we split the Japanese cheesecake, with guava gelato and I think some kind of nutty toffee crunchy situation. I wish I could remember what else was on the plate because it was LEGIT. Shockingly authentic - fluffy and light and only a touch creamy. Very very tasty and highly recommended for pre-clubbing/dancing/bar-hopping/sexing purposes. :) ($10) The plate was big enough to share, esp because we'd been eating nonstop that entire day and had a huge dinner. I've definitely been thinking about this cheesecake since leaving Saturday night. Plus I feel like I get my money's worth when i order something a restaurant that is legit difficult to replicate at home - the special anti-gluten flour that goes into Japanese cheesecakes is freaking hard to find. Also, I haven't been to a handful of gelato places that have guava gelato, so bonus points for that. SO GOOD.  Ambiance is pretty hip. GREAT eye candy, and the servers are hot. Music is too loud tho - either do your unapologetic top-40 hits or some classy low jazz in the background. I have no idea what we listened to, and it was loud, obscure, and so boring.  Concept is too cute - nothing says love connection like a violent, trash-talking game of Connect-4. :) They do need to provide equipment so people can play Battleshots though (see googleImages). I would pay good money to play Battleshots with their delicious candy cocktails. Until then, Boytoy and I will settle for PvZ on iPad while sipping bellinis and sweet sweet kisses. This place needs a smush room, also.   All in all, this is definitely a new favorite in Divis. Just be sure to set aside an extra 30-45 min to find parking. And there will be a wait.

    "review_text": "Desperately craving sugar and champagne one Saturday evening, I coerced two of my guy friends to go with me to Candybar with promises of great happy hour deals on a Saturday.   The commute via public transportation was super-convenient -- right off the Divisadero bus route. The place itself is a little unassuming and easy to miss, but luckily a guy who apparently lives across the street overheard me say, \"Yelp said it was a bit hidden ... Think that's it?\" to my friends as I pointed to across the street, and he confirmed with a no-nonsense, \"The Candybar - yes,\" as he carried his groceries up his stoop.   As soon as we walked in, we were welcomed by a warm, sugary scent. We got there right at 6PM and there was only one other small party already seated. We sat by the window and immediately grabbed a few of the sillier board games. I would say good selection of games and although it is an atmosphere that encourages a date-night sort of feeling, none of the waiters batted an eye when one of the games called for a member of our party to accomplish the \"challenge\" of getting on all fours and proceeding to \"shake\" and \"wiggle\" his booty at us to a song for 90-seconds.   To the food and drinks: Everything we ordered was shared and loved by all. Not a single complaint. We ordered the flourless chocolate cake with mango yogurt ice cream (not sure why so many other Yelpers hated on the mango yogurt ice cream so much ... maybe they didn't realize that it was mango _yogurt_ ice cream and were put off by the yogurty flavor? At any rate, we thought it was the perfect complement to the melt-in-your-mouth chocolate cake), the lavender honey creme fraiche semi freddo, and the Japanese cheesecake. There was a ten minute wait on the Japanese cheesecake because the chef was just finishing putting it together (we did arrive right at opening), and frankly, that was a plus in my mind -- meaning it was very fresh.   We also tried every cocktail on the happy hour list and, while all were amazing, the two best would have to be the strawberry kiss and the jasmine sparkle.  All in all, we ended up staying for two and a half hours when we probably would have normally stayed about half that time because of the fun board games and lengthy list of tasty cocktails.   I highly recommend checking it out if you're in the mood for tasty and unusual desserts, paired with sparkling wine and silly board games.",

The night started out with three friends walking into Candybar looking for dessert and some wine. We got there in time for their happy hour special, $2 red or white sangrias. We'll take a round! The white sangria was sweet and refreshing and had a ton of fruit in it. MMm Mmm... We also ordered one dessert a piece and when everything was laid out on the table we all dove into all of it. Salted Buttermilk Panna Cotta with frozen grapes and olive oil, Black Twig Apple Pie and Goat Cheese Sherbet, and Cayenne Cinnamon Chocolate Mousse. Holy cow is all I can muster. Each one of these items was so different from the other, and so delicious in it's own right.   We kept things interesting by getting into their game stash and played a game of Candyland and Shoots and Ladders! That's right, how awesome is that?! Dessert, wine, friendly staff, a great atmosphere, and old timey games... is there anything better?  We finished off the night with some fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and malted milk. I can honestly say that we indulged to the fullest and after a night like that I can't wait to go back. Consistency is the only thing that will give this place it's last star.

Wine, sparkling wine, and soju cocktails up the ante while you beat your companions at checkers or Connect 4.

It's a really good thing for my waist and my wallet that I don't live closer to Candybar.  Food: 5 stars Value: 4 stars (it's a bit pricey without a Groupon) Service: 4.5 stars Ambiance: 5 stars",

The lighting and the artwork on the walls provide a romantic atmosphere- can't wait to bring my boy here! Romantic but still a swanky place to take your friends to show off your neighborhood.

Too bad we were idiots and decided to play Candyland, which wasn't as fun as we remembered...  We got:  White sangria: Tasty  50/50: Delicious! LIke a real orange creamsicle drink!  Italian soda: Not sweet enough. Just bubbly.  Nacho dish: I don't remember exactly what it's called, but it was different, creative, and good. There were cinnamony, sweet pita chip things with shredded mango, avocado yogurt, papaya, horchata ice cream, (maybe some other things), and two sugared jalapeno slices on top. Looked exactly like nacho chips but it was a dessert.  Ambiance: I like their decor and the painted art on the walls. I'm not much of a fan of dim lighting, especially when I'm eating food. We couldn't see the colors of the nachos. I like the big windows they have too.  Service: Friendly and attentive, but it was also too attentive...like they wanted you to leave asap. 10 seconds after we finished something, they cleared it. Same with putting out games away and leaving them on our table. They also give you the check about 2 minutes after you finish your last order. It's like a place where you chill, but they don't seem to want you to do that...annoying for the current customer, but good for those waiting to be seated.",

I really liked the romantic lighting that they have here; the votives on every table add a soft touch.   We had the buttermilk vanilla panna cotta, passion fruit delight, and triple chocolate bellini. The concept of the triple chocolate bellini sounded better than it tasted. The passion fruit delight was really good; the passion fruit syrup added some sweetness to the sparkling wine. I expected to really like the panna cotta, but I was disappointed. The best part was the chocolate macaron that sat on top of the panna cotta. The strawberries in the balsamic reduction weren't bad either. I think the panna cotta itself would have tasted better if it hadn't been made with buttermilk since the strawberry balsamic reduction was pretty tart already.   Overall, cool place; I would definitely return to try something else.",

This place is screams COITUS.. I came here with two dudes (my hoes) and they loved it. We bought a coupon from Gilt City and split desserts. Like other reviewers have kindly noted, there really isn't anything that sucks. Every dessert is artfully done and so yummy. I'm surprised the owner didn't go on to work at some five star restaurant as the dessert chef. \u00a0But hey, no complaints here.  Thank goodness I have lady parts because that meant I could order the cocktail called Strawberry Kiss, which was tasted like I kissed a strawberry. As for desserts, we had the Straus Yogut Cake, Peanut Butter Jelly Time, Strawberry Limeade, Tiramisu, and the Chocolate Cake. I think my favorite was the Straus Yogut, but my hoes' favorites were the Strawberry Limeade and Peanut Butter Jelly Time. Like I said, there's really no going wrong.

We finally stuck it out the other evening and drove around and around within two or three block radius of Candybar (mind you while cursing in aggravation and witnessing a parking spot fight) and after about half an hour later we scored a questionable \"parking spot\". The wait for a table wasn't horrible. It was about 30 minutes.   I liked the concept of this place but was somewhat disappointed with the offerings on the menu. For a place called Candybar I expected more...and quite honestly better.   I ordered the Strawberry Kiss cocktail and it was delicious. I'm not much of a cocktail drinker however the name appealed to me. And totally had me buzzing for the remainder of the evening.   Along with it I had the Ice Cream Sundae which included a couple macarons, (extremely hard ones) brownie, vanilla anglaise, strawberries, strawberry ice cream and bananas. It was edible but the brownies sure were not. The brownies were incredibly hard to cut with my fork so I ate everything else around it and didn't bother with the brownies in fear that I'd crack a crown or something.  I want to give Candybar another try but only if I get lucky with the parking. Otherwise it might be another three years before I get a chance to visit again.",

Flavored salt added a special touch to the drink too. Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo was very creative with many different components such as mixed candied praline, but cantaloupe pieces was very bland and tasteless. And you can just forgo the tiramisu as you can probably get better ones else where. On a final note, presentation for the dishes was very nice.   Service: Our server was very nice, our drinks came out first and dessert came slight after.  Environment: This is definitely a good place for a date, with dim lighting and cool art pieces, this place gives off a romantic feel.  Price: Desserts run about $10 a piece, which are a good price for an elegant dessert. While drinks are about $7 or $8 each glass, which does seem a bit pricy.   Overall, I feel this is a great place for a date or hanging out with friends, plus there are games here to play if you like. I do feel there are hits and misses with the desserts, and pricing wise it is a bit on the higher end.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MMZxpqVRF2YWQc08-VxQ?select=3q0Fvtb75Vowu61ob5ZVnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MM\u2026</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MMZxpqVRF2YWQc08-VxQ?select=sIh9vy-rhJFR8z1Wi9JrKA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MM\u2026</a>",

But for those with a palette for desserts; this place serves subpar desserts for the price you are paying.   Each item is around 8-10 dollars and although they throw in ingredients like lavender, chocolate chiffon and calamansi cream: the execution comes up short.   Tiramisu: Too much cream not enough lady finger, not enough coffee taste. It was like eating mascapone cream with chocolate crumbles on top.   Lavender Honey Cream Fraiche Freddo: Was not good....The nutella powder that they put around the plate haphazardly was way to overpowering and awkward. It was just placed around the plate, how were we suppose to eat it? mix it? by itself?   Ice cream sundae; Was the only thing i enjoyed but really, you can't mess up a ice cream sundae...just scoop ice cream onto a brownie.   Champagne: tasted delicious, didn't give much.   Wait time: Can be long, especially if you have a large group. I guess you pay for the environment and a nice 'hang out' place with friends.

So, you have to be open minded to something different and new.

I had the Candybar Dessert for Two Sampler for $25 to share, which includes four choices of select desserts. We opted for the apple a la mode, honey-almond panna cotta, tiramisu, and strawberry limeade. The apple a la mode was probably the best of the four. It had hazelnuts in the cake for some texture, and the cake itself was very moist. The caramel sauce gave the cake a slight sweetness, and the gingerbread ice cream was a nice topping. The next best one would be the honey-almond panna cotta. It was very soft and light, and the almond flavor was very mild. It also came with fresh berries and a scoop of chocolate ice cream. I thought the tiramisu was a little dry. Usually they have a lot of mascarpone filling, but Candybar's tiramisu didn't. Also, it was chocolate-rum flavored, so it was too rich for me. I wasn't a big fan of the strawberry limeade either. It's supposed to be strawberry mousse with vanilla cake, but I found it overall too mushy. It was also a little sour because of the calamansi cream, which is not a taste I generally like for desserts.  I most likely wouldn't come to Candybar again for desserts, but instead for their cocktails and old school board games. At this fun, unique dessert house, it's all about the atmosphere. But good luck trying to find parking in this neighborhood (NOPA = NO Parking Available)! And come early, around 7PM or earlier, to avoid the wait.",

    "review_text": "At last! I get to try this place out with my good friends! :D  Came here for dessert after a delicious meal at Roam Burger (check it out!). We were immediately seated down in the booth where our server gave us plenty of time to decide what to get.  We ordered:  Strawberry Limemade: Nice moist cake with strawberries, cream and strawberry mousse. This dessert was good but a bit on the sour side for me. If you like sour foods and candies, get this. If you like a little bit of sour, share this. Definitely don't recommended getting for yourself if you don't like sour too much.  Macaron Sandwich- SO DELICIOUS!!! Yes, caps lock were necessary because the macaron sandwich was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I guess they change the flavors of the ice cream sandwiches frequently but at the time, I got the almond macaron with melon ice cream in it. The sandwich was plated on a bed of chocolate ganache and sprinkled with diced melons. The macaron was nice and chewy and the melon ice cream was...drools... so fresh and light! The chocolate ganache added more sweetness to the plate and the melon cubes were just a nice crunch to the dish. ***RECOMMENDED***  Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo- Least favorite dessert from here. Never been a fan of flowers yet alone anything that taste like it. Since my friend ordered this, I felt obligated to at least try it. The dessert was very light but I wasn't a fan of the taste (for obvious reasons). The almond brittle on the other hand, was so yummy! It added a nice sweet crunch to the dish since the main attraction of the dish was so light. Get this if you like lavender flavored foods!  Tips:  ~Come here when they open to avoid waits since guests here have a 2 hour limit once seated (people will actually stay that long).  ~Happy Hour from 6pm-8pm! 3 bucks for sparkling wines and sangrias.  ~Get more bang for your buck and get the dessert for two! ( I couldn't get it due to livingsocial deal restrictions).",

We, a group of 15, asked for water several times and eventually received 6 glasses and 1 standard size carafe, no beuno. Many of the desserts were ill thought combinations of east-west fusion. They seemed more into bringing unique looking and sounding combinations to the table than delicious ones. If you want to push the envelope with flowerless chocolate cake -the cake needs to be extraordinary first. No one in my party could figure out what flavor of ice cream came with it... something like ginger lobster salmon bisque. When it melted and slid into the cake I had to stop eating it for fear of becoming nauseated.",

A sexy lounge with dim lighting and sultry music that serves sweets and drinks... sounds like a win win to me :)  I came on a gno since I was visiting friends in SF. We arrived at around 10pm on a Friday night, so we unfortunately missed happy hour. Wait was about fifteen minutes. Their happy hour deals on the drinks seem amazing btw and I definitely suggest you check it out if you live in the area.  For drinks I recommend sticking to the martinis or bubbly drinks. One of my friends got a creamsicle like drink and it was just way too sweet. Delicious for the first sip and then pure diabetes if you try to finish it. I enjoyed my Just Peachy martini and thought it had the perfect amount of alcohol and sweetness to counterbalance. It also looked so cute with a little peach ring candy as decoration.  Tiramisu - It was WAY too heavy for my taste. They put a thick layer of extremely rich chocolate on top of the tiramisu cake that just ruined it for me.  Drunken S'more - Pretty good but the caramel baileys sauce they put all over it is extremely sweet. Something to share between others so you don't get an extreme sugar high afterwards.  Peanut Butter Jelly Time was my favorite out of three!! Perfect amount of sweetness and it definitely reminds you of a favorite childhood snack. :)  Recommend to enjoy some desserts and drinks with friends as you catch up over gossip or some of their many board games! Definitely something fun to check out when you don't want to go to your average bar or club.",

You can re-live the past and bring back those childhood memories by playing the classic family games such as candy land, connect four, etc!

CALL YOUR DAD!! \u00a0CALL YOUR ENTIRE LINE OF RELATIVES!!!! this place is FLAMINNNN' ON FIREEEEEEEE!   Came here on a Saturday night with my Yelp friend, Ben T, and a couple of our other friends right as they're about to close! THANK YOU BEN T. for getting us in! This is by far the HOTTEST dessert joint/ bar I have ever been to and I am a complete fan girl of it now!   Best place to get some exotic desserts, with a side of a drink, AND enjoy some fun board games as well. I believe their menu changes every now and then, because I could not find the desserts I saw on yelp before, HOWEVER, the ones I got was enough to shut me up!  Rose Vanilla Panna Cotta: $10. 5stars. Panna cotta is an Italian dessert that mixes cream, milk, and sugar with gelatin. It came with three pieces of panna cotta, peaches soaked in red wine reduction, cookie crumbles, and a cracker. Everything meshed together like a perfect combination. This was definitely my favorite dish of the night! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/candybar-san-francisco?select=knFQh5eWi-gYpMXgi_d3Kg#eCmBF6ni8yc3RX30LyLH5A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cand\u2026</a> Strawberry Limeade: $9. 5 stars. A cute jar of strawberry mousse, vanilla cake, calamansi cream, and strawberries. It actually had a hint of acidity at the bottom of the jar and it was like the experience of drinking strawberry limeade except in solid form (easier for me to swallow whole *winkwink*)! It was WONDERFUL!. The strawberry mousse was very fluffy and everything was PERFECTLY sweet/sour. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/candybar-san-francisco?select=knFQh5eWi-gYpMXgi_d3Kg#k-HswtIJgaynNqsl-bPMmg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cand\u2026</a> Drunken S'mores: $10. 3.5 stars. My friend ordered this and I had a taste however, it wasnt my favorite. But it's probably because I'm not a fan or TOO much chocolate. It consisted of a tart like bottom layer with marshmallow and hot chocolate melted over it with a side of salted caramel.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/candybar-san-francisco?select=knFQh5eWi-gYpMXgi_d3Kg#323UgUlDT1wSL5eIeE9FQA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cand\u2026</a> Flourless Chocolate Banana Torte: $10. 3.5 stars. Again, I am not a fan of chocolate cakes, even if i LOVE chocolates, but this was pretty good! It was my first time having a flourless cake! It came with pineapple pieces, peanuts, chantilly, and vanilla bean ice cream. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/candybar-san-francisco?select=knFQh5eWi-gYpMXgi_d3Kg#iAOK09YLj49Bx7WRy-Jj4g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cand\u2026</a>  TIPS: -Give yourself at last 30 min to look for parking on weekends -it is about a 45min wait, EXPECT IT, dont complain.  -DONT come on the weekends! haha.. THERES A LINE OUT THE DOOR! \u00a0 -dont come in an hour before they're closing, you will probably not get in (LESSON LEARNED, thank you again Ben T for saving us!) -try whatever has an asterisk on there, its usually really good i think.. haha -BRING YO MULA,CREDIT CARDS, DEBIT CARDS TO SPEND ON THEM DESSERTS HERE!",

I told him I didn't know what was good since it was our first time. I asked him for recommendation, and he just said he'd give us a few more minutes to think and proceeded to walk away. Didn't take that too personally. But he didn't come back for a good 15 minutes. We ended up having to ask for him to return.  My friend and I both ordered an Apple A La Mode. I didn't like how strong the ginger taste was (really not a ginger fan) and the overall taste of the dessert, which is unfortunate since I'm usually a huge fan of Apple A La Mode desserts. We initially asked another worker, but she refused to help us and redirected us to our server. But, my friend kept hers.  We waited too long and I ended up asking him to just cancel the order. He still brought it out... I told him I didn't want it anymore and he took it away without saying a word to me. Two seconds later, he brought us the check.  An hour later.. now, my friend (who kept her dessert) ends up with food poisoning.",

Luckily, they had sangria, which was pretty good, but otherwise stay away from the \"cocktails\" unless you want to go into a sugar coma.  Their desserts are way overstated -- just enormous portions of sugar -- a lot like the cocktails, actually. (And this is a sugar-junkie talking so it must have been pretty bad.)   Dear Candybar, 1. Hire a pastry chef. 2. Make desserts smaller. 3. Balance desserts with a mint leaf or a pinch of salt (seriously). 4. Get a liquor license. 5. See # 1.",

It was fairly busy, but we were able to get a table. The service was so-so starting out. It got progressively better throughout the night. In fact, the owner was our waiter. Three of us split seven plates. I think three savory and four sweet. The highlight being the dark &amp; white chocolate figs. All in all, the food was executed fairly well and the flavor pairings were interesting, but nothing really blew me away. Not to mention the fact that the seven plates (actually five total, b/c two were comped...yes, knowing ppl in the restaurant business has it's perks) plus one cocktail = a pretty big bill.   My advice is to take a trip to candybar if you are in an adventurous mood for something sweet.",

We went with the drunken smores as recommended.  He then came by about 15 mins later and said they were actually out of it, so we decided on the passionfruit mousse. It was really sweet, and the passionfruit flavor was very strong. But good presentation and taste was good.  Overall good concept with drinks, dessert and games.

I guess they are hardly \"lounges.\" Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e CART anyone? I digress.   So for a dude that lives life on the savory side of things, a sweet shack has to be good and inventive to catch my attention. Results? Well, I ate the better part of the four desserts we ordered. The damage...   Poached Blood Orange and Lychee Fruit Salad - This dish was accented with a lychee granita and lavender ice cream. Very nice, robust flavors in the fruit finished with the smooth, silky lavender ice cream. The ice cream was so delicious I started eyeing my lavender soap when I got home.   900 Watt Almond Sponge Cake - Served with Greek yogurt, white chocolate, cherries, and cherry sorbet. The dish was @#$&amp;in' genius with the fluffy cake, tart Greek yogurt, and sweet chocolate and cherries. And little did you know that whimsical looking fluffy cake was nuked. Hence the \"900 Watt\" in the name.   Beet Marscapone Mousse - served wrapped in a chocolate canoli this creation was a bit on the veggie side, but you still couldn't help but to eat the whole thing.   That dessert with the Thyme Ice Cream - It was chocolate something. I totally forget. That's because I was so completely engrossed with the Thyme Ice Cream. Like the lavender ice cream, this thyme counterpart was creamy and delicate in texture, but still maintained the overtones of the herb.  Candybar is a definite must try. The inventive dishes captivate you as they combine ingenuity, molecular gastronomy (google it), and some old-fashioned cajones (ca-Hoe-knees). And a big plus if you go with a pastry student. I wouldn't have known about the 900 Watts knowledge is she wasn't there...",

My sister got the peach martini and the a jasmine sparkling drink. I definitely loved the jasmine drink.   The art work on the walls were really cool. The ambiance was really relaxed and sophisticated at the same time. The service was alright, not the best that I have had, not really that bad either. In my opinion I thought it was quite slow. The prices for the drinks and desserts were a bit high. I think they could have offered a bit more for the price they were asking.   Another negative about the bar was the fact that my sister and I were seated right near the front door. The door kept opening and it just happened to be the coldest night of the year in December and it was very unpleasant. We could have moved to another table, I guess but it would have been awkward because we would have been too close to other groups of people. I think that that was the thing that I did not enjoy about this place.   So overall, split the desserts because they are really sweet.  The drinks are great, try the Jasmine sparkling drink.  Sit in a booth away from the door to keep from getting cold.   I would love to go here again so that I can sit in a more comfortable spot.",

Also sampled the Tiramisu, Flourless Chocolate Cake, and the Apple a la mode.   Cute place, kinda small, but I would go back again if I wanted dessert, and especially if I had the coupon.

What a novel idea! Who doesn't love board games, desserts, and alcohol?   The ambiance is very chill here and I really like the chic decor.

Despite the loud noise and people standing everywhere, the staff was wonderful and friendly!! The gentlemen at the front, possibly the owner and the waitress at our table were very hospitable.   I had ordered the chocolate brioche and the vanilla cake. Both were delicious. If you love chocolate, I highly recommend the brioche. It's a soft chocolate cake served with caramel ice cream. The vanilla cake was paired with thin slices of mangoes.   The portion is enough to share for two... just enough for you wanting to come back for more. \u00a0This place is great for small groups, girls night out here is perfect, with your significant other or even a date! (*brownie points!)  It did take a while for us to receive our check but we passed time by playing one of their several board games stacked on the shelf - Connect 4!   Great desert, wine list &amp; a place to hang out to relax over life's greatest \u00a0treasures...sweets!

BUT...the Parking around the place on a Saturday night HELLA sucks. \u00a0  Really kills the mode of the night. \u00a0It's not Candybar's fault. \u00a0We started at 9:30pm, found parking a little shy of 10:00pm. \u00a0No. Joke.  Just letting folks know how it was. \u00a0Had to circle the Divis streets for 30 minutes just to find parking. \u00a0Literally every other venue around the area is competing with each other and the residents who live around the area too. \u00a0  Some might say it's \"The City\" and thats how it is...but I'm an SF native born and raised, and this part of the City has the worst parking at night. \u00a0  Good luck. \u00a0  You've been alerted about the conditions. \u00a0May parking karma be with you.  Now, if you can bare the difficulty in your long quest to find parking, and happy to win the parking lotto that night, Candybar is a nice, intimate spot that you can eat some sweets, drink some suds, and play some board games with your buds.   Very casual place. \u00a0the staff was very nice. \u00a0served us well. \u00a0  The game we played was similar to the one in Inglorious Basterds. \u00a0Candybar has a deck of cards with historical figures on them, in place of the regular kings, queens, jacks and numbers.  So, we picked out a few familiar faces, and names. \u00a0Charles Dickens, Alfred Nobel, Leonardo Di Vinci, Claude Monet, and even Chair Mao to name a few. \u00a0We faced the cards down, each picked one, and placed them on our foreheads, hidden from our own view. \u00a0And turn by turn (2 questions each, a round) we asked, if he was a scientist, or did he/she write a book? \u00a0and then you get the idea...  This was enjoyable. \u00a0And this joy took place at Candybar SF. \u00a0Hope you find the same, right after you find parking.",

I had high expectations for Candybar, and though I didn't fall head over heels in love, I definitely have a huge crush on this place. The presentation and the idea behind \u00a0the desserts is lust worthy. Taste wise, the desserts are a mixed bag. The strawberry limeade is delicious, I usually like chocolate-y desserts better, but this one is worth it! The Candybar hot chocolate was average - I would say skip it since you're probably already going to get some cocktails. Drinking hot chocolate and alcohol side by side is just weird. The ice cream sundae was good - the brownie was not as soft as I would have liked but the ice cream was really good! The Candybar lemon drop shot is YUMMY, you don't taste the alcohol at all it's just like a shot of deelicious lemonade! I loved the triple chocolate bellini all this chocolate-y goodness spiked with the perfect amount of sparkling wine is just pure lusciousness. \u00a0The mango tango bellini was the fruity version of the chocolate bellini, and it was very good as well! If the couch-y seats are available, I would highly recommend getting one of those especially if you come with a large group of people. They are very cozy and intimate and add to the overall experience. This place is great because it feels like a classier version of a stay in type of Friday night - you still have the comfort of great dessert, company, and board games but you get to look cute and enjoy the city!  Candybar gets four stars for the overall experience it offers and their yummy cocktails! Oh and the waiters are beautiful. Trust me.",

Not that I want to add myself to America's obesity crisis, but still.   I also really hate having to eat something when not seated at a real table. I felt all hunched over in our little booth, hoping I wouldn't drip on myself or the furniture.

    "review_text": "I was pretty excited to try this place and had really high expectations walking in here since I love dessert. \u00a0I found myself being somewhat disappointed. \u00a0  The decor was a little off for me when we walked in. \u00a0It has a lounge type of feel but the white walls and no music playing made it just feel off. \u00a0It overhead lamps with the light bouncing off the white walls made it too bright. \u00a0The music came on shorter after we got there. \u00a0I guess that made it better then. \u00a0  So we got the menu and it had a dessert tasting menu and then a la carte. \u00a0I love tasting menus - you get to try a little bit of everything. \u00a0On the back menu, they had a small savory section with spiced almonds, romaine salad, carrot soup, duck liver mousse, and cheese plate. \u00a0The selection seems a bit awkward. \u00a0This is definitely not a place for a meal and it's suppose to be a dessert/wine bar. \u00a0What the heck is the salad, carrot soup, and duck liver mousse doing on the menu? \u00a0I think they're trying too hard to put a little of this and that, and the menu seems discoordinated.  So between us 2 couples, we ordered 2 tasting menus, where it comes with a shot of lemonade, 2 desserts that you choose from a list of about 10 things, and then a cup of malted milk with a cookie. \u00a0We also ordered a side of spiced almonds, coffee, cappuccinos, and a glass of wine. \u00a0We also asked for water, which never came and we asked for it at the end when we were done with the drinks we ordered.  The almonds came first and they were good, just small portion. \u00a0Then came the coffee and cappuccinos. \u00a0The cappuccino was served in this big ole coffee cup and filled up 1/2 way. \u00a0I was expecting it to come in a small, cappuccino cup with the coffee/foam filled to the top. \u00a0 Wrong choice of cup and the cappuccino was lukewarm. \u00a0  Then the lemonade arrived shortly. \u00a0It tasted more like sugar water with a hint of lemon. \u00a0I think they should have brought the lemonade first as a starter and then bring the coffee with the dessert. \u00a0I did like that they brought the first course dessert first rather than having 2 desserts come at once side by side.   The chevre cheesecake had good texture, silky smooth. \u00a0I liked it til I tasted the goat/sheep milk in the cheese. \u00a0I didn't like the cheese selection they used to make the cheesecake. \u00a0  We also had the carrot cake baked Alaska, which had carrot cake, some ice cream, and then a layer of torced cream. \u00a0This was pretty good, probably my favorite of the night. \u00a0  Then we had the warm vanilla cake with pickled mango. \u00a0The cake was good but the mango did not go well with it at all. \u00a0The combination was just off. \u00a0  We also had the chocolate brioche with balsamic caramel ice cream. \u00a0I didn't taste balsamic at all and the brioche looked more like a brownie wedge and the texture was like it too. \u00a0Brioche is suppose to be airy, not dense. \u00a0So while this dish was decent, it threw me off guard. \u00a0It didn't meet the expectations of what I envisioned.  Last but not least, the malted milk was too sweet and the peanut butter cookie had this funky Indian spice added to it. \u00a0The flavor did not go well, although I give them kudos for trying new ideas.  Now to the service - not very good. \u00a0As mentioned earlier, we didn't get our water til we asked at the end of dessert when we asked for it upfront. \u00a0The servers did not pay attention to our table to clear the plates when we were done after each course. \u00a0They took the plates as they brought the next dish, so we had to help them pick up the finished plates while they tried to put down the next dishes. \u00a0Lastly, the servers didn't dress \"professionally\". \u00a0The guy behind the bar was in some Addidas top and another guy was in some worn out jeans and rolled up his sleeves. \u00a0I think they're the owners, which makes me think, rather than dressing how you would on a regular day, you should dress better to set a good example for your staff to follow.  So all in all, I give them 3 stars for the idea/concept of a dessert/wine bar and 2 stars off for lack of service and weird decor.  I really did want to like this place. \u00a0Sorry...",

Sweet desserts and sparkling cocktails, low lighting and local art work lines the walls, and in case your date needs some help with conversation they have stacks of boardgames to spur the conversation. Well it sounds like a good idea, but there a couple things that could be better. 1. Drinks: all of thier chanpagne cocktails are SUPER sweet 2. Desserts are over loaded with flavor combinations (apples, gingerbread ice cream, dates/nut compote...) 3. Servers made us feel rushed even before we ordered our drinks. 4. Close the back door! The draft was freezing and the shady van that pulled up. I hope they were a restaurant supplier.   So all in all, not somewhere I'm dying to go back to but it maybe some other girls' vibe so guys I wouldn't write it off.

I got there at 9:15 on a Wednesday evening and there was a line. The host said it was not worth getting on the wait list as they close at 10 pm and there were quite a few people waiting already. I decided to hang out and wait for my date anyway, and I ended up getting a table by the time he arrived. Persistence pays! ;-)  We started with the drinks and while my date ordered the Raspberry Delight (sparkling wine and raspberry syrup), I chose the red sangria. I loved my sangria, but he was not a big fan of his cocktail, although he did agree that he had chosen something too sweet anyway.  Then the whole picking a dessert dilemma! There were so many options and they all seemed - and looked - so good! We chose to share the Japanese Cheesecake (graham cracker streusel, honeydew, champagne granita, guava sorbet) since we both love cheesecake. What a big $10 disappointment! The cake had a 'sponge texture' and was tasteless. The guava sorbet was good, but didn't necessarily complement the cheesecake. I was so confused and disappointed as the place is all about desserts! Was it only the cheesecake??? But now after reading some or the reviews I realized other fellow yelpers had the same experience with other options. That's really too bad.  I would come back to candybar for a drink and to enjoy the romantic ambiance. As to the desserts, I will pass...:-(",

They have a some girly looking drinks with not much alcohol in them and the customary beer selection.   The atmosphere: The bonus is that this is a rather relaxed place. The atmosphere allows you to chill-out and play board games or just talk with friends. The atmosphere is nice, but it still seems a little stuffy. I prefer places where it is less formal and this place is more just confusing.   For a better experience go to Fritz in Hayes Valley where your table is not beside the kitchen.   Definitely check the place out at least once. It is a great place to take a date after a movie or a show or just chill out with friends and feel a little classy too.",

This place makes me super cheerful and happy thinking about it! It is such a cute cute cute place for you and your significant other to go on a romantic date after dinner! :)   You could even come here with a group of girls (although the place is sort of small and can get squishy). \u00a0Being here made me feel like it was Valentine's Day and there were tons of couples surrounding me.   The wait wasn't too bad...but it does get pretty bad, me and the boy just got lucky. My deal gave us 2 cocktails and 2 desserts. I got the Lychee Martini and Honey-Almond Panna Cotta. Loved the Panna Cotta it was like a gelatin consistency. The boy got some sort of a sweet soda and the Soft Cheesecake. The cheesecake was too cheesy for me.   The only negative thing about this place is that it gets TOO SWEET! I mean I have the biggest sweet tooth but by the end of the night I was good. Getting a sweet fruity drink doesn't help you eat the dessert. If anything it adds too much sugar to your mouth. I couldn't even finish my desserts and I always eat it all!   Eating dessert can be really quick so it is cool Candybar provides board games! Although, all the good ones get taken really fast. I do want to come back here again since I like it soo much! It makes me really really happy.",

We had the \"nachos\" made with cinnamin dusted \"chips\" (I'll stop using pretentious quotations now) topped with papaya, mango, kiwi, avocado yogurt (which should have been weird but it was amazing) and a candied jalapeno, which was so good, I wanted to have babies with it.  We also had the Peanut Butter Curry Sponge Cake, which was an interesting palate experience; good, but I don't know if I would order it again, and my friend had another dessert, I believe the bitter chocolate ganache, that I didn't even get to try because it was gone so fast.  Service was good, seats were comfy, and we even chatted with our neighbors on the couch. \u00a0The espresso they used was also delicious; I had a decaf Americano that tasted amazing. \u00a0 Every penny I spent here was well worth it, AND they take American Express.

The place is dimly lit and the tables are mostly two or four seats here. There's a bar counter inside and some really interesting paintings and prints hung on the wall. Parking in this area is really horrible. I would suggest taking the bus here or a taxi.  == Food ==  There's only desserts, light snacks, and alcohol here.   The desserts are really simple. Things like ice cream, cheese and crackers, and cake. It doesn't taste like they make their desserts at the place.  The alcohol is really light cocktails. Some cocktails taste really good while others taste kind of awful. It's really a hit or miss here for the cocktails. Some are really fruity so my advise would be to order a fruit you like. All the cocktails are sweet to really sweet so be prepared.  == Service ==  Service is good. The waitress was really helpful and she came around refilling water quite often and once in a while to ask how things are going. Pretty pleasant atmosphere she gave off.  == Overall ==  Pretty nice place to bring a date to and hang out for a while. Prices are above average, but it's a nice lounge sit and relax. It's not place to sit down and eat a meal. This place is more of an after dinner dessert place.",

I know its a Tuesday, but as a bar and a place that serves after dinner things, don't you think 10 is a bit early?  They redeemed themselves by being very kind and still letting us come in to have a drink and coffee.   Suggestions? Stay open later! Also, maybe have a few more port / sherry choices on the menu?

Now that I've used up all 4, I don't think I'll be back.   The food: To die for. My favorite is the red velvet cake. The idea of covering red velvet cake in coconut seemed a little odd, but it actually worked really well. And it comes with the most delicious ice cream I've ever had. It's mint ice cream, but not your typical mint chocolate chip- type mint, more like fresh-picked-from-your-herb-garden mint. Though one time out of the three that I ordered this, it just tasted like vanilla ice cream with a hint of something minty.  The drinks: Hit or miss. Most of the sparkling wine-based drinks are great: subtle and light. I like the Strawberry Kiss and Rasberry Delight (most of the drinks come with stripper names). My friend ordered something blueberry-y though, and it was sickly syrupy sweet with a disgusting neon blue sugar rim. There's nothing on the menu to indicate which drinks taste like straight slurpy syrup and which are lighter.  The service: Absolutely horrible. The first 3 times I was in here, I had the same cold waiter. The fourth time I was so happy to be in someone else's section until he turned out to be worse. Candybar seems to only hire hipster guys who think themselves too cool to be waiters. They treat you like you're totally putting them out even by being there. Also, I REALLY hate it when I have to ask more than twice to get water. And each time I was in here I had to ask at least three different people before I got a glass.  All in all, great food and good drinks, but the service is bad enough to keep me away.",

I decided to take my girlfriend to Candybar for our anniversary and we were both impressed. It was a bonus that we arrived shortly after dinner for happy hour too with the Giants game playing! (Go Giants!)  The atmosphere and decor seemed very fitting as the whole establishment carried a nice ambience.   Anyway, I got a beer and a red sangria while my girlfriend got the Strawberry Kiss (Sparking Wine, Ginger Ale, and a Frozen Strawberry). We also got the Candybar Dessert for Two sampler, which where we chose the Apple A La Mode, Strawberry Limeade, Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo and Big Francesco's Tiramisu.   I just have to put it out there that the drinks were excellent and they had a decent selection of beers. Oh, and Happy Hour helps too :P But we found that we liked the desserts a lot! Personally, I was not too attracted to the Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo but that is because I normally do not get them too often so I cannot comment on it. However, I liked the Tiramisu because it had a nice consistency and flavor. My girlfriend found the Strawberry Limeade to be her favorite because she enjoyed the fruity flavor and it was not too sweet.   Did I mention that they have board games too? We enjoyed playing the various games while we drank the night away.   By the way, bonus points for having a Willy Wonka quote in the bathroom. I thought it was a nice touch.  The one thing that bothered us throughout the night was the amount of little bugs that came in through the open door. This is why I cannot give it more than a four star.

One might argue, however, that strict interpretation would get us to agree that, yes, with the expansive list of cocktails, wines, other alcoholic libation and sweet treats, Candybar is in fact the SF's first dessert lounge, if not the most popular.   We got there at 6PM, right when it opened, after a decision to have a pre-dinner dessert (for those who are dubious, I highly recommend it as a way to build appetite for savory food afterwards). \u00a0So we got to sit at the table of our choosing and had the full attention of the man who seems to be the proprietor. \u00a0  We also got to see the place fill up as we were having our desserts: a lone man sitting at the bar, a group of people assuming the corner couches and another group quickly scanning through the selection of board games and settling for Apples to Apples. \u00a0  The desserts were A M A Z I N G - the three of us had apple (not pie) a la mode with gingerbread ice-cream, PBJ with blueberry and candied nuts and uber-light Japanese cheesecake with honeydew, graham cracker and guava sorbet. \u00a0We washed it down with mango / tangerine bellini and a glass of 2009 Loredona riesling before heading out to our next stop - Sons and Daughters.",

I'm at the restaurant to have a good time w/ my friends, not to ogle over you putting a glass of wine on my table forcing me to stop my conversation and focus on you, the server.  Wine selection is good, but staff could use more education. Wine is REALLY over-priced. I work in the wine industry. People: this place is bending you all over! But hey, if you like that sort of thing, more power to you.  Decor is below average, it looks nice but nothing original. Also, the seating was REALLY uncomfortable. Not a place where you can kick back with a glass of (over-priced) wine and chill with a friend. It made me miss Hayes &amp; Vine.  I didn't have anything to eat so can't comment on the desserts. They looked interesting.  While I'd probably return for another try, that's mostly because it's really convenient for me.

This place is a little gem, especially for a relaxing night out with the girls. I actually came here with a group of 7 so it took a little while for them to accommodate our big group. It was manageable, but this place is ideal for groups under 5.   Lavender honey creme fraiche semifreddo: \u00a0it is semi frozen rich cream with a velvety texture. You know when you eat lavender flavor anything, it tastes like soap or potpourri? Well, THIS dessert was not like that at all!!!! The flavors were not overpowering at all and this one was the best out of the bunch if you want something light and refreshing.   Strawberry Limeade: strawberry mousse, vanilla cake, calamansi cream, strawberries. Calamansi cream is the lime flavor part of this dessert and this was our 2nd favorite of the bunch. Again, very light and refreshing!  Soft Cheesecake: shortbread, pecans, sweet pink grapefruit leche, Rice Krispy crunch, passion fruit sorbet. The cream cheese in this cheesecake was VERY pronounced so if you like cheesecake, this one is the way to go!  Big Francesco's Tiramisu: what I really liked about this one is that it has a sweet and a hint of salt on the bottom of the cake. However, I do prefer a tiramisu with more kahlua/coffee flavor so this dessert was A OK for me.   And the cocktails!  Get the 50/50 if you like orange creamsicle  Sangria was the right balance of wine and fruits. I would definitely order this during their happy hour!  There is a bar that seats about 5-8 people and there are plenty of boardgames; but we didn't even played any of them because our group had such a great time enjoying the atmosphere!  NOTE: Parking was difficult like every other place in SF, so be prepared to spend at least 15 minutes circling around the block, up and down some hills, and in between dead end neighborhoods.",

    "review_text": "Came here with a Groupon for four dessert and four drinks. For dessert, we ordered the banana torte (gluten free), s'mores, ice cream sandwich, and ice cream sunday. Out of the four, the ice cream sunday was the best. Maybe because I just really like mint chocolate chip ice cream, torched bananas, and brownies. The s'mores dessert wasn't really like s'mores because it was missing the graham cracker portion; still pretty good though. \u00a0The ice cream sandwich was pretty simple, and possibly the most healthy. It was just honeydew ice cream sandwiched between two macarons with some cut up honeydew fruit. The desserts weren't as fancy as I remembered for some reason. I thought there were some fancier choices a few years ago.   For drinks, we got the mint ginger beer, lychee guava martini, and the kir royale. The first two were really good -- the martini even came with a lychee inside. The kir royale was a bit too sweet though, almost like a sparkling wine cooler.   It's pretty cool they have all sorts of board games like Candy Land (how appropriate), but most people I saw were playing connect four -- I guess that's a pretty simple game that only requires two.   Overall, it was pretty good, but I thought their desserts could've been a bit more creative and visually appealing. There should be a dessert better than an ice cream sundae...",

This place is cool for hanging out (great atmosphere, cool food), but it feels like it's popularity stems from a lack of competition rather than it's ability to prepare good food/ drinks.  My main issue with this place that the desserts here just aren't that good! For the price it charges (think high end restaurant dessert prices), I would expected better. \u00a0I've been here twice and tried a variety of desserts, including the s'mores dish and the peanut butter jelly time, and I was impressed with none of them. \u00a0They are decent desserts, but between the price and the hype, I expected much much more.  On to the drinks, I know they are meant to be dessert drinks, but they are way too sweet! They try to make their drinks original by using distinctive ingredients, think jasmine tea, aloe vera, etc., but the final product is nonetheless disappointing. \u00a0I've tried around 6 of their drinks there and I didn't particularly like any of them.  In the end, I would say you should at least come here once, just to see what it is all about, but unless friends plan an event here, nothing they serve here would motivate me to come back.  Note also: parking is impossible around here, and there is an invariable wait",

I went here last night with some girlfriends for my birthday. \u00a0First of all, parking is HORRENDOUS! \u00a0I was pretty patient about parking, because we all know parking is scarce in the city, but wow...parking is no joke in the NOPA area. \u00a0Anywhoo, after feeling like we won the lotto (for finding parking) we stroll into this new dessert bar which we have been excited about trying for the past 3 weeks. \u00a0  Ambiance: \u00a0It is pretty minimal, yet very classy looking. \u00a0We sat towards the back, but you could tell in the front (where it was a bit more lounge-like) was the place to be. \u00a0It is pretty small, so wherever you are, you could pretty \u00a0much see everything.   I went ahead and ordered the 4-course tasting menu. \u00a0I started out with the Sparkling Meyer Lemonaide with Mint Gele, which was tasty. \u00a0I really enjoyed it, it was lemonade with a kick of mint, but as you drink it, the gelee gives you a little surprise. \u00a0My only quirk is that it is the size of a shot. \u00a0Actually if i went to any other bar in SF and ordered a kamikaze, the kamikaze shot would be bigger than this fancy lemonade palate cleanser. \u00a0 \u00a0  I then received my Carrot Cake Baked Alaska \u00a0w/candied fennel &amp; walnuts. \u00a0I also had the Accornero Brigantino wine pairing. \u00a0This was YUMMY. \u00a0It was a thin layer of carrot cake with ice cream covered in a meringue which was flamed to perfection. \u00a0Didn't really pay no mind to the accompanied fennel and walnuts. \u00a0  Up next was the Bittersweet Chocolate Sorbet \u00a0w/foie gras tapioca &amp; croutons accompanied with the wine pairing of Fontodi Vin Santo. \u00a0Okay, i know I'm a vegetarian, but i HAD to try this foie gras concoction. \u00a0All it was was chocolate sorbet on top of some grounded Oreo cookie crumbles with a smear of tapioca on the side. \u00a0I tasted the tapioca and i thought it was completely and utterly gross. \u00a0So this dish was pretty much chocolate sorbet with some crumbs of Oreo cookie.   The finale to our 4-course tasting was Warm Malted Milk w/Peanut Butter Vadouvan Cookie. \u00a0The milk was the BEST THING I HAD. \u00a0Although I can't even describe where they find the tiniest cups to serve this in. \u00a0This wasn't even a \"shot\". \u00a0The cookie was not a favorite, it had a curry aftertaste (yup, CURRY). \u00a0  I had a LOT of expectations for this place and I know a lot of people on here said it was too pricey. \u00a0But I went in thinking, $14 for the tasting menu is not pricey. \u00a0Well -- pains me to say this -- but i don't even think the $14 was worth it. \u00a0So yes, I agree with everyone else ..... this place is totally over priced. \u00a0The wine pairings are in the smallest glasses you could ever imagine and the \"experience\" was okay. \u00a0I had expected to leave this place full of guilt and sin due to the consumption of dessert, but I really left thinking.....it was nice, I'm glad we went, but I don't think I would go back. \u00a0   And....fyi....I can't really imagine this place to be an after-work happy hour spot.  UPDATE: \u00a0Another thing, one of my girlfriend's were pregnant, and when asked if they had any non-alcoholic beverages...the answer was NO. \u00a0No effort to accommodate with soda, coffee, or anything.",

The tiramisu was boring to me... even the tiramisu at Whole Foods taste better to me, in my opinion.

Onto the food: we ordered two drinks and two desserts.   For drinks, strawberry kiss and jasmine sparkle. The drinks were super tasty! I really liked the Jasmine because it was just the perfect amount of sweetness. The lemon really gave it a nice balance as well.  For desserts we got the ice cream sandwich and almond panna cotta. The ice cream sandwich was SO GOOD. I've only had macaron ice cream sandwiches from Milk in LA which is premade and stored in the freezer. This one is more deconstructed and made on the spot. It would totally go back again for this one. The macaron cookie had great texture. The panna cotta was also really good (not as good as the ice cream sammy though). If you are a fan of almond pudding/jello, you will like this. It's very light and smooth. I enjoyed the berries and the chocolate ice cream it came with.

The place is small but still a little space-ish unless it gets packed and then it's people on top of people..how you doing?! Not on top but relatively close. Still a nice after dinner date/small group of friends spot to hit up.  We had the Soft Cheesecake and Ice Cream Sundae &amp; I had the 50/50. Tried both desserts and they were really yummy. Let me also say the 50/50 is so up my alley but I'm a fan of orange soda pop SO I loved that drink down to the last drop..literally.    If you're looking for the traditional versions of their desserts, you maybe in for a let down. They put a unique spin on them and they are definitely using another technique but it works for me.

My date and I had the dessert for two combo which allows you to pick four desserts. We had the Peanut Butter Jelly Time!, Strawberry Limeade, Flourless Chocolate Cake, and a couple Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwiches. I gotta say I enjoyed all the desserts except for the Peanut Butter one, not really a big fan of PB. It was my first time having any form of Macaroon and it was awesome.  Didn't get a chance to play any of the boardgames because we were in a hurry to get somewhere else right after, but this is a great spot to come after dinner to enjoy some dessert and relax with good company.",

I just had dinner with my boyfriend in the area and decided to try it out. We went just in time for their happy hour. Drinks were cheaper, but still kinda pricey. I ordered the strawberry kiss and he got the passion fruit. Both were fruity and sparkly.   We ordered the drunken smores and IT WAS YUMMMYYYY. We were too caught up in our battleship war that we forgot about it on our table. I got the idea that if the drunken smores was good, maybe their other desserts were just as good, too! After all, it's a dessert place. I was in a happy wild mood and took the risk of ordering something I've never heard or had before, Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semifreddo. Boy did it sound complicated ...  Boy did it also look complicated ... so many ingredients. I take the first bite and so many flavors. I don't know what to say. It's definitely different. Eh, not to my taste. I'm sticking to my chocolate range.   4 stars because of (1) the amazing drunken delicious smores (2) amazing strawberry kiss (3) battleship",

The prices are pretty outrageous for the amount of desserts/drinks you get. The presentation is pretty, but that means, more plate, less dessert. I went here with my boyfriend ready to try many different things, so we got 3 desserts to split and a couple cocktails.  All portions of the desserts were small, so we were able to eat all without getting too full. Also, the desserts weren't anything special, you could go somewhere else and get the same dessert that tastes the same way. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but you could probably get it cheaper elsewhere. The cocktails were probably the taster part of the night, I've never had cocktails like they serve anywhere else. The flavors are very sweet, which I like. They are pricey and probably not very strong, but good to try at least once.  The atmosphere was intimate, but tables are very close together. They have boardgames you could play while you eat, but with limited table space, that can be kind of hard or uncomfortable.  Overall, yes this was a cool place to go and they have tastey options for desserts and drinks. However, they are pricey for their nothing special small portions and it's kind of awkward when your sitting so close to the people next to you. If you love desserts (like me :]), I say go ahead and try it!",

I would have given 3 stars, especially given the very nice ambiance, but the service was also mediocre and very slow. Some of our party was served significantly before the rest.

There are also old school board games, none of which are really from my time, but I don't expect this to be a kiddie place anyways.  I ordered a chocolate mousse with mango sauce dripped onto it and I'm not impressed. It sounded so much more amazing than it tasted! However, it looked ultra amazing, the plate with its sauce dripped into orbital patterns matched the caf\u00e9/lounge greatly. I am ultra impressed with the presentation of the dish, not so much with the taste of the food. My friend ordered a butterscotch brownie thing (for a lack of better terms) and that tasted exactly the way it should (though I do not like butterscotch), soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Both dishes were ultra pretty and Milky Wayed off with some sorta deluxe ice cream. Mm. Delishee.  The food raked in a rather mediocre 2 paired off with a cappuccino for 0.5 stars, presentation took in a 0.75 of a star and the atmosphere another 0.75 star.

We went for the 4 desserts for $25 option - definitely the best deal and enjoyed:  Buttermilk Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta - perfection. Not too sweet and the balsamic strawberry reduction was a perfect complement.  Peanut Butter Jelly Time - the tart crust was on the dry side but the pb cream was so delicious it didn't matter. Lemon Tart - the coconut snow paired with the lemon curd was super tasty. The tart crust and coconut macaroon could've been better but was not necessarily bad.  Apple a la mode - the gingerbread ice cream was my favorite part, the rest was on the dry side.   Also ordered some sparkling wine with a touch of raspberry syrup which paired well with everything - total bill $35.

We each had a glass of port and an espresso, and shared one dessert \u00a0- it was $40 bucks. The dessert, a chocolate cannelone with ice cream, was good - but it was TEENY TINY (we should have ordered two... but then it would have been $50!) \u00a0The chocolate shavings were lacking - no flavor with the consistency of saran wrap. \u00a0For what we paid, every bit on the plate (which only amounted to about three bites) should have melted in our mouth and lingered for hours.   One nice touch was that the chef came out and gave us two truffles - he said one was lemon and the other saffron... but they tasted the same. \u00a0Maybe the saran wrap shavings warped our taste buds.  Yes, I would go back, though probably only for a more special occasion considering the price... and only if I was already in the area. \u00a0The location makes it more of a neighborhood spot than a destination, so I guess time will tell if they make it.",

    "review_text": "So, before I get to the wine debacle, let me first comment on the food.  After filling ourselves up with pizza at Little Star, we headed over to Candy Bar for some dessert. \u00a0Our first surprise was how empty it was - the last couple of times we'd tried to eat here, the wait had been in excess of an hour and we'd given up. \u00a0This time, we walked straight in and were seated immediately, pushing a few tables together to accomodate our group of 6.  We ordered a range of desserts to share - vanilla brioche with figs and white coffee ice cream, a chocolate pave with milk foam, sesame candybars with preserved kumquats and sesame ice cream and something else with hibiscus sorbet.  None of the desserts really seemed to gel together, they had some interesting elements but didn't quite coagulate as a whole. \u00a0For example, the vanilla brioche was tasty, the coffee ice cream was tasty and the figs were tasty. \u00a0But none of them really went with the other. \u00a0They were much better eaten as individual items than as a combined dessert.  Based on our eating experience alone, I don't think we'd be rushing back  However, then there was the \"wine debacle\"...  When we ordered our desserts, we also ordered a bottle of wine. \u00a0 A short wine later, the waiter arrived at our table with an open bottle of wine (with the cork jammed in the top) and a large glass of wine. \u00a0\"OK\" he said \"who wants to taste the wine?\" \u00a0Then he proceeded to disclose to us was that the reason the wine was open was because the barman had mis-heard the order for the bottle and had instead just poured a glass from a new bottle. \u00a0But since they didn't have any other bottle of that particular wine, they brought it anyway - the opened bottle and the glass that had supposedly been poured from it.  It was immediately clear that this was not true. \u00a0The opened bottle had barely a splash missing from it - just enough for the wine to be below the neck, but certainly not enough to fill the large glass that the waiter was passing off. \u00a0The wine bottle also had numerous large drips of wine that had run down the side of it - most odd.  Also, when we tasted the wine, there was a distinct difference between the wine in the bottle and the wine in the glass. \u00a0All at our table tasted it, and we all agreed it was a very different wine.  The next time he passed, we called the waiter over and asked him to level with us. \u00a0We told him what we'd noticed about the level in the wine bottle and that there was no way the full glass came from that bottle. \u00a0Additionally, we pointed out the flavor difference.  He maintained the story, even after we poured him a little of each type for his own taste. \u00a0However, he went to talk to \"that pesky bartender\" to investigate.  A gent that appeared to be the owner or manager had observed the goings on and came over to investigate for himself. \u00a0We explained again and he too went off to investigate.  Well, the waiter returned, this time with a different story. \u00a0Now we were told that the single glass of wine was actually the last of a previous bottle with a splash from the almost full bottle. \u00a0While this explained the missing splash from the top of our bottle, it didn't explain the difference in taste between the glass of wine and the rest of the bottle.  In the end, they comped us the wine plus sent us out an extra dessert.  However, we were left wondering exactly what went on with our wine. \u00a0Theories abounded - from believing the waiters second story to wondering if the abundance of drips around the bottle indicated that the bartender had poured two open bottles into one. \u00a0In any case, we were miffed that we had been lied to in the first case and generally left with a bad taste in our mouth that didn't just come from the wine.  So, my tip for you in all cases is that if you order a bottle of wine, make sure it is opened in front of you.",

The walls are adorned with San Francisco themed art. \u00a0There are seats at the bar or couch-y benches with tables. The menu isn't too big, but it's hard to choose because everything sounds so good! \u00a0  My good friend and I ordered the dessert for two. \u00a0It comes with four of their desserts to share. We ordered the Apple a l\u00e0 mode, San Francisco tiramisu, Strawberry lemonade, and the Japanese cheesecake. I also got the mango tango Bellini. Lemme tell you...this Bellini is so yummy, I almost drank it all in a minute. It was bubbly,mango-y, and so refreshing.  The San Francisco tiramisu was your regular tiramisu. I thought the Japanese cheesecake would be more moist like the ones you find in Asian supermarkets, but it was more dense and didn't have a lot of cheese flavor. There were tons of apples in the a l\u00e0 mode and the gingerbread ice cream had great gingery cinnamon flavor. My favorite was the strawberry lemonade. It was like strawberries on top of a lemon mousse.   They also had board games, but it seemed too busy of a night (Friday) to hog up a table and play games. I recommend getting the dessert for two if you're not going alone. The individual desserts are pricey and small. When it gets busy, it also gets loud. Enjoy your dessert!",

The first question asked of us as we walked in was ... \"are you here for the kung fu tacos?\". Our reaction ... what the hey-yell? =) Anyway, there were a lot of people in the front which made me think there were no seats but the waiter got us some menus and walked to the back of Candy Bar and sat us down.   We took a look at the menu and kinda turned our head when we saw a Nacho Sundae on the menu though somewhat intrigued by how that can be a dessert. The host kindly described what made it all up and we went ahead and ordered that along with the Chocolate Cremeux Cake, Chocolate Fudgescile and White Chocolate Mousse.   Verdict?? It was all yumminess. I must say I am impressed on the nachos. The guac was made from avocado yogurt, cheese strips were mango among other things.. very creative and delicious indeed. It had a blend of flavors that worked incredibly well. I felt like i was having dessert and my mind wasn't thinking nacho after I bit into it.   The other big winner I thought was the Chocolate Cremeux Cake ... it was a rich chocolate cake with an excellent raspberry sauce and cherry ice cream.   I haven't been to a dessert only bar in SF though and this one is a winner.   In additon, the ambiance was dark and loungy but very very relaxed. People were talking and enjoying their kung fu tacos on the front side and the back side is a bit more secluded despite the place not being big... and they had games like Candyland!!!   We washed down the desserts with some gourmet teas ... slightly on the expensive side but they came loose leaf with some filters that kept my tea grain free.   Good going Candy Bar.",

My roommate and I came in for happy hour last Friday and had the strawberry cheesecake, peanut butter cup, and a few cocktails. The desserts aren't discounted, but they are totally worth the price. They are delicious and creative and even though they look small, they pack a punch. The cocktails....well let's say that 2 sparkling wine cocktails were just right for these girls to turn a quiet evening into a NOPA bar adventure.  But back to the point.

It is evidently THE happening dessert spot on a Saturday night, it seemed! In an otherwise quiet neighborhood, we knew we had arrived when the sound of trendy music came pouring out the door of this tiny venue!  The dessert menu was delectable as usual. Since there were only two of us and we were already super full from dinner, we chose to split one dessert (which ended up being HUGE!). We ordered the tiramisu. It was fairly good, not the best I've had...but I couldn't hate it either. The top layer of chocolate was a super thin hardened layer, which made cutting into the tiramisu slightly inconvenient as it was toppling the entire cake. I still prefer the powdered cocoa that a tiramisu should traditionally be layered with.  Anyway, a great spot to grab dessert, chill, and play board games (they have a bunch on some shelves that you can play) with friends. Apparently it does get packed on weekends now though, so highly recommend a pre-9pm arrival or you'll be left waiting for a seat in the lounge area (we happened to grab the last seat when we arrived around 9:30pm).  Parking is tough in this area. Cab it, if you can.",

I finally made it out to Candybar after all these years and I can only see this place as \"worth it\" if you get a Groupon or go during happy hour. Otherwise, just pass on it.  We had the $36 Groupon deal for 4 deserts and 4 specialty drinks for the 4 of us. We just presented the deal and paid for tax and tip at the end; it worked out smoothly.   BIG FRANCESCO'S TIRAMISU \"Big\" really meant big! For $10, this was the most bang for your buck. It wasn't the most amazing cake ever but it was enjoyable, especially since it was the size of the old-school Gameboy!   LYCHEE GUAVA MARTINI Tasted deliciously sweet in the first few sips then the soju starts to kick in. Still subtle but making its presence known. The lychee at the bottom made for a nice reward at the end. \u00a0  One of my friends got the Apple A La Mode and she was able to switch out the gingerbread ice cream for coffee without trouble. Her Peach Martini came with a Trolli's Peach-o too! Pretty awesome.   Another friend of mine wanted a mocktail and they only had 2 options for that - Strawberry Kiss and the Lychee Guava Martini. A bit limited but okay.  Our bill came out to be $75+! Thank goodness for our Groupon deal! I'm so glad I listened to my friends' advice about going only with a Groupon.

I didn't want to be \"that guy\" and the people next to us looked pretty clean so I ate it anyway. And the cake was super dry. And I was painfully sober.",

I came with a group of friends and I thought the desserts and experience were just ok.  We came early on a Sunday night so luckily there was no wait and sat a table near the cashier/bar. My friend ordered some kind of fruity wine drink and we got her a strawberry pudding for her birthday. My other friends and I shared the banana split. The desserts were decent but overpriced.   I was kinda upset that the dessert sampler did not apply to groups of 3 or more or had some weird restriction. Also the service was really slow. I was not really charmed by the place but I can see lots of women thinking its really cute.",

A really cool spot to lounge at night, get a couple drinks, eat some killer desserts, and absolutely CRUSH some friends at a \"friendly\" game of Sorry!   Every time I come here I'm never disappointed, the desserts have been stellar each time ranging from Peanut Butter Jelly Time to the Passion Fruit Mousse. The drinks are awesome too, definitely more of the lounge type drinks than the hardcore cocktails, but coming to a spot like this I couldn't imagine why you'd wanna get hammered. Toss in the board games all around and it's a really cool spot to hit up if you have some friends in town and wanna do something different, or if you're over the normal bars and clubs and just wanna kick it.  Bonus points for the dope artwork along the walls too, my friends have caught me eyeballing them in my feeble attempts to come up with ways to toss them in my car unnoticed.",

    "review_text": "In theory, Candybar is every girl's dream come true. Desserts, cocktails, pink decor, music, and even wholesome board games!   You can make reservations, so I recommend doing that if you are planning on coming with a group. It gets kind of crowded on Fridays and I am guessing Saturdays as well. They wouldn't seat us until our whole party was there, and were really quick to seat us as soon as our group was complete, so that was nice.   I felt like our drinks could have been mixed a little better. I got the Jasmine Sparkle because I love jasmine and I'd never had a drink with it before. Unfortunately the majority of my drink just tasted like sparkling wine while the last 20% was pure jasmine aroma. It had potential but failed to impress. R got the Kir Royale (sparkling wine and creme de cassis) which was scarlet colored and a bit sweeter and more satisfying than the JS.   For dessert we got the Apple a la Mode (hazelnut crust, cream cheese filling, caramel, gingerbread ice cream and apples of course!) Again, better sounding than in taste. It was very sweet though I did enjoy the warm apples and the ice cream together. The cream cheese filling was weird and by the time I was eating it I had forgotten what it was so I kind of neglected it because it seemed pointless. I wish we got a chocolate dessert instead. The tiramisu is apparently pretty bomb!   I would say that although the menu at Candybar leaves something to be desired, the environment is unique and an enjoyable place to be if you are looking for a trendy place to hang out while indulging in childhood sins of sweets and board-games.  FYI, parking is a bitch.",

There was a line out the door and it sure looked cold outside, but from where I was sitting laughing and clinking my sparkling wine cocktail with my gal all I could think was \"Let them eat cake\" (or, better said, peanut butter jelly time) and I'm sure they did. \u00a0Eventually.",

    "review_text": "The concept of Candybar is a very unique one! Take everything that girls love and put it into one very classy place. Here you can get your girly mixed drinks (or a nice glass of champagne) and an assortment of tasty desserts. Did I mention the assortment of games to choose from? It's a nice place to take your girls especially in my case where we took one of my best friends here.   The wait to be seated was very long but you can still order drinks if you are able to wait inside. We waited about 40 minutes which was a bit frustrating. It is also very cramped so often 3-4 people are squeezed where only 2 people are supposed to go. The overall vibe of this place is very hip, lighting is very romantic however, in my opinion (though others might disagree) might not be the best date place.  At first we wanted to try the sampler but got discouraged with the extra charge so tried the Chocolate Financier Cake and Strawberry Limeade. The Chocolate Financier Cake was very fine. I've never had Bavarian cream frozen and it was a great taste with the cranberry sauce. The crumble was my favorite part of that dish. The Strawberry Limeade was a very cute layered dessert to share with my friends. Being Filipino, I was SO surprised to see Calamansi used, it was the first dessert I had that ever used it. The dessert was alright except that the strawberries were slightly sour.   Overall, I did enjoy my experience at Candybar especially with a couple great friends! Be prepared for a wait and to squeeze. Also, you may want to bring a flashlight to their bathroom! :)",

I like the decor, being able to play board games, and the owners were super nice even though it was crazy busy when we were there. \u00a0  The reason I'm giving it a 4 is because I think people should definitely check it out, but the owners could improve the place in a few areas. \u00a0Here is my note to the owners about how it could be improved! \u00a0  1.) The food is pretty good, but like a lot of other people said, they could have a bigger variety, specials, or more unique treats. \u00a0My friend and I had the apple a la mode (super super delicious) and the Tiramisu (average). \u00a0I forget the two drinks, but they are all centered around sparkling wine and very delish. \u00a0They could definitely open an hour-2 hours earlier and do an apertivo style happy hour; more appetizers and drinks. \u00a0  2.) The place is very crowded and the wait can be long (we waited an hour and a half but we came on the last day of the Groupon so our bad, but it sounds like others waited awhile as well). \u00a0Like someone else said, the boardgames are cool, but it does feel a little cramped and rushed when there are so many people waiting outside. \u00a0It would be awesome to expand the place or get some outdoor seating. \u00a0They seem like they are getting more popular and could afford to expand a little or open another location.  Overall, it's a great little place and look forward to seeing how they change in the upcoming months and years!",

    "review_text": "This place is probably one of the best ideas ever!  Why didn't I think of this? Personally I love desserts, and beautifully hand crafted? Candybar is a great spot for a dessert date or a night out with friends, dessert, board games and maybe a few sangrias.  As we drove around the area searching for parking, I spotted the place because it was dimly lit with a touch of pink glowing out. I knew it had to be it. For a Friday evening at about 7-8PM, it was slightly crowded. We got in and were seated right away. The tables are pretty close together, as the space is small.  I took a look at the menu and decided to get the dessert for 2, 4 for $25? We decided this would be the best option since we get to sample more things at a reasonable price. I realized that the regular option comes in bigger portions. It was okay though, the small portions were good enough.  We got the chocolate ice cream sandwich which was chocolate ice cream sandwiched between a macaron. It had glazed blueberries on the side. This was my favorite.  Apple pie a la mode ties with the macaron ice cream sandwich. It had a great apple pie taste with pie crust/graham cracker crumbs and was topped with gingerbread ice cream.  Lemon tart is basically what it says. A cookie tart filled with a tart lemon-y custard and had ice cream? And coconut shavings on the side. It said it came with a coconut macaron but I guess it was all smashed? Idk, this was ok.  My least favorite was the japanese cheesecake. I did not like the texture of it, but I think that's how japanese cheesecake is. It's basically a sponge type of cake and it came with liquored honeydew and guava ice cream. I enjoyed the two, but the cake itself wasn't that good.",

    "review_text": "A one-of-a-kind type of place that largely benefits from being possibly the only quality dessert bar in SF.  Desserts- Not quite spectacular but definitely above average. The Apple Ala Mode was essentially a well-made apple crumble sitting in a pool of caramel and topped with apple slices. The highlight was definitely the scoop of gingerbread ice cream that came with the whole thing. It was just a normal cream color with specks that made it look like vanilla bean in the low light but tasted of gingerbread and was a great pairing with the caramel sauce. Quite creative to stick that with an apple crumble-type dessert. I also got to see the Peanut Butter Jelly Time, Flourless Chocolate Banana Torte, and Ice Cream Sundae which my friends ordered. They all looked great and were presented on large plates. The Ice Cream Sundae is a bit of a deconstructed version with three little sandwiches on a long rectangular dish so don't expect a giant glass with a cherry on top when you're ordering.  Drinks- Definitely where Candybar shines true. Dessert cocktails you probably can't find anywhere else. From soju to sparkling wine to sangria they definitely have creative options to choose from which all tasted great. Something to note is that most of the flavors were fruit based rather than chocolate or other types of liquor. I think there might have been one cocktail that had Bailey's but otherwise it seemed to be mostly fruity. I don't think it was a seasonal menu since we were there in the winter but there's a possibility that they change up there menu? I guess you'll have to find out by going sometime!  Overall, a nice casual bar for a laid-back weekend night. They don't have a whole lot of seating but they do have some sofa areas for bigger groups. There's a full bar to sit at as well and board games to entertain! They've done the cutesy/classy vibe well and I can't wait to come back!",

Last evening, we head out with our last day Groupon, into the rain for a 10 minute walk to the Candybar. Arriving a few minutes past 9 pm, we placed our name behind a waiting list of 15. Undaunted by the list and surrounded by other last day Groupon holders, we scour the menu selecting 6 delectable treats and waited and observed.  We never got our chance to nibble away at the Candybar creations.  It appears that Candybar was unprepared for last day Groupon coupons and the influx of late night visitors was too much for the host to appease. His striking comment was, \"It's not my problem that you waited one year to use your coupons.\" [note, some folks didn't even mention having a Groupon]. After he offered numerous other unpleasant comments we realized that indeed this was his problem; but that he lacked the skills and etiquette of a good host and that Candybar was unprepared for the Groupon burden. Noticing numerous open seats during that last hour of Groupon use, we recognized another issue was the inability or unwillingness to quickly turn the empty tables.  As 10 pm approached, the host announced that he was no longer seating customers. We inquired if Candybar would honor the coupon on a later date. Answer - No! We asked if we could take our order as a take out. Answer - No! We asked if we could enjoy one treat each as we stood waiting. Answer - No. We asked if the host could suggest an option for us. Answer - Yes, use your coupons earlier.   The loss of the Groupon value and no late night treat was merely an inconvenience; however it does reaffirm our vast choices as we walked down the street and into Bar 821, where we were welcomed with open arms. In our one hour of waiting I estimated Candybar turned away (waiting list folks that simply left, or those denied seating) over 35, potentially new customers. I guess we'll have to stay with Citizen Cake on Fillmore because we value kindness and professionalism in addition to awesome treats.",

My friend got the 50/50 which had some type of cran-vodka and the alcohol could not be tasted nor felt at all! We shared the red velvet cake which was coated in coconut flakes and ordered the Japanese Cheeecake which came with amazing guava sorbet and honeydoo pieces w/ champagne ice shavings. Really cool! All good, but not great. Will go back to try other desserts, however. Service was good and ambiance was eclectic, but not as ambiant as it should be.",

Ice Cream Sandwich: \u00a0Almond Parisian Macaron / Chocolate Ganache / Berries / Honeydew Ice Cream -- The best dessert out of the four ordered. \u00a0The macaron was perfect and it was plated nicely. \u00a0  I don't remember the name of the other dessert, but it was a S'more. \u00a0I remember there was caramel in it, but we were not fans as it tasted burnt. \u00a0  **Cocktails**  Passion Fruit Delight - sparkling wine, passion fruit syrup: \u00a0It's a bubbly. \u00a0It definitely lacked in flavor as I couldn't taste the passion fruit at all. \u00a0I would not order this again.  Mango Tango Bellini - sparkling wine, mango syrup, mango-tangerine sorbet: \u00a0I liked this. \u00a0The glass came rimmed with sugar and there was a ball of mango-tangerine sorbet in the middle of the bubble. \u00a0The sorbet was delicious and blended nicely with the sparkling wine. \u00a0It's definitely a girly drink. \u00a0  **Service**  Service was okay. \u00a0  **Overall**  It's cute place for a date or to hang out with friends. \u00a0The prices are pretty average for dessert and drinks. However, I've had better tasting desserts. \u00a0Parking is horrible so it's probably better to carpool or take a taxi/bus. \u00a0Would I come back? \u00a0Probably if friends wanted to go, but I've been to better dessert bars/lounges.",

The fruity drink for the evening was the Strawberry Kiss which was okay. It was similar to a cough syrup?!?  The Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo was decent but did have a little too much \"noise\" in the dessert with peanut butter brittle, nuts etc.   The soft cheesecake was also very mediocre with again too much noise...  Service wasn't too friendly by the staff and the lighting inside the bar/lounge was on the darker side...a little too dark.   There was also a candle for ambiance...but since the table was too small...it was a waste of space!  In summary, this seems to be a dessert venue with potential.

I highly recommend the Raspberry Delight (raspberry syrup and sparkling wine), the Jasmine Sparkle (sparkling wine, jasmine, lemon), or the red Sangria. So refreshing and pairs nicely with all the desserts. My friend and I ordered dessert too and tried the Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo which is a frozen light purple lavender honey semi freddo topped with nutella powder, pieces of homemade almond brittle, and little balls of fresh cantelope. It looked so amazing my friend and I took pictures of it with our iphones. I was so pleased with this place! Plus the bathroom is so romantic too. There is no lighting in the bathroom but, on a table in the bathroom, are pillar candles that serve as the lighting. It is dim but it's supposed to be a romantic theme throughout the place and the bathroom is no exception. \u00a0Will definitely return again!!",

    "review_text": "I'm a big fan of sweets, alcohol, and multitasking. I know, an odd trio of interests. I also get a pathetic pleasure from crossing things off of lists. So when Candybar gave me the opportunity to multitask by sampling some desserts, boozin' it up, and finally deleting this bookmark I've had for months....I was in heaven. I was accompanied by the fabulous Gill C for a \"Dessert For Dinner\" get together.  First things first, I love the name. It's great. Candybar...one word that completely expresses their entire mission. They could stand to go a little farther with the finishing touches though...maybe some bowls of unique and interesting candies on the tables, a beautiful lollipop as a stirrer for my cocktail, etc etc. Nothing too tacky, just a few small extras.  Ok, now the important stuff. We ordered:  1. Sangria: Had the red. Ordered the white, but they were out of it. This did not please me. The red was good though, a little on the sweet side.   2. Passionfruit Delight: sparkling wine and passion fruit syrup. This was good, though I didn't taste much of the passionfruit.  3. Chocolate Fudgesicle with pralined cornnuts, caramel, and vanilla ice cream. Ok, but too small. I'm not exactly sure what was in the fudgesicle, it almost tasted like non-hardened magic shell topping. the cornnuts were interesting, but not really sure they contributed much to the dish. I could take them or leave them. Size-wise this dessert is way too small.   4. Nacho Sundae with papaya, mango, kiwi, cilantro, avocado yogurt, candied jalapeno, and horchata ice cream. Love the idea here...the execution needs some help. Mostly in the departments of size and ingredient distribution. There was only one candied jalapeno, so only I got to try it. Also, there were 4 chips total...2 chips each? We are ladies who like to eat, and this just isn't cutting it. The mango was cutely diced to look like shredded cheese. I liked that, but there needed to be more of it. Everyone wants their nachos cheesy. \u00a0Both the avocado yogurt and horchata ice cream were delicious.   There is a large seating area in front that can be reserved for private parties. There was a party here while we were dining and they brought in about 8 large pizzas from Little Star and stored them on the table right next to us. After our skimpy little desserts I was dying to steal a slice.  The service was a little off. Not really openly bitchy but kind of cold, and I prefer my sweets served with a smile. Also, the server cleared our plates while I was still chewing my last bite, and there were some scraps I was still planning to eat. Give me a minute to finish up woman!  Happy hour is every night 6-8. There are some good drink deals ($3 sangria, $4 specialty cocktails), but no deals on food. Candybar is a good place for a treat, but if you're a total glutton like me, eat a snack beforehand!",

Some say dessert is a guilty pleasure. \u00a0Well, if that is true, then send me to prison as no jury will find me innocent as I am quite GUILTY of enjoying dessert at Candybar.  SETTING: \u00a0The lighting was slightly dim, but I believe there is a bar area, as well as various tables throughout the dining area. \u00a0After looking thru the menu, we chose:  SIP: \u00a0 1. \u00a0Strawberry Kiss: \u00a0Pucker up cause this drink is definitely an affectionate treat for your taste buds. \u00a0Not overly sweet and yet refreshing. \u00a0Recommended....by myself and my brother.  2. \u00a0Passion Fruit cocktail: \u00a0My mom, who doesn't drink that much, nearly finished her entire glass. \u00a0She liked it!  3. \u00a0Lychee Guava Martini: \u00a0Though he prefers beer most of the time, my brother liked this drink. \u00a0Perhaps it was a fitting complement to our dessert as he drank all of it. \u00a0  CONFECTIONS: 1. \u00a0Red Velvet Cake: \u00a0Delightful. \u00a0This dessert is worth it the extra time on the treadmill. \u00a0The ice cream aided to combat the tart frosting. \u00a0Cake was served warm and moist. \u00a0So good and delicious.  2. \u00a0Apple a la Mode: \u00a0Another sweet treat. \u00a0The gingerbread ice cream and apple slices balance this dessert well. \u00a0 Truly delectable.  GAME ON!: Apparently, there are board games to play to pass the time waiting for your dessert, or just to revisit your childhood for a brief moment. \u00a0While waiting, I played 2 games of \u00a0Connect Four, a game I hadn't played since elementary school. \u00a0I challenged my brother first, and we decided the winner would challenge my mom. \u00a0I won both games. \u00a0Childhood reclaimed.  BOTTOM LINE: \u00a0Wonderful desserts! \u00a0Drinks paired well with dessert. \u00a0The availability of board games was definitely an added bonus to a fun time.",

We got our desserts relatively quickly considering the large crowd (and the apparent private party). \u00a0Had three different desserts - the lavender honey creme fraiche semi-freddo, lemon tart, and the chocolate financier cake.  Lemon tart had some cream on top, broken coconut macaroons, and some sort of powder which I can't remember. \u00a0This was pretty good.  Chocolate financier cake also had some ice cream, cranberry sauce, almonds, and breton crumble. \u00a0This wasn't bad, but probably my least favorite out of the three.  My favorite, though, was the lavender honey creme fraiche semi-freddo, which came with almond brittle, nutella powder, and cantaloupe. \u00a0Eating a little bit of everything made for the perfect bite. \u00a0If they sold the almond brittle in boxes, I would buy them. \u00a0I loved the stuff.

    "review_text": "I docked a star off for the ridiculously small portioned sizes. Look, I know it's dessert and all, but they shouldn't be microscopic in size.  Anyways, on to the review. My review is specifically for their desserts and ambiance. Ambiance is great--I came with 2 other friends, but the setting is such a great date place. We were on a girls night out--talking about how ridiculous some boys can be...kidding, we were discussing universal healthcare vs. single payer and the implications one strategy has for the state of the economy over the other..right. So many of the couples looked like they were there on a date. I also love that they have board games--we played Candy Land, very appropriate for a place named Candybar! Also, I won!   The three of us ordered the following and shared amongst each other:  Nacho Sundae: This is the craziest thing I've ever seen. It looks like real nachos, so when you bite into it, your mind expects salty since you associate nacho-looking dishes to, well, taste like nachos. But then, it's sweet. Crazy! My gripe about this dish: they need to have more candied jalapenos, and it should be a little larger.   White chocolate mousse: really good. They serve it with blueberry compote. The white chocolate mousse tastes best when mixed in with the blueberry compote. This was a good size--no microscope needed!  Chocolate cremeaux cake: I think that's how \"cremeaux\" was spelled. Anyways, this is really good. Served with this raspberry sauce on top of the cake, and thyme ice cream at the side. This was really good, but way too small. I mean, you might as well actually BRING a microscope with you to see this one. It was ridiculous how small this was.   Didn't have the chocolate fudgesicle, but I did see it as the couple next to us ordered it. No idea how it tastes, but the size is insanely small. It's dessert appropriate for a toddler, not an adult. For its price, I would say it's overpriced considering the size. Candybar, please consider making your desserts larger.  Will definitely be back. I LOVE desserts, and a place called Candybar serving up delicious, albeit tiny, desserts is the perfect place to satisfy my sweet tooth.",

I went here with two friends (including Julia K.!) and like she said, though they close at midnight, they let you lounge quite a bit past closing. No rush, no bother. Truly nice people.  Ambiance: dim-lit Asian-fused lounge with game boards? So cool. Sound level is most definitely bearable.  I had a taste of their strawberry kiss and mango tango bellini and they were both sweet without being overwhelming. Spot on. The mango tango bellini was also spot on, with a dollop of mango-tangerine sorbet in the center.  The Japanese cheesecake($10), on it's own, kind of tasted like any other Japanese cheesecake that I could buy in Japantown, if not Ranch 99. However, the champagne granita just blew my mind in completing the diced honeydew, guava sorbet, and cheesecake plate.   My friends didn't like their passion fruit chocolate mousse too much, but the first few bites were delicious. It became a bit tart, sweet, and thick, but I thoroughly enjoyed the bites I had :)  I came back on another occasion with another friend and had the macaron trio - I would easily come back just for those.   Not the best prices around, but definitely fair. You're paying for plating, service, ambiance, and well... The experience of good dessert.

I failed a little because I blithely expected small bites to go along with the 3, 4, glasses of wine without doing my proper yelper research and found the menu almost completely dessert-focused. Which...well..duh.   So naturally, we had dessert for dinner. The tiramisu was rich and creamy with an almost cheesecake-like consistency. If you have a chocolate tooth you will die happy, and you might die if you eat the whole thing alone. The strawberry limeade wasn't nearly as sugary and lime-y and sour-y as I was afraid it would be. Think instead of a strawberry and key-lime pie with a really, really good crust.",

I didn't order any cocktails but there were a number of them that looked really appetizing. We ordered the red velvet cake with coconut flakes and toasted marshmallows. So good. The marshmallows were probably the best I've ever had and the cake was incredibly rich. I would definitely recommend and return here again!",

Very helpful and friendly staff. Cute, homey, and clean bathroom, too (away-from-home bathrooms are extra important during pregnancy!).  It's a bit pricey for me to come on a regular basis.

We shared one ice cream sandwich: \u00a0brown rice tea ice cream in between a green tea French macaron sprinkled w/ cocoa nibs, sitting blueberry sauce and fresh blueberries. \u00a0The ice cream was delicious and on the light side of sweetness, but the macaron was overly sweet (I could only handle two bites of that). \u00a0  Super attentive service. \u00a0Closes at 10, but no one seemed to care. \u00a0I'd definitely return if the mood for sipping a yummy cocktail in a chill setting were to struck me in NOPA.",

We got a couple round of beers, dessert sampler and another dessert for around $60. Beware, although blue moon is served in a tall glass, it's poured out of a bottle. For the desserts the tiramisu was our favorite. It was the only thing we finished and is the most memorable one in my books.   One thing I didn't like was there's only one bathroom available for both gender. I had to pee super bad and unfortunately got stuck behind someone who took forever to lay a deuce. Needless to say, when I went in I pretty much tasted it in my mouth. Ugh, but other than that it's a nice place to drink and chat, but if you're on a budget I'll give it a pass.",

All those salty snacks that I've been paying attention to should step aside now that I've found you. A piece of advice: girls, leave the boys at home. They'll hang with you thinking, \"maybe we can get porkchops at Nopa later on or even a burrito at the taqueria nearby\". They'll be disappointed because once you come here, all you want to do is park yourselves at one of their comfortable lounge chairs or take up space at their dark wood tables and play board games while they sit there clutching their growling tummies.  Catherine Li (oh goddess dessert maker!) is some sort of a creative genius. She doesn't use overly complicated ingredients: no gelees, no foam, no sugar domes. She uses simple,straight up ingredients you've known growing up. She transforms and puts together these ingredients, makes it look very pretty on the plate and so utterly delicious on the tongue. Like the peanut butter jelly time! \u00a0which has chocolate tart, peanut butter cream, salted candied peanuts and blackberries. My girlfriend LOVES peanut butter anything and before she opened her mouth to order, I said, \"you're getting the peanut butter thing right?\" \u00a0So, all you Reese's peanut butter cup fanatics, this dessert's for you.  The apple ala mode was on the very sweet side of the sugar spectrum and it had a hazelnut crust, cream cheese filling, caramel with a scoop of gingerbread ice cream.   My buttermilk vanilla bean panna cotta was topped with a cocoa macaron, balsamic strawberry reduction and fresh strawberries. I was in the mood for something in the custard family and the balsamic - strawberry combination really works.  My blood orange cocktail put me in the right mood with sparking wine, blood orange bitters and a sugar cube to keep the bubbles floating to the top. Bubbly always makes me feel....well, bubbly! ;)  Candybar, you put me on a sugar high that I never, EVER wanna let go.",

First, parking is really difficult to find - it took 20 minutes for my roomie, Tiff K., and I to find a spot. Then, it took about half an hour for us to grab a seat.   The place is pretty small and very hipster. There is art on the walls that are quite... unique. \u00a0It's not exactly the trendy, classy dessert lounge feel that I had envisioned it would be. There are board games, which is a nice touch and makes Candybar a cool hang out spot, but again... not exactly chic. I guess it's a lounge in the sense that you can lounge around there playing games, eating dessert, and sipping on drinks.   We only tried the Apple a la Mode for dessert - meh. It was okay, but honestly the flavors did not work well together. The texture was soft and almost a little mushy. The one highlight? The DRINKS. I tried the Strawberry Kiss and my roomie had a blueberry pomegranate drink. Both were yummy! The drinks are definitely not strong, but something to sip on more for flavor.   Candybar might be a cool local neighborhood hang out spot... I think it just depends on what you want that experience to be. I wanted cute &amp; trendy and to-die-for desserts.

The Peanut Butter Jelly Time, Apple A la Mode, Strawberry Limeade, and the Japanese Cheesecake came out on a single plate. It was a mean fight, since only inches separated them on the plate.

The concept of Candybar is such a unique simple amazing idea, dessert, drinks, music, art, lounge, and even games. \u00a0You really can't go wrong here for after dinner drinks and dessert or before dinner drinks or if dessert and drinks is your main entree. \u00a0I brought my folks, family, friends, and visitors to the Bay here and only one person hasn't liked this spot. \u00a0I think it might have be someone in the industry, of course it was right. \u00a0   If you have favorites keep in mind the menu occasionally changes, but every new item i've tried has been a pleasant surprise. \u00a0Candybar is a refreshing spot to the neighborhood, the city, and the Bay and gives balance to the trendy wave of sweets from froyo, cupcakes, donuts, and craziness of ice cream flavors.",

Blood orange sparkling wine - tastes and looks nothing like blood orange Jasmine sparkling wine - pretty cool, needs more jasmine flavor Passion fruit sparkling wine - the best out of the three we had yesterday!  There's something wrong with you if you don't like red velvet! We each ordered a red velvet cake with coconut and mint ice cream - mint ice cream was horrible... the cake from red velvet was dry... too much coconut where it over powered the taste of the cake. In addition, the coconut was hard :/ \u00a0It's a cute place with a cool nitch, however, drinks and desserts can be better!  Parking is a bizatch.... i swear it's worse than Broadway!",

    "review_text": "The first time I tried to come here was on a Tuesday night back in July and found it closed on Tuesdays. I haven't been back until last night. The day after Thanksgiving, the place wasn't too packed, and I found parking across the street. We were happy to escape the cold air outside and step into the warm dessert lounge to snag the spot by the window. Their menu has changed since the summer, and prices are slightly lower now. Desserts now range from $4-$7.50, as opposed to $8-12 then, and I no longer see $14 tasting menu. My friend ordered the apple pie with ice cream which was served on a slab - not the best idea since the ice cream melted onto the table. My other friend got the butterscotch pie which was good but nothing amazing; it tasted like a giant reese's pieces. I ordered the salted buttermilk panna cotta which the 3 of us thought was a bit too salty; the salt crystals were uneven and unnerving whenever I bit into them. I enjoyed my white sangria (didn't taste the alcohol), and my friends enjoyed their wine. The bill for 3 desserts, 4 glasses of wine, and my sangria came out to be around $70 + tip. Overall, Candybar is a nice low-key place to drink and hang out if you don't mind average desserts. I wonder if Sunday Brunch tastes better.",

I will also point out that if you're a single dude, you should be hanging out here because the dude to chick ratio is nil.  Took my boyfriend here for his birthday pre-dessert (because you ALL know that I'M the icing, cake, cherry, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream at the end of a rainbow DESSERT). I have to say that if I hadn't had a Groupon I'd have been even more underwhelmed. My lavender semifreddo wasn't tecturally great and I wasn't overly impressed with the flavor combinations either. My honey got the apple pie a la mode and it was pretty funny because he remarked on how much cinnamon flavor was in the ice cream..except it was supposed to be ginger. He's a level 3 sommelier, his palate is EXTREMELY well developed, so I believe him and his flavor profiles. The service was pretty lackluster and my Kir Royale wasn't that great. My boyfriend was impressed with their wine list so I would recommend going that route. Everyone was playing board games but I think the atmosphere would have benefited immensely from a chill, ambient tune spinning DJ...so many romantic possibilities. We went on a weeknight so it wasn't crowded but I don't think we'll be back...kind of a meh experience for me.",

    "review_text": "I went with a friend for desserts and drinks on a Thursday night. We made it for happy hour and each got a cocktail - Jasmine Sparkle for her and Raspberry Delight for me. Sorry, guys - thumbs waaaay down. \u00a0While the taste was nice, considering the description is sparkling wine, I'd expect there to be, well, sparkling wine - as in, bubbles. \u00a0It was flat as a tween girl's prepubescent chest. \u00a0  As for the desserts, we ordered 4 and here's the lowdown:  Ice Cream Sandwich 2/5 - Macaron was nice and chewy, the honeydew ice cream was honeydewy in a good way. \u00a0The two together - ummmm, for me it's a 'meh'.  Apple Ala Mode 0/5 - Yikes. \u00a0Unless you like slimy apple slices and slimy whole hazelnuts, stay away. \u00a0This is not your grandmother's apple pie. \u00a0In a very bad way.  Lemon &amp; White Chocolate 3/5 - Nice lemony flavor and the granola was more like a crumble which we both liked. \u00a0A little less sorbet would have been nice IMO - the tartness kind of took over the subtle lemon in the cake and white chocolate of the mousse.  Drunken S'mores 4/5 - Our favorite of the 4. \u00a0Would have loved the rum/brandy sauce they drizzle on top after bringing it to the table to have been warm. \u00a0  Service was attentive. Our waiter/host was friendly and fun. \u00a0Pricing was acceptable but I'd stay away from the drinks. \u00a0As I said, if you're expecting sparkling wine in your drink, it's a bit disappointing when it's just flat.  Overall, a fun place to visit once in a while. But there are lots of other joints in SF with phenomenal desserts and drinks that I'd frequent before coming back here.",

The Kir Royale is great for someone who doesn't mind a strong drink undisguised; the Bellini is fruitier and much sweeter) +Sophisticated, mature clientele (mostly: see below) +Nice array of boardgames, including some I have never heard of before +Fantastic attention to sweet little details, including the check being presented in an empty Whopper's box!  CONS: -Loud; kind of hard to hold a conversation -SMALL venue! :( we had to wait about half an hour to get seating -On a related note, this was definitely NOT \u00a0to hold an entire bachelorette party, bride-to-be with the genitalia on your veil... -Pricey if you're there without a Groupon  a few TIPS for the uninitiated: 1. Definitely call ahead to make a reservation if you can, especially on a weekend night 2. You don't have to be 21 to come in, sit, and and order a dessert!

Their ice cream trio (oreo, reese's peanut butter, and kit kat) is tasty, but the scoops are small. \u00a0The champagne bubbly drinks are rather small-ish, so I get their Riesling. \u00a0Another big plus: they have board games there so it makes for a fun (and not crazy) night. \u00a0And even though the place is small, I've been here ~3 times on Friday/Saturday nights and haven't had to wait more than 10 minutes to get seated because the turnaround is quite quick.",

    "review_text": "We went to Candybar with high hopes, we left disappointed.  Candybar calls itself a dessert lounge, but advertises a savory menu by a different chef from desserts as well. \u00a0Sold by this idea, we decided to have dinner there as well. \u00a0That was a mistake. \u00a0  While they may have a different chef for the savory menu, the food is one step bellow bar food in how satisfied it leave you. \u00a0The menu consists mostly of items that require little or no cooking, come in small quantities, and are relatively expensive. The later point was exemplified for me by the thin six pieces of scallop sashimi, as I had been to the market a few days before and brought six large scallops to cook at home for the same price.  At this point we decided to give the place the benefit of the doubt, as it does bill itself as a dessert place, so we jumped into the dessert menu with gusto. Sadly, here we were also very disappointed. \u00a0There were four of us, as most ordered different items, so that we tasted most of the dessert menu.  The consistency of the amuse was rather odd, and the gelee that was supposedly at the bottom almost nonexistent. \u00a0The baked alaka was no better. The blood orange sorbet inside one dimensional. The chocolate brioche bred pudding, was not bred pudding and it did not taste like brioche. It was more of a chocolate taste with a very simple flavor. The warm vanilla cake was disliked. \u00a0The thickened olive oil tasting strange.  The party that ordered the panna cotta did not realize at the time it was cheese flavored and disliked it. Surprisingly, this is the one disk I liked, but as a cheese course, not a dessert. Finally, the malted milk at the end was overly sweet.  In addition to the food, our particular table was the last one before the kitchen entrance and the bathroom. As the wall angles in, when people sit across from the table, the space between the two tables is very narrow, which results in every bumping into you if you are lucky the sit there.  It is also rather annoying that you cannot select desserts a la carte, and that you are forced to have a dessert tasting.  After $240 and a couple of hours, we left, thinking it was a shame that the place did not work out, but with no plans to visit again. I give it two stars for at least trying an interesting concept, but execution did not leave anything to commend.",

I had the Strawberry Kiss which was a mix of Sparkling Wine and strawberry juice... OMG, it was soooo delicious, they can sneak up on you, so beware. Having five of them would get me in a lot of trouble. Eek. Priscella T. ordered a Passion Fruit Sparkle and that was also very tasty. Cocktails are normally $8-9 but during happy hour they're $4.  We, also, ordered a slice of the Red Velvet Cake at $8. The red velvet cake was soooo moist and topped with a generous amount of creme cheese frosting which was sweetened perfectly! And the coconut shavings added a nice texture. The plate was accompanied by a tiny scope of vanilla bean ice cream, garnished with red velvet cake crumbs/shavings, something red and crumbly.

The restaurant is pretty chill and inviting. \u00a0There are board games for anyone wanting to feel like a kid agan. Me and my gang played Candy Land and Battleship which I got spanked in both. Boo! But anyways I tried the Mango Bellini that actually came with a scoop of mango sorbet..yummy! It was sooo good, I seriously had to put my glass out of my reach \u00a0so I didn't down it. \u00a0We also had a desert sampler and honestly there was soo much food I couldn't tell you what we had. But believe me when I said there was no survivors! \u00a0All I remember was the carrot cake and it was so soft and delicious. \u00a0I tried the Sangria and it wasn't anything special but the happy hour price was worth it. \u00a0My friend really liked it. \u00a0I cannot wait to go back and enjoy another mango bellini.",

Or as they bill themselves: \"Dessert, Wine, Art\"  Great concept actually. Serve sweet desserts (by Catherine Li) of about 9 beautiful choices, all superbly constructed and gorgeously plated, ranging in price from $5 for the Housemade Ice Cream Trio of Kit Kat, Oreo, Reeses's pieces.....to $9 for Red Velvet Cake, Blueberry Mochi Cake, Apple Pie a la Mode, Peanut Butter Jelly Time or Chocolate Mousse. In between in price are Strawberry Limeade, Chocolate Butterscotch Brownie, and Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding.  Suuuweeet!  Add sweet specialty cocktails, such as Passion Fruit Delight (7), Blood Orange Bellini (8), Raspberrry Delight (7), Strawberry Kiss (8), Kir Royale, Jasmine Sparkle, or Blueberry Pomegranate Fusion (all 8), and you have dreams in your mouth that are  Suuuweeet!  Next time I will have to try the 50/50, which is Soju/Orange Soda/Vanilla for $8, or the Spicy Michelada of Pacifico/SaltRim/Tabasco/Lime juice (6). They also have 4 or 5 each of Bubbly, Red, White and Dessert wines.   They have a great Happy Hour (6 - 8pm) with $2 Pacifico, $3 Sangria, $3 house sparkling wine, and most of the specialty drinks above for only $4!   Suuuweeet!  Add the Kung Fu Taco truck being parked outside from 6 - 8pm on Tuesday's and Thursdays, and you can add $2 and $3 delicious tacos to your Happy hour priced drinks!   Suuuweeeet!  Finally you have art on the walls by local artists for sale, and great seating spaces for groups to share fun. The service was also very efficient and very friendly! Little Ali served our group of 20+ people with a smile everytime!  Suuuweeet!",

Sadface  Red velvet: Overly decadent, overly dense, overly sweet. Also, the marshmallows are kind of non sequitur. Skip for next time.  Ice cream sundae: admittedly, I was hoping for an actual sundae instead of a deconstructed one, but it was still pretty tasty. The bruleed bananas were my favourite part. :)   Disclaimer: I'm a pastry chef, so my dessert judgements are always a bit skewed. Don't let it stop you from trying it!   But the service did kinda leave something to be desired.  The drinks were fine, and not especially noteworthy, but I'd drink the Jasmine Sparkler I got again if I were there.   Plus, they have games! And a magic 8 ball! And REALLY cool art!  I'd go back to try something else still, since their sundae was decent.",

First of all, for $8/dessert, make them a decent amount. \u00a0I've tasted far better desserts in San Diego (at Extraordinary desserts) for $8-9 with also 3x the portions. \u00a0What we got last night was less than what any restaurant would serve you... \u00a0It was definitely NOT worth it. SMALL. TINY. MINUSCULE. \u00a0You get the picture.  The ambiance is romantic and definitely a date-spot. \u00a0They have spacious booths and tables, which are good for moderately sized groups. \u00a0They also have board games for you to play and also ice breaker cards. \u00a0 The place has the right idea, but when you're charging $12/glass of muscat, and $8/dessert for small portions of dessert... it gets ridiculously expensive... and again, not worth it.  We were out of there in 30minutes. \u00a0Would not come back. \u00a0My search for bomb-ass gourmet desserts continues...",

    "review_text": "What a bummer this place was! \u00a0I have been waiting to go to this place for months now and what I thought would be heaven, turned out to be a huge mess.  First of all, there is no personality to this place what-so-ever. \u00a0It's a really bland place with no atmosphere to speak of. \u00a0I was bored just walking in. \u00a0They offer games to make your time there fun but most of the games had pieces missing so we couldn't play. \u00a0If you are going to offer games, switch them out for new ones once pieces go missing \u00a0so people can actually enjoy being there.  They had a creative menu but I wish that the flavors lived up to the hype. \u00a0For a place that is all about sugar, you would think that their drinks would be sweeter. \u00a0I got the strawberry kiss. \u00a0They used a cheap champagne that tasted like cheap alcohol. \u00a0There wasn't enough sweetness to call it a kiss. \u00a0What was supposed to be a sweet strawberry kiss, turned out to be just a bad kisser.  The desserts were even worse. \u00a0Really weird combinations that didn't compliment each other very well. \u00a0We got the Candybar Dessert for two which is actually a great deal. \u00a04 selections of their desserts that were decent sized.  -Peanut Butter Jelly Time: This isn't what you think at all. \u00a0It's a tart thing with, what is supposed to be a peanut butter mouse in the middle with blackberries on top and what I guess was supposed to be a jam sauce? \u00a0It was topped with peanuts but the whole thing, while different, should have tasted like a peanut butter jelly SOMETHING. \u00a0All of the flavors were separated. \u00a0It should have blended together but when eating it all at the same time, cancelled out each other and tasted really bland. \u00a0I tasted the peanut butter, I tasted the black berries but it didn't taste like peanut butter and jelly time.  -Strawberry Limeade: WHAT THE HECK! \u00a0BORING! \u00a0Again, all the flavors were really bland. \u00a0Nothing stood out or tasted delectable. \u00a0The strawberry mousse was too soft, almost watery, and there wasn't enough cake or crust or anything for it to taste like a dessert.  -Apple A La Mode: \u00a0While the ice cream was really good, the rest was a mess. \u00a0The cake was too dry. \u00a0Again, nothing blended well. \u00a0It was just awful.  -Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo: \u00a0Don't even go near this one. \u00a0It came with some synthetic powder on the side that threw off the taste of everything. \u00a0Yuck.  I would give this place a much lower rating but their staff was really nice and the bartender is all about being generous. \u00a0I was watching him pour drinks and he made sure that the glass was full to the brim. \u00a0He was very calculated about this too. \u00a0Very patient and wanted to make sure that the customer got their moneys worth. \u00a0That's a bad ass bartender!  I think this place is ok to try once and maybe with a group of friends but I will not be going back or recommending to anyone for fear of sheer embarrassment of recommending a bad place.",

My girlfriends and I went after work, and we were the only folks in the joint (literally). All the better for us though, because we got all of the lovely attention of the gracious host and friendly waitstaff. I think Candy Bar is supposed to be an after-dinner spot, but the savory dishes made it a fun shared plates place as well.  Pastry chef Jake Godby (Fifth Floor, Coi) has created an innovative little menu, half savory and half sweet. First, my faves: the pork belly with peach sorbet, and the PB&amp;J -- a foie gras cream, peanut brittle and jam concoction -- was better than the sammies of my youth. I was disappointed in the beef cheeks, which tasted rather bland, even though it was soaked in caramelized onion broth and topped with a red pepper bonbon.   With a glass of Malbec, our tiny plates disappeared faster than you can say \"where the...?\" I sincerely hope this is the first in a wave of dessert lounges, for times of extreme indulgence.",

We had their tiramisu and a honey/lavender brick type thing; both cold and good, but nothing spectacular. Both tasted a little frozen still.  They also do not have a liquor license, so expect drinks with Soju and Sparkling wine...which was fine for us. We had sparkling wine cocktails to pair with our desserts, and they were pretty good. A little sugary but hey, you are at a place called Candybar.  I'm giving them a solid 3 stars mainly because our server was so friendly and chill, even after discovering we were there with a Living Social deal. Also, I really love all the local artwork and childhood memorabilia incorporated into their design. A legit Suzybake Oven was my towel holder in the ladies room,...so cute!

I love sweets and I love to lounge and this place is definitely my sweet spot to enjoy both in a cozy artful atmosphere where everyone is all smiles!  My bf made reservations for our party of 8 and we were graciously seated in our own comfy alcove with cushy seats and a window view. Our dessert hopping group was lucky enough to make the tail end of Candybar's happy hour which is 6-8pm daily. Their $4 sparkling cocktails are sweet and fizzy and give you a delicate buzz perfect for playing silly fun board games that they have there for anyone to play. My favorite was the Blood Orange Cocktail that tasted like a sweet ripe blood orange was just freshly squeezed into the glass and love the suger cube tossed into the flute and watching it dissolve into dancing bubbles that tickles your lips as you drink it.  I wanted to order one of every dessert but we started with the Tiramisu, PBJ Time, and Lavender Honey Cr\u00e8me Fraiche Semi Freddo which was my absolute favorite of the night. The rich cr\u00e8me fraiche texture with the suble honey hints to the semi freddo so full of sweet yet savory lavender flavor and fragrance really sung to me and filled me with romantic thoughts. It was paired with almond brittle which was eaten up quickly by the rest of my group so I didn't get to try it but it must have been a brilliant pairing. I enjoyed the tiramisu more than any that I've had recently and the PBJ time will be a favorite for any peanut butter lover with a sophisticated twist. Our waitress Mai was especially kind and helpful in every way even though it was a full house.  Also, this night at Candybar was particularly memorable because we heard President Obama announce the death of Osama bin Laden and the bartender was nice enough to pause and turn up the volume of the tv for us to listen to the speech in dramatic shock and silence.  Candybar is my kinda place! I only wish Candybar was open earlier in the day (they open at 6pm) and that parking in the area was easier to find. I can't wait to try the rest of their desserts and cocktails!",

The environment serves as a place to kick it with friends, play games and have dessert. However, this wouldn't be my first choice since the dessert here isn't that great...and it's on the higher end. For a group of 5, we tried the Lemon Tart, Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo, Japanese Cheesecake, Chocolate Financier Cake, and Mango Tango Bellini. Personally, I didn't find any of them amazing. The presentation is nice but the taste wasn't quite there for me. I liked the Lemon Tart because of the crust but that's about it. The Bellini tasted strong, but no effect.  The absolute worse thing was finding parking. We parked near McDonald's which is about a 10 minute walk from Candybar.",

I ordered two desserts ($8 each). \u00a0I ordered the apple cinnamon soup with financier cake because there was an appealing smell of cinnamon in the air when I walked in. \u00a0And after finding most of the other options too fruity, I ordered the chocolate cremeux with thyme ice cream.  The financier cake was rather dull and too easily overwhelmed by the fruity tartness of the apple cinnamon soup base. \u00a0While the apple soup was better than your average apple cider, I'll admit that it was pretty strongly reminiscent. \u00a0  The cremeux was better, though not by a whole lot. \u00a0it was basically a chocolate mouse with a slightly bitter chocolate. \u00a0The pomegranate was a nice contrast, but mostly it tasted like a more typical chocolate mouse with strawberry or raspberry. \u00a0While you could notice the thyme in the accompanying ice cream, you wouldn't be hard pressed to convince the less attentive it was just vanilla.  The staff was really friendly, most people were having a blast playing board games, and the music was quirky and upbeat, which made it hard not to smile. \u00a0If you're already in the neighborhood, it's definitely worth a visit. \u00a0But with such tough parking, I can't yet recommend it for the desserts.",

I believe the drinks are delicious and sweet although I would stay away from the Chocolate Bellini as it is an assault on the taste buds. And, I believe that the desserts are, for the most part, nice and light despite being creamy and sweet. I keep going back because it's a nice lounge where I can just have a conversation with my friends and eat some delicious sweet treats. Plus, there are a few bars nearby in case we want to do more drinking later on.",

Their servers all seem to have a real chip on their shoulder, however. I've never gotten a smile out of them--and I'm not a stingy patron. I tend to be easy to please--just don't treat me like my business is a pain in the ass. All said and done, though, it's a fun place to drop into if you need a late-night hangout!",

Yeah, apparently not, which is why their name should be Dessert Bar instead.  The place was pretty cute and had cool artwork, but I feel like the front windows should have had curtains over them and the whole place should have been darker. Since it's a dessert bar, it's surprising that they close so early (10pm I think), don't most people have dessert after dinner?  We ordered all of the desserts off of the A La Cart Menu. The desserts were good, but they definitely were not great....as Simon Cowell would say, \"they are very forgettable\"! And they were all things that I could probably make at home, couldn't they at least have put some blood oranges or some interesting combos of flavors.  The service was friendly although, when we asked if the wine we were ordering was good, the waiter said that he hadn't tried it yet, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say that it is due to the fact that they have just recently opened.  Overall the place was nothing special (and expensive) and I probably will not be going back unless they make some big changes!",

The desserts were good but not if you have a nut allergy. It seemed like many items had nuts with them.   My boyfriend ordered the apple a la mode. It was alright... We did not enjoy the gingerbread ice cream. I ordered the sundae without the bananas. It came with three little brownies with a small scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream on each brownie and was topped with a macaroon half. On the side was some sliced strawberries. I definitely enjoyed my dessert.  For our drinks, I ordered the strawberry kiss and my boyfriend ordered the mango tango. I enjoyed the strawberry kiss much more. I felt like I could drink them all night.   We enjoyed our time there with a Connect 5 competition. I subtracted a star for its prices on the desserts.

And ordering from the server takes much longer than going to the bar, which is annoying if you are trapped on the inside of a table.  That being said, their sangria is tasty (a bit sweet). The white sangria is not bad, but even sweeter, and also white sangria is an oxymoron! The chocolate butterscotch brownier with thyme ice cream was quite tasty, and I am certainly interested in trying other desserts.  As far as a space to hang out goes, it's pretty good if you have a relatively small party and can get there early enough to snag a table. The actual area is pretty small, so if you have to stand, it's pretty tight.   Overall, this place is worthy of say, 3.5 stars. But it's got a fairly unique vibe and I'm sure I'll be back.",

Yes I know that is a strong statement to make, but I believe it is that good. I can't remember everything I ate, but I remember every bite was a party in my mouth; with taste buds doing the dougie and gangnam style dance. In addition the presentation of each dessert is unbelievable! With the taste and presentation your getting, in my opinion, fine dining desserts at a very reasonable price. Desserts, Wine, Cocktails - what an amazing concept for this restaurant/lounge.  Customer service was great as well. I remember one time we didn't realize that they were closing up shop and we were the last customers, but the workers aloud us to finish our plates and leave whenever we were done (rather than being rushed out).  Games: yup thats right, this place got board and card games that I used to play in my elementary school days. Connect 4 anyone? UNO? Battleship? These sure brought back the memories. However, I do wish they would have Mancala, something my friend and I missed from our childhood.  Im almost afraid to tell people about this spot because sometimes the line can be long, but this place is really good. Dimmed light environment with great music plus good company makes for a perfect hang out spot.  Will return shortly, the Connect 4 battle continues!.....",

    "review_text": "ATTENTION ALL MEN: Need a hip, intimate place to bring a date and get her drunk the classy way? Well, then Candybar is the PERFECT place to bring her. Not that I condone getting people drunk on a date *lips sealed*!   Candybar serves up unique and beautifully presented desserts that are equally delicious and sexy cocktails that will impress your date and if not, it will at least give you both some endorphins and liquid courage to avoid those awkward \"silent\" moments.   My friends and I came to Candybar on Thursday, 5.13.10 for the Kung Fu Tacos HH on Tuesday and Thursday from 6-8 PM.   We arrived at around 6:45 PM, ordered our tacos outside which were brought inside Candybar for us to enjoy.  DRINKS ($6-$9; some are $4 from 6-8 PM):  *Stawberry Kiss (Sparkling Wine, Ginger Ale, and Strawberry): YUMMY! I'm not really a cocktail type of gal, but the Strawberry Kiss was very light and refreshing. The wine was slightly sweet, not too dry, and had just the right amount of bubbles to tingle your tongue. The whole strawberry was plump and sweet. Beware, this is a creeper. My friend and I have a HIGH alkie tolerance and we each had 3 glasses each which gave us a buzz as if we had 3-4 straight shots of GG or Remy.   *50/50 (Soju, Orange Soda, Vanilla): My other friend ordered this and it tasted like a spiked orange sherbet and vanilla popsicle. It was sweet, creamy, and STRONG enough to get him BUZZED; keeping in mind, he drinks GG like water.   DESSERTS ($5-9): *Apple a la Mode (Hazelnut crust, Cream cheese, Caramel and Gingerbread ice cream): A perfect balance of sweet, salty, tangy, creamy, and nutty. The hazelnut crust was buttery and had a great crunch from the toasted hazelnuts. It was layered w/ the cream cheese and tart apples. Surprisingly, the gingerbread ice cream went every well the dessert and added just a hint of spice.  *Buttermilk Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta w/ Balsamic Cherry Reduction and Cocoa Macaroon: OMFG! One of the BEST desserts I've ever tasted. The panna cotta was velvety smooth. The buttermilk gave it a slight tang w/o overpowering the vanilla bean flavor. The balsamic cherry reduction complemented the panna cotta perfectly; adding some sweet tartness. Oh, and you can't forget the cocoa macroon which was crispy on the outside, but nice and chewy in the middle.   *Red Velvet Cake w/ Cream Cheese Frosting, Coconut, and Mint Ice Cream: YUMMMMMMY! The BEST red velvet I've ever tasted. The cake was still warm and was airy and moist. The thick cream cheese frosting was rich and creamy, and the coconut added the perfect amount of sweetness to balance out the slight tartness from the frosting. The menu stated \"mint ice cream\", but it seems we got a vanilla ice cream instead. The ice cream was rich and creamy and also helped balance out the sweetness from the frosting.  SERVICE: Despite having to flag down the waiter several times (it was peak time afterall), he was very fast and friendly. He made it a point to ask before HH ended at 8PM if we wanted another round of drinks, so we can take advantage of the HH prices.   AMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: Intimate, comfy, hip and fun. There's a small lounge area in the front with sexy red velvet couches that allow for more intimate conversation. A bookshelf separates the lounge area from the tables in the back which is stocked with books and nostalgic childhood board games like Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, Sorry, Connect Four, and etc.   Hip-hop and R&amp;B music bumping in the background and hand painted Hip Hop murals (Missy Elliot, T.I., etc) w/ an Anime twist gives CB a funky sheek vibe.  *Sigh* If only there was a dancefloor...   PARKING: Street which can be very difficult in the NOPA area.  I can't wait to come back very soon....*AHEM*! LoL!",

Many of the cocktails we got were also delicious, some of the glasses were even rimmed with sugar! I can't remember everything else we ordered, but I was overall pleased.

I thought of Candybar but didn't say anything since I figured we wouldn't find parking anyways. Then its about 10 at night and we still weren't able to find anything to do so I mention this place. Loverman thinks its perfect, dessert for me and wine for him.   We call to make reservations for 10:45. He told me the people on the phone were really nice. I thought for sure we would take an hour to get there but it only took us 20 minutes. Haha. This is why I am never late. I always overestimate how long it will take to reach my destination. (That totally sounds like some therapy statement). It then took us another 20 minutes to find parking and a short walk in the drizzling rain after, we got there at exactly 10:45.   The place wasn't packed and there were a few tables open. Loverman asked the waiter if they had Prosecco and the waiter said they didn't. Then the waiter reads the drink menu himself (it was on the back of the menu and neither of us noticed there was a menu on the back) and then tells us they actually do have it. WTF. Your menu is so limited, how do you not know what you carry?   He orders a glass along with the Strawberry Lemonade dessert and I order the Apple a la Mode dessert. I totally see the two employees talking and looking over at us for a good five minutes but I didn't say anything. Later when I was talking to my loverman, he was all distracted and then he told me he was trying to figure out why the employees were behind me arguing about us. Who does that?  Extremely rude and unprofessional to be talking about your customers right in front of them.   The desserts were mouth watering except my dessert came with this weird chunky white cream and I looked at the menu and it wasn't listed as an ingredient so I have no idea what it was and it tasted really weird. It was not semen guys. Get your mind out of the gutter.   Also they served our desserts with the biggest spoons I've ever seen at a restaurant. They were like serving spoons. Who eats desserts with spoons that big?!??! I asked for a smaller spoon and the one I got was just barely smaller and then the waiter gave me another slightly smaller spoon.   Loved the ambience. I had a blast playing some 80's trivia game with my loverman. It felt like a fancier cafe experience which is always my favorite. Just being able to sit and talk and relax.   Amazing food + relaxing ambience does not a good restaurant make.   Negatives: Rude employees. Weird ingredients in their dessert. Giant serving spoons given as dessert spoons. No parking. Employees don't know what drinks they have.   I will be back. Possibly with my own spoon and I will be ignoring the employees as much as I can and just focus on their yummy desserts.",

They have boardgames galore so you can play while you eat/drink, although when we tried to play \"Sorry\" a lot of the pieces were missing so we couldn't play :(. \u00a0We ended up playing apples 2 apples instead.  I had the Strawberry kiss which was awesome. \u00a0The other drinks that we had in the group were also good. \u00a0Happy hour! $4 drinks!  We also had the Dessert Combo which was picking 4 of the desserts: - Peanut butter jelly time: OMG so good this one was the best. \u00a0It was basically an AWESOME peanut butter cup with jelly. \u00a0It was the big hit with the group - Strawberry Limeade - My favorite of the 4, it was like a small strawberry mousse with a graham cracker crust on the top with a lime kick. - Apple a la mode - It was a good small little apple pie type dessert, was was the least favorite of mine. - Japanese cheesecake - \u00a0Now I thought this was going to be awesome, until I realized it was the cheesecake you can buy for $1 that comes pre-packaged in the Japanese grocery store. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, it was still good but I knew what it really is....  The staff was friendly and the music was awesome. \u00a0I would definitely come again and highly recommend.  Good for groups.",

I got the Apple a la mode: the cheesecake was floury and pasty, the hazelnut crust was soft (!), the caramel was burnt, and the gingerbread ice cream overpowering. Yet I do have a real sweet tooth and I've never turned down a dessert before - NEVER. I tried my friend's dessert - strawberry limeade in a jar - but likewise it was not edible: the fruits were tart (could have sweetened them!) and the lime cream was so acidic! No balance whatsoever.   Bottom line is: these desserts completely miss the mark... Way overthought, noticeably unbalanced, and overall a BIG let down. Please get another pastry chef!",

The Ugly: I'm sorry to report, my darlings, that this is some terrible service. I'm not a needy patron (I've been a waitress, it's the worst), but almost every common complaint you could have, they met: uninterested seating, long wait for unfriendly/unhelpful/impatient waiter, brings one drink - desserts served - missing other person's drink until inquired about, incorrect check sent back twice, and on and on ...

I asked for a recommendation and got a fruity concoction that was the definition of meh. I left it 90% uneaten and got a chocolate cake. No flavor, no sweetness, no nothing. I tried my date's s'mores cake and it too was bready but lacking in flavor. The only thing I can compare it to is when I have had traditionally asian desserts that have such subtle flavors you might as well not call them dessert. Ok, if I'm going to have something with a ton of calories, a ton of fat and I'm going to have to go run for an hour the next day to make up for it, I want some flavor payoff.

From the dessert menu, we ordered the Tiramisu and the Flourless Chocolate Banana Torte--loved em' both! The presentation was beautiful, and the little extras (vanilla bean ice cream, nuts, dark chocolate, whipped cream, pineapples, etc) added to the decadence.   The cocktails were okay...they're all made with sparking wine, soju, or some combo of the two. I wasn't a fan of the mango bellini because it sounded great in theory, but the sparkling wine was an awkward mix with the sorbet. The lychee cocktail with the soju and sparkling wine was a winner though. They also serve other beverages including wine, beer, and non-alcoholic beverages.

    "review_text": "There's a new saying going around that 'great customer service is the new marketing.' It's the concept that the best marketing initiative you can invest in is simply providing superb customer service to your clients, whether you're a restaurateur or an auto mechanic. Makes sense, right? You treat someone well, then they tell their friends, then their friends tell their friends, and so on, culminating with a snowball of loyal followers. In my humble opinion, Candy Bar (in my only experience thus far) has totally nailed that theory.  Since my lady and I are new to the Western Addition/NOPA area, we've been trying to check out the different businesses in the 'hood. We've hit most of the bars, some of the restaurants, all of the liquor stores... and last night, we decided it was time to satisfy our sweet side with a trip to Candy Bar.  Right off the bat, the staff were totally friendly and accommodating, and there was a great vibe with people playing games, celebrating life with glasses of champagne, couples sharing beautiful looking desserts, and more. We were seated rather quickly, and our server was very helpful in answering questions about items on the menu and giving advice on which drinks would pair well with the dessert we chose (chocolate/raspberry cake with homemade ice cream). We were actually torn between the cake and the nachos (a creative take on actual nachos, but with avocado ice cream, shredded mango, kiwi, candied jalape\u00f1os and cinnamon chips), but we went with the cake.  To our surprise, after having a pretty lively debate over which dessert we were going to choose, our server ended up hooking us up with the nachos for free! How cool! Especially since we've never met this dude before. We were both pretty excited about this random act of kindness, and we hooked him up with a pretty sweet tip (no pun intended).   The desserts are small, but mighty. If you're trying to share a plate, you might be slightly disappointed. I'd probably suggest you save up and come in on a special occasion, order a handful of different confections, get some booze through your veins, and hang for a while. It has one of those coffee shop vibes to it where seemingly, you could chill there for hours on end and never feel rushed.",

Playing board games while drinking and eating is super fun, but it's a little hard to do with a small table for two. We got there a bit early when it was still empty, but as we left, it was filled with people.   We played some Connect Four (btw, I was beating my bf's butt) and got some dessert and drinks.  The peanut butter jelly time just reminded me of the song and I knew we had to try it. It was pretty good, but the tart was a little too hard to cut into. The flavor of peanut butter was pretty overwhelming, but the blackberry glaze and fresh blackberries were good. I think that was my favorite part.  The cupcake trio was something I definitely had to try. It was pretty decent for cupcakes, but I was not overwhelmed. The chocolate chocolate one was the best - it was nice and moist; the frosting which was a buttercream wasn't too much either. The red velvet, I thought was a bit dry, but I enjoyed the cream cheese frosting. The blueberry chocolate cupcake had a buttercream that was too buttery. I felt like my lips were coated in butter by finishing it. It was kind of gross to be honest. I couldn't even taste the blueberry flavors.  I got the strawberry kiss which was pretty good. I didn't enjoy it as much I think because I didn't want to drink since I had to do more work at night and didn't want to drink too much. The bf got 50/50 which tasted like orange cream soda and not like alcoholic drinks.   Overall, we had a great time and it wasn't too bad. $40 for 4 things. I wanted to try the tiramisu, but maybe next time. It was nice to do some \"date\" things with the bf again.",

Hey...assuming normal working hours, this is a reasonable \"late\" since we all had work the next day! \u00a0Giants game playing on the TV (point!). Parking in that area is terrible. Absolutely terrible. But what do you expect in that hood?  We decided a flight for the 3 of us. Our thinking was that even though it was $10 more to share for more than 2 people, it gave us 1 additional dessert, which was worth it. Then our waiter points out that we can order a $10 dessert, which means for the same price we can have 5 desserts. Umm...YES PLEASE.   Ice Cream Sandwich: Was pretty good, but very difficult to eat as an ice cream sandwich. Think of it just as half a macaroon with some ice cream on it. Open-faced sandwich, if you will. The honeydew ice cream was really good! If you like honeydew.  Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semifreddo: It was good, though there was a bit too much honey in the almond brittle. It became difficult for me to chew. Its a good option if you wanted dessert at an awkward date and didn't want to talk. Just keep chewing. Or, if your date asks \"did you just check out that guy/girl??\" Pop a brittle in your mouth and it gives you about 2 minutes of thinking time.  Apple Ala Mode: Overall pretty good. Had a good ginger taste to it, which is always nice.  Big Francesco's Tiramisu: I love coffee items. This was a decent hit for me, but it was a bit too soft.   Passion Fruit Chocolate Mousse: this was our additional one. I loved the passionfruit mousse, because it actually TASTED LIKE PASSIONFRUIT. You have no idea. I've been seeking this taste in the USA for the longest time. A lot of places will give you the aroma of passionfruit, but kill it with sweetness. Passionfruit is supposed to be sour! Just a bit of the sour bite to it! This delivered. Big time.  I also had a 50/50 cocktail, which reminded me of an alcoholic orange creamsicle. Awesome...and perfect.",

The creamy texture and flavors worked together nicely and you can tell everything was fresh. \u00a0However, it left me craving for more. \u00a0   The \"gourmet dessert\" concept doesn't really win me over, but I'd definitely come back for the scene and the drinks.",

Located in the Richmond district of San Francisco, the establishment is actually quite a nice setup. Its gotta nice lounge type vibe to it. We put our names on the list and were told to wait 10-15 minutes. So we did. ..and waited. ..and waited.  We inquired about the seating ...but apparently there was a group of ten that had \"reserved\" a spot but nowhere to be found. Fair enough ..we did not have a reservation. So we waited. ..and waited....and waited.  We inquired about the seating ..but the party of ten still had not arrived. At this point the party has been at least 30 minutes late. The host had attempted to contact the party..but response. So we thought...lets wait...and waited some more....  At this point it was pure frustration. We were told that we can sit in the reserved area and order..but if the party showed up ..we'd have to move. Move where ? There were no other spots open to sit.  One thing we did not understand is you have six customers wanting to spend money ....but would rather wait for ten..and hoping they will show up?  So we walked out with disappointment without ordering and wasting an hour hoping to get seated. I can recall the host said \"it'll be 10-15 minutes\" when we came in...Really ??  Sorry Candy Bar. Pretty lame...could have done a better job.  Thanks, -NP",

    "review_text": "I'd like to preface this review by stating that I loved Candybar even before I stepped foot in the place. How could you not love a bar that specializes in DESSERT, WINE and ART? Best of all, it's located in NoPa, two blocks away from my old house!  My aunt, sister and I headed to Candybar after Orson. (Yes, we are a family of piglets and indulged in several desserts that night). Candybar is a small, minimalist lounge with polished concrete floors, creamy white walls, pendant lighting fixtures and red velvet banquettes. The walls are covered in abstract paintings from a local artist and employee of Candybar, Nicholas Park. I thought his work was pretty cool. I posted some photos of Candybar and one of his paintings in my \"Local Photos\" section.   Two things to know before you go are:   1. Candybar is small and not the place to congregate if you're with a large group of people.  2. Reservations are a must. It gets packed in there!  Candybar has a great selection of savory and sweet desserts and each dessert is paired with fruit or chocolate. For example, you have the option of ordering a savory dessert with fruit (pork belly apple celery salad with peach sorbet), or a savory dessert with chocolate (organic poached egg chorizo with chocolate bread crumbs). \u00a0  We decided to order sweet desserts since we already had dinner at Orson. I ordered the most popular dessert, the vanilla brioche with spiced cherries and feta ice cream. My sister ordered the peach creamsicle with caramel popcorn and my aunt ordered the corn and blueberry fritter breton with blueberry sorbet. The vanilla brioche was phenomenal (although I didn't really care for the feta ice cream and spiced cherries); it reminded me of my Mom's tres leches cake with a caramelized sugar crust. The blueberry fritter breton was good, but came with a side of grapefruit that was super random and didn't mesh with the dessert at all. The peach creamsicle with caramel popcorn was even better than the vanilla brioche. The caramel corn was rich and buttery, the whipped cream was slightly sweet and airy, and the peaches were perfectly ripe and sweet. It is a nice play on textures. We also ordered three raspberry Bellinis that were excellent too.  The service was spectacular (our waiter was very attentive) and the owner spent 30 minutes at our table chatting with us. He absolutely adored my aunt. Just when we were about to explode from excessive food consumption, the owner brought us another dessert compliments of Candybar. He said he was very impressed with my aunt and why not celebrate her birthday with another dessert?! 5 desserts in one evening? You've got to be kidding me!!! He brought us the chocolate cannelloni chocolate olive creameux with vanilla bean ice cream, which is as equally divine as the peach creamsicle.   I love the concept and appreciate what the owners are trying to do. Candybar just needs to throw a dj in the mix and I'd be in heaven!!! DESSERT + WINE + ART + MUSIC = HEAVEN!  5 stars baby!",

For earlier dessert/drinks and smaller parties, I think just showing up would be fine.  We got the corner booth right in front of the window, so it felt nice and private and we had a clear view of the apartment across the street playing that new Kinect dance game - we must've turned around and watched and laughed on at least 3 separate occasions. But I digress...  For drinks, I had the jasmine sparkle and the strawberry kiss - definitely like the first one better. The strawberry was a little too sweet, and so the jasmine helped balance out all the already sweet desserts we were having too. I tried the 50/50 too, and it really does taste like an orange creamsicle! We also got a round of soju shots - I had the watermelon basil, which was interesting. Can't quite decide if I liked it or not. You could definitely taste the watermelon, and the basil added an almost spicy kick to it.  For dessert, we all shared the apple pie a la mode, carrot cake, peanut butter jelly time, chocolate financier cake, and Japanese cheesecake. I enjoyed all of them, and both the carrot cake and the cheesecake came with an ice cream/gelato on the side too. The PBJ really tasted like a PB&amp;J sandwich! I think the apple pie was my favorite - I had the lowest expectations for it, but it was so warm and comforting yet still cool and sweet.  I would definitely love to come back again to try more desserts and drinks and play some board games, either with a group of friends or for a chill date :)",

We were lucky to find a spot a couple of weekends ago though :)  The wait was extremely short...actually, I don't even think we even waited? (On a Saturday night too!) Got a table instantly. The atmosphere is super cozy and although the tables are really close to each other...I didn't mind it.   Game boards for you to play. My clumsy hands accidentally made a game fall on someone LOL. So if you're that person, I'm VERY sorry!!   I ordered the blueberry pomegranate champagne and tiramisu while he ordered some pb&amp;j dessert and...some drink I don't remember as well hahaha. I'm horrible at this. My drink was deeeeelicious. The tiramisu wasn't the best I had...I actually wish I could taste the rum, although I don't know if there was any inside (I'm not an alcoholic). So if there was....I hope they would add more next time so I can actually taste it!  Staff was very nice...although they accidentally gave us two bills.   Overall, great place to hang out, but the dessert didn't wow me :)",

The lounge is extremely cute and romantic! Nicely dimmed with candles and portrait decorated walls, the place completes the reputation its name hold.   Between us two girls, we shared the Apple a la Mode (my favorite), the Sweet Tart for my Sweetheart and Japanese cheesecake. Each plate was beautifully presented and tasted just as great as it looked.  The only bad thing about the place is the bathroom. There are no light besides candles. It was so dark in there, I had a hard time finding my way in there.   Parking was a pain in the butt too.",

For friends night out, everyone should get something different that way everyone can try more from the menu. The latest dessert I tried was the \"Drunken S'More,\" which consisted of gram cracker base, topped with toasted marshmallow covered with chocolate. Delicious! My friends had the \"Ice Cream Sundae,\" which was 3 brownie things as the base, 3 scoops of mint chocolate chip topped with pistachio macaroons, strawberry slices and banana covered with toasted sugar (I'm not sure if there's a real culinary term for that) sides. Also very delicious and fairly light. I had the Strawberry Kiss cocktail and my friends had the Mango Bellini and this coke with wine drank (don't know the name). \u00a0Definitely stop by and enjoy.",

I came by here w/ my bf this past week to kick back and nibble on some sweet treats in CandyBar's sleek lookin' space on a drizzly Friday night. We ended up sharing Cheesecake w/ blackberries &amp; Mango Sorbet as well as the Nacho Sundae, which included little cubes of mango, kiwi, papaya, and a hint of cilantro (the salsa) along w/ Horchata Ice Cream and a couple caramelized banana slices. I have to be honest, I wasn't too impressed w/ the desserts- they were good, but mega small portion-wise and unfortunately didn't have us raving about them post-dessert.  What I DID love about Candybar though, was its divine cocktail concoctions. I highly recommend their Blood Orange Bellini (sparkling wine, lavendar syrup, blood orange sorbet) and 50/50 (Soju, orange soda, vanilla). The bellini had such a wonderful blend of ingredients and the 50/50 tasted just like a Creamsicle on the rocks. Yum!  I was tickled by the selection of board games they had out- Connect 4, Chutes &amp; Ladders, Candyland (how fitting) and a few others I had never heard of. What a great place to relax and have a little fun! I highly recommend this place as a date spot!  The waitstaff was friendly and the atmosphere was just what we were looking for- a place where you could easily chat w/out shredding your vocal cords, a place that had a few cool pieces of art, and a cozy place to chill out at.  I'll be back for cocktails, especially since my faves are on their Happy Hour menu! (6-9 pm. I believe Tues-Fri, but I'd double check)",

    "review_text": "Tuesday was a different kind of high.  I came straight here from Creations Dessert because I had a Groupon and was in the area. Whatever, I can run around the hills afterwards to burn calories.  For a warm, Tuesday night, it was pretty empty at around 8. The inside is dark but a nice, cozy and romantic place, like the perfect place for a second date. It really lives up to it's name--sugar crackland. Everything in its menu is made up with some sort of fruit-berry--everything. You will not find mojitos or pina coladas on their drink menu, but try some orange soda with vanilla and soju or some fruity drink with sparkling wine. I got the Cherry Blossom Martini, which was okay, nothing to be excited over, a little bitter if anything. I also got the Ice Cream Sandwich, which isn't one, but 3 macarons with honeydew ice cream, The macarons were supposed to have almonds but I didn't see the slightest piece of almond in them.   The honeydew ice cream, however, was delish and was a nice treat. It looked very foamy, which was not appealing but it had a fresh honeydew aroma and it was sweet but in a delightful way. It was my first time having ice cream in macarons so I was not used to having to bite off macarons and ice cream at the same time. Not sure if the chocolate was necessary but if you're going to get this, prepare to get your hands dirty because it is a dish that requires one to get down and dirty. I had chocolate all over my hands as if my mom were feeding me fudge pudding in a baby eating chair--yeah, that kind of filthy.  Kevin was nice the whole way through and normally people frown at your vouchers but he was indifferent and checked on us occasionally. It is a little pricey and I'm glad I got a Groupon but a very nice, relaxing experience for socializing.",

    "review_text": "So imagine this, you're sitting at home on a relaxing evening, perhaps you just got home from work or a long day of studying in the law school library, and you feel like going out to a casual, relaxing place with a friend or special someone-- Candybar, nestled in Western Addition/NOPA neighborhood, is your place.   It's perfect because the little lounge can be a dressed up date night, or simply a place for an evening out with friends playing Battleship or Apples-to-Apples. The drinks and desserts are light and sweet, and perfect if you want a little something, but nothing too heavy. I've been to Candybar several times with friends, and went there on a girls' day with my mom and sister. I absolutely love the Mango Tango Bellini. They actually give you a lovely scoop of mango sorbet in the sparking wine. It's amazing! For dessert, I've tasted Apple la Mode, Strawberry Limeade, and the Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo. Candybar does an excellent job of mixing unique flavors like fresh cantaloupe, Nutella powder, gingerbread ice cream, and lots of other tasty tidbits for the modern palette.   However, there is a reason they only achieved 4 stars. They close at 10 Tuesday through Thursday, and are not open Mondays-- so plan accordingly. Also, they have a special where you can choose any four desserts except ones with an asterisk for $25, however be aware of this misleading bargain-- these 4 desserts are like little samples of the regular ones. Furthermore, one of the waitresses took our plate before we were even able to finish the dessert. When the desserts are this delicate, delicious, and expensive, taking a patron's plate prematurely comes across as disrespectful and impolite in every way. Hopefully this was just a slip-up on her part.   Nevertheless, what a special little dessert lounge. One that is sure to be an enjoyable and tasty experience.",

Drinks were on the sweeter side, no surprise, but were good. I would recommend the lemon drop shot.   The host was nice and their timing for seating was pretty accurate. I called to ask when our table was ready and as soon as we showed up we were seated before those who were there after us. I am glad to see they hold their tables and are fair.

Naturally we had already finished dinner by 5:15. It was time to get our cocktail and dessert pants on.   We have special pants for this type of finery.  The cocktails were the soju-style that the best of SF new cuisine places are relegated to. For those, however, they were lovingly crafted. Since it was only us two, and the two workers, a waiter/chef and the bartender, we chatted about the giants and drank his deliciousness.  The desserts that came out were pretty hard core. As environmentalists, we finished the entire things, but they were quite sizable for the gourmet style quality.   Jessica got a \"Strawberry Limeade,\" a cake and cream parfait thing served charmingly in a glass jar with a lid. It was super rich, super lime, super cream - clearly the lid on the jar was to prevent it from flying around the room and attacking the Salami and Cheese plate, the clear Lex Luthor on the menu.   I got a Tiramisu. Not since I'm boring, and not since I'm unadventurous, but I love seeing what super high quality dessert chefs do with the one dessert item that can class up an indie pizza joint like Rat Snark Slices. Yeah, look THAT up on yelp.  The Tiramisu was really good. Super creamy, at the top end of sweet without going over the edge, it was like a beautiful sugary trip to the grand canyon of vistas, sweet coffee/chocolate flavors, and mixed metaphors. It had this coffee crumble dusted and clumped attractively around it, that was ... savory? salty? It set off the creamy, intricate sweetness of the tiramisu in a way that I can't describe - even inaptly - yet can still taste the next day, sitting here in my office.   If they could steal a dozen bottles of top shelf 80 proof stuff, then this would be the 5 star dessert destination in the entire city.",

Parking is difficult (as expected) and the wait takes quite awhile (as expected). \u00a0  The ambiance is fun and bubbly, girly but not overdone. \u00a0The couch, low coffee table, and Connect 4 felt like an incredibly fancy living room. \u00a0Bring the desserts and drinks, and I'm like a little kid at a playdate, with a wholly adult facade.  Drinks are very pricey (~$10 for a small cocktail in a champagne glass) and tasty but not spectacular. \u00a0The champagne based ones are mostly high-end mimosas made with fancier juices. \u00a0  Desserts are not top-notch designer status, but they are pretty good. \u00a0Essentially, they are artsy renditions of your fond childhood favorites, playing along with the identity crisis theme. \u00a0Portions are surprisingly generous; I'd recommend sharing one dessert among ~3 people, unless you are ravenously and drunkenly starving. \u00a0  (+++) Apple Ala Mode (hazelnut crust, cream cheese filling, caramel, gingerbread ice cream), $9: I'm not a huge fan of apple pie, but I got this because all the other ingredients sounded delicious. \u00a0The crust is good enough to be a dessert in itself, and the gingerbread ice cream could easily have found itself into a cone at Bi-rite. \u00a0Despite the cream cheese and caramel, it wasn't all too horrifyingly sweet or creamy.  (++) Big Francesco's Tiramisu (coffee chiffon, chocolate and rum mascarpone cream, coffee bits, chocolate), $10: Being one of those snobs who makes tiramisu myself, of course I brag that this isn't as good as my own secret recipe. \u00a0Seriously though, it's good but could definitely use more rum and was a bit too dense. \u00a0The piece is one ginormous slab though, and will surely satisfy any tiramisu cravings.  (+) Peanut Butter Jelly Time! (chocolate tart, peanut butter cream, salted candied peanuts, blackberries), $9: Yes, exclamation point necessary! \u00a0I've never quite seen such a nice-looking dessert based on the quintessential brown bag lunch. \u00a0It's ingenious in concept and blows up your expectations; in reality, peanut butter and jelly can only go so far. \u00a0While it was tasty, it was in the inferior league of desserts and wasn't extremely memorable.   Service was not as attentive at times, but it was good. \u00a0Brownie points for the good-looking servers.",

Their portions are good enuff for sharing and they have a tasting menu for those who want to try it all!!  My favorite was the ice cream sandwich. For some reason I thought the ice cream would be vanilla but it was chocolate. I think vanilla would be a better choice though to balance the nice fudginess of the chocolate macaroons. One of the best macaroons I've had, but prolly not a true macaroon since it was crispy on the outside but brownie-like on the inside. Blueberries on the side were a nice touch!  Tiramisu was also good, light overall, and good coffee taste. On the side were some chocolate crumble infused with coffee crumbs.  The PBJ tart was a delight. It really tasted like a pbj sandwich. The random pieces of salted peanuts were a nice surprise!   Carrot was also nice, pretty moist and light. The frosting was not overwhelming at all, like some places do it.  I'm not the biggest fan of apple desserts, I always feel like they're too sweet. But the apple a la mode was not! I liked how the apple slices were thin and not all mushy and soaked in sauce. And it came with yummy ice cream!   Parking's tough in the area, and there seems to be quite a wait. Ambience is nice, they have board games which makes it feel like a nice night in, only that you're out. Wish they had a liquor license though, it was only wines, beers and wine cocktails.",

It is one of those type of places you MUST check out at least once in your life time, but as for me I will come here often!  Before planing a trip here, please come here early to find parking space because it is near residential area and nearly impossible to find parking.",

At first I felt bad for this little bar that couldn't (or so I thought) since it was mostly empty when we passed by. However it seems to be picking up steam and \u00a0I have seen more and more people here.   Why I like it:  You don't have to wait at the bar to get a drink here. They bring it to you. The Happy Hour deals are good with $2 Pacifico and $5 sparkling cocktails (get the raspberry one). 821's sparkling cocktails are $3 during HH, but here you get way more alcohol since the flutes are bigger and filled to the brim and Happy Hour is a couple hours longer.  I had the Pumpkin Seed Cake and it was great. I highly recommend. The bathroom here is awesome. The atmosphere is awesome. It's dead on some nights but a perfect place to go if you want to hang out with friends or catch up.",

    "review_text": "This hip dessert bar has a super cute concept which draws in the 20-30 something crowd. This is great since we don't have too many of these in the area, but bad because there is an average of at least 1 hour wait. Its location is both a blessing and a curse as there are other cool bars and restaurants in the vicinity which you can hit up while you wait for a table here but parking is extremely ridiculous.  Passion Fruit Delight: Light, bubbly, and delicious but nothing I had to wait an hour in line for or couldn't buy at BevMo or Safeway. Looking at the menu again, guess I should've seen it was just passionfruit syrup they added. Well, I would've seen it if it weren't so dark up in there!  50/50: This one was much more creative and tasted exactly like an orange creamsicle! Creamy and frothy with the soju smoothly creeping in... oh so dangerous if you were to have more than just one! This got me swaying to the R. Kelly track that was bumping in the restaurant... oh heeeey!  Chocolate Espresso Pudding: this one spoke out to me because of the red velvet cake and maple bacon pecan crunch. I LOVE bacon and it sounded totally adventurous but I really hated how the espresso pudding killed all other flavors in this. It was so overpowering, I didn't taste any maple, bacon or pecan. I found myself trying to scoop up more cake with the pudding to balance out the extreme bitterness but there wasn't enough cake. Total disappointment.  Big Francesco's Tiramisu: while the espresso pudding had too much bitterness, this tiramisu lacked any. It was sweet like milk chocolate and had no remnants of the bitter coffee that was supposedly in it.   I really hope my 2nd visit will allow me to add back a star or two!",

The concept reminds me of an Asian dessert place: drinks (cocktails instead of bubble tea), desserts, complete with board games and coffee table books, great for hanging out. I love the atmosphere, but maybe not all the artworks on the walls tho.  As for the dessert, the presentation is always great but I enjoyed some more than others:  The passion fruit chocolate mousse was rich, not super chocolatey, which overall worked well. I would have loved a little more passion fruit curd.  Chocolate raspberry brownie is tasty altho seems a bit standard and small for the price. Same goes to the flourless chocolate cake and I wasn't keen on the banana yogurt (personal preference).  I normally love macaron but the green tea shells for the ice cream sandwich was a bit too sweet. The rice tea ice cream offered a bit balance to the sweetness.  The panna cotta is my favourite: first of all, great portion, generously topped with quartered bing cherries. The flavour is just right, creamy and balanced. I wish I didn't have to ration the balsamic cherry reduction.  Even tho I hardly drink, the cocktails are all delicious (based what I tasted from friends' order) and the happy hour is a great deal.  Service was great. With reservation, a large group of us were seated promptly. Small group had to wait so I'd advice going a bit early to get a table and take advantage of the happy hour.",

I did get a chance to talk to somebody who works there, and it seems like they did draw Finale as a reference when they opened up the place. Woot :)  It's not quite the same, Finale is more like traditional dessert comfort food, with a modern style presentation, whereas this place just have modern fusion-style desserts. Also, Candy Bar is a lounge, which means comfy couches, low lights, and a great place to hang out.  I still love Finale's selection, but this is definitely very promising and I'll come back again just to try the ever changing dessert menu. I'm glad to see that so many other people also love the place as much as I do!  One note though: parking around the area is definitely a tad bit shady.

I'm not really one to go off much about the ambiance or decor of a bar/restaurant, but this place looks straight up cheesy and cheap, which is a huge juxtaposition to the semi-expensive, yet tiny desserts.   My date and I split 4 desserts--no we are not gluttons, the portions are small... one might even call them miniscule--and we chose the Japanese cheesecake (this was ok), some kind of flourless chocolate cake (surprisingly flavorless for a chocolate dessert), the lavender honey craime fraiche (did not like this at all....) and the ice cream sandwich (this one was pretty damn good). \u00a0So out of 4 desserts I tried, I enjoyed 1.5 of them... not such a great ratio. These were honestly some of the most underwhelming desserts I've eaten in recent memory. We also each had an $11 glass of non-remarkable malbec (for him) and pinot noir (for me). Definitely not impressed with either of those.  On the other hand, the service was fine. No complaints there.  Good idea for a bar, but given the price tag they need to step it up a notch (or several). It was ok to check out once but I doubt I'll go here again.",

Food: They featured a wide selection of specialty and creative desserts. I opted for their version of the sundae, which was delicious, and very different. The portion initially looked small, but it was quite filling when I finished it all. I would also recommend possibly getting a few options and then splitting them in order to sample the menu better. They also have a wide selection of cocktails and beverages that were very unique.   Service: The service was generally pretty good, as I have no complaints to make. Since this is more of a place to come to hang out and eat dessert while hanging out with your friends, I didn't expect people to come by asking if I needed anything very often.   Atmosphere: I think the ambiance of this place was my favorite part. It was cozy and had a very intimate, lounge-like feel to it, which I really enjoyed. It's a perfect setting for catching up with friends, while enjoying some tasty treats. I also liked the selection of board games that they had for you to play, which made the night very fun and entertaining.   Before coming, I would also recommend checking out some of the groupon deals that may be available. We bought one that saved us a ton of money!",

The panna cotta was a little lack luster but I guess it is panna cotta so it's going to be pretty light. The passion fruit was tasty (but very sweet so watch out if you're not into sweet drinks) and I tried my date's strawberry kiss which was also good.  The second time I came here we split the strawberry limeade which was excellent. Still light, but much tastier and more interesting than the panna cotta. I had the blood orange cocktail which was really good.  I'm giving it 4 stars because the strawberry limeade was really good, the happy hour drink specials are nice (and the happy hour actually lasts long enough for me to go after work!) and the service is friendly/helpful and honest. A bit pricey though, but if you're making a whole outing out of dessert and drinks, this is a good place.",

Pretty much champagne with a frozen strawberry  Half red wine and coke (Forgot the name): Sounded interesting so I thought we should be brave and tried it. Tasted like flat coke + red wine.

Tiramisu - was nice and light  Buttermilk Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta - was ok but was too strong on the blasamic.  and macarons!

(I make a good mascot with my genuine knack for cheesy rhymes)   Whenever Master [Ultimate Food Connoisseur] introduces me to yet another amazing, hitherto be discovered establishment, I get suspicious and wonder if I'm date #67 and Master is a skilled merchant of trade, wowing women of all shapes and sizes with his vast knowledge of SF's greatest eateries. LOL, with that said, this is a great place to set trap, I mean o___O impress someone.  The setting is very romantic almost purely purveying to couples, think candle light so dim you can't see. This isn't for Friday night with 5 'homeboys' and if you go with 5 girls you're gonna wish you went w/ your boyfriend, or wish you had one to go with here... :p  It's very red velvet inside and no I don't mean it's made of red velvet cake, I mean the furnishings are red velvet and the walls are mahogany and sandalwood, your only options are wine, coffee and some world class confectionary art ranging from ordinary, to highly unusual [i.e. caramel popcorn and cake? ?]  I'm mildly indignant by all these other reviews that describe these creations I didn't even see on the menu. At my time there (late late evening), the menu was one page and there was only five things to choose from [Blueberry cheesecake w/ graham cracker crust, traditional chocolate lovers, vanilla with yellow cake, pear ice cream with cake] I sampled all of them and Master and I agreed the Red Velvet was the only piece of decadence, the other desserts could be perfected in the privacy of your own home with the help of Betty Crocker..... and the portions were modest and gone in 4 bites [MELTED INCREDIBLY FAST, WITHIN SECONDS OF WAITER SETTING PLATES DOWN] for 10 bucks, and the cocktails cost as much as the dessert and gone twice as fasts, making gluttony inevitable leading to a quick decline in your funds resulting in their profits rising exponentially LOL   I'll take the steep prices for the nice setting, friendly service and the awesome shelf of books and extensive collection of board games they have. Overall delightful place, very unique and worth a shot at least once. Bring $50! 3 desserts 2 cocktails, you can stomach the sample like portions, provided your wallet can stomach the bill.

FINE.\"  Luckily, we were wearing respectable jackets, or blazers, if you will -- anything else in a place like Candybar &amp; you'd feel under dressed. It wasn't as wholly unpleasant as I expected it to be.

However, it's more of a dessert focused restaurant that showcases a bar (with only sparkling wines, wines, ports and beers-no cocktails or shots) and not an ACTUAL bar you can walk up to and order drinks from.   The service was fantastic. I emailed in advance to make reservations, so when we showed up, BAM there was our table.   The desserts were fantastic! The Tin Roof Sunday was a hit with our group (actually I think almost every pair split one of those). The carrot cake looked really yummy as well as the chocolate parfait.

    "review_text": "Aroused by my prevailing appetite for dessert, I came back for my second visit to Candybar. We came here on a Saturday after 9:30 pm, as a party of 4. By 10:00 pm, there were more patrons and seating became limited. Though the actual taste of the dessert is not momentous, I must express my admiration for the venue's trendy ambiance. Sexy spot for a date! Candy bar is a dessert lounge with an imaginative and fun menu. They also serve wine and cocktails that compliment the desserts. FYI ladies and gents, there's even beer!   DRINKS  We started with Negro Modelos for the dudes and Blood Orange Cocktails for the girls. The Blood Orange Cocktail, made with sparkling wine, blood orange bitters, and a sugar cube, was crisp and exhilarating. Tickling my tongue, the sparkling wine's naughty bubbles were enchanting, and the incorporated sugar cube did not make the cocktail too sugary. Also, the cocktail cleansed our palates between dessert bites, and elevated our dessert experience by eliminating contending flavors. Proceed with caution though: this one's a creeper! ;)   DESSERT  For the dessert sampler ($25.00), we selected the Red Velvet Cake, the Apple Ala Mode, the Lavender Honey Cr\u00e8me Fraiche Semifreddo, and the Big Francesco''s Tiraimsu. You select four desserts from the menu, except for the desserts with the asterisks *. The sampler is made for two, but pay an additional $10.00, if you would like to share it with additional people. The overall harmonious presentation of the dessert sampler plate was simple and balanced, which allowed for ultimate accessibility to each individual dessert.  BREAKDOWN   Red Velvet Cake ($9.00 when ordered b itself): NOT love at first bite. An utter disappointment. The composition of the cake was regrettably dense, not airy and silky, as it ought to be. We were practically eating a brownie. The red velvet flavor was virtually absent, as I did not taste any cocoa. \u00a0The 'vanilla cream cheese' frosting did not showcase the tangy flavor of cream cheese. \u00a0I also did not understand the function of the toasted marshmallow with this cake--the marshmallow did not symphonize with the red velvet.   Lavender Cr\u00e8me Fraiche Semifreddo: ($9.00 when ordered by itself): My favorite from the sampler. It was light and decadent. I rejoiced in the fresh pieces of firm cantaloupe and the distinctive texture of the crumbly nutella powder, which paired sublimely with the cr\u00e8me fraiche. 'Semifreddo' means half cold, so the cr\u00e8me fraiche had the texture of a frozen mousse (half ice cream and half whipped cream). I also indulged in the crunchy almond brittle on the side. I would order this dessert again, by itself, from here.   Apple Ala Mode ($9.00 when ordered by itself): The grainy hazelnut crust and the caramelized apples complimented by the milky texture of the gingerbread ice cream. \u00a0The dessert was supposed to have a cream cheese filling, but the cream cheese flavor was understated. Nothing remarkable.   Big Francesco's Tiramisu ($10.00 when ordered by itself): The rum mascarpone cream was not rich and creamy as it ought to be, and it did not impart the rum flavor that I was anticipating. The dessert overall was still tasty and chocolaty, but it did not leave me yearning for more.   MEH - Mediocre flavors, buuut quite noteworthy and amusing textures. Bring your date before 10 pm for the chill vibe, sensual dim lighting, the eccentric wall art pieces, AAND BOARD GAMES!",

I had a glass of \u00a02006 Braida Vigna Senza Nome Moscato D'asti. A very small glass about half the size of a champagne flute. For $11. Now I'm not above paying that for a glass of sparkling wine, but a 750ml bottle of this costs $13. That's one hell of a mark up.  The one big benefit is that I now have a nice long list of bottles to buy for myself to keep at home... probably for pennies on the dollar compared to what they want for them.  The desserts were quite good and I especially liked the little mini milk chocolate and cookie at the end of the tasting menu. I scraped my plate getting the last bit of sweetness off. I would have licked it if no one was looking. :)  One thing that was cute was they had a couple board games. Someone was playing with the connect four game next to us. Actually I'm not entirely sure they were playing it. I saw them assemble it at least. :) I can't imagine playing a full game of scrabble there though.

Then I got \"cheesecake\" it was like a smear of cream cheese with some tatsty bits on top. eh, not to much a fan, but it was food all the same.  My friend got some chocolate business that rocker her world.  Then out waiter brought out some tasty as malted milk and a tiny cookie... which was BOMB! Who knew that milk and cookies could be so naughty delicious.  The setting was crazy romantic... great sexy mood lighting, lounge seating, games, books, like sitting in a fancy person's living room. A fancy person \u00a0who's trying to seduce you.   The staff are really friendly and awesome... which is rare in such haughty places.",

They might have been going for a laid back, romantic vibe but it was just very...suffocating.  Service was quick and efficient for our group of 6. It took me a while to choose a dessert, out of the 10 or so options, because nothing sounded that appealing. I finally settled on the drunken s'mores, and ended up avoiding all the chocolate tart (which was 90% of the dessert...I ordered a s'mores, not a chocolate tart!) - it was tooth achingly sweet and dense. Combined with all the slightly \"drunken\" chocolate fudge on top, I don't say this often, but there was too-much-chocolate! Maybe if they called this a \"double chocolate tart drowning in chocolate fudge,\" people would be more prepared for it, instead of expecting something resembling s'mores. They didn't attempt very hard at making it a s'mores with the cold, solid marshmallow on top...--- a cold, unmelted, solid marshmallow!! Ugh! Do you even understand s'mores??  Aside from that I tried the \"apple pie a la mode\"...which was like 60% cream cheese. Well I'm glad I finally got to try some (disappointing) desserts at Candybar, time to not come back! I'm sure the desserts are probably better if you're in the mood for them and the happy hour/alcoholic beverages might be good? Another good thing is that servings are big (1 dessert is probably enough for 2 people, unless it's the ice cream macaron sandwich).",

These people really know their stuff and the waitresses will find you tasty-times pairings to go deliciously with your dessert.  Don't go here if you don't have a sweet tooth. The majority of the wines are dessert wines. It is called Candybar, so have some common sense, you know?  Some people listed some issues with the service, my experience with the service was fabulous, but I'm not sure how much it varies, since I've only been there once. It was a Friday/Saturday when I went. The place is crazy small, but it didn't take us long to scope out a seat.   My major beef was that parking which was ridiculous. I would recommend taking a cab.  Overall, I think they need to step up their game on the dessert menu too, since that is the focus of the place. I didn't think the brioche was that fierce. My friend had a desert that was like a flourless white cake. I can't remember what it was called, but that one was the best out of our group of four.

After finishing lunch late in the afternoon, we decided that we would head over to Candybar after they opened at 6pm to try out their desserts.  Thinking that getting there before 6pm, I thought parking would not be an issue. \u00a0The Panhandle area is densely populated with multi-unit buildings and with restaurants and bars in the area, parking was quite challenging. \u00a0After about 30 minutes, finally scored on a space about five blocks away.   We walked in at 6:30pm and were the first patrons of the night and had our choice of tables. Checking out the menu we started out with some \"happy hour\" sangrias. \u00a0Happy hour is 6-8pm every night with $2 Pacificos, $3 Sangrias and $4 sparkling cocktails.   After confirming some desserts on the menu with our waiter, we ordered: Ice Cream Sandwich - Almond Parisian macaroon, chocolate ganache, fresh melon and honeydew ice cream. Beautiful presentation. \u00a0A refreshing, lighter dessert with the cubes of honey melon. \u00a0Nice for those that don't like super sweet desserts.

    "review_text": "yes, this is a review based on management/service rather than actually partaking of the drinks and desserts.   as lots of people apparently do, i forgot about my groupon until the last few days it was valid. so i and a friend showed up on the last day, 8/22, a bit more than an hour before candybar closed (my friend wasn't free till that time). there was quite a line, and we were told we may or may not get a table. long story short, we waited the entire hour, only to be told that they weren't seating anymore--just when our names were coming up on the list. (since several people hadn't even been served yet, this was not a question of us ending up staying far later than others and causing lots of inconvenience that way.)  the host said we could come back and use the amount i paid for the groupon ($17), but we would not be allowed to use the full value (two cocktails and two desserts, about twice that). since we had arrived when the groupon was still valid, but were turned away because of capacity, i asked \"are you sure?\" and he said, \"yes, there's nothing i can do.\"  waiting all that time and not getting seated wasn't exactly fun, but sometimes you draw the short end of the straw, and i wouldn't cast aspersions for that. given the mayhem in there, and that they were essentially giving all those customers 2-for-1, i do think the host doing the seating and the bartender i was watching mantained good composure (second star for that). my negative review comes from what i felt was poor handling of the situation. if someone comes to your restaurant in time to use a promotion, and not being able to use it is beyond that customer's control, it is sound managerial/business practice--and only fair--to provide an extension of X number of days (even the next day would have been fine).   the point of groupons is to try to build future business through good will and word of mouth. candybar failed in that regard, and i'm not sure whether or not i'll be back at all.",

So when I saw a Living Social deal for $17 for 2 desserts and 2 cocktails, I had no excuse not to.  First off the ambiance is super cute. Especially for a date night. They have a bunch of games you can play while waiting for your dessert or even while having dessert. Just keep in mind the tables are small, so playing a board game or anything that takes up too much room might be hard with 2 desserts on the table. We played a couple games of Connect Four. I loved that game when I was little so it was a great way to relive a little bit of my childhood while having dessert.  On to the drinks. I'm not a huge fan or super sweet girlie drinks so I tried to stay away from ordering anything to sweet. The Mango tango bellini and Cherry blossom martini were both nice and light and given they were frou frou girlie drinks, not to sweet.  Now the desserts. The tiramisu was huge! This is definitely worth the price if you're looking for quantity. But I found the tiramisu to be overly sweet and chocolately and not much else. Not enough coffee or rum flavor. The flourless chocolate banana torte was the most disappointing. I was craving a banana dessert and really, there was no banana to be found. I probably should have checked the pix on yelp of this dessert, but I was really disappointed by the chocolate banana torte. Was wishing I had ordered something else.  I'm glad I gave Candybar a shot, but I probably won't be back unless I have another deal. I don't think the desserts and drinks were worth $36 altogether. But if you're looking for a cute place to take a date, I'd definitely recommend Candybar.",

We ordered two Dessert Samplers, in which each of the sampler, you get to have 4 desserts on the menu, excluding the ones with a dot/star next to it. So, technically, we tried 8 desserts total: Peanut Butter Jelly Time, Strawberry Lime, Soft Cheesecake, Candy Bar Hot Chocolate, Big Francesco's Tiramisu, Apple a la Mode, Honey Creme Fraiche, and Ice Cream Sundae.   There were 5 of us, and usually with the Dessert Sampler, if you have more than 2 people ordering, then it's $10 more on top of the 25$. Not too bad I guess considering the fact that we got to try majority of the desserts on the menu.  I would say my favorite ones out of all of these would be the Tiramisu, Strawberry Lime and the ice cream inside the sundae. Their desserts are pretty sweet for those who have sweeth tooth like me. I guess it's also because we were eating 8 desserts at once so that could be the case as well. Desserts were gorgeous so I give 'em props for presentation.   I've also tried their Peach Martini, and my other friends ordered the Lychee Martini, as well as Mango Tango. The Peach Martini was a bit stronger than the Lychee one, but it was very good! Haha, girly drinks for sure!   Overall, I love the atmosphere and decor here. It's definitely a more girly, date type of environment even though personally, I wouldn't go on dates here especially at night, it's way too dark here....(O.O, shit I want to see my date's face, not go on a blind --literally -- date), and us girls went a little crazy with the pictures, but the struggle was real since there were not much light for the pictures. BUT nevertheless, I like this place a lot. I finally get to try it after a whole year of trying to go, and it was worth it!   P.S. Parking is a pain in the A.S.S. Just be patient. #goodluck.",

Feels like a lounge, but funnier, because you can read or play boardgames. It is a great place for two people or larger groups to chat and socialize.  Ontop of this environment, you can order fun drinks and fun desserts.   PASSION FRUIT DELIGHT: It is a bubbly, but I didn't taste too much passion fruit. But when I ate it with the desserts, it was delicious.  MANGO TANGO BELLINI: I like this. I like how they put a ball of mango sorbet into the bubble. The sorbet was delicious and the sweetness blended with the sparking wine deliciously. A very girly drink, but I liked it.  ICE CREAM SANDWICH: Chocolate Macaroon Sandwhich with blueberry ice cream. I loved it. I can't wait to go back for this one. The chocolate macaroon was perfect. One of the best I had. And I really liked it with the blue berry ice cream. Creative and tasty. I totally recommend this if they have it on the menu. TIRAMISU: It was good, but not as good as the ice cream sandwich. Tasty and good size. I didn't like that the top was thin chocolate sheet cause it made it hard to eat with my spoon. It didn't cut apart when I used my spoon. Maybe I should ask for a fork next time.   This place is cute. Other than having difficulty finding parking. I can't wait to try happy hour next time. Should be fun because the place is so comfortable.",

The pseudo sugar highs (+'s): + Dessert for Two option for $25 on the menu lets you pick four desserts. My party of three girls found this to be the perfect solution to satisfy everyone's needs. + Reception was amiable and pleasant. + Atmosphere was nice. Everyone crowds around their low tables of dessert and drinks which are lit dimly by candlelight. Feels warm and intimate. + Big Francesco's Tiramisu infused with coffee chiffon and coffee nibs--yeah i took several bites beyond my share. Nice and not heavy. + Smore concoction was pretty decent. Don't think I'd go out of my way to seek it like Bi-Rite ice cream.  The sugar crashes (-'s): - Yeah parking sucks. Period. - Expect 30-40\" waits on a Saturday night. This place is crazy popular but note not open on Sunday. RSVPs NOT taken. - Desserts didn't wow us. Let's start with the Ice Cream Sandwich of macarons and honeydew ice cream. The macaron--was hard. It shouldn't be. - Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semifreddo--yeah well lavender tastes like soap to begin with so to truly mask the association the balance of sweet and fragrance has to be just so. It wasn't so. - Flourless Chocolate Banana Torte. Ok this is pretty standard. Almost every eatery offers a chocolate torte. That means this dessert is not so inventive and pretty staple. That said, it was not that interesting and I think Trader Joe's has something similar.  TIP: Get there early to avoid the crowd. Prepare to hunt for street parking.  Overall I want to love this place because the concept of desserts and drinks are winsome but afraid the pastries just don't do it. They just don't have that cronut effect where people stand in line starting at 4am to get one. And they are not inventive or addictive enough to make me hunt for a parking spot AND wait in line to get that sugar high.",

Wine and nothing but dessert???? I MEAN COME ON. It's a \"dessert lounge\" even the name seems positively decadent!  They had a lot of really innovative things on the menu like a dessert soup and thyme ice cream. The only thing I felt was lacking was a little simplicity. Give me some milk and cookies, yo! It doesn't always have to be frothy or poached or blanched or whatever.  Another major plus for Candybar? The board games. All kinds of games. Yes, even Uno. And we love us some games!  Both the host and server were very friendly, and welcomed us in after a long Saturday at the beach. They had just opened and it was virtually empty so I can't speak to the crowd here, but I enjoyed the space a great deal since we were able to co-opt a huge booth and take over.  PS Candybar, I fully intend to have my birthday party there this year so i'll see you in July. I heart candy.",

Also the desserts are somewhat small, so sharing goes quickly with small portions.  I was looking forward to a great wine and dessert wine list..strike two. \u00a0For starters the champagne list is filled with several names that I was not very familiar with. \u00a0Candy Bar is the sort of place that will attract dates and groups of girls for a night out, so having a champagne brand like Veuve Clicquot or Chandon would be a good idea to help increase sales. Brands that are well know tend to sell well. The list of wines was okay but I was hoping for some great Sonoma pinots but no such luck. They have a few decent ports but again the list isn't great.  Again, I like the Candy Bar concept but they are missing the mark. \u00a0I will give it \u00a0another try, hopefully by that time they make some changes in the menu offering. \u00a0And if I'm really lucky some better seating options.  And remember...The candyman can cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good...maybe Candy Bar will figure this out",

Oh well, I plan on going soon, but until then here's the scoop from Daily Candy:  You'll never know, but Candybar is exactly what it claims to be: a new bite-size dessert and wine bar in the Western Addition opening softly tonight and to the public on Sunday.  Pastry chef Jake Godby's (Fifth Floor, Coi) four-course tasting menu sends you to the Milky Way with organic, house-made options -- chocolate brioche with balsamic caramel ice cream and spiced yogurt, perfect milk and cookies. Sate savory cravings with nibbles like roasted potatoes with hazelnut romesco.  The menu pairs with wines; microbrews; Blue Bottle coffee; or a boozy-sweet concoction of sherry, Carnegie Porter, and vanilla ice cream. Indie tunes, emerging artist displays, and board games make for serious playtime.",

In San Francisco, Candybar really is one-of-a-kind.  When Candybar first opened, it had a dessert tasting menu. You sampled four very tiny dessert courses for only $13. It was a brilliant and innovative idea; unfortunately, apparently people didn't understand the concept of a dessert tasting menu and would buy one and share it between several people. Ah, Philistines.   But even without the tasting menu, this place is great. The pastry chef seems to have a taste for the creative. The baked hot chocolate with homemade marshmallows (one of the more traditional choices) was amazing--it's like a chocolate lava cake, but just the gooey center, which is, of course, the best part. My friend had the salted buttermilk panna cotta with olive oil, which was also good. Presentation is elegant, as well.  The space itself is nice--cozy and sophisticated. And the bathroom is clean and attractive. I can be kind of prissy, so that stuff is important to me.",

They also had board games which is totally genius.  I LOVE THE APPLE A LA MODE!! Best damn thing ever. I wish I had the recipe but it's warm and very rich. My friends ordered the strawberry something and mousse which wasn't that good.  Second time I went was with a date and we had fun playing more board games but i ordered the raspberry brownie with mint ice cream which was suggested to me but I didn't really like it. The mint ice cream was straight up mint. I know, duh, mint but it was weird. We also had the peanut butter and jelly and that was okay. i wasn't satisfied so I ordered the apple thing again!  Overall, the vibe and environment is a totally cute place to take a date t night. It's warm and dim lights. I guess depending on your taste the desserts are a hit and miss.

Side story to go along with the review is that I used to live right up the street from this place, which had only been open for maybe a couple of months at the point when I moved. In those two short months, however, notice I did that the address here is1335 Fulton, and my old house's address was 1553 Fulton! When I met the owner Tan at Yelp's Project One event, I told him this, and I joked that he may be getting some of my old mail by mistake. Ha. Ha.  Well, even if I'm the only one who finds this inverted-version-of-my-old-address-is-Candybar's-\u00adaddress idea amusing, at least it enabled Tan to remember me when I showed up here last night for a post-dinner snack. It's always nice when people remember you! Add to that a nice, helpful wait staff and a loungey, intimate interior (there's something unique and sexy about the lighting) and you may very well feel as if you're chillin' in your supercool neighbor's living room.  My date and I shared the chocolate brioche with vanilla ice cream and strawberries. It had a crispy, creme brulee-like outside and a moist, substantial inside which was filling and decadent in a conventional way. But it was our second surprise dessert (thanks Tan!) that won the favorite award of the night: lavender ice cream and blackberries served on a white chocolate wafer. So simple, yet the flavors were different and delicious. Judging from these and the little bites served at Project One, I'd say Candybar's got some really smart and creative dessert chefs in tow!  Ah, Candybar. If I needed a reason to move back to NOPA, you'd probably be it.",

Summary: Excellent experience. Expensive.  Details:  Many things were exceptional - decor, ambiance, music, service, quality of the product - I applaud the innovative concept &amp; skillful execution in getting this off the ground!  ...but I gotta take down a star for one of my top pet peeves: tiny tiny portions. Coupled with an expensive wine list with just a couple of choices under $10, and I'm spending $20-30 for dessert &amp; drinks...no can do as a regular habit.  I want to come here regularly after dinner &amp; share desserts with friends, have a drink, and keep it under $20 per person after it's all said and done. This is hard if not impossible to do with the pricing &amp; portions here. The warm vanilla cake, while sublime, was hard to share even between 2 people - you just feel a little ridiculous sharing something smaller than a hostess cupcake on a plate. For $8 a pop, I think the desserts should be comfortably sharable among two people, 2 dishes for 3 people, etc. \u00a0I pray for you to consider 1) pricing your desserts to $5-6 each, or 2) making them bigger. I'm not sure how this affects the supply/demand/revenue scenario, but I think you can strike a balance, and it looked like you'll be getting your take through the healthy beverage offerings.  Speaking of... can you offer a couple more moderately priced wine choices? If I'm coming here after dinner, I've already spent a good amount on food &amp; wine. I know your ambiance deserves a premium, but please help me keep the financial pain within a reasonable threshold.",

    "review_text": "In my opinion xmas lights in wine bars don't mix, either does bad old school hip hop music, in a lounge setting where everyone is sitting around playing board games. Is anyone else confused?  We were a party of 10 seated in front in a reserved area since we made reservations, though at 9pm on a Friday night it wasn't very crowded.   It took at least 30 minutes for someone to come over and take our drink orders. The waiter, who was also the host, was a dude dressed in shorts and a plaid shirt who looked miserable and annoyed being there. I asked him for a NON-sweet cocktail option and he suggested the Jasmine champagne. Turns out, definitely the most sweet option on the menu, after sampling some friends drinks. It was so sweet and syrupy I couldn't even drink it. I finally got his attention and asked if I could get a glass of perseco, he said sure and then came back with the drink 30 minutes later when everyone was ready to leave. I told him we were about ready to go and he told me I could down it pretty fast. Thanks dude, I love chugging sparkling wine.   Speaking of wine, you'd expect a \"wine\" bar to have more than 5 options of red and 5 of white and have a waiter that is more knowledgeable about the drinks, not a guy that looks like he just spent the day drinking at Dolores Park.   I'll also mentioned that the desserts took about 30 minutes to come out when we ordered 2 for the table. I can't comment on them because I didn't try them.  Overall I don't see any positives about this place unfortunately.",

And this place has some pretty amazing desserts. Not only are they delicious, but they are perfectly proportioned and presented so beautifully that I let myself splurge a little and go out to the City just for Candybar (probably 2-3 times a year). The sparkling wine cocktails are delicious as well. I usually go with two of my good friends, and we sample each other's orders. Their dessert list changes, but there are always fantastic options available. I suggest going here with a small group, maybe a little early because it can get packed! In a group, you can sample multiple desserts and cocktails and not feel like you just consumed all of Willy Wonka's \u00a0factory.  There are also a bunch of board and card games available for you and your friends to play! I really enjoy this place, even if it is very dimly lit and a little pricey.  Hint: Both Living Social and Groupon regularly have deals for Candybar!",

At ~$8 a pop, I would've rather had Cheesecake Factory.  There were 6-ish options... one paired green tea cake with thyme ice cream. Another included peanut butter, curry and cucumber altogether. Yet another included parsnips. I already ate my veggies, thank you.  Service was fine, music was good, and I liked the availability of board games... but seriously. The options looked bleak on paper, and failed to impress once we actually tasted them.  I would possibly be a fan of this place if it were in, say, Little Rock, Arkansas (with prices to match the market); but here in San Francisco -- I feel like I wasted a dessert :( !!

You may burst out laughing when you see the three cookie and 2 fluid ounces of mil you get with the milk and cookies (for $6). Don't say I didn't warn you.

If you drive, park on Fell St. and take a stroll. -Intimate place to catch up and/or go on a date.  -If you want to try more desserts, order the \"Candy Bar Dessert for Two.\" -What I've had, and will continue to get: Soft cheesecake and Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo -Other things to try: Peanut Butter Jelly Time!, Ice Cream Sandwich - Drinks: Mango Tango Bellini, yum  **************  Let's start with the negatives. This is beyond Candy Bar's control, but finding parking here is a pain in the butt. I remember turning over to the driver and saying, \"We are never coming here again. ever!! even though the desserts are good.\" I wasn't even hungry, but driving around in circles sucked. However, we found a SOLUTION. Don't look within a one block radius unless you plan on getting really lucky. We found tons of parking on Fell St leading up to Golden Gate Park, which is only a four block walk from Candy Bar, so no biggie, right? Plus, you'll probably be walking down Divisadero St and will see some fun restaurants you might want to check out in the future. The walk is not bad at all.   Most reviews highlight the board games, but I've never played any. There's chatter all around you, and it's a dimly light place, so perfect for talking with your party over desserts and cocktails.  There are so many desserts on the menu that you'll want to try, but of course, at the price of $10/dessert, you can't afford too many. So, I recommend getting the \"Candy Bar Dessert for Two.\" I think there's a fee if you share with more than one person. Anyway, it was the perfect amount. Four desserts for $25, which is typically the price you'd pay if you bought four separate desserts anywhere else. However, some desserts are not included in this deal :/ like the soft cheesecake. :(((  Soft Cheesecake: A great combo of shortbread, pecans, sweet pink grapefruit leche, Rice Krispy crunch, passion fruit sorbet.  Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo: almond brittle, nutella, and cantaloupe - we get this every time  Ice Cream Sandwich - honeydew sorbet was great, packed between macaron shells  Peanut Butter Jelly Time! - yummy salted candied peanuts added perfect crunch to the peanut butter cream  Tiramisu - it's good, but my least fav compared to the originality of the other desserts  Service is on par, in other words, they do their job: fill up your water cup, take your order, ask if everything is going well. I do want to highlight, though, that I once came in with an expired Groupon (and as you know, those still retain the purchased value), but they still gave us a complimentary soft cheesecake! WAHH! I think it might be because I mentioned I wanted that, but it didn't come in the \"Dessert for Two\" option. Now, that's accommodating service!  I'll be back. Just gotta park a few blocks away to avoid an unnecessary temper tantrum xP",

There was a wait outside and they told us it would only be a 20 minute wait so we decided to take a walk for a bit. When we got back 15-20 min later, the hostess said she already called our name :( So she put us back on the list and we waited maybe 20-30 min longer.   The seating is a little awkward here since the tables and seats are pretty low. The tables aren't that big either sooo it is kinda difficult to play a big board game and eat at the same time. We just played \"Would You Rather?\" while we waited for our food and drinks.   DESSERT: I got the Ice Cream Sundae which comes with macarons, brownies, strawberry sherbert, strawberries and bananas. The brownies were really yummy which is surprising since I don't really like brownies. The macarons were disappointing though :( I didn't like the texture since they were a bit too crunchy/hard.   My bf got the Peanut Butter Jelly Time and OMG. This was DELICIOUS. I wish I got this instead hahaha! I wouldn't have minded us both getting it, it was that good! The chocolate tart and peanut butter cream tasted soooooo good together. It was a perfect combo of salty and sweet. The blackberries and peanuts topped it off perfectly too :)  DRANKS: I got the Strawberry Kiss which has sparkling wine, ginger ale, and frozen strawberry. It was reallly tasty. Definitely didn't taste like alcohol at all loll and I barely got buzzed off it. But it was cute! And there was a strawberry in there :)  My bf got the Blueberry Pomegranate Soju and it was also yummy but I liked my drink more haha :D  Overall, I really like the concept of the place.

If I had been served the same size dessert after a nice dinner, that would have been fine. We went sort of hungry, saving room at dinner for the desserts, and we were greatly disappointed. The flavors of the chocolate currant cake we tried were good, but it was tiny! And there was a fruit salad with a lavender ice cream that was not that great.... When you are going out specifically for dessert, I'd appreciate it being a satisfying experience, instead of feeling like you have to order two, therefore spending $19 just on the desserts before drinks. I guess I also thought perhaps they might be candy inspired, but nope.  The game selection was a little weak. Plus, people would take multiples to their tables leaving none for other tables. Sure it is fun playing games of your childhood with friends, but when there are no directions or missing pieces.... your enthusiasm for the games quickly dwindles.   3 stars because our chocolate cake was good. Otherwise, it would have been two. I'd rather eat dinner at a restaurant and just spend my $ on drinks, I guess. I really wanted to like this place more than I did.",

My favorite was the tiramisu.  Games: not a huge variety, mostly candyland, chutes and ladders and card games.   Jasmine sparkle: sweet but not too sweet. i was trying to pair it with the lemon tart but really, i just love champagne.",

This would be a great date place if the volume was low enough to have conversation. \u00a0But maybe that also makes it perfect for a date because they have to LEAN IN CLOSER for conversation. \u00a0Score, lol.",

It is dessert and wine, with some bubbles too.   The menu is very small and very focused. There were seven or so desserts to choose from and about 8 types of wine by the glass and a couple champagnes by the glass. Including a rose. Very nice. I think it may have been a proseco, either way it was very good.   As i chose a dark chocolate something with sugared cranberries and a Meyer lemon granita, I had a nice hearty Zin. I love chocolate and zin.   My lil sugar had the baked hot chocolate. My favorite choice of the night. It was simply amazing. He wasn't too fond of the homemade marshmallow but i sure was!   My BFF had the Cayenne Cinnamon Mouse. Wow. Different and oh so good. We had a couple bites that were crazy spicy and sweet. I like the mix of sweet and savory, it was really good.   Still, the baked hot chocolate was amazing, chocolate souffle esque cake under a thick measure of dense hot cocoa and a dollop of thick creamy homemade marshmallow! Yum   Its a very cool spot and we walked right in on a Saturday night about 10:30 or so.   Its a cool look and a polished finish yet they have boardgames you can play and it has a total neighborhood feel. Its off the beaten path and not readily visible unless you are on the missin to find it.   But do find it! Have some hot chocolate and play some games with your mates, its what life is all about!",

Too much Miley Cirus over the radio. \u00a0I digress. \u00a0Whatever it was, I was ready to have a good time.  My friends and I got there at 10PM on a Saturday night. \u00a0Be forewarned though. \u00a0The parking around here is known to be atrocious. \u00a0Just read all the countless reviews about that. \u00a0I had to circle the place for a good 30 minutes before I found a decent spot nearby. \u00a0  Once we got in, there was a little more waiting. \u00a0It took about 15 minutes before we got a table to sit down. \u00a0While waiting I got a chance to peruse the dessert menu so I knew what I wanted when I got seated.  Peanut Butter Jelly Time! - $9 *Chocolate Tart/Peanut Butter Cream/Salted Caramel Peanuts/Blackberries *This was super tasty and I tasted like I was eating a giant Reese's Peanut Butter Cup with fruit. *The Salted Caramel Peanuts were a good mix of crunchy and sweet. *The Chocolate Tart crust was delectable too. \u00a0It was like a chocolate cookie.  I enjoyed my dessert and played a fun game of Sorry! with my friends. \u00a0They offer a wide range of games to play so you definitely won't get bored here.  Check this place out. Your eyes will be opened to a new experience visually, audibly, and tastefully.  Quick Tip: If you can, make a reservation before coming. \u00a0It tends to get packed on Friday or Saturday night and people like to hang around and talk after they finish their desserts or drinks.  == A MUST TRY! ==",

I'm not much of a late dinner kinda gal, but it really worked out. We stopped by Candybar for some pre-dinner drinks. The happy hour seems pretty good. Unfortunately, we missed it before we even left, and we're never usually in the area around those hours. Darn :/   I tried the Blood Orange Cocktail and Toast had the Frozen Strawberry Cocktail. Both drinks were very yummy and kinda girly. The atmosphere is very candlelit red glowy romantical. Totally a date place. Since we had some time to kill before dinner, we also tried the Raspberry Cocktail. Also very delicious and sweet. There are boardgames and fun stuff like Connect 4, Battleship, and Uno.  I definitely want to come back and try the desserts! They look soo good. 10pm reservations = more time for teh drinking. WIN",

This is a unique spot in the city with a total girls-night-out or let's-prolong-our-date-a-bit vibe. The menu has a good selection of different desserts and champagne-based cocktails as well as your traditional beers or wines by the glass. (There's also a cheese plate option for when your brain explodes from the sugar rush.)  We split the flourless banana torte and the peanut butter jelly time. I was a huge fan of the banana torte - yummy, not overwhelmed by banana like that fruit often tends to do. I'm the hugest fan of PB&amp;J sandwiches, but I was less of a fan of that one. The girls at the table next to us insisted we order this one, and it was decent but if/when I come back I'll try something else.  Cocktails: strawberry kiss and red wine sangria, both recommended.  Plus one star for the amazing selection of board games. If I can eat chocolate while kicking my friend's/date's ass at Connect Four, it's a winner in my book.  Happy Hour is 6-8 and has $3 champagne. I will be making it out to that at some point.  Minus one star for not letting us change the ice cream flavor on the ice cream sundae. I really wanted a sundae, but strawberry is not my thing. Let me order it with vanilla and I'll give you that elusive fifth star, candybar.",

My fav is Strawberry Kiss, its not too sweet or bitter.   You don't want to spend another chill night at Starbucks! Candybar is a great alternative from the regular coffee shop down the street. They have cards, board games and etc to keep you entertain.  You dot like desserts! If you don't really like desserts but willing to hang out with your friends then you might not like the concept and the prices.

Strawberry Limeade strawberry mousse, vanilla cake, calamansi cream, strawberries - This was my favorite. It came in a small glass jar with the cut strawberries on top.

But once I saw the menu, I saw the words CALAMANSI in one of the desserts and i was like, wait WHAT?! Obviously there had to be some Filipinos working up in here because no one puts calamansi in their dishes otherwise. And if they do, they call it kumquat or something. We ordered the Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo and the Strawberry Limeade. Initially, I thought I was going to like the lavender one better, but the Strawberry Limeade (which had the calamansi cream) was just uber delicious. It took a long time for us to figure out what it tasted like, but we finally figured it out. It tastes like a damn STARBURST. A starburst in dessert form, omg are you kidding me?

Took us a few rounds til we got lucky and got a parking a block away. The place was packed but we got seated within 5 minutes which was nice. It's pretty loud inside and can get warm fast, the spot is on the smaller side and is very dim.. cute for dates. We had two different drinks, I forget which ones now but both had champagne in it and I noticed a lot of the drinks did. We had the ice cream sundae which had macarons under the ice cream. Sooo good! and we also had the tiramisu which was delicious as well. Can't wait to go back and try the other desserts! Yum!",

A side note, if you guys like a place being super dark and that includes the bathroom, you'll love this place lol. \u00a0I had to hold the menu to my face like I lost my glasses just to read it, they do provide a candle on your table for 'reading by candlelight' :) \u00a0I did a lot of squinting, and wondering if my vision would be affected after this experience but I did figure out what I wanted to order eventually! \u00a0   Last thing, first night had a male waiter, exceptional service! \u00a0Second night, a girl in a ponytail that might need to work on her customer service skills a bit! :)",

The only way that dessert could be made better was to include more of each ingredient! \u00a0On a Sunday night, the ambiance was chill and welcoming. My only critique is that the lighting was a bit dim, and the music a bit techno-y. \u00a0It would've been nice for there to be softer lighting and some Carla Bruni playing in the background on a Sunday night. \u00a0  Candybar is perfect for large groups, and even accommodated a four-legged friend. \u00a0The NOPA area has been yearning for a place like this, and I am glad that such businesses are moving into the area.",

    "review_text": "Have you ever felt so comfortable in a place that you completely lost the passing of time? That happens when everything is about perfect and you reach a state of flow - halfway between the gutter and the stars as FatBoy Slim once put it - great company - excellent food - unobtrusive and yet attentive staff - irresistible beats at the right volume - maybe it's raining outside and you can hear the drops in the background, another layer of an hypnotizing, groovy soundtrack - \u00a0you feel both melancholic and content at the same time - feeling nostalgic for something that you are still living that very moment.   You might experience something like this at Candybar, a place that tries to combine wine, art, and desserts - I can't possibly think of a better trifecta - and does it terribly well. Achievement unlocked, as the gamer geeks would say.  Although the tables are very close to each other, Candybar can still provide a unique, cozy, intimate experience. I had brunch here and it was love at the first bite. I mean, where else can you taste Basil Yogurt with organic granola? A vanilla toast that speaks perfect French?   Coffee is excellent, the wine list is extensive, desserts are ace. The dishes are so funky that you feel compelled to preserve them under a glass. Contemplation as the ultimate form of consumption. Here, \"art\" is delivered on a plate. Chocolate coffee, wine: my three favorite drugs at an affordable price. It's all very decadent. I think I saw Marie Antoinette sitting at a table eating a cake today.   In short, Candybar is dangerously addictive. Elegant but not pretentious. Classy but not arrogant. Stylish but not overdone. Less is more. Scandinavian decor (not IKEA). Candybar is the new black. \u00a0Ideal if you are longing for a lounge.   If I had to compare this place to a tune I would pick something from Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister. Or Tosca. Yeah, Candybar is track #5 from \"Delhi 9\". The one featuring Earl Zinger.",

    "review_text": "3-stars...   With just a few kinks to work out, Candybar is a stylishly elegant new wine and dessert \"bar\" over on *that* side of town **points in NoPA's direction**.  In the name of keeping things on the sunnier side, I'll give you the goodies first. Rather, I'll call it as I saw it and let you be the judge.  The host (owner?) showed us to our cute table near the back of the small space, and was really cool to have created a dessert &amp; wine pairing menu just for us! Nice touch!  We opted to start with some of the (few) savory options. Fortunately, they'd given us the head's up, and we'd grabbed a little nibble down the road. \u00a0For the table, we shared duck liver mousse with crostini and a blood orange marmalade coulis, scallop ceviche, delicately garnished with slivers of avocado and kumquats, and a country-style pate with currents. All delicious. All teeny-tiny. All perfect with my frizzante of pinot noir!  For the next course, we went for some dessert pairings. I opted for the chocolate brioche with caramel ice cream. My BF decided on the chocolate parfait -- deconstructed and served as a chocolate shingle, garnished with whipped cream. Both were lovely and really tasty. And teeny-tiny.   Per the paring menu, my brioche was to be paired with a red tojaki... no idea what it was, so I asked. Was it like tocai fruliano? Was it a dessert wine? Was it a fortified wine? I was intrigued. Apparently, our server wasn't as she had no idea what it was, and when she returned all she had to offer was that it was a dessert wine, sweet and a bit spicy. Uh, 'kay.   Let me stop for a minute and mention some expectations I tend to have at \u00a0non-inexpensive, super cute, shiny-new wine bars. I know, I know. Expectations in any relationship are a sure-fire set up for disappointment, but hear me out on this one. All I want is a good product and a knowledgeable wait staff. And if the server is unsure (totally valid... OK, even! especially in a newer place) I expect someone who *is* in the know to come by and tell me all about it. It's wine. There's always a story behind it as well as a good reason why it was chosen to be eaten with certain stuff. Now back to business...  I got the honey-colored tokaji, it was sweet, it was spicy... it wasn't necessarily my favorite with the brioche (the pinot noir I'd ordered shortly before was better) but it was really good, and I totally enjoyed it.   Here's another side note that I don't think my dining companions got: when the server came by after placing an order for everyone-but-my 2nd round, I told her that I would be having the same thing my friend to the right was having. She said, \"the frizzante?\" I said, \"No. The pinot noir.\" Panicked look, she rushed off. When she came back to the table, any mistake that was in the works had been corrected and we all got exactly what we'd requested.   Again. New place. New staff. Workin' out the kinks. We had a lovely time and will gladly go back. I'm sure that in time, the staff will rise to the occasion soon enough and all will be worthy of 4, maybe 5 stars. Until then, this has been my story and I'm stickin' to it!  p.s. Tokaji is Tokay... Hungary's sweet white wine made from grapes infected with botrytis mold that creates the honey-like color and richness. Yum!",

It's a little bit pricey, but anything you get at Candybar, I swear, is as much a meal as you'd get anywhere else.

There's something alluring about all those tiny bites and slender glasses mixed in with a mess of boardgames. It's a fun, light, almost too-cool spot for a date, a friend date, or even a hangout with your mom. No, really. All kinds of people come to Candybar, and for good reason.  There's pudding with crumbled bacon and red velvet cake, some kind of sorbet-like pie situation with chopped bits of nectarine; more basic options, and cute, fruity or tangy, distinctly colored cocktails that even the toughest dude or lady would enjoy.

I'm rating the prices a 3 out of 5 because it wasn't completely overpriced, but not cheap either. Expect to pay $6-8 per drink. Selection: The selection was killer. They have sparkling wines with strawberries, orange or raspberries and much more. I'm not a huge fan of sweet drinks, and this hit the spot. It wasn't too sickly sweet and not too biter. Service: Service was a bit slow, but not too bad.  I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing evening out with a few girlfriends!!

    "review_text": "I love the concept of Candybar. Desserts, drinks, and a hip lounge. Sounds perfect, right?  Eh, not exactly.  I'll start with what I do like. The atmosphere is a trendy and modern lounge-like style, with soft dim lights, (real) candles, sofas in the corner, and a red romantic interior. They also have cool art decorations on the wall and various board games available (Connect 4, Magic 8 Ball, Monopoly, Apples to Apples, etc). Perfect for a romantic night out!  The drinks are unique and tasty. The mango tango bellini (sparkling wine, mango syrup/sorbet) is a great fruity drink with sugar sprinkled on the top of the glass. Yum!  Now let's move on to the desserts...  Desserts: Lemon &amp; White Chocolate cake/mousse with sorbet -- Sorbet was too sour. Red Velvet Cake -- Cake was too mushy and a bit tasteless. I expected rich red velvet and cream cheese flavors. Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semifreddo -- Unremarkable. Disappointing, actually. Tasted like it's been left out for a while. The cantaloupe was hard and didn't taste fresh.  Overall, Candybar is great for only the vibe and the drinks, but the desserts itself are rather disappointing. Yes they look pretty and extravagant, but I've had better at much smaller less well-known cafes. If you're paying $9-10 for a slice of cake, you'd expect it to be at least mediocre, right?  Get the Groupon that is $20 for 2 cocktails and 2 desserts! Definitely worth it!",

I would love to go back for the savory dishes and there was mention of possibly brunch in candybar's future. \u00a0Can't wait!",

    "review_text": "One word to describe this place: OVERRATED! I first heard about this place a while back on the Food Network. I came here with two of my friends and we had high expectations. It was pretty busy and we had to wait a bit for a table. We had a mission coming here and that was to order dessert, eat, and then leave. There were a lot of young people our age hanging out, drinking, and playing board games which I thought was nice.   For the desserts, we each ordered our own and decided to sample each others'. I ordered the peanut butter jelly time and my friends each got apple a la mode and Japanese cheesecake. I'm a dessert snob. My friends aren't and they can be easily pleased with just about any dessert. I only liked the guava sorbet from the Japanese cheesecake since I go crazy for guava anything! My peanut butter jelly time was good, but it was too thick and rich for me. My favorite was the apple a la mode. They were all good, but I don't think they were worth what we paid for them. It's all hype. All for aesthetics and fancy presentation, but I was not wowed. These were not \"to die for, OMG I have to have it, craving it every day and can't stop thinking about it\" desserts!",

I asked the waiter to explain the beer foam and brown sage ice cream aspect of the dessert. It was nothing special. The beer foam was exactly that--beer foam to fancy up the plate. The brown sage ice cream was nothing incredibly special. The cake was dry. Boo.  My friend ordered the cheesecake which she really enjoyed. The kiwi made it a bit sour, but upon removing those pesky things, it tasted mych better. We also ordered some of their sparkling wine, which wasn't bad. All in all, the food was mediocre for the price they charged. Would I return? Yes, if I'm in the neighborhood and friends are looking for a place to hang out.",

They even have boardgames: connect four, candyland, and scrabble to name a few, simple fun.  Candybar has an extensive wine/beer list. My friend who knows the owner says they don't serve hard alcohol because this would take away from their overall theme. Besides, would you really enjoy a savory meal/dessert with a cocktail? Our group didn't order any entrees- we opted for desserts and drinks. My recs: (1) Warm Vanilla Cake (2) Baked Alaska. Yummmm.  The staff is friendly, the crowd is older but not pretentious or hipster and overall I felt good vibes. If going in a group 4+, I'd recommend making reservations, but this could easily be somewhere to bring a date as well.   True to its name, it's a sweet place. I'd go again.",

So of course I had really high expectations of this place.   Right as we walked in, my friends and I were overwhelmed with the smell of chlorine (or something similar). It was almost sickening how strong it was and definitely didn't help with our appetites.   We were luckily seated right away even though it was a Saturday night (yay!). My friends and I weren't that hungry since it was post-dinner so we decided to just get some drinks and share a dessert. I ordered the mango tango bellini and wasn't really impressed with it. It didn't taste very mango-ey to me. My friend ordered the lychee guava martini and she liked it. We tried the panna cotta and it was good. It came out so nicely decorated and very aesthetically pleasing! They definitely deserve 5 stars on appealing to the eyes.   I think I would come back to try some of the other desserts because many of them sounded really good but we were just too full to order anything. I think I would pass on the drinks though.",

You'll probably get a deconstructed s'more, maybe some foam, and a pretty plateful.  Looks-wise, this place is hopping. \u00a0The desserts are pretty, the drinks are shiny, and the decor is hip. \u00a0This is great for date night, just friends going out (they have games!), but beware that the line might be lengthy and people might stay long.  Taste-wise, I enjoyed the desserts and drinks we had, but I felt a little sugared out afterwards. Sweet drinks + sweet desserts = give me something salty! \u00a0I liked the experience...I'm glad I had it...but I'm just not sure it's worth a return trip.  Flourless Chocolate Banana Torte: \u00a0Good. \u00a0Personally, I would have liked it better without the banana flavoring or the peanuts, but I understand the comfort food inspiration.  Drunken S'mores: \u00a0Good. \u00a0Deconstructed: choco tart with graham cracker crust, alcohol'd choco sauce, and a large toasted marshmallow. \u00a0Again, it's interesting and I get the comfort food inspiration, but I'm just not incredibly impressed with the result.

Its flavor was consistence. I would say the macaroon did the best job for the entire plate. Happy with it for now. :)   Definitely, the coffee that I ordered was not that good: bland or is it because it's decaf?  The alcohol drink is much much sweeter and yet not too over kill.   Overall, this place is hip and romantic to hang out as group/date. Another thing is that the wait can be forever ! expect at least 40 min or more. We went on a Tuesday's night and at dinner time too and yet still have to stand to wait. Maybe, they need to have chairs and less board games for some pple to hang out way too long yet others to wait. That's just my two-cents.",

Service here is nice though =) and patient.. doesn't rush you even if there's some people waiting outside, which is nice.  Drinks: In my opinion, the drinks are too damn sweet ESPECIALLY if you're going to eat dessert with it..... next time if I do come, skipping the drinks (just got it cuz of the Groupon deal) They were good but just too sweet. I am a girl that dilutes my juice though, so take that to heart, haha. Drinks were pretty decently priced.  Dessert: Yum! Same cost for dessert if you compare it to if you also get a dessert as a nice restaurant (meaning still pretty pricey for me!) They were good and reasonable for what you get, cuz what I got was pretty damn good.  Apple pie: AHH heavenlyyyyyyyy. That is all. Cheesecake: It was pretty good too. I like the concept of the deconstructed mango cheesecake - mango sorbet on the side, cream cheese sandwiched between 2 lady fingers, and then rice krispies and some type of buttery granola on the side. =]",

Pretty good intimate dessert place with plenty of nice quirky things from the light bulb dangling lights at the bar to the wonderful artistic paintings on the wall.

Parking can get kind of hectic at night especially on weekends.   While this place does serve alcoholic beverages, definitely go for the desserts. My choice - Candy bar Dessert for two - ($25) which gives you a choice of 4 desserts excluding ones with an asterisk. Still good for the money considering each dessert ranges from $8-10.

    "review_text": "Edit - I recently got in a grump with this place for the experience described below. I still think my comments stand but since I've now had the chance to actually visit it's only fair I update my review!  Great date atmosphere - It's cosy and warm and hits the right spot between informal and stylish. We intended to maybe try at least two desserts each but the portions were surprisingly generous (rightly so, for the prices) - not humungous, but I was expecting teeny tiny tasting desserts - and with the sugary drinks we only tried two desserts between us. I had the APPLE A LA MODE which hit ALL my buttons - caramel, cream cheese, apple, hazelnuts. The gingerbread ice cream was perhaps a little too cinnamony for my taste but that's just personal preference. Plus it wasn't a pie with dry pastry (not my favourite) but with some kind of buttery brioche or something. Loved it. My o/h had the lemon meringuey pie which was also great. The only thing I'd definitely avoid next time is the triple chocolate bellini - white wine and chocolate don't mix, and it brought back horrible memories of this gross Christmas chocolate/red wine drink I tried to foist on all my nearest and dearest a few Christmases ago. Apart from that, the drinks were great.  Would go back if I was in the neighbourhood and maybe try the cheese/charcuterie plate and another dessert. Board games are a good idea as you can't really knock back pretty cocktails and desserts the same way you would beer &amp; pretzels in a pub, so the games add to the fun atmosphere.  You can only make reservations for groups of 6 or more, but there was enough room for us to drop by on a Saturday evening.  -- original comments: --  We had planned our evening around finally getting to enjoy the Groupon for this place - looking forward to an excuse to celebrate with some tasty desserts and drinks - but we were curtly turned away at the door because of some problem with the kitchen. We had taken a while to travel to Candybar on public transport which was detouring all over the place, so I explained that it had been a hassle to get there, but no, they weren't accepting any orders for the rest of the evening.  Such a *huuuuge letdown*. People were in there enjoying drinks, and I don't see how a kitchen problem would prevent us from having a glass of wine. We wasted an hour and a quarter of our precious Sunday evening, and a couple of bus fares, riding around on the bus for no reason, and weren't even offered a discount for future use or anything at all.  But the thing that makes me really angry is: there was NO MENTION of this on their website, which I had checked before leaving. Their twitter and facebook haven't been updated in over a month. A company's internet presence is ideal for precisely these kind of situations - communicating quickly to your customers.  I am not particularly inclined to go back to a company that clearly cares so little about their customers who go out of their way to support local businesses, but since we have paid for the Groupon, we have to or lose out even further!",

The wine wasn't so good, but that could have just been our luck of the draw.  The desserts were okay, nothing better than you can get in the grocery store and the portions were too large. Half the price for half the portion would have been appreciated. The s'mores were too boozey. Both were also really too sweet for my taste.  Service was okay. The host was the waiter on the Thursday night we went. Rather than showing us to the table, he pointed us in a direction to sit down, but then didn't like the table we tried to sit at. He explained that they would get busy later and he didn't want us to sit there.  The ambiance couldn't decide what it was - dark and jazzy, but too cool to comfortable sit for a while. Strange for a place that offers board games. The tables were really too small to host a game. However, there was a couch area in the front.  Overall, we won't go back - we were pretty disappointed.",

We came here after dinner at Tacolicious (see my review on that too!) for a UCLA college reunion with a few friends  we ordered and shared....  Flourless Chocolate cake: the BEST dessert of the night  Japanese Cheesecake: BAD BAD BAD. only because we expected it to be like a regular cheesecake but it was like eating pound cake. I like poundcake, but I ordered cheesecake. way too doughy to be a cheesecake.  Apple a la mode. it was good but nothing special  Strawberry LImeade: it was very tart and even though it was a little too tart for my own taste, my spoon kept digging into it either from deliciousness or guilt for wasting dessert. either way, it was a pretty good dessert  Grade: B. I really liked the concept of this place and the chocolate cake and strawberry limeade were good but the other two desserts especially the cheesecake was blah. I'll come back here to give it another try sometime later down the road",

After looking at the pics on yelp, I decided to purchase their groupon which was $36 for four desserts and four drinks. CL got the red velvet, I got the ice cream sundae, J got the ice cream sandwich and S got the chocolate banana cake. For drinks, I had the guava lychee soju along with S, CL got the peach soju and J got an italian cream soda. Everything was fusion style. The one server was super busy and did not seem all that happy. Anyhow, this is not a place for all american desserts. If you like sweet fruity desserts, then this is the place for you. The soju drinks took awhile to hit me but once it hit me I couldn't stop laughing at everything. Wasn't too happy that we got taxed for the $36 groupon. Anyway, probably won't be back.",

Better late than never (\"but never late is better...\" Sorry...I'm letting pop artists, this time Drake, infiltrate my reviews again. I'll stop now.)  Candybar is absolutely lovely. Lights that are low, booths that are super comfy &amp; games (like Battleship &amp; Chutes &amp; Ladders) to bring you back to your childhood...if you were allowed to drink alcohol &amp; consume fancy desserts in your childhood.  I tried two desserts: -- Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo (almond brittle, nutella powder, cantaloupe $8): great texture, like a creamy, more frozen gelato. -- Passion Fruit Chocolate Mousse (chocolate cake, tuile, passion fruit curd, vanilla bean ice cream $10): you can't go wrong with passionfruit &amp; chocolate.  Playful flavor combinations that look that works of art.  Perfect setting for a larger crowd seeking after-dinner drinks, dessert &amp; a place to catch up for a few hours.",

    "review_text": "After 2 times at Candybar, I've had 2 very different experiences.  The first time I went was probably about 6 months ago, and they had these incredible \"Dessert Nachos\" on the menu (Please bring those back! They were amazing!!!). My friend ordered the spongecake, and while the plating was beautiful, it definitely lacked flavor. The service was above par, and we had some delicious sparkling wine cocktails. That experience rated around 4.5-5 stars.  My second (and most recent) experience was about a week ago. I brought my boyfriend here for his first time... We settled in and grabbed the board game \"Battleship\"... it was my first time playing it. I love that they provide different board games to stir in a little competition. Nothing completes a date like a dose of healthy competition!!! This time we ordered the chocolate butterscotch brownie, which was so-so (let's just say it didn't compare with the dessert nachos from my last visit here). We ordered a beer and a champagne cocktail as well, and those were fine. The main problem with this visit was the amount of time our entire visit took. After finishing our dessert and first round of drinks it took about 20 minutes to flag down a server to order more. When we finally got a server's attention we decided to try 2 spicy micheladas. These were TERRIBLE!!! I think they may have gone a little too heavy on the tabasco sauce, but they were un-drinkable. We tried to down them but ended up having to send them back (and I NEVER send drinks back). The server was very nice about it though, and took them off of our tab. We ordered another beer &amp; paid. While I definitely like this place, my second experience was just less than stellar, and I wished the desserts were up to par with my first time here. I'm sure I'll be back, but based on my second time here, the service was just too slow and the food and drinks just weren't as awesome. Oh well. There's always next time.",

The interior was very artsy (nice paintings, modern decor and furniture), and very dim.. I couldn't exactly see what I was eating until I used my camera flash lol.  OUR COCKTAILS. Guava Lychee Martini ($8?): 5/5. DELICIOUS. I personally love both the guava and lychee flavors, so the combination was amazing.  Blood Orange Cocktail ($7): 3/5. mostly tasted the sparkling wine, with a TINT of orange.   OUR DESSERTS. Apple ala mode ($9): 4/5. Hazelnut? Check. Gingerbread ice cream? Check. I really want to love this dessert, but in the end, I couldn't finish it because it got too sweet with the additional caramel syrup and cream cheese..  Ice Cream Sandwich ($9?): 5/5. This was the first time I ever had an ice cream sandwich between two macaron tops. I think what made it so good was the honeydew ice cream! First time having that flavor, too. I think they change the ice cream flavor every so often, so I would ask what it is before ordering.  I also want to point out their huge selection of board games!

Being in the NOPA area, there's surprisingly an abundance of Asian people here hahaha.   Aside from all of that, I tried the CB Mule (ginger beer with lime) which was delightful and quite enjoyable... and refreshing to say the least.   My buds ended up getting Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semifreddo. I didn't get to try that out, but I'm going to guess that it was pretty good considering there wasn't a single crumb left.   The dB level was pretty high in here so if you're going to have a convo between you and your crew, it's OK to speak even though it looks like a quiet place since it's so dark.",

Candybar is definitely a chick bar. \u00a0I'm not even going to front. \u00a0A lounge specializing in desserts, wines, and specialty cocktails of frou-frou goodness. \u00a0Please, this is now in my top five of Holy Trinities (I'll get around to posting that list someday). \u00a0The vibe here is very sleek and very romantic. \u00a0Gentlemen, are you paying attention because your girl is trying to hook you up here. \u00a0If you want any self respecting woman to lie on her back with her heels pointing to Jesus, take her here.  Honestly, some of the drinks here are as decadent as the desserts. \u00a0The 50/50 really does taste just like an orange dreamsicle. \u00a0Sangria's, both red and white, were also tasty. \u00a0As for the desserts, they offer a tasting menu Sun-Thurs. \u00a0We went on Friday night so booo, what a major let down. \u00a0Really Candy, you must reconsider that decision (I detest being denied). \u00a0Instead, I asked what their specialty/bestseller was as well as his personal favorite and that's what we ordered. \u00a0For the record, the bestseller is the Chocolate Cremeux Cake which has a black currant sauce and thyme ice cream. \u00a0Herb in ice cream??? \u00a0I've heard of certain um herbs used in brownies, but ice cream? \u00a0Hmmm, very interesting...I wonder...and mental note is made! \u00a0Sorry, back on track. \u00a0The ice cream had a very interesting flavor. \u00a0So much so I wouldn't eat it on it's own. \u00a0But the pairing with the chocolate cake and currant sauce was perfect and completely worked. \u00a0His personal favorite (and now mine) was the Fruit Tart. \u00a0C'est magnifique. \u00a0Talk about party in my mouth. \u00a0I think I got pregnant just off that first bite.  So while I was sitting there having multiples, I spot the selection of card/board games they offer. \u00a0Awesome, because what could be better than trying to concentrate while inebriated. \u00a0I pick my poison, Connect Four (an oldie but goodie), and start whipping some ass. \u00a0Who knew. \u00a0The more I drink, the better I get. \u00a0Yes damnit, I am the Connect Four Queen (bow down).  Other key info: parking is tricky here (big surprise there) and it's not close to Bart. \u00a0They do have happy hour until 8 freaking pm (yay) with $3 Sangria's and $2 beers to boot so yeah, I'm sooo coming back!",

When you walk in, you're surrounded by an intimate atmosphere of low, candlelit tables with a small bar in the middle. There's a shelf stocked full of various board and card games for customers to peruse and play at their leisure as well - really rounding out the playful/dessert experience.  My boyfriend ordered the passion fruit cocktail and we had the flourless chocolate/banana cake - each were terrific! As you'd imagine, the drink was rather sweet, but it had a nice, fruity aroma and taste. It was refreshing and just the right size to nicely complement the dessert. The dessert was a generous serving - not overwhelmingly large - but certainly more than enough to share between two people. The cake was served with a dollop of whipped cream on the top and a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. There was also a portion of candied pineapple on both sides of the cake. While I didn't taste much of a banana flavor, the cake itself was great - very rich, dense and fudgy. When eaten with a bite of vanilla ice cream and a bit of whipped cream, you had a great mixture of flavors. The vanilla softened the denseness of the chocolate cake. The pineapples, while fun to eat, were almost too much of yet another flavor/texture to introduce into the dish. While I enjoyed eating them, it was almost hard to get a forkful of whipped cream, cake, ice cream and pineapple all into one bite.  We sat at the bar and the bartender who served us was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We'll definitely be back to sample the rest of the menu!",

Games on the shelf for you to grab, by awkwardly reaching over people. Dimly-lit bathroom. Red curtains and lighting make an Asian glow not so Asian-glowy, which is nice.  The couches were awkward because they're the same height as the table so it makes eating or playing games awkward (or just bad for your back), unless you sit criss-cross applesauce on the couch.  I HIGHLY recommend the Lemon &amp; White Chocolate. A lovely scoop of lemon sorbet on the top with a cluster of blueberries over granola crumbs. Lemon cake and white chocolate mousse layered over each other in a little jar. Lovely presentation. Delicious execution.  The cocktails are made mostly of sparkling wine and/or soju. Not too much of a fan but they have other drinks on the back of the menu. It seems the online menu is more lengthy than the physical menu.  In all, it's lovely.

I have to say this is a very classy place to just hang out, indulge in some gourmet desserts, and sip on some cocktails. The front area is a more casual bar area with stools and sofas while the back area is slightly more formal with table service. The atmosphere is very romantic and laid back with candlelit tables. We came here on a Thursday night around 10 PM, which is technically their closing time. However, they were very friendly and still admitted us within 5 minutes after a table opened up. The inside was still packed and they were obviously not closing for the next hour or so. We used our Groupon and ordered our cocktails: Mango Tango Bellini (sparkling wine, mango syrup, mango-tangerine sorbet) and Strawberry Kiss (sparkling wine, ginger ale, frozen strawberry). The cocktails were pretty good, but not great in the sense the ingredients used were very basic (you can mix them yourself at home). But at the very least you can tell the sparkling wines were very high quality. The real highlights here are the desserts: Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo (almond brittle, Nutella powder, cantaloupe) and Apple a la Mode (hazelnut crust, cream cheese filling, caramel, gingerbread ice cream). The desserts were fantastic and very shareable. I would come back for just the desserts alone. The music was suitable for face to face conversations and consisted mostly of R&amp;B slow jams: not too hyper, not too mellow. You can still clearly hear conversations from adjacent tables though (can be good or bad). I would expect to pay around $20 +/- $5 per person for a dessert + cocktail. The walls are adorned with interesting artwork from local artists on a rotating basis. Also, there is a big selection of board games available for larger groups. Lastly, this place is CLOSED on Mondays. All in all, the prices might be a little high, but I'm definitely coming back for the awesome food and trendy atmosphere.",

The dessert menu touts all sort of wondrous curiosities such as \"Buttered popcorn creme brulee and orange creamsicle cookie,\" but upon ordering said dish, I received a pretty standard creme brulee with a handful of caramel popcorn on the side, and a madeleine cookie with a piping of orange zest whipped cream on top. What a cop out!   So anyway, the desserts were unmemorable, but not bad either. Maybe I'm just a dessert snob too.  The saving graces for this establishment are the happy hour drinks and the atmosphere. Both the white and red sangria were delicious at $2 a pop. You could chug those suckers thinking you were drinking juice, only to find that you were drunk 20 minutes later. (Guilty.) Candybar itself is a cute place. It's chic and cozy without being pretentious. They also offer an assortment of books to read and tabletop games like checkers to play if your date happens to be conversationally challenged.",

If you have a friend who is not a heavy drinker this is a good place for them because the drinks taste nothing like alcohol. I had the 50/50 cocktail, which is made of soju, orange soda, and vanilla. It tasted like an orange creamsicle. Please don't revoke my man card, but this was pretty darn tasty. Don't worry like a true man I switched over to beer after downing this milkeshake er I mean cocktail. My friend ordered a Strawberry Kiss (sparkling wine, ginger ale, and frozen strawberry) and a Mango Bellini (sparkling wine with mango sorbet). Both drinks were refreshing and delicious. There goes my man card again.  The desserts here are really good. We got the dessert sampler, which came with 4 desserts of your choosing for the reasonable price of $25. Not bad at all. For our four picks we decided on the apple a la mode, flourless chocolate cake, tiramisu, and Japanese cheesecake. Each dessert was well crafted and presented nicely. The only dessert I wasn't a fan of was the cheesecake, which is surprising considering I love cheesecake! I felt the texture and consistent was more cake like than anything else. It lacked the creaminess of a traditional cheesecake.  If you are in search of some cavities, this is the place for you! This is a great place to chill and relax, save the drama at the door. I will definitely be back here again!",

We got there at 11 and didn't get seated for at least 30 minutes. We tried two drinks and 3 desert plates.   The Strawberry Kiss and Mango Tango sparkling wine cocktails were pretty yummy. The desserts on the other hand were pretty much just decent. We tried the red velvet cake, peanut butter jelly time, and flour-less chocolate cake. I liked that they had dollops of icecream, sorbet, or cremes on the side of the dish that garnished and complimented the flavors of the main item. You can really taste the ingredients in their ice cream and sorbets. The mint icecream that came with the red velvet really tasted just like mint leaves, wasn't a huge fan of that. I love mint but not the taste of leaves. It was a little strong for me.  If you like peanut butter or Reese's, you should definitely try the \"peanut butter jelly time\". \u00a0  The concept of the place is cool and it's a nice place to chill with some friends for a night on the town, but cause of the price I subtract half a star and will probably only be back during Happy Hour.",

Nothing to rave about, but dessert is like pizza - it can only be so bad, and I will always eat it if it's there.  2) Drinks - great selection of regular wines, dessert wines, and cocktails.   3) Ambiance - cute little lounge, very very dimly lit as others have said.   4) BOARD GAMES - best. idea. ever. The only thing better than playing games with friends is playing games with friends while sipping on sweet wine in a cute little lounge. After this place, I've gone to every other lounge feeling a bit dissatisfied that there were no board games there.  5) Tip to the guys: **perfect date spot!!!** The girl will love the sweets (in both edible and liquid form), and the fun games will prevent any awkward silences, provide laughs, and great opportunities for fun bantering.

We played connect four and uno and it was just a good way to catch up with friends and enjoy a drink or two. Definitely a place to relax and forget about work/school.

The desserts were presented well and the portions are perfect for two to share. We tried the Apple a la mode (Apple cake, cream cheese frosting, poached apples, and a scoop of gingersnap ice cream) and the Drunken S'mores (caramel with hazelnut crust, with marshmallow, drizzled with rum hot fudge).   I gave the desserts 3 stars because they were a little too sweet for our taste and because I grew tired of each dessert after the second or third bite. It was also really nothing special.  The environment, on the other hand, was great! It was very intimate, romantic, and really trendy/hip. The lights are dim, there are art pieces covering the walls, and everyone in the establishment has a glass of wine in hand. Candybar is basically a lounge or bar that serves desserts!   They also have an assortment of boardgames, so this place would definitely be great for groups as well!",

There are board games while you wait for your desserts, and some creative champagne cocktails-- (one pomegranate/blueberry champagne cocktail had blue poprocks on the rim instead of sugar). The desserts that we were able to order (see gripes below) were amazing! The person who put this menu together and prepared the desserts has some serious creativity and talent. (Carrot cake with bananas and carmelized nuts and OMG \"salted caramel\" flavored ice cream- not on the website's menu, but amazing!)  We took public transit and it is really easy to get a cab on divisadero so I can't comment on lack of parking.  Gripes: Half of the desserts were \"all out\", which the wait staff informed us when he handed us the menu--bummer. One of the ones that we ordered was also out, but we didn't tell us it was out and just never brought it to us. They also still tried to charge us for that dessert that never came. It took us forever to get the credit card back (and there were only 8-9 tables!). The place is small and can't really accomodate large groups (it \u00a0was difficult to get a group of five at one table. The wait staff was extremely casual, being unprofessional at times. I understand that the vibe was a modern hipster dessert bar, but they they were very slow for \u00a0two people being responsible for only 8-9 tables, inattentive, seemed annoyed to be there and didn't even know their own menu (what was still being offered). It took a long time to get simple drinks delivered to our table.  I suggest the owner get new waitstaff and train them that waiting tables is more than just writing down orders and bringing food from the kitchen. I really liked the desserts, but it was pricey. I am not sure we would have gone is we didn't have a $35 dollar off coupon.  so, three stars for the desserts, no stars for the slow, unfriendly wait staff.",

The amuse was a little shot glass of sparkling lemon gelee (I think that's what our server called it). It was a little too sweet but still tasty. I had the chocolate parfait and warm vanilla cake -- absolutely DIVINE. Hats off to the fine pastry chef! The \"mignardise\" (milk and cookie) was a cute way to end the \"meal.\" \u00a0The milk was actually a condensed milk/dulce de leche concoction that was out-of-this-world. The accompanying cookie was tiny but delicately flavored.   Hubby ordered wine but since I'm not I'm not a drinker, I can't comment on their wine list.  The 'hood is a bit rough, and you'll have a 5% chance of finding parking, but it's worth the effort to get to Candybar. There are a couple of great bars nearby -- Fly Bar and Bar 821 -- so you can make a night of it and head over after satiating your sweet tooth.",

We had been there the week before on a Tuesday, when their web site said they were open, but they were closed that day for some reason. \u00a0I wish they had posted that on their web site as I checked it before driving over. \u00a0But we discovered the pie shop about a block away, and actually enjoyed that more than Candybar.  I am a sugar addict, I eat sweets everyday. \u00a0So I can't believe I thought the drinks and at least the dessert I had, were way too sweet. \u00a0My friend and I both had the Strawberry Kiss drink, it tasted almost syrupy to me. \u00a0I had the peanut butter pie with blackberries, and I didn't like it much at all either. \u00a0Way too much sticky blackberry syrup on top. \u00a0The combo was not at all good on my stomach. \u00a0If I came back, but I doubt that I will, I would stick to a dessert only.  I really like the concept and thought I would love this place, but I actually feel a little nauseous even thinking about it.",

We ordered the dessert sampler where you get to choose 4 desserts for $25. We had the Strawberry Limeade, the Japanese cheesecake with guava sorbet and champagne granita and honeydew, the tiramisu, and the apple a la move. OH. MY. GOD. It was heaven on earth. The Japanese cheesecake was definitely my favorite. Its a lighter cheesecake as opposed to the more dense american cheesecake. The guava sorbet complimented the cheesecake and the champagne granita was the cherry on top. Would i come back? In a heartbeat.   Oh, and they also have board games handy in case you want to stay and hang out. With that happy hour? Not a bad idea ;) Would be a good place to go with a date or a group of friends.",

Clearly not a fault of Candybar, but it needs to be mentioned because you are much wiser to drop off the rest of your party to put their name on the list while you spend the next 30 minutes hunting for a parking spot.  Atmosphere is great for what Candybar aspires to be. Had a good chat with the owner who tries his best to accommodate everyone on the list. A bunch of my friends (including Chena N.) came here on a Saturday evening on the premise of desserts and drinks. Okay, I'm the one drinking - everyone else had water. Lame.  Their bloody orange cocktail was simple and well executed. I would order it again. The sugar cube adds a nice visual as well as taste to the drink.  I ordered the Drunken S'mores. Very good with a nice thick slab of marshmallow on a chocolate tart. I also sampled their Panna Cotta, and I couldn't believe how fragrant the rose was - strong enough to live up to the name, but not overpowering.  I would definitely come back, and am kicking myself for not having tried this sooner.",

Greeting you at the door is a sugar coated aroma blended irresistibly with the cozy, dimly lit ambience - so make a reservation, because standing outside in anticipation is cruel and unusual.   The desserts are so artfully crafted I almost hesitated to dig my spoon in and ruin the picture, but let's be real - chocolate espresso pudding with a pecan, red velvet, BACON, crumble? I'll let my tastebuds do the viewing. The sparkling wine cocktails are the cherry on top. Without a full bar there's no temptation to get sloppy, just the right amount of alcohol to put you in the mood to cozy up next to your boo (or bestie or mom) and breathe a sigh of contentment.  In good company (however you may define it) what's not to like about a night of dessert, wine, and board games?",

Their great decor features original art; great friendly service. Although the desserts are creative and pleasant, and the dulce malted milk positively delightful, we would've liked to see a more inspired wine list; this place has great potential but needs a better wine/champagne selection, reason that I am taking off one star.

The atmosphere is a bit weird -- kind of clubby with its dim lights and funky HK-style art, but then there are the board games, which is cool. Desserts and drinks both average around $9 each, and the desserts are definitely shareable. Like many other reviewers, I had a Groupon, and our waiter didn't put up any kind of fuss or try to pull some shady fine print on us. The drinks are all made either with soju or sparkling wine, and all of them were pretty sweet. But, hey, you expect as much from their descriptions on the menu! The desserts were surprisingly tasty; this place definitely tries to be a little creative and fancy with its flavor combo. I was surprised by how sweet the Drunken S'mores were -- seemed like that would be the easiest to pull off well -- and how dense and kind of flavorless the red velvet cake was. Those were the negative surprises. I found the PB&amp;J pretty fun, but you have to love peanuts because there are a whole lot of them on the plate! The sundae was tasty, too, with classic green (it's gotta be green!) mint chip ice cream. Didn't much like the macarons that accompanied the sundae, but the brownies were tasty. It's unlikely I would come back again, as the ambience kind of threw me, but were a friend to really want to try it, I'd have no reservations. It's hard to find good service!",

Chopped apples and orange pieces floated in a layer on the top and were sized to flow perfectly into your mouth instead of impeding the flow of liquid. If I wasn't so full from dinner I would've tried a bellini since they looked quite tasty. I tried my friends' red sangria, strawberry __ (blanking), and blood orange cocktails.

Dim lights, with the added effect of many candle lights softens the edge that the paintings on the walls portray. The place was small, and on a weekend, wait time for a party of 2 was 1 hour! I wasn't that surprised that it took so long to get a table though, because there were about 2-3 big groups. With the added bonus of a selection of board games on the shelf, it is a nice place to chill and hangout with friends..but would also take people forever to leave.  For drinks, we ordered a Mango Tango Bellini and a Blueberry Pomegranate Fusion. The mango one was quite delicious and the mango sorbet inside gave the drink something special. The blueberry one was a bit on the sour side and I felt like I was just drinking berry juice.  For desserts, we had Japanese Cheesecake and Ice Cream Sandwich. Very delectable and a good blend. I liked that the dessert wasn't overly sweet, with a good balance of taste and texture.  Next time, I'd be sure to arrive early or make reservations.

The drinks were also yummy... the 50/50 (soju, OJ, vanilla..$8) was my favorite bc it tasted like a tu-tone popsicle =) \u00a0They also have fun boardgames.... so we just chilled, drank, nibbled on our sweets and played speed connect four=) \u00a0  Chic, fun, and laid back...",

I highly recommend others to try it too! \u00a0As for drinks, we ordered the mango tango bellini and the passion fruit... both were delicious. \u00a0All things ordered were elegantly plated and presented. \u00a0I would say one of the best things though, were the games. \u00a0We got caught up playing \"True Colors\" and ended up laughing and chatting for over 2 hours. \u00a0It's such a great place to catch up with old friends, hang out after dinner, or bring a date. \u00a0I will definitely be back... with my husband this time! \u00a0=) \u00a0Thank you candybar, for exceeding my expectations!",

After a quick Google search, Candybar's site came up boasting a luxury lounge feel with great wine and desserts. Upon arriving, the ambiance was more of a coffee shop/diner than lounge. Definitely not cool or hip in any way. The red velvet seats were dirty and had unknown substances spilled on them, so we all huddled on the non-velvet chairs. The service was pretty bad and our waiter's attitude acted as he could care less if we were there or had a good experience.  The wine list - if you could call it that - was more of \"do you want red or white?\" but the dessert list was pretty good. We got drunken s'mores and the ice cream sandwich. The s'mores was good but a little too chocolatey. The melon ice cream in the sandwich was amazing and I wanted to eat an entire gallon of it myself.",

They also have some cool art on the walls and board games like Connect Four or Blokus for people to play.   The drinks are yummy and the desserts are both fancy and funky. The menu changes all the time so the good thing is that there is always something new to try. The downside is that sometimes a dessert which should never disappear, will do just that. The first dessert I ever had here was their cheesecake and it was so yummy. I came back hoping to relive the moment but alas, the menu had changed. So sad...I hope they bring it back! I also had this nacho sundae once which was the cutest thing I have ever seen. They basically created a dessert to look like nachos with salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. Mmm!",

Excellent wine list- and a good balance of sweet and savory dishes on the small plates menu. \u00a0The space feels very open and the atmosphere is quite casual. \u00a0They had board games available and I never turn down an opportunity to kick some ass so I challenged my friend to Connect Four. \u00a0Considering we were playing to see who would buy the drinks, I knew I had a lot at stake and my concentration was high. \u00a0I ended up winning of course so I got to drink for free and bask in my glorious achievement of being a skilled player of a game invented for the ages 7+. \u00a0  The pork terrine was excellent. I suggested they add just a couple more crostini or cornichons to the dish and make it more proportional. They also have a duck pate which I didn't try ( I think pork pate/terrine usually has a more mild flavor while duck tends to be richer in flavor) \u00a0I also sampled a Riesling from the white wine menu and even though the server didn't know about the wine, she offered me a taste and it was quite wonderful. \u00a0My suggestion would be that the staff definitely should get to know the wine a bit more. But she handled it well and was a total sweetheart. \u00a0I like that the place is family owned and run because you can feel the love that they put into this place. I will definitely return and I can't wait to try the other savory dishes.",

Not your neighborhood Willy Wonka candy store. This is seriously a dessert place for mature palettes. The dessert shop and bar was low lit, had fun art on the walls and a whimsical chandelier. I loved the cubbies full of books and classic board games. It is just a fun and cool concept.  Notable desserts: Peanut Butter Jelly Time ~ chocolate tart with peanut butter cream, salted candied peanuts and blackberries \u00a0was a sophisticated take on childhood nostagia. It was the right combination of tangy, sweet and salty!  Drunken S'more ~ with Bailey's chocolate sauce not too sweet, good didn't really wow me but delicious nonetheless!  Apple Pie A La Mode ~ hazelnut crust, cream cheese filling, caramel and gingerbread ice cream, nice texture with the crispy hazelnut crust meeting the soft cream cheese filling and ice cream, yum!!!  Flourless chocolate banana torte ~ pineapple, peanuts, and vanilla bean ice cream. Chocolate and banana really do go well together! There was a great balance in this dessert.  Strawberry Limeade ~strawberry mousse, vanilla cake, calamansi cream and strawberry layered inside of a small jar, fun to eat!  Cocktails that I like:  Passion Fruit Delight ~sparkling wine and passion fruit puree Strawberry Kiss ~sparkling wine, strawberry puree and gingerale  Lychee Guava Martini ~ soju, lychee, guava nectar  Jasmine Sparkle ~ so refreshing sparkling wine wine, jasmine and lemon  The cocktails were generously poured \u00a0and well made. Cozy, trendy without being pretentious. Perfect for couples or small groups. Super courteous service. I love desserts and I love cocktails so this is a place that makes perfect sense to me.

The desserts are unique and tasty, there are drinks for all tastes (cocktails, beer, and wine), and games for when you want a bit of extra entertainment!  At the enthusiastic recommendation of the girls sitting nearby, two of us decided to split the Peanut Butter Jelly Time and the Flourless Chocolate Banana Torte.  The Peanut Butter Jelly Time ($9) was a chocolate peanut butter tart SMOTHERED in blackberries and some sort of jam-like substance, served with delicious candied peanuts. I liked it, though I would say that it had diminishing returns. After a few bites I became pretty overwhelmed by the peanut butter and blackberries.  The Flourless Chocolate Banana Torte ($10) served with vanilla ice cream was pretty good though fairly standard. I couldn't taste much banana flavor in the cake unfortunately. Don't worry - the pineapple listed on the menu is only a side garnish. It was actually pretty nice to have a some tartness after all that sugar!  On a separate occasion, I tried some sort of ice cream sandwich with macarons and remember liking it quite a bit. I don't see it on the online menu, however...  As for the drinks - I started with a sparkling wine cocktail with blueberry-pomegranate juice. I'm not a big fan of sweet drinks usually, but I really enjoyed this! My friend ordered the Stawberry Kiss and seemed to like it. Next time I'll either split ONE dessert or stick to beer to avoid sugar overload!  And finally, THE GAMES: Battleship, Connect 4, Chutes and Ladders, Apples to Apples, the list goes on! Really fun way to spend an evening!",

I've personally driven past this place a million times and the few times we've tried to go parking was absolutely impossible. But fortunately we lucked out that night... 2 and a half blocks away hah!  We walked in and got seated right away luckily (there were 5 of us and it was fairly packed inside but not overly crowded). It was dark inside with the lighting setting a more intimate mood but at the same time more social (if that makes any sense) since there were couples there as well as groups of friends. Best way to describe this place is dessert lounge. The menu was made up of fancy desserts as well as a fair sized drink menu, the drinks being comprised of beer, wine, champagne, specialty cocktails (made with soju and such, not hard liquor) and similar. Also, they had board games and cards there which I thought was pretty cool.  I went with the Apple a La Mode ($9). It came out along with the other orders fairly quick and I gotta say, I was impressed. The plating was exquisite and the flavors were on a whole other level! Take note tho they're really sweet so be prepared!  I forgot the name of our server but he was great. Nice, sharp, sense of humor and happily willing to split our single check between 2 cards and cash so a shoutout to you good sir. I would definitely return here, probably like after dinner or something. The desserts were great, the prices for them seemed just a wee bit high (average around $9-$10) but I guess that's expected for a dessert lounge?

The drinks were on the sweet side. i wish they served hard alcohol instead of just wine and beer. It really limits the creativity of the cocktails.  We shared the tiramisu and the apple/hazelnut concoction. The tiramisu was very good -- light and not cloyingly sweet. Even with that, it got pretty heavy after a while. Neither of us particularly cared for the other dessert. It was way too heavy, with the cake drenched in a syrupy goo and the cinnamon flavor was overwhelming.  Our server looked pretty pissy and did not make us feel welcome. Maybe it was because we used a groupon.

    "review_text": "So I came here a while ago and had a long wait and a tiramisu which was just not very good. But I always wanted to come back again and try their red velvet cake (on a day when I'd actually allow myself to eat something so decadent...) and try one of their drinks, and finally, this past weekend, I was able to.  Actually, I went one night when it was so crowded I couldn't even get in. When we got there we were told that the wait would be longer than they were open for so we had to leave. The next night we came back (early!) and they told us there was a two hour wait, but to come back in half an hour. Confusing. I think the girl was doing the best she could. We came back in exactly half an hour and they said another half-hour, but I noticed there were definitely not that many people ahead of us actually waiting for their name to be called on the list, so we waited outside for just 10 more minutes before we were called. Phew. I didn't want to have to have ANOTHER night canceled because they were again too crowded.  I had about had it--I mean, I'd come here a few months ago and also had at least an hour wait, and the dessert was sub-par. Why on earth had I come back again? Clearly people liked it, but it had to be a helluva good dessert to prove it to me.  Service was friendly but very slow. You'd think they'd try rushing us out faster since they had such a long line of people who, if they were actually told straight-up that it'd be a 30-60 minute wait, would actually stay in line and business would cycle faster and they'd get more money. They also screwed up my boyfriend's drink order (as well as the drink order of the girl next to us) but they could have been really busy or short-staffed that night and they brought us the correct drink with no trouble.  I would have gotten irritated except for when we got our dessert...  holy cow...  that red velvet cake...  AHHHHH  HEAVEN  SO much better than the tiramisu. And I ordered the blood orange drink that was exactly the kind of drink I like--just the right amount of sour. My boyfriend got the semifreddo which he didn't like at all so maybe it's just the cake that's good, but OH. WOW. It's the kind of red velvet cake for people who like really dense cakes that are deliciously sweet and fatty, not light and airy. It didn't have a lot of frosting and usually I'm a frosting gal but wow, this cake was so enjoyable when you just took a slow bite and let the flavors melt in your mouth, I could eat it every day for the rest of my life and not even mind the health consequences because MAN was it good. If you like red velvet cake, you need to try this cake.  So I don't know. So far I didn't like the other desserts, and maybe the drinks were a little pricey, but the servers were nice and the red velvet cake was omnomnomnomzzonmz...soooo...if I ever have a day I decide I'm particularly worthy of an extra couple thousand calories, I'll be back.

Pretty comphy seating, with dim lights and awesome throwback hip-hop. \u00a0Three of us arrived early and immediately got to ordering drinks..I had the Blood Orange cocktail all night, while others in my party had the Strawberry Kiss and the Red and White Sangria. I still think mine was the best, but the Sangria was okay too.  For dessert I split the Carrot Cake with a friend. Not your traditional hunk-o-cake but it was moist, served with some whipped cream, not from a can thank god, and a little dollop of ice cream (see photos).   My friends ordered an assortment of:   Tiramisu: awseome...big portion definitely share-worthy with lots of yummy coffee \"crumbles\" around the plate  Chocolate Financier cake: (see photo) pretty much a chocolate cake and a cheesecake I think...I concentrated more on the other desserts  Panna Cotta: delicious! A strawberry balsamic reduction is a great surprise at the bottom and I dont even like strawberries that much  Ice Cream Sandwich: yummy chewy cookie loaded with ice cream and blueberries. Divine.  For all the desserts and the numerous rounds of drinks we got it (I had at least 6, dont judge) the total was only $28 a person. We also got to play Apples to Apples...love it! and there were lots of couples and business guys grabbing an after work drink as well. SO bummed I didn't know about this place before as I live down the street, but I will definitely be back for another visit!",

They've got a 15-20 different board/card games that you can use while you're sipping fruit infused champagne and nibbling on desserts.  As far as the desserts, I wasn't entirely impressed but I do give them credit for being inventive. They pair interesting flavors together such as green tea ice cream with an oversize lavender macaroon.   If I were to try something again it would be the Apple Pie a la Mode and the Chocolate Mousse. I'm not a fan of coconut shavings so was turned off by the red velvet cake.   The drinks are crazy good though! A little pricey ($8-10 for a flute) but definitely worth trying at least once. I like the strawberry kiss.",

Probably the worst service and treatment I have experienced living in SF for years...that alone says a lot. I purchased a Groupon- wanted to give this place a try. Yes it expired 3/16 and yes I (along with many others) went on 3/16 to claim our Groupons, but A.that is our prerogative and B. it didn't say there was a reso needed and it didn't say no takeout)! A Groupon expiring on 3/16 means that you can still claim it on 3/16. When I arrived at 8pm and saw the line of waiting people, I was just going to pick a few things up to go.   When I finally spoke with the host:  RUDE HOST: \"You probably won't be seated by 10pm and we close at 10pm\" ME: \"Ok, can I order a few items to go?\" RUDE HOST: \"No.\" ME: \"Hmm...can you extend the Groupon one day so I can come back?\" RUDE HOST: \"Nope.\"  ME: \"So....I can't be seated before you close....I can't order anything to go... and you can't extend the deadline for us because you are unable to accommodate us?\" RUDE HOST: \u00a0\"You had a year to use it.\" ME: \"I understand that I had a year to use it, but I am here, before the expiration and I would like to use it and I can't\" RUDE HOST: \"Yep.\"  All I could think of was how dumb business move this was. Here were a bunch of people, who could potentially turn into returning customers, refer others, write great yelp reviews and ultimately boost business. I totally get that these businesses probably only break even on Groupon deals in hopes of getting great marketing- but I don't think that the people at Candybar understand that by treating their new eager customers wanting to try THEM out rudely, and by ultimately pocketing our money without being flexible because they could not accommodate us, they are turning their potential supporters into haters. Not only will I never go there and veto group outings to go there, but I would advise others not to go there as well.   I'm usually a super positive person so its a bummer to write such a negative review. All they had to do was extend the deal and everyone would be happy. Too bad. \u00a0  Hope they change their mind...",

This place is a dessert bar; I've discovered that I'm a fan of dessert bars! \u00a0It's a great concept: \u00a0dessert+alcohol=what's not to like?  So, we ended up here on Saturday night for dessert &amp; a drink. \u00a0I had a late huge lunch, so this was my dinner, along with some snacks at a friend's house party.  The place is surprisingly warm &amp; cozy inside, especially since they kept the door open. \u00a0The setting is slightly more casual than the dessert bar that I went to in Pasadena, as I don't think they serve meals here, and they have board games on shelves for you to browse &amp; play! \u00a0Think of it as a nice caf\u00e9/bar. \u00a0I was in totally casual clothing, since I'd been out and about in a sweatshirt, jeans, &amp; tennis shoes all day, but most of the other people there were slightly dressed up. \u00a0I'm guessing that most people had come from a dinner out elsewhere.  So, we shared  Chocolate butterscotch brownie with candied walnuts, fudge, thyme ice cream: \u00a0pretty good, nice presentation, not sure if they make their own ice cream, but thyme is quite the unique ice cream flavor (but having unique ice cream flavors seems to be the trend nowadays) Green tea bread pudding with toasted almonds, chocolate chips, vanilla bean ice cream: \u00a0pretty good, again, nice presentation The portions aren't very big, so it's a good thing we weren't very hungry. I had the strawberry kiss to drink. \u00a0It's a spritzer type sparkling wine mixed with ginger ale, with a frozen strawberry in it. \u00a0I had a hard time deciding which \"cocktail\" to get, so this was the server's favorite, so I got it &amp; was happy with it.  Located on the south side of Fulton, between Broderick &amp; Divisadero. \u00a0Parking can be a bit challenging in this area, which we discovered firsthand.",

Parking can be challenging, but usually there are a few spots on side streets or off of Fulton/Divisadero. The ambiance is very intimate; dim and cozy, but unfortunately, a bit loud. Fortunately, I can look past the noise and appreciate this place for what it offers: unique desserts, potent-but-undeniably-tasty cocktails, and a fun atmosphere.   During my most recent visit, a girlfriend and I ordered the \"Candybar Dessert for Two\" with the Almond-Honey Pannacotta, Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semifreddo, Apple Ala Mode, and the Flourless Chocolate Banana Torte. Needless to say, all but one of the dishes were demolished. We unfortunately, didn't care for the pannacotta. Everything else, though, was exquisite. The Lavender Honey dish was exceptionally surprising for me - I'm very sensitive to flavors reminiscent of bath soaps, shampoos, etc. - but the chefs and Candybar made the lavender flavor not only tolerable, but delicious. The Chocolate Banana Torte has always been a mainstay for me, and I couldn't help but order it on each of my 4+ visits, including this one. For drinks, we ordered the Strawberry Kiss, Passion Fruit Delight, Red Sangria, and two Candybar Lemon Drop Shots (obviously not all at the same time). The cocktails were pleasing - sweet and definitely packed a punch.   Overall, my experiences here have been nothing short of amazing. Prices are moderate, so do expect to pay a pretty penny.

I think 3 desserts would have been enough, the portions were still big. The winner, was the strawberry Limade which was a fluffly hybrid of cake and mousse, it had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness from the lime. Second runner up was a lavender based dessert. Peanut butter tart was a disappointment, the base was so crumbly meets gritty. Apple crumble was ok.   Overall, they could have done a better job decorating the place. Why make a cool concept dull with worn stained furniture, dim wall paint and art work?!! Dated is what comes to mind. The desserts were ok and enjoyable. Having said that I would have liked to see more variety since all they do is desserts and a bit of creativity plating.",

Probably the best desserts I have ever had! The drinks are wonderful, especially the sparkling cocktails. They offer happy hour specials and frequently offer 2 for 1 Groupon deals. This is a great, elegant bar option for those of us who prefer wine or cocktails over beer (although Candy Bar does have a selection of bottles beers). Great for a date, girls' night out, or for a group of friends! I recommend going during happy hour, which lines up with regular dinner hours.

    "review_text": "Having had a very early dinner at Little Star, and out at a decent hour from the Bryan Adams show at the Independent, I and the husband was eager to try out Candybar, just opened about a month ago...   It is utterly charming. \u00a0I highly recommend sitting at the bar and speaking with Tan (sp?), the owner of the establishment.  The menu is split into Tasting Menu and A la Carte options, and they have an extensive selection of dessert-friendly wines and other liquors that range from champagne to ports and madeiras. \u00a0They also serve their own signature cocktails - on our visit we tasted a cava served with strawberry sorbet and strawberry-lavender syrup; and a beer with a chile-powder and salt-dusted rim.  A note about the tasting menu - it is just that - a menu intended to give the diner tastes of several different things. The emphasis is not on portion size, but on the variety and complexity of flavours highlighted. \u00a0The offerings are similar to what one would receive at a high end dining establishment, with very unique taste profiles and surprising executions (e.g., a deconstructed \"cheesecake\") that are really too sublime. \u00a0 We chose the Chevre Cheesecake \u00a0coconut sorbet / nicoise olive caramel and Bittersweet Chocolate Sorbet \u00a0foie gras tapioca / croutons. \u00a0Both were spot-on, and if you're a little leery of the unusual combinations (what? foie gras tapioca?!), trust that every single bite is delicious.  When we complimented the strawberry-lavender syrup in the cava cocktail, Tan mentioned that he had obtained it from June Taylor - a local merchant who creates all her wonderful fruit syrups, butters and conserves in Berkeley. In addition, he also offered us one of the two free samples June had given to him during his last visit to her!  If you're looking to extend an evening in the neighborhood, perhaps after a dinner at Nopa, or the soon-to-open Bar Crudo (can't wait!), Candybar is simply perfect ... different, very romantic, with an amazing set of unique dessert and drink offerings and super-friendly staff.  p.s. - if you're in the mood for less sweet options, candybar also offers a small set of savoury nibbles like soup, cheeses and terrine.",

Second Impression: The dark lighting, cool music, and abstract (but not really) paintings create a nice, romantic ambiance--much more chic and mellow than a club or regular bar but more fun than a traditional restaurant.  My friends and I chose this place after scavenging for any restaurant/lounge that was open late. We came across Candybar, and its tag line of \"San Francisco's first dessert lounge\" made it quite attractive, and even its name, CANDYBAR!, sounded so hip. \u00a0We were all minors, so we just ordered desserts, which were mighty overpriced. What can I say, they have a good business going...We ordered three desserts to share among the three of us: a cake, cheesecake, and sorbet. They were very delicious, but let's just say it was good that we weren't that hungry. \u00a0They offered board games and such, and so we UNO'd the night away. \u00a0Yeah, we're a wild bunch. . .  I would definitely want to come back after I turn 21, most likely after a dinner or so. \u00a0It's a nice place to wind down with a drink, and I believe they have BYOM (Bring Your Own Meal).  Oh, and can I just say that their bathroom is lit only by candles with a full-length mirror inside! \u00a0Nice! \u00a0They're just asking for customers to have a little romp in there.",

Throw in plenty of board games to play while chatting/sipping/sweet-tooth-satisfying and you have all the ingredients for a good time. The red velvet cake had a cream cheese frosting with coconut all over it. The cake itself was pretty good but, as with carrot cake, was merely a vehicle for the cream cheese frosting... It was accompanied by a mint ice cream that was unlike any ice cream I've ever had - it tasted like it was made with fresh mint rather than \"mint flavoring.\" So good. We also tried the strawberry limeade, which was served in this little mason jar thing - also very good. Minus 1 star for the small portions; and that it took us 20 minutes to find parking, which you can't really blame on the bar but I'm going to take my road rage out on them anyway...and because they did not appreciate me announcing loudly \"you sunk my battleship!\"...",

Not professionally but I have more than a handful of people who would finance a bakery if I thought that waking up at 3am everyday sounding like a good idea (it doesn't)  Now that my disclosure is out there here we go... I was REALLY excited about this place. If I opened up any type of bakery/sweets place I would have it be a desert bar. Too bad this one left me questioning my decision.  My husband and I went here on a Tuesday night. It was rather empty which was nice since I heard the waits can be brutal. We walked in to see the waiter and the bar tender staring up at the Giants game and ignoring us. The waiter came over and sat us shortly after. Throughout the night there was barely anyone in there and yet it was impossible to get his attention - turn off the TV and start doing your job.  We then ordered the Flourless Chocolate Cake, Ice Cream Sandwiches, Lemon Tart &amp; Peanut Butter and Jelly. \u00a0I had a Kir and my husband had a sangria. Drinks were good but I have to say the deserts were okay.   Flourless Chocolate Cake: REALLY heavy + REALLY sticky. The pairings on the side were delicious - white chocolate and thyme, strawberry sorbet - yum!  Ice Cream Sandwiches: macaroons were heavy, didn't have feet (bakers know what this means) and were totally overpowered by the ice cream. Not a bad dish but not great.  Lemon Tart: I really liked the coconut macaroon accompaniment on this. filling was great - tart crust was thick  Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly - YUM! This was by far the best but I will say that it needed to have the peanuts chopped up so you could have a little with each bite.  All in all I have to say I wouldn't go back here. I came here cause I was curious and I had a GILT voucher but honestly the games that are missing almost everything and the lack of service and the mediocre deserts have me wanting to put on my apron and make something that we can enjoy at home.",

I ask you, dammit? \u00a0 I'd have understood if it tasted good. \u00a0But when it's this nasty, and ugly to look at, you have to ask why? why? why?? would you do this? \u00a0Did I miss something, is this supposed to be health food, or just taste like it? \u00a0Hmm, desserts that taste like health food... someone's bound to get fired over that one. \u00a0  We played a charades type board game over drinks- they have a bunch of board games here for the conversationally challenged- and really we tried but couldn't get through the desserts without being incentivized. \u00a0I suppose we could have just left, but competitive roshambo also gave us something to do while we figured out a plan to rescue us from the wrong turn we took walking in to this place. \u00a0 And the drinks, well, i want to take a good look at the person who put this list together- I'd shake my fist, shake my head, then walk away. \u00a0There was the one port, when there should have been several. \u00a0And it should have been great, or at least good, but at $10 the tawny served in a thimble was downright horrible. \u00a0And for beers, there's a $6 pacifico beer which they pour into what looks like a 4 oz cup for some reason. \u00a0i just don't get it. \u00a0  Lots of couples and awkward looking first dates on this particular friday night. \u00a0 I doubt this place sees much repeat business, except for the cheap drinks at happy hour... and \u00a0unless you really really like board games, or fancy yourself \"artsy\" sitting under an abstract painting.",

The terms of these dishes were loose interpretations, at best. \u00a0I dug my spoon into the ice cream sandwich and eagerly put it into my mouth, but once the tastebuds got working, there was nothing there but treacly sweetnes and a sugary vanillin flavor profile. \u00a0i think a 10 year old child could have served me two cookies and some Ben and Jerry's, which would have been preferable. \u00a0I just was wondering what were they going for here, because I've never had something so indiscernible. As for the S'mores, it was an attempt at being novel by serving the whole shebang on a cedar plank and using a brulee torch to melt the marshmallows. \u00a0Well this fails when you bring out the dish cold and you don't heat up the cedar plank. \u00a0The \"graham crackers\" and the \"chocolate\" were brownie shaped squares, and I could barely tell the difference. \u00a0Some chocolate sauce was puddled untidily nearby, which had separated and butterfat was glaring at me- a huge points drop. \u00a0It too was as unremarkably flavorless, probably due to its mindbending and cloying sugar content. \u00a0I wanted to spit it out. And considering what we are paying for a dessert house, I want to be impressed. \u00a0None of the desserts I saw actually broke the z plane. \u00a0Everything was sadly one dimensional. \u00a0I think the desserts you pay good money for ought to be rising to the occasion, and use elements such as tuiles, flowers, and spun sugar to rise up into the 3rd dimension. \u00a0We're looking for ooh's and ahh's not ugh here, Candybar. \u00a0The space is so nice, I would give it another chance once I find out the kitchen has been vetted of the amateurish attempts, and a real pastry chef is once again hired. \u00a0Otherwise, this can't go on! \u00a0Sadly, I wished I had asked for my money back and made my complaint in person, but that night I was just too tired to give a shit.",

We'd been at a joint that's touted as the best restaurant for kids in The City. It turned out to be anything but.  Desperate to salvage the evening I found Candybar while Googling good places to have desert that were nearby (we were in Laurel Village).  Candybar was friendly and \u00a0had great atmosphere - and though five-year-old girls wearing their birthday crowns aren't their normal clientele they made our family welcome and offered some amazing deserts at reasonable prices.   Oh, and the drinks are good too.",

My friends and I ordered the Flourless Chocolate Cake, Passion Fruit Chocolate Mousse, and the Buttermilk Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta. Everything was good except the Panna Cotta, it tasted weird. Too buttery? Balsamic Stawberry Reduction (whatever that is)? I don't know it just tasted funny in my opinion.  Docked a point because of our waitress. She was nice (fake?) but I really didn't like how she kept on staring at us as if we were going to run away, I mean come on the check is only going to come up to like what? $30? I also don't appreciate how she gave us the check when we weren't even done.",

During a recent visit to San Francisco, a friend and I procured a gilt city voucher for 2 cocktails and a sample platter. They honored it no problem and we were able to choose from any of their desserts and cocktails. Most of their desserts were perfect and they offered a huge variety. Are you craving something fruity? decadent? refreshing? They have it all. See drink and food breakdown below:  Jasmine Sparkler - fragrant, aromatic, perfect with the desserts and highly recommended.  Blueberry Pomegranate something - This drink was a little too sweet for me when eating so many desserts.  Tiramisu - A classic tiramisu. If you like espresso, chocolate, and cream (who doesn't?) get it.  Strauss Yogurt Cake - buttery and fruity! yum! Flourless Chocolate Cake - heavenly and decadent. The cake was paired with guava sorbet which kept it from being too heavy.  Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semifreddo - Cool and creamy, this was much like the lavender honey ice cream I had earlier at Bi-Rite Creamery.  Chocolate Cupcake Trio - Moist cupcakes with the perfect amount of frosting. The vanilla bean and chocolate were great but the blueberry cupcake was a bit indiscriminate in flavor. With so many other great desserts on the menu, I'd recommend spending your bucks on something else.   Another great thing about Candybar: despite the trendy vibe, this place is quite cozy with its friendly service and an abundance of board games.   For the last year, I've been hoping someone in LA would open up a venue with the simultaneous swank and intimacy of a lounge, but throw in some delicious quality desserts (Side note: Who is the pastry chef here?! I want to marry you.). No one's done it yet, but I think Candybar would be the perfect transplant. Seriously, I had a lengthy conversation with the owner and asked him to open up another branch in LA. Definitely a fun place to enjoy a night out.",

We began with a game of Bananagrams! and some cocktails. \u00a0  Lychee Martini - very sweet but with lychee overload flavor (and a lychee in the bottom!)  Mango Tango Blini - The wife got this and enjoyed it very much.  Food: We went with the dessert for two (four items) AND ordered another a la carte.. because.. well.. we're pigs.  Anyways... Strawberry Limeade / Strawberry Mousse / Vanilla Cake / Calamansi Cream / Strawberries - excellent and very refreshing with the fresh berries and spike of lime to tone down the heavy sweet &amp; richness of the other items  Peanut Butter Jelly Time / Chocolate Tart / Peanut Butter Cream / Salted Candied Peanuts / Blackberries - ode to pb&amp;j, this item was very comforting to me since i tend to indulge in peanut butter with little than a spoon.  Red Velvet Cake / Vanilla Bean Cream Cheese Frosting / Coconut / Toasted Housemade Marshmallows - This item was very good. \u00a0Pretty heavy too (it was the last one we ate) but very flavorful. \u00a0Even though I'm not sure why it had marshmallows with it, they were homemade, delicioud and we didn't care  Lavendar? Semifredo / Cantaloupe / Brittle - Great flavors and very light. \u00a0The cantaloupe provided an interetesting background flavor that went well with the floral flavor of the lavendar  Smores / Bailey's Chocolate Sauce - MUST GET! \u00a0The chocolate flavors were great. \u00a0Topped off with another homemade marshmallow that had been lightly charred the bailey's spiked sauce made this dish over the top  I'd highly recommend this place to anyone, just don't fill up on pizza beforehand.. of maybe you should so you avoid going too crazy here.",

For the desserts, we all shared the tiramisu, the house-made s'mores and a sundae with strawberry ice cream and strawberries. The ice cream was my least favorite.

Candybar is the perfect place to go on a date (guys, listen up!); it's very intimate, cozy, laid back, and perfect to snuggle up with that special someone on their comfy, red couches. I'd also say it's perfect for a girl's night out; there's tons of fun board games to play whilst sipping on champagne and having some sweets. Who doesn't like to play Apples to Apples drunk?! ;)  I ordered the Apple a la Mode - warm pieces of apple with a crunchy hazelnut crust, filled with cream cheese, drizzled in caramel, and topped with gingerbread ice cream - as did one of my friends, and it was heaven on a plate. It was SO delicious! I pretty much love anything 'a la mode' and Candybar did not disappoint! My other friend ordered the Ice Cream Sundae which came with strawberry ice cream, macarons, and fresh strawberries and bananas. So sweet! It was amazing but the trophy goes to the apple a la mode for sure.  Service was great - our server explained some favorites on the menu and always came to check up on us. He always made sure we had enough water because we all know how thirsty we get after indulging in some sweets!

We also had a variety of cocktails but all were on the syrupy sweet side. I guess we were at a dessert restaurant.  Overall fun place to hang if you're in the neighborhood.",

Came here with a friend as she is a dessert connoisseur, we started off with a strawberry kiss and a blood orange cocktail. Drinks were tasty.  For snacks we had, the Japanese cheesecake and Lavender honey creme fraiche. Both had really nice textures and the flavors were extremely light and a quality much like asian style desserts.

    "review_text": "I was sitting in my cozy seat perusing the sparkling cocktails and dessert menu, eying up the board game area and I couldn't help but think to myself that the owners of this bar are totally setting boys up to get some serious action. And as if they were reading my mind, or just perhaps to further prove my point Candyman's \"Knockin' the Boots\" came on.  Sir Nicholas and I ordered a couple of rounds of drinks and 2 desserts to share while I mercilessly beat him at Connect 4. (A man in the Bahamas once taught us both the trick to winning this seamlessly easy game, but I think I remember the lesson a little better.) Nick's first drink was made with Soju and Fanta and tasted like orange cream soda. It's a great choice if you like drinks with alcohol that don't taste like they have alcohol. I started with a sparkling cocktail that had a sugar cube in the bottom and blood orange bitters mixed with champagne. For the next round he had a michelada (spicy and delicious!) while I sample a French Kiss (sparkling wine with ginger ale and a big strawberry), also quite good.  Our desserts of choice were a carrot cake that came with bananas and salted caramel ice cream and an apple a la mode served with gingerbread ice cream. Both were excellent, but I preferred the carrot cake as the apple a la mode became just a little too rich after a few bites, especially when paired with my sweeter cocktails.  While this isn't a bar I'd go to just to hang out and have drinks it is most definitely a bar I'd go to repeatedly and you can beat your bottom dollar that every friend I have that visits me will be taken here at some point during their trip as well.",

If I have to question it, then that alone should say it all. But enough about me and my internal rationalizations.  I've had a Groupon for Candybar for months and for some reason took me over 1 year to actually walk in the door and see what this place was all about. Walking in, my friend and I were greeted by a gracious host/server. We sat down along a wall facing a huge coy fish mural, which I immediately fell in love with.  HUGE points for the games you can sit down and enjoy. It definitely makes for a casual date that taps into your inner child.  On the menu:  Apple a la mode - a sweet play on the apple pie, the richness was just enough. Because these plates are on the smaller end, it's great that this dish isn't overly rich so I can finish it and move on to the next one.  Peanut butter &amp; Jelly - a small tart-like dish with what seems to be a peanut butter mousse (?), with a blackberry syrup and fresh blackberries on top. Now I only had a bite of this one, and it certainly seemed richer, sweeter.  Strawberry kiss - sparkling wine, ginger ale and strawberry syrup. An unusual combination that took me a couple of sips to get used to. It finishes light and sweet.  Spicy Michelada - Ok, for those of you who know me, I strive to find the perfect michelada (read my review for Nopalito). Not it. This one was alright (2-3 stars for me), it had the right amount of spice, but was missing some ingredients and flavors for it to pack a punch. I guess my search continues...  50/50 - a drink mixed with soju, making it hard to pick out the alcohol. The glass it's served in is short, and looks like a pumpkin (the drink is bright orange). Flavors are sweet and mild, I wouldn't want more than a sip of it.",

This is definitely a place worth checking out. It's kind of in a deserted corner of SF but absolutely worth the visit.

You can also pick 4 options of dessert for $22, the ones with the asterisk you cannot use. Each dish was either $9 or $10.   Service was pretty quick, the seats behind the curtain near the bathroom were kinda blah. They can def do something more with it. Board games and cards are available on a shelve in the front.

Went in yesterday night with my friend Bridget because she had a Living Social 2 desserts and 2 drinks special. I had the tiramisu, Bridget had the Strawberry mousse dessert. I also had a blueberry pomegranate sparking wine drink and my friend had the 50/50, an orange drink with sorbet. \u00a0The food and the presentation was simply amazing. The tiramisu wasn't the absolute best I've ever had, but it was PDG (pretty darn good), light, not too rich and sweet. \u00a0Bridget's strawberry mousse dish was a little bit too sweet for me, but still good. \u00a0   I think I should probably mention that yesterday was a Tuesday night, and I arrived right at 6:45 and was seated instantly, but still the place was almost completely full. As the night progressed, the line got longer and longer and longer and was eventually out the door. I'm like, WOW! On a Tuesday? Crazy! \u00a0Long story short, get here EARLY. \u00a0Most of the people were probably trying to take advantage of the happy hour where drinks are either $3 or $4 from 6-8pm, I think. But I was expecting that kind of a line on the weekends but definitely not on a Tuesday night! :(   Another thing I've wondered about was the games.... I mean seriously? Why would a place that is that packed provide games for patrons to make them spend extra time at tables? I can understand it if the place was slow but there is always a line, especially in the evenings so I'm surprised they would be encouraging people to stay longer playing games... but \u00a0I guess the games are a nice touch. \u00a0  Support this place, your sweet tooth, AND your dentist!

What they do here is take fanciful preparations of tasty desserts (sorbets, small cakes, cookies) and then throw a small twist or two into each one, like the fennel flavoring they add to their baked alaska with carrot cake, or the hint of curry in their tiny but richly-textured peanut butter cookie.  The prices are reasonable too, with a four-course dessert tasting menu (pre-selected \"appetizer\" and \"final course\" along with two additional choices of your own) for $14, and the very helpful waitstaff will be pleased to aid you in pairing a drink (or two or three) with your selections.  About the only ding I can make against this place, other than that parking issue I mentioned, is that the table full of hotties didn't come over and hang out with me. \u00a0Totally lame! \u00a0;)",

When we asked the \"server\" what he would recommend, he said its all about personal preference. Thanks a lot for the help, dude.   Now, lets get to the dessert. I ordered the Apple Pie a la Mode which was a 1/10 in terms of preparation and taste. The apples did not taste fresh, and the crust was soft and mushy. Really not enjoyable.   And my girlfriend ordered the Ice Cream Sundae with brownies and strawberry sherbet. Her review: \"This brownie tastes like a break-n-bake brownie that was baked last week.\" I laughed because this was so true. However, the strawberry sherbet was delicious. I am guessing Candybar does't make the ice cream in house.   Anyways, just wanted to share my opinion. I would highly recommend ordering dessert at the restaurant you are at, no reason to head over to Candybar (except for playing Connect Four).",

The atmosphere is very relaxed - sit on long couches and grab a board game to entertain. Drinks are sweet cocktails with interesting (many Asian-inspired) flavors.   The desserts are always such a treat. Here are comments on some that I've tried: 1) The macaron ice cream sandwich has a great, refreshing, and not-overwhelming honeydew flavor. The actual macaron cookie isn't chewy like a true macaron - it is hard and crunchy - but since it is a cold dish it probably has to be that way. 2) The tiramisu is DECADENT. Very sweet and chocolate-y. 3) The lemon is &amp; white chocolate is perfection. If you like lemon - this is for you. The tartness of the sorbet is so fresh and light and goes perfectly with the soft mousse. 4) The lavender semifreddo is also wonderful. It comes with nutella powder that is a really interesting texture on the tongue. \u00a0I also feel like the portions have gotten a bit bigger since I first visited Candybar... but maybe that's just me.

The problem is, they missed it totally in the execution.   The bar itself looks great. Very cool artwork, nice boardgames for you to play with your friends/date.   If you're going to have a bar serving VERY sweet things to eat, make your drinks menu more varied than \"champagne\" + something sweet in the \"champagne.\" It's just overpowering sweetness when you're trying to then eat something else super sweet. Maybe try to go on the herbal / citrus side of things for some cocktail options.  Same with the food menu. A zillion items, none of them really crossing over into the savory-sweet dessert side. Everything tastes sorta mediocre while trying to be fancy. I ate at a spot in Portland that was known for its dessert and we had something with dark chocolate and some sort of salty, soft cheese and it was divine. Their menu is surprisingly large at Candy Bar, but everything on it is just overly sweet. Also, you can tell that they really pre-make everything as most things come out quite cold from the fridge.   What's weird about giving a 2-star on this spot is that I *love* dessert. I just cannot deal with everything being super sugary sweet, not balanced sweetness with the other ingredients. Give me some rich dark chocolate with cayenne pepper and I'll pair it with a sweet beverage or a citrusy beverage and something sweet/salty to eat. Also, why not have fancy coffee instead of just a \"diner style\" pot? I'd certainly opt for some sort of coffee drink and/or espresso with my dessert.  Alas, they really missed the mark here and we're going to give our last coupon away.",

The deserts tasted bland, made of cheap ingredients, way too much sugar, the ice cream in the sandwich was watery, and the sorbet was so sour it made us cringe. The chocolate on the tiramisu was more chocolate fantasy, i.e. very low coca content. Hardly any apple in the apple a la mode, plain bad. I don't get the 4-stars, this was 1 of the worst dessert places I've been too, period! Go to Ghirardelli, at least you get real chocolate and ice cream.",

I'm willing to give it another try since I only tried the drunken smores and the macaron sandwich. Out of the two, I recommend ordering the almond macaron sandwich with honeydew ice cream.  I was a bit dissapointed with the drunken smores. In my opinion, it would have been better if it was torched a bit more to stay true to the essence of smores a.k.a melted goodness.  The sandwich on the other hand was quite refreshing. It was light flavored, and it wasn't overwhelming.  Overall, I'm not a big fan. I've had better and cheaper desserts at other places. The desserts were aesthetically pleasing, but it wasn't mouthwatering. However, I do like its laid back atmosphere. It seems like a good place for a lil catch up with friends.",

Onto the food! We ordered the ice cream sandwich; some of the best macarons I've ever had: chewy and crispy at the same time. It was a great contrast with the subtly delicious honeydew ice cream. Ice cream sandwich with bigger-than-normal macarons as the buns? Yes, please.  Our chocolatey options was the big smore. Graham cracker crust, dark chocolate, and a massive, toasted, creamy marshmallow at the top. Great compliment to the fruity ice cream sandwich.  We washed all this down with a sparkling white wine.

Definitely satiated whatever dessert cravings may have been left. It was also worth the few stains my clothing fell victim to (note: be careful when consuming these products).   The reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars, though, is that the service was particularly lacking. I was with my partner sitting at the table waiting for a good 10-15 minutes before someone came to us - all while those who came in after we being seen immediately as they walked in. I'm not sure was to what was going on behind the scenes or their serving/bussing schedule, but at that time it didn't appear too packed and it was frustrating having to wait and do things yourself when you see the servers out there leisurely walking around.",

We barely managed to find a spot after circling like vultures for 15-20 minutes.  The place itself is super cute! It's the perfect place for cute candied drinks and desserts. It's not that big and seating is kind of awkward. We had a group of 6 and were seated in the corner at the front of the place where there were huge glass windows. It was weird sitting there sippin on our dranks and munching on our cakes while people stared at us as they walked by.  Service was forgettable. Nothing more to say about that.  Oh, and there were random games on the other side of the room, but we didn't bother getting up to look through them.  FOOD They have so many desserts to choose from and they all have cute/clever names (ex: peanut butter jelly time). After much debate, we settled on:  1) Apple a la mode with gingerbread ice cream 2) Flourless chocolate cake with mango ice cream 3) Red velvet cake with vanilla ice cream  Portions are SMALL. Don't come here for a meal. Come here for light desserts and sparkling drinks!  The CAKES were all VERY GOOD, esp the apple a la mode. However, oddly enough all the paired ice creams were NOT good. My friends couldn't even eat the mango ice cream because it had such a weird flavor that didn't even resemble mango.  The RED VELVET CAKE was good, but I did not like the mountain of coconut shavings that covered the cake. If it wasn't for the coconut I would've devoured the cake in 2 minutes.  DRINKS 1) Passionfruit delight 2) Strawberry kiss 3) Sangria  All the drinks were FABULOUS-- sparkly, cute, classy, and sweet! As someone who gulps down drinks quickly, I was sad that they didn't come in bigger champagne flutes. My favorite was the STRAWBERRY KISS. The passionfruit is good, and it's a little lighter than the strawberry. There were real fruit pieces in it too! Yummy!  Overall, great place for a girl's night out! It's a little overpriced, but worth a try if you're dressed up and want to have a fabulous evening out with your girl friends.",

What I got was a piece of pie that was OK, but not good enough to justify the price. I got the apple a la mode. The gingerbread ice cream was a weird addition to it. Call me old fashion, but I would have rather had a scoop of vanilla on that puppy. However, the cream cheese filling was great.

Desserts that people don't think about would taste good, but it TASTES GOOD! The ambiance? dimly lit with hints of artificiality. It took me awhile, but the bar didn't look out of place, it WAS out of place. It's the type of bar you'd find in L.A... but in San Francisco.  I did like the fact that they had board games in the bar. It seemed like a good idea to be able to play some Monopoly or Yatzee while sipping on some cocktails, but the tables were amazingly cramped. I guess they wanted to pack more people in, but it's a small issue. We ordered our food and it arrived promptly. My girlfriend had the nacho sundae platter (is it a play on the words \"not your sunday\"?), our friend had the matcha green-tea cake, while I had some fruit tart thing that's served in a little jar, the white chocolate mousse it looked like creme' brulee. It was made of three layers and garnished with the white chocolate mousse on the side. Reviewing their menu online, I learned that the three layers were Blue berry compote, Kalamansi Sorbet, and Candied Parsnips. Upon the second spoonful I realized it was the Kalamansi sorbet that really excited me. It was amazingly smooth and the chill kept the whole dessert together - a tingling delight at every bite. The blue berries were fresh and the parsnips were delightful. I almost forgot about the mousse. The sorbet was a true winner, and I had a cup of coffee with it that went together really well. The cake was mediocre for the price, but my fruit snack and my girlfriend's nacho desserts were both tasty.  Lastly, I enjoyed the food and the presentation of the food, but I wouldn't make a trip to San Francisco for it. Now if I was already in town, it would be a different story. Bon appetite!",

I had the french macaron with vanilla bean ice cream (sandwiched in between). \u00a0I couldn't taste much blueberry flavor for the macaron except for the blueberries they put inside. \u00a0Haivng said that I've been a fan of ice cream and macaron put together. \u00a0The two other places that have this combination, Gary Danko and also Chocolux (I think that is the right name) in Hong Kong. \u00a0Anyway you can't go wrong with macaron and ice cream. \u00a0  We also ordered delicious jasmine cocktail was one of the best cocktails I've had in a long time.  I'll definitely go back even if they don't change their menus as I can have the macaron and ice cream and the jasmine cocktail every time. \u00a0They did tell me they change their menu every so often.",

Now, on to dessert, folks!  Two of us had the dessert tasting menu paired with wines, while one opted for the cheese plate. \u00a0I was lucky enough to sample everything (I'm just that persuasive!)  The cheese plate was very good - 4 different cheeses, along with some medjool date paste and walnut bread.  Starter - strawberry, mint, and \u00a0lemon frappe. \u00a0I've loved frappes since I had them at Friendly's growing up on the east coast. \u00a0This was a delicious start!  Chevre cheesecake with coconut sorbet and nicoise olive caramel (paired with a vin de raisins). \u00a0While the wine didn't knock my socks off, the cheesecake was DELICIOUS! \u00a0I could eat it every night!  Carrot Cake baked Alaska with candied fennel and walnuts (paired with a Brigantino). \u00a0Not quite enough carrot cake for me to feel comfortable calling it a carrot cake, but the meringue on the baked Alaksa part is pretty damn delicious. \u00a0Likewise on the Brigantino, which could be the perfect red, effervescent dessert wine!  Warm Vanilla Cake with pickled mango and olive oil (paired with a Sauternes). \u00a0Very good cake! \u00a0The flavor is intense (which is probably why it is so small), but the accoutrements handle it well, as does the wine.  Fourme d'Ambert Panna Cotta with caramel dates and cinnamon toast (paired with a vin Santo). \u00a0Let me be honest. \u00a0This stole the show. \u00a0I adore blue, stinky cheese, and this is probably the most unique dessert I've ever tasted. \u00a0Intense sweet from the dates, with creamy tartness from the blue cheese was perfection. \u00a0Add some cinnamon toast in there, and it was amazing. \u00a0Just awesome. \u00a0I don't remember the wine much, because I was swooning over this dish.  To finish: \u00a0Warm malted milk with peanut butter cookies. \u00a0It doesn't get any more comforting than this, folks. \u00a0The malted milk is absolutely delicious (you'd wish you got a whole huge mug of it to take to bed with you!), and the cookies a sweet touch.   As if all this weren't enough, we were brought out a Tin Roof Sundae on the house. \u00a0We were all totally full, blood sugar out of control, but somehow managed to devour it. \u00a0The intense chocolate sweetness with the salty peanuts and cool vanilla ice cream was a wonderful end to our \"meal\" (yes, our meal of DESSERT!).  I know this was a long review, but I really loved this place. \u00a0I will be back again as soon as I'm in SF again!",

We headed over to this spot despire her warnings that it was not all that. Let me say I don't think it's bad in and of itself, but we were definitely not feeling it. It was a very squealy 20something crowd (complete with bachelorette party in tiaras and sashes) and heavily female (and Asian, for some reason....go figure), which I guess makes sense since girls dig cake. Very slick and 'new San Francisco' for me, but the artwork was GREAT - nice job, guys. The dessert selection was tough, as I'm a purist and don't want any lavender-infused or honey-kissed melon bullshit polluting my chocolate (almost EVERY dessert had fruit in some form, and I like my fruit raw and fresh, not sullying my creamy chocolate indulgence - I realize this makes me a freak and this opinion is TOTALLY subjective). We ordered a coffee (I asked the adorable server if it was fresh and he assured it me that was and he wasn't lying, and this was 11pm, so big ups to the Candy Bar for that), a port (she said it was just OK) and the chocolate chip cookie thing and some apple pie-ish thing, both of which were OK.....but $10 for two ordinary cookies and a cocoa (it wasn't clear to either us from the menu that a hot cocoa was part of this dish) is a bit over the top for me. If you were born in the late 80s or - let me just catch my breath here - early 90s, this might be your speed, but for us jaded Gen X OG's, it wasn't what the doctor ordered.",

They said Strawberry Kiss or the Mango Tango Bellini which I got the Strawberry Kiss. My boyfriend got the Lychee one (I uploaded a picture of how it looks like). For dessert there was so much to choose from and seems so tempted to taste all of it. But I got the Honey - Almond Panna Cotta (berrys, vanilla pudding sliced up, scoop of chocolate ice cream, and caramel powder - took a picture). My boyfriend got the Strawberry Limeade (strawberry mouse layered with vanilla cake and caramel cream on top of strawberries - took a picture). Taste good huh? IT WAS!   It made the night perfect.

The bartender was helpful in finding me a nice chardonnay and the bday girl loved her riesling, though it came in a very tiny flute ($11).   On to the sweets: \u00a0The baked Alaska was unavailable, as was their only mixed wine cocktail. \u00a0 We were not offered a tasting menu.  Chevre cheesecake ($8)- turned into a puddle after sitting at our table for a mere five minutes. \u00a0We spooned it up like a soup, which I assume was not the chef's intention.  Warm vanilla cake ($8)- really enjoyed this, especially the contrast of the pickled mangos with the cake.  Chocolate brioche ($8)- tasted like a molten chocolate cake, easily our favorite of the night. \u00a0Inventive to pair with a balsamic ice cream.  Cheese plate ($11)- three types cheeses, a bit of bread, and fig paste. Two of the cheeses were very similar, though enjoyable.  Small annoyances: Given the food options, we'd assumed Candybar to be more lounge than bar-like, and yet there really isn't much seating or tables. \u00a0How do you eat dessert standing up? \u00a0The lounge area had small coffee tables at an awkward height, difficult for eating and couldn't even fit all of our dishes. \u00a0  Wines by the bottle were quite overpriced- a few in the $250- $300 range, but many more were $70+. \u00a0 \u00a0   The place is brand new and I hope their issues will be worked out soon enough. \u00a0  The desserts are actually quite interesting and delicious, definitely making Candybar worth a visit.",

The desserts here are light and not overbearing, and don't hit you like a ton of bricks! They're artfully done, and there's board games to boot! I dig this place a lot, and would come back the next time I'm in the neighborhood.   The boy ordered the chocolate fudgesicle. I have to admit, I was a bit concerned by the idea of caramelized corn nuts, but they were pretty good. I'm also a huge fan of vanilla ice cream, and that was good here. But I didn't pay too much attention to what the boy ordered, because my order was pretty amazing. I got the nacho sundae, which sounds disgusting, until you actually see it in front of you. The \"cheddar cheese\" is mango slices, there's candied jalapeno, and the \"sour cream\" is horchata ice cream. And the nachos themselves were like sweetened crackers with bits of sugar on them. I was astounded. It looked like nachos (served in the red basket and everything) but everything was sweet! It was delicious. I also had the Strawberry kiss, which was pretty much what I wanted after having a sample of dessert wine at Bar Crudo. It was delicious and sweet and reminded me of having Fragolino in Italy, something I've wanted to have again since, but haven't been able to find.  They also have Candyland (which I've never played, and tried to this time and failed because there were no instructions) and Connect Four, which kept us busy until our orders came. We came on a Thursday and it wasn't crowded at all. I love the idea of this place, and I think it's executed pretty well. I just wish it were a little closer to where I live!",

We happened to come in for the last 30 minutes of happy hour so we were able to try the Jasmine Sparkle and the Strawberry Kiss on the cheap! The flavors of both drinks were subtle (maybe a little too subtle on the Jasmine but perfect in the Strawberry) and the bubbles made the drinks fun!  For dessert, we tried the sampler for two: we got to choose 4 desserts from the menu to share. We had the Strauss Yogurt Cake, Apple a la Mode, Lemon Tart, and the Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semi Freddo. The standouts were the Lemon Tart and the Yogurt Cake. The flavors were balanced delicately and perfectly. I thought the flavors of the Semi Freddo dish were a bit muted and the Apple a la Mode was way too sweet for my palate. (Fair warning: my palate is geared more toward rich and creamy, not sugar-sweet.) Overall, I was terribly impressed with the desserts and I cannot wait to go back and try some more!  We grabbed a game of Battleship and ordered another cocktail: the Passion Fruit Delight. I was worried the passion fruit syrup would be too sweet but to my happy surprise it was perfect! (Passion fruit is my favorite!) We had a lot of fun playing boardgames though the dim lighting made it difficult to see at times. I wish it was just a tad brighter in the room. I love, love, LOVE the asian-inspired art on the walls and the open, contemporary decor. I look forward to coming back with my hubby, playing games, and sipping more cocktails. One word of warning, and maybe this is to be expected, many of the games were missing pieces or instructions so once we landed on a complete game, we were wary of switching to another. Of course, we just started making up our own rules to the games and that was fun too!  Candybar is fun, romantic, and would be great for a date or a night out with the girls. Check it out!",

I sampled a few rounds of goodies: \u00a0Brioche Beignets with Spearmint Sugar, Cornmeal cake with sticky carrot and cheese crema, and the ice cream and sorbet selection (Mint chocolate chip, Ginger and Dolce de leche). \u00a0The beignets are tiny, but authentic (minus the New Orleans' style powder sugar) and the carrot cornmeal cake was out of this world. \u00a0The ice cream arrived in mini mason jars and supplied about 2 spoonfulls each between three people. \u00a0I hear they completely overhaul the menu every month and I can't wait to sample some sugarplum, gingerbread holiday goodness in December.  Under normal circumstances I would rate this place a solid three stars (mainly since I didn't have any wine and cannot comment on the pairings), but the service was outstanding. \u00a0What a nice group of people. \u00a0 Two different chefs came out to greet us and the waiter chatted us up. \u00a0The warm and welcoming atmosphere will secure a second visit from me. \u00a0 In addition, I think Candybar would be an awesome post-dinner date stop in the neighborhood. \u00a0You know what they say, \"Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker!\"",

The inside is great. \u00a0Extremely intimate, warm, and swanky with its deep red walls, and suggestive art pieces.   Everyone seems to mention the parking issue. \u00a0Who drives in this city, anyway? \u00a0Especially on a weekend night!   Anyway, we arrived at around 9:15 on a rainy Saturday night, and were told it would be about a 15 - 30 minute wait. \u00a0So, we loitered inside until our names were called, promptly 15 minutes later, and were taken to a small table. \u00a0The table - most of the tables - are a bit small for the featured board games (which they have plenty of - good ones, too) - they might be better suited for cards or something. \u00a0There were about four larger tables / booth areas near the entrance - perfect for games - which may require a reservation.  I can't say the service was warm and friendly. \u00a0Our guy, as well as the host were a little aloof and disinterested, but oh well.   Roommate ordered the lavender honey creme fraiche semi freddo, which I took a bite of - delicious. \u00a0Her friend ordered the chocolate financier cake, which was good, but I didn't find to be spectacular. \u00a0She didn't love it either. \u00a0And me, having eaten 3/4 of a pint of Ben and Jerry's earlier that day (no, I'm not depressed, I was just craving it, okay?!), i opted to just get the jasmine sparkle: champagne, jasmine, and lemon. \u00a0It sounds tantalizing, doesn't it? \u00a0Well, it wasn't. \u00a0It just tasted like sweet champagne; I didn't taste even a hint of jasmine or lemon.  Overall, a great place that I highly recommend. \u00a0Perhaps their other cocktails are a bit better, or maybe you should just go for something simple, like a glass of red wine with dessert.",

It was a great place for a date or with large groups. I've taken probably 15+ people there to try it out over the years. It's been a year since I've been back, and I took my girlfriend who has never been. We were ready to order, but were ignored for a good 20 minutes as the staff walked back and forth seeing that we were ready but not acknowledging us. I get it, it was busy and I have worked in the service industry so I understand, but 20 minutes is excessive especially when you are looking at us and just waiting around. The desserts have definitely gone down in quality though. We got the sampler ( you get to choose 4 to try) and here's the breakdown:  Our macaroons came out stale for the ice cream sandwiches, ice cream was melted, apple pie and semifredo were okay (nothing amazing from what I remember the first time I had it). The only thing positive was the torte: it was delicious.   It was after we were finished and decided to play games that we were given the bill and the staff basically stalked our table to hurry us along. We were then asked to leave because people were waiting ( probably 15 minutes after I had paid). I have never had that happened to us before at Candybar. \u00a0 Maybe we had to keep buying more stuff in order to stay or they changed their policy where if you pay you have to leave. I understand it is a business, but next time, tell us if you just want to make money. It saddened me because I have never had this happened at Candybar and I don't think I will be coming back. I don't want to support local businesses that will do that to their patrons.",

    "review_text": "I am quite familiar with dessert lounges having been a patron of Extraordinary Desserts in San Diego for many years now, but I realized I've never come across a non-Asian dessert place in San Francisco. The idea of a dessert lounge removes it as the last course of a meal and changes it into a piece of art as much as it is the centerpiece of your dining experience. Candybar (which I later realized was also a play on words), has alcohol, sweets, art, and even boardgames. But, be prepared to wait, because this place can get busy - we waited half an hour. One thing I didn't like about this place was the informal living room style seating arrangements. The coffee table and the Ottoman benches were way too low, which led to stiff necks and sore backs. But, let's discuss the desserts.  I ordered the Japanese cheesecake and tried two other desserts. I was curious to find out how it was different from your typical New York cheesecake and found the Japanese version to be a lot lighter and airy. I can only describe it as a cheesecake-flavored angel cake. The graham cracker crumbs were a nice contrasting touch. I could appreciate the champagne granita technique, but didn't think it went together with the cheesecake. The guava sorbet was also really good and one of the smoothest (both in texture and presentation) sorbets I've had. I also tried the strawberry limeade, which essentially tasted like a strawberry shortcake in a jar. I also had a bite of the green tea macaron, which was part of the ice cream sandwich. That is probably the biggest macaron I've ever seen, which was cool to see as part of an ice cream sandwich. The mango tango bellini was also very refreshing to wash down the desserts.  I loved the presentation on all the desserts and I thought the portion sizes were also good. This place is a great after dinner date place to go to, but they have to raise the comfort level of the seating and tables for their taller patrons.",

I really want to take the girls here actually lol. We ordered some tea with our dessert. We order the sampler with 4 different dessert. The bf ordered the peanut butter something.. and then the ice cream sandwich? I didnt like any of it.. I got the pie a la mode and the lavender something... I forgot the name but its the one that everyone else is talking about lol. But the pie a la mode was not bad.. and I REALLY like the lavender one. It was deliciouss. My bf didn't like it much though. His favorite was the pie a la mode. But I think I would stick to one dessert next time. Having 4 different dessert on one plate isnt such a great idea once its melted. It was sorta disgusting lol. Overall, I wasn't impressed with the dessert... but I definitely would come back bc of the great service and the ambiance. We also started playing board games... then we saw 2 other couples got up to get their own game started. =) Overall, its a great time, and Candybar is something different and enjoyable.",

After waiting about 30 minutes for our party of 8 to be seated we got a prime seat next to the window. The place is quaint but very comfy, they have dimmed lighting, popping music (loud), and a huge array of drinks and desserts to choose from. We ordered the Peanut Butter Jelly Time, Strawberry Limeade, Apple a la Mode, Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwich and Carrot Cake to nosh on. We also ordered several strawberry kiss cocktails, blood orange cocktails and some soju shots.   The desserts were exceptional. They were sweet and decadent and just exuded with amazing flavors. My favorite by far was the macaroon ice cream sandwich, which had blueberry ice cream smashed between two chewy macaroons.  The drinks were good, but the blood orange cocktail was a bit bitter for my taste, but again that's a personal preference. The drinks in general were great! Most of the drinks on their list seem to be made with wine or champagne, which may be a downer for those looking for a stronger drink.  Parking is very hard to find. At times we would have to drive around for 15 minutes just to find a spot 3 blocks away-- but hey it's SF that is the norm.

It happens, and you want to call \u00a0 date police. \u00a0   so Grasshopper, Confuscious say   \"Start with dessert on first date, if no GOOD, lossi ONLY Few Dolla\"  While parking was brisk, a spoonful of panna cotta calmed the senses. \u00a0I wish I had a Smart Car.  Embedded between residential houses on Fulton Street, the dessert paradise is easy to miss. \u00a0  As the son of entrepreneurial parents, co-owner Tan Troung left corporate America and opened Candbaar, the \"first San Francisco dessert lounge.\" \u00a0At thirty three, Troung graduated from San Francisco State University and was in the marketing field. \u00a0Together with co-owners Derek Chan and Chris Frey, their concept was to create a meeting spot that resembles a living room for desserts and drinks. \u00a0  The ambiance is a stage short of high-end. \u00a0The urban paintings on the wall, dark mahogany tables scattered around the room, and candlelight display create a romantic and cozy setting \u00a0Weather you're busy \u00a0playing board games with friends or reading the latest coffee table- top book, the ambiance is friendly with a splatter of sexiness. \u00a0The best seat is window side where patrons can dabble in chocolate mouse while perking on passer bys. \u00a0With soft indie rocks in the background, the space is fit for a great after dinner spot. \u00a0  While the pros of being his own boss includes doing something that he has full passion towards, the young entrepreneur admits that cons include not having a steady paycheck, no health insurance, and no scheduled vacations.   His best advice for hiring reliable employees is to find people that you enjoy being around and not just looking for experience.  \u00a0  A mound of shoe-string fennel, the smoked sturgeon salad refreshed the palate. \u00a0Miniature beeries add sweet tones and compliments the fluffy lemon cr\u00e8me fraiche. \u00a0Arriving in a nutty burnt cheese crust, the sweet onion apple soup was the comfort dish of the night. \u00a0Infused with apple cider, the full bodied soup balanced richness with a dash of tartness. \u00a0  Artfully presented in a straight line, beef boulettes swimming in thick juiced carrot finished the savory course. \u00a0Made from angus beef, boulettes lacked tenderness but instead the robut beef taste played center stage. A glass of Stonehaven Sparkling Rose from Australia ($8.5) paired well with our dishes.  Trekking to the main attraction, the chocolate mousse ($8) alerted the senses with a creamy rich texture. \u00a0As a temperature contrast, a peanut butter ice cream added nutty notes. \u00a0The buttermilk panna cotta ($8) exemplifies the new play on dessert: sweet n salty. \u00a0With frozen grapes sprinkles on the side, a few dashes of grey salt balanced the custard dessert. \u00a0My favorite dessert is the apple pie ice cream ($8). \u00a0Served with a triangle pie crust, the deconstructed apple pie ice cream contains all the flavors found in the all American dessert.  Service is attentive including frequent plate changes and water being refilled. \u00a0With a mouthful of mousse and dancing around moves on a board game, the lounge is worth a visit.  * I also include some pix * Note: I met Tan at the Elite Fashion Show Event. He was serving up some killer dessert that night. rock on!",

I walked in and was sorely disappointed that the place was..just kind of a cheap hang out.. did not really rival my favorite dessert places of SF or LA.. it's kind of just a teens and young adults lounge, with old boardgames, loud music, cheap alcohol and kind of not fantastic artwork. I just turned 20, why isn't any of this cool?   We waited an unfathomably long amount of time to get seated. While I waited I watched the bartender pouring heavy syrup into champagne glasses, which I assumed was supposed to be cocktails, but it came off as kind of cheap and icky. Needless to say, sitting near the bar turned me off to all the cocktails.  By the time we got seated I still wanted to give the place an unbiased chance. Just because the beginning was rough doesn't mean the desserts were bad. The waiter comes around taking our drink order, I find the one drink I actually want .. something they cant ruin with syrup or carbonation.. Port! Of course they were out of that though. Whatever, dessert can still happen without that. We skip drinks, order our desserts. Panna cotta with balsamic and strawberries and tiramisu..My absolute favorites. They deliver promptly (cool!). I take my first bite of Panna cotta and almost choke on the balsamic vinegar. I had to fight the urge to not instantaneously spit it out. \u00a0I try another bite, my eyes watered, something was soo off.. We tried mixing up the layers of panna cotta to this mush to try and make it more edible, but it was still disgusting.  The tiramisu? Nearly inedible. Seriously bad. The rum (?) flavor burned my nose it was so overwhelming.  I wasn't sure if they were just having an off night, or if the staff had something personal against us..but I decided it was more then likely option C.. They were trying to kill me. the dessert made my bf and I quite nauseous and later I got some sort of stomach bug..  How did candybar fuck up dessert so bad? Q_Q",

And I got a little tipsy. \u00a0But hey, if the drinks are cheap and i probably won't be back for a while.. I might as well.. \u00a0As far as the red velvet, it must come pre-made because the hubby didn't like coconut and asked for it without it, but that couldn't be done. \u00a0It was a small piece for $9 and kind of dry. \u00a0The coconut was good though. \u00a0As far as the drinks, totally worth happy hour prices. \u00a0I had the blood orange bellini which I read was to be good, but I thought this was just ok. \u00a0The strawberry kiss didn't have much of a strawberry flavor and tasted like plain champagne but it looked really pretty. \u00a0And the red sangria was just ok as well. \u00a0But what i dig about this place is that you can relax, play connect four, read books which are provided, and just hang out in a good atmosphere. \u00a0And because happy hour prices rock.",

    "review_text": "I was visiting friends in San Francisco one rainy night and we had decided to play board games after dinner. There was one issue we all had a craving for something sweet and a few cocktails. My friends had brought up a place that served only desserts and cocktails, plus they provided board games for entertainment. It was a no brainer, we were walking through the door of Candybar a few minutes later.  I was pleased with the initial impressions of the restaurant. A nice crowd had gathered to escape the rain and socialize. The restaurant was divided up into a bar, lounge, and restaurant style sitting. We claimed a section of the lounge to ourselves and began looking over the menu. One of my friends had visited Candybar a few weeks ago and said there were a few changes to the menu. Right away I realized that this place gets creative and changes their menu often with the ingredients they have at hand.   As we waited for our dishes we placed an order for cocktails. I was not pleased with the concoction of red wine and coke, neither was the person next to me who ordered to the same thing. It seemed that everyone else at the table enjoyed their cocktails of sparkling wine mixed with mango sorbet. \u00a0  We ordered several dishes and I had mixed feelings when they started to come out. The presentations of the dishes were appealing and everything looked tasty. I dug into the Apple a la Mode right away and discovered it was over powered by cinnamon. We ordered the Candybar Hot Chocolate and if it wasn't for the homemade marshmallow the dish would have been a bust. It wasn't until the Peanut Butter Jelly Time landed in front of me that I found myself in diabetic heaven. A great chocolate tart and peanut butter cream to lay the foundation topped with an amazing grape jelly and blackberries. Great dish and I would highly recommend it. I believe they also offer gluten free options.  It was a little difficult to signal the attention of the staff to clear our plates and empty glasses. We had finished and begun to set-up our game of RISK. It wasn't until I began to stack the glasses that someone rushed over to clear the table. It also seemed difficult to keep the water glasses full. This may have been that it was close to closing time and the staff was in their recovery phase from a long night of service.  Overall I enjoyed the restaurant. Mainly for the ambiance and the peanut butter and jelly dessert. The board games for guest is a cool concept and it could be a great date spot after dinner. I would suggest NOPA since it's down the street, or you can do dessert at Candy Bar and then a late night dinner at NOPA. You can see your dates competitive side in a fun casual environment and flirt at the same time.",

My boyfriend, our friends and I picked a board game from the nice selection available there to play while we ate our dessert and drank. It was such a chill and nice way to spend time with friends.

I couldn't tell you what exactly to get, but I would suggest trying a bit of everything each time you go. They have plenty of artwork around the walls to hold your attention and a lot of board games available. My suggestion, head over to Little Star Pizza for dinner, Candy Bar for dessert/drinks and then enjoy a concert over at The Independent.

Allowing us to pair the gingerbread soft ice cream with the chocolate was generous, but I recommend going with the mango yogurt ice cream for truly refreshing flavors.

It's made significantly different than a western style cheesecake. Get your facts together if you're such a serious \"yelper\". In addition to my rant, the Japanese cheesecake actually isn't as spongey as it normally would be in my opinion, I feel it's quite moist for a japanese style cheesecake. It's like a cross breed of Japanese and western cheesecake, like a sexy mixed Asian/White girl.   Also I've heard/seen people stating that the buttermilk vanilla bean panna cotta is sour and or tastes bad/expired. It's made with a balsamic VINEGAR reduction. It is written in the menu. Read.

Although the prices aren't: $48 (pre-tip) for 2 drinks and a shared dessert plate?!?  Go with low expectations and a Groupon, or don't go at all. Sorry Candybar.... :-(",

We got there just in time to miss the Kung Fu Taco happy hour or I would have eaten the hell out of some duck tacos.  I'll list the disappointments by magnitude.  The bread pudding was $8 and no one liked it. Daniel really got excited when I read someone praising it on my iphone yelp app; it seems he'd been craving bread pudding for some time.  The red velvet cake was covered in coconut and came with a small scoop of vanilla for $9. The coconut completely overpowered the cake so I have no idea how good it was. It was a pretty small portion as well.  The Ice cream trio was the best of the bad; it's three truly tiny scooplets of ice cream for $5. They weren't bad but considering that there are many really great ice cream options in The City now it seemed fairly pedestrian.

The cocktails were good- I tried the raspberry delight and strawberry champagne. We ordered the cupcake trio (chocolate cakes with assorted icings) and devoured it while I kicked ass at Connect 4 (they have tons of boardgames). It was no Kara's cupcake but still really tasty.

We shared: the cheesecake- wonderfully rich perched atop a crisp nutty hemp seed brittle with blackberries, and mango sorbet. the chocolate cremeux cake- a dense bittersweet chocolate cloud of heaven topped with a tasty black currant sauce and a dollop of thyme ice cream. When did they start stocking decks of cards and board games? (Yahtzee, CANDYLAND, and UNO) I didn't notice the shelves on my previous visit, but this was a fun way to flirt a little and interact.

One that really stood out, was the giant french macaroon with ice cream as the filling. yes. sounds orgasmic? well it tastes even better! I learned that you cannot go wrong with trying something new here.  Great selection of wines, fairly priced. They also have a sweet cocktail menu. Their cocktail concoctions are also delicious, a bit sweet for me, but oddly leaves me wanting more.  Diggs:  I seriously need one of those credit card sized flash light magnifier things they sell on them mid-night infomercials to read the menus here. It is dim. So dim i can barely see my friend across the table. However, I gotta admit, this place reeks of romance. Perfect place to take your special/temporary chick on a very special/impressionable date.   They also got board games!   Dimly lit bathroom to either do the dirty dirty or just the dirty.

We had a Groupon that let us get two desserts and two drinks for $17, which was really a great deal. The desserts tend to run around $10 each and drinks are about $8 each. The drinks are definitely not worth it. They're nice, don't get me wrong, but they were not very strong and were mostly just sparkling wine drinks. The desserts were a much better deal in my opinion because they were incredibly well done.  We got the tiramisu and the flourless chocolate torte. The tiramisu was heavenly. The mascarpone cream was perfectly done; it was a gigantic piece as well (more than enough for two people). The texture was super light and quite possibly my favorite thing of the night. There were some coffee-esque crumbs and a sheet of chocolate that really topped off the whole thing. The flourless chocolate torte wasn't quite as impressive, but it was still quite good. I mean I enjoyed it, but it paled in comparison to the tiramisu.  Seriously though, go for the dessert (tiramisu rocked my world) but not the drinks. The drinks are probably ones that you could make at home... and they're super weak. Might go back... but $30 (had to pay the tax/tip on the night obviously) for drinks and dessert is a bit too much in my opinion. Go if you want to impress, but it's definitely not an everyday thing!",

Dessert wise, our group ordered two: Peanut Butter Jelly Time and the Ice Cream Sundae. The sundae was tasty, and not overly sweet, which is something that usually turns me off about desserts. The Peanut Butter Jelly Time was pretty awesome, though the tart was a little too rich for me.  Drink wise, I'm usually drawn to blood orange anything, so the blood orange cocktail kind of called out to me. It was a little too sweet for my liking, but it did the job.

    "review_text": "Candybar is a dessert bar located on Fulton and Divisadero. If you don't know it's there, you might not be able to find it. I discovered this place while searching for a new dessert place to try. What caught my eye was all the pictures of the elegantly decorated desserts, the cocktails, and the concept of playing board games while eating and drinking with friends.  I've been to Candybar a few times and each time, I ordered something different. This last visit , I ordered the Red Velvet Cake and a lychee guava martini. I loved the cake. It was a huge slice. The red velvet cake was moist and covered with vanilla bean cream cheese frosting and shredded coconut. On the side of the plate are toasted marshmallows. The entire dessert was very delicious and it's one of their larger portions. Most of the desserts here are cute but relatively small, which is to be expected from a place that specializes in desserts. I thought the lychee guava martini was just okay. There was a single lychee sitting at the bottom of the glass. I didn't really taste the flavors of lychee and guava so I was a little disappointed with my drink. \u00a0  Overall, I thought it was a fun experience. The service was pretty good. We were seated and served pretty quickly. The atmosphere is perfect for a date. They keep the entire place lit with minimal lighting. Each table is lit by a small candle.   I recommend this place to those who enjoy a good dessert. It is a little on the the pricy side so look for the Groupon/Living Social deals if you're not sure this is your type of place. But I know I look forward to returning to try more of their desserts and drinks.",

    "review_text": "I'd been meaning to check this place out for a while because it sounded interesting. It's pretty solid all around, but definitely has a thing or two to improve upon. It was nicely crowded on a Saturday night. Not too crowded, but not too empty. Waited about 10 minutes for a table for 2.  Drink: Michelada.  I've had great Micheladas before (Tacolicious in the Marina, for example). This was not one of them. I felt like it technically fit the description but I think if the bartender actually tasted it he would make some adjustments to the way they make it. In particular, it had a lot of ICE in it, which is highly questionable considering it's a beer based drink. The Ice melted just a little bit and killed the carbonation of the beer. At that point the drink was worthless so I didn't finish it beyond halfway.  I understand that many people like to make their Micheladas with ice, but I'd either consider using less ice or just having well-chilled beer and glasses on hand...  The PassionFruit/Chocolate mousse dessert with vanillabean ice cream was fantastic! As good as I would expect from the best restaurants in the city. I definitely recommend it and this dish gave me faith in the overall quality of what this place offers.  The velvet cake with coconut and mint ice cream was a bit disappointing. I think this cake would have been much better off without the coconut. Perhaps it could have been artfully placed to the side or as a bed for the cake. A lot of people really don't like coconut so I think having the option of including it or not would be good. The mint ice cream was cool in the sense that it was REAL mint (not your mint-chocolate chip ice cream from safeway), but at the same time it lost its novely and felt weird in relation to the flavors in the cake. Still, I appreciate the effort in doing something a little different. The cake itself was so-so, it was hard to appreciate it under all of that icing and coconut.  Since I only tried two items and one drink, I'm not going to ding them too badly for it. Overall I thought the place was really cool. The people and crowd were nice, the board games were a nice touch, and the ambiance/style of the place was really cool and unique in general. I hope things work out for this place, but I have to wonder how it is turning much of a profit based on what it does. Fortunately for CandyBar there really aren't any direct competitors in the space, so I'll be back again for a post-dinner drink.",

    "review_text": "The environment is very lounge(y). Most of the walls are lined with open booths, with a couple tables and chairs in the center. The ambience has that classy upscale lounge vibe. Just walking in, there is a sweet scent that wafts by, further confirming its presence as a strictly dessert oriented establishment.   The menu is somewhat seasonal, with some menu items being replaced every season. However, the menu layout is simple, giving descriptions that easily allows one to identify which item is which and what it is made with.  Our party ordered the following:  -Lavender Honey Creme Fraiche Semifreddo with Nutella Powder/Almond Brittle/Cantaloupe  The semifreddo had a distinct layering of flavors comprised of the flowery lavender, the sweetness of the honey, and the chocolatey nuttiness of the nutella powder. The almond brittle added a nice crunchy texture to the semifreddo. Unfortunately, the cantaloupe was a bit overpowered by all the other flavors and textures that was in the rest of the dessert. Complicated but delicious.   -Strawberry Limeade with Strawberry Mousse/Vanilla Cake/Calamansi Cream/Strawberries  The presentation of this dessert reminded me of a parfait with layers of different elements and flavors. When each of these layers are combined together, it is reminiscent of a light and airy strawberry limeade. A light and refreshing dessert.  -Apple a la Mode with Hazelnut Crust/Cream Cheese Filling/Caramel/Gingerbread Ice Cream  Essentially a deconstructed apple pie. The cream cheese, caramel, and gingerbread ice cream ensured that the pie was rich and decadent. The hazelnut crust provided a great nuttiness and crunchy texture to the pie. The caramelized apples helped reinforced the fact that this was, indeed an apple pie. Only complaint is that the dessert was slightly too cinnamon(y). Overall, this upscale version of apple pie was fairly delicious.  -Big Francesco's Tiramisu with Coffee Chiffon/Chocolate and Rum Mascarpone Cream/Coffee Bits/Chocolate  The tiramisu seemed to be a fusion of a traditional Italian tiramisu with a typical Asian-style cake. The tiramisu was mostly comprised of the coffee/chocolate chiffon instead of the traditional ladyfingers, with a relatively small layer of the rum and mascarpone cream. The rum and mascarpone cream lacked the richness of the traditional mascarpone cheese and the strong booziness of the rum. This may or may not be a negative thing, but for me, I prefer the rich creaminess of the marscapone cheese and the booziness of the rum. The coffee and chocolate bits were more of a flourish and didn't add much to the dessert. If anything, this dessert was more like a light cake with the flavor of tiramisu. As a dessert, it was good; as a tiramisu... not so much.  - Flourless Banana Torte with Pineapple/Peanuts/Chantilly/Vanilla Bean Ice Cream  The flourless banana torte had a very smooth texture. The overall flavor and texture of the torte actually reminded me of Chinese mooncakes with the flavor of lotus, but without the heaviness of the mooncake. The peanuts helped add a crunchy texture to the smooth texture of the torte. The pineapple helped add a slight tartness to the overall sweet richness of the rest of the dessert. The ice cream helped ensure that the rest of the dessert was able to remain relatively rich.  Overall, the desserts were all relatively good and well balanced. None of the desserts were particularly too indulgent and rich; all of them being well constructed with all the flavors trying to work well together without being too overbearing. A great spot to come with friends or a date.",

A cute spot to take a potential date.  They have a central shelf that holds a bunch of random board games (Candyland, Connect-Four, Chutes n' Ladders etc). It's a great way to relax and have some fun while you enjoy your bubbly and sweets.  The dim lighting provides a classic ambiance and the walls are filled with inspirational artworks.  I would have given this place 4 stars except the dessert portions are rather small for their pricing. Don't get me wrong, the dessert tasted good, but I was expecting it to be better, especially at $10 or more a plate.",

    "review_text": "When I heard about Candybar, I was expecting to walk into a place a little more well-lit, for some reason. It was actually not very well-lit at all - house lights were turned down and the flames of tea candles were burning brightly. But Candybar is actually still a happy place with a lively atmosphere. Who doesn't love dessert, drinks, and board games (Yup, you read that right - BOARD GAMES) with great company? I love the concept of a place that only serves dessert and cocktails. As a before or after-meal treat or just to satisfy your sweet tooth, Candybar not only provides a decadent variety of items to choose from, but also a comfortable and trendy environment to share them in, whether you're with a date or with a small group of friends.  I bought a LivingSocial deal sometime last year that entitled me to two desserts and two drinks. I took my best friend out last night so I could finally use it. The host seated us in a section where we were sitting a little bit close to two other couples, but it really didn't matter since we were all minding our own business. The place looked full at around 8:30PM when we arrived. My friend picked up the ridiculous but fun \"Would You Rather?\" card game while we waited for our drinks and dessert, which we played even when our dessert was ready. I ordered the Passion Fruit Chocolate Mousse and the Raspberry Delight and she ordered the Peanut Butter Jelly Time and Mango Tango Bellini. I was very happy with the dessert and drink I ordered! The mousse had the perfect texture and flavors of both chocolate and passion fruit and the coffee ice cream was a bonus, though I think I could've done with a little less of the chocolate cookie crumble. The Raspberry Delight was pretty much just raspberry sparkling wine but it paired well with my dessert and was quite lovely. I also got a taste of my friend's Mango Tango Bellini and the flavoring was just perfect.  Seriously though, whoever thought of including the shelf of board games here is a genius. I'm a sucker for board games, so to have them available in such a unique spot gets a thumbs up from me. I saw Battleship, Sorry!, Connect Four, and cards for the 80s edition of Scene It! amongst others, and my friend and I grabbed some decks of Uno cards when we were finished with our desserts. Who says you can't have some kiddie fun when you're having adult beverages?  Furthermore, the decor and interior is pretty snazzy - lots of sensual and pretty art pieces all over the place. Even the bathroom wall is emblazoned with that \"dreamers and musicmakers\" quote by Willy Wonka. (Sorry, I forget the exact wording of it and I'm too lazy to Google)  Though personally, I'm not jumping out of my seat to go back so soon but if I find a good reason to, I definitely will. Everyone should come to Candybar at least once to relax and treat themselves and the special ones in their lives!",

We happened to come in during their happy hour specials also, so we were able to get a few extra drinks economically. The service was kinda slow, but we we're able to keep ourselves preoccupied with games - (new deck of) UNO!  Our drinks slowly trickled out, and unfortunately they were nothing special... very generic juice+champagne/mimosas (tip: pass on the strawberry kiss). Desserts are (pretty?)gastronomical, but also nothing to write home about - you're better off ordering dessert where ever you had dinner, or saving your money and just having games/desserts at home. The whole place is very lounge like, and very dark... I prefer bright places, especially if your drinks are weak and you expect us to play UNO - so is this blue or green!?   Overall, for what they put out and their prices... its not worth it. Not to mention slow service... when our check finally came, the waitress was also, for lack of another word, slow - she discounted the 2 cheapest drinks/desserts ordered within our party... so needless to say, we had to \"set her straight\".   TL;DR: Cute lil hangout place, but really nothing special. Save your money and enjoy your game/dessert night IN.",

After you've completed that first over coffee or tea date and have broken the ice aka you two have both accepted that there might actually be some chemistry and you're willing to test the waves further without launching or maybe launching into the commitment of a dinner date a nice restaurant beforehand, you should go to Candybar...only if you want to impress her, she really likes cocktails, desserts, board games, or a combination of the three, and she likes cutesy young (aka has lots of people in their 20s) places.   It's the chance to hold her and warm her up outside while you wait for your table inside. Cuddling is usually good unless your date doesn't like being touched.  It's the opportunity to hold her hand on the table if the table has room with the board games, desserts, and cocktails on it. Romantic candle light, anyone?  You could even play footsie underneath the table and start warming up for that first or second good night kiss at the end of the night or middle depending on how you roll. \u00a0  Good luck!

Service was friendly and good with follow up. I ordered a strawberry kiss (sparkling wine with a frozen strawberry), which was sweet. The 50/50 soju drink is really good--tastes like those orange cream drinks!  I had the sampler (4 desserts) which is WORTH IT. I don't know why you'd spend $10 to eat a regular portion of one dessert... The sampler is perfect for trying a bit of 4 desserts (and they're adequate portions) cause you get to try different tastes and textures. I ordered the strawberry limeade, lavender honey creme fraiche semi freddo, big francesco's tiramisu, ice cream sandwich. YUMYUMYUMYUM!  I'm actually not a huge dessert fan, but some flavors that I love include lavender honey, mascarpone cheese and liquor, and almond flour (macarons)  Strawberry limeade: the waitress recommended this, and it wasn't my favorite out of the 4 items ordered, but it was light and the strawberries on top gave it a fruitier \"healthier\" taste.  Lavender honey creme fraiche semi freddo: pretty delicious! This was smooth and flavorful and not too heavy  Tiramisu: one of my favorite type of desserts. They do a pretty good job, but I like my tiramisu brandy-heavy, and this one did not live up to standards. However, it was incredibly smooth and still tasty!  Ice cream sandwich: they did a really good job with the macaron cookie part. It was fresh and chewy. The sorbet on the inside was good, but I feel like it would've tasted better and more macaron-ish with ice cream instead of sorbet.",

The service staff is friendly and well-versed on the desserts and wines they serve, but they're *very* unorganized. \u00a0You'd think that with 3 different people taking our orders and serving our table of 12, things would be spot-on, but it may actually have contributed to the chaos. \u00a0All 3 were getting confused about who gets what, forgetting forks, not refilling water or bringing new water glasses for our late-arriving guests, not removing finished plates, even forgetting an order (mine).  But my Fourme D'Ambert panna cotta \u00a0with caramel dates and little, warm, mini cinnamon toasts along with the great company that night was enough to make me forgive the disorganization, the $30. bill (just for my dessert, a half-pour paring and a glass of wine) and the 20 minute parking-spot search, but not forget.

Rather than treating her to dessert first then head to a bar for some drinks afterward, what better place is there to take her than a somewhere that serves both :D. Thanks to Yelp, I was able to find Candybar. So this is exactly where we went.  Parking was such a hassle! We arrived at around 8:20 pm and found parking at 8:50 -- 6 blocks away from our destination. We didn't mind the short walk but when its raining, and you have girls wearing heels, that's a different story hehe. Anyway we arrived at Candybar around 9, leaving us with only 1 hour to chill. Tan greeted and seated us right away near the back of the bar/restaurant.  Each of us ordered a drink and a dessert. I had the Jasmine Sparkle (Sparkling Wine, Jasmine, and Lemon) $8 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MMZxpqVRF2YWQc08-VxQ?select=kKMGuFwUPxJLXsr3jUsxkQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MM\u2026</a> and Carrot Cake (Walnuts, Currents, Bruleed Bananas, and Salted Caramel Ice Cream) $9 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MMZxpqVRF2YWQc08-VxQ?select=TucCG2mEu1CWpIe9ImjoBw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MM\u2026</a> for dessert. The Birthday girl Phoebe had the Strawberry Kiss (Sparkling Wine, Ginger Ale and Frozen Strawberries) $8 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MMZxpqVRF2YWQc08-VxQ?select=nzQAL5vGbisQWmg9o16Jlw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MM\u2026</a> and Chocolate Mousse (Mango Sauce, Roasted White Chocolate, and Milkey Way Malt Ice Cream) $9 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MMZxpqVRF2YWQc08-VxQ?select=7pHj0jpTll3SqPEGbr9kMw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MM\u2026</a> \u00a0Stephanie had the 50/50 (Soju, Orange Soda, and Vanilla) $8 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MMZxpqVRF2YWQc08-VxQ?select=dXYt11T9aPUD2FWgveboTw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MM\u2026</a> and an Apple a la Mode (Hazelnut Crust, Cream Cheese Filling, Caramel and Gingerbread Ice Cream) $9 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MMZxpqVRF2YWQc08-VxQ?select=ELj5T432ZrMBomQ7TVXdwQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/n9MM\u2026</a>.  I thought there wasn't anything special about the Jasmine Sparkle. I was hoping there would be at least a hint of Jasmine or Lemon in my drink but unfortunately there was none. Stephanie's 50/50 on the other hand was my favorite. It was sweet and creamy and kinda tasted like a melted Orange Creamsicle. There weren't much alcohol in it however.  The Carrot Cake and Salted Ice Cream went very well together. None of the elements overwhelmed each other and it definitely looked like one of the \"healthier\" choices on the menu. I wouldn't mind ordering this again.  Overall, I'm glad both the girls had a great experience here and I would recommend Candybar for any occasion. Parking may be a bit on the hard side, so wear comfortable shoes just in case ladies!",

As for the sweets - the table favorite was the blood orange baked alaska and split between the chocolate brioche and the milk chocolate parfait as the 2nd fav. \u00a0If you like salty sweet, you'll like the parfait. \u00a0The panna cotta was a bit pungent since they used fourme d'ambert - (bleu cheese). \u00a0Others liked the vanilla cake but I thought it was a bit eggy. \u00a0There was also the chevre cheesecake which was a deconstructed cheesecake as there was no crust and just bits of crust sprinkled on it and wasn't cake or cheesecake at all in texture, but it tasted good. \u00a0They brought an amuse for everyone which was very light and refreshing and ended with their version of milk and cookies - warm malted milk in a cute little cup with a peanut butter cookie.  For the wine we ended up starting with a Pinot and ending with a Gewrztraminer. \u00a0We were having a hard time deciding and they let us sample a couple different ones before deciding on our bottle, but sadly they were out of the bottle we wanted.  3 1/2 stars for now - I'll return again to see if we can bump the review up. \u00a0Yes it's new, but the servers should still get a lesson on the wine list and the difference between them all - it's great that the owner knows the wines so well, but maybe some tips to the servers on their differences would go a long way.   Overall we had a nice time and since it was mid-week we were able to enjoy the space and our conversation at a leisurely pace. \u00a0We didn't play any of the board games but I was definitely eyeballing \u00a0the scrabble board.....next time.",

The drinks are not strong at all, and I think that's one of the reasons why this isn't a 5-star review. For the price you're paying (~$7-10) for the mixed drinks on the menu, you'll probably need at least 3-4 to feel gooooooood. Trust me, even their lemon drop shot was quite weak. Then again, Candybar is not really a bar bar where the main purposes are for people to drown their sorrows or make men bolder and women looser. This is also unfortunately why Candybar closes earlier than a lot of the other bars in the city.   However, the concept of Candybar is pure GENIUS! I mean, who doesn't love board games, or any other group-engaging activities. This place is definitely fun if you want to have some fun while eating dessert at the same time. Side note: not all desserts are made with alcohol.   Parking can be a pain in the butt since it took me 35 minutes to find parking. But I think everyone should experience Candybar at least once!

We tried walking in on a Friday night since they told us that they did not take reservations for parties of 2. \u00a0NOT true! \u00a0Make a reservation! \u00a0It was packed and the wait was 45 minutes, so we put our names down for Sunday evening and came back 2 days later.  No reservation was needed for Sunday evening. \u00a0It was empty. \u00a0Lucky for us! \u00a0We ordered the Apple Pie a la Mode (hazelnut crust, cream cheese filling, caramel, gingerbread ice cream), the Passion Fruit Chocolate Mousse (chocolate cake, tuile, passion fruit curd, vanilla bean ice cream), and a mango sorbet bellini. \u00a0  I started with a bite of the Apple Pie a la Mode. \u00a0Oh. Em. Eff. Gee. \u00a0My eyes rolled back in my head and I was speechless. \u00a0Candy Bar served up the best apple pie of my LIFE! \u00a0The hazelnut crust was absolutely to die for, people! \u00a0It was crumbly and delicious and just perfect. \u00a0The combination of brown sugar, cinnamon and butter was absolutely mind-blowing! \u00a0We both agreed that it was an outrageously good dessert and for me, that's what makes Candy Bar a 5-star place. \u00a0  The passion fruit mousse was very nicely done. \u00a0It was definitely the more aesthetically pleasing of the two desserts we ordered and the tart citrus of the passion fruit nicely complemented the dark chocolate shell. \u00a0  The mango sorbet bellini was pretty good, though we both thought it was a bit strong. \u00a0Not going to lie, \u00a0I was kind of fascinated by the scoop of mango sorbet in the drink. \u00a0I thought it was a nice touch and it gave the bellini a creamier texture that I appreciated. \u00a0It took it from just a regular mixed drink to a dessert drink. \u00a0The mixed drinks at this place look amazing, btw! \u00a0If I was more of a drinker, I would have been in heaven. \u00a0  All in all, I loved Candy Bar! \u00a0The ambiance is terrific and it would be a great place to take a date or to go for a girl's night. \u00a0The red walls and art work give it a warm but sultry atmosphere. \u00a0And let's not forget the board games! \u00a0I've been looking for a bar in the city where you can play board games for awhile now (yes, I'm kind of a nerd), so I was absolutely stoked when I saw that they have a decent collection (though truth be told, I did not peruse the title and cannot therefore speak to the quality of these board games).",

I know that it's such a small thing to notice, but the candle that was on our table looked a little sad because it seemed super short in the wax... it was so itty bitty =(  Anyways, I ordered the semi freddo and the mango tango bellini, while Mr. Face ordered the ice cream sandwich and the jasmine sparkle. It's unfortunate to say the least that I didn't exactly dig everything.   I felt that my drink was on the strong side. Maybe I'm just too much of a weakling when it comes to alcohol as I drink very little, but I didn't taste much of the mango and I got made fun of because Senior Face said that I kept scowling at the glass. His drink was ok... didn't seem special to me. I downed my drink when he said to even though he didn't finish his... punk.  As for the desserts, they were very well presented. My semi freddo looked nice, but I loved the simplicity of the chocolate smear and the blueberries for the ice cream sandwich. They didn't wow me though... The semi freddo was only good when every element was consumed together; I'm the kind of person that enjoys things more when you can enjoy every part together AND separately. Otherwise, the semi freddo was reminiscent of soap and the brittle tasted a little burnt. I wonder if something was with my taste buds today? Something about the ice cream sandwich faintly reminded me of play-doh.   It's a good thing I didn't use names because as we waited I kicked Mr. Face's butt playing connect 4... 2 or 3 times in a row. We'll prob come by a couple more times to try other things before I figure if I like it or not... I say I because he's not as picky as I am. Good thing I had the Groupon, as it gave us a good deal... I don't know how I would have felt about the experience if everything was full price.",

    "review_text": "The winning factor in this place is not, as you would think, the desserts. I would say the defining quality is hands down the environment. The desserts are just ok but they are not over priced so just ok is... well ok. The specialty drinks are not very strong and little high dollar but they have other stuff that compensates it nicely. But the experience itself is worth the trip. The room is fun and lively, the walls are peppered with interesting and exciting art, and the bookshelves are chocked full of classic and new board games for you to enjoy. \u00a0It is a go and chill out with you girlfriends kind of place for sure.",

    "review_text": "It's our annual Christmas eat-fest in the city and I remember Lindsey R. raving about Candybar. And being a fellow Yelper and a fellow fat girl... I took this as an invitation to try this out. I mean the answer is simple, if you dare to cut out main course, appetizers, salads and soups--what is there to complain about?  My True Religions started crying as I felt my ass expand, just by grazing over this menu. It's a great concept, very chic and inviting. The board games are a nice touch as you graze over an excessive amount of calories placed in front of you. My chocolate coma eventually made me greedy in Connect 4 and I just couldn't do it anymore. The portions of desserts is varied, things are laid out beautifully... art on your plate and art on the walls.  It just sounds like a 3-hour Weight Watcher themed opera. The notes hit higher when you feel the cottage cheese erupt on your thighs. How many points, is this?   But who gives, it's dessert. Just open wide.  The dessert choices change monthly. The choices itself looked adventurous in the ingredients, I remember basil, frozen cranberrys and melt-away lime (?) so do come with an open mind. But really choose what appeals to you. I had a Baked Hot Chocolate with homemade Marshmallow, because it ripped off the menu and waved at me in the face. When it came out it was like a 6-year-old's version of a souffle, it was great. The marshmallow is overwhelming on top, but that's your invitation to dig. The chocolate purposely already on my spoon (as a part of the presentation) is a nice touch to the dish.  After trying to purge on it, I secretly thought in my head that the Barefoot Contessa or Paula Deen would come out and show me how much butter was in my dessert. But then I realized I was just drunk.",

    "review_text": "I was really excited when I heard about the opening of this place. For those of you who live, have lived or just have a general interest in NYC and the great restaurants there, you might have heard of Chikalicious.  *clicky* <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york#hrid:7JTY8uk4_1SPOIEi8eOF8g\">yelp.com/biz/chikaliciou\u2026</a>  I fell in love with Chikalicious and I wanted to fall in love with Candybar just the same. But unlike my love at first site experience with a little fru fru gangsta, it just didn't happen with Candybar.   I called in a reservation for 7pm on Sunday for 4. I asked if wine parings were offered and was delighted to learn that they were. After a light meal at Papalote, we made our way down to CB and were politely greeted and seated. The table was a bit too big for the space and poor Tiffinie was on the traffic side. I would say poor me since I was pinned against the wall, but since I'm small, and i have an freakishly strong bladder, I didn't mind.   I love the decor of this place. Simple with a splash of color. Tiffinie commented on the lighting over the bar, stating that she liked it and everyone nodded in agreement, until I mentioned that it reminded me of the light bulbs from the movie SAW and then Eugy shuddered. (he doesn't like scary movies)............  Some board games are provided for entertainment, but this didn't really make sense to me. The tables are on the small side and the plates are on the large side. Board game on the table with largish plates along with various glasses makes for an uncomfortably cluttered table. Not a good idea in my opinion.   A wine paring list was printed out especially for us since I specifically asked for it when I called in the resvy. That deserves its own star! I'm no good at picking out wine or bubbly anyway, so having the paring list made decision making easy. For starters, I had a Moscato di' Asti. I have always loved the muscat. The japanese muscat gummies are the best. Eat that and drink a sprite at the same time and it's almost like you're drinking muscat bubbly. Yum!   First we went for the savory items:  Scallop sashimi w/ avocado and kumquat - I loved this! The kumquat gave it a nice zing.  Pork terrine w/ pickled shallot, mustard, pickles and crostini - This was really good. Especially with the pickled shallot/mustard combo Duck Liver Mousse - Thanks to Tiffinie and Jeff (who I now openly restaurant stalk) I tried this wonderful dish for the first time. This mousse on crostini with wine? drooooooooooool~  On to the dessert -   Warm Vanilla Cake - Something sweet and warm was oozing out of this cake. SO DAMN GOOD!!  Chevre cheesecake w/ ice cream (i forget the flavor!) - This came in a bowl but had pretty much melted when it came to the table... Though it tasted good, wasn't happy that it came out pretty much in soup form...  As far as service, the host was super friendly and accommodating. Our server seemed a little aloof and took forever getting back to us with info on one of the wines that was on the pairing menu.   I understand that this place has been open for a very, very short time and that's why I was patient. Normally, I wouldn't have been so patient. But even despite the short presence in the restaurant scene, this place shows GREAT potential. I'm going to give it 6 months and come back. I hope by then, all the kinks will have been worked out.",
