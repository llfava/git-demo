    "review_text": "When I first mapped Rosewood on Google, it initially struck me odd that it's located in the part of Chinatown that has spilled over into North Beach. I also knew that parking was going to be a challenge. Luckily, the Parking Karma that I learned as a previous City resident came back, and I ended up on Green at a 90 degree slope spot. From there, I enjoyed the walk around, even though Rosewood is almost as hard to find in person.   What brought me to the City from the Burbs on a Week Day? Was I trying to escape the bar fights in Walnut Creek or the Oakland Occupy scene? The real answer is that my OCD-fueled fondness of writing reviews has a few privileges, even though I'm older and uglier than the target demographic. I was in fact honored to be at Rosewood as part of the inaugural Gogobot Pro class. And when you consider that there were lots of fellow Yelpers and least 2 past or current CMs at the party, its a small world for Real People and Real Reviews.\u00ae   There's lots of interesting twists and turns to Rosewood and what initially looks like a small venue has lots of room. During this party, the drinks and too loud music were up front, the photo \"booth\" was off to the side, while Pizza, Milk and Cookies, and a chance for quieter conversation was available out back. And when you put all this together, the party had a pleasant energy and flow.   I had a very nice time. Connie was back from Loopt and did a smashing job organizing the party and in her usual hard working and classy way. I spent my time nursing a gin-based \"Martinez in Bloom\" drink (courtesy of a friendly and very hard working Bar Keep), munching on square slices of Golden Boy Pizza, and chatting up travel adventures with various folks. One fascinating conversation addressed the \"spiritual work\" aspects of walking the Camino de Santiago for non-Catholics. Later on and as long as folks would listen, I enthusiastically promoted my ongoing participation in Climate Change-related volunteer trips with Earthwatch. Many thanks to Travis K. and his Gogobot Team for making all this possible!  The Highlight of the party however was the presence of Rene C., his wife Erica, and Joanna M. Only his MC was missing, of which Rene's lovely bride has graciously opted to let him dream and maybe sometimes make an ASS of himself. We had a great conversation which continued into the evening (with Joanna's friend MM joining us) at Park Tavern. It was one of those few times during the week when I wasn't in any hurry to have the evening end.   Gayle will sometimes ask: Who are these virtual friends of yours? Are they really friends? Have you actually met any of them? My answer is Yes and often involving very enjoyable situations both within and separate from a special event.",

I know Rosewood doesn't necessarily seem like the best spot for a wedding venue, but it was PERFECT! First of all Toni and her staff met with us about 10 times before the wedding. Then they totally accomodated a bunch of our wedding worries and requests.   The space is so unique with all the little rooms and the outside patio. Our guests had so many little areas to interact, meet new people, and mingle. It was great. We added a bit of mood lighting and some wall decorations and Rosewood turned in to our hip wedding oasis.  The drinks were strong and everyone felt very well taken care of. The service was friendly and top notch.   We can't thank Toni and her staff enough for making our wedding one of a kind and soooooo great!",

I guess that is all it takes to be a Gimlet, but without simple syrup, it tastes sad. Good to know next time I order it anywhere else, to make sure theres something sweet in there.  I remember reading that the bartenders were top notch on Yelp - and I would only go back to try something more complicated/interesting to see them really show off. But alcohol to me isn't as important as a great DJ. I don't want to drink to distract myself from the bad music - I want to drink to enhance something that is already bumpin'.

Bambi hooks up with 2 fabulous chicks at The Redwood room (back when it was cute and it was the place to be at)and decides to take the pretty ladies to make the rounds in North Beach. So after a few stops one of the ladies decides to call her boyfriend who by the way claimed to be a COP from Oakland ... really?more like a drug dealer... and decides that we all head to ROSEWOOD. \n  Now am a small guy and can't really take on a 6'2 giant by myself ... and really don't have much interest in making out with girls unless am drunk and the Manny in me comes out (that's the male Bambi... watch out ladies).

IF SO AM GOING TO CUT YOU RIGHT NOW...and pulls out a pocket knife pointing it on my chest and poking me...and of course the GF jumps in between... and Bambi is up and running to the door... without finishing the cocktail. \n  Now every time I go \u00a0to ROSEWOOD I get a flashback of that incident and I now I know what the ladies mean about very jealous obsessive,controlling, freaky boyfriends that they can't get rid off.

But anytime before 10 is normally a great time to grab a beer here and have conversations with friends. Grab a hoegarden or any other great beers on tap, and head on out to the patio. The patio is truly where it's at. It feels like you are having a drink on a patio between Brooklyn brownstones. It's intimate and cozy plus the bamboo creates a very tranquil and chill vibe.   For decent conversation and drinks before 10pm, Rosewood is pretty tough to beat. It's typically not too crowded then so you'll have space even for a larger group.

In fact it's almost easy to miss because it's right in the middle of Chinatown, but the experience I had there last night by far deserves a 5 star rating.  First off, I worked with Toni over email 2-3 weeks before my party and she reserved the front section of the bar completely free for my party of 20-25. We had complete access to the music so all my friends were taking turns plugging in their iPhone and playing fun tunes.   Toni had the place all set up with flowers, candles, and signs for my party when I walked in. In addition, the bar does something special where you're allowed to name 5 of the cocktails for the night and they change the menus for the night. I chose my 5 favorite male TV characters and it turned out to be such a hit... Especially walking around hearing people say, \"I'm having a Pacey Witter\" or \"What's in the Jesse Pinkman?\" ;)  By the middle of the night, the other private event that was going on in the back patio area ended early and the bouncers gave us access to the entire place. It was so nice -- a really cute outdoor patio with lights and seating, as well as another mini dance floor.   Everyone was so nice and warm, which is one of the best experiences you can ask for on your birthday. The bar was still open to visitors so that was also fun to get to know other passerbys who walked in and wanted to know what was going on. Hands down, one of the best spots to have a birthday. Not to mention, a spacious dance floor. (Note: the place is much more of a bar feel and not dance club so don't expect a packed dance floor but even 10 of us on the floor tearing it up made an amazing experience I won't forget).  Thank you Toni SO much for your sweetness! Best night ever :)",

When I was a \u00a0young lass living on her own in SF, Rosewood provided my friends and I with countless birthday parties, random Friday nights out, and just about any other celebration you can think of. Now that I'm older and don't live in the area anymore, I thought I'd be over it, or that it'd be different somehow. But I recently stopped in for a lark with some friends on a Friday night and guess what... it's EXACTLY the same. That's good and bad. The drinks are still good, the music's still good, and it's still easy peasy to get in. The only problem is that this place is completely dead. Why?? Don't people realize how rare it is to find a place like this without a line snaking down the block?! Add to that the large number of late night Chinese and pizza places within stumbling distance, and it's nearly perfect in my untrendy eyes. Oh well, more Rosewood for me!",

The sleek chrome beer taps and the 007-style furnishings gave you something to check out while you settled into a nice Vodka Martini, and the bamboo/pebble garden, when open to the public, was awesome.\n  But now wear and tear, like holes in the walls, show even in the dim orange light, and put a 'never' in front of the 'open to the public' -- 'cause you're pretty much going to have to rent the back room to get out to that garden.\n  Also, the place used to have this really cool cross-cultural feeling, with a sprinkling of everyone coming in -- this has been less the case the last few times I've been, which ups the blandness factor.",

It's easily one of the best options in North Beach for a Friday or Saturday night, it's so good that it's actually made me consider going out in North Beach more often. it's far enough from Columbus that you don't get the tourist crowd but close enough that you feel like you're in a happening neighborhood.  The music last night was a bit cheesy, lots of Michael Jackson but there's really nothing wrong with that. The dance floor is on the smaller side but a lot of people weren't up for dancing last night so it didn't cause a problem. I've heard there's an amazing outdoor area in the back but didn't get to check it out due to a private event going on.  As Sonia S. pointed out, they need more restrooms. There are currently only two shared between men and women and the line can get ridiculously long. The management should really just invest in a bit of a remodel, can't imagine it'd cost that much when the benefits are considered.  I'm sure I'll be back, hopefully within the next few months rather than waiting another 5 years to return.",

I could not agree more! For a very reasonable fee + extremely doable bar tab minimum, we were given a beautiful outdoor patio, our own bartender, our own dance floor/control of music, and a smaller indoor room to keep the cake/coats/etc.   Antonia was a pleasure to work with - she got as excited as I did about the party, and I really appreciated the smaller touches she put together (for example, stringing nice lights throughout the patio area, lighting candles all over, etc.). She also made a great effort to make sure the party remained a surprise, and work with us to make sure the party went exactly how we wanted it to. One of the biggest draws to the space was that we could choose five drinks to name after the guest of honor for our bartender to pour all night, which added a great touch (and they were pretty creative and tasty, too!).   This would have been five stars, except at some point in the night our bouncer (who was supposed to be keeping non-guests out and making sure the party remained private) ended up slacking on the job somehow. We started to notice a lot of people that no one knew on the patio, and had to get the manager/bouncer to ask them to leave. Minor snafu that was taken care of quickly, but still kind of annoying considering the party was supposed to be private!   All in all, I'd definitely recommend this spot to ANYONE looking to throw any kind of private/semi-private party in SF - such a fun and seamless night, and I hope to return soon!",

All that said, I had my farewell party here last Friday and it went off without a hitch, and all my friends had a great time. \u00a0I took a shot of well vodka at 1am and that was not so great, but hey it's a great near-to-last memory of SF. \u00a0Docked one star because they said we could bring an ipod, but the speakers weren't working so we were stuck with whatever the DJ was spinning in the main room as opposed to the mix my buddy put together.",

    "review_text": "I'm disappointed. I want to rate this place but I can't.   Courtesy of the extremely helpful Greg Lindgren, I set up a guestlist for Friday night. Granted, our list was 100+, so we had a fairly large crowd coming.   But as early as 10:30, I got a call saying that the bar was WAY too packed and there was no room to really move around. I was still at dinner at this point, handling the check slash hailing taxis to head over to Rosewood.   When we got the call, we moved our entire party to Medjool. We were told by the 20 people who had already made it to Rosewood that there wasn't even a DJ playing -- although I'm not sure if one showed up later that night.   I wanted so badly to love this place. Maybe I will go back one day without an entourage of 100+. I've heard such good things, the only downside is that it does get crowded pretty quickly on weekends. Which is to be expected when a bar is good.   So, just a warning to all though, it does get packed quickly. Maybe it's our own fault -- we were offered the opportunity to book the private room for $200 + $850 bar guarantee (it houses 40-80 people comfortably) but we declined that chance. Maybe if we'd just done that, we could have fit in a little more comfortably since our area would have been roped off for sure.   Oh well, there's always next time. Thanks anyhow, Greg! :)   3 Stars for now only because I'm a little bitter I had to relocate an entire party of 100+ when the bar hit max capacity as early as 10:30pm. I'm sure after I actually enjoy myself there, the rating will go up.",

Ideally suited for around 100 people, there's a lounge room with couches, a private bar area and the patio that is accessible through sliding glass doors. The staff, from the bartender to the doorman, was super friendly too.   I would definitely recommend contacting Jon (one of the owners) the next time you want to plan a party!

First of all, a big thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for putting up with me, my friends, and the Entourage that refuses to leave at 2a, even when you told us countless times you were closed. (I sincerely apologize- really!)  Rosewood is not what I think of when I think of North Beach. In fact, is this really even considered North Beach? I'm going to agree with my fellow Yelpers who addressed the layout of this place. The bar area is narrow and crammed, but beyond the bar lays a cute back patio, dance floor, and separate bar for private events. (At least I think this is the purpose of this bar- I don't know, I ventured back and forth between the two!) It's entirely possible to be in one place but have no idea where the rest of your group could possibly be. This place has the wackiest layout ever!  The bartenders and bouncer were nice enough- they don't particularly stand out to me, which could be a good thing, depending on how you look at it!  I do agree that they could use some additional bathrooms...as well as someone to make sure the inebriated men can figure out how to close a door. (Though this did make for a great photo!)

However, I had two very different drinks when different bartenders made them. Boo for inconsistency.  A lady bartender had the nerve to ask if it was okay that a piece of strawberry was in my drink?!? She then proceeded to say that it was in the ice bucket so it should be good. Are you kidding me?!?

Welles was a man to stand alone, to take a stand... but in Rosewood one can never stand alone. One can only stand in a crowd. In fact, it's less like you're standing, and more like you're suspended in the crowd and a moved around BY them rather than of your own accord...  The music is good, but you're never more than a part of the crowd here. Maybe I'll come back some day when trashed :-)",

The bar service is EXTREMELY slow. \u00a0I think there was one bartender working it? \u00a0EXTREMELY SLOW. \u00a0But, she was really nice. \u00a0Many of us got free drinks from her. \u00a0SCORE! \u00a0BUT REALLY, SO SLOW. \u00a0  The crowd was not really that diverse - perhaps its because my friend's birthday brought in 30+ Asian kids? \u00a0Probably not like that normally? \u00a0No clue. \u00a0  The bathroom line was impossible. \u00a0There's 2 stalls for everyone. \u00a0And the inside was disgusting. \u00a0But if you gotta go, you gotta go.

I just hosted a surprise party for my husband, and everyone at the party was really impressed by the private party space (which for my party included the entire outdoor patio space), the bartender and the rest of the staff. Several of my friends told me that they would definitely consider using Rosewood Bar for their future events.   The manager of the place, Doug, is very cool and very accommodating - during the planning stages he was available in the afternoons for walk-throughs for me and for my friend who was helping me decorate and during the evening he really helped with keeping track of the bar bill, helping with the AV, helping with clean up and making sure everything was OK.   My party had about 50 people at the peak time, and there was PLENTY of room including room for people to dance. You could probably go as high as 70 people without too much crowding.   The price was reasonable for such a great space and they did not throw in any extra fees or charges even though we had the sole use of a bartender and a door guy.   They were really good people and definitely contributed to the overall success of my party!",

Sure there's a dance room in the back...but if you're going there to get some drinks and chill, there's not enough space for you to just stand somewhere and not get squished and/or pushed around. I made countless 360 degrees turns because people around me were trying to go in different directions and trying to not spell liquor on other people.   On the upside, the drinks were pretty good. Decently priced, a bit on the expensive side. Bartenders are fast and efficient, but you can't escape the wait since there's ten other people telling one bartender what they want. They also allow you to use credit card / and open a tab, which made paying easier.   I would be open to try this place again, probably on a weekday night, and see how that goes. :)",

    "review_text": "Private party here? YES PLEASE!!  WOW, what an amazing experience at the Rosewood. I held my 25th birthday here and Toni, the event coordinator/bar manager, worked with us to reserve the front part of the bar for my party. For my semi-private party, we were allowed to customize the drinks with ingredients and names, control the music via Spotify, and provide my guests with a passcode to get into the event to ensure we had a closed guest list. This place has a dance floor and a pretty decent amount of seating if you feel like chilling on the side. Also although the guests from the other party had to walk through our party, I didn't feel like the guests from the other party invaded our event too much - or maybe they just blended well and I didn't notice! We had ~40 guests, and the place didn't feel crowded at all.   You're also allowed to bring in your own food! That's a pretty sweet deal.   If you're looking for a venue that isn't overly priced and has great service, look no further! The only caveat is that my friends had to taxi or drive to the location, but at least it prevented a lot of them from leaving before 12:30am, when the party was just getting started!  Kudos to the bar tender who immediately handed a towel to me when a drink spilled on the entire back of my dress.  Five stars for this location/bar, I would definitely recommend this place for future events.",

Every time I've gone to Rosewood, the back patio is being used for a private party. I've come to just expect that from Rosewood and this is quite disappointing.  Pluses: - Friendly staff - GREAT music (they will also change it to what you request if you ask nicely) - Fun dance bar/dancing space - Variety of drinks - Close to other bars and late night food (Golden Boy)  Minuses: - Back patio is basically not open to the public because there are always events going on  - The front of the place also gets used for private parties sometimes, which puts non-private party people somewhere in the middle  I want to go back but only if I can access the back patio - please Rosewood?",

She created a 1920's cocktail menu for me. \u00a0She reminds me of a wedding planner that is always at your side. \u00a0She returns my calls/emails.

The bar is cool and staff really friendly. Small place but its a cool space. Would have given it more stars had the promotions guy Doug not been such a douche. My gf spent days on end trying to get a hold of this joker about reserving some space for a birthday for her friend. We had like 40 people coming and wanted to see about cover etc. He assures my gf no cover as long as we send a list and that he would reserve a bunch of booths.   Guess what asshole your fucking bar doesn't have any booths. Just a bunch of couches along the wall. Also there is no cover charge. If that's the case why string her along like that stupid ass. Anyways the bartendar was good and it's cool spot. They actually have a nice space in the back which you can actually rent out apparently, since there was another birthday in the back which would have been nice to know. It's off the strip but the DJ makes it worth going. Hopefully he's the house DJ so you guys can enjoy the music like I did.",

The bar owner was extremely helpful and prompt in setting up a guest list for the night and the staff was SUPER nice to all of my guests. I'm from LA, so I'm not used to this good treatment from a bar. Usually, in Los Angeles guest lists mean nothing, and doormen give you so much attitude that you never want to come back, let alone throw a party at the venue. The experience at Rosewood \u00a0was the antithesis to the \"so LA\" attitude - it was fantastic.  The bar is perfect size to have a chill spot in the front where people can talk, and a small dance floor in the back where others can shake their asses. The night starts with really chill music that is not too loud so as to let your friends talk, mingle and sip martinis. Then by 10:45 PM, the DJ shows up and plays some fantastic hip-hop - both old-school classic Dre to the stuff they play on the radio today. You get 40 of your friends in this place, and you feel that the bar is entirely your own party. Thus, when we had over a 100, the place felt like it was totally styling. Rosewood is a perfect size to keep the crowd personal and comfortable, as well as allowing people to dance it up in the back.  I had such a good time that the event last night will be one of many at Rosewood. Thanks, Greg, for maintaining such a classy place from your venue to your wonderful staff. I'm sure that your vision for comfortable bars will make Rye just as fantastic as Rosewood. I'm looking forward to check out Rye as wee as your future bars.",

The tunes are always fun, often lots of hip hop.  The outdoor patio is a beautiful respite from a crazy evening -- HIGHLY recommended. It has a peaceful zen feel (tons of bamboo, gravel surrounding the cement path) with tons of candles, and plenty of nooks for stolen kisses... :-D  Major props to Greg L. for making Cassio and Julio's party such a success last week.

Only gripe is that one of the bartenders is drink sexist -- a friend of mine asked for whiskey on the rocks -- and assuming that b/c she was a girl, she didn't really mean just whiskey, so he made her a whiskey cocktail w/ abt 1/4 cup of agave syrup and a bit of orange juice....which is kind of different \u00a0-- and he continued to just say \"it'll be great\", even after she protested...by the time she got it, it was functionally just a glass of sugar on the rocks, so yes, it was tasty, but not a glass of whiskey.   Despite this slight snafu, if you have to go to North Beach, which I would always advise against, this isn't a bad place to get your drink on -- lots of seating, good music, though it can be hard to get the attn of the bartender when it gets hoppin. \u00a0Oh, and if you need to take a cig break outside, it's amazing people watching -- so many tiny girls in such tiny clothing! \u00a0It's kind of like watching a continual walk of shame...except for it's the beginning of the night?",

(thank you, yelp app!)  housed in between pet stores and dim sum on broadway, the front end of rosewood was deader than dead on this particular saturday night. i mean, one or two other people at the bar. and for such a well-lit space, it seemed awkward. and, it didn't bode well for our impending dance party.  as we went in search of the bathroom, we found a secret passageway to the back of the bar that led us to a thriving soiree. clearly, a private party. folks were mingling out on the patio and roofdeck (nice touch!) and chatting it up inside a beautiful little mid-century space where the dj was spinning some great funky tunes. we took it upon ourselves to start a dance party going, which, given the stares from the guest of honor, was so not cool. i mean, loosen up, girl! we met a couple other party crashers who were also freeloading off the vibe. not gonna lie, we had a great time.  i suppose this review reflects more on the snotty party girl than the bar itself, but if a party is truly a \"private party,\" they should make sure there's fun available for the non-partygoing patrons as well.",

I know I've b*tched about this before and I'll do it again, most bars in SF suck. The city has no ingenuity or imagination when it comes to bars. And if you can name the 5 you know that are cool you're only proving that the number of good ones can be counted. Not a good sign.   Anyway, this place IN Comparison, is decent. I do like the outdoor patio though SF nights are hardly ever warm enough to accommodate an outdoor venture. Another plus - the music is phenomenal. Wish people were dancing.. though that didn't stop us. So, will you be impressed with the d\u00e9cor? No. Will you like the music and will it, overall, pass muster? Yes.

Later on in the night when everyone was trying to close out their credit card on file the woman working the bar had NO idea how to do so or what to charge people. At one point she even handed the box full of cards to a group of people waiting to close out and said \"grab your card\".   That is so incredibly stupid and inappropriate for a bartender to do I couldn't believe it. People were literally passing around a box of cards and taking cards. When I complained to management after they lost my friends card they reacted horribly and proceeded to threaten to kick us out. In fact, a woman (presumably management) with short blonde hair referred to my boyfriend as a \"faggot\" and told us to leave.  I am not exaggerating when I say we were only trying to get our cards back amid the disorganization of the bar. I will NEVER go back to this bar. I cannot believe how we were treated and how they passed around all the credit cards for anyones taking to a bar full of people.   I would not recommend this bar to anyone and I will never return.

However, the drinks weren't that great (neither super tasty or strong) and they were expensive. The bartenders weren't the friendly or eager to help anyone, despite the large-ish crowd there for the trunk show. One bartender made a mistake to my friends credit-card tab, charging her $18 for one drink. None of the bartenders apparently knew how to do a refund on the register, which was odd, but they did give us two shots for free to compensate so it was cool they amended their error.",

It's hard to find when it's dark but a woman outside asked me if I was looking for the fashion show. So, I went in and asked the bartender if my card was there.

She went beyond my expectations to make my celebration at Rosewood so much more memorable (or as much as I could remember ;) haha).  Rosewood is on Broadway, but basically in the heart of Chinatown - walking distance to the Broadway strip - so it's not far off at all. When you walk in, there's the full bar and the main room is narrow and long, set plenty plush black, leather seating. This main area can be reserve for your private party as I did. In the back, there are private rooms, the outdoor patio and also the dance area. I loved the music selection here. Unfortunately, at the time of my event there could not be a DJ physically spinning but Toni was sweet enough to have the DJ create a pre-set playlist for the night! Normally, they'll be a live DJ spinning old school hip hop, r&amp;b, top 40s.. all the good, funky stuff!  The drinks were good and the bartenders were all super friendly!

Few seating chairs inside, small dancing area with a DJ. Another section of the place is in the back. It has 2 rooms, 1 standing room with a bar and another small separate seating area. Can definitely hold a private party back there. Outside of that has a lot of bamboos surrounding the seating area with dim lights and 2 picnic table style seating area. Felt like a tropical little corner. Wasn't too crowded which I liked. Mixed crowd in late 20's. I bought some shots for a friend's birthday and it costed me $9 a shot.   Parking: Street parking is sometimes hard to find around that Chinatown area but if you're patient, you'll be lucky. I drove around the block just once and got lucky finding parking just half a block up. But there is a parking garage behind that block, so it's very convenient too if you don't want to look for street parking.  Set back: Only thing I noticed was the flooring separating from the inside to the outside. Wearing heels, it can be a bit dangerous since there's an unpaved step. Someone can easily trip if they were drunk and all over the place.  Definitely going back there again!",

LA flashbacks!) but how this all comes together is that when at the rosewood anything goes!  You can take a quick look around the place an notice that everyone is doing their own thing and that somehow it all comes together perfectly. The jean and t-shirt crowd mixes well with people decked out to the fullest.   The place itself is very well put together with a bit of an upscale touch. the bar puts out some great drinks and i've never not seen a plethora of good looking women (on weekends at least). which in SF can be hard to find sometimes. i've always gotten the impression that you can go to this place at times and quickly realize that some 22 year old girl from san jose is having her \"big birthday night in the city\". so if you happen to be a person who finds those crowds to be annoying maybe this isnt the spot for you. but all in all ive never had a bad time here...",

The other guy was just pouring from the tap or wine bottle. The wait for cocktails was long. I ended up trying 2 drinks: Midori sour and vodka tonic. The Midori sour was average and it was mostly watered down. The vodka tonic was really gross - the lime didn't help.   The atmosphere was chill. It was crowded but there was plenty of places to sit - tables are chairs in towards the back. My group decided to sit by window in the front. As the night progressed, it got really hot and stuffy inside. So it was a relief to be sitting by the door where we had some fresh air. There was a small group of people dancing in the back.   The place is small and I would never know that it was there unless I was actually looking for it. A place to chill if there's nowhere else to go.",

Venue is located in the least expecting area. \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" clearly qualifies here. The interior is updated and classy. We reserved the two private rooms and the patio which was a bit large for our group but who doesn't appreciate room to breathe? Private bar to avoid wait lines was definitely a plus. We had a bar tab to meet ($1000) but that's cake when there's 40 people drinking in celebration. Outdoor patio sold me. It was lit up with lights on the bamboo and made it very classy and welcoming. Awesome set up!   Eric, our personal bar tender was outstanding. Lawrence our \"security\" is the friendliest security guy I've ever met; he tells you to get out of the private area with a charming smile. lol  Overall, I would definitely recommend Rosewood for a weekend bar stop and a great private party location.

There are only two (unisex) bathrooms, and I was surprised to consistently see more men in line than women. \u00a0Ladies, don't break the seal early in the night - the bathroom line is long... \u00a0  They charge $5 cover. \u00a0I know it's only $5, but I just don't think it's worth it because you won't be able to get a drink and will barely be able to move. \u00a0  Rye is soooo much better.",

Although I really appreciate the sympathy drink, I don't appreciate spending $4 on a PBR. Sorry about all the \"poor me\" talk, but I'm unemployed ya'll. I can barely afford to buy Ramen \u00a0noodles, so cheap beer has become seriously important to me. Because unemployed people have nothing better to do then drink...a lot...alone...while watching hours of America's Next Top Model reruns.  Yelp DJ Battleship 2.0 got my slowly plumping ass out of my apartment for a night to bump a little, grind a little, sweat a little, and have JT's bacon dog pressed against my back a little. It was all in good fun though. The staff are friendly...get it? staff? I mean, what?  The dance floor is slamming, and by slamming I mean drunk bitches body slam you into the walls, which I guess I don't really mind, because the wall just happens to be the most cooperative and unskevy dance partner there is.

I was surprised to hear that there was no cover charge or rental fee associated with reserving the private room in the back. Sure, their drinks weren't exactly cheap (average of about $8 to $12 per drink), but they were tasty and the ambience was wonderful.   I will admit though, I thought that the location of this bar was a little bit weird. I mean, it's on the edge of Chinatown. At night, nothing next to it is open at all. In fact, it's not exactly the best neighborhood to be walking around at night. That being said, also be very cautious of the main intersection there, as I encountered a major police trap there for no left turns, among other things.  Overall though, this is a great location to have a private party. I'm not sure if I would necessarily come all the way out here just for a drink since it's out of the way for me, and there are plenty of other choices. But definitely a good location for a private party. Would recommend if you're looking to entertain.",

You are like Tom Jones, overalls, mango and sticky rice, Whitney Houston - all rolled into one discreet North Beach package.  I love you.  That is all.",

What is up those stairs, what is behind that wall, what else does this place have to offer besides beautiful, people easy access bars, room after room of loungey vibe to dancing vibe, to both, to outdoor dinning? I don't know, what else is there? I want to know more. Alright so, I'm intrigued... But not completely satisfied.   We came here on a whim. I was tired ready to hop in bed when my friend talked me into checking this place out. When you are in the mood I was in, no place is cool and desirable to be at besides your warm bed. But this place pleasantly surprised me. I am looking forward to going back and partying it up.   For this night, I was only the sober observer, which in case normally would get a less than positive review from me, accept in this case.",

Here's why:   * while the venue is quaint and classic, it's narrow and the back room lacks seating and tables.  * or maybe that back area was meant to be the dance floor, but it wasn't very well thought out.  * music is hit or miss, but no real mixing beats.  * crowded, and takes a lil while to get your drink order in. (Having said that, the bartenders are friendly and have a good attitude in serving the masses.)   But here's what I do like about the venue:  * chill location, where it's not so loud you have to scream to be heard.  * no cover  * as mentioned above, good bartenders (at least at my last 2009 visit)  * very unlike the rest of North Beach's drunken debauchery even though it's just blocks away from it all.   Despite it all, it's still worth returning for a chill evening out with a somewhat mixed crowd and decent ambiance.",

I came here for a friend's birthday party and had no idea what to expect. \u00a0Another friend helpfully warned that the entrance is very nondescript, and it is. To find it, look for a place with no signage on a block without anything else open, but a bouncer out front.  Entering the bar it wasn't too crowded, maybe just about right. After saying hello to my friend I went to get my first drink, a gin martini, naturally. The wait was a typical for a bar, which is to say, too long. While waiting though I got to see several cocktails made, with more care than most places will put in, someone here is clearly making an effort at high-quality drinks. Everything is made with fresh juice and real mixers. My gin martini was correctly *stirred* and came with the twist I asked for cut right there from a lemon.  The interior is nicely done and the DJ was pretty good. The music was a little louder than I would have liked though, making it a bit hard to talk.   The only real downside is the crowd. It was a little too business school for my tastes, Marina-lite perhaps. But really this wasn't a serious detractor. On the up side of this downside, at least that crowd will actually dress up to go out. It was nice to be in an SF bar where 90% of the people *weren't* just in T-shirt and jeans.  OH, I almost forgot. They take credit cards, although no AMEX. I was in a bar where I actually opened a tab, that part was heaven. Note to bars: if you let me open a tab, I'm far more likely to start ordering rounds of shots (which I did).",

It's very easy to walk past, so count the building numbers as you're walking up Broadway. Great music, (mostly hip hop on a Friday night) and there was a birthday group there too that gave me and my friends free cake and ice cream! The bartenders are super friendly (my friend left her iPhone sitting out in plain view on our table and Toni (high energy female bartender with a blonde pixie cut) picked it up and gave it to me, saying she didn't want us calling the bar the next morning, crying over a stolen/lost iPhone).  They seem to have specialty drinks that rotate on some sort of basis and lots of other enticing libations to loosen you up. Free coat check too!",

We were greeted by a very attractive interior and bar on the left side that included a dj at the far end. The outdoor area is small but perfect for better weather when smokers want to get their fix.

The place was full of well-dressed, attractive and approachable people, although my date and I pretty much spent most of our time getting to know each other.

We walk in and as the name suggests Rosewood is plentiful here, lining almost all of the walls. \u00a0It was a great night of drinking and dancing. \u00a0The narrow layout made it a bit difficult to navigate to the bar when the place got packed, and the place was like a furnace unless you went out back to the very nice bamboo garden.

I was there for a private party in the back room and would definitely go back for another private party but would be more hesitant on a regular night as the dance floor is ridiculously tiny and the bathroom line is ridiculously long as is the wait for a drink. The back room, however, is perfect. Lots of space to socialize, dance and get a drink while not being shoved around. The outdoor space makes the back room that much better (more ventilation, makes the place seem bigger than it is) as you wouldn't expect a bamboo courtyard on Broadway.

Their bar looked so cute from the window, so we decided to go inside. The guy at the door was so nice! We walked inside and it was pretty empty, but the venue was adorable!! They had a private event going on, which wasn't very private at all, but it was set up with candles and roses. And the outside patio with the lights and trees is just so amazingly romantic!  I absolutely fell in loveee with this place. My birthday's next week and all I kept thinking about was, \"Damn! I wish a place like this existed in LA so I could do my birthday here!!\"   ROSEWOOD PEOPLE, PLEASE, PLEASEEEEEEE MAKE ANOTHER BAR IN THE LA AREA!! I think Silverlake would be a great location. PLEASE!!!  PS. I'm still looking for a place down in LA to do my birthday, if anyone has any suggestions of places that are similar to Rosewood, please let me know! Thanks!  PPS. One bad thing though, there wasn't a live DJ and there were breaks in between songs where the music completely stopped and everyone on the dance floor stopped dancing. \u00a0I still had fun and danced my ass off, but a live DJ or a better playlist would've been nice.",

This is a small little touch that goes a long way in making the party feel personal! * We got to control the music on the dance floor! \\ * When we walked in, the place was beautifully decorated with balloons and candles.

The minute we stepped inside the warmth was tangible. \u00a0The front room is wood paneled (fake, by the looks of it) but somehow maintains a classy rather than 80's basement look (you know what I'm talkin' about East-coasters).  We arrived early to set-up for a special birthday celebration and so the place was empty and candles were still being lit. \u00a0The private area is spacious - two rooms, a bar and patio access (the patio is candlelight and bamboo gorgeousness even if there is a shower ventilation window right above). \u00a0We decorated with some lights and pretty paper on the wall to liven up the private areas. \u00a0All the staff - from the bartenders to the bouncer were friendly and helpful - even moving furniture to set the ambiance. Yummy drinks \u00a0- ask Benito to mix up something special for you! \u00a0There was also an Ipod set-up for the birthday girl's playlist.  Rosewood is nice for a drop-in situation and awesome for private parties!",

    "review_text": "randomly in the middle of chinatown, when walking down the empty streets in the middle of the night, you would never notice that this place is a bar. WHen you walk in though, it's pretty nice and you definitely feel like you've walked out of chinatown and walked into SOMA or Union Square.  Cute little bar, pretty classy. Given, only time I've been here was for a private party and the back room is perfect for that. It's a cute back area with a patio (given there is no lighting outside so rather dark but nice nook if you want to get away from the crowds). There is not a separate DJ in the back though, you have to provide your own music. However, there is a separate bar in the back; given they don't stock it fully so there was some issues of having to go back and forth between the front and back bars because they had to keep transferring goods for us.   Definitely had a good time; however, it is kind of out there and again in the middle of Chinatown with nothing around. So unless you want to hold a private party that's going to last, I'd suggest going elsewhere. I haven't gone here just to go to the bar, so not sure how it is on other nights, because let's be honest. The private party in the back made up about 40% of the everyone in the building.",

Good times, so check it out without fear if you have a reason to be here.  Cheers!",

    "review_text": "So i've had 2 completely different experiences here. One thing I've learned, keep your eye open if it's your first time: the door is hard to fine. Find the large unmarked modern looking rosewood door, with the word \"rosewood\" in metal cutouts above, squished between the normal scrubby looking Chinatown structures. \u00a0It is strangely located in Chinatown, because when you walk in, it feels as though you are in a completely different area.   Environment: Modern looking, very neatly designed. Front area has the bar, little areas to lounge around in. Then a dance floor, proceeding to the back are more areas to hang out. A patio too! The dance floor with the usual \"club\" music mixes...along with mini tables dimly lit with candles.  People: WAY busy on a weekend night. Too many partiers here. Seems like a more snobby-I like to party all the time crowd. Bar- ran out of cups?? So we had to wait.   Visit 1: It was for a private party. We were located in the back, so I had a leisurely time.   Visit \u00a02: Way chaotic in there. Bf couldn't stand the crowd-he was just scootchin by and an ignorant male bystander decided to ask him why he was trying to touch his butt. There's 1 inch of space to move around in, what do you expect? Waited way too long for the bathroom. Got pushed by by a VERY drunk girl in rags stumbling all over the floor, which she proceeded to the bathroom to throw up. Then as she walked out she was dragging her body all over the floor. Then threw up right in front of my bf. good call.   Experience could've been better. I think that night was way too crowded, and I believe on a more slow night, a casual relaxing time would make the place more pleasant. So overall, average, but nothing to really be thrilled about.",

My cousin organized a birthday party here and, Toni, the manager left no detail unnoticed to make sure her event was seamless. She reserved the front part of the bar (which is huge, complete with an almost private dance floor) for us - signs, candles and custom drink menus (that she was able to choose the names for in advance) were framed throughout the bar. They let us know in advance that we'd be able to be completely responsible for music, if we chose to do so, so we were able to make playlists on our iPhones in preparation for her event at Rosewood.  The bar itself looks quaint from the street and can almost be overlooked, but once you get inside it's completely renovated and classy. There's a beautiful outdoor area and private section in the back that seems perfect for a private party or event.  Thank you, Rosewood, for a great night!",

Broadway between Powell and Stockton - that's all I could remember. \u00a0  Luckily, now that I've got my new LASIK vision, the inconspicuous entrance of Rosewood could not escape from my sight. It was there, middle of the street. We were tempted to just run across the street. We were just so happy to have finally found it. Wouldn't it have been embarrassing to get there, park the car, wander up and down that same block, only to give up and go home?! And then - the next day, read about everyone's great time? \u00a0  I truly believe that one's experience anywhere is altered by the company. And I've found that any time I'm around a large group of crazy Yelpers, there is much fun to be had. \u00a0  We got there super early because I didn't want to stay too long. Of course, that threw itself out the back patio when the people started pouring in, and the drinks were pouring themselves! TOO MUCH FUN.  Seriously though - attentive bartenders, comfy leather seats, itty bitty dance floor, back patio, cheap Chinese food within walking distance. And if the party gets a little crazy in THAT sorta way, there are places to go just a few blocks away - NOT.",

So, I went last night and immediately noticed that the furniture had been moved so that all of the couches are now against the wall. Ok, it makes more space for the bar area, but it really didn't matter because it was so empty last night at around 10pm. \u00a0Not really noticing any difference, I ordered my usual, a french martini. \u00a0#1, they didn't have pineapple, which is a key ingredient... #2 they used pomegrante liquor instead of chambord and #3 they changed out their martini glasses for this curvy and MUCH smaller pseudo martini looking glass that more closely resembled a curvy margarita glass. My friend was so angry at me for bringing him to this strange place that we both didn't finish our drinks and left. His drink, a cranberry vodka with a splash of pineapple (but no pineapple) tasted like a freaking postage stamp. \u00a0So, what happened? After this dismal experience I probably won't be back, unless I absolutely have to go, plus it's off the beaten track. Oh and the music was just weird weird weird...",
