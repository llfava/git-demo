Let me counts the way, of my dislikes of Savoy Tivoli:  *It was so loud and crowded that you could not carry a conversation.  *They allow smoking in the Patio, so be prepared for second hand smoke.  *The drinks are expenses and they are so watered down, that your better off just getting a water it's cheaper.  *I have seen better restroom facilities in third world countries. For the amount of money that they charge for drinks, you would think that they would have money to address the restroom situation, it's disgusting. Maybe we can have a fundraiser \"Save the Toilet at Savoy Tivoli'\"   * I could go on, but I will stop at this point, believe me after visiting Savoy Tivoli, you might need to have a drink to forget this terrible experience.   I am giving \u00a0Savoy Tivoli one star, just because it's on Grant, a wonderful and fascinating street.",

My pals and I got here a little early, around 9:30 or so, and we just beat the crowds of people. We were able to snag two tables in the back, which the others quickly filled up by 10.

Not that I have particular problem with that (hell, I think I fit into that demographic on occasion), but I was keenly aware of the multitude of \"bros\" staring each other down - perhaps in some primal ritual to determine who can claim superior brovosity.  My biggest beef with Savoy is the obnoxiously scientific and exact method of providing mixed drinks. Ask for any kind of cocktail, and they will pour exactly one jigger of booze into the glass before filling the remaining 90% of it with soda water, or tonic, etc. I don't know a ton of bars that actually measure out drinks like that, but pretty tasteless for a joint that claims to exude an \"old-time\" feel - I'm fairly confident that old-time saloons would at least top your drink off.  Savoy can be fun, but drink before going and stick with the beer, as it's the best bang for your buck.",

We had wandered over to North Beach and were looking for a place to grab a drink or dinner. \u00a0As we walked down the street we heard this incredibly jazz trumpet playing somewhere up the block. \u00a0As someone who grew up around jazz musicians, it sounded too good to be live so I just assumed it was a bar that had their doors and windows open. \u00a0As we approached Savoy Tivoli it was this AMAZING and LIVE jazz band playing right inside the restaurant with all the windows open and a lively (and very diverse) crowd of people enjoying the music.  This band consisted of between 5-7 older men (like 70+) who seemed to have played together for years. \u00a0These guys were UNREAL. Not only were they totally entertaining the crowd with their funny stories from playing in Boston jazz clubs in the \u00a050s and 60s but these guys possessed a raw talent that I have not seen in a long, long time. I was sitting there in awe thinking how lucky I felt to have stumbled into this bizarrely wonderful scene in the middle of North Beach on a rainy Saturday afternoon. \u00a0  So moral of that story - GO ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON and pray to god that you see this wonderful group of men perform. \u00a0  As for the venue - weird place. \u00a0Looking at other reviews it sounds like it's a pretty happening bar later in the night? \u00a0I did see the sign advertising $2 shots...   It's a pretty large space - includes pool tables, two LARGE bars and plenty of tables. \u00a0The bartender (bald guy....forget his name) was fantastic. \u00a0We gave him barely anything to work with (except for a \"something less sweet than a Manhattan\") and he made our cocktail dreams come true. \u00a0Not to mention this guy was being incredibly friendly to some tipsy older women (looked like the jazz band groupies) and manning the bar himself effortlessly. \u00a0We were almost tempted to ask him to sit down with us just cause he looked like a cool guy.   All in all, this is one of the best SF experiences I've had.... the live jazz was just a scene on its own and something I'll definitely try to revisit again soon.",

The music was terrific. Stick to the beer, and $6.00 per beer is fair considering you can listen to this wonderful music. This is S.F.- high rents, and taxes, and proprietors have to make some profit! \u00a0It's a pretty huge place and gets packed during the performance. There is also pool tables in the back.

You can have a conversation with someone special or bring a group of twenty some odd people and get rowdy. be careful though, this place can blow up or resemble a funeral depending on what night of the week you go (sometime it just depends on what time you go too.) The patio is nice on most evenings plus its heated. The bottom line is that there are plenty of places in the City that are far worse and this is one of the better spots just to hang out. If you want to meet girls you don't already know then i suggest a place that's a little more clubby. The drinks suck though which is why it gets the three stars. Most times the drinks are small and contain very little alcohol. If you can stomach it, order a Knob Creek or a Crown Royal on the rocks and just beat the system that way. The pool tables and fussball are good time killers as well. Just be sure you know the names of the girls playing your buddies in fussball before engaging in a game of grab ass. Hey, we all make mistakes. In the end, I will actually go to this place willingly which more than I can say for most City bars.",

Was this the infamous \"Marina scene\" people talk about? Old Abe's been around, seen the inside of many pubs in my day; clubs, bars, you name it, but never have I seen such snobbery in my life! So it was crowded, and I made my way towards the bathroom in the back, \"excuse me\" and excusing myself along the way, and NOT ONE person, male or female, budged and inch. I even got dirty looks from people. I'm actually standing there, saying excuse me, some chick snubs her nose at me, doesn't even bother to FAKE a shuffle. And this happens with every single person I say excuse me to, about 9 or 10, on the way to the loo. Seriously, these are the people who give SF--America I should say--a bad name.

Bartender: \u00a0hey, don't you dare talk to me like that. \u00a0I'm the bartender, how dare you swear at me Me: \u00a0you skipped me...three times.

Does he not realize he's the purveyor of a substance that causes over 50,000 deaths a year? I'll let a doctor warn me. Hell, I'll even listen to a priest, rabbi, monk, or shaman. But you're a bartender. Chill the fuck out.",

There is ample seating and three pools tables that you can generally commandeer if you're feeling a little patient. The main bar has an open front that is great during those rare warm nights and plenty of heaters on the more common cold ones.  The bartenders are a little forgetful and when it is crowded there are not even close to enough of them. This seems crazy because they probably have more actual bar square footage than 95% of other bars in the city and should be able to handle crowds pretty well. Great for a chill Thursday night, but not the best on a sloppy Saturday.",

I feel like the crowd is a little hit and miss depending on what nights you go. \u00a0Been in there plenty of nights to see friends I haven't seen in years and have had an awesome time, but occasionally you'll find many a douchebag dudes in there just staring at you for no reason with this look on their face like they want you to just say something wrong so they can pretend to be angry. \u00a0Its pretty funny actually. \u00a0One time we played a couple random guys that were either shitcanned or were just of the super-douche breed. \u00a0They were probably around 25-27 years old, but had the mentality of a 12 year old. \u00a0First off, these guys looked like they were dressed to be in some club in LA, \u00a0were cheering for every missed shot we had, (I was pretty drunk so had a few of those), and looked at us like we were speaking a different language when we tried to just start up friendly conversation. \u00a0What made it worse was we actually lost to them because my friend and I were way too drunk to be making any shots. \u00a0I'm still pissed about it to this day. \u00a0But I digress...Overall, I still love this place because it close to home, has plenty of room, good company for the most part, and has pool tables. \u00a0Really can't ask for much more for a relaxing night. \u00a0O yea, and the security guard, Tim...is the man.",

They make great stiff drinks and if you ask them to get creative, they go all out! - covered smoking porch is awesome, and there are a lot of tables to accommodate. - there are two long bars, one in a no smoking section and one in a smoking section. - TV on (nice to have while you wait for your friends) - pool tables in the back (a buck to play) and a foosball thingy - space: the layout of this bar is nice as you're not just in one big room. There are nooks where you and your friends can feel like you are in a more private environment, and I think that it adds a nice little coziness to it.  cons -  - Bathrooms could be bigger.. Ok, so I was there with some friends last night, and every time I went to the bathroom for the entire several hours I was there, the left bathroom stall was occupied by the same person with black and white sneakers on. For hours. At first my friends and I thought that she was taking a really long dump, but after an hour and half, we were worried so we just started going to check up on the mysterious left staller... after no movement for several minutes, the feet shifted!! Scared of course (because it very well likely may well have been a REALLY long dump), we decide to venture out into the wild as honestly, that's just weird.   Anyway, moral of the story is that if there is someone in one stall for hours on end doing god knows what, you only have one stall left in the ladies room and that kind of sucks.",

They are actually pretty awesome people. Very friendly, very attentive, very talkative. So they don't suck. As people. As bartenders, yes. The drinks may or may not have alcohol in them, and at 7-9 bucks a pop for an effing vodka tonic (more like tonic and ice), it aint fun.  Then again, the bar itself is really cool. There are a few pool tables, a jukebox, outdoor covered seating, and plenty of tables. There are two rooms and lots of opportunity for people watching. And its a historic bar which is always fun.  Really the best part is its proximity to Golden Boy pizza. So go here to chill and drink non-alcoholic :) drinks with friends, pretend to be drunk, and gorge on probably the best pizza in town :)",

I feel like a kid in a toy store - there are so many things to do, to see, to try...and my neighborhood, especially, makes it SOOOO difficult to focus! I can run on the Embarcadero and enjoy the breeze. I can walk up to the Coit Tower and enjoy breathtaking views and the fun little wild parrots. I can go to the park and people watch. I can go to one of the many cafes and enjoy a delicious cappuccino while reading some magazines. I can browse the nice interesting neighborhood boutiques. I can go to a poetry reading at City Lights. And now to add to the list, I found out that I can have a delightful lazy afternoon, listening to a fabulous jazz band in a very charming bar two blocks from my place. How can I get anything done?!?!  I had been to Savoy Tivoly a couple of times in the evening for a drink with friends. Let's just say, it's not my type of bar to frequent at night. I'm more of a wine bar type of girl. But the Saturday afternoon experience at Savoy was fascinating, and opened up a whole new world for me. I saw things that I didn't even notice the other times, like the beautiful Italian themed decor, the old-fashioned dark wood bar, the vaulted archways, the old jukebox, and the photo booth. They also had big TV screens playing Charlie Chaplin movies - couldn't have been more adequate!  The crowd was older and a mix of locals and tourists. Cash only bar. But the best part of all: the captivating jazz band consisted of a bunch of senior guys that play every Saturday from 3pm to 6pm. They play great quality music and they are very very amusing!  The 5 Stars go to the Saturday afternoons. If you visit - or live - in SF, and if you are into jazz, you MUST try it at least once! It's such a fantastic way to spend a lazy weekend afternoon with a fun group, with a partner (the old ambiance gives the place a romantic aura!), or on a date with your fabulous self.

When I \"have to\" come here, I do. \u00a0Whether it be for a birthday party, a reunion cuz a friend is in town, or we are dressed like Santa Claus running amuck in North Beach. \u00a0This bar has aspects I like, so i never am too whiny when told we are going here. \u00a0  Outdoor/kind of indoor patio. \u00a0Its covered, so you wont get rained on...sort of maintains heat, has a bar, is in the front so you can people watch, and best of all you can smoke your lil lungs out. \u00a0  One of the best photo booths in the city. \u00a0Yes, the photos say the name and address of the bar on them...but they are these amazing black and white shots, or at least they can be....that's right, they have options. \u00a0Everytime I go, I hoard the booth, take as many pictures as i can and stare at myself wondering when I got so damn good looking. \u00a0Then I look in the mirror and realize that this photo booth is magic.",

Its a decent place to hang out if you're looking for a really quiet night, but if you're going to Northbeach instead of the dive down the street...are you really looking for a quiet night??  The first time I came here was for my birthday. Rolled in with a crew about 20 people deep, mixed guys and girls. We became the entire crowd. What intrigued us was $3 shots until 11PM. Forreals!? Selection wasn't crap liquor too: Grey Goose, Fernet, Jamie. All my liquors were here! The amount didn't seem like a full shot, but for $3 bucks each, its not bad.   I like it as a quiet spot to start the night out with really cheap liquor. Other than that, there's not really anything pulling me to this place.",

The one nice/saving grace is that the bar is fully open to the outside giving it a patio experience. Too bad its normally cold in SF, but isn't that what the drinks are for: to warm you up? I would give this place 3 stars but I was mad that with 2 TVs in the bar, they wouldn't turn one of them the Warriors game. Instead the bartender said his manager is only letting them play some cheesy Charlie Chaplin movies on TV. Good thing we asked about changing the channel before I ordered. His answer of no, made me bring my business down the street to Gino and Carlo's.",

And well, I'm Japanese so I automatically like photo booths. [insert peace sign here]. I love the photo booth action for $3...bring home your very own Savoy Tivoli pictures! Aside from photo fun, they have several pool tables for a $1 a game.   I have never failed to get prompt service here. The bartenders are quick, and they have a full bar including wine, and several beers on tap for roughly $6 (Sierra Nevada, Widmer Hef, Fat Tire, Peroni, and a few more from what I remember). There are also 2 bars to order from. The bathrooms are fairly clean with usually no long lines.   I love the outside open awning patio. Great for perfect nights out in the city. The inside has plenty of seating everywhere, and several TVs with movies playing. I heard there's live Jazz music on Saturdays afternoons!   Only drawback: CASH ONLY! Sometimes we just don't carry cash, why ST why not card...it's 2008!! Well, they have an ATM inside if you need cash. \u00a0  Well Savoy, I shall be back soon for some serious drinks, photobooth action, and an intense game of pool!",

But I like how the place is set up, nice cozy looking place with a cool patio area where you can smoke while sipping you drink.   The bartenders were exceptionally friendly and made pretty decent drinks. however, the bar was cash only. They showed me where the ATM was but still there is that one word, Inconvenience. I thought the drinks were a little expensive but its ok.  They have neat pool tables where you can shoot a few rounds while listening to music from the jukebox and the crowd, it seems, is nice. Of course, you're gonna have a crazy hard time find parking in the city but this is a cool bar to kick it.",
