The garlic noodles and calamari were excellent appetizers and the crab stuffed chicken breast was perfect.   The restaurant itself has really dim lights, which adds to the mystique atmosphere of the place. We got a table that looked right out to the bay, so it was really cool to see ships passing by at night.   I think this restaurant really wins it for service - the waiters were all really friendly and towards the end of our meal, the manager came to our table to ask us how our meal was. Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely come back again.  Also, since it was our anniversary, they served us a complimentary coconut ice cream with a candle on top at the end of our meal- definitely the cherry on top.",

They were running late and they said to wait at the bar they could hold our primo table for a bit (even though they were busy!). At that point it was time to order a cocktail and the honey bourbon drink is the bomb. At $8 they are worth every penny.   We were sat at one of the booths toward the back corners of the restaurant, which are my favorite spots. We ordered about 6 appetizers to share for our table of 4 and it was plenty of food. The highlights were the Kahlua Pig Lettuce Cups and the Ahi Poke Tartar. I love the salmon eggs on top. I was not a huge fan of the Dumplings, the shrimp was flavorless and tasted like it was soaked in water. That was one big misstep.   This restaurant is good for groups with its large tables and perfect for a nice dinner out. Price was about $150 for 4 people including drinks.",

Our main entree was the Fried Whole Fish which we ordered based on our server's recommendation. It came out artfully presented, but as soon as I stuck my fork in it, I knew it was over-cooked. We had to literally tear the meat off the bone. What a travesty - fish should never taste so dry and chewy! We also chose it because the menu said it would come with Chinese sausage and chow fun noodles. It doesn't count when you put 2 tiny diced pieces of sausage and 3 pieces of noodles at the bottom of the dish. Bu hao!  In addition, when a manager walks around in sweatpants and a baseball cap (seating and serving clientele), it doesn't help their ratings.

We had the tuna sashimi app as well which was wonderful but there was more than enough food in the 3 courses. Only negative is that the bartender is tone deaf on mixed bevs. Two tries and both drinks lacked any sweetness at all- too darn tart and lean.

Just normal pizza and cut it into small triangle pieces   2. Duck Confit Spring Rolls - I don't like this one. Too dry inside.   3. Tuna Tartar - the flavor of the tuna tartar was kind of weird, maybe too much sesame oil   4. Salad - nothing special. Tasted boring and not refreshing   For main dish:  I had the ahi tuna for my main dish. The portion was generous. It was beautifully presented on a tempura onion ring filled with scallops. The presentation was definitely better than its tasted. I thought the ahi tuna was cut in slices but it was actually was a big and thick chunk. The tuna was a little bit overcooked. Therefore, I had a hard time to cut and taste the freshness of the fish.   My coworker chose the short rib. She told me the rib was too rough. She couldn't even finish her portion.   For dessert:  Three desserts to choose from: Cream Brulee, Molten Lava Cake with Coffee Ice Cream and the Banana Bread Pudding. Desserts were definitely the best part of the meal. All three desserts were beautifully presented. Hugh portions. I had the Molten Lava Cake with Coffee Ice Cream. The chocolate cake itself was warm and chewy with rich flavors and the ice-cream was refreshing. Good balance of the rich flavors from the cake. YUMMY!   The service was very good. Friendly and attentive. My manager was drunk during the middle of the meal and she kept bother the server. The server was so professional to take all her requests. He even changed her banana pudding to chocolate cake because my manager liked the presentation of the cake more.   Overall, Butterfly is a nice restaurant with such a great location and nice decor but just so-so on food!",

The first thing I did when I got here was go to the bathroom. Thank Goodness that I did not REALLY need to go because the line for the ladies room was LONG. As I neared the front of the line it was obvious why the line was so long: TWO stalls and girls who could NOT hold their alcohol.  The DJ was pretty OK and I had room to dance but so many people were wasted and just got out of control (pushing &amp; shoving). People there basically have no regard for others around them.",

I devoured it pretty quickly   We couldn't decide on one dessert, so we decided to get two :) creme brulee and banana bread pudding with coconut ice cream. Both were really delicious. The bread pudding was soft and not too sweet. It was interesting to eat it with the coconut ice cream. Creme brulee was pretty standard  Ambiance was really dark at night.

When I arrived, I noticed it was a restaurant I had walked by that caught my interest so I was extra pleased with that. When I walked in i was quickly walked over to my table, which was right next to the water, so we had a gorgeous view. We had the Fried Calamari appetizer and the Dozen Oysters and they were delicious! The calamari was fried to perfection and had some type of cucumber \"salad\" mixed in that was a great companion to the fish. Surprisingly, we ordered the same thing, something we NEVER do since we have two completely different taste palettes, but the Blue Cheese/Macadamia Nut encrusted Filet Mignon with mashies and greens sounded to-die for! We were right, I think I even ate more than him. The chef was gracious enough to bring out our dishes himself (which is a plus in my book) and the mimosas were great! I will definitely be back (more than once).",

I was surprised they gave us only the \"a la carte\" menu and didn't provide us w the prix fixe menu. I asked our waiter he said that \"it was on request\" I found it a little weird. Like a secret menu? Or is it because it s way cheaper than their a la carte and they want to keep it undercover !??  Anyhow we had calamari and smoked salmon for appetizers which were both fresh and tasty. Then snapper and beef noodles which I thought were both good. Then we both had the Creme Brule which were really big and delicious. Overall it's a great deal for the food and the ambiance, I will recommend this place an make sure to make a reservation.

The complimentary edamame was nice. \u00a0It had sesame seeds and looked to be soaked in sesame oil, which gave it a nice flavor. \u00a0For appetizers we had the duck confit spring rolls and french onion soup. \u00a0Ok, just to clarify, if you decide to fry spring rolls they are now egg rolls. \u00a0Spring rolls are the fresh version of egg rolls. \u00a0So when the \"spring rolls\" came out I was surprised to see that they were fried. \u00a0Unfortunately I think by frying them it made the duck less juicy. \u00a0I rarely eat duck because it's so fatty and yet that's the reason why I LOVE duck. \u00a0So I was a bit disappointed that the juiciness that is associated with duck was lacking. \u00a0The \"spring rolls\" were a bit flavorless so thank goodness they had a wasabi-like dip. \u00a0That helped it a bit. \u00a0The french onion soup was pretty good but I was confused as to why they were serving french onion soup. \u00a0Even if this is an asian fusion restaurant isn't this soup straight up French? \u00a0As our entrees we both had the American Kobe Beef Burgers. \u00a0I never had kobe beef so I was very excited to try it. \u00a0I would have to say that so far I don't care much for it. \u00a0It just tasted like a regular burger to me. \u00a0Cousin said Japanese Kobe is much better so one day I'll have to splurge on that.

My wife runs a kitchen and we both cook and try a lot of SF restaurants, cocktail lounges etc. Staff was very friendly, had a sense of humor and was very conscientious. The chef made a point of checking in with diners himself to see how we liked the food.... rare these days. Our waiter (I believe his name was Porter) was enthusiastic, funny and helpful throughout the night. Another server, Sam humored us by complying with our request to describe the dishes in his native French once we caught the accent. He was also knowledgeable, professional and fun. Signature cocktails were great-- Sidecar had a nice twist w/ candied ginger rim and my rum drink was solid as well. Ah.. the food. We split a calamari appetizer- crisp, well seasoned, great presentation Short Ribs entree- succulent, creative design over veggies and what seemed like a homemade sticky rice concoction. The beef was extremely tender, delicious and cooked just right .. \u00a0 Chocolate dessert was decadent to top things off. I noticed there were some 1 star reviews a few mos back.

When I first heard about this place the food was labeled as Asian Fusion, but I think now its labeled as Californian. Butterfly is both Asian Fusion and Californian for two reasons: 1) an obvious Asian influence with the ingredients in the food and 2) the preparation, presentation, and freshness makes this place Californian! The flavors come together so well like House on Grant Ave.   For whatever reason I have this idea in my head that \"Asian Fusion\" is not a good thing, and 90% of the time I am wrong! The level of service and presentation of the food is 5 stars!   Food:  * Mushroom Cappuccino Soup - creamy Buttered Hon Shiimenji Mushrooms with White Truffle Oil and dusted with Porcini Powder is served in a cappuccino cup and it is the BEST mushroom soup I've ever had!!! I'm still dreaming about it :D  * Flat Iron Skirt Steak for DAT - came with Potabella Mushroom, Snow Peas, and Greasy Potato Gratin. The steak was perfectly cooked rear!  * Lemon Grass Snapper for DAT - Served sizzling on an iron skillet and comes with cold vermicelli noodles and lettuce to wrap everything together. YUM  * Banana Lumpia for DAT - served w. Vanilla Ice Cream, the Caramel Sauce made this too sweet!  * Creme Brulee - Creamy and dense!   Drinks:  * Summojito - very drinkable   Space:  Love the high ceilings, table and chairs are very industrial modern home, and the large hanging uni sculptures are fun! The large wall windows that look over the bay isn't bad... lol  Come here, take your time, enjoy the food, and you wont go home hungry!",

Atmosphere: Nice and dark. Large windows overlooking the bay, though at nice not much to see, but you can still see the lights. The space is a bit small and the bar is right upon entrance. Made a reservation and hostess wanted a party of 3 to sit at a round table meant for 2 (with 2 people sharing the banquet side...odd?!). Requested a table window and got it.  Food: Nice selection, but I can see how it would be limiting to some. They offer a kid's menu, though the portion was very small, yet fries that came with it were Yum! Ordered oysters (small, but tasty sauces), poached pear salad (good), fried whole fish (Thai snapper - delish), sesame crusted ahi (perfectly cooked - rare!), banana lumpia (tasty, but melted the ice cream too much). The edamame brought out was tasty too.  Drinks: Reasonable and a unique selection. Lycheetini was good and not too sweet.   Service: Friendly and efficient. Water never went empty; plates cleared promptly (server even knew we had the g/c and it didn't affect service; not that it should, but you never know...).  In the end, the bill came and the server did not put on the automatic 18%, which is a term of using the g/c. In a way it was good that she didn't because we left a full 20% of the pre-discount amount.   I will definitely go back and maybe for happy hour.",

The drinks are good mixtures of alcohol and flavor with something for everyone in the drinking spectrum.

Ordered a cherry martini type drink for my guest and I went with a lemon sake drink I believe. Both drink were not to my liking. Shot down a couple oyster shooters that weren't my type either. I ended up sliding everything to the other side of the table to be devoured by another...The fire fried calamari was delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed the appetizer, and instead of a meal I went with the wild mushroom cappuccino soup. It was soooooo warming and hearty. Such a good combo of flavors. Although it was a bit sandy which I believe to be due to the porcini powder, the flavor was spot on! We were also seated on the side of the bar facing the water which was a nice view, and at first entry we were the only ones there. Towards the very end of our meal the chef came out and was greeting the dining guests. He stopped by our table to ask how the meal was and if we were enjoying ourselves. I like when chef's do that. Overall I enjoyed my meal minus the bar drinks, and the shooters. Although honestly they were my first shooters, and I don't really care for bloody mary sauce. (DOH!) Nice little afternoon meal with a great view &amp; food - can't beat that!",

    "review_text": "My horrible dining experience has led me to write my first review, so here it is:  The service at Butterfly was absolutely abysmal. Me and a group of friends went there for \"dine about town\" for lunch and it was just awful. To start off, it took waay too long for the waitress, Christine, to bring us water. We had to ask her a second time for the water. I mean seriously if you even have to ask ANY waiter/waitress for water at a restaurant, you know the rest of the service probably won't be spectacular. Then it was time to order. They gave us ONE menu for the NINE of us to share! Are you kidding me?! ONE menu??? You would think a nice restaurant like Butterfly could afford more than one menu for such a large group. Anyway, onto our food. Dine about town features a 3-course pre-fixed menu for a fixed price. I got the calamari for appetizer, egg scramble tostada for the entree and creme brulee for dessert. The calamari was decent, they give you a generous amount and the creme brulee was mediocre as well. As for the entree, I can't even tell you how it was because I, along with my other friend who ordered the same thing, never got it!!! Our whole table received their entrees and Christine even came to ask us how we were doing without noticing that two entrees were missing. Finally after 20 min we said something to her and by then most of my friends were already done eating so we canceled the orders. The manager came and apologized and only took ONE of the entrees off the check even though they forgot TWO. We were so upset that we refused to pay the 18% gratuity. When our waitress found out, she practically threw the check on our table. That biz-natch!! Oh and the lunch took over 2 1/2 hours--not because we were enjoying ourselves and lost track of time but because each meal took forever to get served!! Don't waste your time going here.

There once was a restaurant called, \"Dragonfly\" in San Jose a couple of years ago, which unfortunately didn't survive. I was so bummed because I've had several special occasions there and loved most of their signature dishes. A few months later, I heard from a friend that \"Butterfly\" in SF had similar items and that was music to my ears. A couple of my girlfriends and I made a trip to the city to try this place out for dinner. Right when you walk in, it's wide, nice decor which made it very lively. It was nicely dim and the view outside the window was stunning. We got a table for four next to the window.   The item that I came here for was the 'hoisin glazed bbq baby back ribs'. You have to try it! Simply finger-lickin' good. The rest of the girls ordered 'wok seared shanghai garlic noodles, kalua pig with butter lettuce cups, and garlic seared clams and mussels.' Everything was delishh. Service was attentive and made sure we got what we needed. This place is great for any occasion.",

We actually found free street parking less than a block up Bay St! \u00a0  \u00a0As requested at reservation call we were shown to a bay-side (interior) table. The DAT menu was varied and generous. Lettuce leaves with pork were juicy and delicious. The smoked salmon Benedict was beautifully sauced and when I broke the egg it became perfect. This dish could easily satisfy 2 people with an appetizer. There was something wonderful about the fries in that they were soft and fluffy (don't ask me how) and just right for gathering up the sauce. Also had one of the best Manhattans I have ever sipped.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Friends said their shaking beef Cobb salad and wild mushroom scramble were just right also.   \u00a0 \u00a0 The view is both pretty, lots of sail boats, tugs and even a commercial vessel, and gritty, in a picturesque way (the piers).  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I would probably never give 5 stars anyway but when I called B. that AM to ask about parking I was told that there was usually space at the meters out front and ,if not, the lot across Embarcadero would be no more than $8 or maybe $10. Well, all the meters in front had cardboard City signs saying no parking and that lot is wayyy expensive!  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But we did luck out on the parking score.

The owner really stepped up the game----the place now has superior service------so I have to hand it to Rob for listening to the customer (man is that rare these days !!!!!).   2. The bar service rocks. Our Server \"Trevor\" was simply the best. I am serious---this guy makes the best drinks in San Francisco !!!! He took the time to listen to my likes---as far as liquor, and then made drink after drink. Combine his superior service with the awesome value of the Happy Hour menu---and you have a kicking place to hang. Oh---the new bartender named Rachael was the sweetest person on the planet. We met her on her first night.   3. Food. What else is there in life? Well if you want good food---look no further. The Kobe Burger is awesome. The Garlic noodles are to die for. The calamari perfect-----I mean perfect. Seriously---I can't even remember all the food I have had there---but I know this one thing---I have always had an awesome meal---every time---without fail.

He said, \"ok.\" We were about to walk by this venue that was labeled, \"Butterfly\" and I asked, \"you think they have a bar inside?\" And he replied with a great assurance, \"yeah!\" So in we go.  Right when I open the heavy glass door, my first glance inside make me complimented underneath my breath, \"it looks expensive in here.\" We went inside anyways. I figure, this would've been our last spot before we head back home so I thought to myself, \"lets go balls out or not at all.\"  \"We maneuvered ourselves to the bar, which was conveniently located right in front of the entrance. \u00a0The hostess offered to help us but I asked her, \"is it okay if we sit at the bar?\" \"Yeah sure! No problem!\"  The bartender, whom ended up serving us the rest of the time we were there, signed us off on our first drink. The Boyfriend helped himself on \"ginger cyclo 'side car'\" and I with \"honey bourbon sour\". Which I had to say, the drinks was exquisitely made and prepared. It was so good that I had to have one shot with the bartender.  I asked her, \"are you allowed to drink?\" \"Yes.\" \"Have a shot with us, on me. Kamikaze. Lets start lite.\" \"Sure, I like your style.\" After our shot, I found out that her name was Lauren. It's been awhile since I met a female bartender I really liked. Most are pretty snotty and most seems like they're hating life behind the bar. This particular one, I really liked.  I was still hungry prior to our last stop so I decided to order something for me to munch on while we sat there and chat. I ordered Wok Seared Shanghai Garlic Noodles. I guess the name of the entree reminded me of Fahrenheit Ultra Lounge (San Jose, CA) WokTok Garlic Noodles. Result: noodles were fantastic! I didn't request it with chicken or shrimp or anything. Just simple as is. It still tasted spectacular.  Overall: Yes, I would come back here again. Yes, I would recommend this spot to others. Yes, the drinks and food is fantastic. Yes, the service was excellent too... at least with Lauren it was =] Yes, the view from the dining was gorgeous. The interior had a relaxing and mature ambiance. I like =]  (For someone who only started working there for 2 months, I say Lauren is a keeper =] Genuine, polite, professional and an awesome hospitality.)",

Who can say no to that!!   We made reservations for dinner and we arrived a little earlier than our reservations, but they had no problem finding us a table asap. The restaurant is beautiful with a view of the ocean ( so romantic). The decor and ambiance is really artistic and chic. For appetizer we ordered the fried calamari and pulled pork. Oh pulled pork! you are to die for!!! Delis!!! Melts in your mouth goodness! The friend calamari tasted fresh and not rubbery like other restaurants. I love the sauce with the calamari and the fresh spring veggies on the side.   For the main course, we ordered the Pork Porterhouse, which we thought was a little bit too salty, and filet Mignon with blue cheese and macadamia crust, which I devoured.  This is one of the restaurants I will definitely go back to. The prices was surprisingly not as expensive as I've expected. Fine dinning at an affordable price!",

I went for lunch and I got the Shaken Beef Cobb Salad and it was the best salad I ever had in my life. I'm a pretty hardcore carnivore, so I was blown away by the fact that a salad could give me such a mouthgasm. The dressing was just right in flavor and amount, the bacon was perfect, the prosciutto was a great match for all elements of the salad, the red and yellow grape tomatoes were delicious and made the presentation of the plate beautiful and flawless. \u00a0I had some of my friend's french fries as well, and they were just damn good. It's like the chefs actually tasted their food before they served it, which seems obvious, but doesn't always seem to be the case in a lot of the restaurants I've tried.   And another thing, the service was ridiculously fast. I got my salad and my friend got his Kobe Beef Burger about 4 minutes after ordering. wtf? It must be magic. I'm definitely going back again.",

The reviews I read previously are all pretty good but I wasn't expecting too much since most of the restaurants on the Embarcadero are overpriced and mediocre. I was pleasantly surprised by this place in terms of good food and service.  It was a Friday night and we didn't make a reservation (when I called 10 minutes prior they said they were all booked up) but luckily we were able to get a table immediately. The host/manager Johnny was really friendly and we told him we had just had a horrible day and needed a drink. The drinks didn't disappoint! I got the fig punch (seasonal) and it was amazing! Later tried the margarita and it was good too, made with just tequila, agave, and lime, how a real margarita should be.  We wanted a lighter meal so just ordered some appetizers - Ahi Tempura Rolls, Shanghai Garlic Noodles, Kalua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups, and the Duck Confit Spring Rolls. These appetizers are huge! We were totally stuffed and even had some leftovers.   For dessert we ordered the Banana Bread Pudding which was to die for. Johnny must have told the waitress that we said we were having a bad day because she brought over a creme brulee on the house, as well as a dessert wine apertif. Lovely people.  Overall a great dining experience and I'd definitely go back! 4 stars only because I give out 5 stars sparingly.",

(Is it OK if I say I had a double date here? What? OK. Thanks.) So I had a double date here with two of my best friends and an old friend! Pretending to know where this place was since I came here for two sorority invitationals (Yes I was... NOT in a sorority, I was invited - *fist in the air*), I thought I found a cool parking spot when it was 6 piers down! Hella far and hella cold way to Butterfly. Anyway, the waitress who appeared to be a Latin disappointed me because she did not know who Julieta Venegas is, because she reminded me of a Julieta and Nelly Furtado put together. She looked like she was a dancer because she was fit and dodged the other waitstaff carrying her trays of drinks with the agility of a gazelle in the grasslands. Anyway, we made her come back three times to order our drinks since we all decided on what we wanted at different times. Wish I had more edamame appetizer but two of my friends who were there on time, unlike me and my friend, ATE IT ALL! *fist in the air.* Anyway, the salmon carappacio was probably not on the freshest side, but I guess with water looking like milked-out coffee right outside the window, it was expected. Second course, the hanger steak was delicious! For some reason my friend didn't like it as much as I did, but that and the potato au gratin were lovable! For dessert, sexy chocolate cake! I guess you really have to lower your expectations for any DAT because chances are you will be stupefied at how enjoyable and dazzling these under-rated places can be. I hope I am not upping your expectations with this review, but this place was surprisingly good. I remember my first time here I had what is known now as a \"wedge salad.\" As a sophomore in college, I had no idea some salads were served as ONE PIECE OF LETTUCE! At least it had some vinaigrette and pomegranate seeds all over it, but I was like: *fist in the air.* Butterfly was good, and if you are too drunk you will end up pushing the wrong side of the glass door/wall upon exiting! (haha, don't you shove your fist in the air at me! You know who you are.) -Matt",

I was not even hungry when I came here but my girlfriend was. \u00a0Porter, our waiter, has been very helpful with our food selection. \u00a0If there is such a thing as an \"ideal man\", then Porter is the \"ideal server\". \u00a0He out-shined the service provided by any of \u00a0the 5-star restaurants that I've been too. \u00a0  He recommended we started with the oyster shots- turned out to be a good call! \u00a0 Then he brought us some edamame on the house - another good one! \u00a0Then came the mussels - the broth rocked my whole world entirely. \u00a0It is definitely a must try. \u00a0For dinner, we shared the garlic noodles (which is plenty for 2 people but yummy) and the duck. \u00a0The duck is definitely the best. \u00a0Not sure really what part of duck it was but it was very lean, tender and very meaty. \u00a0It was marinated and very tasty. \u00a0I thought I had an orgasm when I bit into it and I am not kidding you. \u00a0It was delicious.  I don't drink but I was told that their gimlets are pretty good too. \u00a0I had the non-alcoholic lycheetini and it was delicious - not too sweet and just perfect for my taste buds. \u00a0  They were closing when my husband caught up with us and even if the kitchen was already closed, Porter was so kind to get the kitchen to prepare something delicious and fast for my hungry husband. \u00a0  I can't wait til my next birthday because I will definitely celebrate it over here at Butterfly! \u00a0Kudos to Porter. \u00a0You earned it!",

The Duck Confit Spring Rolls are simultaneously crispy and juicy, in addition to being super tasty. And the Kalua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups is my hands-down favorite - I was torn between stuffing them in my face as quickly as I could and savoring the yumminess. The pork was really tender and the hoisin barbeque sauce was flavorful without being overwhelming.  My friend and I then had the Garlic Seared Clams and Mussels followed by the Orange and Curry Spiced Maine Dayboat Scallops. And we had the Creme Brulee for dessert. (It was only the two of us, so it was pretty much a fatty-fest, I know.) At this point, I was more than adequately sauced thanks to a couple of happy hour cocktails and shots of tequila, so I can't really provide the shrewdest analysis of these dishes - suffice it to say that I enjoyed them to the point of not being able to put down my fork/spoon/whatever.  If you're on the fence about eating at Butterfly, their happy hour is definitely a good place to get a taste of the food (and get your booze on) without forking over too much cash.",

The hostess, sommelier and our server (A beautiful lady from Brazil) were all very cordial. We had a table by the window, where we could see Richmond off in the hazy distance. Our meal commenced with the Duck Confit Spring Rolls ($9), Fire Fried Calamari ($9) and the Salmon and Strawberry Salad Rolls ($9). All were very tasty - I thought the strawberry flavor might have overwhelmed the salmon just a tad - and the calamari was a hefty portion. We then had the Gnocchi and Spring Peas Stir Fry ($16), the Sweet and Sour Grilled Pork Chop ($25) and the Ponzu Grilled Hangar Steak ($22). Beautiful portions, nicely arranged on the plate - not stacked one on top of the other (a practice I detest) - and flavors that didn't clash. I admire the fact that you can get a hangar steak (or \"flap steak\", \"hanging tender \"- the proper name - \"butcher steak\") in this town; it didn't used be so. It came melt-in-your-mouth tender, with portobello \u00a0mushroom chunks and whole sweet peas in a cabernet jus de veau and potato leek gratin, which I left two little bites of because I wanted dessert. Which was one of those gooey little warm chocolate tortes with ice cream - it was enough for three little stuffed piggies.

A curse because it happens to be nestled between the Embarcadero/downtown and Fisherman's Wharf, so I'm not sure if the often touristy clientele contributes to their somewhat lackluster food that falls a bit flat (read: Asian fusion that doesn't succeed on any level, except maying appealing to a really broad, bland, safe palate).

    "review_text": "My boyfriend and I decided to have our farewell to summer dinner at Butterfly. From all of my fellow yelper's reviews, I knew what to expect. Great view, check. Great food, check. Great environment, check.   So what went wrong for it to only receive three stars? Let's just recap all the events of the evening.  1. \u00a0Once I walked into Butterfly, I realized I was over dressed. My impression of this place before I went in was that it was a causal chic place but I was disappointed to find it a very casual jeans kind of place.  2. Our hostess led us to this small table right by the window with a fabulous view of the bay.. but the booth was unfortunately facing inwards. As my boyfriend and I flipped through the menu awkwardly, we felt all eyes glued onto us. You see, not only was the table faced the wrong way , but it so happened to be right in the middle too. Later we asked to switch tables and our waiter told us that the booths were put in earlier that day. Why would someone want to put a booth facing inwards? Not only does it create such an awkward eating space but it takes away the entire view of the bay!  3. After our table frenzy, we decided to order some drinks and appetizer. I ordered the pom cosmo. I don't know why I bother to order drinks at all, they never taste good. Seriously, no matter how mouth watering they sound on paper, they never turn out good. Along with our drinks, we also opted for the duck eggrolls. They were a-mazing! The sauce that accompanies it -- some sort of sesame wasabi sauce (?) -- was also very good. If I had to rate the food alone, this place would get 5 stars for sure.  4. Now the real show starts. My boyfriend ordered the fillet mignon and I ordered the Ahi Tuna. The fillet was good -- very tender and very tasteful. But the real wow factor was the Ahi Tuna. I ordered it raw and it was exactly that. The sauce is a bit spicy but it was SO GOOD. My boyfriend, who usually HATES fish, loved it and couldn't get enough!  5. Dessert was ok. We decided on the Creme brulee and the Banana Lumpia. The Creme Brulee didn't taste too fresh and the Banana Lumpia was nothing too special. It was only $6 a piece -- pretty good deal!  6. And here is why it lost a star. When we got the check, I put down my usual Discover card. Well the waiter then asked me if I had another card because THEY DON'T TAKE DISCOVER. Now, I can expect that at a place in Chinatown. But a restaurant like Butterfly?? I was pretty surprised. I guess it's really not that big of a deal but I just felt it was pretty inconvenient.   Over all, the restaurant is good. If you want good food with a good view, definitely go here. Make sure you're not going to pay with a Discover card though!  Update:  I also forgot to mention that we were seated next to a table full of kids. The kids were running around which really irritated me. Parents should really keep tabs on their kids at restaurants! I don't mind sitting next to kids, but they definitely should not be running around and screaming in a restaurant!",

The pork melted in your mouth and the hoisin sauce gave it just enough extra flavor. I had the Kobe Beef burger and my boyfriend had the duo of the chowders. The presentation was fancy. Taste wise, they were good but i expected it to be a little better. For dessert we had the Banana Bread Pudding. That was Yummy!! The coconut ice cream it came with went well with it.

    "review_text": "Butterfly is one of those restaurants that's been around so long that you sometimes forget how good it is. I remember going here almost ten years ago, and in San Francisco terms, that's some pretty impressive staying power.   Chef Rob Lam mixes his Vietnamese heritage with modern flavors to bring a series of dishes that perform culinary magic in your mouth: the wok-seared garlic noodles (get them with Kalua pig!), the smoked salmon and strawberry salad rolls (a tasty juxtaposition), or the turmeric grilled snapper (my favorite). For dessert, I'd trade any decadence for Butterfly's lychee shaved ice.  Outside of the food, the restaurant still boasts one of the more dramatic atmospheres in town. The setting is modern and sleek, and set against the water with floor-to-ceiling windows, well it's hard to find a better view of the Bay from a restaurant. Except on sunny days, that is, when their outdoor deck opens up, becoming the perfect perch to idle away a few hours.",

The restaurant has HUGE bay windows that over look, what else.....the Bay. It's a cross between a warehouse and a loft. I'm sure at night this place would be lots of fun.  Food:3*- The food was good, but like I mentioned earlier not great. We came for the DAT lunch and personally I didn't really feel that any part of that menu was Asian Fusion. I started with the Tuna Carpaccio, which was really good. I'm not a fan of horseradish or wasabi so I didn't really eat any of the creme fraiche. Main meal was the Shaking Beef Cobb salad, AKA a Cobb salad. I didn't taste any Asian flavors in the meat, and the salad certainly didn't have any Asian flare. Lastly the Creme brule. Now this I'll admit was mighty tasty! I would return to have the creme brule again.   Service:3*- Very friendly wait staff. Our waitress was very apologetic when she brought out a wrong dish by mistake.   All in all I would return for dinner and I definitely want to try something that has more of the Asian fusion flare that they advertise this restaurant is.",

The service was good and the decor was ok. None of the dishes were especially memorable, though I admit there was nothing wrong with any of them either.  I had the hangar steak and it was tasty and properly cooked, however, not interesting or worth coming back for.   Either way, a forgettable culinary experience.",

The ambiance is excellent with the nice decor, although I can't say the bay view is extremely nice with grungy pier buildings as boarders.   Both the chicken salad sandwich and kobe beef burger were excellent. The lychee mimosa was a nice twist on the traditional orange mimosa. Butterfly has the BEST fries I've ever had. Huge chunky steak fries that perfectly fried crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I also appreciated the nicely seasoned sesame edamame starter that comes with any order.  I think the prices are very reasonable for being on the Pier. I'd definitely like to come back sometime for a drink since their bar looked slick as well!",

    "review_text": "The Butterfly Affect.  My brother made reservations for Thanksgiving dinner. \u00a0Since my mother and I were on vacation, we thought we'd let someone else do the cooking this year. \u00a0  I found the pre-fixe menu and other information regarding the restaurant at:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.butterflysf.com%2F&amp;s=994ffa1d7d47ce9c30c5c2871d1c5bf96a91865877e49a9cf4f7cade6f14fc49\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">butterflysf.com</a>  SETTING: \u00a0Located along the Embarcadero, Butterfly is spacious and welcoming. \u00a0Floor to ceiling windows over look the nearby Pier 39.  FOOD: 1. \u00a0Amuse: \u00a0A Trio of the following--  -House Smoked King Salmon, Whipped Horseradish, Wasabi Cracker  -Cha Siu Bacon, Hachiya Persimmon, Malted Sesame  -Oyster Duo, Bloody Mary Shooter, Champagne Mignonette, Gremolata  As they saying goes, things usually come in \"3's\". \u00a0And certainly this amuse-bouche trio was a delectable beginning to our meal. \u00a0My favorite was the cha siu bacon, with the oyster shooter a close second. \u00a0Simply delicious.  2. \u00a0First Course: \u00a0Our group of 4 all chose the soup--  Curried Pumpkin Soup with caramelized shiitake mushrooms, ginger cream, fried pumpkin seeds, and cilantro.  The warm soup was definitely a comfort to help combat the chilly weather that night. \u00a0Good portion with a hint of spice. \u00a0A delightful part of the meal.  3. \u00a0Entree: \u00a0Salt baked turkey breast accompanied with turkey leg confit and sweet potato hash. \u00a0Also included on the entree were scallion and goat cheese popover, twice baked butterball potato, lop cheong fried brown sticky rice, ginger and cranberry relish, and truffled mushroom sauce.  The entree was quite appetizing and very filling. \u00a0I personally wanted to save room for dessert so I didn't want to indulge too much. \u00a0The turkey was prepared well and I finished the entire portion given. \u00a0I didn't care for the popover that much, but did finish most of the baked potato. \u00a0The lop cheong sticky rice was something different, but since this restaurant is Asian fusion cuisine, it wasn't surprising to see some Asian influence included on the menu. \u00a0Overall, our group was satisfied with the entree.  4. \u00a0Dessert: \u00a0Pumpkin pie (of course!) a la mode.  No Thanksgiving meal would be complete without the traditional pumpkin pie. \u00a0Originally this was supposed to be served with whipped cream, but our server kindly granted our \"wishes\" and substituted vanilla bean ice cream instead. \u00a0A perfect ending to a wonderful meal.  SERVICE: \u00a0 Good. \u00a0It could have been slightly better perhaps, but the restaurant was extremely busy that night. \u00a0Our reservation was for 600pm, but we were seated closer to 630pm. \u00a0To pass the time we enjoyed some drinks at the bar and discussed the other places we were going to visit on our trip. \u00a0The server was friendly as well as polite, and did his very best to attend to our table and others he was responsible for. \u00a0We were all thankful that he complied with our request for ice cream to be served with dessert instead of whipped cream. \u00a0  After our meal was nearly done, the chef himself came by to see how we were all doing and how we liked the food. \u00a0I thought this was very gracious of him, and he actually did chat with my brother for a few minutes. \u00a0He then wished us a Happy Thanksgiving and went on to greet the other diners.  BOTTOM LINE: \u00a0Satisfactory dining experience. \u00a0Good service. \u00a0Though there was a shaky start, the meal finished superbly as the food had a great affect on us: \u00a0A delicious Thanksgiving dinner overall.",

    "review_text": "Having dined many moons ago at the original location in the Mission, I purchased a couple of coupons on Amazon prompting two spaced visits here. \u00a0The earlier one was before daylight savings time so it was already dark here and the crowd was already settled in; the atmosphere was more romantic under these conditions. \u00a0On our recent stop here, it was a bright, sunny, breezy day and the scenery shines more when the dining room is bright. \u00a0Our waiter quickly brought us water and the menus. \u00a0 After some deliberation, here's what I had:  Appetizers (shared) 1) Ahi Poke with croquettes (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=64_tLvdKRQt4Xkol_iRTSg&amp;userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>) - Moderately flavored, the tuna pieces were tender and fresh. \u00a0The rice croquettes were a good twist. \u00a0  2) Chicken Wings (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cYznSh6YBdHSj_NAsoKzEQ&amp;userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>) - Not a big blue cheese fan, I still enjoyed this. \u00a0Ten unseparated wings that were crispy with a sweet and sour tang.  Entr\u00e9e 3) Hangar Steak, medium rare (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=fZqSaTo43PGA5ePrwfTb7w&amp;userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>) - Perfectly cooked to a reddish pink, the teriyaki sauce stood out as a contrast to the creamy potatoes and crunchy snap peas. \u00a0Please bear in mind that this cut is on the chewy side.  Dessert (shared) 4) Warm Chocolate cake (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=FcLO8K8Qzspzpm-iAjqqYA&amp;userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>) - Cooked warm, the lava literally flowed towards the melting ice cream. \u00a0Just a notch below Roy's.  As I played with my phone, the owner/chef saw me and jokingly mentioned Yelping the restaurant. \u00a0Unlike many old school chefs, he complimented the virtues of the reviews and values the comments made. \u00a0We noticed that he walked the entire dining to gauge reactions, talk about a hands-on business. \u00a0 I was impressed with the food, vibe, and service. \u00a0My friend's only criticism was a lack of bread service. \u00a0Used Living Social coupons on both visits. \u00a0Will be back!",

Appetizer: \u00a0I had the Fire Fried Calamari, which I thought was pretty good. \u00a0Not spectacular, but pretty good. \u00a0The nephew really liked them as well, but only the ones without the sauce because he thought the sauce was spicy. \u00a0My sister had the Duck Confit Spring Rolls. \u00a0Also, pretty good, but not spectacular. \u00a0  Entree: I had the Shaking Beef Cobb Salad, which was soooo GOOD. \u00a0The poached egg on top was different and definitely added a little extra something to the salad. \u00a0I'd go back to have the salad. \u00a0My sister had the Chicken Salad Club Sandwich, which was gigantic. \u00a0She didn't say how it was, but she was only able to eat half. \u00a0The nephew ordered off the Kids Menu (yes, they have a Kids Menu) and got Cheese Pizza with Fries.  Dessert: I had the Warm Chocolate Torte, which was good. \u00a0They even put a candle on top of it for my birthday. \u00a0My sister had the Creme Brulee, which was a normal creme brulee. \u00a0The nephew had a fruit cup. \u00a0He loved it.  Service: \u00a0We were seated right away. \u00a0Our server was friendly and came to check on us often. \u00a0I have to say service was a tad bit slow. \u00a0We were there for a couple of hours. \u00a0It took forever between the appetizer and entree, but that might have been because our server was waiting for me to finish my appetizer before she brought out the entree. \u00a0I was kind of grazing because I was saving it for the nephew. \u00a0She finally came over and asked if it would be okay for her to bring out the entree.  So to sum it up. \u00a0Food is good, but not spectacular. \u00a0Love the space and the view is pretty nice. \u00a0I'd go back just for the Shaking Beef Cobb Salad.",

If not for the bloomspot deal I probably would not come back.  Butterfly was an interesting dining experience. I came here after hiking with MP at Rodeo Beach and I was HUNGRY. We were seated immediately at a table by the floor to ceiling window...but our backs were to it. Weird. There was an enormous and grand cruise ship behind us ... but our backs were to it. I did crane my head around to enjoy the view once in a while but it got too tiring after a while. The interior felt more like a club than a restaurant. Modern and sleek and very dark. Reminded me of EN brasserie in NYC.  We tried the kahlua pig with butter lettuce cups, garlic noodles with shaking beef, and duck confit spring rolls for starters. For the entree we shared the fried whole fish with spicy sausage and flat rice cakes. The best dish was by far the kahlua pig. I thought that was a truly creative and actually interesting Asian fusion twist on a classic Chinese dish. Everything else tasted like Chinese food that was spruced up and verrrryy expensive. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but it was just jazzed up Chinese food. The garlic noodles tasted like lo mein. The fried fish was a little tough, but I did appreciate the presentation and how the chef scored the fish meat so I could eat it easily right off the bone. I was too full for dessert.  Our server was really sweet and friendly and he made our meal experience very enjoyable. The non alcoholic beverages sounded tasty too. Overall, would come here only with a bloomspot deal but even then there are other tastier options in the city.",

The Buddha's hand which my friend ordered is a bit stronger so if you're looking for something strong I recommend the Buddha's hand.   We had their chicken wings and calamari. The calamari was lightly breaded but served on a rectangular plate. Even though the food was good the portions were far too small.

    "review_text": "We will certainly be back to Butterfly. We waited outside on a nippy Sunday and the hostess let us in right at 11 am when they opened the door. We were greeted with a welcoming smile and were promptly seated at a table by the window facing the bay. Our waiter gave us a good description of the Dine About Town menu. We ordered the Fried Calamari and the Kahlua Pig for the appetizer selections. The Fried Calamari was fantastic, crispy light and tender with a wonderful sprinkling of herbs and a rich creamy aioli topping. The warm Kahlua Pig was sweet succulent and smokey, accompanied by butter lettuce and a small dish of Hoisin sauce. For our breakfast entree we ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedicts. The smoked salmon was divine and the tobiko garnish on top was exquisite. And it came with nice thick cut fries anda bowl of fresh mixed fruit that gave a nice refreshing ending to the meal. And to top off the wonderful meal we had the bottomless Bloody Mary cocktail that our waiter made sure to keep refilled for us.",

Duck confit spring rolls - very tasty fried rolls, \u00a0very delicate skins so it was easier to pick it up with fingers than a fork  Fried calamari - delicately served on a long appetizer platter. Not a whole lot of calamari for the price and seasoning was ho hum.   Garlic noodles with beef - the garlic noodles was a steal for the price! Huge portion, comes with veggies by default. The beef was extra but it wasn't a whole lot of beef for $8.   Wagyu cheeseburger - excellent burger for $16. Fries were tasty and hearty.   All in all, nice ambiance, good date night place, and good food. Entrees are a bit pricey but you can get full on the appetizers too.",

We were given a small edamame dish. Edamame had sesame oil and seeds and was the best I've tasted. To drink I had the virgin version of the kiwi cucumber beverage. It was made of muddled kiwi and cucumber, soda water, and agave nectar. It was surprisingly tart and tasty and very refeshing. For lunch I ordered the Vietnamese Fried Fish Sandwich. The fish was delicately fried, so it wasn't greasy. It had fresh cucumbers and carrots and great, thick bread. French fries were thick and also lightly fried, not greasy. I would go here again in a heartbeat!",

The Yelp party was a lot of fun, despite the fact that neither of us had known anyone there initially. The h'or d'oeuvres were tasty, and the drinks were absolutely delicious. (I still have great memories of the amazing cocktail with the Black Effen cherry vodka and am praying that it makes a reappearance at an upcoming Yelp party.) \u00a0The birthday party was not bad, but I thought the venue was way too tiny. There was literally no room to move (and people were attempting to dance with small vertical movements while squished together like sardines). The bar area itself was especially crowded. Parking is also a nightmare to find in this area, and I remember the nearby garages cost around $20-30 for the night. \u00a0There's nothing really special about Butterfly as a venue, except that it is pretty small (for those who perhaps want a more intimate celebration). I'll probably update my review if I ever come back sometime to check out Butterfly for dinner.",

    "review_text": "We went here last Friday for my cousin's birthday and for Dine About Town. When we got there, we asked for the Dine About menu but they said they weren't participating for Dine About on Fridays... ODD, since on the Dine About website it said Butterfly was participating for dinner from Monday through Friday. I knew this for sure because this had happened to me before (the first time was my fault) so I double checked to make sure... Luckily, my husband had his handy Iphone and checked the Dine About website and sure enough they were on there as participating on Fridays. So we asked for the manager, told him about the website... and at first we got the impression that it was our fault for finding this incorrect website... He said they've known about the website error, have complained about it and he has had many headaches over it... OKAY. SO???? It's STILL not our fault, that we found the site and decided to drive 45 minutes to this place to dine about at Butterfly. I told him all this, and he was pretty reluctant with offering us the dine about special, but after talking with the chef, they were able to make an exception!  Needless to say, the food was delish and the ambience was great. My favorite dish was probably the smoked salmon and strawberry salad roll (who would've thought smoked salmon and strawberries could go together?). We sat by the window, which was KINDA nice, except there wasn't much of a view, but it was all good. \u00a0  If it hadn't been for the drama, I would've given them 5 stars... so for now, it'll have to be 4 stars.",

    "review_text": "Love, love, love Butterfly Restaurant.   I saw a \"Check, Please\" episode about it and for some reason it's one of the few restaurants that my mother actually remembered from that show. I saw it, too, and thought, \"I'll have to check it out.\"  So Mother's Day rolls around and I decide to treat my mom to Butterfly. The online reservation process was seamless and I didn't feel like there was going to be some major mishap about whether or not they had the reservation.  Seamless reservation and check in process.  Granted, the menu was prix-fixe because of Mother's Day, so I can only review what was eaten from that menu. Judging from what we had --which I speculate is pretty indicative to the general menu-- was basically a sampling of their popular items with a main entree and dessert.   The seafood options they had were spectacularly fresh and tasty. I had an opportunity to try the sea urchin on my sample plate and I'm glad I had it because I know that I will never order it in a restaurant. It wasn't that it wasn't fresh, briny and fatty (it was), it was just that I couldn't get the image of an actual sea urchin out of my head. I freaked myself out so much that the only thing I could imagine was something similar to the blob sitting on my tongue ...but with a heartbeat. Whether urchins have hearts or a circulatory system, that's not my purview, but I will say that I woman-ed up and tasted it. I'm sure that people who like urchin will think it's the best in the west, but I'm just not that girl. Same with oysters. People rave about Butterfly's oyster shots which come in a (wait for it...) shot glass. Same thing for me, I can't reconcile a wad of slime sitting in a glass waiting for me to eat it. Passed.  The cocktails were phenomenal as was our wait person. I have to give the waiter credit as he was informal, approachable, but not irreverent to the point of being obnoxious. He was mannered and cordial and attentive. Anywho, my mother ordered a Bloody Mary which looked like tomato stew there was so much produce in it. She loved it! (Let me see if I can remember what was in it: pickles, onion, celery, olives, and hot sauce.)  I ordered my usual gin and tonic which you can't really mess up, but it was good.  My mother had the Hangar steak which usually comes rare to med-rare. I had to convince her that it was similar in cooking technique to a flank steak (high heat and not cooked to death) and she relented and got it med-rare. She loved it. It was a pretty big hunk of meat, too. I tasted it and it was fantastic. (For an omnivore, nothing beats a good piece of steak.)  I had the Kalua Pork which was good, but I wasn't floored. Apparently it's standard on the menu in lettuce cups, but this time it was served differently and the taste combination was a bit off for me. (Don't get me wrong the pork was tender and delicious, it was just some kind of spice combination that wasn't great for me.)  The desserts were decadent and delicious.  Overall the experience was great. I didn't give it five stars because the staff was definitely overwhelmed on Mother's Day, but the highlight was that the chef came to our table and personally shared (in a humorous way) that the kitchen was \"going down fast\" and they were trying their best to make sure everyone was happy and pleased. That made the wait \"funner\", but it really wasn't that long for us. I felt sorry for some of the patrons who came in later --including the non-American tourists who apparently had no clue that it was Mother's Day-- because they had to wait much longer than we did. But then again, that's where making a reservation and planning well comes in.  All in all, courteous and attentive staff, great bar staff and cocktails, diverse and good looking, mixed age clientele (yup, that's more important than you think), magnificent view of the bay (you can even go outside for a bit of briny air), personable chef, and outstanding food. I would definitely go back again as I've heard they have a happy hour AND a jazz band.   Awesome place.",

    "review_text": "I came here with some friends for Dine About Town for lunch. We made a reservation 2 days in advance. The woman who seated us told us the selections they had on the Dine About Town menu were their most popular items. We were pretty excited.  The appetizers were superb. The Kahlua pig lettuce wraps were nothing short of amazing. The meat was smoky and the hoisin that came with it gave it a sweet little tang that went nicely with the crunchy lettuce. The portion size was also very generous. The calamari was good. In addition to the regular sort of aioli sauce most calamari comes with, it came on top of some cucumbers and soy sauce, which was a nice touch. The smoked salmon and strawberry rolls sounded like they'd taste really odd, but the dish pulled together really well. I really liked that each of the appetizers 'worked,' and were very well thought-out. The one thing I'd note is that the portions for the calamari and strawberry rolls seemed considerably smaller than the portion for the lettuce wraps.  The mains we ordered weren't as good as the appetizers, but they were still satisfying. The garlic noodles were simple and savory. They had little bits of shiitake mushroom in them, which I think really added depth to the dish. The fried snapper sandwich was basically fish, and heat (in the roll there was a piece of fried fish and half a whole chili [and a tiny bit of cabbage I think but definitely not enough]). The shaking beef Cobb salad I had had its ups and downs. The highlight of the dish would be the greens. They were really fresh, and dressed very well, and the quality of the avocado was divine. The beef and bacon were both just fine. The egg it came with however was a bit too raw to be very nice, and they were a bit aggressive with the amount and size of the individual blue cheese chunks.  Everything else-- the service was somewhat slow, and our waiter seemed to have no real time for us. The decor was pretty enough, and the bathrooms were clean. None of these small details detracted from or added to our lunch experience. I'd be really interested in coming back for the food, especially for events like Dine About Town, when the prices are low.",

We ordered their preset menu (which I guess was required with a party our size). It took us all a while to get situated and even longer to finally get our first drinks. We started with the salmon carpaccio (a little on the fishy side), duck confit spring rolls and fried calamari. The appetizers were the best part of the meal. I got the sesame encrusted ahi tuna that was extremely overcooked. About half the group got that order and no one came close to finishing the tuna. When we finally flagged down the waitress, she was not very accommodating. One person in our party asked why her tuna was so overcooked and our waitress was very hesitant about bringing her a new one. On average, it took our table about 3 times as long to get any kind of service. Drinks took about 10 minutes every time we wanted a new one. Definitely not a good place for large groups. I'm very disappointed with my overall experience at this restaurant and doubt I'll ever try this place again.",

Knowing damn well that any schintzy looking restaurant on the Embarcadero (with the exception of Palomino's) would probably charge an arm and a leg for a meal, I figured I'd save it for a special occasion. And, what better special occasion to go there than grabbing a Livingsocial deal I found in my inbox!? The voucher was $25 for $50 worth of food and drinks, and while some other people depicted having less than mediocre experiences at Butterfly, I had a great night and found that my money was well spent.  Even if I hadn't checked Yelp beforehand (which is something I recommend that everybody do before purchasing a deal on Groupon/Livingsocial/what have you), I would have been more than satisfied with the recommendations I received from our super friendly, patient, and knowledgeable waiter. He recommended we get the Kalua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups, the Pan Seared King Salmon, and the Grilled Hanger Steak \"Kalbi Style.\" To drink, we got The Daly Palmer Iced Tea and the Kumquat Margarita. Hands down, everything was DELICIOUS. All three dishes had the most savory, succulent, and moist meat, and the best combination of flavors and textures. Even the drinks well complemented our meal. While there was more to the Daly Palmer Iced Tea, the kumquat margarita was just as good.   I never used to be a huge fan of Asian fusion, but Butterfly made me into a follower! The service was great, the view of the Bay is beautiful, and the venue is nice and cozy with a modern twist. I will definitely be coming back here again.",

Didn't hear much about it so had no expectations about the place, and it turned out pretty good!  We ordered and shared a couple dishes, including the following: - Fire Fried Calamari (standard) - Big Sammy's Poke Tartar (tasty!) - Shrimp Bisque in Puff Pastry (not as rich as some other bisque I've had but still rich) - Soy and Mirin Glazed Black Cod (I've had better)  With dessert and drinks, the total bill came out to around $45 per person. It was good but more on the expensive side. I like the venue, and the service was great (the chef-owner Rob Lam even stopped by our table to introduce himself and see how our food was, which was nice!). Last-minute reservations were pretty easy to make which is nice for the indecisive. I wouldn't mind going back whenever I get the chance ...",

We were early so had a drink at the bar first (great cocktails) and then moved to a cozy booth for the prix fixe menu. The chef came over to greet us, and then stopped by later (remembering both our names and where we live) to see what we thought of the food. The servers were all on point, and even suggested other sights to see while we were in town. \u00a0  The menu was a perfect blend of traditional thanksgiving foods we were craving (turkey breast, twice baked potato, gingered cranberries, apple pie), plus a few items that added their own twist like fried sticky rice and curried pumpkin soup with shitake mushrooms. Everything was delicious and we left just as stuffed as if we had been at grandma's house -- if grandma's house was swanky and well decorated with someone else to do the dishes. \u00a0Bottom line, we spent less than a lot of other places offering Thanksgiving prix fixe menus and left completely happy with both food and service. I would definitely come back again on our next trip to SF.",

When we walked in at 7pm, of course no tables were available because I forgot to book reservations. (Oppsies!) That was ok because we snagged seats at the bar.  The interior is beautiful, the view is awesome... but my beef is with the food. I get the whole fine dining, fusion, small taster portions but that is if the food is rich and tasty. \u00a0-_- I ordered the Roasted \"Peking\" Duck w/ duck confit crepe, kumquat confit and hoisin cream sauce. When it came the presentation of the plate was clean and pretty.  BUT I believe that any interpretation of \"Peking\" at the very least, should have crispy skin and \u00a0peking spices. I do not think that the duck breast was properly rendered and chewy fat is not appeasing. It \u00a0was lacking in flavor overall. \u00a0I completely expected more of an rich umami taste when it came to the duck confit. I mean for $28 I was looking for rich, well balanced flavors.  My step mom ordered the Grilled Hanger Steak \"Kalbi Style\" w/ seared rice cake, asparagus, and sweet carrots.The hanger steak was cooked to her liking, the sauce was ok (I believe is was a veal jus) and the rice cake was interesting. To my this was a steak for $24. I guess we paid for the technique they used to cook it, \"Kalbi\" which is like Korean grilling. \u00a0We both had cocktails that were not overly sweet, which I can appreciate.  Overall, I was disappointed because I expected more. For me, I'm on to the next...",

But we made reservations for a Friday night and got a great little table by the window and the DJ. The inside was definitely not what I expected, but cute nonetheless. We sat down and immediately got edamame (instead of bread) with sesame seeds on it. Soo yummy and so awesome that it was free. We even asked for another serving of it and they were more than obliging.  We started with the kahlua pig which was phenomenal. I've had lots of kahlua pig in my life, but this was soooo flavorful and added with the bbq hoisin... so good. The appetizer could have actually been an entree, there was enough food. I ordered the ponzu hanger steak, the boy ordered the duck, and the in laws ordered the sea bass and cowboy steak. Everything was delicioius. My hanger steak was kind of bland. It was an excellently cooked steak but by no means could I tell that it was marinated in ponzu sauce. I should have asked for a side of sauce, but it was still tasty. Everyone else enjoyed their dish a lot.  The entire experience was great. Our server was sweet, our water was always filled, and the restaurant never got too loud, even with a DJ.  I'd definitely go back or highly recommend it like I'm doing now.",

The view is not spectacular as this restaurant is located in between two piers but you do get some of the water views but that's it. The ceiling is very high and the decor is quite interesting with a contemporary Asian flair to it. The lighting must be very beautiful in the evening. Our table was a U shaped booth which was comfortable but the seats were a bit low for us Asians. Our waiter was excellent! He recommended special cocktails, appetizers, etc. All throughout the meal, he checked on us with fresh water, clearing any dishes. \u00a0My Dsis ordered three appetizers: the duck spring rolls (nice, flaky wrap!), calamari (beautiful presentation and the ponzu cucumbers underneath...yum!) and kalua pork with butter lettuce wrap (fresh crisp lettuce with a flavorful bowl of shredded pork and sauce!) As for the entrees, two in our party ordered the brunch house smoked salmon egg benedict (the fresh orange egg yolk oozed out perfectly when cut into! Came with a mini pail of buttery steak fries and bowl of fresh fruit!) My Dsis and our other friend ordered the wagyu cheeseburger (they said it was delicious with the milk bun and large patty of meat. Came with all the fixings) My mom had the ahi sashimi salad (she was impressed with thick, large slices of ahi tuna. Did not care too much for the Thai black rice but did enjoy the sauce that went over the entire dish!) \u00a0I had the sizzling turmeric snapper (and it did come sizzling away in a mini iron flat fry pan! Seasoned just enough but not too much. The snapper was moist and firm...perfect! It comes with a side plate of Vietnamese rice noodles and butter lettuce to do some more wrapping but I enjoyed it all separately!) The portions are very decent and our Dmom mentioned how each and every sauce was distinct and delicious! Instead of ordering from the dessert menu (which I had studied before arrival!), my Dsis had surprised me with a custom cake she had brought into tthe restaurant before we got there! \u00a0Our waiter presented the cake with a single, classy candle (thank God...did not want to burn the place down!) After all the oohs and aahs, he took the entire cake back to cut into individual slices. The entire experience was awesome!! Since none of us had ever been there before, we did not know what to expect but I can speak for everyone and say that we were all pleasantly impressed!! The icing on the cake was when Butterfly's chef/owner came by to each and every table...he visited us twice and chatted about his restaurants (he has another one in the city!) and our NIners, etc! Very nice guy!!  The price of everything was very reasonable (according to my Dsis!) Though the dinner entrees are quite a bit more in $, we would love to go check it out!",

For appetizers we started with calamari and the kahlua lettuce cups. \u00a0The calamari was lightly battered and seasoned with five spice and garlic. \u00a0Nice rendition and not greasy at all. \u00a0The kahlua pork with the lettuce cups was smoky, but not overwhelming. \u00a0Both of these dishes were enjoyable. \u00a0  For entrees, I had the whole deep fried fish. \u00a0It was snapper this night. \u00a0It was presented on a bed of rice cake and black bean sauce with Chinese \u00a0sausage. \u00a0It was perfectly fried and the fish was presented vertically curled around a small mound of kimchee. \u00a0Delicious, but I will warn you that this was the highest priced entree on the menu. \u00a0My wife had the clay pot chicken roulade while my daughter had the Mirin glazed black cod. \u00a0They enjoyed both of their entrees. \u00a0  We did share a couple of desserts: the banana lumpias and the bread pudding. \u00a0The bread pudding was excellent. \u00a0The lumpias were good, perhaps the portion could've been larger. \u00a0  Overall the service was good although our waiter started off slow, but warmed up as the evening progressed. \u00a0  I thought the prices for the meal and drinks reasonable for the city. \u00a0Portions were not huge, but comensurate with the price range. \u00a0Although it's near Pier 39, Butterfly is a great alternative to all the schlock nearby. \u00a0If you're looking for a multi cultural Asian meal, then stop by Butterfly.",

I love your bay view, floor-to-ceiling windows, and local artwork (especially the huge sea urchin-like overhead lights), but the food! It leaves so much to be desired--like a money back guarantee.  I chose Butterfly as the site of this year's Thanksgiving dinner with my friends, and I'm still slightly embarrassed for it. Besides the dessert of pumpkin tart and apple turnover, there wasn't anything that was memorable or that justified the $45 per person.   The curry in the curried pumpkin soup overpowered everything that was in there. The wood oven roasted diestel turkey breast was dry, tough, and just terrible--I would've rather eaten a $5 rotisserie chicken from Costco on Thanksgiving. No joke.  As if this wasn't disastrous already, the entree didn't come with fried sticky rice, buttered green beans, and truffled shiitake mushroom sauce as promised on the menu. This is INEXCUSABLE and not to mention, false advertisement.  I also came here for lunch during the summer (thankfully not on my dime). I had the caramelized Maui onion soup and fried snapper sandwich (the latter admittedly tasted good). The soup had about a cup of cheese and what seemed like 1000 calories, though. I can afford 1000 calories, but do I want to use it on this peasant soup?  This just goes to show that everything named butterfly sucks (e.g. Mariah Carey's album, the swimming stroke that I could never master)... And why the butterfly was never a marshmellow in Lucky Charms. It's true.",

TAX AND TIP. i talked to the manager and informed them THEIR employee told me SEVERAL TIMES this was included in the prix fixe price, and he basically said nope, you're shit out of luck, it's in the contract you signed. so yeah, we all had to pony up more cash and it ended up being damned near 82$ each person. strike one. oh yeah, the food sucked balls and was not worth the insane prices. strike two.   fast forward a couple of years, my friend's celebrating her 21st birthday here. she tells us guestlist is open all night, 5$ cover. i shit you not, there are a good 40 of us waiting in line to get in. then around 11 45 the bouncers start yelling that guestlist is over, and we tell them we're here for the birthday party and her guestlist is open all night. \"GUEST LIST IS OVER.

Drinks were good and different, and the food was amazing! Our waiter was really attentive and friendly, and the place wasn't too loud. We had a table overlooking the water, and not once did we feel rushed.  We started the french onion soup and the lettuce wraps, each were very good. The soup came out piking hot, and the lettuce wraps were delicious. For our entree, we had the hoison glazed ribs and the duck confit. The ribs came with spam brown fried rice, which to our surprised was really really good! We're both not a fan of brown rice or spam too much, but they really knew how to do it right!! The duck confit was cooked perfectly as well.  Thought it was a nice touch that the owner/chef came out and greeted each table. He chatted with us for a bit and wished my hubby a happy birthday. Don't really get that kind of personal service in too many restaurants nowadays.",

    "review_text": "i had heard amazing things about this restaurant. unfortunately, the experience proved to be the complete opposite of all my expectations. first, a group of 6 of us arrived for brunch and waited a good 30 minutes in an empty restaurant before any server just as much acknowledged our table and offered to bring drinks. The waitress was unapologetic and oblivious to the fact that our table waited for so long. As they eventually brought our food out, i would say that 2 dishes of the 8 we ordered were up to par with my expectations of a somewhat classy dining setting. throughout our meal, our waitress seemed to be completely inattentive to our needs, and the whole experience, in general, made for a waste of dining energy. let this be my experience and not yours. butterfly is most definitely not worth the hype.",

    "review_text": "I've been here a few times. Once for happy hour, and a few times for lunch.  My favorite thing hands down is the steak fries. They're big and they're crispy on the outside, nice and potato-y on the inside. Delicious!  For appetizers I've tried the Garlic Seared Clams/Muscles, Duck Confit Spring Rolls, Fire Fried Calamari, and Shanghai Garlic Noodles. My two favorites were the noodles and the calamari. The calamari is just classic but done up with some delicious cilantro, cucumbers, and tabasco remoulade. Perfect combo of hot, spicy, fresh, and fried. Very fun.  For entrees I've tried the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna, Mushroom Dip Sandwich, and Kobe Beef burger.   The Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna was AMAZING. The black rice and wasabi cream were perfect. All topped with some fresh sashimi tuna. TOO GOOD. It's a small portion, but perfectly delicious. Can't wait to have it again.  The Mushroom dip sandwich was pretty good. Great big chunks of meaty delicious mushrooms paired with the comforting chewiness of melted mozzarella. The macadamia pesto was a nice touch too. Of course the steak fries were perfect as always. The only gripe I have with this dish is the au jus. It was very interesting and had some flavors of sesame oil and green scallions in it. Had a nice Asian twist, but in the end it was too salty. I hate hate hate salty food.   The Kobe Beef Burger was by far the most disappointing dish. Maybe I've changed personal taste preferences, but the Plant Burger down on Pier 3 is so much better than this beefy monster. I've had Kobe Beef burgers at other places, but I can't put my finger on why this one in particular wasn't that good... There is something missing and this dish can definitely be improved. Rather forgettable compared to the other dishes.  Ambience is very nice. Casual and unpretentious. The staff is friendly and professional, but never stuffy. The decor is decent and makes sense with the modern, casual, and slightly east asian vibe. The view is very pretty as well. It's right along the water and even during a gloomy day it's beautiful to see the sea lions or a docked cruise liner right at eye level. During the evening, the view isn't much to look at, but during lunch it's wonderful just to stare out there sometimes.  Chill place. I approve.",

Commis on piedmont ave in oakland is a perfect example of this. 5 stars.they buy all local ingredients and cater to a very small venue which creates a more intimate, custom experience. the food is balanced well and cooked to perfection. The poached egg is supposedly heaven although i have yet to try it. - \u00a0Also 2 stars just seems mean for butterfly, so i'm gonna raise it to 3.",

    "review_text": "I went here on April 20, 2013 with a large group of friends. One of my friends' friends selected this place. I should have known better. This guy is a mentally-challenged individual. Whoever allowed him to pick the place for our birthday dinner needs to be barred from making decisions in the future.  Let's start with the decor, I have no complaints here. It's got a full bar and barflies to boot. Lots of semi-attractive looking folks hovering the bar. The dining area seating looks like a lounge. It's spread out and part of it is against the wall..which are where the choice seating arrangements are. (in my opinion)   We sat way in the back..by the window which allowed us a nice view of the bay and the adjacent piers next to us. We started with drinks and appetizers. I have to say the appetizers were decent. We had some chicken wings which were large individual portions. Quite tasty.  Everything was cool like Fonzi until the main courses came out.  I ordered a steak and others ordered fish. When my steak came out I was anticipating something good..in light of the appetizers that we had. I thought it would be marvelous. Turns out it was anything but. The quality of the meat was iffy and the entire dinner once we started the main course was horrible. What could go so wrong within a short period of time? I guess anything is possible right? Life is unpredictable.   I try making good choices but seriously. The food was really off. My friends order the fish which came curved on a plate. It was deep fried and curved like they tried to make it into a Michelangelo work of art. The thing looked hideous and tasted like bones. Of course my friends were too gracious to say anything.   As the night wore on, I noticed the place was noticeably empty besides the couple next to us making out. It was disgusting really, there was this ape-like man gigolo with this clammy paws all over this Asian woman who looked like she's been through the wringer. Her face was peeling as her old face betrayed the amount of caked make up on her face. I kept doing double takes because she looked like she was a prostitute. I felt like I was in a bar in Thailand or something. It was seriously awful. \u00a0  There wasn't much going on..it really gave me the impression that this place is about to shut down at moment's notice. Seriously did. I wouldn't be surprised. I heard from another friend of mine that her uncle works there and told her it was struggling.   Like every restaurant in San Francisco, the food wasn't cheap. But there was a disconnect between the value of the meal we had to the cost of the meal. Hate to complain but it's really one of those places you should probably avoid. \u00a0I'm justifying paying the high cost of the meal based upon the decent service we got. The wait staff was good but I keep going back to the food (main course) which was less than zero.",

Mike the restaurant's general manager welcomes you and checks in with you inquiring about your dining experience. Chelsea, our very attentive server provided excellent recommendations. We started with the tuna tartar, a delicious and perfectly prepared cold appetizer. We also enjoyed the Shanghai garlic noodles. For entrees the braised short ribs practically melted in your mouth!

It is a big steak, which is meant to be shared. \u00a0So we did just that - shared the $40 22-oz steak. \u00a0And the verdict : FATTY, FATTY, FATTY. \u00a0I don't ever remember eating a steak that is that Fatty. \u00a0I was disgusted. \u00a0I felt sick and wanted to barf. \u00a0:(  Really sad that my previous impression of the best steak-in-town and \u00a0Butterfly has gone down the drain... and so far down that it's a point of no return. \u00a0What a shame.",

    "review_text": "I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and with both experiences I was pleased. (especially with dinner!)  LUNCH: As one would expect, lunch at Butterfly is a lot more casual than dining there at night. You'll have lower prices, short wait times, and less fancy fare. (A lot more sandwiches and salads appear on this menu.) I ordered the Kobe Beef Burger and, well... it tasted like a good hamburger. Nothing really to complain or rave about there. My friend got the wok-seared garlic noodles with chicken breast, and that was simply \"good\" as well.   The service was a little lax, but it was mostly because there was a pair of honeymooners that the waiter was focused on. I guess I didn't really mind since it was the special time, and the view of the water along with the ambiance kept me pleasantly distracted during downtime.   ------------------------- DINNER: Dinner here is ideal for a date, in my opinion. A lot of the tables are configured so that they seat two people, with the couple sitting side by side either looking out at the water or with the water behind them. The food and the drinks were all very good. We had a reservation at 8:30pm and weren't seated until 9, which was a little annoying since we had plans after, but the hostess gave us a round of drinks or appetizer on the house to make up for it, which was a nice gesture. I ordered the white sake sangria which was very tasty.   For dinner I had the macadamia and bleu cheese encrusted filet mignon. It was VERY DELICIOUS. It was served with mashed potatoes and other vegetables like asparagus, garlic, etc, but wow was that steak good. I wished that the portions were larger because it was so amazingly tasty. The bleu cheese wasn't overpowering and the sauce on it was so good that I wanted to lick my plate clean of it. I probably should have since the lighting in the restaurant was so dim. Drat.   For dessert we ordered something akin to BJ's Pizookie: A big cookie with ice cream on it. Eh, this was just mediocre. The cookie tasted uncooked and was very, very grainy. It felt like chewing on crunchy flour and whole sugar granules.   The bill was around $80 bucks for the two of us before they took off the two drinks for the long wait, and it was worth it because we had a really good time. I would seriously go back here for the delicious food if I had the money!",

The server wasn't on top of us at every turn and he gave us some good recommendations for food. But the most impressive part was the following...  The chef walked around asking if everyone was enjoying their meal and having a good time. When he got to my table we all really enjoyed our foot except for my father. When the chef asked my father what he thought he told him that the flavor was good but that the ny steak he got was a little tough (turned out the steak he'd been eating was marinated very well but my dad had been eating a particularly thin part of the steak. we tried it later and it was tender and delicious). The chef made no excuses, apologized, took the steak off the bill AND gave us two very delicious desserts for free. I've been to a lot of fine dining restaurants and the gestures of free food combined with the chef's genuine concern that we walked out of his establishment pleased with our meal was a rare and unique display of pride in the product and customer service. We all were very pleased (not just because of the free food but with the experience as a whole) and are looking forward to going back.",

    "review_text": "It's nice to see a restaurant find its wings again as my last experience three years ago was a bit on the marginal side. But as Dolly Parton so wisely composed in her Tennessee backwoods youth...  Love is like a butterfly As soft and gentle as a sigh The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings Love makes your heart feel strange inside It flutters like soft wings in flight  Ain't that purty...and gee, it has nothing to do with this restaurant, but I find you can always trust a large-breasted woman. 40 Double-D cup size just so y'know. And if the \"girls\" are wrong, who cares? They rule the world. And so does chef Robert Lam who has obviously sharpened the execution of his Asian fusion menu to a fine polish by now. Before, there was often a cloying sweetness to the dishes, but that wasn't evident this time around. No, the multicolored moods of our food were like the satin... well, you catch my drift. I came here with Jamie W. and a foodie friend who had suggested we take advantage of the Dine Around Town promotion.  My prior experiences with DAT menus have been hit-and-miss since restaurants often don't showcase their best dishes for the discounted prices, but Lam and crew pulled all the stops with a superb execution of their three-course $36.95 dinner special plus a few other items we couldn't resist. First up were the fusion-forward appetizers. The Salt and Pepper Fried Calamari had welcome touches of sweet (Ponzu-marinated cucumbers) and spice (Tabasco remoulade) (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1mkCoO1&amp;s=c089dd3b01ff17257c2fab16798ee6261a8b9ff6f28a78aff2c6c292aa70301c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1mkCoO1</a>). The Duck Confit Spring Rolls were concurrently moist and crunchy with the obligatory Chinese mustard and honey sauce providing the optimal balance of hot and sweet (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1o93RXc&amp;s=7b6abd61571b632b940ca004d2e6631d58589fea0a508f8bea4ce1679557952c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1o93RXc</a>).  The best of the trio was the Kahlua Pig in Butter Lettuce Cups accompanied by a hoisin BBQ sauce, pepper brunoise, toasted cashews and scallions (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1jTWS08&amp;s=4909511e57a521ec5f336fe4889582a8b497797fdd1a1688a1900c1378047c75\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1jTWS08</a>). As if that wasn't enough for pre-entree gluttony, we also ensnared and shared two Happy Hour specials: the Sesame-Coated Edamame sprinkled with Hawaiian Red Sea Salt (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1iMww53&amp;s=65634a61cd9fe56a633138b8b1d8b68135cd38b8a85e131b4e5a991251a9250f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1iMww53</a>) and four spoonfuls of \u00a0Bacon Dates with Maytag blue cheese, cashews and Pat Chun vinegar (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1o944cT&amp;s=244364ef09d17b9671e8f630342eeb83699ee18576b2d1da534bb83d28acf1c7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1o944cT</a>). Both provided more than satisfying mouthfuls which tied us over to our main courses. Two of us (including me) were in a risk-averse mode and ordered the Teriyaki Grilled Hanger Steak medium rare.  While you might expect a predictably oversweetened rendition from past experience, it was instead tempered expertly with a potato leek gratin, sugar snap and sweet pea stir fry, sliced portobello mushrooms, and a miso jus de veau (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1nKVL5q&amp;s=1f7a8442df169f38bba97e0846ea58038b008fb4f22d31995c47736acfebfccc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1nKVL5q</a>). The result was savory splendor without being the least bit cloying. Jamie surprised me by requesting the Young Turmeric Grilled Snapper, a hearty filet with caramelized onions and herbs, rice noodles, butter lettuce cups and a nuoc cham dipping sauce (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FTDAv8H&amp;s=659bf3b92d08abf0e150dbe63885fbcc13081280f4721f093a34cc122c34af1d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/TDAv8H</a>). It was a veritable feast fit for Neptune, at least if Neptune turned out to be a pescetarian with a pitchfork.  Room for dessert? Oh sure, why not go all the way. We all ordered the Warm Banana Bread Pudding with Macapuno Ice Cream (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1iMx3E4&amp;s=53e4fb60f69247b1678e75210d617c91f26027095929c6dfbeb9d95cc191afb3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1iMx3E4</a>). It worked because it was comparatively petite and packed with island-style flavor. By the way, I couldn't possibly neglect mention of the stellar cocktails. I first had a Dirty Ketel One martini at their $8 Happy Hour price (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1wEDjRi&amp;s=c923d268c8f151d7834f9130ee86a0ceb0f8d7eb10e3c75d9e370c6b4a701bb4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1wEDjRi</a>), and then upon recognition of an unexpected lull in the service, we were rewarded with complimentary Espresso Martinis, which weren't even on their bar menu but executed with style and precision nonetheless by the bartender (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FUPhIbd&amp;s=4cacde5085ac4902ff57d4f29b6c3559be9abb56f2bd7b492efcc3da568add17\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/UPhIbd</a>).  The setting is as cavernous as my last visit, but it looks like they dismantled the window booths for more open views. Smart move. Jamie mentioned they should consider moving the bar to the street side so passers-by could see what a convivial place it is.Good suggestion. \u00a0Even as we were rendered immobile from our shared gluttony, chef Lam took the initiative to be warm and cordial to us (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1vcP6DU&amp;s=2410222a9a707d6682f0d7c255feba8777d960e864204d1f54bd58cad226b13a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1vcP6DU</a>). When Jamie mentioned to him that I Yelped, he immediately recognized me as Ed U. and complimented my by calling me his Food Buddha - even though I was probably rubbing my ample belly at the time. I think I turned beet red.  FOOD - 5 stars...a major upgrade from my previous experience here...now truly a culinary destination worth mentioning to fellow foodies AMBIANCE - 4 stars...still cavernous, still a tad noisy but not too crowded SERVICE - 5 stars...thanks to chef Lam's personal attention, a major plus TOTAL - 5 stars...this Food Buddha is happy to rediscover the satin wings of this Butterfly",

Got inside with my friends and I could count exactly 2 Halloween decorations in the place. For $40 you would think they could do a better job but I guess not.

I am giving this place one star because the service was lacking, they can't make a seared ahi tuna and the overall dining experience was not worth my time or money. \u00a0There were only two other tables occupied in the restaurant. \u00a0The manager seemed to spend most of his time with one table, often stopping to chat for long periods of time. \u00a0At the end of their meal, I overheard him ask their server to give them a discount. Lovely. During the evening, the manager also stopped to greet the other table, introducing himself and shook hands with the people at the table. \u00a0I was quite impressed that he wanted to greet the people dining in his restaurant. \u00a0Not once did he come over to our table or smile while making eye contact. \u00a0He did move our stroller away from our table to make room for guests to sit at the table next to us. \u00a0He said nothing to me at all and just moved our stroller next to the wait staff's computer, partially in their way. \u00a0Thanks Mr. Manager for not saying a kind word to us while dining at your restaurant, for rudely moving our stroller without asking and for completely ignoring us while clearly paying attention to the other two tables. \u00a0Our waitress was detached and mechanical. \u00a0  My husband ordered the seared ahi tuna. \u00a0Someone needs to teach the cook how to correctly sear tuna. \u00a0Should have called it \u00a0medium rare done ahi tuna steak. \u00a0 My husband spent the rest of the night on the toilet battling his explosive poo. \u00a0Poor guy. \u00a0I could have botched the tuna on my own and saved us the money and my husband's butt. \u00a0I had really hoped that my husband and I could add this restaurant to our list of restaurants to dine out frequently especially with the cool swanky decor. \u00a0sucks  The prices have gone up since being there last. \u00a0It is definitely no longer worth the time, money or explosive poo.

The space was very sleek and chic, with enourmous windows spotlighting the amazing views of the East Bay. It was really hot in the venue, perhaps due to a suprise Indian Summer night, so we spent a lot of time out on the narrow patio enjoying the spectacular view. Inside, we hit the busy dancefloor, and on the edges of the room it was tough to carry on any coversation.   The primary bar was packed, and we waited about 10 minutes at a time for drinks. Service was very slow, but the lycheetini was fantastic, and the vodka tonics were nice and strong! At one point I got a gin and tonic by mistake. Normally I'd ask for another drink, but I couldn't stand waiting in line again.The second bar, with much shorter lines, was hard to spot and only took cash.",

    "review_text": "01/25/2015 Trying out their $40 Dine About Town menu. As I walked in to the restaurant, I was greeted by the hostess. Generally your first impression starts with the hostess. Her social skills must have come from being trained in a Chinatown restaurant. This just means I need to drink more. The windows span from the floor to the ceiling with unobstructed view of the Bay and giant sea urchans hanging from the ceiling. So they are not presenting their Dine About Town menu with their regular menu. You actually have to ask for it (well I did, saw a couple across the table with DAT menu in main menu) Thought this was for charity.   So I ordered the Duck Confit, Hanger Steak, and Banana Bread Pudding and for a drink I ordered the Honey Bourbon. They didn't put a napkin down on the table for the drinks. Now they are sliding around on the lacquered table.   The complimentary pre-course was Sesame Seed Oiled Edamame, a Oyster Amuse Bouche, which tastes like a Spicy Bloody Mary, Shiso Leaf Poke and Spam Onigira (fried spam roll). This was very yummy and a great way to start the taste buds.   The Duck Confit with the Mustard Sauce was good. Not great. It's a cut up egg roll with sauce. What more can you do with it.   The Hanger Steak was good. A perfect medium rare. And the Demi glaze was perfect with the potatoes. I'd order this again \u00a0  Now I'm fat and here comes dessert. Banana Bread Pudding. This was so delicious, warm, and cool with the ice cream and caramel.   Total bill came out to just over $50. Well worth the try. If you can, eat there for lunch and enjoy the view of the bay.",

Cocktails. Yes the cherry blossom is yum (black cherry vodka and stuff) but not quite enough of a kick. I would have added something carbonated to it as well to make it sparkle.  Wine list - mostly Napa Sonoma, all of which were overpriced. Better off ordering a French or Italian bottle because the tourists all want Napa Sonoma, so the French or Italian bottles are more accurately priced.  Appetizers - typical Asian fusion, lots of sesame oil, garlic in some cases. The green papaya salad with shrimp would have been good if the shrimp was fresh. Edamame with sesame was, well, edamame with sesame, kinda hard to mess that up. Some kind of lumpia with a sesame/wasabi dipping sauce was tasty enough, but not enough to really make you close your eyes and relish the moment.  Meal - I ordered the ahi tuna which was nicely presented on a tempura onion ring filled with scallops and onions in a tasty soy based marinade. The ahi was a rather large chunk which was \"seared\" for not long enough, which meant that is wasn't really even warm and was basically a hunk of raw meat. Now, I regulary eat pieces of raw meat, but the quality of this particular chunk did not warrant such rawness. The ahi was very membranous, so it was difficult to cut and some bites were difficult to swallow because even chewing it didn't eliminate the toughness. \u00a0The sesame crusting was good though.   Dessert - A nice selection of classics. I had the banana bread pudding which was accompanied by a macapuno icecream and carmelized bananas. I'm glad the dessert was good because I left a lot of the main course on my plate and was still hungry.  Service - Friendly, casual service. \u00a0A few blips, like the bread being brought out after the main course. I didn't even know bread went with asian fusion?  Ambiance - Loud music being spun by a female DJ consisted of everything from Prince to Old Dirty Bastard to Bob Marley. \u00a0Kind of entertaining I guess. \u00a0Simple modern decor (nothing cutting edge) with a nice view of the bay.  Stars - two stars because it was easy to get a table, decent service, decent ambiance, and good dessert. The food ideas were good, but the ingredients needed better quality, and the dishes and local wine list were way overpriced. \u00a0The 3rd star is because I did have a good time and there was plenty of festive atmosphere to bring a group of friends.",

The views from this place is what earns it its three stars and it is right on the embarcadero so pretty good placement for other restaurants and lounges and getting a cab later on in the night--but for me weak drinks kinda kill anyone's experience",

    "review_text": "This is definitely what I envision when a restaurant claims to be Asian Fusion, an actual integrative taste. \u00a0Usually when I go to Asian Fusion restaurants, it tastes like Americanized Asian food. \u00a0Today, I ordered the Pig in a hole sandwich, which is served on thick, buttery bread. A hole is cut in the center and an egg is in its place. \u00a0The sandwich includes kalua pork, bacon, and cheese. \u00a0The sandwich was served with fruit, lettuce, onions, pickles, and steak fries. \u00a0My friend ordered the mushroom scramble. \u00a0We started off the meal with a ceasar salad (one order split in two=plenty). \u00a0Everyone gets edamame which seems to be seasoned with sesame oil and seeds. \u00a0The sandwich melted in your mouth. \u00a0My only suggestion for improvement is possibly serving the sandwich on thinner bread. \u00a0The crust was particularly hard to chew and I ended cutting it off. \u00a0I'm not a carb counter...I will eat them for sure, but there were so many carbs (fries and bread) that it just seemed to 'waste space' when the clear winner was the middle of the sandwich. \u00a0  A bonus is the waiter was very attentive. \u00a0We were engrossed in deep conversation, and so we didn't necessarily need all the attention, but it was nice to see that he cared. \u00a0A great experience especially if you are in the area. \u00a0Today King Street was closed off for the street fair so it was a bit of a challenge to drive here and park. \u00a0It was worth it though! \u00a0It was nice to see the club/lounge that I liked to go to a few years back is actually a great restaurant too!",

    "review_text": "Living in SF is wonderful. You have to admit though that each neighborhood is so self-sufficient that you could really get into a little routine of your own--always frequenting the same places such as: the bank that you can walk to, the coffee shop, the corner grocery stores, the neighborhood bars and restaurants etc. \u00a0And. then you have that (eureka!) moment one day when you realize and/or remember that there are other parts of the city to explore!   This is why I am recommending that you try Butterfly. \u00a0It's a restaurant on Bay Street/Embarcadero that sits on the water. \u00a0It's a reminder as to why SF is known for it's restaurants. \u00a0The decor is really cool with those huge hanging \u00a0sea urchin- like lamps and interesting lighting throughout.  The portions are generous! \u00a0We started with:   Kalua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups 10 Hoisin Barbeque Dipping Sauce, Pepper Brunoise, Toasted Cashews, Minced Green Onions AND Garlic Seared Clams &amp; Mussels 12 Lemongrass and Coconut Curry Broth, Sesame Grilled Bread, Picked Cilantro Leaves  We then shared the  Classic Caesar Salad 10 Chilled Hearts of Romaine, Parmesan Croutons, Fresh Grated Parmesan Cheese  Next came the entrees. \u00a0We both had the same dish: Crab &amp; Mascarpone Stuffed Crispy Chicken Breast 25 Sweet Summer Corn and Rock Shrimp Ragout, Arugula Salad Aged Balsamic Vinegar, Lobster and Orange Reduction  Again people---the portions are GENEROUS. (sorry about the caps but I wanted to emphasize the portion size!)  Dessert was: Banana Bread Pudding 7  We each had 2 martinis--I tried the lycheetini (Belvedere vodka, lychee puree)--and a glass each of Noah's Zinfandel. \u00a0The martini was tasty but too sweet for me so I switched back to just Belvedere with 2 olives. The zinfandel was a great find! \u00a0And, it was 8 bucks a glass.  The entire bill came to $154.00 and we went home with a doggy bag.  I only gave this restaurant 3 stars because the service was a bit lacking. \u00a0Here's why in no particular order:  \u00a0(forgotten bread plates, forgotten tableware, no bread and water until they \"remembered\" to bring it out, soiled napkins (from eating that delicious Kalua Pig wrap) weren't replaced until asked, the waiter \u00a0kept hitting my chair with his foot, they never lit the candle on our table, the wine took forever to get to the table, we were never \"crumbed\", a waitress dropped a huge wine glass in front of our table and it hit the floor so hard that it shattered by at least 4 tables and took a while to clean up)  Yes, I'm going back--the food is tasty and creative. \u00a0The chef took his time and visited every table to see how the food was--and, it felt great to get out of the neighborhood that we live in.",

Service: Fantastic Food: Delectable  Drinks: Adequate Location: Convenient with a view  Ambiance: Romantic \u00a0  We made a reservation for 7:30pm for the \"dine about SF/SF Restaurant Week\" selection priced at $40.00 per person. The pricing was definitely reasonable for the portion of the food and the quality of the other characteristics. Amuse: simply intoxicating, both of us were trying to pick one and we found out you wet given all three each! There was a Bloody Mary oyster shooter, a poke bite, and a spam fried concoction (which took us both by surprise in how decadent it tasted). Order wise I would say go: 1. Poke  2. Bloody Mary oyster shooter (fabulous)  3. The spam bite ...but that's just me. All three were great, the poke had a bit too much of leaf flavor (personally) but my friend loved every bite. Regarding number one I would suggest putting it in your chomper at one time but try to roll it around in your mouth so you capture all of the flavor.  The appetizers we chose were the duck confit and pork lettuce wraps. Both. Were. Magnificent! We didn't choose the calamari because you could get that anywhere but I'm sure it would be amazing as well! Personally, I liked the pork better...there were so many flavors in one but the duck was definitely scrumptious as well. Every last bite was gone and the sauce the duck came with was mui delicioso! Haha. For the main course I had the catfish and my friend had the animal style (pork, steak, shrimp, and veggies) garlic noodles. Both were definitely big enough to share, we each ended up taking some home. The catfish was fresh and cooked to perfection, the steak in the garlic noodles was a bit over cooked for my personal taste but it has a great Korean-BBQ-flavor-ish. The pork was the best additive according to my friend and the garlic noodles melted in your mouth.  For dessert I got the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and he got the banana bread pudding. He said there was some sort of \"different taste\" in there but he ate most of it and it looked divine. My creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was my first and it was great, I just have nothing to compare it to.  The drinks were standard and fair priced, their spiced apple cider was delicious! Plus, their tea was perfect for my little cold (non-alcoholic tea). Great experience, especially meeting one of the owners during our dessert course and we had a great server as well. All in all, we will be back again (especially in the day time to see the view since you're literally ON the water!)!! (The .5 deduction was for our server over charging us, brown lettuce (for the lettuce wraps) and forgetting a drink, he definitely made up for it with the bill, to go food, and the fact that he kept a smile on his face. Due to this it does not deter me in any way!)",

Once I learned it was an Asian fusion place, I was already a little wary. But, I'm always up for new foods and being objective about it. My appetizer was actually super tasty - smoked salmon carpaccio over wasabi crackers. But it is carpaccio if its smoked? These little tidbits didn't matter to me as it was so super tasty I nearly scarfed it down. The duck confit spring rolls were rather odd - a fried spectacle of of 4 powder covered rolls and some sweet sauce. The first thing that happens when I put it in my mouth is a sense of confusion as it was an extremely unexpected flavor that didn't really consist of much duck.   My main course was a hangar steak with mushrooms and potatoes au gratin - a little cold, a lot boring. The steak was rather tender, but the mushrooms were tastier than the steak. And the au gratin in a separate bowl was a mash of grease and government cheese. It was the most unspectacular boxed potatoes I'd had in a long time.  Dessert wasn't so horrible, but strangely described as a warm chocolate torte with coffee ice cream and rasberries. It shipped out to me with a single rasberry on top of a rather bland torte.   The service here was wonderful, but I typically like to think I've come to a restaurant for the food. I'm plenty used to cheap chinese restaurants with horrible service and excellent food. I'd just imagined that a pricier asian restaurant would have excellent food and excellent service. I just one one of the above.",

    "review_text": "I've been here a few times and have generally liked most what I've had. The most recent time I was here was early this year, to a restaurant that was not particularly busy. I ordered the vegetarian trio, which at the time consisted of a curry, fried onigiri, and a chawanmushi dish. The curry was possibly the best hearty curry of sweet potato and more, really good stuff. I also enjoyed the fried onigiri; it came with two crispy golden triangles. The egg dish was the one letdown, looking over-steamed and maybe too vinegary among other things. We mentioned this to the waiter since he asked how was the food, and the chef came out to check up on us. He admitted that the dish didn't look right, apologized, and mentioned and that he was trying to experiment with something new and still making tweaks for that 3rd item in the trio (normally a simple dish like pea shoots). Since we weren't happy, and learning that I was a \"meat eater pretending to be vegetarian\", he comped us an order of perfectly plated Shanghai garlic noodles with surf 'n turf(!), so that was pretty awesome. The shrimp and beef themselves were tender and a flavorful add-on to the bowl of noodles and veggies. This dish was good, although you need to know what you're getting into before you order it. They are not the heavily garlicky buttery noodles you can find in a lot of Vietnamese places around here. This has a lot more going on ingredient-wise, has more of an oyster sauce flavor, and the garlic is more subtle compared to the in-your-face punch of the vietnamese places.  I love that the chef takes pride in his cooking and is willing to push his boundaries, while being very considerate of his customers' feedback. The service here is good, ambiance a little on the classier side (which coincidentally makes their website theming look a bit out of place), and the drinks pretty tasty. Hope they keep on improving!",

    "review_text": "I have to start off by saying for as much as this restaurant charges for it's tiny portions, the service was unbelievably slow and inattentive.  I was invited last night to attend my good friends pre-wedding dinner along with seven others. They knew well in advance we had a reservation for a larger party and you would think they would have their staff be more attentive, considering we would spending a lot of money, including having to pay an 18% automatic gratuity.  My husband and I arrived first and were seated. We ended up waiting over half an hour for the rest of our party to show up. In the meantime, it took the staff 20 of those minutes to offer us something to drink. Once the rest of the party came, it took another 30 minutes to ask them what THEY wanted to drink as well as take our orders.   In my opinion, the menu didn't offer much selection and everything seemed to run pretty expensive. We were already strapped for money prior to accepting the invitation to dinner, but felt even worst when there didn't seem to be anything worth the money to order. The others didn't seem overly impressed with the selection either, for that matter.  The hubby and decided to make a meal of appetizers; we ordered one of the fried calamari to split and two orders of the shanghai garlic noodles as our courses. Our first appetizer took over half an hour to arrive and our appetizer courses took another. I will say that although most of the food would be below average in flavor and size, the calamari was very good and the garlic noodles were a decent portion and had plenty of nicely grilled veggies and slices of roasted garlic in them.   Aside from our appetizers and the atmosphere, the service for the price you were paying was HIGHLY lacking and the 18% gratuity was more than what I would have paid for the kind of treatment the bride to be and the rest of us were getting.   Let me elaborate..They made no special attempt to see that our friend was having a good time right before her wedding, which you would think they would if they wanted us to recommend this place to others. I mean at least offer the bride a complimentary drink, dessert or appetizer for being so inattentive. Mind you it was not even crowded at that time and we waited an hour an half total for food and drinks, with only half an hour to enjoy them before having to leave.   I very rarely give two stars but I felt that waiting over an hour for someone to take our order and half another to get our drinks would justify this. The two stars I am giving is strictly for the location and our appetizers. I will also mention that it took them another half an hour to get our bill as my husband and I had to leave early because we had a long drive back to Vallejo and it was already 10pm. Our reservation was for 7:30 and most of that time was just spent on waiting for someone to acknowledge our presence. On another not so positive note, I noticed that the hostess wished everyone else a good night as they were leaving, however, didn't say a word to us.   Overall, I don't recommend coming here if you're starving, broke or just a tourist who has no idea that the city has plenty of other good dining districts. But if you just want to try some decent appetizers, I would tell you to use their \"take our\" window to avoid the long wait and having to pay a tip. Otherwise, if you truly want some really good fancy Asian fusion, I would recommend trying \"The House\" in the north beach district. The service there is average but the food will not disappoint and their dessert is just as creative and unique!",

    "review_text": "HAPPY HOUR REVIEW ONLY:  Went here for a birthday celebration and because we read on Yelp the Happy Hour was great. We had a great booth facing the windows, but since it was dark out we didn't get much of a view. The decor is pretty to look at though, so we didn't much mind.  The waiter didn't give us the happy hour menu when we sat down - we had to ask for it, which was a little annoying. He only brought one copy of it, and when I asked for more copies so we could all order (there were 6 of us) he said it was his last copy (there were no more than 10 people in the restaurant at the time).  In any case, the food was great. We ordered everything!: the Kobe Sliders (yummm!), duck rolls, edamame, oyster shooters, mussels, garlic noodles, steak fries... it was all good. The only thing I didn't like was the calamari. The thai caipirinha was also delicious - and strong! especially for a happy hour drink!  The waiter was nice enough to tell us when it was last call for happy hour. It wasn't cheap, but we got out of there for about $25 each including food, drinks and tip - pretty good in my book.  I would definitely go back here for the food!  UPDATE: Came to try the full menu and had a hard time choosing just one entree! Everything not only looked good but nearly everything I ate was delicious!   Glad those mussels and clams were still on the main menu, cuz that has the best flavor i've ever had in my life. I ordered the lobster stuffed chicken with shrimp, corn and arugula - also delicious! Blue cheese and macadamia nut crusted filet was cooked to perfection. The Chawan Mushi was a bit weird and too smoky for me, but it was unique, I'll give 'em that.  Best part was the chef came out several times to talk to us and see how we were enjoting our food. It was a great experience.",

Our waiter was incredibly nice, and he looked stressed because he was tending to a majority of the tables. My food was okay, I didn't do back flips for it.

I was slightly early, so I went to the bar to grab a drink and wait for the rest of my party.   I lucked out, as it was still happy hour, which runs from 4 to 7pm and has amazing appetizer selection. I could have had a great meal for cheap, but that will have to wait for another day. The bartender was sweet and very knowledgeable; she made a mean Manhattan and had a great list of cocktails to offer.   Once my family arrived we got an amazing booth by the window with a floor to ceiling view of the bay. Our server was quite attentive and recommended a delicious bottle of Rutini Malbec ( i need to find this bottle elsewhere) to go with our entrees... it was a great recommendation. We also sampled many of the cocktails from the list... we couldn't stop passing them around. Actually, come to think of it, I don't think I got mine back after the first sip.   As for the food: Ahi tempura rolls, onion soup, hamachi, pork lettuce cups, and duck rolls were only the beginning and it was a great start. The entrees were just as memorable, from the cowboy steak and whole fried fish, to the succulent duck entree; it's no wonder we didn't have anything left to take home.   Dessert can be summed up in 7 words: Banana bread pudding with macapuno (Mitchell's) ice cream. I love a place that can support local ice cream shops and makes such an amazing dessert.

    "review_text": "Note: This is a review strictly for Happy Hour!  A five star happy hour! \u00a0  And those stars are solid, strong, sure. \u00a0  I am a huge fan of happy hours, it's one of the great perks and reasons why I love being in my mid-20s - working, finally having a disposable income for things like happy hour, having the freedom and time and luxury to enjoy these things. \u00a0  I especially love happy hour places with great food, and I'm happy to say that Butterfly is now on my list of solid happy hour spots with good food and good drinks.  I came here today, around 4:30pm, with Betty W., after a stroll down the Embarcadero. \u00a0It was a great decision to stop in here.  More deets on why I'm lovin' it so hard:  + Duck confit rolls ($7) were totally delicious. \u00a0A bit pricey considering they only give you four small rolls, but they were hella tasty, my taste buds were majorly freaking out! \u00a0 + The salmon crostini ($5) was pretty good too, cooling salmon on slightly salty piece of chip, and the wasabi whip cream was very light. \u00a0 + The kahlua pork appetizer ($5) - they give you a GENEROUS amount of kahlua pork in a substantial bowl, with enough lettuce cups. \u00a0Add a dollop of hoisin sauce on top, and I was diggin' the perfect piece of food I held in my hand. + Betty W. got a glass of chardonnay ($5), and they give you such a HEFTY POUR. \u00a0Generous! \u00a0And pretty tasty, score! \u00a0I ordered a cocktail with Hangar One pear vodka ($5), and my eyeballs popped out of their sockets in happy surprise - you know, like one of those crazy cartoon characters. \u00a0Not the strongest I've ever had, but it was VERY tasty; the pear was very prominent and a unique, but welcoming taste. \u00a0Can I get another one, please?!  In addition, there's a nice view, although today the view was really sad and dark, but I imagine on a nice summer day, it would be gorgeous, with the water and the bay and all that lovely beautiful stuff. \u00a0I made a mental note to myself to come back here on a nice spring or summer night in 2010.  The pricing was good and reasonable too, especially for a place on the Embarcadero. \u00a0Most appetizers were $5, some were $7, and they have $1 oyster shooters and edamamme. \u00a0Cocktails and wine are $5, and they have a good beer selection (including Hefeweizen FTW!) for $3. \u00a0  Our three appetizers and two drinks came out to $29 after tax - not bad at all! \u00a0In addition, our server was personable, friendly, and she even gave us a lychee from her stash after we were eyeing it and asked for one! \u00a0Food and drinks came quickly too, very efficient.  So, seriously, what's not to like? \u00a0Delicious and unique drinks, delectable and substantial appetizers that leave you respectably filled but not stuffy full, reasonable prices, and breath-taking views. \u00a0   Oh yeah, add some girl talk and conversations about life-love-food-hopes-dreams-fears-and-more. \u00a0A great setting and backdrop for a good, tasty, thoughtful time with a friend. \u00a0This growing up thing ain't half bad, isn't it? \u00a0I like it more and more each day.  Cheers to Butterfly, I'll be back for sure.",

It's a fancier restaurant located on Pier 33, so come here when you are not too hungry or for a special occasion as they have nice ambiance and good service.  Now on to dessert; if you are here for a special occasion dinner, do not skip dessert. We tried four dishes: warm banana ice cream pudding, classic cream brulee, warm chocolate lava cake with ice cream and lychee shaved ice. Everyone was woo-and-ahh'ing when we took the first bite at each dish; \u00a0within a few minutes everything was gone! \u00a0The warm banana ice cream pudding and lychee shaved ice was so good I wanted to order a 2nd!

We did have to wait a little to get our appetizers, but once we complained to our waiter, the manager came out to apologize and went out of his way to help make us happy. His recommendation on the dessert dishes were great; we were all very happy with the quality and flavor of the dishes.   My only complaint is that their menu seems to be very limited, so you don't have too many choices.

And now for the juicy part - the recap on the food. \u00a0We tried almost everything on the brunch menu - poached eggs, oysters, kalua pork, club sandwich, sashimi salad, soup duo, kobe beef burger, grilled snapper. \u00a0For dessert, we had their fried bananas lumpia (yummy goodness) and chocolate torte (a little too sweet for my tastes). \u00a0I would recommend sticking to their Asian fusion items over their American fare as these are the real stand-outs. \u00a0I sampled a little bit of everyone's plates and the Kalua pork, sashimi salad, and grilled snapper knocked my socks off! The complexity of the flavors was intense! \u00a0Hats off to the chef.  As for my family, they were (to my relief) impressed! \u00a0Crisis averted.",

There were two choices: Molten Lava Cake with Coffee Ice Cream, and Creme Brulee. I was impressed with both of them, but this may be because I had to wait 30 minutes after finishing my mediocre main-dish to experience them (more on waiting later).   2) Some appetizers were interesting. I had the fried calamari which was topped with what looked like Cilantro/Coriander sprouts. Very unique and different!  Okay, now that the good is over with, let's get to what didn't go so well...  1) \"Brunch\" took 2.5 hours to finish. Most of this time was spent waiting for things to come. After our appetizers, we waited at least 30 minutes before our main dishes (they screwed up the order on these, by the way) came out. And the same wait after our main dishes for our desserts. Oh by the way, they delivered some of the appetizers to us within minutes of our ordering. In fact, they had mistakenly delivered them to us -- they were actually intended for another table. My table of six paid a required 18% gratiuity for this haltingly slow service.   2) The food was mediocre. Besides desserts and the appetizer I had, everything was overall mediocre. I had the torta topped with egg and this strange strongly-\"blueish\"-cheese that was melted. This course was greasy and tasted very strange due to the cheese. I also tried the duck confit egg roll appetizer -- ugh. Who came up with the sauce for that one? The wasabi in the sauce was enough to burn a hole through my stuffed up nose. And the duck itself was bland and tasteless. I would have been happier eating normal egg rolls.   Maybe it was dine about town, or maybe this restaurant is overhyped. In any case, I'm not going back anytime soon.",

For obvious reasons ($$$).  I couldn't decide: 4 or 5 stars? \u00a0But there was something on my last visit that put Butterfly over the 4 star edge...  sugar water.  This was maybe my seventh visit to Butterfly since I started working in the wharf neighborhood about 2 years ago. I first came here as part of the \"Dine About Town\" event (check it out - <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfdineabouttown.com%2F&amp;s=9a49fb294e1ca079ae963c5f5b14d0c7a4f52a538e8fd1ec7aac9f5f773afba7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sfdineabouttown.com</a>) I had an excellent meal and have since returned for celebratory lunches for coworkers or meeting family on the wharf while at work. Every time the food has been consistently delicious, the service attentive and the view is lovely, too (right on the water).  We came to celebrate my coworker's move to Korea--it was his last day in our office. The waiter brought the two plates of edamame that come in place of the restaurant standard bread basket. These edamame are very yummy - drizzled with a sesame based, rice vinegar dressing and sesame seeds and salt--the best edamame in town. We also ordered their calamari which are crispy, light and nicely spiced with a piquant dipping sauce. We fought (politely) over the last piece.  I recommended the Tumeric Grilled Snapper and two of the group gave this a try. It's the best dish on the menu and always pleases--sizzling snapper and onions and fennel served up in a small cast iron pan with Vietnamese style accoutrements: lettuce for rolling up the tasty fish, bean sprouts, mint and rice noodles and a dipping sauce to finish it off just right.   I decided to stray from that favorite of mine and tried the Sashimi Trio Salad -- this was also well prepared and served with a sticky black Thai rice that I've never had before. It wasn't as satisfying as the snapper, but a good light meal.  My friend next to me had the coconut curry chicken which would've been my second choice and it looked very interesting and tasty. I might try it next time...  I had ordered a pot of hot tea - a marvelously fragrant earl grey -- and was looking around the table for the cream. I saw that my friend had a little white pitcher next to his plate so I asked \"is that cream?\"--he said \u00a0\"No, it's like sugar dissolved in water\" -- I then saw he was having an ice tea. That did it. This place is now definitely five stars.   I like ice tea...do you like ice tea? If you do, you'll know what an effort it is to try and get sugar to dissolve in an icy liquid.  Fifth Star: Attention to detail.  One criticism--what is with the billing process? We are always coming here from work for lunch, so the wait for the check OR the wait for the return of the credit card is abysmally long and frustrating. Every time. I often get up and retrieve it to expedite our departure. But not enough of a complaint to detract from the excellent food.",

I went to Butterfly's to-go lunch counter for the Clam Chowder and not only did it have shrimp but BACON... oh good lord...I'm a fish/veggie eater...so I was kinda bummin' about the bacon at first. I was so hungry...so I ate it anyway (shhhh...don't tell)... and I have to say... it was delish! Okay okay...maybe the fatty bacon-y goodness was what did it. But I'd like to think that it was sourdough bread they put at the bottom of my to-go bowl.  This place likes to kick things up a notch... Don't just give me a piece of bread with my soup...put the bread UNDER the soup...to soak up the buttery creamy goodness... then get that bacon in there and - WHAM! Heart-Pattering-Happiness.  I find that this is a nice place to go for a to-go meal...just as much as all the other places near by... although I will make sure to be sure they don't have meat in my food - they weren't too slammed to accommodate my busy schedule during my short lunch break. Plus - if you've got the time...you can go and sit on the dock... sittin' on the dock of the bay - with your bacon-y soup.  Yum.",

We had an early reservation (5:30) but service was still kinda slow at first. But once our order went in, stuff kept comin'.  They started us off with yummy edamame tossed with sesame seeds and that cool red hawaiian salt. We ordered appetizers that turned out to be way too much food. The Kalua Pork in Butter Lettuce cups was tasty tasty tasty--that is a five star appetizer. Ahi Tuna Tempura roll with sticky thai black rice was very creative. Mussels in coconut curry with toasted french bread for dipping. Fried calamari was good (I would have liked more tentacles tho').   Dessert was Banana Bread Pudding with Mitchell's Macapuno Ice cream and macadamia brittle. SO GOOD. \u00a0The bread pudding had nice crunchy topping to it, the ice cream was perfect cold creamy contrast, but you could still taste the macapuno (young preserved coconut strings, in case you don't know what that is). and the brittle was a delightful crunch on the side.  Got seated at the window, and it was a picture-perfect afternoon. Boats going by, sea lion frolicking in the water. Nice!  I am not normally a fan of nouveau-asian-looks-pretty-on-the-plate fare (I'm a hole-in-the-wall gal) but this was artfully presented AND it tasted good! hooray!

We were the only people in the restaurant mid week so we didnt have to wait long for a table, and we got some premium seating along one of the window couch set ups. Unfortunately the view went to waste since it was dark at night and the couches face inward due to the place turning into a lounge at night. hehe.   Anyhoo getting back to the food. We first started off with some delicious starters such as the Fire Fried Calamari, Duck Conift Spring Rolls and The Kalua Pig Butter Lettuce Cups!!! OMG the lettuce cups were so delicious!! The duck spring rolls were pretty tasty, our duck wasn't gamey like some others have posted. The Calamari was the big let down of the night, but the other 2 appetizers made up for it.   For our main entree we split the Grilled Hanger Steak! I had no idea that it was a sizzlin steak and like fajitas it came on a big sizzlin skillet! the only big draw back is that the smoke made me smell like meat all night! hahaha so if you are planning on going out afterwards you may want to come prepared. hahaha.

The wait staff was lazy, rude, and mostly ignored us. If the tip wasn't included in the bill - we would not have tipped at all. As it was, we did not leave over the included amount. It is because of the staff and the two hour long wait for our entrees that we will NEVER eat here again.   We order mostly burgers and the fish salad, and the place was empty by the time we received our food. For a four hundred dollar meal, we could of eaten somewhere better.

It's Asian Fusion. \u00a0Which some say is over done, but it makes so much sense here in SF with our influences and ingredients. \u00a0After a couple of cocktails. \u00a0We had the sashimi and poke starter and a calamari appetizer, which were fantastic. \u00a0He uses the belly (toro) portion of the tuna for the poke which melts in your mouth, and he uses the loin of the hamachi which was like butter. \u00a0So you pay a little more than your average raw fish, but it was goooood. \u00a0The Calamari comes with sort of a ponzu sauce and remoulade, and it was the most tender calamari I've had. \u00a0The chef came out and made fun of himself a little, saying that reviewers often say the mark of a bad restaurant is if there's calamari on the menu, so he said he put it on the menu just 'cuz. \u00a0It was good. \u00a0 Our main dish, which we shared, was a seared duck breast and a duck confit. \u00a0It has some really nice soy and citrus flavors. \u00a0Perfectly tender, with crispy skin outside. \u00a0Really amazing. \u00a0For dessert, banana bread pudding. \u00a0Really good and custardy, rich and sweet, but not overly so. \u00a0Really hit the spot. \u00a0The portions are not huge, and what we ordered didn't have a lot of carbs to fill you up, so we were satisfied without being stuffed. \u00a0Our check with 3 drinks, came out to under $80. \u00a0Which for the quality of the food and location was excellent. \u00a0It's a place you can afford to come to on a weeknight and not feel like you're indulging too much.  The service was fantastic. \u00a0I noted that it was our anniversary when I booked through Open Table, and they gave us a fantastic table with the best view. \u00a0They also threw in our dessert for free wishing us a happy night. \u00a0The Chef, Robert Lam, came out and chatted with us several times, which I really liked. \u00a0He's really down to earth. \u00a0Turns out he graduated from the school I teach at and he said he's willing to come back and maybe do some stuff with our students. \u00a0  The design is modern, and clean. \u00a0You can stroll in off of the pier in jeans and feel at home, or be a little dressed up and not be out of place. \u00a0It's lively without being raucous. \u00a0A really nice spot that locals and visitors should check out. \u00a0Parking is not fantastic. \u00a0Taking the F line would be your best bet. \u00a0But especially if you're already down there and hungry, I'd go to Butterfly before any other place within a mile of the Pier. \u00a0We'll be back to try many of the other dishes.",

    "review_text": "Went here for brunch with four friends today (Sunday). The menu was very short and they were out of the one vegetarian item they were offering (maui onion soup). I ordered a chicken salad club sandwich ($12), it was okay, but I had to scrape off the chicken salad because it had way too much mayonnaise. There were only two small slices of avocado :( Also, I could tell that the steak fries had been fried in the same oil with fish because there was a slightly fishy taste to the oil (my friends who love seafood did not notice this, but since I hate seafood it was annoying for me). The server was very competent but pretty snobby. He added a 18% gratuity to our checks even though this is only supposed to be done for parties of 6 or more. When one of my friends asked about it he became very rude, said that he did it because large parties usually stiff him, and ended up tearing up my friend's check and throwing it at her (after she pointed out that he had accidentally charged her $43 when her total was $15). However the management was patient and kind and resolved the issue with my friend. Other than that, the ambiance was nice, the setting was modern and very clean and tasteful and the view was pretty good. Every table was given edadame with sesame seeds on the house and it was probably the best part of the meal. The clam chowder ($14), which claimed to come in two bread bowls on the menu, came in two glass bowls with a small piece of baguette in one of the bowls. Other than the burgers the portions were pretty small and only of average taste other than a bloody mary ($9) which was excellent and spicy.",

    "review_text": "No good views, terrible service. Ignore any other reviews that say otherwise. Or perhaps customers were too intoxicated to know any better. The cocktails looked quite fresh and creative, which may have been the redeeming factor that skewed the other Yelp reviews. We came here for a birthday brunch on a Saturday morning, and we were hoping for a special experience.   Yes, the restaurant looks out into the Bay, but you can't see much except for some murky green water. The restaurant is surrounded on either side by piers, which blocks the view of any land or points of interest. You can barely see to the other side, so it's really just a narrow body of murky water extending out into the distance. We especially requested a window seat, but this wasn't really necessary. // TIP: Check out Cliff House or Caprice for amazing views.//  Yes, we ordered the usual suspects -- duck confit spring rolls, kalua pork lettuce wraps, kalua pig-in-a-hole, and garlic noodles with fried calamari. The duck confit spring rolls were probably the best -- nice and hot and crispy. The lettuce wraps were nothing much. The pork was quite watery for some reason, and the sauces were nothing to be wowed about. The pig-in-a-hole was essentially a heavy and buttered up sandwich. The garlic noodles were not very garlicky at all. The fried calamari in the noodles also wasn't crispy anymore :[ // TIP: Check out Perilla or PPQ for the *real* garlic noodles.//  There was no free desserts or special attention for the birthday customer -- even when we notified them ahead of time. I guess the economy has taken a hit...The waiter was also very curt with us and didn't give us much attention at all. He put the food down quite carelessly (even spilling some of the sauce) and didn't take the time to explain any of the dishes. They also didn't refill our water glasses until we asked, even though the restaurant wasn't very crowded at all. These were all fairly basic expectations for service.   The food is also really not worth the prices they charge here. Definitely wait for a LivingSocial or Groupon deal before you eat here. There are so many great restaurants in SF that unless you're craving Hawaiian fusion, you should save yourself the time and money here and try something else.",

    "review_text": "We had brunch here with friends from out of town yesterday. We started with a few appetizers, such as the calamari, spring rolls and buttercup lettuce and minced pork. The latter was simply mouth-watering and you cannot get to have enough of it. As for our entrees, they have a wide variety of Asian fusion meals. Because it was brunch, they had more sandwiches and salads on the menu - I had their vietnamese fried snapper and despite of it being fried, I actually liked the flavor and taste of the sandwich. It came in a baguette and personally, I find it hard to sometimes consume a sandwich that comes on a baguette. Other folks had their burgers and based on their remarks about how tasty and delicious their burgers were, I would definitely come back to try it. What was amazing was that somebody ordered their loco moco burger and it came out as this towering burger, with two huge beef patties and egg with all the fixins. The chef stopped by our table to see whether the person who ordered the loco moco burger finished his order. It was so huge that he had to take half of it home. I highly recommend this restaurant if you happen to \u00a0be in the Fisherman's Wharf area. Plus, it also helps that they were featured on Check Please, Bay Area.",

It's a great space with French style (side-by-side) seating at some of the waterfront tables \u00a0which make for a romantic date night. The service is great with friendly hostesses and bar tenders and some of their servers such as Porter (you can read his accolades in other yelp reviews) make for a great experience. But ultimately for me it's all about the food. The food and drink menu changes every few months which can be frustrating when you find a dish you really love, but it's nice that there is always something new and delicious to try. The Cowboy Steak is to die for and don't miss out on the Duck Confit Spring Rolls! My only request: bring back the \"Buddha's Hand\"--best cocktail ever! Lastly, Chef Rob Lam is a real sweetheart. He's seemingly there all the time and loves circulate around the restaurant to interact with his diners. It's a touch of class that keeps me coming back.",

All that money to wait outside. Then when we finally got in, it was packed from the people who were there for dinner. Since they didn't finish they had all the tables still set up. Its like no one thought it through. We asked where the hip-hop room was (advertisement said, main room HOUSE MUSIC, lounge HIP HOP MUSIC.) They told us we had to leave the building and go to the next building over. Wait in another line..... We were so upset. Once we got to the next building over the wait wasn't as long. The only bad thing was the DJ who kept loosing power every 6 minutes and did the countdown 5 minutes early.

I could almost taste the vinaigrette upon the leaves. \u00a0The gold and red beets were diced nicely and barely made my taste bud radar. \u00a0  It was well worth the wait for the server to bring out the wine we selected. \u00a0But while we waited, the mains came out.  The New York Strip with mushrooms came out medium-rare exactly to my liking. \u00a0I searched with my fork for the mushrooms, and found one slice, yes A slice. \u00a0The mashed potato was diluted...almost watery. \u00a0The toasted macadamia nut and blue cheese topping were a nice surprise. \u00a0It was very creative. \u00a0  The bottle of Shafer 06 Merlot was the highlight of the meal. \u00a0It was very bold for a merlot and pleasingly smooth, berries forward and medium finish, not too short of a finish as merlots, to me, tend to be. \u00a0The wine had a deep aubergine color. \u00a0The nose was that of a new car, with leather seating. \u00a0You know, that deep breath of soft supple leather, ahhhh! \u00a0  The \u00a01/2 bottle of Duckhorn 06 Merlot had its own notes. \u00a0At first sniff, it wasn't not very delightful, but the first sip, smooth, berries-forward and a hint of oak. \u00a0It had a nice medium ruby red color.   Butterfly is touristy. \u00a0Is it Asian or Californian cuisine? Fusion perhaps? \u00a0The dishes didn't appear to commit one way or the other. \u00a0The caterpillar should've stayed in the cocoon until it finds it's identity. \u00a0Not a butterfly now, but maybe a moth? \u00a0I would return if the favors popped and it finds its indentity. \u00a0I want to taste the sweet, sour, salt and savory. \u00a0 Make my taste buds float like a butterfly.",

We got the duck spring rolls, the calamari, the steak entree and the creme brulee desert. Service was a little slow (-1 star), but that wasn't a major issue for us since we were having a nice ladies night and gorging ourselves with 3 courses so the time to digest was appreciated. Everything was delicious, if I do come again I'll probably order apps and drinks, though the steak was really good, \u00a0it was pretty rich and we probably could have split it.",

We were actually considering this location as a wedding reception, and with the floor to ceiling windows facing the bay, it definitely would've been a great option if we had a smaller party. It can only accommodate 125 people.  Nevertheless we decided to try a few items on the menu. For $18 on the DAT menu, you get a 2-course lunch. We chose the Kalua Pork Butter Lettuce Wraps as the appetizer and the Tumeric Grilled Snapper as the main. Both were quite delicious.  The Kalua Pork was very very tender as you would expected from slow roasted pork. They cooked theirs in a wood oven rather than a traditional Hawaiian pit. But they do wrap the meat in banana leaves to impart the flavor. Served with cute fluffy butter lettuce leaves, you form your own wrap - lettuce, vermicelli noodles, some sweet sauce and then the pork. Watch out for the juicy dribble that inevitably trickles down the open end of the wrap. The portion is big enough to share with 2 people.  The Snapper was also quite good. Served on a sizzling skillet, the fish had a nice grilled taste. Similar to the Kalua Pork, you also wrap the fish in lettuce, noodles, and sauce. Very fresh and light tasting.  I also ordered the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict ($14). The eggs were perfectly poached (yolk still running but gently firm whites), and the crab cake was full of chunks of crab. Not overly fried, breaded for crisp texture. The hollandaise sauce while creamy wasn't overly thick. The total dish is quite rich, but really well executed. The accompanying fruit salad was a nice sweet break from the savory as well.  Overall, beautiful atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, good food. Butterfly is solid in my book.",

We've been here before but only for after party.  It seems that nite eventhough it was raining, Bacholerrette and bday party full of girls were the theme. Oh I didn't expect to bumped into my Chief of Medicine at Butterfly that night.   Ryan (I think he's part owner of Butterfly) was very gracious and gave us a great table. While were waiting for the table, he bought us \u00a0rounds of mojito, w/c by the way - taste delicious. It was 45 mins later than our reservation &amp; he felt bad coz the other party decided to chill while we were waiting for them to pay.  Our bartender named Jeff were great. He made our drinks all night.  Our food took while, so Ryan once again decided to buy us rounds of drinks, 5 girls decided to have cranvodka, 1 Whiskey &amp; coke and the rest of the girls opted for free desserts.  Our food once it arrive was delicious except for the sauce on the egg roll (it's too mustardy). The chef decided to go over our table and asked how was the food, we answered great except for the egg roll. He then gave us free spring roll, w/c is yummy (I'm going by my friends answer who happens to be Vietnamese). ^_^ Our server memorize 11 girls orders and she too was good.  We had such a great time, we were treated like VIP. Were coming back.",

Half of my party went with the DAT and the other half decided to order stuff straight from the regular menu. \u00a0DAT was a good deal if you get the right items. Don't go for the vegetarian bento box for DAT, you're better off just ordering it off the regular menu.  DAT: Calamari- good. the sauce had a good kick Kalua pig- nicely seasoned and tender...kalua pig should be even more flavorful and tender though.  Hanger Steak- the hubby didn't find it anything special Grilled Snapper- fish was yummy but the build your own set up with the lettuce wrap and noodles and fish sauce became annoying after a while.  Banana Lumpia- tasted good but I've had better. Plus the ice cream underneath was melted within seconds from having the hot lumpia on top. The bowl set up doesn't work well. Creme Brulee- solid  Regular menu: Baby back ribs- my friend was quite disappointed. Flavor was good but the meat didn't fall off the bone. Also, he said the meat tasted gamey. That's just weird for pork. Crispy Fried Fish- my friends loved it. said it was one of the best fish dishes they've had.  The food was a hit or a miss. The service however was a MISS. \u00a0Our server was a nice guy but slow. And the restuarant was only 1/3 full so we expected the service to great. \u00a0The planning of when food came out was all off. After our appetizers, we just waited for the entrees. Luckily we were having a great conversation to mind it as much but still...the timing could have been A LOT better.",

    "review_text": "Sweeping bay views, upscale d\u00e9cor, uniquely outstanding Asian Fusion cuisine, and Master Chef Robert Lam are just a few thoughts that jump into my mind when I think about my dining experience at Butterfly.   After tearing my eyes away from the breathtaking views of the sunlight dancing on the water through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I started my meal with the Sesame Edamame, Bloody Mary Oyster Shooter, Fried Calimari, and the Kalua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups. I must admit that all of these appetizers were quite delectable, but my hands-down favorite was the Kalua Pig. This dish was presented with a small mound of succulent shredded pork, pepper brunoise, toasted cashews, minced green onions, and tantalizing hoisen barbeque sauce, and crisp butter lettuce leaves, all waiting to be assembled into a perfect small bite. Now I love shredded pork, but when combined with all of these unique flavors and textures, I was tempted to make this my main course...it was that good!  Luckily, I did save room after the appetizers for my main course. The Macadamia and Blue Cheese Crusted Filet Mignon seemed to be calling me as I perused the various choices on the eclectic menu. Let me just say that the filet mignon was absolutely superb. Each tender bite released the rich, deep, flavor of the meat in the port wine demi-glace. The filet mignon was nestled in a bed of whipped potatoes that was bathed in a mushroom jus de veau. Asparagus and carrots completed this amazing dish, by adding freshness, color, and texture. I ate every last bite and enjoyed every minute doing so.  So what would you pair with these two stellar dishes, the Kalua Pig appetizer and the Macademia and Blue Cheese Crusted Filet Mignon? Well, to answer this question I went directly to Chef Robert Lam, who was named 1 of 6 \"Rising Star Chefs\" by the San Francisco Chronicle. He recommended a Chimay Blue Belgian Ale or a Honey Bourbon Sour with the Kalua Pig. For the filet, he suggested a glass of Reverie Cabernet Franc or Falcor Sangiovese, as well as the Cherry Blossom cocktail.  Don't miss out on a chance to dine at Butterfly. Not only will you fall in love with the view and ambience, but you will also get to experience the culinary vision and expertise of Master Chef and owner Robert Lam.

For lunch I ordered the American Kobe beef hamburger with bacon jam and imported cheese (can't recall type) with steak fries. I don't think, I could be wrong, the beef is imported from Japan but it was delicious nonetheless. My wife had the garlic noodles which she has had on several occasions. They must be good.

    "review_text": "First off, gorgeous setting, pretty interior, nice ambience.  Yeah, yeah, \"Asian Fusion\" is never a good sign, my fiance reminds me. I remind him of the strip mall back home with the wonderful Asian Fusion menu. He reminds me that it's not Asian Fusion, but a place that has several different kinds of Asian cuisine on the same menu.  Anyway, Butterfly doesn't just have Asian fusion, it's got whatever fusion on the menu. I started with a \"spicy Caiparinha\" drink, which is a well known (almost mojito-like) Brazilian cocktail. The spicy was obtained by infusing the alcohol with fresh jalapeno! Well, then, it was \"interesting.\" Not sure I'll seek it out again.  But here's my complaint: there's a \"Vietnamese sandwich\" on the menu with fried snapper on the menu. You read the description and if you're like me, say to yourself \"Fish Banh Mi, awesome, I'll take it!\".   It's not a fish banh mi or any other kind.  Mind you, if you like fried fish sandwiches, you might like this. It's got a bit of shredded pickled carrot and daikon. A bit. The baguette is not fresh. There's plenty of fresh jalapeno and a bit of cucumber. But there's none of the other goodness that goes into a proper banh mi. So you have a fried fish sandwich with some salt and spice and no sweetness that you can taste. So I'm not sure anyone who's tasted a real Vietnamese sandwich has created this thing or tasted his/her creation in a while. Which annoys me.  Fiance had some sort of 12,000 calorie cobb salad fusion thingie which tasted OK to me, but I didn't taste the blue cheese which he said didn't go with the rest of the flavors at all. He liked his Anchor Steam, however.",

I think the food is delicious and reasonably priced. It's definitely asian fusion with most of its dishes taken from Vietnamese cuisine. The portion size varies from dish to dish. For the most part, I think the sizes are perfect.  Here are the dishes that I've tried on my visits.  EDAMAME - This is complimentary and its deliciously different. It tastes like its soaked in sesame seed oil and the finest salt. MMmm.  FIRE FRIED CALAMARI ($9) - Generous portion of calamari with a twist. It is seasoned with garlic and accented by marinated cucumbers and bell peppers. LOVE THIS!!  KALUA PIG WITH BUTTER LETTUCE CUPS ($11) - My friends ordered this and I would describe it as \"hiding the delicious fatty goodness\". My friends really loved it.  FRIED RED SNAPPER SANDWICH WITH FRIES ($10) - The sandwich was delicious. I really liked the spicy chili and garlic rouille that flavored it. The fries were thin and seasoned with pepper and some other spice? Anyways, DELICIOUS!  SHAKING BEEF COBB SALAD ($12) - OH MY GOD! I don't normally eat beef. Someone told me this was absolutely delicious, so I tried it. Yum, yum, yum...  SASHIMI TRIO SALAD ($15) - My friend had this and really enjoyed it, however, he said the portion was small and was hungry after.   COCONUT CURRY CHICKEN AND SATAY ($12) - My friend had this and she thought it was good. However, she said the portion was small and had better for less.  TURMERIC GRILLED SNAPPER WITH SIZZLING ONIONS AND HERBS ($15) - Four of my friends tried this and all of them were equally satisfied. They really enjoyed the turmeric seasoned fish.   AMBIANCE - The other great thing about this place is that it faces the waterfront. The side facing the waterfront has floor to ceiling window all the way across. The view is beautiful and peaceful.  SERVICE - The staff was friendly and attentive. My drinks were replenished without asking and they already made sure we had everything we needed.",

    "review_text": "Every lengthy business trip should end the way mine did yesterday: with a luxurious, relaxed meal in a classy restaurant. Exhausted from a week-long drive up the California coast, my two co-workers and I drove into San Francisco for lunch before our late-afternoon flight home. We caught a glimpse of Butterfly as we drove down the Embarcadero and decided to hop across the street and give it a try. The interior of the restaurant alone took my breath away, though I don't have much to compare it to. (It's the only SF restaurant I've been to since I was about 8.) The frames of every streetside window are painted bright red, and despite the high ceilings and crisp white tablecloths, something about how the room is situated saves it from feeling remote and overly spacious.   We were seated at a table right by the waterside windows, per our request (what tourists). To start, our server brought us chilled edamame dressed with olive oil, black sesame and pink sea salt, a fantastic alternative to the cliched bread and olive oil you come to expect from restaurants today. We quickly decided on our meals, one shrimp with green papayas and two chicken skewers with curry, and waited patiently for the food to arrive. We certainly weren't disappointed. I can speak only for my curry, but it was lovely. The dish was a little different than I imagined, served in a white coffee cup with a perfectly spicy yellow curry \"soup\" with lemongrass, onions, tomatoes and potatoes. Topped off with a warm, crusty roll and some chilled butter, it was the best way I can think of to fill my stomach before the long flight home.  The view across the water showed the backside of some of the piers, and compared to the guys eating their bag lunches with their legs hanging off toward the water, I'd say we did all right for ourselves.",

The duck spring rolls were delicious! \u00a0 I loved the smoke salmon benedict -- the smoke salmon had a great texture (tender and no hint of slime). The accompanying french fries were addictive.  The Pig in the Hole was also good, though lost out in the competition for stomach space to the above.",

    "review_text": "This review is for the takeout only. \u00a0I have no idea what goes on in the rest of the restaurant, but they have a small takeout counter that is situated so as to get the crowds coming and going from Pier 33 where the Alcatraz tours leave. \u00a0I went in there for a quick takeout breakfast as I saw they had a poached egg sandwich on the menu and that sounded better than the crap being served out at the snack wagons by the Alcatraz cruise boarding area. \u00a0 Judging by the opening times, the takeout area had been open for a while and there were four people ahead of me in line trying to order breakfast. \u00a0There were restaurant workers walking around getting about 500 containers of sandwich making stuff out of fridges and setting up. Problem: \u00a0Lunchtime was several hours away, and no one was making breakfast food for the people who needed to eat, presumably probably before their Alcatraz tour boat left as there is no other reason to be down on that pier that early in the morning. \u00a0The workers just kept setting up for lunch and ignored the people waiting in line. \u00a0Several people came and stood in line for a while, then left when they saw that getting a bagel was going to be a major operation. \u00a0The people in line ahead of me just wanted bagels with cream cheese and they had to wait about 20 minutes to get those - it was ridiculous. \u00a0  Finally one guy showed up and started waiting on people. \u00a0He was trying to do a good job, but it's hard for one person to switch between trying to cook people's food and work the cash register, which also didn't seem to be working right or he didn't know how to work it because it was taking him about 5 minutes to enter each order. \u00a0Then he'd have to go wash his hands (he may have skipped this step a couple times) and back to work making what was ordered. \u00a0The people ahead of me who ordered bagels basically got two bagels that had been put through the toaster and a packet of \u00a0cream cheese each. \u00a0The guy didn't even spread the cream cheese on himself! \u00a0 It was ridiculous! \u00a0I thought about leaving but I really wanted the egg sandwich. \u00a0 Somebody had to go off in some other part of the restaurant to make it and I literally drank my entire breakfast hot chocolate while waiting for the sandwich. \u00a0When I finally did get it I found out they'd put pepper and mayonnaise on it without even asking me if I wanted that stuff on my egg, which frankly I didn't, but I ate it anyway because it had been a half hour by that point. \u00a0  Seriously, just don't go to the take out. \u00a0I don't care if the lunch service is faster than an Indy 500 and serves the world's greatest sandwiches. \u00a0Having three guys wander around setting up counters while one guy is trying to handle money and serve people rather badly all at the same time is a stupid assed way to run a business and I'd rather not give them any more of my money.",

    "review_text": "Dear Yelp,  Oh dine about town, or DAT as I like to call it, as in DAT time of year when my friends are willing to fork out some cash for a semi expensive meal. \u00a0Of course, as we all know, DAT merely creates the illusion of a good deal. \u00a0The portions on the DAT menu always seem smaller than usual, and I sure as heck don't need a dessert, so I always choose to order something off the regular menu.  Anyway, where to begin with Butterfly? \u00a0I guess I'll start with the service, since I didn't even get to eat any food. \u00a0I ordered the Ahi Tuna, because our server personally recommended it. \u00a0As with any Ahi Tuna dish, you gots to order that shit as rare as possible, which I did. \u00a0I was feeling pretty jovial that night, so I ordered the table a nice (ie: expensive) bottle of wine. \u00a0I mean, what are friends for right?  So our server friend opens the wine and begins to pour. \u00a0Strangely enough, he poured some of this nice wine into my friend's glass, which already had some other wine in it. \u00a0Strike 1.  I let the wine incident slide; chalk it up to inexperience. \u00a0Plus, it turns out that the mixture didn't taste so bad. \u00a0Then my Ahi Tuna comes out, except it isn't rare. \u00a0In fact, it isn't even red, it's white. \u00a0I call our server buddy over and tell him that he must have grabbed the wrong fish. \u00a0He informs me that they were out of the Ahi Tuna, but what I got was good also. \u00a0So just to clarify, this guy recommends that I order the Ahi Tuna, asks me how I want it cooked, and then waits until the food is ready to tell me that they're out of it. \u00a0Got it? \u00a0Strike 2.  Our server chum gives me two options at this point: either keep the dish he gave me (on the house) or order something new, which I would have to pay for. \u00a0Let me get this straight, I either get the shit I didn't order for free, or pay for an entirely new entree? \u00a0Yeah, okay. \u00a0Seeing as my friends had pretty much finished their meals, I told him to take the food away and forget about it. \u00a0It was at this point that he started calling me \"bro.\" \u00a0Strike 3.  Here's a tip for all you servers out there: when you continually fuck up a customer's dinner, under no circumstance should you call him \"bro,\" no matter how young he might appear. \u00a0Especially if this customer just bought a $100 bottle of wine.  I give Butterfly a fantastic score of 0 out of 5 stars (Yelp really needs to let its users give out 0 stars).  Love, James",

The service was good and the atmosphere was pretty chill; they have a live DJ spinning in a corner, with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the bay and the space itself is pretty cool too...definitely has that warehouse-conversion feel to it.  The food was well presented and tasted delicious and the drinks were great--particularly the Cherry Blossom, one of the house specialty drinks. I highly recommend it..I had 3. We ordered a bunch of appetizers such as the Duck Confrit Spring Rolls, the Kalhua Pig Lettuce wraps and half doz Oyster Shooters, my personal favorite being the half dozen Oyster Shooters. One of my friends also had the Maui Onion Soup, which he said was great. The entrees arrived at the perfect time and looked as good as they sounded on the menu. I ordered the grilled salmon, which was very good, although a tad bit small in portion. My friend ordered the Ahi Tuna, which was very good--I think I'm gonna order that next time I go. As for everybody else, they ordered both versions of steak, one being a fillet I think, and they both said both their dishes were phenomenal. As for the service, the service was friendly and our waitress kept coming back and asking if we wanted more drinks--which kept on flowing. Overall, a very good experience. Definitely wanna come back...this place would be perfect for a casual date or dinner and drinks with friends",

Love the ambiance and decor here, it's one of the better restaurants along the waterfront, and one of the few where the food actually measures up to the view.   After a lycheetini (yummy) and a nice salmon carpaccio chip appetizer with wonton crackers, I had what I still consider one of the better appetizers I've had in an Asian fusion restaurant or anywhere for that matter - shiso-cured albacore sashimi, soy-poached foie gras, yuzu kosho, pomelo grapefruit and avocado. I could have sat there all night eating that and been a happy little pig. The albacore was beautifully fresh, the foie gras added just the hint of richness it needed and there was that unmistakable scent and flavor of shiso. I wanted so much to come back and have this but with the foie ban that dream's been dashed. Oh well.  We also had poached pear salad with endive (very good). The service was excellent.",

All in all, I was here for a legal function happy hour a couple years ago, and enjoyed the atmosphere and crowd. \u00a0But after coming here for brunch in the daylight, this restaurant may need additional training for the front end of their house.",

I have had the Baby Fields Green Salad twice now. \u00a0It has Manchego Cheese, \"Nuoc Cham\" Vinaigrette, Oranges, and carmelized Cashew Nuts. \u00a0It is really light, refreshing, and the dressing is great. \u00a0I never knew that Nuoc Cham could be so tasty on lettuce! I normally don't like cashews, but I found myself eating every single one on the plate. \u00a0  My friends say that the Duck Confit Spring Rolls are divine, but I can't handle spicy food, so I have never tried it. \u00a0Apparently they are SUPER spicy (in a good way). \u00a0  The Wok Seared Shanghai Garlic noodles with minced scallions and toasted garlic is awesome. \u00a0It's like ultimate hangover/drunk food, but it is great sober too. \u00a0Granted, the dish is a little pricy I guess because it's $10 just for the noodles and then if you want to add stuff, it's even more. \u00a0Chicken is $5, shrimp is $7, kalua pig is $5, calamari is $5, and shaking beef is $6. \u00a0  A new menu item is the Carmelized Shrimp and Green Papaya salad with Mango, Micro Cilantro, Carrot and Siracho Coulis, Toasted Shallots. \u00a0Huge strips of papaya with fresh juicy mango and perfectly prepared shrimp. \u00a0It's a filling salad too. \u00a0Definitely doable as an entree if you're not super hungry. \u00a0$11 is reasonable for the size of this salad. \u00a0   Another new menu item is the Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll with Thai Black Sticky Rice, Wasabi Coulis, Ginger Cr\u00e8me Fraiche. \u00a0There's a lot going in in this roll and when I tried it, it was like the first week that they were debuting it. \u00a0I think that they are still changing it around a little, but HUGE rolls and really filling. \u00a0  My friend had the House Smoked Salmon and Strawberry Salad Rolls with Spicy Garlic and Ginger Dipping Sauce. \u00a0I'm not a huge smoked salmon fan, so I didn't try this one, but the rolls were HUGE. \u00a0My friend was really into them though and devoured them exclaiming \"omg sooo good!\"  As for entrees, I have tried the Mushroom DIp Sandwich with Toasted Sweet French Baguette, Macadamia Pesto, Mozzarella Cheese, and Soy Au Jus (a bit too much dipping sauce for me). \u00a0I have also tried the Turmeric Grilled Snapper with Sizzling Onions and Herbs. \u00a0This dish comes with Cold Rice Noodles, Vietnamese Herbs Salad, and \"Nuoc Cham\" Dipping Sauce. \u00a0You get big buttercup lettuce leaves and wrap the snapper in the lettuce with the noodles and dipping sauce. \u00a0It was delicious but really messy! \u00a0The lettuce kept splitting in half with the weight of the snapper, so it would be great if this dish had the thin rice paper that you dip in water to make rolls....more structure to the rolls to make it less messy maybe. \u00a0However, it was tasty so I didn't mind too much about it being a messy dish.   If you like seafood and Asian cuisine, definitely try the Lemongrass Seafood Minestrone with Thai Basil and Cashew Nut Pesto, Israeli Toasted Couscous, Parmesan. \u00a0This didn't sound appealing, but it's GOOD! \u00a0Tons of seafood, great flavor, and a new twist on minestrone. \u00a0  Dessert was a memorable part of the meal. \u00a0So much that I would recommend even coming here just for dessert. \u00a0As a banana lover, I absolutely loved the Banana Bread Pudding with Mitchell's Macapuno Ice Cream and Banana Brulee. \u00a0Omg...seriously banana heaven. \u00a0Perfectly baked in the oven with the right amount of bread pudding....and can't go wrong with some ice cream from Mitchell's on the side! \u00a0Perfectly ripe bananas too. \u00a0I also love the Iron Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie with Mitchell's mint chocolate chip ice cream. \u00a0The cookie is HUGE! \u00a0Please see my picture for a size reference....seriously bigger than my hand. \u00a0  Overall, great experiences at Butterfly and I will be returning.",

These were great, nicely crispy and not greasy. Great mustard sauce with it too. = Kalua pork lettuce cups - also very good. Huge portion, and nicely accompanied by the butter lettuce wraps.  For entrees, we got:  = The Shanghai garlic noodles animal style (with shrimp, pork and beef). This dish was in a huge bowl, and could easily have fed both of us. This dish was very good, nice amount of meat, and the beef was nicely cooked - not overcooked. Shrimp was nicely done, not overdone, and tasty. Pork was good as well. Slightly oily, as others had mentioned, but not bad.  = Turmeric catfish, served with rice vermicelli and butter lettuce to wrap. I was disappointed in this dish. The fish was nicely done, but I really didn't taste any turmeric at all.  Dessert - we split a creme brulee. As others had mentioned, the sugar crust was sort of thick and hard, but it was ok with me. The custard was soft, and not too firm. It was an ok brulee, not the absolute best I've had, but nothing close to the worst.  The price was ok, but glad we had the Living Social deal.  Pretty inside, with cool decor. We sat under a light fixture/sculpture that looked like a huge sea urchin.  And regarding what others said about not being able to see outside, despite being on the water - come on, if there aren't any lights outside, how could you see anyway?

    "review_text": "I had heard of this chef inspired by his mom to experiment with Asian Fusion. \u00a0I'd say he's done a fairly good job taking typical Asian dishes, and melding them with an atypical preparation method. \u00a0Now, by no means am I a food connoisseur, but I do know what traditional Asian food tastes like. \u00a0We ordered the shiu mai appetizer, which was quite tasty, though nothing extraordinary. \u00a0The main-entrees of duck and spare-ribs were delectable. \u00a0I would describe them as \"fall-off-the-bone\" good. \u00a0Afterward, we made the mistake of ordering separate desserts (peach cobbler and banana cake), which both tasted amazing, but were too filling. \u00a0I had absolutely no complaints with the food, as the entire meal was delicious. \u00a0  The interior decor had very avant garde features, sporting sea-urchin resembling light fixtures, with a combination of dim-red / baby blue lighting on a predominantly black background. \u00a0The noise ambiance at Butterfly is very conducive for conversation, and the wait-staff are very friendly. \u00a0  What kept me from giving this place the 5-star rating was that though the food tasted wonderful, it didn't seem to strike me as anything extraordinary. \u00a0Though the melange of atypical preparation method with typical Asian dishes were refreshing, it didn't strike me as \"WOW-worthy.\" \u00a0  Nevertheless, I would highly recommend a dining experience at Butterfly because the food really is delicious, the ambiance is nice, and its location at Pier 33 makes it a nice option for both lunch and dinner.",

    "review_text": "We saw this place featured on a television \u00a0program. On a day trip to San Francisco we decided to give it a try. Upon entering the restaurant, the hostess was deeply engaged in her cellphone and the bartender just glanced at us and walked away. No greeting, no smile, nothing. We stood there while the other diners looked at us with scrunched faces. When the hostess finally out her phone down and asked us if we'd like to join her for a table, we were seated at an awkwardly situated table against a column. The decor is a little dated and mismatched. Our server came for our drink order and we ordered our apps at the same time.  We started with the Salt and Pepper Calimari and the Duck Confit Spring Rolls. Much to my disappointment the calimari was over fried and bland. No savory flavor at all. The dipping sauce was an odd soy sauced aioli, and the micro greens on top were completely useless. The duck confit spring rolls were another disappointment. They were also over fried, loosely wrapped, and soggy in the middle. The filling was mostly softened onions and red bell peppers, with a layer of extremely salty shredded duck. There was a mysterious paper like strip of what I though was onion. It turned out to be a piece of plastic! I flagged down the nearest server and brought it to her attention. She apologized immediately and whisked the plate away to have another order made. Then someone who I think was the manager stopped by our table to follow up on the situation and offer another apology along with an explanation. According to the manager there are lots of menu items that are made in advance and wrapped in plastic to retain freshness. I can understand prepping certain items in advance, but the explanation doesn't resolve how the plastic ended up inside of the spring roll. Anyhow a new plate of spring rolls landed on our table and they were in worse condition than the first order minus the plastic. Loosely wrapped, soggy, full of onions, and a thick wad of salty duck meat. There was also a dipping sauce that didn't really have much personality to add.  Our server was great. I appreciated the way they handled the plastic incident quickly and without any issues. I doubt we will return to Butterfly on any of our next visits to San Francisco. I had high hopes after reading so many great reviews, but I guess to each his own.",

You walk into these high fushion glass doors to be automatically created and seated to your reservation! First plus! As your taking your small tour through ( it isn't too big, but the art work of mirror-jeweled hanging and palm tree metals of lights hanging from the ceiling above your taken back and at amazement of the beauty. I met for a birthday lunch for myself with my boss/ friend who is so awesome to have brought me there. Our seat was in the back so it was over-looking the bay! (fyi, news said it was suppose to rain, we had the bluest skies i have ever seen frisco have and heat!) Yeah for me! So needless to say i was in heaven. Even with a party seating next to me and my colleque it was still and relaxing atmosphere since you practically were lounging on a couch with pillows while you dined. I was able to have a very pleasant chit chat while i sipped yummy iced tea and devoured my humungus chicken salad club sandwich with fries that i never thought i would finish. Needless to say i had to get a box to go, but well worth later on to finish! My boss went with a salad which seemed to vanish into her belly as well. The menu was short and simple, the decor glamourus and my meal was absolutely wonderful! Def would like to come again and try other appetizers and drinks!",

There're already tons of reviews here, so I wont have to get into the details. I ordered two appetizers instead of one entrees. I had the kalua pork lettuce cups and the mussels and clams appetizers. I loved the lettuce cups, but the sauce they gave us was a bbq mixed with hoisin sauce. I'd much rather dial down the bbq flavor myself, but it was still very good. The mussels and clams were a bit fishy, and one of the mussels was barely open---I wouldn't havev served that one mussel if I were the chef.  But overall, very pleasant experience. We saw a sea lion swimming by.. the cutest thing it was! Oh, and we asked them to doggie bag our leftovers to take with us, but they forgot to give them to us. :( That was a bummer cuz by the time we remembered we were already a block away in our car.   So 4 stars instead of 5 because for the prices they charge, I would expect it much closer to perfection, and the lil dink in the service and the not so good mussel made me feel like it deserves only 4.

The first time I came here for dinner it was absolutely packed and we had to wait about 45 minutes for our table even though we had a reservation. My date and I didn't really mind, however, we just sat at the bar and enjoyed some of their awesome cocktails. Once we were seated the excellent service more than made up for the wait and we were even given some free appetizers. The next time (about two years later) I came with a group of people and it seemed like maybe some of the hype had died down, since we were seated immediately even though we were running late and the place was not nearly as crowded. The food was good, but not as outstanding as I remembered and the service was a bit off. I also got some weird ginger flavored cocktail that I would definitely not recommend. Although I was a little bummed that things weren't as good the second time around, I would still come back and give it another chance. I really love the location and decor of this place and the fact that it has such a great view.",

As soon as we got our drinks I finished my glass and then noticed that unlike my glass of fountain soda, they had given her a bottle of coke. Since we were thirsty we asked if she could get a coke from the fountain rather than bottle. Turns out that they do not do free refills from the fountain and they didn't mention it! Worst part is that glass of diet coke cost me $4!!! This place is overpriced to say the least.

For dinner, we ordered the blue cheese encrusted filet, the pork and the duck. My friend asked for medium rare for her steak and it definitely was a little over cooked yet still red. I think it was the quality of the beef that made it seem that way. She had to send it back and asked for it to be more rarer. My duck was amazing. 5 stars and the pork was also excellent. For dessert we had the chocolate chip cookie, the banana lumpia and the creme brule, compliments from the chef. They were all amazing. My favorite was the lumpia. Yum.

One of the bartenders was obv drunk, and the other seemed like he had his stuff together, but nonetheless they were both great bartenders that knew their menu/drinks.  We all started with specialty cocktails by the bartenders' reference (I think it was the cherry blossom... sooo Aaaaasian). It was okay. The girl liked it. I thought it was too sweet tasting, but then again I don't have a vag.  My friends didn't know what to order, so the bartender suggested the Kalua pig with butter lettuce cups and crab stuff fried chicken breast. I didn't have any of it because eating is cheating. My friends thought the two dishes were really good. Bravo to the bartender with the good call.  Her boyfriend and I moved onto Scotch soon after. He chose a few different Scotch's and they were all on point. One of the bartenders also selected a few Scotch's for us to try and those were all on point as well. We then moved onto shots and who knows what happened after.  Long story short: We got really drunk and blacked out. I woke up with the worst hangover. I told myself I wasn't going to drink again, but then I realized my parents didn't raise a quitter and went right back to the bottle for Halloween weekend.",

We had the calamari which I enjoyed, but my husband found to be lacking something. Then we had to try the Kahlua Pig, wow, moist and very tasty. The only downside to that dish was there wasn't more! Ruby Rose(gin, honey &amp; grapefruit juice) is a must try cocktail, delish. I look forward to going back for dinner and checking out a rib eye the featured on Check Please. The chef/owner stopped by and introduced himself, very nice guy!",

First I would like to that the food was great but what I didn't expect was how our waiter named Potter was exceptional without a doubt. Potter didn't just serve my wife and I but was very personal and attentive. It was my wife's birthday and we were looking forward to a special night out. One dish was not really to our liking and he sensed that. He immediately took charge and was willing to replace it with another dish to make sure we were satisfied with our meal being very insistent. On top of that we were surprised with dessert!!! the creme bruele and warm chocolate lava cake capped off the night for us. Thanks to Potter we had one of the best dining experiences we've had in a long time. Butterfly is lucky to have someone that cares about where he works, how little things make a difference and stands by the old tradition of a happy customer is a repeat customer. We will be back and will pass along our experience to all our fellow foodies.",

    "review_text": "Butterfly, located just off the F muni line and pier 33, is a great option for a leisurely Dine About Town lunch. \u00a0(And I stress leisurely since our lunch was about 2 hours long--not very practical for working stiffs, but perhaps if you tell the server your schedule ahead of time, they will be accommodating). \u00a0The regularly priced menu can be a bit of a splurge, but $21.95 for 3 courses is perfectly affordable and the right price for the food here. \u00a0I selected the fire roasted calamari, grilled snapper, and chocolate torte for my appetizer, entre, and dessert. \u00a0The calamari was good, but pretty standard fare for fried calamari so nothing really special. \u00a0The portion was very large for one person. \u00a0In fact all the DAT appetizer selections appeared to be the regular size appetizers, sharable with the entire table so be sure to order different things so you can try more. \u00a0The grilled snapper turned out to be a nice surprise. \u00a0From reading the menu, I assumed that I would get fish on a plate with noodles and some greens. \u00a0Instead, the snapper came out in a sizzling pan with rice noodles, butter leaf lettuce, basil, cilantro, and fish sauce on another plate. \u00a0The chef leaves the decision on how to consume the dish up to you. You can eat the dish as build your own lettuce wraps or as Vietnamese-inspired bun thrown together in the little extra bowl they provide. \u00a0My dessert was a delicious bowl of chocolate goo. The restaurant itself is very open with a view of the bay. Personally the view of the murky water and gulls was not inspiring to me, so if are expecting a great view, be prepared for the opposite. \u00a0Also, beware of the super strong incense burning in the bathroom. \u00a0It's pretty potent.  In short, good food for the DAT price but I probably won't go back for the regular priced menu.",

Once he finally acknowledged out presence he gave us the happy hour menu and painfully answered our questions. We each had a speciality happy hour cocktail and then wine and beer. I was really in the mood for oysters so we each ordered an oyster shooter. This oyster shooter should have been on the deadliest catch. My friend actually cried. It was way too spicy.

For dinner, I had the grilled snapper which came with rice noodles, lettuce, basil, and fish sauce. \u00a0It was pretty much the Vietnamese cold vermicelli bowls. \u00a0The way it came out, I didn't know how to eat it as everything came on a separate dish, but luckily, our friendly server explained to me. \u00a0I ended up just putting everything in a bowl and pouring the sauce on top. \u00a0It was okay. \u00a0Nothing too fabulous. \u00a0My husband's hangar steak with crispy noodles was lacking some flavor. \u00a0For dessert, I had the creme brulee, which was by far the best part! \u00a0I'm giving this place 3 star for the excellent server we had and the fantastic creme brulee as those were the only highlights for me, unfortunately.",

Finally they called for all girls in costumes to stand in a different line and we got in free, as advertised. Duh!  The club was alright, it's smaller than I expected and I think they let in too many people because it turned into this crazy mass of people and you couldn't even move.

From the happy hour menu, we ordered the Duck Spring Rolls ($5) and Kahlua Pig with Butter Lettuce cups ($8). Both came with their own sauce and were delicious. You roll your own lettuce \"burrito\", so it is a little messy. From the regular appetizer menu, we \u00a0ordered the Wok Seared Shanghai Garlic Noodles with Shrimp ($19!!! for an appetizer). These were fat noodles with lots of cut up vegetables and quite a few shrimp. We shared everything and that was fun. We had room for dessert and tried the banana lumpia rolls ($8). Perfect amount to share with two (or even 3) people. It was wonderfully sweet with a lot of bananas inside and out. There was shredded coconut inside the roll and it was served with coconut ice cream.  I really like that there are non-alcoholic choices on the drink menu. I tried the kiwi cucumber crush. It was sparkling and refreshing. Not too sweet. The kiwi was cut small and floating amoung the ice. It was a fun drink.  This is good food and a nice location.

Since then, I had scored another deal and went back a second time, and both times I had an overall great dining experience!   The Asian-fusion menu is seasonal and boasts many tantalizing finds with appetizers and cocktails around $10 and main entrees ranging from $20-$48. The first time I was here I had the Cara Cara Orange Salad and it was easily one of the most beautiful salads I've ever eaten. It had a unique \u00a0and tasty combination of ingredients with char siu pork, oranges, yuzu, and ricotta. It was a super small portion though so don't expect to get your veggies in with any of their salads.   My favorite appetizer by far are the Duck Confit Spring Rolls. They're fried, flavorful, and finger-lickin' good! \u00a0love the spicy kick from the Chinese hot mustard and honey dipping sauce. Another notable mention is the House Smoked Salmon Carpaccio. The thinly sliced smoked salmon on hefty triangles of Texas toast, creme fraiche horseradish, and tobiko was a familiar, but creative mix.   Entree wise, I would skip the Five Spice Braised English Short Ribs. They left much to be desired in terms of flavor and the rice cakes underneath were an odd combination. The Teriyaki Grilled Hanger Steak with the potato/leek gratin is delicious though and the Market Fish of the day always has an impressive presentation and is well-prepared.   The restaurant has ample seating and is very spacious, complete with high ceilings and beautiful, intimate decor. Butterfly has a gorgeous bay view, but at night it's hard to see anything. To fully appreciate the scene, lunch would probably be a better option! It's pretty easy to get a reservation here and the service is very friendly, although a tad slow at times. Without a deal, the food isn't quite enough to make me come back and pay regular price for everything, but with it, I think the meal and experience are more than worth it. So if you see a deal, scoop it up!",

The atmosphere seemed right and the decor was nothing short of awesome.  Once we placed our food order, we looked out over the bay, an incredibly scenic view I might add, as we sipped our (to die for) cherry blossom cocktails. Then the food started to arrive but not all at once as many restaurants in the city do. They came out two by two and we were just delighted with each one.   The Kalua Pig appetizer is fiercely savory as well as the Kobe Beef Sliders -- you MUST try these!. Nothing over $7 and the tasty oyster shooters were only $1. Drinks are $5 or less which is almost unheard of anywhere in the city. It didn't matter anyway, the drinks were soooooo GREAT that we won't hesitate to pay full price when we come in for dinner. Butterfly is a can't miss and must try for anyone looking for great drinks, outstanding food, and electric atmosphere!!",

Period. Exclamation Point. \u00a0Staff is off the chart cool. \u00a0The sunset views of the Bay are arguably SF's best. \u00a0Much cocktail creativity at the bar. Ladies, thank me after you have your Cherrrrrrry Blossom, 'K?! Wine list is value-loaded with 4-star and 5-star fireworks at 2-star prices...  Can we talk about food now? This is a pay-attention-to-the-details menu, which my brotha, tha CIA-trained chef, Rob Lam has turned out. \u00a0It starts with the Vietnamese flavors he picked up in his mother's restaurant, and crosses pretty much all the Asian borders. \u00a0No dumb ass, you can not do this in your kitchen at home... \u00a0My favorites are the figs &amp; brie appetizer and the King Salmon entree with cous cous and tapioca risotto. \u00a0Are you paying attention?! \u00a0Good. \u00a0The Heirloom Tomato Salad with pizetta pieces and pepperoncini is THA BOMB. \u00a0The pork with the glazed cherries on top will rock your world. \u00a0If you're ready to expand your mind, get the whole fish. \u00a0'Nuff said... Did I mention the great wine list, with absurdly low prices for some top wines?! \u00a0Two words for you:Whetstone Pinot...  If you're just coming for drinks, your loss foodwise, but there's an excellent bar scene with some chill view space on the big-window side to compensate. \u00a0At the end of the night, they clear out tables and the dance music gets cranked up - tasteful, funky grooves, natch'. \u00a0Cocktail list, please! - my fave is the Pom Cosmo, Yo. \u00a0Though, if you've never been to Hong Kong, their Lycheetini is strong enough to let you pretend, oh so tasty and dignified...  Rob is all that. \u00a0Talk to him about 100% blue agave, dig? \u00a0He's way beyond CIA, but he is part of that mafia. \u00a0This joint reflects his style - check the new bamboo installations and fine-ass chairs. The tunes are serious groove. \u00a0Butterfly was always hip when it was in the Mission, but Rob's taken it to another level. \u00a0  Hey Hipster! - get your grub on!...and learn how to appreciate multiple amuse bouche...

We got a cozy table around the corner overlooking the water. \u00a0It was spectacular and peaceful and absolutely perfect. \u00a0And just because we were around the corner did not mean we were forgotten, which can tend to happen. Going by the yelp favorites, we went with the pork lettuce wraps and banana pudding. \u00a0We also got a margarita, Baileys and coffee, the chicken salad sandwich and the Creme Brulee (a obvious choice as we're on a quest to find the world's best creme brulee). The drinks were great. \u00a0Excellent, not-straight-out-of-a-bottle margarita, and the coffee was warm and had a yummy layer of cream on top. The lettuce wraps were by far the best thing. \u00a0Super tender, sweet bbq sauce, and perfectly portioned. \u00a0The lettuce cups were slightly smaller than most lettuce wraps that I'm used to and it made them into two bite bits of heaven. The chicken sandwich had A LOT of things on it. \u00a0Pickles, onions, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and then the chicken salad. \u00a0It was good but a little overkill. The banana budding was very good, including the carmelized bananas on the side. \u00a0I wish it was served warm. \u00a0We did eat it second and the ice cream barely melted and the inside was pretty cold so I don't think it was warm to begin with. The service was great. \u00a0The busser kept out plates cleared and our drinks refilled. \u00a0OUr bill was presented in a timely manner, but they were closing for in between lunch and dinner and we didn't feel rushed to get out of there which was nice. They say it's kind of pricy, which I guess it could be, but I wasn't sticker shocked. Now for the Creme Brulee - Look - 3...fairly plain with a bit of mint leaf on top. \u00a0Especially compared to the amazingness of the banana pudding aesthetic. Shell Crack-tisity - 5...rock hard but perfect to crack. Texture - 3...Slightly runny. \u00a0Good when mixed with the thick layer of hard sugar on top. Taste - 3...nothing special, but very yummy never the less. Overall Score - 14 out of 20.  We'll be back I hope.",

She was able to hook us up with a booth by the window. However, when we got there, my friend wasn't working yet and this other girl was there. She said our booth wasn't ready yet. The party before us were late and they were not done with their meal yet. So we just ended up getting seated at another table for 2, which wasn't a huge deal.  So we ordered calamari, 1/2 dozen oysters, hamachi sashimi and poke, filet mignon, pork porterhouse, warm chocolate torte, and creme brulee.  The Calamari was pretty good. The crust was light and crisp and not oily. There was a nice sauce that came on top of it which gave it a nice kick.  The 1/2 dozen oysters were pretty good. Tasted fresh. And the different cocktail sauces was a nice variety.  The Hamachi sashimi and poke was deeeelicious! One of the better sashimi's that I've had. Fresh and just melted in my mouth.  The filet mignon was pretty good. It had alot of flavor and was made to my liking. Not too chewy.  The Chocolate torte was pretty good with the coffee ice cream. Good combo!  The Creme Brulee was a good portion size. The sugar crust was good.  The overall experience was nice. Even the owner came over and asked how everything was going.",

From the co-owners, management, service, \u00a0to everything else you will take into consideration when contemplating a place to celebrate a special occasion. I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS PLACE. The food is bad and overly priced. I would rather eat at a hole in the wall Asian place than this piece of shit venue. It might be on the waterfront, but the only view you'll get is the office building across from it and to get to the outside you'll have to cross the dirty kitchen. One of the co-owners, Mike, is an extreme ASSHOLE. Not only is he unprofessional, \u00a0but he talks down to his customers. He talked down to me saying that \u00a0we were the \"type of people that only purchased appetizers and that was it while waiting for it to turn into a lounge.club. We spent 500 dollars. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The food is absolutely DISGUSTING. \u00a0I chose this place to celebrate my birthday with a dinner and a party afterwards (it turns into a club/loungue) after 10. The waiter got our orders wrong, the food took too long to be delivered to our table, then they accused us of lying to them when they got our orders wrong because we inquired about our bill. We spent close to 500 dollars for 10, people which is ridiculous considering the service, the food, and the treatment we received as young (23 -30) patrons to this restaurant. After the dinner, it was supposed to to turn into a club with a 5 dollar guest list before 11 and 10 dollars after. As it reached capacity at around 11:00 PM because they booked too many promoters (I talked to the promoters outside while smoking a cigarette to asses the situation), they started charging 30 dollars at the door to make money and to turn the crowd away. My friends that came from Sacramento, San jose, and the 707 had to pay 30 just come in and have a drink with me. I would be careful about choosing this place to celebrate any type of occasion. The advice I would give when choosing this place is.....make sure to have enough money to throw in their face so that they respect you......make sure you eat before you go there...(because the portions are small, expensive, and not that great) and last but not least DONT come here if your trying having fun. Go there if your trying to spend money for a product that is unsatifactory.",

We had the kalua pork for appetizer and it was delicious. \u00a0We were very impressed with the garlic noodles mixed with kalua pork, shrimp, and shaking beef; the flavors were perfectly blended and savory. \u00a0The whole fish is good but not great, and I would have to say not worth the whopping $39, but we can say we tried it. \u00a0  For dessert our waiter even put candles on our cakes to commemorate our special date, and they were excellent as well.

My dessert was a flour less chocolate torte with Mitchells ice cream. Most excellent!   I'd definitely come back. The atmosphere was cute and the food was a nice sized portion, and tasty. It's a nice place to go for both a night out with friends or date night.",

I'm not sure how nights are on the weekends, but the night we came it was quiet and relaxing so it made dinner that much more enjoyable and intimate. \u00a0Prices were reasonable and they have some good items to choose from on their menu, but the list for entrees is a little limited. \u00a0What i really enjoyed was the live band playing jazz.",

I'm disappointed at the bartenders. Not just bad customer service skills but also very limited mixing skills. Unfortunately, The drinks I requested failed. Here's a few examples.   Grasshopper - Fail They can't make it and gave me non-reasonable answer. \"because I cant hear you,\" with an attitude then turn his head to the next customer or \"sorry, I only know how to mix with just vodka.\"   Tokyo Ice Tea - Fail Basically something that tasted just alcohol with almost no taste of melon, sours, or lime soda. Friend's face had a constipated look of \u00a0\"oh god wth is this?\"  Vodka &amp; Cranberry - Fail There was no harmony in that glass, just tasted like cranberry won the  war over Vodka... Or it was just Over Kill in sweetness  The place looks nice but its like any other club. There are no seats unless you have bottle service. There's a nice smoking area with a nice view of the water, when the clouds are not blocking the moon light. Although, the rest of the night did not dazzle me to come back but surely dazzled me into writing this review. \u00a0Me and my friends wanted decent drinks to enjoy the night but the \"professionalism\" will be keeping me away.",

We also tried the calamari and clam chowder (good but not your typical chowder experience) which was also delicious and ordered several sandwiches to split among our group. Here's what we ordered: chicken salad club, mushroom au jus, cheeseburger, pork katsu, and chicken teriyaki. All of which were great! My favorites were definitely the chicken salad and the pork katsu though.   The location is so pretty, right on the water. I came during lunch but for dinner you can tell it is definitely more of a romantic, intimate setting.

Anyway, that was a side note. \u00a0The edamame is good, but I personally prefer plain edamame, because they put too much salt and sesame oil or whatever it is on it. \u00a0The food is overpriced and the portions are small, but it was good...I tried the pork chop, filet mignon, and scallops (eating off everyone's plate...classy I know).  And I got really drunk...REALLY drunk at dinner, which was slightly embarrassing, and the staff kept giving my whole table strange looks. \u00a0The one nice thing was that the manager came over to the table to tell us about a special smoking area through the kitchen right on the water, so we did not have to go out front. \u00a0Also, they offered to turn on heat lamps for us when we were smoking, which was really nice considering smokers are usually treated like lepers.  Anyway, I'm really hung over still from the wine (that was followed up by more wine) so I can't imagine this review makes a lot of sense. \u00a0But I hope its helpful.  UPDATE!!!! I just remembered, and this is two days later, but they have THE BEST creme brulee I have ever tasted. \u00a0I was just so drunk at that point I almost forgot. \u00a0But even in a drunk haze I can confirm that it is seriously splendid.",

Execution fine, not stellar-- i had Sashimi Salad which might've been great, but dressing was too heavy to let fat of fish shine. A good idea nonetheless (an attempted re-creation at home not out of the question..) She had a chicken club sandwich, recommended for sheer volume, and report was a thumbs up.

BUT WOW, this place was lovely! \u00a0We went in for a late \"lunch\" (we really just picked three things off the appetizer menu) and all of us were very happy and content. I was really caught off guard by all of the negative reviews.  1) \u00a0The atmosphere. \u00a0Butterfly kept the original wood skeleton of the building and just spruced it up with a few added colors here and there. \u00a0Very lovely mix of modern and classic. \u00a0There were couches in the corner where a few twenty-something women and their children were enjoying tea and watching the television. \u00a0It wasn't too busy and it wasn't too empty. \u00a0Our waitress was busy with our table and another family, but was very attentive, friendly, talkative, and helpful. \u00a0My mother was also impressed with the flower arrangements, since she enjoys ikebana. \u00a0it's always a plus when my critical mother is happy! \u00a0There is a lovely waterfront view with a large floor to ceiling window on one wall. \u00a0Really, my only concern would be the white tablecloths. \u00a0The rule of thumb is that white = dressy but that isn't the case at Butterfly. \u00a0Everyone was very casually dressed.  2) \u00a0The food. \u00a0Honestly, this place is very affordable! \u00a0I'm not sure why people think this place is expensive...the menu is only moderately priced. \u00a0Since it was really only 4 PM, the four of us ordered three things from the appetizers menu to share, making it VERY CHEAP. \u00a0This was a suggestion by our waitress, and a very helpful one at that! \u00a0All of us were happy with the items we picked. \u00a0We ordered pan fried garlic noodles -- delicious. \u00a0Noodles were consistent too! \u00a0And the chunks of garlic were excellent! \u00a0Lettuce pork rolls -- incredible. \u00a0My dad is on a carb diet and eats a lot of lettuce rolls (usually with chicken) and he loved these! \u00a0The sauce was perfect. \u00a0All the lettuce leaves were perfect too (crisp, green, and fresh). \u00a0Calamari -- loved it!! \u00a0Usually, a calamari appetizer tastes and looks like something you'd get a fish and chips shack. \u00a0NOT SO AT BUTTERFLY. \u00a0it wasn't greasy and it was very light. \u00a0Overall, we got a lot of food for super cheap! \u00a0And it was expertly made and extremely delicious. \u00a0We definitely would have been happy paying more since the food was of such wonderful quality.  3) The drinks. \u00a0I don't drink and I've never had a cocktail, so I can't dispute or corroborate the varied opinions surrounding their cocktails. \u00a0Really, the only downside I can think of is that Butterfly offers nothing on tap. \u00a0That disappointed my father. \u00a0He says it never tastes as good coming out of a can or bottle. \u00a0Furthermore, the drinks were about twice as expensive as expected. \u00a0We didn't notice this until we looked at the check. \u00a0My sister and I always get mixed soda beverages (like a Shirley Temple) and they were priced the same as my father's alcohol. \u00a0Every time we asked for another, we were charged again. \u00a0So that was a bit unexpected, but it just taught us to ask in the future if in doubt!  Sorry, I know I type a lot and this has become a long review. \u00a0The point is the my family and I enjoyed the decor and the welcoming atmosphere. \u00a0The food was an awesome deal for the great quality! \u00a0Every item was wonderful. \u00a0The drinks were more overpriced than usual and the dress code is more casual despite the white tablecloths, but that's about it. \u00a0I will definitely come here again! \u00a0I'm very pleased that we discovered this place and that we decided to try it out despite all the negative reviews I had previously read.",

So she told the manager, and he said he would gladly make a new one for her that's more on the medium side, but my friend declined because we were in a slight rush. So instead they gave us free dessert! :D That's good service. They were so kind about it. The banana lumpia dessert was REALLY good, get that one! It's basically banana eggrolls, coconut ice cream, and slices of banana on top. We also had the mint chocolate chip/ice cream dessert, but the lumpia dessert beat this one hands down.

My friend mentioned how fresh the mussels were, tender, perfectly done, not rubbery. \u00a0We picked all appetizers and the hamburger. \u00a0The hamburger was very tender and the fries were big chunks, crunchy outside and inside soft! \u00a0I wish they would provide like an alternative to ketchup, like inventing a signature Aioli or even their own Wasabi/Garlic sauce for the fries (hint, hint). \u00a0I like their sign outside: \u00a0Kids Menu. \u00a0This is one of the nicest places to take a child. \u00a0Everyone was so well behaved! \u00a0It's nice for families to be together in such a nice place! \u00a0Hard to see \"Kid Friendly\" place. \u00a0Bartender was non-stop. \u00a0Drinks looked really good. \u00a0DAT is a good deal and you can order one and shared for two! \u00a0Their dishes are really good portions.",

We live a few blocks away in North Beach and for whatever reason, never checked Butterfly out. \u00a0I really like the space.. the windows, the high ceiling, the colorfulness.. \u00a0the edamame standard starter is a cool and welcomed touch.  I had the blue cheese filet - while the cook recommends medium rare, I asked for medium, no problems. \u00a0It was medium spot on. \u00a0Very delicious with yummy whipped potatoes and vegetables.  The highlight of my night was the warm chocolate torte... simply delicous. \u00a0I absolutely love warm gooey chocolate desserts and this is one of the best.

We stuck to the Dine about Town menu and were happily impressed by the food. \u00a0For appetizer I had the duck confit spring rolls, on its own it lacked a lot of flavor, however once you added the honey and chinese mustard sauce, \u00a0it became tasty. \u00a0The spring rolls weren't greasy, and the sauce had a bit of a kick to it and cleared my nasal passages but I liked it. \u00a0For our entree we both got the shaking beef cobb salad, it was really good. \u00a0I didn't expect the poached egg on top of the salad, but my egg was perfectly cooked not too hard, but also not too runny. \u00a0The bacon and the prosciutto brought a great flavor to the salad and the lettuce was well dressed and the beef was an added treat seeing how flavorful it was. \u00a0Desert was a warm chocolate torte with coffee ice cream and raspberries and I couldn't get enough of it. \u00a0  Overall we had great conversation and good food. \u00a0The food wasn't heavy so I left feeling comfortably full. \u00a0Not to mention we got a great view of the water while we ate.",

Butterfly is located just a few buildings down from the dock area. The decor is nice, and we were seated right away by a window looking over the bay. However, the bench seat was up against the window making it only possible to see the view if you looked behind you, otherwise, we were facing all the other diners, looking towards us and out the window! The lunch menu is much smaller then the dinner menu, and the selections didn't look as appealing. My husband ordered the Turmeric Grilled Snapper with Sizzling Onions and Herbs. The dish was difficult to eat, and he said the snapper was pretty bland, but otherwise an ok dish. I ordered the Kobe burger with steak fries. The patty was way too large, and the bun was of poor quality (think safeway brand buns.) and not proportionate to the size of the patty, making it very soggy and impossible to eat picking it up. The fries were huge, and unfortunately were not cooked through. Nothing worse then undercooked fries!  The beer selection was very minimal, none on tap, five bottle offerings and they were out of the first 2 my husband requested.  The service was friendly and efficient, the main plus to our visit there, but not enough to make us want to return.",

The calamari was ok... there wasn't much substance other than the batter. \u00a0I didn't really feel like I was eating any squid at all. \u00a0The grilled snapper came out sizzling on a clay iron pan on a bed of basil leaves and caramelized onions. \u00a0We also got a separate plate with our noodles and lettuce wraps. \u00a0Good thing I'm Vietnamese, otherwise I may not have known how to make the wraps. =P \u00a0The fish was cooked well and wasn't dry. \u00a0They don't give you much lettuce, but a good amount of fish... so I just ended up eating the rest of my fish with my noodles and the fish sauce. \u00a0  The decor of the restaurant is nice and comtemporary. \u00a0I liked their 2 seater booths, but too bad they weren't facing the ocean. \u00a0The total bill was $45 for 2 people-- 1 appetizer and 2 entrees. \u00a0A bit pricey for lunch, but it was still satisfying. \u00a0I don't think I would drive all the way out here again for the food, but it's good to try once.",

You know, VIP parking! \u00a0Then I found out we were going to Butterfly and not Bubble Lounge. Noooo..pwned.  This review is for the club venue.   Must have been Filipino night. Crowd was 98% Filipino. Not that I cared.   We were told earlier that day that any persons name on the guestlist can bring 5 additional guests. Apparently not! First of all, half of the names that were suppose to be on the list were not. Second, those who were on the list were not allowed to bring any guest. What kind of bs is that? They wanted each non-listed person to pay $20 cover. Umm nooo..   After much debate and negotiation, we got the cover down to $5. Much more manageble, but still.. : [  First thought: This place stinks. Literally. Smelled like the sewers. Mainly because it is on the pier next to the water.   Dance floor: Really spacious. One of the biggest I've experienced.   Music: 5/10. Wasn't really feeling it. A collection of old mainstream hits. Mainly hip hop.   Drinks: 3 wisemen, Jager bomb both $10 a piece. Also had Patron courtesy of Rite Aid :D  Bathroom: Pretty clean. No line. No annoying cologne, mint, towel guy. I was happy. :)   Coat check is $5. I rather freeze a little.   Parking: Bay st.  Highlight: The outdoor smoking area is on top of the water. Pretty cool, but smells. Maybe someone will get drunk enough and jump in. JK. :p  Will I return? Nahh..",

I had really high expectations for this place.   I was really excited to try this place, but ultimately was disappointed. There weren't \u00a0many menu options to choose from and the portions were too small. It didn't correlate with the extreme pricing! We started off with the Kalua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups. The taste was sweet and reminded me of pulled pork. The lettuce cups itself looked really fresh and had such a pretty color green to it!   I ordered the Roasted \"Peking\" Duck. It was really tasty but wow 3 pieces? I saw other yelp photos with 4 BIG pieces, and I got baby pieces! The crepe that came with it was savory. My mom got the Grilled Hanger Steak \"Kalbi\" Style. That I liked! It is just, there aren't any carbs on the plate, so the meat itself is way too overpowering and needs something to tone it down. Hence, the Wok Seared Garlic Noodles we had to get as a side. These tasted pretty normal. Nothing exquisite or unique about it! Tasted like what's offered at regular fusion restaurants. My dad's dish was beautifully placed! I really enjoyed looking at it. He got the Roasted Chicken Roulade. Sadly, it didn't taste as good as it looked! It was really bland and plain! The rice with a poached egg was probably better than the chicken.   Before I forget, they gave complimentary edamame too! Nicely seasoned with tons of flavor!   Though the food was not as tasty as I expected we did have a good experience. The reason being is the owner came out to greet everyone! He is a chef and was extremely friendly. He started speaking to my parents in Vietnamese so I thought that was really cool. I felt that he really appreciated his culture and upbringing in the US when he came as a baby, and really worked hard to fuse the two cultures together in his foods! This aspect of my dining experience definitely gives this place another +.5 stars.   So I'd give this place an overall 3.5 stars. It is conveniently located by the pier, so depending on where you sit in the restaurant, you might be near the waters! If you're not, the restaurant is nicely decorated anyway so any where you sit offers a pleasant view.",

You basically had to spend $100+ to get $50 taken off your tab. Even with main course dishes around the $25 mark, we still had work to do. Here's the showdown  Appetizers: 1.) Spring Rolls: fried eggrolls with duck. These tasted wonderful by themselves, but they were served with a mustard/wasabi sauce which was really overpowered by the wasabi's strength. Go VERY easy on the sauce. 2.) Calamari: Lightly battered and crispy calamari served with a light drizzle of sauce (I forget what). I have a bad habit of dunking my food in sauce but this plate kind of didn't let you do that. 3.) Sashimi: This was my favorite. Four large slices of sashimi plated with slices of blood oranges, oranges, and other tangy things. Once we finished this plate, I was using the citrus juice left over in the plate to dip my calamari in.  Main Courses 1.) NY Steak: My boyfriend ordered this dish and the steak was very good on its own without the need of any sauce or salt or pepper. As it should be. 2.) Duck: I ordered this plate. The duck was cooked wonderfully (med rare) but it did feel rubbery at some points. Served with a green onion crepe. 3.) Seared Ahi Tuna: My mom ordered this. Generous pieces of seared tuna served on a bed or red sticky rice. It was alright.  Dessert 1.) Creme Brulee: the description said \"served with seasonal berries\" but all that it was topped with was a quarter of a strawberry. This dish was heavenly.  Other 1.) Lycheetini: Probably not that strong because my mom gets chatty after one good drink.  Grand total? $106, with gratuity included.   Overally, the portions at this restaurant do not disappoint. Service was spectacular, food was ALMOST there. I actually enjoyed the appetizers a lot more than the main dishes and if I do come back it'll probably be for drinks and appetizers.",

    "review_text": "Butterfly is a cozy, upscale-looking Asian fusion restaurant that would be perfect for dates, especially if you get a waterfront table. I imagine it to be rather romantic and puts you in the mood for a glass of wine if you're watching the sun set over the pier with your hubs.   Though when we went, there was a huge family of literally 20 with the parents socializing and talking among themselves while the kids had their own designated table (didn't you hate being shunned from the adult table as a kid?). Because of that, the ambiance was a little interesting. The orders were also a little slow coming out because the big party had to be served, but overall service was very attentive.  The food: Good - Duck spring rolls - everyone raves about it in their review here and it's delicious. Fried to a crisp, so they're crunchy and piping hot. The duck filling has a slight soy sauce flavor and is shredded with an assortment of other veggie ingredients. Each one is kind of small but it's a good portion to share between 2 people. Just watch out for the dipping sauce which is VERY wasabi-heavy. If you don't enjoy wasabi do remember to ask for an alternative. The sauce is premade so unfortunately the wasabi cannot be excluded. - Cod - it came swimming (not live =P) in a seafood broth that tasted super light yet savory, if that makes sense. An interesting dish, as it was definitely a marine protein dish yet there was a soup element to it. The shrimp that came with it definitely had an Asian influence to it, but the dough it was wrapped over tasted a bit chewy and the flavor of the shrimp itself was unmemorable. Ok - New York steak - this is what my sister ordered and it was cooked the way she specified. Not much to say about this entree. You can't go wrong with and you'd probably enjoy it, but it wouldn't amaze you.  The menu has a handful of entrees - not too many, but enough to choose from. Their items are more specialized and intricate which probably explains the limit of the number of entrees.   Food was good, but without the Bloomspot deal I think I wouldn't have found the full-price value worthy. I enjoyed my experience at Butterfly, but I also think there are many unique and colorful restaurants in the city that are worth trying, whether you're looking for a date night spot or trying to bring everyone in your extended family to dinner.",

After nibbling on the sesame and salt covered edamame, we ordered the duck rolls with wasabi sauce for the table. \u00a0I had the fantastic poached eggs with salmon, avocado and hollandaise sauce, which basically was eggs Benedict with salmon and avocado. \u00a0It was...man, it was pretty amazing. \u00a0And really, really filling! \u00a0It came with a small bowl of fresh fruit which included raspberries, kiwi, lychee, pineapple and other fruit. Sampled some of my brother's crab/eggs Benedict. \u00a0That was good too. \u00a0We all split the chocolate torte at the end, I could only handle one bite because I was pretty stuffed. \u00a0  The restaurant includes a full bar, really nice decor, and an excellent view of the Bay, since it sits off of Pier 33. \u00a0It really was the highlight of our day, and I plan on heading back.",

The spring rolls themselves were very bland without the sauce and the duck was a bit dry. I'm not sure what all the rave about this appetizer is, but I was really disappointed.  Grilled Hanger Steak: This was really good and cooked perfectly. It was served with some sliced rice cake rolls, which had a nice panfried crispiness. I liked the asian fusion sauce they had going on this dish.  Grilled Pork Porterhouse: I really liked the vegetables/garnish on this dish. I ate all the vegetables! The pork itself tasted too much like a cut of ham to me, and I was just not into it, although it was cooked nicely.  Banana Bread Pudding: This was the star of the meal, my favorite dish all night. It was just soooooooooooooo good I cannot do it justice describing it. It was moist, soft, and had the perfect mix of banana, ice cream, and cinnamon. It even came garnished with little pieces of bruleed bananas. It was cute!  Service: Our server was awesome. He also reminded me of Veronica Mars' dad, which made it more awesome. I dunno.",

As a food service veteran, you know what to expect. \u00a0Let's just say, expectations were grossly under met at Butterfly yesterday for an \"un\" Happy Hour. \u00a0  Met up with my girls here. \u00a0We decided on Butterfly because of the good happy hour specials. \u00a0Great bargains for drink and appetizer specials. \u00a0Kudos to you. \u00a0That's why you get a whopping 2 stars. \u00a0  Now, let's get to the nitty gritty. \u00a0SERVICE WAS APPAULING. \u00a0Our bartender (by the way... her name is Tiffany), decided to put everyone's order onto ONE tab because we \"sat next to each other\". \u00a0Sorry, but when you're at a bar meeting up with friends and order SEPARATELY throughout the evening, the bartender is supposed to ask \"start a tab or close it out\". \u00a0Yeah, there were people that I was sitting next to that I didn't even know, friends of friends. \u00a0Why don't you just throw that other guys tab on to it as well. \u00a0Go for it Tiff! \u00a0  Anywhoo... so she definitely caught a major tude when we asked to separate the tab. \u00a0Don't know why, because I didn't even so much as frown when you spilled half of my martini on my leather bag. \u00a0(I sure as hell did though when you didn't even comp it!).  So as we were leaving, some potential customers outside asked us how it was. \u00a0We said the food is ok, service sucked. \u00a0They opted out... karma is a bitch. \u00a0Or maybe capitalism wins again! \u00a0Try harder Butterfly.",

High points: The rib appetizer was fantastic. Sweet and sticky, with bleu cheese sprinkled on top. Flavorful to the point that I stopped being polite about it and just scooped them on to my plate. Also, the complimentary endeme beans were great. We had a group of 12 and our server was attentive even as the place got jammed later.  Low points: What is that smell right when you walk in the door? A rancid, greasy odor is not a good thing to get the evening started. Others have mentioned the decor. Eh. Ikea meets Pier One, The bar could use a refinishing. I like bars made of wood that looks like it's 'lived a little' but this one just looked dingy. Beware of places that have quotes of reviews on the exterior of the restaurant. I wasn't bowled over by the wine list as the blaring advertisement inferred that I might be. The 'by the glass' list could use a revamp. Other than the ribs and beans, the rest of the food was not terrible but not great.  No points: The view is OK...not breathtaking for an 'on the water' place. Bartender was OK but a smile would be nice.  You could do worse than Butterfly but you could do much, much better.  Note: I've been informed by the establishment that I know nothing about wine and that I should have indeed been bowled over by the wine list. Over 400 Yelp reviews and this is the first time I've had a place seek me out to specifically insult me.",

    "review_text": "I wanted to like this place but for the money spent, it definitely wasn't worth the time nor the effort.   The decor of the establishment was nice, definitely an upscale sort of restaurant with a surreal sort of theme. The service was okay as well since my water glass was tended to in a somewhat timely manner(I drink a lot of water...) . I do not drink alcoholic beverages so I wouldn't know how their drinks/bar fares in the perspective of a liquor connoisseur although members of the party I was with commented that the drinks they ordered were very slow to come out. So at this point of the review, I would have rated the restaurant 3 stars...but due to the quality of food served I lowered it to one star if anything to dissuade people from coming here for the food.  The onion soup was terrible. I don't know exactly what the chef or cooking crew threw in there but it seemed almost as if they looked around the kitchen, found whatever was close to expiration or had expired and tossed it in the soup. Then after doing that, mask the flavor with something sour like lemon/lime juice and/or vinegar and then put cheese on top because everyone likes cheese?? Am I right? Other people in my party opted for the salad, which in hindsight seemed like the safe choice, you can't mess up salad unless the dressing is just disgusting.   Next up is the Ahi tuna I had as my main entree. It was definitely overcooked but edible. It tasted like canned tuna though...I like canned tuna but not when I have to pay a super premium for it. I didn't want to send it back as I was afraid of something 'special' in the return dish plus after the onion soup fiasco I pretty much knew how the meal was going to turn out. I think if they had just sent the tuna out raw without their pitiful attempt at cooking it, I would have liked it better. I love sushi! Too bad it wasn't a sushi place, but maybe that's a good thing. I don't think I would like to suffer from dysentery for a couple days. Other people in my party had some sort of braised short rib with risotto? They were commenting on how the risotto was undercooked. I don't think any one of us had anything good to say about their entree.  For dessert, I had the creme brulee. Most of the other people in my party opted for this as well. What was somewhat unusual is that the dessert was served to us chilled, as if it came directly from the freezer. I don't really have anything against it chilled however, and seemed okay to me. I have a sweet tooth so anything sweet regardless of temperature would taste okay to me.   I know that this is a scathing review of the food served here. Maybe the onion soup was supposed to taste the way it tasted considering this is a restaurant whose cuisine is that of 'fusion'. Maybe the tuna was supposed to be served rare or medium rare and I should have sent my plate back for the 'just right' one at the risk of possibly getting a little something 'extra special' on the side. Maybe it was just a tragic set of of circumstances that led me to order whatever I ordered and that in a parallel dimension my otherworldly self may have decided upon an entirely different choice of food and as a consequence enjoyed the meal. Alas, this does not seem to be the case for my present self and I hope beyond hope that I never find myself eating at this establishment ever again.   As an aside, \u00a0I stopped by my local Nation's Hamburgers around 1 or 2am since it is open late on Fri/Weekends and I grabbed a grilled chicken sandwich with a milk shake. That tasted much better than what I had at Butterfly plus filled me up because obviously I didn't get full eating at Butterfly.",

    "review_text": "The abstract: Food 3.5-4 stars; Service 5 stars; ambiance 4-5 stars  We had family visiting and they were hungry and wanted to eat after their day on Alcatraz so I searched yelp for restaurants near the ferry terminal. We made very last minute reservations for our large (11 people) group, and they graciously accommodated us. I was a little nervous about it, since I had to choose the place for for a group of international foodies. The problem with \u00a0restaurants in touristy areas like this is that they don't HAVE to be great to stay in business. They can be mediocre and still keep going just because the clientele changes daily. I was very relieved--pleasantly surprised, even--by our dining experience at Butterfly.  Our waiter Porter was off the charts amazing. He gave us very detailed descriptions of any dish we asked about, and offered accurate and candid personal opinions about what was good and what was not so. Which is nice. I don't like when wait-staff claim everything is amazing, because realistically, unless you are at the French Laundry, it ain't. Anyway, everything he recommended was spot on. He was super personable and told me the ricotta cheese on my entree was made from milk he brought in from his sister's cow from a farm in Marin. My most favorite thing was when he took the children's orders directly from them. Being experienced little foodies, they all knew exactly what they wanted and were able to order on their own (even the 3 year old.) I love when people treat my children like the competent individuals they are.   The menu was one of the more interesting ones I've seen lately. We ended up trying the majority of the menu and it was all really good. Maybe not great, but certainly not disappointing. My husband thought his hangar steak was just ok--I tried it and liked it quite a lot. I had the tempura-fried squash blossoms. They were a fun, novel choice. Not something I'll crave or anything, but I enjoyed the dish and ate it all up. The potato gnocchi served with them were wonderful and I don't typically like gnocchi. The kids' meals were good too...no reheated sysco chicken nuggets...real food. At $10 per kid, I would hope for that.  Anyway, bottom line, we enjoyed our meal here very much. It was the perfect place to meet up in the tourist area, but not feel like you were IN a tourist attraction. No one even seemed bothered that we hung out awhile after we paid and just visited, which was really nice since our party consisted of family who live in Hong Kong, Taiwan, So Cal, Mo, and here. It was a rare convergence for us and I am glad we were able to spend some of our time together in such a pleasant, welcoming establishment.",

It was open bar, I didn't have any alcoholic drinks (yeah I'm so lame. But I'm not about to get butt crazy drunk in front of the execs.) but everyone else seemed to def take advantage of that, but since it was open bar, the bartenders (2 or 3 people), took their sweet time when I came to making the drinks, b/c what's their hurry right?   They \u00a0had little appetizers going around which was probably my favorite part of the night, we had oyster shooters (GOOD), tuna pokie (VERY GOOD), and lettuce wraps (kinda fussy to eat since you have to use your hands), sushi (it was alright), and some others, but there was a nice array of choices, but my two favs were the oysters and pokie.  Appetizer we had the choice of a creamy ceasar salad, or French onion soup, there wasn't anything special about the salad, it was your typical ceasar with chicken, the French onion soup was pretty typical, but I liked it, it wasn't super salty or anything and there was TONS of stretchy cheese on top.  Entre, we had the choice of the veggie option, filet mignon, and something else that I don't remember, all the filet mignons were cooked medium to medium rare which was perfect. I had no complaints about this dish. But please remember this was all on my company's tab, so for free, all of this was pretty good, I'd have to say I'd pay no more than $28 for this entre personally....  Dessert we had the choice of lava flow cake, which I didn't choose b/c it was too chocolately, def someone who LOVES super sweet and gooey. I chose to have the crme brulee. It was huge, and very good. Ate the whole thing.   Service was pretty good, the servers pretty much stayed out of our way and let us do our own thing. There was a little bit of a dance floor to the side of all the tables that were lined up, probably had about 100 people or so at the company party, good sized venue for a group like that, but any bigger it would have been annoying.   Bathroom was alright, sort of on the clean side, but was kinda dirty... the trash needed to be taken out. I was a little surprised that it was like that when they knew they had a private party to host...  They also had coat check which was nice. \u00a0  The overall layout of the place was nice, the bar is pretty big and nice, good view of the water, you can go outside for air or smoke too.",

They seve very peculiar dishes, so if you're looking for some new fusions, or flavors, this would be the place to try. Just beware that you are going to get something that you wouldn't expect in SF. Yes it's seafood, but much like in Russian cooking, if you order their \"whole fish\", it's actually a WHOLE FISH. The plop a full fish on a plate in front of you, grilled, with some lemon. Go figure. The service also tends to be pretty snotty there. For some reason they think that they are the cream of the crop in San Francisco. Ok maybe they would be if they were in the midwest, but honey, come on. This is SF, every restaurant is cream of the crop. How do you think they can afford their overpriced rent? So like i said, if you're up for something a little different, this is a good place to try. Just make sure you come dressed for a blizzard because it is COLD, and plan on deep pockets.",

The shaking beef cobb salad and the creme brulee were quite tasty.  The view of the water is spectacular (almost breathtaking enough to make you forget the tourists surrounding you). The decor is very posh modern, but in a warm inviting way.  My only complaint was that the second half of our meal the service took a dramatic nose dive. However, our server explained that our original server hadn't been feeling well and had left. He ended up having to cover half the dining room by himself.

    "review_text": "I was very impressed with Butterfly. Walked in early on a Tuesday evening and got a table overlooking the water. We started off with half a dozen Beausoleil oysters coupled with three Champagne and Thai mignonette sauces and a Bloody Mary oyster shooter. Yum -- and doing shooters with a woman is just hot. The wine list is excellent, and we had a glass of Wolf Blass sparkling wine and a sauvignon blanc with the oysters. For our entrees, we ordered Ponzu Grilled Hanger Steak with portobello mushroom and cabernet jus, and pan roasted Sonoma Liberty Duck with scallion crepes. The steak was very good. The duck was awesome, as it included both breast and leg meat. I was tempted to pair our meal with the 2001 Karl Lawrence cabernet, which Butterfly sells by the half bottle (score!), but we've had that before. So we chose the Calix Cellars Syrah from the Parmalee-Hill Vineyard in Sonoma instead. Delicous wine. Must get more. The service was attentive and friendly -- a very positive experience here!",

    "review_text": "I came here for their Dine About Town this evening and was quite impressed. For $36.95, you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert. The only other time I've been here was when it was turned into a club at night a few years ago. Here's the rundown:  1. Service: I made 6:15pm reservations via OpenTable and we had no trouble getting a window seat for my sister and I. It was kind of awkward that the booth faced the restaurant and NOT the beautiful view, though. Our waiter was very attentive and paced the meal perfectly.  2: Food: I ordered the smoked salmon and strawberry salad roll with nuoc cham sauce for my appetizer and was glad I did! All the components complemented each other perfectly. The smoked salmon and strawberry combination was heavenly and the nuoc cham sauce added that extra subtle punch that amazed me. Five sushi-size pieces had me full right then and there. Next up was the young tumeric grilled snapper, caramelized onions, rice noodles, and nuoc cham dipping sauce. So, the menu failed to mention that these were served as lettuce wraps, which is why it caught me off guard when it was delivered to our table. Side note to those on a date or wanting to impress a fellow diner: don't order this! It can be quite messy trying to hold everything in a lettuce wrap. Everything was presented nicely, but I wasn't too impressed with the snapper. The seasoning didn't have me wanting more, but that nuoc cham sauce got me again and was the saving grace of this dish. Finally, for dessert I ordered the banana bread pudding with Mitchell's macapuno ice cream and banana br\u00fbl\u00e9e. According to their online menu, the options for dessert were supposed to include a warm chocolate torte and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but I'm glad the banana bread pudding was on there instead because it was really good. The melted macapuno ice cream and the warm banana bread pudding was heavenly in my mouth. It's also a good enough portion to share. My sister ordered the warm chocolate torte with Mitchell's coffee ice cream, so I was able to try a bite. It was definitely a rich chocolate dessert!... Maybe even a bit too rich for my taste!  3. Drinks: My sister ordered the kiwi and cucumber gimlet. I tried a sip and it was pretty good. Nice and refreshing for a warm SF evening.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with Butterfly. I saw some other food floating around the restaurant like the fried whole fish and the fried calamari that looked pretty good. I'm not sure if I'll be back any time soon just because it is quite pricey, but if you're curious, it's worth a try and just be sure to order the smoke salmon and strawberry salad roll appetizer!",

The menu selection was wonderful. Lots of egg dishes as well as some of their lunch selections.  I had the kahlua pig &amp; poached egges. The pig and poached egg were atop pancakes. It looked great and tasted great. There was also a generous sized fruit cup with lychee &amp; the standard fruit.  I also enjoyed the pomegranite &amp; club soda drink.

I went after I saw the promo. on Check Please Bay Area. \u00a0I was excited to go but we had some issues from the get go. \u00a0We made reservations during a week day around 11:30 a.m. When we arrived we told the greeter we had lunch reservations (the place had only about 10 people there) for a quiet area. \u00a0She sat us right next the the bar area in a movable table that faces the bar. \u00a0Their website ad says \"breathtaking views.\" \u00a0BS. \u00a0All the booths that \u00a0are along the bay-side window are facing to the interior of the restaurant. \u00a0You have to turn around and mess your neck up to see the view. \u00a0In any event, we called the greeter and told her we wanted to move to the table and chair seating that was on the opposite end of the window area next to a larger rounded booth. \u00a0That was better, so we could at least face the water seated at a nice table for two. \u00a0  Ok, now comes the wait staff: \u00a0They were understaffed even with 10 people eating. \u00a0The service was slow, yet professional. \u00a0Our server was as nice as he could be, but everything was in SLOW motion.  We sat there a long long time before the water person came over to get up water. \u00a0I had to ask the waiter two to have the water person bring water. \u00a0The waiter ended up bringing the water and shortly afterward the water person finally showed up, but he was no longer needed. \u00a0I ordered the turmeric red snapper with the onions. \u00a0IT was well prepared and loved the onions. \u00a0I can't remember what my guest ordered, but was happy with it. \u00a0 \u00a0After we ordered, our food, we waited and waited for the server to show up to see if we wanted anything else or just wanted our check. \u00a0We were ready to go at that point, we were on a lunch schedule and did not have all day to sit and wait for service. \u00a0At that time, more tourists started rolling in (about 12:45 ish) but I did not not notice more staffing to pick up on the slack. \u00a0hmmm  When we were about to leave, Chef Robert Lam came over to our table to chat us up about the food. \u00a0Of course the food was great and we did \u00a0tell him that. \u00a0Everything was prepared perfectly. \u00a0I looked around to see if he went to other tables, but he just went back to the kitchen. \u00a0So, I wondered by he just stopped by our table? \u00a0In any event, we enjoyed the special treatment given that the service was off.  If you want a view, don't make a reservation for the window booths. There is only one small table for 2-3 that you can turn to face the water.",

    "review_text": "Bought a voucher from LivingSocial so I decided to take my mom out for dinner at Butterfly.   Made reservations for 6:00 and were promptly seated. Our table was right next to the window so the view was pretty awesome. Only problem was the seats faced AWAY from the window so we were staring at the couple at the bar the entire night instead of out at the ocean... Poor design/planning?   We ordered the following:   Kalua Pig with Butter Cup Lettuce -  Delicious! The shredded pork was so juicy and soft and flavorful. The lettuce was crisp and tender. What an awesome combo. Beware: It can get messy as the juices from the pork drips everywhere.   Lemongrass Seafood Minestrone -  Bleh. Didn't like this soup at all. I would rather have a can of Progresso minestrone soup than the one served here.  Macadamia and Blue Cheese Crusted Filet Mignon -  I ordered it medium done and the meat was perfect. Pink on the inside and still tender and juicy. The blue cheese was a little overpowering for me as I usually prefer milder cheeses, but blue cheese lovers may really enjoy this combo. The mashed potatoes that came with the dish weren't completely mashed up... tsk tsk.   Grilled Pork Porterhouse -  Tried a piece of my mom's entree and I was quite surprised at how delicious it was. What I liked about it the most was the fact that it wasn't accompanied by any sauces so that I could really taste the natural flavor of the meat. Two thumbs up for that one.   Chocolate Torte with Coffee Ice Cream -  The chocolate torte was so, sooooo good! The outer cake part was alright, kind of dry and flavorless actually. But when I cut into the inside, the hot melted chocolate was heavenly. And the combo of cold coffee ice cream with the chocolate was to die for. Loved it.  Classic Creme Brulee -  Also delicious. It's just your basic creme brulee but done extremely well.  Overall, I would give the appetizers and entrees three stars. However, the dessert was so phenomenal that I decided to add an extra star :]",

I got to the restaurant early and there wasn't a soul there! Which didn't discourage me from saddling up to the bar and getting in a few drink orders before the end of Happy Hour. Butterfly has a great happy hour - $5 selective cocktails, beer, and appetizers. It's a deal at twice the price, and after Happy Hour that is exactly what you'll pay...  Although, I do have to rib the bartender a bit since he damn near knocked over Beth's drink into her lap when he put down our starter place mat. Beth's cat like reflexes saved her from a soggy lap. Smooth move bar tender. Hahaha...no big thang!  I ordered a $5 Cherry Blossom which was really good, and so I ordered another! A super light vodka cocktail with a fruity twist - but not sweet fruity. Very mellow! I dig it. We also ordered the Duck Confit Spring Rolls which are served with a spicy mustard sauce - what a tasty starter!  When we were finally ready to be seated for dinner I took a look around the place. I LOVE the look of Butterfly! The lamps, the edgy wall hangings, the full wall of windows looking out across the Bay onto the glittering lights of the East Bay...I love the atmosphere. My favorite part of the d\u00e9cor are the giant puffer fish (ish) black spiky lights with red bulbs. So cool. You feel like you are dinning under a black widow puffer fish! We were seated in a booth, which is mentionable because their booths are SO roomy and comfortable. We sat back and chatted, but I could equally see getting cozy with a date as well!  I ordered the Cesar Salad (always - God I love me some Cesar Salad) and I loved their fresh, not overly smothered in dressing Cesar. The croutons were super tasty as well. Kudos! For my main dish I ordered the Hanger Steak which is served with potatoes au gratin and saut\u00e9ed Portobello mushrooms. This entree was really really really good, and I don't just think that because I have been on a diet of non fat cottage cheese and carrot sticks for three weeks. The beef was expertly and perfectly cook exactly how I requested it. So tender, it practically chewed itself.  I can't wait to go back for Happy Hour!",

Too full for dessert this time, but the coffee was very good. \u00a0  Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable Asian-Fusion type restaurant. \u00a0The menu offered some very clever and intriguing menu options, and I can't wait to come back again to try more. \u00a0Oh, and have another Cherry Blossom, or two",

I love their set menus during special occasions where you choose one amuse, one first course, one entree and one dessert. The first time we came here was for Valendoom's Day back in 2009 and since then, we've tried their set menus for Mother's Day brunch, Christmas and New Year's as well.  Most recently, we came here 3 days ago with some friends who were on vacation from Oz and tried their \u00e0 la carte dinner menu. Everything was great - service...appetizers....soup (OMG the Mushroom Cappuccino Soup is the BOMB!!)....everyone else' entrees. All except for mine. I had ordered the Free Range Chicken Clay Pot, consisting of chicken breast, chinese sausage sticky rice, a poached egg and braised cabbage. The chicken was dry and bland tasting and the sticky rice was soaking in oil! The only thing cooked perfectly was the egg so I just ate that and maybe 3 tiny pieces of chinese sausage.  When the waiter came by towards the end of the meal to check in on us, I had to tell him nicely that my dish sucked and that they should consider removing it from their menu :0) He was so awesome about my complaint and even told me they appreciate feedback like that so they can improve on their menu. He offered to have the kitchen make me something but I didn't want anything else so they were nice enough to take mine off the final bill. The manager even came to apologize personally and said both he and the chef agreed the chicken was very dry and that the dish just wasn't up to par.  Still love this place!",

So, I used to live a few blocks from Butterfly, and it was my go to for happy hour and brunches. \u00a0I loved Kimmy, the sweet bartender, who like myself, moved away to NYC. \u00a0Sadly, upon my last visit, I was sadden to see that my old go to has declined so drastically - or at least the bar service has.  We arrived mid afternoon on a Saturday, around 3-4 pm, so the place was pretty vacant. \u00a0I ordered a bloody mary and my boyfriend ordered their take on the mojito, with sake. \u00a0As a bloody aficionado, its rare that I LOVE a bloody (zuni!), but also rare that i despise one. \u00a0This bloody, was truly AWFUL. \u00a0As in the lady next to me wasn't drinking hers at all (arrived before we did), and eventually ordered a water to chase the bloody with. \u00a0We asked the super unfriendly bartender if they changed up the mix and it was no longer homemade...he bluntly said it's still homemade, and whats the problem, is it too spicy? I replied that i LOVE spicy bloodies, but there's something like an overwhelming celery taste to it (i believe mucho celery salt), which he basically said no, and awkwardly stood there, aware that it was undrinkable, yet not bothering to do anything about it.  Essentially, as my boyfriends drink wasn't great and the rest of the menu options left much to be desired, i tried to chug my bloody (making faces of anguish at every sip, unintentionally), so we could get the f out of there. \u00a0Left it half full. \u00a0  Horribly rude bartender (he also looked a bit sloppy, not in attire, but in general physical maintenance) + undrinkable bloody = won't miss living a few blocks away from anymore.",

I really like the interior design on the restaurant, especially the booths. Very modern.   It wasn't very busy around 7, and they seated us right by the windows (but there's actually not much a view). I ordered the roasted duck peking style, while my BFFL ordered the crispy chicken stuffed with crab and cheese. She absolutely loved her dish, although she couldn't finish it. The thing was really huge! As for my dish, it came with scallion crepes and a hoisin cream sauce. It was deeeeliiisssh. A contemporary take on the traditional chinese peking duck. I cleared my whole plate.   We also used a $25 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate, so we did save some moolah.

The only reason I'd recommend people to check out this place is the ambiance and nice views of the water. But do not come here for the food. You'll be paying the prices of restaurants in this category but will be receiving sub par and lackluster quality.  We tried almost everything on the menu and were collectively disappointed with how every dish was consistently substandard. The salt and pepper calamari was flavorless, the duck confit spring rolls felt wet, the shanghai garlic noodles were too chewy (they were moderately salvaged by the shaking beef but still had such a difficult texture), the ahi tuna was too hard, and the house-specialty kalua pig did not move the needle favorbly... it was a bit too dry.

I really love the selection of restaurants the embarcadero offers and after stopping and reading each menu along the embarcadero the restaurants had presented, this place as well as there menu, happened to strick the most interest.  Ambiance and decor of this restaurant is very modern, ultra, chic- with a very cool dark earth tone color scheme throughout offering some extremely interesting high tech metal chandler's and art d\u00e9cor throughout the rest of the restaurant- the layout is spacious, the bar is gorgeous and the views are nice. The only thing that through off the decor of the overall restaurant was the bamboo wall divider separating the kitchen and the rest of the restaurant, just looked slightly sloppy (just me) but overall very cool.  We got a nice seat by the window unfortunately, with our backs facing the window but still a nice table with views of the restaurant.  They have an interesting menu with a nice selection of appealing dishes to choose from- some basics such as burgers and sandwiches, as well as some specialty dishes. The also have an nice selection of temtacious cocktails to choose from so while waiting for our food, I decided to indulge in the white sake sangria which is 9 gekkeikan sake, skyy berry vodka, acai juice- this drink arrived delicious looking filled with a mixture of berries and tasted absolutely fan tab!  I was in carnivore protein mode so, I ordered the House Ground American Kobe Beef Burger (with out the bun for me and which usually comes with fries) however, I opted for a salad with a side dressing of some sort of special ginger dressing. My babe ordered Grilled Chicken Salad Club 12-Avocado, Swiss cheese, Bacon, Steak Fries.  You are given a bowl of incredibly tasty Seasoned Edamame \u00a0included with lunch which was a perfect light option before our meal.  Our meals arrived shortly after finishing our edamame. My burger arrived nice juicy and appealing (smaller in size) though, tasted incredible and the quality of the meat was definitly a notice. The salad on the side was slightly scarse and could have used some more ruffage though, the dressing it was accompanied with was absolutely creamy and delcisous.  The one thing I did not care for was the little bowl filled with salt for use. Sorry, who knows if people dip there fingers in it or what not and guess I just prefer the even spread from a regular salt and pepper shaker.  Overall, it's an incredibly cool place to dine in and really would look forward to coming back again perhaps in the evening.",

Duck confit spring rolls: i think it came with six rolls, and was served with mustard/honey sauce. Very tasty  Clams &amp; mussels: served in a big bowl, with a type of thai (coconut/curry type) broth/sauce. Served with bruschetta, to sop up the broth. This was also very nice, although the large serving bowl made the amount of shellfish seem a bit small.  Filet mignon (bleu-cheese crust): served with mashed potatoes, and small vegetables (baby carrots, turnips, etc). The meat was cooked to my order of medium rare, and overall it was a solid dish. For an entree, portion was slightly small. Make sure to order an appetizer or salad to complement your entree, as you may not be filled with just the entree alone.  Service was great - waitstaff came frequently, to make sure I was doing ok, enjoying my meal, and to fill my water. They also brought me edamame to begin my meal, to snack on while I was waiting for my apps.  Total cost of my meal was $60, before tax/tip.

Ambiance: \u00a0There weren't that many people there. \u00a0The restaurant is on the water and the view is nice. \u00a0I am knocking 1 star off because I didn't really like the decor. \u00a0I don't know how to describe it exactly. \u00a0It was like a mixture of Japan and the 80s and it came out rather cold and strange.  Food: I had the American Kobe Beef Burger and she had a delicious red snapper dish. \u00a0The complimentary edamame at the beginning was to die for (had black and white sesame seeds and a special orange/red salt) and the delicious Caesar salad we split had the most delectable croutons. \u00a0We had banana bread pudding for dessert with vanilla ice cream and macadamia nut brittle. \u00a0Everything tasted spectacular!   A plus: they have an ATM machine on site!",

Ordered the fried Thai Snapper $36, the fish was crispy, moist and very tasty, goes great with the fresh prepared kim chi, however the ho fun noodles that came with it was awful. My bf had the new york steak $32 it was good too. Well seasoned, and cooked perfectly, however all the sides that came with it was not good. Overall, the food took over an hour to come out. We go there at 8:30pm and didnt get our food till almost 10pm. The waiter was not that attentive, never check in with us to update us on what's going on in the kitchen or give us something to snack on while we waited and waited for our entree. With good food, you still want to ensure your customers leaves happy and not disappointed.",

My noodles were just ok.....until I reached across table and grabbed the miso/soy dressing that came with the vegetarian sandwich.

Granted, the second I walked in I was instantly seduced by the sea urchin-inspired lamps and amazing mirrors (side note: great view of the bay). Needless to say, I was slightly confused as to why this place wasn't more packed...   For dinner we ordered the calamari appetizer (yummy!) and my bf got the halibut in cream sauce and I the surf 'n turf. The steak was my favorite part but I could have done without the scallops and shrimp as they weren't done to my liking (ie lacked flavor and overall juiciness). The whole mix of beef and seafood was placed atop a bed of fried asian noodles and topped with a delicious mache salad. It came with a \"veal reduction\" that looked more like soy broth with green onions so I opted to not pour it all over my meal (although in retrospect maybe I should have).  Anyway, I'm rambling. But my martini (cherry blossom) was soooooo tasty I want to go back to this place and get drunk at the bar! (And ok fine I also want to go back when I'm not grumpy - that's always a downer!)",

We also were given the edamame appetizer for free which was really yummy with sesame seeds and salt- and we finished with creme brulee which was also tasty. I liked that the creme brulee was in a wider, flatter dish- more burnt sugar area- and we all know that the burnt sugar is the best part!

We told our waitress that we were in a little of a rush because we needed to catch the boat and she was fabulous. We were going to split two hamburgers but saw there was a $3 service charge for each item split so my sister opted to get the chicken salad sandwich.  While waiting for our entree, we were brought some delicious peanuty edamame while we waited for our entrees. The hamburgers were $18 and were delicious - the only complaint I had was the burger was slightly greasy and it appeared that they put a Kraft singles slice of cheese on top. The flavor of the meat and bun was to die for and I love how people in California put butter lettuce on everything.   I do have to say again - California's portions are way smaller than Louisiana's.",

    "review_text": "Good happy hour specials! Though they tend to give you the oh, is that all you want look pretty frequently. (It might be becuase we were planning on hitting up three other places that night and didn't order that much) They are very much an asian fusion restaurant with a beautiful view. As others have noted, some of their foods have a bit of an identity crisis.   Their salmon and strawberry spring roll would be one such dish. Smoked salmon, vermicelli, strawberries, lettuce and cilantro are all wrapped in a really dry spring roll wrap. The flavors don't exactly seem to compliment each other, but aren't terrible offensive either. I don't think the spring rolls are a good choice becuase the dry skins probably mean that they have been sitting there for a long while. .   On the other hand, the Kahlua pork with buttercup lettuce cups and hoisin sauce was pretty good. Really flavorful and good. Though be careful, the pork will drip juice!  They also had a $5 chardonnay for happy hour which was not bad.   For $5 for each appetizer option, it's not a bad place to go to relax. But if you don't like fusion, stay well away.   Random note: guys bathroom is very dark. women's is very light. . . It's really embarrassing when you make assumptions about bathroom locations and go into the wrong door. .   I also agree with the person who commented about the getting money and making food without washing hands person in that I feel like Butterfly staff need to be a little more careful. I saw a waitress totally drop a credit card on the floor and she didn't notice until another waiter picked it up and handed it to her.",

We had the kumquat margarita, cherry blossom and lychee martini and they were all great. At the end when we were about to leave the chef came out and asked us what we thought. I told him everything was sooo good especially the edamame. I also told him mentioned that my bf practically licked the bowl clean and the chef replied, \"Yeah, I saw that!\" LOL My bf was a bit embarrassed but at least it was a compliment to the chef.

We went through opentable to make the reservation, and the day of our dinner I got a call just confirming the dinner. Pretty cool... though it was probably so that they could check if they were getting stiffed or not on the reservation. I still thought it was nice of them though. We asked for a table by the windows facing the water, which they did give us - it was one of the tables with the little couch which was ok... however I'm 6'3\" and have giraffe legs... I didn't fit so well sitting with my legs under the little table. I was kind of hoping for a normal table, but eh. The Girlfriend enjoyed the snuggle couch, so that's really what matters, right? My aching legs took one for the team that night! Now comes the appetizers... the vodka and tequila shooters are really good... but be careful of the pricing! The menu says \"shooter - 4 bucks\" \"Vodka shooter -5 bucks.\" This doesn't mean that the vodka shooter is five bucks as I naively thought. It means that the shooter AND the vodka is 9 bucks. Something to watch for next time! We then got a bottle of the Fappiano (I know my spelling is bad!) petit shiraz, and oh boy was it good! It went really well with the Duck (for me) and the Scallops (for The Girlfriend), which were both really really tasty! I've never had Duck before, and when I was ordering I was thinking back to the movie \"LA Story\" Where Steve Martin tries to order the Duck and the snooty waiter says \"He cahn't have the duck!\" and I was getting nervous that the waitress here was going to say that I can't have the duck... but then she asked how I wanted it cooked and I knew I was safe. Whew!  So After the duck and the scallops and the shooters and the wine... we go for dessert! Hey, Anniversaries only come once a year, right? It's ok to splurge sometimes! I have to say... try the cookie! They have this cookie that they make in a little skillet that has ice cream on top of it... so very good! I didn't really want to share it with The Girlfriend, but I kind of had to. We also got the Creme Brulee, which again, was nicely done and really tasty. All in all, we left there fat and happy(well, I was feeling fat and happy. The Girlfriend of course was feeling thin and happy) and it was a pretty good night!",

    "review_text": "straight up the food is 3 stars but this place get an extra star for location, decor and excellent service.  Having read the review and talked to folks we went there and decided to stick with the \"appetizers\". Most of them range from 9-14 dollars and for that price you expect some filling food and they delivered that.  We started with the salmon and strawberry spring rolls which were large and tasted wonderful. The sweetness of the strawberries was cut by the spicy and tang of the nuac mong sauce and the salmon was complimented by them both.   We then had the 1/2 dozen oysters with two dipping sauces, one a spicy Asian sauce and the other a more traditional \u00a0champagne based sauce. there was also a bloody Mary oyster shooter. While I know the beausoliel oyster do tend to be small and sweet, these were on the smaller size and I felt disappointed that they didn't pick larger oysters. The sauces were spot-on and brought out the sweetness and richness of the oysters.   Our third dish was a huge bowl of noodles that were coated in a lovely sauce and tossed with lots of small bites of veggies. This could have easily been a entree based on the size and how filling it was.  The final dish we had was the clam and mussels in tangy creamy Thai coconut curry sauce. The sauce again was wonderful and we enjoyed dipping the bread in it as much as eating the clams and mussels. There was a good serving of clam and mussels and again the portions were those of an entree not an appetizer. However the clams and the mussels were tiny and not at all what I would expect at an upscale restaurant on the west coast.  We ended our meal with two iced Vietnamese coffees and the banana bread pudding which was a wonder sweet but solid ending. It was served with coconut ice cream, two caramelized banana pieces and a \u00a0homemade nut brittle. All the components worked great together to create a subtle and rich dessert.  our meal came to around 70 dollars without tip or drinks.  Now on the decor, location and service. We went on a Monday night at 8:30 and had no problem scoring a window seat with a great view of the bay. The lighting was bright enough that my wife could read the menu, the noise level was low enough so we could enjoy our conversation and the servers were friendly and helpful without any attitude or intrusiveness.   This is a great place to take a date or out of town guests. I plan on going back and trying other things on the menu.",

    "review_text": "Came here with no expectations and a BloomSpot voucher for $30 worth $60 of food and left with a satisfied, full belly.  First, our cocktails: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2Fs-xR4lFul3WQGbhEIf67vg%2Fl.jpg&amp;s=d80b6a3392e80599499466692558afa2e3446fec103d27e338b86d83a9ed4fc4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026</a> The Sumojito is a great idea! I think all cocktails should come in at least a one pint size! Also stole a sip of the Lycheetini and it tastes very good. It's hard to make a lychee drink taste bad. Could use more liquor in both though ;)  Next, the Duck Confit Springrolls: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FK9nQDCO7oIF0oR3p6_Y21Q%2Fl.jpg&amp;s=162d94103831e47165793b497966fdb1619911487711d659c03395d802b07a4d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026</a> I was expecting fresh spring rolls and not deep fried ones. This resembled Chinese fried egg rolls. I couldn't really taste the duck, but it tasted good nonetheless. The dipping sauce tasted like it had wasabi in it. I approve.  My entree, the Grilled Hangar Steak \"Kalbi Style\": <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2F8SYqC-BfpU1gdunkLWHBVA%2Fl.jpg&amp;s=19c2f6c0fdfcaf1596bc5ceb03b78d7f28f4e29e941c9ee571b2292b3cc4af1d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026</a> I believe hangar steak is a less fatty, more tough cut of beef, but I could be wrong. If it is, they did a wonderful job with this hangar steak. It was a bit chewy, but had tons of flavor and was still tender. I really loved the rice cakes as they were chewy and sweet and salty, especially paired with the bacon :) The peas and carrots though? Meh. That's more for color so the whole plate doesn't look brown lol  My lady friend's entree, the Sesame Crusted Tombo Tuna: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2Fcs55-121KhJchA5vMDG07Q%2Fl.jpg&amp;s=568a244b649cfcb4768ea9cd8b4313b7abf62e5cfa47911d2e93db097b8d885f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026</a> What's a Tombo tuna? No idea. But the tuna tasted very fresh and meaty. I only got a little taste and it was good! The shrimp stuffed mushrooms had sesame seeds roasted on top of it and the avocado chunks with the tuna gave it a very sushi feel. It was all very good. Didn't get to try the pepper, but Joy said it was bitter and tasty.  Now that I've tried this place with a coupon, I can say I would come back here again even without the coupon. The only thing I would change is the lighting. A little too dark for me. After finishing the meal, I wanted to sit back in one of their group seating with the plush cushions and go to sleep ;)",

The hostess saved a cozy table for us which looks out directly at the water and is a bit secluded from the main part of the restaurant: major points for the ambiance and setting. She also recommended the kumquat margarita when I asked--deliciosa, but don't guzzle it down: it will sneak up on you.  Our waiter, Porter, really made our evening special. He was knowledgeable about the menu, efficient and simply charming. He didn't mind our numerous questions and we made our meal selection based on his recommendations. The whole fried fish was artfully prepared and so tasty. I wish we could have tried the soft shell crab, but that will have to wait for our next visit. The chef, Rob, has a creative touch in addition to his culinary skills, and Porter suggested that he doesn't do the same thing over and over--he mixes it up and keeps things fresh. We will be back for sure!",

We sat by the DJ booth - very spacious set-up. \u00a0  So begins my quest for soft foods in restaurants! I ordered the two softest items on the menu - at least by description. The waitress wasn't very helpful; she kept telling me how everything was good whenever I pointed at something on the menu inquiring about how SOFT it was. Well, thanks, but I just need to find whatever is soft enough. Where are your listening ears, lady? Maybe she couldn't really hear me because the music was so loud.  Seasoned Edamame - This came as a free appetizer, but was a little too tough on the teeth for me. Flavors were good, but after trying one, not again. OUCH!  Caramelized Maui Onion Soup - If my teeth were working, I would be able to gnaw through all that cheese. Very cheesy and flavorful. I really enjoyed this one, but it took forever to eat. \u00a0  Risotto (not on the menu online, so I don't have the exact name) - it came with some garlic/tomato mini pizza, which was crispy and delicious. I had to cut them up into small pieces and eat like a toddler, but they were great. The risotto was a little heavy on some sort of foam. \u00a0Pretty to look at because it looked like a latte. Delicious, but heavy, so I couldn't finish it. Especially not after eating the soup beforehand.  My friends enjoyed the: Pan Fried Shanghai Noodles, House Smoked Salmon and Strawberry Rolls, the Ahi Tuna [again, no official name - my friend LOVED this one. She ordered it almost rare.]. I didn't hear any complaints on the food, so I'm guessing everything was okay.  Water was constantly refilled. They let us take our time. We ended up being the last table in the place, and they didn't even rush us to leave.",

I wish I had looked a little more carefully when I had so casually booked that 1000 point open table reservation for Sunday evening. Not worth the $20 in Opentable rewards I'm getting...  The lamb was the only good entree, and it wasn't anything special. I would've given 4 stars for this alone even though it was $38, but then I tried the other dishes...The macadamia blue cheese rubbed fillet was tolerable and the salmon was completely tasteless.   The best part of the meal was the puff pastry on top of my shrimp bisque (I'm guessing that was store bought), and the warm chocolate cake (pre-purchased) served with a delicious side of Mitchell's coffee ice cream (which is also obviously pre-purchased). Notice a pattern?  I feel kinda terrible giving two stars because the view was amazing and the hosts were so friendly, but the waitress was painfully slow and forgetful and the food was overpriced and mediocre (at best). Our waitress would turn towards   Come to think about it, besides the edamame appetizer I don't recall any Asian influence in my meal... for good Asian Fusion I'd recommend Ana Mandara. So 1 stars for a $50 meal that was extremely unoutstanding, and an extra star for the friendly hosts and the gorgeous venue.",

My \u00a0hubby and I ordered a cowboy steak with chirizo and sizzling veggies. The steak was huge weighing in at about 22oz! It was just enough for my husband and I to share. The lychee martini was just ok, a little bit too strong of an alcohol taste. Had had much better elsewhere.

For the entree we go the braised short ribs which I really love because the meat was sooo soft it almost melts in your mouth. Then to finish the night off, we had the banana bread, which of course, I wouldn't mind going back and getting again \u00a0It was really a good meal, I couldn't ask for more.  Food portion: The portion were perfect, it wasn't a lot, wasn't too little.  Service: On top of the awesome food, the service was really really good! Servers and the staffs were really professional and courteous.  Place: I am impressed by the layout... Only downside is its a little bit too dark. Other than that, the ocean view was pretty as it reflects the lights from the islands \u00a0Very romantic...",

Ended up at Butterfly after schlepping over to Alcatraz for the umpteenth time, this time so my husband's parents could enjoy its dank cells and crumbling concrete. \u00a0We picked Butterfly because it was *rightthere*, and the price was reasonable for the ultra-premium-high-end-cost-but-the-food-still-\u00adsucks quarter of Pier 39.  Interior is gorgeous, the view can't be beat.

Our friend, Marie, knows the chef, but unfortunately, he wasn't there that evening. Even so, everything, including the service, was excellent.   Unlike the server the previous evening, our server at Butterfly poured the wine in the correct order: ladies first. Sheri scored the meal of the evening with the Pork Chop that tasted more like pork belly. I had the duck breast and it was prepared perfectly. Our friends ordered the Kalua Pig Wraps and, again, it was delicious.   The wine list was adequate and ordered a bottle of white to go along with the bottle of red that I brought. It was a pleasant surprise at the end of the evening to notice that they waived the corkage since we bought a bottle.   Good food, great service, great location. Why can't more restaurants be like this?",

Service was slow. \u00a0I think I asked for my iced tea at least 3 times before I actually received it, and my friend also had to ask for a refill on her coke. \u00a0They serve these awesome edamame dipped in what tastes like sesame oil, sesame seeds, sea salt &amp; pepper. \u00a0Really delicious, and you can ask for more. \u00a0  I had the Fried Red Snapper Sandwich - Toasted Sweet French Baguette, Spicy Chili and Garlic Rouille, Pickled Onions and Cucumbers (also came with french fries)   The sandwich was HUGE, and it was delicious. I finished every last bite. \u00a0The fish was fresh &amp; juicy, the breading was light and not too thick. \u00a0  My girlfriend ordered the Sashimi Trio Salad 16 - Hamachi, Ahi Tuna, and Salmon with Avocado, Shiso and Teriyaki Glazed Eel.   The ahi was very tender &amp; fresh, i didn't really taste much of hamachi or salmon to tell you the truth...and there was this weird black pasty thing that tasted like beans that really ruined the dish for her (and me too when i tasted it!)   2 other friends both ordered the American Kobe Beef Burger 14 - Carmelized Onion and Bacon Jam with Cabot New York Aged Cheddar, Norm's \"Special Sauce\" and Fries  They both said their burgers were made just right and were delicious. Juicy &amp; they looked big too.   Oh. and a warning, refills on soda is NOT free. They will charge you full price for another soda. Lame.",

It's beautiful and it has amazing views with giant picture windows.   Apart from that, the food is incredible, and - most importantly - it's consistently good. The drinks are always great, and they have a happy hour cocktail that rotates out (always interesting). However, my favorites are the gin gimlet and the lycheetini [sp]. In terms of food, I highly recommend the fried squash (fresh buratta - so amazing!), and the duck confit rolls, as well as the garlic noodles.   But it's not just about the views and the food. The service is beyond compare. I have never been there when I haven't been treated well. One server in particular deserves mention - Porter.

Situated at Pier 33 of the Embarcadero, Butterfly offers nouveau-avante-garde (I made that up) fusion cuisine that exhibits subtle Vietnamese nuances. Me likes.  I've had the luxury of trying nearly everything on the menu here so I urge you to be like sheep and follow my instructions on what to order.  You're gonna want to start off with the Kalua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups which is fun, playful and delicious. Interactive dishes are always a suitable icebreaker when taking body shots of hennesey isn't an option. Do not however forget to order the Garlic Seared Clams &amp; Mussels. I swear even the sea-creatures prefer to be dead in this broth than alive in the ocean. Go ahead and suck up whatever remaining broth you have with a straw, everyone will understand.  Moving right along, I always order the cowboy ribeye which is sufficient eating for two. I don't know if they still have this on the menu but insist on it vehemently and you will not be disappointed. \u00a0The cut is magnificent and Butterfly consistently delivers a tender, perfectly cooked steak. There's something absolutely primal about it and it makes me happy that I'm a meatatarian. \u00a0Pair this with a hearty beer like a Chimay or a full bodied red like a Napa cab and rejoice that you are in the land of the living.  I don't pretend to know a lot about food but I know what makes my toes curl with sheer bliss.

(assuming the server was telling the truth) \u00a0 I normally tip 20-25% and any time a restaurant automatically adds a tip it really makes me angry so I NEVER tip more or go back to that restaurant.

Luckily, my boyfriend at the time and I were just grazed by the stray bullet, but it put a damper on my love of the place (though now I go to Levende, which has taken up residence in same said gang territory). \n  At any rate, I finally went to Butterfly's new digs on the Embarcadero last night but, like Slanted Door, it left me missing the shabbyish but cozier old Mission days. \u00a0\n  The pluses: Sunny, the bartender, was professional and fun despite the behavior of my rowdy compatriots and our inability to make a damn wine decision. Ross, our waiter, was also a champ. He was patient whilst five people shouted conflicting appetizer and entree orders and he still managed to bring them out at the same time and keep his sense of humor. \n  The drawbacks: I remember the wine selection at the old Butterfly to be pretty expansive, whereas last night, it was limited. I learned that the restaurant owners are associated with Reverie Winery, so we tried their reserve and regular cabs and found them wholly uninteresting. Since it's a pan-Asian restaurant, I thought we could go sake instead, but they only had three choices by the bottle! The sake cocktail list was much longer, but it seemed incongruous to have an Asian-themed menu with such an amateur sake selection. \n  We ended up ordering pretty much every appetizer and a few entrees to share. I can highly recommend the kalua pig with butter lettuce cups (so random but so good), the clams &amp; mussels, and the oysters with bloody mary shots (why didn't I think of that?!). I don't eat fried food, but others said the duck confit rolls and the calamari were great. The entrees we tried (the chicken and the scallops) were only ok; the sauces were too rich in a cheap, overly sweet sort of way. I know it's not their job to serve healthy food necessarily, but many dishes looked and tasted like poor-quality, slimy chinese food. \n  The view is of course great, but strangely, most tables aren't set up to take advantage of it. It was fun for a rowdy work dinner, but there are certainly other places I'd take clients or friends first. \n  A final plus is that at least I didn't have to dodge any bullets this time....",

I recall seeing a kobe burger on the menu outside and I made it a must stop for me while I was in San Francisco. I'm glad I did.   The edamame had a nice spin to it with sesame oil and sesame seeds instead of the traditional sprinkle oif sea salt. Very nice touch. The salmon with strawberry spring roll was ok. I'm not a fan of spring rolls but the combination was nice. The Kobe burger didn't do much for me it was an item to check off my list!  I would stop in again if I'm ever in the area!",

The food was pretty good, for appetizers we had the kahula pig wraps, calamari and oysters, for dinner 2 of us had the salmon and the other 2 had the filet mignon (such variety!!). delish. \u00a0 The wait staff was very friendly and not bothersome at all, and the managerial staff was very accommodating.

For approximately 100 dollars, I dined on an amazing fried rice appetizer with a lycheetini (which wasn't as good as I thought but it did taste like a lychee).   The grease-ridden Sizzlin' Cowboy Steak lived up to its name. As if having a lot of oil wasn't enough, it was topped with Fois Gras butter...wow...my coronaries just took one for the team.  The chicken roulade was excellent as well.  Okay so this place is overpriced - but you're paying for the location, view and acting like a tourist (sorry if you truly are a tourist).  Would I go again? Probably not on a whim but for a 1000 dollar table, maybe. The sad thing is, my RSVP was 10 minutes too late for a 1000 dollar table and I only got 100 points...doh.",

The duck spring rolls came with chinese mustard dipping sauce which was a little different than what I'm normally used to. The salmon carpaccio tasted like smoked salmon rather than raw. Correct me if I'm wrong but carpaccio does mean raw right? Nonetheless, it was delicious.  Next was the hanger steak and grilled snapper. The hanger steak was flavorful and what was even better were the mushrooms on that plate. The steak was tough but taste wise was sufficient. The snapper was neat. It was served like vietnamese egg rolls. It had wrapping lettuce, nuoc mam, and vermicelli to compliment the fish. The smell of the fish was incredible when it comes out on its own sizzling platter.  For dessert, my dining mate and I went for both choices from the dat menu. The torte was awesome. The creme brulee .... typical creme \u00a0brulee.  I'd give Butterfly 5 stars if they had used a more tender beef for their steak. It was too tough for my liking.",

Server informed us that entree was removed from the menu almost a month ago - guess no one bothered to update the website.  - Service (although polite) was on the slow side. Had to rush out and catch a cab back to the office, instead of enjoying a post-meal walk.  - Coworker requested that her leftover food be packaged to go - never saw it again.  - $10 Cherry Blossom martini was disappointing...I'd only purchase again during happy hour, at a discount.   It was nice to finally give this place a try, but it's definitely too pricey to fit into the regular rotation. I'd consider coming back for happy hour or a special occasion.",

I warm her over with my boyish charm and good looks and a few good jokes. \u00a0 The appetizers were a little prices but well worth it. I got this salmon spring roll or lettuce roll with with strawberries and it was actually good. The Ahi Tempura was like a meal rather than a appetizer. \u00a0The was a little gummy like it was over cooked but maybe it was supposed to be like that.  I was a little undecided for my main course; the fish or the chicken. Fried and tasty or baked and yummy. Well you know how black folks love chicken so I had the baked chicken. \u00a0This baked chicken was the best I had in a while. I can normally re-create a dish after having it once but this chicken I may have to try 3 or 4 times before I can try and make it my self. \u00a0I got give this place 4 stars because I left full and very happy",

You walk in to the place and the whole back of the restaurant is a window in to The Bay and on a clear day it's beautiful. That seques very nicely in to the ambience. The decor of Butterfly is creative and fun but not overbearing. There's lots of light that comes in and this place is perfect for both a date and a business lunch. You can't go wrong with ambience.  The food was definitely top notch and I had no complaints about my Seared Ahi Tuna (which came with a very interesting array of vegetables). Even though I've had a bit of a falling out with vegetables in recent years (read: my whole life), these were delicious and I ate nearly every bit of it.   And last, but definitively not least, the cocktails were tasty and yet still strong enough to not disappoint the alcoholic in all of us.  I recommend it.",

Plus they have 3 vegan options and many vegetarian options on the menu for picky eaters like me.

We cleaned off every plate. Then we got our entrees- I got the short ribs vegan style i.e. with tofu and it was both filling and tasty.

Im sure it was a years supply of cholesterol but If im gonna die, \u00a0I want this in my casket with me. Mu friend the short ribs which were fall off the bone tender.

It kicked my ass, my nose, and my brain. The wasabi feel from a yellow concoction. This is about all that was good, except for the jokes from my comedian and slightly buzzed girlfriend (from ONE and a half glasses of wine! lightweight). Next was the hanger steak with potato-leek gratin. Cold, too bloody, and too chewy, and the jus de veau was \"weak...sauce.\" Snow peas were good and the portobello shrooms it came with prompted the aforementioned gf to sing to the tune of Incubus' \"Earth to Bella,\" but instead with the lyric \"PORT-A-BELLO,\" earning joke of the night status. The potato-leek gratin was piping hot and burned my mouth, but the layer of cheese on top was sustaining. I finished off the meal with Creme Brulee with strawberries and raspberry on top. The fruits were rather bitter and the creme was 'bruleed\" a little too long.   The wine &amp; cocktail menu was quite extensive, thats why i bumped it up one star.

My girlfriends and I came here for brunch today and we were about ~30 minutes late for our reservations due to traffic (49ers vs Raiders). The host, I believe her name was Christine, was nothing but accommodating once we got there. The bartender, Trevor, was also very friendly.  We were seated at a table tucked away behind the bar by the window. The view was gorgeous and the area was semi-private. Our server, Ross, was phenomenal. He was attentive, friendly, didn't rush us, and just an overall great guy.  I can't remember everything we ordered but here are my recommendations: duck confit spring roll (it's fried), french onion soup (which was not sweet at all and it had applewood bacon), shanghai garlic noodles (toasted garlic = delicious), sizzling snapper (served with chilled noodles, nuoc mam/fish sauce, and butter lettuce wraps), and the vanilla bean creme brulee. Although I didn't try the oysters (gross,no thanks), my friends RAVED about the 1/2 dozen oyster shooters. They ordered 2 because it was so good.  Oh did I mention that they have bottomless mimosas for $18! Ross kept topping us off! I'm not going to share how many I had but let me just say it's worth it!  I would definitely recommend this place for a date, with your girlfriends, with your family, whomever! I can't wait to go back!!!!!",

    "review_text": "We made reservations for three on Saturday for dinner and was told the only space available was 4pm or 9:30. The maitre'd said they were fully booked, not even 4:30 was available. When we showed up at 4:10, delayed by road closures, we were seated promptly. Note 1 - the place was empty except for 3 tables and 2 customers at the bar.  We ordered 1 appetizer - shanghai garlic noodles and 3 entrees - sesame seared ahi tuna, Peking ducks breast and flank steak. The noodles arrived within 10 minutes, and were simply cooked yet very flavorful and done just right- not too soft and not too Al dente. Then comes the super long wait for the entrees - 45 minutes later, still no entree. Finally they showed up. Note 2- the food was cold. Ahi tuna was bland, the flank steak had good flavor, but it had texture like rubber, even though we ordered medium, the insides were pretty much rare. The duck was well flavored as well, but it was obvious the dish had been sitting for a while before being brought to the table. Both the flank steak and duck would have been much better if served warm.   By this time it was close to 5:30 PM, and the place was just about 20% filled. We finished 'dinner' at about 6 PM and walked out at 6:15 after paying. The place was maybe 25% filled, just about 7-8 tables were occupied. It's aggravating to know our party have been falsely lead to believe that they were fully booked when it was obvious that was not the truth! For the life of me,I can not understand why they would not take the reservation of 6:30 PM as requested.   Bottom line - food was served cold even though it was flavorful, I would give it 2 stars. Reservation service is the pits for lying, it deserves no stars at all.   It's too bad because I recall dining there a few years back and it was a wonderful experience. The restaurant has regressed since. Not even worth the effort of finding parking, which was tough as well since they don't offer valet.",

Appetizers were a win too - especially the Vietnamese Caramelized Chicken Wings!! \u00a0Wild Mushroom Cappuccino Soup was tasty - not too rich. \u00a0Crispy Fried Calamari was good and not over battered or greasy. Kalua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups were like sweet pulled pork - very tasty. \u00a0Shiso Cured Albacore Sashimi was good, but small portion... especially since i wanted more of the yummy Soy Poached Foie Gras! \u00a0we sent the Garlic Seared Mussels back - maybe not the right season for them but it seemed off. \u00a0  Among the table, we tried most of the entrees... but only one standout rose above the others. \u00a0The Sizzling Cowboy Steak was *so good* on a bed of Chorizo and Jalapenos... (unfortunately we forgot to get the leftovers!) \u00a0 The Duck and Short Ribs entrees were better than the whole fish.

The long: I know I have a strong bias against Asian Fusion cuisine but I always try to give it a chance, considering that Asian Fusion has created some great additions to gastronomy: Portuguese egg tarts, black pepper sauce teppan steak (Taiwanese style), Omu-raisu, Chinese chicken salad, Japanese beef curry udon... but, Butterfly, you DISAPPOINTED me by revealing that once again Asian Fusion is some throwaway term to refer to overly priced food too lazy to be truly innovative, but instead enticing the naive with the mystique associated the exotic name of \"Fusion\". I could have thrown my crap-tastic flavorless watery egg scramble stuffed with limp salmon and a jalapeno pepper halve that I swear was thrown in last minute because it was still slightly raw and obviously has no flavor contribution having been introduced so late in the cooking process. Then, to top it off and to complete what I can only assume is a half-ass check-off list for what qualifies as \"Fusion\", they sprinkled the dish with some flying fish roe. Really, did you really think that would SAVE the dish!? It didn't, it only reinforced memories of my scrappier eating days in college, when there was no Asian food around and I hashed together what preserved Asian condiments and cheap American ingredients I could find to sauce up some survival meal to fuel me for hours of dreaded studying. Seriously, no wonder this needed to be listed on DAT; they need as much short-term attention they can get. 2 out of 3 of the appetizers were great ideas but talk about failure in execution. Salmon carpaccio? I didn't know carpaccion meant THICK ASS slices of pre-packaged lox that was still pretty stiff and cold from refrigeration. And, how on earth were you supposed to eat it with the weird tater cream and greasy cold chip? Ugh. Oh, and don't get me started on the duck confit egg rolls... dry, hardly tasted like duck anymore, and it was accompanied by a dipping sauce that was like cough syrup mixed with a powdered mustard. The calamari I confess was pretty good, but it was nothing new, nothing memorable, not a strong enough point to justify Butterfly; it's nothing I would crave given the number of restaurants that have the dish on its menu. ...And main course? Wow. I mean wow, that was awful. I already digressed on the wrongs with the salmon scramble fiasco but... wow, I didn't know they could all be so... mediocre. Probably the only one that had a truly positive review was the club sandwich. After a dismal main course the DAT meal was slightly redeemed by desserts. Great molten lava cake and creme brulee, but again like the calamari, how normal! How uninventive! They were examples of what the dish should be, and didn't attempt to raise the bar beyond standard. Was not impressed.  My last gripe was the time... it took nearly an hour between each course for the dishes to be prepared and served, which is ridiculous especially for lunch. The wait staff was very nice and I did enjoy my time at the restaurant bar but in my mind: I will never come here again.",

Nice upbeat atmosphere. We were leaving to watch the fireworks after our entrees and the waiter invited us to watch them from the patio, which was awesome! We stayed on at the restaurant bar after the fireworks and sampled some of the yummy cocktails. It was a lovely experience overall!!",

    "review_text": "Not much for \"touristy\" type of restaurant, but that's about all you can get on the embarcadero, and my girlfriend and I were starving, it was 1 PM and we hadn't ate yet!   So, it was a Sunday afternoon, and Butterfly was serving from the Brunch Menu. \u00a0It was fairly empty when we went into the restaurant, and the Host/Manager asked if we had reservations. \u00a0We chuckled, and said \"no\" and he seated us facing the water, but in a table in the center of the place. \u00a0The view was \u00a0awesome with it being a clear day in the city.  As for the food:  Calamari Appetizer - nice light breading with a pickled chili - type sauce. \u00a0Very tasty, a bit salty.  Poached eggs with Smoked Salmon - Very Salty with non-descript hollandaise sauce. \u00a0Fresh tropical fruit Salad side. Poached eggs with Kahlua Pig - A little dry, nice smoky flavor, same hollandaise sauce and fruit salad.  The service was relatively slow, and again, it was not that busy. \u00a0Our appetizer came out quick, but probably about 20 minutes after they took away that before our entree. \u00a0  So, all in all, better than expected. \u00a0Prices reasonable for the area. \u00a0Willing to give it a try maybe for some drinks and more appetizers, not quite ready to come back and try dinner.",

    "review_text": "For years now, even before I started Yelping, Butterfly has been on my list of places to try. \u00a0However, like with so many other restaurants on my list, I've never gotten around to trying them since I've never had the impetus to go. \u00a0That is, until just recently; nothing gets a Yelper motivated like an expiring Living Social deal! \u00a0And the promise of free food... ;)  As soon as I walked in, three things immediately leapt out at me - the huge bar, the windows looking out onto the bay, and the d\u00e9cor, which felt a little kitsch (for the lack of a better word) but gave the restaurant a casual, relaxed vibe. \u00a0Since my friend and I both wanted to try a few things, we decided to get several dishes to share:  -- SAILOR'S PUNCH - Ron Zacapa's Rum, Shishito Pepper, Lime, Agave Nectar...$10 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfly-san-francisco?select=lSejw8V4t5J9kNEBPMpvCA#0TuNdI0wc7T7IebNf42_fw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/butt\u2026</a>) I've been drinking more whiskey-based cocktails as of late, but this did a good job of satisfying my craving for something fruity. \u00a0While the first sip was pretty tart, it finshed quite refreshing   -- WILD MUSHROOM CAPPUCCINO SOUP with Truffle Foam, and Porcini Powder...$9 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfly-san-francisco?select=lSejw8V4t5J9kNEBPMpvCA#t3GUDHnT-jGIOFIr_bGOnA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/butt\u2026</a>) On the one hand, I liked the earthy, mushroom flavors and how well it blended with the truffle foam. \u00a0On the other hand, the soup was really, really salty. \u00a0Either they were heavy handed with the seasoning or it reduced down too much in the pot.  -- GARLIC SEARED CLAMS &amp; MUSSELS in a Lemongrass and Coconut Curry Broth with Cilantro and Fried Rice...$14 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfly-san-francisco?select=lSejw8V4t5J9kNEBPMpvCA#G3L4X8Uk3uD7qRQYd69m6A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/butt\u2026</a>) The broth was really flavorful and both the clams and mussels were terrific. \u00a0However, while the rice added some crunch, slices of crusty/toasted bread would have been better. \u00a0It didn't help either that the $1 per bread roll we ordered were tasteless and barely larger than a golf ball. \u00a0Ugh.  -- SWEET MISO ROASTED COD with Shrimp Shu Mai Dumplings, Miso Dashi Broth, XO Shrimp and Chili Sauce...$28 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfly-san-francisco?select=lSejw8V4t5J9kNEBPMpvCA#37G6I2aPG0i1Ng6M4Wd0lg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/butt\u2026</a>) Of the two entr\u00e9es, I thought this one was better. \u00a0The cod was feathery and moist, and the miso worked well with the dashi broth. \u00a0The shu mais were pretty good as well - plump and tasty, though I thought the lemongrass was a bit too assertive.  -- FIVE SPICE BRAISED ENGLISH SHORT RIBS with Butternut Squash, Scallion, and Pumpkin Seed Relish on Sizzling Rice Cakes...$26 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfly-san-francisco?select=lSejw8V4t5J9kNEBPMpvCA#WE6UEcHT75EPyOMAufCRnA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/butt\u2026</a>) The flavors weren't bad, but not exactly compelling. \u00a0In short, the short ribs didn't taste any different than versions I've had in the past, and while the meat was tender, it was also a bit dry. \u00a0I did like the use of the rice cakes for texture though.  -- BANANA LUMPIA ROLLS - Warm Bananas Foster and Coconut Ice Cream with Pomegranate...$8 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfly-san-francisco?select=lSejw8V4t5J9kNEBPMpvCA#aqE0Os5afwtHf1ZntUl2gw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/butt\u2026</a>) A pretty good spin on an otherwise non-Asian dessert. \u00a0The flavors were spot on and serving the bananas as lumpia (instead of battered) was a great call. \u00a0I was glad we split this one though, as the sauce made the dish a bit too sweet for me.  Regardless of my opinion of our food, the real downer of the night was the service. \u00a0I don't know if it was just a bad night, but our server seemed cold and dismissive. \u00a0She replied with a somewhat curt \"fine\" to our request to split the soup into two bowls (it still came out in one), took away my not-yet-finished cocktail, and barely looked at us when passing by. \u00a0From beginning to end, she wasn't very hospitable.  Since we were there for dinner on a somewhat foggy night, it's unfortunate we weren't able to fully enjoy the view of the bay while we were there. \u00a0I imagine it would have made for a rather picturesque backdrop. \u00a0What's worse, I can't really say I'll be back to check it out or not. \u00a0  NOTE: If you are planning on coming here, parking on The Embarcadero can be tough since the meters run late. \u00a0A better bet is to park across the way on Bay, where there are less restrictions, especially on the side opposite the park/lawn.",

I was happily surprised by: - the decor - nice touch of modern and comfort - the jazzy music in the background - good service  Now, the wine list was good, and actually Wine Spectator gave them an award for it.  The food was great, had the following: - Heirloom tomatoes with Burrata mozzarella - yum! - Mesquite Pork - great meet with a mac &amp; cheese with morel mushrooms, pistachios and cherries - yum! - peach &amp; berry cobbler - pretty good one, not the best i had but good  Overall, i would say that it is a place to try again (if you haven't been to it in a while).   Of course - the view is great and that's why I will go back.   Enjoy!",

There is a parking lot (where Bauer's parks their buses) very close where you can park, and you can come inside while the crowd thins out after the 'works and have wine and dessert. It's a nice way to not have to spend anymore time than you have to at Pier 39 during the 4th of July.

They also allowed us to replace items on our dishes that we did not like.  Desserts: 5/5  \u00a0 \u00a0Simply mouth watering. We had at least one of each. they were great.  Overall: 5/5  \u00a0 \u00a0It's definitely a place to go to. Great view of the bay. Great food, martini's and desserts.",

No music of any kind and the acoustics were unbearable. The sound bounced off the walls and the space was simply like a noisy warehouse.

    "review_text": "My husband and I went to Butterfly for Thanksgiving dinner. I had high hopes for Butterfly, since they were well reviewed on Bay Area Check Please.  First off, the $50 price per person was fair for the amount of courses we received.   The starter was pretty good, we enjoyed the salmon although the crisp it was on was a little greasy. The oyster shooter was fresh, the oyster could have been larger. The grapefruit was nice and refreshing.   The second course for me was the soup. Nothing should be changed, the flavors are at once creamy with the creme fraiche, spicy with the ginger and curry and luscious with pumpkin base. Garnished with toasted pumpkin seeds and sprouts-I \u00a0loved it! My husband's salad and Hawaiian bread muffin was good, but not spectacular like my soup. The salad was a mix of pomegranite seeds, greens, goat cheese and candied pecans, it was average I could have put that together easily.  The main course, Turkey breast with hash really fell short for me, the Asian flavors didn't complement the turkey and instead tasted salty and metallic- it was not the flavor you want from your favorite comfort food. The small potato with cheese was a little stale and you could tell it sat around awhile, \u00a0the corn muffin with cranberry compote was good but wished it were crispy and warm.  Pumkie pie ended the meal, it was good but the standard stuff you get from the bakery.   I don't know if the automatic gratuity of 18% is standard, or just for the special Thanksgiving dinner but it would have been nice if our waiter had pointed it out. We found ourselves listening to another waiter not only describing the dishes he was serving but pointing out the gratuity- We did see it on the bill of course, but it's a nice touch when your waiter mentions it. He would not have gotten that 18% otherwise.  All in all, I would like to give Butterfly another chance on a day that we can order off the menu since it seeems to get good reviews.",

I went here for the lunch dine about town because after looking at all the other places, this one gives me more bang for my buck. Granted you get good view of the bay but you're also between two ilapidated buildings and there was a cruise ship blocking most of my view. However, they sat my friend and I in one of those couples seat facing the door. I actually kind of like it and I totally want that table now.   We started out with some local beers and oyster shooters sans the liquor. Although small, they taste good for $2. Then we had the duck confit spring roll. Sidenote: spring rolls give the connotation of the vietnamese spring rolls. These are more like egg rolls. They were actually good, but it could have been any meat. I couldn't taste the duck. Then we had the kahlua pork. These were actually really good and the meat was just super tender and the lettuce was fresh. For our entries we did the snapper and shanghai noodles. The snapper was definitely a good choice because it was tender and the portion was enough to feed two. They instructed us to make it like a wrap, but you can just do a vermicilli dish style with it. We alreayd did too much wrapping with the kahlua pork. The noodles were greasy though. It wasn't what I was expecting from a fusion place.   Overall the experience was lovely. It was a hit and miss with our meal, but the wait staff was super nice. I wouldn't go here unless it was lunch dine about town. Price was too much for the type of food they serve but they are in a prime tourist location so I can't blame the.",

Overall: \u00a0We went on a cold rainy night, thinking that the place would not be crowded. \u00a0Wrong... the place with packed. \u00a0Goes to show that rain or shine this place holds its own! \u00a0We really enjoyed our dining experience here and we have another Groupon that we plan to use really soon.

We yelped this place and it was within walking distance so we dropped by for some drinks and food late in the afternoon. We ordered margaritas because the bartender recommended them and I'm so glad she did! They were literally the best margaritas I've ever tasted. It consisted of tequila, agave nectar, and fresh squeezed limes (we saw her do it right in front of us!) such simple ingredients! Then the head chef who is also the owner came out to say hi to his customers and he ordered a round for everyone at the bar! It was such a nice gesture, something you never see in nice restaurants like this! For food we ordered chicken wings, calamari, duck confit spring rolls, the chicken salad club sandwich, and the mushroom au jus. Needless to say, the chefs have it down with the food. There's a great touch of Asian spices and herbs that give it all a unique flavor. They turn simple plates into amazing ones! The place is located right on the water too and was so pretty. The dinner menu looked really good too so next time I'm here, I'll definitely be checking it out!",

Anyway, the views are amazing. I would like to try this place again when it's light outside, as the restaurant has huge windows that overlook the bay.   Food:  We started with the duck confit spring rolls, which were very good. They are fried spring rolls paired with a wasabi sweet sauce. This was by far my favorite dish of the night. For my main dish I had the short ribs. This dish was disappointing. The meat was not as tender as I would have liked it and the reduction was too salty. Over salting kills dishes, and this one was no exception. For dessert I had a the chocolate chip cookie with mint chip ice cream. This dish was good, the cookie was a little burnt. Nothing really special about this dessert; I could have created this myself at home for half the price.   This restaurant, has a prime view and decor that could allow it to be a top notch restaurant. Additionally, the food concept of Asian fusion, is definitely a big craze in the food world right now. Unfortunately, the food is not quite at high level standards.",

    "review_text": "BEAUTIFUL.... simply beautiful.   Okay, it took me a long time to write this review, just because there is no perfect words to describe the experience. To begin with, I had low expectations upon coming here. My friend bought a groupon, so we decided to make a reservation! But wow, HUGE surprise.   I think I had the best seat in the house. Small little table, with cozy sofa seats, next to the bar, facing the water. It was near sunset, and even though WATER is the only view, it's so beautiful. I felt so serene. So if you are having dinner for two, I recommend you to request this table. Remember, the small table next to the bar facing water... It's at the corner with a bigger table that fits around six people. And if there's no party, you have the whole corner to yourself!   Okay, enough about the table. Now let's talk about FOOD. My conclusion for this place is.... Fresh equals to delicious! Butter lettuce cup so fresh that it's good on its own, but the Kalua Pig makes it even better! I also had the seared scallops with lemon risotto, DELISH! I seriously think that you should have lemon in your risotto all the time, it's so good! My friend had the pork chop which I thought was okay. The pork chop is too thick. When it comes to pork, I like it with more fat. The other thing that didn't impress me was the duck confit spring rolls. Every plate came out with great presentation, I feel bumped for not having my camera with me that night. But, there is no such amazing presentation in the spring rolls, which disappointed me.   Then, dessert...we were so full that we could only share a dessert. We had Banana Bread Pudding, and again great presentation with great taste. I also had Lychee Martini, which I loved!   Lastly, SERVICE was amazing. Chef. Robert Lam came out and greet tables every 15 minutes. I was there for about an hour, and he came by to my table at least two times. I am SO impressed!   I can't wait to come back and tried more things. Butterfly has a very casual ambiance and offers high quality food. It's somewhere in between casual and fine dining. 2 appetizers+ 2 entrees + 1 dessert + 1 drink is about $100 (not including tips).",

After our meals, magically the space was cleared from a restaurant and turned into a dance floor. Since we had dinner there, we didn't have to pay a cover.

    "review_text": "As a native San Franciscan, who lives and eats in the city, I rarely ever head down to the Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf area when it comes to choosing a restaurant. We locals mostly think that area is catered just for the tourist. Well, the tourists may indeed be going to these establishments but that shouldn't stop us locals from heading down there as well. And Butterfly is the reason! After dining there 4 or 5 times, I finally decided to post a review.   I discovered the place when a group of work colleagues had an after-work dinner there, and since then, I've been back a few times to try out their menu. Honestly, I have yet to be disappointed. Is it Asian? Is it Asian-Fusion? Is it Asian-Californian? I don't know and I really don't care. What I do know is that all of the food is unique, flavorful, well-seasoned and definitely worth the trek down to the waterfront. Some of the popular dishes remain year round but they do change other things on a seasonal basis. On my last visit, I tried the mushroom cappuccino soup, which was so thick and decadent, it reminded me of what would be served as an amuse-bouche at a fancy/formal establishment...but double the portion. The plum salad (not on the current menu) was genius as it combined fruit and tangy fish sauce together, a first for me. The kalua pig lettuce cups are a great starter to share along with the wok seared noodles. As for the entrees, I've usually stuck to things with the 'asian flavors' in them, such as the fish but the filet mignon steak was really good. The short ribs were delicious as well. Always plenty of different desserts worth trying so be sure to save room.   Overall, Butterfly was a great place to discover and I'll continue to go back, especially to try out all the new dishes that are added. If parking is a challenge (there is a paid lot across the street), the F streetcar line stops right outside the door, so their easily accessible via the MUNI.",

They told me all other time slots were full, so I would have to stay with my reservation time. Bummer, but oh well. I gave the tickets away. The next day, one day before my reservation, I get a call telling me my reservation is cancelled because a large party needs my space at that time. What?! You confirm with me for two weeks, even tell me my spot is final the day before so I have to give away free tickets, and THEN you tell me right before the day of my reservation that I'm getting bumped out because a party is more important than other customers? They tried to make it up with a gift certificate, but that really only helps so much. The gift certificate is less than the value of the tickets I gave away, and now I'm in a bit of a bind for taking my special someone out for a celebration. Just inexcusably poor customer service. And to make matters worse, I had just bought a living social deal to spend here :/ it's too bad you have to leave at least 1 star on these things, it really takes away from expressing my displeasure and disappointment.

Alas, I have come up with 2 things: -gorgeous views overlooking the water -attentive servers And those, combined, are going to merit my 1 star.   The food was decidedly BAD. Ok, well not terrible by normal standards, but when I go to this kind of place I expect the food to be at a certain level, and Butterfly's food didn't measure up to any standards. We came here for my birthday dinner, mostly at my mom's suggestion because she had a Living Social Deal. \u00a0We started with the calamari and a side of the garlic noodles. Now, my mom and I aren't mayonnaise lovers, so it came as no shock to us that we were not fond of the aioli that came with the calamari. However, we did not expect the aioli to be slopped on top of every piece of calamari that we received. The portion was small, the calamari was soggy, and I wish they had given us the sauce on the side (as is usually the case). \u00a0The garlic noodles were literally the same as any order of chow mein that you can get in any Chinese restaurant. I got no real sense of garlic and they, too, were full of oil. For our mains I had the Tombo Tuna and my mom had the Hanger Steak. The tombo tuna had very little flavor except for the dry rub that was on it (let me just say, the \"dry rub\" is really just furikake, which can be bout at any Japanese market for $4). There was no sauce, and I was left wondering what I would do with the rare pieces of tuna meat on the inside that had no dry rub flavor. The best part of the dish was 'calamari' purple rice. It was pretty flavorful, but I think that to be called 'calamari rice' the rice must actually have calamari in it. I think I counted about 6 itty bitty pieces or so. My mom's entr\u00e9e was world's better than mine. Loads more flavor and she actually got sauce. Thank god they gave her a gigantic steak knife, though, because her meat was TOUGH. And I know hanger steak is a tough cut of meat, but she was chewing for the majority of the meal. For dessert, we had the 'chocolate torte.' Now, picture what a chocolate torte looks like in your mind. I'm guessing your thinking of something that looks a little like miniature pie. What we got was a molten chocolate cake. Which was good, but just not what we expected or wanted.   The service and ambiance is great, but the food was so disappointing that is detracted exponentially from the appeal of everything else. I will not be back, living social deal or not.",

(The females being more successful at it than the guys that night, if that helps any readers.)  The views of the bay weren't too well employed, since it was pitch dark inside and outside, and obscured by all the tall bodies. There was an outhouse aroma that also seeped into the tiny dance floor area from the wharf outside... no wait, it's coming from the dance floor spill in the middle! Strange, I thought that pool was spilt drinks. Everyone escaped to the wharf for fresh-ish air, smokes, and intimate chats.  There was a $30 minimum to use the credit card on drinks, which (if you got it from the smaller bar) were small and served in the little dixie cups you'd get at the dentist. Boo.  But my biggest props go to the security staff that night. Buncha good guys that did their job well. They were on that weird spill in no time, with the bussers who wiped it up. Also friendly and witty, the lot of them.

The decor was... confusing. \u00a0They decorated an old warehouse-structured building with its old window pane with a large edgy black mirror &amp; candle piece along the wall opposite the window, spiky sea urchin-looking black chandlers on one side of the room, and a brown bamboo room divider near the kitchen. \u00a0The bar, which was located across the room from the kitchen, looked classy, but the chairs reminded me of lawn chairs with their crisscrossed backs. \u00a0The bathroom had the type of stalls you'd find in a fast food joint, but the sinks were stone with high faucets and a pot of either incense or small flowers (I can't remember) on a shelf in front.   Our waiter was friendly and attentive and, with the exception of my companion's cappuccino coming out halfway into dessert, the timing of our entrees were spot on. \u00a0  To begin, I had a glass of the Hangtime Pinot Noir, which was okay, but definitely not one that I would have again. \u00a0It was brought out, pre-poured in a stemless wine glass. \u00a0  Out of curiosity we went with the Wok Seared Shanghai Garlic Noodles for our appetizer. \u00a0It was basically a bowl of chow mein they CALL an appetizer. \u00a0It was very good and I don't regret having had it, but it didn't quite seem like an appetizer, especially when there were main entrees like a 22 oz. Cowboy Steak on the menu. \u00a0  I opted for the gnocchi for my main entree. \u00a0It was creative and very well done. \u00a0The presentation was lovely as well. \u00a0My companion chose the Filet Mignon, which was tender, juicy, and just the right portion size. \u00a0  For dessert, we chose the banana bread pudding with Mitchell's macapuno ice cream. \u00a0It was rich and sweet and I loved the first few bites, but after a while it got a little too rich and sweet and we both gave up on finishing it. \u00a0The late-delivered cappuccino appeared to be overly frothy upon first glance, but it was actually well made.",

The food was fair - the 5-spiced braised beef ribs was okay - but the sauce was way too salty. \u00a0If you order this, ask for the sauce on the side.  The duck breast dish was cooked perfectly done (med rare) and tasty.  I had the curried pumpkin soup that was a special that night. \u00a0It was OK but also a bit heavy on the salt.  Appetizer Kalua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups was okay - a bit too much fatty portions of pork.  Dessert and Wine menu seemed more reasonably priced than main menu.  Skip the coffee, flat flavor - not worth even the low price of $3.",

Not only is the restaurant gorgeous (water front views....high ceilings, view of the kitchen, great decorations/lighting...especially loved the sea urchin chandeliers) but the prices were very reasonable considering its on the Embarcadero.   Things to try:  ****GO DURING BRUNCH ON THE WEEKENDS Butterfly offers a great 18dollar bottomless deal and its interchangeable between mimosas or bloody marys MMMM (regular price 10bucks a glass so you do the math!)  The fire fried calamari is AHMAZING...not too battery, always tender, and served with a great aioli sauce atop soy sauce/sesame oil cucumbers. Delicious and a huge portion!!  The eggs Benedict with kalu pulled pork...spiced up tradition with great flavors and a delicate sauce...eggs were poached to perfection and the pork was sweet and smokey  The kobe beef burger....what more do I have to say...its Kobe **NOTE--the meat is very very tender so order medium if you usually like medium rare or else it will fall apart on you (not to worry though, medium is still pink in the middle so the burger will still retain its flavor and tenderness)  Banana Bread Pudding....ORDER THIS! I don't even like bananas but I was blown away by this dessert....a bevy of textures and tastes, this dish was surprisingly complex and was delicious bite after bite. Totally worth it if you have room!  The staff was awesome, both our server and the manager gave us VIP treatment and were incredibly personable and fun. My boyfriend and I adore this place and its our go to restaurant to bring family and friends for a weekend brunch",

We ordered off the drinks menu right away. \u00a0While the drinks were certainly pricy, I heard no positive comments about them. \u00a0We also ordered up some calamari and garlic noodles for appetizers. \u00a0The calamari was quite delicate and good at $1.25 per piece, while the garlic noodles were forgettable.  As for the entrees, they were quite steep. \u00a0For $18, you could get some veggies and gnocchi. \u00a0If you wanted anything more, it's all about $28-39. \u00a0I ordered the black cod for $25. \u00a0It came out as a tiny wedge of fish that sat high on top of three clams. \u00a0I finished it in all of four bites. \u00a0The gnocchi dish consisted of a fried squash flower and exactly 5 pieces of odd-looking gnocchi. \u00a0About the only decent dish was the whole fish, but my friend got a terrible stomach ache afterwards. \u00a0Coincidence? \u00a0I hope so.  While having the chef come by to check on us was a nice touch, it certainly didn't make up for the pathetically small portions or the lackluster food. \u00a0Maybe we were paying for the priviledge of the bay view, of which the restaurant had ample portions. \u00a0Otherwise, the six of us tabbed out at $295.50, including tax and the required 18% tip (service was quite good). \u00a0At nearly $50 each, we were all grumbling about being less than satisfied as we left, including even the light eaters. \u00a0Perhaps we operate under different economics than the locals, but that just seemed way too much for so little. \u00a0Then again, with the restaurant still mostly empty when we left at 7:30pm, the locals had probably already figured this place out. \u00a0Even with my $25 coupon, it hardly made a dent in our spirits and confirmed yet again that <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">restaurant.com</a> coupons are terrible Devil's bargains.",

The kitchen took it's sweet time with our meal as in we ordered around 8:30 and got our food around 9:40. The waiter had zero experience so there was no offer of a free dessert to smooth over the terribleness of the wait. To his credit, he came over and apologized about 7 times and it obviously wasn't his fault, but this is a restaurant with prime real estate on the Embarcadero; I expect at least a functioning kitchen. When the food finally arrived it was essentially flavorless. My tuna had no flavor and was dry and boring. My friend said her steak wasn't terribly exciting either and I tried my other friend's squash that was also terribly unexciting. Luckily we had gone there on a Savored deal so we didn't pay full price, but my fancy tuna meal was worth somewhere between $10-12 in my mind. In real life, it's $26. Don't waste your money. They have some things to figure out at this place.",

    "review_text": "I had heard Butterfly mentioned several times so I was under the impression that this place was going to be super awesome, unfortunately though it didn't quite meet my expectations.  First off, Friday evening and the place was pretty dead, and those who were there were that of an older crowd. There were plenty of open tables so we were seated right away. The restaurant itself was nice - \u00a0sophisticated decor and large bay windows on one whole side of the room that overlooked the bay. During the day or on a clear night the view is probably amazing.   There were an array of drinks on the cocktail menu, all of them sounded good and they ended up tasting as good as they sounded.   The menu is simple but had something for everyone especially since I was dining with seafood allergies, fish only, \"i want steak!\" kind of friends. I ordered the roasted duck 'peking style' and was satisfied. There were smaller pieces of duck topped with a crisp'd leg. The portions were generous. Friend had the short rib which was nicely cooked. Other friend had the ahi tuna yellow fish and it was a big hunk of fish stacked on top of a stuffed onion ring. For some reason the meal didn't feel special, the service was mediocre and because there weren't many people there it wasn't exciting.  Overall I concluded that this place is probably not the best for dinner but may make an ideal happy hour or lounge spot.",

I started with a caesar salad &amp; their signature bourbon cocktail. \u00a0The salad was overly salty and underdressed. \u00a0The cocktail was decently tasty, but the orange in it overwhelmed the whiskey.  For the main course, I got the blue cheese &amp; macadamia crusted filet mignon. \u00a0The portion of steak was decent, to be expected for a filet, and the blue cheese was decadent. \u00a0I couldn't tell there were any macadamia nuts. \u00a0All in all, very pleased with the steak. \u00a0 \u00a0The potatoes were also very good, but the portion was meager. \u00a0I was not impressed with the vegetables. \u00a0Some were overcooked, some were almost raw. \u00a0The sauce was lackluster.  Along the course of the night, I also had a Bulleit manhattan (not well-crafted) and an Irish coffee (way too strong). \u00a0  I'm not sure I'd go here again--the food was all over the place &amp; the service was slow. \u00a0Seems like a good place if you want to spend your evening chatting, as there are long breaks between plates.  Not a good veggie place, there is only 1 vegetarian entree on the menu (gnocchi), and the portion is very small.",

My fiancee ordered the kobe beef burger and I ordered the salmon carpaccio and garlic seared clams and mussels. \u00a0We also ordered a red wine flight. \u00a0  The kobe beef burger to me was ok but my fiancee said that it was very juicy and yummy. \u00a0I didn't think it was juicy. \u00a0He really seemed to enjoy it though. \u00a0He scarfed the first half in less than a minute, I swear.  I did enjoy the clams and mussels. \u00a0The lemongrass curry sauce that it was soaked in and the sesame grilled baguette slices that came with it was very good. \u00a0The clams and mussels didn't smell or taste ocean-y; It was very clean tasting, if that makes sense. \u00a0That part is mainly why this dish was so yummy!  I expected more from the salmon carpaccio though, thus taking away one star from my rating. \u00a0It was a smoked loch salmon and was served under a few sprouts, creme fraiche (with a touch of horseradish perhaps?), and triangle crisps. \u00a0I dunno what this dish needed to wow me, but I felt like it was missing something. \u00a0Maybe a hint of lemon? \u00a0Something.  The busboy seemed a bit toooo enthusiastic about cleaning the table. \u00a0Maybe they needed to get us out of there to prep for the NYE crowd but it pissed me off that he asked if he can take my plate away when I was only half-way through everything. \u00a0Give me some time to chill here! \u00a0I need to finish my wine anyway. \u00a0  We were in and out, surprisingly, cause I like to linger and take the whole experience in. \u00a0Maybe it was the busboy who hurried me. \u00a0  I wish the lunch menu was a little more extensive. \u00a0My fiancee thought it was a little pricey for lunch. \u00a0The ho-hum waitress needs a red bull. \u00a0   I would give this place a three and a half if I could. \u00a0Overall, it was a slightly better-than-ok experience.",

    "review_text": "I am almost hesitant to give this restaurant the review it deserves, because it still is one of the best undiscovered gems in the city. Stepping off the beautifully redesigned Embarcadero into this cavernous Pier, you know you have arrived someplace special. Thick velvet curtains draping from the mile-high ceilings define the space and frame the glorious, unencumbered views of the bay. A DJ spins fun, unconventional music and even the lighting is completely eclectic.  We were greeted by a sincerely friendly and engaging hostess, who immediately copped to being brand new, but never-the-less showed the poise and skill of a long-timer. We were seated along the windows with a beautiful sunset view of San Francisco Bay.   Sonny, my vote for best bartender in SF, was shaking up the drinks like a woman possessed. Its not on the menu anymore, but she'll mix you up her signature \"Lemongrass\" if you ask for it (think Lemon Vodka Mohito). Its the BEST. Just stopping in for a drink at the bar can be a great way to pass an hour and enjoy a great cocktail.  Our waitress was a young Halle Barry lookalike named Helen who was delightful all night long. She was attentive and knowledgeable but never hovering or pushy. Her smile was infectious and we really felt like we were in her care all night. She brought out appetizers that were nice, though nothing out of this world. We all went for our favorite entree - Filet Mignon with blue cheese. As always, it was to die for. It could not have been done more beautifully. We finished up with the Creme Brulee and Molten Chocolate Cake which were also extraordinary.   Is the place cheap? No, but its not Boulevard either and the entire experience is worth every penny in my book. \u00a0I not only felt like we got great food and drink, but we were treated like warmly welcomed guests in this wildly eclectic living room filled with some of the best characters in San Francisco. People are at ease, staff and diners. One woman, another customer, even came to our table to wish our two birthday boys a very happy day. Its just that laid back. We will definitely be back!",

    "review_text": "My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate our Valentines day at Butterfly. The first thing I noticed when we drove around to find parking is that there was no Valet. I was very disappointed since most fine dining restaurants have valet. It saves a lot of time and is very convenient. We were late 15 minutes because of the lack of a valet service.  As soon as we stepped in I fell in love with the place. \u00a0The restaurant is situated right on the San Francisco Bay and every window had a beautiful view of the ocean. The setting and ambiance was very romantic. Dim lighting and trendy and modern interior design set the mood.   Our reservations were set for 8 p.m., however we were late about 15 minutes. The ma\u00eetre d' told us to sit at the bar and assured us that we would be called when a table became available. Anywho, while at the bar my boyfriend and I were eyeing an empty table right next to the window. We were hoping that it would be our table since no one was being seated there. After about 15 minutes at the bar and 1 full glass of merlot and 1 jack and coke for my boyfriend we were still not seated. A much older couple arrived at the bar and were seated next to us. Much to my surprise they were quickly seated at a window table.   Anyways, there was a pre-set menu for Valentines Day. For appetizers we had :  - a bloody mary oyster shooter gremolata - seasame grilled scallop \u00a0escebeche with avocado puree and a wonton cracker - kobe beef puff and foire gras puffs with sweet soy reduction - vietnamese caramalized sweet shrimp on sugar cane  There are no complaints about the appetizers. However, I did not enjoy the bloody mary osyter shooter. I'm not a big fan of the cocktail.  For the first course I had the lemon risotto, seared diver scallop smoked salmon roe with a duo of oranges. My boyfriend had the House smoked Scottish Salmon and strawberry salad rolls with a spicy and ginger garlic sauce. I was very pleased with my scallop dish. It was cooked very well and it was very moist. The oranges complimented the scallop. However, the scottish salmon and strawberry salad rolls that my boyfriend had ordered were disgusting. The rolls had to much rice noodle with a small portion of salmon and strawberries.  For the entree I ordered the wood oven roasted rack of lamb and my boyfriend had the lobster skillet pot pie. Overall, we were both pleased with our entrees but I was a little upset about the portion of lamb I was given. My \"rack of lamb\" was a piece of lamb with 4 small pieces of meat surrounding the plate. \u00a0The lamb was also a bit dry for me. I ordered my lamb \"rare\" and I think they cooked it to be about \" medium well.\"  For dessert we had assorted sweet and fruits. The portion size was very small but it was delicious.  Overall, I was very pleased with the food here. Their selection of Asian fusion food is much more appealing and tastier than Straits. I would have have given this place 5 stars if it had not been for the rude service while waiting for our table and the lack of valet.",

I wanted to still celebrate the second night of my birthday weekend dammit, so I turned faster then the blink of an eye from cleats and shorts to a skirt and stilettos (\"wonder woman, wonder woman!\") and promenaded with my three amigos over to the embarcadero and went to Butterfly.   It was a warm, wonderful night, and the host quickly seated us at a comfortable window side booth not just \"next\" to the water but literally above it (like those houses built on stilts to allow the water to flow underneath.) We had candles placed in front of us and the shine from the sliver of a silver moon. \u00a0  The four of us shared 2 orders of their \"famous\" salmon and strawberry rolls (it was a strawberry kind of day.) \u00a0We called this appetizer \"yummy unique.\" We also had the Caesar salad, which was lightly dressed and had just enough tang to it.   My amigas ordered the clams and the mussels and also the duck. \u00a0They all liked it, no complaints (one friend thought there was not enough spice or seasoning to the shellfish, the others disagreed.) \u00a0I had the Shanghai noodles. It was like a concoction of the typical tasty Vietnamese garlic noodles, but with a delightful sprinkle of fresh tomatoes, so it does not feel as heavy or greasy!   We lingered for a bit, when our waitress, who was so accommodating and beautiful, suggested (while keeping our indoor table!) we all have a champagne toast outside on their tiny little deck/dock (where it is very dark, like a spot where the kitchen staff might have a smoke break.)   Once outside, with a glass of champagne in hand, my girlfriends serenaded me with the \"dancing in the moonlight song\" and we did in fact do just that. Unfortunately, my boo-boo on my thigh began to bleed, and I went inside to use the ladies room. The host (manager?)noticed, and he quickly sat me down at the bar, retrieved his \"tool box\" and dosed a bandaged with antiseptic and carefully placed it on, and taped it up. He also gave me extra bandages and some Tylenol so that I could continue with my night!   This was not only a wonderful birthday night, but a night that will live as one of my most memorable in San Francisco.",

We kept drinks dry that night &amp; got an Acai berry lemonade &amp; a Pomegranate spritz. \u00a0Both drinks were really good but the spritz was a little too sweet.  For appetizers we got the Kalua pig with butter lettuce cups &amp; it was SO good! \u00a0The pork was juicy &amp; super tender; the portion was big; &amp; the hoi'sin/BBQ dipping sauce was just the right combination of sweet &amp; spicy. \u00a0We also go the Sweet miso roasted oysters which were small. \u00a0The texture of the oysters was way off since they were cooked to he**. \u00a0There was no miso flavor or saffron flavor. \u00a0It was cool that they were served in a skillet of hot rocks.  I got the Roasted chicken roulade mainly so I could say the word \"roo-laad.\" \u00a0The meat was moist but the skin was wicked crispy. \u00a0Beware of the piece of chili on top which was uber spicy but complemented the very Asian tasting sauce. \u00a0On the side, there was a thing of rice topped with coddled eggs that I broke &amp; mixed. \u00a0I am not scared of Salmonella @ all &amp; it tasted really good. \u00a0the boyfriend got the Macadamia &amp; bleu cheese crusted filet mignon &amp; he thought it was too bleu cheese'y...actually he said it was the worst steak he ever had. \u00a0Now, I tried the steak &amp; it was quite bleu cheese'y (I don't like stink cheeses) but it was cooked nicely to medium rare. \u00a0However, the garnish was just meh.  While the meal hasn't been a total success, the dessert was what tipped the scale; &amp; not in a good way. \u00a0We got the Lychee shaved ice which was super sweet. \u00a0The brandy cherries were too brandy. \u00a0The coconut &amp; almond tofu didn't have any coconut flavor. \u00a0There wasn't any ginger candy. \u00a0And a huge chunk of ice was sitting there in the martini glass; unshaved. \u00a0It really was the worst dessert we've ever had.  Our meal this time came out to be about $95.00 after tax. \u00a0We felt bad that the gift certificate was able to cover more than the entire tab so we left a bigger than usual tip. \u00a0Now that we've used both gift certificates, I don't know if we'll make the special trip over again; especially since public transportation can be such a nightmare. \u00a0With that said...I am starting to feel a slight sense of attachment.",

    "review_text": "FINALLY. \u00a0I finally had a good Dine About Town 2009 experience. \u00a0  Initially, I actually had low expectations for this place because of what I have heard and also from the other Yelp reviews. \u00a0However, after trying this place today, I would definitely come back. \u00a0This place is nice -- beautiful view, modern asian decor, and good service. \u00a0  They started us off with complimentary edamame drizzled with sesame oil and sesame seeds. \u00a0Those complimentary starters are always appreciated even if its small.  We ordered Fried Calamari (w/ watercress?), Salmon Carpaccio with Wasabi Crackers for the appetizers. \u00a0They both come in generous portions. \u00a0The Fried Calamari is pretty standard, nothing too different here. \u00a0The Salmon Carpaccio was delicious. \u00a0Great balance of flavors when you spread the wasabi cream spread over the cracker and layer it with a slice of salmon.  On to the entrees... We both ordered the Young Turmeric Grilled Snapper. \u00a0It is served with rice noodles, and what I can only guess as chinese lettuce? \u00a0The method of consumption is Vietnamese and is similar to how one would eat eggrolls. \u00a0First you take a piece of lettuce, put on some \u00a0 herb, green onions, carmelized onions. \u00a0Next, place on a little of the rice noodle. \u00a0Finally, place the little pieces of the snapper on it, drizzle on some of the fish sauce-based dipping sauce, and wrap it up. \u00a0Even though I've grown up on Vietnamese cuisine my whole life, this dish brought a refreshing different taste than I am used to. \u00a0Its nice that its grilled so its not too oily. \u00a0  For dessert, we had the creme brulee and the chocolate torte with coffee ice cream. \u00a0The creme brulee was one of the best Ive had. \u00a0Usually I dont like how watery the custard is. \u00a0As my friend puts it, the watery ones remind her of egg tarts from Chinatown. \u00a0The creme brulee they serve at Butterfly has a thicker more solid texture. \u00a0The caramel top wasnt too thick or sweet. \u00a0Good balance. \u00a0Could use a little more fruit though, but I am guessing their non-DAT option probably has more. \u00a0The chocolate torte was nice and warm when it came out. \u00a0Although I am not much of a chocolate cake person, the coffee ice cream help balance out the richness. \u00a0  Definitely would come again. \u00a0What a steal for DAT's $21.95 lunch.",

My girlfriend wasn't satisfied with her drink (Arnold Daly iced tea - good but not the strongest) and asked our waiter (Porter, who is completely awesome) to switch it out with another drink (lycheetini) - he was more than happy to oblige and was actually glad she had spoken up rather than drink something she wasn't happy with! I had the strawberry sidecar and a kumquat margarita and both were excellent. For food we had the steak fries - a small portion but definitely delicious. Crispy on the outside and soft inside, they were some of the best fries I've had in a while. The Tabasco remoulade was good, a little rich and mayonnaise-y, but good overall. We also had the calamari, which was really nice - crispy and delicious - and the Kalua pig lettuce wraps were delicious with the butter lettuce. We caught an error in pricing on our receipt and our waiter couldn't have been nicer.  All in all, a really, really good experience. We'll definitely be back here for happy hour!",

We were seated where I had requested with a good view of the pier. I was excited to try this place because it had great reviews and was featured on Check Please.  In regards to the food, I have to say I was sadly unimpressed. for snacking they brought cold edamames (I think) \u00a0in what I think was sesame seed oil and it tasted horrible! They weren't out of the shell so they had to be taken out and it wasn't worth the effort. No one at my table enjoyed it. I ordered a chicken dish that came with noodles. The chicken was bland and the noodles weren't that great. No one else really cared for their food either but we were all so hungry we had to eat something. My husband had a burger which was probably the only decent dish. My son had the chicken nugget meal with veggies and he didn't like it either so he just ate the veggies. The chicken was basically chicken tenders cut up to bit size and I guess cooked on a griddle. Very plain.   For dessert I can't even tell you what we got, It was that memorable. They did bring my son a scoop of ice cream and a cookie which he dropped and they immediately brought out another one no question. We did have decent drinks that got my sister, friend and I feeling right which saved the lunch.  All in all overall we made the most of the experience. I had a great time with family, got a little tipsy, laughed our butt of and DID receive good service from the waitstaff. I just wished that the food matched the rest of my experience.",

I had an heirloom tomato risotto and the others all had various meat dishes, including a chicken with Marscapone cheese and crab, which the boy said was delicious.

    "review_text": "I went to Butterfly with two friends on Chinese New Year day. The food was worth a 4 star but the service was extremely bad.   We especially reserved the window seat so that we could enjoy the water view. When we arrived, the host brought us to this extra big round table that could fit five and oddly located in the center of the restaurant. When I asked how come my reservation was not honored, she simply told me this table could have a better view of the water. The restaurant was not even crowded on a Monday afternoon. I doubt if they reserved a table for me by the window because none was available.   The host probably noticed my unwillingness when I was checking out the menu, she then put me in a small table by the window in the back which I could only notice the bar and where they stored utensils. No one came to our table until a long while later to get the drinks. Our server was very rude. She was bad mouthing with the host beside our table. After a long wait, another server brought us soy bean, water, and our drinks. I asked if I can place the order and our server was called back.   When I placed the order for me and my friends, our server asked in a very rough tone for me to be specific which order is for whom. We ordered two Dine About Town lunch and a Curry Chicken noodle. The appetizer Smoke Salmon was the best. Salmon was seasoned very well and they gave a good portion. The crackers were good and tasty with salmon and cream cheese. The duck spring roll was a good difference from the typical kind of spring roll. BEWARE of the dressing because it had mustard and I would like it better with sweet and sour sauce.   The curry chicken noodle was tasty and so was their chicken salad club sandwich. The grilled snapper with noodle was a steal and a lot of fun. Grilled Snapper was accompanied with caramelized onion, jalapeno and other spices. The meal came with vermicelli, lettuce, and vietnamese fish sauce that you can create your own lettuce wrap. For dessert, we ordered the cream brulee and it was so-so.   Although it was my only time at Butterfly, I could tell from all the dishes their signature favor is their special salt. I would come back for the food again, but I would advice for people who wanted to celebrate a special occasion maybe choose another place because of the service.",

Chef, manager, host, and servers all came up to us and made small, nice conversation. Cool people.  Food was ok.   APPS: Sonoma Libery Duck Confit Spring Rolls were decent, just like your average deep fried spring rolls, nothing really special. Kalua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups were simple but yummy.  COCKTAILS: Lycheetini was way too strong. Friend had to ask for more syrup to make it sweeter.  ENTREES: I had the Five Spice Braised Angus English Short Rib. Meat was INCREDIBLY tender but the sauce was too salty and didn't enjoy the rice cakes with them. I would have preferred steamed rice. 4 people from my party wanted the Free Range Rocky Jr. Chicken Clay Pot but they 'just ran out' when we began to order so that totally changed the mood. Supposedly, they ran out of chicken but it was only 7:00 pm on a Saturday and the restaurant wasn't EVEN close to a full house. Friends who resorted to the Loco Moco Burger thought it was dry and needed gravy, and would've preferred going to Ono's Hawaiian BBQ instead. Friends who ordered the Sesame Crusted Ahi Bros. Yellowfin Tuna thought it was alright, as well.  DESSERT: Best part! I had the Chocolate Chip &amp; Almond Cookies which came with a creme brulee and chilled Vietnamese coffee. The coffee came with a chocolate straw, the creme brulee was delicous, and the cookies were perfect. Friend got the Banana Lumpia Rolls (aka Turon in Tagalog), they seemed a little soggy since they were covered in ice cream. Other friends got Banana Bread Pudding and they seemed to enjoy it a lot. Another friend got the Warm Chocolate Torte, pretty simple, just like any other.  Overall, good experience. Kind of disappointing that half of my party couldn't get the clay pot that they wanted.

For our entrees, I got the Grilled Kalbi Skirt Steak \"Surf and Turf\" and my friend got the Hoisin Glazed Rack of Baby Back Pork Ribs. \u00a0The steak dish is amazing! In addition to 2 decently sized pieces of perfectly cooked and flavored steak (I got it medium rare),you get 2 pieces of shrimp, 2 jumbo scallops, baby bok choy, and some tasty crispy egg noodles. \u00a0This dish deserves 5 stars. \u00a0The ribs, on the other hand, were too salty and a bit dry and hard. \u00a0I think my mom makes better rib... and that's not a compliment. \u00a0I would give the ribs 2 stars, and it's a hefty $29. \u00a0Finally, the service was phenomenal. \u00a0They refilled our water multiple times and would check up on us to make sure that we were ok. \u00a0In summary, with the exception of the ribs, I think the food and service here is wonderful. \u00a0It is fairly pricey though, even with the Living Social coupon. \u00a0I would return here, but probably only for a special occasion, or if they have another coupon.",

    "review_text": "Went here for their dine about town special lunch. I have to say I am impressed at their servings sizes. Some places trim their servings down to minuscule sizes for dine about town, which hardly makes them the deal one hopes them to be. Here however we had a good sampling of three of their courses while feeling that they were not skimping on the portions.   We had the firecracker calamari to start, which was good, although not spectacular. I like it when calamari is crispy and not chewy, and this place got one for two, because it wasn't that crispy. The spicy mayo sauce was good, as was the diced veggies that surrounded it. All in all probably above average calamari, I'd say B+   Also had the Duck Spring Rolls. Let me tell you, we didn't expect them to be deep fried. Usually I understand spring rolls to *usually* refer to \"fresh\" rather than the deep fried. Deep fried usually comes under the moniker, \"Imperial Rolls\" or \"Egg Rolls\", so I was a bit taken aback. Still they were OK, although not as generous a portion as the calamari (just four small pieces and the wicked mustard dip).   For the main course we had the garlic noodles as one, and the snapper as another.   The snapper was good, although I always find it a pain to make my own wraps as things get all over the place. All you single folks out there, be advised I wouldn't recommend trying to juggle a lettuce wrap concoction on a first date, stick to the easier to eat items!   The garlic noodles were OK, they were obviously the token vegetarian option. In retrospect it was probably a waste of an item choice to go with such a low budget item, but alas, what is done is done.   Dessert was good, the chocolate lava cake was good enough to rival Roy's and the creme brulle was not too bad and a fair sized portion (although they over burnt the top portion and I prefer a bit more natural vanilla flavor to the creme).",

Salmon rolls - average. I had the Shaking Beef Cobb Salad and my gf had the Kobe Beef Burger. The shaking beef was not as flavorful as say slanted door but was all right. Kobe beef tasted just like regular beef when it's ground up I guess. Overall the food was just average, but I am docking a star because the service sucked!!! It took us over 2 hours for lunch because the waiter barely came over to our table. Each course took about 15 minutes too long (as in we were done and had to wait for the next dish). I don't think it's compelling enough for me to go back.",

    "review_text": "I went here for the second time yesterday evening for dinner and had a great experience. I made a reservation a day earlier requesting a table with a waterfront view and I was completely pleased. Following the other Yelpers, I would agree that it is not the best view of the Bay since you will see yourself in-between two piers, but nevertheless it is a very peaceful view. Additionally, I highly recommend coming here by the end afternoon when there is still sunlight. It is very relaxing after work/school with good company.  The ambiance is really nice! The decor is a mixture of modern art (metal/steel) and natural materials (wood/bamboo). Many people gathered around the full bar for the happy hour. Lounge jazz music. It gives somewhat a moderate noise level. Fun and lively, but still allows conversation if you get a good table (you can request it upon reservation).  I would disagree with other reviews underating the food quality. I was pretty impressed with the flavors and presentation. After seating we were promptly served water and edamame. We started with (virgin) lycheetinis and an order of the duck confiti spring rolls. Very nicely fried and served with a wasabi based sauce. Some might find it spicy, but if you like wasabi you will be fine.  For entrees, I ordered the braised short ribs with jasmine rice cakes and pumpkin pesto. The meat was perfectly cooked and literally melted when cutting with the knife, and the jasmine rice cake worked like a rice cracker, adding a surprising crunchiness as a combination to the meat. The waiter brought the beef broth separately and added to the plate upon serving. It was warm and you can hear the meat sizzling whilst pouring it. Very cool experience. My companion ordered the vegetarian bento box - good combination of tempura, tofu and a bowl of curry. We both really enjoyed our orders.  After the dinner, we were full and no room for dessert. But I would definitely come back to try those.  Bottom line: great decor, lively yet relaxing ambiance, very attentive service (A++), good (but not excellent view), great Asian fusion food!",

We chose it because it was the closest place to the pier and it turned out to be a great choice. I was a little worried that it looked like a nice place and we were looking our usual scruffy selves but that didn't turn out to be a problem.   The service was fine and friendly enough. \u00a0It was about 9pm on Saturday evening and it was fairly quiet in there. The complimentary edamame beans were gorgeous (they don't sound it, I know!), as was my Cherry Blossom cocktail -cherry vodka, lemon, brandied cherry.  Food-wise as a veggie I had very few options so went with the vegetarian bento box (the ONLY veggie entree) and was so glad I did. \u00a0I'm fairly greedy and when it arrived I didn't think it would be enough to fill me up but it did without leaving me feeling over-stuffed. \u00a0It contained veggie tempura, seared rice noodle, tofu and bok choy stir fry and sweet potato curry which was gorgeous but would have been better with more 'stuff' and less sauce. \u00a0It was all lovely but if I had one suggestion it would be that it needed rice to soak up some of the sauces. Nothing too spicy, just really, really tasty.   If they had more veggie options and maybe added rice to the bento box I'd have considered giving them a five. \u00a0If I was a local I'd definitely be returning although couldnt go too often as would soon get tired of the same meal every time!",

I called the restaurant twice half an hour before the reservation time to ask for chance of holding the table or maybe canceling but no one answered.   Then around reservation time I received a phone call from them, I told them I tried to reach them couple times earlier but no one answered and canceled the reservation. 20minutes later, a young lady from Butterfly called me, literally yelled at me, and accused me of not showing up like a criminal. She rudely told me that she will charge $300 as a fine for me \"canceling reservation the last minute\" ($75/each), from the credit card info I put in during reservation, with extremely AGGRESSIVE tone. Then I asked her about the restaurant policy of canceling reservation to understand more about the situation. All she said was \"what you are exactly doing right now is violating the restaurant policy\", and she kept repeating that more then 10 times then hung up.   I had to call my credit card company immediately to report unauthorized charge, such a fraud. Still can not believe they want to rob $300 - THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS (A WHOLE LOT especially for NOTHING) \u00a0from my pocket bc they did not answer my phone canceling table, very shocked. \u00a0  A CAUTION EVERYONE!!!!! Everyone should be careful with them when you reserve the table there, dont let them trick you to rob your money, because once they can, its way too expensive.   It was the worst of worst service experience I have ever received from such \"fine-dining\" restaurant. I am not sure if this has the best chef, location or is the best spot in town or not, what happened to me say it all about customer service, about how they value us, with very LOW respect.

I had the house-made gnocchi for dinner. \u00a0What a perfect meal--they have managed to make gnocchi light by pairing the little sauteed puffs with spring vegetables, hearts of palm, and fried goat cheese balls. \u00a0The serving size was perfect and left a little room for dessert. \u00a0My mom had the shrimp/green papaya salad as an entree and was very impressed while my dad had the chicken entree--he couldn't stop talking about it!  We shared a lightish dessert of homemade cookies, tiny creme brulee, and turkish coffee ice cream. \u00a0The cookies could have been better, but it was ultimately a good dessert to split and the tiny creme brulee was super cute!  The chef came out at the end of the meal and asked how everything was. \u00a0At that point the restaurant was bustling with tourists and locals alike. \u00a0We saw people devouring a 26 ounce steak that looked amazing if you are down for a beef-filled challenge. \u00a0All in all, my dad made a good choice and I am sure I'll return for a special occasion.",

I loved the mushroom cappuccino soup! Not only was the presentation adorable (large cappuccino cup with white foam and sprinkles) but it tasted heavenly! For my entr\u00e9e, I had the shaking beef cob salad. Again, I was \u00a0very impressed. Not many fusion places get the shaking beef right. I find that a lot of places serve it dry and over-cooked or way too greasy. Butterfly served it up just right! Each bite was tender and juicy and NO GREASE!!

    "review_text": "What a delight. At Butterfly our plates were touched by an Angel, literally! Our server, Angel, was phenomenal in making us feel welcome, and with a professional demeanor he helped us navigate through the menu mentioning best seller items and his favorites.  Allergic to soy, any Asian cuisine presents its challenges, but I have learned to scan the menu for deadly and safe choices. Luckily the fusion aspect of the concept kept it easy, and Butterfly offered (soy free) salmon and strawberry spring roll that tasted just like that - spring :0) The rolls were light, and the rice paper moistened just right. The Kalua Pig served up with butter lettuce and Hoisin sauce was delicious too. Of course I had to indulge without the Hoisin, but the choice of butter lettuce over the traditional iceberg deserves mention. It works!  Predicting that I would be full of food at this point, I made an entree out of the Seafood minestrone which turned out to be a smart move. Even though the dish is listed as a starter, the generous bowl was more than me' tummy could handle. Especially since I also had to leave room to fork into Eric's irresistible pick; the crab stuffed chicken. Wow, was that delicious! Think Cordon Bleau (breaded pan-fried chicken, stuffed with ham and cheese), and you're headed in the right direction. Yet, this version is full of crab and much lighter than the traditional Cordon. Additionally, the accompanying spinach and balsamic vinaigrette prevents it from becoming overwhelming. So, yeah, that explains what really happened, why Eric's plate wound up clean while I still had soup left over (thanks for putting up with it Tiger :-).  At this point I don't know how we fitted the apple and ginger cobbler, \u00e1 la mode, but we went right through it. The coffee and espresso was good too.  The only less than applaudable experience was the sumojito, but I've read so many good reviews on it that I'm sure mine was the odd mishap. The drink came out full of mint leaves, and what a waste of mint that could have sent my buds into heaven, had the leaves just been muddled. Oh well, maybe next time.  Somewhere between the sweet hostess, the phenomenal view, our Angel, the good food, and the stylish decor I definitely became a fan. Ergo, may this Butterfly last.",

We were seated by the water, which was awesome, but the heavy rain sort of kill the beauty of it.   Their non-alcoholic cocktails are indeed delightful. I also love their interior modern decor, but sadly, their customer service is not serving up to the hype and their food does not taste as nice as how the restaurant looks.   Oyster Shooter (bloody mary sauce, garlic and cilantro gremolata). Even for $1, the oyster didn't excite any taste buds. It was not fresh at all.   Duck Confit Spring Rolls was not a good dish either. I think their mustard and honey dipping sauce did not complement the Chinese egg rolls. The sauce was too spicy, it made all of us almost choke to death.   Fire Fried Calamari was another disappointment. The outer shell was not crispy as the calamari was half soaked in tabasco remoulade sauce. Besides, the fired fried calamari was not \"fire\" hot inside and it did not taste fresh either.   The only thing that stood out from our dinner that night was the grilled-12-oz-New York steak, which we had to wait for almost 40 minutes after we ordered and finished all the appetizers. The steak was ordered medium rare, but came out as much well done as it could be. However, the steak was surprisingly flavorful.",

We decided to go out for dinner together as a family. \u00a0It was freezing and we were starving, not really being familiar with the area, we saw this restaurant and thought we'd give it a try. Upon entering the restaurant, it looked very empty for a Friday night. The few people that were seated at the bar was a group of Caucasians. My family and I are not Caucasian. The hostess greeted us and we asked for a table for three. I became suspicious as soon as the hostess looked us over before responding. The hostess asked if we had a reservation, which of course we didn't and simply said \" I'm sorry we're fully booked tonight and I cannot take anyone else.\" As i mentioned before the entire restaurant appeared empty. We left and less then 10 minutes passed I decided to call the restaurant. The female I spoke to over the phone assured me that I did not need a reservation and that I could just walk in. I asked if they would be able to accept a party of 4 for dinner that same evening and said that we were only 10 minutes away. Needless to say, not only did they lose my \u00a0business, but anyone and everyone I know will hear about this experience, or lack there of.",

Great location: It's along the Embarcadero, and because it's just a few blocks from the oh-so-touristy Pier 39, there's plenty of parking on the streets and by garages. After dinner, you can walk down by the bay.   Mediocre food: I'm a huge fan of the kobe sliders here. But, the rest of the food here like the wok seared shanghai garlic noodles and duck confit spring rolls weren't all that creative or tasty.   Above-Average Ambiance: Layout is interesting. There's two sides of this restaurant, and it's worth the walk to go outside onto the terrace to see the view of the bay and *ahem*...Oakland. Haters gonna hate.

My g.f.'s steak was bloody even tho she ordered it medium and was bland.. so to sum it up. neglectful service. bad food. and expensive!

Which do you prefer tonight?\"  \"I think tonight we could go for a great view and good food,\" my friend responded.   The food is overpriced for the quality and portions. I had the salmon with risotto, which was well prepared (they obliged my request for medium rare) but a bit on the salty side. Flavors mingled well together, but again, it wasn't anything special. My friend had the seared ahi which was dreadfully overcooked past the point of rare. So sad, though well flavored and beautifully presented.  Food is probably 2 stars, maybe 3 at best.  Now the decor is quite special. It has that chic, nouveau rich feel incorporated with the pan asian influences. The view of the bay out the restaurant's enormous windows was spectacular as we knew it would be at Pier 33. But alas, it was not worth the markup on mediocre food.  Service was lacking and inattentive. I should have known it was a bad sign when we could walk right in for a table at 6:45 (even if it was a Monday night). But again, you're paying for the view, as I knew we would be.  Great location to catch the tourists who wander from Pier 39 and a great place for them to go and get a taste of the city, but it was mediocre to okay at best. Probably will not be coming back.",

We had the following food:  Carpaccio - This was okay...for some reason I thought carpaccio was the smoked ham thing...!? I guess i should stop drinking so much :) \u00a0Overall it was okay, the cream sauce was nice though, not too heavy...  Shortribs - soooo good...the meat was tender and straight fell off the bone!  Hangar Grilled Ponzu Steak w. potatoes au gratin - this was my actual entree, and shit it was GOOOD...the meat was done very well and wasn't overcooked like normal restaurants do when i say \"MEDIUM\" YES!!!  Seafood Crepe Special - looked pretty damn good and the crepe was good, but nothing screaming out at me..  Half a Dozen Oysters - small oysters but a very clean, fresh taste, and the hot sauce they gave you with it really put a nice kick in it, pretty good  Chicken Claypot - meh. \u00a0but the chicken was tender...if i want claypot probably would go to the crazy chinatown cafe thats all crapped out and dirty... hahaha  Poke Appetizer Field Greens Salad - These two were pretty standard, nothing too much to rave about!  Banana Lumpia with Coconut Ice Cream - I don't know how I feel about this one, only because I've had the same dessert @ PF Chang's (I KNOW...) and compared to that one this one fell a little short. \u00a0The ice cream was all melted by the time it came out because the banana lumpia was so hot, and they should have cut it in half cuz those suckers were HOT....I like PF Chang's version better - They have real coconut in the ice cream and everything is cut up in half and the ice cream is separated so it doesnt MELT! \u00a0Still good, but hey, a foodie ALWAYS has gripes. Ignore me. haha  Drinks:  Lychee Martini Pom Cosmo Ruby and Red  Jazzy Dragon  Cherry Blossom - ALL THEIR DRINKS WERE SOOOOO GOOD. \u00a0These are their cocktail specials, and I drank and loved every single one. \u00a0DYL for life? :)   Overall, I'm ready to return here for the filet mignon and more drinks! Nice location, view was kinda overrated but whatever... a nice ambiance, very nice server, and pretty much easy on the wallet (considering the amount of food we had!)  WOOT! 4 staaaars",

This was my first time at this waterfront location, having just seen it featured on Check Please Bay Area.   The space is beautiful - tall ceilings, excellent views; however the booth seats by the window face the restaurant and not the water. Odd. There was a normal table at the window that does face the water, but apparently that was specifically reserved by someone who probably knew about that table.   There was plenty on the menu that sounded delicious. Seeing the appetizers pass by, I realized the orders were huge. Luckily, my waitress told me I could order a small portion from the bar menu...and at happy hour prices! The Fire Fried Calamari were wonderful, especially with the ponzu marinated cucumbers. I also tried the Kalua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups which were OK. I still like my mom's home-cooked version better. For entrees, we had the Crispy Fried Thai Snapper and the Roasted Duck. I debated getting the Cowboy Steak, but there was no way I could eat 22 oz of meat. I'll have to save that for next time. The fried fish was a sight - the entire fish curled up and fried, filled with kimchee and served over chow fun and chinese sausage. The duck was tender and cooked perfectly.   For dessert, I had to try the Banana Bread Pudding and it was quickly devoured once it arrived on our table. All in all, I was totally satisfied with my meal and would definitely come back to try some of the other items on the menu.",

First, the atmosphere is incredible - spacious, inviting, with beautiful ocean views; second, the menu had numerous intriguing meals - tough to choose but the sashimi salad exceeded expectations (you should like a bit of wasabi heat); but best of all, our daughter, age 9, tired from running around the city, let out a stream of tears when she saw that her chicken tenders were not breaded. The wonderful waitress took note, served her pasta instead, and SF Chronicle-loved chef, Robert Lam, came out to check on her and our table. Butterfly is unbelievable - wonderful food, atmosphere and service along with a large side dish of heart.",

    "review_text": "Sometimes unusual circumstances lead you to a great find. From the outside this place looked modern and kinda like a club or something so we weren't so sure of the quality of their \"Asian fusion\" cuisine after looking through the menu posted outside, but what the heck... I needed to pee!   We were seated at a comfortable booth next to the glass windows looking over the pier. (.... hmmm.. not bad)   Then a small dish of Edamame smothered with Sesame oil and back &amp; white sesame seeds was brought to our table. (Ohhh yum! Maybe this place is good)   Then I saw a huge, thick cut steak on a sizzling plate passing by... (Darn, that looked good!)   By the time we saw the stake, we've already ordered fire fried calamari, garlic seared clam &amp; mussels and classic Caesar salad. I have never had fried calamari like this one before. Lightly fried and crispy, and not oily. Combination of the ponzu, thinly sliced cucumber, cilantro and the fried calamari were just perfect.   Soup of the mussels and clam dish was coconut based with hint of curry and it went perfectly with the seafood. Don't forget to soak your bread into the soup! It was very tasty dish.   Service was good too. The guy kept refilling my soda as I was very thirsty after watching a Giants' game in the hot sun. I was extra crispy just like their fire fried calamari :) After all, this place turned out to be a great place to sit down, looking over the pier, have some cocktails over yummy Asian fusion dishes.",

My wife didnt care for the real blue cheese crumbles, but, I agreed with the layers of taste, and the homage to the authentic buffalo via hanoi feel to the homage. The Calamari had a chipolte dressing that really worked. I thought that eating it would be easier with chopsticks, and, then I realized they were always on the table, I am a dufus. The view was impeccable. I had a living social coupon/dealio, and they welcomed it knowingly. Alcohol and food cost me 10 dollars with tip on my wife's birthday, bravo!",

    "review_text": "So the main reason why I went to Butterfly was they had listed on their brunch menu a 'wasabi bloody mary' - well this sounded wonderful, so I just had to make a trip and try it. \u00a0I ended up having free time on MLK day for a trip (which turned into a day of trying 5 bloody mary's - so I have lots to review), so me and a friend went to lunch.   Our calamari was awful, the breading just didn't taste right. \u00a0My fish was oily and nothing to write home about. \u00a0And my friends $12 burger was covered with grease, so much that the bun was greasy - not something you would expect from a nice restaurant. \u00a0  *****Bloody Mary Review*****  As mentioned, they serve a wasabi bloody mary. \u00a0Well, if there was wasabi in there, I couldn't taste it. \u00a0This bloody mary was a perfect example of something that didn't taste much like anything - it was just bland relative to most bloody mary's. \u00a0Can't say it tasted bad, but it was just 'eh'. \u00a0It came in a small hi-ball glass, which is a #1 no-no in my book. \u00a0 So the moral of the story, don't get fooled into thinking they serve a good bloody mary.   Leave this place for the tourists - from my experience, no reason to ever travel out to this restaurant.

Dessert: Banana Foster - I never eat this much fried food but this wasn't my pick. \u00a0I know we should have got the bread pudding or chocolate torte instead, but next time! \u00a0  What I loved the ABSOLUTE MOST is that I saved a ton of money on this meal using my <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">restaurant.com</a> coupon - which I bought for $8 - and the $100 min for the $50 coupon actually COVERED drinks! \u00a0I'll be back next month - and maybe a month after that - for the fish, ribs, salad and drinks!

Duck Confit Spring Rolls. Pretty good. I hate wasabi and the dipping sauce had wasabi in it. Killed my taste buds. Asked for soy sauce, much better. This is a good App.  Entree: I had the Macadamia and Blue Cheese Crusted Filet Mignon which comes with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes, Shimeji Mushrooms, Baby Carrots and Turnips, Red Miso Jus de Veau. As I said, I hate Wasabi. Switched it to Brown rice, much better. Steak was perfectly medium rare. BUT the vegetables were STRAIGHT UP RAW. Just so you know, RAW turnips taste like raw potatoes and it was SO BAD. My boyfriend ordered Five Spice Braised Beef Short Ribs. Not that good, have had much better at multiple restaurants. Sad.

It is also one of those restaurants you can hit up for multiple purposes: it's intimate and trendy and you could just as easily invite a date, a client or out-of-town guests.  I recommend the Pan Fried Shanghai Noodles and the Fire Fried Shrimp for apps. And in fact, I have been known to order only appetizers tappas-style for my whole meal because there are so many enticing options. Not that the entr\u00e9e options aren't wonderful as well. The cocktail menu is fun too, and their edamame with sesame seeds is my favorite in the city.  Lastly, I have to give them a callout for their service. Remembering that there is a large parking lot across the street, I called them recently when I was in a bind and needed to find last-minute parking for a very large trailer (a very difficult task in San Francisco). Despite the fact that I was not making a reservation, Heather went outside and searched the lot for the lot name, phone number and attendee while I waited on the phone. That's great customer service.

We wanted to like it and it sounded great, plus I really like Asian fusion food. \u00a0To begin with the room is dark and depressing, very utilitarian, no soul. Our server was very sweet but either completely inexperienced or should just be in a different line of work. My St Germaine elderberry martini was simply bad, just a shot of vodka with a splash of liquor, incorrect proportions and no mixing. Try Skates in Berkeley if you want to taste how it should be done, no comparison. The food was the most disappointing. We started with chicken wings that were good but not spectacular. Then came the Mirin glazed black cod, very disappointing and at a cost of $28. \u00a0It was a bland soupy sloppy dish, nothing like the glazed cod you get at some of the good Chinese restaurants. I ordered garlic noodles with kalua pig and was really looking forward to this dish. The noodles were fine, but the pork was probably added at the end and was barely warm. Basically we spent over $100 for chicken wings and some garlic noodles. We skipped desert. It's just another expensive, mediocre restaurant with a nice view.",

The service staff is friendly, attentive and can offer useful suggestions about the menu. The ambiance inside is clean, classy and elegantly understated. The prices are affordable, especially for Happy Hour. And most importantly, the food is amazing. The least impressive is the calamari and when your deep fried dishes are the least appealing you know you have a great menu on your hands. My personal go-to's are the sliders, the kahlua pig and the molten chocolate cake.  I have not a single bad thing to say about Butterfly and HIGHLY recommend it for ANY occasion.",

HOW IN THE HELL DO YOU RUN OUT OF CHICKEN @ 7:30PM on a SATURDAY!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? I don't understand.   So i ordered the \"loco moco style\" burger. It was grilled spam, a patty, ONE onion ring, 2 eggs and a bunch of mushrooms. What is missing? GRAVY!!!!! The loco moco style burger just became a regular burger with spam and egg in it. Very disappointing.  The full bar they 'claimed' they had. Didn't have midori liquor  Tomorrow i'm going to ONO'S HAWAIIAN BARBEQUE for a REAL loco moco.  Describe the place in one word?

And you'd really have to twist my arm to get me to collect the free dinners.  I had the displeasure of going here for dinner this evening. We had reservations and they were still a half hour late getting us seated. During this time we suffered through incredible noise - too many people shouting over the music, and the DJ trying to play over the crowd.  The entire wait-staff needs a good swift kick in the behind. Their attentiveness leaves much to be desired, since I had to actually wave one of them over to order a drink, and over the course of three hours, no one asked if I needed another. Overall service was very slow.  I ordered the filet mignon - one of my key metrics of any dining experience. The meat was tender but not particularly flavorful on its own. This dish could have been completely ruined by the blue cheese crusting, but I at least managed to scrape most of it off. \u00a0There's no need to complicate a good filet with blue cheese. I mentioned this fact to the flunky who came around asking how everything was - he just shrugged it off.   Dessert was merely adequate. Chocolate cake with a molten chocolate center. Tasted like any other food-service chocolate cake. Underwhelming. Buy the 12-pack at costco and save a ton of money.  Another annoying aspect of the evening was the 18% gratuity - far too high for the disservice inflicted upon us. They're not worth that much. This restaurant claims to sell excellence, thus I demand excellence. They fell far short of the mark.",

The food was great and service pretty good as well, and all in all a fun time was had!  Appetizers: edamame, duck confit spring rolls, calamari, kalua pig with butter lettuce cups. The edamame was about as dressed up as I can imagine edamame being. The duck confit spring rolls were nifty once I learned to stay clear of the spicy mustard sauce (lesson learned: read the menu). The kalua pig lettuce cups were great, but the real winner, the calamari, was DELISH. I could eat an entire meal of just that calamari. Had I not been there celebrating someone's 80th birthday, I would have licked that plate clean. It was meaty, it was salty-sweet with garlic/sesame/soy sauce goodness, and well, it was fried.   Lunch: I had the \"shaking beef\" cobb salad which was decent. I think this dish is definitely more western than Asian-inspired. I was expecting the latter, and was disappointed. I had a few bites of the snapper which filled me with order-envy. I also sampled the pan fried noodles, but there was also something distinctly... western about them.  Servers sometimes forgot our orders for sodas but in their defense we were a large party, and they were extremely patient and professional with our nagging seniors so kudos to them.",

The prices were a little high ($17 for a spam sandwich!), but not too high that it was OK since we were kinda stuck.   I had the Vietnamese fried fish sandwich (bahn-mi style) - good flavors, but the roll was a little too bready for my tastes. My husbad got the wing appetizer which was a little small, but had a good sweet-hot chilli sauce. You get cold edamame tossed with sesame seeds and Himalayan sea salt as your table munchies and they were tasty.

I went here once before, but it was for a friend's bday and they had closed the restaurant into a lounge/ club- no food. Drinks were yummy though! And of course beautiful view.   This time, Dine about Town!! =) $21.95 for a 3 course menu. Woot! Since there were four of us, we each ordered a different dish and shared everything. The apetizers were SOOOOOOOOOOO good!!! I liked the calamari and the duck spring roll. The salmon carpaccio was also really fresh and really good. Two of my friends don't eat raw- yay more food for me! haha =) The duck roll had a hint of wasabi inside but I wonder why they used that sauce for the spring rolls (it didn't compliment, tasted funky), but the spring rolls were yummy! The calamari wasn't like any other I've had- probably one of the best I've had!   For entree we shared the shaking beef cobb salad (my favorite!), the sandwich (it was huge!), smoked salmon salad on toasted bread (eh), and this breakfast/ brunch egg thing (too much egg, yuck!). Entree wasn't as yummy as their appetizer. I was dissapointed. For dessert we had the creme brule (it was ok) and warm chocolate torte with coffee ice cream. That was delicious! =) Mmmm!  All in all, I give Butterfly a 3.5-4 star. It was a pretty good experience over all but I would only go back for the appetizer and dessert, probably not for the entree. I was very stuffed after Lunch though, worth the $21.95/ person. Oh, the waiters are dumb!

    "review_text": "HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED (2 stars)  Disappointed. Read my novel below!!!!  Inventive idea for the food items, terrible service from the waiter, spent hard earnings on small portions, and left hungry. The only nice thing about the palce is that the SouChef/KitchenManager (some asian dude) uses his creativity to make the dishes (read my food descirption below) and he came out to talk to us when our waiter complete ignores us. He was kind enough to give us a description of our dish, how we liked it, are we okay, etc.   - FOOD, it was okay - PRICES, expensive and not worth it - SERVICE, waiter sucked but other kitchen staff were great - AMBIANCE, cute  Eat by obligation. Came here to use my livingsocial deal to spend $50 dollars worth of food. I don't know why I even bought that livingsocial deal. Let me tell, that deal wasn't even worth it, it either just covers a few appetizers. If we didnt have that voucher to use, the bill would have been around $100 and we left the place HUNGRY.  OUR SERVER SUCKED. We came on 6/20/12 around 7:45pm and was seated near the kitchen. We were given the menus and we starred at the menus for about 15 minutes already having an idea of what we wanted, menus closed and held in hand to give a hint \"we are ready to order\". Since we were by the kitchen we saw our server walk by us a gazillion times and kept saying to us \"will be right there\" and then finally came and took our drink and food order. And that's also when he decides to tell us about the specials. Shouldn't you tell us about the \"specials\" when you give us the menus so we can think about it. He dropped off two (small) glasses of water and shortly after appetizers. After our appetizers were done, our empty plates were just sitting on our table along side with our empty water. Nobody bothered to fill our drinks. I look around and EVERY table a bottle of water so i then asked \"Can we get a refill on our water? And can we get a bottle of water like everybody else?\" MUST WE ASK FOR SERVICE. Throughout dinner, he never bothered to swing by the table and see how we're doing and only came back to drop off the bill. FYI, other wait staff were the ones coming by and cleaning out table.  HEFFER-STYLE STATUS.  OYSTER SHOOTERS ($2 each) - We ordered two. Forgot to ask what kind of oyster it was. It was okay but prefer to eat the oyster by itself.  CALAMARI ($12) - very yummy. loved the presentation and paired will witht he sauce and veggies.  SOFT-SHELL CRABS ($18) - it was one of the specials. i knew in the back of my mind it is not going to be worth it. I WAS RIGHT. In my mind, this was worth maybe $6 bucks, not $18. the plate came out and it was pretty looking, it was two small soft shell crab cut in half (2 crabs/4 pieces) in some sauce and peaches. Was it good? the crab was kind of drenched in some saltiness that killed the taste of tasting the crab themselves.  ROASTED CHICKEN ROULADE ($22) - portions were kind of small. three pieces smaller then your palm of chicken roulade to your left and a small bowl of \"something\" to your right. chicken roulade was kind of on the salty side but the chicken meat was tender and packed with flavor. on the right the bowl of \"something\" had a poached egg, some green stuff, and some brown stuff ontop of broken rice. The broken rice tasted like coconut, they used coconut shavings or extracts to get that flavor. the pouched egg was cold and the brown stuff was fried chicken skin. It was interesting. I actually liked it more then the chicken roulade in a weird kind of way.  THAI SNAPPER ($37) - this was one of the specials. theh presentation was actually lovely. it's a fried whole fish and they bent the fish so when you unravel it there's noodles and vegetables. the fish itself was tasty BUT... way too many bones. every bite had like 3 bones. The experience of plucking bones out of your mouth just takes away from enjoying the taste of your fish.   Will I be back? NOPE.  Until the next review....",

Not only is it a great venue with great service but also it has very good Asian fusion food. I came by for a DAT lunch and the 2 courses were fantastic. Calamari was fried to nicely, lined-up beautifully on a narrow rectangular plate with a sauce. The Kalua pig lettuce wraps were refreshing yet richly flavorful. The fish entree was excellent as well, cooked perfectly. Seating is a little unorthodox to try to take advantage of the ocean view but very good place for long lunches.",

Butterfly does a great job of combining flavors and offering some unique dishes that I have not experienced at other restaurants.    We generally try to avoid tourist trap restaurants that can be pricey for the quality of food you get. Because of its proximity to the touristy attractions we had low expectations. We had taken our kids to the Marine Center and were returning to Hotel Vitale. Everyone was starving and we really needed a break. \u00a0The menu looked great and we took a chance. I am glad we did.  The decor was attractive and luxurious. The staff was friendly and accommodating. They sat us at a table with a view but off to ourselves, \u00a0since we had small children with us this made me feel comfortable and better able to enjoy the experience. The wok seared Shanghai wok seared garlic noodles were delicious and great for the kids. The Kalua Pig, and the fried snapper sandwich were also fantastic. We also enjoyed a deliciously fresh rare ahi.  The bar also looked lively and well stocked, this is a place that I enjoyed with my children and it was apparent that I could enjoy it while on a date with my husband or with girlfriends for cocktails and appetizers.",

The calamari though was incredibly tasty, served with a light sauce that complimented it perfectly. \u00a0We WILL be ordering the calamari next time (and every time) we dine here.  I ordered the cowboy steak which looked very exciting as it was served to me on sizzling skillet with chorizo, jalapeno's and other goodies. \u00a0My first few bites were \"eh\". \u00a0It tasted just like any other steak I've had. \u00a0I started scooping up the other items on my plate with the steak on my fork and it tasted good, but not amazing. \u00a0Probably on the 5th or 6th bites there were enough juices on the skillet to sop up with the steak which added to the flavor, but didn't really do it for me. \u00a0It felt like steak with chorizo (separate items) not steak AND chorizo (something blended into a single unifed dish). \u00a0I'll be trying something else next time we come here.  I don't plan on returning here soon (unless I get a craving for their awesome calamari), but I wouldn't say no if someone else wanted to try it out. \u00a0I do think it's worth a return visit to try something else, but I'll most likely be trying out other places.",

We ordered all appetizers cuz we were not really hungry (we had a big lunch!) Oyster Trio - oysters were fresh but the taste of the dish does not wow us, we'd say skip it. Oyster shooters - the bloody mary mix was GREAT, oyster is fresh but kind of small, so when you shoot it with the mix, the mix overpowers the little oyster. Garlic noodles - the noodles texture suggest freshly made noodles, but the taste is very plain..The squash is a bit too crunchy to me.. I'd say skip it. Fried Calamaris - great presentation but it's not crunchy. \u00a0I'd say skip it, my friend liked it though. Curry Mussels - best dish for me. \u00a0The mussels are huge and NOT overcooked which is very important to me.. lol.. \u00a0the sauce is great and the toasted bread are nice!! \u00a0Only bad thing is there are 2 mussels that did not open up and we are not supposed to eat it... wish they would check it before serving...

Located at Pier 33, the restaurant has large windows that look directly out at the waterfront. We were seated promptly and explained how the special holiday menu worked and what our different options were.   To start they brought out a nice amuse plate with an oyster shooter, kumamoto oyster with miso foam, a beet, chevre, and tangerine bite, and a cracker with horseradish and smoked salmon. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have any bread brought to the table to accompany dinner. I understand that normally they do not serve this at the restaurant, but I feel for a holiday like Thanksgiving dinner rolls seem appropriate.  For first course we had the option of a curried pumpkin soup or an endive and pear salad with walnuts and pomegranate seeds. Both were excellent. The soup was thick, rich, and absolutely delicious and the salad was light, crisp, and the cheese muffin on the side was a great addition.   The main course didn't have any other options than turkey with a ton of different sides. The meat itself was succulent. They gave a generous portion as well. There were a bunch of sides that I can't remember them all, but I do remember that the rice side was definitely the worst. It didn't have much flavor at all. The hash beneath the turkey was very good as was the mushroom sauce served over it. One of my dining companions dish was served a bit cold and the server made sure to correct this immediately.  For dessert there were three options: Apple Pie, Pecan Pie, and Pumpkin pie. We all got either the apple or pecan and neither of those were any good. They tasted and looked like store bought desserts.   There were a few minor misses over the course of the meal, but overall I was quite pleased with our holiday dinner. I would definitely love to come back and try out Butterfly's regular menu.",

However the chef came multiple times throughout our meal and t urned my opinions around.   Since we were there to try new food, We got the Acai lemonade, Lychetinni for drinks. Shrimp Bisque and Onion soup for appetizers, The gf's 22oz steak and the yellowfin tuna for the main. The lemonade came and gave quite a kick of sour flavor as the lemon and acai flavors mixed. The lychetinni also had a small kick while drinking and seemed to be more like finely blended lychee. Either way, both drinks were quite amazing concoctions \u00a0by the bartender.  The appetizers, French onion soup &amp; Shrimp bisque. The Onion soup arrived as a bowl with a layer of cheese ontop that had melted over and seeping along the sides. Looking kind of odd, we pierced through the cheesy layer and tasted the soup. oddly enough, the layer of cheese accented the soup nicely. The Shrimp bisque on the other hand came as a puff pastry in a small dish. We were somewhat unsure about what this exactly was. attacking the dish, it ended up having the shrimp bisque right below. I believe there was about 9 pieces of shrimp included which is a lot more than i had expected. overall, the Shrimp \u00a0Bisque was the better of the two in my opinion.   onto the main course(s)! The 22oz steak came on a sizzling plate and well... its steak. Was pretty good and there was quite a bit left over. 22oz is a lot of meat. As for the Yellowfin, it was a very different experience than \u00a0the steak. the yellowfin came ontop of black rice with calamari hidden inside. There were also two stuffed mushrooms which were placed on top of a neon green sauce. i asked for the yellowfin to be pan seared and it came out perfectly so. The rice was delicious and the calamari inside was a nice surprise within every other bite. As for the stuffed mushrooms, i was a little confused on how the chef was able to bring out the bright neon color and the weird taste (in a good way!). After the chef visited our table a few times, he revealed that it was his own creation mixing wasabi and lime as the primary ingredients.   Setting = great \u00a0(i mean its waterfront, how could it not?) food = excellent Chef &amp; waiters = amazingly kind",

Our party of six showed up on time for a 7:30 reservation and were told that there was no reservation even though it had been phoned in earlier in the week and reserved with a credit card. They subsequently found the reservation but said that it had been cancelled. We were told to wait a few minutes. 35 minutes later we were seated at a table that had been empty for 15 minutes. There was very minimal in the way of apology. The food was the same as I recall, nothing unique or imaginative in terms of standard pan-Asian fare, but tasty. The problem was the incredibly slow service. We waited over an hour for appetizers. In all we were not out of the restaurant until 11:30 (four hours). Luckily it was a birthday with good friends so it did not bother us too much. As a caveat. be aware this seems to be a special occasion type of place for birthdays and the like. There must have been three tables of 10 or so people shrieking and yelling during the evening. It is a loud space to begin with. Do not go here for a quiet romantic evening.

No offense, it's suppose to be soup-not french onion flavored bread pudding.   Our hangar steak was way too stringy and cold! Medium rare means a little pink, not blood on the plate either. I understand there were 16 of us which was about half the clientele that night but having cold steak is not palatable and I picked on my friend's red snapper. He ended up picking at the snapper and eating the butter lettuce cups and veggies separately. From the description, he didn't think it was a lettuce wrap and the sight of him dropping food all over himself was priceless though.   Dessert was yet another disappointment. The creme brulee was suppose to be the highlight of our meal and upon the inaugural \"crack\" of the top, the spoon just stuck to the slightly burned sugar. Mmmm...not cool. I was disappointed yet again. I understand they might have been trying to save time and chilled for much longer than expected after torching.   The service was phenomenal though so I can't really knock down too many stars. Our one server did a spectacular job delivering round after round of martinis, water, and silverware replacements. She even put up with the one loud mouths drunken spewings. God bless her for putting up with us. I almost wanted to apologize for their displays of barbaric alpha male posturing. But she remained poised throughout the 3 hour service.   Overall, I wouldn't come back. Service was excellent but the food couldn't \u00a0save this review for them.",

Megan, i hope there were some serious repercussions for your actions. \u00a0Mr. Bald Manager Sir, thank you for helping, but i still feel like i (or my company) but more specifically i, should be compensated for all of this (i.e. a dinner for 2 on the house plus all the martinis i can possibly handle) because i should tell you, we still ended up paying six thousand (yes, SIX THOUSAND) dollars for a dinner that DID NOT satisfy my requests. \u00a0sorry for the rambling, but i had to share.",

The spring rolls seemed a bit heavy, but the summer rolls were light and summery. The gnocchi, red snapper, and hanger steak as main dishes are solid choices. But they won't leave you itching to come back immediately. By the time you reach dessert, you'll be stuffed. But the chocolate cake with coffee ice cream will still sound appetizing. It's good, but I've had better.  For drinks, the Cherry Blossom, Palm Cosmo, and White Sake Sangria are extremely sweet so be prepared for a sugar rush. The Sumojito is refreshing though.

It is quite expensive here. Their entree is not totally amazing- but their appetizers are. In fact, they have a wider selection of appetizer than they do entree.   We had oyster shoot for appetizer: good but the oyster doesn't seem too fresh.   Pulled pork with butter lettuce: it was ok. I think the pulled pork was a bit bland and not really the best cut of meat in general. The hoisin sauce helped, and if you like pulled pork, then you should try this.   I had the duck for the entree and it was very good. I would recommend this if you come here. The cuts are small but enough. It was very tender and cooked medium rare. It was paired with the cherry sauce and other berries that gave the duck more dimensions.  My bf had the fillet mignon and he thought it was ok. Nothing very amazing.   If you are feeling extra good- you should try their desserts too. Their creme brulee is wonderful!!",

I made reservations several days in advance &amp; had requested a table with a nice view as we are hosting good friends from london. When we arrived it took several minutes for the hostess to even greet us. Then she said \"I know u asked for a view, but we don't have one available right now would you mind waiting for a little bit we have a table that is very close to being done.\" we were fine to wait a bit no worries. We then go to wait at the bar &amp; figured we would get cocktails. This is when things went from ok to really poor service. The bartender did not even acknowledge our presence. The longer we waited the more frustrated we got. After 15 minutes we were calling other restaurants to check for availability. The bartender still had not made an attempt to even pretend to acknowledge us - not even a simple \"hi I'll get to u as soon as I can\"... Finally the hostess came to check on us &amp; we asked - does this end of the bar not get service? The hostess looked surprised &amp; at that time the bartender came over to us as if she hadn't just ignored us for 20 minutes &amp; asked what we would like to have. At that point we walked out. Which was the best decision of the night.   We decided to try Waterfront which we have been to several times. As soon as we walked in we knew it was the right decision. The service was fantastic &amp; they were able to accommodate right away. The food was superb! All in all we ended up having a wonderful evening &amp; dinner.   We will never go to butterfly again.

Overall we had a great experience and everyone had a good time. The staff seated us promptly at a large table/booth next to the open kitchen. We ate, drank, talked and laughed for almost 2.5 hours and did not feel rushed at all by the staff.   We took advantage of the dine about town menu, which included an appetizer, main course and desert for about $22. My sis had been here before, so she recommended we all choose our appetizer and share it. This way we could try all 3 apps. Of the 3, the fried calamari and duck spring rolls were the best, while the fresh salmon roll w/strawberries was okay (it was an interesting combo). The portions are very generous and fresh. I also had a lychee mimosa that was okay too. Also, ordered a couple bottles of vino, which were very good. Not a drop left.  I ordered the shaking beef salad. It was good, but I wasn't in love with it. There were only 3 bite-sized cubes of beef (a bit tough) over greens with bits of bacon, a poached egg, cherry tomatoes, bleu cheese chunks, ham, etc. I could've just eaten the appetizers and been satisfied. I could not finish my salad, which has never been a problem for me. I did try a bite of the shrimp and scrambled eggs tostada. WOW! I wished I had ordered that, it was piping hot and tasty. My mom had the chicken salad club w/fries, it was huge! They used texas toast, so the bread was about 2 inches thick w/ a filling stuffed full of chicken chunks.  My little niece ordered from the children's menu and had a mini cheese pizza and a bowl of hot, crispy fries along with cranberry juice and vanilla ice cream for desert. She was in heaven!   Lastly, for desert there were 2 selections, creme brulee and molten chocolate cake w/coffee ice cream. By this time, I was so full I just skimmed the crunchy brown sugar layer from the top of the brulee (my favorite part) and ate only a bit of the custard.   I will go back for the duck spring rolls and to try other dishes. The dine about town special ends on June 15th, so if you're in the area I recommend checking this place out. Even when that special ends, it is still worthwhile to stop in for the food. Even better if you can get a seat next to windows with a gorgeous view (better for smaller groups). Afterwards, you can take a stroll down to pier 39 to take in the fresh air.",

This stop still leaves a poor taste in my mouth due to the fact we were on our honeymoon and it basically ruined that last two days of the most important trip of our lives. I stated way to stay classy because not only did we not recieve a sorry or any gesture of apology but they deleted our post and it's no longer available to see! No worries, I have to review saved on my computer and will repost daily, not only on here but on my Facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. nothing in the world is worse then the feeling of being discriminated against be it race, sex, age.",

PLUSES: +Modern Decor &amp; Nice Bay View +Good Service +Well-made Cocktails +Tasty Oyster Shooters +Macadamia-crusted Filet Mignon  MINUSES: -Duck Confit Spring Rolls &amp; Shrimp/Green Papaya Salad were lackluster. -Portions are not Hungry-Man sized by any means. -CPB (Cost Per Bite) Ratio subsequently on the high side.  All things factored, Butterfly is a solid 3.5 Stars. Not bad, but given the stiff competition in SF...nuff said.",

The food: I had the seared diver scallops with curry, orange, risotto. It was beautifully presented and tasted great. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the curry was subtle enough. The risotto was creamy and had a bite to it, which I like. For dessert I had the chocolate torte with coffee ice cream. It was decadent, the middle basically warm dark chocolate batter...yes. Overall, a great experience.   The view makes it even better; the restaurant is right on the pier, so going during sunset is ideal!",

    "review_text": "What a shocker! I always would pass by this restaurant when I used to work on the wharf. I always said to myself, \"here's another asian fusion restaurant, well yippe kayo kaye...bring on another variation of the spring roll.\" Finally, my sister calls me up and feels like eating lunch at one of those \"dine about town\" joints. Dine ABout Town happens in january when business is slow and they try to attract other people by having 3 course meals for 20 bucks (Lunch). Nothing really seemed appealing, however my sis said maybe we should give Butterfly a try. I reluctantly agreed. Once we arrived, we sat on a table right next to the window which had a beautiful ocean view. The service is average, nothing that really stands out. However, the food is another story. Everything down to my diet coke was awesome. I am not kidding about my soda, it had a little kick to it. For appetizers we ordered the firecracker calamari and the duck egg rolls...great ...another rendition of a spring roll right? Both platters were excellent...the calamri had a nice kick to it and had a tangy sauce which complimented the squid well...the duck rolls were very tasty as well...it came with a mustard sauce which went well with the roll. For entree, I had the kobe beef burger...hands down, ONE AWESOME BURGER!!!My mom and sis had a fish platter which also was very good. The fish came in a small pan, sizzling and came with veggies and steamed rice, a light and mostly healthy dish. What I also like about this restaurant is that it doesn't skimp out on the size. You would think this restaurant would give you small portions because the way it looks, but it gives you a good amount of food. Butterfly was a great experience. The service good be a little better, but other than that, the food is delicious, the portions are decently size, the location is awesome. Great Job!",

    "review_text": "I hate edamames and now I love them. The free edamames at Butterfly are so freakin good. They are slathered with peanut oil, sprinkled with black and white sesame seeds, and salted with tiny Hawaiian Pink Salt. Fancy!  Butterfly is a nice waterfront restaurant on Embarcadero. The glass window wall is really quite impressive. We got a nice window seat for dinner but since it was night all we could see was darkness, maybe a twinkling boat under the moon, feather debris, lost birds, and water below. Since I'm not a swimmer, it was scary and enigmatic at the same time. But pretty cool overall. Butterfly has an array of mixed matched lighting (all the colors of the rainbow!), flat screen tvs, an open kitchen and a tiny bar. Buddha greets you at the door and the smell of incense from I don't know where is really quite powerful.  Service is slow and cold at Butterfly. From the time we sat down to the time we got glasses of water, it took Butterfly 24 minutes. In that 24 minutes, we had been feasting on salty delicious edamames and I had already been served a lycheetini (which was just okay- Dragon Rouge lychee drinks are so much better). Water should have been carried out with my bar drink. Instead, I had something to quench my thirst while my friend did not.  The fire fried calamari was just okay. It was served in a small bowl and not too oily. Our main dishes were the ahi tuna plates. The tuna was a decent portion of fish, perfectly cooked medium rare. It was sitting on the perfect onion ring IMO. The onion ring was so tasty and it served as a container for baby scallops, bean sprouts, carrots, and celery. The reduction sauce sprinkled with micro greens glazing the plate was so delicious and was a great pairing to the tuna. The presentation of this dish was really fantastic.  Dessert was banana bread pudding and we each had our own. It was totally not what I expected but surprisingly out of this world. The banana bread which was more like a warm muffin was served on a triangular plate sprinkled with powdered sugar and dotted with flambeed bananas and a crumble of macadamia brittle. The banana bread was topped with macapuno ice cream and together it was so so good. It was warm too.  I want to give Butterfly 4 stars but I just feel they didn't care to be on their A game. With prices this high and all the SF competition, Butterfly needs to brush up on their service if they want to be considered a top contender. Based on the location alone, Butterfly vs. Houstons, Houstons wins TKO.",

I thought the flavor of the tuna tartar was not distinct enough, a bit too much sesame oil, and a few bites tasted funny, I couldn't say the tuna was not fresh because I didn't get sick but, the thought of tuna being not so fresh definitely was there. We liked the garlic noodle, it was tasty and not too greasy, light, in fact, I wish they used bokchoy instead of \u00a0broccoli.  I had whole crispy red snapper as main course, it was beautifully presented, and the fish was done right. But it tasted bland, it would've been better if it had been marinated or brushed some sauce on it, it came with chowfun and some vegetables in a thin sauce that the flavor was hard to identify other than being sweet. My dish cost $36, although the fish was big. My husband order pork loin, I had only 1 bite so all I could say was it was tender.  We order creme brulee for dessert, the caramel on the top was burnt so it tasted very bitter. We regretted not sending it back.  Overall I think the place is overpriced for its quality , but of course it's on Embarcodero right on the water, you pay for that.",

I've been coming to Butterfly for years, I've always had a different experience each time -- and it always centered around the hostess upon check-in (not so good). This is a big contrast from the bar experience where the Manager appeared welcoming, friendly and attentive (thank you for offering us drinks!) The hostess: \u00a0Not so much!   We had reservations set for a specific time, and because one of our guests arrived a few moments late, she gave our window table to another group WITHOUT a reservation. \u00a045 minutes later, she made up for it by giving us the best table in the house next to the water. \u00a0Okay, so it was a nice spot, but we had to wait an awful long time. \u00a0   Our Rating:   - Hostess: 1 - Advice: \u00a0Please brush up on your host skills, and be mindful of your paying customers. It is not okay to keep giving one excuse after the next. \u00a0You lost me after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd excuse on why we had to wait 45 mins when we had a reservation.  - Food Service: \u00a02 - Slow, slow, slow! Some dishes came out faster than others. \u00a0 - Entree: \u00a03.5 - The kitchen kept us waiting for quite some time, so by the time the \u00a0food came, it was just an \"okay experience\". \u00a0They haven't changed up the menu over the years. - Dessert: \u00a03 - \u00a0For a first timer, it would rate a 4-5, but a repeat over a 5-year period -- ehhh, just okay since the selections have not changed much :( - Bar Manager / Ambience: \u00a05 - I should have stayed at the bar!!

The promoters allowed us to go inside early yay... and we chilled by the bar, had a few drinks like \u00a03 Wisemen, Beautiful, Don Julio shots :)  They were fast moving people out of the dinner scene to clean up. By 10PM it was empty. Dance floor was small bout they do have an outside smoking area that views the pier.  Overall, good time. Would recommend for the nightlife. Not sure about the restaurant scene. Azn fusion food usually not up to my standards and overpriced...no thanks :)   [Positivies]: attractive interior, clean bathrooms at first (after a few hours nope lol), great view of the pier, outdoor smoking area,   [Negatives]: Small dance floor, there was a white girl bartender who didn't give good service lol, 2 stalls in women's bathroom,",

The complementary edamame are done well too, they're non-traditional in that they're cold and marinated in sesame oil but I liked them.  Coming back for the lettuce wraps!

If you're a fan of lemongrass, this is a must order!

Salmon; tuna; shaped avocado nuggets, wedges of grapefruit, wasabi cream sauce along w/ fried wonton skins! If you like sashimi, this is a must order b/c it's really terrific! \u00a0- 5 STARS  BANANA BREAD PUDDING: \u00a0I first thought...how good can banana bread pudding be?! Order one to end your meal and you'll get to know the answer first hand!!! I had major foodgasm!! \u00a0- \u00a05 STARS  LYCHEETINI: \u00a0The best lychee martini I've ever had. How many places you know use fresh lychee puree?! \u00a0- 5 STARS  This place exceeded my expectations in every way possible.

My wife ordered the Cherry Blossom, which was quite good and later the Peach Margarita, which was not very good. \u00a0Later we both ordered salads and they were both pretty good. I got the Field Greens and my wife got the Fig Salad. \u00a0My wife got a Bloody Mary Oyster Shooter too and thought it was pretty good. \u00a0  For our mains I got the Cowboy Steak and my wife got the Surf and Turf. \u00a0My steak was cooked perfectly for me, but part of it had gristle hidden in it. \u00a0I managed to find most of the gristle and fat and trim it, but every once in a while I would find another section. \u00a0The fires that came with it were crispy outside, but the inside was kind of grainy and not very good. \u00a0One of the things I liked best about my dish was the truffle butter on top, which was great. \u00a0My wife said her Surf and Turf was good (they did her steak perfect, which is sometimes hard), but nothing special. \u00a0We ended up easily taking half of my steak home with us because it was so huge. \u00a0We decided not to do desert because we were so full even though the skillet cookie looked very good. \u00a0  I was torn between a three and four star review and decided on the three because even though everything was OK, I'm not sure I would feel the need to go back. \u00a0Maybe I'd go to the bar and try the Lettuce Cups and some drinks if we got another deal.",

Edamame with Sesame Oil topped with Sesame Seeds. This came while we were awaiting our courses. I thought it was alright, not really a fan since I felt like it was drenched in oil and a bit on the heavy side.  Kalua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups, Hoisin Barbeque Dipping Sauce, Brunoise Peppers and Toasted Cashews. Appetizer from prix fixe. I thought this was alright, but a bit oversalted. The texture of the pork was alright kind of reminded me of moist pork sung though. The butter lettuce was fresh and delicious, it definitely helped to lighten the oversalting of the pork a bit. The portion size was pretty good as I ended up taking about half of it home.   Shaking Beef Cobb Salad with Poached Egg, Prosciutto, Maytag Blue Cheese and Bacon. The beef was similar to the Korean style BBQ short rib meat, so it was pretty good. I wished the poached egg was a bit more runny, it was too overcooked for me. I did like the addition of the prosciutto to the salad but overall, I don't think it was anything special. The portion size for it was pretty decent though since I also took about half of this home.   I also had some of my friends' Fire Fried Calamari and Scrambled Egg and Shrimp Tostada. The calamari was alright but nothing to write home about. The tostada, from the taste that I had, I did not like at all and I am glad that I didn't order that. I don't think my friend liked it either since he didn't finish it. Him and my other friend ended up sharing the Chicken Salad Club Sandwich that she ordered which from what I heard was pretty good, but it looked a bit on the dry side to me.   I must admit the service for this restaurant was very subpar, I definitely expected better of a restaurant of this caliber. The service was worst out of all the restaurants I've been to on the Embarcadero. We waited about 10-15min after sitting down to receive waters and recognition from our server. Not cool, I say. Also, my server didn't get my appetizer and entree boxed up for me. I ended up boxing them myself at my table, I'm sorry if I expected a bit more from a restaurant with these prices on the Embarcadero, especially since the food isn't THAT great. \u00a0-1 star for service.",

Walking up towards this place and not knowing that it was an asian fusion restaurant. I noticed the sign that read \" Kids Menu\" I thought to myself... \"wtheezy?\" What on earth does this place have in store for little ol' me? The minute we walked in we were greeted with ......  A.) Hi, how are you guys doing? How many? B.) Can i help you? hand on the hip gesture*  Can you guess?   So the answer was B). So of course immediately, i thought it was closed for some private party but then later we were asked after we blankly stood there. After seating us down, the host kindly told us that we had an hour to eat. why?.... because this place turns into an after-hour lounge/club.   What a good way to ease some tension than a glass of Schrambergs Mirabelle. To start off, we had the half shell oysters that i thought was okay. For the entree i had the \"kal bi\" which was the pork chops. Where i thought it was delish! My friend who had the kobe steak medium rare was even better. I would definitely recommend both.   To top everything off we had the chocolate molten cake with a side of cinnamon ice cream. Now that was definitely my favorite!!   I can't wait to come back here and try everything on the menu. The next time i come here i'm going to order \"two\" of that chocolate molten cake because that was definitely the \"ish.\"   Overall, the great food compensated for the rude host but then again our server was tremendously nice. The ambiance was also sweet with the view of the pier. Although, i came during the night time. I'm anxious to see how it would look like during the day time.",

The tuna was completely cooked to the point where it looks and taste like a $1.00 can Tuna!! Can we say bumblebee can tuna??? My friend liked the braised pork but the rice under the pork was absolutly under cooked, to the point where it still taste 80% raw. On top of the bad food, it takes about half an hour to get a drink, I highly suggest you order 2 drinks at once. It might look like you are a minor alchoholic but at least you won't have to wait.

In the past I was a big fan of the sashimi bowl with black rice - tons of fresh fish (varied selection too, hamachi, salmon, tuna) served on a warm bed of rice, lightly dressed with a soy-based sauce and some vegetables, but I haven't seen it on the menu lately - hope they bring this one back.  The kahlua pig with butter lettuce is always a hit, as the pork is perfectly tender, well seasoned and served with a nice spicy hoisin sauce. \u00a0Also tried some vietnamese-inspired chicken wings this past time, which are served with the drumstick still connected to the wing - my favorite way. \u00a0They have great flavor, a good amount of heat for the casual wing enjoyer (I prefer tons of heat but for a nice restaurant, that stuff doesn't really fly) and balanced with some sweetness in the glaze, served with some pickled vegetables akin to that in bahn mi, and bleu cheese crumbled on top - and that's my one critique of the dish. \u00a0The bleu cheese didn't add anything for me except an unnecessary heaviness; just takes away from the flavors and is fairly out of place in the dish. \u00a0My comrades thought differently of it however so try with and without, thankfully it's just crumbled so you can brush it aside.  For the mains I've tried many things, and never been disappointed. \u00a0The duck is great, always well prepared and flavorful, as is the chicken roulade (i avoid ordering chicken like the plague, but this one was pretty solid) served with lap chong, some rice, a fried egg (perfectly cooked - love it runny), some bak choy and other veggies. \u00a0Very strong, earthy flavors in the dish, and though I'm not too big on those bold earthy dishes generally, this one was nice, and the egg really balanced it out. \u00a0We also tried the whole fried fish of the day which, to our luck, was snapper (thai snapper i believe). \u00a0Usually when we ask they have some non-fry-friendly beast, but this time we won. \u00a0It was sort of a pan-asian dish, with kim chee, lap chong, and some roasted peppers in a soy/chili sauce. \u00a0The fish was well cooked, tail/fins crispy, and plenty of meat on them bones. \u00a0One problem with it - there was a bit too much flour used so the result was a bit powdery/chalky texture in some parts.  Overall a great place - some very minor critiques here and there but for the money it's well worth it. \u00a0Fantastic (strong) cocktails and a great setting/ambiance really round this place out.",

Probably one of the the best interiors of a restaurant in the city. The staff was attentive, gave great service, and were generally interested in providing a high level of service.   What fell short here was the food. The presentation of the food was visually right on-I really really really wanted to like it alto.   1) Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll-this was the star of the night. It was good, good value at $10. Not the best Ive had but good, solid.  2) Garlic Noodles-they weren't bad, they just weren't great. Not a $9 noodle plate.  3) Duck Spring Rolls-meh. Holy Wasabi!!! Nothing mentioned wasabi on the menu.  4) Macadamia crusted Blue Cheese Filet-this was the big disappointment of the night. $28-I would expect something really friggin good! It was nicely presented. I so wanted to like it. But the mash potatoes were grainy(suspect under cooked potatoes), Ordered the steak medium rare. The steak was near REALLY rare (which was ok just not what I ordered). The blue cheese was overwhelming but the meat was bland, no seasoning gave it's life for the steak!, and the macadamia nuts were floating in the blue cheese(not crusty, browned, or cooked) and could NOT be tasted over the blue cheese. The veggies had there own sauce and were actually quite good. Over all this dish was the super disappointment of the night. Blahhhhh   The only other thing was our table had gum under it...beautiful restaurant, good staff, very average food for high prices, gum under the table...   We had a living social coupon so it was for sure worth the effort but probably not worth a return visit.",

    "review_text": "This is going to sound harsh, but its because I really enjoyed this restaurant and I think they have so much potential to be great if they fixed a few small areas.  We had their 4-course set menu. First dish: Spring rolls with salmon, strawberry and nouc mam?!? Its an odd combination but it was delicious and refreshing. Then the flavored edamame, calamari, and another fried roll. All were very very good.   I ordered the snapper for entree. It took over 45 mins after the last appetizer was served. \u00a0By this time I was no longer hungry. Their appetizer portions are big! The entree came out, and it looked very good. I understand they want to be generous with their food, but no way could someone finish all this. It makes it almost less appetizing when you serve in such large portions, especially when your restaurants concept is fine dining. Then came desert, creme brulee very nicely done, not too sweet and perfect sugar crust on top.  Service is top notch. They are so attentive and willing to make your experience memorable. The waitress overheard our conversation and catered to us immediately.   The chef needs to portion and pace the guests stomachs. After sending 4 appetizers you get pretty full. Then hitting you with french onion soup, your entree, AND dessert will burst you. Also has to work on his timing. However, his flavor combinations are great. So $40 for a brunch? Its alright, better save it for dinner when you are really hungry.",

He was cute, but RUDE and totally unattentive. It took him forever to help us, and when he did, he took it upon himself to give us a lil' lesson in Restaurant 101 - After asking why the hell our food hadn't come out after an hour and a half, he said \"Well, ma'am, we usually clear the FIRST course before bringing the second\". \"REALLY??? GEE, I'm sorry! Apparently I don't get out that much, cause I don't understand THAT GEM of knowledge. Maybe I shouldn't have left my CAVE today! Thanks, JERK!\" Which leads me to  3. SLOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW. And slow for no good reason! A RARE burger and AHI TUNA, cold shrimp and boiled noodles took an hour and a half? And they forgot all the flavor to boot! 4. No free refills?!?!?! Isn't carbonated water and syrup, like, the cheapest thing in a restaurant? Please...  5. And the crap on top of crap, we had more than 6 people in our party. So, with our bad lunch came the automatic, undeserved, 18%!   Maybe they were having an off day, but I'm not going back to find out.",

The location itself is beautiful. The interior probably looked super cool and modern when it first opened, but now it seems a little tacky. Still, there are dim lights at dinner time and feels like a nice hotel bar, which isn't the worst. If you're lucky enough, try and get a seat by the large windows! You'll get a great view of the Bay, even at night.  Soooo onto food! I got the Roasted Chicken Roulade, which was a decent sized portion. Sometimes at restaurants like these, I really just expect a sliver of meat or something snack-sized. Not at Butterfly! I couldn't finish my chicken.  The Ahi Poke Rice was also sooo good and bigger than I had expected. You could probably only split it with like four people max, though.  Ummm that's it. They were really good about refilling waters.

The bartenders were two young people that were on their game. \u00a0We ended up entertaining the guy by himself who was trying to strike up conversations with them and it was very busy. \u00a0So when he left after about his 7th Manhattan, they compt us our next round for keeping him busy.

When we looked at the menu, it was a brunch menu, so we were confused at first, and then figured they must be still having brunch. As a vegetarian, there are SLIM pickings here for me, but there was a scrambled egg dish on the menu that was pretty much the only meat-free item, so I chose that. When we ordered, I was then informed that they aren't serving brunch anymore and we were given the wrong menu. We weren't then offered a lunch menu from the waiter, who was still waiting to take our order, so we had to ask what the lunch menu consisted of. He told us \"pretty much the same thing as the brunch menu, except for the item you ordered isn't available.\" So I then asked for one of the sandwich items on the menu, and was told it also wasn't available because it had a fried egg on it. \"So there are no eggs offered anymore?\" (since there were at least 5 dishes on the brunch menu that contained eggs). \"Well, we can make poached egg dish but that's it.\" Seems bizarre, since you'd have to crack the egg to poach it, but can't make a fried egg, and also can't show us a lunch menu so we know what we can actually order?   I ended up getting the mushroom sandwich that wasn't all that great at all. My friend had a sandwich that contained probably half a jar of mayonnaise in it.

According to the waiter, the poke was a poke contest winner in the bay area(?). Everything was really good. The tuna poke, wasn't really that impressive, but they put a wasabi pancake on top of it which makes it interesting. However this makes the wasabi taste inconsistent since you get a small hint of it or a BIG surprise. The pig was very tender, like pulled pork actually. For entree we got the hangar steak kalbi style, seared ahi tuna, rack of lamb and a fish. The food was definitely delicious and everything came out really well, but I'm still not a fan of asian fusion (being asian myself). I do have very high standards for asian fusion food. Although everything was good, it wasn't super delicious. Some of the flavors they blended together just doesn't go right together like the hangar steak kalbi style. The sauce actually didn't have much flavor to it, but to keep my steak nice and juicy.",

The atmosphere and service were really good too - the chef even came to our table to see how we were enjoying the food! It is on the pricey side when it's not done about town time, but it's worth it for a date or special occasion, especially considering the views and location. Would definitely recommend it and come back again sometime!",

    "review_text": "This review is based NOT on Butterfly being a restaurant and its food, but as Butterfly as a club venue. It is also not a review of the specific DJs who were spinning the night of 11/8/08. This review is based on my friends and I ordering a VIP booth for the night when the restaurant turned into a club. \u00a0First of all, Butterfly's website said there would be a DJ spinning this night 7-11 p.m. \u00a0That's an odd, early time, but a lot of us show up a bit after 7 p.m. expecting to find a club internally adjacent to the restaurant. But it turns out the DJ on the website is spinning just for dinner patrons. \u00a0The bartender tells us that the restaurant turns into a club sometime between 9-10:30 p.m. \u00a0The transformation into a club seems to based on how many people are eating dinner. \u00a0The whole timing thing is confusing. \u00a0So my friends and I wait at the bar and drink. \u00a0Around 10-10:30 the waitstaff does start moving tables from the restaurant floor into the back. \u00a0People are still eating, so this is kind of a strange sight. \u00a0My friends and I want to sit at a booth for when the place turns into a club. \u00a0We are informed that we have to buy a bottle of alcohol for a minimum of $125 for 4 people. We agree to this. \u00a0Then we are told, once seated, \u00a0that actually there is a a minimum of $250 bottle fee for a booth. \u00a0Which means we can either buy two $125 bottles of champagne of at least one bottle of anything that costs $250. \u00a0The VIP booth drink menu, which I am holding in my hand and showing to our host, does say one bottle per 4 people but nowhere does it state that there is a $250 minimum for a booth. \u00a0So we are sucked into ordering two bottles. \u00a0Then later, our host, the corkage woman, seems to change her mind and we only have to order one bottle. \u00a0It's also unclear if we can have, say, 1 or 2 more people come to our VIP booth or if there is some extra amount we have to pay. \u00a0The menu also said we were supposed to receive some juices of our choice to mix with our alcohol. \u00a0We ordered orange juice to make mimosas. \u00a0The orange juice never arrived. \u00a0That orange juice in my opinion was the most expensive damn orange juice any of us have ever ordered in our lives and we were cheated out of it. \u00a0One of the stupidest parts of this is that there were about 10 booths roped off for VIP use. \u00a0We were only one of two groups who ordered a booth. \u00a0So there were 8 empty booths behind the ropes. \u00a0The people dancing, who paid $20 cover charge to get in, had nowhere to sit down. \u00a0What club has no seats for anyone to sit down? \u00a0That's not good for a club that gets 200 people in it. \u00a0The burly well-dressed men who were charged with guarding us were very nice and kept an eye on us and our belongings lest some poor soul try to pass the rope and sit at our booth or any of the many empty booths. \u00a0I give the VIP guards 5 stars for being vigilant and polite to us. \u00a0But overall I think Butterly as a club is all about greed and bad service in its attempt to have a VIP section. \u00a0The rules change based on bait and switch and inconsistency, and misinformation is their stategy. \u00a0And get this, there was a $43 gratuity surcharge per bottle we ordered, and they also charged tax on the alcohol. \u00a0So what we thought was going to be $125 plus maybe a $20-25 tip to our waiter turned into almost $350 for 4 people for what amounted to 2 glasses of champagne per person, and they didn't give us the orange juice,and this just so we could sit at a booth and not have to stand the whole time. \u00a0The DJs who spun that night, by the way, were friendly and did shout outs to people for their birthdays. \u00a0It's Butterfly itself as a club venue I recommend to never ever attend.",

Every dish was a spectacular mix of unexpected flavors, from our appetizers (strawberry and ahi roll and salmon tempura roll) to our entrees (crab stuffed chicken marsala and scallops/steak surfNturf). The cocktails were also delicious, even my non-alcoholic lemonade spritzer concoction.

Menu:  Limited menu perhaps its whats in season. By the way the menu is printed it appears that the menu changes often but I forgot to ask to confirm. The menu was only two pages long. The menu was primarly seafood dishes with a few meat dishes. Items like skirt steak in a soy marinade, sword fish fish, and shellfish.  Drinks:  Full bar, extensive wine menu with some rare ($1000+ bottles), and house cocktail. Wine can be purchased by the glass or by the bottle. Cocktails examples were \u00a0Lychee martin and sake moijto.  Price:  Cocktails ranged from $6 up to $12 (rather high for a cocktail). Wine by the glass ranged from $9 to $17 which was also a bit steep. Main entrees ranged from $18 to $30. All in all I found the price to be on the high side for the portion and the quality.   Food: \u00a0 I ordered the scallops which nicely cooked. Nicely seared with a , served on top of a creamy risotto. The risotto was a bit bland need a some salt or maybe a touch of cheese for saltiness. I tried some of my friends hanger stake and it was tough (over cooked) and bland as well. I was way more impressed by the shrimp and green papaya salad appetizer. The papaya salad was similar to a Cambodian papaya salad served with warm beautifully seasoned shrimp that brought out the sweetness.  I'd say overall the food was under seasoned, under salted, over cooked, and over priced.  On a positive note, the chef did come by and ask how our food was. I have him my honest opinion and hopefully he took the suggestion.   Location:  Easy to find as it was right off of Emarcadero st, but parking was hard.   Service:  Overall the service was not so great. It was slow - taking forever for the waiter to come and take our order, bring us our food, and ask how we were doing. Our waiter was too knowledgeable on the wines. I asked him for a suggestion on a bottle of white that was not too Oaky and slightly crisp and fruity and he and to ask his manager.   Ambiance:  There's a beautiful view of the bay as half the had a open feel with over sized windows over looking the bay. The overall feel was casual with a class touch and a high price. No need to dress up for this place. The decor was quite interesting with large urchin looking light fixtures.",

Fresh, tender, light, not oily or greasy. Shanghai Noodles: Delicious, excellent flavor, filled with veggies too. (some in our party complained there was not enough soy sauce, and that the taste was too light, but I thought that was the good part about it. Good flavor without being overwhelming) Strawberry Salmon Spring Roll: Nice and fresh, very light and tasty.  Grilled Snapper: Excellent dish! The fish almost melted in your mouth, comes with sauce and cold vermicelli to mix up and put in butter lettuce cups Loco Moco: Delicious but huge and heavy. Probably good to share with 1 or more peeps. Kobe Burger got great reviews from our table.  Classic Creme Brulee got thumbs up Banana Lumpia with Coconut Ice Cream!!!! OMG I'm dead.

    "review_text": "So I wanted to try the chicken salad sandwhich but like a fool I listened ot the waitress who told me the fish sandwhich was better. I knew it would be a typical dry fish sandhwich, and it was. It wasnt bad, but it definitely needed more tartar sauce since it was so dry. The fries were great. The mojito was good, the dessert was awesome. Go during lunch during the week and see if theyll give you a coupon. I was just looking at the menu outside and they roped me in with a free dessert. Having said that, the dessert was the best part of the meal. The views are good. I mean, its just water and not much else to see except for the sides of the other buildings which go out very far and limits your sight of other things like alcatraz but you might catch a glimpse of a seal. I really like the booths with the long table for two near the windows. Nicer restaurants arent typically known for fish sandwhiches so Im guessing, based ont he quality of the rest of the food, that the cuisine they specialize in is probbaly pretty good.",

They sort of take a page from the Houli-Benni-han and Co. book and try to make menu items fit the widest number of people possible. This probably isn't a bad business decision given where they are in relationship to touristville. For a place to take some out of towners to that doesn't bring them too far off the wharf, I would probably go back.  I got the sashimi salad - I thought it was super salty near the bottom, and a little bland at the top. Fish was fresh, but the unagi was a little weak. I'd give it something middle of the road, you know, like 3 stars?  Neat ambiance, sort of trendy, beautiful bay views...except all booths point INWARD thus ensuring that at least 50% or more of your table won't have an ocean view! Not so good if you are bringing tourists. Waaay too much wacky tabacky for that interior designer.   Interesting drink menu though! I liked my lychee-tini. Maybe this place hops a bit more as a nightclub...",

Located at the Embarcadero, my boyfriend was lucky to find any parking in the area for Friday evening. Surprisingly, he found it quickly and close by. It was still a bit odd as to why the streets were so empty that night.  Anyways, we were seated immediately upon entering with a water front! Lucky us! The view was quite the breath taker.  The menu was quite short and was definitely Asian Fusion. My boyfriend ordered the Kalua pig with butter lettuce cups and the sizzling cowboy steak while I ordered the grilled hanger steak \"kalbi style\". The lettuce cups were quite delicious, the consistency of the pig seemed like pate but way more delicious. The cowboy steak was ..not so good, tasted very charred and came with a cup of wedge potato fries which were good until I bit into an uncooked one. My Kalbi style hanger steak was okay.  Our server was nice and quite funny actually.",

    "review_text": "It's easy to write off Buttefly as a tourist trap considering its waterfront location and proximity to Pier 39 - I know I did for years. But all in all, it's actually a pretty good place to dine with good service, and hopefully plenty of sunshine to boot.   Butterfly lets in a lot of light and it was quite glorious on the day we arrived for lunch. Having made reservations earlier, we were seated promptly and our server was right on top of things immediately.   I started with the fried calamari (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I793mn-IIrt6HfjXYXzYxA?select=0Hw2Zwn0Ow1G_McsV7SYJw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I793\u2026</a>) which were good but not great - could have used a little more salt but it was fresh and not too tough. I liked the creamy consistency of tabasco remoulade and the extra spice kick it brought. The generous sprinkling of cilantro really helped to brighten up the plate. I also stole a bite of the Kalua pig butter-lettuce cups - that was probably the highlight from the meal. Note to self on return visit.  I had the turmeric grilled snapper (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I793mn-IIrt6HfjXYXzYxA?select=azbXr_gGiDt22oYvEn-8-g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I793\u2026</a>) for my entree and I really liked the fish. It had a good char to it and the theatrics of a sizzling dish is always nice. I really didn't care for the cold rice noodles that came with it. I guess it's a play on Bun but I thought it was extraneous and took away from the fish.  It's easy to see how I overlooked Butterfly in the past but easier to understand why I am coming back - decent food and tremendous service. On that note, our server offered us a free dessert to share because one of the appetizers (onion soup) came 5 minutes after the others were served. Yup... another check for Butterfly the next time I'm looking for a waterfront restaurant.",

The interior decor is true to its San Francisco chic design. \u00a0I liked the spacious restaurant floor, the curved bar, the plush booths, the mosaic inlays and the industrial type windows opening onto the pier. \u00a0The lighting fixtures that look like gigantic eyes with chopsticks for eyelashes complete the picture. \u00a0Yep, cool place.  I am old enough to enjoy an early bird special every once in a while, and dining at 5 pm has its undeniable perks. \u00a0One of said perks, of course, is the ability to enjoy a three-course meal for $21. \u00a0Yep, you heard it right. \u00a0$21 for a three-course meal (view of the Bay included).  I started with their specialty, the Kalua Pig Butter Lettuce Wraps. \u00a0It's basically pulled pork with peanuts and BBQ sauce that you wrap in lettuce leaves. \u00a0It's delicious, but very messy. \u00a0Still, meat appetizer - gotta love that. \u00a0 For my entree, I had the hanger steak with crispy noodles. \u00a0Due to my inattention to detail, I completely missed the part where my steak also came with shrimp. \u00a0I carefully set the shrimp aside and enjoyed the tender slices of beef. \u00a0For dessert, I indulged in a tiny slice chocolate cake with a generous scoop of coffee ice cream. \u00a0Yum!  While the food wasn't particularly memorable or creative, it was a tremendous value. \u00a0Our waiter was wonderful, too. \u00a0He seemed genuinely concerned that I got the shrimp with my steak, and he offered to replace the dish even though it was totally my mistake. \u00a0My friend even complimented the waiter on the job well done. \u00a0He made the whole experience even better.  If you're looking for an early dinner, Butterfly might just be the spot! \u00a0Check it out.",

I'll get to that in just a little bit. Overall the staff was great the whole night! Super friendly and attentive.   40 bucks for the prix fixe menu wasn't bad at all. We started out with 3 mini appetizers that come with the prix fixe menu. Oyster shooters, fried spam masubi, and a tuna sashimi type of dish. Anyway, the owner came buy to ask us how our meal was going and noticed we left the mint leaf on our plate. He told us we ate the tuna sashimi dish all wrong and told us he'd bring out another order and made sure we ate it the right way. Then we got the duck confit spring rolls and kalua pork lettuce wraps for appetizers. They're both so good and probably my favorite dishes. For our main course we ordered the catfish and the steak hangers. Both were really good but I wish I had read reviews before I ordered!

As we entered, the full window backdrop and interesting urban decor was quite impressive. Our server Danielle was friendly and attentive and recommended a perfectly thirst quenching Mojito on this hot summer night. That's about as positive as it gets at Butterfly.   We ordered two appetizers to start. They were ok to good but overpriced as expected in this location. We continued to read the entrees on the menu when the party next to us was served Kobe Sliders that looked very tasty. Having not seen them on the menu, we asked our server about them and mentioned we'd like to order them. She stated that they weren't on the menu and would ask the manager about it. Now what could be the problem with that? Silly me...  I observed a stern looking man walking with purpose approaching our table. There was no \"hello\" or welcoming smile. Instead with surly tone and attitude we were told that we could not have the Kobe Sliders, they were only on the lunch menu and that ended at 3:30pm. Now, mind you it is close to 6:30pm. When pointing out the obvious, that the people next to us were served the sacred burgers his only reply was that they had been here since lunchtime and were entitled and he stomped off to attend to higher matters. You know, I'm normally pretty easy going, but was in total disbelief. Shocked at his manner and attitude, we decided to eat our entree elsewhere. Thanked our excellent server, leaving her a generous tip, sympathetic to the fact that she had to work with this lout. This is definitely not the Nordstrom of the food industry.

Despite an interesting cocktail menu, I was drawn to a three-glass Riesling sampler, what they call the Butterfly flight; Domaines Schlumberger \"Les Princes Abbes\" Alsace 2004, Gainey Vineyard Santa Ynes Valley 2003, and Saint M Dr. Loosen Pfaltz Germany 2005.  These went reasonably well with the two appetizers I ordered; Duck Confit Spring Rolls served with a Chinese hot mustard &amp; honey dipping sauce and Kahlua Pig with Butter Lettuce Cups served with hoisin sauce and toasted cashews with green onions.  For Asian-inspired bar food, the spring rolls were quite good - very light, crispy wrappers, perfectly fried. Honestly, the meat inside could have been duck confit or pork or chicken. It really didn't matter. The sauce was interesting in that accompanied with the rolls, there was an obvious sweetness which I thought might overwhelm upon entry, but which expanded in the mouth to a pretty decent mustard spice.   The Kahlua Pig with lettuce cups was very ample and between the two dishes, far more food than one person could possibly eat. The butter lettuce was a nice change from the classic head lettuce used in lettuce cup offerings. The pork was riddled with a fine dice of assorted bell peppers; orange, yellow, and red. both the pork and the hoisin was topped with toasted cashews which were so finely chopped as to actually look like finely grated cheese or Brazilian yucca powder.  Not bad for an afternoon interpose because I stumbled on it, but hardly a destination restaurant for me.",

Magically bottles were discovered and served. The service is lack-luster which is ok as long as people are polite but this didn't seem to be the case.

And then the waiter takes a good look at the new 'clean' plate he's bringing you, and turns around to fetch yet another. Third time's the charm, that's what I always say.  The tuna tartar was fine, except for the overly stylish wasabi-green hat it was wearing. The texture of which, reminded me most of the cardboard house in the alley behind work; after it had been rained on for a week.  And the hanger steak, while still being a hanger steak, should not have been so chewy at medium rare.  For the price, Butterfly is a disaster. The only good thing was our waiter.

I felt like it was a world of its own compared to the Pier. The bartender was funny and very conversational.   Next time I am in San Francisco and stuck doing the tourist thing I will come back to this place for drinks and maybe even food next time to escape the reality of ten billion people walking around aimlessly not knowing what they're doing.

Reserved a table/bottle service beforehand. What does bottle service get you and your guests at this place? You get to...  1. Freeze your ass off outside for 30 minutes while they kick the restaurant patrons out. Sorry, can't go in, not even to stand at the bar or I don't know...the bathroom?  2. Finally your \"hostess\" comes out. Her first words were, \"I need your credit card.\" Really? No \"how are you doing tonight\"? Or \"sorry these punk Fast and Furious-looking promoters made your party wait so long\"? Nope. Takes your card. Walks you to your table. Tells you that her gratuity will automatically be added to the bill. Thanks. That walk from the door to the table was really tiring, wasn't it? Go ahead and give yourself $50. You earned it. By the way, didn't see her again for the rest of the night.   3. Once you're in, you can't go outside, not even by yourself so you can bring your friends in. Some of them had to pay cover even though they were on my guest list.  My friends and I did have a good time once we were all situated, but that had more to do with the drinks and the music, and nothing to do with your service. So you get 0 stars for the shitty service + 1 star for the location + 1 star for the atmosphere/ambiance = 2 stars.  Butterfly Restaurant - if you don't want your ratings to go down, maybe you shouldn't let shitty promoters like Pure host events at your place anymore.",

I had become a creature of habit, ordering the encrusted filet of ahi tuna, time after time. So it goes without saying that I found that wonderful. But last night I ventured to try the braised short ribs. I espcially liked the vegetables it was served with.",

I was thinking they'd be like Vietnamese spring rolls (cold with the white wrapper), but they were fried more like egg rolls. Still good, just not what I was expecting. My sister had the salad which was very large and came with edible flowers in it!  Entrees: The meatballs came on a sizzling hot platter with meet cooked three ways. It also came with noodles and lettuce so that I could make lettuce wraps. Everything about this dish was delicious! Definitely my favorite of our meal. We also had the garlic noodles. They are very generous with their portions. They were a bit on the salty side for me, but good overall. The meat in the shaking beef salad was very soft and tender.  Dessert: When they say mini creme brulee, they mean mini. I enjoyed the small size because I was pretty full, but it was nice to have a taste of something sweet.  I enjoyed the set up of the restaurant with nice decorations and a view of the water. The chef was very nice. He came around to greet us and check to make sure our meal was going well :)",

The food is overpriced, but it's expected based on the location.   The pig in a hole was pretty good, lettuce cups were alright, garlic noodles were better than average and the salmon/strawberry rolls were interesting.  I'm a little harsher on expensive places because if I pay more, I expect more.   My wife found a couple of pet hairs in her lettuce. She asked to have it done again and although she was apologized to and got a new one, you would think a manager would address it or at least give us a discount. It's the little things that add or subtract a star.   Seems like the place does pretty good business and on Sundays the bottomless mimosas keep people there for a while.   The place was alright, but not my keep of tea.",

There are better choices in the area to choose from for the price. Dishes at Butterfly aren't unpleasant, but they are also in no way unique in flavor or presentation. The live music is a plus for late-night dining, but other than that- and the view of the water- there just wasn't anything extraordinary about this restaurant.",

Duck is my favorite but I couldn't taste it at all, was just a deep fried mass of stuff. I was ready to write this place off after that.  Luckily I came here again for dinner and had a much better experience. The wok seared garlic noodles with shaking beef (19 bucks total) was amazing, beef was tender and flavorful (a heavy entree, will cause naptime). I also ordered the banana bread pudding for dessert which was yummy, not too sweet. Only complaint was that though it wasn't very packed that night service seemed extremely slow, food took long to come out, and waiters took forever to get us the check.  Entrees are mostly $12+, prices typical of the area.  Pass on the duck springrolls but anything + shaking beef is probably a good bet.",

The duck rolls were good, father said it was a lil dry. The spicy edabame was only decent nothing special.  We also got a round of their mixed drinks and 2 desserts the best drink was the pear martini i got the lychee-tini it was okay..(came with actual lychee fruit which was a plus)   And the best dessert was the chocolate cake (with warm choloate filling) and ice cream come here on a special occasion when its okay to go for the exotic stuff.

The banana waffles were great and the salmon scramble with asparagus and tobiko was superb. \u00a0I especially liked the kick of wasabi tobiko and the thick slices of toast. \u00a0However, the desserts are the reason I will likely revisit Butterfly. \u00a0We only had enough room to split the chocolate torte with coffee ice cream and raspberry compote (although, by my definition, three whole and seemingly untouched raspberries does not a compote make), and it was absolutely perfect. \u00a0The rest of the list looked just as appetizing and I hope to sample all of them at some point.  If you ever want to befuddle the staff at Butterfly, just have your whole table order their coffee black. \u00a0Our first server told us how \"hard core\" he thought we were, and a later filler (I think he was management) looked at our table with shock and asked if he could please get cream and sugar for us, as though we must have been deprived for 45 minutes, but had not managed to rectify the situation with our server. \u00a0  Aside coming across a little bit daft, the people at Butterfly were great. \u00a0The service waned as the brunch rush progressed, my companion's coffee being refilled the first time after two small sips, but later my cup sat empty for five or ten minutes. \u00a0I think the server caught himself though, and even at the end of the meal offered to keep the refills coming as long as we wanted to stay. \u00a0I'm not sure I would go so far out of my way for brunch in the future, but if I wanted dessert and a drink in a stylish, peaceful environment, or if I found myself hungry on the Embarcadero on a Sunday afternoon, I would certainly return to Butterfly.",

I seriously could not chew through this thing. I ordered medium and it seemed like it was well done. I know hanger steak is generally a tougher cut, but dear god - BLEGH Creme brulee - simple, effective, tasty Chocolate cake with coffee ice cream - the ice cream was delish!

Ordered a couple cocktails (really good), the calamari for an appetizer ( really good) and a couple entrees (not so great). The decor and view are beautiful and the full bar has a lot to offer, though they only have bottled beers. Price-wise, I was expecting more from the entrees. The two we had, kobe beef burger (it was bland and dry! Implies they don't know the right way to cook it) and a Vietnamese sandwich, left a lot to be desired. Additionally, there were \"fries\" served with our entrees that were more like massive chunks of potato...but, hey, some people probably love that.

We selected a fixed price menu with \"family style\" appetizers and a choice of several entrees and desserts. Appetizers were great. While everyone at the table who ordered the fish was very happy, I happened to order the filet mignon. It was a complete disaster. It is very difficult to mess up a filet mignon. It was overcooked. Also, the sauce was gross with melted blue cheese on top which did not blend with the sauce at all.  What upset me the most was the gratuity. An 18% gratuity was included since we a large party, which is standard and I was okay with. However, there was an additional 3% tip included as a \"booking fee\". Apparently calling up the restaurant and making reservations via a manager incurs this fee. I think this is pure garbage to be charged extra for what should just be good customer service. The restaurant was not even busy on a Saturday night and we could have just walked in which seemed a little scary to me.  The view looked fantastic but we couldn't really tell since it was dark. I am not in a hurry to rush back to Butterfly.",

Our server took forever to get our order and when she finally came by our table, she says \"I heard you're in a hurry.\" Hmmm...I guess we were since we've been waiting over half an hour. The food was nothing impressive and very pricey. Not a surprise for a fancy restaurant by the Piers. We decided to order drinks and appetizers. The duck confit spring rolls weren't that great. Our rolls came out super hot and burned my tongue as I took my first bite. I barely tasted duck, mainly mushrooms. The rolls wouldn't have been as good if it weren't for the spicy hot mustard &amp; honey dipping sauce. The ahi poke nom nom wraps surprisingly had more tuna than expected. They tasted great and refreshing. However, I'd rather have them wrapped in seaweed than mint leaves. Lastly, we ordered the kalua pork and butter lettuce cups. Probably my favorite app of the night. They gave out more pork than expected and we had leftover pork after going through all the lettuce. We decided to put some hot mustard sauce from the duck rolls and it gave a good kick to it.  Overall, pricey and mediocre food. Probably won't return.",

The cream of mushroom soup had an interesting milky froth on top, and was served with a garnish of unagi and cucumber.  For dinner, I had steak, which was excellent. I don't usually eat much steak, but I'm glad I made an exception this time.  The chocolate torte for dessert was pretty much identical to every other molten chocolate cake that I've had.

Deep, unfinished, raw beam ceilings, a wall of windows looking over the water , decadent frosted glass bar with eerie blue glow, stainless steel, exposed kitchen, hip bathrooms. The space was amazing, is it for rent and when can we move in?  Another thing to note is that the servers know the right amount of involvement, not too much, not too little, know when to shoo those indecisive folks at your table.  We dropped about 80 pp on a DINE OUT FOR LIFE charity event in which Levis participated and my SO volunteered made the bill impact more palpable Probably the best high-end dining experience I've had so far in my 1+ years living in SF by way of NYC  TIP: \u00a0you can street park with easy after 6ish during the weeknights and there's a paid lot right next door for those wearing heels or other encumbrances that make walking a block or two difficult.

    "review_text": "My fiance and I tried Butterfly for the first time last week and we both left extremely full, very satisfied, and committed to coming back again given how much we enjoyed the restaurant. Below is a summary of our dining experience:  Appetizers: First, Butterfly serves bottomless edimame instead of bread, which made me feel less guilty given the quantity I ate. We ordered the Kalua Pig lettuce wraps, which were mouth watering tender and flavorful, and an asparagus dish served with a semi-cooked egg, flat rice noodles, and a few other fixings. This was was by far one of the most unique and delicious creations I've had in recent memory. We'll definitely be ordering these two appetizers again the next time we're here.  We were also treated to the bloody mary oyster shooters, which was tasty despite my dislike for oysters, and a couple of rolls, which were really good but not \"blow your mind\" spectacular.  Entrees: I ordered the 24 oz sizzling cowboy steak, a bone-in ribeye masterpiece surpassing my expectations for quality and quantity! The steak was cooked to order (medium rare), was very tender and had great flavor. My fiance ordered a fish dish, though I don't recall specifically which one since I was busy battling my 24 oz steak. However, she did tell me that she LOVED it, so I'll just have to take her word for it that it was good.  Dessert: By the time we finished our entrees, we were beyond stuffed. But our server hooked it up with the lychee shaved ice, which was perfect. The shaved ice had great flavor as the lychee is literally infused into the liquid used to make the ice. The dish was also very light which was perfect.  Service: I can't forget to mention the service. Our server, Cody, was awesome. He knew the menu like the back of his hand, and checked in with us at regular intervals, such that we weren't neglected nor were we annoyed.  Overall, we had a wonderful experience at Butterfly and will certainly be back again soon!",

Service is also always attentive and informative on the menu.   When it comes to the food, I go for their happy hour, since it is a lot less expensive than their actual menu and has some good bites. Their calamari is a must have! Super tasty and hardly greasy. Another go to dish is their steak fries and pork lettuce wraps. Yum!   Their main menu has some yummy dishes as well; I once tried a gnocchi dish with stuffed squash blossoms. Another time during Christmas, the chef, who is one of the nicest people I have met, praised us for trying the stuffed crab. Super messy but awesome.   Their dessert is quite nice too. My favorites are the chocolate ganache, banana pudding, and creme brulee.   What is a little disappointing about this place is that because their food is seasonal, some of their epic dishes disappeared :(.",

I still love the location and how the restaurant has tons of windows for you to enjoy the beautiful view of the bay.   For some reason, none of the main dishes sounded tempting to me. The only thing on the menu that sounded interesting were the salmon and strawberry salad rolls. So I decided to order two appetizers instead of a main. The rolls were fantastic and unique. The raw salmon, strawberries, rice noodles and lettuce were all rolled and wrapped with rice paper. I really enjoyed the sweet combination. I also ordered the clam and mussels in coconut broth and garlic bread. To my surprise, the portion was quite large. It was enough to make me full. The shellfish were good, but nothing great. I had a bit of my mom's orange and curry scallops over lemon pea risotto and it was good.  Dessert was yummy! We shared the banana bread pudding and banana lumpia. The bread pudding was the highlight. Moist and crispy and topped with ice cream and slices of caramelized bananas. I'm going back just for dessert!

I shared the entree and we had the Free range Rocky Jr. Chicken Clay Pot and that, also with the sauce, was pretty decent.  The horrible part of our night was when the server poured my BF water. He drank it and felt some weird texture in his mouth. He took it out, thought it was a piece of black rice, put it down on the table, and it started MOVING. IT WAS A DISGUSTING BUG!!!!   To compensate for the whole meal, management kindly offered to pay for the meal AND add a complimentary dessert.   Dessert was a warm bananas foster on top of coconut pineapple ice cream.

My friend and I sat at the bar. \u00a0There's probably 10 bar seats, comfortable with plenty of space and hooks for your purse or bag. \u00a0And, it's still a nice view of the outside from the bar. \u00a0No TV. \u00a0 The two bartenders were really cool and chatted with us when it wasn't too busy. \u00a0I got a house made bourbon and honey cocktail, it was good and right in the normal SF price range. \u00a0They gave us some edamame with it, the flavor was really good. \u00a0 My friend got the cod, I got the filet. \u00a0The cod was really good, light and sweet. \u00a0The filet was cooked to my perfect medium rare and came with wasabi mashed potatoes and some veggies. \u00a0It was all really good and a perfect size for a good price. Yelp shows this to be located at Broadway, it's not, it's at Bay at Pier 33. \u00a0It's a great location, and even though it's close to touristy area, it seems to have a variety of people. \u00a0I'm sure it gets busy during prime hours, so a reservation is probably a good idea. I'd like to go back and try happy hour, it's only Tuesday - Thursday. \u00a0The menu for it looks good.  Good spot, I'll be back!",

Great ambiance but the food was \"so so.\"",

SOOOOO glad I chose it! \u00a0  truly, this was an awesome meal... BUT, if yer goin' at night, the view is less than spectacular... with cert, meal for 4 (apps, drinks, meals, and dessert) was $160 with tip...  what we had: - pork lettuce wraps... a bit messy, but awesome flavor and great hoisin sauce...  - duck confit spring rolls - these were AMAZIN!!!! wished we'd ordered two sets... really - you must try them! \u00a0perfectly fried, not at all greasy, with fantastic seasoning and very tender duck meat - veggie bento box - great curry sauce w/ noodles, not at all spicy, lovely sauteed veggies,  - braised short ribs - very tasty, but only one rib... rice cakes were crispy and tasty - two ordered the bacon wrapped char siu pork - very crispy bacon and nicely finished pork... a good sized portion - lychee shaved ice - FANTASTIC flavor and a great way to finish the meal - bananas foster lumpia... on the basis of other yelp reviews, asked for the coconut ice cream on the side... our waitress (who provided exemplary service) agreed that they should serve it that way and it did make a big difference... the two people who ordered this then mixed the sauce w/ the ice cream at their own discretion and were very pleased - chocolate lava cake w/ coffee ice cream - HATE coffee, so I didn't try the ice cream, but others liked it... the chocolate sauce seemed to have been made from scratch and was DIVINE!!! - basic drinks (well martini, sapporo, strong coffee) as well as a lychee drink (virgin) that was fabulous...  All in all, I could not recommend a better place to try out (especially w/ the $50 off cert...) - NOT a tourist trap... lots of locals dining, had reservations which I would recommend as they were swamped... great service and good attention to detail... the atmosphere was very nice and it was neither too fancy nor too casual - a great place for a very nice dinner :-)  One point of information - they have a terrificly cheap ($21) winter 3-course pre-fixe, but won't let you do the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.com&amp;s=8b83bf0ff8b716aae84527dc95577a310f201b166dcca25c8ca3824b15703869\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">restaurants.com</a> cert w/ it, which makes sense since the pre-fixe is so cheap anyway... but the waitress let us know this ahead of time since I'd brought out the cert at the outset... no harm, no foul!",

We had a reservation for Sat night and then called mid-day on Friday to switch to that night and they were able to accommodate. Well, sort of. When we arrived, we were sat at a table right by the door, so every time someone came in, there was a terrible draft. We were no where near the water view, but instead, staied right at a wood pillar. At that point we almost left, but decided we were already there and practically decided right then that we wouldn't be back.  Then onto the service, some of the worst I've had in the city. We were given menus by the hostess immediately, but didn't see our waitress for at least 10 minutes. Then we ordered drinks and they actually came after our appetizer, which was by no means fast. We had ordered 2 appetizers and only one came and I really wanted to try the duck confit springrolls (which are warned to be spicy, they really aren't). They were fine, but definitely not worth waiting for. We also ordered a sushi appetizer.  At this point we so didn't want to like the food since everything else had been so bad, but surprise, surprise, the food was actually pretty good. I had scallops, which were okay, not cooked to perfect, but the risotto was good and my husband really liked his (I think he got the steak).

We also felt bad b/c our waitress was quite pregnant so even when she said she'd pay for the missed appetizer, we just let it be.",

    "review_text": "I had reservations on a Friday night, expecting it to be packed. As I walked \u00a0in the place was 50% full. I thought \"okay, it's not too busy. Then we should have pretty good service.\" We got seated at our table for two and I must say they have the worst chairs ever. They were just plain wooden chairs but it was soo uncomfortable. The table was small, it didn't have enough room for both our legs so our legs kept crashing. This doesn't ever happen to us at other restaurants but at this one, yes. The tables were very close to each other so every time someone walks by they would push our table. The decor was nice with modern designs, lights were dim so very romantic.  The food wasn't good. We started with garlic noodles and the ribs. The portions were big but not tasty. The garlic noodles had this weird tomato sauce which I didn't like. I think if they changed the sauce it'd be a lot better. The sauce for the ribs were a little too sweet and the meat was a bit dry. For our main our waiter recommended the whole fish which was deep fried with some spicy kimchi sauce on top. I thought why not give it a try? But when it came, I didn't find anything special about the fish. It was fried so I can't even taste the natural flavor of the fish. It just killed it. The bf got the duck which was decent. The duck leg was dry just like the others. It's had for the leg part to be dry but it was! The breast was good, at least it was moist. The best part was the dessert! I love chocolate cake so we got the lava cake. It was sooo good. It was made perfectly! The cake was moist and baked just right with lava part flowing out and the best part is topping it off with vanilla ice cream. Warm and cold together never tasted this good! Seriously this is the only part of my meal I liked.  Overall, my experience wasn't too good. The service was wack. Our waiter never came around to check if things were okay. Actually it took us forever to get his attention. I understand that its a Friday night but like I said this place wasn't packed to begin with. Plus this place isn't even big at all. If it was big then people wouldn't be crashing into our table every 10 mins. We stayed there for nearly 3 hours! I felt if the service was any better then we'd be done wayy before that. Anyways, if it wasn't for the dessert I wouldn't even have given it three stars. I doubt I'll be coming back... at least not anytime soon.",

I had the Loco Moco Burger. \u00a0Wrong choice for me, and I should have known. \u00a0So I don't put that on the restaurant. \u00a0Egg and a burger and spam is very very very rich. \u00a0If I go back for brunch, I will try poached eggs with smoked salmon, or shaking beef cobb salad. \u00a0  I'm not really a dessert person, but the dessert was the absolute highlight of our meal. \u00a0We ordered and shared the bread pudding and banana lumpia. \u00a0We all raved. \u00a0  Highlights for us were the appetizers and the desserts. \u00a0The price was relatively inexpensive. \u00a0I almost expect higher prices for the location and decor. \u00a0(I hope no one reads that and decides to charge more :) \u00a0). \u00a0It's a great location for walking around after your done eating, etc. \u00a0Parking was easy as well; we went to the garages across the street.",

Among 3 of us, I think over time we ordered about 30. Perfect mix between the bloody mary mix, garlic, and fresh oyster in a shot glass. I asked for lemon slices to add a small squirt of lemon juice which absolutely solidified the taste.   Butterfly's drinks were also great, wonderful array of wines and beers. In addition they had some fun inventive drinks. HAppy Hours specials were definitely awesome.  We also got classic Calamari, which was good except company I was with was not a fan of the mayo, and the server/restaurant was more than fine with giving us a new batch.  Classy small intimate restaurant, and we actually sat outside on this random sliver of deck that runs along the side of the pier.  Didn't really have a full meal so I can't comment on that; however, I thoroughly enjoyed the apps (specifically the oysters), the atmosphere, and the drinks I had. Great experience.",

Food: We ordered the calamari appetizer. It was good, but had a little too much sauce on the top. In the future I would ask for it on the side. For the entrees we ordered the sesame crusted ahi tuna- RARE. And the NY strip steak. They were both very tasty. The flavors of the sauces and veggies that accompanied the tuna/steak were perfect.   Dessert: \u00a0Warm Chocolate Torte with coffee ice cream- YUMM!  To top off the evening, they gave us complimentary glasses of champagne. The service was excellent.

Having lived in the Bay Area for my entire life, I have gone to several restaurants in San Francisco, but this definitely has been my best dining experience so far.  For drinks, we ordered lycheetinis and acai lemonades, definitely the refreshing treat on a hot summer night. Then, we ordered garlic noodles, duck spring rolls, and strawberry and salmon summer rolls. They were absolutely delicious and the portion sizes were perfect. For my entree, I ordered the Peking Duck Crepes, and I tried my friends' Seared Ahi Tuna. Both were extremely flavorful, and I highly recommend them!  And of course, dessert. For the table, we ordered banana lumpia rolls with coconut ice cream, the chocolate tarte with coffee ice cream, the banana bread pudding, and the lychee shaved ice. Absolutely amazing!  To top off an impressive meal, the service was top-notch. The waiters were extremely friendly and helpful in giving us suggestions. The food also came relatively quickly. Additionally, the owner of the restaurant, Rob, came by to ask us how we liked the food and what we thought of the place. Definitely an extremely personable manager.   This was the perfect conclusion to a day well spent in San Francisco. I will be back!",

We ordered the Calamari starter and the Cowboy Steak to share. \u00a0 First, the Calamari... oh my goodness... the goodness. \u00a0It was served almost as a salad and it was quite possibly one of the best calamari dishes we have ever tasted. We both loved it, we almost ordered a second. The main, Cowboy Steak. \u00a0Very intimidating looking on it's iron skillet when it is brought table-side. \u00a0It's a huge ribeye on top of veggies and chorizo- and it is sizzlin. \u00a0Ok, I grew up in steak country so I don't often order steaks out here as they are usually overpriced for what you get. \u00a0But this steak is so frickin good we both ate the fatty pieces too. \u00a0My bf apologized to me as a piece he had cut for me had a fair amount of fat on it, and I said \"It's ok, even the fat is delicious.\" sheepishly. \u00a0He looked at me from over his plate and said \"I know, it's really good.\"  We saw a whole fish go out of the kitchen and it looked amazing, I might try it next time. \u00a0It is Asian/California fusion that I would say is heavier on the California than Asian- so for me that's great. \u00a0Asian cuisine is usually my least sought out dining experience. I also had the bloody Mary served Animal style- it had this amazing piece of candied bacon in it. I can't say it was the right compliment for my dinner, but I ordered it with no recommendation. The room is large and comfortable and the server we had that evening was very knowledgeable without being stuffy or overly showy. Oh, yeah. \u00a0And we got the banana bread pudding to go. \u00a0It was delicious at home with the coconut ice cream! \u00a0 If you are near the wharf or Embarcadero, definitely check this place out.
