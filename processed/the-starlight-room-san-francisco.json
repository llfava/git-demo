I do not usually judge so it was fun until they changed the music from awesome dance music to just downright ghetto ones. Not cool. Everyone was having fun dancing to tall sasha and the dj's after him until they just had to switch the dj to their resident dj. I just had to leave. I believe this skanky lady had to request this type of music so she can dance like a stripper against the dj booth... trust me.. it looked more like she was scratching her back against it...Certain music attracts a certain type of crowd and I definitely do not want to be a part of a crowd that dances like they need to get a room.

There was no music when I went most recently. The service was very \u00a0courteous and we got a window table. There was actually a plug on the wall so we were able to sneak in a phone charge while we were there, too!  They have a great selection of cocktails that are reasonably priced given the incredible view and location.   I just love stopping in here! Taking in that view and having a cocktail just validates why San Francisco is one of the greatest cities in the world!",

I went there that night for a friends combo Halloween/ 30th bday party and the party was too fun. The space is pretty small for the amount of people they packed into the event. The promoters also give discounts for admission to some people but not others even if you are in the same party, so that was lame! For a party of 15, my friend got a table which gave us ladies some breathing space from the small dance floor and sweaty people.   I didn't see any views. All I saw were the surrounding buildings of union square, but maybe I was at the wrong part of the lounge. Overall, music didn't start getting great til half way through when they played classic hip hop tunes that got the people moving.   The costumes were great to see on everyone. It was fun seeing how creative people are. The hostess of our table was gracious and dressed very nicely. She was great at her job.   I'm not sure if I would come here again, without a specific reason like a friends birthday but you got to try everything once, right?",

    "review_text": "I came here with colleagues. We were in town for the night for business and Harry Denton's was recommended by the concierge at our hotel.   When we came in the host did not give us a friendly welcome whatsoever. I was trying to ask him if an area near the bar we were interested in sitting was open for self-seating, but he basically cut me off and said he would seat us in another area. So, I had to ask him again and he finally told us that we couldn't sit there. All the while, no smile and very unwelcoming as if we were annoying him with our presence.   We asked him if food was still being served and he said yes.   We were seated and given one menu for three people.   The waitress, however, was a breath of fresh air--friendly and welcoming.   She took our drink orders while we were looked over the menu. It took us a couple minutes to figure out what we wanted because nothing especially popped out.   Finally, we made a decision and got the waitress's attention and let her know we wanted to order food. She told us the kitchen was closed!! Of course, we were quite surprised because we had been told otherwise by the grumpy host. We asked if there was anything we could be served--bread and butter so we wouldn't be drinking on an empty stomach??? After all, the kitchen would had to have just closed in the 10 minutes or so from when we came in to when we tried to order.   She said she would go an check and let us know.   A while later she happened to come by our table and we had to remind her that she was supposed to be checking with the kitchen for us and she confirmed that there was nothing they could serve us and said that she would bring us the check and hurried off.   My colleagues and I looked at each other a bit confused, because we never indicated that we wanted the check, but we were like, whatever--we're not having another round anyway.   When guests are seated right before the kitchen closes, any good server would ask them if they wanted to put in an order before the kitchen closes. I don't know why she didn't bother asking us.   Meanwhile, the waitress was back and forth and never brought us the check. Finally, we asked her about it and she brought it to us. I was thinking perhaps she realized the she had prematurely offered the check to us and changed her mind about bringing it--then again, she could have just forgotten about it.   I must admit, she was overextended--she seemed to be taking care of the entire lounge until another waitress came on not long before we left. So, she had about 7 tables.   The drink was good, so no complaints there.   The decor was hideous. The upholstery desperately needs to be redone. It is worn and tattered.   The crowd was a random mix.   The DJ was great! Hip hop and top 40s.   The view is really nice.   Only because of the view, I would say that it isn't terrible if you just want a drink and a great view and you know what you're getting yourself into.",

Make sure you show up a little early; we got there right before the show, and barely had time to fill our plates before the entertainment started.  I think I saw my first drag show in the early 80's. I've been to a lot of them. The performers for this show were excellent. The hostess had an elegant Olympia Dukakis thing going and sang her own numbers. I really enjoyed her. The performers were gorgeous and really interacted a lot with the crowd.   It was a tourist's drag show, though; pretty clean and not particularly campy. I'm rather fond of amateur, chubby older drag queens with a little chest hair peeking out and a great sense of humor. This was definitely not that kind of drag show. These gals were just gorgeous.  Our server was a lovely little thing; she was very welcoming and attentive.   We had a really nice time. We just about fell over when we got the bill; this is not an inexpensive brunch! We had such a good time, though, we didn't mind the expense.  If you have friends in town, particularly straight friends who want to do something that's a little outrageous and fun, this brunch is a good place to take them.",

Was in the Bay Area and wanted to do something fun for my birthday, \u00a0so went to Sundays a Drag down at the Starlight Room, made reservations for the 2:30pm show, seating for the brunch started at 1:30 and they do serve brunch up to 30 mins into the show.  I was pretty excited to combine 3 of my favorite things, my birthday, brunch and drag show all in one day, knew this had to spectacular.  Let's dish!   1st up the food:  I felt fancy so I had to get the Waldorf salad darling because everyone is having it, and it was great, in fact I forgot how much I loved it. Also tried the Eggs Benedict, they tasted good, egg was cooked perfectly but they were sparely on the hollandaise sauce, man I love that golden yellow sauce, don't hold back! \u00a0I also tried the chicken and waffle, a veggie omelet, a truffled deviled egg, some roasted red potatoes, a scone with sweet butter &amp; jelly, maybe a lil chocolate &amp; dark chocolate cake and some chocolate covered strawberries DON'T JUDGE! It was my birthday damnit and I was starving haha.   To drink, had water, coffee and a Bellini, the Bellini was perfect, went well with brunch.   The show was great, I enjoyed it, there were 4 acts all together, and everyone did a great job. I loved the outfits; saw a few that I should flaunt haha. Just a great show for a Sunday afternoon. I would come back to Sundays A Drag in a heartbeat!   After the show they opened up the curtain and allowed us to just enjoy the view, just so beautiful checking out the city views.",

Being able to do something in the past admits you can't perform the same thing now. You're old.   And you go to the Starlight Room.   The music varies from 70s-80s to hip hop, trip hop, rock, and lounge music. Everything can be played except any music above 80 bpm which would undoubtedly explode any hearing devices some patrons wear and cause hip replacement surgery cases \u00a0to sky rocket.

Apparently the people who sold the wrist bands had not communicated with the incompetent \"bouncer\" manning the entry on September 20, 2014.   As guests of the wedding poured out of the elevators, all wearing wristbands, this \"bouncer\" proceeded to swear at us, using incredibly rude and foul language, and humiliate us. There is never a reason to swear at a customer.  Hey dude, did you ever think to speak nicely to guests or ask management what was going on? Guess not.   About 30 minutes later we were finally let in, turns out the wristbands were pre-paid! Oops! They made a mistake, no apology was offered.   We proceed to go in and sit down and unmarked tables, ready to order drinks. We saw other tables marked reserved, so obviously didn't sit at those. Another incredibly rude staff member stomps over, treats us like 10 year old children, yelling at us to get up and move. The flippen BRIDE on her WEDDING NIGHT was sitting there, but still yelled at and made to move, no reason given. (?)  After that, I chose to leave. No place that treats me like that is going to get any of my $. I just feel bad for my friend, the bride, who had a gorgeous and amazing wedding prior to the Starlight Room.

Well, we thought it was funny and more than anything, random. Walking through the Sir Frances Drake, I felt like a tourist. Upon walking into da lounge, we were promptly seated. Music was booming- think, fun dance wedding music. I did appreciate the band's coverage of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and Michael Jackson songs. Rock on! It's very dark inside and I must say, the furniture is nothing luxurious (booths and chairs were ripped, old and worn), but the view....ahhh the View!  The view of San Francisco is beautiful. You gotta go to Harry's at least once, just to see the view.  The drinks were decent- I recommend the Napa Crush. The service was okay, however, I did not appreciate how the waitress charged our friend's credit card on file for the entire table's drinks prior to showing us an itemized receipt (seriously, WTF).  It's touristy. But it's worth a visit, at least once. On a clear night.",

Yes, I agree with everyone that the drinks \u00a0&amp; food were expensive but hey, it was my BFF's birthday, so it didn't matter.  We enjoyed the live band, can't remember the name of the band but they sang mostly hits from the 70s, 80s, and 90s.  Great view of Union Square at night and the hotel it's located in is very beautiful.  I think this is a great place to go have a drink with friends, listen to music, and go dancing. It does cater to a more mature crowd from what I saw that night but there were people of all ages there.  I am really looking forward to going back!",

It was easy to find and the building has an old school San Francisco quaint charm with plenty of style.  We had a reservation and got a nice booth. The host was so charming and sweet! What a doll! The table service was not bad for a nightclub that was pretty busy, we got there at about 9:30.  The drinks were good and strong and the apps. were also tasty. We had the deviled eggs(creamy and crunchy with the bacon on top), prawn cocktail(classic large prawns with yummy spicy cocktail sauce), and the crab cakes(crunchy and well seasoned). My favorite was the ambiance and the mix of people. The cocktail gals were all dressed in their classic sexy all black dresses and were beautiful. The view was great and the DJ was playing a nice variety of music. There is also a coat check if your so inclined.",

    "review_text": "Perfect for dancing!  My mom's friend was visiting from Canada and wanted to go dancing, so I looked up placed on yelp and settled on this. I'm so glad I did. We arrived on a Friday night around 9pm and they didn't charge us a cover. \u00a0We parked for free on Bush and Powell, right by the Stockton garage (which was only $8 for the night).  Almost all the tables were reserved but somehow we managed to get a great booth near the dance floor and band. It's a really cool atmosphere with comfortable seating and really great music. My mom is 60, her friend is 50, and I'm 35 (all women), and the variety of ages in the club was perfect for us. Ages ranged from 21 to 70, with most people in their 30s and 40s, I'm guessing. \u00a0The ethnic makeup was a nice variety of white, asian, black and hispanic. The crowd was okay looking, not bad, though if I was single I might have been disappointed. \u00a0The music was really impressive - the live band played a lot of great 70s music, nice variety (of 70s plus other decades, including the recent \"Crazy\") with lots of energy for dancing. \u00a0The singer was awesome - he sounded like Stevie Wonder, \u00a0great range, style and tone. He was also great with the audience, moving around occasionally, made lots of eye contact, plus he's hot. \u00a0The guitarist and tenor saxophone player both played lots of incredible solos (effective melodic builds and structure, great music references, tons of energy), and both were also great supporting players. The keyboardist and drummer really kept the music moving well, and the keyboardist has a nice voice for backups and lead vocals. \u00a0The DJ spun great tunes for dancing (the live band and DJ traded off).   The dance floor is a great size, at times filled and sometimes empty, but never made me feel crowded or self-conscious (a few people sitting can see the dance floor, but if you don't want to be watched, no problem finding a spot). Some men asked all of us to dance at various points in the evening (we stayed past midnight), but none of them became persistent, so that added to the experience. \u00a0I wouldn't go here to meet someone as a single person, but it's perfect for couple and those who just want to have a great time out, drinking and dancing (and if someone in your party doesn't want to dance, there's no pressure with the way it's set up - my mom sat in the booth for much of the night).  The host, Robert, and our waitress were both very attentive, friendly and efficient. We had drinks when we wanted them, and were not pressured to buy more when we were finished. We also felt safe to leave our belongings at the booth unattended, but I also brought my purse to the dance floor because their is a shelf on the edge where you can place drinks and belongings - perfect. The view is incredible, most of the night I felt like I was dancing with San Francisco. \u00a0The bathrooms are also nice and I never had to wait. The live music was piped in, too, which I appreciated.  The drinks were tasty. I ordered a Devilish (very light and refreshing, nice girly drink) and a Napa Crush (tasted more like alcohol, still sweet and delicious). My mom ordered a martini (thumbs up) and a Brambo (I think that was the name, it was really good with sweet and sour flavors). Her friend ordered two Cherry Bombs, which she obviously liked (less sweet than my drinks, good for both men and women). \u00a0All drinks were $10 each, except the martini ($10.50).",

Everyone that worked here were all dressed very classy and had great customer service skills, checking back often to see if we needed anything.   The starlight room has a great view of downtown. It looked beautiful as all the buildings outside were lit up against the dark foggy sky. I'm sure it's equally as beautiful around dinner time here. There are plenty of tables and seating that are reserved for bottle service. The dance floor is a little small so I'd definitely recommend getting a table with a group of friends. Otherwise you'll be stuck on the dance floor the whole night where it started to get really hot and cramped. Around 11 it was so hot the windows were fogging up and you could no longer see outside.   I've read that there's generally an older crowd here but on this night there was a good mix of younger and older. \u00a0It was a lively crowd and the music was good.

We went there at 9 ish and it was pretty dead ($5 for cover). People were still having dinner. I was starving so we went out for food hoping that it gets happening at 12 ish.   On the way back we saw three girls walk by ready for the fun night out but to realize that they were just leaving...and my friend and I was like if they're leaving, upstairs must really suck. And yes, it did! but we made the best of it.  I mean at some points it was good towards 1 o'clock. The crowd was very mixed. There was even a wedding and there was bunch of cliques (meaning more than 4 people) and not couples. Probably partying it up after work (since it was a Friday).   The music was mostly 90s.

But if you know me you know that empty pockets wont stop me from gettin giggy with it, yeah, I just said that. So, I went to Starlight with a couple of hotties on a Wed night. The DJ was sick and the crowd was pretty mixed. Everything from your low-end douches to your Suit's were getting down and dirty on the dance floor. The women... well let just say that my eyes were wide open all night, hard thing to do for an Asian.   Getting right to it... The music was good, but it was a Wed night not sure what they play on other nights. The girls were plentiful and the crowd was all about having fun. The down side is as is everyplace DT San Francisco is the high admission charge and cost of drinks.   All in all it was a good time. But I'm a firm believer that its the people you're with and not the venue that makes a good time.",

There is a lot to love about Harry Denton's starlight room-- It's almost like a historical landmark of San Francisco.. with an awesome view of the city and Union Square. The lounge is draped with red curtains, that appear to be straight outta the 70s and there are typically plenty of places to sit, as well as tons of space on the dance floor to move around. Either there has been a dj playing music or a live band playing music every time-- this last dj on Wednesday night was okay. I don't know if I would ever plan a whole entire evening at this lounge, but it always a fun place to stop on a night around town. ;-)",

Starlight is a lounge area on the top floor of the Sir Francis Drake, a design which really needs to be remodeled.   The place is a mixture of Peppermill that once was in Daly City and The Cafe which is a gay club in the Castro. Once one walks in there is a large bar on ones left and coat check and restrooms on the right. Walking in further is tables filled with people eating. So if your here for food, your going to have a bunch of people walking around you trying to squeeze into a tiny dance floor. And if you are hear to dance, your dancing to 80's music on a tiny little dance floor.   Just the combination of a restaurant and dance floor in a dilapidated decor isn't that bad when your talking about a small room to begin with. But to charge people a $15 cover just to do so is outrageous.",

I took a million and one pictures that I will keep under my pillow.   Moving my eyes from the beautiful outside to the beautiful inside, I spotted divine household accoutrements that would fair well within my humble abode - mostly sofas and chairs. I didn't take any home with me, but there's always next time.   As superficial as I tend to be with regard to aesthetic design, the mishmash deejaying and interesting array of people didn't phase me. Although, an interesting array of folk is something I do quite enjoy, mishmash musical adventures are not. I heard music from every genre that night. Maybe we can attribute this to it being a weeknight.  Mr. Denton, I plan to return to your room sometime in the near future.",

    "review_text": "Really love this place. We parked around the corner at 450 Sutter which is a 24 hr parking facility. Its tough to park around the hotel on the street, and Union Sqare garage is hit or miss, so try the Sutter garage.   We arrived to the Starlight Room about 8pm this past Saturday and stayed until 12:30. We got in before 8:30, so there was no cover charge. We were lucky enough to get a window table. I love the lounge itself with the sexy old school vibe, lots of \u00a0deep red texture carpets, high back 50's club style table settings, the shimmering gold bead curtain details, and romance in the air with the stunning views of the city through the walls of glass windows.   The music was very relaxing, slow grooves and classics perfect for the mood and atmosphere of the dining and cocktail experience. Our first server was Kendra. She is very elegant, and beautiful, and really took care of us for the first couple of hours. Every member of the staff the first shift of the evening were spectacular. We got to watch the sunset, and enjoy small plates by candle light. We tried the deep fried mac and cheese, the crab cakes, the chicken nuggets and the shrimp cocktail. I ordered mojitos and the husband ordered chocolate martinis. The food runner and the busboy were both wonderful, although I didnt get their names. Each of the small bites were delicious and great cocktail bites.   We were there to celebrate post nuptials with friends of ours. They arrived about 930, so we closed out our dinner tab to the tune of about $150 including tip. Kendra and staff of the first shift made that worth every penny.  We secured keeping our same table for the dancing part of the evening by handing over our credit card for the tab and were passed along to the second shift, which I will call the dj shift.   Alessandra was our server for the second shift. \u00a0Although the uniform is the same, the service level did come down a notch. There were no smiles, and the elegant service converted to a cocktail service. We did not feel the same treatment, but more the standard 'are we ok here?' Type of attitude. We were with a bride and groom and it would have been nice to have some sort of acknowledgment of that, with a smile and a personalized feel, but I digress. For the prices we are paying, we just expect more. I can go to a bar and be served anywhere, but the. Starlight is classy and patrons want that...   There were two Dj's I think. The vibe changed from romance to party time. The crowd was an interesting mix of 30 somethings to 50 somethings. The music was 90s to top 40, and Im not a big dancer by any means, but they got me out on the floor a LOT! We ordered two cocktails each, average of 12 bucks or so each. Our bride and groom sat at an adjacent table with a couple of their friends. I am not sure what they ordered.   As mentioned, The second shift server was not at all nearly as attentive. My husband even had to go to the bar to get a drink for the bride and groom as we waited quite some time for her to serve us... After a lot of fun dancing had by all we were ready to head out. Around midnight or so we asked to close our tab. Alessandra asked if we wanted to combine our tab with our friends table. Um, no, we have separate tabs as secured by our card. No smiles, no thank you, just heres your tab and see ya type of attitude. A TOTAL turn off considering we dropped 200 dollars here tonight! What a disappointment!   The brides shawl, which had been in the back of her chair the entire evening went missing. While the wonderful manager and door staff sought to find it for her, Alessandra seemingly hounded the bride and groom, by going back over to their table grabbing the tab and putting it in the grooms hands to get them to settle it. Um, how rude! They arent going anywhere darling, they are working to try and find her cover up since she IS in a wedding dress and it would be nice to take home the accompanying cover up for her dress on her wedding night. Just sayin!  All in all the experience, minus Alessandra, was wonderful. She loses a star for you. We will definitely be back, we just will request not to be seated in her section.",

Sometimes you feel like your lounging in the 1920's and 1930's and maybe you would run into a Don Draper lookalike. lol  I'm use to go going to the bars and lounges in Las Vegas so I'm use to chic and trendy. This would be nothing but a yawn to me but the 180 view of the city was breathtaking.  They have 3 different areas in the lounge:  1. Bar area: It's a bit small and it gets packed during the weekends because of the live bands and DJ. Bartenders are friendly but they have a limited selection, I tried to order an AMF but they were short on 2 liquors. Boo!! So I ended up order a Jack and Coke and sorry to say that was watered down! I can taste more coke then Jack, I ordered 2 more Jack and coke and sprite and I still felt no buzz. I was pissed but I didn't want to complain, so I just stuck with beer. I asked the bartender what kind of beer they have and he said, Coors Light, Budlight and Heinkein.   Really? Just three different kinds of beers.   Psssh!!  **WARNING** DON'T PAY WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD OR YOU'LL BE CHARGED $50, EVEN IF YOU BOUGHT ONE OR TWO DRINKS AND PAID LESS THEN $20. YOU'LL STILL BE CHARGED $50!! TOTAL BS!!  PAY CASH OR PREGAME BECAUSE THE DRINKS ARE WATERED DOWN!!   2. Dance Floor: The size of the floor was meh and the DJ was lame playing music from 70's, 80's, 90's and some top hits. I was hoping he'd play some house or trance music but you can always get everything. Lots of tourist and Francisco locals here at the Denton Lounge.   3. Table Area: One side of the lounge has an area to sit down and just relax with friends, spouse, bf, gf and etc...   Great to have a conversation while having some fine wine or beer and admiring the Downtown Skyline, Union Square, Bay Bridge and from a distance you can see SFO.  I wouldn't mind coming back for the lounge and looking at the city view. The cover can be expensive at $10 for what you get here but hotels guests get in free if you show your room key.",

SETUP  The Starlight Room is located on the 21st Floor of the Sir Francis Drake Hotel, and it is a TOTAL TRIP back in time to a more swanky, quasi-speakeasy feel. \u00a0I love it.  The music is usually cranking a wonderful mix of oldies, disco and some retro, along with the mainstay of pop and R&amp;B. \u00a0[Note: \u00a0if you are looking for a rave, house or really young clientele, this is NOT your place.]  WORK CREW  There is something here that a very diverse group of coworkers will enjoy here: \u00a0music, plush surroundings, comfortable seats, private alcoves, sparkly dance floor, astounding drinks, pleasant eye candy of all ages, genders, and denominations. ;)  HOURS  Unless you are part of a private event, you are pretty much out of luck getting in on a Monday Night. \u00a0[sometimes I wish I could since I would like to start here in the early evening, and then I just end up at DNA Lounge for Death Guild which goes late.] \u00a0But this is why it's important to check the calendar ahead of time so you won't be disappointed. \u00a0  SPECIAL EVENTS  They have a very cool Drag Brunch on Sundays, and most nights you can enjoy the mixing stylings of DJ Dave Gillis. \u00a0So it's hard to go wrong if you are looking for something that everyone will find a piece of that they really like at different times of the week. \u00a0  THE LOWDOWN  I really do love the Starlight Room, brought to you by Harry Denton. \u00a0:D",

There's a cover charge of $15 (by the I'm not a fond of) but whatever, it's my first time. Saturday night was packed, that included a bridal party. For the first time, we felt we were the youngest patrons in the crowd.  There was a live music but unless you are drunk then you won't care. In short it wasn't that great but they did a good job in hyping up the patrons. \u00a0We decided to just hang out at the bar. Cocktail prices were pricey, beer and Chambord sour for $20 something. The bartenders were friendly but my Chambord sour tasted like cough syrup, yuck. They do not have hypnotiq or the mix for my hurricane, boo!  Oh well, regardless we made the most of our cover charge. Hhmmm, I might check this place out on Wed night, I heard it's poppin. (dj = hiphop)",

Anyhow, it feels like the place is more of a tourist trap than anything. \u00a0The venue doesn't really command the price of the drinks. \u00a0It's nice to go there for the view and have a drink or two, but that's about all it's worth.",

Nice spread, omelet station with the obligatory prime rib. Fresh squeezed OJ, and mimosas!   As for the show, I have never had soo much fun at a brunch! No really, I thought it was pretty entertaining. It was pretty much G-rated so nothing really nasty. My phone sucked at taking pictures, so once my friend emails me the pics I will post them. So yes, I would say its worth the $45/person. Now when I go to Las Vegas, I just might consider something else than Cirque Du Soleil.

The crowd wasn't that huge compared to other yelp parties and they just didn't serve enough. People were literally hovering and running toward the kitchen grabbing food as soon as it left the kitchen.

The Sir Francis Drake is a charming old hotel and as far as we've ever known, it has had a good reputation. That is why we thought we would have a good experience at the brunch. As it turned out, we had such a bad experience that we couldn't believe it. \u00a0It was clear from the beginning the staff didn't have their act together. It started out with bad service and then the afternoon only went from bad to worse. It took forever and a day for the wait staff to take our drink order and then forever to get our drinks. BTW, a pitcher of Mimosas (a carafe, mind you) is priced at $60. Yes, you heard me...sixty dollars. \u00a0Cocktails are priced at $13. \\Only New York has worse cocktail prices but that's the Big Apple for you. Anyway, the tables are small and barely big enough to eat on. Halfway into the brunch, there was little food left on the buffet tables. We could not believe it. While I will spare you the other gory details, I will tell you I would not recommend this brunch. That it is ridiculously over-priced at $60 a pop (not including cocktails and tip) has got to mean they cater to the tourists. That others have raved about it is surprising considering the unfortunate experience we had. Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed with what we thought would be a fun afternoon.

After 20 minutes of sitting/chatting/drinking someone came over and claimed it was their table and kicked us out (despite the jacket there was no indication someone was there or occupying, the drinks were empty and dirty plates) as we tried to walk elsewhere a host finally seated us at \"reserved\" booths and the music was so loud you had to YELL over everything to basically talk to someone sitting next to you.  After maybe 30-40 minutes in total we walked out.",

Of course, it all comes at a higher price but with the scenic view and fun music it's a great once in awhile splurge and great spot to hang with friends.   The food there is actually quite good. I tasted their fried Mac n cheese and their chocolate dessert and liked both. Portions are small so don't come with an appetite! As for the drinks I wasn't quite sure what to get so our waitress made a pretty good recommendation for me based on my likes. I forgot what it was but I enjoyed it :) FYI the menu on their website isn't always up to date and one time they did not have the ice cream on their menu that I wanted to try so you could be in for a bit of a disappointment.  The crowd is definitely older but the parties thrown by outside promoters bring in younger people so you'll get a good mixed crowd on those nights. It could get really packed and when it does good luck flagging down your waitress! We were ready to pay our bill and head out but she never came by. In the end we went to go find someone ourselves to take care of it for us.   The times I went both with and without a reservation, weekday and weekend, I lucked out and got a table by the window. I would recommend making a reservation just to be sure you get a table and one by the window for a nice view.   I haven't tried the brunch but it sounds like a fun thing to check out.

It is a VERY interactive show :o) Host Donna Sashay is funny and charming, and the other performers were equally hilarious and engaging. My favorite was probably Cassandra Cass because she's pretty much Real Life Jessica Rabbit. Plus, her costumes were gorg.  The brunch part was super yummy too. Eggs benedict, prime rib carving station, chocolate covered strawberries, a variety of pastries, salads, and other breakfast items (bacon, canadian bacon, sausage, eggs, etc.). We also made sure to order plenty of mimosas as well. That really adds to the experience ;)  Got to take pics with the performers afterwards as well. LOVED IT!",

We had reservations for a table by a window which over looks all of the city. \u00a0Once we arrived, we were taken to a table immediately. \u00a0However, it was located directly by the kitchen. \u00a0Which was very busy. \u00a0It was Very uncomfortable and had the feel of as if we were apart of the staff. With that being said we turned the table down and asked to be seated at something more inviting. \u00a0They ended up moving us to a table on the left side of the restaurant 3 table from the kitchen. \u00a0Without complaining we decided to take that table and enjoy the view. \u00a0Within minutes our awesome waitress Monica, asked for our drink order and gave some great suggestions. \u00a0The birthday girl had a rum punch, her husband Belvi on ice with lime, I had a tipsy rabbit and our other friend had an easy sippin!!! \u00a0All I can say is yummy!!!. \u00a0With lots of people celebrating Christmas parties, the section to the right of us was being reserved for a wedding. \u00a0As the staff had been trying to keep others from wondering over to the area we thought we would help out and suggested that they bring a velvet rope there to show its was a VIP reserved area which they did finally. Chris, the security on site took over the area and from time to time had to walk away. \u00a0So again we suggested to Chis that WE would help monitor the area, Since we were sitting right there, so he could handle other area's of the lounge. He was AWSOME!!! Now the mood changes when we get this so called host named Robert. \u00a0He comes over to the velvet rope and says to us, \"We're gonna move you all. This is the worst table in the house.\" \u00a0When actually he wanted to give our table to another customer and place us back by the kitchen again!!!. \u00a0So of course we refused and as he looked down upon us as if we didn't belong in this establishment, we asked Monica to send over the manager. When the manager came to our table not only was he personable but he was so friendly!!! It was if we knew him for years. \u00a0His name is Derick Opela!!!! He, Monica and Chris 5 Diamond for this spot. \u00a0However that Robert, this place could really do without. Derick took exceptional care of us and sent us all a round of birthday drinks and treated us as if we were royalty. \u00a0With the 3 of them on staff we said we would defiantly return to this place. \u00a0It ROCKS big time.....even with that ol' evil Robert.",

The staff was super friendly and attentive. I was with a date and we both enjoyed the view, decor and ambiance. This place reminds me of an old skool place where mobsters, gangsters and back room politicians would plan and connive during the Roaring 20s. Red velvet curtains, high ceiling windows, crystal hanging from the ceiling, recessed lighting, skyline views and piano! I felt like lighting a cigar and sipping some $800.00 cognac. But I don't smoke cigars and drink my money. \u00a0   Our drinks were basic: Amaretto de Saranno and Stella beer. We also had raw Tuna Dip with chips. The chips were bland and reminded me of the Holy Wafers provided at communion. They were flavorless and the Tuna Dip could have used some added flavor. But it was OK and edible.

    "review_text": "Star light, star bright,  The first star I see tonight;  I wish I may, I wish I might,  Have the wish I wish tonight.  *Opens Eyes**  WTH, I didn't wish for a room full of Sugar Daddies!!!  I was going to give Starlight Room 2-3 stars after my nightlife experience on 11/10; however, this wouldn't be fair since most clubs can't control the type of crowd they attract/bring in. I also had to take into account the company holiday party I organized here 3 years ago, hence the 4 Stars.  ***N I G H T L I F E*** Since we had Veterans Day off, my friends and I wanted to party the night before. I remember hearing about Wed (Indulgence) Hip Hop Nights hosted by Sebastien Entertainment, so we decided to give it a shot.  LINE: We got there at 10:30 PM and the wait was less than 2 mins.  COVER:  Free before 11 PM, if you're on the GL; otherwise it's $10.  DRESS CODE: Although no dress code was stated on the FB invite, SR is not a place to come rocking your newest kicks. It's a very classy venue, so dress to impress!  CROWD: SUGAR DADDY AND COUGAR CENTRAL! The average age was about 50--I kid you NOT! There was probably a 3:1 ratio of men to women and the majority were tourists. It wasn't our scene, so we left to Infusion. I think the crowd is a result of the event being under promoted.   MUSIC: Top 40s, Hip Hop and Pop. Guest DJ Primetyme was awesome; good mixes and smooth transitions. The music was so good; we even contemplated coming back here after leaving to Infusion.   BAR: There's a main bar upon entering SR and a make-shift one near the dance floor. They have an extensive array of liquor including many rare and expensive ones.   DRINKS: $11 for top shelf liquor which is reasonable considering it's an upscale venue in a historic downtown hotel. Generous shots were served in cups.   Bottle service was available for $150/ bottle for Absolut and $200/bottle for Goose which probably needs to be booked ahead of time from the promoters to lock in this price.   AMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: SR is very classy and reminiscent of the 1930s with deep red velvet booths and draping, diamond chandeliers and staff decked out in a white tux and black bow tie. There are about 6-8 booths reserved for bottle service. The dance floor is pretty tiny and probably the size of 4 cubicles. There's PLENTY of dancing room as most of the crowd wasn't the dancing type.   The main attraction is the GORGEOUS 360-degree view of San Francisco. It's truly breathtaking to see a bird eye's view of SF's landmarks and the city lights on a crisp night. SR is definitely a great place to bring out-of-towners or a date for drinks.  PARKING: Street parking is difficult but not impossible at night. I got parking 1.5 blocks away after circling just once. Otherwise, there's valet parking.   ***P R I V A T E \u00a0E V E N T*** Since I organized a company holiday party 3 years ago, my review is very dated and lacks precise detail. However, the customer service was excellent and I didn't have a panic attack, so it's very noteworthy. (Do note that SR is open to the public at 9:30 PM.)   Jaime, the Events Manager at the time was very easy to work with. She was very friendly, professional and responsive. She always responded to my calls and/or e-mails within 24 hours.   I told Jaime our company budget and she gave us several options on how we can maximize our budget. She helped us work out a plan so that we can offer unlimited red and white wine. And, as a surprise she even had the bartender make a specialty cocktail with our company color which we handed out drink tickets for.   We ordered 2 stations: North Beach Station (antipasti and various pastas) and Chinatown Station (dim sum dishes). Although the stations were suppose to be more like hors d'oeuvres, the food portions were very generous so everyone was well fed. I did have some doubts about the lack of authenticity of the Chinatown Station, but was told that they have Chefs that specialize in each region of cuisine. And, from what I remember, the har gow, sui mai, and char siu bao tasted similar to what you get in Chinatown, Sunset, or Richmond.  DJ Dave Gillis is SR's in-house DJ, so we didn't have to bother looking for one. DJ Gillis was very easy to work with as well. He sent me playlists to look through beforehand and played songs that suited our employees. Most of our workforce was engineers, so needless to say, there was no Flo Rida's \"Get Low\" or Kelis' \"Milkshake\".   As far as the event went, it went off without a hitch. My former colleagues aren't party animals, but everyone enjoyed the food and getting to mingle with each other outside of work. I got commendation for days about how well the event went, but I have to thank the staff at SR for helping to organize a successful event that was virtually stress-free.   All in all, although the nightlife crowd was not my cup of tea, I would come back to SR for the music and venue not without good company of course...",

The building isn't high enough, or isn't situated high enough so you get blocked by other buildings around.   Music: went in at around 10, the music was for the older crowd. I didn't know the music, but i knew they were not normal club music for the young. Tried to dance, but it was awkward, maybe I am awkward. Most people dancing around that time are old. However, as it gets later in the night, the music changed to the normal club music, which makes the room HOT!  Drink: reasonably priced. Folks, this is one of the best spot in SF, so no $5 cocktail OK? go to a college bar or something if you are looking for cheap drinks. The cocktails were well made, my Cable Car was very very tasty. I licked the cinnamon on the rim...YUM!  Restroom: amazingly clean!! Unlike many other club/bar when it gets late and drunk people start puking.  Host: the host who led us to the seat was a sweetheart! He watched my purse when I left it on the seat and hit the dance floor. By the time I came back, he gave me a little sweet talk, warning me that there are people here just waiting for purses like that to be left on the seat.  Overall, it's a great experience. As busy as it is around union square, I didn't have much trouble finding street parking around at night both time I went there.",

I am always amazed how such a kooky group of people, all make their way out to the Starlight Room- to drunkenly and awkwardly attempt to dance on a dance floor \u00a0- overlooking all of San Francisco.  It's genius. That's what it is.  Seeing some unshaven hipster couple bust out moves beside a graying couple - her squeezed into a way too tight sequin dress - while he dons an awkward fitting Dockers blazer and tapered khaki pants, \u00a0makes me smile. \u00a0I love it.  I appreciate that the dance floor is just as entertaining as the phenomenal view - through the big glass windows lining the dance floor. And when I say phenomenal - I mean it - a breathtaking view of downtown San Francisco and Union Square.  But view and amazingly strange crowd aside, there is something off about the Starlight Room. While it's fun to visit on one off occasions - it's not the kind of place I'd necessarily roll into regularly.  There's a bizarre cheesy factor to the place - which can be exciting at times - because you never know who you're going to be standing next to, or talking to; but at the same time - it's just that: a surreal world - where you just don't really know who you're talking to.   The Starlight Room seems strangely familiar - but at the same time - cold and unbalanced. It's not the kind of place that I would want to step into alone. There's just wayyyyyyyy to many strange characters walking around here.  My advice on how to best enjoy this space: dress up and go on a fun date here. Cuddle into one of their dimly lit booths. Or go with a group of friends who can appreciate quality people watching. Because this place delivers. And then some.  Trust.",

I'm from Los Angeles and I still found that outrageous...  Music, straight out of the nineties, if not earlier. Only one song was played from this decade and that was Macklemore's \"Thrift Shop\". If you're looking for a hot spot to dance in, this is not it. Dance floor was filled with older folks who are probably staying at the hotel. Want to see 50 year olds jitterbug to Prince? This is your place! Plus the DJ clearly did not know what he was doing, as he would play one upbeat song, and then immediately play three songs that all you could do was step to.   After all that dancing, I figured it would be nice to sit. NOPE. All the tables were reserved, which really takes away from the ambiance, when you can't sit in their pretty red booths (part of what drew me there in the first place).  All in all, a DISAPPOINTING experience. If you've never been there, I wouldn't go expecting much. I'm sure the drag brunch is great, but seeing as I already spent $40+ to be disappointed, I'll not spend the extra $90 to see if their drag queens are as good as ours.",

Broad generalization would be tourists and 'bridge and tunnel', people having a good time, but the venue feels kitschy and not quite worth the $15 cover.   I went during holiday party season, so quite a few cocktail dresses, in addition to typical SF jeans and t-shirt look.   Nice view of Union Square from the dance floor, though it was so steamy in there that it looked blurry even after rubbing the windows. Semi crowded dance floor, and dancing itself was barely ok... music was eclectic to the point that the DJ must not have been watching the crowd (or didn't care) that when he drastically changed genres he lost half of his dance floor.  Might be ok with a table, but long wait at bar (though stiff drinks)",

He came over about 5 minutes later, told us some stories &amp; bought us a round. How very awesome is that?   Such a great time at the starlight room, as always! A must go place in union square.",

They encourage you to go back multiple times. \u00a0Extra points for the guy who busses the empty plates! \u00a0He does not let dirty dishes linger! \u00a0Then.... it is Showtime. \u00a0I've seen Donna Sachet around for years.... but.... I had no idea how talented she really is. \u00a0She is the Star of the show, and the MC. \u00a0She sings in her own voice..... and is completely hysterical when she is talking with the audience. \u00a0She goes by every table, and makes everyone feel so welcome..... like she is doing the show just for them. \u00a0She looks every person in the eye as she makes her rounds. \u00a0The other performers are fantastic...... Each one with a different style. \u00a0My Republican parents LOVED it! \u00a0I did not tell them it was a drag show till we got there!",

Windows wrap all the way around the restaurant. There were beautiful chandeliers and the booths had 1930's style stripes. I can't wait to come back for a meal in the daytime and just look at the view. The dance floor is small but there are windows on 3 sides of it. The night I was there they alternated between a live band and a DJ. Both of which were fun to dance to. The crowd is pretty varied. It is 21 and up but I would say its geared more towards over 30 but it really varies. The Starlight Room is perfect for a night of getting dressed up and celebrating in a beautiful location.",

We came by on a weeknight and ordered two pretty tasty gin and tonics- a little pricey but not outlandishly so.   The place is big and feels very plush- must be all the red velvet. It definitely looks like a \"Starlight Room\", I think I heard \"fun-bougie\" being thrown around.   The view is nice, although it can't quite compete with The View (the bar) down the street. \u00a0There were a good number of people there but its spread out enough not to feel cramped. Patrons seemed to be in the 30-40ish range.   We finished our drinks and were ready to head out when the waitress stopped by with two more cocktails on the house. I'm not sure what we did to deserve them (or who chose the drinks), but we were pretty jazzed (the Starlight Room demands words like \"jazzed\").   Mine was an appropriately cool old fashioned, my friend got something in a sugared martini glass that tasted like a snickerdoodle. We really enjoyed both- not sure how much of that was the free talking.  If I get comped drinks every time I come here this is a six star place, for now I'm leaving it at a solid three. It sounds like you have to see the Sunday performance to really experience the S-Room, so maybe I'll be back soon.",

No lines and it helped that we were hotel guests... as guests we only paid $5 cover as opposed to $10. I think $10 is a little ridiculous for this \"club\" to charge. The dance floor is teeny tiny and despite them playing Top 40, it's not very hip -- their live band ran us off the dance floor a few times -- but I suppose the view is worth it. \u00a0Bonus? We all hit the sack at different times so it was really convenient to just take the elevator down to our rooms. Bottom line: If you're not staying here and you're under the age of 35, I wouldn't make this a destination, esp. if you're looking to get your groove on.   Minus stars for: -Price for what you get: drinks are rather expensive and watered down... 1 gimlet + 1 Ketel One Vodka Cranberry ran me $22!  -Older crowd (like 50+!) -Decor/live band",

Adorned with photos of Harry himself, arm-in-arm which C-list celebrities who once frequented his nightclub and were so desperate for attention they braved the fabulously unhip locale of Union Square and the tourists that come with it, The Starlight Room is that cheerleader: head fully of glory, facade that was oh-so-pretty 20 years ago, and a flood of tourists coming to relive her past every night of every day since then.",

There weren't too many people so we were able to move around on the small dance floor also.  I really wasn't expecting Hubert Keller to be such an energetic DJ. He seemed so composed on Top Chef Masters, but the man behind Fleur de Lys knows how to party! He was fist pumping, clapping, dancing, and was just really getting into it. There also was a live saxophonist that played along with Keller's EDM set, which added a cool acoustic effect. His energy was infectious, and it looked like everyone had a good time. I know I did. Now I feel more inclined to try his restaurants.   I also want to apologize to the pretty, blonde waitress for questioning her about whether I got the correct drink. I feel like such a dick.

After a weekend of excessive partying in Fog City to celebrate one of my last nights out as a \"Single Lady\", my girlfriends and I settled in for a delicious brunch, and one of the BEST drag shows I've ever seen. I'm not sure what it is about Drag Queens, but I love them. Maybe it's all the work the girls put in to looking SO beautiful, the sheer showmanship of it all, or the fact that they just seem to LOVE to celebrate. And well, let's be honest, I WAS celebrating my last fling before that ring goes on for good!  The peach Bellinis flowed almost as well as the gowns, and the food was decadent. Fresh made omelets, juicy prime-rib, some of the best lox I've ever tasted, and brioche French toast to top it all off.   But you should know, I was sad to have missed you at this performance. I know you enjoy a visit on most Sunday's. I hope you don't mind, though, when a woman sitting near me asked if her mate would recognize you had you been there, I chimed in with, \"Oh, Mr. Denton is hard to miss. A fairly short and some-what stocky man with a great laugh, you'd know if he had been here...\" And I ended with a heavy sigh, because I did miss you.  I hope to see you soon, Harry!

    "review_text": "I can definitely see how someone would think that this place is a touch on the cheesy side, but there's something about it that I like. The views are amazing -- clearly the selling point here -- and the drinks and service are good. I really (really!) like how they lay out their menu, decade by decade, with drinks to match. It's a fun concept and the drinks that I've tried are definitely well executed. The overall vibe is kind of old school San Francisco with a little tourism factor, but there is live music in the evenings (at least on the weekends) which I find pretty fun! In terms of VIEWS, \u00a0I would take the Top of the Mark over Harry Denton's, but I think both provide pretty views for people visiting the city.",

We entered and where greeted by a nice young man (Derek) who we later found out was the manager.  Anyway he sat us by a window near the dance floor. He asked if we had ever been to The Starlight Room. we told him no and that we where here from GA. He told us he was also from there and moved out here with his girl friend and they loved it here. He suggested the cougar trap for my wife (Maybe a prelude? lol) and a \u00a0Cable car for myself as well as telling us his favorite dish here being the Chicken &amp; waffles and the Mac &amp; Cheese. He was right on the money!!. We wondered about the room and it is a beauty!.  It has this old rat pack kinda style to it. lots of reds and the cocktails dresses wow!! Classy! our cocktail was wonderful! Then the DJ came on and it turned into a really cool funky nightclub.   The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is cause the Mac and cheese came out not so hot. But here came Derek again to save the day!!. He apologized and assured us that it was unusual and that he would remedy it right away! He took it away somewhere and not 5 mins later was back with hot mac &amp; cheese.and cooked us a fresh batch himself (or so he said) now that is customer service!!",

Definitely a great place for a date night (HINT, HINT) ;) We were seated at a table with the best view. It was so pretty!! They have drinks from way back in the 1800's. I am obsessed with the Old Hollywood era &amp; the history of this place fascinates me. The old Sinatra music they played was the icing on the cake.   We ordered our drinks &amp; because I can't stand the taste of alcohol I couldn't drink my drink so I ordered a glass of champagne. To our surprise a nice gentleman behind us with his wife bought our drinks. See, \u00a0this is why I love San Francisco so much... People are so nice!!!  Around 9:30 or 10 a DJ started to play some new &amp; old R&amp;B music &amp; we wanted to dance sooo bad. But we were not about to give up our seats lol It was packed for a Wednesday night I was surprised. The crowd was perfect not to many old people not to many young. It was a good mix. We both said we would come back again.",

Problem is they only give you 5 small ball-shaped nuggets (for $9 ._.) \u00a0I was a bit inebriated at this point from my herby drink and probably could have consumed more nuggets than I'd like to admit..but I stopped myself from ordering more haha.  After our nuggets, we moseyed on towards the dance floor where the view was. \u00a0It was a nice view. \u00a0I'd imagine sunset would be very nice here. \u00a0We didn't dance but we \u00a0watched people getting their groove on on the dance floor. \u00a0  As we left, we saw that the guy near the entrance was charging a cover for entrance. \u00a0Not sure how much it was, but I guess if you get there early enough there's no cover! \u00a0I personally wouldn't want to come if there was a cover, but I had a really nice time, despite my poor choice in alcoholic beverage.",

The view is great but it was hard to take any pictures from up there due to the loud speakers so you'll have to take my word for it. Drinks were expensive but the live band and DJ made the overall experience worth it. Better than any place in Monterey, that's for sure.   I'd love to visit in the day next time I'm in the city. Not a place to go to meet women. Starlight room is more of a date location. We had an expectation of dress code here, but people walked in in sandals and hooded sweatshirts... must be a California thing... I was slightly disappointed.  P.S. Don't expect a table unless you agree to a $300.00 bar tab!",

Last Saturday, we came here for a friend's birthday. \u00a0I looked at the drink menu online prior to arrival so I knew I wanted the drink called Devilish - a sweet combination of apple juice, vodka and ginger beer! \u00a0I quite liked it (although my bf thought the price of $10 was a little over-priced). \u00a0The entry cover was $10 too - we're not big club-goers, so oh well, we can stand to pay a bit of a cover every so often. \u00a0  It was a hot day that day and with all the body heat and drinking, it was quite steamy in the Starlight Room. \u00a0We were tired and were getting slightly dehydrated so we headed out a little early. \u00a0Good times though and at least I finally got to experience this landmark bar &amp; club. \u00a0Happy Birthday, Susan!!

The dance floor has a beautiful view and mirrored ceiling and a disco ball which is cool. The DJ was ok but nothing exciting.   The place is a tad too dark for my liking \u00a0and once you start dancing you can feel the heat and I was sweating like crazy. They have a terrace but it was off limits and that made me feel claustrophobic.   I would probably come back here but given the choice I would go try other places first.",

Drinks are expensive but good. The music sucked!!! Wedding music??? Lol for instance Electric slide and 70s disco? I could see my filipino folks dancin into those music hahaha I was hoping that they play some Hiphop music to pop my booty on the dance floor :) also they played older music that reminded me from high school such as 50 cent \"in da club\" and seeing older people dancing into it. In addition, I believe that this lounge is more an older crowds since I have seen a lot of those mingling around. Therefore, not really my scene. Although, props for getting in for free and a table from that hostess or bouncer ;)",
