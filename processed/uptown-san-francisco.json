That's 4 so far. Damn, am I easy or what? The crowd is usually an eclectic mix of patrons. Intelligent conversation is a hit and miss - but pool and cheap drinks - well that's almost always a resounding thumbs up!  Some endearing things about the uptown:   Bartenders: They have always been cool, quick on the draw, and friendly if a little bit bored seeming (depends on the night).   Small world: I've met random people that previously knew from my my past life in a small town over 300 miles away  Scorpions: WTF? Yeah. They have some Tequila with a scorpion in it. Any takers?  Some not so endearing things about the Uptown:  Panhandling crackheads: soliciting you for $1.43 at 2AM when all you have left is enough for a slice of cheese pizza  Interesting clientele: Hit or miss. Usually miss - at least on the poolside of things. Minus one star. Boo Hoo.  Overall, I would recommend the Uptown a great place to get hammered and play some pool on a budget. A great place to drink when you don't feel like dressing up, and a great place to go when you want to escape everything pretentious. I've usually always had a good time here. I keep coming back - so go figure. Maybe I'll see you across the bar some night.",

Shuffling in to the Uptown, which was completely empty, we ordered a round. Our beers were... well, beers - not the best selection in the world - but Tracee was all over her vodka tonic, which was heavy on the alci-mi-hol, and we couldn't argue about the prices. (Cash only, BTW...)  So we ordered another round. And another.  The screening went surprisingly well. The complete arseness of the movie was dampened by the room spinning. Wheee!  We stopped in for another round afterwards, before we met the aspiring moviemaker and her crew for dinner. At this point, the place was full of douches who were trying their best to look trendy - and failing miserably. We downed our round and left.  I'd give this place three, but for simply fuelling me with beer to get me through that screening, they get one extra.",

Wood-paneled walls and a scratchy couch and a wobbly little bar they put in themselves, with a set of old poker chips... All kinds of games we didn't know how to play... Rituals we hadn't been initiated into yet... But we pretended...   We practiced growing up to be Polish drunks just like the Polish drunks smoking their pipes and drinking their vodka upstairs -- we just didn't realize that by the time we were grown up, we wouldn't have any place so authentic as Uncle Nick's basement to be drunk in.

It was convenient, considering it was literally a timed one-minute walk from my crappy Capp St. apartment. It was cheap, the fare of a well-drink did its duty as I was rendered drunk enough to view the unemployed deadbeat patrons that visited this fine establishment as almost attractive enough to forgive their questionable hygiene and their skateboards that litter the floor. I was also lucky enough to carve a reputation for myself as a local pool shooter in the back room, because I too, was a local unemployed deadbeat who had nothing better to do than to play pool all day. However, as Bob Dylan once said, these times, they are a changin'.   Alas, the glory days of Uptown are no more as a new customer base started frequenting the bar -- customers that actually have jobs. I left the city right when the PBR stopped flowing, the pool table price was upped to a dollar and the young techies/brogrammers started coming to the bar to get a \"real\" dive bar experience. The worst part? Someone even had the audacity to fix the broken toilet seat in the women's bathroom. If you can't cry or do drugs on a crappy toilet in a dive bar, what's the point? Go back to whence you've came, Stanford graduates who work at start-ups! You're making our shit-hole meet the city's health and safety code! Go code somewhere else. (Pun intended.)   I give Uptown 4/5 for the fond memories and the sharp pool shooters that kicked my ass and taught me how to be a better pool player and for the bartenders, because they don't give a shit about you and that's how all bartenders should be.",

The bar is dingy(like a dive bar should be), but has plenty of places to sit.Benches in the pool room.Big frat couches, booths and bar stools.People bring their bikes, dogs, and babies even one night, into the bar, and its great.The first night i went i actually had shit stolen off my bike so ive been keeping it in the bar now when i go.The neighborhood is certainly interesting.Prostitutes and drug dealers \u00a0are usually hanging outside, but they are fairly harmless.  So the bathrooms are easily accessible and never have a wait.Plus the bartenders with the exception of one, are VERY friendly and very quick.There is one short bartender who is very cool and is ones of the best bartenders i have ever seen.  So i hope to make this my neighborhood after work dive.",

The jukebox, like the bar is an eclectic mix so whatever you're into you should be able to find something you dig.

The best part about this place is that there is no posturing or scenester bullshit, just real folks who like to get their drink on. Definitely not the kind of place you will find Blondie's overflow. (NOTA) The Bar is in the center of the space so it won't take a half hour to get a drink. If you're there by 11:30 or so you can probably catch the Tamale Lady before she heads to Zeitgeist!",

And crowd does not have a lot of smelly people!

I forgot her name, but I'll edit this later to put in her name.  This is our to go to bar. We know familiar faces. My bf knows more than familiar (no, not at all any intimate, hah)  But sometimes, the crowd can be really annoying because they tend to play the song over and over and over again. Please, just stop. And sometimes, when the night is mellow, you can see their faces, instead of focusing on socializing with and showing interest to their friends, they look around, every minute or two, to see if there's anything \"going on\". It's kind of like the boredom you see on kid's faces back in high school when they're always waiting for something to happen. But that's just sometimes. Sometimes, the crowd can be really energetic.  I must say, crowd is changing.. Is it because this \"hipster\" scene is no longer at its appealing peak, and people are capitalizing on it since its fall?  We have met some douchebags here. But there is always a douchebag everywhere.  Nevertheless, still a 5 star because it is a great bar.",

The selection of drafts is the respectable variety you typically see in mission bars (Paulaner, Trumer Pils, Hoegaarden, Sierra Nevada, Stella, Racer 5, Prohibition, Anchor Steam, etc). Pints are about $4 or $5, about average price.   The bartender poured our beers without tilting the glass at all and waited a little while for it to settle before serving it. Not to be rude, but tipping the glass should be rule #1 for serving draft beer, I couldn't believe that. If your bartender can't properly pour you a beer, then what the hell can you count on in the world?  Definitely a good bar for peoplewatching. You can bring your dog too, if that's your thing.

After ordering our pints and heading for the empty sofas, I felt nature's call and headed for what I thought was the men's restroom. I walked down into a pitch-dark cavern and wandered endlessly inside it, still convinced that it was the men's room and I'd find a urinal somewhere nearby. After feeling my way around, I decided to turn back and exit this mysterious grotto and use the ladies' room instead.  And so I used the ladies' room, but was confused as to why there was a urinal in there. Of course, it turns out that it was the men's room all along, and I had previously stumbled into some type of storage area.   I remember enjoying the music, the quadrant of sofas surrounding a coffee table, the cozy atmosphere, and the dearth of patrons. Just the right type of environment in which to pass out. Which we both did, for a time, in between my unsuccessful attempts to vomit (having found my way to the restroom with ease now).   I must return at another time to assess the place, and avoid drinking Racer Five at all costs.",

Maybe it's the homeless people gathering outside, or the faint and wavering smell of urine. Either way it doesn't matter.

The lack of light, signage, the permanent odor of urine on that particular corner of the Mission.  It's not my favorite dive bar, but it always draws a crowd, so maybe it's just me.  Last time I went there it was to meet some good friends - a married couple and another dude. I drank Makers and ginger ale, and the bartender poured my drinks generously. I appreciated that, and I appreciated that the music droned at a low ambient level that was conducive to conversation. We stayed for hours.  Eventually, the place thinned out, and my married friends left too. My other friend wanted to chat up some girls at the bar and wanted - I'll say it - a wing man. I obliged, although I definitely didn't see what he was seeing (maybe whiskey goggles aren't as powerful as the beer variety?).  He was still talking to them when I left, an hour or so later, and as I stepped into a taxi, I got a text message from him: \"going home too. that girl had hella bad breath!\"  Yep. Dive bar.",

My friend gets aggressive and demands his phone back, the bartender kicks the woman out, and we think, \"Wow - what a great story.\" But it doesn't end there. Turns out - while my boyfriend is smoking a cigarette outside, the woman reaches into his front junk pocket and tries to take whatever goodies he has in there. This was after she was given the boot, and yet she still was hungry for more. Ohhh, the Uptown.  Other than that, I think this place is just okay and I guess I don't really have an opinion.",

A guy in a business suit was on his cell phone discussing his cool Saturday night party plans i.e. \"I guess I'll go to the Mission, I know it's cliche and all...\" This is pretty much a summary of going to a bar in the Mission on a Saturday night: a yuppie dude in a suit crusing around \"bars in the Mission.\" Not like I need another reason NOT to go to a bar (which are generally expensive, boring, and full of idiots), but that's a pretty good one right there. The Uptown, however, is one bar is do enjoy.  Not only is it generally less full of people than most bars, most of them are not idiots (I am not disputing the possibility that they may be crazy, but hey, that's part of the charm). In fact, the occasional random person I chat with (which is not many as I generally don't talk to people I don't know at bars, hence another reason i could just sit in my living room and pay less monies), is charmingly weird but for the most part non-threatening. Like the psychic lady who my friends and I encountered on Saturday. She had a lot of information about our lives which I have to say was fairly inaccurate, but she was pretty intuitive and a definite interesting character. Totally non-threatening! Plus the drinks are cheap, and if you do get bored with the clientele inside the bar, you can always pop outside and chat with the colorful array of fiends and working ladies or M-to-ladies out for a gentle evening stroll.",

    "review_text": "This place has the dive-bar attitude and decor but without the disgusting, unusable bathrooms. It typically has plenty of seating in the form of wooden booths and sofas. The pool room has just the one table and is a bit cramped, but the surface is in better shape than the felt on tables at most bars. What's more, there's rarely a line to play, and each game only costs 50 cents. The jukebox has a good selection of rockin' tunes (read: classic rock, punk, Johnny Cash and the like), and the clincher is that the drinks are cheap: $2 for a standard beer, $3 for a premium beer and $3 for a well drink. The crowd manages to keep its contingents of the too-cool-for-schoolers and the scenesters to a minimum, so it tends to be nice and chill.",

Uptown is pretty much exactly what I'd imagine a dive bar to be with a random crowd and decently priced drinks. If you're here during drinking hours, it may be hard to find a place to sit down since there aren't that many seats. The thing that stuck out most to me at this bar is all the action figures and dolls sitting atop the bar shelves. It's just a random collection of things that have arms and legs. There's also a pool table in a room that should be bigger (you might hit someone when shooting). I like this place a lot more than those other 2 dive bars I just mentioned. It had more a homely SF feeling to me. If you need a drink at some a straight up dive in the Mission, this is a good option. However, I've been to some other amazing dives that might be more worthwhile elsewhere in SF such as Zeitgeist.",

Lots of old soul and jazz on the juke, pool, pinball, board games, weird books and friendly folks. It's in a shithole neighborhood (2 blocks from Valencia), but they still don't need a bouncer. The bartenders are nice, the regulars are actually articulate, interesting folks and no one minds if you smoke a joint right outside the door.

Notice there is no listing for San Francisco. Except this bar apparently. If I dig really hard I guess I could assume it is uptown from the crackheads down the alley, or uptown from a few liquor stores. It is, however, not uptown in the sense that one would typically associate with this word.   I, personally, find this to be a good thing. This bar is worn, and by worn I mean the furniture is banged up, the pool table is uneven, drinks are strong, the ATM kiosk is often broken, the fireplace could double as a fire hazard and pieces of the floor are missing.   It, however, seems to attract a great friendly unpretentious mix of people from the neighborhood......and not a one of the crackheads who reside outside.

Yes we have a limited supply and we need to solve the worlds water problems but guess what? WE NEED IT TO LIVE! My girlfriend and I walked across half the city to get to this dive (which up until this point was a favorite bar of mine.) She asked me to get her a water and I tried my best. After the douche-bag bartenders third \"you can't have water jerk\" comment I told him to fuck off and walked back to our booth. Upon hearing this my girlfriend got up and asked him \"Are you really not gonna give me a water?\" He gave her a couple words and she pointed out that we were here with 20 or so people. Easily three quarters of the bars customers. \"What if they all ordered water?\" he said. Good point guy. You're an asshole. At that point I was pissed and started yelling about what a dick he was, fuck you for not giving us water, who made you god of the drunks, etc, etc....All he could do is cower into his corner and cry that \"I don't like the way you are talking to me.\" Oh boo-hoo you fucking moron! Wow, ruined my night. I wanted to leave and almost had all 20 convinced to leave but they were expecting more friends. Who am I to ruin a poor girls party. So I played pool and had a some friends buy a few beers for me. I didn't want to give that jackass the satisfaction of getting me a drink.

It has pool, friendly bartenders, relatively inexpensive drinks, a number of good beers on draft and pinball. \u00a0If I ever get around to making a list of the 10 worst men's restrooms in San Francisco, this one is going on it. On the other hand, fastidious people probably wouldn't go in here anyway. Plus, I always clean my bathroom after every time I go here, so it does create good habits, which is unusual for bars.",

I was here on a Thursday night and the place was pretty full, but not overcrowded. My friends and I were still able to sit down and hear each other talk. Also, I want to note that the bartender was fair in his choosing the order of people at the bar to serve. I didn't have to wait too long, the drinks were strong, and no one felt like there were any \"favorites\" being picked over them.  The clincher for me giving this place a 5 star review? Well, I stupidly put my things on the back of the toilet in the ladies room. Note, there is a FAT HOLE IN THE WALL behind the toilet. So, I recently had my iPhone stolen. I had JUST got a new phone that day. What do I do with it 10 hours later? I nearly toss my phone into the abyss that is the FAT HOLE IN THE WALL behind the toilet. My 3 friends and I tried to reach into the hole to recover the phone and none of us could see and/or reach it. \u00a0I left my roommates phone number with the bartender, and less than a day later, the bar called saying they had retrieved my phone!!!  Not that I am a pessimist or anything, but there is no way I expected to have had a fun night, paired with cheap drinks AND a bar staff nice enough to actually recover my lost phone and call me to let me know they had it and were keeping it safe and sound forever.  Given the above, I will not only be a continued patron here, but I will be a BIG TIPPER :)   THANK YOU UPTOWN BAR!",

Space was chill with limited seating and a RING OF COUCHES we filled till our exodus to the arcade &amp; pool area. The ~60 VIDEO GAMES cabinet was neat, though a number of its titles were obscure. Not \"OG nerdstalgia cooler than thou because I remember it\" obscure but \"nobody played this then and we wouldn't want to now\" obscure. 50c per play, quarters only.  LORD OF THE RINGS pinball was a novel item, but access to its features and progressive scenarios was tough to the point of the game not being as fun as it could've been. It obviously contained characters set up to move and multiple storylines, but they were too strange to activate. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OMr0nHetvlhSSZjD_OGVhQ&amp;userid=WALNtcSZlONK4Yj-o3pzKA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>  Surprise box of free LEFTOVER PASTRIES from a later bartender's friend's bakery was cool. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=c93FqCcSvymXr_Of6PiyAQ&amp;userid=WALNtcSZlONK4Yj-o3pzKA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>  Tagged-up no-lock bathrooms were BYOAS (Bring Your Own Art Supplies).

I thought the point of a bar was to attract patrons. \u00a0  Never mind that the couches smell like a bum peed all over them and the guys at the pool table stand around making small talk and then chew you out when you try to play pool (sorry, maybe you have a pending game, but if I'm watching no one do a thing for 15 minutes and then walk up to start a game and you give me douchy pseudo-hipster attitude and tell me someone else has the table, you're officially an asshole). The bartender was enough to turn me off of this place all on her own.  For starters, smile a bit, and don't act like such a hater. Also, when my friend tells you it's his birthday and you make him a nearly $7 drink, don't make snide remarks to me about how I'm not a good enough friend and should be buying his drink for him. Maybe you could take a hint from Elbo Room, or Casanova, or any number of the other bars we went to who gave him free drinks. Or if free drinks aren't your thing, that's fine, just don't give me lip when you don't even know me.   Honestly, this place does it for some people, but not for me. I'm far happier spending my money at bars whose employees make an effort to give two shits about their patrons.",

It's a pretty standard dive bar, with a crappy tv in one corner, and some couches in the back that obviously have seen better days.
