There were about 10 people dancing and dressed in jeans and a t-shirt.

The place was nice and chill, but my experience with one of the bartenders was not so pleasant, hence the 2 stars.   We went to Carbon last Saturday for our friends' birthdays. The place was nicely decorated and spacious for our group of 15. We decided to get drinks at the bar by the back of the room. The bartender (this bald Asian dude) was obviously irritated cause we took a little longer to order. The place was empty, let me repeat - empty. I apologized anyway cause I understand it could be annoying to make people wait for your orders.   The worst part was when I accidentally knocked one of the shot glasses over. I apologized. Again, the bartender didn't say anything, his facial expression remained annoyed and irritated. I said I'd pay for the replacement shot. He looked like he didn't even acknowledge me. Then, he proceeded to clean the counter top with napkins annoyingly and splashed the spilled liquid all over my shirt. I was like \"what the f@*%?\" No apologies, whatsoever... Did I mention that all this time, the whole place was EMPTY?? \u00a0  I probably would not come back here again, not for that kind of BS service...",

The music was ok, they placed some decent hip hop songs, but also some not so great music. Drinks will run you about $10 each for hard alcohol. At least there are places to sit since it wasn't packed, and plenty of street parking (you can also park in the Safeway parking structure if there is no street parking available).

The interior design of the place is ideal for a lounge with a blend of classic and modern design, and is held together with sleek dark colors. They have two bars seating areas for those that like to mingle and relax and a lively dance floor for those with the urge to twerk.  I met the owners of the place outside and they are easy-going guys who are willing to socialize with patrons and want to ensure everyone is having a good time. Can't say that about a lot of other places in SF. They even offered our group free shots!   Overall, the place is new, modern, and welcoming. Great place to try out and there isn't a cover!",

Ken responded quickly to our questions, addressed issues that were mentioned in other yelp reviews and cleared up any concerns we had. Great bartenders, had space up front for our studio styled photobooth, wireless mic for announcements, nice clean bathrooms, and worked well with our outside caterer.   We had a slideshow to play from the projector. They use a playstation 3 as the projector interface and we weren't able to make the slideshow work via thumb drive. We brought out HD cable just in case, and Ken was quick to help us hook up the cable directly into the ceiling suspended projector and tape it down so that it was safe for guests. He also tended to all of our guests coats and jackets. Ken and the other co-owner were on it all night, tending to our every need and always available.   DJ (included in the package at a a reasonable hourly rate) was a bit late so there was no music for first few minutes, but he made up for his tardiness throughout that night by playing great music that got guests on the dance floor.   Here is an example of the level of service experienced from Ken (co-owner). The wife of one our executives was hoping to get some hot tea from down the road at Starbucks. As our executive was bundling up to make a \"tea-run\", Ken saw them leaving, insisted that he go and get the tea so that they did not have to go out and come back. It was the little things like that that can make for great customer service! Thank you Ken!",

Went here last Saturday night and had a good time. I do have one suggestion: have bouncers inside. Plenty of drunk people that need to be regulated, when a fight did occur, it looked like the bar tender had to break-up the fight. Bouncer outside was nice though. Funny thing after the fight was the DJ played \"Why Can't We Be Friends\" to lighten the mood.",

When my friends and I arrived, they were actually doing a speed dating thing here, lol.   However, I don't think I would specifically come here. The drinks here were very watery. I got a melon ball here, and asked for Belvedere vodka, because I'm allergic to cheap vodka (just kidding, it just reduces my chances of a shitty hangover). Anyways, my melon ball ended up tasting like flavored cough syrup. It tasted terrible. I only ordered it, because I've been watching Archer, and he drinks that a lot so I wanted to try it, LOL.   As a second drink, I just decided to get my usual, coke and Hennessy since trying new things was not working out for me. My coke and Henny tasted more on the watery side than anything. I barely tasted the coke, so it was more like water and Henny.  Oh, and the music here is just awful. I heard a better mix in my car from Pandora than the DJ here. One minute it would be old school rap, then it would be some random alternative song, then some top 40's hip hop. Completely random music that I had no idea how to dance to. It was honestly killing my buzz.   All in all, Carbon is top notch decor wise. It's clean, and beautiful. If the drinks, and music were better this place would be the spot. As for now, I would not come back here.",

Even when there were less people, I felt like the entire place was like a long narrow rectangle. People are constantly running into each other and spilling drinks.  The bartenders were not very friendly and the drinks were mediocre in my opinion. Overall, I feel like there are better lounges than this.   However, I did like the music since they were playing a mix of both edm and hip hop.",

This venue would be awesome for private parties and networking events too. \u00a0The space is big enough for about 200 people, there is a lot of sitting area, and they have a fancy ladies restroom. \u00a0Keep in mind this is not a CLUB, so the music is not over bearing and you can actually hear and converse with your friends. There's two bars, so its easier to get drinks. \u00a0IF you come with a big party, I highly suggested getting table service. \u00a0  ***** Ambiance  ***** Drink Prices ***** Service  Oh did I mention there is parking too! :)",

Everything is updated from the previous establishment. \u00a0It would be an ideal venue to hold a private party, networking or catered event that can hold 200+ ppl comfortably. \u00a0I would even recommend to the owner or to potential customers(obviously you would have to get permission from the proprietors but these guys are very cool) in bringing in a good pop up in here too.  From my personal experience here, it would definitely help if they had food. \u00a0Judging from the look of this place, it would be a waste not to have some basic bar food. \u00a0I do understand why many bars don't have food because of the cost to operate and food cost. \u00a0From my experience, you want those customers to stay in your place as long as they can. That is the reason why I believe the pop up idea would work. They have a pizza joint next door which is cool because who wouldn't want a slice of pizza after a night of drinking? \u00a0  Once of my go to places in the City.",

This place has two full bars and a very big projector that plays music videos. They also have a decent size dance floor. \u00a0Its a cute lounge that has everything I want.   Its in the North Beach area of SF &amp; let me tell you, its a great area. There's no traffic. I felt like I was in the East Bay, because I'm used to SF being so busy.  Carbon is hard to find, because there's no sign &amp; nothing lit up &amp; its very small on the outside. So, look carefully.   Ken Wong &amp; Jason Gee are the owners and are very nice! I had reserved a booth there prior to my birthday event &amp; when I walked in &amp; introduced myself to Ken, he immediately told me that I could choose any booth I wanted, he bought me a drink for my birthday &amp; he introduced me to his partner Jason. Not to mention, I didn't expect a sign that said, \"Reserved for Jocelyn Cheung\" that he put on the tables near the booths I wanted to settle for the night. I felt very special &amp; definitely is thankful for everything they did for me. \u00a0  Its too bad I was expecting more friends to show up, but I still had a good time with the friends that came &amp; is thankful for that too. I am definitely coming back to Carbon as I am very thankful for everything Ken &amp; Jason did for me.   Those who want to have a great time with friends, want great service, want to dance &amp; also want some really pretty decor, this is the place for you. \u00a0Its a cute lounge with everything.",

We went on a sat night and yes, this place was maybe a little tooo \"undiscovered\" as there were barely any ppl there! But the ppl who were there were mostly asian, and dressed really nice.  This place has a more \"loungy\" feel than anything.  The bathrooms are clean and again, the interior was amazingly done.  Bartenders were nice, but the drinks could have been cheaper...or they could do specials maybe? Might draw more people in :) If you are celebrating your bday, def let the waitress/bartender know! Might get a free shot or two out of it :P",

On a Saturday night, there were enough people to make it seem full but not enough to make it seemed like I was suffocating.   I definitely enjoyed the ambiance of Carbon. There was plenty of space to dance and enough couches around for others to sit around to people watch. I never had to wait long to get a drink from the bar. However, 2 of the guys in our group had been waiting for quite a while at the bar and thought the bartender wasn't paying them any attention. I stood in between them for about a minute &amp; they were finally able to get served.   Two things I absolutely did not like: 1. Women's restroom does not have a soap dispenser. I thought perhaps I had too much to drink &amp; didn't see it, but when I asked another lady in the bathroom if there was one she said there wasn't. She told me she mentioned it to the owner before &amp; their response was that they would get to it eventually. I'm sorry but that is a poor excuse &amp; definitely unhygienic. Luckily, I had hand sanitizer in my clutch.  2. My group of friends stayed all the way until closing at 2 am. We knew closing time had come, but the birthday girl wanted to thank the bartenders &amp; owner for having us. I'm assuming it was a worker or a friend of the owner's, but a lady come up to me &amp; another friend and put her hands on us as if she was pushing us towards the doors to get out as she mentioned the cops tend to come around the area at that time. I felt that was incredibly rude and unnecessary. We were leaving on our own &amp; she didn't have to touch us.   Despite those occurrences, I would go back to this establishment because I thoroughly had a great night with friends.",

    "review_text": "Was debating between 3 and 4 stars, decided to round up.   For our annual triple birthday bash, my friends and I were looking for a place that had enough space to hold all of our friends and would be fun for everyone. None of us had heard of Carbon, but the photos looked great and we liked reading that the place is spacious, with plenty of seating. We emailed Carbon about 5-6 days before our event, and never received a response (we were going to reserve a table and buy a bottle). Luckily, when we got there, we were able to do so that evening.   The interior is modern and chic. Lotttttts of places to sit, and two bars. Contrary to other reviews, there WAS a live DJ the night we went (Saturday). At first the music was heavy on the EDM, but then switched to some really good hip hop. Not sure if one of my party remembers requested it or the DJ just did it, but either way I was grateful!   Getting a bottle was a bit hectic. At first I couldn't find Ken, who seems to be in charge of bottle service. Once we did get a hold of him, it took awhile for us to get everything set up at the table. Still, we had a great night, and these were minor hiccups.   However, I checked my credit card statement the next day and saw the charge for bottle service, but an additional separate charge of $36. I emailed Ken to ask what the charge was, and it's been four days now with no response. It's only $36, but it's a bit unsettling that a simple explanation is taking so long. Regardless, the good definitely outweighs the bad with Carbon, and I would come back again/recommend it if you're thinking of hosting a party there.",

It's a high maintenance, fraternity/sorority breading ground.  \"M U S I C\" (If you can even call it music) They play backdrop noise. If there is an artist to the instrumental, synthetic trance-like.... thing, I've never heard of it. Music that you would use for a mock fashion show like in Zoolander.

I needed to drink ASAP so I can sober up by the time we were done bar hopping. (To make a point that I wasn't a sober party pooper) I rather go to a trashy bar than stick around such a snooty crowd. I stood in line in the bathroom and different groups of girls are just a-holes in there: banging on the stall doors, yelling at the other girls to hurry up. \"There's a long line out here!\" \"We have to peeee!\" \"If you have to take a sh!t, do it at home!!\" \"Mother effer get out of there!!!\" They were seriously threatening girls in there.

The Dim Lights (love dim lights!) give Carbon an intimate and romantic atmosphere which is great if you're on a date - trust me, she'll know you mean business!  The bartender was really nice and our drinks were pretty good. I was happy with my Vesper Martini.   You should definitely try Carbon if you're in the area..",

This bar has all the components of a great bar. \u00a0The decor is classy with a hint of the retro (the lighting) and the seats, walls, and bars definitely had a modern look which was aesthetically pleasing. The drinks were...well..drinks...moderately priced like you would find at any other nightclub. For some reason, the night I went it was a really dead night. \u00a0There were tons of room to walk around and hopefully it would get a little bit more crowded to help the ambiance of the place.  I suppose that my only complaint is that it is damn near impossible to find. \u00a0Everything is blacked out on the outside and there isn't any indication of which building the club is located. \u00a0I found another group of people outside before looking for the place and didn't know where it was either. \u00a0Luckily, i saw a nicely dress man and a girl with a lack of clothing that entered an unmarked door. \u00a0Just FYI.",

My plan was to have a surprise birthday setup for my wife and Ken allowed my friends to come in early to setup. When we arrived Ken introduced himself and offered us a \"birthday shot\" on the house for my wife and I. That got our night started right and the rest of the evening quickly became a blur. We brought a birthday cake that Ken kept in their fridge up until the moment we were ready to surprise my wife with it. I must say that the whole staff were genuinely friendly and Ken and his business partner Jason were the models of hospitality.   The venue itself was chic and decor contemporary. There are two bars and maybe half a dozen booths for bottle service. Ours was the largest, white booth which comfortably seats up to 20 people. The DJ played a nice mashup of Top 40 which had our group grooving all night long. What I liked best is that the clientele wasn't ratchet and that the venue wasn't overly crowded like most clubs. It was the perfect combination between chill lounge, yet poppin' enough for people to get off their asses and on the dance floor. I'm sure I will be a patron of this business for a long time to come!",

Look for the glassy looking double doors and the address.  In the past month, I've been here twice already, and really enjoyed my night both times. As all other yelpers mentioned, the decor is great-- classy, sexy and sleek. The lounge itself is long and narrow and lined up with couches and tables. There is plenty of space to sit and mingle with friends. There are also two large bars, with strong drinks, and no lines. Bartenders are attentive and very nice. The second time I went to Carbon this month was for my birthday. The manager of the club made me feel very welcome and gave us two rounds of champagne on the house. There's also a pizza place next door that stays open late-- perfect for when you have the drunchies!   The only downside is that Carbon has yet to attract large crowds to it, which is surprising because it has all the elements of a great lounge. The plus side to this is there's no waiting to get in and there is no cover! A perfect place if you want to hang out and meet with friends without getting drinks spilled on you, listen to ear defeaning music, and wait hours in line to get in.  I'll definitley be coming back again!",

The bartenders at the front bar are super nice and really take their time to mix the drinks and use fresh ingredients. The drinks here are strong and delicious, which definitely worth the bucks!

    "review_text": "Nobody likes a sloppy drunk.   The last time Mr. Jack Daniels and I met, I ended up on the floor of John Colins in tears and ranting, \"I think it's broken...I think it's broken.\" \u00a0Apparently, Mr. Jack Daniels took my breath away and I slipped on my way out of the bathroom. I sprained by ankle badly. Badly enough that my left foot swelled up and exploded out of my flats like Big Bertha's would...for over 3 months. SeXy.   The situation was embarrassing enough that I vowed to stay away from the partying scene and being a sloppy drunk for a long time. (Guys HATE sloppy drunk girls. Just ask them.)   Enter Carbon.   Formerly the dark and gloomy ghetto Suede, Carbon has been transformed to a stunning venue with two large bars, bright white and dark brown leather couches, bronze gold beams and art deco lighting fixtures. No longer a club but a sheek lounge; Carbon is the perfect low-key place to pop bottles and sip bubbly with your friends. No booty popping or dry humping on the dance floor; this ain't Temple or NV folks. Carbon is a place to drink and socialize the classy way.   On my first visit, I came for the beautiful Cat C.'s birthday and loved it enough to host my friend's birthday party later that month. I worked with Tina to organize bottle service. She was super sweet, professional and very easy to work with. She responded promptly to all my emails and was the perfect hostess that night while rocking those 5 inch stilettos. YOU GO GIRL! As I was setting up cupcakes and strawberries for the birthday girl, Tina brought me a glass of bubbly to take the edge off (I'm very anal) and kept on bringing the birthday girl yummy Basil Gimlets to get her \"happy\". It was her birthday after all so the plan was to get the birthday girl drunk (the classy way of course).   FAIL.  Birthday girl was fine and walked out on her own two feet.   As for me, I drank less than birthday girl and...  Me: \"Who's giving Lap Dance Linda (birthday girl) a lap dance first?\"  Jason (Mr. NSS' BFF): \"I'll be fourth.\"  Me: \"Ok Robert, you're first...\"  Mr. NSS: \"WTF, Robert IS Linda's brother!!!!\"  Me: \"Sooooo?!?!?...Yay, Robert...GOOOO!\"   *Everyone shakes their head*  OTHER NOTES: *No cover. *No dresscode but people dress up. *Very Asian crowd (the only downside) and everyone are in their late 20s - 40s. *Friendly staff and bartenders.  *Good for private events and parties.  *No DJ but there's a mixture of Top 40s and Untz, Untz, Untz background music. *Drinks are $9-$10. *Bottles start at $50 for bubbly and the typical Mr. Goose, Mr. Henny and Mr. Patron were $250/bottle plus 20% gratuity. *8-10 table service areas. *You can bring desserts if celebrating a special occasion and Carbon will provide the plates and utensils.  *2 stalls in the women's restroom.  *Next door to a sleazy XXX store. *wink wink* *Easy street parking.",

Place is where Suede used to be, and I hadn't been to Suede for years. Bright side, they got rid of the stripper pole that was here. It looks nice, and is a great place to people-gawk. However...a nice place in general...that depends on your crowd and what you're looking for.   For the service, bartenders are great. They're pretty fast about the service, though you need to look like you want a drink. IE, LOOK AT THEM. They're not good at approaching you if you have your side toward them...or back. Really, just face them and appear as though you want alcohol. The owner (I assume?) was good at getting his hands dirty if need-be. I mentioned someone broke a shot glass and he was quick to clean it up himself.   Why do I give it a 3 instead of a 4 or higher? Well...not all the bartenders are trained as bartenders. We ordered a berry mojito and a rum/coke (I'm the easy rum/coke person), and the bartender we went to said we have to wait for the other guy for the mojito. I guess not everyone is fully trained? The other thing? Environment.  I read one of the reviews that talked about bitchy/drunk girls. Yeah, you get those. But seriously, just break them. They're all petite Asian girls that can't take their liquor. Its all talk, no action. These females are just itching to get...SOMETHING at night. If you're a guy who wants the best chance to score an Asian girl, Carbon is really your go-to lounge. They get drunk fast, and I swear half of them are wearing some sort of \"fuck me\" apparel. Beyond the heels, I constantly see girls wearing dresses too tight, gaping holes that aren't supposed to be there (weirdly, on tight dresses too), skirts where you REALLY SHOULD NOT SIT DOWN, shirts where the entire back was open (and honey, either don't wear a bra or wear one with no back on it), or one where it was so low-cut that if she had boobs it'd be indecent. I said it was an Asian go-to, right? Yeah...we don't tend to have a lot going on in the front.   Yes, I'll come back, mostly because of good drinks and the ability observe drunk slutty girls pretend they have some class. Once that's overplayed, it's peace-out Carbon.",

My buddies were throwing their bday bash here, and coming from out of town, I invited about 15 of my friends who I haven't seen in a while.  I read the reviews and warned my clique that it might be boring in case they wanted to make back up plans or head to another venue after stopping by. We decided that since there wasn't much closeby and we had a pretty good sized group, we'd just make the most of it. Oh yeah, it seemed like a lot of people had good experiences with bottle service, so I e-mailed the hosts about that and they didn't get back to me until a day or two before with the menu asking if anyone replied....  So we get there; bday boy is already pretty sloshed, so are some of my gfs, and one instantly complains about wanting to leave. So much for trying to make the most of it! The back area had a ton of food laid out, and we pretty much just kicked it by the back bar the entire night. Maria H was right about the music being background noise, which made my gfs not want to give me my bday lapdances haha. :( womp womp.  In the end, a club or more energetic venue probably would've been too much for us since we just did a day trip to Lake Tahoe, but we would definitely not enjoy coming back.
