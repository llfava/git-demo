All I remember is FEEL FREE TO TIP ON THE CHIP. (bartenders love me)  Sports happen. Wii bowling on Tuesday nights. Young happy bartenders raising families. Working class bar vibe. Pictures of longshoremen striking on the walls. As if anyone in this neighborhood made less than $90k a year these days. Still, it's a good place for me to watch people my age act embarassing the instant anything by Journey comes on the juke box.",

My hubby and I wandered in after a day of touristy sight seeing. The restaurant we had planned to go to was closed, so we stopped in for a beer and to figure out where to go. Michael, the bartender, was wonderful!!! He suggested a local restaurant. So, we went to eat and returned for our second happy hour beer. Cool to offer the special until 9 pm, even after happy hour has ended. Michael introduced us to Furnet, which is a lacquer sort of like Jager. So yummy!! Michael was so cool; we wanted to be regulars. Sadly, we had to return to Phoenix. He made us feel at home and comfortable in a \"foreign\"city.",

He rolled his eyes at me and walked away. Refused to serve me again...  Hopefully this guy isn't working there any longer.  On happier notes, the drinks are way cheap, the music is always bumping, and you can usually get a spot at the pool table or a seat at the tall cocktail tables. I'll be back, and be sure to order from Karlee...",

Cheap drinks, two for one happy hour, fabulously nice bartenders, a great jukebox, and the ability to order in pizza. The only problem with the place (and its not really a problem, just an observation) is that the floors get so sticky and grimy at the end of the night that you can see dirt and grime on the bottom of your pants when you leave. But still, awesome place. And now, they sell the cutest t-shirts now, adorably slim-cut for girls.",

I love starting my night and ending my night here, because it's conveniently in the middle of North Beach, and just a few doors down from Golden Boy Pizza.   I was most recently here on St. Patrick's day when my friends and I didn't exactly want to pay a silly cover charge to go into a crowded bar or corral in the streets. We had no problem getting in and no problem getting drinks. I've also been her countless times before on the weekend, before dates at local restaurants or shows at Beach Blanket Babylon or... the Hustler Club.

On the outside the place doesn't look like much, and it's actually a little small but I always seem to have a great time here!  I've seen two bartenders here and the guy is much nicer. Once he gets off around 8ish expect to be carded by the girl bartender. She doesn't mess around, even if you have been drinking...she'll still ask.",

I went here for the first time during the day with my roommate, we were the only ones there. The bartender hands us water balloons and informs us we need defense because we're in the line of fire. We got caught in a water balloon/super soaker fight with the bar across the street. A bloody mary, 2 fernet and sodas, 2 beers (these just being the drinks I consumed) and a few hours later my roommate and I left soaked in water and spilt beer.   I of course had to do my research and went back the next night to check out how the place was at night and I still loved it. Fun bartender, jukebox, photo booth, pool table and a small but not cramped bar. So far, so good.",

I was already in North Beach visiting a friend who had surgery, so I thought \"why the hell not? She's sleeping, might as well have a drink for her\".   AND I WAS RECOGNIZED!!! Thanks to the manwhore who boosted my ego up like a damn puffer fish by recognising me in public as a yelper, we headed over to Columbus Cafe so I could meet-and-greet the people I had been harrassing and stalking on a daily basis online.  Carl was ever so kind as to purchase my drinks for the night--two shots of PATRON SILVER (note: Irish Bank no have-y), and a beer. I was able to ward off Amanders and her Fernetsluttish ways by playing the game \"Pass the Fernet around, don't let it stop at you\". It was almost like Hot Potato, only instead of burning your hands/getting out, you would be passed out on the floor vomiting and wondering why and how anyone could ever let you do that.  $3 Fernet shots = deal = bad idea.  The music was awesome, great for the Jaime who dances when she drinks. The bathroom was all kinds of strange, though--?? But still fun! It had a shower curtain...there was adequate room, and a POOL TABLE!! Now, I was too busy meeting and greeting, so I didn't get to play..but rest assured if and when I come back, there will be heads rolling at my sk1llz.   I still ended up almost puking at the end of the night, though. For that, 4 stars. It means it was a good night.",

One of 'em grabbed my buddy Mike by the throat and started shaking him. Before long, people were just swinging all over the place, and some guy threw his cell phone at my face, which just *barely* missed. I picked it up and did my best Kerry Collins impression and threw that thing waaaaay over to the other side of the street. Perfect diversion, as the tool dropped my buddy Mike.\n  Fast forward 20 minutes, and we managed to sneak back and apologize, which netted us a couple shots of Fernet. On the house. \n  Gotta give some love for the redemption shot.\n  The juke box is always playing something upbeat and fun and occasionally a live band will perform. Not necessarily the best-sounding space to see a show, but it doesn't sound horrible. Funny how everything sounds decent when you've been having 2-for-1 drinks since 4 pm. ;)\n  The drinks are pretty cheap, the crowd is fun and as the night moves on, the whole place turns into a crazy dance-lovers dream. \n  Minus one star for the fact that every time I go here, I end up waiting in some line to use the bathroom. Unlike some patrons, I wasn't ok with just going outside and taking a whiz behind, next to, or worse, ON a parked car. What if that was *your* car?! \n  I'm not gonna be that guy!",

You wouldn't believe how nice and sweet they can be after that.

A pool table, and non-wankers playing pool at the pool table.  4 1/2. A disco ball over the pool table (it's the little things).  5. A jukebox that seemed to have a good selection. \u00a0I heard the Yeah Yeah Yeahs three times one night. \u00a0Of course, it was the same Yeah Yeah Yeahs song each time...  6. They accept credit cards, and don't seem to give you any crap about a minimum on the card (I've only ever charged for two beers or more, though, so I don't know if they'd balk at closing out after just one).  6.

They play some music and have a few big screen tvs. It wasn't bad for watching the game, having a few laughs, enjoying the scenery and having a couple beers. The bad part was the parking. I guess we already knew that would be an issue. The one other bad spot was the bartenders. I don't know if they are always that slow, but there is a point when enough is enough. It seemed like they were just laughing and talking to themselves more than trying to pour drinks. There were two of them, the bigger one who looked pregnant and the really slow one. I would suggest going to the biggger one.  We would go back. Stay away from the smaller bartender. Oh and they didn't say thanks after we dropped off a tip each time. Sort of rude.

They have a good amount of big TV's so if your in the mood to watch a game or an event is a nice place to come. The pool table offers additional entertainment, during the day it's easy to get a game in, but later into the night it becomes a little to packed to come \u00a0just for the pool. My favorite time to come is in the mid/early afternoon, not very crowded.   If you come here and you are hungry, a few store fronts down is Golden Boys pizza, I highly recommend (make sure you bring cash) a slice or three. You can grab pizza to go and bring it into the bar.   Happy hour is super unique! You buy a beer during happy hour and they give you a token (poker chip) good for a free beer (during happy hour). You can take it, you can use it then, or even for the eccentric \u00a0few - you can hoard them to build a tower.. (I have a few)..",

So, if you're like me and frequent this place a lot, you'll eventually amass a stash of chips that you can use when you're short on cash, but still want to go and get a couple of beers after a hard day at work. Just don't forget to show the bartenders some love and be sure to tip on the chip.  While you're there, pick from a wide selection of beer on tap, as well as a full bar (yes, they have cheap Fernet shots, for anyone foolish enough to actually drink the filthy stuff). Be sure to try the house Amber Ale...it's fantastic, and something you're not going to get anywhere else.  There's also a pool table and a couple of TV's that will be showing the big game if it's on, and whether it's the jukebox or the bartender's ipod playing, there's always good music blasting.

The service was okay, and if you use your card, there is a $15 minimum. For some reason, they give you poker chips for every drink purchase. I have no clue why they do that, it's pretty gimmicky. And they also make sure you keep those souvenirs, like they will hunt you down and make sure you have your chips. Why???? Not a bad place to hang out while you wait for the other bars to open  Update: Karlee, I'm guessing one of the bartenders here, messaged and informed me about those poker chips. Apparently you can redeem them for free drinks during happy hour. If anyone wants free drinks, I left about 6 of those tokens near the pool table haha I wish I was aware!",

They are pretty high quality chips so you can either cash them in or save them and use them next time you want to play poker.   I recommend saving them and getting the hell out when happy hour comes to a close, because this carriage turns into a pumpkin after about 8:00.   The evil stepsisters take the place over around this time, looking to take Prince Charming home for a quickie. However Prince Charming is generally downstairs dancing at this point as a prequel to barfing on their not so glassy slipper as the evening progresses.   I assume this has something to do with the $3 Fernet shots they offer up, all of the time. Or maybe it has something to do with the internet jukebox, which, in the earlier hours can be a fairytale, but as the evening progresses and the douche bags show up to the ball, turns into more of a nightmare.   The bartenders are super nice and the happy hour is good, but save this destination for early in the week or early in the evening if you want a happy ending.",

Miss Nicole L. decides to make her way from NB to the Nob for tacos at Nicks. After a late return home from work by me, and a missed bus (silly 12) it came down to one fact... if we went to Nicks Crispy Tacos right now, we would have to wait in line for a while for food.  FUCK THAT I'M STARVING. OK I say, I will walk to NB and we can go do beer and pizza at Golden Boy, and it's not really a downgrade from taco tuesday if it's golden boy.   So shortly thereafter Nicole L and I dominate our beer about as fast as we inhale that glorious slice of pizza. I look to Nicole and say... I'm not ready to go home, wanna hit up a bar?!   While we had the motivation to go out after food, we did not have the motivation to go far. Well Columbus Cafe is right next door, lets stop there. Upon entering it didn't seem promising (I have been here before, but tonight was slow, I mean it was a Tuesday). Shortly after we sat down Nicole and I played the \"I don't know what I want\" game, only because we were looking for the cheapest drink out there.  Dropped out of heaven land two strongly accented Bostonians who tell the bartender, put these girls drinks on here too. Suddenly, as if a fog had been lifted, NIcole and I knew what we want, \"JAMESON AND GINGER!!! JACK AND DIET!!!!\"   The night wasn't complete without a few shots of whiskey and 3 games of Wii bowling... yes that's what I said, WII! Columbus Cafe is BRILLIANT with this idea! If you provide me with free competitive games, I will most definitely be purchasing another round.. or 2.   Columbus Cafe, thanks for giving me a great weekday spot! XO",

If you know us, then you know how fast the three of us are in the bathroom at bars. We were in there for seriously no longer than 5 min.   All of a sudden the door comes flying open. The bleach blond bartender starts screaming at the top of her lungs, in our faces, that only 1 girl is allowed in the bathroom and people want to use the bathroom.

She's really friendly and accommodating, and even took a shot with us after I told her I was new to the neighborhood.  I was also introduced to Fernet. Let's take it back to SAT classes in high school: analogies. Absolut : Grey Goose as _____:Fernet. Answer: Jager.   I can't say I'm a huge fan of Jager, but this was after my 3rd round of drinks, and I was feeling a bit adventurous, so I went for it and it was okay. If I were on my 5th round of drinks, it wouldn't have been a good idea, but I would definitely come here for another one...or two...or three.   One of my new favorite spots with chill bartenders.

My dad even told me he used to come here all the time in the '70s and '80s for happy hour. But this time was special, since I was now a resident, and coming from Irvine (the land with no soul) it was the most rewarding feeling to see people out laughing, drinking, eating pizza, loitering on the street, and know this was home.   Great happy hour spot, 2-for-1 beers on tap until 8pm. They let you cash-in your saved chips for drinks until 9pm, or you can take your chips with you and save them for another happy hour. (Chips are customized Columbus Cafe, so I wouldn't recommend trying to use generic poker chips for a free drink.)   Crowd is mixed, pretty chill, not your standard tourist NB or barely legal Saturday night Kel's bar binge drinking, frat boy crowd.   Besides happy hour, I prefer coming here on a lazy Sunday to watch a game. But, I admit, there are those times that I find myself lingering here after happy hour on a Friday night and singing to Bon Jovi on the jukebox.

On Saturday, April 18th I stumbled into Columbus Cafe with some friends after a birthday dinner. At midnight I turned the big 2-4. That's when the bartender bought me a shot. Then at 2am as the bar was closing up I realized they didn't get to the song that I played on the jukebox so, being the annoying birthday girl that I was, I asked if they would skip ahead and let us stay to hear it. They agreed and I was grateful. This place was such a great find. In my drunken stupor I forgot to close my tab and collect my debit card so when I realized this, the morning of my actual birthday, we walked on down to Columbus Cafe, kept my tab open from the night before and had a beer. This turned into two, then three, then a shot with the bartender, Christian, who gave us one of the shots for free. After a game of pool, many attempts to beat the high score on exotic photo hunt and a few delicious drinks, we decided to head out on the town and do some sightseeing before heading home. I can thank Columbus Cafe for an amazing birthday. I liked it so much that I got a business card so I can have a private party in their room downstairs on my birthday next year!

The atmosphere in the Columbus Cafe was pretty good, and everyone seemed to be having a good time. The drink prices are reasonable for the area. The only issue with the establishment was the bar staff this past Friday night/Saturday morning.  When I went up to the bar I was promptly attended to by a 20-something barman, and asked what I would like. Assuming the bar was fully stocked I asked for a gin and tonic. I saw him make the drink and noticed that he put a copious amount of gin (always a good thing) and he filled the rest of the glass with what I presumed was tonic. Wrong. He filled it up with sprite, and I could clearly taste it.   I called him back to let him know that I didn't order a gin and sprite, that I wanted one with tonic, instead of saying that the bar did not have any tonic, he snapped back \"oh, you want tonic? Well here you go\" and he pulled the soda hose out and overflowed my drink with whatever soda button he pressed.  For the rest of the night he chose to ignore me, and didn't attend to me until the lady at the bar (who seemed busy on the other side) insisted he stopped cleaning glasses, and go and help me.  Although I did enjoy the atmosphere, I don't plan on going back to this bar /cafe anytime soon.  Update:  Still don't like this place. Service is still bad.",

Not the cute grandma type). The old lady tried to take a swing at Kelley with her bag but she was most likely too drunk to follow through. Kelley starts spraying the lady in the face like one of those carnival games where you spray in the mouth of the clown.

When it was our turn, we went in.  Now I get VERY annoyed when dumb bitches take forever in the bathroom. Like seriously, I think most of them are doing blow in the stalls, cuz what could be taking so long? But not my friends and I...we get in, we get out in under 3 minutes for 3 of us to do our business.   After spending our precious 3 minutes in the bathroom this crazy bitch comes barking at us to get out of the bathroom. She kept SCREAMING in our face to get out. We are paying customers, and that is no way to treat people. It's freakin' St. Patrick's Day! Lighten up, have some holiday spirit and calmmmm yourself!

After the parade, we wandered in here. the first bartender we encountered was pleasant and gave my pal some free drink tokens after we were there for a while.   Then SHE came in. She was a short haired thin chick. I was nice and she had an attitude from the beginning. I played over $10 worth of songs on the jukebox and she preceded to fast forward through all of my songs (there were a lot) while making side comments to trolls at the bar that she was flirting with. So impressive. When I finally said something she said I could ask for my money back and continued to skip through my songs. You could have that $10, girl. You need it way more than I do. YOU'RE WELCOME.  My group was literally there for 5+ hours buying tons of drinks, making friends, and being merry. I don't like to base my reviews on one bad apple, but come on, you're a bar, so bartenders are pretty important. 100s of dollars later with stink face fast forwarding through all of my songs my buzz was totally killed. Needless to say, I will not be returning. YOU'RE WELCOME.",

The service has been poor, and the attitude is part of the atmosphere.   I've gone to CC for almost 6 years, now, i can say that after a few bad experiences with the day manager, and some of the \"new staff\", i can say that the once great treasure has become fools gold.

Really, it's a love-it or hate-it type of shot, and actually meant to be sipped after a big dinner so that one can calm their stomach after gorging themselves with (insert food here).  Columbus Cafe doesn't have food (although Golden Boy Pizza is a few doors down and you can bring it inside Columbus Cafe if you like), and they believe the best way to drink Fernet is in the form of a shot &amp; in large quantities--that's why it costs a mere $3.  I've been here twice now &amp; both times things started to get sorta fuzzy as the night progressed. I may/may not have eaten too much pizza, and I may/may not have flown home on a magical Fernet unicorn...  The bartenders here are great, provided you don't act like the typical weekend clientele that visits North Beach.  Columbus Cafe, Do you have my new beanie? I may have left it there, or perhaps the magical Fernet unicorn needed it to keep its unihorn warm &amp; dry instead.",

    "review_text": "Heyyy!! What's not to love??  I got to know Columbus Cafe when I was working in the area. Trust me, people who work with the 18 and under after school are probably the most alcoholic WHILE BROKE in the world.  Why should you come here? TWO FOR ONE BEER. That's right, TWO FOR ONE. You buy one, they give you a chip. Chip is good until 9! Now, make note. The chips are given until 8PM, but are good until 9PM. Any night. Say you drank a few too many but have a chip left over. What to do?? Well...clearly, come back another day for another drink!  Another plus: You can bring in food. Golden Boy less than half a block away?? Winning. You can venture out every 10 minutes to check if the clam garlic pizza is free while sipping 2-for-1 beers!   I've been here on those strange nights where there's dancing downstairs. Not bad...not what I expected, but its all good.   Only two awkward moments here, which I clearly must share:  1) For a while (about a year ago) one of the bartenders was heavily pregnant. Wow...good thing no mixed drinks, otherwise fetal alcohol!  2) A random guy leaning over to my friend and I ordering Hoegaarden and correcting our pronunciation. \"I don't mean to sound pretentious, but its pronounced 'who-garden' \" WHO the fuck are you and WHY do I care? I've tried ordering a \"who-garden\" and no one knows wtf it is. Fail guy, fail.  ***I've been corrected. It was 2.5 years ago the bartender was pregnant. And for the record, there's nothing wrong with it. It was just a surprising thing to view at a bar (for me).",

One pool table in the back malfunctions and kicking it does no good. \u00a0Asking the bartender to fix it works much better.  Ask for a shot of Fernet's - most of you will regret it.",

I love the beers they have on tap, the drink specials, the dankness of the environment (hey, what can I say, I love a good dive), and the fact that they give you chips to carry around making you want to come back and get a 2 for 1 beer during the week.  It's easy to like the bartendresses too. They are hot and give good customer service. Even to the douches who come in thinking it's a douchey bar.  I promise my next review will be sans douche.",
