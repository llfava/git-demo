My music-guru buddy recommended BBR for a Saturday night birthday escapade, and the Funk Revival Show was absolutely intoxicating. You know that feeling when you walk into a room and this rush of excitement washes over you? It happens at the Boom Boom Room. The place is electric and you can't help catching a few volts.   They've got some tables along one side, a bar along the other, and the rest is open for movin' and groovin', which is highly recommended considering how ridiculously funky the bands are. It gets packed, which is great on the dancefloor, not so great in the ladies restroom. But, all in all, totally doable.  $15 cover is pretty standard here, so plan to make a night of it and you'll surely get your money's worth. For a dreary, weary soul...revival is priceless.",

My ticket said show starts at 9:30pm. I get it, the opening band may not start until closer to 10 or so, but they were on waaaaaay too long. They were so good I forgot the name of the band! Oh wait that's a lie, for the 2+ hours they played all their songs sounded like one looooong song. When I asked the sound guy at midnight when the headliner was supposed to be on, he said 5 minutes ago? No worries. I let that go, I wasn't here to see the opener, right? So they come off the stage around midnight. It takes them more than an hour to get Alphabet Soup on stage. At 1am, with no band playing, I finally asked the door guy for my money back and he explains that they advertised an opening band and it was out of his hands. OK, well so is this review, it's totally out of my hands! Alphabet soup sounded great for the 2 songs I was able to stay for. None the less was really let down by the lack of professionalism and customer service. I don't blame the door guy for the late band. Although with an unsatisfied customer I think you would do more to listen and hear that I wasn't happy. At least buy me a beer and shut me up until the band starts?  One more note, I wear earplugs to all shows and I can say that your sound guy needs to know when he's got the levels too high. This show was painfully loud and the place wasn't that busy so even with earplugs I was uncomfortable with the sound. I can say this must have been an off night for you guys as I've seen shows there with no issues which is why you got 2 stars. I would avoid a show there at this point due to the poor customer service I received.",

As you enter into the club, a couple of bouncers welcome you and stamp your wrist upon receiving the $15 cover charge for the evening. \u00a0(Amazingly, the bouncers are people-friendly, unlike the wanna-be cool and exclusive bouncers of Soma, NorthBeach and other wanna-be pretentious, but definitely not world-class cosmopolitan hoods.)  The place is dimly lit while the ambiance is definitely retro and quite intimate. \u00a0A predominant existence of the 70s lounge chair in faux leatherette finish surrounds the place, while the main door also appears with the same look and finish. \u00a0At the end of the lounge a small stage appears where musicians go wild in playing their tunes, serenading the intoxicated crowd who move in trance-like fashion to the beat of each note.  Last Friday night the NOLA-based band's rendition of various SKA tunes drove the elated crowd wild. \u00a0It was interesting for me to see how modern urbanites have turned into a robotic group of unconscious homo sapiens, as they swayed in hypnotic motion to the music. \u00a0That night, it struck me that rhythmic beat and music is such an integral part of human existence, almost as vital as the need to breathe, to eat, and to procreate.  I enjoyed the company, as I was surrounded by my beloved boxing chums. \u00a0Although, I was quite confused initially, as I expected a jazzy and blues type of venue. \u00a0The SKA with a metallic twist genre, was quite a surprise, but nevertheless, it was a well-spent evening with kindred friends.",

    "review_text": "I think there is a lot of truth to what other people are saying about the Boom Boom Room - while I really, really like this venue, when I read what others had to say it reminded me of a few of the reasons why I don't go here often or have been dissatisfied in the past.  It definitely feels very historic, and though I've been here both at night and in the late afternoon, it's always kind of dark and divey and has the same vibe on the inside. The music is really authentic and I like the ambiance - nobody bugs you, the lighting is good and the bartenders and door people are cool. And even though it's a dive, I don't remember it having that bad \"cheesy\" smell on the inside that you sometimes find in other places.  BUT...the bathroom is absolutely disgusting. I went around 7PM one Sunday night before anyone was really there, and the entire bathroom reeked like stale vomit, even though it didn't look like many (any) people had been through there. I also felt like someone was going to come busting in on me the whole time, as I was hovering, holding my breath, and holding the door. Sucked, because you know what happens the more beer you drink. The more you have to visit the ladies' room! So I ended up only having one drink and leaving.   Thankfully, I hadn't had to pay the $15 cover because on the way in I'd told the door guy that I'd just be in and out, or I would've felt obliged to stay. I've also caught a few drinks here before going to shows at the Fillmore, and have always enjoyed myself. It's a nice way to start the evening, as long as you don't get stuck with the cover.  I'd like it if the bathrooms got revamped and would recommend checking beforehand to see what's going on at the Boom Boom Room before just dropping in, if it's in the evening. That seems like a hefty price to pay just to enter a club, unless you're planning on staying there for the evening.",

I don't know what you are doing at the BBR these days but if last night is an indication of who you allow to represent your business .. we will NOT be back. The two 'boys' 'young men' that work your door are rude, mean and racist. Yes, I said racist. My husband is a black man and your doormen would not allow him back in because they said 'your husband doesn't have a stamp'. It was clearly there and we had just come through that door less than an hour before .. they remembered us and stamping us. The 'bald' shorty rude person that wasn't at the door but showed up with his 'Napoleon' syndrome and grabbed my arm when I just said 'my husband' has a stamp .. saw it! So, he, rudely apologized for their racism but at the same time grabbed my arm with strength to tell me 'I said he's good'. I did not raise my voice at all. And I say, racism, because I watched them ALL night long let 'fake wanna be Tupac wearin' kids go in all night long without them checking their stamps at all. And some of them were much darker than my husband and you could see 'their' stamps?. I know you could care less if we come back cause we're just a couple of dollars to you. But if you do care about your reputation .. then you should know .. we won't be back and I promise to make sure none of my friends go there again. Jack's was a good neighborhood live music bar ..but you've now become trash and classless. I bet John Lee Hooker would not like what you've become. Good luck to you. Thankfully there are other live venue choices in our City .. we don't have to go back to yours. (Oh and the system made me give you at least 1 star..I would give you none)",

Now, outside of it being a mediocre jazz club, the bar is good. \u00a0The bartenders are excellent, there's a lot of space to walk around in, and the clientele is friendly. \u00a0My suggestion, go with a group of friends. \u00a0While it's definitely easy to meet people there, I've always had a lot more fun when I've gone with a group of people I know.",

I visited this place for the first time last Saturday as we were traveling up and down Fillmore street for the jazz festival (which was so amazing this year!). We had been up and down the street a couple times already at this point and we were looking for a place to kinda rest while still soaking up some good music...that and I figured this would be a perfectly valid reason to visit the venue since I've always wanted to visit it.  Saturday, BBR was free and hosting a live band (forgot the name) and some great drink specials, to which the bouncer encouraged you to get them \"to-go\". I got into some $5 sangria and sweet tea vodka concoctions. Both drinks would have been great, had they not been watered down with club soda. Considering this was part of a pretty big event, I'm sure they were just taking precaution to not get everyone wasted, for that I respect them.  The venue has a very historic and iconic feel to it. It's very old-school, pretty spacious. The bar staff was kinda...off. They were either tired, stressed or a high mix of the two.  I'm definitely interested in checking out this place on a weekend night to see how a \"normal\" weekend looks here.",

From reading the other yelp reviews of this place, I can see that it generally receives positive responses, so again, lemme reiterate that I was only here once and for maybe 30 minutes, tops. Why was I even at, um, the Boom Boom Room? Simply because Julie had our tickets for a show at the Fillmore and, in pure Julie-style, sent a last minute text asserting her 1/2 hour delay. Of course that night was, like, 40 degrees and windy as fuck, so Amanda and I were left with no other recourse besides spending some time in the Boom Boom Room. With that said, we brought some serious fortune with us and only caught the end of that evening's band's sound check, and holy christ, it appeared as though they all met at the cooler in the IT department of whatever horrible job y'all work and decided to form a really fresh jazz-rock band. Fronted by NERDS!!!!! Yeah, as though jazz-rock bands are fronted by anyone else. Anyway, said band also brought their fellow nerdy IT cohorts and a few chachbags to boot (no pun intended), so Amanda and I were definitely given numerous \"hook up\" opportunities.   However, the Boom Boom Room did manage to keep us warm and serve us cans of PBR. \u00a0Plus, when Enrico and Julie FINALLY showed up, Enrico bought us shots of Jameson, making the IT nerds begin to look pret-ty fetching.",

I knew they played here every once in a while and finally decided to take a stab at seeing them.   The place is way smaller than I imagined. It is essentially a bar that happens to have a stage at the end. The crowd is crazy weird. Marina types, Burning Man types, hipsters, preppies, and old folks. It's all over the map. When the band came on it was standing room only and it was getting to be a pain to actually try and see the band. Luckily one of the booths opened up and when we sat at the angle we did, we could kind of see them. They played well on till 2.45am and it was kind of cool to see them in such a small space. Just a bit claustro if you know what I mean. Anways, the staff seem to work hard and if you can get past the sardine like packed crazy crowd it's not a bad place to see a band. 3.5 stars.",

The Boom Boom Room's stiff cover ($15) was not a good start.  But once inside, everything got a lot better. The music, both acts were some sort of latin-infused, semi-reggae, indie rock ensembles. One of the bands had an unbelievably cute girl playing saxophone. In any case, the bartenders smiled and didnt have the typical \"I'm way too stressed out for this job\" frown on their faces. The drinks were reasonably prices and they had a decent selection of solid beers. The people, though a bit older (something like 26-40 yrs old), were actually pretty awesome. It's hard to run across a place with such a high cover where the people are actually worth a crap and this seems (at first visit) to be on those places.  So, Boom Boom Room, I will be back.

I prefer to think of it as an intimate music venue with a bar that has really cheap tickets for their shows.  They really have an uncanny way of almost always booking great talent, some local, some national, and quite often, the opening band is even better than the headliner.  There aren't many music clubs in the city where I'll just go drop money on some band I've never heard of and know that it will be money well-spent.  Sure, the shows always start late, but they go until 2 or 3 in the morning. Solid beer selection, too.  Also, being across the street from the Fillmore, you never know just who might drop by after playing a show at the Fillmore.   Not the greatest area to walk around, but I don't think that should have any effect on my review.  And don't go in the booth at the front of the stage.  update: everything in my previous review still stands, but wanted to point out that this might be the only regular afterhours live music place in SF. when most places shutdown at 2, there's still quite a lot of clubs you can go to (ruby skye, endup, 1015, mighty, public works, dna, etc.), but this is the only live music venue",

I loved them not just because they are all of 21 years old and talented and cute.....but because they are real down to earth people and not pretencious rock stars.   We invited them to come over for Jambalaya and drinks and music and they announced to the entire crowd at the end of the 2nd set that the official after party was at 3014 Steiner (my friends apartment)! \u00a0WHAT!?!?!  Thats right !! Random people, boom boom door men etc.. all showed up and we had a blast with the Trombone Shorties, singing, drinking wine and singing...till the weee hours of the morning!   It was a surreal nite! Making friends with a band members that toured with Lenny Gravitz for two years.  Now, we have special invitations to Jazz Fest!   Boom Boom Room - made a BIG BANG in my musical heart!   You guys ROCK!",

Drinks are standard with standard prices, the bouncer and bartenders are nice.  I went a couple years back with a guy I was crushing on, and sadly made a fool of myself by making out on the dance floor. I mean, who cares, right? It's only now, seeing other youngsters do the same thing that makes me look back on those days and shake my head in disbelief that I could be so silly.   I went to a show for my friend's band Solwave on Thursday and it was super fun. Hibbity Dibbity also played and they were cool too. I accidentally left my debit card there and my friends told me to just forget about it, as I guess some places charge a fee when you leave your card (?? is that a thing?) but when I went to pick it up on Saturday the bartender was super nice and sifted through the mass amount of other forgotten cards, happily handed it to me, and informed it was closed out, with a wink and a smile.

We noticed that the same doorman that let us in for free, was now charging people a $7 cover to go in.   Me and my friend didn't think anything of it as we figured we were gonna get back in because we were in the bar before.   NOPE totally wrong!   This \"fool\" was trying to charge us the $7 cover and we were like ummmmmm hello we were already inside. This guy was being a total douche (excuse my language). He said oh well anyone that's not coming in had to pay $7 and get a stamp! We were like DUDE WE WERE ALREADY IN there!   Homeboy never gave us any warning told us that there was event going on NOTHING!   We started to argue w/ him telling him that what he was doing was not right. He didn't care! He said your not getting in w/o paying $7. He was yelling at us too!!!   He said the $7 cover was for the band to get paid which we understood and maybe would've mentioned before or give us some sorta heads up that that would be fine! But nope!   Music and drinks are great, but the bouncers are d**ks!",

When it was our turn to pay and enter, the doorman (wearing nerd glasses) told me it was going to cost each person $15 to enter the empty establishment. At this point, I was not interested in changing plans for the night, so I asked the doorman if my fianc\u00e9 could get in free for her birthday, since none of us knew about the up-charge. He blew cigarette smoke in my face, as he told me, \"well then someone should pay for her.\" I wanted so badly to verbally slam the doorman, but I didn't want to cause a scene, or organize everyone towards a new place (since we were there to see a funk orchestra and already had other friends inside). When it came time to pay, I handed the doorman $80 (for 6 people) and my buddy handed in a $10 to bring our total to the full amount. The doorman had a very hard time doing mental math, and got frustrated WITH US for paying together. He handed all the money back to me in frustration, and made each person pay him one at a time. What an idiot. I definitely won't be returning, due to the slow and inept service.  Overall, the only redeeming part of the night was the funk orchestra. Next time, I will see a show at any other venue in SF. There was nothing that really stands out about the boom boom room beyond what \"Neck of the Woods,\" \"Maggie McGarry's\" or any other bar with a stage already offers in SF.",

While drinks aren't any cheaper than your standard bar you never have to push through the crowds or wait very long to order a drink at the bar.   I was reminded of how fond I am of the BBR over the weekend. The night started off pretty standard: Happy hour after work for about 2 hours, followed by dinner with the standard consumption of drink 2 Goose martini's. After that we headed to see 'The Watchmen' at the Kabuki Theater where I continued my drink fest with another delicious Grey Goose concoction (or two).........Jump to half way through the movie where I return from the bathroom and ask myself \u00a0\"What the hell movie am I watching?\" At which point I decide to leave since I realize I'm less than half way through this 3 hour bore fest. I meet my man who's also coming back from the bathroom and head outside where we're approached by a homeless man who tries to get $5 out of us for a place to stay for the night. We decide instead to invite this seemingly normal man to the BBR with us where we manage to get him pretty toasted on 2 beers. I'm pretty sure he had quite a memorable night as he couldn't seem to remember the last time he had actually let loose and danced with a smile on his face for an entire evening. Success!  It was $15/pp to get in which I think varies based on who's playing that night. I won't say this is any better or worse than the Elbo Room in The Mission...so it just depends on what neighborhood you're in or if you actually look up ahead of time who's playing and prefer a certain type of music.",

Seating is limited along the left side of the long narrow room. \u00a0Get there by 9 or 9:30pm if you want a seat. \u00a0The music usually starts with an opener at 10pm and the headliner usually goes on around 11 or 11:30. \u00a0They often have shows where the music goes past 2am. \u00a0Most nights you'll feel like standing up and moving your body though if you have any soul at all in you. \u00a0To the left of the stage is a good spot to catch the action, right next to the rotating B3 leslie organ speaker!  Bartenders are cool, but it can get busy and it might take some time to get a drink at times. \u00a0  Parking tip, park down Geary near the park a few blocks away.",

Circumstances had me choosing the later. The Boom Boom Room is a perfect spot for a pre/post Fillmore drink... or even a drink in general . I was looking forward to some Jazz but the night I went but it ended up being a Jazzy jam band. ALL bad.

In fact a lot of great NOLA artists - not hue names, but people who's on the circuit - plays at the BBR, which is a major reason why I go there  I, unfortunately, have never been there for happy hour.

With the slew of summer festivals popping up in the Oregon and Bay area - the once standard San Francisco dub-step parties - that would fill up my weekend and force me to make frantic Party Rat purchases at Great Stuff - have been on hiatus for awhile.Leaving my waistline aching for some good hip-roll music, and my spirit deflated - these past couple of weeks.  So when I heard that there was gonna be some dirty bass hitting beats at the Boom Boom room this Sunday - I decided to just go for it. I grabbed a late night cab over and had my five bucks ready.   The bouncers were chatty and ushered me right in. Into a familiar world of lovely smells, familiar faces, and oh so lovely deep sexy bass.  Moving in that dark - red-lit hazy room \u00a0- things just seemed brighter. Better.  The bartender - grabbed me a water right away and the quirky intimate-spaced Boom Boom - exploded with good music, as people pulled their hoodies tightly around themselves, pursed their lips and just got down.  No line for the bathroom, plenty of seating room, and best of all - plenty of room to dance. My worn boots - sliding around on the wooden floor.  I bolted early, but heading into the foggy chill of the now Monday morning - I didn't mind the wind hitting my flimsy t-shirt. It just felt good to dance again.  Trust.",

Like the stage had red curtains that'll draw up old school way, they had spinning lights from the disco ball, they had candles on the table in a red candle cup so there's red glows around the room, and a classic checkered floor. :)  CROWD: We went on a random weekday, so not super crowded, but just enough.

The two douche bag guys before them were really lame and obnoxious. I couldn't wait for them to get off stage. I would of left and came back after their set, but I had good seats and didn't want to risk losing being so close in proximity to Tortured Soul.   The venue is a little small to be having a band with such a huge fan base. The bathroom is in the back and there's enough floor place for people to dance with their drinks. There is seating along the opposite side of the bar. Those seemed to get full pretty quick. There's a two stall bathroom for both men and women and a back door exit for when the place gets full.   There are ins and outs. At least tonight there was.   Despite the small venue and crowded scene, the staff here were amazing. The door man was so nice and the others were very attentive and on top of cleaning around the bar. So I'd be careful with leaving your drink around unattended. \u00a0The people that happened to come tonight were so great, friendly, and whatever is opposite of obnoxious. I had a really good time. At the same time we were all there for one purpose: Tortured Soul and you for to be a great loving, friendly person to listen to them.   Did I mention that Tortured Soul was playing?  The prices for the drinks were reasonable enough for my friends and I to go a couple rounds as well as buy the Tortured Soul some Tequila shots as well.  So my overall experience from tonight was 4 stars. One less for the small venue and the crappy duo DJ's who share one laptop. Oh goodness those guys were horrible. Actually if you see them, remember two young guys wearing sun glasses, walk right out. Trust me. Majority of my star rating is based on staff, Tortured Soul, and \u00a0the crowd that came tonight.",

A nice intimate club and I've always been able to get right up to the stage to see the action. Kind of like the laid-back atmosphere at Edinburgh Castle, but with the occasional transvestite in attendance. In any case, a far cry from the hipster clubs in the Mission and Tenderloin.

So, when I was told I WAS going out last night with a couple of friends, I was a little shocked that this was the place we ended up. I'm open to try anything once though and glad I decided to go for it. This is a little gem of a place and deserves a try if you're into live music, especially jazz and blues. The crowd was well mixed and I felt really relaxed here from the moment I went inside. No one judging you from head to toe, a really nice bartender (originally from New York), comfortable low lighting and a band that started to play about 10 minutes after we arrived. I had already been drinking and didn't try their drinks so I have no comment on the quality/strength of the drinks. I do have to say that I'm disappointed that they only take cash which, at the end of a night, can be a real drag if you're low on cash. Also, the band playing last night was not all that tight and at times I felt embarrassed for the lead guitar player. Being a musician myself and noticing the poor timing in their playing, I don't think I'd be into seeing this group again.  I look forward to coming here again and hearing some great music and most definitely getting my drink on! Cool spot!",

It's small, it's in the corner of a busy intersection, with very little to no parking. It's right in the middle of two neighborhoods that are exact polar opposites of each other. But it's been bringing the same kind of vibe for as long as I can remember and it just doesn't play out.   The live music variety here is as flavorful as the best three course meal you have ever had. It's such a mix of jazz type performers, to hip hop artists known and on the come up. They can host orchestra ensembles or just a lone saxophonist. That's just the kind of blend they bring. The drinks are what you would expect. They have a few on tap and make just about any cocktail you can think of. They are decent in value. In fact it's damn near a steal nowadays.   What I really like about this place is that everyone is welcome. They know no colors. It's kind of small. It can get grimy and of course body funk is body funk but that's what this is about. This is where you hang with your boys or girls or both and just chill.   This is where you bring that first date and let her know that sometimes this is all you want. That sometimes you want to be in an old school non-hipster/emo kind of place where people just come in jeans and a shirt and don't mind that 48 hour no shower stench. Where the drinks don't have to be $20 a shot and you can just be grimy with the rest. This is the place where you will run into your boys from way back but you may also see their mom or dad or that crazy uncle. Yeah, this is the place and if she is going to be with you she needs to know it. And you know what? If she is going to be a keeper she is going to love it.

Boom Boom Room is a incredibly small spot but offers some of the most intimate performances you can imagine because of it. There is a constant and eclectic rotating list of live bands each weekend that range from rock to rap to edm to everything in between. You never know what you are going to get and you really have to be in the know to actually have heard of most of the people playing but that's a good thing.   What happens because of this is that you only get the diehard fans or people who actually appreciate the music and they are out to have a good time. A live performance can be made or unfortunately broken by the people around you and its hard to run into that here. The dark lighting and red lights bring you back to the dive bars from the 80's movies and sometimes the bouncers are in fedoras so even better.   The staff was really friendly when i was there, a lot of locals and BBR enthusiasts show up so it can feel like a family gathering at times. Had a drink on a random afternoon waiting for a friend and it was a pleasant experience and even the Friday and Saturday nights aren't too crazy.   A great alternative to the big names and headliners at the Fillmore down the street but not as mellow as the performances over at Yoshis.

    "review_text": "So I was in Japantown coming out of a Karaoke room because my roommate and his brother, both who are from out of town, were coming down to meet up with me on a Saturday night.   Me, being the native in San Francisco, had to play guide and think of a place to go.... typically, I would have just went back to the Karaoke room, but considering these are two white guys who are both over 6 feet tall -- I figured a tiny Karaoke room that was already packed with people wouldnt' have been the best idea. So I looked around and there was the Boom Boom Room and thought, why not...   And so, I walk over to the doorman, all pimped out with his zoot suit and brim hat, and find out that there's a $15 cover. I'm already kicking myself especially considering I have no idea what I am paying for. Okay, so I eat the cover and apologize to my guests, telling them I had no idea... Feeling guilty as hell, I buy a couple of rounds of drinks. Fortunately beers were cheap.   There was a jive band playing that night... they were actually very good. I appreciated the decor and dim ambiance. I also enjoyed that the people congregating by the stage weren't neccessarily dancing, but just rocking out to the music. It almost was like a small concert.   They also have candle lit tables with couches and chairs lined up on the side of the walls. Made me think this would make for a great place to take a date. On a side note, I also saw a guy rolling a blunt to the side on a table not having the least bit of concern, which illustrates the comfortable nature of the venue.   Overall, I'm grateful that I stumbled upon the Boom Boom Room... if any venue is representative of San Francisco, this is definately the place. Diverse crowds, great live music, a certain hipness but far from being pretentious, and of course, the smell of pot lingering in the air.",

My girlfriend and I, along with my brother and cousin went to this place after outside lands this past weekend. It was saturday and they had a funk band playing seemed pretty cool. So we walk up to the front the bouncers who think theyre \"cool\" say $20. Fine $20 to hear live music sounds a bit high. Living in Los Angeles allows you to gauge nightlife vs other cities and this was no $20 worth show katdelic seriously, but fine, hey were on vacation. So we get in barely any people inside and its a small venue. The bar is basically at the entrance and though the entire bar has people along it no line was forming. Yet it took almost 30 min for my girlfriend to get acknowledged. Also overlooked for other people. When she finally got to ask the bar tender for a beer, boom boom room ale we heard we needed to drink, the bar tender said something that to me was desperate and thirsty and greedy. She said they were no longer selling beer. Only double shots of hard alcohol. What??? LMFAO!! Two people just before her walked away with beers. At this point we figured to let my cousin ask. Hes local he looks the part, nope! Same thing yet other people were getting beer. Now what idiot wants to drink double shots of anything and listen to funk? Just trying to enjoy some live music with a beer. One of two things could have happened here both with negative consequence to your business. First scenario. The bi**h bartender was being rude and did not like my girlfriend saw who we were with and told both her and my cousin double shots only. Two, they really were only serving double shots (far fetched because other people were purchasing beer). Either way we left. Directly after my cousin getting the same answer. The music was great but when a business acts thirsty and greedy its not really the establishment im trying to be in or associate myself with. I repeat If i could give zero stars i would. I DEFINITELY WILL NEVER RETURN NOR WILL I RECOMMEND THIS THIRSTY GREEDY ESTABLISHMENT TO ANYONE!   If only we could have ordered beers we probably would have ended up spending $100 each instead we end up spending $20 each at the door and going to another bar to spend more money, and realize how terrible an establishment it was.

At most a two-count on the drinks (I was a bartender for many years. When we asked them to re do it or top it off they said, it tastes like that because it is so big. kind of insulting).  That's like getting a $10 drink at Cat Club on a Thursday night before 10 PM.  just wrong.  To be fair, one bartender was nice enough to give my better half a top for both our drinks (but was immediately chastised by the other bartender).  Disappointing after the amount of money we've spend here over the years.  Not sure if I'll return after all these years. \u00a0we'll see.",

Great acts bring the A game to this place, and some serious music fans come to groove and boogie hard. Musicians know that this gig is one where ya have to do it - and they usually do.  The staff there are always really nice to us when we're there.  It gets seriously hot on the dance floor - but that adds to the fun.  Its a great no-attitude place. Highly recommended",

I met up with a friend for a drink before heading over to see Mutemath at the Fillmore. And I'll be going back to spend an evening here!  The red vinyl, the swinging jazz, the stage and the dancefloor! I'm intrigued. And the drinks were cheap!",

    "review_text": "I've never actually been here to see a show before, so I can't comment on the nightclub environment here. \u00a0Instead, I come here a couple of times a month during the happy hours to grab a few quick drinks and then be on my way.  It's kind of a hidden gem in that regard. \u00a0  There's never more than a handful of people there, and the drinks are suitably cheap. \u00a0Although it seems like the jukebox is always on the fritz, the bartenders usually have good enough taste in music that one of their ipods plugged into the PA is an adequate substitute. \u00a0  The atmosphere is very laid back and friendly, and it's easy to strike up a conversation with whomever is sitting next to you at the bar. \u00a0Since it seems to draw a musically-oriented crowd, music is a pretty good bet as a starter topic.  There are no tvs inside, so you can't watch the game or whatever, but that just puts the focus back on the people around you. \u00a0  The Boom Boom Room is a brilliant, quiet alternative to the noisier, more polished \"watering hole\" establishments elsewhere in the neighborhood, especially during that crucial 5pm to 8pm window of opportunity.",
