I was hoping for more!  The bad: - our server had a weird personality and attitude; because we were a party of 6, gratuity was automatically included, so maybe that is why... - I didn't think the Crispy Fish Pakora was anything special. -the Lamb Pepper Fry was not very appetizing. I didn't like the seasoning on the rice either.  - Surprised to hear that the Peony was SF's drink of the year at one point... but I may be biased because I just don't like spices/chili in my drinks.",

I guess the main draw of this restaurant is that it's convenient (it's right next to Kabuki).",

    "review_text": "Dosa knows how to run a restaurant. Spectacular service and delicious food.   My boyfriend and I had a reservation (recommended, it was pretty busy for a Tuesday night) and we were seated immediately. The host gave us a run through of how their menu works and gave us his own recommendations, which was really helpful. Then our server, Megan H, came by and also helped us out with our selections. I was REALLY impressed by how knowledgable she was about the foods. She recommended drinks and answered all of our questions about portion size, flavor, etc. They also give you these chips to start off with, which are SO ADDICTING, and Megan was able to tell me what they were made of. Already obsessed.   The food was delicious. We got the scallops and samosa appetizers, which were definitely appetizer-sized portions. Just enough to split between the two of us. We also shared a dosa, which was very good when paired with the chutneys and the tomato-lentil soup that it came with. We also got two of their specialty cocktails, the Ante and the Peony, which were both quite good. Megan recommended their chai-white chocolate gelato (their dessert special that night), which we got, and it was amazing. Hints of chai in a creamy gelato... My boyfriend got their chai tea, which we were not really impressed with. We prefer spicier chais, and their's is quite mild. But all in all, it was a delicious meal.  The appetizers came out pretty quickly, but our dosa took awhile, which we were more than okay with. They kept us occupied with more of those chips. Then suddenly, we were told that since our dosa was taking awhile, it'd be on the house?! I have never had a restaurant take responsibility like that, and was most pleasantly surprised. Especially because I've waited longer for food from other restaurants. Dosa cares about the entire experience, not just the food, which was very refreshing. 5 stars, would recommend to a friend, and will definitely be back.",

The chutney was so-so and sambar was the best part of the meal.  -$13/dosa. seriously?  Here's the bottom line- If you're Indian or know what good, tasty Indian food tastes like, you're really going to be disappointed by this restaurant. We had the paneer &amp; peas, white truffle masala, spicy basil and rava sada dosa's. The names sounded extravagant and tasty but definitely did not live up to it. Don't get me wrong, the restaurant is nice but if you're looking to eat delicious Indian food, hit up an actual Indian restaurant that serves authentic Indian food.",

Now, having been a waitress, I totally understand that not all bartenders/chefs are okay with subbing, which is why I asked, but I would never have said it that way. It left a bad taste in my mouth, which was exacerbated by the fact that we weren't asked how our food was until after we were almost done, and the bus boy/food runners did most of the actual checking on us/filling our waters/clearing our plates (they were great by the way, so we slipped the most attentive one extra cash on our way out).   Service aside (which had been good the last time we were here), the food was awesome. We had a kale/carrot/cashew salad and lentil patties with an awesome yogurt sauce as appetizers. I had fish moilee, which was white fish (don't think the menu specified the type), with a really flavorful sauce over curry leaf rice. It was one of the best Indian food dishes I've had in a long time. Hubby had duck vindaloo, which was really spicy, but delicious, and the coconut rice was creamy and delicious.   Atmosphere is nice - pretty decor, comfortable chairs, etc.   The food was definitely 4.5 stars, but I've rounded down for service, which was more like a 2/3.",

I almost forgot, they have a tasting menu with wine parings for something like 40.00 or so. \u00a0Out of this world. \u00a0:)",

It's very elegant and beautiful inside, with high ceilings and big wooden tables, but still maintains a comfortable and kwasi-casual atmosphere.   We had a drink at the bar while waiting for the rest of our party, which is very open and sleek. I had the Bengali Gimlet, with curried nectar and lime juice, which was exquisite. I love the use of curry- very inventive and flavorful. We had made a reservation for Sunday dinner for 4 only a few hours before but they seated us with no problem in the cozy upstairs dining room after the other two had arrived.  Food! I tried:  Prawn-Chili Fry - I thought this was just okay, but one really loved this.  Samosas - Very tasty, I do love me some ground, spiced veggies stuffed in fried  pastries and dipped into varying flavor-packed sauces. Nailed it! The other star here was actually a small side salad, dressed in what seemed to be some sort of lemon-cumin vinaigrette. I wish I could order more of this as an entire dish as well!  Chennai Chicken - Not too crazy about this dish, something was a bit lacking for me.  White Truffle Masala Dosa - I may be a sucker for anything with truffles, but this one knocked it out of the park. A giant, thin crepe that is simultaneously pillowy-soft, yet crispy, filled with creamy, spiced, mashed potatoes and white truffle oil, served alongside three unique (fantastic!) sauces for tearing and dipping. We inhaled it in less than two minutes and had to order another.  The staff was very friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable of the menu, and the food was overall delicious. Price for a nice dinner for 4 with drinks was pretty reasonable as well, definitely with the price. I will definitely be back!",

Good: - Restaurant is very aesthetically appealing, in all ways - Great menu, everything looked really good and it was hard to narrow down - Papadum. yum.  Neutral: - Dining companion and I ordered different dosas. His marsala dosa came out big and overflowing the plate, and my paneer dosa came small and tightly wrapped. Wish we had known this difference up front. - Paneer dosa seemed slightly dry and lacking in texture. Even when dipped in the sauces, it still seemed to miss some kind of structure or relief from the soft texture. It was good and tasty, just wished for some structure or crunch. - Side order of poori was average, small portion for price  Meh: -We ordered, and our food was out in 10 minutes. We had timed it with a movie at kabuki but then we had, 45 minutes to kill. Our reservation was at restaurant's opening time but we felt rushed by it coming out so quickly (though I didn't feel though that was the intention, waiter acknowledged its speedy arrival).

I had the Chicken Xacuti for lunch with a friend there a few days ago and it was absolutely delicious. Hoping to share the deliciousness with my mother, I took her to Dosa this evening. Sadly, this Chicken Xacuti was made with so much hot pepper that it hid the delicious spice mixture of non-hot pepper spices like cardamon that made the Chicken Xacuti that I had for lunch there sing. It was very sad that they are inconsistent. When they aren't inconsistent, they are golden.  Both dosas that my lunch companions and I had, the spicy basil dosa and the spring vegetable dosa, were very good, and the sauces that they came with are marvelous.

The highlight of the meal was the lamb dish, recommended by our super informative and friendly server. It was cooked absolutely perfectly! We also had a vegetable side that I can't seem to find on the menu now - it may have been a seasonal item, which featured brussels sprouts and was kind of forgettable.

The atmosphere and service were also great. We were seated immediately at the communal table at 6PM on a Saturday, although the restaurant quickly filled up by 6:30PM. The service was lightning quick.",

The North and South samosas were also excellent (the South was my favorite... caramelized onion... yum!). Then I tried several different dosas and each gave me a different experience of flavors... subtle and dare I say, complex. Run, don't walk to Dosa on Fillmore. You will thank me.",

Food was really tasty and service was simply superb. We could complete all the dishes we ordered leaving behind the empty containers. If you like indian Chai dont foeget to order the masala chai at the end. I felt very refreshing after having it. Perfect spot for a date.

Although I heard great things about the restaurants from many of my friends (many of them that grew up with authentic Indian food), the elegance of the restaurant, the attentive servers, and quality and plating of the food far exceeded my expectations.  I had their summer seasonal tasting menu, which consisted of 3 courses from a pre-set menu for $39. Each course is a half-sized portion of the original, and thoroughly satisfying. With recommendations from the server (since I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food), I had the watermelon salad (mild), the trumpet mushroom uttapam (mild), and the chicken eggplant (mild/medium).   Everything was delicious, the mushroom uttapam was definitely my favorite - my boyfriend also liked it even though he hates mushrooms (strangely); the chicken in the chicken eggplant curry was extremely tender.   My boyfriend ordered the tamil lamb, which was also extremely tender (medium spicy) and yummy. It was a bit too spicy for me though.   Some side notes: - They have preset levels of spiciness in their dishes - Make sure to call ahead and make a reservation, it was pretty busy the night I went - Their chai tea has free refills - There is ample street parking around the area",

I'd visited both Dosa locations in the past and had a preference for the Valencia location because it felt cosier and more inviting. I'd commented to several friends in the past that although the Fillmore location looks nice, the combination of the high ceiling and the size of the restaurant makes it feel less private and more exposed.  However, on my most recent visit I was seated in a little area on the second floor just next to/behind the bar. Sitting up in that area I felt far more cozy and far less exposed. (It would also be an ideal place to people watch.)  The food at both locations is good. As their name implies, they make many different kinds of dosas, but they also a few other dishes like curries. I sampled a soup, a duck curry, an uttapam, and a lamb dish on my most recent visit and was quite satisified.",

I had the mint lemonade (on the assumption that it would help cure the thirty-six-wheel-truck that was roaming around in my head because of too much vodka the night before). There was nothing remarkable about the lemonade.   I ordered the White-Truffle-Masala-Dosa. Mostly because that just sounded interesting - usually in an Indian place that has dosas I will get the Rava dosa because I happen to be partial to those.   The dosa did not disappoint. It itself was well made. The Sambhar was rich and not watered down and could have been a touch spicier (that's just nitpicking). The coconut chutney was good too. I could taste the white-truffle-oil and it did really make the dosa delightful. PROTIP: White-Truffle-Oil does not do much for hangovers :-)  I also had the Rasmalai which was presented very nicely, I loved the bowl. It needed to be a touch sweeter though.  All in all - I will go here again. Without hesitation. And on my list of places for dosas this place is next after my friend Prashant T's house.",

    "review_text": "As our home-base was Japantown in SF, my fiancee and I looked for something new for dinner on a Wednesday night. After some Yelp sleuthing, we came upon Dosa on Fillmore.   Something that we haven't tried before? Yep! Something that isn't Japanese food? Yep! We didn't require transit to get there? Yep! The meal wouldn't break the bank? Yep!  So with that information in tow, we walked 5 minutes from our hotel to Dosa on Fillmore. To our surprise, the restaurant was quite upscale, but still retained a casual feel. We were greeted by the friendly hostess, who quickly led us to our table (booked on OpenTable).   Of course, we couldn't go to an establishment named after a food and not try said food item. So along with a Masala Dosa, my fiancee ordered a Paneer &amp; Cheese Uttapam and an order of the Chennai Chicken to start.   First came some homemade lentil chips. It was a bit oily, but burst with flavour (surprising, since the chip itself is very plain from what I assumed was ground lentils). I could only have a single chip, but oil aside the flavour was great.   Soon after, we received the Chenna Chicken, which was served in a bowl on top of a bed of red onions along with a savoury yogurt-based dipping sauce. This was my favorite part of the meal. The chicken pieces were breast meat, but still remained juicy. The seasoning had a substantial spicy kick to it, but when paired with the yogurt dip the flavours all came together and only really nice touch of heat remained at the end of the bite.   Next came the dosa, which comes with 3 dipping sauces: a spicy lentil soup, and a pair of tomato \u00a0and coconut chutneys. The lentil soup by itself explodes with flavour. The chutneys were both very delicious as well. As for the dosa itself- the dosa is basically a large, thin crepe folded in half with the filling inside. The crepe had a wonderful sweetness to it that mixed very well with the dipping sauce flavours. The filling (in this case potatoes, onions and cashews) was also very good, but was a touch heavy (since it's almost all starch). That said, all the flavours came together really well, and no one ingredient overpowered any of the others. The variety in dipping sauce flavours kept each bite different from the next, so overall it was a very engaging meal. I honestly thought we didn't order enough and insisted we order something else (the uttapam), but after the dosa and chicken starter my fiancee and I were stuffed. However, the uttapam came to the table so we couldn't ignore it.   The uttapam is basically a pancake with various ingredients embedded in it, and sliced like a pizza for your enjoyment. The same dipping sauces that accompany the dosa are present, providing the same flavour variety you get with the dosa. From what we could finish, the uttapam was delicious as well. The paneer (cheese) was mild, and added a nice creaminess to the dish which otherwise would've been a touch on the dry side.   I was really glad my fiancee decided to try this place. While she doesn't share the same enthusiasm as I do with the meal, it opened my eyes to another delicious aspect of Indian cuisine that I never knew existed. I just hope that the few dosa eateries in Vancouver are as good as this place was.",

The service: I only had one beer. \u00a0And my dinner companion only had one glass of wine. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Our server was basically absent. \u00a0After taking our order, he did not check back to see how our meal was proceeding. \u00a0And when the food was dropped by, it was quickly deposited on the table. \u00a0It seemed like a race. \u00a0Overall, for fine dining, it was some of the worst service I have witnessed in some time.  The ambiance: This was the strong point of the experience. \u00a0It is a very nice room. \u00a0I have to say the high ceilings, the decorative touches, and general overall styling of the room comes together to create an exotic and elegant space. \u00a0However, even here, the tables along the wall are placed too close together. \u00a0There is no sense of privacy. \u00a0 I would not want to be sitting at one of these tables for a date. \u00a0  The food: Overall, the food ranged from mediocre to slightly above average.  We selected the four course tasting menu. \u00a0I think this is where we may have lost our server. \u00a0After we told him we were each going to order the tasting menu, he became disinterested.   Even for a tasting menu, each of the portions were relatively small.  Starter: She selected - Grilled Calamari (the calamari was overcooked and tough) I selected - Chennai Chicken (this was actually pretty good. \u00a0the chicken was tender and the spices were nice) We shared.  Mini Dosa; She selected - Masala Chutney (This was good but not outstanding.) I selected - Spring (This was their take on a spring roll. \u00a0It was also good but not outstanding. We shared.  Each came with a trio of sauces -  Tomato - I liked it. Red Bean - She liked it. Coconut - neither of us are big fans of coconut.  South Indian Curry: She selected - South Indian Lamb Kofta (This was my favorite dish. \u00a0the lamb was tender. \u00a0The sauce was mild but had a very nice combination of spices.) I selected - Prawn Masala (The prawns were overcooked and rubbery. \u00a0The sauce was pretty amazing. \u00a0Another relatively mild sauce with an excellent blend of spices.) We shared.  Dessert: She selected - Gulab Jamoon (Neither of us liked this very much. \u00a0it was rather bland.) I selected - Banana Cream Pie (While it was a very small portion, it was actually very tasty. \u00a0It reminded my of my mom's banana pudding.) We shared.  Overall:  Based on feedback from multiple friends and \u00a0reviews, I had high expectations. \u00a0However, on this particular night, Dosa on Fillmore did not meet these expectations. \u00a0If I graded them as a run of the mill Indian restaurant, they would score 3 stars. \u00a0However, as a fine dining experience, they rate at 2.5 stars and, in this case, I am rounding down.  Service = 1 star (graded against fine dining expectations) Food = 3 stars Ambiance = 4 stars",

It's elegant without being overdone, and not fussy at all. Think high ceilings, large banquettes, and generous tables. The space is really quite beautiful.   Next, the food is just excellent. I like the Mission location's food too, but there are more offerings here--super appetizers (samosas = yummy), generous dosas with tasty fillings, delicious curries, and elegant entrees. Their salads are good, too. I've enjoyed several and have never been disappointed. I *love* the keema dosa, but the potato-based fillings are excellent, too. Even better, everything is so reasonably priced (between $12 and $15 per dosa or uttapam; it's between $20 and $32 for the entrees, which I've never felt the need to order because the dosas are so darn good!).   Each time I've been, my servers have been friendly and knowledgeable. I've also had some stellar drinks from the bar (an excellent sidecar and some very good wine). Add easy parking at the Kabuki to the mix (which is harder at their Valencia location despite that parking garage on 21st), and this is just a winning space. I will be back--many, many times.",

Or go traditional on weekend brunch with their fine rendition of thali (really a great way to get sudden exposure to the varied flavors of South India).  Whether I've gone in the day or night, the place stays lively (almost bursting on Thur/Fri/Sat). It's super to see a now \"older\" restaurant keeping its charm and substance, but staying modern; a good sign that Dosa is going to be (if not already) a San Francisco institution.

It was so lovely, chock full of spiced potato goodness with just enough truffle oil to give it a heavenly aroma and a rich, earthy taste. It was terrific on its own, and also nice with the cilantro-mint chutney. The Uttapam with Paneer and Peas was also really nice. It's almost like an adult version of grilled cheese I particularly liked it paired with the subtly spiced Channa Bhatura (a chickpea masala dish which is also terrific with its own soft, puffy wheat bread) and Dahl Rice (rice with yogurt and veggies). The rice is a terrific way to cut spice and bring out the flavors of a dish. The cocktails, even my virgin versions, are really nice. I recommend the Peony, it's a gin-based cocktail with has hibiscus masala nectar, coconut juice, lime and and a hint of chili. Even minus the gin, It''s delicate and quite refreshing. Dessert was a teensy bit disappointing, but I really appreciated that they had vegan offerings. The service at Dosa is really gracious and the atmosphere is romantic.

    "review_text": "There are hits and misses with this restaurant. I've been here a handful of times now with different groups to order different things.  Ambience: Beautiful two-story restaurant with nice light fixtures and classy atmosphere. Although, once we sat upstairs and I thought the images of skinny village children and old men were not comforting as we indulged in rich foods.  Service: Always promptly seated when you have reservations and the entire group shows up. Service is efficient and friendly. Minus a chutney episode we had the last time for Ayesha's birthday. Basically one of the managers flung a spoon of chutney on three girls while picking up the plates (one of them being the b'day girl!) It kinda put a damper on our evening because we were supposed to go out afterward to Harry's but instead they spent time in the bathroom; hand-drying their pants. The guy as nice enough to reimburse them for dry cleaning although it's still a pain to deal with.  Food: +Chennai Chicken- probably my favorite thing on the menu; spicy but tasty breaded chicken with yogurt dipping sauce +Samosas- regular North Indian samosa and South Indian samosa with masala filling +Vada Pai- OMG SO SPICY; i was drinking water for 10 minutes with shots of raw sugar and couldn't enjoy the rest of my meal; also ended up with a stomach ache because of this +Idli Fries- interesting concept; its basically a fried idli in the shape of a wedge fry +Collard Green Dosa- not my favorite; collard greens just don't mix with dosa +Paper Dosa- typical standard dosa with a side of sambar +Paneer &amp; Peas Dosa- I thought I'd like this but the peas were throwing off the taste +Lamb Keema Dosa- the lamb comes on the side and its perfectly seasoned +Uttapam- this was a favorite at the table and the mushroom one looked great  +Bengali Gimlet- amazing gin-based drink and I'm Bengali so this was a must-have for me  I prefer Udupi Palace in the Mission to Dosa for food but Dosa has its ambiance I guess.  -Hungry Hungry Pongy",

Everything was delicious, especially the aforementioned truffled dosa as well as the lamb curry. A couple of us ordered the wine pairing.

I ordered the spicy basil dosa, which was basically a gigantic, crispy triangle. It was pretty delicious on its own but the side sauces were key; they let you experiment throughout the meal and balance the spiciness to your liking. I also ordered the lamb meatballs, which were a bit expensive for what they were.   Luckily, we got there right before the main crowd and were able to secure half of the large communal table in the front after waiting at the bar, which was also a step up from most Indian restaurants. Another difference I noticed: very few if any Indian people actually work here. Make of that what you will, but this is definitely not your classic Indian curry joint, more like a modern interpretation of the usual cuisine.   Really cool decor and ambience. I'd go back for sure.",

[[ South Indian Moons ]] - a selection of five different uttapams. \u00a0One was more bland than the rest (it was mostly flavored with diced tomatoes). \u00a0One was a little more spicy with some peppers of the green variety. \u00a0Overall good, but I became so full that it was tiresome to eat this and appreciate the differences between them.  picture of the first 2 dishes: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-prn1%2F426186_10100303715294239_1153563631_n.jpg&amp;s=31e631b26c69033b9ce8463b6733687e69b1a5faa9f26812fe411e3f9e14caa7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/h\u2026</a>  [[ Dosa with Paper Masala ]] - soft/mashed potatoes, sambar, chutneys. \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0(On the 7x7 Big Eat list). \u00a0This is so huge! \u00a0Just look at it: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-snc7%2F423686_10100303718926959_989770718_n.jpg&amp;s=a2be6ae74f53da9a1f1a21d031a2c6a1572c722a7872489674e852989b57fca8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/h\u2026</a>  The cocktails were delicious as well, and had a nice Indian flavor kick to them!

For me, it really depends (not talking about the Hemsworth brothers, talking about Dosa now ;). It depends on how I'm feeing and how much I'm willing to spend that night. I have reviewed Valencia separately but I thought it would be helpful \u00a0to do a quick comparison. I found Fillmore to be a little expensive than its counterpart, it is also upscale and bigger and has a more trendy vibe to it. Perfect for a group to hang out by the bar and enjoy some delicious cocktails before grabbing dinner. The drinks here are very good. I would go to Valencia on a night when I just truly want to hog, get in and get out quickly, probably also when I'm not dressed too well: p  I have had a few dishes at both the locations and honestly they were pretty consistent in taste and quality. Fillmore has things on the menu that Valencia does not and vice versa. Reservations are recommended at both since it can get very busy especially for dinner and over the weekends. Dosa on Fillmore - I made reservations for four for a weekend and when we went here, of course, it was packed! We arrived about half an hour earlier than our reservations and had to wait at the bar since they did not have anything available sooner, which we pretty much knew. We grabbed a few cocktails and were seated upstairs.  Our server was very nice and accommodating. Our order came at a lightning speed, I think they brought our appetizers almost immediately! We must have ordered about seven people's worth of food among the four of us and we managed to finish every morsel of it! I am very surprised at how great the food is here. There are very few places who nail both South and North Indian dishes and Dosa does a pretty good job at both types of cuisines. Masala/Plain dosa and vada paav are must try's!",

Our waiter was awesome, he explained his favorite menu items, the rice or dosa that paired well, as well as wine that would compliment. We ordered the north &amp; south samosas, duck vindaloo, and the roasted chile and garlic dosa. We were warned both were extremely spicy, and they weren't wrong. I can handle heat extremely well but that didn't stop me from drinking half a dozen glasses of water (which they refilled diligently, thanks guys!). Even the tomato chutney packed a little punch.   All entirely worth it, the food was of extremely high quality. The duck was tender, the dosa was perfect crispy, and they brought us about 6 different chutneys for everything.

We had the fixed four course menu, which was an excellent deal. \u00a0Our courses: seafood soup and bhel puri (first course), lamb dosa and sweet potato dosa (2), kerala fish moilee and chicken (third course), apple tart and lava cake (fourth course).  I loved the seafood soup, it was fabulous, so much so I've asked my mother-in-law to recreate it. \u00a0My wife enjoyed her bhel puri, but as her family is from Bombay, she thought it could have used more sauces. The dosas were sada dosas with a stuffing, mine was lamb, hers was sweet potato. \u00a0The lamb was delicious, my wife thought the sweet potato was tasty and unusual. The third course was the real winner, the fish was delicious and her chicken was superbly spicy (even for her). \u00a0We also ordered a bature to go with it (delicious, on the thicker side, but delicious). \u00a0The fourth course desserts were tasty but not authentic. \u00a0My wife was sad they didn't have an interesting kulfi on the menu.  All in all, I think Dosa was delicious, the drinks we had were refreshing and the atmosphere is impressive. \u00a0The only disappointing thing to us outside of the food was that we were seated next to the server station, which meant the clanging of dishes sometimes meant it was impossible to hear each other speak. \u00a0But, it was a really enjoyable experience. \u00a0Will go again.",

    "review_text": "South Indian food is pretty much the only kind of Indian food I can tolerate at times. I had Indian food for both lunch and dinner (not by choice) the night before I tried Dosa on Fillmore, on this night I found myself attacking my idlli with glee (not ghee). It's just such a different experience from typical Punjabi food and nowhere nearly as oppressive with rich sauces and butter. Most dishes start out at a moderately high (for American taste buds) spice level that can only be increased so that it reaches \"gun powder\" status (ie, perfect for *my* American taste buds). Not spicy enough (you cray cray?), they'll gladly provide you with ways to get your mouth on fire, ie coconut chutneys (different from the kind you're used to).  Dosai is typically vegetarian (vegan in traditional places), but our server informed us that protein-heavy dishes could be found in the small plates. In addition to the idlli, I ordered the veggie sliders, which were tasty but I removed the rather pedestrian bread from the patty (?- too loose to call it that), which didn't leave me with much. I also wasn't in love with the rasam (soup) which I'm used to being much, much spicier. I do recommend the idlli with sambal. I unfortunately didn't get to try a dosa.  What I do appreciate about DOF is that it's aesthetically nothing like my regular dosa haunt on Long Island, which has a dreary interior that I will gladly suffer because I just love the food so much. DOF has a sumptuous ambiance that lends itself well to both large groups and more intimate dinners as well.   *Do* take advantage that this isn't the most authentic Indian restaurant and order a craft cocktail. I sampled enough of them to be able to say they are good at these. What? I'm all about taking advantage of situations.  Although I typically avoid desserts because I can't enjoy it on a full stomach, I tasted a variety of what they have to offer and I'm afraid I can't recommend any of them (especially the coconut custard). No big deal. I doubt I've ever had an Indian dessert that I liked.",

We all cheered, ate ,marveled over our food ( I was the ONLY non Indian person in the group) and flew back home happily after.  Yum! Dosa is pretty magical. It's not what you expect from an Indian restaurant yet it has everything you would expect. I love their dosas (obvi), chaats and even curry dishes. The service is always fantastic. Spice level- true to the cuisine. As a spice fiend, I hate Americanized spice levels.   Dosas- pretty damn magical! All perfectly cooked, fluffed, flaky and tasty. We had Masala dosas,  Regular plain dosas  Truffle dosas! \u00a0 Pani puri - these little things are my favorite to eat. You get to break the little balls of puff pastry, putt condiments and spice water in. And eat it. \u00a0I get to play with my food before eating it? Double score. So yummm Chenai chicken- tasty tasty! Oh and that one time last summer ( June,2013) my sassy waiter brought me exactly what I wanted. Extra spicy mind blowing Dosa! So spicy, it was laced with habaneros. It was so spicy, nobody at the table except me could eat it!   Respect you fellow blazer wearing person. Respect for blowing my mind. ( He was fierce in his velvet blue blazer- I had my non velvet blue blazer on. Of course we got along. ( He was a restaurant manager perhaps?) My fellow brunch people had to cool down with lassi and bloody mary to get that spice out. \u00a0Teehe. It was pretty mind blowing though. So hot! My friends always say I know way too many Indians. I do. And I love their food too.   Having tried a few too many restaurants and home cooked dinners/feasts , I can easily say Dosa kick ass. It was right up there with being my favorite indian restaurant. There are many in the bay area but I have always returned here on my visits. Not planning to stop that anytime soon.",

It didn't even feel like the same restaurant. It was so dimly lit I could not read the menu. When I asked for an extra candle or a flashlight for more light, the waitress sneered \"use your cell phone flashlight app like the other customers\". The advice would have been fine if I had a flashlight app or a cell phone.   I would still recommend the food and the drink but only on on the lower level--even sitting at the downstairs bar-- but the very unpleasant and dark mezzanine is where they punish customers who bother to make reservation and punish their workers--forced to descend and climb a steep staircase for every trip to the kitchen.

After checking the menu out online I figured it would be better to go for lunch (to spare our wallets a bit), and we didn't have to fight the crowds to get a table so it was win-win.   We arrived when they opened at 11:30 and were seated immediately. The interior is very large and floridly decorated, but it's tasteful and interesting (definitely eye catching). The service is impeccable; our waiter was very nice, attentive and even answered my random questions when it came to identifying items of my thali.   The BF ordered the Chennai Chicken as an appetizer, then the Prawn Frankie for his meal, while I ordered the vegetarian thali. First off: ORDER THE CHENNAI CHICKEN. This was the most perfectly cooked, tender chicken I have ever consumed, and it was coated in a combination of spices that enveloped your mouth in such a satisfying way. As if it couldn't get any better, they add a side of cucumber yogurt that you can dip your chicken it, which calms the spices and makes it even better!! That sauce was just as yummy as the chicken, and both my BF and I resorted to using a spoon to scrape the last remnants out of the cup ;)  The prawn Frankie looks like a wrap but it's filled with delicious shrimp and it's quite filling. As for my thali, when I received it I freaked out a bit because it was so gigantic! There were at least 10 little individual cups on this tray bigger than my head, and in the center were rice, and two kinds of bread. I couldn't name everything I had if I tried but I remember there was saffron rice, basmati rice, cucumber yogurt, veggies, a pickled vegetable of some sort, lentils, a spicy soup, a rice puff with ghee (tasted cheesy to me), and veggie curry among other things. There was so much variety but I was able to taste so many things for a reasonable price. LEGIT.  Overall this was a great dining experience. I would definitely come back, although the prices for dinner are a bit steep... then again they have a lot more entree options on the dinner menu so I bet it's worth it! Gotta come back and try the chai tea as well =)",

It was a lot of food for two but we somehow managed to scarf down the whole thing. \u00a0The dosa was this crepe like pancake with potatoes under which we were advised to smash down to flatten out the potatoes underneath to dip into these dipping sauces. I've been to several authentic Indian restaurants and to be honest I've never had a dosa before so it was quite nice being able to experience something new. I do want to mention while this dish was tasty it was HEAVY on the potatoes. But portion control is key so i was glad the hubs was with me to help attack this dish.

Great. Two stories, great service, romantic lighting at night, bright during the day/for brunch.   Cocktails? Truly some of the best in the city, if you're looking for interesting flavors and new combinations. The Peony w/ coconut milk, gin, and fresh chilies is my go-to, and you can't really get anything similar elsewhere. Same goes for many of the other cocktails.   Beer/Wine? List is huge, and includes hard cider and multiple sparkling wines by the glass.   Food? Fantastic california-indian food, that's fresh, interesting, and well presented. You can get your basic masala and rice, or get adventurous and pick something you've never had before; same goes for dosa. They also do a very relaxed brunch on the weekends, that has great dosa filled with scrambled eggs and indian spiced potatoes on the side.   If you're a first-timer or a little worried about heat, I'd get the panner &amp; pea dosa; even kids could have that. But if you want to branch out, do the tasting menu; it's totally worth it. The salad they had during the spring with fried goat-cheese balls, watermelon radishes, and curry vinaigrette was REALLY GOOD. The biryani are also great, as are any of the dosas. The uttapams are small, compared to everything else, but are a nice snack or small plate.   If you're visiting SF, want a great night out, or want to take an adventure with food, this is totally the place. Use OpenTable to book a reservation online, as it's a busy place and the wait can be 45+ mins on a Fri or Sat night, without a reservation.",

We started with a sparkling wine to go with our appetizer. \u00a0I ordered the petrale sole porichadu. \u00a0The sole was fried to perfection and went well with the winter chutney, which I think was made from squash. \u00a0The side salad had hints of coconut and other spices. \u00a0It was a great way to start the dinner.  For the second course, I ordered the khageena dosa, which had scrambled eggs, ginger, ghee, and cilantro. \u00a0The dosa came with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and lentil soup. \u00a0I really liked the lentil soup. \u00a0It was fragrant and spicy, and went well with the sweetness of the carrots and red bell peppers. \u00a0I wasn't a fan of the tomato chutney. \u00a0I preferred the coconut chutney with this dosa. \u00a0Which, by the way, was delicious. \u00a0Despite all the ingredients, like ginger and cilantro, it didn't overwhelm the flavor of the egg. \u00a0It was overall a balanced dish. \u00a0The wine that was paired with this was a chardonnay that was very fruit-driven and not buttery. \u00a0My roommate's white wine that went with her Winter Uttapam had no flavor. \u00a0I thought she was crazy at first, but I tried it. \u00a0And it really did have no flavor. \u00a0It was the weirdest tasting wine I've ever had.  I got the paneer and almond kofta for the third course. \u00a0The dish consisted of two veggie meatballs made up of parsnip, butternut squash, and potato buried in a curry sauce with coconut rice on the side. \u00a0The meatballs were drowning in the curry sauce. \u00a0I think it would've been better if it was just poured on top. \u00a0It seemed like a lot was wasted when I was finished. \u00a0The coconut rice was aromatic and softened the spiciness of the curry. \u00a0A red wine was paired with this dish.  And for dessert, I ordered the banana almond date cake, that was paired with a sherry dessert wine. \u00a0It was okay. \u00a0The cake itself didn't have a lot of flavor. \u00a0It relied on the banana and the spiced cashews for it. \u00a0But I think it was that way because it was paired with the sherry, which was very sweet and strong. \u00a0I actually preferred the kumquat fruit tart that my friend ordered.  Oh, and the waiter was very nice on giving us extra papadums. \u00a0They were delicious!!  Would I go back and pay full price? \u00a0Yes, but only for special occasions for dinner, or lunch. \u00a0The d\u00e9cor merits a fancier dress code, and the dinner prices reflect that. \u00a0There's a casual South Indian restaurant I go to in the Mission where you get more bang for your buck. But Dosa is definitely worth trying if you need to impress anyone.",

I was completely taken by surprise by Dosa on Fillmore, it is a stark contrast from its more casual Valencia location. The 'white table cloth' atmosphere here boasts high vaulted ceilings, a lower level of seating upon entry, an upper level that is more intimate, along with an option to sit along the fully stocked bar.   I enjoyed a subtly tart mango prawns that had just a subtle tinge of spice to it, although I do not proactively crave curried things I will admit that this was quite the exception in my book. \u00a0Especially when served with aromatic lemon basmati rice.",

    "review_text": "I love dosas! \u00a0Many are familiar with Indian food, including naan, curries, tikkas, etc. \u00a0However, people are not as familiar with Southern Indian fare such as dosas. \u00a0A dosa is a thin crispy crepe-like dish with curried potatoes in it... they are fantastic! \u00a0And while these are usually best found at hole-in-the-wall Indian restaurants, Dosa is an exception to the rule. \u00a0This place is a great place to enjoy some delicious Southern Indian food that has a slightly more upscale ambiance. \u00a0Good food, nice atmosphere, makes for a wonderful sit down spot for some lunch or dinner with friends.  Southern Indian food is not just excellent for their dosas, but for their other dishes as well! \u00a0If you are not sure what to order, I recommend the Masala Dosa, Channa Bhatura, some Uttapam (get the Uttapam variety plate if you're not sure which you want to try!), and Dahi Vada. \u00a0These were all delicious, and some great ways to experiment with Southern Indian food!",

    "review_text": "Wow! A little envious of the San Franciscans for having this fantastic restaurant so close in proximity!   I love Indian food and since I've moved from Washington DC to LA its been hard to find authentic Indian food. All the places in LA are extremely casual and nothing too exciting.   Enter, the perfect opportunity to eat some great Indian while in SF! Dosa on Fillmore is Southern Indian. I had never had southern Indian before and it's different dishes than the Northern Indian but same flavors and perhaps more spicy.   We ordered a lot of food - in hindsight, way too much food! We started with the chennai chicken - a glorified and much more flavorful version of the chicken nugget. This nugget had it going on! It was organic (yes organic at an Indian restaurant!) marinated in organic yogurt with cumin and coriander and fried. But they really didn't taste fried.   For entrees we ordered the lamb chops (omg these were good), the chicken biryani and the white truffle dosa (a potato filled crepe). The lamb chops came with a mildy spiced lentil sauce that had a sweetness to it that I loved. The chicken was shredded and tender mixed into basmati rice with caramelized onions, peas and cashews and was tender and amazing! The dosa smelled of white truffles but didn't really taste like truffles much, which was a bit of a let down. \u00a0  We also got the bhatura - this large puffy bread that reminded me of a donut in the best possible of ways. Yummy!   Everything was much spicier than I anticipated. I was really feeling the heat, which I loved, but I know for someone who is spice averse this would be a turn off.   I would have loved to try their desserts but I was SO full that there was no chance.   The space is big, open and modern. It was very lively on a Wednesday night at 9pm. I Will definitely come back here when I am back in SF!",

I would any day prefer Amber, Sakoon over Dosa.   Will I come again? Maybe Expect to pay: $60/pp with no alcohol",

Let's just say that they spent quite a bit of money on the items they have chosen to decorate the place. I won't go into detail with the pieces because I don't want to spoil it for ya. Go see it for yourself. I love the high ceilings and the top floor seating. Although the downstairs area is nice too. \u00a0  THE BAR AREA- I must say that they have the most legit bar staff in the whole Bay Area. They are quick and the orders just keep coming in and the bartenders just keep pushing them out. Sometimes we come in just for drinks before our movie next door at the Kabuki Theater and I always love sitting at bar to watch \u00a0bartenders. They sure do know how to put \u00a0on a show.   Cocktail drinks- I absolutely love love love the PEONY! So delicious. It has this hibiscus masala nectar and kaffir lime leaf top off with birds eye chili and orange blossom water and of course the alcohol choice is a gin and the coconut milk. Doesn't that just sound so enticing! They have a variety of great cocktails on their menu but the Peony is my fav.  The food- There is a tasting menu which gives you a selection of their popular dishes, three course meal. Wine pairings are also suggested. Other wise they also have full menu of all their wonderful and delicious Indian Cuisine ranging from different levels of heat. I tend to go for all the lamb dishes. Lamb meatballs is the best.   I love the staff here. Everyone is so friendly and you just know that they all mean business and I can see why Dosa has received so many different awards for their food and drinks. This place has to be my all time favorite Indian Restaurant. The Peony alone is worth coming in for a quick drink. This place is alway busy so be prepared to wait but patience is a virtue because you will not be disappointed.",

First of all, we have a four year old and we told them this from the get-go an asked whether or not we should look elsewhere because we didn't want to inconvenience anyone by bringing a toddler. \u00a0They said 'come on in' - Dosa is a kid-friendly place. \u00a0That \u00a0might be true in terms of service but there is not a single thing on that menu that a kid can eat because of the ridiculous amount of spice in everything. \u00a0They brought us some $10 version of a grilled cheese sandwich and the kid hated it. \u00a0I didn't like it either. \u00a0They brought us a bowl of coconut rice that was super spicy. And then they made a mistake and brought us popadoms with pepper in them. \u00a0So, the kid was not happy.  Now, onto the adults. \u00a0We all ordered different stuff from tasting plates to Dosas to udapams and the consensus all around is that all you could taste from one plate to the next is spice , spice, spice. \u00a0There's \u00a0no reprive from the amount of heat from one dish to another so pretty soon everything tastes exactly the same. \u00a0Maybe this is how people eat in India - I got the schpeel from our waiter - but you've got to tone it down, Dosa. \u00a0We don't eat Chinese food in America the same as in China because Americans don't like that kind of food. \u00a0You could say the same about a lot of ethnic cuisine. \u00a0You have to make the food work for the palates of the people you are catering to. \u00a0And none of the eight SF-foodie gringos at our table liked what you had to offer or your prices. \u00a0$15 for a pancake and a smattering of cheap ingredients. \u00a0Give me a break!!!  It was a disappointing few hundred bucks that we spent and I'll stick with my Indian favorite - Mehfil - the next time we decide to go Indian as they pack huge flavor into their stuff without overpowering the spice factor. \u00a0I recommend you do the same! \u00a0And don't ever bring a kid there. \u00a0Big mistake!",

You will only see maybe 2. All the other cooks were your typical Mexican or Chinese looking. Most of the patrons were white. White people in an Indian restaurant is not a good sign. Indians go to really good Indian restaurants, Indians know how to cook and are not going to pay to eat lousy food. Especially $11.00 for a dosa.

    "review_text": "When friends from out-of-town ask me for an SF restaurant recommendation, Dosa on Fillmore is usually in my top 5.  This place just works on so many levels. The food is always good, the cocktails are among the best in town (and infused with Indian spices, house-made tinctures, nectars, cordials and bitters), the decor is exquisite, and the dining room and bar area is always packed and lively. This feels more like a New York night club than a South Indian restaurant. Once you walk through the door, you just want to join the party.   I always like to start out with their Chennai Chicken (fried, boneless chicken bites marinated in yogurt with coriander and cumin). This dish is technically an appetizer, but it's big enough to be a whole meal. I also recommend the Samosas \"North &amp; South\" (savory pastries filled with caramelized onions and veggies (South) and spiced potatoes (North). Both North and South come with sweet and spicy dipping sauces.  Obviously, this restaurant is famous for their Dosas (a large, savory rice and lentil crepe, served with fresh coconut &amp; tomato chutneys and sambar, a lentil dipping soup made with veggies and spices). My favorites are the basic Masala (a classic dosa filled with mashed potatoes, onions and cashew nuts), and the Spicy Mung Masala (made with green chilies, chopped onions, cilantro and spiced potatoes). This is finger food at its finest! You definitely won't walk away with an empty stomach. Warning: the Roasted Chile &amp; Garlic Masala is incredibly spicy! Don't get me wrong, I love spice. But this thing had my eyes watering for 20 minutes And then I made the mistake of rubbing my eyes, and it only made it worse.  The restaurant also offers some other tasty (non-Dosa) selections, including some seasonal curry dishes, a chicken biryani, and vegetarian dishes. One of the best items on the menu is the grilled lamb chop (marinated in spices, and served with lentil sauce, spiced potatoes &amp; cauliflower, and raita). It's out of this world, my friends.  ** Reservations are definitely recommended. ** This is a great spot to hit up before or after a movie at the Sundance Kabuki Theatre (across the street). ** Food prices are reasonable (but more expensive than your average Indian restaurant). The cocktails are delicious and go down easy (but they ain't cheap). Be careful how many you order because your bill will quickly add up.",

Had some beers and tried everything on the bar menu and would have to tip the cap to the fried chicken bites. Fortunately the main dinner menu opened up and we were able to roll up the sleeves.   The duck vindaloo is an absolute joke - so good. Just fall off the bone duck served over some basmati rice. The heat was solid but not overwhelming and just couldnt have been more tender - literally shredding off the bone. This was my first experience with this regional Indian cuisine and it was money.   Definitely recommend giving Dosa a try but bring a benji at a minimum.   Also had the mushroom nan - not my bag but my D8 loved it, so there's that.",

All of the items I have tasted so far, taste very authentic and even the new age-inventive ones are really good. You know how annoying it gets when foreign cuisines taste completely different in the U.S because they have been modified for the American Palette? That has NOT happened here. What i mean is, you will not find either bland or extremely stereotypical - spicy curry like food here. \u00a0That being said, I can only vouch for the dosas, idli, vada and the other typical south Indian dishes. I have not and will not try other dishes here ever.   White truffle masala and fried idli (appetizers) are especially good. There is usually a long waiting time if you go without reservation. Even if you have to wait for an hour, I think it will be worth it!",

I arrived seconds before she did around 5:45 and we were seated immediately at the communal table near the bar (we were the first to sit at this giant table). I didn't read any yelp reviews prior, so I only knew it was going to be Indian food. When I peered at the menu, I was a little bit shocked to see the prices (~$30 for curry). Since it was my first time, I only wanted to test the waters and thankfully my friend didn't intend on eating a full dinner either. We each got one drink and shared an order of lamb keema dosa, which was super delicious. It was flavorful without being overwhelming, and it didn't make my stomach hurt like most Indian food did afterwards. Also my friend got the peony gin cocktail, which she swears by. I'm totally getting that next time. I got a virgin drink that had mint and a bunch of stuff in it, reminded me of a mojito. What really blew me away was our waiter. I think he worked at the bar. Even though we didn't order a whole lot for a typical evening at Dosa, he still was super nice and friendly. He even asked complimented me on my nail polish and asked about who did it. (Um, yeah that would be me... And I just did it to cover up old gel polish I didn't have time to go get removed). He was so sweet, you swear you were high school BFFs. Thank you! You were so fun! I didn't end up getting the bill, since my friend was treating me (and wouldn't let me pitch in), so I don't know how much we tipped. But for the friendly service and tasty food, despite the cost of the food itself, I would totally return!",

Admittedly, I have been there twice before and had a great experience, but this time that was not the case. I had made a reservation for 7pm, but when we got there the hostess said that our table wasn't ready and that we would have to wait \"a few minutes\". Twenty minutes later, they finally seated us.   We ordered a few things, and the waiter was initially helpful in telling us which items had cilantro in them, since my boyfriend can't eat cilantro. However, he neglected mention that the side of rice we had ordered had cilantro in it, so when it arrived my boyfriend couldn't eat it. Also, my boyfriend ordered an appetizer that never arrived and was not on our check. Other than that, the food was delicious, and the drinks were fantastic. I got the channa batura and my boyfriend ordered the mulligatawny chicken. We shared an egg dosa, which was surprisingly good (I was a bit skeptical about the eggs).   Then the bill came and the total was over $90, so our damage was over $100 with tip. I know this place is expensive, and the food is really great, but for that much money I expect stellar service, which we did not have. I give them four stars for food but two for service. I can only hope that it will be better next time-- if we go here again.",

Dosa has a regular bar where you can eat, but I love the big community table just past the hostess station. It makes you feel like you're still part of the bigger restaurant as a whole, but you don't feel like you stand out when you're eating alone. I will often dip in somewhere to grab a bite, as the teens have all their activities and I've sometimes gotta kill some time and it's mealtime.  So Wednesday night, came in around 7:30 and no problem to sit at the community table. Very friendly, very competent service. After asking a few questions, I landed on ordering the Bhel Puri and just the straight up classic Masala dosa. When the Bhel Puri came, I had completely forgotten what was in it....but it was so delicious that I gobbled it down pretty quickly. Looking at their online menu now, it was puffed rice, roasted parsnips, potatoes, tomatoes, onions &amp; tangerines, flavored with spicy mint and tamarind chutneys. I highly recommend it. Then the dosa came...and it was just fine. It's not the first time I've been here, and not the only place I've had dosas, but it had been awhile so I was somewhat surprised when the filling seemed to be all plopped into the middle of the crepe-like outside. No big deal - I spread it around as I tore it off and dipped it sauces. But just a little odd.   Anyway, of course I started chatting up the ladies who were seated across from me, as we had seen each other in line at the film festival we just came from, so I spent most of the evening talking with them....so never felt like I was alone. But if I had never talked with anyone, I still would have felt extremely comfortable here eating alone.",

Too salted, no biryani flavor, et al. All this would have been still fine if the servers hadn't taken over 5 minutes to re-fill my glass with wine, as well as just taken the glass away after 2 drinks without caring to ask if I'd like some more.

Well, but that was ruined because we were seated at a communal table, across from each other. On our right side, one guy and two women in their middle ages were talking about some serious mid-life crisis stuff (at some point, they talked about an ex-wife who did voodoo right in front of her son). On our left side, a couple was dining and talking about some classy movie stars like Keanu Reeves.

They could have told me it was a potato pancake and I would not have known the difference. Get something else!   2nd course: Dosas with lamb (+ we got masala on the side). Meh. Dosa tasted like a not as tasty version of Ethiopian sour dough rolls. They provided two types of chutney with dosas, but that wasn't flavored strongly enough to complement the sour taste of dosa. The lamb was okay, and the masala was okay. But I didn't think anything was great or amazing. Also, they only gave us one roll of dosa and we thought given the price, we would have liked one more. \u00a0 \u00a0  3rd course: Chicken Xacut. This was actually pretty good. It was spicy (pretty spicy), red Indian curry with chicken in it served with rice. \u00a0  All in all, I thought it was a good one-time experience.

Even though the place was packed when we arrived Sunday night, we were seated quickly. There is a cool vibe and a more upscale ambience than what I've experienced in the Indian restaurants I'm used to going to ( the kind that serve the inexpensive lunch buffets). I liked the variety on the menu - in addition to the curries and vindaloos and variations of lamb, there are dosas and uttapam. I have to admit I hadn't heard of the latter two before, so of course that's what we had to try. First though, we decided to go for the cocktails. I chose the \"peony\" because peonies are one of my favorite flowers and I thought it would be interesting as a drink - wow, it was delicious and unique! From what my companions said about their drinks, this would definitely be my choice again.   Instead of bread, we had pappadums (or at least that's what I thought they were) - kind of like Indian tortilla chips and really addicting. For dinner, we started with an appetizer - we went for the standby North and South Samosas, which were basically yummy as you would expect. We also ordered the Vada Pav (vegetarian sliders) on the recommendation of the server, but those didn't show up until we were nearly done with our dinner so we just brought them home. As I said, the restaurant was crowded and maybe that is the reason for the spotty service, but it seemed they should not have charged us for something that was their error (we didn't ask, but if a restaurant has really good customer service, you shouldn't have to). Since the entrees tend to be expensive and the name of the place is Dosa, I think it's a good plan to go with ordering dosas for your meal - very filling! \u00a0My choice was a Spicy Basil Dosa, which came as all the dosas do, with fresh coconut and tomato chutney as well as sambar (lentil dipping soup) - delish! My friend loved the dips so much that even when she was done with her dosa, she scooped up the rest with her spoon and enjoyed every drop. We were all too full for dessert. Overall, Dosa was a great experience for the food, and hopefully the service will be better next time.",

I am soaking up water all night and all next day. My face is puffy too.  The duck vindaloo was quite dry, not living up to the expectations. The prawn masala was delicious and definitely my favorite. My father favors the lamb curry.   The food is very salty. If it wasn't so salty, it'd be much more delicious.",

The ambiance was great: beautiful lighting structures, not too loud, and a wonderful crowd of families and people on dates. The food is probably not authentic but I found it to be well-done and very delicious. The kabocha squash small plate was great, not too oily, thoroughly cooked. The lamb dosa was amazing! The crepe was huge and while a bit greasy, it complimented the spicy, herb-y lamb filling nicely. My mouth was on fire (though I do have a low tolerance for spicy) but it was so good I kept eating. It also came with a spicy soup which was flavorful but not overpowering. I found the portions to be generous and barely managed to finish my dessert, which was also great - the cheese balls in a rose water cream (don't know what it's called).  Overall, would come again on a date and definitely getting the lamb dosa again.",

Our party of 7 was served upon by AC. \u00a0He was every bit patient with some of us who weren't real sure what to order and answering questions about the menu. \u00a0For some who weren't too keen on \"spicy\" he suggested the Papadam with some yogurt sauce. \u00a0Good call!  Several in our party ordered a Dosa, but I couldn't get past the Lamb \"Frankie\". \u00a0I asked for extra spicy, and they did just that! \u00a0It was yummalicious, juicy morsels of lamb combined with South Indian spices rolled up in roti. \u00a0It hit the spot. \u00a0I can't wait to come back with my bf and sample some small plates. \u00a0  The decor inside is beautiful and themed appropriately emanating South Indian motifs and colors. \u00a0-love the lavish chandeliers and as I remember, the lighting gets dramatic and creates a perfect date night atmosphere.  The only thing I would say is despite many people being in the restaurant for our late lunch the drinks came out kind of slow (wine and dirty martinis) or we were drinking too fast. \u00a0-guess that's what happens when you're having fun. lol \u00a0They were good with keeping our water glasses full though and clearing the table. \u00a0-awesome spot and definitely one of my favorites. \u00a0  Heck yes, I'll be back!",

    "review_text": "As always and expected, DOSA on Fillmore lives up to its name and reputation. Named after a famed bread of South India, DOSA rocks this jazzy part of town night after night with its curries and beautiful South Indian flavors. The restaurant is stylish, chic and innovative. It is upscale for sure. But nice to know a place prepares delicious dishes that combine fresh ingredients and uncomplicated layers of flavors. DOSA is no bs -- it tells you that Indian food does not have to be difficult. This restaurant not only provides inspiration for food lovers or a self-proclaimed foodie like me and easy- to-eat dishes that begin with basics for those who are less assured in an Indian restaurant. With its visually enticing plates, this place makes a great place to share a great time and good, I mean really good Indian food, with your friends. As an enthusiast cook who specialize in Indian food myself, I believe good food is a combination of fresh ingredients and uncomplicated layers of flavors. When you start with quality produce, a few simple flavors will just complement and contrast with your base ingredients to create the perfect taste experience. Think of food with passion, not anxiety, and feel free to substitute as you please. This is often how personalized culinary masterpieces are created. That's DOSA. Tonight, just like everytime, the dishes were spiced, flavored, curried and cooked to perfection and all arrived lavishedly drizzled or bathed in light raita and sauce. Getting in, we knew what this place is all about, the air inside flavored unmista y... We asked for two major curry dishes and \u00a0the go-withs -- the lemon and coconut basmati rice, and four other small plates including its biggest star -- the dosa itself. It is truly a star dish to say the least -- favored so beautifully to perfection, light, crispy, fluffy and folded perfectly on a flat white plate. Scratch it gently with the fork and the flavors burst out... The other small plate that I truly enjoyed tonight is the scallop dish -- perfectly seared and served over a light raita sauce. Coming from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where Indian food is everywhere, my girls know the delicate southern taste of India and were pleased with their maincourses and side orders tonight. The craftcocktails were unbelievably delightful, too. I am giving them another double thumbs up! We ordered the vodka-based Peony, Half Moon, Hanging Gardens, and Ginger Ice Tea. They are DOSA's prize fighters and truly refreshing. If you are a light weight like me, tell them because each kicks in nicely and warms you up almost instantly. Tonight, the food/drink pairing was spot on--light lamb and fish curries were beautifully paired with sweetened cocktails instead of its famed Sujata wines. The service was really sweet to say the least -- by that I meant relaxed and unhurried. Drinks unpushed.  The noise level was good. The price? A little pricey but it is an upscale restaurant and a great place to celebrate with loved ones. Go!",

Disclaimer: I never finished my PhD in Indian cuisine, so I cannot attest to the authentic-ness of the food here, but I enjoyed Dosa's food along with the chic-lounge atmosphere.  My happy hour beverage of choice: -Chili-margarita! ($6) \u00a0Your basic margarita with a spicy kick. \u00a0I'll take two! \u00a0It might not be on the menu when you go, because I think the happy hour drinks rotate.  Happy hour menu choices: -Samosas 'North and South': \u00a0Maybe it was the chili margaritas, but I couldn't really tell the difference between North and South (i'm talking about the food here, not my motor skills). \u00a0Regardless, the dipping sauces are what really made this dish. -Chennai chicken (2 orders): I love the popcorn chicken at Tapioca Express, and that is basically what this is, minus the spice. \u00a0Served with a creamy, tangy yogurt sets this apart from your typical TapX chicken. \u00a0The chicken was crunchy on the outside, yet juicy and tender on the outside. \u00a0One order should be sufficient for two people if you are sampling other goodies. \u00a0 -Vada Pav (vegetarian slider): \u00a0Two sliders per order. \u00a0Not my favorite dish of the night, but definitely worth a try.  Dosa choices: -Paper masala: \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0Pretty simple dish consisting of a paper-thin crepe served with Indian potatoes and dipping sauces. \u00a0This is a definitely a staple dish that I order when I go to Dosa.  -White truffle masala: \u00a0Delicious x 2. \u00a0Essentially the paper masala, but with the Indian potatoes drizzled with truffle oil and stuffed inside the crepe. \u00a0I'm drooling just thinking about it.  At $34 per person, this isn't the cheapest happy hour I've been to (then again I've probably dropped more at other happy hours on booze alone), so I take back my statement. \u00a0Overall, a fun place to go for happy hour--great food, delicious drinks, and a chic atmosphere!",

The dosa comes with two chutneys....coconut and tomato. Both the chutneys were delicious.  TIP: \u00a0If you are like me and prefer the masala on the side and not inside the dosa, make sure you emphasize that you dont want extra masala, but just the masala on the side. \u00a0I was charged $4.00 because I said 'masala on the side'. \u00a0  Overall - one of the best dosa places I have been to. \u00a0Just try it to believe it!!!!",

    "review_text": "Note: I'm half Indian and a lot of this is me nitpicking and offering constructive criticism. If you're reading this on a phone and don't want to read my novel length review, here's the short version: Delicious! Go here!  After all the hype, I knew I would have to try one of the fabulous Indian places in SF--and as it happened, one of Dosa's locations is right down the street from the Hotel Kabuki, where I was staying. It also happened to be right across from the theater I had been planning to see a movie at later that night. Dosa and then the Hunger Games--it seemed as if it was meant to be!  The building took me by surprise--I was expecting classy, but not this much grandeur! Our waiters were helpful, though somewhat socially awkward--not really picking up on our cues and there were definitely some awkward silences that were a little weird. Overall they were helpful and good natured, however, and were happy to explain everything to us.  I am half Bengali and have been to India several times, but I have only been fortunate enough to make it south once. I also lived in Los Angeles for a long period of time, and frequented Artesia, so I'd like to think that I know my way around south Indian food pretty well.  I was intrigued by some of the cocktails, but the waiter sold me on the Ginger Ante, which was quite good--had the warmth and the bite of ginger, rather than just the taste. \u00a0My boyfriend and I decided to make the most of our experience and try a little bit of everything. We ordered the South Indian Moons (5 uttapam sampler) and a tasting menu with the things we had read the most raves about: Chennai chicken, the white truffle masala dosa, and the mango prawns.  In all of my experience, South Indian food is sort of like an inferno of deliciousness in the mouth. This definitely seemed like the white people version, with the spice toned waaay down. The dosa itself was sour, but not quite at the level you usually get. That does not mean that it wasn't delicious, though! I was having a love affair with that potato filling, like that annoying pop song by September. \"No I can't get over, and I don't know why...\" Seriously tasty. The sambar was right on par and the chutneys were delicious as well - the coconut lime one went exceptionally well with the delicateness of this one, I think.  The Chennai chicken was pretty good, but again, I was wanting more spice! I used to get samosas every day when I was in Calcutta and their Northern interpretation was good--they came to our table a little less than piping hot, and if they're anything less than piping hot then the breading can seem a little heavy handed. The southern version was fantastic, though--creamy sweet onions and very well spiced.  The uttapam sampler was one of my favorite things. They brought out sunchoke, paneer, tomato, potato, and green bell pepper (?). The sunchoke was pretty good--the crunch from the sunchokes was a playful element, though at times the pieces would fall out so it seemed it could be a little better married (maybe smaller chunks?). The tomato and potato were my two favorites, with the potato definitely coming out on top - a light, fluffy, slightly sour dream of an uttapam. The paneer I left to my boyfriend because I cannot eat cheese, and he said it was good though it did convey the sometimes spongy quality that paneer can have--nothing wrong with that per se but he is picky about texture. The green bell pepper--question marked because I am not sure if that is exactly what it was--was delicious, whatever it was, crunchy with small enough chunks that it was a seamless part of the uttapam. It had the freshness of green bell pepper without the bitterness, which was really wonderful.  Finally, we were served the mango prawns. The prawns themselves were succulent, the coconut rice fragrant. It took me some time to realize that the chunks were actually mango, though that should have been obvious. If you get this, try to eat them with the prawns--they are quite intense on their own. Overall, no complaints on this one--I was full to bursting and still ate half of it.  Overall, we had a really great experience. Dosa makes South Indian elegant, and while I was missing some of the fire, it was still a delightful experience.",

Definitely worth a revisit next time I'm in town.   Dosa does upscale Indian right. The food is great, the environment classy, drinks excellent, and yet you don't feel completely robbed after paying the check. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with the tasting menu, a three course meal for $35. Add on the wine pairing for just $18 more and you will be served pours that are practically full-size and perfectly complementary to your courses.   I'm a little hazy on the details of each dish I had but I know the samosa I started with blew away the samosa I had during my lunch at another restaurant earlier in the day. The second course is a choice between some uttapam and dosa variations; I had never tried either before but the the dosa I ended up ordering was absolutely delicious. The lentil dipping soup served alongside was the perfect accompaniment. The whole thing reminded me of an Indian version of an American favorite: grilled cheese and tomato soup. My third course was some sort of spicy boneless chicken which was also very nice.   Just thinking about this dinner makes me smile because I was also in great company. What's better than sharing an awesome meal with awesome people?",

Their DAT menu is short, with only 3 choices for starters and 4 choices for the main dish. She opted for the Chennai Chicken to start and Lamb Kofta for main. \u00a0I wasn't that hungry, I had a huge bowl of oatmeal for breakfast, so I just opted for the Paneer &amp; Peas dosa.   Our Chennai chicken app came out quick, it's boneless, it's fried, it's tender! \u00a0seasoned with coriander and cumin, it had a smokiness to it and \u00a0 I was surprised it didn't have that much heat. \u00a0It was served with an asian slaw.  The Lamb Kofta was absolutely tasty and served with saffron rice. \u00a0My Paneer and Peas dosa was filled with shredded farmer's cheese, peas and cilantro. \u00a0You can dip your dosa in your sambar, which is a spicy lentil soup with veggies. \u00a0Or you can dip this into your tomato or coconut chutney. \u00a0I chose to eat my sambar separately and had sweat beads on my forehead by the time I was done. Everything was delicious.   The resto was full with every seat in the main dining room occupied and some people at the bar, but we didn't have any problem with service, although I had to ask for a water refill in the end as we paid the bill.  The DAT 2 course menu is $17.95 and is offered Wednesday thru Sunday. Don't forget, they add 4% SF healthcare charge to your bill.",

We started out with the Chennai Chicken. I highly recommend this. It was tender and had a nice spice. We then ordered the Masala Dosa and the Prawn Masala. We loved the Prawn dish and the sauce was fantastic! The Masala Dosa on the other hand was not a huge favorite. I think it was the spice that they used that was off putting. Not terrible but not good enough to finish. Overall I would say our visit was pleasant (service was great) but it won't be a spot we will be hitting often.

    "review_text": "Okay, first things first... giving credit where credit is due... the food was amazing. Every single dish was delicious, aesthetically pleasing, and served hot. From a flavors/textures/yum factor, this place is WAY up there.  But the service... God... the service...  Now understandably, it was a challenging day. There was a Ramen Festival about 10 feet away from their front door and as a result, the street was closed off, there were people outside everywhere. We get that. Also, because of said event, traffic was nightmarish. It cost me almost $20 in an Uber to go 1.8 miles to Dosa today, a drive that would normally be about five bucks. And we hopped out and walked the last block, because that last block would have taken us another ten minutes in the car. Fair enough.  But our party of eleven trickled in as best we could under said circumstances, as people were helplessly stuck in gridlock and/or desperately seeking parking. Like everyone else at the restaurant, we were doing the best we could to get there and get seated.  And the restaurant just wouldn't quit bugging us about when our party would arrive. Now, we had 8 people there out of a party of eleven. Food was being ordered. Cocktails were being ordered. We weren't only NOT squatting, but we were still a large party ordering a lot of food and spending a lot of cash.  But part of the reason lunch took so long, and actually the part more responsible for the delay than our transportation issues, was that EVERY time we wanted to order more of something, or someone new arrived and had to order, it took FOREVER. Half of our orders had to be placed again, 15 minutes later, on three separate occasions because someone on the staff dropped the ball. Reminders were not handled gracefully. Coffee was never refilled, until the third time asking. A few times we (very politely) asked the staff to take new orders, were told to wait, and never returned to.  Delicious food, good location, reasonable prices, and beautiful aesthetic. But why didn't anyone bother to train the waitstaff to wait tables?",

Dosa unlike a prime steak or things of that nature that deals with pricey raw materials, does not cost all that much to make. So when I think of the folds of profit they make on an item, it does not seem to add up. Well on the flip side, its more of an upscale locale with a great decor. The waiters seemed seriously concerned about my satisfaction which is always nice. The dip dishes was intense. I am from south India where this dish originates and no kidding they have nailed their sambar recipe.",

Being lactose intolerant, I usually avoid Indian restaurants since most of the usual dishes contain some sort of dairy product so it's really great that Dosa provides special dietary information so I know exactly what dishes are safe for me. They also try to use mostly all organic ingredients in their cooking which is a plus.  Paper Dosa ($11.5) -Huge and good dish to share with the table. A nice crispy crepe with tasty chutneys and sambar. Sambar was a bit too salty but the potatoes were delicious. Eat this dish when it freshly arrives because it became soggy once it got cold.   Pepper Chicken with coconut rice ($18) -The chicken and sauce was a bit too salty. The chicken was tender and juicy, and actually did \"fall off the bone\" as how the menu described it. The coconut rice had actual shredded coconut flakes in it and was delicious.  Mango Lassi ($5) -Smooth and creamy but a bit too tart.  The prices are reasonable. The ambiance and service is great.

Best part of the night though was the Lamb Chops entree I ordered. \u00a0SOOOOO GOOD I'm drooling as I type. \u00a0Incredibly tender and covered in a curry sauce that is SPICY. \u00a0I really wanted to keep eating but I was so full from the drinks &amp; starters that I only finished half. \u00a0Took home the leftovers and ate it the next day and it was still just as good. \u00a0This beats everything I've ever eaten at Dosa. \u00a0  Finished the dinner off with 3 desserts that I honestly can't really remember. \u00a0If you read my other reviews, I'm clearly not a dessert person so I could care less. \u00a0I do remember they were very pretty to look at though. \u00a0Our waiter was so nice and informative and made great suggestions so service was on par too!",

    "review_text": "Bottom line at the top: 3 stars for food, rounded up to 4 for impeccable service. -- Came here with a(n Indian) friend who has been convincing me to try this place for so long.   After an exhausting day of shopping in the city I had no willpower to read through the incredibly long menu. So we went with the pre-fixe that had three options for each course (no dessert).  We had (the menu online isn't current so i can't really remember the last two dishes): chennai chicken, lamb kofta, broccolini dosa, spinach fennel and mustard greens dosa, another type of lamb, and cranberry chicken.  the chennai kofta was soo good but pretty spicy (at least to me, my spice tolerance is pretty low). this would turn out to be a recurring theme for the night so if you don't have a high spice tolerance i would maybe reconsider your options haha. the lamb kofta was way too spicy for me and also had a little bit of a weird texture.  i did not like the second course at all. there was a sauce that came with each dosa/uttapam that really did not sit with me. and the fillings inside both were kinda weird. i would recommend asking if you can get them to be served plain, with no sauce or fillings. they would be much better this way.  we were so absolutely full at this point so we took the last course to go. it was just okay. so overall i probably wouldn't recommend the pre-fixe.   i can't remember out waitresses name unfortunately but she was absolutely fantastic. she was very helpful in explaining stuff to me and definitely slowed down the pace for us since we were talking so much not really eating. the bus boys were very funny, polite, and attentative. they noticed that i'm a spice whimp so they were constantly coming by to offer more water.  the bar area was also super nice and it would definitely be cool to come by during happy hour. this place was absolutely packed on a monday night too!",

Was able to be seated instantly at the bar area.  The interior is wonderful, bright lights, marble floors and a nice bar area for ordering drinks AND food.  The Indian food here is unique because it's not your typical curries and stews you would find at most Indian food places around. Here they serve Dosas and Uttapams which are like basically Indian savory crepes!  It was my first time eating it and I was sooo happy! Yum yum. We also got the Chennai Chicken (which is like an Indian version of Chinese popcorn chicken) and a Mango Lassi! Seriously, it was the CLASSIEST mango lassi I've ever had.....hands down.  Seriously, come here for classy Indian lunch/dinner that's out of your ordinary curries! You seriously won't be disappointed because the food is BOMB and reasonably priced!

I have tried the watermelon, panner and moong salad, vada, uttappam and panner dosa. All of them were really very tasty. Dosa is served with two different types of chutneys: coconut and tomato chutney and also with Sambar.   Its an upscale and elegant place. I could call it a fine dining probably. The food is very expensive compared to the same quality of food in south bay. However, I think the price is only for the location. Something to try when you are in the SF area.",

Fresh Seafood Vada (4.5 stars) - so fresh and light, with a great kick of spice. \u00a0  Chutney Sampler (4 stars) - All of the sauces were spectacular and full of flavor, with a range of spiciness. \u00a0All of them were great.  Sweet Potato Dosa (4.5 stars) - This was my favorite dosa of the evening. \u00a0The sweet potatoes were so soft and creamy, and I loved the ginger flavor.  Spicy Basil Dosa (3.5 stars) - This was in my opinion not as good as the sweet potato dosa. \u00a0 Still good, just didn't have the same creaminess, and I preferred the flavor profile of the other dosa better. \u00a0Wish we would have gotten the white truffle dosa instead of this one, as we've had that before and it's fantastic.  Tamil Lamb (4.5 stars) - Such an excellent dish. \u00a0Once again, great flavors/spices, and the lamb was oh so tender.  Prawn Masala (5 stars) - The best dish of the night. \u00a0The coconut sauce was to die for, and the prawns were perfectly cooked. \u00a0And the coconut rice that came with it was excellent - went back for thirds on this dish ;)  My personal favorites were the shredded duck starter and the prawn masala. \u00a0But honestly, every single dish was fantastic. \u00a0  A must go if you haven't been. \u00a0Can't wait to try out the DOSA on Valencia, which is a short walk from where I live. \u00a0The location on Valencia is more \"cozy\" and small whereas the one on Fillmore is more trendy and kind of an \"experience.\" \u00a0Both have their own charm - just depends on what you're feeling more in the mood for :)",

    "review_text": "I have read some of the bad reviews of this place and they should be ignored on the basis of their ignorance of indian food and the intense labor required to prepare.   This is the first place I have been to where I felt the price matched the quality of the food. This is expensive, but where are you going to go and find a upscale restaurant with high-end decor that offers traditional south indian food that is healthy.   I frequent Darbar in Palo Alto and that restaurant pales in comparison to DOSA. I have never been to a South Indian, or any Indian restaurant that serves healthy meals and uses organic or locally sourced ingredients and free-range meats.   DOSA is by far the best south indian restaurants I have visited because of how they prepare their dishes. Most places you go, the dosas are beyond greasy, the \"masala\" (spiced potato filling) is either bland or too spicy and lacks in complexity of flavors. DOSA makes their masala dosa's with your health in mind. The dosa I received was amazing, the filling was delicious and the chutney served along side the sambar was amazing.   Once thing to note: the sambar is super spicy, however, this is to be expected with south indian food. I had two bowls of it and wanted more, but my tongue was already on fire. This is not the restaurants fault, this is traditional south indian cooking at its finest. the only negative was that the sambar was a little heavy on the tamarind, though I didn't complain as I loved the gorgeous color. \u00a0  We also ordered the Kale Pakora (we ordered two rounds of it) and that was equally amazing.   The couple who started this restaurant knows what they are doing and understands their clientele. They know that San Franciscans appreciate fine dining and healthy cuisine. San Franciscans have a plethora of ethnic dining options and will frequent those that use ingredients found at DOSA.",

This place is a bit pricier, but it's honestly so worth the cost. It's not one of those places that charges $10 more for a burger just because they can. The food, decor and cocktails are noticeably high quality and delicious. It's for sure some of the best Indian food I've had.   Try the Mango Prawns (great sweet spicy combo) and any of the Dosas. The cocktails are also a huge bonus of dining at Dosa. Each one is completely original and delicious. My favorite is the Peony - a lavender and coconut milk flavored concoction. I've never had Indian dessert that I like except at Dosa - the gelatos are perfection. If you're brave, they even suggest forgoing silverware and going the traditional route of eating with your hands.   This is a prime date or special event spot. It's located right across the street from Sundance Kabuki Cinemas - my favorite theater in SF and a great spot to round out a traditional dinner and a movie date.",

Especially being unfamiliar with the food, it was nice to try a bit of everything. I ordered the chicories and Asian pear salad, the sweet potato dosa and the hyderabadi lamb.   The salad was okay, but not mind blowing. Although I could have eaten a whole bowl of the fried goat cheese balls they had in it! The sweet potatoes dosa was good. I know that this dish is supposed to be a lot of dough and a little bit of the main \"stuffing\" but I wanted a little bit more potatoes!   The lamb was awesome though! It was probably the right amount for a main dish, but it was so good I wanted more! And it came in this dish with a bunch of thick sauce. It just made me want more lamb! It was also so tender. I just love lamb, and they did this right!  A fresh modern atmosphere and great service made it a fantastic evening to catch up with coworkers!",

Spice Route cocktails feature some new world wonders-lime, curried nectar, allspice, mango juice, jackfruit! After one cocktail, you'll need the feast to come.  While variety may be the spice of life, the paper masala dosa is the bread and butter of Dosa-sans butter. I love how it looms menacingly off of the plate, and with each bite of crispy dosa, potato, lentil, and cashew it becomes somewhat more contained. Usually I'm full by the time it reaches the confines of the plate, but I keep on going because it is part of the journey.  To ensure that you have adequate provisions for the voyage ahead, you must order the South Indian Moons uttapam-five savory pancakes selected by the chef, accompanied by chutneys and sambar.  I've veered off my beaten path on a few occasions. The Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani is a basmati rice bowl of tender chicken with Indian aromatics, and the masala dosa is a triangular pocket of potatoes, onions, and cashews. Both worthy excursions from the uttapam-paper masala route that I've carved out for myself.  Even though Dosa Valenica is obtaining a liquor license soon, I think I'll voyage here more often. The interior is so beautiful, the space so expansive, and the location perfect for a pre or post-Kabuki theater meal.",

I tried the Masala Dosa and it was big enough to share among three people but the bf and I stuffed ourselves to finish it. We also had a little of the Paneer (not dosa but the thicker pancake kind) and that was good too. Since it's a thicker bread, it was more filling so we didn't end up finishing it. We also tasted these onion pieces dipped in a chickpea batter (forget the name, hehe) and they were reminiscent of the Awesome Blossom/Blooming Onion at Chili's and Outback.

The location on Valencia does not seem to offer these. Their masala dosa and accompanying sauces are divine. It is certainly enough for a meal, which is a bargain at $11. They are also vegan-friendly. Just make sure you ask them to leave off the ghee. Again, we found that the location on Valencia is less able to make vegan-friendly adaptations to the menu because they pre-cook some ingredients in butter.   Additionally, the cocktails are delicious. I like to order a gimlet when I go. With the swanky atmosphere and attentive service, I am compelled to leave five stars. I would probably give the location on Valencia three stars. \u00a0One tip: you almost always need a reservation, even on a weeknight.

Place is full of couples, families, and professionals. Hence great place for everyone. Big bar and great seating.  We had a wonderful waiter who took great care of us. Now let's discuss food:  - chennai chicken is so delicious! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Great pairing with the raita  - spicy basil dosa was great. Perfectly seasoned, huge portion. Highly recommended.  - lunch chicken thai was okay. Can subsitute one vegeterian plate with chicken but I didn't like the chicken dish. Some vegetarians options were not yummy but dal was amazing (probably best I've had) and the plain dosa was delicious and soft. The ras malai was great too. I wouldn't get the thali again because the other options on the menu look amazing.  - finished with the chai chocolate pot de creme and it was amazing!! Comes with three shortbread biscuits that were most delicious biscuits I have had. Creme was light and perfect.  Overall great place for good indian food (and I'm indian so that's saying a lot)",

We heard we had to go here so we listened, we cabbed it, we conquered.   Anxious to get started on some dosas, we skipped appetizers and dove right in to ordering our entrees. One thing I will say, the complimentary papadum served as we waited was perfectly crisp and I filled up a little bit too much on that alone. Delicious though -- some of the best papadum I've had.  My hubby and a friend indulged in some spicy cocktails and were definitely quite pleased.  Once our food arrived I knew I was going to like it. \u00a0I could smell the white truffle oil before the plate even reached me. I admit, my previous experiences with having dosa were all very traditional versions so I was very jazzed about the white truffle twist.  So yes, I loved. \u00a0My husband devoured his meal and as I watched the beads of sweat roll down the sides of his face, at the end of his cleaned plate, all he could talk about was the sambar he just had. Although it had a no-joke kick to it, he wanted more of it. \u00a0  I highly recommend Dosa on Fillmore to anyone interested in having delicious South Indian food with a twist. \u00a0  Dining in a fine establishment like this was a definite treat from the crappy, dingy and hit-or-miss Indian restaurants you'll find in Seattle - what a shame because we need something like this here!",

Remember to make a reservation, no matter how big your party! It got really crowded by 7pm on Friday night.  Drinks were pretty good. The others enjoyed their cocktails, while my monsoon was interesting at best - I did not like chucks of ginger going up the straw and the taste was too savory for me, not refreshing enough. Our nice waitress gave us advice on how many plates to share amongst the 4 of us. We split 2 appetizers and 3 dosas.  - Chennai chicken was delicious as everyone has pointed out. The only meat we had for the meal. Large portion too, great for sharing. - North/south samosas were decent, but not exactly worth the $9 for just two. - Dosas ($12-13) - white truffle, paper masala, and basil - each were humongous and the stuffing in the truffle and basil was not spread out enough. The edges of the dosas were basically just the crepe. As soon as we hit the middle, it tasted amazing though. None of them were bad. Overall table consensus was for the paper masala, enjoyed with the different dipping sauces.  Those dishes plus a few rounds of drinks came to about $40 per person with taxes. Not extremely bad for a classy dinner and an adventure trying new things. But for the everyday takeout of tikka masala and rice, go to a more affordable Indian joint.",

We sat down expecting to order from the RW menu, but we did not. It was $85 per person for 4 courses each. We ended up ordering 4 plates ala carte and walked out with food left over for $85 total.  The samosas (chicken and potatoes) were great. Probably the best I've ever had. The chicken filling was especially flavorful. The lamb keema dosa was also memorable. The dosa was crispy and light. Perfectly paired with the lamb.  The fianc\u00e9e was also feeling adventurous and ordered the chili uttapam. It's got Serranos, jalape\u00f1os, habaneros and Thai chilis. It was extremely spicy for me, but the heat and the flavor just left me going back for more. Make sure you get your water refilled often! The green coconut chutney helped cool it down as well.  My disappointment of the night was this chicken dish under the curry menu. Chicken chennai I think? The curry it came in was more like a gravy. Obvious cinnamon taste, but it's salty. My first impression was literally WTF. Salty, creamy, cinnamon-y taste. I did not have more than 2 bites of the uttapam that I dipped in this.

The noise level isn't too quiet but it's not loud like a bar either...perfect loungy atmosphere.  Ordered three dishes and shared them family style: chicken biryani, some lamb kofta and mango prawns. All were amazing. Coconut rice to go with the dishes and bhatura which I didn't know about but was an amazing bread dish. Drank a mango lassi and some type of beer/cider to wash it down. Ended on a perfect note with a dark chocolate cake.  Most Indian places are either 1. hole in the wall and good, 2. shady and gross, 3. a street cart or 4. Naan and Curry. It was nice to see an upscale Indian restaurant for a change (kind of like Typhoon in San Diego but even nicer). Definitely better than Gaylord.  The prices are a little on the higher side but you are paying for the ambiance. I think the quality of the food is also better but only marginally than some other good hole in the wall places (I'm thinking Chutneys here). Probably wouldn't come back regularly but definitely if I'm in the mood for some good Indian food and don't wanna make it down to the Tenderloin, will probably hit it up here.",

Well then somebody take me there dammit! \u00a0That is exactly what happened tonight. \u00a0Yes I'm in San Fran and there are thousands of Indian restaurants to choose from lucky for me I had some locals who knew the area well. \u00a0Remember at the beginning of this review how I said I didn't love Indian food? \u00a0Tonight was the night that I fell in love with Indian food. \u00a0It turns out I just really needed to experience Indian food the right way. \u00a0  Now I realize Dosa is more of a high end Indian restaurant. \u00a0The restaurant was beautifully decorated, two floors of amazing dining area with a modern look. The food was top notch and yes as a recommendation and well the name of the restaurant was Dosa after all so I went for the roasted chile and garlic masala dosa. \u00a0  So what is a dosa? \u00a0The menu describes it as a rice and lentil crepe. \u00a0 When it was served it was a large triangle crepe (it was huge) literally falling off the plate served with sambar, coconut and tomato chutneys. \u00a0The servers were all very educated on the menu and super helpful when it came to how to eat the food. \u00a0For an Indian food newbie I appreciate any help I can get. \u00a0The food was outstanding I ate every bite of my Dosa it was simple, spicy, and delicious. This will be a meal I won't ever forget.  Did I mention my cocktail? The \"peony?\" \u00a0There was quite a selection of specialty cocktails to choose from, almost all included ingredients made in house. \u00a0 The peony was nothing like I had before, gin with hibiscus masala nectar, coconut milk, lime, and birds eye chili. \u00a0The drink was a pretty purple concoction, creamy, spicy and served up in a martini glass, my kind of drink for sure.  I highly recommend checking this place out, the fact that I will make sure to visit here next time I'm in San Fran says a lot because we all know this city has a ton of options when it comes to food. \u00a0This non-Indian food lover has been converted.",

I was baffled because it was a miss on all levels - the food was not authentic, nor did it do a good job of bringing in a fusion element to the different items. In my opinion, everything I tasted just fell flat - no flavor, no element of surprise, no nothing, FLAT.  I'm a South Indian. I know the food. I ordered a pesarattu or the Spicy Mung Masala. What I got was not really a pesarattu, I make better pesarattu and I won't even pretend to be a good cook. Others on my table ordered:  Paneer &amp; Spinach dosa - \u00a0marginally better than everything else that we ordered, but still not on par with dosa I've had in other bay area establishments.   Okra Kolambu - no flavor, I was hoping for a nice coconut kick to the whole dish, but apparently it was too much to expect  Persimmons &amp; Iddiapam - we were warned that the dish was sweet, but we were intrigued by the usage of persimmons in an iddiapam preparation and wanted to try it out. Will not make the mistake again!  Overall, it was a very disappointing, uninspired and expensive meal ($73 + tax for 2 entrees and a drink, per couple). I don't think I'll ever go back.

I wanted to try a bunch of things so we decided maybe a la carte was the better choice. I love the standard chicken tikka masala, but I'm not very versed in Indian cuisine. We discussed various dishes with our server and ended up ordering the following:  -Chennai chicken ($11) - Yum! Crispy, moist and tender!  -Dahi vada ($10) - I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but it was a nice contrast to heavier and spicier dishes. Cool and refreshing.  -Lamb kofta ($15) - I love lamb! And in meatball form?! How could I say no! -Duck vindaloo with side of Lemon rice ($24) - I love duck! But since it's a fatty bird, I found the sauce a little too oily. The lemon rice went great with it though!  -Uttapam: Mixed chile ($11) - So I ordered a dosa but ended up with a uttapam. If I had realized this at the restaurant, I probably would have said something. But I didn't find out until I got home. I did enjoy this though! Nice and spicy!   Given that this restaurant is called Dosa, I really wanted to try a dosa! But since I'm not super familiar with Indian food, I didn't know what we got wasn't what I ordered.

Sadly, my body and muffin top just doesn't agree with the bold and fiery spices.  Knowing that we were going to Dosa, I came armored with my pink bff. You know how it is, the older you get, the more you become a walking CVS. Lactaid, tums, pepto, beano, aleve, benadryl, dramamine, emergen-c, etc. I even have preparation h. Puffy eyes, begone!  Having been to Dosa on Valencia, I already knew what to expect: trendy and full bar. Of course, the latter being the most important. This Dosa location is massive with two levels making it a perfect place for dates and/or large parties.   I'm no South Indian food aficionado so I can't speak for the authenticity but I will say, I didn't have the sweats or skid marks during/after (like I usually do from the spices). Not to say, the food was bland because it wasn't, it was flavorful without assaulting the tastebuds with spices and heat. It's pricey though for Indian food (we spent $80 pp including one cocktail) but the quality is top-notch with service to match.  Do start dinner with one of their unique, Indian inspired cocktails. Kinda pricey at $13 a pop but where in the hell will you find a cocktail with housemade hibiscus masala necter, coconut milk and birds eye chile? Um, no where. The creamy Peony (gin based) cocktail was damn delicious and stiff: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1BKakyU&amp;s=3b552f71dde6d6d0c2fafe093d0f5ae169320bf37ac92b0af5f02c3581473133\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1BKakyU</a> so I recommend this one.   Our group of 8 decided to order several apps to share and then go with the 3-course tasting menu for $42 (yah we eat a lot). This definitely the way to go as the average price of entrees was $26. They don't skimp on the portions either; the girls left with doggybags.   For our shared apps, we ordered the Bhatura ($5), a gigantic fried puffy wheat bread: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1to5x2j&amp;s=332039c43969e523aadf72c295a4ad33832a66ada1113e1824a8f8b111e16860\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1to5x2j</a> and the White Truffle Masala Dosa ($13.50): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1q12snB&amp;s=5598285112df78b70bb96a6a37771a7f11ec25d52b7ed7a9a321c6e3db001dd8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1q12snB</a>. Both are must trys! The Bhatura was crispy, soft, and airy; great for dipping with the chutneys. Not authentic by any means, the White Truffle Masala Dosa was filled with mash potatoes: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1muFQqP&amp;s=83b9087e7d01489a58c944eea2aed40582a46b0b75077e57d81518689f2d10f5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1muFQqP</a> and had a great earthy flavor.  For the tasting menu, I started with the Kale Pakora: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FXFmlGt&amp;s=d44bf273022cd6873db615b7047ef9175966247bf1d2b6ea4ebccad28d296ac7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/XFmlGt</a> which is kale dipped in a chickpea batter and then deep fried. It was a little too heavy for me so I shared it with our group.  For my second course, I choose the Lamb Keema Dosa: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1l0NhKY&amp;s=e29955cfdf880467d25603749bd019a2a39cc16cbb0f54c86d6bd9efd865c850\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1l0NhKY</a>. I really enjoyed this course; kinda like a deconstructed crepe. The paper thin dosa was super light and crunchy. Tear off a piece, top it with the ground lamb, and enjoy. The tomato chutney added heat while the green coconut chutney helped cool things down.   Having had the Prawn Masala at their Valencia location, I knew this was going to be my third course. It was as delicious as I remembered it. The four large prawns were meaty and sweet. Loved the delightfully creamy masala sauce that was robust and spicy but not overly so. They made for great leftovers since the spices developed more overnight.   The Indian fusion desserts looked too enticing to pass up so we ordered the White Chocolate &amp; Turmeric Pot de Cr\u00e8me ($9): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1l0QiLo&amp;s=0e41e291bb7e6cb392f6b050ca3717c6fcad0a82744ff57e6d8d4614367c61d9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1l0QiLo</a> and the Fresh Coconut Custard Cake w/ infused curry leaves &amp; coconut cookie ($8): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1tsqJ6o&amp;s=672c668c55f730c0ff92809a06ef717515865ab523ef73ab74e9594205ebbfa9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1tsqJ6o</a> to share. I can't comment on the pot de cr\u00e8me since someone hoarded the entire thing to himself. Hmmph. The coconut custard cake had a flan like texture. It had good coconut flavor but I wish the bottom crust was crunchier.   Service was phenomenal (so rounding up my rating). Our super sweet waitress, Ilem and the busboys rocked! Usually with large parties, service sucks donkey balls. However, not at Dosa. They were very attentive, quickly cleared out empty plates, kept our water glasses filled, and food came out very timely. When it came to packing our leftovers, they put the rice, masala and raita in different containers. The ocd in me thanks you!  As I mentioned earlier, Dosa is a very trendy place. The upscale d\u00e9cor is stunning and the amber and red color scheme is inviting. If you want to impress a girl (or guy) with something l-o-n-g, this is THE place to bring her. I'm talking about the dosa here, you pervs! ;)",

The owner reached out to me regarding my A-OK review and welcomed me to come back and try a few appetizers on him. I literally live 4 blocks away so my roommates and I stopped by here on Tuesday night for dinner.  Their dinner offerings were excellent. All the items provide very generous servings and they definitely kicked up the spice a notch with these dishes. We got the following:  Chaat -- Mangos in chaat? Who would have thought. Apparently this is a South Indian norm to put fruit in chaat and I don't know why us Northerners haven't picked up on how good that is. Dahi Vada -- Amazing presentation and great taste. They really know how to take Indian street food and make it classy Pakora -- To be fair, I'm not a fan of these generally so I have a bit of a bias against this dish. Clever take on the chutneys mimicking ketchup and mustard.  Paper Masala Dosa -- Solid traditional dosa dish. Ask for extra of the orange chutney. Nom. Basil Dosa -- 3/4 of us are Indian and have grown up with all this goodness. This dosa made all of us take a step back and admire how they made this. It's like pesto meets masala. Very good. Channa Batura -- Seriously, the batura was bigger than my head. INSANE. The channa was excellent. The batura was definitely a little oily for my liking but that tends to happen when its deep fried.  Needless to say, I definitely had my mind changed and cannot wait to make this a neighborhood regular. Cheers to your restaurant, Anjan.",

The slap in the face was that the waitstaff there enjoying themselves and never had the decency to cater to their customers. We are locals, and I can't say I have ever been treated so poorly. These people have such a bad attitude. We chose to leave before we \"inconvenienced\" anyone to pay an ounce of attention. IMO the only thing Indian about this restaurant is their rude waitstaff.  From a previous experience, everything here was too salty, but entr\u00e9es were over the top salty and otherwise over seasoned and cooked for the wrong amount of time. Without the hype, I think their food still deserves 2 stars but because I hate hyped up places that can't deliver to the amped up expectations, and with a complete lack of customer service, Dosa's only receiving a single star, and that's only because Yelp wouldn't let me do anything less.",

The Chennai chicken was tasty and came out in a fairly large sized portion for a small plate. \u00a0The chicken was fried and had a slight spiciness to it that gave it a nice little kick. \u00a0It came with a side of yogurt sauce, raw onions, and a lemon that added some nice additional flavor to the dish. \u00a0I thought it was a solid appetizer.  The lamb dosa was ok and not anything amazing. \u00a0It came out with a bowl of sambar, cup of coconut chutney, cup of tomato chutney, and a bowl of lamb. \u00a0The dosa was perfectly made, but the sambar and chutneys were not particularly flavorful / spicy and the lamb had the taste and consistency of a bowl of chili. \u00a0I was not impressed by the dish and it may be that I should've ordered another dosa.  Overall, I really liked the environment of this place and would come here to lounge at the bar, but I wasn't particularly impressed by the food. \u00a0I found it very overpriced for the quality of what you received... but then I've never thought of dosas capable of being fancy.",

I can only imagine waiting on our table of many-a-loudmouth to be a bit like herding cats, so my hat is off to you, bespectacled gent with great taste in cocktails. Sadly, I forget your name. Happily, I have not forgotten anything about the food.   We all opted for the three-course tasting menu, so I was able to pinch off of my neighbors plates to get a better sampling. It all started with a fabulous Chicory and Pear Salad: so fresh, so bright, so thoughtfully put together and then dressed with the single most delicious cilantro dressing I've ever had. I also nipped a bit of the shredded duck which was rich and decadent and totally special. However, my next course was the absolute stand-out: Winter Uttapam with caramelized fennel, sun-dried tomatoes and a smattering of root veg. The star was the actual pancake -- dense without being doughy and subtly flavorful.   Where I ran into a bit of trouble was course #3, the Chicken Xacuti. Now, I like spice. I like spice this side of hot. I can throw back, seriously. This, however, was the kind of snot-inducing, drool-triggering, heartburn-churning heat that my wee Scottish stomach is just not built for. I silently suffered until I saw my colleagues around the table fanning the flames, as well. However, if you are a scoville scholar and enthusiast, this is the dish for you.   Another component worthy of noting: the drinks! I stuck with my favorite, a bourbon Old Fashioned but several of my fellows wadded into the creative cocktail pool and all were delicious and refreshing. They're quite unique, so this is where your server will come in handy -- just ask and (if you're as lucky as we were) you'll be perfectly paired with a terrific tipple.",

My bf and I found ourselves by Dosa on Fillmore today and decided to give it a whirl because we really enjoyed Dosa on Valencia.   First off, hellllo SPACE! I have never been inside Dosa on Valencia and it makes Dosa on Fillmore feel and look like a walk-in closet. Whereas Dosa on Valencia is dim, intimate, and cozy, Dosa on Fillmore has soaring ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, and light, light, light! Add to this, a beautifully decorated interior to enjoy a Sunny SF day in the Fillmore.  We started the meal with complimentary fried crisps/chips with fennel seeds. I'm not sure what they were, but I would liken them to some kind of Indian \"tortilla chip\" but much thinner and lighter. Yum! I wanted another bowl!  We split a Prawn \"Frankie\" (spiced sauce, marinated onions, cucumbers &amp; cilantro chutney wrapped in Roti, w egg-white brush) and a Spicy Mung Masala Dosa (mung lentil dosa with green chiles and spiced potatoes). The server noted these items were SPICY!   And SPICY they were....but enjoyably so, allowing the complex flavors of the entrees to still sign through. The Prawn Frankie was similar to an Indian \"burrito\" (Curry Up Now lovers, rejoice!). Juicy prawns in a red fiery sauce wrapped up in a soft roti wrapper.   The Spicy Mung Masala Dosa was also very tasty. The earthiness of the mung dosa was a tasty vehicle to enjoy the savory spiced potatoes and spicy chiles inside. I enjoyed experimenting with the tomato, fresh coconut chutney, and sambar (lentil dipping soup made with vegetables). I tried the Paper Masala (a thin, crispy, pliable dosa) at the Valencia location and prefer that because I like more texture in my food, but this was still very good.   Spent about $30 for 2 people, including tip.",

The ONE drawback was the amount of salt they used in their food -- must have been shoveled in... X____X. \u00a0Hopefully it was just an off night.  I ordered: --Lotus Steam Day Boat Scallops ($12) -- highly recommended. \u00a04 big and perfectly seared scallops served w/ crispy chips of lotus stem (for anyone that doesn't know what that is, its the starchy root that grows under water, beneath lotus flowers) --Duck Vindaloo w/ Coconut Rice ($19, +$3 for rice) -- pretty darn spicy but meat is very tender and super flavorful. --South Indian Moons Uttapam ($13.5) -- good sampler of 5 uttapams, super soft and thick savory pancakes. \u00a0It wasn't mind blowing and \u00a0I'll probably go w/ the dosa next time (crispy and thin), but glad to have tried it.  We came with a big group for a birthday dinner -- worked out so well. \u00a0Open Table made it easy to reserve, we had a booth that was both private and comfy, delicious drinks made toasting a blast, and Dosa even coordinated a special birthday dessert for the bday girl at the end. \u00a0Thanks, Dosa!",

    "review_text": "For those unfamiliar with Indian food: I pity you when coming here for the first time. For those unfamiliar with SOUTH Indian food, you've got a fighting chance to enjoy the full potential of this incredible restaurant, but it might be a struggle.   I've never experienced an effort at South Indian cuisine like this outside of India, in my life. To be clear, the menu is obviously designed to minimize the damage from being a Southern restaurant in a society that is really only familiar with Northern, and that is, Punjabi, mom and pops named some variation of Delhi, Taj, India, or Gandhi. Cultured Americans know naan and chicken tikka masala. But even they tend not to know idli and sambar. So, there are plenty of northern stand-bys on the menu when you first open it. You actually have to dig deep into the third page before the South Indian dosa offerings come up. The less adventurous will have plenty of familiar entrees to choose from.  And that's too bad. A couple seated next to us were quite obviously confused when they got their menus. The poor things asked some silly question of the waitress, who politely tried to explain to them that there are no tandoori ovens at South Indian restaurants, which is why there was no naan. They then opted to order the one thing that they figured looked and tasted most like naan: bhatura (a North Indian bread). The world of dosas would remain untouched by them.  There are so many stunningly delicious variations of amazing Indian recipes on this menu that I almost want to fly out to San Francisco again just for the sake of sampling more. This is only my second time at Dosa. Here's to the next time.",

By the time we got started on the first dishes (once we finally got drinks) everything else started coming out all at once and they just dropped dishes all over, barely attempting to bus anything.   Like I said food was very good but not worth the mediocre service. I'd like to give it another shot -- maybe I need to go on a Tuesday at like 6 pm when they aren't busy?

There is no question this is a terrific local restaurant, and gets booked up quickly on weekends.",

That said, the food didn't quite match my expectations. My date and I ordered the Chennai Chicken, the Green Mango &amp; Paneer Dosa, and the South Indian Moons Uttapam. The chicken was pretty good, albeit spicier than I'd have liked (although I'm a wimp about that). The dosa was alright, but neither my date nor I could taste the mango. In fact, I thought the whole thing was on the bland side, without any flavors that stood out. The uttapam, which came with a variety of different kinds, wasn't much better. Maybe my taste buds were dying from the spicy chicken, but I was expecting something a bit more memorable.",

Not really the reaction you want on a Friday evening out!  The biggest issue I had was the price - it seemed to be quite expensive compared to other Indian restaurants. \u00a0As a last note, there were six of us seated at a table, and there was barely enough room for us. \u00a0We were squeezed in so tight that it wasn't totally comfortable to hang out for a couple hours. \u00a0I would rate this place as just okay.",

    "review_text": "My boyfriend is south Indian, my best friend is Indian, and her date is British/ Sri Lankan. When all three of them love the food, you know it's legit. (I kinda knew it before. This just confirms it)  And SO affordable (it was my friend's birthday and with 3 of us covering dinner for 4, it came out to only $27 before tax)! Plus the service is great, the upstairs is a little more private and there are a few on the wait staff always keeping an eye on the tables and making sure the water is filled, your questions are answered, etc.   Last time I came I got cocktails as well and they were delicious. This time we got:  * Vada Pav - 4 stars Spiced-potato patty, chutneys, caramelized onions &amp; \"gunpowder\"- ground chiles &amp; lentils (1 for $6, 2 for $10) Really well done, really spicy, and apparently its rare in Indian-American restaurants for them to split the \"gunpowder\" chile and ghee and let you mix them to your liking. The potato patty was fantastic, but the bread, while it had a good buttery subtle crunch, was just a tiny bit on the stale side (only reason this wasn't 5 stars).  * Channa Bhatura - 5 stars Chickpea (garbanzo) masala served with an oversized, soft, puffy wheat bread or vegan poori ($15) Love getting this at a table. The bread is the size of a pillow and always impressive when its brought to the table. The chickpeas are cooked to PERFECTION, any less and they would've been too hard, any more and they would've been too starchy. Strong and wonderful flavor as well.  * Uttapam - 4 stars (Slightly thicker, pancake-style variation of the Dosa. Each Uttapam is also served with fresh fresh coconut &amp; tomato chutneys \u00a0coconut &amp; tomato chutneys and \u00a0sambar \u00a0sambar) Topped with onion, tomatoes &amp; green chiles ($11.5) Really liked the tomato &amp; onion one - the tomato gives it a nice tangy kick. The pancake, while soft and spongy and delicious, is just a little bit on the oily side though.  * Dosa - 5 stars (Savory rice and lentil crepe, all served with fresh served with fresh coconut \u00a0coconut &amp; tomato chutneys \u00a0tomato chutneys and sambar sambar, a flavorful lentil dipping soup made with vegetables and spices. Masala described below is a traditional filling of spiced mashed potatoes) * Spicy basil - Masala dosa with a chutney of fresh basil, cashew nuts, ginger, shallots, curry leaves &amp; chiles ($12) * Spicy mung masala - Mung lentil dosa ('pesarattu') \u00a0with green chiles, chopped onions, cilantro and spiced potatoes ($12) Both the spicy basil and mung were amazing. As thin as the dosa is, it still manages to have a soft interior with a slight crunch to the outside. The masala is great as always, and the basil wasn't too overpowering (we were afraid it would taste too Italian).  * Rasmalai - 5 stars Sweet cheese patties, cream, cardamom, rose water ($6) Love everything, from the toasted pistachio crumbles to the cardamom infused rose water to the chewy cheese patties.",

We started with the Idli Fries which were unique. \u00a0The outside texture starts off like any ole steak fry but the inside is soft and crumbly like rice. \u00a0Very intesting and tasty. \u00a0 Nearly at the same time the FIVE Moons came (South Indian Moons). \u00a0They are 5 small vegetable pancakes with 3 dipping sauces and seemingly ginormous one...or maybe it is a chili soup? \u00a0The dipping sauces were not that fantastic but perhaps more for the subtle palate.  Our mains were the duck vindaloo which is their spiciest curry (AND IT IS!) and masala. \u00a0The duck was tender and good quality though I felt the extreme spiciness of the curry left my palate burning and wondering if the duck was good. \u00a0You're probably saying I'm stupid for saying such things. \u00a0Perhaps so. \u00a0Anyways, I did still like the dish. \u00a0Probably would've gone better with their recommendation of rice instead of uttapam. \u00a0The 2nd main was masala...an super-sized pancake folded in half with a filling that tastes like the inside of a samosa. \u00a0After the 5 moons, my utappam, and now this huge pancake...I was pretty much carbed-OUT! \u00a0Ever bread item seemed to taste the same. \u00a0The filling was good but I had had enough of the breads....We were full.  As you see my ignorance of the cuisine has subverted a probably very fun time. \u00a0It's a great looking restaurant. \u00a0And I'm sure if we ordered a more diverse assortment the experience could be better next time. \u00a0Hopefully, the server could be more helpful in this regard and stop us from doing that next time.",

    "review_text": "Wow. I've never eaten Indian food like this before. We went here for my birthday dinner, on our one day visit in San Fran. The decor is fun and fancy, with gorgeous orange textures and flowing flowery chandeliers dripping down from the twenty foot high ceilings, which were delightfully sparkly when the sun went down to showcase the fiber optic light display from said chandeliers. So cool.  The menu was intimidating for me. I'm used to northern Indian food (or southern?) and this is the opposite - no naan (sniff!) but the poori and bhatura were effing amazing and I didn't miss the naan at all. We all could have made a meal out of those alone, but I'm glad we held out because what followed proved to be an unbelievable romp for our taste buds. I would have had to study and agonize over the strange offerings for a long time had it not been for our absolutely delightful and very helpful waitress, Marlece. she walked us through her faves on the menu (with exclamations like \"jiminy crickets, the lamb!!) and explained everything for us and made recommendations for the best selections for our first Dosa experience. She was fantastic, kudos to the restaurant for nabbing her, she's a gem.  Our dining experience:  Kale pakora- fun, battered fried kale chips, essentially. Good, but I wouldn't bother again... Save room for the rest. Chennai chicken. Holy moly. Intense flavor, packs some serious heat. Delicious, but it couldn't eat to many. Best shared with others - Everyone loved \u00a0them. Samosas - one from the north, one from the south. One packed a bit more heat than the other but both were reliably delicious.  Prawn masala - I don't do seafood, but the guys at the table politely fought over the last bites of that, so I suppose it was a hit. I did eat some of the coconut rice that came with it, and it was yummy. Green mango and paneer dosa - Hands down the winner of the meal. Sooooooooooo delicious and sweet and tangy with awesome texture. It's served like a crepe. And oh so good. Masala dosa - the classic, as Marlece put it - a must for the first timer. Potatoey goodness in a huge crepe like thing with three delicious sauces to dip into... Lentil soup was my fave. Lamp chops - apparently marinated in yogurt, these fell off the bone into the mouth, packed a fair amount of heat with immense flavor. Definitely a memorable and awesome dish... I was so full at that point, but kept at it, and it was worth it and then some!  Dessert was banana chocolate gelato yummmmmmmm and homemade chai, better than any chai I've ever tasted (full disclosure, I've never been to India, but Marlece said the chefs make this for themselves to drink. Such an awesome treat, although all other chais will probably pale in comparison, and so perhaps this one ruined my chai habit... Time will tell) (I should also say, the caffeine in the \u00a0chai kicked my food coma in the arse and now here I am, writing this epic review, so perhaps not the best choice for after dinner??)  I loved this place. I'll be back someday, on some future visit to the area. Thanks to Marlece and everything about Dosa for capping off a lovely and memorable birthday!",

    "review_text": "There are no shortage of Indian restaurants in the bay area but Southern Indian food is surprisingly different to find. Whoever came up with the business idea to bring the staple southern Indian fare to such a trendy spot is just pure ingenious. DOSA is truly one of a kind in the city (not counting its sister restaurant Dosa on Valencia of course).  The restaurant is huge. There is a spacious bar, communal tables, lounging area as well as plenty of tables in two floors. Even then, the restaurant is a complete full house on the weekends. Reservation is not too too difficult to come by. Just need to call a few days in advance. Walk in or same day reservation might be possible but do not count on it. You don't want to wait for 45 minutes do you?  The food was good. Very authentic in taste with much welcomed Californian twist featuring many locally sourced, farm fresh or organic ingredients. I can't say it was the best Southern Indian food I have had in the area. I could still name a handful of restaurants that would beat them in taste and price. However, none of those restaurants match this level of service and quality. You are paying extra for the service, excellent wine list and a nice ambiance. Let me tell you, it is totally worth it.   The tasting menu is great for first timers. The portion is adjusted smaller so you get to try more things. Otherwise, just one order of their dosa could easily fill you up.  I love the energetic ambiance but the tables were a little too close together for comfort. It is a fun place to bring your date to but not a place you could enjoy a more intimate and private conversation.",

Let me start off with what I liked, the ambience is good, the place is huge and tables are setup with people's privacy in mind unlike most other indian restaurants where they put tables really close just to maximize profits, this is where the good part ends!.

Now, let's talk about the food, if you are brave enough to name your restaurant Dosa, you got to make sure that your Dosas are absolutely the best especially if you are going to charge $15 to $20 for a Dosa. I am absolutely cool with paying that kind of money if the quality and taste is up-to the mark, sadly it isn't. I and my friend ordered the Mysore Masala Dosa, these types of Dosa are suppose to be bit thicker, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, it was thin and soggy, it was horrible, I can get better dosa for less than half the price in south bay!. The chutneys were not made fresh and quantity was tiny, Dosas are eaten with a lot of chutney, this place needs to double or triple the quantity of chutney they serve. If you have never had Dosas before, you can try this place, if you know what good Dosas should taste like, avoid this place, save your money and pick any hole in the wall south indian restaurant, you will be more satisfied!.",

    "review_text": "We came in on a Saturday afternoon with a 1:45 reservation. We were there 1:42 and were told to wait and we waited until well past 2pm to be seated. Bad start. The place looks decent, nice a big, but the seating is squished into a smaller section of the large room and hence is quite congested. The tables are quite close to each other and we could eat right off the plate of our neighbor if we wanted to.   Now granted this is not rare and there are several places with space constraints, but not Dosa, they have a huge area in the center going completely waste. They could've easily spaced the tables out more and made things a bit more comfortable.  We placed our order for 1 Vada pav (clearly stated one, not two), a Thali and dosas.   The Dosa's looked decent enough, price is a bit high, sambar was flavorful but lacked body, chutney was \"okay\" have had better more innovative ones. The Masala was completely devoid of any flavor at all, its just a huge pile of BIG chunks of boiled potatoes. This is not how its done, a good dosa masala has smaller chunks, green chillies and a lovely hint of spices and heat, with ginger giving a finishing kick.   Onto the veggie thali, This one is a complete head scratcher. It comes with one small cup of rice (this makes no sense whatsoever, rice is the core ingredient in a thali that holds the whole thing together, in India, the rice is not even served on the plate so as to not fill up the plate, its either on the side on a large bowl or served seperately by someone who will give you as much as you want!)  The combination of dishes on the thali made no sense either. There was one idly (again makes no sense, not only is Idly usually not served in a thali, no one gives ONE idly, its practically unheard of). One uthapam which was decent tasting, but then there was what appeared to be a Veg Kurma which wouldnt go with anything on the plate.   Then a really odd tasting Pineapple Pachadi (Pineapple with Yogurt based sauce) which was really absurd tasting and one vegetable, yogurt, sambar and a sweet. All small quanitities, which is sort of ok but badly thought out. Its quite clear the person has possibly never had a Thali in a South Indian restaurant before. You have a certain order in which you eat \u00a0a Thali, and hence the dishes are all laid out in a logical manner to accompany the base items (Roti, dosa, rice) and you move along one after the other until you complete all dishes and end with the dessert, instead here we were left with hardly enough to make sense and unsatisfied.  We got our appetizer midway through eating our dishes and were given 2 Vada pavs instead of 1. This was actually quite tasty, but had way too much grease from butter/ghee and hence hardly qualifies as an appetizer IMO, especially if its served after main course!  Overall, its really nice to see someone bring South Indian cuisine with a fine dining approach, and while the namesake Dosa is decent, the core taste, culture and tradition seems to be lost. Sure modern day Restaurants requires everyone to come up with creative dishes to stand out and make an impact, but you need to get the basics right and the core concepts and ideals correct and then improvise on top. Clearly this person is filling a niche and taking advantage of pricing the cuisine beyond anywhere its been, but not quite comprehending the core cuisine.  Price : 1/5 Ambience : 2/5 Food : 2/5 Service : 2/5  Overall 2/5",

We made reservations for 5:30 on a Sunday. The place wasn't poppin' when we got there, but it was definitely crowded when we left.  Between three of us, we shared:  White truffle dosa - 5 stars- delicious. Comes with three amazing sauces, each unique in flavor.  Lentil dumpling - 3 stars - was confused with this dish. It's a lentil dumpling covered with yogurt and other sauces. I was expecting something else, but this was definitely an interesting dish. The yogurt was cooling, and perfectly offset the spicy flavors of our other appetizer.  Grilled calamari - 4 stars - came drenched in a sweet/spicy sauce. Delicious grilled flavor!!  Vegetable curry - 4 stars - it was recommended that this be eaten with coconut rice. The rice wasn't as coconutty as I liked, but I definitely appreciated the variety of vegetables that came immersed in the curry. Taro, cauliflower, potato, carrots... and more. Yum!!  Definitely would come back to Dosa, if not to have a meal, then at least to grab a few drinks and share a Dosa with a friend.",

    "review_text": "A friend chose this location for his birthday dinner. We were able to get a reservation at 6pm on Saturday night for a party of 8. Even though we arrived 15-20 mins. early, the staff was very welcoming and they were able to accommodate us. We were seated even before our entire party arrived.   Dosas are delish here! I'm used to eating sweet crepes for more of a dessert-like snack, but Dosa on Fillmore proved that I can happily enjoy a savory crepe for a dinner entree as well. This was my first time trying dosa of any type (I should really expand beyond curries and naan for Indian fare) and I was very pleased.   {food}  For a seasonal fall flavor, I say go with the PUMPKIN MASALA DOSA. The pumpkin masala with ginger and cinnamon created a really unique taste that you don't usually get with Indian food. Even my Indian friends were intrigued and impressed with my dish. I like how it came with an extra side of pumpkin chutney along with the sambar (lentil soup) and tomato and coconut chutneys. With the Bay Area weather turning a bit crisp and chilly outside, the spicy soup and warm dosa made for a very satisfying dinner. And the description of the portion as \"the size of a large plate\" is a bit of an understatement...I am pretty sure the dosa was the size of my face.   The UTTAPAMS were also yummy and a couple of my friends chose the SOUTH INDIAN MOONS to get a selection of five different flavors to try. The texture was similar to potato latkes. I personally prefer the thinner, crepe-like consistency of the dosas.   {drinks}  All the SPICE ROUTE COCKTAILS are pretty tasty. They are on the smaller side but they pack a nice punch. I've been in a tequila and spicy cocktail kick recently and went with the HIDEAWAY (the tequila, ginger, spiced agave, and birds eye chile caught my eye). I am still a fan of sweeter cocktails and also enjoyed my friend's MANGO IS THE NEW BLACK (rye whisky and spiced mango nectar made a great combo).   {dessert}  I loved the soft vermicelli noodles and beets swimming in condensed milk in the PAYASAM &amp; RED BEET HALAWA. It was a light dessert and reminded me of sweet dessert soups you find in Chinese restaurants. The RASMALAI was also a light dessert with cheese in a cream sauce flavored with spices and rose water. I preferred the sweeter flavor of the Payasam. Both desserts were quite large and we split them between our party of 8.  Things to note: - You can take the 38 or 38L from Geary/Powell if you're downtown - If you're coming with 2-3 other ppl, I would take Uber or Lyft to save time and avoid the crowded buses - Close proximity to Japantown if you want some daytime activities before/after eating  I would definitely come back again if I'm in the Japantown area!",

We had the chutney sample, spicy basil dosa, pumpkin masala dosa and fall vegetable curry with coconut rice! YUM!

    "review_text": "Here's a game for you to play if you find yourself eating here. Attempt to have everyone at your table get an empty glass of water for more than 2 minutes. I have never eaten at a place that refilled water with a such a religious fervor. Water was refilled with an urgency that made me suspect my glass would explode if it was left empty for even 5 minutes. Anyway, on to the important things. Dosa is potentially the hippest restaurant I've ever dined at. The dim lighting and the night lounge like decor made me realize that I've been dining like a 40 year old. It's a nice place to bring your 20 or 30 something year old friends, but not such a great place to bring your grandparents unless you're also going to bring a flashlight so they can read the menu. \u00a0I made a reservation for Friday night, and when we showed up, our table wasn't ready. I think reservations should be thought of as granting a shorter wait time rather than no wait time here. It wasn't too bad though. We were seated ten minutes later. People without reservations waited about an hour.   We chose items off of the dine about town menu. To start off, we had the chicken chennai and the coconut seafood soup. Both were amazing, but the soup was better. It was full of humongous scallops, prawns, mussels, fish and squid cooked in a delicious coconut milk broth. I'm not normally much of a seafood person, but this was fantastic. The dosas came next. Between the green mango and paneer and the truffle masala, the truffle was better. If I came back though, I'd probably skip on the dosas altogether. They were good, but not worth paying full price for. I'm not sure if it was because the dine about town menu had smaller portions or because this is their normal ratio, but my dosa was about 25% filling, and 75% just empty wrapper. The soup that came with them was too salty and spicy for me to finish. For our last course, we had the hyderabadi lamb and the prawn masala. Both were delicious. This course was a tie. Lamb was tender, prawns tasted fresh. You wouldn't go wrong picking either one.   I did take a peek at the full price menu. Entrees here run between $20-$35. They also do validate parking if you park in the Japantown garage. Validation should give you free parking and not just parking at a reduced rate.",

The paper dosa is on the 7x7 list, and it's humongous, but I wasn't a huge fan of it.

I got the paneer dosa last time I was here, and the peas in the paneer dosa were clearly frozen before serving (and some were still a little cold) yuck - and the dosa just didn't have that fresh, amazing flavor it should. The sambar was mediocre (not much flavor) and the chutney was RIDICULOUSLY spicy. whaat?!  The chicken curry - ok THAT was as good as my dad makes it (and that's saying something). SO SO SO good. perfect amount of spice, they didn't skimp on the chicken and didn't load it down with cream. SUCH good flavor.   The drinks - as usual, SO good. I got the Manhattan and my compadre got a white wine recommended by our waiter. she was happy with her wine and I was THRILLED with my Manhattan (sidenote: they put some vanilla something or other in it so it also SMELLED deliciouuuss).   Also, we had to be in and out in 45 minutes to catch a movie and they were VERY accommodating of that, so that was definitely appreciated.

Once seated and greeted, we were given delicious Papadam (lentil chips), which I happily munched on while my sister ordered for us. For our party of four, we settled on a family style selection of the Channa Bhatura, Spicy Mung Masala Dosa, Chicken &amp; Eggplant 'Baingan Bharta', and the Kerala Fish Moilee.  First, let's talk about how amazingly delicious and fun the Channa Bhatura was. Perfectly seasoned and tender chickpeas that are scooped up with pieces of lightly fried and puffy wheat bread (bhatura). And the most fun thing? The Bhatura comes served like a balloon ready to be punctured and used as a utensil. DEE-LISH and ENTERTAINING? that's a Nguyen-Win Situation to me :)  The Spicy Mung Masala Dosa brought back many memories for me as I constantly ordered Dosas in Chennai. This particular dosa was not only stuffed with mung beans but also with potatoes and cilantro-quite possibly two of my favorite things. All Dosas here are served with three types of \"dipping sauces\": coconut chutney, tomato chutney and sambar. As a Condiment Monster, this was also a Nguyen-Win Situation for me :)  Our two main entrees were also scrumptious-though I did prefer the aforementioned two items. The Kerala Halibut Moilee was extremely tender, moist and paired so well with the velvety coconut sauce. The Baingan Bharta was indeed succulent and earthy.  And although we were way too stuffed for any dessert (shocking, I know), we did indulge in a few cocktails.  Our dining experience was extremely enjoyable and I would HIGHLY recommend Dosa on Fillmore \u00a0to anyone interested in Indian cuisine. True, although many dishes have been slightly modified from their original state to compliment San Francisco, you will be hard pressed to find a spot that serves such high quality, South Indian inspired cuisine.   4.5 Stars",

    "review_text": "AUTHENTIC AND GOURMET: Sometimes to find authentic cuisine, you have to sacrifice atmosphere and go to hole in the wall. But at Dosa, they manage to serve delicious, authentic South Indian food in a top-rate upscale environment! The food, service, atmosphere, are all excellent. Also, they try to use organic and local ingredients where possible.  INSIDE: I prefer this to the other Dosa location. Located in a smaller space, it's a little more intimate feeling. The tables are spaced close together, but that can be forgiven.  FOOD: Free papadum appetizer - order the chutney sampler to make it more interesting. The masala dosa is a staple and a must try. They have a number of small plates, like \"north and south samosas,\" as well as great entrees like mango prawns. At lunch, try the Thali for a sampling of different items (although some of the offerings are an acquired taste). Check out the drink list for elaborate and pricey cocktails. They now offer interesting egg dishes for brunch. I recommend going family style, and having a feast!",

    "review_text": "4.5 STARS!!!   My boyfriend took me to Japantown and I immediately thought that we were going to be eating sushi but instead he took me to Dosa. The restaurant itself is beautiful. I fell in love with all the decorations. Very elegant looking to me.   Our waiter was friendly (can't remember his name) and gave us recommendations since it was our first time there. He was very knowledgable of the menu and was helpful. The waiter gave us this complementary snack before ordering and it was a great way to start the meal. I wish I knew what it was called, but I think it's some type of Indian chip or maybe bread?   I ordered the chicken xacuti and the mango lassi. My boyfriend ordered the lamb dosa. The chicken xacuti is a curry dish and it was DELICIOUS. The sauce was spicy but not too overwhelming. It's served with coconut rice which is a good complement. As for the mango lassi (yogurt based smoothie), I thought it was average. It was not as sweet as the other mango lassi that I've had in the past. The lamb dosa was delicious as well and it wasn't as heavy of a meal compared to the chicken xacuti. The staff are very quick in regards to refilling water glasses or responding to customers' questions/requests.   Reason why this place is 4.5 stars instead of 5: Despite the flavorful amazing food, I thought the pricing could have been maybe 2-3 dollars cheaper (at least during lunch time). Also, I thought $5 for a mango lassi was overpriced. I'm used to paying $3 at other indian restaurants.   Anyway, if you are in the Japantown area and don't have a particular craving for sushi TRY DOSA. The restaurant is gorgeous. The staff are friendly. The food (although overpriced) is flavorful and packed with a lot of spices. Go out and try it!   I will definitely be coming back to DOSA in the future (and bringing friends/family to try it).",

Apparently this has been their go-to place for Indian cuisine and it just so happened to be the last day for Dine About Town! Lucky us!  _what I ordered: - Kale Pakora:: I'm not the biggest fan of kale but this salad tasted fresh with subtle flavors. It was light and delicious.  - Lamb 'Keema' Dosa:: I have never had dosa before but I LOVE it! It was served with (3) different condiments varying on the spectrum of spice: coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and sambar. I believe that is the order from mildest to spiciest. If you are sensitive to spiciness, ask for the spiel on each (there is one gentleman that does an exquisite job at explaining it; it's theatrical!). - Chicken Xacuti:: the chicken would literally fall off of the bone. it was perfect.  _atmosphere/service: This is a very elegant, nice sit-down restaurant. The interior was very clean with very high ceilings and large-scale art to add to the ambiance.  _parking: There's a parking structure adjacent to the restaurant. I'm not sure what the rates are because my friend covered it (thanks, Alex!).",

Set in soothing amber tone, airy vaulted ceiling, well coordinated arty objects and most importantly, comfortable seats, you can expect fine dining experience, here.

Kerala Fish Moilee, a block of moist white (sorry forgot what kind) fish topped with sweet, spicy, fragrant coriander sauce accompanied by fluffy coconut rice was our favorite. \u00a0So was the huge triangle of Dosa Masala, such comfort food.  2 cocktails, 1 beer, 1 wine, 2 appetizers, 1 Dosa, 1 Entree + tax/gratuities = $150  Dosa is one of the establishments which can integrate culinary authenticity and local supplies.

But we ended up at the wrong branch since that's available only at Dosa on Valencia.  We'd already had a tough time getting a parking spot on Fillmore so we stayed back to eat at this one instead.   A few of us were apprehensive about eating here considering the Indo-Americanized food and it's steep prices but sat down nevertheless. Ordered vada pav, masala dosa, spicy basil masala dosa, spicy moong dosa and uttappam.   Vada pav was delicious!  Masala dosa was very tasty too. The potato curry and coconut chutney were top notch, whereas the sambar and tomato chutney were not.  Uttappam was served in small portions which looked weird and apparently tasted odd too.  Spicy basil masala dosa was not as spicy.  Moong dosa was okay-ish.   For dessert and later, we had rasmali and masala chai.  The chai was pathetic - nowhere close to Indian chai.  Rasmali was super creamy and delicious.   Definitely worth coming back.",

The staff were really nice about explaining how to eat it, as I have not been to Dosa in years (I'm going to say...like, 6 years now?). Always fun to eat with your hands (mostly) though!  The 2 items were just enough for us. We saw the curries were a bit pricey, and we weren't too hungry so just went with these 2 items. It ended up to be perfect for how hungry we were.   The staff were very friendly, and were attentive without being too overbearing. My water was never more than 1/2 empty, and they were quick about picking up any empty plates. Food was good, and overall a great experience! It IS a little pricey for Indian food, but for the price and the environment, its not a bad deal.",

(Perhaps imaginary guests?). \u00a0There was one family she seated but why would it take 10 minutes \u00a0get us settled at a table when here was no one else in the waiting area? \u00a0It started out the evening on a bad note and was so avoidable. \u00a0She could have said \"welcome to Dosa! I will get you seated in just one moment\" \u00a0(10 minutes to sit on a bench while she organized menus?! Please!  As for the food, we ordered two purple cauliflower soups that said the ingredients were cauliflower, fennel, shallot, coconut milk and curry leaves. \u00a0There were no indication on the menu that it would be spicy. \u00a0However, it tasted like hot chili peppers and nothing else. \u00a0They didn't mention that there was even chili In the soup. \u00a0I send mine back but my husband was hungry and kept eating his but was mad at himself for doing so. \u00a0  The spicy mung bean salad was good. \u00a0It was spicy but we were warned by the pepper next to it on the menu. \u00a0We also had a noodle dish that was just too hot. \u00a0Thankfully we ordered the big puffy bread which was delicious.   Our waiter was very nice. \u00a0I complained to him about the hostess and when the soup arrived and it was too hot he was very nice and did not charge us for my meal. \u00a0Of course I felt bad about whining. I would have rather had something delicious to eat so that I did not have to eat a big bag of popcorn at the movie. \u00a0  The waiter also comped us ice cream for dessert. \u00a0It really helped sooth our burning mouths but I had more guilt about complaining.  In any event, after dining at Dosa many times before movies at the Kabuki we will not return. \u00a0The last time we dined there we sat at the bar and witnessed a rude bartender who was in a bad mood and was not nice to a couple of the patrons. \u00a0The more we reflected on the meal, we came to the conclusion that this restaurant is going down hill. \u00a0There are too many new restaurants to try to spend time and money walking away with a bad dining experience.",

Our server was very nice. Luckily we got a reservation on Opentable so that it wasn't a long wait to get a table. We were seated in a quieter area of the restaurant, which was a relief, since it was so loud and crowded! Only real downside to the service was that because it was so busy, they forgot one of our appetizer orders and by the time they delivered it we were halfway through our dinner and had no room to eat more.  I got the pumpkin dosa which was pretty good. I expected there to be pumpkin inside the dosa, but it was just a separate dip, which was sweet and yummy. Next time I come here I probably wouldn't eat the insides of the dosa--or maybe it was just the pumpkin dosa filling that was boring, just potatoes. My boyfriend got the paneer dosa which came in 3 little wraps instead of the large triangle, and I thought that one tasted really good.  If you can come here DEFINITELY try the peony cocktail! SO GOOD! I had the Mango is the New Black cocktail which was ok but a little watery. My boyfriend had the specialty gin and tonic which he said was also alright, not really like a gin and tonic. But the Peony was sooooooo decadent and delicious and absolutely amazing. Yummmmm please.

    "review_text": "Going by Yelp's star annotations, we definitely had an \"A-OK\" experience. My boyfriend and I got the samosas, the paneer and peas dosa and the uttapam sampler. The menu went a little overboard on how sustainable, seasonal or organic something was, and they even sell 'house purified' water for like $5/750mL. I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous.  The samosas were good, one northern and one southern style samosa come per order - but the most interesting part of the dish was the tamarind sauce and chutney.  The dosa had 95% paneer, and a few little fresh peas dotted throughout. The accompanying coconut, tomato and sambar dipping sauces were fine. A little bland upon bland, then you hit the through-the-roof hot sambar, and nothing seemed very balanced.   We asked our waiter (who liked pointing at us with two index fingers kind of like the Fonz) what the different uttapams were in the sampler, because one with onions was actually really delicious, and he was like 'well, I couldn't tell ya'. After a few minutes he was like 'oh, it's probably the green onion one.' Gotcha.  This was our second time here, and that'll probably be it for us. Uddupi palace is way more up our alley - intimate and more sincere, none of the thick pretense floating around Dosa on Fillmore and definitely no Fonz-finger-pointing.",

I don't know how I've made it this far into my love affair with food of all kinds -- including PLENTY o' Indian cuisine -- without knowing that these amazing, giganto, flavor-filled crepes even existed!  The illustrious Tiffany N. took us baby CMs under her wing while in Frisco, and by gum, if this lady doesn't know her stuff. Dosa on Fillmore is a real treasure. Not only is it a beautiful space, especially if you seated up on the balcony portion we did, but everyone from the hostess staff to the busboys were friendly, accommodating, and offered their advice and suggestions without hesitation. Since I don't know of a place in Northern VA that serves dosas (yet! I'm making it my mission to find one!), obviously that was what must-order for me. But before we got to that, as a table we shared some appetizers that are making my mouth water all over again just thinking about them!  The North &amp; South Samosa dish was a fabulous way to highlight the difference between the two types of Indian cuisine. I'm actually not really sure which was which (bad Gretchen...) but one was your traditional potato samosa, and the other was more like a triangular spring roll, flatter and crispier with vegetables inside. Both were equally delicious, especially with my favorite tamarind sauce all up in thurr.  The lamb meatballs and a chicken appetizer dish that I can't remember the name of were also incredibly delicious. The meatballs are pretty spicy, so be forewarned, and the chicken had a good zip to it as well, but came with a yogurt sauce that cooled everything down to \u00a0be nice and mellow. Mm-mmm.  Okay, so onto the main event: the dosa! I got the paneer &amp; peas dosa, which actually doesn't come in a single bigger-than-your-head shaped monstrosity but is broken up into three deceptively proportioned looking crepes. I say deceptive, however, because it was still an incredible amount of food! Melty cheese, smashed and \u00a0whole peas, all wrapped up in a fluffy crepe... I'm sure it's no stretch for you to imagine exactly how delicious the entire thing was! I appreciated our waitress's tip to dip into all three sauces at once. It was like a flavor 'splosion in my mouth!  I also got a chance to steal from--I mean, share with--my neighbors, so I tried the roasted garlic dosa as well as the crispy paper dosa. Both were, again, delicious, and I really liked the traditional masala potatoes that came inside the paper. I will be going back to Dosa on Fillmore in a heartbeat the next time I fly back to San Francisco, you can bet on that!",

    "review_text": "A fun and unique twist on traditional south indian cuisine with a variety of tasty dosas. I think the authenticity of the food is probably mediocre at best by indian standards and you're paying more for the ambience because dosas, though tasty, are traditionally served in smaller cafes or street side in India or in indian neighborhoods across the US. However, I'm a sucker for ambience and didn't mind this particularly because its a good excuse to bring others to introduce them to south indian cuisine in a cool atmosphere where you can sample dosas in a variety of american and indian flavors. The paper dosa is tasty, though the size might be a bit surprising if you're unfamiliar with dosas. White truffle masala is also an interesting idea. Overall, a creative and worthwhile eating experience. I wish there were more restaurants doing fusion south indian food.",

    "review_text": "The staff at Dosa went above and beyond tonight to ensure I had the perfect meal. This has always been a favorite neighborhood spot; we often bring out-of-town guests here. When we got invited to a birthday dinner tonight, I was concerned because of a recent dietary restriction: no chillies, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, eggplant. I looked at the menu and saw nothing that I could order. Even my favorite cocktail, the Peony, has a dash of chili.  I called ahead and spoke to Todd (the manager). He agreed it would be tricky - most dishes at Dosa have up to 30 ingredients that are mixed ahead of time. He told me to ask for him when I arrived. So my husband and I got there about 15 minutes early and Todd spoke with the chefs to see what they could make especially for me. By the time the rest of the party arrived, he already had my order set and informed my waiter. They brought me two dishes that weren't on the menu: an appetizer of scallops with tamarind sauce and Uttapam with mushroom and onions. And I got my Peony (sans chili).  No one at my table even noticed that I wasn't eating the other shared dishes. I was so relieved and grateful that the staff took the time and care to meet my specific needs. I noticed how they treated the other guests as well (one friend had a cashew allergy and our waiter carefully checked the dishes for him). All 10 guests at our table were happy with the attentive service and the delicious food.   Bravo, Dosa! You already had 5 stars in my book; I would give you 6 tonight if I could.",

    "review_text": "Dosa on Fillmore (DoF) is a very peculiar Indian restaurant. Our waitress recommended the house special flat bread creations: two dosas and one uttapam. Presentation is gorgeous. Flavors are spicy and potent. The house chips and a pale ale from Paso Robles saved me from overload. I can't handle much in the way of hot hot food, and I slipped in under the danger zone tonight at DoF.  The included soup is too intense, but I managed to consume half of it. The included green chutney is mild and pleasant, but the red sauce isn't.  Decor and furnishings are spectacular. Sit in a corner booth if you can for comfort and people watching.  Take the advice of your server. One dish each is plenty filling, especially when you share. The overall trend is quite spicy, but you will survive with your server's assistance.  I had the huge sweet potato dosa, and it was impressive and flavorful. My wife had the summer uttapam that was attractive and delicious. My favorite was actually our friend's spicy chile dosa that was not too spicy at all, and had excellent flavors and texture.  Salted caramel ice cream was fine for mini-dessert, but the toasted cocoanut sorbet was a total dud: grainy and lacking in cohesiveness.  Not sure if we'll return any time soon, but it was very memorable and high quality.",

    "review_text": "I was in SF for an evening and really wanted to go to State Bird Provisions. Silly me, walking in without a reservation and thinking I might be seated. The hostess suggested I try Dosa. I headed down there and found something that was not at all what I expected!  The restaurant itself is really beautiful, with unusual, large-scale proportions.   The service was fantastic. At first, I suspected our server was going to be completely overbearing, but he turned out to be fantastic. We were overwhelmed by the menu (not your traditional Indian restaurant fare, because it's Southern Indian, I guess?), asked him for suggestions, and he walked us through the menu in detail, pointing out his favorites and also the dishes that were popular among guess.  All the food was intensely flavorful, beautiful, had a nice amount of heat without being too spicy (we had a couple of non-spice eaters in our party).  When we sat down, they brought us a bowl of papadam. We were expecting some sort of sauce or something for dipping, but none was brought. So we dug in. It was really flavorful, with whole cumin seeds, and completely addictive.  For four of us, we ordered two small plates and three larger dishes. Shredded Duck: A caramelized onion uttapam with duck vindaloo topped with tiny greens and some shredded watermelon radish. Beware, it's very tiny. However, it is highly delicious. South Indian Bhel Puri: An amazing salad of puffed rice, green mango, beets, potatoes, tomatoes, onion, cilantro. Everything is cut up into tiny pieces and is impossibly light (like, the weight when you spoon it onto your plate is nothing), crisp, and an amazing combination of flavors. Served with two different chutneys; one was green and chimichurri-esque, and the other was tamarind and sweet. White Truffle Masala Dosa: A huge, light dosa, crisp on the edges and softer in the middle, wrapped around mashed potatoes. The whole thing was buttery and redolent of white truffle. Super simple, but so delicious. Winter Uttapam: A thicker version of a dosa, almost like a frittata, with the toppings cooked into it. This one had sunchokes, potatoes, spinach, sundried tomatoes, trumpet mushrooms, and caramelized fennel. It was tasty, but with that line up of toppings, it wasn't as flavorful as I expected. The three sauces it was served with were all delicious: coconut chutney (mild), tomato chutney (a little heat), and sambar, this incredible soup that I ate straight out of the bowl. That may have been poor form, but it was totally worth it.  Kerala Fish Moilee: Sustainably-caught halibut in a pool of a red coconut sauce that was impossibly flavorful, citrusy, and spiced, over coconut rice. There was this amazing salad served with it with Brussels sprouts, butternut squash, and caramelized red onion. The whole plate was just beautiful.   I wasn't planning to drink...didn't even really want to, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try one of their cocktails once I saw the list. I would've liked to try six of them, but settled on the Peony (Plymouth gin, hisbiscus masala nectar, coconut milk, lime, bird's eye chile). It was beautiful (a recurring theme at this place), light pink, opaque with coconut milk, and with a swath of lime zest on the top. It was balanced and flavorful, not too sweet, and the coconut milk was a nice counterpoint to the spiciness of the food.   Dosa is totally unlike any other Indian restaurant I've ever been to, and I loved it.",

    "review_text": "Finally making it out to Dosa for a Sunday birthday brunch two weeks back, our group of 10 was promptly seated once our reservation time rolled around, with a handful of our party milling around their bar prior to this.   After perusing a fairly extensive brunch menu, we ordered the following to share:  * Chennai Chicken ($11) - A different take on what I believe is usually a curry-like dish, Dosa prepares their Chennai chicken as strips of lightly-fried white meat, served up with a yogurt dipping sauce. Great, bold, flavor, with a bit of kick to top things off.  * Samosas \"North &amp; South\" ($9) - More or less your standard samosas, the South was filled with caramelized onions and veggies, while the North was simply filled with spiced potatoes. Despite my love of potatoes, I found the South to be much tastier, with greater flavor. However, when had with the sauces, both were quite tasty.  While I ordered the following for myself:  * Okra Kolambu ($13) [ <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fflic.kr%2Fp%2Fdp67ut&amp;s=1322ff324ebf58db491772330699f61333a9c2625ab516bee1f60f3410d67407\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">flic.kr/p/dp67ut</a> ] - While I find the texture of okra to be a bit weird (admit it, okra is a tad slimy), this was actually a very tasty dish, mixing up savory and sweet flavors with a hint of spice. While most will probably find this to be a single serving, I easily had enough leftovers for seconds.  * Rum with South Indian Monsoon ($6 + ?) - Normally a virgin drink, the ingredients (citrus, mint, ginger, juice, and soda) screamed out for a splash of rum. Two others in the group agreed, and not one of us was disappointed by the delicious cocktail that arrived moments later.  With enjoyable food and great service, Dosa is definitely on my to-revisit list. And while their dinner menu is definitely more in the $$$ tier, their brunch options price out to a more affordable $$. The only thing about the menu that raised an eyebrow was the pricing of items: having appetizers priced the same as entrees seemed rather unusual.  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - A large, spacious, and multi-level restaurant, maneuverability and accessibility should not pose any problems, as long as you remain on the lower level. In fact, I doubt they have any way of getting to the upper level aside from the winding staircase.  Bathroom - Large and spacious, just like the venue itself, with all the usual ADA accoutrements.",

There's nothing better than being waited on by someone who is both friendly and knowledgeable.  A big fan of Indian food I'd somehow never tried dosa before. With the suggestion of the white truffle Dosa I could barely wait to get my dinner! In almost no time at all we were served a number of lovely appetizers. From lamb kebabs to samosas, it was all delicious. Then out came my dosa. WOW! It was massive, it was light and flaky and it was de-double-licious. Just thinking of it right now makes me want to hop on a plane back to the Fillmore and get another plate full. The server had mentioned it was her personal favorite item and boy was that a great anecdote. I can't wait to come back and eat more.

    "review_text": "After driving all day to the lovely city of San Francisco, we were famished. My hope for trying the up and coming State Bird Provisions was immediately dashed as they were fully booked even on a Tuesday evening. Thankfully our local hosts had good alternatives, and as it was nearby we headed over to Dosa who graciously accommodated us last minute.   Dosa is gorgeous. It's a stunning space, the room is expansive and atmospheric with beautifully rendered art that blends old and new. In effect, it's a representation of the Southern Indian dishes available that are both authentic and modern. The food pleasantly reminded me of Vij's in Vancouver, the best Indian food I've ever had. Anywhere. This isn't quite at that level, and its not as consistent but then what is? For the most part, the food was jaw-droppingly good, though interestingly my least enjoyable dish was the namesake dosa.   Before I forget, the bread is amaaaaazing here. There is no naan (wrong part of the country), but you won't notice. Bhatura is a must order. It's a giant, light fluffy piece of edible pastry heaven. Pretty sure I could live off of it. Papadon was equally good, one of the best I've come across. Light and lovely. Paratha was also quite nice.  Samosas North and South are wonderfully prepared here, perfectly crispy. Bookended with two different but equally divine sauces, especially the sweet one.  Lotus Stem Dayboat Scallops were exquisite. Again balanced by two ridiculously addictive sauces, this was my favorite dish of the evening.  Rasam Fire Broth was interestingly named, because it wasn't particularly fiery but it was extremely tasty. It had a moderate kick, but a very good and interesting flavor.  Roasted Chili and Garlic Dosa was exceedingly hot. Almost unpleasantly so, but keep in mind I like moderately spicy not hair curling hot, so if you like really spicy it might be wonderful.   Mangalorean Prawn Masala was nicely prepared. Great flavor, nice balanced spice. Quite enjoyable.  Duck Vindaloo was very good.   Sun Choke Uttapam wasn't that successful for my palate, possibly it was the version we chose, but I don't think I'd visit that dish again.  Surprisingly we ended with a fantastic dessert. Pistachio Dacquoise with chocolate chili mousse, salted caramel and cocoa cookie. If that sounds good on paper, it was even better on the tongue.   Overall, this was a delightful beginning to our trip. There's nothing like a complete lack of expectation to allow for immense pleasure, and since we knew nothing beforehand, every great moment was enhanced. Had it not been for the two missteps, this would have been an easy five star night for us. In fact, even with them it really still was for me.

I ordered the green mango and paneer dosa and it was pretty delicious! The overall dosa has a nice crisp texture and the filling is flavorful. You get the dosa with 2 types of different chutney's and sambar! I like their spicy chutney and it paired really well with my dosa. The sambar was pleasing to the taste buds as well.  For all those people who don't take dosa on the regular- dip the dosa in the sambar and then take it with the chutney!  Only thing is it is pricy! Service \u00a0was good and this spot is definitely perfect to take that special someone on a special occasion i.e Valentines day!! The dim lighting gives an romantic flare and I wish that I had come on a date here rather than with my friends JK...next time!",

Friends had Masala dosa and chilli garlic dosa, we did order a plate of bhel puri, pani puri and Kale pakoras. The best appetizer in a really really long time is Kale Pakoras - light crunchy and fresh - A MUST TRY here. It was a little expensive overall, but I guess you can't help that in a city. We spent almost $30 a head. But, worth it in my opinion.   Tip: Make sure you make a reservation if you need a table of 5 or more.",

It's classy and modern with a friendly staff and excellent unique food. \u00a0My first visit was with a large group, so we ordered family style and shared half of the menu items, so I definitely got a great taste of what they have to offer. \u00a0I didn't taste anything I didn't like by the way!  During my most recent visit, there were just two of us and we sat at the bar. While they offer some awesome looking cocktails and the bartenders are super fun to watch as they prepare them, Tiffany and I opted for champagne and wine respectively. \u00a0We also shared two appetizers: Grilled Calamari and the North and South Samosas. \u00a0Tiffany went with a signature dosa for her main course and I ate every last drop of the Vegetable Curry with coconut rice. \u00a0I left crazy full; it was flavorful and filling!  If you like Indian cuisine but are looking for a more upscale ambiance and diverse drink menu to go along with it, Dosa is for you. \u00a0Just make sure you make a reservation ahead of time if you have a large group. \u00a0And if it's just one or two of you, the bar or community table are awesome... maybe you'll meet a new friend while you are there?!",

Made a reservation about 40 minutes prior to getting there and was seated pretty quickly upon arrival.  Started with the idli sambar small plates. The delicious bowl of sambar is super flavorful and the two idli's peek out at you, ready to be devoured. Warms you up and excites you for more food. I loved the \"thuriya\" green beans in there that pop into four you eat the insides of. Reminded me of the noms my mom used to make.  I decided (after much contemplation) on the roasted chile and garlic masala dosa and boy was that a great choice. I love garlic, I love heat, and I love complex flavor. This dish had all of that. I nominate this star of the show.  Other honorable mentions:  Quinoa \"thinnai\" uttapam Raita (double- you will eat all of it) chutneys Masala dosa  The potatoes and cashews were on point, authentic, SPICY, and delicious.   Towards the end of our meal, the guy taking our plates spilled chutney all overrrr one of the jackets on the chair. Manager was super nice and comped a dessert and promised to cover dry cleaning. Totally appreciated that.  So awesome they have a menu that provides alternatives for dietary restrictions.  It's not cheap, but it's worth it when you want a filling, quality meal you will be reminiscing about for hours.",

I know next to nothing (okay, just nothing...) about Indian food, so I can't speak to the authenticity of the flavors, preparations, etc. What I do know is that every dish I had here was delicious!   We arrived 45 minutes late for our reservation on a Friday night due to some ridiculous traffic downtown. Thankfully, we called ahead and the hostess was gracious enough to seat us anyway. We started with a round of Peonys - gin, hibiscus masala nectar (!!), coconut cream, chile, and lime. It was a little bit too sweet for me, but that coconut cream was divine.   Between the four of us, we split the spicy basil dosa, chef's selection of 5 uttapam, chicken korma curry, spicy basil prawns, a side of coconut rice, and bhatura. I loved the different chutneys and sambhar that arrived with the dosa and uttapam. The combination of spicy, smokey, cool / refreshing was perfect! There were so many flavors all at once. The curries were very good as well. The chicken was super tender and the prawns had this unique smooth and smokey taste to them. My favorites were the bhatura and the prawns.   Even though we were stuffed, we still split 3 desserts between the four of us. I loved the fresh coconut cream custard. It was a tad too sweet because it was sitting in a light syrup but the coconut textures and flavors were so good that it didn't even matter. We also enjoyed the apricot chiboust, which was apricot tapioca with coconut cream on top. Our least favorite was the raspberry mascarpone tart. The only part I liked about the tart was the chantilly cream it came with :/.   Dosa is a great spot for a date night or for catching up with friends. I will definitely be back!",

It was crowded and therefore a little loud, but it would be a very nice place for a date. We were a little early so we decided to sit at the bar and sip on cocktails until our table was ready. We had the Peony and the Gin &amp; Tonic (with cardamom, yum!). Both were great.   Shortly after getting the drinks, we were told our table was ready (a bit ahead of our 7:30pm reservation time). The hostess transferred the tab seamlessly.  The tasting menu looked amazing but we opted for appetizers &amp; dosas. Here's what we ate:  Appetizers: Lamb Kofta Samosas 'North &amp; South'  Dosas: Lamb 'Keema'  Spicy Mung Masala  Everything was brought out hot &amp; fresh - the lamb kofta was particularly tasty and I ended up sopping up the remaining sauce with my pappadum (they had to bring us 2 baskets, we gobbled them up so quickly). The samosas were also very good, not oily and easily shared.   I like my food to have a bit of a kick, so I opted for the spicy mung masala - which was great and perfectly spicy. When my brother was distracted and looking away, I nibbled on his lamb keema and *almost* wished I'd ordered that instead, until I took another bite off my own plate and my taste buds did another jig for joy. We really should have split each dosa in half and shared. Next time.   Eat the dosas with your hands for maximum enjoyment. This is probably one of the best South Indian restaurants I've eaten at (it's even better than some of the food that we had in India...shhh!)",

We saw groups that were standing at the bar when we got there and were there when we left!  Their drinks are little unique, I had the Whiskey drink which was good (but you can only have one or two). The first dish we got was the dipping sauce sampler. That was great, my favorite was the Kale dip (good for snacking).   I also had the spicy Roasted Chili &amp; Garlic Masala and my girlfriend had Mysore Masala. They both were moderately spicy (not as spicy as it sounds on the menu).   It was a tad pricy, about $77 for the couple (not including drinks) but we were stuffed after that! It is a great place for a date (or double date as we did). I had a great time and encourage anyone to give it a try.",

Plus the techno music was WAY loud to the point of annoying. So, a very disappointing dinner experience in the dining room and we will be sure to keep our 5:30PM happy hour at the bar with nibbles and drinks there going forward. \u00a0  I swear, if Christmas eve was my first time at Dosa, I would have written a one star and vow never to return.",

You can get the best for cheap. Also for weekends they have the South Indian Thali, which is a combination of 10-12 curries, chutneys, etc small dishes. LOVE it!!

The wine list was good-- though quite pricey. My boyfriend thought it would be a great place to take me because I LOVE Indian food, but the menu is very small and didn't have any of my favorite Indian choices. The server told us that if we had never had a Dosa before, we had to try one. Since we had not, we ordered the traditional Masala Dosa. When it came out it looked like an over sized pancake with a big scoop of mashed potatoes in the center. We opened it up and had to spread the filling over the whole \"pancake\". It tasted how it looked and the dipping sauces did not add much flavor.  My trip to Dosa was highly anticipated after hearing many great reviews, but my experience was not good. Friends say that next time we go we should order one of the entrees and not the Dosa, but I am not sure we will be going back.",

The interior is both classy and comfortable; it successfully merges contemporary interior design with Indian-inspired aesthetics. There's plenty of tables for intimate and casual dining. \u00a0The bar was pretty packed for a Tuesday evening. Looks like people were enjoying an array of cool libations.  Now on to the food... Lotus Stem Day Boat Scallops were flavorful but once you mixed in either two sauces, it was over the top delicious. This was my first dish of the night and it really did set the tone for what was to come. Exciting indeed!  I could snack on the Green Mango &amp; Paneer Dosa for days :P The paneer dosa was soft and gooey yet perfectly toasty..does this even make sense? You just have to try it.   The Prawn Masala w/ coconut rice exceeded my expectations. I didn't know a masala could taste that good! I especially loved the chunky texture because you could actually see the ingredients :) Also, there was just enough heat to tingle my taste buds. Don't worry people, it's not too spicy. \u00a0It's just right.   I wrapped up my meal with the Pistachio Dacquoise w/ Chocolate Chile Mousse which was exactly what I needed. There's a beautiful play on textures with all the layered ingredients. The level of sweetness was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth without making me feel gluttonous [like other desserts can do].  I would highly recommend this restaurant because of its superb food, welcoming service, and cozy ambiance. Dosa sets the bar high and I may have ruined my chances of enjoying Indian food elsewhere :P \u00a0What can you do? I'm convinced Dosa does it best &amp; I will definitely be back for more.",

You tear the wrapper off and use it to scoop up some of the steaming middle mash. Then you fold it up, and dip it into a spicy broth, trying hard not to drip as you lift it to your mouth and chew.  It's heaven. It's sexy, sexy food. There's something about the handling of the food, the way you create your own perfect bite every time, that just satisfies me so much.

Regardless of whether you are an anti-Chicken Tikka Masala kid who grew up on authentic Indian food, like me, or a complete stranger to the world of Indian masalas and \"bad with spicy food\" (some of the friends I came with), I would highly recommend this restaurant.   Started off the night with the adorably-named 'Mango is the New Black' drink. The combination of dry whiskey, spicy mango nectar, and spicy agave left a really burn sensation but was also the perfect amount of sweet. I would like to come back and try other drinks here for sure.   For the main course, we ordered the South Indian Moons (combo uttapam plate), Spicy Basil Dosa, Goan Shrimp Curry, and Chicken Korma. The uttapams very small and cute, but there were about 9-10 pieces (great plate to share with people). The plate had a white truffle and mushroom uttapam -- didn't know this could be a thing!! The Spicy Basil Dosa was also SO delicious. The sauce was basically a traditional mint and cilantro chutney with an Italian pesto spin. It was spread all over the Dosa, not served on the side. \u00a0  The shrimp and chicken items were tasty but next time I will veer away from these traditional curries and try more of their fusion items - Chennai Chicken, Shredded Duck, etc.  Come here with an open mind and empty stomach...and make it a mission to try as much as you can. I'm sure you will leave feeling absolutely delighted (although your pocket will feel a little lighter... it is totally worth it!).",

The mango lassi by my side really kept in handy while bringing the heat down a bit. Not to mention it was delicious. And the flavor, man. So incredible.

    "review_text": "I have enjoyed many Northern Indian dishes and have thought that Indian food is certainly one of my great favorites that I constantly seek out wherever I travel. Until I found Dosa I thought I had experienced Indian food. I had only experienced half of what the sub continent has to offer.  Dosa is Southern Indian and although some of the spices are very similar to Northern Indian cuisine, the whole experience is quite different and, I have to say, refreshingly so.  Everything we had was awesome, so much so that we both overindulged.   Starting with their papadum and chutney sampler, we knew we were in for a treat. We actually accepted the very kind offer for more papadums just to keep sampling the chutneys and when the waiter wanted to clear them away we asked for them to stay throughout the meal.  The actual dosas are so enormous that we opted for 2 of their smaller sibling called poori not wanting to fill up on bread. Next time we will get a dosa but hopefully we will have others to share it with. They really are enormous.  We had prawn masala, Tamil lamb, and lamb chops because we couldn't get enough of the lamb which was really tender and juicy with incredible spices. Another interesting dish was the dahi rice which is more the equivalent of raita in the north and not really a rice dish per se. Necessary though as a cooling dish to compliment the spices. Without a dosa one really needs a rice dish so we opted for basmati just because all the dishes had so much really tasty sauce which we could not send back.  The drink menu eat Dosa is extensive and I was very happy to find a selection of wines that compliment the food really well. A bottle of Saarstein Riesling did not disappoint. Initially I thought that it may be too sweet, although advertised as off dry, but as the dinner progressed and the spices built, it turned out to be another perfect cooling element.  Our server, Mike, was excellent and thoroughly understood our tastes. He suggested the lamb chops when we ordered an extra dish late in the dinner, and it was a perfect addition.   Looking forward to our next visit to Dosa when we will definitely get one even if it requires a doggie bag!",

This was an upscale Indian restaurant and it sort of surprised me since I didn't know what to expect coming in - gf made the reservation.   Food: Decent. We started with the Chennai chicken and Paper Dosa which were both quite tasty. I've never had Dosa before so it was very interesting and i walked away a fan. The 3 dipping sauces were unique and I would recommend trying all three together.  My one complaint was that our entree (lamb curry with lemon rice) took way too long to come out and wasn't very good at all.  Overall it is a nice date spot and I'd come back again to try other dishes but for Indian food I prefer to go to a hole in the wall like Pakwan.",

DOSA on Fillmore is a vibrant and elegant place that has fantastic food to enjoy with friends and loved ones.   Food &amp; Drinks: [$36.95/ea. Wine Pairing $22/ea.]   * First Course  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* South Indian Bhel Puri - Puffed rice, green mango, beets, potatoes, tomatoes, onions &amp; coriander, spicy &amp; sweet chutneys  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* Lotus Stem Day Boat Scallops - Cilantro, chiles, mustard, maple sauce, with fried lotus stems  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* Wine: Sula Chenin Blanc * Second Course  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* Green Mango &amp; Paneer Dosa - Spicy, pickled mango relish, shredded farmer's cheese, cilantro  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* Trumpet Mushrooms Uttapam - Light drizzle of truffle oil, cilantro &amp; curry leaves, grilled pancake-style   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* Wine: Kawarau Sauvignon Blanc * Third Course  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* Chicken &amp; Eggplant - Natural, boneless, \"bharta\"-style roasted and pureed eggplant &amp; peas with lemon rice  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* Tamil Lamb - Free-range &amp; natural, fennel, tomatoes, poppy seeds, caramelized onions &amp; spices with lemon rice  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* Wine: Old York Malbec  Overall, each item we ordered was very delicious and had it's own unique taste and texture. For our first dish the Puri had a nice sweet crunchy texture that was spot on. The scallops were good, but didn't stand out compared to the second and third course. Now the DOSA's, that was just amazing! A warm gooey cheese inside cooked perfectly, and when you dip it into the sauces it just melts in your mouth. The Uttapam was like any other pancake-style item that taste good, but taste even better once you dip it into the sauces! Our third and final course made the dinner even more spectacular as the flavors just popped. The Tamil Lamb has a nice spicy kick to it (medium) that brings out the wonderful flavors, while the Chicken &amp; Eggplant tasted great with the lemon rice. The wine's for each course complimented the dishes well.  As for the service, it was just mediocre. We had to wave our hands to get their attention as they just walked by us a few times without even looking or seeing how we're doing.  Last but not least, it's nice to know that \"DOSA is committed to sustainable &amp; healthy choices by using local &amp; organic ingredients as much as possible, natural, free-range &amp; grass-fed lamb, cage-free eggs, anti-biotic-free &amp; hormone-free chicken, fresh &amp; sustainably-caught fish and non-GMO oils.\"   Quick Tips:   \u00a0 * Make reservations!  \u00a0 * Get there at least 15 minutes early to find parking!  \u00a0 * Full menu is online.

    "review_text": "Why Dosa's IS a 5-star place:  When you are emotionally overcome with deep sadness upon taking the last bite of your meal... you know you've eaten something special. I ordered the paneer and peas dosa. And it was gastronomical art. Accompanied with sambar and both a tomato and coconut chutney (I believe the coconut had cilantro in it - and I'm one of those people who LOATHE cilantro, but in this? It was totally acceptable!), my heart physically ached upon taking that final bite. Goodbye, beautiful meal, thank you for existing!  And yes, as the menu suggested, I totally used my fingers to eat... and classy restaurants that let me play with my food? INSTA-FIVE STAR.  The servers were incredibly informed about the components of each dish. I appreciated how, in a totally non-pretentious way, that explained their concept, what went best with what, why things were made a certain way, etc. And, I was a little seduced by the atmosphere in general - the decor was uber tasteful and classy, the lighting was romantically low, the background music was house/techno, and the clientele was all over the map. I'm one of those people who appreciate when four things that don't necessarily organically go together (fancyschmancy interior design, sexy time lighting, music that I want to rave to, and people I could either be having a business meeting or a bachelorette party with) do. Because in this instance, it totally works!  However, there are two reasons why Dosa's ISN'T getting 5-stars from me (feel free to stop reading here if you want, because they really are \"As good as it gets!\", except for...)  Reason #1, \"Space Invaders Are No Bueno With Me\" - Maybe it's because physically I'm a tiny chick, but people often associate my stature with age. Being little =/= being young. And when you're \"young\" it's okay to have your personal space invaded (or so is the mindset of many adults). That being said, the waitstaff at Dosa's definitely invaded my personal space every go-around with the plates (something I didn't notice them doing with other people). They would stand in back of me, reach around my torso/face with two arms to lift or place plates over my head. Again, something that probably wouldn't even register on other folk's radars, but it did on mine. And...  Reason #2, \"Petty, Petty Pie Princess\" - When I found out we were going to Dosa's, I did what any sane yelper does - I looked up their menu. The very first thing that caught my eye was some banana goat cheese pie thing. SOLD. That was the single thing I look forward to eating. When it came time for dessert, though, guess what wasn't on the menu? Mhmm, the banana goat cheese pie. We asked the server if they still carried it. \"I'm sorry, we don't. But it was SOOOOOOO good. Like... seriously, so, so, so good. It's really too bad we don't carry it anymore,\" was her response. I don't want to hear how delicious something I can't have is, so the appropriate response - in my obviously humble opinion - would have been: a) \"I'm sorry, we don't,\" (which is to the point without telling me whether it was good or not leaving me opinion-less and not dessert h'angry) or, b) \"Not anymore. It wasn't that good anyway,\" with a wink and a playful smile (which is more fun and less braggy).  In the end... my advice? Go to Dosa's. Eat then weep at how gorgeous your meal was.  (Then weep some more because of a dessert you can't have.)",

I felt like the server was intentionally trying to piss us off. When we went in, the server took forever to take our orders even though the restaurant was empty save a couple in the corner and one other small family. She was chatting with the small family forever. Then when she took our drink orders, we all ordered chai tea. When my aunt got it, she didn't realize it was milk based and asked the server for another drink since she's lactose intolerant. That also took forever because our server said she kept forgetting... When we finally got our food, no one explained what the sauces were to us. This wouldn't have been a problem if I didn't hear the server explain everything in detail to the couple sitting in the corner. After, my aunt ordered another drink which she just never got.  Perhaps it was a race thing since we were the only people of color in the restaurant, or maybe our server just had some unknown, personal vendetta against us. Either way, I'm never going back there. San Francisco has way too many nice places to give Dosa a second chance.",

    "review_text": "I don't think I have ever seen a more extravagant Indian restaurant. Decorations-wise, this place was absolutely beautiful. I was more interested in looking around at the intricate lamps and the paintings and the than I was in actually eating my food.   I came here for a casual dinner, so I ended up spending much more than I had planned. We ordered a bunch of plates for sharing amongst the group, as well as individual meals. I ordered the masala dosa where the dosa was made out of wheat, and was greatly displeased. It was pretty much impossible to eat because it was crunchy rather than your typical dosa which is foldable. How am I supposed to eat the masala?!?!! I struggled and struggled with my dosa until I finally just left it up for grabs for everyone else while I worked on the other dishes.   The watermelon, sprouts, and paneer salad was probably among the most innovative dishes I've ever seen. Seemed to me like an spinoff of what everyone is raving about these days - the watermelon-feta salad, and they did an amazing job of recreating an Indian version of it. I had seconds and thirds (and maybe fourths but don't tell anyone) of it and I didn't even feel guilty because....it's watermelon! And sprouts! Guilt-free!!!! The chennai chicken is to die for but I felt bad after eating maybe 2 pieces because that stuff looked deep-fried and then fried once more and then deep-fried again. Terribly oily and crispy, but it definitely should be tried on a cheat day. There was one more dish I particularly liked, and it had shrimp in it and was some kind of curry. Forgot the exact name though, but I think it's one of the only dishes with shrimp on the menu. The main courses themselves (as for me, I only had the unmanageable dosa) were nothing to rave about, in my honest opinion.  Overall, love the ambience. Food was good, but not THAT great especially for what I paid. 4 stars felt a little too generous, but don't let that stray you away! If you're feeling rich one night and feel like getting some Indian, definitely try out this place. If you are ballin on a budget, stay away. You can get cheap but good Indian food on literally any corner up in San Francisco.",

    "review_text": "Went here for our anniversary dinner last week, for the first time. Overall, we enjoyed it, and I would probably go back, but with a couple of caveats.  The Good: The happy hour appetizers we tried (the kale pakora and vegetarian sliders) were really, really good. And at the $6 happy hour price, no regrets. I enjoyed the sweet potato dosa we got, though my husband was a bit less enthusiastic. The cocktail menu is fascinating. Only tried one--the peony--but it was absolutely delicious--tasted like melted sorbet or something. I usually can't drink gin anymore, but it didn't even taste like gin. Dangerous! I'd love to try some of the other special cocktails, but at $12 a pop, you really do have to limit yourself. The restaurant itself is beautiful and spacious. Everything we tried was tasty, though the prices are too high. Our waiter was nice, helpful, attentive. There is a parking garage right next door, and since it's run by the city, it's only $1/hour--a good find in the City of No Parking.  The Bad: Overpriced. The lamb tamil tasted good, but it was a tiny serving for $26, plus you have to order rice or dosa with it as a side (they don't really give you the option not to) and that adds an extra $3-5 to that $26 plate. It definitely wasn't good enough (or substantial enough) to be worth $30. (We get one at a hole-in-the-wall down the street that's just as good or better for $8.) In fact, everything on the menu is pretty much a la carte and too expensive (besides the happy hour appetizers!). The bartender was really rude. I didn't feel like he was overly rude to us (though my husband did--I guess he's more sensitive), just not overly nice either, but he was definitely rude to someone who came and sat down on the other side of us. This person was trying to order something from him as he was making some drinks, and instead of politely telling him something like, \"I'll be right with you,\" he snapped, \"I'm not ready for that.\" With attitude. Even though he didn't do anything like that to us, the attitude was definitely, \"I'm doing you a favor by answering your question or taking your order.\" I can do without the attitude. I have been a server/bartender and I know when you're busy it can be tempting to be short with customers, but it's unacceptable. I never did it and I don't expect my servers/bartenders to do it to me. But, like I said, our waiter at our table was great, and the hostesses were fine as well. The happy hour drink menu is only for one beer, two wines and a margarita, all $6 except the beer (which is $4). That is a decent (but not amazing) price for those drinks, but it was disappointing that there wasn't some kind of discount on their awesome cocktails during happy hour...but fine, whatever. The happy hour food menu sort of makes up for that, I guess.   I guess you are paying for the experience as much as the food itself, and we did have a nice evening, but I don't see it becoming a regular spot for us.",

Started with the chutney sampler -- everyone found a new favorite.  \u00a0 North and South samosas -- North were some of the best potato samosas I've had, but the South was delightfully sweet and savory. \u00a0Warning -- that innocent little side salad has something quite spicy in/on it. \u00a0The tamarind chutney had been in the sampler, but cilantro chutney was different, and not scary spicy.  Bhatura - big, poofy, and delicious -- with or without any of the many chutneys available on the table by the time we were done. \u00a0(It lasted pretty much the whole meal.)  Lamb boti kebab -- yummy, but if we weren't splurging, it wouldn't make the cut.  Chennai chicken was delightful with and without the yogurt dip on the side. \u00a0Lots of finger-size pieces, perfect for sharing.  The lamb dosa had the lamb on the side, along with two more chutneys, different from the others, and the sambar soup. \u00a0Definitely will get that again. \u00a0So flavorful.  The potato dosa was good too, but again, if we weren't splurging, it wouldn't make the cut. \u00a0Same sambar and chutneys as the lamb dosa.  So much food, but we figured it wouldn't hurt to look at the dessert menu. \u00a0Glad we did.  White chocolate pot creme -- next time, we'll get two. \u00a0The perfect contrast to all the spicy foods that preceded it.  Coconut custard cake -- not sure why this is called cake. \u00a0Tasty, but the pot creme dessert took the blue ribbon.  We don't get to the City often, but this will be on our list for a return trip -- with reservations next time. \u00a0And definitely when we have vegetarian friends along.",

    "review_text": "They promote themselves as South Indian food restaurant but there is nothing authentic about their food, neither their Dosas nor their Uttapams or their entrees. Dosa is basically street food in India that you get for very cheap; charging for the decor I suppose because the food is nowhere tasty unless people don't know what authentic South Indian food is like and love this place. We would still frequent this place very often due to the proximity of this location to where we live as we needed our dose of Indian food kick!  A major drawback of eating at this place is the service. Every time me and family visit, the waiters do not let us order what we want and instead keep telling us \"You are ordering too much! You don't need to order this and that and blah blah....\" I mean, what's up with that??? Why can't we order what we want? Is ordering 2 appetizers and 2 entrees for 2 people too much? It seems for their staff it is (We are not a family of obese people mind you, if you think all we do is eat). They just wouldn't let us order appetizers telling us \"The entrees would be enough. Don't order appetizers it will be too much!\" We could box up the leftovers if its too much. We have never had a restaurant staff forcing us to not order what we want! And every time we ordered something else someone new would arrive to take the order. They keep switching the waiters.  Low on kitchen staff? Then hire more people! Don't tell customers to order less. If this had happened once or twice I won't even mention it. We have frequented this place more than 15 times now and every time it has been the same - aggressive pushy attitude when it comes to ordering food. We know what we want and how much we want, we don't want the restaurant staff telling us not to order this or that. We have stopped eating here due to this and have no intention to go back! There are better South Indian restaurants in the city anyways so might as well drive farther away from home than put up with pushy service.",

This was definitely a 5 starred restaurant for us, but in my last two visits to Dosa, I was a little unhappy with my Dahi rice and Sambhar, and hence the 4 stars. Another thing that I usually get very annoyed with is their constant menu changes, another downer for me.   Not a big fan of their desserts except one, so if you love mangoes, make sure you leave some room for their mango pudding, tried &amp; tested many times!! :)  Tip: Weekdays or Weekends, the place is always crowded, so always best to make reservations.",

As are the samosas and the Lamb Keema Dosa. Honestly, portions are huge so family style is best. As for drinks, I liked the Mango is the New Black, and the Peony.   It is on the pricier side, so definitely a place to enjoy on special occasions.",

    "review_text": "Not that anymore yelp reviews will add to what has been said about Dosa on Fillmore (geez some 800-900 wow). Here is my 2 cents.  I made reservations through the yelp site...really easy and dosa got the reservation and we were seated right away. We asked to be seated upstairs on a rainy night and it was just wonderful upstairs. The service for us was stellar: prompt, not overbearing, very helpful and just really nice people. I am talking from the waiter, to the bus boy, the drink waiter they were all just great.  I love Indian food as I have spent many a night down on 6th street in new york...Mitali etc ( the hotter the better...bring on the lamb vindaloo).  Dosa has wonderful Indian food it varies from what I am used to (as there are so many different regions...India is a big friggin place) but they execute really well and the flavors and textures and the presentation are very nice. Prices are not cheap...but than you are dinning in a very nice place with very nice food and very nice service. This aint no pakistani naan and curry y'all.   In essence I would come back in a heart beat. It was really really good!!",

    "review_text": "Great husband and I dropped in spontaneously in this large corner restaurant in the Fillmore (used to be the Goodwill Store--now across the street) having walked by it for several years and just going in for drinks from time to time. \u00a0What we have been missing! \u00a0Our server, Stephen, should win an award for patience and grace and knowledge. \u00a0He described the menu offerings clearly and suggested good combinations. \u00a0He certainly was spot-on and a terrific guide.  Little puffed delights appeared with a green sauce and another unusual sauce with saucers of mung beans, garbanzo beans and potatoes all spiced to perfection which one can arrange inside the little puffs. \u00a0Then arrived the famous Dosa--mine filled with spicy basil potatoes--and the chutneys and dips to accent the large, light , crisp crepe-like triangle miracle that appeared before me. \u00a0Husband ordered the delicately rolled lamb-filled roti with vegetables and it was stunning in the depths of flavor.  Our meal did not make us feel stuffed--but we were satisfied that we had had a perfect meal that hit \"all the notes.\" \u00a0This restaurant was everything we wanted it to be.  We still wanted something unusual after the terrific main courses! What made us faint was the chocolate/chili hazelnut-caramel dessert. Anchored with a pistachio rectangle of cake perfection and then topped with chocolate and a crisp plank of nuts and chili, this dessert simply is without equal. \u00a0 This dessert made the meal perfect.  The tall ceilings and lovely decor and excellent service make the restaurant restful at lunch. \u00a0Dinner is different. \u00a0It is packed and hopping. \u00a0This place overflows at night around the bar and the busy, happy crowd varies in age--good sign.  If you have a sophisticated palate and like the adventure of identifying the great layers of spices and flavors, this is the place for you. Don't miss Stephen--the perfect host!!!",
