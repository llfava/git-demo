Despite being slightly skeptical of the location, I followed my friends into SRO at Oddjob and before I knew it was having the most enjoyable and entertaining night out in SF that I've ever had (which is saying a lot, especially since it was a Tuesday).   What makes this place work so well is 1.) Joey and 2.) his friends, friends of friends, and complete strangers that come together to let loose, joke around, and witness cocktail magic.   To put it simply, when it comes to crafting the perfect cocktail, Joey is a wizard. While he has an incredible array of ingredients to choose from--the thing that stands out the most is the level of imagination and heart that goes into creating them. He masterfully recreates any given mood or feeling perfectly. He also has a way of convincing you to trust him and try things you would have never considered. I specifically requested that he not use a particular ingredient, yet he insisted to use it and ended up creating one of the best drinks I've ever had.    In watching Joey create drinks for others, you end up befriending all of the people around you. Joey treats everyone like family, and before you know it you'll leave feeling like one. You may never know what kind of drink you'll get or the people you'll meet--but this place is guaranteed a great night out, any day of the week.",

We came in about midnight on Saturday night and the bartender said she was backed up it would be a few minutes. No problem. 10 minutes later she says there are 4 drinks in front of ours. Still, no problem. 15 minutes later she actually comes out from behind the bar over to our table and tells us she still has 4 drinks in front of us and it's almost last call so we should go to the other bar. Not embellishing. African American female bartender should not be allowed to work with people. I've bartended for years and would be fired (and expect to be fired) if I ever did this. We went to the other bar and spoke to a bartender who said \"she's really sick\". Gross! \u00a0Extremely drunk manager (it was his birthday) offered to buy us drinks but by that point we were over it. \u00a0Based on how great the owners and previous bartenders were we hope to try it again and actually get a drink.

It wasn't too crowded here on a Saturday night, which was great, because I could actually hear people talk and felt like the place was a bit more private.  Cocktails run around $12-14 each. Some of the drink names were James Bond themed, and I tried the \"pussy galore.\"( Did they name it that just to hear you say it??) Careful,some of the drinks are quite strong, and others are more sweet. The pussy galore is a sweeter one.   The real gem of this place is the bar to the left of they alleyway entrance where the bartender will create made to order drinks on the fly based on your preferences. I asked for an herb infused drink on the sweet side, and he made a parsnip infused cocktail with absinthe. I actually don't like either ingredient all that much, but the drink itself was AMAZING. The ingredients just went really well together. He also has a wide selection of scotch and whisky. Drinks at that bar will run around $20 each, but it's worth it to try at least once.",

On top of that, their door staff and security were so rude to the rest of our guests who arrived that we chose to move the party to a different location.  Aside from the rudeness of the staff, I was frustrated by the inaccessibility of the managerial staff and the lack of any email, phone, or website with which to arrange and accommodate events. \u00a0Their odd hours also made it impossible to visit in person to check the schedule. \u00a0The manager, in a half-hearted effort to keep our business, gave us mixed messages about whether or not they could accommodate us before we eventually gave up and found somewhere else.  While their drinks are delicious and the aesthetic of the joint is quite cool, the ineptitude of the staff and the poor business model of mistreating paying customers in favor of corporate customers who have yet to appear leads me to STRONGLY DISCOURAGE PATRONAGE AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT.

Plus there's a side area just to the left of the door off the alley where you can order any drink you want (no menu) OR enjoy soft-serve from the machine. I especially like the leather wall covering and the velvet draping in that corner.  I also really liked the vibe in here. The bartenders are way cool and attentive, and happy to mix both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. They make a mean cucumber water! My friend's Moscow Mule was also spot on.

I loved Big before it closed and these are the same owners so no wonder the drinks and bartending are so perfect.   The bartender for Plus Plus, Joey, is so personable and remembered my name for the whole night (I'll be impressed if he still know it when I come back to visit). My first drink had mint and ginger per my preferences and my second drink was a bit crazier with lot of rosemary and egg whites (both had gin). The drinks were $12 each (less than Big's pricing I think) and so worth it.   Even the bathrooms are cool - 4 single toilet rooms for anyone to use and a beautiful communal sink. The bar is cash only but they have the fanciest ATM I've ever seen.  They are currently open Tuesday through Saturday and Joey will apparently be bartending at Plus Plus every night - yay!

I went on a Saturday night and it wasn't very crowded at all - our group of six had no problem finding seating. Maybe Oddjob just haven't taken off yet as a prime SOMA watering hole.

He makes use of really unique liquors, fresh herbs, and ingredients you'd never think would taste good in a cocktail (rhubarb..? Yes, and it was delicious).   When I had my drink, I thought it was the best of the night - I then said the same about every drink I tried afterwards! I think my favorite was one where my friend said she liked \"ginger and sour\". It was light, refreshing, herby, and had a twig of thyme sticking out of it. It's on the left in this photo: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oddjob-san-francisco?select=sPU84NAWsijEhOUUTssu6Q#sPU84NAWsijEhOUUTssu6Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/oddj\u2026</a>  I also like that every single drink comes in its own unique cocktail glass! I don't think I saw a single glass repeated in my group that night, and between us we got maybe 9 or 10 drinks.  Be patient though - it's a pretty long wait to get your drink: there's one bartender serving a room full of eager customers. But it's only because he puts so much perfection into each drink. He's also really good at keeping track of who's been waiting the longest, so no need to jostle your way to the bar.  The bartender seemed to be friends with several customers, too. That, or he is just extra good with making friends! We caught him doing fun dance moves several times, and we made friends at the bar as well - everyone's just chill and in a good mood here.  At 8:15pm, the front room was very crowded. The back room (much smaller) had 10 or so people around the bar, and the small tables against the wall were empty so my group claimed them. We stayed until about 10:30pm - by then the front room was completely empty and the crowd had swelled and died to about 6-8 people in the back room.

I almost did not want to write this review because i don't want a lot of people to know about this place and crowd it up ;) but that would not be fair now would it, so here!  We went in on a Thursday night around 7pm to get a drink before dinner. It wasn't very crowded so we were able to sit at the bar and talk to Joey, the bartender. But I can see how things can get busy as the night goes by and there truly is only standing room for you. The SRO is tiny, very very tiny.  The Drinks - You tell Joey what you like/don't like and he will whip up a concoction for you. You will see herbs and some fruits on the counter that you can ask him to incorporate in the drink. I was feeling like dark rum and thats all i told him. He made a dark rum, almond something, ginger something, something else something else ( he told me there were a bunch of other things in there that i don't remember) drink for me which was perfect! It would have been a tad sweet for me on another day but i did not mind it that day. My colleagues were happy with their drinks as well. A drink will cost you $16, which some might think is a little expensive but you are paying for the experience and a drink that is custom made for you. I thinks it is worth it. Joey - We were lucky to be sitting at the bar and since it wasn't that crowded yet he was able to give us more attention. He is great at navigating you through the process if you are not sure what you want. If you don't like your drink, he will make another one for you, he did make another one for my friend when she did not like her original drink.  We were very pleased with our experience here, I cannot wait to go back and try more.

Pick a name you guys! But it's a bar within a bar). I've never met a bartender as vain as Joey which is fine since his drinks are good, but lets lower the ego please. He kept asking me how his drinks were every few seconds, needing his ego to be fed. Kept on bragging how he never tries his drinks because he knows it's perfect (yeah right...saw him testing a few drinks..what a hypocrite). Anyway, I wouldn't have been so upset with all his annoying narcissistic self if he wasn't such a SNEAKY LITTLE RAT!   We were getting ready to go but we decided to have one more drink to share. Joey tried to convince us to drink more but we told him we had an early day tomorrow. Right before we were about to finish our drink Joey gives us another one and told us to try it. Once again we told him it was good since his ego was starving for attention. Once we finished we asked for the bill and the bill came out to be $64 for four drinks. I was in shock because I didn't expect to pay for four drinks when I ONLY ordered three. Also didn't expect his drinks to be $16 each since he just used Bulleit, which is an average whiskey and nothing special. On yelp everyone was saying the drinks were $12 (was there an inflation within a week time frame?!?!) Drinks were good but not $16 good. Drinks weren't as customized as he said. Joey made the exact duplicate for the person who came right after I finished my first drink and the same drink AGAIN for the next group that came in. He says it's a menu-less bar because he customizes everyone's drinks but everyone ends up with the SAME drink.   The price wasn't the kicker for me even though I thought it was ridiculously over priced. The thing that I was pissed off about was that Joey Picchi snuck a drink on us. We never ordered the extra drink and if your going to give us a drink we didn't ask for I am going to expect it's complimentary. \u00a0I didn't like his tactics and schemes. The main reason I came here was because I'm a fan of Big. I heard Big and Jones Bar teamed up to form Oddjob. Later I learned that Big isn't associated with this place. I wonder why...could be because of \u00a0dishonest people like Joey Picchi. I wouldn't want to work with shady people either.  Minus Joey Picchi \u00a0would have made this a great place.

I can imagine that the smaller bar area would be great for a private party, and I intend to try it out.  Three stars because drinks are pretty pricy (cocktails around 12-14) and I'm not a regular enough to appreciate it all. Also, the bartender made three cardinal sins on my Vesper (ratios, ingredients, manner of chilling), which I'd expect any Bond bartender aficionado to know well.",

I've had many ,many drinks from him, (we're regulars at the last bar he worked at.) His drinks are always totally \u00a0balanced, and his memory for faces and names is remarkable.  We miss him being in our 'hood, but he's so incredible, he needed to spread his wings.  He is a total sweetheart, even when he's slammed, he's still charming. His drinks never disappoint. He makes the best classic drinks, but at SRO leave yourself in his hands. You will be blown away by what he comes up with.

Shortly after, a waitress came by with a beer, wine, and cocktail menu for each of us. We all ordered cocktails, which were brought relatively quickly. The waitress noticed that one of my friends didn't particularly enjoy theirs, and graciously offered to take it off the check and bring another drink instead!  Fantastic attentive staff here, and it's a breath of fresh air to be able to grab seats and not be shoulder to shoulder trying to order drinks. The only downsides I have to say about this place are that the cocktail are a little pricey ($12-16), and it is currently cash-only, though there is an ATM, and I believe the waitress mentioned they are working on getting their credit card system going. Maybe they're a new, undiscovered hidden gem, but as long as things are the way they are now, I would happily return here time and time again.",

It was not busy only 6 people at the specialty bar besides us and open tables and two bartenders at the other regular bar and about 12 people there. We waited 35 minutes and she still hasn't prepared our drinks so we thought she forgot, reminded her and she said we were next as she said she had only two drinks to make. At 1:30am, 60 minutes after placing our drink order, the bartender said,\"it's last call and i won't have time to make your drinks\". We were at the bar observing her and she was super lazy and inefficient. We then presented this to the manager a male with bleached blonde hair who was intoxicated/high and he did not help us. The manager sad it's his birthday and was more interested in partying. He said the bartender was sick so perhaps we are lucky she didn't prepare our drinks as we all may have been sick too as we watched her prepare drinks and touch fruit and fresh ingredients with her hands. We used to go to this bar when it was at a different location called Big. The bartender and manager this night were apathetic and have a poor impression. I hope the owner reads this as its a great concept just poorly managed!!",

    "review_text": "This is this the first Yelp post I have ever written and I will shamelessly plug that it is because of Joey, tender of the bar at SRO (Standing Room Only).   A friend and I started our night at the SF Ballet, where the kid sitting behind her kicked her chair through the entire first act. Needless to say, we were ready for a drink following the performance and I happened to recall Oddjob from searching for craft cocktail bars shortly after moving to San Francisco. Good food, drink and hospitality are like an art to me. I feel I can be both a fair and harsh critic.  Anyway, I was feeling like treating my friend to some craft cocktails so we ended up at Oddjob.   Firstly, It's important to note that you can only enter Oddjob from the door off of Washburn. The door off of Mission is always locked; exit only. I don't believe there is a sign noting that it is Oddjob, It's simply the first building on that corner at Washburn and Mission.  Secondly, it's CASH ONLY! Conveniently, there is an ATM inside on the way to the restrooms but if the three dollar service fee really grinds your gears then, sadly, this isn't the place for you. It's not cheap but you get what you give. Well worth any cost, in my opinion.  I immediately was taken in by the interior which is subtle, yet gorgeous. The cloth draped across the ceiling over the leftmost bar, the vintage lighting, and the paneled walls all make this place seem like a secretive speakeasy. I'm sure the unrevealing exterior helps, too.   I found the staff extremely friendly and approachable. If you want a personalized experience, don't come at a busy time. The staff has more time to make your experience shine this way and this really applies to any establishment.  This place actually has two bars: SRO and Oddjob. \u00a0  Joey, who was bartending SRO, offered some craft cocktails my friend and I couldn't refuse. He challenged our palates with flavors we wouldn't normally choose and we had a riot forming sudden inside jokes with anyone in earshot. I would say \"chef de libations\" would be a more suiting title for Joey than \"bartender\". Maybe that sounds pretentious but I don't really care. :)  We'll certainly be coming back as we've had unforgettable drinks and even made some friends along the way.",

The decor is gorgeous, drapery and an old-school chandelier; decent air-conditioning and plenty of room to perch around the bar.  They make decent cocktails. The drinks are somewhat -gimmicky foams with lots of arbitrary ingredients and pairings. (\"Have you *ever* had mint tea in Morocco? What about 'lapsang souchong' in Hong Kong? Well *I have* and it tastes like this...\" etc.) Under the veneer, the drinks were crowd-pleasing with a lot of forward sweetness and misbalance on those bitters he bought at Cask.  The drinks are four stars, but the service is generally poor. Joey is absolutely desperate to be at the center of attention, every moment you spend at SRO. He even interrupted our host's toast. Keep it classy, SRO.  Joey also intentionally \"challenges\" drinkers by pouring them precisely what they did not order. I would be more accommodating if we were in Topeka or The Marina, or even The Mission now-a-days... However this was a group of cocktail-knowers, which makes the pretense not just rude but a little pathetic. When my friend in the hospitality industry says \"no brown liquor,\" it is not because she lacks understanding. She has a plethora of reasons to prefer a clean, timely gin or white Irish whisky.  It's all a bit much, and there are a zillion places in town that do better cocktails without the pretense. (Third Rail, Trick Dog, Bourbon &amp; Branch, Range.) Sure, you might not get the quirky glassware -- but on the other hand, elsewhere you might end up with a balance of flavors, one that understands the customer and the underlying base liquor.",

Once you enter the interior design is really quite stunning and it is a total transformation of what was there before. Filled with cool art and interesting furnishings. There is also a very unique set of toilets with a hallway next to it that also doubles as a photobooth. Hmm that sounds like it could be creepy but it is actually brilliant.  But what gets Oddjob 5 stars from me is the fact that everyone behind the bar has a really great attitude. Although it was my first time there it quickly felt like I was a regular! To top it off the barmaid (Cali was her name, not sure of spelling) gave my friend a free shot upon hearing that we were all there celebrating that he had finally beaten cancer.

This becomes evident when you hear the remarks of the crowd and how people express their undying love for the place. Any other time this would be considered weird, but after taking in vibe and having a sip of your drink it all makes sense.

He'll add a dash of essential oil or a spritz of smokey single malt scotch that compliments the drink in a way you never thought possible. He'll make you a twist on a trinidad sour with hibiscus-infused vodka (that he made himself, by the way) and god knows what else that's so good you'll want to bathe in it. (Or maybe that's just me...) \u00a0  What's more, Joey's a showman.

I don't know if this is a mix-up with what the bartenders were told to use and what was actually printed on the menu, but if it's not, the bartender should have asked if we were okay with Ketel One instead of Belvedere. Furthermore, one of our drinks tasted like sugar water with a hint of alcohol and the other one tasted like club soda with a tiny smidge of alcohol when you got to the end. I ended up wasting $24 for two drinks that were barely drinkable so I definitely won't be coming back.",

    "review_text": "Well, they got the name right least. \u00a0This place does an odd job of making you feel welcome. \u00a0I was completely shocked that the owners of such powerhouses like Mighty and Public Works would have such a terrible staff (especially management and security) working this bar.   The bartender in the smaller room was the only one that seemed to care about good service but he takes forever to make a round, and the bar gets backlogged quick. \u00a0 Aside from that, they made a fundamental error trying to book a private event for Air BnB at peak hours on a Saturday night. We came with a group of over 20 people and picking Odd Job as a starting point for our night out was a big mistake. \u00a0They seem to have no idea how to run a bar and simultaneously have a private event. We kept getting herded around like cattle, interrupting our conversations, making us pick up all our jackets, drinks etc. to only move 4 feet, and be asked to move again in 5 minutes. \u00a0It was ridiculous.  The manager offered us the back booths in the room since we had such a large group, but he failed to communicate this to security and staff properly to avoid us constantly being ushered around while being verbally harassed. No matter where we stood, we were asked to move again. (Apparently we were still too close to the large room that was completely empty at this point and that was unacceptable). The door guy was a total as*hole to us, and after being continuously harassed by him and the hostess, we looked to the manager for help in stepping in to follow through with his promises. Instead he stood aside quietly letting this all go down.   We were not rowdy, or rude, and simply wanted to give them our MONEY. Instead, we rounded up everyone and left, feeling insulted and collectively agreed it's not worth the 20 minute wait each round for an \"artisan\" cocktail and crappy service to ever come back. \u00a0  The cocky door guy dared me to leave a bad Yelp review, as he explained that the place was going to be a huge success--so here it is, jack-ass.",

    "review_text": "I was a big fan of Big before it closed, so hearing that they were involved with Oddjob was exciting news. Last Friday I finally got a chance to swing by, and the place has promise.  The space is actually divided into *two* bar areas: to the right, a pretty large one with several bartenders, a cocktail menu, and lots of little tables &amp; seating in the form of cushioned benches and also smaller chairs that can easily be moved around; and to the left, a much smaller bar with only one bartender &amp; a bunch of bar stools. This smaller area is supposed to be like Big was--ie, no menu; you just tell the bartender what kind of thing you want, and s/he creates it for you on the fly. (BTW, be prepared to wait at the smaller off-menu bar if it's even a little crowded; it's one guy/girl making individualized, custom drinks for like 20 people, so it's not really fair to complain about how long the drinks take. If you're in a rush, order off the menu at the larger bar.)  The Pros: * Easily walkable from BART * Spacious * Plenty of seating * Lots of bar space at the big bar * Interesting, well-made drinks * Options (nice, safe menu drinks or choose your own adventure) * Friendly bartenders who really, really want to make you something you'll enjoy  The Cons: * LOUD. Even sitting right next to my friends, we had to shout to hear each other. Maybe get some sound baffling going? It didn't seem like there was any, so that might help. * Cash only. Not a huge deal as there is an ATM, but just FYI. * All the drinks I tasted (four custom, two from the menu) were *ever* so slightly too sweet. This is a solvable problem at the off-menu bar; next time I'll just have to remember to emphasize that I like a dry, spirit-forward cocktail &amp; by &amp; large disdain the sweet ones.  Overall I was pleased &amp; enjoyed things, so I'll definitely be back.",

I was in the mood for some quality cocktails after dinner in the city and Oddjob killed it. \u00a0My bro and I ordered a couple rounds between us and every concoction blew me away. \u00a0From the balance in the Nolet's based Sassafras to our bartender's original Henchman that exploded on the palate with cola, mint, black licorice, orgeat, cedar, etc., it was a fine imbibing experience.  Our bartender, Anthony, was a pleasure to chat with as well and even hooked it up with some hummus to go with our drinks. \u00a0How beyond legit is that?  While the prices are certainly on the steeper side, the creativity and skill are there in spades and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",

    "review_text": "Small space but with great drinks and a very enthusiastic bartender (the night we went at least). He was the type to ask about flavor profiles and mix something up based on your response. That might be a hit-or-miss technique for some, but it really worked out for me. He whipped up a variation of an Old Fashioned that was really yummy. Unfortunately I forget the whiskey he used. My friend wanted protein and smokiness; the result was a smoky egg-white concoction that was absolutely delicious. My sister had a super light, refreshing, and citrus-y cocktail. She's hard to please when it comes to spirits, so that really says something. The fact that all our drinks were so customized and everyone was happy with them makes Oddjob worth checking out.  The ambiance was really chill and half the space was taken up by a private party; however since we were rather early (~10 pm) the bar area was not overly crowded and there were side tables for us to occupy. I noticed it getting more crowded as we were about to leave, so they definitely can generate an audience.  Overall my impression of Oddjob is positive. It's a great place to grab drinks with a group of friends in a non-pretentious environment. Plus the fact that it's in an area (SOMA) where the nightlife is not super concentrated makes it an underrated discovery.",

They're only featuring 4 or 5 cocktails at press time, but they can craft anything your palate desires.  My adventures: delightfully odd. Within two minutes of walking in, I was persuaded to take a shot of lower-grade whisky. I don't drink whisky straight, but this handsome patron was particularly convincing.

Joey does just that. You say what you like. What you don't. What mood you're in. And then *poof* a magical concoction appears in front of you in beautiful glassware. He explains what unique drink he's created for you and it's like...drinks and a show. Plus he's hilarious. Like visiting a friend's house. A friend who can make a REALLY REALLY great drink.  This is a place where you taste the love and passion that was put into making the drink. You savor. You appreciate. And you think about what you want to try next.  Note, it's about $16 bucks a drink. So if you're just looking to get trashed, you can go to a place that's less good and less pricey. Also, that means you won't be taking up one of the precious seats. So more room for me!",

The concoctions you made last night had too many sophisticated ingredients for me to recall (mins the Mongolian horse wine which was elusive and surprisingly tasteful) but every step of your art was sprinkled with craftsmanship, precision, and love.

There are two bars, one is much smaller and intimate, great for small parties. The opposite side of the bar is the main space, dim lighting, craftsman style and a bar filled with a plethora of Whiskeys, Gin, and pretty good selection of unique tequilas.  The bartenders are friendly, attentive and willing to craft any cocktail to your pleasing. There is nothing I trust more then two dudes in plaid shirts with their sleeves rolled up. And bushy beards to shake up a tasty cocktail for me.   Downside of this bar is it is CASH ONLY, and for the times it is frustrating because who carries cash for cocktails that average $14?! It's understandable for divey bars with $7 cocktails but not a place with this type of class! They have an ATM available but you will be charged an extra fee to pull out cash.   Drink Highlights: Honey Rider: Bourbon, apreol, honey and lemon. This drink highlights the mix between sweet and sour, and is refreshing at the end. The Bourbon marries all the flavors to make this a tasty drink that satisfied the Bourbon/Whiskey lovers thirsty palate.",
