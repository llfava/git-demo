    "review_text": "One word to describe Brunos Pizzeria: DELICIOUS!   I have been watching this place develop over the last couple of weeks and it recently opened. I went here for the first time this weekend and they had the most amazing pizza, or at least the one I tried was amazing. I was in a group of four people and we ordered an XL DC Mustang pizza. It was the perfect size for four people to leave satisfied. This was barbecued chicken pizza and usually I am not a fan of chicken on pizza, but I loved this one. They have found the perfect balance between sweet and spicy.   As for prices, I think that it is average, maybe even a little on the cheaper side. The owner, Bruno, is very friendly and is more than happy to answer questions or take care of any requests that you have. He is also open to suggestions. I really hope this place makes it because it really is darn good pizza. Definitely check this place out if you are in the mood for pizza, you won't be disappointed.",

It's a very cozy atmosphere which is nice because it doesn't get too loud and they have a wide selection of wines. \u00a0  Four people and only about 40 dollars for an extra large pizza and a bottle of Souvignon. \u00a0Pretty reasonable for SF. \u00a0 Bruno was very friendly but almost too friendly, he should just let the waiters do their job but i guess since it is new he's probably worried it won't pick up, but I'll definitely be back.",

The pint prices are reasonable at $3.60 on the regular menu. I ordered the calamari to go with my beers. It was the first time I didn't finish this appetizer. Happy hour would be a better bet, since I paid $9.95 for a small (i mean small) basket of flavorless \"calamari.\" I was hoping for golden brown and delicious. I went here with a group because Fillmore Art Walk advertised Bruno's and a couple of other places had specials all night long.

    "review_text": "To be honest, the food here can be quite good. The customer service, is, well...DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM THEM!!!! Ever!!!  The owner decided to leave me a voicemail saying that they will no longer deliver to this address. When I pressed him for answers he said that he has had too many problems with our location. He cited reasons such as the location is too hard find, no one picks up their phone, etc. So...let's get the real story here.  When we order from Bruno's we tell them the exact building number. We also specifically mention that they need to ring the doorbell to be buzzed in. The owner said that is too complicated and hard to remember for his drivers. REALLY?? Go to a specific building and ring the doorbell? That's too complicated??? Wow, postal carriers should be given much more respect, perhaps they should even be in the running for a Nobel Peace Prize. They have to go to many addresses and also on occasion have to ring the doorbell. Remember, this is a very complicated thing to do. Way, way complicated. We are talking Postdoctoral material to understand how to find a building number and ring the doorbell.   Oh, wait, I can't be too snarky because he did mention that NO ONE even knows where are building is when the drivers ask. Hmm, well this hospital has only been around for 75 years so perhaps that is understandable. The majority of the employees average 15 years or more. Surely they could not have known about this secret building because you must have worked here for over 20 years to find our building. The large black numbers on the side of the building are a secret code that can only be deciphered by those who understand Arabic numerals.   In our \"conversation\" I also explained that in the past the driver never had a problem finding and delivering food. I was told that it was not always the same driver because he has 7 drivers. I made the suggestion that maybe the competent driver could explain to the other drivers how to find and deliver the food properly. The moment of silence indicated to me that the owner wasn't too keen on the idea. Perhaps only a single driver can be \"THE ONE\".   Before this order (which the owner just flat out canceled) the driver took over 2 HOURS and still did not deliver our food. And the driver did not even call. My understanding is that before you are accused of never answering your phone you have to be called first. Maybe I am just being old fashioned. I guess I should have checked my Facebook page or Twitter feed first to see if the driver was lost.  So, some helpful hints. Let's say you work in the Transamerica building. If you place an order at Bruno's you cannot just tell them the Transamerica building, the one that looks like a pyramid. Perhaps there are many unknown pyramid buildings in San Francisco. I suggest instead you create a short video with you walking around the Transamerica building and then upload it to Youtube. When you place the order, not only give them your name and number but reference the Youtube link as well.   Bruno's, get your #@$&amp;!! together. You have just lost the potential orders of an entire hospital. Way to go.",

It's the little details that make it a very likable place for beer and nibbles. *note this review has nothing to do with pizza.   But yes the HH deal is pretty sweet - Beers under $3 and half off apps. Pick from a fairly wide range of taps from Dogfish IPA to Pacifico to Guinness and more. What is most impressive for me is that Bruno's has pretty much the right glass for each beer on tap. Yes even Pacifico has a specific glass. That was news to me.   I had a couple of Dogfishes <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/33Lat5fr1lNY8RqjLQU4LQ?select=_M0Qf0xM3amySJZHiWCD3w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/33La\u2026</a> (in the proper glass of course) and an order of the fried calamari <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/33Lat5fr1lNY8RqjLQU4LQ?select=QlLhqM6wuPjtwjaS_CH3Rg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/33La\u2026</a>. The calamari was fresh, fried to a nice golden brown crisp, and not too oily which was nice. I really enjoyed finding bonus onion rings in the pile. At half off, it was a steal.   To top it off, service here is friendly and attentive. Special kudos to the bartender who was pregnant but still seamlessly on top of things.

The charms of this place lie somewhere in the deep, rich color of the wood used to construct their bar and the pictures of jazz legends like Duke Ellington that pay homage to the neighborhood. \u00a0There is a dash of sophistication in the decoration that adds a thin cosmopolitian veneer over what otherwise reminds me of a million other pizza joints I ate in when I grew up in the midwest.  The food followed a similar trend. \u00a0We tried the spaghetti with meatballs (a staple of a good pizza joint) and the burger because they spiced it up with saut\u00e9ed red peppers. \u00a0Everything was solid. \u00a0Both were well executed. \u00a0Both were missing a little something to set them apart from the memories I have from my youth.  Our waiter was fantastic. \u00a0He was attentive and genuinely interested in our dining experience. \u00a0He asked specific questions like if the burger was cooked to taste and he ran after us when I absent-mindedly left my sunglasses on the table. \u00a0Both little things that make a big difference. \u00a0It just felt like he cared.  The bathroom, as mentioned at the beginning, warrants a note thanks to the excellent decoration, spaciousness, and use of a water-saving dual flush toilet! \u00a0Thanks for being water conscious!

I wasn't sure if I should purchase the deal because there are just so many pizza places in San Francisco, but now I'm really glad I did!  The pizza was very good and very inexpensive. What impressed me most was the extensive selection of VERY high quality microbrewed beers on tap for extremely reasonable prices ($2.75). Even DogFish Head 90 Minute IPA, which runs $3 a bottle in liquor stores! The service was friendly and the atmosphere cool, unpretentious, and fun. The coffee afterwards was really great too. The entire meal was very economical, and would have only run $40 for 2 people who ordered a large pizza with many toppings, a starter salad, 4 beers, and 2 coffees. Where else can you find that value in SF?  I recommend Bruno's to anyone who likes pizza, pasta, or alcohol. Hopefully that's everyone. So what are you waiting for? Go to Bruno's!",

The tomatoes looked liked the ones that they put on a subway sandwich, pink not red and they were not roma tomatoes or something colorful and full of flavor like a vine ripened tomato. I make this pizza and I make it much better. Also got the mozzarella appetizer, again mediocre. Then the Caesar salad.

We were seated right away, had a nice comfortable booth. \u00a0The place is pretty small overall- I think I read that maximum occupancy is 48 people, they have a few booths and then some high tables and the bar area. \u00a0We ordered a pizza and bottle of wine. \u00a0They had a decent wine selection (nothing super fab, but all very formidable choices)- and not over priced like many restaurants do with bottles of wine! \u00a0Service was prompt and the pizza was excellent- the secret is always the sauce and if a pizza place has good sauce- then the pizza is usually pretty good- YES, the pizza was great! \u00a0We were too filled to try the desserts- but they did have several choices that were appealing including a home-made tiramisu. \u00a0  Menu overall had pizza and various pasta dishes, some fish dishes, chicken and steak. \u00a0The owner circulates around and asks how you are, how is your meal, etc. \u00a0He has a very thick authentic Italian accent and appears he likes to flirt with the ladies..you know the Italian charm.  Overall, thought this place was great- only drawback and reason for 4 stars instead of 5, it did get a bit noisy in there for a small place. \u00a0But as for service and food- both get 5 star rating from us! \u00a0We now know in the future if we have another concert to attend at the Fillmore, we'll park at the Garage (Fillmore Center)- or something like that- but it's right next to this restaurant and we'll dine here again!",

However, we went in a few weeks ago not feeling like pizza and ordered a pasta and eggplant parmesan. We ended having a chicken parmesan delivered to our table but it was so cheese covered that I didn't notice at first, and the two people I was sharing it with ate most of it before I realized it was NOT eggplant parmesan. Both dishes also tasted like the \"Eye-talian\" food of my youth - mushy, over sauced, over salted and bland. As Tony Soprano would have said, \"You know what I mean...May-o-nnaise.\" When I mentioned that we got the wrong dish the waitress finally came back and said she'd give us 10 percent off without me having to ask, so that was something.

Apparently the driver was saying he tried calling us twice, but we had no missed calls on our phones and no one even tried the buzzer, we even went out front to smoke for 15 minutes. The man handling the phones was rude I guess (I didn't speak with him at that time), and tried blaming us.   Once our food arrived we had to reheat everything and it just wasn't very appetizing. I called back about 5 minutes after the drop off to get a discount which they were nice enough to take $10 off for us. Something was weird though, when I called he said that the driver had already made it back there from dropping off our pizzas.... and that he needed to talk to him so he put my on hold, haha it's weird because there's no way it takes 5 minutes to make it from our location to theirs, so I don't know what he was talking about.

    "review_text": "Part of me wants to come back and see if this place can improve, and part of me already thinks that this is what the review would be if I came back again to try different things on the menu.   My friends actually chose this place to try out, as we all live about 2 blocks away. We were warmly greeted by 2 people, and they sat us quickly and gave us menus. I think that they are trying to be clever and reorient the menu to a landscape style, but it really takes up too much space at the small round tables that most of the restaurant is made up of.   The big gripe I have about this place is that it is WAY overstaffed. I don't know if Bruno (the alleged owner's name) is extremely optimistic, but I needed two hands to count the number of wait staff in the place, and there were only 3 tables with customers around. It makes for having 3 different people come over and check on you, which gets to feel like a mixture of both overwhelming and annoying. There were times when I felt like we spent more time telling them everything was OK rather than just consuming food or talking. The bread came out first, and parts of it were undercooked, and came away doughy. The eggplant soup was just OK. It seemed to want to be both creamy and healthy at the same time, and it just couldn't make up its mind which. I was grateful that it wasn't over salted though.  They are accommodating with their menu items, taking the peas out of my risotto (that's one star alone), and making the pizza my friends wanted without pesto, and with red sauce instead. That took a little bit more explaining, but we managed it all in the end.   The risotto, even pea free was meh. The rice wasn't cooked properly, and it got that gooeyness that comes with the lack of skill that it takes to make risotto. It's why I picked the dish actually - to see if they could actually make it properly. The grilled chicken in it offset the texture of it nicely, though the mushrooms didn't help the gooeyness.   One of my friends HATED the pizza, but I think that was because it felt too healthy to her. She likes Extreme Pizza down the block, which I think explains her terrible taste in pizza. Her wife liked it, and I agreed. It tasted very fresh, and there was a good crust : sauce : \u00a0toppings ratio going on. I would definitely consider making this place a pickup/takeout place for pizza, since it is so close to home.   We ditched dessert, mostly because all three of us were a little weirded out by the abundance of servers in the place. It made it feel crowded and empty at the same time. I don't know if I would want to come here again more because of that.   Place does have a bar, but I couldn't tell if it was a full one, or if they just served beer/wine. They do have a flat screen TV though, and an open kitchen. I hope this place can find its footing, and figure out exactly what it wants to be (and how many servers they want to have).   Best of luck, Bruno's. I hope you make it as a decent pizza place in my 'hood.",

Bruno's is new to the hood, so I thought I would check it out to see, in an off chance, if the pizzeria had a hamburger. Indeed it does! And, even better, it allows for online ordering. This may sound lazy, but I feel like getting to order online:  1. Lowers my stress of having to deal with stupid telephone conversations where one person can't hear because the restuarant is too loud 2. Cuts down on the human error on the order-taker side. Mistakes will mainly be mine.  I order my burger, and run off to pick it up. Of course, it starts raining the moment I hit the streets, but oh well! I arrive to Bruno's with a few minutes to spare, and the folks there let me know several times that my burger would be right up. I must have looked in a hurry or something... I was perfectly content sitting someplace warm to watch the NCAA game on their big TV.  I know this is a pizza place, but the burger? Let's just say I will be going back again for this bad boy. Big, juicy, with some sort of spice in the meat (it has a chipotle sauce, but I think there is something in the meat, as well) that makes it a little different, and delicious tasting. The serving of fries was so ample I couldn't finish -- a first for me! All for under 10$.  The place was pretty empty -- but I hope to see it fill up soon. This area needs good, reasonably-priced food. And you get a discount as a Club One or ZipCar member. I'll definitely be back again soon!",

This was not simple, this was completely lack-lustre.  I got the Cajun Chicken salad. It was entirely absent flavor, and even more so, absent lettuce. The chicken seemed like a previously frozen Costco patty. It lacked flavor, had a degenerated texture &amp; was entirely unappetizing.   My mister got the Italian Sausage sandwich and his face turned from anticipation to disappointment the second our plates were placed before us. The boy loves sandwiches. *loves*. And it does sadden me to see him unable, or rather, unwilling to finish a meal. The link wasn't Italian Sausage, so much as it was a boring hot-dog. It was completely hidden by a way-too-large hard bun, but surprisingly not covered with sauce. As if you even had to ask, the fries were mediocre as well.

At one point, I had a very solid \"Good\" rating from him of Golden Boy but the elusive perfect pie stayed at bay. But like all happy and good things, we made the \"GREAT PIZZA\" discovery when we were least expecting it or seeking it out.  At the suggestion of the woman who waxes my eyebrows (thus making her an expert in things I love, natch), we gave the new Bruno's on Fillmore a try on Sunday. Suffering the lingering effects of a REALLY fun Saturday night, we went to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfbrunos.com&amp;s=4af7dc15dd61e13e8648208f25e379196b5c3fb5912b1c342294a1b2426148ab\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sfbrunos.com</a> and placed an order for pizza, calzone, spaghetti, buffalo wings and tiramisu (Don't judge! It was supposed to be lunch and dinner!!). Everything we ordered was fantastic. \u00a0Their pizza is the right blend of savory sauce, perfect crust and authentic pepperoni...the very pizza that you find in every nook and cranny on the East Coast but which only often exists in your imagination on the West Coast. The calzone was stuffed with fresh ingredients and the crust is an herb garlic buttery shell that could stand completely on its own.  Delivery is quick and easy and prices are on the low side for pizza and a little on the spendy size for pasta so order both and they will balance each other out!  We haven't yet dined in at the restaurant, but I've driven by several times and it is new and looks lovely - they even have iron tables with crisp tablecloths lining the sidewalk in front...you might think you were in Rome were it not for the Fillmore hustle and bustle all around you. Ok, maybe Rome is a stretch. \u00a0You might think you were in North Beach, were it not for the housing projects in the background??  Great Pizza.",

    "review_text": "Eh... mediocre pizza. We ordered a large that was half \"margherita\" and half \"Sonoma spinach chicken.\" Pizza margherita to me does not me regular cheese pizza with a couple sliced tomatoes on top. It was average-at-best cheese pizza.  The Sonoma spinach chicken half was marginally better. It was somewhat spicy and included peppers, onions, olives, garlic, and (obviously) spinach and chicken.  We also ordered a spinach salad with goat cheese, almonds, and cherry tomatoes, and supposedly a raspberry vinaigrette. I don't normally order salads at pizza places (cmon, did you really go there to eat something healthy?), but we had a $40 LivingSocial deal that we had to use in one sitting and the pizza was only about $20. It was too lightly dressed, but otherwise it was fine.  Bruno's has a good beer selection. I was pleased to see that they served one of my favorite beers, Dogfish Head 90. On the menu it was $2.75 for a half-pint, but on the bill it was $3.66. Not sure what the discrepancy was, but I didn't question it because we had the LivingSocial Deal that we just barely exhausted. Either way it wasn't a bad price.  I probably won't be back unless I'm really craving a beer and I'm not hungry.",

We were attracted by the giant banner that says \"2.75 drafts all the time\" Cheap booze was all we needed to keep us going...and a pizza. I ordered the cider, but, they had run out earlier that night. I got a bud light, my BFF got the dogfish head ale. We ordered a Hawaiian pizza which was hastily consumed. The only concern was the waitress was very slow in giving us our check. I mean, we had been done for about 20 minutes before she even came up to us to check. Then another 10 minutes to check us out. There was a large birthday party there that night, so maybe they were taking up a lot of energy. I'll give them another chance next time I'm around the area.",

Bruno's has highchairs and extremely friendly waitstaff. \u00a0The food is uneven--tonight we liked the ravioli but weren't wowed by the Chicken Fettuccine. \u00a0We frequently order the pizza, which is a good bargain, especially compared to Extreme up the street (the DC Mustang BBQ is our favorite). \u00a0They aren't breaking any new ground with the food; it's just a really nice place to spend a couple hours with friends, especially if you have a toddler in tow.  High chairs? \u00a0Yes. Changing tables? \u00a0 Nope. Stroller-friendly? \u00a0Fairly. \u00a0We can always find a place to stow it. Noise level? \u00a0Low in the early evening when we go. \u00a0In the evenings it heats up due to those bargain beers. General baby-friendliness? \u00a0High. \u00a0Literally everyone at Bruno's loves our baby.",

We lucked out in sitting next to a woman that worked for the architectural firm that designed the place, so we got a little history. The granite bar, dark red walls, darker red ceiling and lights make this a great date spot. It's also a perfect place to eat before an evening at Yoshi's. Besides the musical instruments on the walls, they also have large art pieces for sale. I do think $40,000 is a bit much for a painting with Charlie and Miles however.  We shared an Edge Iceberg Blue Cheese salad ($7.95). It had lovely dressing (and they brought us extra) large chunks of cheese, croutons, hearts of palm and sliced cherry tomatoes. I was practically licking the plate. Mz. Ann had a tagliatelle with ham, peas and an Alfredo sauce ($9.95). I thought the composition was lovely although the sauce could have been tastier. I had the chicken carcioffi with veggies ($12.95). The potatoes were exquisite - braised baby reds. The rest of the veggies were cauliflower, zucchini, broccoli etc that were steamed, a hair underdone, and somewhat lacking in flavor. Chicken breast was a little overcooked, but the sauce was lovely and complimented the artichokes well. We also had a bottle of Ruffino Chianti ($18.00) which is not a great wine, but for the price more than adequate. The waiter left the cork in the bottle after each pouring and I had to put it back, but that's a minor point. The waiters are some of the most drop-dead Italians I've seen in this city, and they pay attention to what you need. Overall, the price is very fair for the quality of the food, and not outrageous for the neighborhood. The wine list is a bargain.  I am definitely going back and look forward to adding a star when they get their groove on.",

We had been running around all day, so it's nice not having to cook and also check the new Pizza place nearby.  We ordered XL 1/2 &amp; 1/2 (Sonoma and Club One)  When I went to pick it up, I was greeted by a friendly lady at the front.  And a gentleman went back to the kitchen and brought my pizza.  We went home and opened the box and we saw only chicken, tomatoes and cheese on the pizza. So we thought that they made a mistake and made only the Sonoma part of it.  We didn't bother to call that night, too much of a hassle.  I called today Sunday night to tell them what happened - I had noticed that there was another receipt that came with the pizza showing a smaller size (large) and a different pizza; I guess somebody got our pizza.  A person who answered the phone was so rude.  He told me that I had ordered the pizza yesterday and I got the pizza, so there's NOTHING he can do!!!  He didn't even want to hear my story. What a customer service they have!!  Especially this is a new restaurant and trying to make it in this tough economy.  I was very disappointed and sad.  I don't like to write negative comments on Yelp, but I can't help it this time.  We go to Yoshi's and other restaurants nearby, trying to support the local businesses. Bruno's looks nice and the the menu is very affordable but............   Hope this comment helps Bruno's think about better customer service in the future. They definitely need better training.   As for the Pizza, it was OK. If you like lots of cheese, that's your place. On the other hand I didn't get to taste the pizza which we had ordered, with more vegetable..

It was a late night and my favorite pizza place was closed (Deja Vu), so I wanted a quick delivery, so I decied to call Bruno's which was fairly close..  I ordered the Sonoma Chicken pizza (i believe thats the name) which had baby spinach leaves, grilled chicken breast, olives, bell peppers, garlic aioli.. The pizza, wasnt half-bad, I've had waayy better (at Deja Vu). \u00a0I believe it was the pizza sauce that I really didn't care for because you really cant go wrong with toppings, but the grilled chicken breast tasted favorless also.. The cheese however was thick and rich with flavor!  The delivery was fast, prompt, and friendly...",

If you sit at the bar, they have the purse hooks I love so you can have your purse down by your knee. The bar is HUGE though, you can't tell just looking at it, but the seats are just a little low so you feel like a little kid.  The bartender was nice and there was good football on, so I didn't mind the little kid feeling behind the bar.",

    "review_text": "2.75$ pints all day !!! sweetness.  This is everything including the drink specials / beer cocktails. The beer selection is good I tell you. You can't go wrong serving Guinness, Dogfish Head, Stella, Fat Tire, Sam Adams, Old Rasputin, and cider. That's like an all star line up right there.  Our waitress was awesome. She was probably one of the best waitresses I've ever had. She would be over at our table in two seconds if we had made eye contact from across the room. That's good.  The pizzas were great too. It was thin and it did not get soggy. We shared a pizza with half of the bayou special on one side and bourbon street special on the other side. I liked both of them. The bayou special was not so salty like most pizzas with clam on it, which was nice. The cheese was not too thick and eating this pizza did not make me feel gross at all.  For three people, we got 4 beers and 1 large pizza. It came out to be about 12$ per person after tax and tip. That's pretty cheap for a nice sit down place like this I'd say. It does look a little on the pricey side, especially when you walk in, but it's definitely affordable and worth it.",

MY bf always comes here with his friends and they always love it.. I think it is more of a Pub with good food than a Pizzeria that serves beer. \u00a0I come here for drinks and it just so happends that they have edible pizza.. like its pretty dang good for being a bar.",

On the page, it said \"Free delivery!\" but after ordering, the receipt that popped up definitely said $3 delivery charge. That kind of false advertising irritated me so I called to ask and they said, \"Oh, we started charging in January. We will have to change our website.\" No offer to eliminate the delivery charge.  We got the food and it all tasted store-bought. The meatballs looked and tasted like frozen meatballs you can buy at Costco. The marinara sauce seemed like it was out of a jar. Not worth it. Order elsewhere or just make something at home.",

They can knock out a caesar salad and pizza in 15 minutes. \u00a0So this would be perfect for a 20 minute lunch for $10.  Dinner on the other hand is solid, especially before a show at the Fillmore. First, order the toasted ravioli. It's yummsters. Then finish off with one of their \u00a0pizzas. \u00a0Get beer, their sodas are kind of expensive.  Bruno's is an upscale pizza joint, with nice specialty pizzas.",

    "review_text": "Just ordered from Bruno's tonight for the first time (those pesky fliers DO work).  First off, good customer service. The girl who took my order didn't seem annoyed from the moment she answered the phone (as some other pizza places make you feel), repeated everything back to make sure the order was correct, etc. She quoted me 45 min for delivery. Maybe 30 min later received a call from the delivery guy confirming my cross streets and letting me know he'd be there in 5-7 minutes. MUCH appreciated since I have dogs that go crazy. I like to be able to meet the delivery guy at the main door to avoid chaos. Sure enough he was at the steps of my building in 5 minutes. Also very cheerful and pleasant!  Now to the food...I really do like the pizza! I ordered pepperoni, mushroom and garlic. The crust is on the thinner side, but wonderfully a little chewy. Generous with the toppings, especially the garlic. I love my garlic! I also ordered the garlic bread w/ marinara sauce. It was just ok. It's actually focaccia bread or some type of flat bread, not bad...but I guess I was expecting the traditional sourdough or something. \u00a0The \u00a0accompanying marinara sauce serving size was generous.  Great experience. Good pizza. Will definitely be ordering from here again.",

    "review_text": "This place was the most convenient restaurant for us to grab a bite to eat before a show at Yoshi's on a Saturday night. We tried to venture to Little Star a few blocks away and even Fillmore St Cafe (which did not have any seats, and we were not going to eat while standing) so we ended up here instead, but felt good about our fate.   The waitress, Quanie? was very sweet with her beautiful smile, watch out guys and gals, she is a cutie and a great server. She encouraged us to come in the restaurant and made recommendations for pizza. We ordered the Popeye's with spinach, pesto, feta and olives. Prices for the pizza were a little high, but the pizza was good to us.   Chicken sandwich was a good deal for under 9 bucks, with french fries. However, my only gripe was that they could have used a better roll for the sandwich (they used a cheap sesame burger bun).  The server also offered us free tastings of the spicy carrot soup, which was very savory. We even ordered some garlic bread with cheese (a little pricey at 4 bucks for two pieces), but the marinara was creamy and tomatoey which I liked a lot.   I wouldn't say this is a must go to place, but it is worth a stop if you happen to eat right before the show and are not in the mood for seafood at Yoshi's.",

It was on the late night , so it was only a few people inside.   We sat down at the bar and the bartender handed us our menus. We were excited to try some of the dishes they had to offer. I ordered the ravioli and my friend order a pizza. ( I forgot the exact name of the pizza ) We waited for 15 mins and our food was served.   First..... My friend couldn't believe her eyes. She thought she was getting punk. Her pizza didn't NOT look like the one in the menu. \u00a0So she tried it and spit it back out. She swore that they served her a DiGiorno frozen pizza. \u00a0SMH.  Second... I tried my ravioli and basically, I wasn't impressed. The ravioli stated that it came with spinach inside, so I assuming fresh spinach. I was mistaken. It was frozen spinach. I had a few bites and then I couldn't eat it anymore.  Third.. the bartender was nice and all but not once did she check on us to see how are food was and if we needed anything else. She was too busy texting all dam night.   By this time, its only two customers left at Bruno's Pizzeria, so you would think they would have brought back our check in a timely matter. NOT the case! \u00a0I was just fed up after we didn't get our change back after 30 minutes.   Please find another place in the Fillmore to eat because Bruno's Pizzeria is not the place!   Please learn from my experience.",

I also have ordered the combo platter on many occasions, it's ok but not as good as it used to be, they now serve the wings as a fried wing they used to be served as juicy marinated hot wings. The cheese sticks are now thicker and harder to chew. Idk if they were being lazy because I ordered at about 12am but this place is starting to drop the ball a little.

    "review_text": "I basically live next to this place, and walk by it on the way to the bus stop. I'd check out the renovations each day, and wonder when it would open. After all, that block of Fillmore needs something better than Domino's.  My roommate and I went to check it out opening weekend. We admired the clarinets on the wall (former band nerds, what can you do) and started the buttery-squashy complimentary soup. Then the power went out. The manager hurriedly went out for candles, ultimately returning with a single 5\" stub. The kitchen staff tried to cook using the light of their iPhones. After 20 minutes and steadfastly cold ovens, we gave up our dream of Sonoma Spinach Chicken Pizza and sobbed into our Mexican food up the street.  We tried again one week later, for girls' night out for Valentine's Day. I have one vegetarian friend who also avoids dairy, onion, and garlic; finding a suitable restaurant with a wide array of salads can be *challenging*. But Bruno's came through; she enjoyed her salad, while the rest of us split that Sonoma Spinach Chicken Pizza, saving some for our post-Mission-bar-crawl late night snack. Mmm, ricotta.  I can't comment on too much of the menu, having tried exactly (1) item. But I did enjoy that pizza! My friends and I thought that, given the ambiance and quality of the food, prices were surprisingly non-shafty. I think total came to $8.50 per person! I think appetizers, salads, and the calzones (as entrees) were all *well* under $10.   Bonus points for accommodating our request and switching to the Cal-Stanford women's basketball game on the big TV. I am totally subtracting a star because Cal ended up losing. Come on, Bruno's, you should have stopped the Bears from fizzling in the second half!  Basically, I dig the food and I dig the prices. Also, I like whimsy, and there are some playfully named dishes on the menu, showing some love to Bruno's neighbors in the Fillmore Center. That's cool. I wish somebody named a pizza after me. Well, maybe not, because that would mean I ate a lot of pizza, and that doesn't fit in too well with my New Year's resolution. Anyway, I will definitely come here again and wish Bruno's well.",
