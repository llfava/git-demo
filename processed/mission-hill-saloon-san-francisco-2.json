The \u00a0Mardi Gras Fat Tuesday in March had Hurricanes, Hand Grenades and Sazerac's as the bar's drink specials. \u00a0(I looked on their Facebook page and it appears they are doing a Cinco de Mayo event as well). \u00a0It's a great place to go hang out, watch a game, and get merry if that's your thing, which it's mine.",

    "review_text": "In a spot that has endured many iterations -- Sadie's Flying Elephant, Mission Hill Saloon, the Unresolved Love Life Of Evelyn Lee -- this corner at Potrero and Mariposa is once again: Mission Hill Saloon. After just over a year under the ownership by the Thieves crew (Dear Mom, Thieves Tavern), Tony \"The Pope\" is back at the helm.  The horde of hipsters that used to cram in there seemed to have followed Evelyn out the door. That bar was simmering (but not busy) on a Thursday night but this is not a bad thing. The poor table remains in the back, a silent black and white film plays high above, and as always, posting up at a barstool is the place to be.  They have a lotta bourbon behind the bar, and thankfully chopsticks too so I could eat some Thai food while I sipped a Manhattan. There are a few beers on draft, but I neglected to note the selections. You'll just have to see for yourself.  Obligatory Title Pun: King of the HILL.  Menu Readability: I don't remember a menu. Is there a menu?  Need to mention: Cash only.  What this place teaches me about myself: There is only one kind of place where I don't mind sitting on a stool.",

I go here at least once a week these days!",

The crowd is definitely diverse but friendly. There's a jukebox, pool table, and ATM.",
