The Rouge Pale ale is really quite a nice beer. Only ate finger foods but they all seemed to taste like food (the cheese platter was golden) Place to sit, place to eat and drink... things work... perfectly placed in north beach just near washington square you can grab a nice coffee around the corner and then sneak around to the rouge and steal a pint... gold",

Just one of two micro-breweries/restaurants in North Beach, this place serves 20 of their locally-owned micro-brewery beers on tap. To see the selection of available beers, the bartender was very cool in allowing me to check out the cool knobs for each beers.   Dealing with a stressful work day, fatigueness and with an empty stomach, I started out with a Racer-5 IPA beer. With one huge gulp of one of their own in a pint glass, I was instantly \"in the groove\". And yes, my bartender noticed a \"red glow and pink cheeks\" on my face.   1st beer: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plIGvvIOAKiuCQybfnzSsQ?select=FZx-OoyalmESc_tjtumUkw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/plIG\u2026</a>  From the food menu, I had the Chicken Strips with fries. For $10.00, I get three pieces of chicken strips battered to golden brown and some fast food fries. Nothing too fancy about the food, but the food was good enough to hold me over until dinner.   My meal: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plIGvvIOAKiuCQybfnzSsQ?select=s8xvWXQ6LdHUzXkje-F6mw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/plIG\u2026</a>  After my snack, my second brew was the Morimoto Soba Ale. Named after obviously after the famous Iron Chef, the brew had a very unique herbal Green tea \u00a0aftertaste.   2nd beer: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plIGvvIOAKiuCQybfnzSsQ?select=VNJ0YetIS1mOWtJd6zE8oQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/plIG\u2026</a>  This place is not a bad place to hang out when you're in North Beach or taking a break from shopping in Chinatown, which is only three blocks away.   You can also purchased many of their beers, including the brews I had, at many gourmet markets throughout the Bay Area.",

During slow hours, take your pick, and during peak hours, it just takes a peek and miniature exploration to find something. (Nice outdoor area, great bar, lots of interior dining space).   The waiters are usually attentive and find you once you've sat down. Most importantly, they are always eager to describe both the house and the guest beers; I always feel comfortable asking questions. (You can never go wrong with the Oregasmic Ale or the Imperial IPA). Motto mention that both beer menus are extensive and varied; you can always find something to tickle your fancy.   The food is your basic, satisfying, heavy comfort food. You can find healthy menu items, but if you go to a pub looking for a healthy meal, you'll just have to close your eyes and pretend that your beer-battered onion rings totally count as a vegetable. (Their onion rings are delicious) Their black bean burger is very yummy; it's usually what I get. However they offer other dishes like sandwiches, mac and cheese, sausages, chili, large salads, Irish \"nachos,\" and other culinary stomach assaults.   Been here countless times, would go back countless times, great spot!",

The Rogue beer will do that to you. Not only is it tasty, but the waitress will help you pick the one you want and bring you as many as you want.   The burger was ok.

I've been enjoying Rogue beers for quite a while--I like them because they dare to be different. \u00a0Not all flavors are good, in fact some are straight up nasty like one of the original variations in those pink bottles, whatever that was called. \u00a0But some are out of this world, like their Double Chocolate Stout.  1. 4 beer flight: Good way to sample their beers, which will be hit and miss. \u00a0Variation in taste is huge, and many of theirs are love-it-or-hate-it types. \u00a0But I am sure there will be at least one that you will LOVE.  2. Kobe Tacos $11.95: Very good. \u00a0What can you say?--beef is well seasoned and very savory. \u00a0Probably best taco stuffing I've ever tasted. \u00a0Did being Kobe/Wagyu make a difference? \u00a0Probably not since the whole deal with those is the crazy marbling and tenderness, both of which would be rendered away cooking it this way. \u00a0But no matter what they used it was VERY good. \u00a08/10.  3. Rogue Chocolate Stout Hot Fudge Sundae $6.95: \u00a0Best sundae ever? \u00a0Quite possibly. \u00a0Check out the pics I included---look at the layers of textures and gooey craziness! \u00a0Beautiful complication of basic dessert. \u00a09/10.  As a bonus, this place wasn't stupid crowded like the others we had hit up. \u00a0Very nice environment to sit down and enjoy world-class beer, and eat some special yummy stuffs.

Bacon adorned mine and the whole thing was pretty good (even though it wasn't Kobe), I especially liked the yummy pickle spear that came with it. My biggest disappointment was the fries that were delivered to me were lukewarm. and not salted. I had like 2 and then just stopped eating them. You need good fries to go with a good burger, these were not good.  Miss V said her ruben was \"skinny\" but she seemed to enjoy it. I didn't ask her opinion of the above mentioned luke fries. Same goes for Hubster and TB who had burgers and fries.

Side Note: slowly but surely, my plan to review every establishment with the name Public House is happening (yes, I realize this is many since \"public house\" is just a name for a bar)!   I stopped by Rogue Ales Public House for some Sunday evening drinks and dinner. We sat outside in their enclosed patio, which was not very busy, but not empty. I've found it a bit hard to find places with good outdoor seating in the city, so their patio is a nice little oasis from bustling North Beach. It has cute little lights and a serve-yourself water cooler, which I actually thought was nice as I tend to guzzle water and hate to wait for refills.   I am not so familiar with Rogue's extensive beer list, all of which I believe are brewed by them at their Oregon-based brewery. Our server informed us that they were mostly out of their light beers, so I started with their cider. It was tasty, but in my opinion most ciders all taste the pretty much the same. I also tried the Buckman Ginger Pale, which was really amazing! Not overpoweringly ginger-flavored or dark. I will have a hard time getting another beer when returning here, but their list is so impressive I will have to force myself!  Unfortunately, I also had dinner here. I ordered the Kurobuta ham sandwich, which was described as a quarter pound of \"cuban-style\" ham with a honey dijon glaze. What I received was what looked like what I may have eaten for lunch in 2nd grade. It was pretty sad looking. Not much ham and yellow mustard on white bread...didn't taste bad but very unimpressive and nothing I would ever pay for again. I could make a better sandwich! It was supposed to come with pickles but I guess the kitchen forgot to put them on. However my server, who was awesome, noticed before I did and brought me some. It didn't help the sandwich much, but I did get a free drink for their mistake! The great service could almost make me overlook the underwhelming food. Almost.  I did also have the chance to try the fish and chips, which was made with Mahi...yum. It was much, much better than the sandwich, making me think that maybe I just mis-ordered. However I can only review what I did order! The fries, which came with the sandwich and the fish and chips (duh) were actually very good.  Despite the disappointing food, I will be returning to Rogue Ale Public House...just not to eat. 2 stars as a restaurant. 4 stars as a bar.",

I used to drop a couple hundred a month in this place back when they had the Honey Cream. \u00a0Then they stopped carrying a few of the beers. \u00a0The perpetual \"Oh we're out of that\" expanded to more and more beers. Then the menu change, staff changed, etc. \u00a0Went from one of my favorite spots to drink to me needing to stab someone to try to get a menu. \u00a0Food is pretty bad recently as well.  Trivia night is fun, but the bar tenders don't like making good on the free pints the trivia guy gives out, so make sure you use it immediately upon receipt.  Reviewing it because I stop in about every 4 months with the hopes that it has gotten better. Instead, I just keep reminding \u00a0myself why I don't spend 2 nights a week there anymore. \u00a0See you guys in September if you are still in business.",

How the staff manages to create such an awful experience for the patrons in such an otherwise beautiful neighborhood is almost impressive.  My boyfriend and I went on a recommendation from a friend, having never been blown away by their bottled beer, we had mid range expectations, but we were told the food was great. they lied.  we walked in, and were ignored by the bartender who was spending his time laughing and high fiving with the other staff members. there were three other customers in the place, and yet they still somehow did not have time to pay attention to us. after having to awkwardly interrupt his conversation to ask for a hostess to seat us \u00a0(as the sign instructed) we were told \"order at the bar and sit down\". \u00a0we then were ignored for another ten minutes before the bartender asked \"oh, did you want a menu?\" \u00a0after ordering we sat outside on their rather cute front patio dining area. just after our appetizer was brought, two of the staff members proceeded to sit at the table next to us and begin smoking and howling about something. we had to move four tables away. by the time our food arrived (which was really not very good by the way) we had finished our first round. the waiter stared at our empty glasses and turned around and went back inside without offering to refill them. he never came back out. not to bus, not to ask if we needed anything, not to give us our check. when my boyfriend went back inside to get another beer, he was again ignored at the bar.  midway through our sub-par meal, a kid with a dog walks by and his dog proceeds to poop right next to our table. not that this is the dog or the owners fault (we have a dog too, it happens) one of the rogue staffers (who is STILL smoking upwind from my table) gives me a look and tells me to \"lighten up, hes a dog\". I'M AWARE ITS A DOG YOU ASSHOLE! you know what? when a dog shits at my table im going to make a face. shit and food will never be an attractive paring. im also not finishing my meal because there's no coming back from that. we left grumbling and swearing off rogue beer.  we caught muni and went to City Beer Store (shout out!) and had a lovely time.   the moral of the story, kids: don't ever go to the rogue brew pub, go to city beer store instead.",

We were lucky to find 2 empty tables when we got there around 3 or 4pm, but there were no chairs, so we just went in and got 'em ourselves. Another customer suggested this (from experience, I assume/hope) and no one seemed to care so I guess it's okay to do that?  Anyhoo, we weren't sure if there was an outside server so we ordered our drinks at the bar and brought them out ourselves (I enjoyed my juniper pale ale, but I had a sip of my sister's moscow mule [I don't think it was called exactly this, but it was something mule with ginger beer] and it was absolutely delicious). Then a server came and we ordered food - fries, tator tots, black bean dip, wings, and popcorn shrimp. What's an afternoon of drinking without fried food, after all? Everything was really good and wasn't greasy at all. I didn't feel gross or (too) guilty after eating it like I do at other places. I would definitely recommend the tots, dip, and shrimp.  This is a great place/way to spend a sunny afternoon. Excellent people-watching location too :)",

Definitely a sipper.

Since, Rogue is Oregon based, they feature many items from the Beaver state. \u00a0  - American Kobe beef haute dog ($10). Came with Oregon blue cheese and caramelized onions. I like blue cheese but this was way overpowering. The dog which was from Snake River Farms in the Pac-North didn't taste anything special.  - Blue balls ($6.5) Kobe beef meatballs filled with bleu cheese. \u00a0Way to salty! Just like regular blue balls, these are a no go.

The waitress was pleasant but I had to track her down and even then it took a while to get an order in.   I ordered a burger (and a beer). The beer was fine but the burger, as well as my three friends' food took 40 min to arrive and was dead cold and dried out when it did.

We arrived to the pub at 10:45 and sat at a table for nearly 10 minutes. \u00a0The place was nearly empty. \u00a0Finally somebody from our party walked up to the bar and the bartender took off. \u00a0After a few minutes he came to our table and informed us that last call was 15 minutes ago and they were closing for an employee meeting. \u00a0Really? \u00a0An employee meeting at 10:45PM on a Wednesday? \u00a0We protested, just one please? \u00a0Nope, we had to go, even though the pub still had several patrons finishing their beer. \u00a0No apologies, no offer to take some of their bottled beer or merchandise to go.  We walked six blocks from Vesuvio to try the Voodoo Doughnut Maple Bacon Porter, and left with nada and a bad opinion of the jerks at Rogue. \u00a0My buddy from out of town says he won't be drinking Rogue any more. \u00a0The other three of us won't either. \u00a0There are just so many terrific brewers around. \u00a0If one thinks too much of themselves, don't drink it. \u00a0Go somewhere else. \u00a0I know I will.  Bottom line: \u00a0don't try to visit Rogue Ales Public House on a week night -- their posted hours of operation are not reliable, and the bartender is snotty.",

HIghlights in recent months have been from Stone Brewing Company, Sierra Nevada, Anchor Steam, Anderson Valley, etc. That selection sheer combined with the fact that Rogue has a talent for picking quality brews that aren't always that well known, puts this on my \"Top 10 US Pubs\" list.  The only reason Rogue doesn't get 5 stars is because the food ranges from \u00a0just \"ok\" to \"occasionally good\" and the waitstaff beyond the bar are usually good, but can range in attentiveness. Also, the interior isn't bad, but it could use some touching up.  Overall, though, I highly recommend for anyone who loves a great, niche beer at a decent pub.",

The beers featured are obviously from Rogue, but they have plenty of alternatives as well as a full bar. The bartender both times I went seemed friendly.

The bar is relatively big and in the evenings, plenty of room to sit and sprawl out (would imagine those tables are used for dining earlier in the evening). It was relatively empty when I was there on a Saturday night....   There weren't many bartenders working - one actually. I just happened upon the bar when the bartender was on break or something, so it took a little while to get a drink. Once the normal bartender was back, all was good and the drinks came quickly.  P.S. The bar is a little bright, though I guess if you're looking for dimmer lighting, the lights were dimmer in the back of the bar...",

So you will find all your demands for what Rogue is brewing here.   I have to mark them down cause they don't update the specials boards at all. Walked in and read they had beer cheese soup. Having had this in Portland brewery, I was so let down when they came back stating that they didn't have any after all.   BOOOO!   I do love a lot of their beers but I have to say that the service here was a bit slow on the upkeep. It took at least 5 minutes from sitting down to have the bartender stop yapping with a guy down the bar top to come and take my beer order. Then the lack of cheese soup, or even knowing that they had none for a couple of minutes just indicate that they don't have a tight shipping running a float.   Not gonna say it's a bad place. It has the beer that will get you where you need to be in terms of buzzed levels. I know I walked out of there after chugging down my Morimoto sobe ale with a little happy feeling going.   Over all, the place does get crowded. It has a sort of strange lay out, but at least has the outside beer garden area for your enjoyment. So you really can't go wrong. Though considering that you're going to be within a stones throw of plenty more pubs, it's tough competition for this joint and thus it just gets a three stars from me.

Here's what I had to taste between our party of four.  Mocha Ale - Tastes like coffee! It's super dark and maybe all you need for the night, but it's like a nice bitter hit at the end  Chocolate Stout - Super interesting. Think of chocolate milk, but without the creaminess. It hits off clear and crisp at the end with a chocolate taste. The taste is just so complex it's hard to describe.  Brutal Bitter - Sounds really bitter, but not really! The bitter is a good type of bitter - it gives lots of flavor to the beer. It's an amber ale so it goes down easily with hints of bitter here and there.  Morimoto Imperial Pilsner - This was definitely my favorite. It has an exotic Asian twist to it so it goes down really smooth, and hits you with a slight amount of bitter at the end. It actually tastes like a tea at the end, as suggested by my friend. Best \"general\" description would be alcoholic green tea.  The place is down and homey. Not pretentious at all or not filled with pretentious people. I think I'll become a regular here. Very nice people and very nice microbrews. They're awesome about putting stuff on the TVs for you too so you can enjoy your drink.  Oh, did I mention $5 microbrew pints? This stuff is quality at an affordable price.

Returned today for a bloody outside, and had read on the sign that they specialize in bacon bloodies...being that i DESPISE bacon i wasn't going to try that, and the regular bloody was mediocre, however, the service was INCREDIBLY slow...they did bring our dogs water ASAP, but my bloody took around 20 minutes to come out (and the regular, non bacon one at that)... still keeping a solid 3 stars as last nights experience was much better service, but probably wouldnt return during the daytime...nor necessarily night, unless i were looking for a divey place--also i despise beer so cant speak to its quality, but they do brew their own here! they also have a cute patio out back, that i'd probably try if i were to return",

Beer is good - like the home grown feel. Strongly suggest the half-e-vison. Very good - Stay clear of the Smokey one - tastes like you are drinking bacon. Gross  2) DJ Appropriate Trivia - even though I suck at trivia \u00a0- \u00a0I have had fun. Pop in for a night or join the league - fun either way. My main complaint is that it is a mellow crowd and it goes late which is a hard combo. Be sure to like your company or the night can drag.",

I live nearby and the boyfriend and I had been excited to check it out. pub quiz night! beer! food! and dogs on the back patio?! la trappe is closed on mondays so today we finally \u00a0went in to check it out. We parked ourselves and our pooch at one of their outdoor tables and I went in to order.  The bartender wasnt the most friendly/kind of ignored but i shrugged it off and ordered our beers, was then informed that if we took a menu outside a waitress would be out to take our orders soon. cool.  we head outside, 30 minutes later after deciding our mocha porters tasted crappy and watered down a waitress finally appears. we order our appetizer.irish nachos. \u00a0theyre out of the waffle fries so we say regular fries are fine. \u00a0the boyfriend gets an amber after finding out they were out of the beer he wanted. also not great. 15 minutes later the waitress comes back to tell us that they are out of the corned beef which is an integral part of our dish. so basically they could have told me 15 minutes ago they were out of the fucking dish and saved us both a LOT of time. we decided to check out the menu again. i have no idea why.  15...20...almost 30 minutes later. still no waitress. but a friend happens to walk by and confirms that yes, everytime shes been here it hasnt been a great experience either. at this point we were so over the shitty service and decide to go elsewhere to spend our cash, so i go inside to begrudgingly pay for our crappy beers. the bartender ignores me for a good 5 minutes while he shoots the shit and takes a shot with some regulars. thanks dude. while i wait i look around for our waitress-or any waitress for that matter and dont see a single one. wtf? bartender finally gets around to me and sounds a little miffed that we didnt go through our non-existent waitress to pay. whatever. $20 later we are out of there, pretty irritated by the god awful service, and having paid that much for grody beer.   i tried to give them 2 stars, i wanted to give them 5 but in the end i definitly left saying \"Eek! Methinks not.\" indeed.",

The Kobe beef chili dog was hearty. We were told the chips were literally Ruffles brand. Nice.   Best part of this place is the beer flight: 4 beers, hefty 2 oz pours, for $6. The IPAs were not bad, as was the Dead guy. But they didn't have the Yellow Snow, which we had tasted at a bar in Vegas, and was the express reason why we came.

We dropped our stuff of at our hotel on Columbus and decided to walk it and find a place to have a nice drink and bite to eat. We came upon the Rogue's. My husband is somewhat of a beer connoisseur..and wanted to try this place in order to support the local brewery's (which I have NO problem with, even though I am not a beer fan at ALL) We walk in and the bartender says \"seat yourselves\"..so we do, at a table by the window. The same bartender comes over to take our order, and seeing as it's a brewery or ale house.. and I didn't want to feel like a jackass ordering something they wouldn't have, \u00a0or be able to make sooo..... scenario as follows:  Me: Do you have a full bar? Bartender: Yes Me: Can I have a Washington Apple Martini? (My signature and favorite) Bartender: Well we actually don't have any apple pucker. Me: *Blank Stare*.......Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I'll just have a captain and coke then.  WHAT?! How in the hell are you going to tell someone you have a full bar, when actually you don't?!?! I digress.  I ordered the fish tacos made with halibut and my husband gets the chicken caesar salad, and we share a cup of the beer cheddar soup.  The soup was more like a chowder, but pretty tasty. The tacos were good, the fish was seasoned really well, they were served with sour cream, salsa, cheese, shredded lettuce, and soft corn tortillas, in a make your own kind of style which I liked... but no side dish which I thought was odd but I was still full after eating the tacos. My hubby said the salad was decent but didn't get the bread that was supposed to be served with it. So even though the food was good, (Nothing to write home about) I only give it 2 stars because of the lack of service ( The bartender looked like the only one there and it got pretty busy) and I don't like being told there is a full bar, when clearly there is not and then I'M the one who feels like an idiot.

They have a couple guest taps, and if they still have Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Ale, that is almost better than some of the normal Rogue beers. :)",

    "review_text": "Disclaimer to head you off: I did not eat here. I don't plan on eating here. I tend to do that. As you have just learned, I like a place based on the fact that I like a name of a brew they produce. Go from there.  Ok, I will be the first to admit that the atomshpere in here is not the friendliest.....it doesn't feel like Cheers. Call me crazy but I like a bar to feel like on old shoe around my drunken soul. I like to feel comfortable all around. Yeah I'm happy they have a patio but it's just not enough......if there are neighbors drinking together and rolling one then I'll give this place the last star.Community folks, that's what it's all about! But if you are \"kind of\" a \"beer snob\" this is a place for you. First off they have tons of interesting stuff on tap. They have a whole lot of stuff that the Rogue company makes on hand and only sells through their ale houses or breweries. But they also have a whole lot of guest stars to choose from. Example:they have my new favorite Sierra Nevada brew on tap--Crystal Beer. Think filtered wheat beer--all the flavors without all the chunkS! (seriously though, I can't get past this; it's like those pearl drinks, I can't get past swallowing something goopy and weird feeling down my throat---and that's the end of my commentary for tonight on swallowing). Right there,that place is worth my patronage!! They carry some of the Speakeasy line---both Prohibition and Big Daddy---smiles all around! They carry a full bar so if your friend is jonesing for a martini, you can go here sans guilt.  But back to their \"homegrown\".....My friend (who's promised all of us a round of new livers for everyone once he wins the lotto) and I spent a lofty afternoon drinking and we tried several of the home teams selections. The hazlenut stout, Shakespeary stout, Dead Guy and Chocolate Stouts are quite tasty and stand well on their own--hell, I'll go far as to say that Chocolate stout rivals in taste and thickness to my favorite beverage of all, The Sheaf Stout. It has that perfect balance and the finish follows up with the promise of chocolate (think: really good, expensive chocolate--like maybe one of those one's that have at least 62-70% cacao in them--yeah one of those suckers that set you back a few bucks but they're OH-SO-GOOD--none of that 3 for a dollar crap!!). But then, oh then, our bartender Brian decided to do some mix master magic!!!! He mixed the hazelnut and chocolate stouts (75% of one, 25% of the other in that order). Holy mother of.....damn son! That's what I'm talking about which leads me to my next topic.....  Brian, you rocked it!!!! Not only did you give us shot glasses of different brews to try at our whim, but you mixed me my beer magic (that formentioned hazelnut/chocolate stout comobo) AND you freely despensed your brew wisdom AND you went and found us some chocolate stout to take home (we paid for it too so no hopes on walking home with a \"to go\" cup). Right there, you are beautiful. But fellow Yelpers--BEWARE OF WHAT YOU TYPE!!!!!! My friend happened to mention my Yelping activities to our bartender and he mentioned that Rogue usually doesn't do well regarding yelping (a-hem!) I felt so bad!! I, unintentially, may have hurt some feelings!! Seriously, do you want to be known as the mean bitch/ jackass? I want to use my SuperYelpPowers for good not evil (ok maybe a little evil) Not right, folks, not right..............damn good brew though.",

Are you KIDDING me?!?!  It's a pub. The beers are awesome. Ridiculously awesome, in fact. And there you are. Go to the pub, drink phenominal beer. Want a cheeky chardonnay and sit on non-holey stools while admiring the flowery patio and discussing Satre? Then maybe something that's described as a PUBLIC ALES HOUSE may not be for you.  They have 30-ish beers on tap. 20 or so are Rogue's own brews, and the rest are \"guest\" beers. Dan, the manager, is a true beerphile, and a huge supporter of the craft brewing industry, so you'll find tons of local brews like Anderson Valley, Lagunitas, and Russian River, in addition to Coors \"We pity you\" Lite. But their own beers really do shine - there's something for everyone here. Want something mind blowing? Ask for a black and tan, made with their hazelnut ale and their chocolate stout. It's like drinking a nutella milkshake.  Food's not bad, but again, it's a pub. You go to the pub for beer, not for haute cuisine. So I'll knock off a star for that - NOT for the lack of patio flowers. Grab dinner at one of the bazillion other restaurants in North Beach, then waddle over to Rogue for some awesome brews. Tell 'em the bald Irishman sent ya. (They won't know what you're talking about, I just want to build my rep, ya know?!)",

So we wandered some more looking for an open Italian place and we encountered a lot of open doors with neon OPEN signs in the windows but once we went inside all we saw were employees chowing down. It was like a big tease from the universe. You can get in and watch us eat but we won't serve you.   How ironic that North beach closes down so friggin early. Ever been to Italy? Real Italians don't close down early. Wimpy Americans! And for equality sakes I'll say have you ever been to Ireland? You can get food til the pub closes there. No closed kitchens while the pub is still hopping. Wimpy Americans!  We thought it was a bust. OK I thought it was a bust, my partner was more optimistic and started calling me names like pessimist polly and telling me that I give up to easily. Which I might point out was not very smart of him because I was hungry. I had low blood sugar and for all he knew I might have pulled a Bruce Banner and turned into Hyo-Glycemic Hannah and eaten him for my next meal. He is Italian so he probably tastes good. We'll just call him lucky to have made it through unscathed.  At this point we were contemplating our options. We could get back in our car and drive to Tommy's Joint or some other diner in the City that we know would be open. Or we could walk up to Broadway and pray that we would find an open Noodle house.   I wasn't having that last option because I could just imagine my mood if I walked all the way up to Broadway and then couldn't find anything open.  So I opted to go to the car. On our way back to the car, like a beacon in the night we spied the Rogue Ale House. There she was. All shiny and open with big glass windows through which we saw people eating. Actual food by non-employees was being eaten! It wasn't just a tease anymore. And the food looked good. Yummmmm  So in we went. Now I like Rogue brews so that part was great. I was hungry and the menu was extensive so it made a difficult time for me to decide what to eat. But I eventually went with fish tacos. My partner went with fish n chips. They both tasted great. Of the two the fish n chips was the better deal. There was barely any fish on my plate and it cost 3 dollars more than the fish n chips plate.   The beer is awesome! I love rogue beer and the bar tender was nice too even we ordered Arrogant Bastard by mistake. He politely told us that that wasn't one of their beers and then suggested a Rogue beer that is closest to AB. To be honest I confused the Dead Guy Ale with the AB so my bad.  Minus one star because the place is really, really bright and I prefer my pubs darkish. I also thought the paraphernalia pushing was a little off putting. By that I mean they have their bottled beers, t-shirts and gift sets out on the bar floor for public perusal and purchase. Maybe that's why it's so light . To make sure people see the Rogue stuff to buy.  I would eat and drink here again most definitely. The food is a little pricier than the norm for pub fare but it tasted great and the beers are really tasty.",

Bun: White bun. A bit flimsy for my taste. It didn't disintegrate while eating the burger, but it came close. Toppings: Aged cheddar was good. Mysteriously, the grilled onions didn't come on top of the cooked burger, but on the side, under the top half of the bun. Seemed strange to me and I don't know why... Sides: Fries came out crispy. They were fine. Other Notables: Good dill pickle. Pale ale was decent, but nothing compared to Magnolia.

The bar's a bit nondescript, but the neighborhood feel and variety of excellent handcrafted beers more than makes up for it. \u00a0They've got a clever location off the main strip in North Beach, though good luck getting a parking spot.  Rogue is one of my favorites out of the bottle - glad to know that the spot to get it on tap is up to snuff. \u00a0Can't wait to go back!",

Stopped in at Rogue before a show at Bimbo's - my pals and I were hungry for bar food. It was around 7:30 pm and they were relatively crowded. There were no open tables, but room at the bar for the four of us to sit and eat. Unfortunately, the bartender was not that excited to see us and threw menus in our general direction. He did warm up a little while he took our order, but the overall consensus was that he hated life.  The beer? Delicious. So many great choices on tap, although they were out of several of our first choices. I had a orange wheat that was just right for a Tuesday night - not too heavy, with a hint of flavor. The food? Meh. Not great, not terrible. Nothing memorable.  My overall impression was that this would be a great spot to hit up *after* a show, just for a quick drink. Not for the dining experience or the warm hospitality. Hang out, have a brew and enjoy the company because the ambiance isn't really going to do it for you.",

There weren't any water bowls or anything for dogs either, so to me it didn't really seem pet friendly other than that they were allowed outside.

They offer 40+ beers on tap, which is awesome, but I'll second (or Nth, really) the other reviewers in that posting the beer list in other spots besides just behind the front bar would be very helpful. \u00a0The beer list is only really only visible if you are directly in front of that bar, \u00a0not even if you're sitting at a table in the same room, let alone in the other room, or out back on the open patio (where the attempt at a beer list is incomplete and mostly erased by the elements). \u00a0And, not to impugn the service, but when I ask what beers are available, \"All the beers Rouge brews\" is not very responsive to my question; a printed beer list would be better. \u00a0That aside, drinking Morimoto Pilsner and Soba Nut Ale (or whichever beer one might choose) straight from the tap in the appropriate glass is nice &amp; the prices are reasonable.  (N.B. Glasses are available for sale, prices vary.)

I ordered a 'Kobe' bacon cheeseburger medium-rare and had to send it back twice because it was medium-well. In the end I just had the waiter take it off the bill. By the time the second one was sent back I pretty much culled my hunger with beer... oh sweet savior beer. The waiter was pretty cool about it and apologetic.

    "review_text": "Incredible beer, \u00a0I mean really, _really_ good beer. I have to somewhat shake my head at the people here complaining about the beer. Rogue is generally considered in beer snob circles as one of the top American craft breweries. The San Francisco alehouse is one of the only locations they have outside of Oregon. They have a huge number of their brews on draft to select from including several of the XS series. They also typically have one to two \"on cask\". The bartenders are more then happy to make recommendations or give you a small sample if you have trouble making up your mind. For more serious sampling they sell a reasonably priced flight, with your choice of beers in small taste sized portions.  For extra brownie points they carry a full draft selection of \"guest beers\" from other craft and major breweries. Many brewpubs/alehouses only stock their own beers, and its a testament to their confidence in their product as well as a desire to meet their customers needs that they carry so many of their competitor's offerings. A few beer recommendations for those interested are at the bottom of the review.  The food is pretty good as well. Some of the offerings are average (chicken wings come to mind), but others are top notch (burgers cooked to order with artisan cheeses and gourmet bacon). They also have a little patio with outdoor seating that is nice, if you're able to grab a table.  Only reason this place gets 4/5 instead of 5/5 are:  1. Some of the wait-staff are not very good. I don't know if they're lazy, incompetent, or just asked to handle too many tables at once, but the service can be spotty. That being said, many times I'll sit up at the bar, and the bartenders have always been outstanding. I think a lot of the time the managers are working the bar, so that may have something to do with it.  2. MUSIC! It's too loud inside sometimes, as in you have to shout at the person next to you loud. Kinda ruins one of the best parts about going to the pub, the lively discussion with friends over beer.  3. No growlers in stock. I wanted to take a growler of the Chocolate Stout home, and they told me they did not have any, but they would fill one if I brought it in. I've since purchased a growler during a visit to Pyramid that I intend to take in for a filling soon.  They have too many beers to review, but when I'm looking for something dark and sweet the Chocolate Stout and Hazelnut Brown are excellent (much better on draft then from the bottle), while the hophead in me can't get enough of the Brutal Bitter or the XS IPA. The Old Crustacean Barleywine is decent, but I've had better. Unless you can't stand the style they're currently serving, cask ale is always a treat. Finally, they always carry a few styles you can't get in the bottle, so you should ask the bartender which brews are \"draft only\" to see what new Rogue Ales you might be able to try.",

For those of you that don't live at my house, there is a MUNI stop directly in front of the building. Like RIGHT at the front door on Union. I wish I could remember which one. The bartenders (and most of the servers) are coool. Like, \"Oh, you've never heard of that brew before? Let's discuss it for a minute and let me pour you a sample\" cool. I specify 'most of the servers' because there's a few that are careless or overwhelmed or whatever. But all you have to do is get up, walk to the bar, and have a real conversation with a real person that can tell you firsthand real details about really damn good beer. Leave the serving food to the servers! Good n mellow crowd, as well as music. Great views! I love people watching on Union n Columbus. Heaters and patio seating! Beer gardens in the back (during the day). Not too overpriced bar food...  OK, not amazing yet not terrible quality. I had the beer n cheese soup (BOMB, but probably hard to mess up), my friend had the taco salad (totally Americanized but still great), burger (yummy!), and spinach artichoke dip (SO GOOD, with toasted pita!). All in all this place can kick it up a little with some more bathrooms, more attentive servers, maybe a fancier restaurant menu. But why? It's a public ALE house. So, go for the beer! And the great vibes. :)",

    "review_text": "Rogue Ales Public House: a beer oasis in North Beach The Rogue Ales Public House across from Washington Square has in six-and-a-half years developed some of the characteristics of a neighborhood \"local\" pub: a place you can meet a buddy before going out on the town, or enjoy an afternoon snack and some good beer in pleasant surroundings in the middle of bustling North Beach and Chinatown. Rogue SF, the southernmost outpost of the Oregon-based Rogue Nation, has a lot going for it in becoming a local hangout. The bar is in a good location (formerly Mel's Steakhouse and Little City) on the corner of Powell and Union and it's open every day from around midday on. It's kid- and pet-friendly, and serves better than average beer with food. The outdoor patio gives the ale house a bit of an urban oasis ambience and Thursday night pub quizzes are popular. The pub pushes Rogue's beer and paraphernalia pretty hard - bottles for sale are lined up all over the pub -- and the staff is eager for you to try the beer. Servers are happy to oblige with a taste if you're curious about any of them.  Sometimes the devil is in the details, and Rogue SF is a bit frayed around the edges. The vinyl-covered bar stools are cracked and show considerable wear and tear, the patio is a little dingy, and the whole pub seems a bit tired and very 1980s. Food is typical pub fare, though the Kobe beef chili the bartender recommended was nicely balanced and tasty. Clearly, the chief reason for being here, other than trivia night, is the beer, which you order from the large chalkboard that looms over the bar.  The pub advertises 40 beers on tap, and even though several taps were out, there's still a lot to choose from. Unlike some other chain pubs, Rogue shares taps with beer from several local breweries, including Anchor's Old Foghorn Barleywine, Drakes Imperial Stout (Denogginizzer was out), Anderson Valley Huger Boont and Lagunitas Hairy Eyeball.  Rogue makes an extensive range of interesting beer, from pilsners to IPAs, porters and stouts. The Dry-Hopped St. Rogue Red Ale I had with the Kobe beef chili was delicious, bringing out the flavors of the dish while at the same time quenching the spicy chili and refreshing my palate. Even though the hops were noticeable in this red ale, they didn't predominate. At 5.1% abv, it's a very nice session beer. Rogue makes some excellent stouts and porters, too. Of the 18 Rogue beers listed on the chalkboard, six were porters or stouts. The SF pub served Rogue's chocolate stout, with imported Dutch bittersweet chocolate, in a hand-pumped cask, and it was delicious. Who needs dessert when you can have your chocolate and your beer all at once? Rogue Ales Public House in North Beach is worth a visit just to sample a nice variety of well-crafted, well-poured beers. The food isn't spectacular, especially considering the abundant options available in the area. But it's a good place to duck into for a pint in a cozy atmosphere with some North Beach denizens.",

We did the tastings (you choose 4 beers each tasting from a big list on a chalk board). Surprisingly, I only really liked about 3 of the 8 total beers (we had two tastings). The double chocolate stout is insanely thick - it tastes pretty good, but its basically like chocolate cough syrup.

What you want is a situation where the bartender(s) can fill all of the orders without you waiting. Essentially the balance between restaurant and bar, in a place specializing in beer, should lean towards the bar side. At rogue this is effectively an unfixable problem (I mean, they aren't going to double the size of the bar, which is what a space with this much seating would need to be a good drinkery), however this doesn't mean that this place is doomed, no, all it means is that they need to step their food game up to compensate. Make the menu bigger, lower prices, make people want to sit down and eat while they (by necessity) wait for their beer.  That's my 2 cents.",

No complains here. The back \"Beir Garden\" is a great addition. Place is getting messy though, even unclean. Floors filthy, bathrooms worse. Tables aren't maintained, some so unstable they can't hold a beer. But whatever, great beer makes up for allot. With that said, Food is horrific. Kobe beer sliders, flavorless hockey pucks. \"Extra order\" Fries awful. $14 burger doesn't even come with fries. Handfull of broken shitty ruffle chips. \u00a0Never understood this. Fries cost about 4 cents, put them with every sandwich! Lots of them! Nothing disappoints more when they get a burger, and it doesn't come with lots of fries. You are making a shit ton of money on the beer. Add the fries. There with a table of about 7. Not one person liked their food. Go there for the beer. Go elsewhere for the food.",

    "review_text": "Come to Rogue for the beer, not the food.  Rogue is a brand of beer from Newport, Oregon. \u00a0The company has several breweries &amp; distilleries and restaurant-pubs in Oregon. \u00a0There is also this Rogue pub in San Francisco, which is located near the border of North Beach/Telegraph Hill and Russian Hill. \u00a0It's Rogue's southernmost location and the only one in California.  The inside of the pub is like any old traditional bar. \u00a0It's casual, worn, there are TVs playing sports... it feels like another laid back watering hole. \u00a0The space used to be Mel's Steakhouse and Little Cities.  My buddy and I stopped by to grab a quick dinner on our walk back to his apartment in Telegraph Hill. \u00a0On a weekday night, the pub got pretty busy. \u00a0I'm not much of a drinker, so I didn't try any of Rogue's ales (though my friend did). \u00a0I believe the house ales ran about $7-8 per bottle. \u00a0Not the cheapest bottles of beer, but I guess it is a special, local brand.  Food-wise, Rogue serves typical pub grub: soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, fish and chips, tacos, wings, dip, chicken tenders, etc. \u00a0One interesting thing to note is they use American Kobe beef in some of their burgers and all of their hot dogs. \u00a0The Kobe beef is sourced from Snake River Farms. \u00a0These Kobe beef burgers and hot dogs are what is most recommended by the staff.  I had the half-pound Kobe cheeseburger ($13.95) and my tablemate had the Shepherd hot dog ($9.95). \u00a0Each of the Kobe burgers is priced around $13-16 and the Kobe hot dogs are around $8-10 each. \u00a0This is pricey for hamburgers and hot dogs, especially at a bar which isn't really a gastropub. \u00a0Normally, I wouldn't mind paying these kinds of prices if I can taste the difference in quality, but in Rogue's case, I couldn't -- they tasted much like an ordinary burger and hot dog. \u00a0Though nothing tasted bad, the sides seemed \"amateurish\" and unmemorable.  The Kobe cheeseburger consisted of a half-pound American Kobe beef patty, Rogue Creamery white cheddar (also choice of Oregon blue cheese), wasabi mayo, lettuce, and tomato. \u00a0I had my burger cooked medium. \u00a0The patty was thick and hearty, but not terribly distinct nor flavorful. \u00a0The burger came with a pickle spear and a side of plain French fries.  The Shepherd dog consisted of an American Kobe beef frank, topped with Kobe beef chili, and black beans. \u00a0It was served with shredded cheddar cheese and chopped purple onion on the side along with a side of ridged potato chips. \u00a0The dog fared much better than the burger. \u00a0It was more savory all-around. \u00a0The cheese, onion, and chips looked like they were picked up at Safeway. \u00a0The chips resembled (or actually were) bagged Ruffles crinkle-cut potato chips.  Service was A-OK. \u00a0JP was our server and he was friendly and hospitable.  Rogue in summary: Food - no. Beer - yes.",

I felt like I was stuck in the early 90's... the jukebox was consistently playing music from my late high school/early college years, reminiscent of Reality Bites and late nights listening to Live 105 in the \u00a0car on the way to Lyon's for a cheese stick.  I digress.  I admit that I had been passing by Rogue for a long time now, but had never stepped inside. Every time we passed by, my boyfriend would remark that it seemed too much like a \"Dude\" place, which sadly, it is. The decor reminded me of TGI Friday's. That combined with the sports on the telly, the guys in striped shirts &amp; polos, and the outdated music only further enforced this stereotype.  Eleven bucks is a hefty price for a burger. I was willing to try their Kobe burger once at this price, for I am on a quest for the perfect burger. Verdict? Not worth the $11. *Maybe* $6. It was thick and meaty, but not spectacular. The bun left a lot to be desired, dry and a bit too large in proportion to the patty. Fries were fresh and hot, but flavorless.  Our waiter seemed in a rush to end his shift, so he was hurried, forgot our silverware, kept checking in with us (read: interrupting a lot), wiped our table down as we were still lingering over our beers.  I give the most points for the beer. I had the Mocha Porter (a no brainer, as soon as I saw it I didn't want anything else) and my dining companion had the Chocolate Stout... nice meaty brews appropriate for the cool autumn weather.  I'll stick to buying Rogue Ales somewhere else, and not bother with the Public House.",

I have to admit I'm not a beer fan at all, but I must say that the Hazelnut Brown Nectar (Rogue beer) is pretty darn tasty, not over-beering at all, with a subtle hint of hazelnut.   Lucky for me, Rogue also has a full bar and a decent selection of house special cocktails. My favorite was the Ginger Daisy, the soothing taste from the lemon and ginger almost made me forget the toxic waste I was actually ingesting.   To make things even better, Rogue has a food menu, ranging from appetizers to full meals (burgers, etc). We ordered Idaho tater tots, Idaho fries, and bruschetta. The tater tots are out of this world, we all absolutely loved the crispy fried potato balls. The fries were good as well, but the bruschetta can be skipped.

There is ample seating throughout the bar, but surprisingly not many comfortable areas to stand if there is no seating available. The beer selection is top notch, especially if you like Rogue beers. They have many hard to find Rogue offerings. They also have a handful of visiting taps (beers from other micro brewers), so even if Rogue isn't your thing you can still get some delicious craft beers.  The food is really the only thing keeping the Rogue Ales Public House from 5 stars.

    "review_text": "No idea on the food side of things what it's like, but this was fun to check out one night, when my brother realized there was a Rogue Ale House along Columbus Ave. Obviously since I already was a little familiar with Rogue from the fact Edgewater Lounge in Chicago always has had a lot of Rogue beers on tap, I naturally had to check them out the night he told me he was going here.  So a pretty nice place. There are both booths to sit down and eat, along with the usual TVs and a comfortable bar area. I sampled several beers, and getting a beer flight wasn't too expensive. They even do sell beer bombers of their beers, to go.  Sad news is that I learned the hard way(don't fly often, unlike others) liquid bottles of anything bigger than a certain size are prohibited to be taken through the TSA security checkpoint, and that you only can take those onto a plane if you check in a bag. As a result, my Rogue bomber was confiscated. :( I also didn't want to create a scene or anything like that at San Francisco Intl. Airport, or be gawked at weirdly by others hurriedly sipping a beer, so I said 'ef it' and allowed my bottle to be confiscated. Luckily, I only lost $10(how much my bomber cost), as a result of not knowing this. So if you buy a bomber and you flew out to San Francisco from somewhere else, purchase it with EXACTLY the expectation you should drink it down in your motel/hotel room or wherever else(i.e. friend's apartment, a BYOB restaurant, etc), and avoid what I went through! I'm sure whatever lucky TSA soul drank my bomber as a result of it being confiscated and showing up among all the confiscated items, had fun(boo to him/her).  Why the heck this TSA rule can't be reversed in 2015, I have no darn idea why. Not everyone cares to fork over $25 or whatever airlines are attempting to charge these days(god bless Southwest for still not charging for checked bags, and sadly I wasn't flying with them on this trip), to avoid a beer being confiscated if you prefer to not pay ridiculous checked baggage fees.",

My friend and l ordered beer and dinner on a rather quiet Sunday afternoon, our food arrived before the beers and I had to ask three times for my drink. \u00a0I finally got the first, ordered the second halfway through dinner and finally got it just before we got the bill! (and yes, we had to ask for that too) When we said something about the service the server got defensive and had an attitude. \u00a0They were totally uninterested in our complaints and showed no concern about improving their service. \u00a0  When we spoke to the manager, we discovered why the service was so poor. \u00a0The manager was apathetic and dismissive. \u00a0He had no interest in keeping us as customers even after we told him we go there somewhat regularly, enjoy the patio and would like him to be aware that we've seen the place go downhill. \u00a0He made absolutely no attempt to resolve the complaint. In fact the only person I thought heard us was the new guy who started a week before! (Awesome job man, I'm sure your next boss will appreciate you--and thanks for trying.) He didn't offer us a coupon for our 'next visit', a complimentary beer, not even an apology for the piss poor training that he's given to his obviously inexperienced staff. I got the feeling he was fine with losing local customers just so long as it didn't distract from his routine of watching TV.    I won't go back. \u00a0If I'm going to spend my money it will be at a truly local place that values my patronage and respects their clientele. Good day sir.",

The menu here is good- standard \"pub food\" with a twist- \u00a0kobe beef burgers (yum) and other things- if you drink beer, they have a million different kinds. \u00a0They make me home made ginger ale if I ask for it. \u00a0Blue cheese lovers will like this place- lots of dishes with blue cheese..  I definitely recommend this place if you have a dog(s)- there is a lot of space, the food is good- and afterwards go to Washington Square Park across the street and hang.",

I'll be damned if that poor guy wasn't there by himself cooking, cleaning, bussing tables, serving drinks and pouring beer.   I was hoping they served pitchers and seems they don't but I had two glasses of their Imperial Pilsner that were pretty tasty. Two beers and Wifey Had an ice cream sundae for $20 total. Plus I left a good tip for the man who I thought was rude but was really just overworked. \u00a0I would like to stop by again.

Buy some cheap environment-safe paper and print your beer list daily and have an 86 board. so much easier then the current method.   I also find it terribly annoying to watch your server stand out side smoking cigarettes while we were waiting to be greeted for a beer. Then they reek of cigarettes a big no-no in my book. wash your hands, pray some cologne or perfume and then go to your tables.   the food has gotten lower and lower quality every visit. good bar food i guess. However they still get 4 stars for great beer selection which in all honesty is why we go there.   just get a better beer menu/descriptions and you'll get a 5th star.",

Or if you want to buy a tshirt to profess your love.  As for the beer, they do some pretty eccentric stuff, so taste around. And you can do that with a taster of 4 for $8. You pick your own 4. It could be really hit or miss per individual. The hef was not my favorite hef, but I truly enjoyed the dry hopped red, very hoppy indeed. The jasmine mead was delightful too. I've never seen a beer so clear before. Some sour beers are likened to wine-beer, but the jasmine mead was like a tea-beer. The Oregasmic ale was very hoppy.

When you experiment you are bounded to fall on your face time and again, but it is the exceptions that make it worth doing. When you come up with an excellent new beer, it is a just reward for all of the flops. So go there, try the beers (they have great samplers) and get a Kobe burger.

We grabbed spinach artichoke dip at the beginning of trivia, anticipating that we would get another appetizer or two a little bit later, as trivia is a marathon and not a sprint. Really delicious and warm, but not huge- probably good for two or three people and no more. Our server didn't inform us that the kitchen was closing, so when we tried to order something else (it was only about 9:15 or 9:30) we couldn't.. bummer. If not for this, I would give Rogue 4 stars for sure.  Server (Tim) was never MIA and was knowledgable on the brews. He was cool and relaxed, never looked rushed but never took too long-- good fit for the atmosphere for sure.  Trivia was awesome (I might be saying this because I got a free beer- wooooo)- pretty tough but the system they use and the DJ were 4.5 stars out of 5. Lots of teams there, lots of competition, and a lot of fun. Definitely get there pretty early if you're looking to do trivia with a bunch of friends- it's tough to find a table and chairs for your trivia crew if you show up after 7:15/7:30.",

This place is only getting 1 star for the beer... even though our waiter was nice, the bartender was incredibly rude (I'll get to that in a minute), it just wasn't enough to warrant another star since there's a good chance I won't ever come back here.  I came a here a few weeks ago with a friend in the middle of the afternoon on a Friday and we asked to do a beer tasting (you order 4 different beers and get them in smaller than usual cups) . Our waiter said sure, but before he could ask us what beers we'd like the bartender interrupted from the other side of the room to call him over and very loudly let him know that he couldn't do that because he didn't have enough of the tasting cups.   Seriously Rogue? Not enough tasting cups? Oh, people steal them and they break? Order enough tasting glasses to keep your barware appropriately stocked - you are running a bar that specializes in all things Rogue beer. Of course people are going to want to do tastings.   So our poor waiter came back over and told us that he was really sorry and they couldn't do the tasting... well, we took a few minutes to look at the beer menu. When our waiter came back, my friend asked if instead of the tasting glasses if we could just have tasting size portions in regular glasses (of which there were hundreds). So, our waiter proposed this to the bartender who again very loudly protested (obviously so we could hear how unhappy he was about it), but finally agreed though he adamantly told the waiter not to give us the tasting sheet because other customers would come in and want to do a tasting too and the place was about to get really busy (which it never did, and we left around 6pm). \u00a0  Basically the bartender went out of his way to loudly complain about our order and make us feel uncomfortable. Luckily, our waiter was really nice or we probably would have just left without trying the beers we were really looking forward to having. The beers were great but unfortunately I won't come back for a while until maybe things have a chance to change. If I do walk in though and that same bartender is there I will definitely walk right back out.  I'm sad to give Rogue only 1 star because there are a few things they could do to drastically improve and bring it up to 5 stars and an awesome place to hang out and have beer for hours. 1. get rid of the rude bartender and hire NICE people who understand that you are running a business and customer service is important to keep people coming back to spend their money at your establishment 2. print out the beer list of what's available each day. this place is huge and the only place you can read the beer list is on the chalkboard behind the bar. if something runs out, the waiter can let the table know of any last minute changes. 3. make sure you have enough things like glasses of all sizes...",

They have a very nice selection of beer and the bar-tenders, from my experience, are very knowledgeable about the details of the beer. \u00a0  3) Service- 3 or 4-ish out of 5 The service, admittedly, can be hit or miss. The best server I had was some punk-ish girl who told me once that she was going to SFSU for a psychology degree. Sometimes other servers can be a little slow getting to you (especially if you are not sitting at the bar and just walk in and sit down at a table). Also, as a heads up if you DO sit down at the table and order something I would suggest NOT walking up to the bar and ordering beer or another item. This makes this ring up two different bills, and then its just more confusing and annoying for both you and them when it comes paying for everything.",

After almost three years of incredible service and a friendly staff with little turnover, the GM left and the lead waitress was fired. I didn't know them personally so while it was sad that no one would know our group we were optimistic. Then they double booked us, twice.  Two months after we canceled our reoccurring events I received a call from \"Ryan\" who wanted to follow up with me to see why my group hadn't been in for a while. I told him about the double bookings (the back room was booked to us- a boardgame group, and a college reunion group- it was awkward). He said the turnover issues were over and they would love a second chance.   So we took their word for it and went back. It.. was... awful.. Although I confirmed the reservation the week before and the day before they were clueless when we arrived. No extra staff, and 20-45 minutes between drinks.   Then the waitress told us she needed to clean the backroom so she could leave by 12am. It was 9:30. WTF? I told her I always had the room until midnight, and a few us of from the group always stayed to help clean the room and we collected tips for the bar before everyone left, that's why we've always had such a great relationship with them. Hell, the old guys even served those of us who stayed to help well after close, they were our neighborhood place and we turned it into our little nerd bar. Over three years I held 20-30 events there that averaged 60+ to 200+ (in and out, this place is not that big).   Anyway, the waitress told me \"the manager would \"tell me\". (it was a threat). She then went to the bar and told him that I said \"we were going to stay after close and didn't care about policies\" She didn't realize I was behind her when she said this and came back and told me that he said \" we better leave now and they didn't want nerdie types there as that is not their desired demographic\", That was not what he said. But I didn't care at that point. At that point I started asking my group to leave, and told them not to tip.",

For $8.42 you get to sample four different beers. Perfect for someone that drinks slow and enjoys every last drop. You get to pick which four you want to try, or if you're trusting, have the bartender pick for you based on what you like.   I had the following:   1. Orgasmic ale (oregonasmic ale)- This one is part of the grow your own Chatoe Rogue series. Everything is sourced in Oregon for this ale and that's why they called is Orgasmic, although I think \"Oregonasmic\" is more fitting. It was a bit bitter for my taste but it was OK.  2. Sig's red IPA- I don't remember much from this one but I enjoyed it more than the first one. It was less bitter and a little more smooth.   3. Shakespeare oatmeal stout (nitro)- This one was rich and thick and sort of chocolaty. I was told by JP that this is what Guinness wishes it tasted like. They add nitrogen instead of CO2. It's good. Drink it slow.  4. Mocha porter- this one was similar to the stout but it wasn't as thick. It was my favorite although I did enjoy each beer progressively more, which leads me to believe that maybe I was just getting more inebriated.   If you like beer, stop by Rogue (not to be confused with Rouge).   BTW, JP is awesome. He is the bartender that helped us out and he was very knowledgeable about the beers and made great recommendations.  Lastly, they serve food here but you have to get here early. Ask them to pair the food with your beer.",

The hipster than whines about \"losing money\" on our table! Excuse my french, but screw that asshole!   I have been a waiter before and no doubt lousy tips suck but you have to put forth some effort to earn a decent tip. Either way, you are getting paid hourly though the tip is not obligatory but rather a nice gesture. You give what you can, I mean Rogue is by no means Spruce. Sometimes I envy the European restaurant service, at least you know you are getting bad service beforehand so you are not expected to leave a tip AND if you do, it is only spare change. \u00a0  Dbag hipster waiter with long hair and fake Ray Bans ruined my Rogue experience.

It's got a ton of beer options, but there's no drink menu, so you'd better hope you can read the chalkboard posted by the bar (unfortunately we weren't even in the same room).  It was dimly lit, but not in a sexy way. Think Round Table Pizza.  It took 15 minutes for someone to come greet our table. I was beginning to think we didn't exist. There was also no explanation of the menu specialties or the beer options, which would have been welcomed, seeing as how the majority of us had never been there before. Couple this with the no drink menu issue and we felt like we were covering our eyes and ordering whatever our finger happened to land on.  As it turns out, you should definitely order the bleu cheese balls or bleu cheese sliders. They saved the day and made me forget about the awful chicken tenders I made the mistake of ordering. Their french fries (which they charge extra for) are bland and made me wish I was at Red Robin eating a basket of their crack-dusted steak fries. Which reminds me, Rogue's ranch tasted bottled, and costs an extra 50 cents.   Any place that charges for condiments isn't looking too promising, especially when you need them to spice up their bland offerings.  We went out of our way to come here, when I'd say it's definitely more of a \"Wow! We're starving an are only a block away!\" type of place.",

The food, while at times generous in portions, is pretty crap too. It's not advisable to try anything on the menu outside of the standard fried bar dishes.

If you had a bad beer here, that means you were too shy to ask the bartender for samples... you realize that this place is an embassy to one of the nation's best microbreweries and the kicker is that Rogue actually located in Oregon and they have a big HQ pub in Eugene, OR. They were just generous when they planted this place in SF for us folks.  Food I didn't even bother with based on these reviews but I drank my fill. I drink for the taste and to develop a palette (I sound like a douche) not necessarily to get sloshed on a Sunday night.. (lol)  Afterwards I totally raided the merchandise area with my friend. They're totally out of sizes due to how popular this place is with hop-heads (beer enthusiasts) but HEY I CAN SHRINK AN XL DOWN TO A LARGE RIGHT GUYS?!  Thank you for the amazing beer which oddly enough I can go down to Whole Foods and buy, but I just had to go here with a friend an hour away from home just to see it and it would have been worth it if there were no bartenders or beers on tap just to see what a Rogue bar would be like....  Now if only we can get a Dogfish Head pub in SF/SJ/Santa Cruz we'd be golden...  PS. Drink everything. I literally mean a little bit of everything they have on the board. You don't want to leave the pub before doing that. I literally mean sample everything and tip the bartender extra extra if you need to. Rogue is incapable of making a bad beer, even if I drink outside my comfort zone with stuff I don't normally like.  They have other high profile beers from other breweries on tap but my vision was blurry from all the stuff I'd have to special order from bevmo fresh on tap.",

Disappointment with just about everything else. First, we couldn't find a server to save our lives, on the patio or inside. When we finally found an employee, he confirmed that they did indeed offer table service. After a further wait, my buddy gave up and went to the bar to get a couple beers at least. A while later a server finally showed up, cleared some of the stuff the previous patrons had left on the table, and we quickly placed our order (in case this guy never appeared again).  We ordered two types of tacos -- mahi mahi and \"kobe\" beef. When they arrived, both plates looked more like the mise en place for tacos then any actual tacos. Perhaps this was a cutting-edge deconstruction effort that my unsophisticated midwestern palate could simply not grasp, but that seems unlikely. Each component was piled up separately on the plate. This technique was especially unkind to the fish which had been mashed up as if intended as baby food.  When it finally came time to grudgingly pay for this unfortunate meal, the server was again MIA. Upon tracking him down, he said he'd bring the check right over. You might not be surprised at this point to learn that he didn't. My friend finally paid the bill at the bar and we left.

They didn't have any Belgian style ales, but my date thought that because Le Trap is so close, maybe it would be redundant. We had a light dinner; he had chili, and I had black bean dip. All the accoutrements for the chili come on the side, which is great when you are on your New Year's eating healthy plan, because you can skip the cheese and sour cream. My black bean dip was really really tasty. It had some heat, and was a little tangy (from lime?) It was overcooked and crumbly in one corner, but eh. I didn't come here for the food, and I was still pleasantly surprised.",

Let me start off by stating that Rogue beers are definitely one of my favorites and i have both been drinking, and supporting Rogue for years, but after multiple dining let downs, it hurts me to give them the dreaded 1 star review. \u00a0This isn't easy, but here we go-I had to write after this past experience. \u00a0Please note that this review is completely about this particular brewpub restaurant, food, and service, NOT about their beers in which are verrrry tasty and i love!!  Anyways, here we go....   The Kobe Blue Balls sounds awesome, but are extremely dry and lack quality meatball moist, meaty, deliciousness.  The 1/2 lb. Bacon Cheese Kobe burgers are okkkkkkkk..... But for $15.95, Go with the regular beef bacon cheeseburger for 9.95. Totally not worth the $6 extra dollars. Trust me. *** I am also very unhappy about this because the menu says $15.95 and the bill said $17.95!!!!!!!!!! REALLY ROGUE???????? \u00a0And then the waiter was completely unapologetic and could care less. \u00a0He was not even busy, but almost more annoyed that we noticed and made me get up to go get a menu to show him the real price, until he humbly mumbled... oh yeah.... \u00a0But wait it gets better!! ********  My gf ordered the chicken fingers and for a BBQ dipping sauce with them. \u00a0I casually asked for BBQ sauce and Mustard for my burger. \u00a0He brings out a couple very tiny small saucer's of 2 BBQ Sauces and a Mustard. \u00a0Without any mentioning or notifying us, we come to find out that he charged us $0.50 per sauce on our bill as well!!!!! So not only were we overcharged for our burger and not even given an apology, but were also charged extra for 3 tiny sauces in which i was embarrassed to bring up, but did mention that it would have been courteous if he had notified us before ordering that mustard for a burger and BBQ sauce for chicken fingers were going to cost us extra. \u00a0The server was completely rude, standoffish, unfriendly, cold, rude, and acted like he could care less that we decided to dine-in at Rogue for our double date night.  The one positive was the Onion Rings and beer. \u00a0This is my only recommendation if you end up here or would like to check it out for yourself. \u00a0  I FEEL COMPLETELY UNAPPRECIATED AS A PATRON AND CHEATED. \u00a0 I am very bummed out about this because of my love for their beer. \u00a0I wish i could speak with the owner or a manager about this experience. \u00a0This definitely left a sour taste in the mouths of our table and no we were not drinking sour beer, but sour attitude. \u00a0Four of us went out for a nice evening dinner before attending a comedy show at Cobbs, but definitely had a poor start to the evening because of ROGUE. \u00a0Please feel free to message me to discuss Rogue. \u00a0I'm sorry to throw you under the bus like this, but this was such a bad experience that I had to let others know. \u00a0  DO NOT RECOMMEND. \u00a0RUDE, UNFRIENDLY, UNATTENTIVE, AND CARELESS STAFF.

We placed our order at the bar as it wasn't obviously clear if they had a waitstaff in the middle of the afternoon. I went with their Oatmeal Stout which was incredibly roasty in flavor, which I enjoyed. My boyfriend also went with one of the Rogue offerings and we took our beers out into the beer garden to enjoy them.  The atmosphere was pretty low key for the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday and the patrons were in their mid 20s-30s. The bartenders and the waitstaff were friendly, so no complaints there.

The dead guy and Hazelnut are good and pretty much what you expect. But the Watermelon Hefeweizen was awesome. You get a strong taste of Watermelon out of any I've ever tasted. The 200 meter had a good citrus aftertaste that was very drinkable, but not as hoppy as I wanted from an IPA.  The food was OK. I had the chicken fingers and my fiancee had a burger.

We'd tried to get seats out in the beer garden, but nope nope nope, wasn't happening.   Our food came out and it was delicious.

It was an obnoxious tug-of-war between hops and brown sugar, with nothing to smooth the transition. \u00a0Oh, well, at least I can say I tried it. What absolutely killed me was the food. \u00a0I didn't expect \u00a0a lot, yet they still managed to disappoint me. \u00a0We ordered the Bleu Balls, which are meatballs with Oregon bleu cheese cooked into them and sprinkled on top. \u00a0They were decent, though the cheese was unbelievably salty. \u00a0Then, we ordered a 1/2-lb.Kobe bacon cheeseburger, cooked medium, as well as a Kobe beef chili-cheese dog. \u00a0It was said to come with a Rogue beer-based ketchup and mustard, cheese, and Rogue-beer-based chili. \u00a0The burger was overcooked (beyond well-done) and dry. \u00a0The hot dog was just a clusterf*ck. \u00a0No ketchup, no mustard, no cheese, just a hot dog on a bun with chli, which was dry as a bone as well . They didn't even put the f*cking pickle spear on the plate. \u00a0 Our server started out OK, checking on us from time to time, refilling our beers, etc. \u00a0Once the food was ordered, he turned into a ghost, disappearing until the food was ready, bringing it to us, then vanishing until we asked for the check. \u00a0He must have known how sucky the food is there. \u00a0He was not a particularly sharp fellow; otherwise, he likely would be working elsewhere. \u00a0 I love Rogue beers so much; this restaurant was a real kick to the stones for me. \u00a0I will enjoy Rogue ales at the Yard House from now on. \u00a0Shame on you, Rogue, for half-assing such a business venture.",

We walked into a spacious pub which is likely packed on weekends but was inhabited today by a group of folks watching the baseball game (I'm from San Diego, so suck it Giants). If you're a fan of any kind of Rogue beer, this is the place for you - all kinds of concoctions from those crazy brewmasters await you here. One of my particular faves is the Chipotle Ale.   Yeah, you read that right. Chipotle Ale.   A clean ale that goes down with a light chipotle aftertaste. For it being more of an experiment than a mainstream offering, I really like it. Lo and behold, they have it on tap. They've also got a full bar here, so if liquor is more your thing, they can take care of ya.   The staff here are very cool. The bartender, my friend and I started shooting the breeze and cracking jokes on tourists that came in asking for directions. Yeah, I'm kind of a dick like that...what do you want? I was drinking!

    "review_text": "The other day, Tom got a huge promotion at work, so we went to Rogue Brewery to celebrate. i've heard that the beer there is super good, and was excited to try a few of their different kinds. They had a ton of varieties to choose from, and i started with the Saint Rogue Red which was recommended to drink with their Kobe Beef Burger. the burger was awesome... there's nothing quite like a huge burger with blue cheese all over it! the beer on the other hand... was just ok.  Next i decided to try something a little more out of the ordinary: Chipotle Ale. i *love* the flavor of Chipotle... such a good combination of sweet and spicy, but the Chipotle ale didn't taste very good. it just tasted kinda funky. and i dont mean funky in a good way. We ended the night by having a chocolate stout float. my friends liked it, but i wasn't a huge fan. i think the beer would have been good by itself, and the ice-cream good by itself, but together the beer just made the ice cream taste bitter and have a gnarly aftertaste.  So, in the end i have mixed feelings about the place. i really dig their designs/logos, the food was pretty damn good, and i thought it was funny that they had frozen tv dinners on the menu along with the rest of the food. but the beer itself wasn't all that great. maybe it was just the ones i tried?

    "review_text": "My girlfriend and I were wandering the streets of San Francisco near the China Town area looking for a Chinese restaurant to eat and we noticed this bar. Both of us are avid lovers of Rogue ales, so we were excited and had plans to return after lunch. The bar was rather empty with only a few gatherings of people, but they were very loud and probably drunk, and mind you this was at like 1pm on a Sunday afternoon.  We received courteous service from our bartender who was very knowledgeable of the beers on tap, however, when I asked if they sold bottles to go, he said yes, but that they had all been moved down stairs into the basement which was off limits to customers. I asked the reason why and he explained that since yesterday was St. Patrick's day that the mobs of drunks would begin stealing the bottles out of the coolers so they needed to prevent that. Understandable, but I was a sober individual who knew an extensive amount of Rogue ales, but I was still not allowed to view the bottles for my choosing to purchase and take home. I had to settle for the newest bottle release that he knew of which was Portland Sesquicentennial Ale. \u00a0I wish I had taken a picture of the bartender because he looked exactly like the Gas Lamp Killer. On tap the beers we had ordered were XS Imperial Porter and XS Imperial stout. I believe one other beer, but I can't remember what it was. Too bad I didn't have the chance to order the XS Imperial Younger's Special Bitter because I haven't been able to taste it, but I was already catching a good buzz already and we had other things to go visit and see. We didn't order any food, so the rating is based off the establishment as a bar only.",

However, the food was altogether above average for a bar, and the prices were reasonable.   Perhaps importantly, the beer selection was fantastic! Our waiter was informative in helping select from the roughly 20 beers on tap. My father ended up drinking more then usual. I sampled four or five beers.

Service at the bar was friendly and attentive. \u00a0Great place for an afternoon drink",

I walked in here because my friends told me that I could get food here, and all I wanted was some damn fried artichoke from the festival! *gag, but edible* The moment I get in, some fucking guy looks at me and goes \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING\", I think because I was still wearing my sunglasses. WHATEVER DOUCHE, would have been my response, but I was too busy trying not to slip on the beer ground. By beer ground I mean it was FLOODED.   And it was CROWDED. With popped collared chodes and slutty short-skirted bishes. While in line for the bathroom, one of my friends told us about the beer garden outside.   Now, when I've been drinking and around people who are fairly shy, I get mean. I mean, really, super mean. Like, example:   ::pushes girl with my purse:: Get out of my way, bitch friend that doesn't know me very well: Did you just push her? Me: Don't forget I called her a bitch friend that doesn't know me very well: You're crazy! Me: You...don't come here often, do you?  Beergarden: Not so much.   As I left and passed the patio from the sidewalk, I flipped off their customers and told them to shove it up their ass.  And promptly downed two bottles of Veuve on the rooftop of my friend's apartment looking over North Beach. I hope those rocks I threw in a drunken stupor managed to make their way over to your heads.",

They beer list on the large board on the wall was intimidatingly long - but a good excuse to fire up my \"Beer Cloud\" app on the phone. I enjoyed the Chatoe Single Malt Ale (even if the name made me expect a more caramelly than hoppy flavor - my bad) and really enjoyed the Morimoto Soba Ale. I'm excited to try more of the beers crafted in collaboration with Chef Morimoto. Unfortunately the quality of the pub didn't match the beers on offer. I went back to check out the beer garden, and it was a pretty small and unremarkable patio. The bathroom situation was also pretty dire, with one single-person bathroom to serve both genders for the entire beer garden and back room. Expect a line for each visit. The waitress did her best to keep us happy, but she didn't get much help. She came by twice to ask if everything was okay *after* I'd ordered my second and was sitting with an empty glass. She was obviously a bit pissed off at the bartender for taking so long, and was gracious enough to buy me the Soba - for that she got a good tip. I'd come back if it was quiet and I could grab an outside table on the street. Otherwise I'll just keep buying their beers at the liquor store.",

Why?  1. the wait service sucks. one time my husband and i walked in, sat down and weren't acknowledged for about 10 minutes. We left and went to Kennedy's down the road. This week the service was in and out. At one point the waitress chatted with someone for awhile before we could get her attention.  2. The food sucks. Last Thursday we stopped in for food and drinks. The buffalo wings are about as original as the Trader Joe's frozen kind but were overcooked. The Mac n Cheese is $5 but is clearly and distinctly Kraft mac n cheese from the blue box. No joke. There is no attempt to disguise it as anything but. The mac n cheese came with chips that were definitely of the Ruffles variety. Most were crumbly and broken. I guess from the bottom of the bag. My husbands Kobe beef burger was decent but dry.   3. The place is a little sticky in terms of cleanliness.  4. The beer that I wanted was out. Most of the selections had been wiped off. And really if you specialize in beer, most of your menu should be available. (They had some issues with the menu too - 3 items not available that night...)  One highlight - They have the cheapest Lambic Framboise in an SF resto/pub house/bar (that I've seen) at $7. It cost slightly less at Bevmo which means that they aren't really marking it up all that much. I can appreciate that.  With so many \"specialty beer microbrew lala\" places in SF, Rogue should try a bit harder. At least have decent bar bites or bring those prices down. $5 for Kraft mac n cheese? C'mon now.",

I'm happy to pay $5 to $6 for their pints of original and good quality brew, but not all the time and with no happy hour options, time is limited. Also, the prices for food are a little too high for the proportions you get. Prices are also inconsistent with the service-- although wait staff and bartenders have always been easy going, if it's busy, which it usually is, they have a tendency to not really look at you when you're trying to order something or blow off requests.  So I'm knocking a star off of a five-star rating, which is what Rogue would deserve if judged on quality of beers and food alone, because a.) lack of happy hour b.) high prices for sub-par service.  Perfect place for the occasional special beer, or to bring people who like beer, but not somewhere you could go regularly unless you've got a special budget for microbrews.

You get discounts on pints and merchandise as well. Cool spot to stop by once in a while, but not a regular destination.",

And since I spent my formative beer drinking years in Oregon with several microbreweries a stone's throw from my place/student apartment/squat/hovel, Rogue beers have always been kind of my poison.   The Mocha Porter is to beer what The Great Gatsby is to literature. It's a classic, and if you feel a little more enlightened and inspired after partaking in it. Even the worst Rogue (Dead Guy Ale) would be among the better offerings at other brewpubs.  The dinner menu, much like the Lakers, is all about Kobe. Yes, I know techincally it's Wagyu beef, but that's sort of like saying that champagne made in Napa is techincally California Sparkling wine. If you're not a beef eater, then this probably isn't the place you want to have dinner at but it shouldn't deter you from coming for a drink or two. I had the Kobe Beef Cheeseburger, which was approximately the size of the actual city of Kobe, Japan, and left overstuffed. My girlfriend had the fish tacos, and received a portion of fish slightly larger than a postage stamp. It was a real intersting juxtaposition. Another friend of mine ordered the Bleu Ball Sandwich, and the waiter had a \"Oh like I haven't heard that 500,000 times\" look on his face as we laughed for five minutes like 4th graders. For the record, the Bleu Balls were surprisingly dry.  All in all, this place is a rareity a brewpub with decent food. I'd go more often, if I lived closer.",

It was 30 minutes of anticipation that left my put away wet and yearning.   \u00a0 \u00a0So back to the love child. Typical local pub that brews it's own stuff. They have their specials in chalk listed behind the bar wall. They offered a large assortment of favorites with wacky names. The patio, aka beer garden, had tiki torches while the back room leading to it had like a floral type print near the television. The rustic wooden tables and chairs sorta had an Irish feel to it... like that of a cat eating you while the devil eats the cat... or perhaps like a an Asian restaurant strategically positioned next to a veterinarian hospital.   \u00a0 \u00a0 The top shelf of the bar is filled with Oscar trophies, while the bathroom is a small rectangular room with as much class as a card board box.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The service was a bit slow.

The flavor was ok but I would probably charge no more than 7 dollars with it, including fries.  The place is in a prime location so they probably survive on foot traffic which is also why they get away with being SEVERELY understaffed.

Great selection of Rogue's beers at decent prices. Tasty burgers. Kobe beef burger is very good, but probably not worth the price. Standard burger is almost as good, and definitely worth the price. When I went, the service was pretty good. My server offered a bunch of small taster cups of the beers I was interested in without being prompted, and was very friendly and low-key. Awesome digital jukebox with tons of less common songs. Atmosphere isn't great, but then again I wasn't there to meet people, just to drink good beer with friends.  This place is perfect for a walk from BART to whet the appetite, and a walk back to BART to sober one's self. 4/5 stars, given that you know to NOT order anything classy off the menu, and to drink beers. Ask for a taste of any beer before you buy a pint (grown up baskin robbins), and you can't go wrong.",

In my opinion, their darker beers far surpass their other ale varieties. I got the sampler which allows you to choose 4 of their extensive list of beers. My sampler ($8) included the Hazelnut Brown Ale, Mocha Porter, a Hefeweizen, and the Hop Red. By far, my favorite was the Mocha Porter. Not only do they have a lot of their own beers, but they have some guest beers on tap as well.   You can't really beat the location either. North Beach is lovely and a beer place like this suits it well. This place is a nice way to conclude a day at Coit Tower or in the park.   So, why 3.5 stars and not higher? The bartenders were a bit inattentive. One was even complaining about one of the other local brewers. I know many of the local brewers and thought this was in poor taste to be on the clock talking trash about one of them. The bathroom situation is also a little frustrating. One stall for men and one for women. This means you should plan to wait in line or hold it if it is a busy day such as the weekend.

I must say that I was happy with all of them. Their bitter and stout were top nouch. The amber could have been a little more less sucky. I also tried a sample of their barley wine -- think beer with a higher alcohol content. Oh barley wine, how do I love you, let me count the ways. This is the highlight of the tastings.   The beer is brewed out of a breweries in Oregon. This is a satellite bar/restaurant. The crowd appears to be a range of family, beer drinkers, and friends pregaming. I ordered the Pull Porn sandwich.

We decided on a couple of Kobe sliders and a basket of fries. \u00a0Not exactly the experience or meal we were looking for when we decided upon Rogue. \u00a0The sliders were alright, nothing special, kind of a waste of Kobe beef. \u00a0The fries came with a garlic cream sauce that was pretty good, but the fries weren't anything special.  Now the beer selection was very good as one would expect. \u00a0But the beer was served in plastic cups which, if it's not, should be a crime. \u00a0Who wants to drink a good beer in a little collapsible clear plastic cup. \u00a0That plastic cup cost them a star and really makes me question eating a $20 entree \u00a0from Rogue.  I'd be willing to give the Public House another shot when an event wasn't happening across the street. \u00a0But, I'm a little wary because even after compensating for larger crowds, they still didn't do a good job serving us quality food and drink.",

I just moved here from the Northwest and was familiar with Rogue up there so I was pleased to see you had a location in SF as well. Awesome. Staff is friendly, knowledgeable about beer, and the location is great. Prices are appropriate for a brewery and I liked how much space there was inside. Great place to enjoy some drinks with friends and catch a game on one of their several TV's. Their bathroom is very small though and there is only just one unisex one. I do have some different ratings on this place though:  5 stars- for their beer quality and options (massive menu!)  4 stars - for service (sometimes can be a bit slow and we were missing silverware and were not given extra plates for our appetizer)  2 stars - for food. It's a bit overpriced for the quality. Sounds tasty on the menu, but honestly, it's mediocre. My group and I decided we will not be getting food here again, just not worth it. Beer is amazing, we'll stick to that. I do not recommend their Irish Style Nachos. They are dry, barely any sauce/sour cream drizzle or cheese on them, meat is flavorless and chewy, and potatoes were dry and chewy as well.   We'll be back again for sure since their beer is amazing though! :)",

For food I went with exactly what my co-worker recommended.  I had the cup of Chili and three slider kobe burgers, one with blue cheese. \u00a0The food came quickly and was well presented and most of all absolutely delicious! \u00a0I enjoyed every bite and secret tip, dunking the sliders into the chili sauce at the bottom of your cup is a good way to get at the final drops. \u00a0I will probably pick something up on the way out of here, some souvenir to remind me of this place and will most certainly come back should I ever return to the city.

First off, this place is strategically located on a busy street corner, with an excellent view of the park and access to multiple transit lines, so there is definitely no excuse for not being able to get to this spot. The whole set up of this place is great, they have plenty of seating throughout the establishment, a full bar area with 20+ taps, great Rogue decor, a merchandise area, and some of the friendliest staff members around. I love that this place is fully stocked with all the current rogue craft beers and many of the Rogue spirits. If you make your way to this part of North Beach, stop by and grab a Double Dead Guy XS and a shot of Dead Guy Whiskey; just make sure you clear your afternoon schedule :)",

I expected a much better atmosphere. Truthfully, I felt like I was in a Knights of Columbus hall (we sat in the back room). It was oddly decorated, and the crowd was incredibly random. Anyway, my boyfriend and I each got a flight of 4 beers we hadn't tried yet. Neither of us were blown away. The chocolate stout was great, but aside from that, everything else was \"meh\". Additionally, the spaces in the wooden-paddle in which the beer glasses sat.. were filled with beer. So every time you grabbed a glass, it would drip all over you. An easy fix would have been to soak up the spilled beer with napkins, but our waitress was nowhere to be found. We received the check, waited over 15 minutes for her to come back, so we eventually walked to the bar and asked the bartender if he could close us out. Unfortunately, he told us snootily \"I'm not your server\". Oh.. I.. wasn't aware? I thought you were? Hmm..  Sarcasm.  We looked around, still no sight of our waitress, sat back down, waited several more minutes. Our waitress pops in and says \"you guys are so quiet back here\" as if that is a valid excuse to not check up on us. Perhaps if we had shouted \"WAITRESS\" we would have received better service?  I'm so confused by this establishment. Likely will not be returning.",

I've been to Rogue in the past to grab a quick beer on an evening bar crawl, but came and stayed for the first time last night with a group of friends for Wednesday trivia.   In short, the beers are pretty good, the food is an easy pass, and the service is hit or miss.   Literally. Our server remembered ~75% of the things we ordered (a notepad would have helped greatly), delaying the time we received those beers/food even further past the half hour it already took to run things out of the kitchen. Fancy, intricate dishes, like, you know, fries. Boo on being out of most of our first-choice beers, although I know those aren't the easiest things to control. :,-(   The trivia night (Wednesdays at 8 pm) are a lot of fun, and very-well run and organized. Make sure you get their up to an hour early to grab a table if you have a large party. There are about 6 rounds, and people get pretty intense. There are prizes for the 1st-3rd place finishers. It takes a couple hours if you're staying the whole time, and please, keep the smart phones in your pocket!   The food - all of it - I'll pass on in the future. My Hamburger &amp; Fries ($9) were akin to an elementary school cafeteria lunch. The meat seemed off, way too much mayo, wilted lettuce. The lettuce they use in the salads is very thinly shredded romaine, that also seemed tired and old. Maybe after a few beers, but definitely not for dinner out.   The beers are tap (that are readily available) are fairly good. They've got a wide spread of beers along each end of the hoppiness scale, and while the pumpkin ale I initially wanted was out, the other pumpkin-something beer I got was great ($7).

We ordered food and the plates had lots of chips in them they should have been thrown away. Food wasn't bad we had the hummus, cheese bread, irish nachos, and chicken strips. Irish Nachos and cheese bread were the best. As for the retail section they had a great beer selection. For clothing they had like 5o wire hangers on a rack with like 15 random shirts.

Well, upon my second day vacationing in San Francisco, I went venturing to the bars and restaurants surrounding Washington Square at about 11pm (prime time for debauchery).

I thought I walked into heaven as I found all the Rogue Nation beers on tap...then asked, idiotically at that, \"hey what's the name of this place\" -10 cool points  Anyhow, fresh Dead Guy Ale is amazing, the flavor notes are much stronger. Deep, almost hearty flavor with a mid colored honey. Also, I ordered a Bacon/Bleu cheese burger...probably the best I've ever had. THICK cut bacon had a slight brown sugar sweetness, Bleu cheese was sharply savory, the bun had a thin crust, soft, almost pillow-y. Other notables include Shakespeare Oak ale, Irish nachos, and Kobe taco salad.  It's been since July but I've compared every other beer and burger combo to this same one...none have come close in 5 months. Rogue Ale House serious has my heart...or...another reason why \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\"",

Twice the people I went with were wronged. \u00a0One ordered the same beer as I did and was served in a smaller glass. \u00a0Another friend ordered two vodka tonics and the second was served in a smaller glass! \u00a0  The food was the worst. \u00a0Frozen tatortots. \u00a0A french dip that had some rancid flavored meat between to old buns. But the truly terrible menu item was the sampler. \u00a0  Listed as made from Kobe beef were some meat balls, a slider, some sausages, and chips. \u00a0The kobe beef slider was not kobe beef, it was a frozen slider. \u00a0The meat ball was rock hard and had to be cut with a knife.   We sent it back and got it removed from the bill. \u00a0When the waiter came to clear the table, he grabed the sampler plate and said \"let me get this pile of shit out of here for you.\" \u00a0  Don't eat here. \u00a0Drink here. \u00a0nuff said",

If you looked up \"A-OK\" in the dictionary, I think a there would be a picture of Rogue Ales Public House listed right after a picture of my body, circa 2002 or so.   I need to get back to that size. But first, I need to stop having a kobe beef cheeseburger, fries, and a beer as a meal.  But who wants sit around and review Subway all day on Yelp?",

I love that they have about 15 different Rogue beers on tap on any given night &amp; about as many \"guest\" beers (one of them being Bud Light...seriously??). Of course I wanted to try them all, but I started with their American Amber &amp; hubby got the hefeweizen. The Amber was delicious, it reminded me of Alaskan Amber. The hefe was a tad sweet &amp; slightly citrusy. I loved their outdoor beer garden with long picnic tables &amp; umbrellas. We were here on a Sunday night so it wasn't crowded at all &amp; the weather was unseasonably warm so we could enjoy the outdoors without freezing our buns off.   I was ravenous when we arrived so I ordered the Kobe burger with cheese &amp; bacon. I'm not really into burgers but that night I just needed a heavy meal. Plus I only hear great things about Kobe beef. My burger was good, but it tasted like a regular ol' burger to me. Maybe someone can tell me why Kobe beef is so great? No biggie, I did enjoy my burger with wasabi mayo, toasted Kaiser roll, shoestring fries, &amp; a big pickle on the side. Hubby got the Rogue Dip, a roast beef sandwich with swiss &amp; au jus on the side. Looked too beefy for me but he really liked it. Unfortunately after wolfing down my burger I couldn't manage another beer so I had some of hubby's Hazelnut Brown. Yum! It was rich &amp; caramely. Too bad I was so full.   This seems like a nice spot to meet friends &amp; hang out. The inside is a bit run down &amp; dark so get a table outside if you can. The service was a bit off since we were on the patio but I think it was because it was a slow night &amp; they didn't have many servers on staff.",

    "review_text": "When I first discovered craft beer \u00a0almost a decade ago, Rogue was already a well established name on the scene. Along with Stone's \u00a0Arrogant Bastard, Rogue Dead Guy Ale was one of the first brews that swerved my interest from lagers to ales and macros toward good beer in general.  It really is cool that a brewery from Oregon has a taproom in California, right in the heart of San Francisco. Being in the City, I could not resist the urge to relive the memories and try some fresh Oregon legendary beer off the tap.   The interior has a very laid back, almost warehouse atmosphere to it with Rogue insignia spread all over and around. The taproom is not extremely large but they have plenty of seating. You can sit where you like and the server comes over to the table and takes your order. We did not get to try any food and went right to beer tasters.   They only do flights of their standard taps and no XS series, thought they have more than several on draft. This was slightly disappointing because I tried most of the standard Rogue brews and was looking forward to trying some of the beers that are harder to find or/and too expensive in bottles. No luck there. So we decided to go with two flights, each consisting of four 4oz sample glasses. While none of the beers were foul, there was not a single one that I loved so much that I would immediately repeat and get a pint of. Even good ol Dead Guy didn't taste as good as the first time.For a brewery out of Oregon with a taproom in California, one would think their main goal would be to present most of their beers to the widest possible audience. Not serving any of the XS series in flights does not go toward that goal at all. I am sure Rogue won't go out of business because of this, but it would certainly be nice to cater towards beer folks, not just casual beer drinkers or lost tourists.  All put together, I wouldn't mind coming to Rogue again and get a pint of one of the special brews, as they don't come in flights. However, that and the pricing might be a bit too much to give Rogue Public House more than a 3 star ranking. Even two flights we had came to $18 which is not cheap for the quantity given. Considering all the beer options in SF, Rogue fits right in the middle...you can have better but also much worse.",

Anyhow what you get here is tons of Rouge beers on tap, as well as various beers from guest breweries all at $6 a pint. There's also hard liquor, and a $6 sweet tea cocktail, which I wish I had noticed before I ordered the pomegranate cider.   2pm on a Tuesday is a great time to sit at the bar, ask the slightest question about any of the beers and receive a free sample in a large shot glass.   What you don't want to do at Rogue is eat. I required a snack today so I went with a cup of the Beer Cheese Soup, and while it fixed my crashing blood sugar, it was terribly over-salted, reminding me of the time I sampled the \"Brewers Platter\" (cheese plate) at the location in PDX and they gave me mushrooms.
