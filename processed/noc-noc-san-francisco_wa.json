No Coors! \u00a0Try something new!\" \u00a0They also carry some St. Peter's brews, which are delicious (i recommend the organic ale) and come in 16.9 oz bottles.  On the flipside, I'm not crazy about the design. \u00a0Maybe I'm not artsy enough. \u00a0I find a lot of the seating undesirable for a conversation with a group bigger than 4 unless you happen to nab one of the few seating areas that would be good for that size group. \u00a0Otherwise you end up in weird positions where maybe two people are sitting while everyone else avoids blocking the walkways in the bar. \u00a0I usually find that while Noc Noc can work with more than 4 people it usually seems best for 2 -3 people. \u00a0  This place is definitely worth coming to if you're looking for variety in your beer selection, but it may take you some time to deal with the design.",

I cut my drinking teeth at noc noc. I also learned a whole lot about music from one of the DJs there. In '97 there was no better place for an awkward music geek.   It had been about 10 years to the day since I'd set foot in there. At first glance, very little has changed; Dark as ever, same arty 80s music video decor, still beer &amp; wine only, the same blend of electronic &amp; avant garde from the DJ booth. I think Rahmat is still running the place too.  But some things have changed, for sure. The couches are cleaner, the bartenders aren't as friendly as they used to be, and the homeless guy with his dreads on a stick isn't milling around offering to tell tourists 'the story' for a few bucks. ('The story' was this aboriginal sounding creation myth that involved characters named after whoever was in his audience at the time.)

The barstools are carved, tall, wooden pieces that are fixed to the floor, so it can be a challenge to get in and out of your seat. But it's worth it, because the taps and cooler always have great beers (local and exotic) to try.

This place is awesome, incredible live dj almost every night( i think) you just have to peek thru secret slits to see what he or she is up to at night. this place is almost never crowded and every night ramad(man i forget the owner/best bartender evers name) and the beetlejuice atmosphere make it super fun. watch out for the magic stools though, they can take some getting used to.  why should every bar be the same, there are so many on that one block that being the same as the rest would be a bad business practice, and if you want walmart style beer, you probably need to head back to the marina and leave the rest of us alone.  get a draak. get some sake. have a great time.  (dude let me bring pizza and cakes in there for my birthday party, and even brought us napkins and things)",

Lots of cool seating and a few somewhat private areas that make it good for small groups. Music is loud, and the great tunes selection generally fits the vibe of the place.  4 stars mostly because, I understand it's a beer bar, but I usually need at least one shot of tequila to call it a successful night at the bar.

The NocNoc isn't a Zeitgeist with a feigned roughness that adds character or an in your face attitude. This is a place where everyone is welcome.  It's sad to read yet another obnoxious bitter review on Yelp, but I'm used to seeing this in the later days of Yelp's success.

To me, the answer is no, but Noc Noc is usually pretty crowded. And not just with eighteen year olds, but with older people too.

From the outside, it looks like a total dive bar and any other time I probably would have been a little weary of it. However, I trust him and he's a fan of this place. For a Wednesday night, this place was pretty popular. It's small, but there were probably at least 25-30 people inside. We ordered a couple beers at the bar and went to go find a comfy spot to sit.   The interior of this place is like a cave! But a tripped out cave! Graffiti everywhere, seating in random places, high back seats at the bar, and a black light by the window. Crazy, right? We found a spot in a cozy booth by the window to chat and drink our beers. Soon afterwards, we noticed a crowd of about 8-10 people sit in the booth next to us. It's a bit hard to describe, but essentially, these booths were completely separated except there was a gap in the partition by the window. So, when leaning up against the window, you could turn to your side and converse with the people in the other booth! The other group had ventured out to get donuts and brought them into the bar -- pretty cool idea. So, somehow we befriended these people and they passed us pieces of the different doughnuts to try.  As we enjoyed ourselves, the bartender came by to check on us and see how we were doing. When we finished up our drinks, he came by again to see if we wanted another and collected our empty cups. We declined, since we were finishing up for the night, but it was good to see he could handle the place all by himself and still provide great service.  We bid our new found friends farewell and headed out.  This place is definitely a cool bar I would go back to in the future. The beers were good, the atmosphere is a combination of hipster and cozy, and the crowd it attracts is a group of young and fun-loving people!",

Aside from this \"mebbe I went there once\" time I have not been to Noc Noc again until last night. \u00a0And, I didn't even have a drink there last night.  Let me explain why - considering I may or may not have been to this establishment during operating hours and have never bought or been served a drink there - that Noc Noc gets FIVE stars (ten, if I could give it ten.)  Picture this: Big Saturday party somewhere in the Mission. \u00a0Party ends, no one can get cabs. \u00a0There is one sober guy (Fong you rule) amongst a sea of drunks. \u00a0The sober guy takes pity on me - who really just wants to go home and go to bed, as opposed to continuing to party as everyone else seems inclined to do - and, says \"I'll give you guys a lift to X place where you - girl who wants to go home - can catch a cab back to the Avenues; and, you - three people who want to continue to party - can continue to party... but, FIRST I need to stop for some food.\"  Fair enough, sober guy with the car gets food. \u00a0Totally kosher with everyone. \u00a0Apparently, less kosher with the universe, as the first pizza place we try is closed. \u00a0McDonalds is closed. \u00a0Popeye's is closed (we actually didn't check - we just went on the assumption that if McDonalds on Haight was closed, Popeye's would be too.) \u00a0There is no Taco Bell with in a thirty mile radius (which is probably a good thing.) \u00a0At this point we are seriously considering either the Lucky Penny or eating one of the people in the car.  Then we find that \u00a0[Insert Name of Pizza Place Here] next to Noc Noc is open. \u00a0So sober, hungry driver and drunk, hungry friends jump in line to grab a slice and I go in search of a bathroom, as all the vodka and cranberry juice from the previous evening of partying is causing me to dance around like a five year old doing the pee-pee dance.  EXCEPT: It's almost three in the morning and EVERYTHING except for the pizza joint is closed.  I am about to cry, I have to go so badly, when I see the door to Noc Noc is still ajar. \u00a0I timidly knock (shut up) on Noc Noc's door and say, \"Hey would it be okay if I came in to use the bathroom real quick?\"  I fully expect a \"Fuck no, drunk girl who has to pee, we're closed.\" \u00a0But, instead - like a gift from God, Allah, the Earth Goddess or whatever you believe in - I hear the voice of Rahmat (the owner of the bar) saying, \"Sure, go ahead.\"  Not only does Rahmat let ME use the bathroom; but, he lets two of my drunk friends who are also doing the pee-pee dance use the bathroom.  Rahmat is the most AWESOME person on the face of the planet.  I promise you, I will be returning to Noc Noc and giving them my business (once I'm done with the whole three months of sobriety thing) as the awesomeness of Rahmat indicates that it will be a choice place to hang out.",

Parking in the city, well that's an issue anywhere in SF, expect to be walking a few blocks if you don't get lucky. Nice place to play bored games before the rush hour between 9pm-10ish. Convenient food next door Mystic Pizza and Rosamunde sausage grill to sober you up. Beer selection is limited to the best 40 beers and has some favorites like Chimay and Piraat. Hot/cold Saki selections are also available recommended nigori sake! The music is unbelievably nice drum n bass, trip hop, indie is the main selection. Usually a nice crowd of people and will get packed for a bit after 10pm on Friday and often Saturdays, which makes for good times. Definite must visit more than twice to get a feel for the place and make sure to say hello to the owners \u00a0and bartenders very nice people!",

After reading the website and reviews I thought it may be an interesting place to check out.... So I did  My first impression when walking in the door was \"wow what a cool place\"  The only way I can describe it is like the Disney Polynesian resort on acid? I mean that in an entirely good way, cave like feel, with lots of detail, patterns, textures and lots of nooks to chill. I commend the brave and TOTALLY unique design of the bar. The feel of the bar is def a local tight knit group of people that know each other by name. The patrons are extremely friendly have a sheek, urban, hipster feel, willing to make a toast to a stranger and converse. Beer and wine alcohol only, but I was impressed by the web site's descriptions of their unique specialty drinks. I'm hoping i caught the bartender on an off day because he really lacked in salesmanship skills. I informed him its my first time at this bar and told him I'll try anything. Trying to pull information about what to try seemed to annoy and tire him so I gave up and settled for the snakebite. Did I say settle? It was really no settle, it was fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would have rated this place much higher if I had decent bartender input, I'm sure he's an awesome guy and all but please sell your products.",

You kind of feel underground, unless you work your way into the nooks along the front window.   As much as I don't understand it, I also love it. Noc Noc is a great beer bar in the Lower Haight and offers a reprieve from a few of the sports-oriented bars or the divey nature of Molotov's. Noc Noc is not fancy, but t has quickly become a go-to if I find myself in the neighborhood at any time of the day.   There's nothing but beer, wine and sake here, and furthermore, there's \"no Bud, no Coors, no PBR.\" Instead, you have Allagash (my personal favorite), Chimay and Lagunitas. They also offer several Black and Tans, combining the best of beers and ciders (try a Snakebite.. Cider + Lager. Doesn't have the requisite blackcurrant as if you were in the UK.. but... it'll do.)  The space is pretty big and spread out, so that you and your group can always find a place to hang out. The aforementioned nooks by the window serve as booths, offering you privacy from other bar patrons, and/or perfect street-watching of passers-by. I've popped in on a random weekend afternoon, finding respite in its cave-like ambiance. But I've also been in the evenings, and while the crowds favor the evening hours, I never found it difficult to find space.  Overall, this is a place that I don't understand, but will keep trying.",

Were the strings of lights leftover from Christmas? or was it just part of the oddball decor. We warmed our hands by the fake fireplace, took a few looks around the dimly lit and weirdly decorated intereior, and grabbed seats at the bar.  Seventeen draft taps stared us down, with a menu offering beer drinks like Black Racer (a Guinness/Racer 5 black &amp; tan) and Uncle Pat (Guinness &amp; cider). Andrea, our cheery bartender-ette \u00a0was both fun and entertaining! The ample 16-oz pours were $1 off during HH (until 7 pm daily).  Noc Noc is another one of the reasons to check out the lower Haight! Its bars and restaurants are as good or better as in the more touristy Haight, and you'll find more locals and less traffic.

The dark industrial decor reminds me of what you would find in east Berlin - I hope that never changes. Because this joint is so unique and unlike any other place here in SF, I give it a well deserved 5 stars. No more smoking allowed indoors however, you'll have to join the bums outside for a cig or head over to Amber. And if you are in need of a set of Chimay or Duval glasses, the owner is kind enough to sell you a set - that was how I procured my first set of Belgian beer glasses.",

This is where you go when you want to ingest pure mescaline and achieve altered states like William Hurt. Or, if you're not into reforming your genetic matter via hallucinogenic drug intake, drink some brews and hunker down in a dark, shadowy corner.  I wish more bars took the incentive to make themselves bizarre art projects like this.  All that's well and good, of course. But I gotta say that I don't really like hanging out in Noc Noc. I don't know if it's because the other people are boring, or if the scene is too \"Haight-y,\" or what...but I usually drop in here for a single drink and then leave.

    "review_text": "Why the hell do I keep doing this? Noc Noc does not belong on Yelp. This place is simply under the radar. It doesn't give a shit about one or five stars or anything in between. It doesn't want to be cool or get popular, it already had its heyday 15 years ago. So consider this an anti-Yelp Yelp.   This place is always chill, there is always a table open. People are allowed to bring their dogs and food in - nobody cares. The crowd is always salt of the earth, LH style. The happy hour has $3 drafts. Mythic pizza is next door and you can bring slices in as stated above. It represents Lower Haight to a tee.  The music is the best part. It is seriously eclectic and good. Every single time I go there I hear tracks that bring back memories - the good underground tracks - everything from ambient to experimental to metal and punk. You cannot see the DJ's because they are hidden away in their little pod getting stoned. Don't even think of making a request because they will kill you.  The space, as mentioned before, is one of the most unique spaces in San Francisco for sure, and possibly in the US. It is straight out of Blade Runner meets Aliens meets Mad Max meets the Flintstones on acid. It is dark and dingy and weird and you feel like you are in some underwater world in the post apocalyptic future.   Actually, I take it back; the part about the anti-Yelp Yelp. I just went to their website and they make mention of Yelp so party on..   PS don't go there.",

Hip hip hip hip hooray!\"   - The Fraggles  Noc Noc is where Fraggle Rock (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFraggle_Rock&amp;s=72c848ab471cf673bd0a25e4230aeb55a6badb50ded2ebe809c1259a30237469\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr\u2026</a>) would have hung out in their downtime, in between Fraggle Rock sets....if they boozed it up (cause we all know they were smoking up) and weren't in the mood for flaming zambucca shots.   Bobby Trendy's macabre-obsessed cousin \u00a0could have easily decorated Noc Noc... blindfolded. It's interior looks like someone did a couple of whiffs of something and found some inner Burning Man persona and deco-puked all over the place.  And that's not necessarily a bad thing,  It's different. Noc Noc gives you something to look at. It's artistic and fun.  Borderline \"special.\"  Noc Noc takes takes majlis style seating to a new level. Their low cushioned floor seating reminds me of mandatory carpet story time in elementary school; picking at carpet lint, while I listened to the Little Engine that Could. Noc Noc's seating is similar, \u00a0intimate and relaxing. Their window alcoves are also fun spots to hang out, and are perfect for ( I stress small) group conversations and people watching.  And they have a live DJ. A big plus right there.  But athough Noc Noc has its unique charm, it isn't really my kind of bar. It lacks the warm atmosphere that I love about the Page Bar and they don't serve hard alcohol. \u00a0They only serve wine, sake, and beer. I've heard their wine and beer are solid, but it seems surreal toasting wine at Noc Noc, and \u00a0I have trouble finishing and appreciating beer lately.   The last time I finished a bottle or pint of beer...I was watching a new episode of Project Runway.  It's been awhile.  Additionally Noc Noc does get loud, and if you're perched on the corner of a table, you just get bits and pieces of stories.  Friend \"Yeah....he..........finger!\"   Me \"what?\"  Friend \"And she....stuffed.....pie!\"  Me \"what?\"  After playing conversation mad libs for a good half-hour, hanging out with the smokers outside of Noc Noc, becomes a welcome break.   Sigh of relief. Ears open. I can understand everything.  And it's always nice to get some light, because Noc Noc is dimly lit.  Sigh of relief. Eyes open. I can see everything.  But...  ... even though Noc Noc isn't where I'll take my weekend tolerance, if you're with the right people, and are quick on the claiming of seats, it has the potential to be a cozy and fun pre-gaming spot.",

When life hands you lemons, make some Mike's Hard Lemonade, ya dig?  It's pretty small, so seating is at a premium. Being that the Haight (more upper than lower) is pretty well known for their deep-seeded quirkiness, it's completely expected that a place like this would exist in this neighborhood.",

As others have mentioned, it's whimsical and downright mesmerizing. You can't look away from all of the eye-catching details. It feels like being in a cave that an artist has been living out of for a year. Definitely very Tim Burton-esque. Worth a visit just for the aesthetics.   They have incredible Happy Hour prices, so I suggest getting there before 7pm to take advantage of that. They serve lots of tasty beer, by the glass and in larger bottles to share. A few sake options, as well.   Some guy in a Minor Threat t-shirt drunkenly shouted at us to have a great evening.

For some reason, I always end up finding myself at Noc Noc even though I can't say that it's my favorite bar in the neighborhood. \u00a0There are some advantages this has over the others though. For one, it's usually the least packed of all the bars so that is always a plus if you are on a date or want to actually sit down when you're drinking. Secondly the staff is usually friendly. It's also dark in here which I like and lastly, the decor is anything but boring. It's like you walked into a Tim Burton movie set. \u00a0  Now for the bad and reasons why I think this bar could be so much better. The music here is almost always terrible. It's usually some kind of world beat or electronica...If you're into burning man then I guess this would be your kinda place. But it's not even the type of music they play that bothers me as much as it is the VOLUME. The place could be empty but they will always have the music blasting at the highest volume possible. I really dislike this about the bar. I think there is no reason for the music to be that loud. And the creepy DJ area is weird too. You can't see the DJ's and it would almost seem like they should just have a ipod hookup somewhere.   All that being said, I still think it's better than some of the other options in the neighborhood.",

There are a number of little sitting areas where you can fit 2-8 people comfortably, some with windows facing the street for good people-watching in the funky neighborhood.  The Tamale Lady stops here regularly, and you may also bring in food from nearby restaurants (Rosamunde and Wing Wings are my favorites).  Noc Noc doesn't usually get too crowded, and it is emminently welcoming of dogs. The bartenders are friendly and the bar accepts credit cards.  On a chilly SF evening, you can get hot sake here, and warm yourself up right quick.  Keep an eye out for the Hobgoblin beer, a tasty draught imported from England, which they get from time to time (though I haven't seen it recently).  I found an Alpine IPA there a couple weeks ago that was delicious, hopefully we will see more Alpines here now that Alpine has been acquired by Green Flash. (San Diego makes better beer than the Bay Area :( )  The only thing I wish for Noc Noc is that they would fix the little TV in the ceiling on the way to the bathroom. When it used to work it was a cool black &amp; white delayed closed-circuit that brightened up the space a bit and added some intrigue.",

I love the look of the place (the time or two I've been there at night it's a bit too dark for its own good, but while they're still daylight to creep in it's fantastic)... It feels like something a bunch of art students would put together, and I mean that in the best way possible. Everything's rough and organic and scrappy, very handmade and recycled looking -- and I do mean everything, from floor to ceiling. And yet I find all the seating and such really very comfortable, and pleasant to interact with.  Music's always been good, service is pretty good, prices are right. I've established a tradition of drinking only Newcastle at the Noc Noc, and vice versa, so the short selection doesn't really mean much to me.  Not the sort of bar I'd make an evening of, but a great late-afternoon prelude to whatever it is you will make an evening of. Also a great place to stop off with some friends and play board games (they have a ton, just ask at the bar).",

The furniture, the bar, and just about everything else are works of art and craft created by various folk from the original Japanese fellow who opened the place, to friends and family of the present owner. \u00a0Noc Noc is a work in progress.  The vibe here varies depending on the night of the week. \u00a0On weekend evenings it can get quite crowded and the crowd is mostly young and hip. \u00a0During the week, the regulars dominate, but for the most part, they don't bite. \u00a0If you are open to a new adventure, come on in. \u00a0Then again, if you are the sort who gets nervous in a place that doesn't resemble anyplace you've been before, maybe you're not ready for Noc Noc.  There is a live DJ every evening (from 9-ish, but the starting time may vary, as does the type of music).  Caveats: \u00a0Art as furniture may not be comfortable for people with back problems or other physical limitations. \u00a0The place is accessible, but accessible and comfortable are two different things. \u00a0Street parking in this neighborhood is extremely challenging (see my reviews of other local businesses for more), but it's well served by the Muni.  DISCLOSURE: \u00a0I am not and have never been employed here, nor do I have an interest in the business. \u00a0But I am a long-time regular and a neighbor, and over the years I've become friends with the owner and some of the employees.",

His house was awesome, his parents shopped at a place called \"Price Club\". Which meant they had 500 of every kind of food ever made. And if that ran out, there was more stored in the garage.  Anyway, his parents went to sleep, we stayed up all night long eating Airheads and Sour Skittles, watching all sorts of horror movies, with aliens, blood, guts, you know the good stuff.  We planned on staying up all night, but eventually the sugar high wares off and all those frozen pizzas we ate start making me heavy, as well as my eyelids.

The Location: The best location being in the Lower Haight. It is around a lot of other bars and food joints. Also extremely easy to access by pubic transport and car.  The Space: I am in love with the interior design. It's very dark, with an add-shot of new-wave, a dash of punk, and a hipster topping. There's a lot art, the furniture is great--specially the bar stools.   The Ambiance: Good, interesting people. It's the type of place where if you're there, you probably have something in common with the person next to you. All the people are alternative in some way--punk, hipster, goth, mod, nerd you name, it's here.  The Service: Very casual, just how I like it.   The Drinks: This is the part that makes me sad. They only serve wine and beer here. I need my Martini. I'm sorry, but Martinis are a necessity. The drinks are also overpriced.   Overall, this is totally my neighborhood hang-out place.",

This is exactly the kind of atmosphere I LOVE, but it's not for everyone. The music they play is cool, a lot of electronic and metal type stuff.

Never tried that combo but it was surprisingly good. The music isn't loud enough to drown out your voice. So, if you're looking for a change of pace away from televisions, go here.",

Prices were fair as well, my friends and I have been wanting to try the sculpin grapefruit from ballast point brewery and have not been able to find it anywhere, this place had it which automatically gave it a + in my books.

And honestly, I looked the place up on yelp. After BARTing in from the East Bay and determining what Muni we'd have to catch to get back and not get stranded in SF, we dragged our asses into Noc Noc.   I loved it. It looked like some sci fi bar with serious Blade Runner or Mad Max vibes. I kept expecting David Bowie to pop out from one of the dark cave corners and thrust his lycra-clad crotch in my direction while singing \"dance magic dance.\" And to me, this is always an excellent vibe to get from a bar.  My friend and I sat on the ground, drank what I remember was some pretty decent beer, and watched (from what i remember, once again) fish swim by on a giant screen.  I figure I had a great time because both my friend and I blacked out and have no clue how we got back to BART. I may have very well paid a homeless man to piggyback me the whole way, as far as I'm concerned. Regardless of missing hours of my life, the hours I do remember from Noc Noc I enjoyed, even if Bowie never did serenade me or buy me a beer.",

The menu is filled with good beer and sake. They don't serve the harder stuff, just beer, wine and sake. I'd say get here early, park yourself in that great cubby hole where the neon sign for the bar hangs and then stay a while, a long while because in a single night I've heard William Cargo, The Incredible Bongo Band and Carl Orf come floating out the speakers.

Lesson for those less knowledgeable than I:  Black Velvet = Stout and cider (i guess its supposed to be champagne, but nowadays cider is the common replacement.) Black and Tan= Stout or porter and pale ale Snakebite = Lager and cider, and \u00a0according to wikipedia... this is properly referred to as a Poor Man's Black Velvet.",

Chatted with someone at the bar and he said that it's usually packed on the weekends, but it's a great weeknight neighborhood bar.

I turn around, and sure enough, there's a shirtless woman (bra still on, don't get TOO excited), doing a \"sexy\" dance for the guy(s) sitting at the bar. It only lasted about 3-5 minutes, but it was definitely a sight to be seen. I sure have been known to do some pole/bar dancing myself, but I uuuuussually save that for clubs.   I have to applaud the bartender for allowing her to stay up there. It made Noc Nocs even more endearing to me.  FYI we drank: $4 Hefeweizen and $5 Rodenbach Pilsner.",

Every chair is unique and different, the best ones are the ones on the floor against the rough wall to the right hand side of the bar. Everything in \"the cave\" is one-of-a-kind, and it has a neanderthal-noir feel with animal print patterns floating around, crazy lighting(which fortunately for some, is rather low), and a DJ mixing an ecelectic mix throughout the entire journey.   It is also fantastic because if you come as a group you can sneak into an enclave to claim a niche near the window. \u00a0It is just the right size, located on the far east side of Haight near the park, and mainly locals roll through so it does not get too crowded.

It's a very small bar, but nevertheless with friendly staff and DRINKS SPECIALS. Try their noc noc specialty drinks, (usually around $5) they definitely knocked my socks on.  Noc Noc is not that pretentious kinda lounge where chicks wear skin tight dresses and dudes looking desparate. Expect a very laid back and eclectic crowd. During my visit, my crew shared our table with 3 other super cool guys.  Bottomline...decent price with unique drinks and very diverse, fun crowd.  One down side...no liquor served. :-(",

I arrived at least 15 minutes before the rest of my friends did and so I had quite a bit of time to take everything in. My first thought was that it was like nowhere I had ever been before. It had a dark, hippie, rave vibe to it which to me seemed like one giant oxymoron. Some how it kinda worked for them, though...  I walked up to the bar and realized quickly that they didn't serve anything outside of beer and wine. The couple next to me weren't quite as quick to catch on and kept asking for a vodka Red Bull. The bartender repeatedly screamed at them that they they didn't serve vodka Red Bulls which went way over their heads. \"What do you mean? Just pour some vodka and Red Bull together and accept this cash!\"   That was more entertaining than anything else but the reeealllly annoying thing about this bar were these giant, built in, wood backed stools that were ridiculously inconvenient. If you weren't sitting in them they were like a monumental obstacle standing in the way of you and your future beer. Bah!",

FYI - IF the music is too loud just ask the DJ to lower it because oftentimes they are in the booth and cannot come out to hear what it sounds like because they are distracted by their beautiful music. So it is helpful to go in there because they ain't mindreaders for chrissakes, and they are there to heighten your drinking experience. $3 happy hours are perfect for poor ass hipsters. This is my local bar but I'm REALLY biased, been going there for 8 years. They have a great Belgian beer selection, I highly recommend the Piraat to make you feel all piratey and less of a landlover (or landlubber can never tell what really was being said).

Happy hour is till 7pm and the cheapest beers start at $3. I was surprised to see Stone's RuinTen on tap here, but it kind of clues you in on their fairly progressive craft beer selection. During SF Beer week Noc Noc also plays hosts to a lot of tap takeovers so a nod to the bar owner.  Not usually my first destination for catching beer in the neighborhood but it's fun to show people around the diversity in bars in Lower Haight.

I'm not sure which is scarier: intruding on somebody else's used Tampon floating, unflushed in the women's toilet after you just ate a sausage at Rosamunde's and are feeling the frightening aftermath on your digestive system, or turning the lights on in this bar.  This place reminds me of the tactile dome, not only because of the strange decor and many touchable oddities, but because during the daylight it probably resembles Saddam Hussein's cave, with the addition of a dusty drain, chairs that are bolted to the floor, and a bar where the bartenders look at you like you ordered a tuna hand roll when asking for a Diet Coke.",

Inside is like a creepy-in-a-good-way cave, though you should prepare yourself for it to be packed to the gat damn gills on Saturday night. Like, we ate beforehand and kind of wished we didn't because we had to use all our strength to suck in our guts in order to fit into this place.   Back on my home planet, I don't really go out on the weekends because I'm \"not great in crowds\". I don't dig lines, being shoved, fighting to get up to the bar only to be semi-ignored for another 15-minutes, not having a place to sit or stand, and not being able to hear anything the people I'm with are saying... which was basically the deal here, but the decor and vibe are so interesting that I actually didn't mind it much at all.   It was dark and I'm getting old so I chose something off the only menu I was close enough to to be able to read... which was a beer menu and likely what I would've ordered had I been able to see the greater selection anyway. All the beers that looked interesting to me were crossed off the list, unfortunately, so I settled on a beer I probably could have gotten at the liquor store just door's down for half the price, but whatever. That's what i get for being late to the party. My beer for sure tasted kind of off, so much so that I didn't actually even end up drinking half of it, but again, I did not care because attention was being paid to the decor above all else, while my friends and I focused on re-enacted every scene in Beetlejuice that involved a Harry Belafonte song or Michael Keaton grabbing his nuts.

It's like being in an artsy, colorful cave...with random objects mosaic-ed together, broken bottles hanging from the ceiling, and rotating art on the walls from time to time.   I can't put a finger on the music they play, because it seems to be different every time...and there was a techno dj the last time I was there, so I know I can't tell you what to expect. (I do know that that night sparked a random dance party in the joint and the regulars were excited...)  The beer selection is solid enough for a bar that doesn't specialize in that genre, and the price is right, indeed. I think it's $4 a pint?   Noc-Noc is part of the Lower Haight rad-bar-sphere. It just adds to all that is tight in the 'hood.",

Last night Sammy, her manmeat and I decided on Noc Noc for a quick drink. \u00a0Coming off a 24 hour bender, I decided to be their non-alcoholic Marina Chode for the night.

Why do you need to do shrooms when you can just cruise to the Noc Noc.\\?",

    "review_text": "I'll admit, the bars on this strip of Haight do not jibe well with me. While Molotov's holds the distinction of being the first place I've ever seen cocaine, I've found most of the establishments in this area very forgettable. However, Noc Noc seems to be at least trying to be memorable.  You've probably heard people coming up with ways to describe their interior. My favorite: A spaceship crashed into a cave. It is unique and is likely the main draw of the place. They claim it is an art installation and in one of the corners you can read a placard about what the artist was going for. Oddly enough, the phrase \"Fraggle Rock\" is not mentioned.   The selection of beer is actually pretty good, emphasizing some Belgian bottles. I have always found the staff working the tiny bar area to be really friendly, so that's a plus. Space is tight and seating sporadic, which can make it difficult to sit back and enjoy a drink with friends.  So, while I try to avoid going out in this area, sometimes my friends insist. In those instances, I try to make the best of the situation and go to Noc Noc.",

Music blares from the speakers, so it's a tough place to talk, but a fun bar with interesting metalsmith decor and cheap beer. Don't get dressed up to come here, seriously. The only times I've been were, appropriately, for last-minute, \"Hey, I'm in the Lower Haight, want a drink somewhere\" nights.  Anyway, worth it if you're already in the 'hood, but perhaps not worth a trek from the other side of town. Not a bad walk from the Mission on a nice night, though.",

    "review_text": "Once upon a time, before everyone had a broadband Internet connection -- before most people had any type of Internet connection, really -- before the mid-90s tech boom, before the dotcoms, before the truly obscene rents and housing prices -- there was SF Net.  SF Net was a dialup BBS (it had public terminals, too -- you could log on from the Horseshoe, across the street from Noc Noc) filled with socially awkward types of people from all walks of life with many things in common, including an unquenching thirst for beverages alcoholic. At some point, long before I arrived on the board, Noc Noc became an official bar of sorts for the SF Net crowd. I understand that this had much to do with the Orbit Room down on Market uninviting the group, but that's not my story to tell.  I loved this place from the start. Loved its melty kind of Star Wars cantina look. The bar staff who made me fall in love with black &amp; tans. And snakebites. And many other forms of alcoholic goodness that could never, ever be called cocktails but always good goddamn drinking. Always liked the varied seating, except for the floor stuff. Never liked the floor stuff.  Noc Noc has always had a mixture of people, from the Lower Haight denizens to the slumming Marina types and everyone in between. Favorite memory came the night two sorority sisters walked into the bar, one delightedly saying to other \"Oh my god, didn't I tell you this place was FUNKY?\" This was the cue for two female friends sitting across the table to grope each other and scream \"IT'S A LESBIAN BAR! A LESBIAN BAR!\"  Well, SF Net is long gone and I don't go to Noc Noc that much anymore -- maybe a couple of times a year as opposed to every Friday night -- but it hasn't changed much over the years. Still sort of friendly, sort of strange, and sort of crowded. In San Francisco, that's probably as close as you can get to long-term stability.",

This bar makes The Clash look like Posers.   Great beer selection though. They serve St. Peter's, which I love.
