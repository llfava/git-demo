Stopped in here for drinks just as one of their small tables was opening up, and had a great time. You definitely feel like you're in a private home, since the space is intimate (read: tiny!) and the light levels are inviting (read: dim but not dark).  My friend and I had two rounds there, and both had different bevvs each time, and loved what we selected. We were killing time before a show, so we didn't have time enough to stick around and try their plated items.  Three stars (charming atmosphere, friendly staff behind the bar, and good value for expertly crafted cocktails) until I can return and try more of their offerings.",

It's a great little spot to cozy up with a book in 1 hand and a drink in another -- if it's not busy, of course, which is probably rare seeing how popular this place can be on the weekends.  We came on one of those rare occasions -- lots of available seats, so we were really able to appreciate the ambiance. \u00a0The servers were friendly and accommodating. The menu was limited and a bit on the pricey side for the portion size, but the food, while not spectacular, was good.  What we had: Braised pork meatballs  Scrambled eggs with asparagus and spring onions (brunch item) Grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup (the kids loved dipping the sandwich in the creamy soup)  They serve brunch from 11-3 on the weekends. Also, weekend happy hour is 1-4p -- loved their Salty Dog cocktail!",

The bartender was really friendly and made sure everyone was helped.   Now, onto the food. I was really disappointed in what we got. Maybe we ordered the wrong things and should have gone with the classic grilled cheese. We split the bean salad, which was nice but over dressed. In my opinion the short ribs were just not very good. For $15 the portion was very small because the ribs had barely any meat on them and tons of fat. I know they should have some fat, but I think they should be trimmed back a bit.  I would come back for the cocktails and the really nice dim ambiance, but probably not for a meal.",

The second time around was for brunch, and I thought the place was surprisingly empty on a Saturday around noon. I got the $13 duck cassoulet with 2 poached eggs. Eggs were poached perfectly but the rest of the cassoulet was kinda of a soupy slop with minimal threads of duck and some white beans. I expected a richer stew. This was served with 2 slices of baguette. My friend got a grilled cheese, which came with a small bowl of tomato soup. I sampled the grilled cheese and it was delicious and gooey and very very buttery. Also, \u00a0did not care for the house red, which tasted slightly sour.  So, hits and misses every time.

First of all, one of the best Manhattan Bars in town!!! Hands down. The bartender is awesome, and knows his stuff. Don't ask him whatever he would get, tell him what your' favorite tastes are. The Duke was great! Also, the fresh snacks and cheeses were a nice touch. The only thing keeping this from a 5 is the size of the place. It's narrow, and I'm a big guy, so I do like my space, but I make due each trip. I'll bet after another visit or two my care for the size of the place may get pushed aside and this becomes a 5.",

Two Sisters is a very tiny space that has more length than width. \u00a0A display window holds vintage-looking books. Aside from the tea lights on the bistro tables, \u00a0the only lights are coming from the festive holiday street lights and the sign at the bar. \u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/two-sisters-bar-and-books-san-francisco?select=gDTreoiP9WKw1sME1FYmjQ#7cs_wKkc_Qom1CTNjUkXLg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/two-\u2026</a>  Bars usually intimidate me but Two Sisters made me feel right at home with its \u00a0cozy Victorian-esque ambiance-- old books, candlelights, a display window. The jazz completed the scene without being played too loud. \u00a0The bartender is probably the friendliest and most relaxed one I have met. \u00a0Patrons that evening included a group of middle-aged folks in business attires, a girl reading a book, and a couple on a date.  IMBIBE: Two Sister provided a comfortable venue for me and my gf to catch up. \u00a0She took advantage of the HAPPY HOUR $3 DRAFT BEER while I ordered HARVEST MANHATTAN (a delicious concoction of rye, pumpkin liqueur, vermouth, bitters) $10 from the regular menu. Whew, so strong and so tasty!!!!!! 5 hours \u00a0later and I was still buzzed over this one drink!  EATS:  My gf (The Cute Yoga Queen) refused to eat prior to her session but I ordered a plate of CRATER LAKE BLUE $7. It came with a wedge of semi-firm blue cheese, crusty bread, marmalade and head of too raw garlic. Delightful! (I skipped the garlic.)<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/two-sisters-bar-and-books-san-francisco?select=gDTreoiP9WKw1sME1FYmjQ#IrspdiLR2adlfwp7Bc7DUg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/two-\u2026</a>  VERDICT: A great find! A darling little bar! It is now my new secret place on Hayes whenever I need a little respite from the crazy world. I will be back to try more the long list of wines and cocktails. A great place either for a FULL DINNER, CHARCUTERIE/CHEESE $7 \u00a0or LITTLE SNACKS$5 of potato chips or deviled eggs to go with your drinks.   FUTURE EATS: Nex time I will try a plate or two of the following big plates: \u00a0salad, fish, braised ribs and duck cassoulet.  TAB: $18 before tip (1 beer, 1 manhattan &amp; 1 cheese plate)  HAPPY HOUR Tues.-Fri. 4p - 6p/Sat.-Sun. 1p - 4p $5 cocktails and $3 beers  CASH ONLY.  A PERFECT VENUE FOR HOLIDAY DRINKS!

It was quite strong--the strong dose of alcohol and orange masked the taste of everything else, so it basically tasted like drinking pure alcohol with an orange in it, as opposed to, well, an old fashioned.

I suppose this place might have that ambiance during slower hours -- which is apparently not Wednesdays around 6pm. Overall, it was surprisingly dark for a place with a bookshelf full of reading material, super loud, and poorly laid out.   Regarding the layout: you have to go up to the bar to order, so if the line is more than two people deep, you're right on top of the tables next to the bar. (We made the mistake of sitting at one of these tables, and had lots of behinds, elbows, and purses in our personal space while we were eating.)  The food and drink were total five-star, though, which adds to my conflicted opinion -- I had the grilled cheese and the chamomile old fashioned, which were absolute perfection. My date had the Dark Matter, which I tasted and also loved. But I honestly had a hard time enjoying my food because I kept having to scrunch myself against the wall as people pushed past my table.  Really, if this place doubled in size and added some kind of sound-absorbing material, and maybe added a few extra lightbulbs, it would be just what I hoped it would be ... but alas, definitely not the case. It just wasn't the quiet drink 'n' bite over a cozy table I was hoping for.",

My girlfriend and I came here on what happened to be their 1st birthday party. $1 bourbon and $2 cava! These specials are good once year, though perhaps not next year. Since our previous visit in the winter, Two Sisters now accepts credit cards. Yea! Typically drinks here are on the pricey side, but in line with what I now expect in Hayes Valley. Often there will be 2-3 small plate options for nibbling, and perhaps a sandwich as well.",

So you can get an egg sandwich with bacon, a breakfast cocktail (bloody mary preferred by me, although the one here is a little citrusy), coffee, and something for desert for roughly 20 bucks. Now that's a decent deal for all that in the city.  I really like the look of this place too. Books line the wall on the side of the bar, there is a little booth by the window, and then tables line the other wall. All with super dim lighting and just this really old decor in a narrow room that cannot be more than 7 feet wide. It sort of makes this just seem like some classy back alley bar.",

For brunch we had the cobb salad, the summer squash sandwich, coffee, and one of their coffee +bourbon cocktails. The salad was by far the most disappointing thing- the bleu cheese dressing was watery/runnny, not very pungent or bleu cheese-y, and muted any other flavors in the salad. The salad also had a disproportionate amount of lettuce to egg, bacon, or avocado. As the bacon was more like ham, and not very salty, the whole combination with the watery dressing just tasted like a wet mess without much flavor.  The summer squash sandwich (which we added an egg to) was much better. Still a bit under seasoned through and we had to add ketchup to each bite. An okay sandwich but not solid by any means. The potatoes that came with the sandwich were also under seasoned and really had no flavor on their own. On the plus side, the ketchup seemed homemade which we appreciated.  The coffee here is excellent and our coffee cocktail quite yummy as well. Overall we would have rated the food 2.5-3 stars but given our experience with the place and their delicious cocktails, we rounded up to the 3.",

I love living in Hayes Valley, but it bothers me that this neighborhood doesn't really have any good neighborhood bars or cheap eateries. \u00a0I wanted Two Sisters Bar and Books to be at least one of those, but really, it is neither. \u00a0Instead, it's a cute little over-priced super-yuppie date spot, with that perfect hint of San Francisco pretension (one word: \"gastropub\"). \u00a0  There's great beer on tap (I got a Brekle's Brown Ale), a decent wine list, and a bunch of sexy cocktails. \u00a0At the bar sitting next to me was this adorable gay couple in their fifties, and one of the guys ordered, \"Two left hands, not to be confused with two left feet!\" in a way that was so adorable, but only because a gay man in his fifties said it. \u00a0Behind me there was a couple on a first date (it sounded like they met on the internet). \u00a0They were both really nervous and it was just so darned cute. \u00a0 The bartender, noticing that I was the only person in the place without a date or a friend, chatted with me a bit about Japan (my favorite topic of conversation). \u00a0That was a cute touch too. \u00a0Have I mentioned that this place is just terminally cute?  I ordered the lamb sandwich, which is served in a lake of olive oil, as all food should be served. \u00a0Virgin oil. \u00a0EXTRA virgin olive oil. \u00a0Deliciosso.  My one complaint is that the bartender poured his drinks using a jigger. \u00a0This has become more and more prevalent in American bars recently, I think. \u00a0What happened to bartenders who eyeball their pours? \u00a0It's a dying art. \u00a0Come on people, this isn't the UK--we're not required to pour drinks using measuring cups. \u00a0This isn't some bullshit nanny state where the government tells us how to get drunk, dammit! \u00a0U-S-A! \u00a0U-S-A! \u00a0  But I digress. \u00a0I am totally going back to Two Sisters Bar and Books on a date. \u00a0She'll be hella impressed.",

Service was a bit slow to start, probably took about 10 minutes to get a couple of drinks... but hey we're keeping it casual here. Anyway, last round was something else. Clearly signalling that we would like another round (empty glasses on bar, that hopeful look of wanting a drink....) really wasn't getting us too far, until my friend decides to be a bit more vocal (not aggressive just attention seeking). Result: one very snotty bar lady who feels we've insulted the entire bar keeping industry. Well, if you didn't want us back, you should have just said so...Anyway, no good being in the service industry if you can't deal with your customers in a polite way.

Tired of nearly almost all of the Hayes Valley restaurants, as I've eaten my way through it, very much like the Mission or the Financial District or the SoMa. Tried very hard to think what else and it dawned on me that I've read somewhere that this place could be good. Once I came here with colleagues and we couldn't get in because it was too busy.   Secured two counter seats. Score! One of us went to order: charcuterie for me, naturally, and pickle jar, also very me. My companion got a pulled pork dish and a cocktail. I stick to my water.  We caught up on things as I just landed. We talked about the rising food scene else where and our beloved New York has not changed at all. Though to our surprise, Daniel lost it's 3 star Michelin rating.   The wall paper is very chinoiserie. I loved the design. Old 1920s music was playing. Very moody and intimate. It's laid back and unpretentious. It's a bit of a book reader's dream. A drink, a small table, something light to eat, and then just read.  I had been on the go for a long time. Returning back to the new season of City Arts and Lectures down the street just seemed perfect when we got to eat here first.   Adding now to my-\"Oh I'm in Hayes and I should go to Chez Maman / Rich Table / Plaj / Suppenkuche / Monsieur Benjamin this time\", is Two Sisters. \u00a0Way better than Grove down the street near the Nourse.

Although this may be expected, but be prepared to wait 20~30 minutes for your chance to place a drink order, the bar is very narrow and was staffed by only one bartender the night we went. The cocktails are very labor intensive, and take a long time to make, which lead them to take awhile, but it leaves a long impatient line of people cramped along the seating area.

The food is also delicious but for the most part I've partaken in their carafes of wine and cheese plates, that is before the good news came through that they're stocking booze now too. Last night was the first night that they had the license, I was told, and the aforementioned bartender and a tall bearded gentleman were handcrafting some enormously delicious cocktails complete with burnt orange rind rubbed rims and swirly spoon stirrers and all that good stuff.   It's so great to see that Two Sisters really put thought into what their establishment was going to be. They're not slinging vodka sodas from the well (though I'm sure they would if you asked), rather they're going a thoughtful and upscale route with cocktails that already rival Orbit Room's. I highly recommend the Two Sisters cocktail but it's not for amateurs!  It's definitely on my list for brunch next. Two Sisters is a welcome addition to Hayes Valley, hope they stay a while!",

Its owner operated, by a wonderful group of people. They make great conversation, and you really feel welcome here.   The cocktails are very creative. Their use of bitters, vermouth, and liquor is off the charts. I've never had a bad drink here, and I've been very impressed with some of them. I love the food. The thing is that they don't try to do too much. They have a limited kitchen and they use it to make stuff that works great with what they're trying to do at the place. You don't really need to go here for a big dinner. Its a place to grab a drink and a snack.  The only knock I'd give this place is that its a little small. It works great for a neighborhood spot, but I can see it starting to get a little crowded during peak hours. I suppose I also don't like that they close pretty early. I wish they'd offer a late-night Happy Hour to drag us back in. \u00a0  I hated the old Marinos restaurant that used to be here, and think this is a much better use of the space.

Staffs: 3-4 stars since the bartender was reasonably nice. Decor: 1-2 stars mainly because the website and other yelp pictures portray this place as a mixture of a hipster bookstore and a classy bar. The venue turns out to be a tiny bar too dimmed to read anything and with a only handful of tables. The single book shelf there was small and purely for decorative purpose only.

I wish they had more cocktails with clear liquor though; almost all of them were made with either bourbon or whiskey. The bartender was super nice and it was cool being at the bar watching him make the drinks. We also ordered the mushroom pate, one of the salamis, and goat gouda, which came with honey-covered almonds and bread. They weren't amazing, but they were good.

(I recently returned, and was prompted to recall and write about this place.) I expected something vaguely 1920's Paris, given the literary implications in the title, and I wasn't disappointed. It's a great little spot with a nice atmosphere in which to while away a languid afternoon getting soused, and it's cozy enough for intimate conversations with one or two friends (don't bring a party). The bartender was friendly but almost aggressively helpful, and he was certainly hipsterrific, novelty mustache and all.   The books are more for show than for reading, which was a disappointment, but the thing that got me about this place, and the reason I can't give it more than three stars despite the cozy atmosphere and friendly service, was the wallpaper. I'm surprised no one has mentioned it. It's racist, depicting the pastoral stereotypes into which certain Westerners like to place Asians, such as women wearing conical hats near an elderly man practicing acupuncture underneath a sign that reads \"Chow Mein\". Quaint, right?Wrong. It's offensive. What this wallpaper has to do with sisterhood and the love of literature and alcohol I'll never know. It has more to do with ignorant whites exploiting a stereotype in an effort to create an aesthetic that will encourage you to spend your money.",

I felt like I could live in a walk-up studio like this and have a happy little life writing acoustic guitar songs, reading old memoirs, and eating vegan meals with my cat (although am neither a guitar-player, singer, memoir-reader, vegan, nor cat-owner).   There magically always seems to be enough space for everyone, as tiny as this bar is. After standing on the side for a bit, we sat ourselves on the bay window (equipped with pillows, books, and even a curtain), and found the table next to us empty within 10 minutes. We quickly moved over to secure our new spot.   All the drinks sounded delicious. Seriously. I couldn't choose. Between my friends and I, we ended up trying a few and were overall let down, besides the first drink below.  * back 40 - 5 stars (tennessee whiskey, lemon, lime, maple, bitters) Amazing! Delicious, refreshing, citrus-y and tart with a hint of sweet. We all loved this.  * harvest manhattan - 2.5 stars (rye, pumpkin liqueur, vermouth, bitters) I love autumn flavors and once had this amazing pumpkin cocktail that basically tasted like pumpkin-flavored eggnog. However, this was much more heavy on the liquors and was not a thick nor sweet drink. I definitely did not taste the pumpkin as much as I would have liked, and just found this drink to be way too strong.  * the dark knight - 3.5 stars (gin, cherry/balsamc vermouth, campari, sperol) I thought this was not bad - this had kind of a black lickerish flavor, but both my buddies absolutely hated it.

I had the Chamomile Old-Fashioned -- such an interesting spin on the typical Old-Fashioned, with a pleasant herbal aftertaste.

The red wine was delicious and only $5.00/glass. We had a meat and cheese plate that came with roasted garlic and a generous helping of thin sliced french bread. This is a relaxing atmosphere and we never felt rushed even though the place was full. It appeared that this was a place the locals gathered in the evening. The menu is limited, but what we had was very good. I would go back.",

My only complaint is that the fish they serve is rather pungent and stinks up the place every time they make it.",

    "review_text": "Update: I'm upping the stars. (1) Compared with many places I've been in SF, Two Sisters is definitely a spot I will frequent. It has a great vibe, a great location, and great cocktails. (2) My original post also forgot to include the deviled eggs. (3) The staff and management go above-and-beyond to deliver high quality service. Kudos. --- What a great neighborhood brunch spot. If you're looking for an artsy, bohemian vibe with creative cocktails and a bit of food, this is your place.   Small, dim, and cozy, we enjoyed brunch at a table in the front of the bar. My 10 year old daughter found a comfy reading nook in the window seat, and my spouse, mom, and I clustered around the small cafe table.   We tried a variety of the cocktails, and none disappointed. Each offered a luscious nose but delivered surprising, almost shockingly different tastes. Dry on the tongue but fragrant and sweet smelling, we indulged in a few.   I don't think Two Sisters really positions itself for its food; some dishes hit the mark while others missed it. All of the dishes were beautifully portioned -- not too large. Just enough to make you satisfied but not stuffed. I prefer smaller portions, as I subscribe to the clean plate club too often. Two Sisters did the portions just right.   As other reviewers point out, the deviled eggs are fantastic. In fact, we came to Two Sisters after seeing a review in the Chronicle for this dish. A definite must-have.  The tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich was by far the best dish flavor-wise. The English cheddar was strong, and the sandwich a bit greasy (not surprisingly, given the cheese). However, the sandwich was very good. The bread was firm but thinly sliced, which made eating it actually enjoyable. It didn't tear my mouth apart. The tomato soup with drizzled olive oil was fantastic. I'd order this dish again.   The savory roasted veggie bread pudding was a decent portion for brunch -- not too much, but just enough. Paired with a tart salad, it was creamy if not a little bland. The salad was mostly sprouts, which were a bit clumsy to eat. A more substantial lettuce, especially for the flavor of the dressing, would have worked well.   The seared tuna was OK taste-wise. Again, a perfect portion, but the execution was a little meager. It was overcooked, served with a zingy sauce, and rather unremarkable. However, I applaud the offering.  The delicious cocktails are nicely priced -- $10-$11, far below what other bars charge for similar drinks. In the end, the food is priced fairly.   For a funky, relaxed bar-cafe, Two Sisters ranks high. I'll definitely go back for the cocktails, and I will give the food another try. Great vibe, great staff, great place.",

The atmosphere is really cute too- it's a small and narrow bar. I probably wouldn't come here at night, as it looks like it would get packed.

This last time he was just plain rude, or one could call him enthusiastically sarcastic. While asking a question, in mid conversation walked away for no apparent reason. Then he lingered inches behind me and my table as I was leaving as if to count the cash on the spot. It was all very weird. Wish they would get a themselves a new bartender. So sad because we really do love this place. I wonder if I can find out what night he is not working. I'm hoping it isn't Two Sisters and a Brother.",

Two Sisters is awesome. \u00a0I don't know what kept me from popping in here the past couple of months, but now that I know how spectacular the food &amp; drink is it may become my new favorite spot. \u00a0It doesn't look like much from the outside, and given how dark it is inside you just might walk by and think it's closed. \u00a0But the dim lighting is all part of the calming experience, one that could just as easily be happening in a Parisian alley as on a busy street in Hayes Valley. \u00a0  Come in for a drink - I recommend the Two Sisters - and stay for the nibbles. \u00a0The cheese platters come with sliced baguette, a roasted garlic head (delicious), grapefruit jam and honey soaked almonds. \u00a0All for just $7. \u00a0Get two cheeses and a side of prosciutto and you just about have yourself a meal. \u00a0We also tried the Lamb Sandwich which was equally mouth watering - thin, tender slices of lamb with fried onions on a baguette. \u00a0 They have a decent happy hour 4-6PM, $3 beers, $5 wines and a couple of discounted cocktails. \u00a0This is the kind of place where you come expecting to have one drink, and two hours later you're licking your fingers from the good eats and ordering your third cocktail. \u00a0  It's cozy inside and great for couples but not so good for large groups. \u00a0Most seating is at bistro tables, plus maybe 8 additional seats at the bar and a wee bit of standing room. \u00a0Highly recommended. \u00a0Oh, it's CASH ONLY so make sure you come prepared (though there is an ATM in the back of the restaurant).",

An overpowering lemon-oil taste, but otherwise not much flavor. Really bad. The lamb sandwich was extremely gamey and even the chips were disappointing.

The setting is casual, slightly dark, somewhat occupied but not too crowded, and has a nice selection of music playing in the background. I seated myself at a table towards the back, across from the small bar. \u00a0The crowd was friendly, ranging from late 20's to late 40's and consisted of several couples and a group of three women at the table by the front window. \u00a0The d\u00e9cor is well done and there are plenty of books to pick from if you want to relax and read for a bit.  Service was friendly and prompt. \u00a0I ordered their signature Two Sisters - a twist on the classic Manhattan - and the snack special - spicy kale crustini with goat cheese. \u00a0Both were tasty - though the drink was a tad bit sweeter than I prefer.  As I sat there thinking of the recent life events the crowd slowly changed. \u00a0First, two women came in at the same time, but not together - they each sat at their own table along the wall. \u00a0Then as the couple started leaving, one by one, additional women came in. \u00a0Each of the earlier women had another woman join them at each of their tables, another two women came in and sat at the bar, and one more pair of friends met up and sat at yet another table. \u00a0During all this, on of the women at the front table left, leaving two.  So as I sat there finishing the last bite of spicy kale and enjoying the last sip of my Two Sisters, I realized that all the other patrons were pairs of women. \u00a0So here I sat at Two Sisters, drinking a Two Sisters, surrounded by 5 pairs of two women/sisters.  Just one more thing to reflect on.",

The space is nice for an intimate conversation and the cocktails are solid. They also offer some interesting small plates.  I have enjoyed a craft beer, aperitifs and cocktails here. The Two Sisters (a rye and cynar based cocktail) stands out. Their liquor selection is not as extensive as you \u00a0see at other cocktail bars but it is well curated with some of the best in every category.  I look forward to trying the walnut pate next time I am there. I got the mac and cheese which was interesting with the pretzel topping. I prefer a cheesier mac and cheese but theirs is inventive.

As lovers of quaint places, books and copious amounts of booze, my best friend and I made 2 attempts to patronize this business but were unsuccessful.   Firstly, this place is the size of a postage stamp. It cannot seat more than 15 comfortably. The pictures on the business website are misleading and none of the photos posted to Yelp show this. It is also almost completely pitch black, even more than most bars, which is ironic because you cannot read a book in there.  The first time we accidentally showed up in the middle of a book event. Ok, our bad, but why on earth are you holding large book events in such a ridiculously tiny space? We squeezed our way through, hoping the bar would be larger than it appeared from the street but were trapped in a crush of bodies and stuck listening to a reading of the THE most pretentious, yet vulgar prose. We couldn't get out again for a long while as the 'stage' was the only entrance/exit to the place. We tried to look at the menu, but were rebuffed by the staff.  Ok, so second time should work, right? Heading over after the Opera, we decided to try again as the cocktails *did* look delicious. We got there about 10:25 and were RUDELY informed by the bartender (as we headed for the one table free) that they were closing (they close at 11) and that it was last call RIGHT NOW. We hadn't even looked at him or approached the bar by this time. What kind of bar closes at 11pm on Thursday?! And what kind of bar makes their customers feel so unwelcome?  If you want the library atmosphere, good drinks and enough room to stretch your legs, try the Library Bar at the Hotel Rex. It also closes early during the week, but they are not rude about it.",

I popped by on their opening night last Friday, and the place was brimming wall-to-wall with babes. Perhaps they're friends of the Two Sisters themselves? Who knows, but it was certainly a notable gathering of attractive young women looking to have fun on a Friday. Take note!  Shallow observations aside, Two Sisters was quite the fun little hang. It's much smaller than I imagined before popping in, so you're in for a rather intimate experience. There's a small-ish bar area to the left, a few tables for larger groups to the right, an open kitchen, vintage wallpaper, and of course... the communal library right when you walk in. Such a cool concept: \u00a0you take a book, you leave a book. I saw everything from self-help books to literary classics to kid's books like Thomas the Train. Love it!  As for the eats/drinks, they're still operating with a beer and wine license only, so no cocktails for now... but they have a small selection of beers (many of which are local), and a modest wine list as well. I wasn't terribly blown away by either of the two wines I tasted, but for about $8/glass, it was just fine for a quick first splash of the night. I also dipped into a couple of small bites, even though I wasn't necessarily that hungry upon arrival. Being a fan of deviled eggs, I just had to give those a go... and they were pretty good. Certainly not the best I've had, but the chunks of prosciutto that made an appearance in the whipped yolk and ancho filling was a nice little treat. I also gave the chicken meatballs a whirl, and those little buggers were fantastic! I'd probably be inclined to order 'em every time I'm there and hankering for a snack. Bundles of ground chicken with spinach, pancetta, and white wine with a garnish of homemade pesto and grana padano cheese. Delicious!  Overall, a very good first impression! I can't wait to see what they have up their sleeve once they get their full liquor license, as I've heard rumblings that their east-coast style cocktails pack quite the alcoholic punch.

Back to Two Sisters- went there with a party of 4 at noon on a Sunday. I figured Two Sisters was more of a place to grab some drinks but was REALLY impressed by the food. For $20 you get a drink and something to eat which in SF is a pretty good value since you can easily blow more than $20 on brunch.

With subdued lighting, wood trim, and cases of old books, the atmosphere is very reflective, as is the large mirror behind the bar, on which the drink specials are written. Staff were quite friendly and timely. The space is narrow but it doesn't seem like the kind of place that's going to get choked and crowded; however, if you order food, be sure to clear your appetizer before the entree arrives, since the tables arent very large - there's just enough space for a plate and a book; keep your phone tucked away and enjoy unplugging for a bit.",

    "review_text": "I'd been wanting to check out Two Sisters for a while, but for inexplicable reasons only made it there yesterday. Wandered in around 4:45 on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised with the amount of open tables. Although it got way busier as the night progressed, so come early!  It's super cute + cozy - definitely my kind of digs! This place for sure succeeds in blending Krakow, Vienna, and Paris together into one bundle of awesomeness. It's kind of like a neighborhood version of Bourbon and Branch. Love that you can actually come in and just chill with some tea and a good book (although I definitely recommend doing that earlier in the evening - once the sun sets there's some serious mood lighting going on). Awesome background music reminiscent of Parisian caf\u00e9s.  As I've been nursing a cold lately, the obvious/intelligent decision would have been to get one of their pots of tea (for a very reasonable $3), but once I stumbled upon their list of tasty adult beverages, I couldn't resist. Everything's made with rye or bourbon here, so don't go looking for that vodka soda ;)  We tried the Two Sisters (templeton rye, cynar, punt e mes, brandied cherry) and The Duke (rittenhouse rye, carpano antica, amontillado). Both were fantastic, and The Duke definitely helped get rid of my sore throat ;)  4 stars because, while fabulous options, there were only 4 cocktail offerings. And I kinda wanted to try the seemingly delicious Port of SF concoction, although it appears their non-spirituous beverages are no longer on the menu since they've acquired their liquor license.  Didn't get to try any food, but I'd come back in a second to check out their brunch deal.",

The dark decor, lit only by the twilight and a few scattered candles, and the shelves of free books by the door...I was at home. Same kind of Euro mixed purpose spaces that I love; you can drink a little, read, repeat, eat, strain your eyes reading in the moody lighting, listen to music, have hours of conversation. All within a tiny place that wraps its arms around you tightly and plies you with crafty cocktails.   While waiting for my wonderful friend, who I think was whom Jim Henson had in mind with the quote above, I scored the last table and put it to good use by finishing a novel and having their house red. My mom would have been appalled at me reading in such low lighting, and while sipping such unpalatable wine while doing so. Recommend that you skip the house red, and invest in their other BTG offerings or just buzz straight to the cocktails. Their bergamont bees knees is wonderful and a seriously refreshing take on the classic.   Girls night out was in full-swing when we were here. Not sure if it was a coincidence or if the Y chromosomes in SF are intimidated by a place called 'Two Sisters'. All the ladies seemed to be having serious conversations and we followed suit...cocktails in hand, of course. Gab sessions are always enhanced with candles, cocktails, and pretzel-covered mac n'cheese, no?   Bring your old friends and your new friends, and make friends with this special spot. \u00a0The Sisters only deal in cash, by the way. Kermit says it's not easy being green, but it has to happen here. There's an atm in the back by the restroom.",

Books, drinks, family... deviled eggs... there's not much more to life than that.  The deviled eggs appetizer came out with only three deviled eggs... which I don't understand from even a basic level. You boil two eggs, you get four halves... and I don't have to look like \"skinny girlfriend\" asking to to split the third between the two of us.   Shepard's pie wasn't very flavorful, but it was a good portion, which aptly describes about three-quarters of shepard's pie I've ever had. :(  The grilled cheese sandwich was crispy and perfect and cheesy, it came with a delicious tomato soup that had a very very strong tomato taste.  We will definitely return - and I will make two orders of deviled eggs - so that my boyfriend can stuff me full of deliciousness without reminding me of my figure.",

The food is inventive and hearty, and they do a lot with a small menu. And the drinks just can't be beat, they are so, so good! A fun off-the-usual-path place to have brunch!  I'm a Hayes Valley resident, and I was really glad when a cute new place opened in this spot. So far, I'm mostly a fan, with a few exceptions. I'll start with the good: the atmosphere is great--intimate, moody, peaceful. The drinks are exceptionally good, my current fave being the chamomile old fashioned. Now for the so-so: The food is homey and tasty but inconsistent. For instance, the first time I had the grilled cheese, it was served to me with the bread blackened. Seriously. It was burnt. I loved the soup that came with it, though, so the next time I went I ordered the grilled cheese again anyway. That time, it was cooked perfectly, and the soup was just as memorable. But in a spot where I was one of only 3 customers in the place, I would have expected something simple like a grilled cheese sandwich to be cooked properly EVERY time. The service is...interesting. I've had a couple of different people behind the counter when I've gone, and there's one very nice lady who makes a great cocktail, and there's another one who simply isn't socialized correctly. Not to say she's overtly rude, but there's just not a friendly vibe there. In such an intimate setting, warm service really is a necessity. I hope they work on this, I'd love to see the business stay successful.",

I've been to Hayes Valley quite a few times but never noticed or saw this establishment. We got a table for two pretty easily. You help yourself and order at the bar, and they'll bring it to you at your table. Though I ordered something that was too strong to drink, I can't complain since that was my own fault!  The snacks were good! Mac 'n cheese - Nice and cheesy but agree the pretzel isn't necessary Arugula salad - Solid. Chicken meatballs - Tasty. Juicy. Saucy. Berkshire charcuterie - YUM! My favorite.  Love the romantic dimly lit feel in here. Perfect for relaxing and hanging out.",
