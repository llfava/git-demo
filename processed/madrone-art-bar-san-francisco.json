That night it was upscale hipsters -- call them \"hippers\", as in hipper-than-thou.  Tuesday nights at this small lounge-cum-dancefloor feature the best urban-inspired DJ-ing west of Van Ness. The chill music and vibe draw a colorful crowd (sartorially and dermatologically) that skews \u00a0late 20s/early 30s. Lots and lots of eye candy.  While the clientele may be inconsistent over the week, one thing that stays good all the time is the creative drink specials. In September, the place was packed for $2.00 Red Stripe Tuesdays, while Saturdays featured five-buck Beer + Fernet.  All in all, I'd stick with a weeknight visit to Madrone. It's the best time to savor the lowkey atmosphere, and above all, you'll avoid paying $5 cover for thug love.",

Weekends on the other hand? There's barely enough room to move, let alone dance. I had to wait 20 minutes to get in last night for the Prince/Michael Jackson danceoff, and for the first hour regretted the fact that I had stumbled into a sauna. Not to mention the fact that it took another 20 minutes to get to the bar and order a drink (they really need to up the number of bartenders up to three on the weekends).  Luckily, my friends staked out a spot right next to one of the two giant fans which made it somewhat bearable. A lot of folks started to clear out around 12:30 since they couldn't stand the heat or the inability to bust-a-move. By this time the DJs finally kicked it up a notch and were busting out their A game (Erotic City/Wanna Be Startin' Somethin/Billie Jean/Let's Go Crazy /When Doves Cry/Workin Day and Night), so the final hour and half led to a super amazing time for all willing to stick it out. Nonetheless, I hope I never find myself at this place on a weekend ever again -- or at least until MJ v. Prince 5 next year...",

(Unfortunately, you don't get to drink out of the ones on the back of the bar...they're just for appearance.) Still, I love me some vodka, especially when it has a hint of pomegranate or cucumber. Say it with me, fans: Tasty.  Next, the bartenders are genuinely friendly and helpful. Ashley (who works on Monday night) is so attentive that another drink is instantly placed in front of me before I even have the chance to order it (a trait much more appreciated when I've actually eaten dinner that night...drunk Connect Four definitely ensued.)  Like my men, I also appreciate a bar who understands that planning activities is a must. While I don't like sitting around all weekend in front of the television ALL of the time, nor do I enjoy going to the same ol' bar for the same ol' thing. I mean yes, we'll be drinking, but spice it up a bit. Add a DJ. Add a game night. Add local art. Madrone does this, and does this well. If Madrone was my boyfriend, he'd get a home-cooked meal in appreciation. And other stuff.  My favorite night of the week to come is Monday, when locals get the $2 highballs just for living in the neighborhood. YAY, 94117, you rock.  In short, Madrone: would you like to go out?

As i stepped into the bar my mouth instantly dropped as I saw countless beautiful girls dancing to funky mo-town music with doper then dope decorations of designer ak-47s and animal tusks. My love for the bar only grew as i made my way to the bar to grab a beer. Whatever kind of brew you want, they have, and at great prices. We then made are way back to the dance floor and a women giving messages for 1 dollar a minute, hells yea. We then jointed the girls on the dance floor and danced, I wasnt even drunk but the music was so good you could not help but groove.This bar is simply awesome.

They are so high, in fact, that I wouldn't be surprised if completely self contained weather systems form in there and it sometimes rains or snows, which would explain why most of the male patrons were wearing sweatshirts or jackets with the hoods up over their heads.  You will also notice you aren't as cool as the bartender or any of the patrons; In fact, the petit-burgoise banality of your presence is offensive to them. Don't worry, I'm not as cool as they are either, nor is anyone else I know. I am at peace with this.  But looking further, you'll notice the live DJ and sizeable dance floor, the comfortable antique chairs and couches (the kind of arts &amp; craftsish one in the southwest corner of the room is particulary soft.

Not that it matters, since nobody seemed to recognize me anyway. And those who met me that night probably forgot my name 5 seconds after I said it.  The place also became extremely crowded around 11 or so and the music became really loud. Too bad, it was nice when it's still kinda loungey and people could actually talk. Love the sofas, by the way. The anime on the big screen was a nice touch. Although if they had played some tentacle porn anime, they could've gotten even more customers and I'd be less bored.  Happy hour drinks were good. 2 beers, a lemon drop, and a rum &amp; coke cost $15. Not bad, eh? They also have infused vodkas.

The bartenders were cool.   There are some delicious cocktails; the Lola especially with the house made cucumber infused vodka. When I got my second drink of the night, the bartender noticed the bottle was running low, so he kinda shrugged and just dumped the rest of it in to my drink. I AM OKAY WITH THIS! I like booze. Make is strong, baby! The damage is around $8 for liquor.   The only real reason why I only give Madrone three stars is because it gets so ridiculously packed. I really wanted to dance. I desperately wanted to dance. But there is simply no room to do so. That's especially heart breaking when you love the classic tunes of Prince and MJ.   Because it gets so packed you also run in to the debacle of what becomes the restroom line. Where is the line? You can't really tell because it's so packed. When you exit the restroom, it's likely you'll accidentally slam the door in to a poor soul that thought they found a decent spot to stand or dance.  I really hope Madrone either expands for this event, or that the Prince vs MJ people take their show to a bigger venue. It's so jammed with people that despite my love for the music and the friendly service, I probably won't be back.  We left around 11pm because it was so suffocating. As we were leaving, some friends just walked in. They asked the guy at the front door if they could get their money back since we were leaving (and since they were there for a total of 2 seconds), and he did. Cool.",

I would guess there were 200 people packed in, and the bouncers were still not bothering to form a line outside. They seriously should be investigated by the fire department.  I left after 10 minutes. Not a chance in hell I'll be back. ------------------  I am such a liar. I did go back for another rendition of Prince v. Michael. I'm adding two stars to my previous review. One star because my friends all got laid or almost laid that night. Half a star because Prohibition Ale was only $3. And another half a star because they were nice to me when I came back for my forgotten credit card 2 days later.",

Mostly the service. \u00a0We went in planning to spend 3 martini's here and do some serious chat-catch-up. The 1st round (we were sitting @ the bar) took about 10 minutes to get one of the 2 male bartenders attention. Our empty glasses sat on the bar right in front of one of them and the new bartender arrival as they talked and set up the well for the coming evening. \u00a0 We were there about 7PM..... I finally flagged down the bartender (standing RIGHT in front of me, ignoring our 15 minute empty glasses) and ordered a 2nd round. I watched as he went to the register, pulled $ out and then seemed to tip out/count out and leave. \u00a0HUH?! The female bartender coming on eventually came to us and took the order, made the drinks as if we were interrupting her placing mats chore and gave them to us without so much as a smile.  The sign on the wall was what got me. \u00a0(and our 3rd drink to cease existence) It read(s): \"Bartenders live complicated lives; \u00a0therefore all drinks on this menu are to be made at the bartenders discretion, depending on how busy he or she is, mood, or available ingredients.\"   --Sounds like a \"we are better than you, so just wait and we'll get to you when we damn well feel like it\"  Shame, could have been a good night.....  **PS. After writing this review, the owner, Mike has responded to me and I feel satisfied there is an action plan in the works so this doesn't happen anymore. \u00a0 I don't mean to be mean, I just like good/friendly/prompt service (&amp; tip healthy for it!)

This makes daddy very very happy. This bar offers a good cheap drunk, without \u00a0scummy patrons.  On the more epic side, this bar has a Prince vs. Micheal Jackson dance party once a month. I have attended, and it is certainly fun. Who wins the battle you ask ? Prince. He slept with Carmen Electra. Micheal is into little boys.  After Hailey P.'s birthday dinner at Bar 821, we all came here again to get our dance on. We waited for a solid 45 minutes to get the dj to stop playing a mix of lame skateboard trick videos. I am serious. skateboarding tricks. If I want to see kick flips and ollies, I would of stayed home with youtube. Besides being lame, it totally killed on the Saturday night vibe. FAIL MADRONE ! CUT IT OUT !   Haiku !  Skateboarding vids lame Drown the anger with alcohol Dirty gins saved me  Talent Level ? This bar has a mixed bag of talent, and it always seems to have a ton of dudes.

It's one room and not very spacious. It's a art lounge and there are comfy sofas and chairs that line one side of the wall. I like the dark blue walls and the painting over the bar is awesome! \n  They have an extensive menu of infused vodkas and I went with the pear on the rocks. It was NOT good at all. I could hardly taste the pear. It just tasted like bad vodka. However, the boy tried the Oatmeal Stout and it was awesome - an after taste of toast. How cool is that??? \n  The only thing I did not enjoy, besides the infused vodka, was how they had a photographer taking pictures and the flash was super bright and blinding.\n  I would definitely come back and check out another show.",

There's always a new friend to meet, the couches are conductive to eavesdropping or giving some guy a thumbs up for his mad skills only to find out that he's gay and his female companion is more interested in making you understand that self-deprecating is no longer in. We all have to hot and nasty!  On warning though, just cause it's infused vodka doesn't mean that it's not vodka. Some of us found out the hard way or should I say some of don't even remember going to madrone, while others forgot to lock the WC and had someone walk in on them. So wear you nice panties.

The evening is still comfortable for nerding out even as the place starts to fill up.   They've had a live DJ every night I stuck around, and the new speaker system is aimed toward the back so you can have a decent conversation in the front. Bartenders are awesome, and after helping the doorman with his iPod I got a handful of drinks on him.

The prices are better and you will actually get to enjoy sitting on one of their antique chairs or couches, listening to DJs who know how to mix some decent tunes and might even manage to get a drink from the bartenders who tend to take their sweet ass time.   Sit back, relax and enjoy it, or get up and dance on their smallish dance floor if you are so inclined. They may even be playing one of the many many Godzilla movies projected on the back wall.

However, I'm not sure it achieves this hybrid successfully ... there isn't always enough space to dance and sometimes the music doesn't seem loud enough or even dancey enough. But there's not much space to sit and chat/enjoy your drinks either.   Personally, if I'm in the mood for dancing, I'd go elsewhere, and if I'm in the mood for not-dancing, I'd also go elsewhere.

The selection was pretty decent and they did have the Lunatic Lager which I found to be pretty delicious.   As far as atmosphere goes I'd say this is where they really excelled. I came on an 80s night so they had old school 80s videoson big projectors with awesome dance/techno remixes of classic 80s songs. The music was pretty loud which made talking slightly difficult but definitely possible. Most people were standing closer to the bar and there was a DJ with a small dance floor going on towards the front of the bar. Also, the art all around the bar set a really cool artsy mood and also provided topics for conversation.  Overall definitely a very cool bar, not somewhere I would go casually or very often because of the cover and music volume..but if I'm planning on a long night of debauchery...this is definitely an awesome place to stay.",

Although I did get the eyeball from the female bartender (who it seems like on the reviews isn't particularly friendly) when she noticed I carried a certain purse, and then promptly walked a few feet away and helped some other girl waiting after me. NICE.  I liked the music the dj was spinning and the general crowd, as it didn't seem too Marina-esque (a nice change from my neighborhood) nor did it seem to be the equally pretentious hipster scene.  I am also amused by the nomenclature of \" WC\" for the bathrooms. All night long \u00a0I heard, \"what is WC?\".

Oh, and even though tea and coffee are listed with prices on the menu, the bartender will tell you that \"there's a coffeeshop over there *waves in the direction of N Divisadero* if you want that kind of thing\" when you ask for coffee in order to sober up after your 11ty-th beer.

    "review_text": "\"Everyone in the car in on parking spot patrol! You understand this, I'm not f'in kidding now!\" The words escape my lips everytime I'm in that neighborhood, as I don't have a Smart car, it's a little trickier to get my four door sedan into a spot without the front of my hood peeking precariously into the red zones.   Madrone is on the corner of Divis and Fell (Divisadero for those new to the area or not loca (thats insane local people FYI)) in an area that has been up and coming for years now. Spotted with late night bars and great food, the thing most difficult about coming here is, as I've already duly noted, the parking.   You won't find me at Madrone often, due to the inability to breathe or move really through the tiny establishment, unless it's a night like tonight, the third Saturday of the month, for PVM. For those unaccustomed to the acronym, thats Prince Versus Michael. The all important evening for us 80's whores still holding on to our leg warmers and arm cozies from 1986. A battle occurs at midnight, after rockin' out to nothing but the king of pop and my petite latin friend for hours, allowing the crowd to somewhat dance battle (or at least we do) who takes the crown for the evening. The cover is cheap, about 5 bucks, so it's affordable for those looking for a low maintenance night without all the drama.  It's a pain in the ass for me to get to the bar, and I don't usually have the patience to wait and get their attention anyway. So these nights tend to be sober ones, and we still have a bangin' time. My girl Meredith posts in her usual location, the unofficial queen of PVM, by the large fan (also the only space that has available oxygen) in the front of the room right next to the D.J. You can feel the bass go through your heels and into your fly ass booty, helping you move it and shake as we reminisce of the days when rent was paid for you and cigarettes still only cost $2.15.   The bathroom always has a line for it, which for I have no patience to wait. Usually cruising across the street to the local gas station, we climb the stairs and open doors and turn on sinks, lift toilet seats with our feet and \"float\" above them with the only goal of completing \"Operation Clean Hands\" with absolute perfection and not accumulating bacteria and some nasty disease along the way.   If you feel like breakin' it out, and sweating to the oldies (yeah, I know, the musics \"old\" now but it wasn't really THAT long ago), come to Madrone tonight. You'll find me at the front with Mer, shakin' my ass like it's goin' outta style. You'll find me, I'm easy to spot. Remember, my hair's not red, it's magenta.",

Also, some \u00a0girl bumped into my friend just as she was handed her drink, spilling the entire contents. The bartender gave her a new one right away, which was nice.

And while we're at it (yak yak...) why do they call it a lounge when people are packed shoulder to shoulder with pounding music, shrieking to eachother to be heard, and in order to get a drink you have to lunge through a 15 person parameter at the bar then wait an eon for a drink. Does that scenario evoke the word lounge? Please.   In some ways this is a cool place because of the diversity of folks there. The dance floor has a mellow vibe despite the stifling crowd, and the people are there to have fun.  Otherwise, an incredibly annoying part is the length of time it takes to get a drink. We're talking 30 or 40 minutes. Five dollar cover, no big deal. But having to wait that long for a drink - suckola. I just don't think I'd go back because it's too packed and undrinkable and conversing isn't really an option. They have some clever drink names, and me and my friend stood there hollering, \"what's a dirty sanchez, again?\"  So basically you just wait to get a drink, \u00a0look and dance. And god, the dancing. This place has some good dancers and some epic bad dancers. Epic bad. And the dance floor and the standing places don't really have distinct beginnings or ends, so you might be standing next to a fool and their fool dust could rub off on you. :-)   I have the impulse to give this place less stars because it's so so hot in there, and the whole drink issue, but their watermelon infused vodka was really excellent, and the movie playing on the screen was a potential conversation starter, and there were a lot of fun-to-look-at people and sometimes, really, that's all you need.   At 12:34 we went out side for a \"smoke break\" and left before it got sad. So I have no bad memories.",

The furniture is not inviting, the bathroom situation is just disastrous, and - the bartenders are totally rude. Unless of course, you're a drunken hipster who looks like he's about the throw down a bunch of cash. If you're a cute little girl with glasses who isn't content with a tall boy of Bud, then you're getting no love. I avoid going to Madrone at all costs but last night a friend reeeeeeally wanted me to join him for hip hop night. We hadn't hung out in a while so I reluctantly agreed to meet him after work. When I got there I was told it was a $2 cover. Not bad. Except for the fact that I didn't have $2 on me. The door guy was sweet (what?!?!) and let me with a smile. Maybe this place is turning around, I thought. That was, until I made my way inside. I'm sorry, did I come for hip-hop night or I-wish-I-was-hip night? Confusing. To everyone's credit, they were ALL trying their best to be super hip. Sleepy eyed and drunk, messy hair, expensive hoodies. . . It was if they had all just come from How to BE Hip-Hop 101  \"Hay guys, once class is out let's head over to Madrone and try out our mad skills.\"  \"For real, dog.\" I made my way to the bar and was ignored. And ignored some more. Finally I got the bartender to hand me a drink list. My friend promised to buy me a drink but I couldn't find him through the crowd so I thought I'd just put my drink on my card. Just as I was about to start waving my hands and jumping up and down in order to get the bartenders attention, I hear her tell a guy behind me that there was a $20 minimum on the tabs. Ugh. There was no way I was going to spend $20 in this place. I was ready to leave but the drunk guy to my left offered to buy me a beer so I accepted. He didn't even mind that I was married and in no way interested in him! Is that rude? Am I taking advantage of drunk guys just looking for love? Maybe -but I can live with that. I even talked to the guy until I found my friend. Drunk as he was, we discovered that we both work in restaurants so we had something in common. I even gave him my business card so in a way - he scored a number. Anyway - I find my friend and we spent the next hour enjoying the music (I have to dedicate a star to the dj's last night. They were actually really incredible) and giggling at all the silly people around us. So, in a way, I ended up having a good time. Surprising. I still hate Madrone and will not begin frequenting the establishment, but I laughed, I danced, heard good music, and drank so it wasn't a horrible night. Lucky for them. If I had yelped Madrone after any one of the other times I've been there, I would have been a lot meaner.",

As most folks have stated, Madrone can be damn near impossible to navigate on a weekend night (or Tuesday, but we'll cover that in a bit). \u00a0HOWEVER, there is another side to this all around awesome bar/art gallery. \u00a0  I'm talking about Sunday and Monday nights. \u00a0  They really do love us. \u00a0They love us so much that every monday they set out a ton of board games. \u00a0All the classics, Connect Four, Battleship, Mousetrap and even Candyland are there for the playing. \u00a0There's a Twister set, but I'm still waiting for the day when someone shouts \"NAKED TWISTER!!!!!\" and we all go for it. \u00a0But the reason I say they love us is that if you have local ID (94115/7) you are entitled to $2 wells from the moment you walk in the door until the moment the lights come on and they ask you to leave. \u00a0Sweet. \u00a0The selection of board games needs a little tweaking (more two player classics ie: backgammon and the like) But you're always welcome to bring your own. \u00a0We had a fifteen person game of Apples to Apples there, and it was a riot (but... my friends had brought their own set. \u00a0Join us next time if you see us)  The ambiance is really nice. \u00a0Sofas, love seats and comfy chairs make it a really chill spot when it's quiet. \u00a0Hell 2-6 every day they have $2 drinks and free Internet. \u00a0Perfect for studying or meetings. \u00a0Perhaps a nice place to go when your blind lunch date works out well and you don't want to part ways??? \u00a0  Anyway, the moody lighting and dark wood features lend themselves perfectly to be a quiet place to grab a drink solo or with a friend. \u00a0WHich is EXACTLY what it is on Sunday nights. \u00a0I really enjoy my Sundays at Madrone. \u00a0I work in a cafe, and Sundays at Madrone is industry night. \u00a0All drinks are half off. \u00a0I get happier when I see that sign tham MJ when he sees the \"all boys pants half off\" sign at Sears. \u00a0Yep... All. Drinks. Half. Off. \u00a0That means a Basil Hayden's on the rocks is $4. \u00a0Infused vodka martini? \u00a0$4. \u00a0Draft beer? \u00a0$2. \u00a0Hell yeah. \u00a0AND it's nice and quiet.  There is actually a schedule of their daily specials and such on the website at the top of this page, check it out. \u00a0Something new every day with a drink special to match. \u00a0But as a person who avoids crowded scenes, I like my Sunday and Monday nights there (that's the third or fourth time I've reiterated that, so it must be true).  Weekends there is a small door charge after 9 or so. \u00a0Oh, and for some reason, Tuesday nights start out totally quiet and sometime around 11 or 11:30, you look up and FOOMP! \u00a0You're three people deep at the bar. \u00a0Go figure. \u00a0Who knows why. \u00a0Perhaps Tuesday is the new Friday.  Anyway, please stay away from Madrone on Sunday nights. \u00a0I like my quiet little cheap drink time. \u00a0  Thank you.",

Still, Madrone leaves me confused. \u00a0It could be better and it could be worse. \u00a0It was sort of at 25% capacity on the Friday night that I visited (around 8pm). \u00a0I got a Spaten for 4$. \u00a0Some reggae played in the background. \u00a0There were some interesting people milling about, and some chilling on the sofas. \u00a0The decor was loungy. \u00a0There was some indy artwork on the wall... nothing that I haven't seen before. \u00a0But I'm easy. \u00a0I find a nice corner couch and sprawled out with my beer. \u00a0  THE BOTTOM LINE? \u00a0I \u00a0think that corner (Divisader @ Fell) will remain famous for the worlds biggest price disparity between neighboring gas stations \u00a0(The Arco and the 76 are like .40 apart) - not for the fledgling bar known as Madrone. \u00a0Perhaps in time Madrone will age nicely and you will sense the character of the place when you walk in, but for now I think it still has a bit of maturing to do. \u00a0 \u00a0  Still I'd be interested to go back later at night to see if there is any debauchery going on. \u00a0  I'll give it three stars because I love that they're giving it a shot on Divis.",

There are plenty of interesting beers to choose from (certainly more than your average bar offerings), on top of a huge wine list and many spirits.   You can tell that this is very much a neighborhood bar, which can be a good or bad thing. When I got there, the bartender chatted it up with a regular/friend for about 10 minutes while I stood there waiting patiently.

The mismatched western furniture, the vintage bar housing what looks like a laboratory of infused vodkas, and the eccentric crowd make Madrone an awesome spot to start the night.",

On first glance, I wasn't sure if Madrone was the type of place I'd like to hang. But then I started noticing the political artwork. A Burberry-patterned rifle above the bar. A deer head with antlers that winded into guns. Well played, Madrone. You got me thinking deep thoughts when I was already deep into my buzz. And props for the 90s hip hop.  The cocktail list was also worthy of a look. I ordered a cucumber concoction that blew me away. It was so refreshing and the sweetness was just right, not overpowering at all. So I had three!  Our new friends gathered us up and brought us to the photobooth, where we somehow squeezed six people into a frame built for something around two. \"Everybody pose like meerkats!\" Those photos now hang on my fridge.

What'd ya expect, when you put two of the all-time best artists in the same room for a measly $5 cover? The quality of the projector set up in the back showing '80s-style imagery was really bad. And the selection of songs and the mixing weren't as good as the last P vs MJ dance-off I went to at Cafe du Nord. And I also didn't get either a P or MJ head cut-out on a stick. Didn't get any drinks since it was impossible to go to the bar. And don't get me started on the art; it was crap. But one star for the roomy bathroom.

Very mellow atmosphere, unique artwork and decor and a staff (and owner) that really care about their clientele. They treat it like a small family business where we're all a part of the family.  I've really never had a bad experience here and my only complaint would be the specially infused vodka's being pulled from the bar...

What have I been doing with my life?!\" \u00a0- Words of a wise friend after a night at Motown Mondays  Great time, good vibe, fresh drinks. I got the Lola which was yummy with good cucumber flavor but not too strong. Hilariously, my guy friend ordered the Asian Pearsuasion and the Steve McQueen and they both came out a girly pink color in a cute little martini glass...but holy smokes, they packed a punch! Be warned! The music was awesome too! Definitely miss that era, when the dancing can be so sexy WITHOUT being trashy! People need to take note!  Oh, also we first came in at 8 cuz we heard it was popping, but apparently not popping that early. No bouncer or anything, pretty empty, and plenty of room to dance. When we went out for a smoke a little later the bouncers jumped out and the line began to form around the corner. We tried to get back in but since the bouncers just came, we hadn't gotten a stamp for in/outs. When we tried to tell him, he asked us to describe the bartender (uh....sorry but there was nothing stand out about them). Luckily I had snapped a picture inside to \"prove\" we had been in, so we got a stamp and got back in instead of waiting. Just be warned though if you're going out for air because if all of a sudden the bouncer comes, its gonna be a long wait!  And remember, CA$$$H only!",

Wow is this stuff not the most interesting mixture? It's like drinking cucumber water but instead you get faded and if you don't watch yourself, you might go a little too far with it. Thats some dangerous stuff!  They also server 21st Amendment Watermelon Wheat which is another funky combo that packs a strong taste bud punch. Beer with watermelon?   Sure why not, I'm black and I love watermelon; CHECK Sure why not, I'm black and I love beer; CHECK  Its a great beer! You gotta try it.  Decor: Nice dim lit lounge with enough room for a few couch sessions with some random drunk or just enough room to grind up on someone's girlfriend on the dance floor as the DJ kicks out some tunes.

If you think along the same lines as I do, then you'll LOVE Madrone, a gem of a hangout that I'm lucky enough to live right around the corner from in NOPA.  This place is inviting, mellow, and happening all at the same time. Drink specials all night, every night, and it never costs more than 5 bucks to get in. AND there's dancing, which is always a plus for me, but if you wanna just sit and enjoy the music it's completely accessible/acceptable to chill on one of many plush, velvety upholstered couches. The beats here are a mix--on a typical night the DJ satisfies all my drop-it-like-it's-hot cravings by tastefully switching it up between old school, funk, hip hop, dancehall and salsa. They also spin a range of world music. Also, the crowd I feel accurately reflects the diverse population of San Francisco, which I appreciate--any all-Yuppie, all-Asian, or all-Hipster (etc etc) club is minus points for me. Embrace diversity!  The only drawback I can think of is that the dance floor area tends to get a little steamy since the place is pretty small... but then again, who wants to go to some converted warehouse in SOMA, overcrowded by sleazy single men trying to feel you up to Top 40 crap over and over? Plus there's a big fan in the corner that you can move so it points at you... me and my friend kept cool that way last Friday!

I'd give this place a solid 3.5 but rounded down to 3 simply because I'm not super partial to cash-only bars.  If you're in the neighborhood though, you might as well stop by Madrone for a drink.",

We decided to go to Madrone since it was down the street from him house. We bribed the doorman with a $4 bottle of wine to avert the need for a $4 cover charge EACH.   When we were in, I pretended to be a gay porn director by the name of Fredericka &amp; he was my assistant Helmut.   We ended up meeting people under this lie. Towards the end of the night, we met an incredible tall, big man who was a television executive whom we continued to lie to about making movies.   I ended up interning at Al Gore's TV station for a bit of time. The guy I met, now lives in New York buying out parts of the media.

And there is nothing worse than staring around you, moving side to side, or rather pushed side to side, so drunk pushy girls, and their bewildered boyfriends, can make their way to a non-existent dance-floor to do their wasted flailing - ie: dancing.  It's at moments like these, that I yearn to catch a bus to the Upper Haight. I crave a different bar, where I can hear myself talk, and don't have to contribute to the faint wrinkle lines emerging on my forehead, as a result of way too much eyebrow raising.  And I'm sure some of the DJs must be good, but the last time I went, they didn't even get a booty wiggle from me. They skipped from song to song, without smooth transitions. It was painful.  Three stars, because the art on the walls is pretty cool, and on a slow night - Madrone is actually a decent spot, but save yourself a trip here on the weekends.

It changes each day, but you can always expect to save a few duckets while sippin' on something ghetto fab. PBR, Budweiser tall cans, et al. They also have chalk board that's littered with tasty cocktails ranging from the usual suspects of mojitos and martinis, to the greatest drink in the entire city, the Ike Turner. It's literally a shot of Hennessey Cognac and a slap in the face. They don't fuck around either; if you order one, at some point in the evening, you're getting five fingers to the side of your cheek. It's a fantastic drink to order for an unsuspecting friend, just make sure if he tries to wallop the bartender afterward getting an open handed punch, you intervene accordingly.  It's one of those bars that I always have a fantastic time at, but you have to be in the right mood for it. Though their line-up is always spot on, it's only as good as the crowd that turns out for the evening. Make sure you take a look at their calendar of events to ensure you jive with what's going down that particular evening.",

So i advise that you put your elbows up, push, don't make eye contact, apologize to any snickering, and refrain from slipping the words \"uhmm, errr, or well, shit\" at the time of your order..you will miss your opportunity and the bartender will walk away after 5 seconds (as they should).  *have yet to but must try...the Ike Turner - - shot of Hennessy and a slap on the face. It's like the perfect pick me up during that time of the night to help jump start you with more dancin', without the crazy shit you may get from guzzling some Red Bull...   Motown Mondays is their specialty so go do a lil' dance, make a lil' love and get down tonight (on the dance floor).",

Absolutely fabulous DJ who was so into his job, he alone was entertainment. The space is small but it works, and is so funky one could simply sit and stare at the walls...oh so interesting. However, here is the problem: the security guards, two at one time, are BEHIND the bar drinking shots, and huddled together with two other bartenders, chatting it up while people stand there and wait for drinks. All of them can see us leaning on the bar with money in our hands. Then one of the security guards goes and locks himself outside, is banging on the door, we opened it for him. This much I can live with, even laugh at. But my big issue here was the fact that my guy friend was being charged $13 for two stoli sodas by the female bartender, and given seven one dollar bills in change (how presumptuous). When it was my turn, I (a lady) was charged $17 for the two same drinks! I asked what they cost and was told they were $8.50 each. Then my guy went back to buy the third round, again $13 for the two. When I brought this to this gal's attention (as I went with him to order), she didn't say anything (I definitely got her off guard), and just walked away. We told our friends to be careful, and the birthday girl, a regular said this is not uncommon for this place. So my advice, have the best looking guy in the group buy, and get there early to get a spot to sit. Fabulous theme music!",

Sonny Phono was booked with over a month's notice for our company party. We put him in touch with the venue's owner and were assured that all would be well. He agreed to reach out to the owner of the venue to see which equipment was needed -- he had a month to do so. He was then paid in full (per his request, in hindsight we should have never paid until after the event, lesson learned). On the night of the party he shows up, realizes he doesn't have ANY DJ EQUIPMENT (really? a DJ without DJ equipment?). Then he says \"ok, I'll be right back\" and then NEVER came back and NEVER called. \u00a0We have reached out via Facebook and he has deleted our comments, we have called and his phone is now disconnected. Avoid this DJ at all costs. He took our money and ran.",

    "review_text": "\" A man's character is his guardian divinity\" ..Heraclitus,pre-Socratic philosopher. \u00a0  We often form opinions about the character of a person or an establishment on the basis of our first impressions. These opinions get crystallized in our mind often leading to errors of judgement. For instance, you visit a person when he is at home with his wife and children, you might label him as a devoted husband. If \u00a0you run into the same person at a Bar hitting on women during a business trip, would'nt you change your opinion about the person's character?  I have been to Madrone a couple of times on Friday's when it is totally packed with hotties shaking their booties to the massive dj action. The drinks are good, the Bartenders friendly. Sure deserve a 5 star on the spot, I would have thought.  However,nowadays, before rating an establishment, I try to go back at least one more time and experience the place from a different perspective. So I walk into Madrone on a Tuesday evening to verify whether it really deserves the 5 star which my previous Friday night impressions had let me to believe.  There were a fair amount of regulars at the Bar. Service was reasonable and there was a dj on. Among Madrone's allure, it has supposedly a great Happy Hour. But after having to cough up $ 10 for a cocktail at 7 pm on a Tuesday, I feel Madrone has a minor character flaw and hence, misses the cut of a 5 star rating, and, for now, has to be contented with 4 stars from me.",

I really liked all the random art pieces and was immediately taken by the live band who were working the crowd. We ordered some drinks off their wall menu, which were delicious. The crowd there was very lively and were having a really good time just dancing away.   Having the dance floor set up in the front near the entrance was a bit odd for me though, especially since the bathrooms were right next to there as well. But I'd have to come back on a busy weekend night to see what it's like. Great place for a casual night out and good vibes though! I'd definitely come back here again.",

Madrone rolls them up into one thing.   The first time I went and got the cukevodka it was DELISH!!! It was dangerously delish, to be honest. After 4 I was far more into the DJ than I would have ever been in a sober state. Nonetheless, worth it.  The second time I went to Madrone I again ordered the cukevodka. Not as good this time. Tasted a bit, well, rotten. Maybe an old batch, maybe somebody started off with bad cukes. I drank it (and a few more of them) anyway.  The third time I went to Madrone I ordered the cukevodka. This time it was straight gross. Acsh, it tasted like some idiot used zucchini instead of cucumbers. It tasted EXACTLY like zucchini vodka would taste if you were dumb enough to make it.  I stopped ordering the cuke vodka. But their happy hour drink specials are pretty damn chill so I still go. I wouldn't go late night, though. It opens at 6 pm. One time I was there at 5:50. Got the best seats in the house, plus good deals. Go then. Get wasted. Go somewhere else at 10.",

As we finished our leisurely dinner I was somewhat perplexed by my friend's increasing anxiety about getting to Madrone's. \u00a0After all, we were exactly one block away and it was Monday. \u00a0How bad could it be?  Unbeknownst to me, Madrone's is apparently where ALL of San Francisco's coolness descends on Mondays because in this city it is REALLY awesome to stay up until 2am then wake up at 6am for work the next morning. \u00a0In fact, someone I met invited me to a before-work party the next day, which boggled my mind and filled me with simultaneous feelings of envy for a city with all the party one can take, and confusion as to why anyone would have to party so much. \u00a0Perhaps to keep warm.  But I digress.  The positive of freezing in a line that creeps forward roughly every eight minutes is that you become better acquainted with your acquaintances AND make friends with the people behind you. \u00a0Not the people in front of you as they are facing the wrong way. \u00a0Though I suppose we were the people in front BUT we invested the action of turning an entire 180 degrees around and therefore were able to make friends. \u00a0I'm pretty sure I have dissolved my point. \u00a0If there was one.  Once inside it was, wait for it... WORTH IT. \u00a0Worth it in a really really really crowded but fabulous way. \u00a0I also found a hook for my coat. \u00a0Finding a hook for my gigantic coat (Without out which this Hawaii girl would surely perish) made me extremely happy. \u00a0As happy as if you handed me cake for no reason at all.   People were friendly, drinks were obtainable, and I discovered if you dance vigorously enough people will make space for you. \u00a0I made an awesome new friend who dances with possibly even more gusto then I do and it was an amazing meeting of kindred spirits, two people harnessing their highest energies into skillful, jaw-dropping, performance-ready dance moves. \u00a0At least that's how it felt. \u00a0It may have looked a little bit like \"Two crazy ladies on the floor! Clear the way before their flailing takes your eye out!\", but I'm mostly sure we were glorious.  There was also a bevy of hot dudes. \u00a0But I didn't notice because I am married. \u00a0My radar completely missed all of the dimpled smiles, the chiseled jaw lines, the thin t-shirts stretched over rock hard pecs...  What.  SO. \u00a0Great Monday night, worth the wait, super fun, good good good. \u00a0One word of caution, do NOT dance near the toilets. \u00a0The toilets are one-person and absolutely disgusting. \u00a0If you accidentally venture too close you will suddenly find yourself jamming in an atmosphere of eau de fecal matter and essence of pee. \u00a0The opposite of sexy. \u00a0If you're particularly weak you may even throw up.  Yes. \u00a0Good times.",

The bar is a bit dark, but it creates a relaxing ambiance vibe. If they had low volume music I say it would feel like a speak easy feel. On a Tuesday evening however, they have a band call Steppin' which plays quite lively. It's been awhile since I heard funk and forgot how funky it sounds.

As the owner and working manager of Madrone, I would like you to know that I respond to all reviews both good and bad. I feel that is very important since this is an independently owned family business. It is also my only business and myself, my wife, and our two children are dependent upon its success. Sites like Yelp are a great source for business owners to get a feel for what does and does not work well within their business. I also feel that people who review small independent business have a duty to be fair and honest with what they write because the words they choose have a direct impact on whether or not someone might want to visit that business.   With that said, I would now like to comment on your particular review. It appears that you came once and in that short 15-minute time frame, you obviously felt very offended. For this I apologize. I would have liked to read the rant you saved the readers from. \u00a0As for the smell of the bar, perhaps you would be willing to come in the afternoon when no one is here and point it out to me. I use nothing to mask any smells, the candles are unscented, and I never light inscents. In fact my wife is a smell freak and would not allow this. We have an exterminator that comes monthly and on our last health department surprise inspection we scored a perfect score of 100.   As for the ID's: YES indeed we check Id's and vigorously. I would not and do not tolerate any underage drinking in Madrone. That would be foolish since I have invested all my family's savings into the business. Serving teenagers would shut me down, and it simply does not happen. Our customer base ranges from 21 to 88. It all depends on what time, day and event are happening. Perhaps there is another time or day that might be more your scene. My programming has everything from Live Jazz, Piano, to Hip Hop, hopefully something for everyone. If you come during the happy hour you can usually have a very chill experience.  As for the art, now here you will have to explain yourself to me in more detail. You see, I am also a fine artist, and have been for 15 plus years. I did my Undergrad at Marquette University, and spent one year in the Masters program at the San Francisco Art Institute, before I left due to the birth of my first daughter. I was also the Director of Exhibitions at Root Division in the Mission for the first five years of its existence. I have also shown in galleries locally and in New York. So my knowledge and understanding of Art is very high. I fail to believe that in your 15 minutes at Madrone you properly looked around. I feel that your comment is unfair. I also feel that had you properly looked at the entire space you could not call the \"WHOLE' Kitsch. I can see from your other reviews that you like art, and since you've been to SFMOMA you might recognize the same Walker Evans Photograph that is on display at Madrone. I can see how you would call the Pete Gronquist Antlers piece Kitsch. It could be described like that. As could his Burberry AK, and crucified Micki Mouse. I also think that Jeremiah Jenkins \"Disco Bomb.\" And even my own paintings and neon sculptures could all be described as Kitschy. So could Jeff Koons, but it's still art. And \u00a0you should look beyond the Kitsch to interpret the meaning. In Fact you should pick up the current issue of Juxtapose magazine as the Antlers piece you mentioned is featured in this months magazine on page 24.   The bar has 38 pieces of art, Museum photographs done by Dorothy Lange, John Vachon, &amp; Patricia Templeton, Contemporary Photographs by Olivier Laude, represented Wirtz Gallery, Found Photos. Contemporary Paintings, Drawings and Prints by Gallery represented artists such as Dennis McNulty, Mic Gaspay, Timorous Beasties &amp; Albert Reyes. Sculptural work by Dennis Otis Johnson, who Kenneth Baker of the Chronicle likened to Sol de Wit., and Larrissa Sand. \u00a0And also mural work by Henry Lewis and Victor Reyes.  With that said, I once again apologize that you had a bad time while visiting Madrone, but I would encourage you to come back another time and take a closer look. Ask for me, and I will buy you a drink and find you a seat free of any bad smelling people.  Cheers Michael Krouse",

The few times that I've stopped in they always seem to have good DJ's &amp; fun themes (I've been here a couple times for the Prince vs Michael Jackson nights), so because of that I'm not totally against them charging a $5 cover, which is pretty much always the case as far as I know.   That being said, at the end of the day it's just not my scene. Since it's usually packed it means the bar is crowded, which means it's hard to grab a drink. Also, I'm always reminded when I come here that this place is located in a college neighborhood and therefore it appeals to a youngish crowd (hey, I was a college kid once so I'm not knocking that at all, but now that I have a 3 in front of my age I'm well aware that there are places I just can't hang anymore). \u00a0  When I first moved to this neighborhood I DID come in here a couple times for happy hour in the middle of the week (we're talking 4+ years ago), and I did like the less crowded vibe better. Haven't done that in awhile though, so don't know what it's like now.   So yeah, if you're in your early 20's, like to dance, and don't mind crowds you'll probably like this place a lot (okay, even if you're a bit older you might still like it...I'm an old man).

I've left this place a few times because I was waiting more than 10 minutes for a drink. That's ridiculous. Get it together. It's great though when it's not packed, and they have Wi-fi and drink specials and a happy hour that goes until 9pm.",

Sometimes there's a dj (who is usually playing a mish mash of random crap), sometimes there is a band and sometimes nothing. This bar claims to feature the work of local artists and it true that there is art on the wall, but it is in no way featured prominently. To add to the mish mash there is a long (and relatively good) cocktail list and infused vodkas which seem to be on the fancy schmancy side, but also Budweiser tall boys. It should only follow that the crowd that tends to frequent this place is a mish mash of people as well. But you know what, despite my bitching about the lack of a defined scene here, when it is not too crowded it is a great place to grab a drink with a few friends.

I only had water &amp; a shot of patron, I couldnt tell you if their mixed drinks were good?  at first it was kind of annoying to stand outside, waiting.... they were doing 1 for 1 with people coming and going. but holy hell after going in and realizing how HOT it was (Michael Jackson theme, of course it was hot!) I appreciated that it wasnt ridiculously crowded - plus, there was perfect room to actually DANCE and not just do the head nod thing that you have to do in a crowded dance floor.   like the non-pretentious vibe in there and the writing on the walls.

Here, all I have to do is look up at their chalk board list and read the array of fantastic, yummy concoctions and pick one (watermelon concoction, anyone?).

The bartenders were nice- they acted sort of aloof and serious about pouring our drinks but they softened after awhile after they found out my friend was a Alabama native. There were only like 5 other people there when we went so as far as atmosphere it was kind of dead but I think we went too early, when we were leaving we saw a DJ and a bouncer ready to collect cover so maybe its better to arrive around 10pm if you want a more club-like climate. I had the pineapple infused vodka with pomegranate juice- it was very good. My friend had cucumber infused vodka with gingerale upon recommendation from the bartender- her drink was excellent as well. We both left with a nice buzz and new spot for interesting vodka drinks.

    "review_text": "When I started going out in SF this is what I expected to see everywhere. I didn't think I would get many of the traditional night clubs of Texas or as many attempts to emulate Vegas but that is essentially mostly what you run into here. Most places just don't seem to get it right which is why you have very few highly rated dance clubs in SF and it can leave a lot to be desired.   This is one of my few places that I just have to give them credit for doing what they do better than any place I have seen in SF. This place is a hipster, artsy, dance bar and they make it work to perfection.   I never thought I would say that coming from the depths of the hip hop club scene but I appreciate all music and all dancing and while I am only reviewing their Monday night I have to say they made me feel at home.   That diversity tho? None existent. This is hipster white people central. There will be a lot of fancy mustaches, PBR's, plaid shirts or good will tees. There will be skinny jeans and plenty of black rimmed glasses and tattoos but these are the kind of hiptsers I love. its entirely white with a handful of color but these hipsters GET DOWN. Seriously I have never seen this much dancing and just general not giving a fuck and lets dance as I have seen in this place.   There are the too cool for school areas further back in the back near the seating and tvs. People are actually talking back there so if you are here to dance no need to venture. Just head up to the front and dance it up.   Let me start by saying its a MONDAY night! Seriously it is packed on Monday. Sometimes i want to go out dancing on a random night and this city can make that impossible so you get four stars just for being open and having people in SF out on a work night. The second thing is that is is totally Motown. Motown on Monday's has to be one of the coolest ideas I have ever seen. I love this era of music and I love that there are people in SF who appreciate it and are willing to dance like there is no tomorrow to a mashup of the temptations or Marvin Gaye. The first time i heard a four tops song come on I freaked out and pinched myself to make sure this was real. This place was packed and people were singling along to a four tops song and dancing in a club! I am sold. Sold.   Add to that the drinks were amazing as well. There is a huge list of specialty drinks on a chalkboard above the bar and you can order cocktails until your heart is content or until you black out.   I went there to meet someone and the whole time I was wishing I didn't know anyone and just wen't there to dance and become immersed in the scene. Art, Music, and Drinks are all coming together in one place and it is a combination that works so well.   Yes it will get crowded but never too crazy and people go home pretty early because it is a work night but I recommend sticking it out and partying with the locals. The crowds are attractive and everyone is mingling and smiling which can make a club worth it in itself. The line can be a little much and there is nothing else really in this area besides this place a few smaller stores. Also it is a bar by trade so the dancing can get out of hand and spill into the bar crowd which can lead to some awkward interactions but who cares you are here to dance on a Monday night and that's exactly what you should do.   A night focused on Motown earns five stars from me no matter what. A Monday night location pretty much seals the deal. i don't know what this place is like on a Friday or Saturday and would likely never venture over this far to see on one of those prime nights but for a weekday spot this place has everything. I never thought I would have written this before I stepped foot in this great little hidden locale.",

The music was a mix of DJ's, (Hi Alex!) and live bands, who were playing hip hop and some funkier, soulier stuff, which was easy and fun to dance to. The drinks were averagely priced, too ($5 for a well, which is just fine with me.) My only complaint, (and it's such a tiny one,) is that the dance floor is also not a dance floor, so you get that awkward combination of people trying to dance next to people trying to talk. However, as the night progressed, most of the talkers migrated towards the door-end of the space.  Looking at their calendar, it seems like offerings at Madrone vary a lot. I'd check out the calendar before heading down, to know what you're getting into. The neighborhood games and slideshows on Mondays sound fun, and Happy Hours until 9pm? All in all, I like this place.

But due to last minute changes, my friends and I missed the show Friday night with Incubus and Pear Jam *sigh* but I digress. Luckily we had a Plan B that my friend checked out ahead of time.  The event they had last Friday night was \"I Heart the 90's: SF's Original 90s Dance Party.\" I was sold with just that! I can't remember what time we got here but we had to pay a $5 cover, eh not bad at all. The bar was so randomly decorated with a Burberry printed AK-47 rifle and gold-plated Mickey Mouse on a crucifix (I have a pic but haven't uploaded it yet).   I noticed their chalkboard drink menu to the right had a bunch of infused vodkas. In total I ordered three different drinks with the infused vodkas but only really liked one of them. I'm pretty lightweight when it comes to drinking so I expected the three drinks to do me in, but nope I was completely sober. The bartenders weren't really generous when it comes to pouring drinks.  But besides the drinks the DJs were awesome! I was groovin' to the '90s jams for a couple hours straight! They played everything from Boyz II Men, Salt-N-Peppa, MC Hammer to House of Pain. It was such a treat to hear Informer by Snow and Paperboy's Ditty. Ahhh the 90's were a great decade, why can't they make music like that anymore?? Another bonus was having projectors up \u00a0where they showed some of the music videos, my attempt at recreating the dance moves wasn't very pretty =P   One thing I do have to complain about was that it was too damn HOT! We got in to SF earlier that day and somehow they just got a random heatwave that didn't leave until late at night. So it was interesting dancing next to all these sweaty bodies since there was no air conditioning. Although they did have ceiling fans that helped to cool you down if you found just the right spot on the dance floor.  Overall I had a great time and wouldn't mind coming back here on my next visit =)",

Check them out on Friday nights. \u00a0You like Funk, head there on Tuesdays. \u00a0They have Prince and MJ cuts on Saturday nights on some weekends. \u00a0They even have live bands that play on select nights and this guy that rocks out on the piano from 6 - 9 on some days. \u00a0  The Bar has good beer and unique mixed drinks. \u00a0They change the art on the walls every so often. \u00a0This is my default bar to hit up during the week.",

    "review_text": "So this is a popular ass place. The first time I walked in here on a quiet night I enjoyed the atmosphere, interesting art and loud music. There's a whole wall covered in chalk cocktails pretty much all 10$ a pop and organized by liquor types. I recommend \"the Luchadores\" it's a super strong yummy tequila drink that is nice and spicy and comes with a dried chili pepper in it. One of these guys makes the 10$ worth it. This place has all the unique hooks one could want. Crazy sculpture, old cash registers, buy someone a drink lists, regular's drink tally's, old tv's that just play static but have images painted over them and weird music nites from DJs to jazz bands and of course the run down bathrooms covered in graffiti. In a way there's something here for everyone which in part is why I never come here, because it is sometimes too busy to handle. On nites with dancing the heat and sweat of the room can be unbearable, but in the early afternoon or rather any day before 6pm it's a fucking awesome mellow place, where the bartenders are kickass and friendly and play w/e music they want and you can chat them up or hang out with your friends. There's a cool booth at the very back of the place that you can group up on but at nite is often times reserved for someone who paid to rent it out for the nite. Which if you're in their position is pretty fucking sweet.   The owner has this fucking huge dog, like seriously I'm talking almost 6 ft long. It's this giant mastiff and you can often see the bartenders walking it around the neighborhood. I think the dog's name is Spike. he's such a sweet dog to boot.  Overall it's a not a giant space that is quite often packed to the teeth. I was surprised how busy it gets the 2nd and 3rd times I went back. On party nights expect a line around the building with a bouncer letting people in for every few out. This place is cash only so don't forget to stop at the ATM in the front. There's also tons of free postcards and ads and newspapers for art events and other cool shit in SF. The bar usually has free fortune cookies and there's pitchers of water on the far end for people. The more I describe this place the more I'm like they pretty much have everything right. Their cocktail list is pretty huge, and on top of it they've got a good beer selection, plus the cheap shit as well.   My only complaint about this place is that it's too popular to go to on the weekends, but nothing beats Madron on an afternoon.",

    "review_text": "I've been coming ever since this place opened and I love it. I was surprised to find that I had not yet reviewed it. The time has come!  The space: I love the funky chairs and couches that they have all over the place. They are cozy and stylish at the same time. The seating to the right when you walk in is perfect for an intimate cocktail with one other person but also lends itself well to group mixing. I've gotten into some great conversations with people sitting there. The dancefloor in the back can be a little bit cramped but I don't mind because it adds a sense of closeness that reminds me of the old Liquid on 16th. If you can cozy up to the bar, notice the beautiful wood work behind the bar - freaking gorgeous. Another great thing about the space itself is the constantly shifting artwork. Sometime good, sometimes bad, but always interesting enough to spur a conversation about it.  The music: The music here is super super diverse. I have danced to house, bands, experimental hip hop, salsa, dancehall, Prince vs M Jackson...and hyphy. Yes....hyphy. Not musically oriented but still fun is \u00a0the board game night. Pick from a pile of board games and get hyphy with your friends. SOOOOO much fun.  The people: This place fools me every time. As a testament to the differing musics that they play, the crowd can be just as diverse. You can find a thuggish element, a Marina element and a local element all in the same space...on the same night. It's a unique combination and a temple to the diversity of the place. I love it.  The drinks: They have an awesome array of drinks. My favorites being the Canopy (an horchata cocktail) and the Rock Star (ginger beer with LOTS of Gosslings Rum). However, lately I've been going for the $3 draft Stella's - can't beat that.  All in all this is a great place to come and get a drink on a slow night with friends or with a group on a busy night where your swapping sweat with the person next to you. It's equally suitable for a thug - a yuppie - a hipster - and every type of scene in between. You can't say that about a lot of places and that's why I think Madrone ROCKS!",

Don't bother driving there, it'll take you FOR-EV-ER to find parking, plus last time I checked, it's not the greatest plan to drive to a bar..gettin home becomes an issue.   The drinks were decent, and woo woo can't beat $2 tall Budweisers (i feel ghetto saying that). Hey, it's cheap and gets you where you need to be. The bartenders were decent, and got to you when they could.   It's great that they play movies on the wall in the back, except you don't hear it...so if you're coming to watch the movie, good luck with that. The always have different art exhibits up, so I always enjoy that.   If you get there early, you will avoid the cover charge that no one wants to pay! The djs \u00a0arrived around 10ish, and \u00a0I wouldn't say spectacular music, but it was decent. I danced, did the robo boogey that sort of thing. :) \u00a0  I'm glad the DYL was held here.

Otherwise, this place rules. The entire wall is criss-crossed with painters' tape, creating a rad design highlighted by a mounted deer head. Our bartender was absolutely hilarious - wouldn't be surprised if he did some standup on off nights.  And the drinks are otherworldly. In our group of friends, we sampled the Spanish Harlem (Angustora 7 years rum, Carpano Antica, Angustora orange bitters, &amp; a cherry), an incredible mix of lavender gin, honey, cava &amp; lemon, as well as the potent Luchadore (Mezcal Vida, Tuaca, lime, jalapeno agave, cayenne salt)  I opted for the Herbie Hancock, a gloriously refreshing libation made up of fresh watermelon, Russian standard vodka, lime, simple syrup, and guava juice.  As we were just there for happy hour, I couldn't really distinguish what the 'scene' here really is - but it seems pretty hoppin in the artist community.",

Also, mojitos have lime in them, which is why you have a squeezer right on the bar!). I note that Tuesday is highly rated as the best night, which happens to be the night I ran into the good bartender.  Some or many of the bars in the city have a meat market feel to them, where you feel that almost everyone in the bar in there trying to get picked up or vice versa. This is not one of those places. It has more of a cafe with booze type atmosphere, though the above may not apply on a weekend.  Bottom line? Good place to go if you are local and want to hang.

And while we are talking about what I want: I also want space. \u00a0Especially since this uberpop mashup of the century (read: week) is the best dance music ever!!11 \u00a0God, Madrone couldn't have been more crowded. \u00a0Stop letting people in. \u00a0It was 10PM and all of 50 people filled the place to the brim. \u00a0You couldn't move. \u00a0You couldn't get a drink. \u00a0You couldn't even begin to think about dancing -- the thought would take up too much space and some girl would shoot you a nasty look and 'mindlessly' box you out. \u00a0That's what I hate: when a place packs them in to the point that generally nice people turn into catty space-mongers. \u00a0\"It isn't their fault,\" I kept telling myself, \"it is Madrone's fault.\" \u00a0Then I hip-checked the bitch to the beat of 'Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\"  OK, one last gripe, since I feel like being an asshole: \u00a0I don't usually care to give my opinion on DJs. \u00a0I wouldn't know what to do if you put me up there, so I normally go easy. \u00a0I'll comment on the TYPE of music they are playing, but that's about it. \u00a0Well, not this time. \u00a0What the hell was going on with the music? \u00a0It seriously seemed as though someone had plugged in their iPod to the sound system -- better yet, my iPod shuffle -- and was just fumbling through some Prince &amp; MJ songs. \u00a0Transitions were confusing enough to make you stop (luckily you hadn't really been dancing anyway, given the aforementioned space issue) and then there were strange interludes of 10 minute video clips from a Hall of Fame induction.  All in all, I could see enjoying myself here if there were 15 people in the place. \u00a0Good deal on my shot &amp; beer -- and it looked like my old living room. \u00a0But my group and I were hoping enough people would leave so that it would be tolerable, but we simply ended up being the ones with the lower threshold. \u00a0Maybe it was great after we left and freed up 5 sq feet.",

I saw the PVM pictures here on Yelp and the place looked like a cool place to dance to some more-retro-than-your-average-club music. Well, I also thought Madrone was bigger than it actually is. The place is half-club, half-lounge, but luckily I went on an off-night, so it wasn't that packed--still crowded but there was enough room to dance. I was somewhat disappointed by the music that night--it was all trancey dance music. It would have been nice to hear some rock.  I'd like to come back again--the people here are pretty cool and low-key. You can just come in a tee and jeans and fit right in. $5 is kind of ridiculous given that it seems to be more lounge/bar than dance club, but all in all, I like the feel of Madrone.  UPDATE: I don't get out enough, so I can't say this for certain, but this must be one of the only places that plays MOTOWN! Sure, when you're there for 3 hours like I was, you're bound to hear the same songs played again and again; but still, the best part is the mellow, old-school groove in which the music puts you. Bad part about it is that it is so crowded by the end of the night! There must have been sufficient fans though because I don't remember getting all hot and sweaty as I usually get in packed clubs/bars.",

We went on a Friday night which was mainly hiphop. There was a live band there playing music that was a cross of meth &amp; red, jurasic 5 and cuts coming from that era. When they weren't performing, the dj spun dope old school hip hop.  Good drinks. I've never had a gingerbeer/rum cocktail before, which is one of their specialty cocktails. It tasted like cocacola :) The bartender also made some yummy shots for us because we were celebrating someone's birthday.  Good space. There's lots of couches and seats for people to sit at if they don't feel like dancing. It wasn't too crowded. There's also artwork for sale on the walls. I was drawn to this photo someone took while they were on muni. Too bad it wasn't in my price range.  Recommended if you're looking for an artsy hip hop lounge without the pretentiousness.",

I've only had one experience thus far, but I enjoyed it. \u00a0Though I don't want a huge crowd to show, so maybe everyone should ignore my post and go with the \"it's lame\" train of thought...",

The ambiance of the bar was a smooth/cool vibe. This is a place to be seen. The lighting is bright at the bar so you can actually see what they have to offer (unlike the darkly lit places where you basically need to bring your own flashlight), and they have it all fully stocked! The bartender was sweet and he made our drinks strong and rather quick! We ordered whisky-gingers and let me tell you, I like a bartender that can mix so well you can barely feel the bite of the hard stuff. Yum!

Oh right, it's in the back, so you have to push through a thousand people dancing and sweating on you before you can order a drink.   Got your drink? Great, let's dance. The DJs are usually playing a good set, and dancing's fun as long as you don't mind the long line of people waiting for the bathroom cutting into the dance floor. Did I forget to mention the waiting area for the bathroom and the dance floor are one in the same, because honestly, why wouldn't they be? \u00a0  The best part is when you're waiting in line for the bathrooms with your girlfriends, and guys take this wonderful opportunity to hit on you while still dancing, because nothing says romance forever like the combination of full bladders and awkward dance moves.",

There are tons of regulars at the PvM (I believe it was renamed Prince and Michael after Michael Jackson's death in 2009) events and the staff likes to invent creative artist-inspired drinks to celebrate Prince and MJ. \u00a0I remember being served a drink with a single white (latex) glove once in honor of MJ. \u00a0The art displayed in the place rotates and is consistently creative and certainly adds character to the venue. \u00a0If you arrive early enough, you can grab a laser printer print-out of Prince or MJ's face glued to a popsicle stick. \u00a0Many people dress up as Prince or Michael, but it is not required. \u00a0Once you get inside, there are music videos and live performances projected onto the walls of Prince, MJ, Jackson 5, and Janet Jackson performances. \u00a0If you're anything like me, you will know every song that comes on. \u00a0The DJs will mute out music to make sure you're singing along from time to time (You may find yourself enthusiastically screaming \"HEAD!!\" from the Prince song around bunch of people who are unfamiliar with the lyrics when the DJ mutes the music). \u00a0Sometimes the DJs will put on some freakishly realistic masks.  My only complaint is this event started to get super popular and I found myself getting more and more smooshed by the excessive crowds inside enjoying the music and zany Prince and Michael Jackson fans. \u00a0Between that and the excessively difficult parking situation, I rarely come here anymore, but PvM will always hold a special place in my heart. \u00a0:)",

The only downside and the reason for not getting a 5 star is that it was incredibly crowded - which isn't in itself a reason not to go, but yes, a little claustrophobic and hot when dancing. I don't mind a crowded dance floor at all, but the whole damn space is crowded (ordering drinks, only one bathroom, not too much seating). \u00a0 This is definitely not the spacious Mega One Named Dance Club (Poison? Sin? Beats? Ozone? Zen? etc.) you're used to downtown. \u00a0Not much the bar can do about the narrowness of the size, although I'm glad they had both front and back doors so if I'm there when the Big One hits at least I won't be trampled. \u00a0Just a word to the wise for those who care about those things. \u00a0 However, that's a First World Problem to have - and that the place was packed is an indication that people (at least these smart folks) know a good thing when they see it. \u00a0Still worth a visit for a great SF experience.",

Apparently it was someone's art opening and free wine was flowing. A lot of it. We walked in to find my husband lounging on one of the couches, gazing dreamily at the bird art around him and sporting a great big purple smile. He'd been there for hours, alone- well, just him and the birds.   Other occasions haven't been as memorable. The other night we went to hear a DJ we like and the sound was awful and waaay too quiet. It's kind of hard to dance when you can't hear the music. Plus it was completely packed so dancing wasn't going to happen anyway.   But, I like this place a lot overall. Couches are comfy, the people are good, and the drinks are decent.",

The crowd is always hip and fun and there is always dancing to be had if you just get up there and shake it. Its also a great spot to chill with comfortable couches and chairs to hang out in.

It's constantly changing due to promotion of local artists paintings, poems, etc. It's a little dirty but that's all a part of its grungey charm. The bathroom is the kind you hover in, ladies, if yaknowwhatImean. The parking is mostly street too with like 1 small lot across the way you pay for.  I have also been here on 90's night and the DJ is FRESH! It's a little less crowded, def. a cool eclectic crowd full of hipsters &amp; hiphop heads alike. I def. prefer it.

I was excited to try a cocktail-- all the drinks on the menu look great. I ordered something ridiculous, and the bartender rolled his eyes and told me I didn't want that.

Then we found out the name, and it's one of my favorite California native species, then, I went there and had a good time. - they re-made my drink because I didn't like it. they didn't have to! They did! I appreciated it, since I ordered poorly! - people were friendly. Someone asked about my silly shirt, another guy talked to me about how awful photography is as an art form (he was high). - that inexplicable vibe that says: feng shui. it's got the chi flowing, a lot of it - the seating space is available, but not everywhere, but occasionally. Hard to explain: I felt like I coudl stand and chat with people, or sit down and chat, and I didn't feel like it was either way predominantly. good design. - the tree is cool - it's in a nice neighborhood, near place I usually am going (Independent, i.e.)",

My friends and I patroned Madrone every Thursday night for about 3 months straight. It was something out of a dream...infused vodkas from every color of the rainbow, art nouveau-esque fixtures, gorgeous re-upholstered antique sofas, bathrooms referrred to as \"Water Closets\", and PLENTY of SEMI-SOFT porn-like projections behind the DJ. Yes, life was good!! Of course, my heaven only lasted so long. Madrone started charging a cover &amp; the staff became a bit bitter. Worst part is.... someone complained about the visuals being too graphic!! After that, a dark cloud covered Madrone. Angels, fairies, unicorns- all fled ( i think they missed the projections too). It's not the party it used to be, but Madrone has maintained its lounge quality housing great art. Conveniently, if you're in the hood, you can easily skip out early and watch projections in the privacy of your home \u00a0:)",

If you come here after 10, it gets super crowded and you have to pay a cover...it's only $5 but still it's a small price to pay if you want to experience what it's like to be a sardine and I'm not talking about a new dance craze.  We headed here for Halloween because it was one of the best bargains in town complete with good indie music. One of the reasons I go to these kinds of places is not for the drinks - it's for the music. Call me a music snob but music is what draws me here plain and simple. Fringe played a good mix of popular hits like the Ting Tings to more obscure dance tunes like The Presets which I appreciated. There were so many good costumes I couldn't tell you who would've won the iPod touch. We left just when they started it because sadly Daniel the King of the Hipsters and Buttercup of the Powerpuff Girls had some fierce competition. My only complaint - our lame friends who all flaked out at the last minute. Oh well, we still managed to have fun and socialize with a scary baby, a dominatrix and some other interesting characters of the night. We managed to get a goodie bag of other spooky treats and toys. Overall, an evening well spent.  I'm glad they finally found a better place for the fan...because it gets really hot in there. Hooray for little artsy bars.",

They have extremely reasonable drink specials: $2 tallboys of Budweiser, $3 wells, $4 infused vodka drinks...  It's the perfect combination of a bar with a little dance floor if you are so inclined to get your groove on. It definitely fills a unique niche in the neighborhood. The infused vodkas are exceptionally tasty and innovative; the \"Lola\" is refreshing and not too sweet (cucumber vodka, ginger beer, and soda).   Since Madrdone isn't a huge spot, I prefer it during happy hour time or on quieter nights. On Mondays, they have a great selection of board games, so you can play scrabble while sipping your Bambootini.  The music is always fun and groovy, and the antique-style couches give the bar a hip bohemian vibe.",

The scene was as described below: lots of dancing, $5 cover, good drinks. The music was great. I particularly loved the cocktail menu on the wall (\"For Whom the Booze Tolls\"), although it's tough to enjoy a good craft cocktail while dancing the night away.  The reason this place gets an outstanding review from me is what happened *after* we left. The next morning I realized I'd lost my beloved (read: expensive) sunglasses from the previous night. After frantically trying to track them down (and remember the night before) it turns out someone had turned them in at the bar, and the staff there held onto them until I could come and pick them up. An honest wait staff - to me - is worth their weight in gold. Even better: when we came back on that quiet Sunday afternoon, we were able to appreciate all the cool art projects that we'd overlooked the night before.  We'll be back (next time... sans sunglasses.)",

From the outside it looks like a house... but in my drunken state I did not hesitate! (I'm a poet)  I was given a long island, but I couldn't tell you if it was any good because it ended up on the ground.. party foul on my part. (But remember, it was my birthday)  So my ladies and I interrupted a skater video party with our strong desire to dance party. Seriously the DJ was playing videos of skater tricks, and all we wanted to do was dance. In our inebriated state we all moved to the front and started dancing, while skater dudes galore scowled. I would think 10 hot women shaking their things would be more entertaining than an ollie but apparently here a piece of wood and 4 wheels is better than some hot legs.  Of course that did not stop us ladies... eventually we dispersed and the only thing memorable about this bar was the skater party \u00a0we always joke about crashing.",

Totally doesn't matter if you think you can dance or don't think you can dance as long as you're moving in whatever motion suits your fancy you'll have a good time and no one will care (and even if you want to socialize at the bar or on the outskirts without dancing, you're good to go there too).   They were speedy on requests. Played lots of danceable favorites, some well-known pop of the day, but not too much and most people kept to their groups or mingled, danced, and socialized with others. Very cool atmosphere and a lack of people dancing all over you like at other clubs, which was appreciated. Had a fun time, will go back with others every once in awhile in the future.

Cuz guess what, you're a small bar in NOPA that, because you installed one of those lame projection screens, bought some swanky furniture, and placed a velvet rope outside, thinks it can charge covers on weeknights and allow your bartenders to have pretentious attitudes. So basically I'll only go here when forced, but I'll give credit where credit's due and give props for the Budweiser tall boys! But that's all the praise this bar will get.",

    "review_text": "Mickey Mouse on the cross. Underneath a Burberry-clad automatic rifle. This is what you get to see when you sit down at the lovely piece of wood that is the Madrone Art Lounge bar. It's a long bar and it's a long, long list of drinks on the chalkboard wall beside it. This place has a wall of booze thirty feet long and three racks high. One night I stumbled in here to find Truner Pils for a dollar a pint. I lived the dream that day.   Each night brings a different type of patron. They have a jazz jam session on Sunday nights that features some of the best players in the city. We're talking Jazz Mafia. Look it up. Thursday is salsa night, with lessons at 9 pm. Great for the se\u00f1ors and the se\u00f1oritas. Steppin', a hot jazz-funk soul odyssey, plays every Tuesday without fail. Come meet band leader Oscar Meyers. That's right. Everyone's in love with him. The disco bomb is a mirror-encrusted Vietnam-era US Air Force 100-lb bomb. Shiny disco bomb. Very cool cylindrical lights hang above the bar. Spike is the kind of owner who has friends who are happy to make him very cool cylindrical lights; the kind of guy who covers a bomb in mirrors then hang it like the sword of Damocles over the dance floor. A cool owner makes for a cool bar, a cool bar makes for cool times, and cool times make for cool people. Spike is cool people. And the circle turns. I almost forgot about the art. In addition to the Burberry number above the bar, Madrone is always exhibiting art by mostly-local, always-excellent artists - like the shiny golden deer head with AKs for antlers. An entire wall of the bar is covered with graffiti art, and a self-portrait of the owner always holds down the left end of the bar. Like great bars? Come to Madrone. Like great people? Cone to Madrone. Like great sex? Cone to my house. At the end of the day, I love this bar and so, I hope, will you.",

    "review_text": "Event: Baby cousin's 22nd Birthday  I went here with 8 of my cousins after eating at YakiniQ BBQ for dinner. \u00a0Not a good idea: \u00a0a giant group of people dancing in a circle in a crowded bar + a hot summer night = I felt like we were a walking tub of bulgogi potpourri. \u00a0Super sexy.  - \u00a0Things that stood out: a large bin filled with yummy fortune cookies (individually packaged) by the entrance, a photobooth, a gold plated Mickey Mouse attached to a crucifix with two gold chains around his neck, a Burberry shotgun mounted above the bar, Antlers with machine guns, a giant pine tree car freshener hanging from the ceiling.  - \u00a0I also want to point out that there was an actual working breathalyzer machine right by the exit complete with business cards for different taxi cab services in case you fail the test. \u00a0I've actually never seen that before so I was highly amused.  Sidenote: \u00a0I've never really seen my baby sister drunk in a bar before. \u00a0Tonight was a first. \u00a0Sure I've seen her drink a tad here and there in Napa with the family or during Thanksgiving dinner, but never in an actual bar and never to the point where she's dancing like a not so innocent baby sister. \u00a0It was almost like the time when I was nine years old and I found out that all of the characters in Disneyland that signed my autograph book were just teenagers getting paid minimum wage dressed in costumes. \u00a0You don't understand, my world was turned upside down. \u00a0Granted she's a fresh batch of good ole' 21, I still think of her as a child. \u00a0God, I'm getting old.  - \u00a0The music was fantastic for a chill weekday night. \u00a0Old school memory lane music. \u00a0A little bit of Lucy Pearl mixed in with some Missy Elliot and Snoop Dog (or is it Snoop Lion now?) with a dash of Hi-Five's, \"I Like the Way (The Kissing Game) and T.W.D.Y.'s, \"Player's Holiday\". \u00a0Happy Music.  - \u00a0The crowd was very diverse. \u00a0Also, I was surprise how packed the place was especially for a Wednesday night. \u00a0  - \u00a0They have a nice selection of alcohol and it was not hard to miss the extensive mixed drink menu since it was clearly written in colorful chalk by the bar.  +4, I'll be back soon.  Something that I will never forget from tonight's experience: Being the responsible D.D. and hearing my baby sister give me a ridiculously drunken, somewhat distorted speech during the ride back about \"living life to the fullest\" that reminded me of Theon Grayjoy's YOLO speech (Games of Thrones reference, sorry guys) except rather than getting knocked on the head mid-speech, she started to drunk cry herself to sleep. \u00a0Priceless.",

Swayzee and DJ 4AM started the night off spinning a wide assortment of music ranging from the local hyphy stuff to hip hop to mashups. \u00a0They got me hyped up. And when Emynd and Bo did their thing, I was very impressed and enjoyed myself much (all this was with Aqua Teen playing in the background). Anyhow, the bar is pretty small. It is more of a around the corner bar that a lot of cities have. They had my beer of choice, Newcastle, which is a plus in my book. They also sell tall boys as well, which I think looks gangsta when u see a lady chugging them down. \u00a0Anyhow, the decor is nice with art by local artists on sale, and suprisingly, since it got a bit packed, I didn't have to wait a while to order a drink. The people who frequent this place seem like the typical hipsters that frequent SF, so that can be a good or bad thing depending on your opinions. Plus, if that night I went there was any indication of what the crowd looks like, then I would just go there just to meet a pretty lady or two. I would go here again if I didn't have to find parking 10 blocks away, but that would mean I would have to live in SF, which unfortunately isn't going to be anytime soon.",

I can however say that this is a decent spot for happy hour. The decor is a little funky but warm and inviting.   They use plain black handles on the beer taps and as far as I could tell the beers available aren't listed anywhere. That would be fine if I felt comfortable asking the bartender to go through the choices but the acoustics aren't good and the bartender was busy.   When I first showed up I went up for a beer and the bartender was busy. I saw him grab a flashlight, look at the bottles of wine under the cash register, choose one, open it, grab a wine glass, wipe it out with a napkin, pour the wine, and finally serve it. While I do appreciate attention to detail that is way too many steps if you are the only bartender in a crowded bar. I suggest they open a few bottles of wine and polish the wine glasses before they open.",

Madrone is a pretty well appointed space and I didn't find it to be quite so small as everybody else seems, but it's definitely not huge.   Some of the drinks were quite moderately priced, so I suppose that is a plus. The specialty at the bar are their infused vodkas, which my friends partook of and enjoyed. I ordered an Anchor Steam but ended up with a Prohibition after one of the two people behind the bar informed me that Anchor Steam was off. No biggie.  The real big problem is that there was only one bartender there for a rapidly crowding bar full of thirsty people. The bartender did the best she could, and we got pretty lucky scoring drinks right away, but there was such a backlog of people waiting to order that it was a real problem.   The other guy behind the counter did serve me up my beer, and he collected glasses and stuff, but he seemed more interested in talking on the phone and eating a burrito. It was pretty bizarre, because there he was standing facing the crush of people waiting to be served a drink and he is back there casually munching on his dinner. Odd.  We ended up moving on rather than wait 15 minutes for another round. Didn't seem like a big loss.",

    "review_text": "I'm giving this place 4 stars for when there ISN'T something going on.  I haven't experienced the \"club\" aspect of Madrone, but I urge the intimidated to go on inside in the evening sometime. \u00a0It's a nice place to go for a drink to chat with your friends, unwind, or gear up for the night ahead. \u00a0They have these old Victorian couches that \"absorb your body while the alcohol absorbs your blues\" (tm) \u00a0The pours aren't super stiff, but I didn't find they were super weak either. \u00a0However, I usually just go with a glass of shitty wine or a cheap beer anyway. \u00a0The price is right here, especially during their generous happy hour:  Happy Hour Specials...(4-9pm every day) $1 off Drafts $2 PBR'S $3 well drinks $4 Mojitos and Infused Vodkas  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for Madrone, but being nearby I'd say it's probably one of my favorite bars in the neighborhood, especially when I just feel like getting out of the house but not necessarily partying in the rip-roaring drunk, waking up in the morning hanging from a tree by my panty elastic kind of way.  Oh, but my friend went to one of the club nights and ended up hooking up with a coworker. \u00a0So there you go, I guess, four stars all around. \u00a0Cuz that shit is hot (read: HILARIOUS.)",

    "review_text": "After reading Michael P's review of Madrone, I was determined to go over here at some point to check it out for myself. After an evening that began at Zebulon went a bit sour, Madrone was posited as a suggestion, and I was more than happy to go along with it.  That late in the evening, parking off of Divis/Fell was not a problem. They charge a $5 cover at the door, and the place looks to be divided into a lounge section by the far wall facing the bar, a dance area opposite the bar, and a projector playing movies on the side. Pretty dark in there, but candlelit. The crowd was a pretty good size, the seating was comfortable (kitschy couches, wooden box trunks for tables), and the restrooms were clean enough. I can't say whether or not they took plastic since another friend bought the drinks. Seemed like a happening place, with an easygoing crowd. Music was pretty energetic also.  I'd go back here. I can't give it four stars because I didn't experience enough of it - finding myself deep in conversation for the most part and losing the retaining pin to my watch. I'll have to go back again to get the full Madrone experience, so consider this three-star review a note to myself to go back and improve on the experience by interacting more with my surroundings.",

    "review_text": "Went here last Friday with some besties. We pretty much just had a weird time. Not bad, not good. When you're out with your friends trying to get crazy and laugh way too hard and create a bunch of inside jokes, a mediocre time won't cut it. So we weren't here too long.  Here's the rundown. We get there, pay the $5 cover and squeeze our way through the crowd. Literally a shoulder-to-shoulder mass of people. We reach the bar in the back and commence ordering (didn't have to wait too long, that was nice). I tried to get the watermelon vodka drink they have on their wall but they were out of watermelon vodka. So I got one of the other vodka drinks, can't remember the name but it had orange and lime. \"This tastes like a Flintstones push-up pop!\" my friend said upon sipping. He was right and this was not a bad thing.  Things got weird when we sat down.   \"Are you sitting on my jacket?\" -random incredibly tall guy \"Uh...no.\" -Me \"You're sitting on my jacket.\" -Mr. Random *standing up* \"I'm not sitting on anything.\" -Me He proceeds to scream at his friends right next to me about losing his jacket. I look away awkwardly.  -5 minutes later-  \"Is my jacket behind you?\" -Hipster girl \"No, there's nothing here.\" -Me \"Where's my jacket?!\" -Ms. Hipster *sighing* \"I wish I could help you. Alas.\" -Me She questions my companions about whether her jacket is cozied up with their booties. She leaves, upset.  After these pleasant exchanges I looked around at the club: the girl two seats down giving her chair a lap dance, the couple right in front of me groping the night away, the gangster rap pounding away at my head.   We went back to my friend's apartment and watched his DVD of The Beyonce Experience. It was a better time. :P  Honestly I think it was just an off night. My friend said the music if normally way better. Give it a try, hopefully you won't find yourself involved in some crazy jacket thief ring.",

    "review_text": "Now I've done it. I've raised the bar so high that the pressure to write another poignant and hilarious review is nearly insurmountable. I can't take it so I will write a mediocre review. Not about a mediocre place but a mediocre review.  My take on this place is from a unique perspective and you will probably not have the same experience as I did. I've heard of the rude bartenders and pretentious atmosphere. Impossible I say. I had the bartender's full attention. That's because I was the only one in the place. Some guy named Bob or Bill was there for a few minutes but then he left and I was sitting there by myself at 6PM while my friend Andy bartended.  It smelled like fresh cut flowers and I felt like I was in an 1800's old west train car. There was cool art on the walls and Snow White was playing on the wall. I am not much of a mixed drink drinker but Andy convinced me to try some infused vodka. I had the cucumber vodka and the ginger vodka. The cucumber tasted cool and smooth. I almost felt like I had two slices on my eyes and I was relaxing in a spa... almost. The ginger vodka seemed like it would be better reduced and served over ice cream. If you like ginger and you like vodka then you might like this one. There were others like dried apricot*, berry, espresso*, and pear. I had none of them so you're on your own there.  I also had \u00a0couple of Death &amp; Taxes beers but I didn't order any food. They don't make it there, they order it from somewhere else so I think the bartenders enjoy placing the food orders as much as they enjoy making mojitos. They don't.  So during the day (before 7PM) is when no one is there. If you go after that then you may have to deal with the rude bartenders or the wannabe hip-hop crowd. I can't speak to that. Otherwise I thought it was a cool place.  *New flavors tasted. I went back and tried a couple more. The espresso infused is probably better left to mixing in other drinks which is what they actually do. By itself it has all the bitterness of espresso and all the alcoholiness of vodka. Curiosity satisfied. The dried apricot...hmmm. Why dried? I don't know. It still had an edge. Maybe I was expecting more of a liqueur flavor. I could have gotten the same flavor from chewing on some dried apricots and washing it down with some vodka. Curiosity satisfied.",

And they had a projector screen with peeps tagging too. Always wondered how they tagged on freeway over passes and now I know because of the project screen on this club showed some tight ass tagging. They really know how to mix drinks though especially those girl bartenders dressed in black. It was well worth it. Yeah. Woooooooooooo. Too crowded though to dance though and there was a line. Nice hip-hop music they played though. Two thumbs up!!!!! It's too damn crowded though (at least for tonight) to dance so I was just chillin' at the bar with my friend.  Edit: Well I have to add something now that I'm sober. They have couches at the entrance of the club so it's sort of like a lounge too. I thought it was nice that they had glasses and pitchers of water available on the bar counter top. Heh At least they're looking out for their patrons while getting them drunk.",

    "review_text": "This fine establishment has a Prince v. Michael Jackson dance party once an effing month. \u00a0That is my shit. \u00a0The first time I attended said party I didn't expect such a crowd. \u00a0It was dangerous--like call the fire marshal dangerous. \u00a0But you do what you gotta to represent your favorite on the dance floor. \u00a0I will continue coming, no matter how crowded. \u00a0The trick I've discovered--and don't tell anyone this--is to rock out in front of the djs. \u00a0There's more fresh air there then in some chick's aqua net ridden hair riding up in your face, and there's a fan that you can nonchalantly point your direction. \u00a0And when those bitches get pissed that you pointed it away from them, just do it again and they'll leave you alone.  Prince v. Michael is like church. \u00a0The greatest thing is the respectfulness of the competition. \u00a0Folks that are all about the Prince aren't hating on my Michael fan-dom. \u00a0They just only sing along with the big hits. \u00a0And I offer the same. \u00a0I will dance with them to their obscure Prince songs and let them represent, but break it the eff down for my team captain. \u00a0It's a mighty respectful dance floor, except for the jocky white boys who don't know how to dance and bring a fucking cocktail onto the dance floor (not advised--get a tall can, dude.) and spill that shit all over you, then take their shirt off.  If you respect the bartenders, they will honor you and serve you like a champ. \u00a0There tends to be few behind the bar, and a lot of vying for their attention, but if, in the beginning, you are genuine and kind, and tip well, they will bypass that asshole white dude that now needs another cocktail because it's all over your skirt, to come and pour you a drink.   The bouncers are the kind of bouncers that can actually kick some ass. \u00a0They all look related, and flirt considerately, and if dude were causing problems, they would make it an un-problem. \u00a0But they let in about twice as many people should technically, and safely be in there. \u00a0So don't start a fire, ok? \u00a0  There are only two bathrooms, but there are two gas stations across the way, and dudes, you can piss anywhere, so don't complain about waiting in line for the restroom, unless you plan to do illegal things off the toilet tank. \u00a0In that case, go to one of those gas stations.  Madrone has a bunch of infused booze, which I haven't had, and an extensive multi-paged menu for them. \u00a0I can't comment, as I usually stick to $3 Prohibition ales, and if the dance floor is rowdy, a tall can, or my hip flask (shhh, don't tell). \u00a0There's a pitcher and stacks of glasses (the glass kind) for your hydrational purposes, and the bar back is usually good about maintaining this, so much so don't count on stashing your glass to make his job easier.  Prince v. Michael is the best dance party I've found thus far, and it doubles as church for me, and many others. \u00a0A great lounge with art all over, old school couches and chairs for lounging, good bouncers, an industrial fan and cheap, quality beer on a Saturday night. \u00a0I don't feel right subtracting one star for the bathroom situation or the fire hazard--I've just had too much fun there.  You will too. \u00a0Just don't steal my spot on the dance floor.",

    "review_text": "This review may not really be fare but there was not other way to do the review. I would like to do a \u00a0review of Prince vs, Michael Jackson. P vs. MJ happens at Madrone about once a month. The problem that I have is that it happens at Madrone. The location as a small lounge seems like it would be great. Unfortunately because of the number of people who attend the dance party I never actually made my way to the bar (I believe that there is more than one).   I was surprised to see that Prince vs. MJ happened at such a small venue. I mean you have to take into account that there are a fare number of Prince and Michael Jackson fans, plus the additional hipsters who may show up for the sake of irony. The lounge is about the size of my studio apartment, Which means that it gets really crowded and hot \u00a0early in the night. The only semi constant way that they try to cool the place down is with a shotty electric fan that stops working even if you look at it wrong.   In short, Prince vs. MJ is a good place to start your night. You are likely to hear a lot of songs that you are not familiar with but will still make you want to shake your booty, grab your crotch, wear assless pants and/or make some sort of high pitched exclamation. But you likely will want to leave before you get packed in like a sardine.",

    "review_text": "So... apparently this past Saturday at Madrone was Michael Jackson VS. Prince Night. The DJ was spinning hits from both artists and mixing them together. All the TVs on display were showing a lot of hip thrusting and crotch grabbing by both performers... Before I go on...   MJ, may you rest in peace. You were so awesome...   I'm not complaining. In fact, I was stoked when I found out. I'm HUGE fan of both. When Dove's Cry? Love it. Kiss? Amazing song. Bad? Sweet. Smooth Criminal? Classic. They probably have about 30 number one hits between the two of them.   Madrone sits on the corner of Divisadero and Fell. You'd have to be completely oblivious to your surroundings to miss it. It looks like an old Victorian house but don't let it fool you. The interior is anything but old fashion.   STAFF: Super nice! The bouncers are cool and the bartenders are rad. What I appreciate most at bars is when the bartenders don't big league you and/or pass you over when you've been waiting in line to get a drink. What really makes me upset is when bartenders see that you've been waiting but they keep asking hot chicks what they want before taking your order. If you get to the front of the bar, they'll notice you immediately. Mad props to them.   ATMOSPHERE: It's a fairly tiny place but not too small. Imagine a long narrow room with the bar taking up most of the left wall. They have some seating towards the back as well as a long booth that runs along the right wall. It's fairly dim inside but not too dark. The funny thing is that it feels crowded but you never get that shoulder-to-shoulder feeling. It attracts a pretty mixed crowd but from what I saw, it's dominated by preppies and hipsters. What I love most about this place is that it's a neighborhood destination for dancing. I love to dance, especially when I'm drinking.   WARNING: From what I saw, there's only one bathroom for each gender. Each bathroom only having one toilet, so the lines tend to stack up quickly. Just make sure you unload before going to Madrone or you'll have to wait at least 10 minutes when nature calls.",

I left my credit card by mistake one night after I had my birthday party there, came back that next day (Monday evening) to claim it and pay my tab, and the bartender barely glanced through his stack of credit cards, shrugged, and told me it wasn't there.  Not satisfied with his reaction, I came back the next day, asked a different bartender the same thing, and got the credit card back - the first bartender clearly just didn't care enough to look through his stack of cards.   Not exactly great customer service, especially for something as sensitive as a credit card.  And the kicker? I was overcharged by 11 dollars.  Most bars, with this kind of treatment, I certainly wouldn't come back. But this bar is really nice enough that, despite the occasionally bad service, I come back from time to time.",
