My first experience with The Boardroom was a random Friday night for happy hour a few months ago. \u00a0The place has a cool, surfer theme, which was appropriate for watching \"Point Break\" on the bar's TVs. That was not Casey's choice of movie (the manager who was tending bar that night) but he was joking along with us, chatting with everyone. \u00a0 He even recommended a great new gin to freshen up my tonic.  When we finally contacted him about the possibility of having our launch party there, he was nothing but accommodating. \u00a0It's hard to find a place for 30-40 people for a weekday happy hour without a crazy price tag or an attitude. \u00a0Casey was as happy to have us there as we were to find such great place. \u00a0And in all our planning, Casey was quick to call back, professional with a sense of humor. \u00a0Perfect.  The event went amazingly well. \u00a0Ben was the fantastic bartender taking care of us that night. \u00a0He was so nice, and made great drinks. \u00a0He and Casey even made a signature cocktail for us for the party. \u00a0We also were able to plug our iPod into the sound system and enjoy a personal playlist.  What really sealed it for me is that the next morning, Casey gave a quick call to see how the event went. \u00a0That was unnecessary and completely appreciated. \u00a0So if you are looking for an event space for 20 - 60 people, definitely give Casey a call.  Even the regulars at the bar are super-friendly and nice. \u00a0The food here is really good, as well - can't beat bacon-wrapped tater tots. \u00a0It's a very clean place with a warm vibe. \u00a0(And no, there is no broken sink, like in the photos - it's a perfectly nice bathroom!) \u00a0 When you find yourself in North Beach, thirsty or hungry and in need of a friendly face, head to The Boardroom.",

It's not a huge bar, but I didn't feel claustrophobic when it started getting pretty packed after the game started. I scored some seats up front by the window and when it wasn't too busy, the service was great. I had an order of the crispy pork buns (good+) and the bacon wrapped tater tots (over-hyped and only okay), as well as my fair share of drinks. My main complaint is that well into the evening, there was a TON of people in the bar and only one bartender, so it took forever to get a drink after he noticed you at the huge bar. This wouldn't stop me from returning, but I hope they plan for better coverage when they have events like that.",

He was lucky enough to get the owner, Keith, who assured him he would play his game that evening. Sure enough, a man of his word, Keith had it on the big screen and we bellied up to a tall table surrounded by bar stools.   We were greeted like we had been coming to The Boardroom for years. The guest bartenders, which on Thursday nights take cash tips for different charities, were really friendly and fast. And, by the end of the night we had met the usual staff, and we were chatting it up.  I now know about the trivia night and the fish tacos, so you may see me swaying about on my barstool on Tuesday's (taco in one hand, beer in the other). Thanks for the hospitality!

My buddy and I had just got into San Francisco, it was Halloween Saturday and we'd finished off a 12-pack in our hostel whilst trying half-heartedly to decide what to do. We'd just come off five nights in Vegas so we were a little worse for wear, and weren't sure if we had it in us to go out. I consulted Yelp anyway, memorised the directions to the Boardroom and away we went.  Since we're idiot Australians, we didn't have costumes for Saturday night as we were going to buy them the next day for a party we were going to. So we were essentially the only two people in the place not dressed up. But it didn't matter; bartenders Bruce (Magnum PI) and Ben (Zach Galifianakis) gave us some sage advice on Halloween culture and then plied us with booze. All fucking night.  At some point, one of the guys decided the bar needed to hear the soundtrack from The Hangover, which I just so happened to have on my iPhone. Minutes later, my iPhone was responsible for music for the next hour and a half, even after the soundtrack ran its course. There I found myself, rapping in the back of the bar with a random local girl and thinking \"wow, they're playing some kick-ass songs in here!\" Duh.   I'd also like to use this review to apologise to the off-duty bartender who I kept buying Jameson shots and PBR for, even though he was wasted. I'm sorry man. I know you didn't need them, God knows I didn't either, and one of us had to drink them.",

The prizes for the winning team is a $30 tab and the best team name gets a bottle of champagne. There's nothing like the lure of free booze to bring out the competitiveness in all of us. Hint: the most vulgar team names consisting of four letter terms for female genitalia coupled with some kind of political euphemism usually win. So most nights will start with you arguing with that one really trashed teamate you just met at the bar who claims that JFK was the youngest president ever in American History. Then the other teamates are like \"no you numbnut, it's Teddy Roosevelt\". Somehow that one drunken friend always manages to convince everyone else he's right.

Take a friend a split an order of 20. Its plenty to get all over the place and leave your fingers stanky danky in a good way. Hit it up. Definitely worth it.

It takes too long for her to tally the questions and she comes up with the questions on her own so they are pretty narrow in range. It was also extremely crowded and not well suited for trivia. They had one round that was visual on the TV and the people in the back had to make their way to the other side of the bar to see it. It just wasn't as fun and carefree as the one I'm used to. Get there WAY early if you want to get enough space for a team of more than just you.  The bar itself is cool. A bit divey but has great personality and could be a cool hang out when it's not slammed with people. I'd probably go back to just socialize and drink on any other night...",

We also hit up Mojito (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/mojito-san-francisco#hrid:dvymTm6MwwMq3Ph02rp7oQ\">yelp.com/biz/mojito-san-\u2026</a>). \u00a0Happy hour and food prices were better at Mojito, by far, but the tacos tasted better at the Boardroom. \u00a0Their tacos rival Nick's any day, but their shrimp tacos can't be beat.",

Didn't feel like walking around saying hi to everyone like a town mayor as I know most of the businesses nearby, just didn't feel like talking much.  Ambiance: Small neighborhood joint were the owners knows everyone by their names. Even if you don't know much about the place you will when you leave. Not much going on here it's all about locals stopping by for a drink or so. Since it's small place when there's Giant's or 49er's you will have to use a megaphone to reach someone across the room. 4-5 flatscreen spread through the place nice wooden bar counter with smooth contour groove sit about 12+ at bar if you counter the ends too. A dartboard lot's of pennants and posters articles of local teams some trophys but couldn't get close enough to read the plaque.   Staff: Guy at counter was nice greeted me how you doing? I sat down he said I've seen you around before and I answer I bet you have. We started talking about the upcoming 2014 season for the Giant's.  Cleanliness: It's a bar/restaurant type so I can't say it was clean or not as some areas maybe opposite of what a business should be, let's say I will eat here again.  Eats/Drinks: Order wings $9 and thinking about the bacon wrap tots. Not a fan of fried food but once in a while, yes. Not really sure as I was watching only second half of the game. So bartender walks off and brought me 5pcs on the house. Thank you! Quite delicious. Wash it down with speakeasy $6 including tips.  Products: Mostly finger foods that are easily made in matter of minutes, deep frying. Wings,tots,bacon wrap tots,nachos,sweet pototo fries,hummus, chips/dips,onion rings etc.  Punch Lines: Neighborhood bar,chinatown,little Italy,SFPD Central Station,parking garages,funeral home,Washington square park,fisherman wharf,cafes,italian restaurants,muni buses,post office,banks,delis,trinket shops,coit tower (closed for remodeling),Russian hill,Fairmont hotel,Mark Hopkins hotel.  Tradeoffs: A nearby friendly environment for the locals to meet up or socialized.  Final Thoughts: Don't get me wrong it's a cool place it's just the menu options and noise level is unbearable. I understand it's a sports bar too. Guy yaps on his phone probably to no one because he was to drunk to recognized there's no one on the other side. Those ghost calls can really mess you up pair with drinking. The kind that you think it's vibrating picks up phone no call inbound so you yap about your day to no one. I will come back again with my Giant's/49er's jerseys depending on sports season.",

Sometimes it was hard to hear cuz everyone was talking and i did see people cheating which takes a litle bit of the fun out of it. but the $2 tacos looked really good. . .  however. . . they do NOt pour their drinks very strong. My first drink was strong but for some reason he thought i wouldn't notice that the second one was not. . . not sure why bartenders do this. It's not gonna make me less drunk i;m just not gonna order drinks from here.Just pour me the same drink EVERYTIME. If you don't i'm gonna be a grummpy drunk NOT a HAPPY drunk. I have to say though if your into cheap beer this is the place to go.  The establishment itself is not very big so get their early if your going for trivia. And they are guilty of my biggest pet peive... not having the coat hooks under the counters to put your purse or jacket. BIG FAIL THERE. It was really stuffy and hot. as far as the crowd it's North beach...need i say more",

The trivia girl was hilarious and pretty wasted, while the bartender knew what he was doing and didn't hate on us despite wearing A's gear in a giants bar.  Another star for the multi-media (pictures and music) trivia night. ANOTHER plus was that we won a bottle of champagne for best name (mustache rides are free).  the one caveat to this was the fact that parking is always awful in north beach, and it took us about 20 minutes to find parking.

Sure the name might not have been as clever but Woody Zip's had, and I @#$% you not, the best Buffalo Wings I have ever had. Ever. I don't know what happened or why the name went, but those oh so epic wings went with it.  And alas, all was lost.   So I when I returned to this bar with quite the humbug attitude, just looking for a reason to rail on it, I found that it's still a super fun North Beach spot. \u00a0 Despite it being a small space, the place can get super busy on the Friday / Saturday nights. Loud music and large groups are a staple. The bartenders are really nice and super fun, the folks in here are typically friendly and having a great time. The place is essentially just like the bar I remember it to be, minus those golden god-like wings.  The food here is still pretty damn good bar food and they have some good happy hour specials too.   So, as much as I don't want to admit the new girl is just as much fun as the old flame I had, I'll give The Boardroom a thumbs up. \u00a0  Dear Woody Zips, we'll always have our wings   xoxox  ~Andy",

Both the beef and chicken ones were phenomenal. It was completely unexpected and highly appreciated.   I actually really loved this place. The bar was low-key but alive, the people were not tourists or the over-the-top locals that crawl North Beach at night. They were local people, at a local bar, for a local night of trivia and whatever. The customers were great and were willing to talk to strangers and meet new people.  The bar itself is pretty decent and has a good, small selection of beers including Boont Amber, Guinness, Blue Moon, Red Stripe. They even saluted the neighborhood and had Moretti La Rossa in bottles. The bartender, an interesting fellow named Blake, was pleasant and all about customer service. He wasn't particularly talented, but I truly appreciated the effort and care he put into his job.   There are a few widescreen plasmas and it's probably a decent place to watch a game. The music was also worth mentioning - what other bar you know plays mid-90's Filter and STP and then switches over to 40's pop? And how could I not give at least 4 stars to a place with a neon Sharks jersey beer sign in the window?",

There were only 2 of us so I am proud to say we didn't suck terribly, but the trivia definitely makes you use your brain. We even won a bottle of champagne for our team name (but I think Keith was just being extra nice!) 2 dollar tacos and tecate, I'm sold.

Pop Culture. Music clips. Commonalities (things words have in common). Movie clips. Random category. \u00a070 Questions total. \u00a0Rule number 1 is do not yell out the answer. \u00a0Rule number 2 is no cheating (aka: using iPhones to get answers). \u00a0Rule number 3 is DO NOT YELL OUT the answer. \u00a0Simple enough. \u00a0The host is great, she had to remind a few people about the rules and had a bit of trouble with the microphone. \u00a0  Trivia lasted for a while, maybe about an hour and a half. \u00a0In the end, my team lost by a couple of points. \u00a0But hey, we still won a $25 bar tab for the best team name... \"A Colin in the Barack is worth two in the Bush.\" \u00a0Can't complain.  Good food and drink specials, great service, nice casual bar and an interesting crowd. \u00a0I'm so disappointed that I'm not here more often. \u00a0One of my 2009 New Year Resolution will be to go to The Boardroom more often -- that'll be an easy resolution that I can keep all year, I think.",

I've heard that Woody Zips is somewhat of a dive, but it was decorated really well with flat screens, great lighting, cool artwork and colorful painted walls. The beer selection was decent and so cheap- $3 for a draft pint! I got to talking with the bartender Luke and discovered that he is one of the owner's of Woody Zips. He and the other owner live above the bar and named the place after their fathers. After talking some more, he showed us their upstairs private room that can be rented out, which reminds me of Butter's private room- it looks like more like an apartment than a bar.  The clientele was very relaxed and not many people were there, which was exactly what I was seeking in a Wednesday evening. Swapping stories with the bartender (Luke told me about Spec, the old man who owns Specs and can still be seen there) and relaxing with my friend made for a great night. I really feel that this place could become my \"neighborhood bar\" and can't wait to return.",

You don't need to fight through the crowds of reprobates to get up to the bar, and the prices are right where they should be. People aren't there misbehaving and acting like it's the first time they've been to a bar, even if they are more than a little lit up.

Since it is a smaller spot, I recommend taking a large group with you so and your friends can be the party... as it should be every time you go out.",

I had my last birthday party here, and I would probably have every next one here. Keith let me do drink specials, which were named after me.  If you email Keith, he's very responsive. He loves to have special events, so he's great about working with different folks on what they want.  They also have:  --Bloody Mary bar and bottomless mimosas on the weekend --Delicious tacos --A hummus plate, for a nice healthy option",

    "review_text": "I have mixed emotions about The Boardroom. On the one hand, it's in North Beach, a place I love, the staff is incredibly kind, they play great music, and have lots of big TVs for ample sports viewing.   On the other hand, it smells like my college boyfriend's shared dorm apartment, ie, dirty towels and bong water, trivia night was a huge bust as the hostess was absolutley schwaaasted (like blurting out answers to trivia questions and heckling some guys in the crowd), the place is very tiny and dark, and last but not least (and at no fault of the establishment) we were infultrated by the *biggest douchebags* I have encountered in a while - seriously, they ate the better part our nachos and bacon mac n' cheese and got really angry when we told them to stop and moved our food away.  Me and the girlies started off the day yesterday in high spirits, looking forward to Dr Teeth's Tuesday Trivia / Two-for-One Maragarita deal / Two Dolla Taco fest, only to have our dreams squashed roadside after we learned that *Dr Teeth NO LONGER DOES TRIVIA* (fyi, y'all). So we had to resort to other options. Boardroom is somewhere between all of our offices, so we landed there.   Rita I and I got there waaaay before the trivia rush and planted ourselves at one of the two long tables and filled ourselves with a Margarita and a Corona ($5 each) and waited for our homegirls to grace us with their presence. I had the Fernet and Tecate deal for $6 which was pretty sweet.  Now kiddies, I welcome you to flashforward a few hours to almost trivia time. We were joined by some random menfolk from Canada who made a good impression - at first. Then they proceeded to take and eat our food and tried to justify it. Um, I hate you. Thankfully the staff saw what was happening and took the charge off our bill and put it onto theirs. The chef in the kitchen does major work - cooking and bringing everything out to the many people who order, good work!  We shared Nachos with Carne Asada ($9) which was pretty bomb, plus an order of Mac N' Cheese with Bacon ($8) which was no bueno. It was basically large elbow pasta with a watery cheese sauce and topped with nearly burned bacon bits. Sad face central. Stephanie S got the Bacon Wrapped Tater Tots aka Bac-o-Tots ($8 for five) which she said were yummy, but not a lot came in an order. Rita I had the Buffalo Wings in Island Flavor ($9), which were not particularly meaty, but had good flavor. During trivia we got all fat kid and ordered Tot-chos ($8) and they were OK, a combo of soggy and then dried out, I could probably live without them.  Anywho, I'd like to go back and try brunch. I think last night was also slightly tainted because there was a Wild Card A's v. Royals game on that went to the 12th inning, and there were way too many A's fans clogging up the joint. So that's that: I hope to be back, I hope no more awful men approach me and my friends, and I hope the staff continues to rock on.",

Only complaints:  - the bartenders kind of struck me as douchey, but they kept people entertained and seemed to be on top of 'it'  - everything outside the tacos seemed to be relatively overpriced  - witness oregon beating oklahoma state (i hate the pac10) before the 'trivia night' part started   All in all, seemed to be a nice neighborhood bar and if I lived in the area, I could see myself hanging out there every now and then.",

Get something classy, like Budweiser. The pub quiz is really fun too except that I never know anything except for the questions about pop culture and children's books. The quiz will start late if there are good sports on (like the NBA finals). Expect to stand if you don't get here early enough because the place is really small -- I'm always jealous of the people who get the plush couches in the corner.

Plus they moved the bar from the lefthand wall to the righthand side which tripped me out.  But then I stumbled in a few Fridays back (okay I walked in...but there might have been a slight stumble upon departure), and it was packed, and I mean packed with...wait for it...,no, not hot women...I know what you guys were thinking...but dogs. Gorgeous, playful puppies. \u00a0  I'm so jealous because they are all just lying there on the couch and I *know* I can't bring my baby here because even at almost four and literally the best trained dog I've encountered in SF he's a little energetic. \u00a0Just a little bit. \u00a0Seriously, remember back when drugs were cool and people had money and did blow? \u00a0Sonny's like that ALL THE TIME. \u00a0(That's a lie, he's a Labrador so he sleeps 18 hours a day, but the 6 that he's up he's MOVING).  So this Saturday rolls around and its a beautiful day and I feel a need to get outside. \u00a0Sonny and I stroll over to meet a lady friend of mine at Washington Square Park. \u00a0We're there like 10 minutes or so when she says \"You know there's NCAA basketball on right now?\" \u00a0My heart melted a little. \u00a0Seriously...that's like hearing a woman say \"My hot bisexual roommate wanted to know if she could join us?\"  So knowing that the Boardroom is dog friendly and has at least 5 flatscreens, I decide to see if Sonny can play nice with mellow dogs. \u00a0We walk in and there's another lab, Maya, (whom I'd met before) there and the two of them get along famously, even though she's one hot bitch and Sonny still has his balls.   It was a minor pain in the ass because Sonny's favorite room in the bar is naturally the kitchen, so I have to keep one eye on him, which leaves the remaining eye split between the game, the girl who wanted to go watch the game, and our order of tater tots.  That's right...tater tots. \u00a0The 5th food group. \u00a0With two dipping sauces, one of which was cheese. \u00a0For like $2. \u00a0Also, while I didn't partake I did notice that on weekends they offer bottomless mimosas with their brunch menu. \u00a0$12...not a bad deal.  To recap:  1. sitting in a bar with my dog 2. getting buzzed on a Saturday afternoon 3. watching Elite Eight basketball 4. with a hot girl who's idea it was to watch the basketball  5. eating tater tots  Whoever called Disneyland the happiest place on earth never tried the Boardroom with that quint-fecta goin' on.",

That was too much for me to resist. I HAD to bite. We ended up having a loud roaring debate on whether Paris Hilton was a victim of her celebrity. Almost sends me into a rage just writing it...

On a side note: I came to SF for the first time for Fourth of July this year and stayed with a friend down the street. One of his former roommates is friends with Luke, the owner, so we watched the fireworks from the roof of Woody Zips, which was pretty damn awesome. Had some beers and food at Lukes apt as well (though I would totally not expect him to recognize me, he was basically letting us use his apartment with its roof top access, he was out of the apartment and at the bar 90% of the time, and there were lots of people there).

And also the questions aren't too hard... love it when they have the questions about movies and clips of it they show on the screen. Almost too easy for me! - food deals up the wazzooo... cheap and delicious! 50 cent wings on Mondays, and their tacos on Tuesdays are quite delicious.  - almost always having Mirror Pond on tap - their decor is quite lovely. They don't call it The Boardroom for nothing. - great place to watch games. Everyone gets into it! - they have great bartenders. Especially Ben, whom is very witty and charming and is always up for some conversation.  Long story short, it's an all around cool bar to be at. You all should go!",

It is a locals bar, and that's nice since I live in the area, and have had my fill of tourists at day's end. The problem being that North Beach locals and I don't have similar tastes at all. See, I am a person that will actually gravitate more toward the divey bar than the posh one.  So, naturally I was excited by people's reviews saying it was a dive bar. When I arrived, I was reminded of why I don't fit in in North Beach. This place is NOT a dive bar, it's a cross between a neighborhood bar in a strip mall in Orange County (if those exist there) and a sports bar. People also claim it's laid back, so I wore a nice t shirt and jeans, and felt shabby in comparison. This was a Thursday night, and it seemed to be on fire when we arrived, about midway through, the crowd was just one group and split. I thought Thursday was the new Friday?  So, most of the minus points are just because it wasn't my type of atmosphere, and because of the 90s corny lite rock/pop playlist. And a huge minus for the guy that turned the music off completely, then yelled for everyone to \"be quiet and listen for a cellphone.\" Buzzkilling douche! Plus points were having Afflingem on tap (with correct glassware), 2 dogs chasing each other across the place, and a nice bartender without 'tender 'tude.",

The bloody mary is divine and garnished with a house-pickled green been (yum), $14 pitchers of mimosas are just what some weekends call for, and the irish coffee is so, so lovely.  The breakfast BLT is crispy and buttery and pretty much everything your poor pounding head needs. Also tasty is the breakfast burrito (with sausage) and bacon wrapped tots are a classic.  I'm not a fan of sweet food for breakfast, but the biscoff french toast looks amaze as well.",

    "review_text": "After reading all of the great reviews about this place I decided, with a little prompting from my roommate, to see what it was all about. Up to this point I was a little hesitant. I remember when this place was Shannons and I wasnt sure someone could turn that dump into something desireable,   The new owners have done a good job of giving this place a facelift. Completely gutted the place and started over and it is now a somewhat upscale looking sports bar, complete with 4 TVs and local artists work hanging on the walls.  Everyone was friendly. We went on a Monday night and had their fried chicken special ($12 for chicken, some really good mac and cheese and a side of veggies). They were even willing to give us 1.5 orders of it since the three of us each wanted to split an order with one another.  The beer prices seemed a lttle high ($5 a beer) for being off the beaten path a bit. For a bar that is working on being a neighborhood bar rather than a tourist haven they should really think about dropping the prices just a bit.  Overall a pretty cool neighborhood place. I am curious to see how it evolves.  3/9/07 - Update - after spending another evening at Northstar I realized this place deserves an extra star...I forgot how god awful some of the places in good ol' NB can be.  3/17/10 - Update - this bar is no longer Woody Zips (clearly) and I have been back several times since it has changed hands again and become the Boardroom. Some of the food items have changed, but they are all still good, possibly even better, and they have added bottomless mimosas on the weekends so I see there are even further improvements!!",

Almost a 2.5 week long binge on partying and socializing has left me running on empty (both via the bank account and my energy levels) but I wanted to check out this North Beach spot due to all the hype.   I'm so glad I managed to get here. There are so many reasons to trek all the way up from the TL.   1. Its off of Broadway so I'm fairly confident that it won't get packed on a Friday or Sat.  2. Accepts credit cards ($20 min.)  3. Real cool/fast/attentive bartenders who are easy going and know the regulars well.  4. Totally reminds me of my regular watering hole (Whiskey Thieves).  5. Happy Hour: $2 tacos, $2 beers, $3 Chicken Sliders, $6 Jager/Olompia special. They also have tater tots and fries. Overall, a great bar food selection.  6. THE BEST TRIVIA NIGHT I HAVE BEEN TO. I have been to trivia night at 3 previous bars and this trivia had the most diverse set of questions which allows everyone to participate. Now if they only had a round of flip cup, that would be just peachy. We won second place for the best team name. Woot.   Can't wait to come back for those tots.   ps. To the cute girl I met that night: See I didn't throw up on you, hit me up some time....",

The fact their cocktails lacked essential ingredients, however, is the reason I'm giving this bar a low rating. \u00a0I ordered an irish coffee that didn't have any whipped cream on top and a pisco sour that didn't have any egg whites in it. I can excuse a poorly made cocktail in a dive bar, but an incorrectly made one is where I have to draw the line.   BONUS TIP: For good cocktails nearby, check out Tony Nic's Cafe or 15 Romolo.",

The chips and salsa (chips are deep fried), the burger (is huge) and the sweet potato fries are insane! My favorite thing about this place is that they serve corn dogs.

We showed up on Tuesday at 6 and they put the debate on their three big flat screen tvs. We all ordered tacos ($2) and Olympia ($2) and were very pleased with the beef, chicken, and fish tacos. They even made a vegetarian taco for my veggie friend!  After the debate ended the bar started to get really crowded. Everyone was showing up for Trivia Night. My team, The Answer is Five, was tied for first place up until the spelling round where we got destroyed...sad :(  I will definitely be coming back and I'm already recruiting spellers for next week. The trivia was great. They did a music round with clips of songs and a movie round with video played on the tvs. They had a name that person, picture round and then a few round of random information ranging from Current Events to Sports to Pop Culture.   The bar isn't that big but it's very nice inside. They have chairs along the wall, a couple tables in the corner and a couch and some comfy chairs near the back. They also have a second bathroom in the \"storage closet\" in case you really need to go.  I'm really glad I checked this place out. Their sign is black and red and not inviting but now that I know what it's like inside, I'm planning to spend a lot of time there.   They also do Bingo night on Wednesdays!",

My boyfriend, who claims to love Boadroom in a four-star-kind-of-way, ordered a beer. When I finished forcing down the gross vodka soda I asked him to order me the same beer that he had. He said, \"Uh, I do not think you want this beer.\" It was a beer, what could be wrong with it? Warm and flat. I learned that the hard way.  I was completely underwhelmed in a neighborhood with so many bars. We had some snacks which were fine--typical deep fried bar food. The crowd was eclectically entertaining.

    "review_text": "After eating several entrees of food and enjoying a couple drinks, my friends and I were outside chatting with some other guests and my girlfriend brought me a beer while I was outside. She claimed that the bartender was cool with this. While we were outside talking, a man who claimed to be the owner happened to be walking into the bar at the same time. He stated that we could not have our drinks outside, to which we gladly obliged and brought our beverages inside. At this point the owner seemed very upset with the bartender for letting this happen. Once inside, my girlfriend went back outside to have a smoke and did not have any drinks with her. She had been outside for about 20 min and since the area is a little dark and shady, I decided to peek my head out the front door to check on her. Let me clarify, I did not set foot outside of the door I only looked outside to make sure my girlfriend was OK. At this point, the bartender very rudely asked me to give him my drink. I believe he was trying to make up for his prior mistake of letting us take the drinks outside and to look good in front of the owner. Once again, I did not put up a fight and gave him my drink and the bartender never mentioned that I was cut off or could not have another drink. About 5 minutes later, my buddy had an extra drink, which he gave to me. When the bartender saw me with another drink he proceeded to officially kick me and my whole group of friends out of the bar. My other friends asked why they were being kicked out as well and the owner claimed \"Because you are with him and I have to backup my bartender\". My friends were from outside of the area and I felt we were being treated unjustly and unfairly because we were seen as outsiders. Message to the bartender: own up to your mistakes and don't try and make up for it by being overly strict to customers, that is not a fair way to treat your business.  tl;dr: I had a terrible experience at this bar. Even though our entire group was being respectful, and under control we were told to leave. Mind you, the bartender had already received his payment for our $80 tab, which included food and drinks, when he decided to kick us out. Which I'm sure had something to do with the ease in which he kicked us out.",

The questions were asked at a good pace, and they didn't take forever to score the answers. \u00a0While we played, we had 4 or 5 pitchers of Blue Moon, the steak nachos, tater tots, sweet potato fries, tacos, grilled cheese and onion rings. \u00a0Everything was decent but the nachos, tacos and sweet potato fries were the favorites.  Our total at the end of the night was really reasonable, and the bartenders were smartasses, just like I like them. \u00a0We'll be back.",

So I kicked that bitch to the curb.   2) The bartender is a cool ass dude. This is weird that I have to even say this because I feel like one of the prerequisites of being a bartender should be \"don't be a dick\", but we all know how that usually goes.   3) I like mimosas.   4) The brunch was awesome as hell. I haven't had anything bad from the brunch menu. You also got to have respect for a place where the guy cooking your food, brings it to you. So you know he wouldn't dare bring you something shitty because he has to look you in the eye.   5) I got to piss off everyone with my musical selections on the \"juke box\"",

Yum. All of them yum. Not quite Nick's, but close. Chicken Sliders- $3. Super tasty and not remotely good for your health. Pretty good calamari, and the steak nachos and quesadilla are delish, esp the nachos. Sweet potato fries seem to be a hit/miss. Rest assured the tacos are always the bomb.

The ass at the door lets half of my group in, it's obvious btw that we're all together in a group. Then puts his hand out to stop me, \"How \u00a0many in your group?' \u00a0I reply, \"Um we're with them.\" My friend comes back and \u00a0wants to know why only half the group got in. I make what I thought was a humorous crack and say \"Apparently our kind are not welcome in there.\"..Comment not taken well. He flips out and then proceeds to tell me how I am not welcome in his establishment, my kind won't be tolerated and that I am \u00a0rude. WOW!!!!!!!

How do you 86 someone that can bearly see over the bar??!!?? lol  I'm saddened I feel like this bar had serious potential. I will never set foot in there again \"as my kind are not tolerated.\"  ***UPDATE: So I have yet to go back to this bar, but I'm going to update my review anyhow. After reading my not-so-nice review, I was contacted by both owners. AWESOME! Yelp justice at it's finest. They both apologized and I believe I have a beer with my name on it \u00a0next time I visit.

We discovered that they do $2 tacos all the time, leading us to ponder perhaps a Taco Thursday? But I digress...  Started with Blue Moon on tap, then had a Tiger Beer (yay Asia!), then devolved to bottles of PBR. Seems like the drink of choice for most others that night was the $2 Olys though.  Spent between 6 and 8:30pm getting a good buzz on and chatting up the bartender (Shout Out Keith!).  Trivia started around 9 and, well, we sucked. But it was a blast and we were thoroughly happy when we left at 11:15. Next time our team name will be: Drinking our way to last place. (Oh, and it wasn't overly crowded... maybe we picked an off night.)

WE were looking for a place that my friend could watch the game and we finally landed mainly due to Yelpers on this place. The fact they had bacon wrapped tater tots was simply deep fried icing on the cake. When we go there we were surprised at how small it was but they indeed had several screens on and one of them was the game my friend wanted to watch. We of course wanted to dine so the extremely cool and helpful bartender (Martin) got us fixed up with menus.  The selections were not your typical bar food, my friend had a veggie burger with sweet potato fires, I can vouch for the fries as I stole a few (for review purposes of course). I ordered the signature bacon wrapped tots, and a breakfast burrito that took up the entire plate. It was very tasty and really not too overwhelming for its shear mass, but had what I have to assume was house made guac, and other goodies. I also had their secret sweet tea vodka concoction which I have to admit would be dangerous if consumed too fast or if you had to be somewhere serious but in the context of brunch it was just right. So I had 2.   I guess the biggest plus for this place was it was clearly a neighborhood pub, and we were clearly not from the area but I felt they treated us as if we were there every night, I think anybody can sling drinks but Martin made us feel like he was opening his home and making sure we got whatever we needed. And he had great taste in music which never hurts.  If you are looking for a great brunch and what I assume is a great place when the sun goes down to enjoys some drinks head on over to The Boardroom.",

The buffalo wings were standard glazed with some tabasco not to much just rite amount with ranch on the side with few celery sticks and carrot sticks  about 4 tv's that I could see 3 playing the WS Championship Giants playing and one playing motorcross, definitely a place you should venture into when in the area  food ***** for the BAC-O-TOTS hell yes price $ happy hour M-F service ***** ambiance ***** small, lil divey, friendly staff, bartender is a trip haha!!   also music in the background was mellow, sounds of Benny and the Jets playing, Lowrider and other nostalgic music.",

Let's be honest, watching dogs is much more entertaining than watching the Giants win.   The bartender was really cool to tell my boyfriend and I that the small nachos were more than enough for the both us. Usually I'll let my stomach do the talking, but after a shot or 2 and a beer, I'll go with what he said. UGH SO GOOD. Thank you, barkeep for the suggestion. I don't think we even finished it.",

    "review_text": "A Sunday morning my friend and I were standing in a 2-plus hour line for a well-known restaurant with high reviews and eventually we tired of waiting and I decided to use my yelp app to look for less-crowded places near by. Luckily for us, The Boardroom was what we picked. I was a bit apprehensive of eating in a bar at 11am when I wanted some really great breakfast food, but most on yelp said it was to be trusted so we went for it. I am sooo glad I did. What first got me in there was the bacon-wrapped tater tots-they did not disappoint (except for the fact that I wanted more after we finished the basket. Don't share-get your own!). I have never had anything like them and I will be drooling at the thought of them for quite a while-at least until I get my hands on a deep fryer and perfect the recipe. After our appetizer we ordered the cookie dough stuffed French toast and the Croque madame-both were delicious. Then, as if we hadn't splurged enough, we decided to go for the pitcher of mimosa. During the time it took us to get our buzz on I played around with the really cool app that lets you pick the music in the bar from your smartphone.  The food gets an A+ and so does the service. Marvin made us feel super comfortable and welcome from the moment we walked in and gave us excellent advice on menu items, city tips and picker-uppers to help with a food coma. I also thought it was pretty cool that they served Pisco and Fernet-things I had been missing ever since my visit to Chile that have been pretty hard for me to come by in the US. Plus, they make their own alcohol infused whipped cream-delish! Every time I make my way up to Nor Cal I will definitely make sure this is one of my stops.",

I arrived at 7:30 on Tuesday night with three co-workers for trivia and bonding time with new employees. Upon entering, our new art director ordered a round of Jager bombs, a variety of salty deep fried foods a round of beers to follow. Yeah, it was that kind of Tuesday night.  We got a great table in the corner an the crowd slowly but surely began to gather as it neared 8:30. We had our exceptional Jager bombs and though they don't have a large selection of beers on tap, they a great selection behind the bar. Our food soon arrived and we devoured deliciously flavorful shrimp tacos, corn dogs with a fabulous cornmeal batter and something as sinister, and fabulous as bacon wrapped tater tots. We were all fat kids last night.  The night progressed with more jager and tequila shots to go around. We didn't win trivia night and came to the conclusion that we need a geography wiz and someone well versed in bad movies.   As a whole, the bathroom is pretty clean, the bartenders are friendly and the space is small but cozy. It's just the right size crowd for this type of event and it turned out to be a fantastic evening out. I will surely go again once we brush up on our bad movies.",

I wasn't a huge fan of the quesadillas, but I think it was because they were filled with black beans and other veggies that I don't like. Whatever. The other food made up for it.   The bartender was freaking awesome and knew his stuff about beer and good music. So that's always a plus. I wanna check this place out during a football weekend, because i heard it's crazy fun to watch sports at this bar. I guess it's just another excuse for coming back to San Francisco.

    "review_text": "Came here with the BF and his sister when I got a hankering for some burgers- this place came up and was nearby, so off we went. Was told upfront that it was a bar that serves food rather than a burger place, specifically. Good thing too, because when we arrived there was only bar seating and we hesitated at first, thinking maybe we would not be able to eat here.  Luckily, we stayed- probably because the game was on and we didn't want to waste time finding a new spot, but the fact that wings were on special really helped, too. \u00a0Fifty cent wings on Mondays, 5pm-10pm.  We ordered a round of beers (had the hawaiian one on draft- can't remember the name, but it was light and sweet, refreshing) and a ton of food: a burger and the brisket dip to share, with sides of bac-o-tots and onion rings, plus (what amounted to) 25 wings in spicy bbq, hot, and spicy island. More on those in a minute.  Burger was just okay, dip sandwich was dry and tough and we did not finish it- very unusual for us. Bac o tots were awesome, but seemed overrated based on other reviews we read here. Onion rings were okay.  The WINGS are where it's at though- specifically the SPICY ISLAND. I could bathe myself in that sauce. It was phenomenal- I was expecting something with pineapple that's overly sweet and not usually my thing, but this one.. dude, I can't even figure out what was in it! A fresh green herb/spice was present, possibly basil? Or maybe thai basil? Overall the taste to me was more thai than island, but whatever the hell you want to call it, we ordered extras of it, and even then I was dipping my pieces in the extra sauce puddled at the bottom of our basket.  Service was good- bartender/server clearly enjoys his job and was making conversation with most at the bar. Made good food/drink recommendations. Space itself is divey, and that's okay- all the TVs were working and the food was good, so that's all that matters.  Definitely want to add that the unisex bathroom was surprisingly VERY clean, which I almost didn't expect based on the looks of this place- but the appearance is deceiving. Most dive bars have mediocre foods and questionable cleanliness- and you'll find the exact opposite here: phenomenal island wings and tidy space, from the bathroom to the bartop.",

All the worst kind of douchey sausages that you could never want to meet. I truly hope that we had an off experience last night when we went to trivia because I feel sorry for the Boardroom staff if that is what their normal patrons are like. I'll probably only go back if I feel like it's a good night to get constantly harassed.  BUT the bar. The most important part of the review. The people working there are great. Nice people. But there were no waiters, so be prepared to go to the bar to order. The food, for the most part, was good bar food. Bacon wrapped tater tots: Delicious (though few in quantity. Not shareable, in my humble, bacon-loving opinion). Tacos: Yum Yum. Nachos: Great. Mac 'n Cheese: Not great. Just avoid it. They lured me with the promise of cheese and bacon and I felt duped! It was more watery than cheesy and even the bacon couldn't save the dish!  $5 margaritas were okay, but not strong at all. I had four and felt fine. I should have been buzzin' hard though; I am quite the lightweight. But they have $2 Tecates on Tuesday, which is a sweet deal, so you should definitely go for that.  The reason we went to The Boardroom, however, was to participate in Trivia Tuesday, which was disappointing, in my opinion. It started about a half hour late, which, in fairness, was due to the A's vs. Royals game going into extra innings, but it just got going too late for a work night, if you ask me. I couldn't hear the woman reading the questions. When she spoke at a good volume, she was kinda mumbling (drink much, lady?). And there were HUGE time gaps between rounds. I heard that it is usually better organized than that, but it was frustrating for me and my gal pals.  My general experience there probably warrants less than 4 stars, but I truly believe it was an off night based on what I've heard from others, the yumminess of the greasy food, and the quality of the service. Worth a shot, just beware of male patrons: they just may be nacho-stealing tards.",

The Good: 1) Solid Tuesday trivia night - a little long for my taste, but the questions are always pretty solid, and the $2 Tacos are amazing. 2) Terrific laid back atmosphere with the owners and bartenders dogs roaming the floor for scraps, and some good seating areas. 3) It's selection of both high end and cheap beer is amazing. \u00a0Anytime a bar serves Olympia and PBR you know you have a solid establishment. 4) By far the best bloody mary in all of North Beach 5) The bartenders and owners are super nice.  The Bad 1) The food has gone somewhat downhill. \u00a0They used to have amazing burgers and pretty good wings (I'm from Buffalo so I probably have higher wing standards than most), but since changing over to the Boardroom from Woody Zips, it hasn't been quite as good (they do serve a solid meatloaf sandwich though). \u00a0Still the last time I ordered a burger I was less than impressed. \u00a0It also seems as though the fries aren't as good as I once remembered. \u00a0In their defense I know that they've gone through a bunch of chefs over the past few months which would explain the downgrade.   2) When it's crowded the service can be a little on the slow side, and due to the layout of the bar it can be really difficult to get the bartenders attention (I realize this isn't the only place).  3) $20 credit card minimum can be annoying.",

Service: Excellent with one bartender and basic w/ another so that averages out to above average...like a B. \u00a0  Booze: decent to shelf liquors at decent prices...small selection of drafts with nothing to write home about.  Grub: Don't know. \u00a0It's in North Beach which basically has about 14 restaurants per square foot (no exaggeration)...so I usually eat elsewhere. \u00a0However, I have witnessed their Tater Tots covered with melted cheese. \u00a0How can you fuck this up? \u00a0Therefore, the food must be about average if you feel like eating there and regretting later what you eat (read basically just like any average bar food).  Nuts and Bolts: They actually have really....really clean floors. \u00a0Recently, an earring may have been lost on the ground and our party searched the floor for it's whereabouts (to no avail) but I did remark to myself \"Wow, these floors are like...pristine...even for a non-bar they'd be impressive.\" \u00a0The bathroom is spacious and as clean as you can expect. \u00a0The bar area is large and there is an abundant amount of stools to accommodate most of the patrons.   Intangibles: This is an ASU bar. \u00a0On a Saturday you can find that 90% of the TVs are tuned into the ASU game or games that will effect ASU. \u00a0So c'mon down if you're an alum! \u00a0If not, c'mon on down anyway because it is a decent bar!  Well don't come if you're from University of Arizona...  ...well that may be moot since chances are if you're an alum from U of A you probably are delivering pizzas on any given night so you're probably busy.",

The bathroom isn't the size of a closet, but the bar itself isn't that big. It seems to cater to the locals, where everyone knew each other but us.   No comment on the food, since I try hard to stay away from food served at a typical bar where the kitchen seems to be invisible.",

Bacotots were a lot spendier than I thought they'd be. For a dollar more than the boat of regular tots, you got like 9 bacon wrapped tots. Don't get me wrong, those bacotots were perfectly crisp and tasty, but I'm still trying to grasp why there's such a difference in quantity. Labor intensive? Meh.",

The bartender had thrown a plastic cup at me from behind the bar. When I asked him why, he stated \"You looked like you weren't having fun.\" Yes, because hitting me with a projectile object is going to help me have an awesome time. Screw you. Who behaves like that and works in customer service?",

    "review_text": "Happened to stumble upon the Boardroom one day while we were scouting drink specials in North Beach before a friend's band played at Grant &amp; Green.   BEST. STUMBLE. EVER.  Walked in enticed by the tecate + jagermeister special. You can't go wrong with that combo for $6. It was a pretty quiet night, so we chatted up the bartender about the confusion of which football team the bar roots for, and their beers on tap. I must have looked hungry because the next thing I know, he plops a menu down right in front of me.   Perused it a bit, hoping for something small to tide us over before dinner time. And saw the most enticing words I have ever seen on a bar menu \"Bacon wrapped tots.\" Bacon wrapped tots?!?!?! I was intrigued. So we ordered them up assuming the worst, but hoping for something at least worth digesting.  A few minutes later, we were presented with a plate filled with tiny brown treasures that smelled like an angel's fart (kinda salty and fills the room.... but in a good way). The bartender knew we were about to lose our bacon-wrapped-tot-virginity, so he gave us the run down. The ranch is infused with bacon au jus (!!!!!) and mixed with a bit of the house hot sauce is the perfect little bite.   Oh dear God. My mouth was dancing. That bite was euphoric. The tot was perfectly cooked- tender and fluffy in the center with a nice tot-ty texture. The bacon, which I completely expected to be a chewy mess that would destroy the tot, was quite the opposite. The bacon was crispy and light and perfectly salty without being toooo salty. The ranch complemented the tot so beautifully as if they were created only to accompany each other in life. And the house hot sauce..... just enough heat to wake up your tastebuds so that they can experience this tot magic exactly as the heavens imagined.   Aside from this experience, everything else about this place is fantastic. The locals are really friendly and the bartenders are freakin hysterical. There are always sports on the two TVs and the rest of the food is pretty good too. They have a great brunch menu, if you're into that kind of thing too. I hear the bloody mary is yummy.  Thanks Boardroom, for ruining tots everywhere else.",
