Monroe has bouncers that simply think they're better than everyone and Dude, this is SF not VEGAS. Here's what happened:  My friends girlfriend decided to have her birthday there. I was not on the guestlist so I expected I would have to pay for their cover (and I'm ok with that). My friends and I took a cab there right at 10pm and there was NO one in line at all. There were a 2 white guys and a female that got in right before us. The bouncer (Russian guy with an accent) asks if we were on the guestlist. My two friends were and I was not. The Bouncer then says \" I just told the trio right before you that we're expecting to be over capacity and you can't get in if you're not on the guestlist\" . My friend then says well what if he pays cover (since I was willing to anyways). The bouncer then says ok, we can let you in if you pay $40.   Now this is Bullsh*t! \u00a0$40 for a dead ass lounge is downright highway robbery. Like I said, this ain't no Vegas. So my friend's girlfriend asked the bouncer \"I thought you said you're over capacity\" and the bouncer said well if he pays $40, I'll risk it and let him in. I said F*ck it and didn't pay the $40 (just so he can pocket the $$). I went to the other bars in the area and gave them my business.  I hope the Monroe management reads this review and fires that bouncer. I give this place ZERO stars!",

The bartender or server had approached us to see what we wanted for our next drink. \u00a0She even asked if Ketel One Vokda was ok for the mixed drinks. \u00a0Not too many places on Broadway would ask that. \u00a0Apparently a friend of the club promoter was throwing her b-day party here that night which was cool.  Then again, I realized that his place is a lot more classy than the other clubs around the area. \u00a0You don't really realize how ghetto the other places are until you step into a place like this on the same street. \u00a0The music was excellent too... not sure if the DJ is a regular on the weekends but he spun a really great mix of hip hop tracks and new school stuff. \u00a0They do have a small dance floor area that works well and an additional bar on that side. \u00a0Ended up having some good ol' fun at this new venue. \u00a0I had been back once since then am really glad a place like this exists on Broadway.",

I have been here twice now and I must say I will be back, I don't make it out to the city much but when I do this place is a must stop off. The crowd is great and the services/management is very friendly. I love the fact that this place has an out door patio with overhead coverage so you can have some fresh air or enjoy a smoke in a covered area.

    "review_text": "Background: \u00a0Small Club/Lounge located just moments from your favorite Broadway venues.   Details: Venue: $10 cover at 11:15 because we didn't make the 11pm guest list.  There are a few seats and tables outside of the front door. Inside, they have two bars. One large main bar, and one small bar. On a Saturday night when I went they only had the small side bar with 3 bartenders for the crowd. There are 4 tables for bottle service. \u00a0There is virtually no dancefloor and you end up with the house staff shining their flashlight all over the place in your eyes to get through but there isn't really a crowd. Oh and spilled drinks definitely DO NOT get wiped up. The side bar is located right by the entrance too, so there's a giant bottleneck when you get in.   Crowd: Hard to characterize the crowd because there weren't many people there and it felt borderline dead. \u00a0The girl to guy ratio was pretty good for the guys.   Music: Pop/Hip Hop. The DJ kept on only playing sniplets of songs and then zipping to another song. Barely any house/EDM. The highlight of the night was the backstreet boys and britney.   Drinks: If you really like ice, then the drinks here will satisfy you! Their main bar and bar area wasn't even open. I remember paying $17 for a midori sour and kamakazi shot, so their drink prices are pretty standard and not overwhelmingly ridiculous. \u00a0The bar itself is a mess, bartenders don't clear away empty cups fast enough, spilled drinks galore and napkins stuck to the bar.   Verdict: 2.5. I didn't have a horrible time here, just underwhelmed by the whole experience. The venue is poorly designed and not well kept by the staff. \u00a0I don't think it's impossible to have a good time here, and I'd give it another try on another night when there are more people, a better DJ and more of the venue open.",

My experience there a week ago was a welcomed surprise amidst my deep-seeded notions of the Broadway strip...I begrudgingly went on a Saturday night for a friend's going-away party that was executed by a promotional events company. \u00a0There was a solid crowd by 10pm, but drinks were still pretty easy to get at either of the two bars. \u00a0The signature cocktails are a must; made with all fresh ingredients and reasonably priced. \u00a0The music was bumpin' and just right for the scene...with a nice crescendo towards the sweet spot of the night. \u00a0  The decor is fabulously \"hollywood glam\" but in a delightfully understated way. \u00a0The tables surrounding the dance floor look like they might be reserved for bottle service, but Monroe doesn't do bottle service. \u00a0I love this - they have not followed the typical club scene formula. \u00a0There are two bars, which is key because it helps to keep the crowd even throughout the venue. \u00a0And, there is also a semi-enclosed outdoor space for the smoking crowd that has plenty of seats and allows for conversation away from the loud music. \u00a0  The best parts about Monroe are the owners' vision and execution. \u00a0They have created a classy haven that puts many of their neighbors to shame. \u00a0They serve delicious bars bites, unique wines on tap, and a memorable time for all. \u00a0Their dress code helps to filter the crowd and their service is spot on. \u00a0Nader, one of the owners, is approachable and attentive. \u00a0I had a bit of a mishap with my credit card and ID that was not at all Monroe's fault and when I returned to level with them, Nader was sympathetic and unbelievably responsive. \u00a0He more than made up for something that was the fault of another guest at his venue, which is something most lounges or clubs might try to skirt. \u00a0  Bottom line: this is not your typical, run-of-the-mill club. \u00a0This is a gem that would turn any club or lounge hater into a loyal convert. \u00a0  Here's to Monroe's success!",

Once we are in we over hear the bartender telling the bouncer there is no cover, so we complain, and the bouncer doesn't want to give us the cover back.

A trendy blue wall, massive mirrors, tasteful chandeliers delicately dropped from airy ceilings. Check out the photos.  The drinks? Ah, there's the bit of the rub. The brunette bartendress was awkward behind the bar, throwing together a sad version of a cocktail on their menu. She told me there's another bartender who is the mixologist. So, in the meantime, they have an inexperienced person manning that menu? tsk.   The vibe? It was pretty quiet at 7pm Wednesday so I can't say.

    "review_text": "As mentioned, I hosted a birthday party at Monroe over the weekend. Here's my update:  1) I was not aware that your guests had to fill out web form that needed to be completed in order to get on the guest list. \u00a0On the form, the guest had to provide an email addy as well as a phone #. \u00a0I personally thought that was TMI just to get into a party (that I'm paying for) so that Monroe can solicit their events. \u00a0Your guests can bypass this altogether but be prepared to pay a cover charge. \u00a0  2) Because of the size of my party, I requested to have at least 2 seasoned servers who can handle a big group. Emily was our main server for the entire night. \u00a0She was an absolute gem and worked well under pressure. But as I anticipated, she was not fast enough to serve my guests. \u00a0The other server \u00a0was no where to be found. \u00a0There was an Asian girl backing Emily up from time to time but she was NO HELP at all. \u00a0Of course you can order drinks at the bar and deal with the line, but I also had a bar tab minimum so every drink counted on my bill. If you're reserving a booth, the policy is that it's one bar tab on one credit card. \u00a0Meaning, I would get stuck figuring out who owes what at the end of the night. No one was allowed to pay cash or use their card, otherwise, it wouldn't be credited to my minimum. THAT WAS NOT GOING TO WORK...and THAT'S not good service.   3) I also ordered a number of appetizers that was suppose to be served before 10pm. \u00a0THAT didn't happen either.  I lucked out that DJ ROSS One and Chris Larot was spinning that night. \u00a0If you don't know who Chris Larot is....CHECK HIM OUT! That boy is HOT! =) ALTHOUGH, be weary of the crowd he brings in! \u00a0I swear, I felt like Vallejo was reppin! \u00a0The night ended early cuz two fights broke out. Entertaining but c'mon now...really???  Even though there were a couple of snafus along the way, the party \u00a0was a success! That big booth in the back served us well for a party of 50! It was comfortable enough for peeps to chat, dance, drink, and watch. The rest of the area was PACKED! It looked like everyone was having a great time, including the bday boy who was being served Manhattans all night long! \u00a0And I owe it to Rosana and Emily for being really flexible! \u00a0I know I had a lot of expectations and it was such a busy night. \u00a0So thank you again for making that night a great one!",

Unlike its fellow Broadway counterparts, Monroe does indeed offer a classier atmosphere than its ghetto neighbors. Decor is interesting...there's a large mural of a chick with a super intense gaze that's a bit unsettling. Crowd here wasn't too rowdy and wasn't 99% Asian like many other SF venues either.   But, I still wouldn't say I exactly enjoyed myself. Between people spilling multiple drinks on me, stepping on/pushing me, and a security guard telling us there were too many ppl at our friend's table &amp; that a few of us would have to leave, I was kind of annoyed by the end of the night. Although I wouldn't say these are faults specific to Monroe, just general annoyances that would arise with any club. On a side note, the dj was also late doing the countdown to 2013. Per my iPhone, it was already 12:00 when he started counting and then he said \"Happy 2003\" at the end. Thought that was kind of amusing.   Maybe it's a sign I'm getting old, but I found myself irritated more than anything throughout the duration of the night. It didn't help that a drunk friend went missing too. Finally found her on the corner of Broadway &amp; Columbus semi passed-out on some sleezy looking dude who was trying to get them a taxi (thankfully it's a b*tch getting a taxi on NYE).   Needless to say, I think I'm more partial to spending NYE 2014 at home with friends in my sexiest pair of sweatpants. This is not all at the fault of Monroe though, so three stars!",

We had no problem getting all our guests in without a wait. \u00a0Near the end of the night security was stationed to keep randoms from lingering around our tables. The cocktail server was professional and attentive. The DJ played a combination of hip-hop and alternative mixed with house music. Everyone has different taste, but I would have appreciated less pop and more new music.",

What I enjoyed the most is the fact that he's actually DJ-ing. I requested a song and he mixed it in just a song later. Great job!!   Good mix of people. Although the second time I went, I wondered it was pretty empty at first.   Well, another pro is that there's no cover. At least we haven't had to pay cover so far.

The dance floor starts with 80's at 8pm, 90's at 9pm, and so on.  Depending on your age, this means the music either gets progressively better or progressively worse as the night goes on.

This is not the case. I understand since it was NYE you can expect every lounge, bar and club to be crowded but this was based on my perspective prior to the event starting.   Also, the bar tenders were horrible. Many of my friends, including myself, has issues with not only getting our drinks but closing out our tabs. One guy heard me ask him to close out my tab, acknowledged me and then walked away to help out someone else!  In all the confusion my girlfriend and I left our jackets in coat check and realized this the next day. My girlfriend called them and the lady on the other line said she would happily hold them until we can come by next time. She did not specify a time frame. We don't live locally so the next time we returned a week had gone by. I asked the manager for our coats and he said he didn't have them. Essentially, they lost them. I was furious and he offered to compensate me for the loss. When I told him what we paid for my \u00a0P-Coat and my girlfriend's jacket he laughed and said there was no way he would give me that much money. I walked out of their with half of the money that both mine and my girlfriend's coats were worth.   There was no ball drop, no TV's or anything really special about this place given it was an NYE event.   Pros:  -Music -outside smoking area -cover was reasonable for NYE ($25)  Cons:  -Everything else",

The music is deep and soulful, and the crowd is always mellow and friendly. \u00a0Drinks are super cheap (they even do bottle service) and the staff is incredibly attentive and friendly. \u00a0From the security to the bartenders, they are always on top of things. When you are out in SF on a Sat night that turns into Sunday morning, and you don't want the party to end just because the sun is coming up, head to Monroe! It's kept so dark inside you won't even notice the time, and just get lost in the amazing music.",

I can't even remember what songs were being played. All I recall is dancing the night away in a HOT, STUFFY, JAM PACKED place. Another thing, bartenders there are a bit SLOW.

Asparagus flatbread is to die. A must-try.  One of the members of our party tried the Melon d'eau, and while I am typically only a wine drinker, I will be back to have that on a warm summer evening. Refreshing and just the right amount of flawlessly muddled cucumber.  The service is spot-on and not snooty like other highly styled and beautiful lounges around town.

I'm a bit of an adventurous drinker, and I typically gauge a place by blind-boxing my drinks (requesting the bartender's signature cocktail- or to make something based on a mood/flavor notes).

I happen to visit on nights that are a bit unusual, unusual in the sense that it is Sunday morning. \u00a0From 6am-12pm they hold one of the best after hours in the city with some of the best names in the game.   I can say I've been here after a grand all night dance escapade and was able to keep the legs alive long enough to enjoy my time at this space.   The half of the venue they use has a great dance floor and multiple booths and sitting areas to rest and chat with your friends. The sound system is excellent, allowing you to feel the music while being able to carry on a conversation with your friends. If you are like me, you enjoy that time to carry on between a song that grabs you by the hands and sends you to the dance floor.   The cover for Sunday morning's is 10 dollars. They have a patio you can smoke on and seating out there as well. \u00a0BOTH of the bartenders are great! The girl is always smiling and the guy is handsome and polite. Every once and a while you'll see the owner, Nader, helping out as well which speaks so much of the venue and himself.   I enjoy hearing Lisa Rose, Nikita, and other great names in the tech house/techno scene here. It is a refreshing change from the endless house or progressive house you'll hear elsewhere.   If you like after hours, get to Monroe on Sunday morning. You won't regret it!",

The drinks are average here, about $10 a shot. They also have a semi-outdoor smoking area with seats. Although Monroe is relatively small it accommodated a lot of people and had about 3 tables beside the dance floor and also had a private table area.

It was a little hard to find -- I mean, I almost walked right past it until my friend called my name. It was so dark and there were no lines.  Part of the lounge was closed, probably due to lack of people so it became a TINY, TINY lounge. Very small dance floor right in front of the DJ booth and even with the small space, it was still slightly empty! I HATE that the restrooms are downstairs. This is just asking for drunk people to break an ankle. We had bottle service and I remember the waitress frequently disappearing as I was pouring my own drinks for most of the night.  Music is okay; not my type of jam so I can't completely comment on it without being bias. If I ever come back here, I hope the other part of the lounge opens up.",

    "review_text": "Classy decor but lacks class.   A couple of my friends paid in advance to reserve the back section and bottle service for a birthday bash. All of us guests signed up individually onto the party's guestlist ahead of time to ensure Monroe had our names. You would think that because the hosts provided the $$ upfront, they wouldn't have trouble getting into the club, right? UHHHHH, NO.  Everyone was being shooed to the back of the line because, according to \"God\" (aka the bouncer), there were too many private parties scheduled and he didn't care what reservation we were part of. What kind of excuse is that? Why overbook if you can't provide the service? Apparently, Mr. Power Hungry didn't like having his authority questioned and I almost didn't get in that night. Almost.  Finally, after the issue was brought up with the manager, the guests were allowed in. I felt bad for the others in line because security began charging $40 at the door.   The music was mainly house, which got old after 2 hours. Lots of bouncing, not enough dancing.   Interior decor was fabulous though, I must give them credit for that. Deceivingly awesome. Perhaps if we had a smaller group and no reservations were involved, the experience could have been incredible.  In conclusion, this place has potential. Management could use some work and that bouncer needs to get laid.",

If the only \"off\" thing you notice about this place is that there's that random horse portrait, chances are you'd like this place because that horse was the least of my issues lol  Hint: If you get dragged here, there's hope, go a block down towards Impala (don't go in!) and visit the Vin Club. \u00a0Great wine, low key crowd, cool bartenders, and nice vibe.",

    "review_text": "Swankyness on Broadway?!?!? YES SIREE!  To me Broadway is the epitome of ghetto nightlife. It just attracts swarms of rowdy people which is just drama waiting to happen, so I tend to avoid this area. However, after hearing how nice Monroe was, I really wanted to check it out.   Brought to you by the same designer as Gitane (prized as one of the most beautifully designed restaurant in SF) and Chambers Eat + Drink (new restaurant/lounge in TL), Monroe (formerly Dragon Bar) is the swankiest club/lounge that has ever set foot on Broadway...  On Friday, 8.5.11, my friends and I came to Monroe at about 10:40 PM for a party hosted by LevelSF/Synergy.   L I N E  One line for General Admission and Guest List. Though we came a bit later than anticipated, we were still able to make GL. To play it safe, I do suggest coming earlier though if you want to avoid paying cover.   C O V E R *Free if on GL (closed at 11 PM) *$20 General Admission  D R E S S \u00a0C O D E Club attire and dress shoes only (security was strict on this). The crowd was decked out in classy club attire; no ghetto hoochie mama attire here like at neighboring clubs.   C R O W D ASIAN INVASION in their early 20s but only because it was hosted by an Asian promotion company. I've heard on their regular in-house promoter nights, Monroe was a mixed crowd with people in their late 20s. I would definitely come back on their regular nights to check it out again.  M U S I C DJ Clinton Lee was spinning Top 40s, Hip Hop and Mash-Ups that night.  BAR/DRINKS Two bars; one in the main room and a smaller bar in the back room. Top shelf liquor drinks and shots were $10 each plus tax.  The bartenders were friendly, fast, and efficient especially the female brunette at the main bar. After the first round, she already knew our orders from heart.   A M B I A N C E / D E C O R AMAZING! The designer did an impeccable job transforming the previously cheezy Asian inspired Dragon Bar to a swanky lounge/small club that screams C-L-A-S-S! A modern twist to the roaring 20's, Monroe is decked out with custom light fixtures, plushy sofas, rustic brick walls and contemporary flapper paintings.   The main room houses the main bar and a partitioned bottle service area to the left. \u00a0The back room has a small dance floor and one of the most beautiful main bottle service areas I've ever seen. The w-shaped couch is massive and can hold a large party, so if you're throwing a big bash, definitely request bottle service in this area.   There's a small outdoor patio/smoking area with a communal table.   R E S T R O O M S We only stayed for an hour before hitting up Bubble so I didn't get a chance to use the restrooms. But when it was Dragon Bar, there were 2 stalls each for the men and women's restrooms.  P A R K I N G It's a complete nightmare trying to find street parking in the area. Do yourself a favor and just pay $20 to park in the lot 3 doors down next to A3/Atmosphere.  As a 1950's sex symbol, Marilyn Monroe leaves behind a legacy of sultry class, sophistication and simply exudes beauty. Monroe which I assume the lounge is named after is NO different.",

So that was probably the first indication of a soon to be amazing night. The tables were sweet and a little bit higher up so not every single clubber will intrude and get into your space.   Drinks were cheap comparatively to LA clubs (about 10 dollars a drink) The crowd is a little older and per usual a cockfest but HEY we had a fat group of over 50 people so it was still fun.   Music was housey hiphop and this was a saturday night with a mix of hiphop top 40s. Perfect mix so that your mind doesnt explode with too much trance.

And I, too, could also see how a night at Monroe could suck without it. Word to the wise: If you attend a club like this, go all out.   Monroe is a really nice, new, clean club that will most likely be trashed the next time I come back--an inevitability in this city, unfortunately--but right now, it's great. The decor is fancy without being absurd, the bathroom was clean, and the booths are comfortable. Of course, it wasn't without its Line Drama--you know, people claiming they're on the list, people actually on the list, people straying from the queue, bouncers being hard-asses, all that crap that happens at any club in any city--but I learned that if you come by yourself (to join a group inside) it's quite simple to get in! Don't clump together, kids.  Also: the music is loud. Like, don't try to have a conversation. It's pointless. Just take a few shots, enjoy the abstract posters, dance the night away, and try to forget about the fact that the DJ just butchered a Michael Jackson song.

    "review_text": "I came to Monroe on 10/19/12 Friday for my birthday celebration. Most of us arrived before 11 to make the guest list just in case there would be a line. Luckily, there was no line at all. I did get bottle service, but you're only allowed 8 guests per bottle (who are able to come at any time).   I was excited to see the lounge as the pictures on the website are beautiful. &amp; was upset when they closed off half the lounge with curtains. My guess is that it was a slower night so if the whole lounge was open, it'd look empty and may shy away potential patrons.   We had the W couches, and because no one else purchased bottle service in that section it was basically all our space. Plenty of room to sit and lounge around. They played EDM, not really sure how to dance to it so I stayed put at the couches. Our hostess came by every now and then to pour drinks for us. I couldn't find her anywhere when we wanted to order a second bottle. But the security went around and found her so she could finally take our order and allow 4 guests to come in for free after guest list ended. We figured if we buy another bottle, we should be allowed the \"8 guests/bottle rule\" and they obliged.   It wasn't the type of club where you can't breathe or walk around. I like being able to walk through the crowd without getting pushed or my foot stepped on. Although on a random note, I did find it weird that one of the bathroom stalls did not have a door (only two stalls in the bathroom). Other than that we had a great time partying at Monroe.",

    "review_text": "I have never felt so strongly about a place to write a yelp review, so maybe you won't take anything i write to heart, but:  this place was ridiculous. management needs to rethink their policies. four tables reserved and bottle service for 3 peoples' joint birthdays. they were told they had an unlimited guestlist, which had a separate reservation code than the normal guestlist. What's the point when you won't let anyone in?   A group of us, including the bday girl who's card was down for all the tables got there about 11, and initially they were only going to let her in. The rest of us had to wait in line. Eventually they allowed ONLY the girls in, and the boys all had to wait in line. Anyone on our guestlist who wasn't with us at that time had to wait--to the point where half our party just gave up. i had separate friends who managed to get in and were wondering why the entire back section was open. seriously, who do you think you are? be warned anyone who's thinking about buying a table here, either get there early, or expect to be treated no differently than anyone else.  in their defense, it was fun once monroe took the stick out of their ass and let in a few more of our friends. it's pretty swank, and if it weren't for the absolutely stoOPid [lack-of] VIP service we received, i probably would've given it 4 stars.   i think the birthday kids deserve an apology.",

Music was awesome! Top 40/house. Crowd was sophisticated. None of the ghetto-fabNOT you will find next door. The decor was amazing. I thought it was just a bit too dark inside.   Now for bottle service, spent about $375 for one bottle of grey goose. That includes tax plus the 20% percent gratuity I have to include for our server. Which i am going to give - minus 1 star. She was hardly at our table. We pretty much had to pour our own drinks. She was basically MIA 90% of the night. \u00a0My sober friends can attest to that. And if I remember your service. It's either you did really great or you did really bad. So yeah, it was painful \u00a0to give 20% percent gratuity for a server who was barely there. *shrugs*  Other than that the bouncers were nice, it was a breeze getting in. \u00a0I had to put my guests names on the guest list and arrived there around 10:15 so line wasn't long YET.  Overall aside from the shitty server. This place deserves to be in the top lounges in SF to visit. My friends all had a good time",

    "review_text": "I'm going to start off my review by being honest and revealing I might be a little biased, I am a DJ my crew and I have DJed here about 4 or 5 times so I will give more of behind the scenes review.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One of the biggest things I love about this club is the decor, Old Hollywood prohibition type setting with antique looking lighting (while the place is lit up) and awesome pictures/portraits hung up everywhere. Take one look at the gallery on their website, when you show up, you won't be disappointed.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 From a DJ standpoint, the club is great, they have a super nice and clean sound system, people really don't know how big of a deal this is for a club, if they put the time to make sure their sound and DJ gear is top notch, then they obviously pay attention to detail and care about their club (I've spun at another bay area club [I won't name names] where their gear was super ghetto and another DJ admitted that someone probably spilled a beer into one of the turntables). They just got a few new LED lights that really highlight the VIP areas and they have a couple moving LED effects that hit the dancefloor as well. I'd say a few more LED's to highlight the booths and maybe a couple scanners or moving heads would really make this place come to life (not that our music doesn't do that already ;) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0)  \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Drinks! The bartenders/staff I've dealt with are Payam and Ali. Both guys are cool and pour great drinks, the drinks are reasonably priced and it's nice not having to spend 5 minutes leaning across the bar trying to flag down the bartender, they're always really quick and attentive. As far as security guys, they are all really cool/chill, they are NOTHING like a lot of bouncers you will find at other clubs who are dudes on a power trip, one of the nights I was working here, some girl came up to me almost crying because some a-hole spilled a drink on her, I asked on of the security guys to come over, he talked to her, she pointed him out and they kept an eye on him, as soon as he was being belligerent and rude again, whoosh! They booted him, awesome.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Last but not least, the crowd. From the few different events here I've seen an eclectic mix of people, a good mix of mainly 20/30 somethings dressed up, or in nice jeans, and from what I've seen everyone seems very well behaved and non-ghetto compared to so many other establishments, a perfect combination of classy/non snobby/people who don't take themselves too seriously, it's very refreshing. The area is definitely an interesting place to park, as someone who's had my car stolen AND broken into in the last 2 years in SF, I always just drop $20 on the parking lot right across the street. If you stay till close to closing I'd recommend leaving maybe 20 minutes before the place shuts down, I'm usually the closing DJ and I end up being the DD who drives my friends home, I usually don't get to my car until 2:15, and by then it is a MAD HOUSE, tons of drunk crazy people out on the streets at the same time when all the bars close down, I always hate walking to my car/driving away through the crowds, so I would recommend leaving a lil early to avoid the craziness.  All in all Monroe is a newer lounge (they JUST had their 1 year weekend celebration) that is a really good blend of class and fun without the ghetto or pretentiousness of other places and worth checking out!",

The place was pretty small too and can get really crowded quickly as the night goes on. The bar was also decent sized and the bartender was really friendly. She was fun and gave us some great drinks! Also, happy hour lasts until 10 pm.   On this night, the DJ was whack! The music stopped completely on 4 different occasions and the variety was bad. At one point, it was all 90s R&amp;B, then to EDM, then to 70s music. For a crowd that's mostly young adults, the vibe was mixed as some people were liking the music or people were absolutely hating it. This was my first night here so maybe it was a one time thing.  This is a decent lounge. The music wasn't the greatest but I met some fun people and still had a great time! The decor was nice and the drinks were good.

    "review_text": "I had a pretty good time at this venue(due to the overflowing booze), but there were some hiccups with communication along the way. It's stressful planning any party, esp a friend's surprise Bday party. \u00a0I contacted Monroe regarding bottle service on a Thursday and nobody got back to me until the following Tuesday. Even until then, it was extremely difficult getting a hold of my promoter(Rosanna) and nothing was set in stone until 2 days before the party. \u00a0But aside from that, the transaction went relatively smooth.  Now, onto the actual venue. We didn't have any trouble getting in through bottle service although everyone had to individually sign up on the Glist with the bottle service code. Once inside, we were greeted by a cute waitress(too faded to remember her name, sorry), who brought our drinks right away. There was also a wheelchair in front of our table. I thought: \"how thoughtful! It's for the drunk ppl who need to be wheeled out at the end of the night!\" Come to find out, it was for a disabled person next to our table. After a couple of drinks, our table started sitting in the wheelchair and rolling around in it ( including myself). Security guards got angry and took it away. Come on! Why put a wheel chair right IN FRONT of our table and expect drunk ppl to NOT play with it! \u00a0I got a few good wheelies in before they took it away though. ;)  So my friends and I are having a good time- we're drinking, dancing, laughing, talking, taking pics, the normal stuff you do at clubs. The security guard comes over TWICE to tell us to keep it down because we were drawing attention to ourselves. WTF?!?! \u00a0Don't you want people to see that your customers are having a GOOD time so more people will come to your venue?! \u00a0I will never understand the shush thing at a club, maybe the old disabled guy complained? I did see a couple of 70 year olds at this place though.....  Overall, I had a great time,with awesome company. One star for the cute bouncer, one star for the wheelchair, and one star for not losing my shoes. =)  HAPPY BDAY MARZ BARZ!!!",

As we were walking by, we saw a few posters that advertised a Battle of The Decades DJ battle which had the CHEAPEST drink prices I've ever seen for a Friday night. Basically, the drink prices are something like $1 for the 70s and then $2 for the 80s, $3 for the 90s, and it goes up like that every hour. By the time you reach the 'aughts, it's still cheaper than 99% of bars in this city. It was all free so we popped in and had ourselves a hell of a night reliving the decades.  Cheap booze aside, the atmosphere is surprisingly mellow and inviting. Lots of nice people on the Friday night we went. Given the cheap alcohol, you'd expect more drunk people falling all over themselves but everyone appeared to hold their liquor well. Biggest bonus: The bathrooms have more than 1 stall! Bathrooms are my thang and I like to have more than 1 stall as I have a tiny bladder and like to drink a lot so I was thrilled upon entering the bathroom and seeing stalls plural.  Security guards aren't too aggressive, everyone has a spot to dance. The club space is big enough but you won't get lost in it. The crowd was pretty diverse the night I went - it's nice to be in a San Francisco bar/club that isn't just white hipsters or techie nerds Google Glassing all over the damn place (sorry, but you know it's true). It did seem like a lot of out-of-towners but for the most part, people kept to themselves and enjoyed the music and cheap booze.  I'll be back for the 80's!",

Other then this hiccup.. a HUGE hiccup I'd like to add, the place is cool. \u00a0Dance floor, mature adults. \u00a0Just make sure you get sealed bottles when getting table service, I don't even wanna think about the drinks at the bar. \u00a0If they are serving us water downed vodka, I imagine the same at the bar. \u00a0(Eeeek!)  The owner messaged me and in all fairness, this is his message. \u00a0Copy and pasted.   I would appreciate it if you would be truthful in your write up. There is not a two bottle minimum per table. You had two tables but decided to have both bottles on one table. We also did not comp both bottles for you. When there was a complaint about the taste I asked the waitress to switch the bottle out and make sure give you sealed one to prove it was Grey Goose. That is the only reason why it came to you sealed. We always put a pour spout on bottles for guests. The only thing that was comped was a smaller bottle of Grey Goose because I thought you were getting two bottles for one table and we usually discount the second bottle. I did not know you had both brown booths for your group. So to make sure you were getting a discount I comped the third small bottle. I hope I am not getting punished for making sure we give good customer service and being generous. All the actions we took was to make sure our guests were satisfied with their experience. I would appreciate it if you could take that into consideration. If you would like to talk about this directly please do not hesitate to call me.  Nonetheless, still request sealed bottles when receiving table service.",

    "review_text": "Came here on Friday night to celebrate my sister's birthday! We got there at almost 10 and the place had a decent amount of people. Went up to the bar and ordered some drinks. They were very strong. Holy shit. Then we made our way to our table. We had an area roped off for us for bottle service and the set up is pretty nice! Wrap around couches, some tablesand some grehat wall decor. The girl that brought out the bottles was super fun and was great at pumping up everyone and she actually came back to check on us numerous times, which I totally appreciated. She even brought us water constantly. She was great! The club itself was fun! I actually think watching other people dance was more fun. Just imagine all of the world's most awkward dancers all on one dance floor. And they were all white. Like, I don't know how else to describe it. It was just so white. Not necessarily a bad thing, I'm just not used to it. Like imagine a club scene in a disneychannel movie. That was Monroe. It was fun but by 12:45, the club completely died out. Like there were maybe 20-30 people in the club total including our group of 12. So sad it died out so soon, the DJ was actually doing pretty good.  It was a decent experience.",

    "review_text": "I attended the Grand Opening party with free cocktails and passed appetizers. It was a really nice party. \u00a0I like the vibe of this place.   The cocktails were really nice, but the bartenders were a little slow. It was opening night and it wasn't crowded, so I'm not sure what the deal was. Apparently they kept running out of the batches of ingredients they had prepared. It's okay; I'm sure they will get quicker. The bartenders were nice!  The appetizers were nice, but the servers weren't. They were a little rude and they kept dodging people, stepping on toes and throwing 'bows. I'm not sure if these ladies were bar staff or hired help for the night, but I overheard many different groups of people complaining about them. I surely hope they aren't affiliated with the bar. They were definitely the sour note of the night. \u00a0  The decor was definitely the highlight! It is really nice! This place has a classy old Hollywood meets 50's pin-up feel. I love the portraits on the curtains that adorn the walls. There's also giant round booths that easily fit 8 people, which I'd have to see how they translate on a crowded night. There didn't seem to be much other seating besides the big booths. You'll definitely get to know your booth mates if you come in a small group.   There's a nice semi-private, elevated area with a few booths and tables by the DJ booth. This area would be ideal for a party!   There's also a covered, outdoor smoking patio with outdoors heaters. My friends enjoyed this patio; it was a little too smoky for me though. It sits on the street which makes for excellent people watching while you chill out for a sec.   I met one of the owners, and she was really nice as well. I wish them the best of luck on their new venture! I'll have to return to see what the ambiance and crowd is like on regular night.",

Me along with my two guests were the only ones in the joint. This made our exprience very one on one with the place as well as with the bartender. The Bartender helped me choose what was good, and also gave me a taste of some of the wines.   I loved the decor, absolutely chic. Will go back ASAP!",

Food took forever to come out (we just got a flatbread) and they seemed to be out of a lot of wines we asked for. The bartender was a bit standoff-ish at first and eventually warmed up. We ended up spending entirely too much money for what we got. Oh, and there were way too many creepy/sketchy potential strip club owners/goers that stopped in.  I will say the decor is awesome. That's about it.",
