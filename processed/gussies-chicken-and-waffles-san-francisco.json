Of course, I got the chicken and waffles. \u00a0Though I will say I was strongly tempted by the lunch buffet. \u00a0The chicken was perfect. \u00a0Cripsy and crunchy. \u00a0This breading stuck to the meat. \u00a0The chicken itself was still juicy in all the right ways. \u00a0Such heaven. \u00a0The two waffles to the side were no small fries. \u00a0Generous amounts of butter were provided. \u00a0The pair were not equal; the chicken was far superior. \u00a0However, as a combined plate the dish rocked my world. \u00a0Like I left with my hair all messed up and my clothes ruffled. \u00a0  Some pointers: come with good company because you will spend a lot of time chit chatting. \u00a0Or if you come solo (which I would not be opposed to), bring a book or an ipad (we are in SF).",

    "review_text": "Let me say first, THAT I THOUGHT THE FOOD WAS GREAT. No complaints there. Yum.   The SERVICE was terrible. Seriously, really, really bad. All 4 times I have been there, for breakfast, lunch and dinner. In other words, bad service seems to be the theme here. Every time I go, I wait....and wait....and wait. The staff is not busy at these times, because I see them hanging out by the kitchen, shooting the breeze with their friends etc. Each time, after 20 minutes of sitting and not getting any sort of greeting at all, I have had to get up and hunt down menus myself. Then, we usually go and find a server after another 15 minutes of no one taking the order. Then, usually a portion of the order gets forgotten, like the case of our drinks 1 time, or messed up, like the time our appetizer arrived after our dinner as we were asking for the check, and no I am not exaggerating. The first time this happened, I thought it was a fluke, but, after multiple instances of the same bad service, it's about to drive me away, no matter how good the food is. The staff is very nice, when they arrive, or maybe I should say if they arrive, at the table. Last time I was there, while I was waiting for my beer that never arrived, I heard the waitress talking to a patron about how the reason they don't have many regulars is because they think they should expand their menu options. Well, I can tell you why you don't have many regulars. People get sick and tired of not being served at a restaurant in a competent, efficient and timely manner. \u00a0Bad service = less repeat business. I hope the manager/owner of Gussie's is reading this. I would love to go back if this was fixed",

The decor is bland, the lights are on way too bright, the furniture is off the shelf IKEA-looking crap, and the silverware is pathetic. I actually have no problem with any of these details if everything on the menu was about 20% cheaper.  The service was also confused. The host's stand at the front was abandoned, so that was awkward. After a few minutes, a server noticed the confusion and managed to get a table. A different server swung by almost immediately to take drink orders. Suggestion: if the patrons haven't even sat down or taken off their jackets, they probably haven't had a chance to look at the menu. Relax. Then he comes back, and puts his hand on the back of one of our chairs. I get you're trying to be friendly, but that is a little bit creepy.  From there on, smooth sailing. The food was good. Nothing mind-blowing, but all very flavorful.  This would be a terrible place to bring a date, parents, or a friend visiting from out of town if you're looking to impress, but great for a big ass group looking to have fun and be loud if they don't care about having a gourmet meal.",

Fried Chicken: Thin breading. \u00a0The dark meat was fine, but the breast was a little dry. \u00a0Perfectly enjoyable when it's covered in some combination of syrup, butter, Crystal hot sauce and/or gravy.  Waffles: Thin and made to order. \u00a0Looks like large eggos. \u00a0None of that highfalutin Belgian wafel nonsense. \u00a0Also tasty when doused with sauces.  Gravy: A bit overpowering so don't dip all of your chicken in this. \u00a0Probably amazing with a biscuit. \u00a0Use sparingly so you don't hide the sweet side of things coming from other flavors.  Baked Mac &amp; Cheese: Not baked to order, probably take from a large tray in the kitchen. \u00a0Lots of cheddar cheese chunks. \u00a0Hard to compete with all the artisan mac &amp; cheese around town, but comforting.",

The chicken is, as stated in my previous review of the buffet, tender but not quite seasoned well enough to cover up that gamey chicken flavor. The waffles were very soft to begin with which means they quickly became soggy with the addition of butter and brown sugar sauce. But oh my lord. The brown sugar sauce - this stuff is heaven!! My sister commented on how I'd disproportionately devoured almost the whole portion given to us, it tasted good on everything! We also had the sweet potato tots which came out piping hot and savory with a chipotle dipping sauce, though I can't say they were anything special. Honestly, the presence of sweet potatoes and that brown sugar sauce just made me long wistfully for Gussie's candied yams...  Bottom line? The buffet is most worth it because 1) you get your full fix of fried chicken 2) the sides (candied yams and beans in particular) are that good. You won't miss much skipping the waffles.",

Pair it with some mac n cheese, some collard greens -- no wonder I don't fit in my jeans! Throw in some waffles and gravy? No one can save me!!   Really though, ever since Roscoe's I've been obsessed. So how happy was I when I heard that Gussie's was opening? So what better way to spend my birthday then going to Gussie's on their scheduled opening day!!? So how bummed was I to find out that they weren't open yet. After three more MISERABLE FAILED attempts to go eat there, I finally made it.   Gussie's has a nice interior, a bit fancier than I had expected. We came during their happy hour (4pm-7:30pm M-F), which mean cheaper drinks and half off appetizers! We ordered the 1/2 chicken with dark meat and two waffles, fried chicken livers, and fried cheese grits. Fried chicken livers tasted like fried chicken livers...if you're a fan of liver, it's pretty tasty. The fried cheese grits were like..fried polenta. I kind of wish they had regular grits on their menu instead. The 1/2 chicken with dark meat came out with one leg and one breast. What?? Breast isn't dark meat. Apparently, despite the menu saying you can choose between dark and white meat, the 1/2 chicken can only come with both. Luckily, our waiter was nice and gave me a couple complimentary fried chicken legs.The chicken was...disappointing. Even the dark meat was dry and reminded me very much of white meat and why I tend not to like white meat. The waffle was soft and a little sweet even without syrup on it. Dipping the chicken in the side of gravy we ordered was a necessity. Maybe I went on an off night, since I've heard compliments for their chicken, but when I need a fried chicken fix, it probably won't be here. Even my love of fried chicken with waffles won't save them.",

I go here because I have hope for new businesses &amp; new culture. &amp; when the right person is cooking and the food hasn't been sitting it is a delight.   The other day I went there our waitress took our order almost immediately, we knew what we wanted. We always get the something \"Fillmore Classic\" -three wings, one or two waffles , with two eggs. We ordered our good at 1:04. As 20 minutes went by I asked a short black women \" hey excuse me, it's been 20 mins\" she said \" I'm sure it's coming right out\" she didn't check with the back. &amp; when she did go to the back she never came bk to the table to assure us the food was coming. Another 11 mins went by &amp; they brought out eggs out ... Very small portion it looked like 1 egg &amp; mounds of cheese. A min or two later the rest of our food came out. My waffle was burnt, being that the food took so long I just ate it. The eggs weren't edible it was way too much cheese, so I kindly told her could she just give my little sister eggs with no cheese &amp; she had the biggest attitude , &amp; just took the eggs without apologizing or even looking at me. As soon as we were done , she got a boost of energy and was smiling and being polite, obviously because it was time for her tip. I live within walking distance and probably will never return",

    "review_text": "Can Catch-22's exist around something so positive as Gussie's? I mean, does an embarrassment of riches really present a rock-and-a-hard-place situation? Like my current dilemma with Gussie'ss: I'd love to include more people in on the fun so that we can share some items and then maybe we'd get to actually save room for dessert and try the red velvet cake. But that means I'd have less chicken, waffles and sides in my belly...  I'm going to blame life for this one, for making the human stomach so ill-equipped to handle obscene amounts of Gussie's grub. Because this connundrum isn't from a lack of trying. Y. and I packed it down, tried our best to eat as much as humanly possible. Ordered a half-chicken, two-waffle combo with none of the fancy fixin's (no sweet potato waffle, no real maple syrup-- just brown sugar and vanillin will do for us, thanks much) and a side sampler of mac-n-cheese, collard greens, candied yams and corn. And with relish (the feeling, not the condiment; I know chicken and waffles embodies the sweet-and-savory feeling but that would just have been over the top) we did.  And what genius came up with such a resplendent idea? Though I was disappointed with my first experience at a Roscoe's about five years ago, I still had faith in the idea because how could a marriage between a chicken and breakfast batter not make sense to a dirty food heathen like me? The chicken was juicy, the coating crisp. The chicken wasn't as deviled as the Colonel would do and so the flavors weren't as assertive as I would have liked against the sweetness of the syrupy waffle, but the meat was tender and palatable.   I know most would be completely satisfied with two pieces of chicken and a waffle, but you'd be committing a sin against the self if you didn't get some of their offerings on the side. Candied yams were toothache/coma-inducing sweet, but had the warm flavorings of cinnamon and clove to still make it endearing. The sweetness was toned down when paired with the greens, which are cooked to tender perfection with whole leaves staying intact and so complex in its tangy, bitter flavor. If I had to choose between the greens and the mac-n-cheese, I'd be Sophie all up in here because the mac-n-cheese is the best I've ever tried of its kind. It's simple and you can really taste the pasta and the milky mildness of the cheese, which striiiiiiiiings when you try to lift up a forkful from the bowl.  The only negative that wasn't self-inflicted (damn stomach and its capacity) was the service. Our server was snarky and inattentive, never refilling the waters or stopping by to check in. Which is actually not that big of a deal-- it would have been embarrassing to expose someone to the ravenous wolfing and moaning that was going on at our table. But the fool had the audacity to recommend corn to us, advice that we in turn foolishly followed, only to meet a bowl of boiled corn, unseasoned, unadorned (actually tasted like reversal of seasoning with the flavor of the corn extracted out in the cooking process) with any flavor except for some finely-diced red bell peppers. Come on, dude. steamed. corn? I'm getting the black-eyed peas next time.",

We ordered a round of hurricanes for the three of us. After an hour, he brought out two. Not three. The third one never appeared, though we asked about it three times.   When our food finally arrived, my order was wrong, but at that point I was afraid to send it back. The chicken looked like it had been sitting out awhile. Our biscuits never came. The portions of mac and cheese were small. And all around, the food was not worth the wait.  The waiter never checked in on us, or volunteered explanations about what was happening. When we inquired, he claimed that our drinks were late because they ran out of glasses (perhaps plausible), and that our food was late because they didn't have enough waffle irons. I hear they sell those at Target. Maybe pick up a few, seeing as how the name of the restaurant includes the word \"waffles\".  And then, at the end of the night, I asked them to break a 20, and they claimed they were unable to. They had been open all night, but still had no change at all? I will never, ever come back here. I wish I could rate them lower.",

They are very close to being a five star restaurant that they deserve to be. They still need to get some kinks out of the way. They need to ease up on the salt with the collard greens, refill the waters periodically, check up on us every now and then, and maybe lower the price a tad and this will be IT. The ideal restaurant in the FILL MO!!!   I've been to many soul food restaurants and this place definitely have soul............I am a Chinese guy telling you!!!......... that this place have soul. I can feel you!!!   Everything is great about this place. They just need to get the new appliances broken in before you get that brown, crisp seasoned brown waffle fries, or that seasoned chicken wings/thighs/breast. They will have it soon..........I promise you that. You just need time to marinade that deep fat fryer and all of that love will come out. I would probably give them another 1 to 2 months before they come out with some quality food in which I know they can.   Their corn bread is fantastic, candy yams are good and not too sweet, mac and cheese...........will be great if they only bake them a little bit longer to get that crisp layer on top. Waffles are great........they just need to get that crispy, crunchy texture to it and this place will rock. The fried catfish and fried okra were good. \u00a0I am not a fan of the fried okra but they were actually ok. \u00a0If only the fryer was just a little more \"seasoned\" both the fried catfish and okra would have that perfect color and texture.  Chicken and waffles...............you guys are so money that you don't even know how good you guys are. Work on the kinks ....fix it.......and when I come back...............you guys are definitely getting a 5 star review.",

Okay, so I came here with a group of ten people for dinner. The hostess told us that since there was already a big group inside, we would have to wait until they're done. So we waited for almost and an hour, but she told us that they just added a few people to their table. We figured that since we've already wasted that hour waiting, might as well wait some more. We even told her that if it was easier, she can just split us up in different tables. That didn't happen. We still had to wait. After a FRICKIN HOUR AN A HALF we were FINALLY seated. And let me tell you what frustrated me most. The room was a fairly big size. There were many many open tables and the place was not at all busy! I don't understand why they had to make us wait SO LONG for one group, when they can just pull other tables together and arrange the seating in another area. It really is doable considering the space and amount of table they had. Ghhrr It just made me mad thinking about how long we waited! The food didn't even make up for it either.  The portions were small and weren't worth the price. I ordered the Fillmore which included chicken wings, waffles, and eggs. It was okay. There was nothing special about it at all.   In terms of the waiter's service, there was nothing spectacular about it either. He was hard to get a hold of whenever we needed him. They all didn't look that motivated or enthusiastic, it seems.   Environment wise, they had loud live music playing which was very unpleasant.  Honestly, I wanted to tip them .01 cent to show how much I didn't like the service and the place, but they charged for gratuity. I know it's the rule but to make us wait THAT long AND charge for gratuity seems unjust. They could have compensated us at the very least. Now I know where in SF to never go again.",

    "review_text": "First impression of Gussie's: an upscale Roscoe's serving up more than just chicken and waffles.   This was our first visit here so natch we felt the need to sample different items on the menu. The Taste of the South is a good way to try everything and it's easily good enough for two people to share. It comes with 1/4 fried chicken, honey cornbread, candied yams, and collard greens. I'm not big on greens so I asked to sub even more carbs - smothered potatoes. I would rate everything on this plate 3.5 stars. While everything was pretty tasty, the gravy on the potatoes was a little too salty as was the fried chicken. The candied yams were good too but a little on the sweet side since it was covered in syrup. We also ordered a fried chicken and waffle plate. Same with the fried chicken and the waffle was a bit soggy. It came with scrambled eggs which we never received.   A southern meal would not be complete without sweet tea. Gussie's isn't bad but I kept tasting a plastic after taste. Not sure if it was because it was sitting in plastic containers in the back or maybe that was just their syrup that they use to sweeten it.   This review would really be 3.5 stars since the saltiness of the food was a little overbearing. But I'm going to round up because the star at Gussie's isn't the chicken or the waffles. It's the Cheddar Cheese Grit Cakes. This might be the sole reason I dine here again. These cakes are delicious! Combining the softness of the grits, crunch of the breading, slight tang of the cheese, added flavor of the green onion, and savoriness of the dipping sauce, this appetizer is a sure fire winner!  Overall, I'd probably dine here again but stick to the grit cakes and maybe a side of something else.",

Our meal came out a bit slow (about 45 mins to be exact) when they were not overly busy. When we asked the waiter for an update on our food, she advised us that our chicken was ready, they were just waiting for the waffles. So that means they make the waffles per each order. I did want to try their red velvet waffles but they were out of the cream cheese butter.. :(  I had a Gilt City offer for this place and it was super worth it. Overall this place has yummy soul food in SF.  We got: -Quarter fired chicken &amp; 2 waffles (dark meat) -Fillmore Classic: 3 fried chicken wings &amp; a waffle",

What do I look, Ernest... uh... Criton... way...? Fine...  Let's say that you don't FEEL like making chicken and waffles at home. Decent waffle makers are only about $20 (like the nifty one I got from Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond), but you can't be bothered with measuring flour and dosing out the log cabin fake maple syrup yourself. Nor do you want to fry your own chicken (or alternatively hitting up Popeye's for a 2 piece.) Okay, I get that. You want convenience. Savory, sweet, gut-busting convenience. If you're in the San Francisco bay are, I would tell you to hit up Gussie's... and also Hard Knox's, but that'll be a seperate review...  Anyhow, these people got it right! The waffles and chicken here, in my opinion, is the closest you'll get to the same goodness you can get at Roscoe's down in socal. The waffles have the same rich, sweet, just right sort of consistency/mouthfeel. They just melt in your mouth. And oh goodness, please PLEASE order the sweet potato waffle. I'm not quite sure how they make it, but it is DIVINE. Their homemade brown sugar syrup just takes the cake. The fried chicken itself is just on point. Crispy and with just enough flavor. Oh so good when it's still hot. I like mine smothered with the gravy and some Crystal hot sauce. Oh man, these are some next level eats for sure.  The service? It's great. Servers are more than friendly and super helpful. They get your orders out with no muss and no fuss. Absolutely no complaints about the service here. They've got that down pack.  After being disappointed in the chicken in waffles in Oakland, i'm happy to say that there is yet still a place you can head to here in the bay for awesome chicken and waffles. Gussie's man, I love this place.",

You can serve yourself and not have to wait for the staff.  The chicken is moist and tender and tasty; the sweet potato waffle is very tasty and it comes with a big scoop of real butter. Butter, one of my main food groups. The biscuit and gravy is also excellent, this said by someone who has a long line of biscuits and gravy in her pedigree.",

The fish was tender and steamy in the middle, good stuff! The waffles were good at the beginning then toward the end I understood what people were saying by being a bit chewy. The chewy part didn't bother me too much it was the overwellming sweetness in the batter and nutmeg? Some spice was very strong in it. Chicken was good to me, with some hotsauce it was all good! I saw my friend's white meat and it looked dry, but she said it was very tasty. I will go back, but next time no waffle for me. I want to try the fried grits and uhh I saw waffle fries!! One more thing, the servers are very nice but our server, you really need to learn to stay in the front of the place and STOP hanging in the back.

With an upgrade $2 for red velvet pancakes. Now I've never been here before, we when I got my plate, I thought the cream piled on my waffle was butter, I had to ask for maple syrup. Our waiter looked at us, and asked with bulging eyes, 'you want syrup too?!\" BEWARE! That pile of cream, is actually frosting. LOL we spread it on, and then poured syrup on top of it. Thankfully I went light on the syrup, or else it would've just been dessert. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. Whooo! Not just your regular buttermilk milk chicken tossed in some flour and fried.  I also order the Mac &amp; Cheese. Totally recommended! It goes well with the chicken!  No room for dessert, next time, I'm saving room for some :)",

However- no matter how much fried yumminess is present.. customer service is always tops in my book. That being said... Lets get down to it.   Service:: Maybe they were just super busy.. (but it didnt look like it) and it was past brunch time on a Sunday. Im not sure who our server was.. it appeared to be a team effort situation. The problem with that: there was a lot of miscommunication. I never received something I ordered- after asking two different people for it. The check took forever to come, to go, and to return. Maybe ive been out of the south too long.. i know life is a lot slower down there.. but this was a bit much.   Ambiance:: This place is not exactly SanFrancisco chic. But for me.. that can be a good thing. It reminds me of the places back home in the south. Its clean and the food is good. Aint nobody got time to worry about ambiance.   Food:: Well.. the food gets all the stars at Gussie's. Lets be honest- everything is fried and everything fried is good. The chicken is perfect (white or dark), the waffles are damn good (they better be, right?) and all the sides we tried were authentic and southern (homefries, collard greens, mac and cheese). Southern comfort with a side of homefries- thats whats up.  I will definitely go back- because the food is legit. But I probably wont be back on a Sunday.",

    "review_text": "I put off giving this spot a good review after the first couple times I ate here due to procrastination. So sadly for Gussies, now that I finally found time, my review will be based off the horrible service we received today. It was packed today given it was a weekend and also a holiday but they only had what seemed to be just 2-3 waitresses on the floor. Our waitress sat us down and didn't bother to ask us if we wanted drinks and didn't return to check on us til about 15 minutes later--not that big a deal to me but I'm just getting started. After taking our orders without writing it down (don't know how she'd be able to remember that many orders with a packed house) she came back with just 2 out of the 3 coffees we ordered. She said they were making a new pot--that's understandable but with no cream or spoons given, we just sat there watching our coffees get cold. It took about another 10-15 minutes before we were able to get a hold of a different waitress to help us. Another 5 minutes passed and yet no 3rd cup of coffee was brought to us. \u00a0Then I overheard a table next to us complain to what seemed to be the supervisor that their food came out cold and something else unclear and she sincerely apologized. That's when I decided we weren't going to wait anymore. After 40 minutes of waiting, all we got was 2 cups of coffee and she never bothered to come back and check on us. As we got up to leave, I wanted to at least be courteous and let the waitress know that we were leaving so she could cancel our orders but she saw us get up and put our jackets on and just looked away like she couldn't care less so we left 5 bucks on the table and left without saying anything.  I've never had to do that before and I never want to have to do that again.  I love Gussies for their location, cleanliness, and of course, their food. Gussies food is worth at least 4 stars. The fried chicken and waffle are absolutely delicious. I love their moist and flavorful chicken and crisp waffle served with warmed syrup. Their \"taste of the south\" dish is what I would recommend--fried chicken served with collard greens, baked mac'n'cheese, and cornbread. Their chicken gumbo which is not always available is also a must-try. The quality of their food seems to stay consistent but I can't say the same for the wait staff. I'd have to rate their service at average a 2.   If you do plan on coming here, I do suggest going on a slow night as in during the weekdays and def not on a holiday.  I really wanted to love you Gussies but I won't be coming back until you guys clean up your wait staff.",

What is the point then? Just serve me chicken 'n pancakes! You add some syrup and these waffles are just a soggy mess.  Luckily, the batter on their fried chicken is tasty. Yes, I would but it slightly above Popeye's, since the syrup here is also very good with strong sweet potato flavor.",

The chicken is juicy and the sweet potatoes waffles will blow your mind! The candied yams are AMAZING along with their homemade cornbread!

    "review_text": "Just because a place advertises chicken and waffles doesn't mean that they can really do \"Chicken and Waffles\". I mean I can go to Popeye's, buy some fried chicken without the sides, and then head over to Safeway to get a box of Eggos and a bottle of Aunt Jemima. There ya go... \"Chicken and Waffles\". Gussie does a little better job than that, although don't knock Popeye's...it isn't that bad an alternative before a deafening concert at the Fillmore. Just don't stand downwind from me, while I do the \"Reflex\" with Duran Duran.  However, on the pantheon of great Chicken and Waffles establishments, Gussie's is really just on the waiting list without a reservation. For those of you who have been lucky enough to try Sylvia's in Harlem (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/sylvias-restaurant-new-york#hrid:wrMk0UF8kpwwWGIFahCApg/src:self\">yelp.com/biz/sylvias-res\u2026</a>) or just sauntered across the bay to Tanya Holland's Brown Sugar Kitchen (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/brown-sugar-kitchen-oakland#hrid:aQqxGZ8zGHVNZespPrcHow/src:self\">yelp.com/biz/brown-sugar\u2026</a>) will probably feel the same way I do...a big, resounding meh. I went for the $12.59 Country Cornmeal Waffles with 2-Pieces of Fried Chicken (see my photo) for the express purpose of comparing Gussie's cornmeal waffle with the exceptional one I just had at Brown Sugar Kitchen.  Gussie's consisted of two rounds that looked like they came right out of a Proctor-Silex waffle iron bought at Costco. The texture was pure Eggo - chewy and not quite hot enough even with the slab of butter melting on top - and the portion just too much for the amount of carbs on the plate already. The fried chicken was decent, but since I went for a leg and thigh, kinda paltry for a serving. Jamie W. had a similarly lackluster response to his combo, though he was smart enough to go for a breast.  We shared a $3.50 side of the Country Fried Okra which came with a red pepper remoulade (see my photo). Again, it tasted like it was machine-cut and dumped in an industrial-sized fryer. I was looking for something more rustic, more Gussie-like, but found something closer to packaged. I have no complaints about the attentive service, although the IHOP vibe made me feel I was part of the suburban sprawl. Gussie's took over where Powell's Place was between closures, so she continues the Southern-fried spirit of the food here. It certainly feels like the right neighborhood for Chicken and Waffles, but I just wish I wanted to come running to Gussie like that awful \"Bodyguard\" video where Whitney Houston is jogging in the clouds in her toga.  FOOD - 3 stars...chicken and waffles, not CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! AMBIANCE - 3 stars...IHOP...where's the six-pack of syrups? SERVICE - 4 stars...very friendly...this part they do right TOTAL - 3 stars...if Brown Sugar Kitchen is closed and you aren't flying to NYC soon for Sylvia's, well, here you go",

To date, Gussie's is the first soul food restaurant I've found that serves this exact combination without having to add any extra sides. It's perfect. It's called the \"Taste of the South\". I think my excitement about the fact that this combo-made-in-heaven existed may have clouded my judgment, but overall, it was a tasty meal and I was super full when I left.   Granted, there were a few strange things that happened at Gussie's. The floors were slippery and our waiter(s) were a little strange and there were frames on the wall with no art in them, but hey, we're judging food here and Gussie's gets that right! Four stars, final answer! I can dig it!",

However, it is sort of hard to beat this magical combination so I do find myself going back from time to time (especially since I live just down the street).  I always get the Uptown Special ($9.49) - one honkin' big chicken breast and one waffle. My favorite thing is the gigantic ball of butter on the waffle. The brown sugar syrup is tasty. The chicken tends to be a bit dry but strangely, I sort of like it that way (my friend keeps telling me to eat the chicken, waffle and syrup all together in one bite but like a two year old, I like my foods separate). The waffle is thin but I also like that well enough. I've been to their two dollar Tuesdays - two big wings for $2 - and that's pretty good too. The seasoning on the chicken is what's really great - nice and crispy and salty. We tried the sweet potato fries and they were crispy on the outside, soft on the outside, though not as sweet-potatoey as Harry's, but still good, and cut in fun mini-waffle shapes.  I've never had collard greens before so thought I would give them a try. Egads. Is this what collard greens taste like? They were horrible, but maybe I just don't like the taste of this particular vegetable.   The service is passable (she brought out two chicken and waffle plates when we only ordered one to share - we sent the second one back; the sweet potato fries didn't arrive till we were done everything else - but this was on a very busy night during a neighborhood event). I don't usually get too bothered by service unless it's REALLY bad, which it is not here.  Yup - Gussie's. I'll be back soon for their strangely addicting chicken.",

The 6 pieces of wings and drumsticks for $7 was delicous. Moist and tasty with great seasoning and a thin, battered crust. \u00a0Puts the nearby Popeye's fried chicken to shame. \u00a0If I wasn't so full (yes, I did share w/hubby) from the seafood gumbo I had earlier from another food vendor, I would've eaten more. \u00a0Married with a healthy sprinkling of hot sauce (they have it on the table by the napkins), the flavor of the chicken expoded.

Get your waffle fry fix. Or a generous side salad.  Latter is their signature cobbler. Peaches. Brown sugar. Nutmeg. Vanilla. Wonderful.  Next smart move is all yours.",

    "review_text": "This is quite possibly the closest thing to Roscoes up North. The \"uptown special\" is the equivalent to the \"Carol C special\" I always get when in Socal (one chicken breast + one waffle). I was a little disappointed there wasn't a sunrise/sunset variant on the menu but the sweet tea w/ lemon was damn good. The maple syrup was very much on the cinammon side - the verdict is still out on that one. My friend ordered a side of fries expecting a smidgen of tators but instead got a serving and a half of the waffle cut kind (which I absolutely hogged on, oh well). The waffle itself had the same thin and soft/fluffy consistency as Roscoes. But the true test is taking a bite of it naked, ie no butter, no syrup. This is where Roscoes sets itself apart from others. There, I can devour an entire waffle butt booty naked but at Gussies it was a bit bland and definitely needed the assistance of syrup.   They are open til midnight on weekends which was nice since we didn't show up til 11.   All in all, very good but not quite the Big \"R\". But this beats driving 300 miles that's for sure.",

I was pleasantly surprised that it had a very inviting environment and a DJ on-site! I, later, found out that the DJ comes on Fridays for their Friday night buffet from 7pm to 11pm. $10 for the buffet and cocktails; pretty good deal!  Well, we didn't go for the buffet, but my party and I went for their entrees. I went for their Southern Fried Chicken and Grits. Grits are something that I'm getting a liking of and Gussie's does them well! By itself, the grits are creamy and buttery! With the chicken, it's amazing good! It was definitely helpful in balancing the flavors from the crispy chicken. The only thing that I would change in my order is to opt for dark meat versus light. The chicken breast that I got was dry and the grits didn't help with the dryness. Everyone else got something similar with fried chicken and I got a taste of their waffles, which was good especially with the chicken! Sweet and salty goodness!  The overall experience was great and the DJ played some great tunes to keep the mood going! It might have been a little loud, but that would have been an issue if you were to be seated close to the speakers. Other than that, it was fun! The waiting staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full and our server had great recommendations for our drinks! Great place for chicken and waffles in a comfortable and fun environment!",

We all ordered different items off the chicken and waffle menu - Downtown Special, Fillmore, Southern Comfort... everyone was happy with their choices. The waffle is a bit different though. Very thin and well, not as satisfying. And the maple syrup is a bit different too. Very watery and well, weird.   Service was ok.

Perfect!! The waffle: just ok. Not as fluffy as I expected it to be. \u00a0I have a recipe for sourdough waffles that is the most amazing, so maybe I am a bit biased there. \u00a0But then there is the syrup, the brown sugar syrup, that brings it all together. \u00a0I used the syrup on the chicken and the waffle. \u00a0The syrup is definitely addictive. \u00a0Had a good strawberry lemonade to wash it all down. \u00a0Reasonable priced too, for under $10, perfect meal for breakfast or lunch. First time I went was in April, been there 3-4 times since. \u00a0Always get the same thing, so I can't comment on other parts of the menu. But if you are seeking chicken and waffles, come here.

Their chicken had too much batter and was overly fried. The inside was okay, but the outside was more chewy than crispy.  -WAFFLES - 1/5 Um.. these were just plain sad. I've never had waffles that were so thin, soft and flimsy. And completely tasteless.  -MAC AND CHEESE - 2.5/5 Just okay, nothing special.  -HONEY CORNBREAD - 4.5/5 Pretty much the only saving grace. These were SO GOOD. Super moist and sweet. Definitely really buttery but I couldn't stop eating them!  -SWEET POTATO TOTS - 3/5 I love sweet potato tots, but these were rather disappointing. They tasted fine, but they were really soft. No crunch or crispness to the outside at all. Still okay though.  -COUNTRY FRIED OKRA - 1.5/5 Like the sweet potato tots, these had no crispness. Basically just soft okra coated in a soft, greasy layer of batter.",

However, the yams were off the hook and quite yummy.   Gussie's has a reputation for slow service, and although I didn't see that first hand, the place does have the \"air' of slowness in the kitchen. lol   As a matter of fact, don't get your heart set on what you see on the menu. Often we were told the by the waitstaff that certain items on the menu were not available.   We were completely blindsided when we ordered the RED VELVET cake for dessert and were told it was not avaiable becausethe cook JUST put the cake into the oven!?!?!?   WTF?!?!?   That's like going to Dreyers Ice Cream in the middle of the day and having them tell you they don't have any ice cream because they just started making it. LOL",

    "review_text": "I had a groupon for Gussie's Chicken and Waffles.  Initially, I wanted the buffet because how can you go wrong with AYCE?  So we walked in and decided to check out the buffet. First of all, it was around 1:30-2pm in the afternoon and the lighting was poor. We could barely see the food in the buffet, it was dark. I couldn't tell what it was. We just had to seat ourselves and once we were seated, someone came back with our menus. We decided not to do the buffet.  We just ordered off the menu. We wanted to try the red velvet waffles and fried chicken, so your typical chicken and waffles but instead of the simple plain waffles, we asked for red velvet waffles! You can do a chicken and waffle, and substitute red velvet waffles instead for a little extra charge. We also wanted to try some sides, so we tried the mac and cheese, collard greens, smothered potatoes, and beans and rice. We also had a side of honey corn bread.   The chicken and waffles came, and we asked for a side of syrup. They charge you extra for maple syrup, but we just got brown sugar syrup. It's still delicious and sweet! I really LOVE the cream cheese butter, it's so good. It reminds me of cream cheese frosting but obviously, not as fluffy as frosting. I love the flavor. When you smothered the waffle in the butter, it's good! However, the red velvet flavor in the waffle was very subtle and not obvious. I think the fried chicken was crispy and not too salty or anything. It was good.  Out of all the sides, I really like the collard greens and mac and cheese. The honey corn bread was so good. Whenever you put honey on corn bread, it melts in your mouth - full of yummy flavors. I wasn't a big fan of the smothered potatoes, it was just gravy and potatoes, and it seemed bleh to me.   One thing that stood out to me about this place was the appearance on the outside. It looked a LOT nicer than I expected for some reason, I thought it'll be more of a hole in the wall. It looks nice and professional outside, it doesn't look like a mom and pop shop.",

Two of us ordered the sweet potato waffles with fried chicken. \u00a0The sweet potato waffles were soft, but I think this is normal due to the batter. \u00a0They tasted amazing, spiced and sweetened just right. \u00a0The fried chicken was juicy, with a light crispy skin on the outside.

My sister ordered the red velvet waffles and a drumstick + a side of mac and cheese. We also ordered a vanilla milkshake to split. 10 minutes after I ordered the waitress comes out and asked if I wanted the three piece wing or the two piece leg and thigh.   After half an hour of waiting .. we still had no food and no shake. We figured if we have no food at least give us our shake .. but nope .. we got nothing. When the waitress checked in on us to tell us that our food will be out any minute, we asked about our shake. She said she thought we got it .. .. so she went to check. Minutes later the waitress said they were having problems with our waffles and that she has her milkshake expert whipping up our drinks.   When our food finally arrives ... \u00a0it was my sister's one drumstick and our tiny mac and cheese. \u00a0After we literally killed the chicken and side the rest of our food gets here. Now it wasn't all bad .. the mac and cheese was good .. but a tad too oily. My waffles were okay, nothing to rave about. The chicken was the same, decent. By this time we've been here for an hour .. I wish I was joking. My sister's red velvet waffles were yummy. We got our shakes after we finished eating.   That was seriously unacceptable .. they tried to compensate by making us two vanilla shakes instead of one to split. By this time we were already full, tired of waiting/cranky, and my sister was late for work.   A quick food recap. The red velvet waffles were good. Country cornmeal waffles and chicken were okay. Mac and cheese side was small, oily, but good. The vanilla milkshake was good but this meal was not worth the wait.",

Strangely enough, I don't go there that often. It's not a bad place or anything. The staff is friendly, one time they messed up my order I called them on it and they gave me the sandwich I wanted plus let me keep the messed up one for free (FYI, it did not reheat well). The prices are a tad high for what they serve, but the portions make up for it. For me the kicker is that \u00a0it seems as though they have selective hearing on somethings; namely whenever I want cheese on something, I will get charged for cheese but I won't get cheese. They have a cool outdoor section and also space for live music. So yeah, if you love chicken, waffles, or chicken &amp; waffles check this place out.",

Reliable in that the service is always attentive and friendly. Reliable in that we always leave with a smile on our faces.  I never waver from the chicken and waffles. The chicken is not over seasoned and I'm not sure what people mean when they say it's dry. I've had countless drumsticks and they are always piping hot and juicy. The chicken is done in a classic southern style. No muss. No fuss. No secret ingredients. Crispy on the outside, moist and delicious on the inside. Gussie's lets the chicken speak for itself.  The waffle is a thinner, classic style. I'm pretty sure they're delicious but honestly, they only last about 20 seconds on my plate before they're gone. That must mean something.  My wife has favored the chowder recently and tells me it's awesome. I believe she also had an oxtail special one time that was equally awesome. Just pointing out that no matter what you order, you will be getting something good.  We wandered in here for dinner for the first time this past Friday, where a DJ was spinnin' bits with some classic soul tunes mixed with modern beats. Not usually my style but it fits at Gussies. Had a great time and will make a point to go back for dinner on the weekends more often.  I also enjoy going here for Sunday lunch after everyone gets out of church. Love seeing the 80 year old men dressed in their best suits and hats, wolfing down some chicken. Classic!",

    "review_text": "I live in the neighborhood &amp; really, really wanted to love this place.  With farmerbrown, Little Skillet, Front Porch &amp; other awesome fried chicken contenders in town, the SF bar is set pretty high. Unfortunately, the fried chicken &amp; waffles at Gussie's didn't even come close.  We ordered the fried catfish &amp; okra appetizers to start. The okra was decent, the catfish somewhat dry and flavorless. We were a large group of 7 so between us ordered a wide range of entrees from the daily special to the 1/2 chicken to the huge Taste of the South.  I ordered the chicken drumstick with honey cornbread and shared my husband's 1/2 chicken with sweet potato waffles and a side of mac 'n' cheese.   The chicken was dry, the waffles thin and floppy, the mac 'n' cheese smothered with cheese but otherwise unremarkable. What really stood out was the honey cornbread - absolutely delicious and full of rich flavors.  For dessert the table tried the peach cobbler, red velvet cake, banana pudding and pecan pie. The red velvet cake was dry; the banana pudding didn't have enough truly ripe bananas in it &amp; the cake tasted as if it hadn't soaked in the pudding long enough; and the pecan pie was cloyingly sweet. The only winner was the peach cobbler, fresh from the oven and served in its own skillet. Delicious!  The ambiance is somewhat like a Denny's - bright and loud. Our waiter seemed new and unfamiliar with the menu options, like when I inquired about gravy options and he never got back to me. Initially, he came to the table to check on us &amp; interact, but as the restaurant got busier we didn't see much of him at all.   The food came out in a normal amount of time, but there were two orders at our table of 7 that had chicken mix-ups, with the server (or kitchen staff?) unable to differentiate between white and dark meat. One plate had to be sent back twice before they got it right.  All in all, this restaurant was a 2.8 for me. We went there as part of our monthly Supper Club. It seems more suited to happily buzzed &amp; ravenous people getting out of Yoshi shows or clubs rather than people looking for a really great dining experience.  We did see former SF Mayor Willie Brown with yet another lovely young lady on his arm as we were seated last night. Too bad the food wasn't as interesting as the buzz around him.   With so many amazing fried chicken options in the city, I won't be back.",

The location was tucked away from the tourist stricken areas of SF, which is always good. The decor has a contemporary feel that is much nicer than the other Soul Food joints I've been to.  It was a Saturday afternoon; the wait for the 5 of us was about 15minutes. Our server, Terence, was a nice guy who made sure our drinks were never empty.  I ordered the \"Taste of the South.\" My goodness, the portions were HUGE. The chicken was great, lightly breaded and fresh. The candied yams were fantastic; I could have ordered a plate of those and would have been a happy camper. The cornbread was light and fluffy, the perfect addition. The mac n' cheese was just okay, nothing special. The collard greens, on the other hand, were responsible for the loss of stars; they were over the top salty. I usually clean my plate, even with portions that big, but I couldn't finish the greens.  I also had a bite of their \"Signature Sweet Potato Waffles,\" a plate of those and a side of their candied yams, and I would be set. I'll be back just for that.  Tip: Try to come with a party of 4 or less. They only have a few tables for parties of 5 and above. We would have been sat almost immediately if we had one less.",

Wait is terribly long even if you're the only customers eating there - it's really ridiculous. I've tried their waffle, chicken, corn bread and mash potatoes. The only things that I liked was the corn bread and potatoes. The chicken was over cooked, dry and tasteless (well, you'll taste something if you douse it with lots of hot sauce... it'll taste like hot sauce). It had no seasoning that you can taste of. I've grown up eating real soul food (goulash, turkey neck, gumbo, etc.) which includes the best fried chicken ever, but this is such a sad, depressing place and doesn't deserve to even be considered to be placed under soul food. It really surprises me when I see people with 4 or 5 stars for this establishment. I've come here only once and that was my last visit. I'd rather walk 4 blocks to KFC (spicy dark meat please!), in the rain and hail if I'm craving fried chicken than cross the street to Gussie's. They're pretty much an epic FAIL.

We seated ourselves in a booth and a server brought us menus right away. He said there was a buffet and pointed towards the buffet. At first I didn't understand what he said but after we ordered and saw other people getting food from the buffet, we realized what he meant. I don't know how much the buffet cost but the menu says on Fridays it's $10. We were there on a Tuesday, however. Regardless, the servers were all very smiley and attentive. They checked on us often.   This is what we ordered: Uptown Special (1 chicken breast &amp; 1 waffle) $9.29 Fried Catfish Nuggets $7.79 Macaroni and Cheese (side) $4.29  I didn't particularly like my food. The baked mac n cheese tasted like it has been sitting there for a while. Perhaps it was scooped from the buffet. The layer of cheese on top was really dry. The chicken was fine. My friend had the catfish nuggets and basically, he's had better. Seemed like there was too much batter on them. So the food was okay and for 50% off (via Scout Mob), it was really worth it.   If I were to come back, I think I'd do the buffet because that's what everyone else seemed to be doing.",

Straight to it, they need more staff the wait for tables (not crowded) ,water and to order are all bad the hostess is the initial waitress and refills water.  My table was leaning, no stars for decor. There was an attempt to make me pay an extra $2.for the specialty when clear as day on the menu they're the same price, not having it! So I have one sweet potato waffle (flavor not bad but the fact that it was too thin and rubbery blew it, not too mention my waffle wasn't its full size guess they didn't have enough mix to fill the maker) a chicken thigh( that was fried like they were making a second attempt at killing the chicken was pretty flavorless). So we ordered the sides sampler just to see what they like, they blacked eyed peas where pretty tasty not the best but compared to the other three at least it had flavor. The cornbread was yummy. The collard greens, yams, and macaroni and cheese all yuck! \u00a0 As if that wasn't bad enough their closing waiter etiquette was just all wrong I'm too embarrassed for him to even give the particulars. So at the end of the day I will NEVER go back and advise you not to make this one of your top 100 options!",

First of all, the area reminds me of L.A. I hadn't been in this area before so it was a little new.  The inside of the place was AWESOME! Very family/group/couple friendly...even if you want to eat by yourself..It looks very elegant inside.  Now on to the food...  My plate: I liked it! The wings were great! The homefries tasted better with ketchup which was slightly disappointing (I think they were missing a lil more salt?) The eggs were a little dry as well as the biscuit...but honestly, I came out pretty satisfied. The plate was around $8 for all of this. My bf's plate: He said he was disappointed with the syrup and he prefers Auntie April's waffles and for a $9 dollar plate, he was not full.   So in conclusion, I would regularly give them a 3/5, but because the place was so nice and the customer service was fast &amp; super sweet...I gave them a 4/5.",

Yes, we were hungry, but the tiny piece of chicken was not fulfilling nor was it as good as Popeye's.   SAD.  The batter of the chicken was not spicy or authentic enough to pass in my book.

We drove for our dinner date on a Saturday. I checked the website and it stated that they closed at 12am. We drove and paid toll to get there. We got lost a couple of times and by the time we arrived it was 10:35. 1hr an half before they closed. We knew we were cutting it close but we had plenty of time. When we finally go there it was CLOSED at 10:35pm. I then proceed to check the website again and it clearly stated 12. I went to check yelp and they stated open to 4pm-10pm. I was I confused. Wouldn't a restaurant that is advertising their business have the correct information?? I located the website via Grupon. shouldn't they as business owners be responsible to make sure information is correctly advertised?? I wasted my time, my gas and not to mention the inconvenience it was. I then decided to call the following day to see what time they closed. Not to mention I received a completely different answer than from Yelp and their website. It closed at 11pm. Which I was very confused. 10, 11, 12??? Which one was it. I then explained to the person on the phone what ha happened an hoe they should fix it on their website. The very not nice but rude $&amp;@?$ stated \"and how can I help you ? \" we'll duh you can help emerged by telling your boss.

Minus one point for the waiter taking FOREVER to come take our orders. It wasn't super busy and it still took way too long. Seems like they're understaffed. The ambiance was nice and there was a DJ spinning old school hip-hop favs which we enjoyed. On to the food, the chicken was juicy with crispy skin and was pretty flavorful. The meat of the chicken was however a little bland (maybe Roscoe's uses a brine or something but the meat of their chicken seems to be much tastier than Gussie's).  The waffle, however, left much to be desired. I got sweet potato waffles and they were tasty but a little too sweet when combined with syrup. They were also too soggy in the middle and a little underdone. The regular waffle was kind of dry and tasteless. Cornbread, chicken omelette, and fried cheese grits were yummy. It's cool that they have a bar and a buffet and stay open late. Overall, I wasn't impressed but wasn't disappointed either. I'll return for the chicken and to try a few other dishes.

With that said, the food at Gussie's definitely reminds me of home cooking, not of the bombdiggety variety, but of the meh, I'll keep eating \u00a0cuz it ain't bad variety. Considering that I had both the buffet and option of eating all of my friends dishes, I think I got a pretty good idea of the menu items. Of maybe the 20 items I tried, only the cornbread and the mac-n-cheese stood out. They were deeelicious, simple and done right. But 2 great items out of 20 less than stellar options isn't a good ratio at all.   My real problem with Gussie's though, is if you're gonna live by a name \"Chicken &amp; Waffles\" these two items should be your money maker. Well suffice it to say, I wasn't impressed at all. The chicken, on more than one occasion, had that freezer burn taste to it. I don't care how good your breading is, no amount of spices is gonna save that old carcass. And sadly the regular waffle tasted like a soggier version of Lego-my-Eggo. The sweet potato waffle had a better taste but even without syrup was simply too limp for my liking.   The staff, decor, and ambiance at Gussie's is what is saving this from a 2-star review. The servers did their job well. The contemporary look plus the Southern vibe added to the warmth and overall inviting layout of the restaurant.   There are other \"soul food\" restaurants around SF and the East Bay that serve better quality food at a similar price point. So it may be awhile before I'm back at Gussie's.",

    "review_text": "Chicken and waffles is a commitment type of meal. I say that because you have to be committed to eating something rich and filling, and you have to be prepared to suffer the potential sensory overload consequences for said meal consumption. Fortunately, at my most recent visit to Gussie's, my friend and I discovered the loophole: the vegetarian plate.  We split a 1/4 chicken and two waffles plate, decadent like you might expect, but then to \"balance everything out,\" we got the veggie plate, which consisted of black-eyed peas, red beans, rice, potatoes, and greens. I think it was supposed to come with cornbread, which it didn't, but we had enough carbs on our plate (literally) so I'll let the slip slide. Anyway, this plate was so delicious, which is saying a lot since chicken and waffles is inherently delicious, that I'll never eat chicken and waffles without something like it again. The chicken and waffles this time around was tasty but not incredible; the waffles, light and fluffy but the chicken seemed like it wasn't as fresh as it could have been. We also ordered the red velvet cake, which was a bit of a dry, crumbly letdown, but the overall experience here is a great, no-frills, relatively gritty one. I noticed that one of the specials was red velvet waffles... I can only say that I hope they have it on the menu next time, and that I am fully prepared to handle it. Maybe I should order some greens on the side.",

    "review_text": "Gussies what happened?? . The first couple of times you had great food..it was such a nice alternative to similar places further away..  We went there a few days ago because my body demanded fried chicken and southern comfort. All I got was chewy chicken and indigestion .. Here is what happened -For one thing my wife and I were already suspicious since it took only 5 minutes for our order to be served. I ordered the Taste of the South combo meal. the chicken had no fried appearance, it was chewy and hard to swallow. No crunch to it. It was probably sitting in heat lamp already prepared waiting for someone to order. So it wasnt fresh for one thing,  The Mac and Cheese didnt look good, something a total amateur could whip up. It tasted okay but was lacking. The smothered potatoes was okay but it smothered everything on the plate. The collard greats were fine.  We ordered the biscuits because they looked good. OMG - it was like eating peanut butter or something that just wads up and sticks in your mouth. I swear I could have used it for plaster to fill up holes in the wall Just chew on their biscuit until youve got a thick ball in your mouth, spit it out and fill all the holes in your wall up with it. \u00a0It made KFCs biscuit look like the greatest thing in the world.  Yes it was that awful. I dont know what went wrong here, maybe we ate there too early. It might be better to go when its crowded and then they are forced to cook fresh food. We even ordered TOTS and get French fries instead, probably because the fries were just sitting there under the lamp ala McDonalds.. we did exchange them which meant the cook had to get off his ass and make something fresh. And they were. The dipping sauce was horrible though.. it looked like someone puked in the dipping cup. It was ugly to look at, smelled awful and just disgusting \u00a0 Ive been kicking myself ever since that day because I could have spent less than 35.00 for a good meal and with dozens of places to eat around there including Japantown nearby, Ive had that guilty purchase feeling all weekend.  I dont know if Ill ever go back.. maybe a year or two.. but not in the immediate future.",

From atmosphere and service to chicken and syrup, Gussie's is arguably better than Roscoe's.  Full disclaimer: I haven't tried the other food. Instead, I focused on the Uptown Special:  *One perfectly cooked chicken breast, not too crispy and still juicy; *One waffle, slightly sweet (cinnamon?) and not too heavy or thick; *Amazingly full-bodied maple syrup *Pitch perfect sweet tea  My best friend and I debated which element really made the meal, so we tried another chicken and waffle place - nearby Bar Johnny, with its odd hot sauce and below-average chicken - and decided to return to Gussie's three days later. Yup, it's the chicken and the syrup.  Both times the waitstaff was courteous and friendly. The food took about 10 minutes, even when we went during a particularly busy evening.   Highly recommended.",

Other then my boyfriends, this is the best chicken and waffles ever and will be where i come for it. corn bread, red beans n rice, and fried chicken breast all on one plate.. sign me up.  the second time... wow, where to begin. we were there for almost 3.5 hours. In the waiting room for 45 minutes, at the table waiting to order for 20 minutes, waiting for our food for over an hour, then when our food came they forgot one of our 5 orders... so half of us ate cold food because we waited for the last order, and half had to feel rude eating because they were starving and could not wait. after 20 minutes of waiting for the lost dish, the waitress came with a bowl of assorted fried chicken and said the sweet potato waffle and sides he ordered would take to long but they would bring him regular pancakes to go... how that makes up for it i could not tell you. Finally for this pancake to come and for us to get the bill it was an additional 30 minutes or so. all in all a terrible time, we were all starving and crancy, and to kill time we drank beer which lead to having to much beer on an empty stomach... never going back on a sunday again.",

Sad to say I was not impressed... we ordered 3 things, the fried catfish nuggets, southern comfort and the uptown special.   The wait for food was lil bit longer then I expected, I thought that it mite be due to the place being new and still trying to get into its groove which I strugged off thinking the food would speak for itself. Sadly again when the food came out it was not very good impressed, struggled to cut the waffle with the flimsy fork and blunt knife given, waffles not so good, no flavor just large and thin in size. The chicken was bland, no taste, I kinda felt cheated like i could of ran to popeyes or kfc to make up for what i paid. I know that is bad to say but it was true. Those days when you feel for something fast maybe for lunch or dinner if you do not want to cook and get enough for a group kfc or popeyes usually hits the spot since u know what your getting and wut your paying for. The fried catfish nibblers with homemade tartar sauce is the only thing I really liked at this place, catfish yes, sauce did not taste any different from any store bought sauce, the catfish was fluffy and tender and taste was good, I don't like fish but they did do justice to there catfish. also if you have a sweet tooth try there southern tea it is supersweet for me it is perfect other people may think it is too sweet.  The service was kinda wierd, when seating the hostess in front seemed to be distracted she tried to call on a secondary hostess to seat and it seemed like both were out of place if not confused, the waiteress we had was nice but she was not very attentive, never asked if we wanted or needed a refill of water or tea, never came back to offer more napkins, never to asked if we needed our check, we had to flag another waitress if not a bus boy to get our waitress for our check, for desert I ordered the red velvet but they were out, it was a sunday afternoon maybe 1:20pm so they had to have opened maybe by 11am thought it was wierd that they were already out hmm not so sure if i will go back to this place due to the food and customer service sad really thought it would be a lil bit better.  customer service * 1/2 no refill, no attentiveness, almost non-existent food ** catfish made this place a 2 star the chicken and waffles is definite fail no stars for the signature meal.  cost $$ you will be probably spending $11 - $30 depending on your order",

I also have to agree that my soda was flat, I think that whomever is serving the soda needs to do a better job. No biggie. Overall, for 2 meals and 2 sodas it came out to $35.

Service was hit and miss, from way too much attention at the beginning (we were asked what we wanted as they were handing us our menus) to uneven (forgot the side dish), but if i expected crumb scrapers and fine-honed precision, i wouldn't have gone to a chicken and waffles place (that said, it's never \u00a0BAD to find precision and good service). Even with the small issues, all the staff were friendly and that went a long way toward making our meal a good one. We'll be back.

Well, for me at least...   We also ordered one of their samplers: red beans &amp; rice, candied yams, mac &amp; cheese, and collard greens. I thought the red beans &amp; rice were really good.

This was our first visit to Gussies, but it surpasses Little Skillet in overall experience.  We ordered for 2, sharing this:  1/2 chicken (mix of dark and white) with 2 waffles $15.59 Substituted 2 sweet potato waffles +$2 Side of gravy and onions +$.79 Honey cornbread +$.99  The half chicken included 4 pieces of chicken - breast ( large lots of white meat), leg, wing, and thigh. Nicely seasoned, good flavor, juicy enough especially with the gravy and syrup. Skin not as crispy as Roscoe's in LA, but very nice.  Waffles are thin as others have mentioned, however we preferred the thing sweet potato waffles to the thicker waffles you get in other joints. Light and flavorful, the sweet potato waffle is subtly sweet, and highly recommended.  The savory Gravy provides the subtle compliment to the chicken and sweet potato waffle that makes gussies' chicken and waffles sing. No drenching syrup needed (even though it's included), just a touch to add a touch more sweetness.  The honey cornbread with gravy was delicious too.   The only improvements could be better coordination among the waiters ( two waiters came by our table one after another asking us similar information two times during our meal).   Also, on the draft beer menu is a beer called \"Gussies Back Porch\". I was excited that gussies maqu have it's own microbrew which would have put this place over the top. However, I was disappointed to hear that in reality this \"microbrew\" was just another name for Gussies' house draft, Miller High Life. What the...?  All in all, despite small possible improvements, this is by far the best chicken and waffles experience I've had in San Fran. I prefer this to Little Skillet, and my woman prefers Gussies's gravy to Roscoe's.  4.6 stars.  Definitely recommended, and will be bringing others soon!",

Excellent waffles, Delicious plump chicken breast, the sides we shared were out of this freaking world.   The price point wasn't bad either. 3 of us ate for about forty bucks. Not bad. Did I mention it was delicious too???? :)",

Saw someone else's waffles and they looked a little undercooked for my taste. The chicken wings were super delicious, albeit I wish they had been a little crispier. The flavor was great though.  I had grits on the side.. my first time trying them.. I wasn't sure what they were supposed to taste like. I've never had anything to compare them to.. but I don't think I'm a fan. They were okay when I stole some cheese from my friend's omelet and mixed it together, but besides that.. meh.  Cornbread was yuuuuuuummmmy. Definitely recommend this place!",

Gussies is an upscale chicken and waffles place and that's the problem; chicken and waffles should never be upscale!  First time I went I had the catfish sandwich; it was just okay. \u00a0In all honesty it was glorified fast food at best. \u00a0I had a side of collards and a side of cheesy grits; the collards were okay but I prefer mine and the cheesy grits were really good but cheesy grits are so easy to make it seems silly paying so much for them. \u00a0The only reason I came back a second time was to try their Friday night buffet....  Second time: \u00a0I came specifically for the buffet; I wanted to try a few different things that would add up to a lot if I ordered from the regular menu. \u00a0The buffet is pretty sad; it's tucked away in a very dark corner and has a limited selection. \u00a0The time I was there they had fried chicken, plain rice, some sort of steamed cabbage, and macaroni and cheese. \u00a0THERE WERE NO WAFFLES IN THE BUFFET! \u00a0If you're a chicken and waffle place with a buffet shouldn't you have waffles in your buffet? \u00a0I skipped the buffet and ordered off their regular menu...  I split an order of fried chicken and the sweet potato waffles. \u00a0The fried chicken was really good but it's still just fried chicken; the sweet potato waffles were good but they were still just waffles and they cost $10 for just 2! \u00a0That's $5 a waffle! \u00a0Dinner for two quickly added up to $45 for what amounts to glorified fast food.  The first night there was live music; a keyboard player, a 5-string bass, and a drum machine. \u00a0The live musicians would have been good on their own but the drum machine just killed any chance of it being enjoyable. \u00a0The second time there was a DJ; the DJ played a good mix of '60s rnb and '90s hip hop but they could have gotten away with an Ipod on shuffle. \u00a0Overall the music could have been a nice touch but totally unnecessary.  Overall Gussie's has some pretty good food but it's priced out of it's league; why pay so much for glorified fast food when one can spend the same amount on something a little more upscale and not so easy to make at home?",

In the past week I've had red velvet whoopie pies, cupcakes, cookies, and pancakes. But I digress.. The chicken &amp; waffles hit the spot. Chicken breast was a ginormous piece and I was worried that it might be dry as chicken breasts can easily become. \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised how flavorful and moist the chicken was cooked. \u00a0It didn't need hot sauce (gasp!) or any other condiment to help it out. \u00a0 Both types of waffles were tasty by their own right. \u00a0Good texture, not overly sweet. \u00a0  The service was okay. \u00a0We had to call a couple of times to get refills on water. \u00a0Food came out fairly quickly considering how busy it was on a Saturday mid-afternoon. \u00a0We'll be back to try more and maybe venture into more than just chicken &amp; waffles..

Looking around the restaurant there were many groups that were not getting their food.  We were informed by the staff that they were short a cook and the food would take longer. They also said that many people showed up at once.  If you're going to be short staffed in the kitchen, don't sit as many people as you can. There were still a lot of people waiting outside.  We were apologized too many times and told our food would come out soon but it never arrived. At one point some one from the kitchen told us it would be 5 minutes. Well 20 minutes later we still had no food. At this point we got up and told them we were leaving.  Terrible service. We will not be going back.",

    "review_text": "That's what I get for trying a place the first week it opens...  The restaurant itself is a lot bigger than I had expected... very spacious and inviting. \u00a0I walked in at 7pm expecting a half hour wait for a table for 9 (they don't take reservations) and was pleasantly surprised when the hostess apologetically said it'd be about 10 minutes. \u00a0As promised, 10 minutes later, we were led toward the back of the restaurant, where they had long tables that could accomodate a large group. We ordered a couple appetizers for the table to share and various combos of chicken and waffles (1/4 chicken, breast, thigh, wings, etc.) individually. Someone was there to promptly take our order, and then we were left to wait.  Luckily, the company was great and we barely noticed at first... but 20 minutes later, the waiter came and told us our food would be out shortly. \u00a0Not thinking anything of it, we kept talking amongst ourselves. \u00a010 minutes later, our appetizers came out. \u00a0We got the fried okra (this was pretty good) and fried catfish nuggests (may be a bit salty for some people, but I love salt and really enjoyed these). We were all hungry by then, and the portions were small (the waiter had warned us of this ahead of time), so we devoured those appetizers fairly quickly.  Another 20 minutes passed before we realized that when they originally said our food would be out shortly, that they had only been referring to our appetizers. \u00a0By then my stomach was growling... and finally 10 minutes later, our plates came out.  I got the filmore classic (1 waffle, 3 chicken wings, and eggs). \u00a0The waffles were already cold when I got them, and there was barely any meat on the wings. And the wings were TINY... and dry. \u00a0I think another review desribed them as looking like rejects that hadn't turned out right. \u00a0Those weren't rejects - that's just how they are. \u00a0The syrup was good... very light and had a watery consistency... so it wasn't overpowering like normal maple syrup can be. I think the waffles had a hint of cinnamon in them, which was nice... and complemented the savoriness of the chicken.   We also got an order of the sweet potato waffles for the table to try. Maybe I just don't know how they're supposed to taste, but it had a sour aftertaste to it, like there was plum in it? I won't be ordering it again.  Other people at the table got different parts of the chicken... and weren't all that impressed either. \u00a0The staff was really nice though, which makes me feel bad for giving it only 2 stars. \u00a0However, I feel worse for bringing my friends to try this place... \u00a0maybe I'll take them all to LA for some real chicken and waffles. \u00a0=P",

Like a big soggy sponge with no crispiness. How can someone screw a waffle up?? Even my favorite slophouse diner can churn out a good waffle. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was because I got it To-Go and that the chicken was so good. Maybe next time I'll sit down and eat there.",

    "review_text": "A place to consider, if you have not had chicken-n-waffles before and you are in the area, check it out.  The food is decent, I ordered the Gussie's signature sweet potato waffles ($9.79) with 2 pieces of fried chicken wings for additional $3. I think the overall experience was diminished by the fact that there was a lack of wholesomeness on my plate, 2 waffles, 2 pieces of chicken, and a small pot of hot maple syrup. Sure that's what I ordered, but it's a bit hard to justify the cost of the soggy waffle for $5 a piece (oh I forgot butter, it must have been $1). It certainly was delicious but not perfect. A few of my buddies have ordered the Taste Of The South ($14.99) was definitely a party plate with one-quarter fried chicken, baked macaroni and cheese, fresh collard greens, candied yams &amp; honey cornbread, the overall taste is above average and you get lots of varieties compare to their waffle options.  Bottomline: I am thankful for the restaurant to accommodate the 17 of us, so I can't complain about the speed of service, we all had a pretty good fill sharing different dishes, which are generally generous, that we have ordered. The party had a decent time at this casual and charming joint despite the fact that the food wasn't the best I've had.  Cheers.",

I have gone to Gussies twice over the past few weeks, and it keeps getting better and better. Sure, they are going through their \"soft opening\" and continue in this phase as they work out the last few kinks in their operations. So calm down already.  The first time we went, it was on the Sunday after they first opened. The place was packed, so of course I was prepared to wait longer for the food. Which we did, but by the time it arrived, I had already had the corn (yum), gumbo (yum), mac n' cheese (YUM). I ordered the Uptown, which is the standard chicken breast and waffle. Duh-li-cious. (Please note: I was a HUGE Roscoes fan when I lived down in LA, so I know my chicken and waffles- check yourself Ed). Plus, are you really going to argue with a black woman about chicken and waffles? Didn't think so.  Second time I went, I brought my friend from LA, who is also a regular of Roscoes and grew up in the rural south- couldn't have more of a qualified critic than that right? I was actually nervous to hear his feedback. He had the downtown, and once again, I had the uptown (if it ain't broke don't fix it right?) Needless to say, he cleaned his plate, as did I, and the service had improved ten fold. The people there are all so nice, as if it needed to be said again, and now I have the recommendation to try the sweet potato waffles next time, which I am looking forward to!",

While I love fried chicken, I have been hearing about this combo for years and how I must go to Roscoe's in LA, but with a Groupon, we visited on a wet Sunday. \u00a0It wasn't busy @ 9:30 but by the time we left, people started arriving. \u00a0  The establishment is big and extremely clean with plenty of room for a simple sit or a big group meal. \u00a0Our hostess/servers were friendly, explained things on the menu (it's kind of a confusing menu 1/4 chicken vs 2 pieces, which is the same thing) and made recommendations. \u00a0I decided on the fried chicken breast on an original waffle and my pal got the two piece with two waffles &amp; two eggs. \u00a0While the coffee was sub-par, the food sent me into the stratosphere. \u00a0The juxtaposition of the tender but crispy golden fried breast against the cinnamon waffle and maple syrup sang. \u00a0I was thankful for some leftovers to repeat the process again later in the day for an early dinner.

Gilt City recommended reservations but we really didn't need it. They actually seemed surprised we had one. Nevertheless, the tastefully decorated and spacious dining room was about half full of happy people.  Everyone talks about Roscoe's as being the best at chicken and waffles- sure it's good...I just didn't think it is THIS good. Not only is the menu far more varied, but customer service was excellent (not sullen like at every Roscoe's I've EVER been to). I was really happy to see just how clean the silverware and glasses were. Crystal hot sauce on the table and great music playing the entire time made this a meal seemingly sent from the gods.   I had the \"Two's Company:\" two eggs any style (scrambled with cheese), two chicken wings, and grits. Hey- if I'm going to compare to Roscoe's- I might as well get the same thing! Hubby had the half chicken (dark meat, of course!) with two waffles. Naturally, I sampled the waffles- super yummy! As I reminisce on the deliciousness of this meal, I remembered how amazing their syrup was. I checked out the website and now I know why- it's HOMEMADE brown sugar syrup! I've never heard of such but clearly I've been missing out my entire life.   Finally, a huge test of a restaurant for me is how clean the bathroom was. Their restroom was immaculate AND it had an Ernie Barnes painting in there.   Neighborhood was a bit sketch but the only parking we found was the structure directly across the street. Ah well.

The exterior was welcoming and pleasant and their was a couple of families waitiing to be seated as we entered the restaurant. The atmosphere was overwhelming, crammed, and loud. The waitress/hostess very unorganized and it seemed like they were understaffed as the same person who greeted us is the same person who was supposedly \"serving us\". \u00a0   We waited over 40 minutes to get our drinks (bottomless mimosa and one beer) and the food took over an hour to get. \u00a0  I ordered the southern comfort menu item, the chicken was bland but since I had been so hungry from the 1hr wait I doused it in hot sauce and made due. \u00a0  The waffles were a joke. They were so rubbery and cold that I couldn't even eat them. I knew \u00a0if I asked for them to bring me out hot waffles, they would just go put the waflfles in the microwave to be heated but I didnt want to be bothered at this point.  The eggs scramble was disgustingly runny and cold.   The server came by to us after 15 minutes to ask us how the food was but we couldn't eat anything nor were we going to ask for her to make us a new plate. \u00a0Considering the ridiculous wait it took. \u00a0They sat more people than they could feed and blamed the kitchen for their errors. \u00a0I hate nothing more than a server who points the finger at the cooks in the back that can't defend themselves. \u00a0They crammed so many chairs and half tables side by side that there was no elbow room. \u00a0Our table literally was the back of someone's chair. When we asked politely to a table that wasn't in the middle of an isle. \u00a0We were denied although there were 2 other tables that were available for 2 people. \u00a0  This establishment only cares about getting as many orders as they can rather than satisfying the customers they have. \u00a0We should not have been sat in the middle of the isle where their sloppy serving skills interfered with our comfort and enjoyment of the establishment. \u00a0  We spent Muni fare and 2 hours of our day to have the most disgusting food and the worst service ever. \u00a0  The server's performance was inadequate and we weren't pleased with the food. \u00a0We come from restaurant backgrounds and usually tip 20% or better depending on the service. \u00a0We didn't tip this server due to the very unpleasant experience she gave us and she followed us out of the restaurant to make a remark about \"black people\" and \"this is why\" you cant do business with BLACK PEOPLE. Are you serious???!! Because I heard that predominantly black people run this establishment is one of the reasons I came from San Mateo county and TRIED to support your establishment \u00a0  She blamed the cooks for the cold food when if she just delivered it on time we would've had lukewarm plates and stereotyped her own race as being bad tippers rather than looking at the performance she gave and realizing the flaws lie on her. \u00a0   This was my first stiff and I would normally feel bad about it. \u00a0I don't . She gave everyone else attention and eye-contact and blew us off as if we were second rate. The was rude, the food was gross, and the place was a waste of our Sunday afternoon.

I was scared to order the greens as usually they are cooked with pork, but not here. These not too spicy greens are cooked with turkey!!  I was disappointed in three things, however. Their peach cobbler was just dreadfully sweat peaches and sauce with no crust. Also, they were out of chicken breast (which I ordered to go with my red velvet waffle) which was cold and obviously cooked before the rest of my meal. I was so disappointed, especially because it seemed of the waffle was hot/warm is was going to be the bomb. It comes with nuts and cream cheese frosting. I'll order that again and request they make it once all the side dishes and such are almost finished. Despite the short comings, I'd definitely order again (with slight adjustments) because there food is great! Let's just hope next time at 12:45, they are not already out of chicken breast. Soul food at its best!  One more thing, due to its location, parking is horrid. My husband double parked while I ran in, this is probably your best bet unless your dining in, in which case, come early and keep circling.",

    "review_text": "Gussies was my second time trying Chicken and Waffles ever. The first was Frisco Fried in Bayview. I've had Gussies twice. The first time delivered. The second time, i'm not so sure. I had the Uptown Special and the second time I had the Southern Comfort.   Although the food was good, two buddies of mine and I ordered the same thing and I can't trust that their consistency is the same. The SoCo comes with a leg and thigh, and one of my friend's thighs were substantially bigger than ours. I don't know if ours was burnt, but it looked like a scale model of my friends.  The service is good, food comes out in adequate time, but the ambiance sucks. it's pretty dark inside. I can barely see my food. I don't know if they are imitating some sort of Southern thing, but it ain't charming. At least not to me.  Also tried the catfish nuggets (still catfishy, muddy taste) which suggests it isnt fresh but who knows, and the gravy biscuits which were a waste of money.   I'd go back again..but then i don't know. There has been a craze for chicken and waffles lately, especially with the Lay's chips coming out. I'm not going to lie, but it sparked my interest in trying C&amp;W for the first time.  This place delivers tasty food for rookies. but once I got over the novelty of eating C&amp;W, I realized that it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Not to say Gussie's is bad, because it's not, but the prices don't warrant the quality of the food for me, especially when you'll serve me and my friend a leg that's bigger than the thigh, which is the size of a chicken tender. Then serve my other friend a full size thigh.  I'm over it.",

I had a damned coupon I had purchased so I jumped out to see what the hours were and, lo and behold, the door was unlocked. A guy on the phone yelled from the back, \"Just sit where you want.\" In their defense, I'm okay with all that; my low rating is for the food. If chicken and waffles is in your name, I don't think an over sized, very thin Eggo makes a good impression. I didn't taste the chicken, although the wings looked like they were from a farm next to a nuclear power plant - they were gigantic. My friend said it tasted fine, but then he makes chili in a toaster oven at home. My eggs and grits were okay, a bit cold (and again, we were the only customers in the place). Granted, I am a bit jaded by the farmerbrown/Little Skillet and Brenda's breakfast options, but Gussie's in no way lived up to expectations. Maybe later on with a bit of a crowd it may have been a bit more acceptable, but the feeling on the whole was a poorly-run Denny's on a bad day. Sorry, Gussie.

Upon walking in, we were greeted and seated by a very nice lady -- Deanna (sorry if I spelled your name wrong). She took our drink orders -- two of us tried their orange/strawberry soda mix and it was just perfect.   After much debating (so many great-sounding items on both the menu and specials of the day list), I went with the Fillmore special which if I recall, is 3 wings, a waffle, and eggs. I also got a side of their smothered potatoes (how does that NOT sound appetizing?). We didn't wait long before the food came out and already based on appearance alone, the food looked outstanding. My eggs over-hard were the best I had EVER seen -- and they tasted delicious too! The smothered potatoes were a dream come true -- slightly mashed potatoes with gravy and chilies -- oh my! The waffle was something I wanted to stand up and applaud for. This isn't your typically flavorless waffle -- it reminded me of the one's at Roscoe's (sorry to compare but honestly, that is a compliment considering that place is legendary) -- it had a sweet sugar and cinnamon taste to it, it was slightly crunchy, and with the syrup poured over, I almost melted into a pool of pure satisfaction. As some have said, yes, their syrup is runny -- is that really a problem? It TASTES incredible -- isn't that what matters? Now, the chicken was very well cooked -- moist with a crunchy skin -- my only complaint was that it didn't have too much seasoning -- but it's a small complaint!  Our server came back several times to check on us -- something I love -- and overall, she was just very attentive and polite. The check didn't come out to that much for the three of us -- I mean, for THAT kind of food, I expect to pay quite the dime. I HIGHLY recommend you come and check this place out. The three of us WILL be back and we'll try new things the next few times as the entire menu sounds very appetizing. Thanks, Gussie's!",

When we sat down, we kind of just looked around wondering if anyone knows we're here....  But after a while someone finally came.  I think I got the Fillmore with 1 waffle, 2 eggs and 3 wings. I was really excited for my food to come.   The waffle was like any other waffle what I thought made it different was the syrup. I don't know what was in there but it made the waffle so much better. It was runnier than usual and it tasted a bit different in a good way than what I'm used to. Just thinking about makes me crave waffles.  As for the chicken was moist and crispy but nothing really special about it...  Besides the initial service the rest of the service was pretty good.

    "review_text": "As a South Carolina native in San Francisco, I've been unimpressed with most of the \"Southern\" food in the Bay Area. I was skeptical when Gussie's was announced, but I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality. Two words; sweet tea. Any restaurant that does not brew it's own sweet tea should not be allowed to call itself \"Southern\", and Gussie's is a great 1 1/2 cup brew.  First off, this is not the greasy hole-in-the-wall you might expect from a restaurant called \"Chicken and Waffles\". It's a clean, casual space with an atmosphere that I would feel comfortable bringing anyone.   About the main dishes, the fried chicken and waffles, they're good, but they may not blow your mind (although the home-made syrup is incredible). What Gussie's excels are the secondary basics of Southern food. Their cornbread is awesome; warm, moist, and a hint of honey. Their mac 'n cheese is better and more traditional than I've had anywhere else in the Bay Area. In fact, I've been impressed with all their side dishes. It reminds me of the \"meat and 2 veggie\" places I'm used to back in the South.   The desserts are also very good. I LOVE the banana pudding. This idea probably reminds many people of the big vats that you would get in a cafeteria, but Gussie's pudding is whipped so light and creamy, it's absolute heaven! I will say that the red velvet cake could be a little more moist, but the icing is really good. And they just introduced fresh mini-cakes (like cupcakes) and these are to die for. If you do nothing else, stop in a buy a half dozen of these.",

We arrived about an hour later, found a place to park and walked into the restaurant.  I liked the atmosphere of the place. Very relaxing, with good music playing lightly in the background. The staff was very friendly to us.  We started off with an appetizer of Cheddar Cheese Grit Cakes. They were more cube looking than cake like. Very good! My friend ordered a side of Biscuit and Gravy. Of course I had to have a bite or two of his dish. The gravy was awesome. If they sold it by the gallon I'd buy it and use it like Frank's Hot Sauce and put that $h!t on everything! For dinner we both did the fried chicken and waffle meal. I thought the waffle was perfect and loved the maple syrup. The chicken was nice and crispy. It was, however, a tad over cooked in my opinion which made the chicken a little dry.  For dessert we shared a piece of Red Velvet Cake. It was just eh. The cream cheese frosting was on the thin side with very little taste of cream cheese. The cake itself was a little undercooked and slightly raw in the middle. I really wanted the Pecan Pie but sadly they were out. Overall, I did enjoy my meal and the place itself. I gave them 3 stars because of the over cooked chicken. Would I go there again? Yes I would. Think next time I would try their chicken strips with some hush puppies and fried okra!",

My boyfriend and I came in on Wednesday night at about 6pm. We circled a few times for parking and luckily found a spot just 2 blocks away. The restaurant was pretty much empty so we got to seat ourselves once we walked in. Note: careful when you sit down at a booth, that bench is pretty hard lol.   We ended up sharing the Southern Comfort with a side of gravy and mac and cheese. I especially enjoyed the crispy skin of the fried chicken. When the check came we just had to pay a total of $.66 plus tip. Not bad!   I'm so glad we have a chicken and waffles spot in the city. I would recommend coming on a weeknight for dinner to avoid the weekend crowd.",

My husband and I had been there before and wanted to take the kids since we enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was pretty good. The hostess seated us right away at the table nearest the door and a busboy brought out water for everyone.   That was the last time anyone spoke to us. At 7:30pm, with three starving children and no one having asked us to order or even acknowledging our presence, we decided that no one would likely be helping us, so we left to go find some food elsewhere. The restaurant was busy but even a simple quick would have sufficed.  That was the worst service we've ever experienced. I haven't reviewed many places but this one I feel that I need to for the way it made all of us feel like second class citizens. We would have gladly spent the $15+ for the chicken and waffles plates that are overpriced, but we couldn't even get our order in.",

I decided to wikipedia the origin of C&amp;W - one version has Thomas Jefferson bringing a waffle iron back from France. Great stuff.   Anyways, we get there and are seated fairly quickly. There was one waiter serving the whole area. I got the combo with fried chicken, waffles, and scrambled eggs (w/green onions and cheddar). GF got a similar dish but with sweet potato waffles.   Fried chicken - pretty good. Nice crispy skin and juicy. Some Crystal's on it and we're good to go.   Waffles - this is where I was disappointed. The waffles came out soggy and just weren't all that good. Had to drench it with some syrup to make it bearable. Sweet potato waffles had good flavor but also a bit soggy.  Scrambled eggs - by far the easiest dish and pretty good - but hard to mess these up.   Sweet tea - average, really sweet.   Decent service, takes credit card, street parking and some Zapp &amp; Roger playing.   Overall - OK food. Might come back for fried chicken dinner with other comfort foods.",

Avoid the syrup that comes with the waffles as it's bad. They do offer maple syrup for an extra cost which I will try the next time.  Forget the gravy. It's horrible. \u00a0Over powering flavor of green peppers and celery. \u00a0It's missing the soul of the chicken. \u00a0Hopefully they will improve it.  I need to try the other side dishes as they looked great as did the deserts the next time I'm there.  Once they have time to work the kinks out from being new I hope this will be a regular haunt.  The above was written back on my first visit when they just opened. \u00a0Well today a couple of months later I decided to try it again. \u00a0First off the wait staff is poorly trained even after about 10 weeks open. \u00a0I was dropped off at a dirty table. \u00a0The hostess barely bothered to take the dirty wine glass away from the previous patron. \u00a0I ordered 2 waffles to start as my appetizer and then 2 chicken breast and a side of mac &amp; cheese. \u00a0It took a half an hour for the waffles. \u00a0Still the same horrible syrup. \u00a0I could make better syrup from brown sugar and water. \u00a0The waffles are still underdone. \u00a0My chicken &amp; mac and cheese arrived another 20 minutes later both were good, not great. \u00a0The mac &amp; cheese was tepid but the thought of waiting around for them to heat it up sent shivers up my spine. \u00a0I could of been there until closing. \u00a0  It was time to collect my bill. \u00a0First they double charged me for my single iced tea. \u00a0But the craziest was the $9.98 charge for the two underdone waffles. \u00a0I'm sorry but that is ridiculous especially with their nasty syrup.  Over all I'd say save your money. \u00a0It's hard to believe that without tip my bill was $30.00. \u00a0This is absurd in the Fillmore neighborhood this restaurant is in. \u00a0The median income is somewhere between unemployed or on food stamps. \u00a0They have their nerve charging the neighborhood the prices they are charging. \u00a0For $30.00 I could of fried up 3 chickens and made a casserole of mac and cheese to feed 6-8 people not just one.

So I said some pretty stupidly obvious things - like ordering water when a glass was sitting in front of me. She was cool. Rolled with the punches, laughed with us, made sure our orders were correct, checked in on us, and was efficient in every aspect of her job! It was also sweet of her to come by and apologize for the annoying drunk Filipino girl (isn't there always one who can't seem to hold her liquor?) screaming in the restaurant. Of course this is now an afterthought, but I wish I had told her manager how awesome she was and proves that great customer service still exists in restaurants.   By the way, ordered the Country Cornmeal Waffles and my friend had the Fillmore Special. Both were really good. Chicken wasn't overly greasy, like I've had at some other establishments.

We didn't have reservations but told them that on the past about once a month when we dine here, we often do make them ahead, and it isn't out first time bringing a large group there. They didn't even come greet us we had to search around for staff. And they explained being understaffed, 2 cooks 3 waiters and one buss plus a cashier at the bar., and we said it's ok we are patient we can wait. We did not get any type of response except were trying to get a hold of our Manager. Then we got we will ask our cook. So again we asked if they would kindly accommodate us etc. We even went as far as saying that we could even set up ourselves, help clean the tables. They did not have the common courtesy most places do to come out, and outright say we can't help you sorry. Instead 20 min later they said we can seat you, but we have NO chicken........We have catfish and it will take a while to seat you then take your order and serve you. So for being unprepared in your business, and a bad host in a hosting industry you get one star. If it were a toy store, and they didn't have the key ingredient which \u00a0toys.... How would you rate them. We walked up the street to Bruno's, pizza without a reservation and helped the one waitress they had and two cooks put tables together and serve pitchers of beer wine etc. What's more our large crowd attracted more folks walking in to order, it got about another 20 patrons while we were there. we were hungry patient and polite. They had less staff than the folks here. So from now on they loose about 5k In annual revenue from our group. Not a lot but certainly not more, and bad reviews all around by word of mouth and Yelp.",

We ordered the cheddar cheese grit cakes, uptown special, taste of the south, and and two beers. They ran out of Sam Adams, however, they immediately corrected the situation. Our server - while being overworked was an extremely nice guy who seemed to care about his job and corrected .  As for the food - the cheddar cheese grit cakes were not my favorite - they appeared flavorless unlike other grits i have eaten before; the uptown special for some reason never arrived, and the taste of the south was quite tasty. This arrived at the same time as the entree.  The Taste of the South - had excellent fried chicken (two large pieces) and candied yams. The candied yams may have been some of the best I have had in my life -I could eat an entire plate of these. The macaroni and cheese, collared greens, and cornbread were ok - but nothing out of the ordinary.  I felt the experience could have been improved if you ordered at a counter and then they ran your food out \u00a0like at other nearby restaurants.

It was about 5pm on a Monday (MLK day) so there was only another party (3 people) and the four of us. There were two waiters who, again, were VERY nice but were just walking around. \u00a0We were there for 3 hours! We were in no rush to leave but...come on! Don't try the mimosas...they tasted like spoiled OJ (no fizz, just nasty). \u00a0We also decided to try the peach cobbler (the waiter insisted) and not only did it take him about 20 minutes to bring it over but it was in a paper cup and tasted a little like tar (yes, tar).

Ever since living in Long Beach during my college days I'd hit Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles on Broadway and just enjoy the whole concept of Chicken and Waffles. Gussie's Chicken &amp; Waffles is located in the heart of The Fillmore District in San Francisco.   After hanging out in the Fillmore one beautiful Sunday afternoon I was quite delighted to notice Gussie's Chicken &amp; Waffles which is literally right across the street from 1300 Fillmore (Great Lounge with awesome bar by the way). After being seated promptly I noticed the decor was real subtle with a southern feel. I ordered the \"Fillmore Classic\" which consists of three golden crispy chicken wings, one waffle and two eggs. The chicken was crispy and succulent while not being overcooked. I had my eggs prepared in the scrambled form and they were ok. \u00a0What really took the meal over the top was the waffle. The waffle was delicious. I'm not sure if it was the homemade brown sugar infused syrup or the waffle itself. But the combo of the two made the waffle very enjoyable.  In conclusion, I would definitely come back to Gussie's Chicken &amp; Waffle if you just want to enjoy something different. Don't get me wrong it's not the healthiest of choices, it's southern comfort food that will make you feel like your dining down south.",

It hurts me to write this but, I think Gussie's needs to figure out what kind of place it wants to be  I think I ended up paying like 15 bucks for 2 pieces of chicken, and a waffle. The chicken was great, though the portion could have been more generous. The waffle, I didn't care for. I am not from the South, but I am pretty sure that waffles aren't supposed to taste sour?   I think this restaurant ended up in a sort of awkward in between: it provides neither the culinary experience of a higher end restaurant, nor the value of well prepared comfort food.  Recommendations:  For the experience of a nice restaurant serving excellent fried chicken, I would try Farmer Brown's. For the experience of having excellent fried chicken / comfort food for a good price, I would try Farmer Brown's Little Skillet.  For a somewhat mediocre experience, you could go to Gussies.",

I read the other reviews about the wait, but to my surprise, there was no one there at 8pm. No one. We were obviously quickly seated and was greeted by the nicest guy, Tyrone (?) (hard worker and a really polite gentleman). We grabbed a few beers and ordered the Uptown and Downtown specials. The wait for the food was a little bit long. We didn't mind it as much since we had time to chat. When we received our food, I was quite pleasantly surprised. The waffle was warm and perfect to the touch. Not soggy. Not over done. My breast was ginormous. I mean if this chicken had fake boobs, I was eating them. I would definitely come back when I have the craving but later in the evening to avoid the wait.",

They seem such a rarity in California, that I squealed with delight and started with them. My buddy went the whole chicken and waffles route (and dug it), while I opted for boneless strips. Poultry aside, I think Miss Pearl's Banana Pudding was the star of the show for me. But cockadoodledoo, I'd probably come back and try it again.",

Looking over the menu we decided on:   -Cheese grit cakes appetizer  -Downtown meal  -Fillmore classic  -cornbread   Our waitress took about 15 min to come greet us after we were seated. She apologized and took our order. Immediately upon ordering she thought they were out of the cheese grit cakes so she'd check and let us know. Unfortunately they were out (boo!) so we added a mac and cheese side.   So from other yelpers, I noted that it should take about 15 min for you to get your food. We waited patiently and at 15 min our server arrived with food. YAAY! But wait, its WRONG... well more like it was our neighbors food and not ours. So we kindly passed the food over to the people next door and watched them eat. Our server came by and apologized and checked our order and it was mixed up or something. So we waited.. and waited. Our server came by and gave us a couple corn breads to eat while waiting. And waiting. Finally, she comes back with our food. Now mind you I'm STARVING at this point. I dove into the chicken immediately. It was hot, crispy, thin coat of battering...but.. but... there really wasn't that much flavor. Meh..okay so I try the waffle, its not really crisp but its pretty tasty with the hot syrup.   Anyways, we ate everything (we were starving mind you) and when the bill arrived our server had comped the mac n cheese and corn breads which was totally nice of her.   Gussie's was just alright to me; I'm sure as time progresses the service will get a little better. The crowd and vibe was definitely welcoming and pleasant. If I come back I will update.",

Either they figured it out or all you negative yelpers in the past two years have been dead wrong.  We ordered strategically - if you SPLIT a 1/2 chicken and 2 waffles then it is way cheaper then 2 1/4 chicken dinners with 1 waffle each. \u00a0We up-charged (a whole $0.79 for the onion gravy) AND we ordered 2 biscuits (I am trying to find a GREAT biscuit) AND - pigs that we are - \u00a0we ordered 2 over easy eggs as well. The eggs never arrived \u00a0but frankly that was a good thing since we obviously over-ordered.  We also up-charged to the REAL maple syrup. The waitress wanted us to try the syrup they make there, so she brought that too and it was delish. The waffle flavor we chose was sweet potato and while they were not thick and crispy they were thin and soft and very yummy.  I was thinking they should offer a \"waffle sampler\" on their menu - i regular, 1 sweet potato, 1 red velvet. \u00a0I would order that, yes I would.  It all came to $22 bucks and we were stuffed. I will go back. \u00a0(The chicken fried steak at the table next to us looked great)",

    "review_text": "This place wins for slowest and most inefficient service paired with the most mediocre food I've experienced in my 2 years of living and dining out in SF- that was probably the only remarkable part of our time here.   Sides didn't come out until the meal was nearly over and completely over. My friend ordered a side of eggs that didn't come out until he had finished the rest of his meal - and we'd already waited a long time for the mains to come out. We then had to take the corn bread to go - it wasn't ready until after our bills came.   Chicken was dry and lacked flavor, and that's probably a generous description since I was famished after running that morning and waited a good 40 minutes for a piece of fried chicken on a salad. Our long awaited cornbread (that we took home, since we didn't receive it until after the waitress had taken our bills) was fluffy but lacked corn taste and was overly sweet.   My dining companion ordered the Downtown Special that includes 1 thigh and 1 waffle. The thigh that came out on her plate was the size of a small wing. My other friend who ordered the same thing received a hefty looking thigh. Anyone in the kitchen with eyes could have seen the lack of any chicken worth mentioning on the plate, but instead of sending out a bigger piece or 2 smaller thighs, my friend had to ask the waitress if they'd brought her a wing instead. The waitress then apologized for the small size of the thigh and brought out a 2nd tiny thigh for her after another 15 minute wait.   It seemed that any request we made took at least 15 to 20 minutes to complete. We had to flag down someone who wasn't our waitress to run our cards because our server disappeared after giving us the bill.  Would be better off braving the wilds of Oakland, or even going to Popeye's (down the street) for fried chicken instead.",

I was expecting to just have a hint of sweet potato flavor in them, but they actually put sweetened pieces of them throughout the whole waffle. The sides were very tasty as well, and the peach cobbler was steaming hot (sadly they were out of ice cream so no a la mode, but it was late), scrumptious and HUGE!

My boyfriend got the Southern Plate, which consisted of greens, mac n cheese, fried chicken, corn bread and yams. The yams! They literally melt in your mouth. I've never been too big on yams, but these are delicious. My boyfriend didn't let me pick anything else off his plate because he devoured it. He LOVED their mac n cheese, and the greens. I got the chicken and waffles, oh and it wad good too. The waffles were big and fluffy, almost like a pancake. The fried chicken was cripsy and seasoned so well that the flavor ran through the whole piece of chicken. Every single bite had flavoring. We also shared some catfish nuggets, which had the best breading I've ever eaten. Overall this place is awesome, and I have been recommending it to all my friends.",

AND the waffles was MIA meaning they didn't have it as part of the buffet, instead when we asked about it, it was an additional $4.99 per order. Drinks are not included in the buffet (which they didn't tell us either), for that kind of gauging, they should have thrown in the waffles and drinks and omitted something else from the buffet selection.

Found the place and though it was pretty empty at 9:40 am, there were two tables occupied with happy customers. It started to get much busier when we were done eating.  The menu has a nice variety of breakfast items, sandwiches, salads and, of course, waffles with chicken. My brother got the special with eggs and spicy sausage, which I tried and liked.

I'm not saying what a waffle should or shouldn't taste like. To me, there is nothing wrong with a soggy waffle. if you want it less soggy, use less syrup.  so soggy it is. and delicious it also is.  watery syrup - fork out an extra washington and get the real stuff.  i had the sweet potato waffle w/ chicken, side of egg overeasy and a biscuit smothered in grav.  4 stars, all levels satisfied",

I had the Gussie's SF special \u00a0- came with a HUGE chicken breast and a drum stick, 2 eggs, home fries and corn bread. \u00a0The first bite of skin from the breast was great! \u00a0Flavorful and COOKED. \u00a0Key word is COOKED. \u00a0After that, it was all downhill. \u00a0This HUGE breast was not cooked on the inside. \u00a0Second bite was chewy and required a spit out. \u00a0As I cut deeper, I noticed the inside was red and uncooked. \u00a0Not cool Gussie. \u00a0Not cool at all.  I told the waitress who was happy to take the plate away and give me a brand new plate with all new food. \u00a0That was fine except the damage was already done. \u00a0Even though the replacement plate was fine, I could not get past the fact that my first breast was uncooked. \u00a0  That said, the cornbread was average. \u00a0The homefries were average. \u00a0The drumstick was average. \u00a0The Diet Coke was above average, but simply because I used it to wash the uncooked taste out.  Overall, I expected more. \u00a0Service was great, however. \u00a0My server was very nice, attentive and willing to make things right. \u00a0I wish that the service was able to make up for the food, but alas, it did not.

Got there around 7pm and there was no one in front of us and a couple of tables leaving/getting cleaned up. Good thing right? WRONG. A party of three came in about 15 minutes after us and got seated BEFORE us! Host told us they didn't have a table for 2 and gave away a table to a party with ONE additional person. What if we were ordering/eating for three?! That was definitely a first for me. Pretty ridiculous. We ended up having to wait for a good half hour to be seated in the corner BY THE BATHROOM. It looked like they improvised and just shoved a table there. We were joking that they would forget about us, but they totally did. The waitress said so herself when she first came by. Lucky us.The waitress was super nice when she did come around though..so kudos to her, I guess. The table right next to us was pretty unhappy as well. One person's order was forgotten and they demanded to see the mgr. After a long debacle, I think they got some of their dishes comped, but I am sure they would agree that the management and service definitely needs lots improvement.  Food was okay. We got the Taste of the South and the CK &amp; sweet potato waffles. The collard greens were pretty good but the ratio of greens and mac&amp;cheese to candied yams was off. Way oo much candied yams and it wasn't separated, so everything on the plate was basically sweet and soggy. The waffles were super thin and pretty soggy. Reviews said they were fluffy so maybe we got a bad batch? I don't know. I think my over experience there was just a bad one. Would probably try other places before ever considering coming back here. Been to a few other spots, including Roscoe's and this was by far my least favorite. Maybe in a year or so, when my first time here becomes a little fuzzy. I'm sure the food here is pretty good, but definitely not worth the lack of service and inefficiency.   SORRY FOR THE RANT.",

I will be back to Gussie's. \u00a0For any meal. \u00a0It's nice to know that they also have vegan options as well for my animal loving friends. \u00a0However, I'll be over here eating the chicken and whatever else I can find.",

Sounding good already right?   Alright where to start....... oh yes the negative. Their famous fried chicken was really dry, the gravy was bland (tasted like water and corn starch mixture with no seasoning), and the waffles were thin and dry. They were pretty unorganized as well. There were six of us and our entrees came 3 at a time with about a ten minute gap between each. I mean our server was really nice and the cocktails were good which made up for it a little bit but the experience there was just ok at best.   I've never had fried chicken and waffles before but I know when food isn't that good. It's one of those places that you'll just have to try to say that you've been before but don't expect phenomenal food or service.",

    "review_text": "So, I decided to have a visit to San Francisco recently to see a bunch of friends and they decided to go to Gussie's Chicken and Waffles for dinner. \u00a0This is the 2nd place I've been to which carries chicken and waffles after Roscoe's down south. \u00a0While this place will not beat going to my mom for chicken, it does carry enough high points to impress me.  From what I remembered, the service was great. \u00a0Now, because I ate out the 3 days prior, I tried what I could to really limit my spending here. \u00a0Thank goodness I did not go over my limit thought of $20. (I stopped at around $15 if I remember correctly.)  I kind of wish that they didn't bring out water cups right from the get-go because while I wanted mine without ice, there was ice in mine, and since it's San Francisco, I didn't want my water to be that cold. \u00a0So, I ended up with lemonade minus the cubes. \u00a0Figuring that I should get a vegetable, I started with the home fries and it's good that there are bits of onions because having just straight out potatoes would have soured the experience a real good amount personally. \u00a0After that, I got the Downtown Special. \u00a0While the waffle's buttermilk perfection for me, the chicken, as decent as it is, felt a bit over cooked.  If you like chicken and waffles, Gussie's is pretty ideal. \u00a0My friends and I were treated well and the food for the most part was good. \u00a0The place does have inconsistencies, but it's a place in which I can say I'm a fan of.  +: There's the great service and the food for the most part is great.  -: The inconsistencies like the chicken are problematic.",

So I can't say I'm a good judge of this particular cuisine, but I definitely enjoyed my meal here... I had the Fillmore Special, which is one classic waffle with three fried chicken wings and scrambled eggs. The waffle was great; their home-made brown sugar syrup can kick Aunt Jemima to the curb... Actually, I like it better than the organic Maple Syrup I get from the Farmer's Market, it's that good. The chicken is awesome, not too greasy, nice texture and crunch but succulent and juicy on the inside.

The waffle is soft and crepe-like and the fried chicken was fantastic. The chicken coating was crunchy and the flesh was moist and delicious. It would have been nice if it came with biscuits or fries or something, but 1/2 fried chicken and two waffles ($18) was enough for two people.   One thing to be aware of is that they just opened and the place is a madhouse because everyone is really excited to eat here. The staff is nice and efficient, but they are still figuring things out.

My waitress was courteous and attentive (for the most part - there was a short period where I could have used more coffee, but whatever) and very helpful with the menu and specials. I ordered the Southern Comfort which is comprised of 2 waffles, 1 drumstick, 1 thigh &amp; 2 scrambled eggs with cheddar and green onions. My order took a little while to land on the table but that should come as no surprise -- fresh fried chicken is not something to be rushed -- I'd rather have it done right than done quickly. After loading my waffles up with their whipped butter and brown sugar syrup I made my move on the drumstick. The chicken was fantastic! The lightly battered chicken was crispy on the outside and moist, tender and delicious on the inside. The waffles were lightly crunchy, sweet and super yummy.

There's another newer \"hipster\" joint that does the chicken and waffles that does a great 4 star job too.  The value just isn't here.

I have to admit that I was buzzed when we got here so I'm not sure if everything we ate was good because I actually enjoyed the flavors OR if I was just buzzed.  The chicken was good. Nice and tender and lightly battered. I don't like overly fried chicken. I had corn with my meal. The corn was a little on the dry side. The cornbread was good.   We also ordered the catfish nuggets. Those were really good. They also were lightly battered with tender catfish. Not to mention the grits cake. That was also pretty yummy as well.   Great place for having greasy food after alcohol :) I still don't know which is better... Roscoe's or Gussie's. It's been awhile since I've had Roscoe's.",

The wait was a bit too long and our service was a bit sloppy.And she kept calling me darlin, and that is NOT okay. You are what, a year older than me!? You cannot pull off the old endearing waitress at the fatty foods restaurant, especially when you look like when your shift ends here your shift at Hooters starts. The food is pretty damn tasty but I would be a whole lot more excited if it wasn't so damn expensive. I paid like $17 for 2 pieces of small chicken, 2 waffles and macaroni and cheese. Given I have paid $5 for 2 pieces of large chicken and a waffle- this is kind of ridiculous.   Good food, weird vibe, bad prices.",

Coming in on a Sunday I expect a place to be busier than a Tuesday, but the amount of waiting which I had to do was really unexpected. The waiting began at the door when my friends and I weren't greeted for a few minutes as the host talked with what looked to be another customer. The host eventually glanced over at us and said hi and continued talking with the woman. Eventually, after a few minutes of waiting and no one else coming up to help us, the customer left and the host apologized for the wait. Then she took some menus and turned the corner to discover that the place was pretty full so she said it may be a few more minutes. As we were waiting she said we could sit at the bar if we liked. Given that we were all very hungry and are quite agreeable and easy going people, we took it. The host woman sort of acted as our server. We asked for a round of waters, and also ordered a few drinks. Over five minutes later the two drinks show up, no water. The server/host woman then sort of goes \"the water\" and then a few minutes later a busser brings one water to the person who didn't order a drink. We ask him for two more, they show up in seconds. The busser was the only person who seemed to do things in a reasonable manner of time. Eventually we order our food with an appetizer to start, since we were extremely hungry at this point. The appetizer never showed. When the food finally came, we didn't even have settings at the table. They forgot my friends eggs, the syrup container. Our table was never cleaned. TERRIBLE. NEVER GOING BACK.",

The inside is a nice, clean, sit-down restaurant.  They were out of catfish, but the waiter said the chicken was better anyway, so we both got the Uptown Special -- 1 breast + 1 waffle ($9.29). Our food arrived really quickly, which was great because we were starving. The waffle was fine. The outside of the chicken was crispy, but the inside was lukewarm and super dry -- so it seems like it'd been sitting out for a while, which explains why it came out so fast. It probably would've been fresher if we came when it was crowded. The breast also had the giant piece of bone in it, which was surprising, and made it really hard to eat.   The service was really good, and there was definitely a lot of chicken, but overall the quality was just lacking. I kind of want to try the catfish, and see if the chicken gets any better, but only if a friend really wants to come. 900 Grayson really needs to come across the Bay to San Francisco.",

    "review_text": "First, the food. We decided that splitting one of the larger meals and ordering sides between two people was best for us, so we got the half fried chicken with 2 waffles, 2 wings (for $2 on Tuesdays), and sides of fries, honey cornbread, and rice and beans. I liked that you can specify if you want the half chicken to be all white or dark meat. The chicken was... ok. \u00a0It was decently tasty, although the seasoning didn't really stand out. It was pretty dry, which was disappointing. I found the drumsticks to be standard size but agree with others that the thighs were smaller than mutant supermarket chicken - however, the wings were substantially larger than what I'm used to. Yeah, the waffles aren't Belgian, which is fine, and they're better than eggos... but not all that much better. They seemed to have a hint of nutmeg, which was nice. I was a bit confused about the portions of the sides. The bowl of french fries was enormous and more than enough for two people, while the rice and beans came out in this tiny cup (the beans were fine but the rice below was bad - too wet and reminiscent of minute rice!). The honey cornbread was probably the best value - three large chunks of pretty tasty cornbread for $0.99! In an unexpected note, the apple juice is actually quite good.  We received outstanding service from the moment we stepped in the restaurant, when we were promptly seated, until we left (at our leisure, after the host had stopped by and chatted with us about how everything was). Our waitress stopped by very frequently and was quite polite about how long we took to order. My soda was refilled constantly, and our orders were taken down with no errors (which obviously I expect, but I'm just adding given that others have not had the same experience). Now, we were there when the restaurant was only a quarter full, so I don't know what it would be like when it's crowded.  I found this place to be immensely convenient for a pre-Yoshi's dinner, but the food was bordering on mediocre. I might go back before another show there, but otherwise probably wouldn't.",

Nestled in the heart of the ever-changing Fillmore District gussies has been a cornerstone of that Community for authentic &amp; classic soul food cuisines. Everything that you would love about soul food is here. From chicken waffles, (which happens to be a very popular item on the menu), too collard greens, catfish, red beans and rice, and even some of the best desserts. here's another wonderful surprise, if you went during the lunchtime hour, which was from 12 PM to 2 PM, you were fortunate to take part in the all-you-can-eat soul food buffet. There wasn't any restaurants in San Francisco that had an all-you-can-eat Soul food buffet. In my mind that's what put Gussies over the top and made it one of the best. But unfortunately ever since the mid part of the year 2013, the food and the quality of that food has gone down tremendously.   The first thing that stands out is the fact that they no longer offer the all-you-can-eat buffet for the lunchtime crowd. The catfish was way too salty, the red beans and rice tasted like mush flavored with beans. My favorite and most popular dish was the mac &amp; cheese and unfortunately it's now dry and not as fresh &amp; cheesy as it once was. Even catching deals off of the popular app Groupon, hasn't helped it to recover and go back to its once popular and glorious status.  I could've just gone in on an off day but in my head this place isn't what it used to be. Don't get me wrong the service is still great the atmosphere is still pleasant but if you're going to a soul food restaurant you want the food to stand out. And unfortunately it no longer does at gussies chicken &amp; waffles.",

Our bored waitress could barely muster a smile when she came by to take our order and to check on us. Perhaps she was having a bad day, so I'll move on to the food. The sweet potato fries lacked sweetness on the inside along with seasoning and crispness on the outside. Our waffles were sad and thin looking. Mine even had a slight wave on the edges. If you're looking for a thick golden waffle, this is not the place! My single drumstick that accompanied said waffle was crispy on the outside but a little dry on the inside. The syrup was disappointingly thin and watery. They should have just called it sugar water instead! Had I known, I would have payed the extra cost for the maple syrup. Since I was starving, I drizzled the \"syrup\" all over my waffle and proceeded to chow down. The one positive aspect about a thin waffle is that the syrup soaks right through and saturates the whole thing so I can spend more time eating and less time dipping. I also noticed that my waffle had a hint of cinnamon to it which I liked. However, the next time I'm craving chicken and waffles, I'll be heading elsewhere.",

    "review_text": "The good: The food here is awesome! The chicken is deliciously moist and flavorful and the waffles were yummy (not thick like Belgian waffles, but whoever heard of Belgian waffles in the South?!). The collard greens were also good (the soupiness someone else mentioned is the pot liquor, a lot of people from the south like to drink it as a special treat, or at least that's what my Southern relatives tell me).  The bad: The silverware is airplane silverware. It cuts absolutely nothing and you can barely cut your waffle with it. Even though my waffle was slathered with butter and syrup, I was tempted to pick it up with my hands because the silverware is so ridiculously unsharp. Please, please, please purchase some real knives. Did you inherit them from Powell's Place? Was IKEA having a sale on ineffective silverware? WTF?! Seriously, the safety scissors I had in preschool were sharper than Gussie's knives.  The ugly: Our server, while friendly and apologetic (name withheld since he was so nice), managed to mess up on almost every aspect of our meal. He came to take our drink orders ten seconds after we sat down. I was still taking my jacket off when he came over. Um, give us a chance to look at the menu...  Fast forward to our ordering. I suspect that he only wrote down half of what we said. I ordered an Uptown Special with a sweet tea and a side of collard greens. My friend ordered the Fillmore Classic with a side order of drumsticks. Our food arrives after a bit of a wait, I get receive the Downtown Special instead of the Uptown Special (essentially drumstick and thigh instead of a breast piece) a very obvious mistake that he should have caught when picking up the order. My friend got her order fairly perfectly but did not get her side of drumsticks until asked. Then we realize that I have butter for my waffle but she does not, and neither of us has any syrup. A little while later, I realize that I still don't have the sweet tea I ordered. He fixed all mistakes with a smile and an apology and remedied each as quickly as possible. But they're such basic mistakes. When 90% of your menu consists of waffles you should train the staff to bring the syrup out with every table order, because the chances of there being a party in which no one needed syrup would be fairly small.   Lastly, although the syrup is delicious, it is a little thin, both my dining companion and I were mislead into expecting it to be thicker and therefore pour more slowly. I ended up pouring slightly more than I would have liked, while she over poured by a lot, spilling syrup on the table. If the syrup isn't standard thickness, I think it should be served in the little metal sauce cups and be dipped rather than poured.  In conclusion, great food, bring your own silverware and don't expect good (or even average) service. Would I go back? Definitely. I wonder if they offer takeout...

Now on to the food. I ordered the FilMore classic (3 fried chicken wings, waffle and two scrambled eggs). The food was less than mediocre. For starters, the waiter did not supply us with utensils prior to bringing the food out, the chicken was barely room temperature and seemed to have been sitting out for a while, the waffle was a bit spongy and the eggs were soggy! It was by far the worst meal of my entire 4.5 day vacation and we definitely won't be back! On a better note, the hubby said the fish and grits were \"okay\".

Starting with the fried cheese grits bites, with the delectable jalapeno dipping sauce right on down to the \"Taste of the South\" entr\u00e9e. The yams were wonderfully sweet and earthy, complimented by a deliciously cheesy mac &amp; cheese and collard greens that were dripping with flavor -- literally! The fried chicken was just superb! Initially, I thought to give a four star ranking, solely on the basis of the portion size, as I thought the sides were a tad too small, but then I had that ranch dressing! Sweet baby Jesus that dressing SLAYED me! As a self proclaimed ranch dressing connoisseur, I know a good ranch dressing when I taste it!   Don't walk, yet run, swiftly to Gussie's!",

Definitely an A+ given my roomie's comment that the fried breast was dry. As for the waffles, they were good - nothing blow your mind away amazing, but solid.   So with the above, you're probably thinking... um... why not 4 stars. well i docked one star off for the service. Now, the people who work there are definitely nice and you feel like you are at your homegirl's spot for post-church brunch. the problem lies in the speed and attentiveness of service. every step of our dining experience was just unjustifiably slow (the place was maybe 1/3rd full) -- from ordering, to checking up on us, giving us the bill, giving us to go boxes, etc... kind of annoying. furthermore, i just don't think the wait staff was very attentive. they got two orders at my table wrong. roomie 1 ordered a coke, and it never came, yet it was on the final bill -____-. roomie 2 ordered chicken strips and waffle fries, which was supposed to come with honey mustard dipping sauce... that also never came. we wanted dessert to share, so agreed on peach cobbler with a scoop of ice cream on top. you guessed it... the dish came out with no ice cream and only one spoon. oh .... thanks.   so yea... lackluster service and standard food. i do want to try these red velvet waffles, so will probably be back though i'm inclined to get it to go next time.",

A more attentive waiter would have earned his tip. This guy basically got charity. Also, not impressed with the cleanliness of the bathroom. Not the worst, but not the best.

After the water damage, they reopened with a new menu, items, etc. I would MUCH rather have the food the way it was before. I usually get the Fillmore Classic, 3 wings and a waffle. Fortunately they gave me 4 wings, but they were puny and didn't taste like much. Waffle was crispy and good. I tried their bacon gravy for the first time because the server recommended it, but the regular gravy that I used to get is better in my opinion. Bf got the Sunday's best and chose Mac n cheese and smothered potatoes. It also came with corn bread, all of which were pretty good! I also ordered an extra waffle for him. 20 minutes later our food finalllllly arrives, but not that extra waffle. We had to share my one waffle while waiting for the other one to come out. After 10 minutes, I ask for the waffle because she probably forgot. Then it took ANOTHER 10 minutes for the waffle... Just one waffle!! We almost finished our food by then. Paying was another waiting game. I asked one of the gentlemen for the check and also said I had a groupon to use, he says ok he'll tell the server. 10 minutes pass, I'm looking around for them and he comes back to the table, and I have to remind him I have a group on. He THEN tells the server and she finally comes over after a little while.  Food - 3.5ish stars Service 1.5 stars, being nice.",

The menu is pretty diverse, \u00a0with 1/3 of it being dedicated to different permutations of chicken and waffles (one small drumstick one waffle $8) however the don't come with any sides and the sides are expensive as fuck. I ordered the baked Mac n Cheese which, to be fair, was awesome, but it was $5 for an amount the side of a really small scoop of ice cream, in my opinion not really worth it.  The interior design is totally akward and non-fitting, with marble counter tops and blown glass sculptures, it seems like someone just mismanaged their start up capital and are trying to offset it by charging $14 for a waffle and some chicken.

We sat down I went to the bathroom, came back and asked my sister did anyone come by yet she said no just the guy with water. There were literally 4 tables including ours, with 2-3 people at each and 3 waiters and we still had not been served . We waited for about 15 minutes , trying to make eye contact with all the waiters but yet we still got passed. I'm not sure if because we were young (older than 21 younger than 25) that the waiters were worried that we would not tip or something but we were clearly being avoided.   Thank GOD for COLE!!!!!!!! He came and attended to us and was just one of the best servers I've ever had. By the end of this DELICIOUS meal (the food is always good, by the way!!!) I had forgotten the shunning we received earlier.   Thank you Cole!!!   I know waiters have set areas but just for your reference...when we sat down the table behind us was empty then 10 minutes later \u00a0a couple sat down and maybe a minute in a waiter came and took their order and brought drinks about 5 min after their order.  I will acknowledge that this is my opinion and feelings, of course I know the staff may not feel like there was no age discrimination in play and that's ok. It was just my experience .  P.S.

Not only is fried chicken one of my most favorite things and guilty pleasures, I'm a huge critic when it comes to my chicken, and when I was introduced to this place, it was so good that we got it to go and ate it in the car before even getting to our destination. Pretty ridiculous. Then the next time I went, with a huge group of friends, I got introduced to the banana pudding and sweet tea, wow. I didn't even think I liked banana pudding until I had this. Amazing. So in short, probably one of the best fried chicken and waffles places I've ever been to, and the sweet tea and banana pudding are necessary when you go. Changed my life.   And for you losers complaining about the service, relax, it's a soul food family spot, you can't rush a good thing, just appreciate the damn good food when it comes to you and stop bitching.",

Heaven the taste bud tantalizing intermingling of sweet and savory flavors that comes with pairing fried chicken and waffles. Delicious! The waffle was still crispy served with sweet cream whipped butter and warm homemade brown sugar syrup. For an additional $1.00, one can get pure maple syrup, get the pure stuff. \u00a0The chicken was super tender on the inside and nicely seasoned and crisp on the exterior. Supremely good.  What southern meal would be complete without cornbread..ooohhh the Honey Cornbread was fluffy and divine! The Mac n Cheese was on the dry side and had a pasty gooey texture but surprisingly it tasted good! Yum! Loved the hush puppies with the jalapeno artichoke remoulade was a good combination.

We made a couple substitutions, on the Southern Comfort, I had asked for over easy eggs instead of scrambled with the cheddar cheese and onions on top and to substitute one waffle for the red velvet waffle. With the Taste of the South, we had asked for the candied yams to be substituted with corn. When the order came out the substitutions came out with one mistake, the over easy eggs were over well and there was no cheddar cheese or onions. No worries, I'm watching my physique anyways. No not really, I wanted cheddar cheese and onions on top or else I wouldn't have requested that they be there in the first place!  The food itself was pretty standard but a few disappointments. The fried chicken was dry and flavorless. I rather walk around the corner and hit up Popeye's for their chicken. The mac and cheese had a hard burnt layer of cheese on top. And to top it off, their tap water wasn't even iced. Hooray for luke warm water!  Service wasn't thaaat bad, it took 10 mins to get the check and another 10 to get the change with the place being half full. Good thing I came here with an old friend and we were busy catching up or else the wait would have been a problem.",

One, the service is very friendly. Even when our order was accidentally, screwed up, they left the food they brought so that we wouldnt be hungry and later brought out what we actually ordered. Additionally, the order was only screwed up because the waiter graciously allowed us to make changes to the combo a member of the party order without charging us extra. That is good service.  Two, the food is great! the chicken was fresh and very crispy. And the sweet potato waffles are the business, and a must have. Desert portions are tremendous. We ordered a slice of the peach cobbler and it could feed at least 3 people! I damn near think they brought the whole pie out but it was just a slice.  Three, Gussie's isnt super expensive. Dishes are around $10-12 bucks which is great.  Four, location, location, location. Gussie's is about a 30 sec walk from 1300 Filmore and Yoshi's. And a short walk from other Filmore spots like Sheba and the Kabuki. If you have a night out on Filmore, Gussie's is a great place to start before moving onto a show or whatever.

I went on a Sunday, which I had never done before. I expected it to be crazy busy, no surprise there. When we entered the resturaunt, no one greated us or took our name so we just waited in line to be seated which took about 30 minutes. Finally seated in the corner and was not assigned a waiter or waitress. We had to ask someone for water after twenty minutes of waiting. Then, after another twenty minutes we finally decided to summon someone over to take our order. AN HOUR AND A HALF GOES BY and our food is still not out and no one has refilled our drinks or come by to apologize or just even check on us...by this point the resturaunt has thinned out and is not very busy. This is where it gets absolutely unacceptable....Finally I call someone over and ask how much longer and the male waiter says another thirty minutes. His excuse was that the one waffle iron was down and it would of been quicker if we ordered pancakes or something else. THANKS BRO, THAT EXPLANATION WOULD OF BEEN HELPFUL TWO HOURS AGO?!!! We decide to leave and without an apology or any sense or urgency from the Gussie's staff. It was, hands down, the worst experience I have ever had at any business.

Real southern looking spot and something about it just made me feel like I was with family (one half of it anyways).   Ordered the Taste of the South (~$14) which had EVERYTHING I was craving on one plate (without the peach cobbler). One huge chicken breast, one wing, mac n cheese, greens, sweet potatoes, and corn bread.   Fries chicken - not greasy at all which was a big plus, but the skin wasn't very crispy. Flavor was there, with the addition of some hot sauce, but what's chicken without it  Mac n cheese - my standards are so high when it comes to this. Baked mac n cheese gave it a good rating in my book, but it wasn't my fave. Nobody can beat my grandma's  Greens - heaven in my mouth. No pieces of bacon that I saw, but the flavor was definitely reminiscent of last Thanksgiving  Sweet potatoes - perfect! Soft and buttery and sweet, just how they should be  Corn bread - moist, but nothing to brag about, but much better than the one at Hard Knox though.   I did want to get the peach cobbler, but again, my standards would be raised so high that it'd be unfair.. Plus I didn't want to spend $6 but maybe next time!",

Gussies was easily able to handle our group. Our table started with the Okra Appetizer which is breaded and deep fried and served with a spicy mayo dipping sauce. The order was generous and hot.  Since it was late I did not want to have a full dinner but I did want fried chicken so I ordered the Fried Chicken sandwich with a side of crinkled sweet potato fries. The sandwich is served on a roll with lettuce, tomato and onion; it's a large sandwich with a generous chicken breast but lacked flavor. It needed something, maybe a bbq sauce? I used the dipping sauce from the fried Okra which in my opinion made a good sandwich even better. I washed it down with a pint of Sam Adams on draught.  One of my table mates ordered the waffles to share with our table. I'm sorry to say the waffles were flat, quickly became soggy from the syrup and the syrup had a strange aftertaste that made me regret taking the first bite.   The Lower Fillmore which is where Gussies is located has a lot to offer with Cinema, live music, and Imperial Spa located near by, great little neighborhood that is served by several MUNI lines.",

My love affair with chicken and waffles dates back to the first time I had Roscoe's Chicken &amp; Waffles in the early 90s. When I heard about Gussies opening in San Francisco, I was skeptical given the mediocrity of similar endeavors in the Bay Area. Hearing the owner of Roscoe's was behind Gussies was cause for higher expectations.  The quality of the two signature items were top notch. The waffles were fluffy with a crispness at its edges. The buckwheat waffles satisfy while the sweet potato waffles really knocked my palette on its proverbial backside. For a more decadent flavor, try a buckwheat waffle drizzled with sweet potato syrup. The flavorful chicken had a juicy center (I usually go with a breast and drumstick). As for other sides, the cornbread gets solid marks. The Soju cocktail menu is another unique offering from them.  The price points don't exactly scream \"bargain\", but there is a Happy Hour on Tuesdays afternoon for the budget-conscious. The decor/spacing isn't optimal either, but neither detracted from the bottom line: the food.  All told, Gussies has replaced Roscoe's as my favorite chicken and waffle joint.

    "review_text": "One of the best fried chicken I've had; crispy and un-oily skin, moist and tender on the inside. What I ordered what was the Uptown Special ($9.29): one chicken breast and one waffle. \u00a0My sister got the Country Style Breakfast ($9.99). \u00a0  Reservations accepted for parties of 6 or more. \u00a0I read that this place can get packed so I wanted to be prepared. \u00a0Instead of reservations, we came about 20 minutes prior to their opening time to ensure we have breakfast at a reasonable time before starting our food crawl. \u00a0  My sister is the type that never ventures out by herself so I figured I should take her to a) try this place because I have a Groupon for it and b) to show her around. \u00a0I'm not a San Franciscan however, I go quite frequently and used to live there. Plus you can't go wrong w/ San Francisco as there are so many things to do, so many things to see, and so many things to eat.  This was stop #1. \u00a0  A very modern and upscale restaurant but unfortunately it lacked service and speed. \u00a0We waited over 2 minutes to be greeted (it wasn't packed at the time), we waited over 5 minutes to have someone come to our table - I got up to ask for someone, and we waited forever for our to-go boxes and check. \u00a0The lady that took our order was very nice and very sincere and she did check on us once but we were left to fend for ourselves pretty much.  This experience would have been a 4 if service matched the taste and quality of the dishes. \u00a0I liked that the maple syrup was thinner than usual and had a hint of vanilla in it. \u00a0I liked what I ordered very much but I wouldn't come back. \u00a0  It would be faster if I went to the store, prepped, and made the food myself...",

I was worried about long waits so we went at 5:30pm and the whole place was more or less empty. \u00a0By the time we left at 7:00pm the dining room was mostly full. \u00a0The hostess and waiter said they got swamped during the breakfast//brunch rush and they expect it to be just as busy right around 7:30pm. \u00a0If you want breakfast, the hostess recommended going between 7-9am. \u00a0Basically, go during off peak hours if you don't want a wait. \u00a0  Now for the food, we started with cheddar cheese grit cakes and the fried okra. \u00a0The cheddar cheese grit cakes came with jalapeno butter and were great. \u00a0The fried okra was standard fried okra, but I wasn't amazed by it. \u00a0I doubt I'd order the fried okra again. \u00a0For entrees, we had taste of the south, 1/2 southern fried chicken and two waffles, fried chicken breast sandwich with a side of gravy, and two orders a la carte of sweet potato waffle + fried chicken breast. \u00a0I'd say that's one great thing, they have all these combination plates but you can also create your own creations by putting together a la carte items. \u00a0The fried chicken was great - one person said it's the best fried chicken he's had (personal preference I think). \u00a0I got mine smothered in gravy, but I think next time, I'll get the gravy on the side that way the chicken stays crispy, but I can still have gravy. \u00a0The waffles were also quite proper and the sweet potato waffles are a unique item on the menu (at least I've never seen it before). \u00a0  All the food was on point, almost everyone finished everything on their plate (I couldn't quite finish the massive piece of fried chicken breast.) - don't get me wrong, the portions are quite generous, the food was just that tasty. \u00a0We were all discussing what we'd get on our next visit. \u00a0 \u00a0  For dessert we had the banana pudding and red velvet cake. \u00a0We tried to get the peach cobbler, but they were all out so they comped us an order of red velvet cake (talk about wonderful service). \u00a0The banana pudding was good, but a little too sweet for my taste. \u00a0The red velvet cake was quite moist and done right with cream cheese frosting. \u00a0(On a side note - the sweet tea was great.) \u00a0  I'll definitely be back to explore more of their menu.",

I forgot the name of the combo I ordered, but it came with 2 pieces of fried chicken, one waffle, and 2 eggs (cooked any way you like) The chicken was like any other fried chicken, but it wasn't very greasy. I got my eggs completely fried and it was completely lacking in any taste, which I guess could be a good thing because it allows the eater to add as much/less salt as they want. The waffle was the most disappointing, it was thin and very mushy. I would love to have my waffles thick and crunchy.  I got to sample a few other things that other people had ordered. The potato salad was pretty good, and I'm not the biggest fan of cheese, but the part of the mac and cheese that wasn't overloaded with heavy cheese was good too. I also really liked the fried catfish with tartare sauce. \u00a0The catfish was lightly fried, so it wasn't too breaded or heavy, and the green tartare sauce seems to have some dill mixed in that provided a really nice flavor for dipping the fish in.  I also had one of the strawberry soju-tinis which I really liked and its fairly prices too. I wouldn't mind coming here for happy hour to try out the rest of the drinks.  We came here on a Wednesday so it wasn't packed at all. The food took awhile to come out and is slightly on the pricier side. I'm willing to try out more \"chicken and waffles\" but I don't think I would come here for that combination again.",

I often dream, daydream. and rave about two things at this joint:  #1 - Sweat Potato Waffles Succulent! Succulent! Succelent! The portion is huge -- plate huge. I ate each juicy bite with my eyes closed. The dish was about $13, but I would easily throw down a twamp for this! EASY. I recommend this dish to all my amigos.   #2 - Banana Pudding You get a volleyball-sized bowl of this. ITs HUGE. Easily can be split between 4 people. It's nice on the palette. Soft. Light. Just the right amount of sweet. It will definitely become your staple if you become a regular here.  I LOVE GUSSIE's. Can't wait to go back.  Atmosphere:  Kick back and comfortable. No prissies.

The greens were great with a little bit of red pepper flake in them, the mac/cheese was good (though I wish the portion was a little bigger) and the potatoes were good too. The flavor of the corn bread was good, but it was a little dry so I didn't eat it.   Mrs. had the chicken strip salad with home made ranch dressing. The waitress said \"we make it here\" about the dressing. The salad was good size for a lunch portion and the strips were good. The ranch was AWESOME! When I asked the waitress about it, she said that they do not use any kind of powder mix or base.. it is buttermilk ranch from scratch!  We also shared a waffle (had to have it for my chicken of course) which was also very good and cooked perfectly.   FYI, they had a buffet going on for lunch but we did not look at it.

I don't see what the big deal about chickens and waffle is. The chicken was a bit too dry for me. The Omelet was HUGE. I had enough to take home and eat for breakfast the next day, but I wouldn't get this dish again because the potatoes were too salty for me. I also like homefries with my omelet and not scalloped potatoes. The only thing mentionable at this place is their waffles. They were one of the best waffles I've ever tasted and I don't like waffles ( I'm a pancake fan). There must be something special about their batter. All three of us agreed that the waffles were the best part of the meal. If I were to come back, I'd skip the chicken and head for the waffles.   Service was great! The hostess kept reassuring that we were next and kept apologizing for the delay. The waitress accidentally gave me a biscuit instead cornbread.

Things didn't go as planned when my carry-outs weren't ready. After waiting 20 minutes (and admiring the place's decor, vibe and atmosphere), I receive my take-outs and check for the requested substitutions (sweet potato and red velvet waffles for the original waffles) and sides (honey cornbread). They were missing but Gussie's had no qualms fixing it. So, I finally get my substituted waffles but they still forgot to pack the cornbread. The lady apologies, gives me the cornbread, and explains they were training new hirees. (Good for them!) To endear their customers, they didn't replace but gave me the original waffles at no charge in addition to the gourmet waffles. That alone deserves +1 star.  Now, onto the food. Depending on how large of a chicken breast you get, it can be either on the slightly drier or moister side. And depending on how famished you are (and the sensitivity of your taste buds), you might find the breast meat to be a bit bland or has just the right amount of flavor. They serve soft waffles and its texture and consistency reminded me of mochi or other similar glutinous rice flour products. I was disappointed how the original, sweet potato and red velvet waffles tasted practically the same, so I wouldn't recommend \"upgrading\" to these or the other varieties (corn meal, banana pecan, vegan buckwheat). Their sugar-free syrup isn't thick but has the right amount of sweetness and has a hint of citrus flavor. Their honey cornbread is really moist and delicious. Overall, the food that is their namesake wasn't bad but it didn't \"WOW\" me either, so I give it 3 stars.",

Friendly staff but too much standing around for a busy restaurant. Had to wait to get a refill on the ice tea and the place is not as clean. When I touched the ketchup, I got syrup all over my hands because they do not pay attention to details of being clean.   Food came out after I asked how long it would take for us to get our food. We waited about 40 minutes. When the food arrived I had to ask if a biscuit came with my meal and the response was I do not know! LOL!!! But was kind enough to get me one like it was owed to me. The fried chicken was not bad. It was tasty but almost dry. Wasn't too salty or greasy. Not a fan of their grits. There was clumps in my grits and overwhelming butter flavor. Now the GREENS, was my favorite. I will come back just for the Greens. \u00a0Also to try their waffles.  Here is the killer!!!! They had homemade Sangria sitting at the bar barely covered in room temperature. Sitting in a tub with no ice. Someone ordered a glass from the dining area and as soon as they lifted the cover, fruit FLIES flew out of it. My friend who is a liquor distributor saw that and later on mentioned it as we walked out.   That was a killer of the experience. But the staff are friendly........",

A party of 2 arrived after us and also ordered after us. \u00a0 I don't really know how or why their food came first before ours, they seemed to order the same dishes as us sans the burger.   In our opinion, we were waiting for an unreasonable amount of time. By the time we just got up and left, that party of two were practically done with their meal.  I talked to the manager and said we were leaving because the food was taking too long. \u00a0 She had an attitude and said that we've been only waiting for 20 minutes, which was a lie. \u00a0 I was texting a friend after we ordered and the time stamp showed over 30 minutes. \u00a0 She specifically said that it was the burger taking long to cook which is BS because how do burgers take longer than chicken to cook?  Either way, the manager did not apologize for the long wait and seriously had an attitude.   I don't understand how a business can be run so unprofessionally like that. \u00a0 I mean, it was pretty clear that our food was taking long, and \u00a0it wasn't busy at all so at least give the courtesy of letting us know what the delay was.

They have a small room inside for banquets or parties.  AMBIENCE - very comfortable, it's definitely NOT a \"hole\" in the wall. In fact it might be an upscale hole in the wall. The noise level was extremely loud at times probably because they were busting dishes near our table. There was music playing coupled with the loud dishes made it a little difficult to have a conversation.  PRICE - average plates range from $10-16  QUALITY - I had the chicken n waffle plate substituting 1 of the waffles for a specialy waffle (Red Velvet). I'm so glad I did. The substitutions are $1.25 extra but well worth it. The red velvet also had cream cheese butter. Waffles are served with hot syrup so it'll melt the butter. \u00a0My brother ordered the sweet potatoe waffle and it also is extremely good. If you like sweet potatoe, this is a must try and is also their signature waffle.  SERVICE - this one of the areas I thought could use some improvement. Our server was really nice however, we didn't see her too often and we kept having to ask for refills, napkins, etc.  Overall I had a great experience for my first time.

I was afraid there may be a long line of anxious people waiting to get their chicken &amp; waffles fix in SF. Surprisingly, no wait! I'm not going to nitpick at the little things (i.e., wait times), given the fact that it is a new restaurant and they're still working out details. I'll give 'em a little slack for that.  Now on to the food...Looking at the menu it was hard to decide! So many things to try, plus they had Soju cocktails! I decided on the Downtown Special (1pc. Chicken, 2 waffles) and lemonade. I figured I'd try their specialty especially since I've never had these two together. The chicken was delish! Just the right amount of seasonings and crispyness you'd expect from fried chicken. It left me wishing I had ordered more chicken! The waffle was a waffle. I was kind of sugared out by the homemade syrup, but that's just me. Next time I'll have to try the sugar free syrup. My friend had the Sweet Potato Waffles and Sweet Tea. I had a bite and couldn't tell the difference between my regular waffle and the sweet potato.   Our two dishes together came out to about $28 with tip. All in all it was a good first time experience. I can't wait to try out the other items on their menu: breakfast items, sandwiches and of course more chicken, but I'll wait a few till they get all their issues sorted out.",

The first time I went I got the half chicken meal (which cost between $12 to $13 IIRC) which consisted of two wings and a HUGE BREAST. To be honest both were SUPERB but I liked the chicken more than the waffles...it was crispy, piping hot, and full of flavor. It's ever better if you get it with a side of ranch on the side, according to them it's home made. I wish their waffles were a bit crispier though. I'd rate their chicken a 4.5/5 and waffles a 4/5. The syrup was kinda average.   Definitely liked it more than Little Skillet.",

Gussie's doesn't stray far from authentic homestyle food with it's southern-fare menu. I had the a breast of chicken and two waffles, both of which were pretty damn good. Almost comparable to Roscoe's down in LA. The chicken could have been jucier, but any fried chicken afficionado knows that the breast is usually a tad dry in the middle anyway. It's a big piece of bird.  The waffles were great. They tasted fresh and made just for me, which I loved. I definitely felt some kind of love in them, for sure. The mac &amp; cheese? KILL! It's was so good...and them candied yams warmed my heart, too.  All in all a great experience.",

We arrived just before opening, and was greeted with an ice box for a restaurant, its raining outside and the heater is not on but the doors are all open. We are a party of 6 so we immediately ask for hot chocolate and coffee to get warm. Can you believe the coffee was not hot. The coffee tasted as if they just ran old coffee through again or \u00a0tried to let it get hot on the warmer, the second cup of coffee was hotter than the first; how does that happen?  We came for C&amp;W so we that's what we ordered in addition to a child's plate, grits and an omelet.   First: We appreciate the hot syrup. The waffles were just OK, nothing to write home about. The chicken was off, either the oil was not hot when they dropped them to cook or they were reheated in the oven. Too much GREASE and lacked seasoning  Second: THE GRITS WERE HORRIBLE!!! skip those on the menu, they were cold and not seasoned at all. You MUST salt the water before cooking grits or they taste just like the box they came out of  Third: The wait staff leaves a lot to be desired. Our food came out in phases and they still forgot some items.  Gussies is not good value for the money. Our bill was $2 south of $100 and we left feeling as if we had just gotten taken for a ride. Breakfast is supposed to be the most cheapest meal, but not here.   I can say with a 100% certainty we will NOT be back!",

The place was nice, we got seated almost immediately. Everything was off to a great start. We ordered fried chicken and Mac and cheese, cornbread and French fries. It took almost an hour for our food to get to our table. And when it arrived, all we got was the chicken. We had ordered two pieces of chicken each. I got 2 pieces, and my girlfriend received 3, even though she ordered two. We thought that was a plus, until our bill came and they charged us for the extra piece we didn't want. Then we had to remind our waitress, who I assumed was the owner, that she forgot the rest of our meal. And then, after only bringing us our French fries, had to remind her again that we ordered cornbread. 2 pieces. We were served one. Like c'mon?! I had to remind you three times!  The table next to us sat down after us, ate their food and paid before we got our food.  2 stars because the chicken was good! But how hard is it to mess up fried chicken? An overall subpar, overpriced dining experience. Save your money, go to Popeyes, you'll spend 30 dollars less.",

On my first visit, I got a plate of vegan waffles (good option for those of us who are lactose intolerant), and threw in a side of herb chicken and a bowl of black beans and rice. \u00a0Everything was quite good - the waffles were tasty and moist and the beans and rice were fantastic. \u00a0They had a couple good options for cold beer on tap and a friendly, helpful server to top everything off.

When I asked when was the fish purchased he did not have any idea what I was talking about. 3 minutes later a female cook came out and asked if I had any questions. She then clarified that the fish was indeed fresh. I still laugh when I think about it. The Mac and Cheese was very good....greens just ok....same with the Black eyed peas....corn bread was very good....I prefer mine sweet which is how they serve it. I asked for a coke and the waitress brought me a can of coke, I asked if they had fountain drinks and she could not understand english well enough to understand me. Another wait staff had to come to explain that they only had can coke but it was unlimited. Portions are large and they have a good selection. Overall I rate them a 2.5 would have given them a 3 but the communication of the staff needs great improvement. I much prefer Everet and Jones in Oakland",

    "review_text": "3 stars for the food, which was mostly okay, but zero stars for the service, which was friendly and totally incompetent. \u00a0Bring your most talkative friends, because you're in for a long, long conversation.  I went with a large party during peak hours and we planned to be there for at least an hour or two, but it turned out to more towards two and a half to three hours. Do not come here too hungry or with a schedule of any kind, because you're here for the duration. \u00a0  First, the food story: our party ordered a variety of items, including a vegetarian plate, soup, several plates of regular chicken and waffles as well as some cornbread and sweet potato waffle sides. \u00a0No complaints were heard, except possibly that the chicken was a little dry (mine was on the edge -- it was fine, but if you took too big of a bite, you needed something to wash it down) and the plain waffles were a little too light and bland. \u00a0You really need that ball of butter and brown sugar syrup they serve them with. I would've paid extra for the real maple syrup in retrospect. \u00a0I would've ordered it right then, but I didn't trust Gussies to handle such a last minute thing since they served our sides of honey and cornbread to other tables nearby. The sweet potato waffles were better and I would order just those next time and bring a book, preferably an epic novel.  Now, let me tell you \u00a0the service story, which is very long and maddening. So we're seated with our menus and they take our drink orders. The drinks don't arrive for 30-40 minutes. No, I'm not kidding. \u00a0Mind you, we did not order fancy cocktails, of course. We ordered sodas, water, coffee and tea. Twenty minutes go by after we've ordered our meals and still no drinks. Then after another ten minutes, the guy in charge of bringing the drinks, brings them out one drink at a time with a glass of ice in one hand and a can in the other. I cannot make this stuff up. \u00a0Apparently, this one-drink-at-a-time process was not simple enough to avoid confusion because he still got some of the drinks wrong, forgot to bring the straws, then when he went back to get the straws didn't remember to put them all in once he got to the table, taking one back in his hand, which I'm sure, baffled him once he looked down and saw the straw (why is that there?). \u00a0I think the solution here is get this fellow a notebook, preferably one that you can lift the sheet to erase it so you can just keep making notes, because between the drink counter and our table, he could not focus, even on just one drink or straw at a time. \u00a0He was not alone, though, in this struggle. \u00a0I really started to feel bad for him. On the other hand, why didn't someone give him a tray and help call out all the drinks so he could put down all the drinks at once and hand them out at the table so he wouldn't have to keep traveling back and forth, adding to his confusion? \u00a0Also, why were some of the diet cokes in cans, but others appeared to be from the tap? Very strange.  We waited over an hour for our meals to begin coming out. \u00a0I say, begin, because each person was served at a different time. Out of the 15 people, three people were served first. \u00a0Then ten more minutes for the next two, and so on so that basically by the time I was served (the last one! ha! maybe that's why I'm writing this, natch), it was a good hour and half from when we sat down and the first three people had finished their meals. \u00a0As people were served, many people wanted their drinks refilled as we were sitting there for so long and also requested some extras, which ended up going to different tables each time. I have to interject that after 45 minutes, one of our friends was informed that they ran out of her ordered item. \u00a0Yep, that's how much time had passed -- enough time to run out of certain dishes. Another friend was very late, but she ordered and received her meal in record time --- maybe because the lunch rush was over? It was totally baffling, except that she did not order a waffle (word to the wise!) \u00a0We kept joking about how there's only waffle iron in the kitchen and at one point, our waitress confirmed that there are only three waffle irons!! \u00a0Look, Gussies, buy a couple more -- \u00a0jeez!! You're doing well. Go crazy! Buy another iron!  Then we received our check and when one of our party paid for hers with a credit card, she received another table's check along with her receipt. \u00a0Interesting. \u00a0We told our waitress and she just laughed it off. Ha ha! That happens all the time. Yeah, I see that.  The staff was all smiles the whole time, but it really went from comical to just irritating pretty quickly, especially since the food isn't that great.",

After the first bite i realized that the it was basically a ONE NOTE DISH. Although baked, it didn't have any crispy edges and the cheese wasn't really an extra sharp cheddar. \u00a0Hoping it would get better, I had another bite. \u00a0That didn't happen so I pushed it aside.  On to the biscuit....... \u00a0it certainly didn't look like a true Southern biscuit that was golden and sky high. \u00a0When I bit into it, I was flat out disgusted as there was NO FLAKINESS, NO GOLDEN BUTTERED TOP and zero flavor. IT WAS SORT OF FLAT, LARGE ROUND WITH A DOUGHY TEXTURE. It looked like an industrial biscuit that never had a pair of hands kneading the dough. \u00a0MAN, was I disappointed.  I called the waiter over and told that I wasn't not happy and did not want to eat the rest of it. \u00a0He was very nice and accepting of my reaction. \u00a0On fact, before ordering the biscuit I asked him about it and he said he'd bring one and let me taste it. \u00a0It was my exit interview.  I would not recommend Gussie's and I will not return. \u00a0The waiter was gracious. \u00a0  It was 5 PM so there were only 5 of us in the very bland place. \u00a0There was nothing that said \"Southern\" about the place.  I noticed that some yelpers said the food was \"Cheap\" and you pays for what you git\"......... \u00a0I'd rather have great food, great reviews and  return customers. \u00a0It isn't cheap and the mac 'n cheese is $5.00 for a small bowl.  NEED I SAY MORE....... N O P E",

The fried chicken is juicy and the coating is light and delicious. I had the sweet potato waffles and my only complaint was that the sweet potato flavor was a little muted. It's probably hard to do that because they are so wet, but it could've been a bit more pronounced.  The service is mostly pretty good, but there were small lapses (shouldn't have to ask to have the coke you took to refill back), but they were minor.

The place looked promising given the crowd but the food never made it to my expectations.  Teriyaki chicken wings for appetizer were decent, sort of like the frozen Tyson ones you get at Costco. The chicken and waffles itself was disappointing. The chicken was not crispy and the skin was soggy which is like the ultimate sin to fried chicken. Waffles were like Eggo waffles. Sides were the highlights with the spiced sweet potatoes (and a mediocre mac and cheese). I have to try a place that gets it done right...",

Was hard to grab the attention of servers since 90 percent they were not there.   Payed for the check and left. (After 2 and a half hours.)  Realized the chicken was undercooked and pink since I have not been able to leave the bathroom as I got home.  The owner told me they're moving to Oakland, maybe for the best, but still isn't worth my food poisoning as I'm writing this review.   Overall this place was not the hype I expected from my friends, and as an SF native, WTF?!?!  Sorry Gussie's, I hoped for a better dinner experience.

I have gone to Roscoes several times in LA, so it's probably the closest measuring stick.   The waffle was light and fluffy and the syrup was so good. The fried chicken is similar to Roscoes. I ordered a breast piece, just to see how skilled the chef was in his cooking skills. He failed my test, unfortunately. The outer crust was fantastic. However, when you cut into the center of the chicken, it's dry. I guess I can only have the best prepared fried chicken in the south.   I do want to return to try their side dishes, and I'm looking forward to my next visit.",

I came here again several months later, in January 2011, on a Sunday around 2pm. \u00a0Half the restaurant, if not more, had unoccupied tables which were not reserved but just waiting to be filled. \u00a0And there were about 20 people waiting to be seated. \u00a0Waiting... and waiting... and waiting. \u00a0My party of 2 waited for almost 45 minutes to be seated at a table that was sitting vacant the entire time. \u00a0  Once seated, we got no silverware and no water, only a menu thrown down on the table. \u00a0Only a couple minutes later, another server came by to take our order which we had not had enough time to decide on. \u00a0And still, no silverware or water. \u00a0Aside from being slightly rushed, the only semi-positive thing I can say about the visit was the service we got to place an order. \u00a0  Then the food came...after 30 minutes! \u00a0And our very, very easy order was served to us incomplete. \u00a0Eventually we got water. \u00a0I ended up walking to the kitchen and getting my own silverware. Admittedly, my +1 and I ate the incomplete food (betting on the fact it would take another 30 minutes wait to get the missing waffles), waited for our tab, and left without paying (which, to this day, has probably gone completely unnoticed).   Honestly, I feel that I should have been the one giving Gussie's a tab and being compensated for my time and dissatisfaction. \u00a0The restaurant was not busy in the slightest, and the staff didn't seem to be short either. \u00a0I really have no idea what the issue was - there didn't seem to be any justifiable excuse for how absolutely awful Gussie's operated that day.  When my +1 and I left, there was a young family that had been seated before us and was still waiting to be served their food. \u00a0They must have been waiting for at least an hour after being seated. \u00a0I cannot even fathom having two little children and tolerating that, nor can I imagine being a server and thinking that's acceptable.

I called again today to see if they were open and still the line just rang. If your business is closed due to some sort of remodeling or mishap, good business practice would be to make a recorded message on the phone letting customers know what's going on and when if any date you will re-open. That's just common business practice. Don't leave your customers in the blind. If you value your yelp customers, you should let them know you're closed till further notice!",

Their menu includes fried chicken, roast chicken, salads, sandwiches, veggie burger + other veggie-friendly options, gumbo, breakfast combos, homemade soup, waffles (their specialty is the sweet potato, but they also have original, cornmeal, and buckwheat), and a long list of sides - i.e. mac-n-cheese, fries, sweet potato fries, collard greens, candied yams + desserts.  I enjoyed my Uptown Special (1 fried chicken breast + 1 original waffle with a pat of sweet cream whipped butter) and a side order of waffle-cut sweet potato fries. I should've ordered collard greens with my meal to balance out the sweetness. I also shared the red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting &amp; crushed pecans. Good, but a bit rich for my taste.

With my first look at the menu the endorphins were already pumping through my body and my soul was screaming YES!

Fried grits...divine. Smothered potatoes, black eyed peas, corn bread n biscuits, collard greens (better than my moms!) and of course....the chicken. The breast portion was so huge its enough for 2 people. The wings were huge and juicy...tender and moist but not greasy.

    "review_text": "Once again, YELP nails it: \u00a03.5 stars is just about where this place oughtta be. \u00a0  For those of you who want the short story: yes, Go. \u00a0It's fine. \u00a0Overall, everything here is good. \u00a0Nothing is stellar, mind you, but they've got a nice selection, and most of the issues I have with them are nit-picky things. \u00a0Food is good, service was fine, overall \"restaurant experience\" left a little to be desired, but definitely worth eating at.  Okay, for the REST of you with attention spans longer than a 30-second commercial, here goes: \u00a0I'm very passionate about fried chicken, I should probably say that right off the bat. \u00a0  I liked the crispyness of Gussie's fried chicken. I liked the size of the pieces, I liked the color, the consistency of the skin. \u00a0BUT, I felt that a) it could've used a little more \"herbs and spices\" for lack of a better term, and b) it was definitely DRY. \u00a0I know that somewhere out there, there is someone who has figured out a way to make fried chicken that is CRISPY on the outside, and JUICY on the inside. I'm not saying that I know how to do it, but before I opened a fried chicken restaurant, I'd make damn sure I learned. \u00a0And, while the QUALITY of the chicken was obvious, the overall flavor was just kind of ... OK. \u00a0It needed more ZING. \u00a0I don't know if that means marinating in the buttermilk longer, I don't know if that means more spices in the batter, but it seemed kind of .... middle of the road. \u00a0It needed something to push it over the top. \u00a0  Props go to my waitress, Deanna, who did a really great job. \u00a0She was genuinely friendly and attentive. \u00a0The kitchen made a mistake (gave me brown gravy instead of breakfast / country gravy) and she swapped that out for me, no problem.  As I mentioned in the brief summary, nothing was outstanding. \u00a0Collards were OK. \u00a0Home fries were OK. \u00a0(The country gravy was great, but the biscuits that came with it? \u00a0OK.) \u00a0  I liked their mac'n'cheese. \u00a0They do it, what I would call, \"Southern Style\", which is to say very similar to how I've seen it done at Powell's years ago, when they were on Hayes Street. \u00a0It's not the Velveeta version of Mac'n'Cheese. \u00a0It's drier on the inside, which I like sometimes. \u00a0It's a nice alternative to the more traditional / Stouffers kind of Mac'N'Cheese. \u00a0It's not gooey and soupy, it's more butter-y, with more individual bits of cheesy goodness, as opposed to a smooth blend. \u00a0(Note: your picky kids will probably hate it if all they are used to is Kraft or KFC.)  BUT ... folks, the people who run this place, you really gotta decide what you want to be. \u00a0Do you want to be RESTAURANT restaurant, and charge restaurant prices, or do you want to be a soul food place, maybe have some daily specials written on a piece of paper near a window, and keep it casual? \u00a0Because, as a restaurant, y'all need to step up your game.  The menu that was handed to me was faded, dirty. \u00a0This is one of the first things that people see. \u00a0This piece of paper IS your presentation to your customer. \u00a0For cryin' out loud, when they get old, faded, and dirty TOSS THEM OUT. \u00a0Bad first impression. \u00a0So easily fixed, it makes me wonder why no one in charge is paying attention. \u00a0  At the start of my meal, I used the Men's room, washed up, no paper towels. \u00a0Okay, that happens, I know. \u00a0I tell the first waitress I see, \"You need paper towels in the Men's Room.\" \u00a0She acknowledges me. \u00a0At the END of my meal, a good 15-20 minutes later, I go back to the Men's Room. \u00a0Do ya think they put paper towels in there? \u00a0Would I be WRITING this if they put paper towels in there? \u00a0Of course not. \u00a0'Cause y'all are CASUAL. \u00a0As in, \"Hey, we'll get around to the paper towels EVENTUALLY, right now we're busy with customers.\" \u00a0But guess what, taking care of the bathrooms IS part of running a restaurant. \u00a0  Also, cans of Shasta on the table, that's your idea of soda? \u00a0See, that's something that I expect from a place where you walk up to a window, look at a hand-written menu that's on a black board or written on butcher paper or something, and place your order with the lady behind the window and then pay her. \u00a0(Anyone remember Gravy's? \u00a0*sigh* That place was the best.) \u00a0But when you do the whole have someone GREET you when you walk in the to place - \"Welcome to Gussie's\" - when you do the whole SIT DOWN, let me take your order, and when you EXPECT to get a 15 - 20% tip at the end of the meal, then WE, your customers, expect better than a frickin' can of Shasta sitting on the table. \u00a0(I don't know, maybe the is a black folks / white folks thing.)  So, that's all I'm saying: if you're gonna be a sit down, quasi-respectable restaurant, then get a Manager on Duty who doesn't let the little things slip through the cracks. If you're gonna be a casual soul food joint, then lose all the pretense of being a quasi-respectable restaurant and just keep it focused on the food. \u00a0  I'd go back, there's more on the menu I'd like to explore, but I wouldn't RUN back, you know what I'm sayin'?",

First of all, every other C&amp;W joint I've been to in the city was GRIMEY (aka dirty) and the food did not impress me. (Well, Criola Kitchen was OK). But Gussies is actually a very nice looking restaurant with great decor. I love that they play radio hits instead of cheesy restaurant music. And the staff was SO FRIENDLY!   The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is- all sides need to be ordered separately, theres no sides included with the meals so there isn't much variation (see Home of Chicken and Waffles in Oakland- their menu has like 20 different plates). Also, they are pricey: $15-$20 bucks for a plate depending on how many pieces you want. Also, the waffle can be more crunchy.   Other than that I would totally recommend this place over the sketchy 3rd st C&amp;W places. However if you're looking to have your mind blown try the place in Oakland.",

While I was anxious for this place to be equal or better than Roscoe's in LA, it fell short big time.   First off, the place is virtually empty and it didn't help that practically every light in the place was shut off or not working. Even the main entry had no lights. Service was also sparse and I was certain our server was also the one cooking in the back. I tried the 2-piece chicken and sweet potato waffle combo. Portions were a good size and really, the food was pretty decent.  Overall, I was generally confused by the whole experience and began to realize that maybe this place was more take-out quality given there was a stream of people coming in and out only.

It was the most bitter tasting greens I've ever eaten before. \u00a0Also, the waffle batter didn't taste like anything special. \u00a0Not like the waffles that Roscoe's makes. \u00a0  The chicken was lightly breaded with a delicious rub, and pair excellently with the candy yams. \u00a0Can I just say, the yams was \u00a0sensational, because it wasn't overly sweet or mushy. \u00a0The baked mac &amp; cheese, was fantastic because it was dripping with american cheese. \u00a0The chicken was a bit on the small side, but if you get the taste of the south plate, you will have plenty of food. \u00a0FYI, the they don't carry sweet &amp; low for the ice tea, which really needs it...   Oh, the red velvet cake was extremely dry, but not sweet at all...",

One good thing is that they offer sweet potato fries, which is awesome, but there's nothing else i'd recommend here. Maybe I'm not a southern food type of person, maybe i've been spoiled by Roscoe's, but their chicken pieces is a little small and I didn't see anything special. Sue me.",

So they get a thumbs up in my book.   The food was GOOD, not the best I've ever had, but the portions generous, and the price is right! The fried catfish stole the show, and its hard to go wrong with mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. My only complaints are that the chicken was a little on the dry side and everything was a tad salty for my taste. But we all cleaned our plates....so how bad could it be?  The service was super friendly, but kinda slow. Our food came out unevenly, leaving 3 of my friends awkwardly waiting for quite a long time while the rest of had our plates. I also could have done without the overly loud live smooth jazz. But the place has character and I would definitely try it again.",

    "review_text": "Chicken and waffles have always been a fascinating idea to me... just as I find the fact that Mexicans eat beans for breakfast fascinating too, but that is another review!   So my friend was telling me about this new place that served chicken and waffles which she was dying to try. We had just been to 1300 on Fillmore a week before when she noticed it. I figured.... sure, why not. We don't have anything else like that in the area unless we trek out to Oakland. So, I decided to go check it out today and I was surprised by how nice the staff was, how fast the food came, how tasty it was. The portions were just right for me (I couldn't finish it). We both ordered the 1/4 chicken (white meat) with 2 waffles. I also added a side of mac-n-cheese.   I looked over to other peoples tables (it's such bad taste, but hey... I had to see what they were eating to make sure I made the right decision. I looked over and saw these gigantic dishes with rice and beans... man, it looked oh so good, but I went to try out the chicken and waffles (another trip is in store!).   Food:  Anyhoo.... back to my chicken, it could use more flavor, but the chicken breast I got was good, not the best, but adequate. The waffles, I can see where people feel it to be a little chewy, mine was too. It was not bad, but it needs fine tuning. The syrup was really good and nice and warm. I ordered a \"sunrise\" for my drink (aka-arnold palmer = half lemonade, half tea) and it was absolutely the best mix I had in a long time. I received refills, not sure if that was an error or not, but I would have never ordered a refill on it, not because it was not good, but because at $2.50 a pop, it adds up quickly. There was also gravy w/onions (I am allergic to raw or slightly cooked onions). The server was nice enough to bring me a bit to try out to see if it had been cooked enough to not bother me, but it did. Oh so sad :( My friend liked it, so I will trust her judgement on it. The Mac and Cheese was delish! Which for almost 5 bucks was really overpriced, but I loved how it tasted. Not greasy, not over or under cooked... just yummy. But I think the price is a bit high for the portion.   Service:  We were seated right away (they were busy, but had a table for two avail.) Our server David was really sweet. We took our sweet time figuring out what to order because they menu is quite large. But I have nothing but good things to say about him.   Ambiance:  This place is somewhat casual, although you will see people come in wearing their Sunday best too. It is nice and clean, spacious, looks like they have a private room too and a bar (I believe they have a late happy hour 10-11pm). Lots of light from the large windows. The silverware really should be upgraded to sturdier ones because my friend's fork was bent and I managed to bend mine cutting the waffles since hey were on a chewy side.   Overall:  It is a new restaurant and like everything new, you need to give it some time to settle in. I did not find anything horribly wrong with it. I will definitely go check it out again. I just hope that management is taking note of the comments made and make things even better than they already are. I look forward to making this place one of my regular stops and wish it much success.   PS - \u00a0If you miss Roscoe's that much, \u00a0just go back to LA and get your \u00a0Roscoe's waffles. You can't expect everything to be the same as Roscoe's and on top of it, we don't have one anywhere close, so what is the point? Yeah... I am ranting now... oh well! We are all entitled ;0)",

Chicken was perfectly cooked, moist on the inside, flavorful crunchy crust (even when smothered!) and the fixins were top notch and generous portions! Still had a full to go box at the end!   My BF had the uptown special- a breast and a waffle and was super pleased. I am not even a waffle person and LOVED their thin waffle and divine homemade syrup-- not your average waffle syrup, folks. We asked what was in the syrup..cinnamon? Cloves? The sweet waitress claimed nothing special, but I don't buy it. That's a valuable tight lipped employee you got there, Gussie's!  Our waitress brought us a little sampler of sides since our food took so long to come out (about 1 hr), but the chicken wings looked like they were rejects that didn't turn out right. Regardless, we were starving and it was a nice gesture.  Being from NC though, I think the sweet tea could use some work , as could the funny-tasting cornbread.

The 1st time we ever came here, they had a DJ. We recently went on a Friday around 9pm and there wasn't a DJ, so I'm not sure how often they do that.  Anyway, we both ordered what we had the previous time we had been here. The bf had the \"Taste of the South,\" which is a quarter of chicken (he got a breast and thigh), collard greens, candied yams, mac 'n' cheese, and cornbread. I got the \"Fillmore Classic,\" which comes with 3 wings, eggs (I got mine scrambled), and the option of 2 waffles, but I only wanted 1. Then we had the southern corn and red beans and rice for sides.  We didn't wait tremendously long for our food. I actually felt like it came out fast. Our waiter was on top of it and would periodically check up on us. He really seemed genuine about providing good customer service.   The bf had no complaints about his food. I tried his collard greens and candied yams and they were sweet, but not overly sweet. I actually want to get them next time. The cornbread was nice and fluffy. My wings were perfect. The chicken was juicy and the skin was crispy, but not overly fried. The eggs were standard. Loved the waffle! The southern corn was nicely seasoned. The red beans and rice were alright.   Overall, we enjoyed the food. We spent about $50 with tip and that included 2 beers as well. It's a place you have to at least try once. As far as service goes, my only gripe was that the hostess failed to seat us right away when she saw us walk in and didn't even acknowledge us. But, other than that, it's a good place to go for your chicken and waffles fix.",

    "review_text": "UPDATE: Just found my old receipt, the server's name was Deanna. She served us on March 25, 2012. She had a terrible attitude towards my boyfriend, who is handicapped and needs extra room for his seating. She was acting skeptical that my BF NEEDED extra room to sit since he wasn't sitting in a wheelchair or holding onto crutches. Just because you're handicap does NOT mean you must have either of those things. Also she indirectly accused us of lying about the amount of OJ's we ordered. Rudest service we've ever received in a restaurant.  Previous review below:  Great neighborhood, lots of hype, totally overrated.  Ordered the fried chicken and waffles (the sweet potato one), loved the sweet potato kick but the sweet potato waffle was not crispy one bit. Soggy! The fried chicken was okay, outside was crispy but the meat was dry. Sadly I enjoyed Popeyes and KFC more.  Service: TERRIBLE. Waitress was SO RUDE! \u00a0I ordered a glass of orange juice from her, then later I requested an empty cup with ice from a waiter so I could share the juice with my boyfriend because I couldn't finish it.  The restaurant was also crowded at the time, so the waitress barely had room to get past my boyfriend's chair. Because he has had knee surgery, he has to sit with extra room. The waitress was demanding he move his chair, and evan after he told her he can't because of his injury, she looked at him like he was bulls#itting since his jeans covered his knee.   The bill comes and we noticed that the bill had 2 OJs instead of One, so we told the waitress. She points at the extra cup with ice in it and says, \"Then what's THAT?\" I mean, seriously? My boyfriend and I are not liars....we certainly did not appreciate her attitude to treat us like we would make up such a petty lie.  Will not be coming back, did not feel valued as a customer and was certainly not *wowed* at all. Much better fried chicken at Foreign Cinema/KFC/Popeyes.  Or just fry the chicken yourself at home and make some eggo waffles yourself...will taste much better.",

I went here recently with my two roommates expecting something \u00a0a lot more than what we got. First of all I love the fact that its owned through family but I think thats its down fall too. I liked that it was packed or it seemd to be busy, but I am not sure if it was because of the live band that was trying to set up, but the serving staff was not the best. We were greated by the chef/owner with a baby in her arms.  Our hostess seem to be flustered and came off rude. We were waited on by at least 4 different servers. The menu is extensive and seems very appealing but everything on there was average tasting.  Ofcourse we ordered Chicken and Waffles because well it was something we thought we should do, sadly the other menu items seemed to be more appetizing then the Chicken and Waffles themselves.  We orderd the Grit Cakes which to me we bland and they looked if it was defrosted food.  The Waffles tasted great, the chicken alone was ok, and the server came 20min after we ordered to let us knowthey ran out of Chicken breast and they were going to subsitute for Boneless Skinless Chicken. I give this place 2 stars only because of the service. I don't mind the fact its like a \"Denny's\" for soul food but they need to get there act straight in the \"front of the house\" If it was that frantic I can only imagine the kitchen.",

And it's healthful.   We also shared the sample platter which you can choose your own sides. SAY HELLO TO YAMS! This delicious goodness was so great that I spread some on my waffles. I almost licked the bowl... We also tried the greens (made vegetarian if you ask) and the corn. Both were good, but I would probably order 3 orders of yams before anything else.   Did I mention how good these yams were? Haha.   Please note: This is slow cooked food, so it will take quite some time for your food to arrive. It's so worth it though.",

The young gentleman (he worked the cash register/bar) and was also my server for the 2 of us for lunch was extremely gregarious and pleasant and we expressed that we wanted to \"customize\" our meal, which he graciously said \"he'd work around that\". We ordered the fried Okra as an appetizer with the spicy remoulade sauce (Killer) and within 5 minutes our \"customized\" Fried chicken meals came with the sides we requested. The chicken was delicious and wasn't greasy, which is most important. We both had the red beans and rice, and that also didn't disappoint us either (Yummy!) I elected for black-eyed peas (also good) while my buddy wanted the potato salad. All of these were delicious and made our hankering for good ol' comfort/soul food quenched. All in all, it was a most pleasant experience, with great food and great service! Thanks Gussies! We'll be back!",

Friday night, the bf &amp; I stopped in to finally check out the chicken &amp; waffles place that joined the famous &amp; infamous Fillmore area of SF. It was an uncomfortable, unbearable Indian summer evening but Gussies had several fans &amp; air conditioning to cool us down a bit.   Service was fantastic all night: the host greeted us warmly &amp; sat us right away, our waitress was lovely &amp; made recommendations &amp; we never had to ask to have out water glasses filled.  The nitty-gritty: I had the Uptown Special- one waffle &amp; one chicken breast. Plus I added a side of grits. The waffle was not soft, it had almost a tough, rubbery consistency &amp; the syrup had a honey/candy taste, which makes me think I should have spent the extra $1 for pure maple syrup. The chicken was fried perfectly &amp; was tender on the inside &amp; was a decent sized portion. Skip the grits, as they are about as special as Cream of Wheat.  The bf had Down Home Fixin's which was red beans &amp; rice, corn bread, a chicken breast &amp; collard greens (it was supposed to come with corn, but it appears they may have been out because everyone got collard greens instead of corn.) Everything on his plate was flavorful &amp; impressed us both. The collard greens had a good flavor &amp; was not as tart as other collard greens I've tried.   We were too full to have dessert there but I *had* to take a slice of red velvet cake to go. It was dense &amp; had cream cheese icing/filling (which I prefer over buttercream on red velvet) &amp; had loads of pecans. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough cream cheese icing/filling. Throw it on there, Gussie!  We made the observation that everyone dining at Gussie's was probably not going to be a \"regular;\" they were trying it out for the novelty factor but may not make a second visit. I really hope this place has longevity in it's future &amp; finds lots of \"regulars\" because it has so many good things going on: the service is great, convenient location, &amp; I drool just reading their menu.  We will definitely be coming back (major plus: Gussie's is open late night on the weekends) because I'd like to try their peach cobbler, sweet potato waffles &amp; fried okra.  Total without tip: $31 (not too shabby!)",

Maybe the sweet potatoes made for better crisping in the waffle maker, or maybe that batch just got some extra time, but they were better all around. \u00a0  The grits were...grits.  I'd go back on a weekday to use my ScoutMob deal on sweet potato waffles while jamming to Keith Sweat and Blackstreet, but I'm not sure I'll venture to try much else.",

It took 30 minutes just to get our water (asked for it several times) and another hour to get our food. One of my friends ordered a chocolate milk and on the menu it states free refills but the bus boy didn't even know that as he told us the chocolate milk does not come with free refills. People sat at a table next to us and got their food before us. I didn't even leave a tip because the service was so bad. The manager of this restaurant does not know how to run a restaurant as there was only two waitresses for the entire restaurant which is fairly big given this is SF.   However, the food makes up for the service. Red velvet and sweet potato waffles are amazing! The music they play is also very cool and took me back to 90s R&amp;B.",

That's the real southern chicken!  Jumbalaya w/ Rice Dish: (With precaution) In the words of my friend Christine, \"how are you going to serve an Asian person f*cked up rice.\" We sent it back the first time with the rice undercooked, hard and the jumalaya was cold. Then we got it back the second time and the rice was overcooked and super soggy and disgusting with the result of the jumabalaya ok. \u00a0 Seriously?!!!  AVOID THE SKINNNY STRING LOOKING CHICKEN STRIPS. (THEIR VERSION OF ACTUAL CHICKEN STRIPS.)  Not only was it over cooked, it was drenched in salt. Sooo salty that it knocked out the rest of your taste buds and killed our appetite. The chicken barely had any good crunch to it either. What kind of shiz is that?  Mac &amp; Cheese was burnt, crusty and hard with barely any cheese besides the burnt crusty part.  Waffles were soggy and we didn't even put the syrup on it yet. Another \"really?!\" moment!  Overpriced and overrated. The only thing that I came out of that place was the mashed potatoes.   The end result, stick with the appetizers with one item, the Grits &amp; Cheese and Mashed Potatoes. Anything else so not good.  I feel like this restaurant wanted to open up just cause someone thought they can cook. Ooo they were so wrong. This is not soul food, this is not comfort food. This would be a great place if you were majorly drunk and had nothing else to eat late at night. Then again this would be the last resort on those drunken with a hangover-happening-at-the-same-time-that-you-need-\u00adto-eat-sort-of-moment. Though it would attract the wrong crowd. Then again, it already does.  AVOID gussies and kick it on over to KFC or Popeyes. That's the real deal.   Better yet just go to Brunos!   I gave it one star for the decor. Otherwise everything else is not so good. Menu is awful looking. Staff is blah! Please atleast act like you care about your job. You're a chicken &amp; waffles \"diner.\" Don't act like you're doing us a favor.   I live right across the street from gussies. So from what I hear they close down a restaurant every other year.

    "review_text": "So I went to Gussies with a fairly large group (we had 12 people), so my experience may differ from yours.  SERVICE ------------- They tried their best, which is to say it was not terrible, and it was not good. I know it can be hard to give great service to groups, but the restaurant was fairly empty when we went so there the fact it took forever to get a refill on water was disappointing. Our waiter seemed a bit overwhelmed, and messed up a couple orders, but by the time the food came out we were just ready to eat so we let it slide.  And now on to the important stuff.  FOOD --------- I had the Uptown special w/ two eggs sunny side up. The Uptown Included one fried chicken breast and 1 waffle, and the eggs were a la carte. I DO NOT RECOMMEND getting the Uptown. Get the Downtown instead. The chicken breast is simply too much chicken for the batter. I felt it was fairly bland and tasteless. The waffle was quite tasty, and went well with the eggs.   I was told to order a chicken drumstick to make up for the breast, so I did that and it was MUCH better. The seasonings in the batter came through and I was disappointed I did the breast over the leg. My total came to about $15 including tax &amp; tip.  SETTING ------------- Very blah. It's a fairly large space, and I know it's pretty new, but do SOMETHING with it.   If you're a fan of Farmer Brown or Little Skillet, try this and see what you think. I like both of them, and given they are much closer to me, I doubt I would ever make the trip specifically to come here again.",

Our server was totally attentive and we ordered drinks on our own. Our other friend who had a party there and she didn't order the same food and we were charged less but we didn't enjoy it as much so we ordered additional stuff on our own.

After setting aside our menus, my friend ordered the chicken and waffles and so did I. I got the southern plate. The waffles had a good brown color and tasted really good. The chicken was well seasoned and very crunchy. The scrambled cheese eggs that came with the meal, was a bit runny for my taste. If fully cooked, they would have been BOMB!   For dessert, we got the red velvet cake. I've never had red velvet cake with pecans in the icing. I liked it. The icing on the cake was a bit odd. It was lighter than cream cheese icing and had a whip cream consistency. The cake itself was stiff and dry. My friend said that parts of the cake was under cooked.

Check with the back. 4) When one asks for water, be aware of the restaurant standards. \u00a0After asking for two waters, you returned with one room temperature glass of water in this sorry looking cocktail glass with no ice and no lemon. \u00a0And then we gaze the restaurant and EVERY table has a refreshing, tall glass of iced water with lemon...C'mon dude.

Now on to the food. \u00a0The chicken was rather tasty...good crunch...piping hot...the highlight of the lunch. \u00a0The waffles on the other hand were pathetic. \u00a0I mean, I don't know if there exists a particular style of waffle that is soggy &amp; flimsy (so much so that I struggled to cut with just a fork...actually NEEDED to use a knife). \u00a0There might be... I'm just saying, these were WAY soggy. Or maybe I'm eating my chicken n waffles wrong? If so, somebody please enlighten me.  Not what I was hoping for here.

The service sucked. I understand being busy and trying to work through a rush with a limited staff (I work in a restaurant myself), but don't complain to your customers about it. Instead of getting her hustle on and putting a little speed in her step, our server chose to complain to us about how busy it was and told us she would get to us when she could.   I felt sorry for the table next to us. When it came time for their check to arrive, they got one for $90 (obviously not their check). While we waited to finish paying our bill, the couple next to us told us that they had a similar experience to ours (lukewarm food and crappy service).

The main event. LET'S DO THIS.   I was really disappointed. The chicken was extremely dry and the flavor was so boring that I already forgot about it. I just finished about 30 minutes ago.

Fried chicken is a necessity for me every week. Usually I leave satisfied with the food, but yesterday was more of a fail.   About 5 minutes after being seated, we ordered two beers. They came about 10 minutes later and we assumed that's when our waiter would take our order. But no. I think there were only two servers and it was pretty full, but it took forever for our waited to come back. We kept making eye contact and noticing him looking our direction, but didn't approach us. Menus closed, looking impatient, trying to get his attention, 75% done with our glasses of beers.. He finally took our order literally 18 minutes later (only know cause of the time stamp on my beer pic). Appetizer came about 15 min later and entrees about 15 minutes after that.  What we ordered:   Louisiana shrimp chowder - came room temperature, not hot as I expected a soup would come. At this point, we thought that it would take forever to get a new one so just ate it. Nothing too special. Pieces of shrimp over cooked. Couldn't tell the difference between textures of shrimp and sausage. Color was the only thing that set them apart.   Fillmore Classic - chicken and waffle combo still on point. Great seasoning and crisp on chicken. Waffle sweet without much syrup.   Sundays best - chicken still seasoned good and crispy. Breast a little over cooked. One section was hard to chew because it was hard and dry. But still satisfied my craving for fried chicken. Mac and cheese a little dry. I think I got the corner because a bit of it had extra hard cheese on it. Greens cooked perfectly.   Overall, gussies food isn't too bad. Hits the spot usually. I just noticed that their service is allllllways slow.",

So I decided to give it another try two weeks ago on a Friday afternoon around 1pm for my birthday because Scoutmob had a 50% off popup deal. At the recommendation of my uncle, my friend and I both had the lunch buffet. The buffet had fried chicken, grilled chicken, mac/cheese, gumbo, fried catfish, rice and beans, and a few other items. We must have gotten there towards the end of the lunch rush because there wasn't much food left. Everything seemed really salty. The only thing I enjoyed was the mac and cheese.   I went again the Thursday after because my uncle gave me a $20 voucher that was about to expire. Went with my mom and I had the Fillmore special--3 wings, subbed for a red velvet waffle, and 2 over easy eggs. She had the Downtown Special--1 thigh and a waffle. The chicken wasn't the disappointing part this time...it was the waffle that was a major letdown. Red velvet is supposed to be fluffy; my red velvet waffle seemed like it was food colored and had a really in-your-face sweetness to it that made my teeth tingle.   Service: I don't understand how a restaurant such as Gussies can get away with having only one server and one bus person during lunch hour. It makes service really slow and inefficient and takes forever to get the check or refills on drinks.  Needless to say, the next time I'm in the mood for fried chicken, I'll be taking my business to Hard Knox. I highly doubt I'd recommend Gussies to friends and family.",

But because I'm such a fan of chicken &amp; waffles, I totally ignored the reviews and for that Yelp, I'm sorry, I will never doubt you again UNLESS ...we'll deal with that later.   We came here with a Groupon for breakfast. The decor is ok and they have a lot of \u00a0space. The hostess and servers were great during the whole experience. This place in my mind has the potential to be so much greater than it is currently. I wanted to like this place so much but here is my 2 Yelp cents.   We ordered the catfish sliders and 3 wings with a waffle/mac n cheese. First it surprised me that with those 2 plates plus an apple juice, came to nearly 30 bucks?! That's crazy because you would think for 30 bucks in a chicken &amp; waffle joint you could get so much more.   Now the food. My waffle was horrible and I mean I don't think it was cooked all the way. Too soft and still tasted like batter. Chicken wings and mac had flavor but it didn't taste fresh-- it was like it had been sitting around for a while. This is coming from a fried chicken lover &amp; it takes a lot for me to bad mouth some fried chicken. We've had fried chicken recently where you could taste the flavor and the freshness of the chicken and it just didn't happen here.   My gf got the catfish sliders, it was only 3. After the first one she was like yummm but when she got to the 2nd starting not feeling so hot. \u00a0Barely made it through the 3rd and after eating here, neither of us felt so hot for a while &amp; we both had the worse case of NASTY burps for a few hours after words. That has never happened to us. I know TMI but it's the truth. We drank tea and lots of water for mostly the rest of the day.  I can get the frustration of small business owners with Yelp, especially restaurant owners because a bunch of bad reviews could be bad for business. At the same time Yelp is a great barometer for what you're doing right/wrong.   Like I said \u00a0before I really wanted to like this place. Again, \u00a0the server and hostess were very friendly and the service was great. The problem is the food was bad, almost really bad.   Unless I hear of some turn around I probably won't visit this place again :(",

Thanks to Yelp's trusty Android app, I was able to narrow down my pre-Outside Lands food fiesta to Gussie's, which was just a short drive from our hotel. \u00a0After scoping some of the reviews, I'm super glad my brother and I weren't scared off -- because we had an amazing experience!  The service was stellar and incredibly friendly. \u00a0Our server's smile just melted my heart -- and trust me, that is no easy feat. \u00a0She was so patient and helpful (along with all the other staff around) and this was just at the beginning of a weekend lunch rush.  Bro and I decided to split: \u00a0a 1/2 fried chicken with 2 waffles (one regular for him, one sweet potato for me -- gotta do it!) and their fried pork chop special with 2 sides (mac and cheese, and collard greens). \u00a0Add to that a biscuit with gravy and some cornbread, and we were all set. \u00a0(It was a coffee kinda morning for me; bro opted for sweet tea. \u00a0Yay!)  The meats: Although the chicken was a *tad* dry in the middle of the breast, EVERYTHING ELSE was just spectacular. \u00a0You could tell that this was the real deal: soaked with special blends, pan or oven fried to perfection, and seasoned and served with love. \u00a0I didn't feel guilty at all digging into this. \u00a0The fried pork chop, after you made it past the delicate yet solid fried outer coating, just melted in your mouth. \u00a0How is this so good??? \u00a0When I grow up I want to fry chicken and pork chops like Gussie does.  The sides: Mac and cheese was standard, but what set it apart was the serious hint of sharp cheese you could taste in each bite. \u00a0It is quite ballsy to do this btw. \u00a0The collard greens were so perfect, just like I remember from my black mama's cooking over in Richmond CA. \u00a0No funky aftertaste, and you could still taste the 'green' part of the side dish.  The carbs: Waffles were so-so; flavors were all there, but I was more impressed with the regular maple syrup than the cinnamon-ish one provided with the sweet potato. \u00a0Cornbread was delicious per the usual, and the biscuit was nice and fluffy -- but the true star of the show was the gravy! \u00a0I poured that stuff on my chicken and waffles like a Turkish bath.  The food and the service were both top notch. \u00a0I hope Gussie's makes it out here on Eddy -- I shall return for Funky Fridays and all you can eat southern goodies! \u00a0Thanks for a great lunch.",

Unfortunately, the only good thing I was able to draw from the experience was that the staff is really nice.   We went around 9:30 on a week day and the place was empty (bad sign?) Regardless, we sat down, I ordered coffee and we both ordered the standard chicken and waffle b-fast. I didn't get my coffee until I reminded the waitress about it when our breakfast arrived and, I repeat, we were the only people in the place. Okay, whatever I thought. She spaced and the food will make up for it. Ugh, not even close. The chicken was dry and flavorless. Like, KFC would be considered 5-star cuisine compared to this stuff. The waffle was soggy and cold and don't even get me started on the syrup. It was so runny and flavorless that I used half the container and not only did it fail to add any flavor to the waffle, it also made my plate look like I'd spilled water on it. Needless to say, I was completely disappointed.   On our way out, the staff encouraged us at least twice to come back one night for dessert, so maybe that's what they hang their hat on. I sure hope so, because the two items in this place's name are the two items you should definitely avoid.",

My baby was up from his nap so it was lunch time for him and anyone with kids knows that after that nap you have 1 hr to feed the hungry child.   WELL..... Lets say that the moment we walked in we weren't greeted one of the waitress was in the bar area doing something on the register and didn't say give me a moment I will be right with you nothing. After she walked out the Manager (I assume because every time we come shes in street clothes and not a uniform) says that someone will be with us.   Now we are seated after a short wait. The busser got us some waters as soon as we sat down and I asked him for lemon.....wait 5 minutes now lemon.......I let it go. We looked through the menus and after 10 minutes we were ready to order. We gave out waitress about 20 minutes and then I asked for a waitress because we were all ready sitting down for almost 35 minutes. Why should I have to ask for a waitress? anyways I didn't mind I just wanted to order because my son (2 years old) was becoming restless and hungry. We order mind you I also asked the waiter for lemon as well..... we wait.....and we wait.....another 20 minutes pass and we hear the manager cussing out the cooks because they were messing up orders let me say that they need a door that enters that kitchen because we heard everything! O yea and we are still waiting.......The manager passes and I ask her for lemon and we are still waiting.....well about 45 minutes pass by and we are still waiting! Did I mention that out waitress didn't bother to come and check on us NOT 1 time, to apologize for the wait, ask us if we needed anything, to just have that customer service attitude....NOTHING!!!! The 2 waitresses and the Manager has an attitude because the cooks were messing up.   O and we are still waiting! I have the busser get the waitress and I ask her how much longer....Well she tells me she has 5 tables ahead of us O I WAS PISSED!!!! You couldn't tell us that when you realized how long it was going to be? \u00a0O that's right you didn't come and check on us not 1 time! The customer service here isn't the best we had a good experience the 1st time, and ok the 2nd, but this last time mad me mad as hell because everyone had an attitude, NO ONE didn't bother to check on us, and when she told us about the 5 tables before we could make a decision she was the 1st to say and I quote \"Well I can just cancel your order\" with an attitude. We got up and we left. As we were leaving I heard the manager say why does a table have to wait 45 minutes for food. I was over it, we crossed the bridge to be fed some good food not attitudes and horrible service.   Now will I be back? I don't know, like I said the food is good but the service has to get better a waitress with an attitude is just like getting a plate of nasty food. It ruins your whole experience.   We went over to Soul Groove on Larkin and Golden Gate....Lets just say the service was way better, a happy environment, and we sat down and had our food fast. The owner was GREAT and has a GREAT ATTITUDE!",

The food was excellent, but let me break in down about something I usually don't rave about: THE SERVICE.  We had ordered okra to start and it was taking awhile. \u00a0A fellow named Joseph (not our server) had come over to say he noticed that we had been sitting there awhile with nothing on our table. \u00a0He apologized profusely and went to check on the issue. \u00a0He came back with a cup of their Gumbo for us to try and explained the issue.  The gumbo was TO DIE FOR.  In just a few seconds our okra appeared. \u00a0It was pretty good, but nobody can really beat my great Aunt Faye's okra, ya know? \u00a0The refills on our sweet tea came swiftly and our \"Uptown Special\"s came with perfect timing after that. \u00a0  I'm not a huge fan of \"regular\" syrup, but Gussies has syrup made from brown sugar instead of maple and it was DIVINE! \u00a0The chicken was perfect and really quite tasty.  We also had a biscuit and cornbread just to try it. \u00a0The cornbread was a tiny bit overdone and the biscuit lacked something. \u00a0But Josh and I are pretty picky when it comes to home-cookin' and nobody really beats my mom's cornbread.  Overall, the place looks great, the food was great and the service was impeccable. \u00a0We will be back very soon to try everything else on the menu.  BONUS: They're open LATE. \u00a0Until 2am on the weekends and 11pm on weeknights. \u00a0  They also have red velvet cake, but they were already out. \u00a0That must mean it's completely ridiculous. \u00a0Can't wait to go back to try it!",

    "review_text": "I went for a friend's birthday, so I read the reviews before going here with low expectations to start.   As I entered I was surprised by how the place looked. Great ambiance, warm feeling. I would not expect this place to serve chicken and waffles. With that thought in mine I thought, maybe all the bad reviews were wrong...hm.  We were seated in the back (9 people). Looking at the menu I was shocked to see the prices, a bit expensive for one chicken and one waffle ($7.50). So I thought maybe i'll just order a side dish since I'm not that hungry. NO WAY! One side was $4.50, so I decided to just get a meal since it would only be $3 more.   I was the last to order and I noticed that he didn't write it down. I turned to my friend and said, \"I bet that I'm not going to get my food, he's going to forget.\" Food came and I was right, one missing.   The order came. SMALLEST PIECE OF CHICKEN I'd ever seen. The taste of it was alright, nothing spectacular about it. The waffle was good, really sweet, friend said it smelled like a gingerbread cookie. Tried the eggs. I could make it at home, just add cheese and green onions. No special surprise on the palate.  I looked over and saw that my friend didn't finish her biscuit. I tried it, OMG, HORRIBLE! NEVER order the BISCUITS. \u00a0It tasted like uncooked dough. If you want a good biscuit go to Popeyes a block away or to Brenda's French Soul Food.  I won't be back. At least the birthday girl enjoyed herself, that's all that matters, right?",

With that said, I firmly believe that chicken and waffles is one of the greatest food combinations known to man.  The first, and arguably most important, thing to say about Gussies is that they have $2 Tuesdays! Not only can you get a pint for $2 (and a decent one, there's no fine print about being restricted to Budweiser or other unimpressive drafts) but chicken wings are $2 too.  In general, I'd describe Gussie's as lowkey. Don't come looking for white tablecloths and super attentive servers bringing out immaculately prepared meals. The chicken is slightly dry but all the food is homey - like when your Mom cooks you something that's slightly lacking in flavor but you love it anyway. The red velvet waffles are delicious and definitely give the sweet potato waffles a try, ordering the original waffles goes without saying.   Sometimes you've got to feed your soul too, and Gussies gets the job done.",

The situation could have been handled much differently. \u00a0There were two tables of people on either side of out 2-seat table. \u00a0I was embarrassed by our server's reaction.

It's actually what I would have preferred. I loved the waffles, they were soo yummmz. When I took the first bite, it was SO good. But it really could have been because I was so hungry.

The grits were amazing - creamy and delicious. It was the first time I really understood why people go crazy for grits.  2. My husband got the home fries, and they were more like mashed potatoes - in the very best way possible.  3. Fried chicken was very moist. Must have been an \"on\" day - many other reviews mention dry chicken.   4. The biscuit was buttery and delicious.  5. Portion sizes were giant. I was full for about 8 hours after finishing my plate (in retrospect, I should have left the eggs).  The service was a bit patchy. At one point, we didn't see our waitress for what felt like 20 minutes. But I think she was covering the whole restaurant, so maybe they were understaffed.

I will keep this brief, but as I was writing this I noticed other patrons of the same day also commented about the BELOW POOR SERVICE that day. It was 1-1-11 and early afternoon when we (party of 3) showed up to Gussies. It was full of people and we waited 20min just to be asked if we were here to eat. After 30 plus min we were seated. The table was not prepared and we had to ask for silverware twice. After we ordered we had to feed the meter twice, and it ended up taking over TWO HOURS to receive cold food that was half correct. We watched two tables that were seated before us eat and leave before we had received our food. The table to our right was waiting for half as long ended up leaving. The table of two behind me had to ask the waitress where there food was, and to their surprise she didn't remember what they ordered. \u00a0Once they got there food, the lady called the waitress over and told her it was cold. The waitress said they were understaffed and apologized. They left Gussies UPSET. We voiced our concern to the waitress about our food and waiting time and she said we would be comped for the delays and the COLD FOOD. When we went to pay the lovely so-called acting manager gave us a gracious 20% off our food. When I went to pay with $20's the so-called manager reached into the waitresses apron and made change because evidently the register was short. We were so hungry we toughed it out, but really it was the WORST EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE! WORST!",

I personally prefer to score reviews based solely on the the food, but the excruciating wait for our food was just unacceptable, even for a grand opening...and yet we waited.  I'm a huge chicken &amp; waffles fan and so far, Roscoe's is still the one to beat. My friends and I happened to stumble upon this place by chance on Saturday and was told the place just opened the day before. Surely I was excited to see if this place could offer better...  So is the food better than Roscoe's? Yes and No. Gussie's nailed the fried chicken department. It's very delicious with a nice mix of spices and seasoning. And crispy without being overly fried and greasy. The meat is tender and juicy - better than Roscoe's.  But what counts the most are the waffles and this is where Roscoe's still crowns supreme. Still, Gussie's served up some pretty good waffles with the right amount of chewiness and texture. They're lightly crisp around the edges and smothered with butter, makes for a damn good meal. But for taste alone, Roscoe's secret blend just can't be beat. But Gussie's does come close.  Unfortunately, the wait for our food here was beyond what is considered acceptable by any means. Sure, we gave them the benefit of the doubt, but seriously, how hard is it to screw up making batches of waffles and fried chicken ? After our orders were taken, we waited an HOUR before we got served and the staff even managed to mix up our orders . At least they provided us with samplers of their sides.  The staff is friendly nonetheless and the interior decor is very upscale- you wouldn't even know you were at a waffle house going in. And prices are reasonable. I'm sure service will improve once the weeks go by...but damn...",

I was really craving authentic fried catfish and this place is within walking distance so I decided to try it.   I got my food to-go. So anyway, I get inside and the delivery guy was pretty annoyed with the kitchen because his orders weren't being processed fast enough. After about 15 mins of waiting and no line in front of me I finally got my order in. I ordered the catfish plate and a substitution of the eggs for greens. And an a la carte chicken breast. Another 15 mins pass and the cashier was really sweet so I was patient. I get my food and go home.  I was pretty annoyed that I got home and realized, both the biscuit and grits that came with my meal were left out and I'm willing to bet those greens were canned Sylvia's collard greens...way too sweet and definitely not home made. The fish was fresh and the chicken was pretty good. Somehow I got potato salad and it was decent. I give them 3 stars only because I miss the south and the fish was a quick fix and because the cashier was sweet. But honestly it should've been 2 stars for-meh, I've experienced better   Bottom line: The food was still only subpar...not completely authentic southern food and wait time a little long but I was told they were a little short staffed. I could've just gone to Popeyes down the street and been satisfied.",

It was probably the perfect time because they were not busy as I would have imagined on a Sunday morning. \u00a0I ordered Gussie's Signature Sweet Potato Waffles with two pieces of chicken legs. \u00a0My fiance ordered the Southern Comfort (two delicious original waffles, two pieces southern fried chicken and two eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese and onions). When our plates were placed on our table, the aroma of the sweet potato, butter and fried chicken suddenly woke me and my appetite...it looked oh, so good! The chicken legs were crispy outside and really moist inside, just how it should be! The batter was really light, not a whole lot of buttermilk and fried flour taste--if you love friend chicken...ya'll know what I mean. :)   I will definitely come back...very soon.",

Figured the combo of greasy chicken and syrup covered waffles would help increase my stamina on a cold Sunday afternoon! \u00a0  So the joint was hopping and it took some time to get our order in, but the menu is so large we needed some questions answered, oddly enough we settled on the Southern Comfort. \u00a0The whitemeat chicken was very dry, so stick to the dark meat. \u00a0  The waffles weren't crisp, but if you like them like soft sandwich bread, then this is your place. One waffle was so underdone, we thought we were supposed to cook them ourselves.  I wont be back very soon, but when the urge exists, I'll try the Yams and sausages.  Tips: \u00a0And be sure to try the cornbread and maple syrup... \u00a0Go for dark meat for moistness!",

    "review_text": "Gussie's was the quintessential one-star dining experience: unimpressive on all counts.  When we arrived, we were told that the wait would be 40 minutes. \u00a0I was incredulous, as there were only two tables in front of us on the waiting list, and we are, after all, talking about fried chicken and waffles here. \u00a0How long could it take? \u00a0Surprisingly long, as it turns out.  After around 20 minutes we were seated. We noticed that we seemed to be flanked by dissatisfied diners; we overheard one couple next to us who had been waiting for an hour and a half. \u00a0For chicken. And waffles. \u00a0It took a while for the server to take our drink orders, and then we settled in to what would end up being over an hour wait. \u00a0I know this because we timed it with a stopwatch. \u00a0Here are our notes:  6 minutes: Mimosa arrived. 10 minutes: Our food order is taken: Uptown special (1 waffle and a chicken breast) and 2 cornmeal waffles with drumsticks. 20 minutes: We find out the folks next to us have been here for an hour and a half. 38 minutes: The server tires to bring us another mimosa which we didn't order. \u00a0 40 minutes: The server comes back with the same mimosa and leaves it on the table. \u00a0I have to flag her down and convince her that we didn't order it. \u00a0Later this mimosa somehow finds its way onto the bill of the couple to our left, who also didn't order it. \u00a0 49 minutes: Tummy growl 54 minutes: Food arrives. \u00a0My order is wrong (wings instead of a chicken breast), but I resolve to eat my meal instead of waiting any longer. 1:09 Finished meal. 1:14 Check arrives.  Here's the deal: \u00a0  1. This place is too pricey for what it is. \u00a0Fried chicken and waffles (even cornmeal or sweet potato or whatever) shouldn't be $13+ a plate, unless it's really something special. \u00a0However...  2. \u00a0The quality just isn't there. \u00a0The food was ok, and the cornmeal waffles were tasty enough, but its nothing special. \u00a0You can make a better waffle, without the wait and the terrible service. \u00a0Which brings me to the...  3. Long wait and terrible service. \u00a0This is supposed to be simple and hearty food that comes out quickly. \u00a0No one is there to sip drinks and savor to ambiance (of which, by the way, there is none). \u00a0This kind of place should fill you up quickly so you can go about your lazy Sunday in a chicken n' waffle induced euphoria.  Hopefully I have provided reasonable evidence to support my 1 star review. \u00a0In the time this meal took, I could have learned how to make chicken and waffles myself, procured all the relevant ingredients, and prepared a delicious meal for a fraction of the cost. \u00a0My advice is to stay away.",

In short the service in and of itself is enough to make this a one star review. It took a half hour to get our order placed. Another hour for it to be cooked.   The waffles weren't bad but they were a bit soggy. In Gussie's defense though the chicken was definitely freshly fried, and was pretty good.   The cherry on the whole thing though was that a meal for four came to $65, we put in $80 expecting to get change. It never came. We definitely will not be returning.",

Food Quality: 4 out of 5. \u00a0Everything that I ordered was available this time. \u00a0Mac &amp; Cheese, greens and chicken was on point. \u00a0The yams cold use some help though. \u00a0Put a little extra soul into it and you can hide the fact that they are canned yams.  Overall my second experience was far superior than my initial encounter with Gussie's. \u00a0The staff was on point, food was fast and good and the manager (Chance) took good care of me. \u00a0My only recommendation is that you serve the sides with \"A Taste of the South\" in bowls so that the chicken and cornbread do not get soggy.  Gussie's Round 3-   This time I took a different friend to try to blend in and to obtain a different perspective. \u00a0I waited nearly 30 mins for my friend to show up. \u00a0Gussie's staff was great as they frequently offered me drinks until my friend arrived. \u00a0When she did finally show up, Gussie's staff \u00a0complemented me on my patience in waiting. \u00a0she felt bad which turned out to be a good thing for me :)  The Food: \u00a0This time I decided to try there signature Chicken and Waffle's...It was great! \u00a0Typically I don't care for wings but they had the right amount of flavor and crispness. \u00a0The waffle was a nice golden brown and the syrup tasted like it was real maple...delicious!  Conclusion: \u00a0Now since I have finally completed this installment of my review on Gussie's I will be back. \u00a0And similar to other late night eatery gems such as papusa's, burritos and pizza, Gussie's will now be enshrined as a must eat restaurant for any out of town guest and post late night evening events.",

Okay, that itself deserves 5 stars. I mean they could have told me they couldn't serve the sandwich because they were out of bread, but they sent someone out to get more bread so I could have my sandwich. Seriously, if I could give them 10 stars for their service I would do it. That's dedication to customer service right there.  Not to mention the food was just as amazing as ever.

Just that error caused my lunch partner to give her an offensively low tip, even though she really enjoyed her food. \u00a0But then, this particular lunch partner, needs very little encouragement to leave small tips where ever she goes anyway. \u00a0 Normally, in a situation like that I would have made up the difference to give the server a tip that would represent at least 15%, but I just didn't have enough money with me that day, to pay for my item and then also tip for two people. \u00a0That was really embarrassing for me. \u00a0I wouldn't be surprised if the waitress cussed us out after she saw what was left on the table for her. \u00a0  Although I'm a generous tipper, I don't like wasting my money on \"blah\" food, so Gussie's will not get a third visit out of me. \u00a0My lunch partner has no shame, so she will most likely be back to eat at Gussie's again, with her \"non-tipping\" self.",

    "review_text": "Wow some folks have been exceedingly harsh on Gussies but I've always had a good experience from the food to the service. This long overdue review highlights my faves at Gussie's. \u00a0  First off, I don't really like chicken and waffles so in full disclosure, I've never had the waffles here. That doesn't stop me from coming here despite the namesake because I think the fried chicken is pretty tasty. Sunday's Best combines perfectly fried chicken smothered in gravy (lots of gravy) with comfort sides like collards and red beans and rice. Top this with some cornbread that is the right amount of sweet and savory. You also get breakfast all day - there are few places in SF serving country fried steak and this caloric monster (worth the occasional indulgence) always nostalgically brings me back to the south. Gussies ups theirs with a bacon gravy + eggs, home fries and a biscuit. Big portions here so the prices come down when you consider your to go box. \u00a0   The weekday lunch buffet is pretty decent and is a good choice if you like variety. You get the fried chicken + comfort side like mac and cheese and candied yams but you also get to sample other items like fried catfish nuggets or the herb roasted chicken. Decent selection especially if it's your first visit but for $12, I would prefer to order off the menu and get some fresh fried chicken instead. Happy hour is another good time to try Gussies out. Afore-mentioned catfish nuggets and all other apps are half off and pints go for $2.75. They set you up nicely for some fried chicken action after.   Lastly, Gussies is one of those places where this deep-fried chicken loving fella can satisfy those cravings while having lunch with a vegan friend. That's right. Gussies does a vegetarian plate that can also be made vegan upon request and it's a nice plate of vegetarian comfort food. In a city where Southern comfort food is often hard to find, I'm glad at least we have Gussies.",

Service here is always excellent. Waitresses are really helpful when you need some help with ordering or giving suggestions.   The reason why I decided to give them 4 stars instead of 5 was because they don't really have a lot of Chicken Breast options.

I went on a Friday which I believe was Throwback Friday where they have a DJ spinning 90s jams and a buffet with a two drink minimum. My party, which consisted of the Mister, a friend and I, didn't go for the buffet but the drinks we ordered we delicious. One was a fruit sangria, the southern bell, and a bellini. We had the hushpuppies for an appetizer and it was fried perfection. The chicken was crispy, juicy and the waffle was chewy and delicious. I enjoyed the syrup the most. It must have been a hazelnut or maple butter that didn't taste like your run of the mill syrup at the grocery store.   All in all, the food at Gussie's is straightforward and homey. When I go back, I will definitely try the buffet and return on Fridays for Throwback Fridays. The music was on point! It just added a good, down, homey feel to the conversation and brought back some good groovin' memories.",

Now I'm a lover of the Chicken and Waffles combination and I will make the trips to Atlanta for Glady's, L.A. for Roscoe's, and Oakland for House of Chicken and Waffles and this place by far is a poor excuse and should never be included in the same sentence as these other reputable establishments again.  First of all, when you walk into any restaurant there should a host, a sign, or something to kind of give you the down low as to what you should expect. Walking in around 1 p.m. for a casual Friday lunch I expected it to be a little busier but not busy enough that there was no one around to greet you at the door. I proceeded to do what any curious person would do and just peruse through the menu as I waited. That gave both my boyfriend and I enough time to pick out what we wanted and by that time, the host casually walked up, plucked the menus out of our hands after giving us a dirty look for enough touching them before they were given to us and sat us at a tiny table even though the entire restaurant was about 20% full.   Initial experience aside, I didn't come here for 3 star Michelin service so the greeting was brushed off to the side. We sat down, studied the menu again to ensure our choices were truly what we wanted and waited. And waited. And waited. For about 10-15 minutes. Then our server came by to get drink orders and the full order because at that point, I wasn't going to let her get away from us. We ordered the sweet tea, downtown special and the sweet potato waffles.  The food came out in a timely manner but this became the trifecta of a bad meal:  1. The waffles were rubbery. 2. The syrup? The syrup was like candy and my sweet tea was thicker \u00a0than the pathetic excuse for syrup they placed on my plate. 3. My chicken has hairs. HAIRS!! 4. My chicken was bone dry which is hard for dark meat to do. 5. I'm not paying $1 more for decent syrup-that's an insult. 6. She never once offered a refill. 7. She never once checked in on us. 8. Chicken skin was burned to the point where it cut the roof of my mouth. 9. The syrup was no nasty, my poor boyfriend only pushed his plate around and asked for a bubble tea to get rid of the sicky sweet taste.  For $30, it was a waste of space and time for us that fateful Friday afternoon. The only time our server was prompt with anything was the bill when my boyfriend finally motioned for it with his credit card. I get the feel that they're vastly understaffed but I believe they're out of their honeymoon period and novelty will wear off soon if they keep their practices up.",

Kinda sucks but it is similar to the true chicken and waffle places in harlem.  Food.  Fried chicken was a bit underseasoned and could use salt. The batter must be a bit too thin or too watery. The skin basically starts crispy for the first 5 minutes and gets soggy quickly so eat it fast.   Waffles were great. Nicely crispy yet tender on the inside. Definitely the best option here. Get the maple syrup.  Greens. Very nicely seasoned and braised. Perhaps a bit too acidic, but overall a good example of cookery.  Candied yams. Too rich. The yams were perhaps too buttery and rich to eat. You could only really consume a bite or two.  Mac and cheese. Overall average. Very rich and uses white cheddar. Perhaps a bit underflavored. Salt does not make up for the mediocre cheddar they used.  Value. Probably one of the better values in SF. Without a doubt worth the 10-15$ per plate.",

Chicken and waffles make a delicious pair (even though my boyfriend's first response was... seriously?!).  Came here with another couple on a Groupon deal. Parking wasn't difficult to find, but we came on a rainy Saturday. I expect since it's in the Fillmore district, parking normally would be hard. So plan ahead to look around.  The restaurant is nothing fancy. It has ample space for a lot of customers and will easily fill up during dinner time. The place is very comfy, great servers, good level of noise.  Among the four of us, we shared two servings of chicken and waffles, an appetizer of catfish nuggets and an order of 'Taste of the South'. Chicken and waffles are just chicken and waffles. It's nothing fancy - but the waffles were buttery and soft, the chicken was crispy (and great with either gravy or honey). The taste of the south wasn't exactly my favorite, but my friends really liked their candied yams and baked mac-n-cheese.  Definitely would come back when I'm craving something unhealthy. :)",

I ordered the chicken lover's omelet and my wife ordered the uptown special. My meal was very good. Loved the grits and omelet. My wife had the uptown special which consisted of a large waffle and a large fried chicken breast. The waffle was good and they gave you a large pitcher of syrup. The chicken however was really dry which was disappointing. You'd think with one of their staples that they would get it right. Overall the food was good and a nice atmosphere. Towards the end of the meal it became much more crowded and there was still only the one waiter. We had to flag down the busboy to pay our bill. They definitely need more staff.",

Go figure lol.  ========================== (August 2009) Yes, two stars because I've most certainly experienced better. No skin off my a** to those who resent the two or three stars. Some of the people who left reviews for this with 5 stars couldn't have had any other chicken waffles in their life. I can't understand. So funny. Visited on a Wednesday night, right after the ProAm game - around 10pm The ice water they serve doesn't taste like milk lol. That is definitely a plus plus plus to me. The macaroni and cheese was just macaroni and some cheese, period.  No oooohs or ahhhhhs; more like no no no nos. My friend ordered some cornbread and it look as dry as the cornmeal before the batter is made. The waffle and my one chicken breast wow. I ordered the Uptown Special - one chicken breast &amp;amp; one waffle, though I think breawsts should come in twos just like the thighs do. that's besides the poin though. When the waiters brought out our plates, we were looking at each other like uh where is the rest of my chicken that we ordered. did u accidentally put the rest of my one piece of chicken on the other person's plate, and u left the other ones in the fryer? At least the flavor wasn't lacking but damn. I wouldn't mind paying the 12 bucks understanding the restaurant business is expensive esp in san fran, but sheesh. The waffle was thin and more chewy than waffle crispy texture. The syrup tasted like there was some kind of coconut after taste. Service: Well there was only about four tables occupied and the ratio of employees to patrons was like 10 to 1. Kind people. I rather have them stuck up or snobby, serving great food. Oh well. I might give the restaurant another try but not for another few months.",

First i want to give a shout out to to the awesome hostess last night (Friday 4/13) who was super flexible with us given that many of our guests were arriving late. She did what she could to put us at an accommodating table and was very patient. Once I was seated, it got weird.  I first witnessed a poor busboy trying to deliver a tray of waters, dump it all over another patron's table. Shit happens right? The guy cleaned up the deluge of water and was apologetic. Moving on.  We're still sitting waiting for our order to be taken when around the corner comes a woman from the buffet with a stacked plate. Lo and behold, she slips on the puddle of water on the floor from the spill and goes down. The plate explodes and shards of ceramic, mac n cheese, collards and chicken fly everywhere. Restaurant goes ape shit.  After a 5 minute struggle trying to get the woman off the floor, the mess gets cleaned up. The best part was the wait staff accommodating the lady by dragging a table over to practically where she went down so she could sit there and eat rather than walking back to her original table. Again, weird. The amazing hostess then got the woman plates of food from the buffet for the rest of the night so she didn't have to walk.  The food was good. I got the downtown special with a side of mac. Totally superb and I'm from South Carolina so I know what's legit.  Overall an interesting experience.

The woman that seated us acted pretty rude. \u00a0I understand that she could be having a bad day and/or they were stressed, but she gave us the cold shoulder and wouldn't seat us at a table near the back corner (not the actual back of the restaurant) because there happened to be a reservation there.

The restaurant seemed pretty empty when we asked why we couldn't be seated anywhere else AND THEN she explained that we couldn't be seated anywhere else besides this one table in the middle and she left my parents pretty annoyed and I; feeling pretty awkward.  I ordered some fried chicken (dark meat) with a side a collard greens and mac n cheese, and the chicken tasted pretty bland but had a nice golden crust. My dad ordered something similar instead with white meat, and black eyed peas and some rice and beans. Technically, just mediocre.  Here's what my mom ordered: some type of seafood chowder (I forgot what it was but it really was not worth remembering) that came lukewarm/cold..not even warm, at our table. And she ordered some fried catfish. Both of which were bland and really disgusting. The candied yams that my mother had on the side were good though. I mean, that was a plus. I mean I am really really sorry, but it was gross.   Our server was such a sweet guy, the candied yams were good. The whole experience of eating here seems like one of those embarrassing moments you never want to think about.",

Not as crispy as I like, but I kinda left it on my plate for awhile.   I would give this place a 4 stars if it wasn't for the horrible service we got right when we walked in. Supposedly they were training a new hostess, but she passed by me and my friend more than 3 times without acknowledging us or even making any eye contact. And then when we asked why she seated another party of 2 who came in after us first, she gave us all these excuses which might be legitimate. However, when we were waiting, she was super friendly to this other couple and almost seated them before us. They were nice enough to tell her we were there first, and then she seated us. Everything else took super long, waiting for the menu, water, AND the bill. The food came out fast tho. This place would have way more potential if they hired more ppl or ran more efficiently.",

Although the sweet tea and cornbread were good, they weren't special, I wouldn't order them again.   The only minor problem I had was with the service.

The candied yum (which typically is favorite) was too chunky, not smooth, and didn't taste all that great. The mac 'n cheese looked hopeful, but didn't taste great at all either. The chicken was better, but again, not the best I've had. It was too greasy and most of the chicken was bone. The Red Velvet is worth a try for sure - where else can you get red velvet waffles? But, note that if you're not sweet on sweets (hah, pun intended), it's not going to be that great. Even for my boyfriend who isn't picky at all, could hardly finish it.  It's also far from bart stations or anything in general so unless you live around the area, it's a hassle to get to. Definitely not sure if I'll ever go back.",

I love chicken and waffles and was excited to discover a new spot in San Francisco.  i went during brunch-time and it was very frustrating. The coffee took 15 minutes, the meal came after close to AN HOUR. The orange juice was sour, and the list goes on. The chicken was just OK, but definitely would have preferred almost anything else, even KFC. The waffles were also on the dry side and cold.  The \"sausage\" and \"home fries\" dish was embarrassing. The sausage was a slightly red and burnt hot dog and the potatoes were a mashed mess.   I say definitely don't come here for breakfast, but if you've never tried chicken and waffles, you might give it a chance.

To be fair, we were seated immediately when our entire six person party was complete. \u00a0That's where the good service ended. \u00a0At this point, we'd met the threshold for an automatic gratuity so I suppose there was little in it for the server.  We waited for ten minutes before being greeted. \u00a0At the table, there wasn't a drink menu so we wasted our first long-awaited interaction with the server asking for said drink menu (they were out of three listed beers). \u00a0The table then decided that we would make the most of our server's next rare visit and order everything all at once.  I ordered a cup of gumbo ($8.29! a bowl was $10.29) and the grits cakes. \u00a0The gumbo was marginal, a mealy mess with stringy chicken and rice with perhaps four small pieces of the purported chicken sausage. \u00a0It was described in the menu as being garnished with fried okra, but didn't arrive as such. \u00a0The grits cakes were also described as being served with a jalapeno artichoke dipping sauce, but this sauce didn't arrive. \u00a0The cakes had nice flavor, but due to their size, they'd be hard to have as an appetizer for more than 3. \u00a0I would suggest they make the cakes smaller as to make them more plentiful.  My daughter ordered a chicken sandwich and the server failed to ask her which side she wanted. \u00a0He returned minutes later to get her macaroni and cheese selection.  A member of my party ordered the Taste of the South with greens. \u00a0It arrived with rice and beans and no warning of such. \u00a0Apparently they'd run out of greens (!).  All in all, everyone at the table enjoyed their food. \u00a0Another member that actually got waffles said that they were the best she'd ever had.  My daughter ordered the chocolate/coffee/kahlua pound cake. \u00a0It was nothing short of amazing. \u00a0We came to this selection because they were out of red velvet cake (!)  My thought is that if you're new, you know you'll make your money on the weekends, so I'm unclear as to why they would be out of various items for a big night. \u00a0Randomly, despite being out of greens, as we exited the restaurant, the foyer/bar area reeked of the stench of collard greens. \u00a0It makes me wonder if the server fibbed on their availability to cover his error in entering the order (there were three Tastes of the South ordered, he probably failed to differentiate the greens order).  We'd heard before that the service was terrible, our experience doesn't dispute that.  The food is perhaps worth it if you're in the area.",

The chicken: with their syrup was really good, otherwise, it was a little tough.  The waffle: Mmmmm... i could eat these waffles all day. One waffle is probably enough though. I got pretty full after devouring mine.   The collard greens: They were too bitter for me. I personally like them a little saltier.   Okra: I think this is what got me apart from the waffles. I love okra, and the batter around these little guys was delicious, especially when paired with the remoulade sauce they give you.   My friend got their Mac and Cheese, and I think that one is also a winner.   I wouldn't come back here for the chicken or collard greens but the waffles, okra, and syrup are awesome.

Got 1/2 a fried chicken with 2 sweet potato waffles &amp; a side of cornbread. If it weren't for a discounted certificate, it would have cost me $24 vs the $12 I paid. Short version: underwhelmed. Did we go on an off night? Certainly not a 4 star experience.   The service was friendly but not smooth.   Fried chicken - Got all white meat &amp; wasn't too dry - only a little dry. Looked good but not crispy &amp; would have preferred more seasoning in the batter. The breasts &amp; wings were good sized at least. Not dwarf sized like KFC.   Sweet potato waffles - Super thin! At first I thought they shorted me 1 waffle because they were so thin. Not like in the photos. Where was the sweet potato? Pureed or cut into microscopic pieces? They were soggy &amp; too thin to be fluffy. I can make much better waffles in my belgian waffle iron at home. Plus for the price, it should include pure maple syrup instead of charging $1 extra for it.   Cornbread - eh, I can make better. Tasted like from a box. No corn kernels in it. Would prefer drier &amp; more corn flavor.   Friend got the peach cobbler. It didn't look edible - pale, goopy, cold &amp; not served with ice cream! Huh? WTH? It was described as being cooked in an iron pan but arrived in a glass bowl. Again, I can make better at home - in fact I spent every day for a week perfecting peach cobbler.   The friend who took me there stated that the food quality is inconsistent. Too bad.",

We arrived at 6:50p and saw several open tables. The hostess asked if we had a reservation (we didn't), and then told us that there would be a half hour wait. We both looked back into the dining area. \"But it's empty in there.\" That's right, on second glance, it was maybe a quarter full.  We were told that all of the tables in there were reserved. A couple of girls walked in a few minutes after us and were given the same story. One of them pulled out her phone, went to Open Table, and found a 7p reservation for 2. She booked it, called the hostess back over, and showed her the reservation. Defeated, the hostess seated them. I wish I had thought to check OpenTable!  The chicken and waffles are delicious, but not excitably better than most other places serving chicken and waffles. Go here if you're in the area and craving a chicken and waffle fix, but make sure to get a reservation.",

    "review_text": "Sunday afternoon at 1:15. Tried to do the waitress a favor by sitting at the bar because she told us it was busy. She came back a few minutes later and asked for our drinks. This simple task took around 10-15 minutes and for awhile we had no idea who was serving us. After pathetically waiving down one of our two-three waitresses we placed an order.  The order took at least 45 minutes. We tried to order an appetizer and it supposively came \u00a0with our entrees. It took so long. The waitresses were seemingly retarded or overstimulated because there were some really simple/few demands stemming from our side.   Food? um, ok? I agree nothing very special about the waffle or syrup but when consumed in correct order (with fried chx and eggs) simply cannot go wrong.  The one star is because I did not feel a need to tip. I have worked in several restuarants (local frisco) and would never not tip someone because of poor service; it is supposed to be an understanding. However here I felt completely unnoticed and blatently unimportant (we watched the hostess talked like blah blah for at least 10 minutes!). \u00a0In fact, I felt a srtong urge to stand up and leave after a ten minute wait to process and print my check (not including paying for it). Also, some serious stingy behavior with the whole pure maple syrup for an extra dollar. None of those ingredients are expensive and the prices are already steeeep.  The busser (mexican dude) did an awesome job. Fives stars dude  THIS PLACE CLAIMS TO BE A WAFFLE HOUSE IN THE HEART OF THE FILLMORE AND IS A LET DOWN WHEN CONSIDERING THE COUNTLESS TRULY WONDERFUL THINGS SAN FRANCISCO HAS TO OFFER.

Two old-fashioned cornmeal waffles prepared light and crispy with two pieces of succulent fried chicken or three crispy fried chicken wings 12.59). There's an option to order real maple syrup (additional dollar) over the regular syrup. (Advice...charge the extra buck and deliver just the maple syrup...much better. ) The chicken was cooked perfectly. The waffles were as fluffy as advertised. Service was good, decor was...well, it was fine. The prices were a bit high for the offering, the chicken was a bit on the small side though the waffles were big.

Some of my friends who joined me are from the South, and they said this food is very authentic.   -Prices are VERY reasonable and very generous portions. -The fried chicken is excellent; it felt very high quality, the meat was cooked perfectly, and even though it was fried, it didn't taste greasy or heavy. Very yummy &amp; crispy, and perfectly seasoned. -The green beans are SO delicious-- they were so good my friends actually stole most of them off my plate when I wasn't looking. - Mac n' cheese rocked - The waffles were SO, SO good!!  - The fries were excellent. I did find the yams a bit too sweet (but my friends gladly finished them for me). - Corn bread was fantastic  Also: For this birthday dinner, we came as a party of 15, and I was VERY impressed. Nice ambiance and feel to the restaurant. The staff was extremely sweet and accommodating- even though we had more people than we anticipated, they graciously added another end-table to fit in the extra people. We had excellent service and often several waiters would assist our party, check in with us, refill drinks, etc. Our main waitress kept checking in with us to make sure everything was perfect.  Bonus: For my friend's birthday, we brought in her favorite, home-made cake. The waitstaff took the cake in the kitchen, put in candles, presented the cake, and then served it to us with whipped cream and little chocolate syrup swirl designs on the plate--- no extra charge! They were SO sweet!!!! \u00a0I don't think I have ever seen such amazing service. It was really refreshing to eat out in SF and have such a attentive and sweet waitstaff.  Definitely try this place-- food is excellent, great bang for your buck, and everyone who works here is really friendly. I will definitely be coming back.",

Not having that big an appetite, i ordered the \"downtown special\" of 1 waffle and dark meat chicken. \u00a0The waffle was super yummy! \u00a0Homemade and thin served with a big dollop of honey butter and their brown sugar syrup. \u00a0Mmm, just describing this for you is making my mouth water for it again! \u00a0The fried chicken thighs were nicely battered and browned. \u00a0Crispy but maybe fried a bit too long for my taste. \u00a0But the batter had a nice taste with just the right amount of spices added to it.  My friend had the sweet potato waffles which were really good...had a nice sweetness to it. \u00a0She loved them so much that she finished them off and left most of her chicken on her plate because she was so full from the waffles.  We also ordered deep fried okra as an appetizer, which IMO weren't really tasty. \u00a0The batter seemed too thick on some of the okra so you couldn't taste it much. \u00a0The pieces that had a thin coating were just fine. \u00a0Overall though, once you added some hot sauce to the okra the taste improved.  I'd try this place again if someone wanted to go but I wouldn't go out of my way and make the drive from San Jose just for chicken and waffles.  They do offer a buffet on the 4th Sunday of every month...might try that so I can get a taste of more of their dishes.",

This might seem expected (because I am so loveable) but this women knew just what I needed &amp; she called it like she see's it. I imagine she see's a lot of people like me; bloodshot eyes, drooling at the mouth for food that might absorb the previous nights poison and slightly impatient for a little hair of the dog. She called me out, and then politely explained to myself &amp; the group how they do it as Gussies, where the name came from, the upcoming Food Network events, and most importantly the best item on the menu!   Drinks were served (Mimosa's of course) and food was ordered. I trusted Marilyn and went with the Sweet Potato Waffle with Sweet Potato Syrup and 3 pieces of chicken!!! As we guzzled our mimosa's we were also informed that Queen Gussie was in the house! What a treat, a chance to meet the queen herself! This idea was quickly forgotten as plates of chicken and waffles began to arrive at the table. No need to wait for my dining companies, I went fork first into my orange colored waffle. Sweet potato covered in sweeter potato, I really can't think of any other carb-tastic way to start off my morning. I was kind, and shared my sweet potato syrup with my friends because they were not as wise as me and didn't order as Marilyn directed. I could see the jealously in their tummies and heard the sweetness in their voices when they asked Marilyn for the recipe. I'm pretty sure that once you go sweet potato syrup you never go back. \u00a0  Just as my stomach was beginning to reach maximum capacity, the Queen exited the building passing our outdoor table.

    "review_text": "I always thought that both the fried chicken and the waffles here were equally mediocre, which should certainly spell certain doom for a place with those two foods both in its name. That being said, sometimes you crave grease and sweetness and you need something hearty for breakfast because the night before you passed out after drinking four beers and eating a handful of dry rice krispy treats.  So until yesterday, Gussie's and I always had this relationship where I'd go eat there and kind of enjoy it and kind of not. But two things happened yesterday to make me reconsider my opinion of the place. One, my girlfriend ordered the fried chicken sandwich. The chicken and breading and everything on the sandwich were far superior to the wings I usually get with the Fillmore Special. The sandwich was so god, it had us both comparing it to Bakesale Betty's in the east bay.   Unfortunately, the other thing that happened was that after taking a bite into her salad (by the way, get the salad with ranch and put it on the aforementioned fried chicken sandwich - it's divine), my girlfriend heard a crunch. Not a good, crispy crunchy sound, but a \"holy shit, there's a handful of dirt and topsoil in my salad\" sound. And, sure as semen, there were several leaves visibly covered in dirt.   I don't know how the ratings for restaurant cleanliness are calculated, but if a place FORGETS TO WASH ITS PRODUCE, then I think nothing more than a C- is warranted.   Yes, we complained, and yes we were perfectly in our right to. We got a 20% off discount, which probably might have been more significant if I hadn't licked her plate clean for the fried chicken sandwich crumbs.   We also ordered an orange juice that never showed up.  So the question is: does a delicious fried chicken sandwich make up for mediocre service and dirt in a salad? I don't know. Not really.",

I would say the seasoning was there--it could have been a little more tender on the inside and crispy on the outside, but it's better to cook thoroughly than to undercook, so no complaints.

I ordered the uptown but with a vegan buckwheat waffle (not because I'm vegan but because I'm lactose intolerant), heck yeah! The buckwheat was good! Sure I'd love to have had the sweat potato waffle but I have to play it on the safe side. As for the breast of chicken, holy snap that was darn near perfect! It was juicy but had the deep fried skin we all shouldn't love but do!  How much did I enjoy my meal?

No, this isn't my lame attempt at playing \"The $25,000 Pyramid\" against myself. (I grew up watching 80s game show reruns on the USA network, hence the reference.)  These are foods that work oh so well together, and after my meal at Gussie's, undoubtedly chicken and waffles should be part of this list!   Before I get into the food, there are a couple of noteworthy things I wanted to point out about the overall experience. First of all, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there was absolutely no wait to eat here at 7:30 on a Friday. Score! (These days, I feel like the minimum 30-minute wait is an obligatory part of the SF dining experience.) I also very much appreciated the service - everyone was very friendly, and our waiter in particular was all about the details. For example, when my husband accidentally dropped his knife, our trusty waiter noticed that and brought over a clean knife with fresh napkins without our even needing to ask for one. When we ordered coffee to go with our dessert, he apologized for the short wait for the coffee but mentioned it was because he started a fresh pot since the one that was ready had been sitting out for a while. This level of attentiveness was yet another pleasant surprise...something we didn't expect at a \"roll up your sleeves and dig in\" type of place.  And now for the moment of truth: the food. I very much enjoyed both the chicken and waffles. The waffles had a nice almond-esque flavor and were the right level of crisp. (I've had my share of soggy waffles before, which = no bueno.) The chicken, though tasty, wasn't the same level as the revered Gus' in Memphis or Willie Mae's in New Orleans. The batter had a good flavor to it, but where I feel the chicken slighty missed the mark was the texture. It wasn't as moist as it could have been and the batter felt a bit heavy (though not terribly so).   However, the one menu item that blew my mind was the mac n cheese. My husband and I both agreed that this was probably the best mac n cheese we've ever had, and we're both certified mac n cheese-ologists. The cheese had formed this delicious crust around some of the noodles, and in other parts of the dish, it was smooth and creamy. Overall, it tasted like it had been pan-fried first and then baked. But no matter how it was cooked, it was pure heaven! The turnip greens and the peach cobbler skillet were also good, but the standout was really the mac n cheese.  Just as I have made my fried chicken pilgrimages in New Orleans and Memphis, I'm similarly going to have to do one for chicken and waffles and try the one and only Roscoe's in L.A., but I'm glad to have gotten my start with this new fab food pairing at Gussie's!",

Such a simple meal can taste so damn good. The Mac and cheese, I don't know what they put in it but it's so delicious! It's cheesy in all the right ways and the macaroni shells aren't over or undercooked. The chicken was fried to perfection. The skin was just the right amount of crispy and the meat super moist inside- YUM. The syrup that comes with the waffle is warm and adds a more home-y feeling to it.

Food was great with very generous portions. So much so that I ate everything and saved the chicken cause I thought it would hold up the best as a left over. OMG its sooooooo good. I love the spicy syrup and the sweet potatoes. The combo of sweet and spice is perfect and leaves you trying to figure out how they get it to be so good. Didnt have the waffles but the cornbread was good as well as the mac and cheese. Service was great, we didnt have to wait for seating and felt well taken care of but the waiter. There was also a live band which made conversation a bit difficult but still was a nice change of pace from the usual SF fair. So glad I found this place.",

I had the lunch special for $7.49, which consisted of 2 fried chicken thighs (nice size, a bit too crispy for me, but the meat was juicy) ... a side of red beans and rice (very tasty, had strips of pork in it) ... cornbread (best I have ever eaten). A delicious, filling lunch for the money.  One of my friend's had a grilled chicken sandwich. The breast was a extremely generous.  My other friend, who introduced this place to us, had sweet potato pancakes. They looked real good...nice and golden brown.  The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but for lunch hour I would go again and try something new. I like their Southern menu. They serve breakfast all day -- so this is something I will try next time. The decor is modern, with jazz music playing in the background.",

Fried Chicken= a bit on the dry side, not impressed. Waffles= tasty but not crispy if you like them that way. Syrup amazing! Sweet potatoe (they spell it like Dan Quail does) tots= MUST try!! fried chicken liver w/onion rings= great to share with a group black eyed peas and greens=great! My bf said the pork chops were good but a bit overcooked and the gravy was great. Banana pudding= very good! rich and the Nilla wafers were still crisp.  Just got home from a dinner for 7 on a Saturday night. We had a reservation so no problem waiting for a table. The waitress, (Maria I think) was very sweet and pretty attentive.  The dinners are huge and almost nobody cleared their plates. Our 3 appetizers were great, \u00a0Fried chicken liver and onion rings, the sweet potato tater tots, and the cat fish nuggets were yummy but probably the least favorite of the 3. My friend observed the the deep fried stuff felt \"light\" I ordered Uptown, 1 piece of chicken and 1 waffle. The waffle was tasty and the syrup was delicious but they were barely browned and more chewy then I like. I ordered a thigh but got a leg. The bus guy said he would bring me a thigh (and handed me the plate including the leg) but never came back with it. I wouldn't have made a big deal but the drumstick was overcooked and dry. Eventually we asked the waitress and she did bring out a thigh but by the time it arrived, everyone else had finished their meals.  we split the bill 6 ways for 7 people and each paid about $33 which included tip and a few beers and \"Soulgria\".",

So I asked him if I could ask for more gravy because that thing I kid you not had about 2 tablespoon of gravy. He quickly and gladly gave me some :) Which I really appreciated because this help salvage the dry chicken.  *Tax &amp; Tip included I paid $18 for a disappointing meal.   I would give it another try though, because I believe it takes a few tries.",

I did like that they topped it with fried okra though The Red Beans and Rice... In my opinion, could have been a bit smokier with more Ham The Greens...

I finally got the chance to try this after my buddy Michelle found an awesome Groupon deal: $10 for $20 worth of food.  We met here for lunch on a Wednesday at 1-- just in time for their $12 weekday lunch buffet [Tuesday to Friday, 11-3]. The waitress was nice enough to let us browse the buffet before deciding if we wanted to get it. It consisted of chicken, veggies, and mac &amp; cheese. We decided we wanted the full authentic experience so we ordered the Uptown Special for about $10: one chicken breast and one waffle. We also ordered sides of cornbread [$1 for three squares] and mac &amp; cheese [less than $3].   The food was finger lickin' yummy and the portions were ample, but my only complaint was the super slow service. At one point, my friend and I were the only ones left in the restaurant yet it took forever just to get our order taken and to get coffee refills.   My recommendation: Stop by here for a relaxed meal with a friend, but choose a day when you're not in a rush.",

The chicken is nothing to rave about, but the portions were huge. Don't forget to add the hot sauce!  The collard greens were BLEH. Had a funny after taste.  The mac and cheese was good -- perfectly cheesed.   The red bean rice was delicious and was a good buffer for the chicken.  Call me a fat ass, but yes I got all of these ... i wanted to try everything =) It was a perfect meal for a post drunken night out on the town. -- Might hurt the wallet a little especially if you were spending the night before.

WTH? just oil soaked chicken skin that slid off the meat once I cut into it. 3)The waffles tasted like frozen waffles. The food that I ate looked NOTHING like the photos that are posted here. :-/ I ordered banana pecan waffles and these mother fuckers first brought me the frozen waffle and then came out with a tiny plate of chopped bananas and pecans.

She said it was just okay and thought the service was bad.  Both times the service was lack luster. The waiter/waitress seemed unattentive or just out of it. So that really made us unsatisfied.

I was hoping to say eat your heart out rosco's but gussie's made it just disappointing. The catfish appetizer was the only thing good, and the service was hectic. I get it, soft opening, but seriously this restaurant isn't brand new, they just redid the old fried chicken place. Which I must admit had better fried chicken than this place. I feel like if you are going to have this be known for their fried chicken, please have it be AMAZING. and it wasn't it was dry, and the waffles were chewy. Yes a chewy waffle, not crunchy like it's suppose to be when you go to a chicken and waffles place.  I guess you can say that I am defintely a chicken snob because I love it so much, and if kfc has better fried chicken, no I mean safeway has better fried chicken for a quarter of the cost, then I think it is pretty shitty to charge almost 10 bucks for chicken and waffles",

Not only did I eat there twice (that's TWO times) this past weekend, but I can't stop talking about it to friends &amp; family. So I suppose I should just let it all out here.   First off, I am one of those silly vegans you hate, though my friends and boyfriend are both meat-fans. It is rare that we all find a place to enjoy, whole-heartedly. But I believe Gussie's may be the perfect spot.   The first visit I ordered the vegan buckwheat waffles with EarthBalance and syrup. I've been dreaming of waffles since the day I left the dairy world, and am so glad to be back in the club. These thick and fluffy squares were delicious, filling and priced right.   On my next visit I went with the Vegetarian Plate - which can be deceiving - I checked, and everything on the dish is not only veggie, but also vegan. Let me start with this item by saying I couldn't finish half of this. Literally, I was stuffed before I'd hit the halfway point. The meal consists of spicy potatoes, cornbread, black-eyed peas, beans &amp; rice, and collared greens. Its a bit more price-wise - $10ish - but can very easily be split by two.   To top it off, the whole staff is super friendly, there's booze for sale and the meat-eaters in my life say the chicken is moist &amp; tasty.   Oh Gussie's, I'm in love!",

The server was excellent. \u00a0After a bit of a wait (maybe 12 minutes) she walked over to my table to let me know that my order was next in line and I would be getting my food soon. \u00a0I wasn't in much of a hurry really, but I was definitely hungry having skipped lunch on an unusually busy work day. \u00a0  My food (<a href=\"http://static4.px.yelp.com/bphoto/DBIgilQ_nParz9tvLkzwbg/l\">static4.px.yelp.com/bpho\u2026</a>) arrived a few minutes later, and it smelled fabulous. \u00a0The waffles look like frozen Eggo waffles and its color immediately told me that these wouldn't be crispy as it had not even reached a golden brown color yet when it was pulled out of the waffle iron. \u00a0Unlike Eggo waffles though Gussie's recipe is very chewy. \u00a0To make things worse the knife I was given was very dull, and instead of easily cutting through the waffles my knife was simply gnawing through it and tearing it apart. \u00a0Although I didn't particularly like the chewy texture I thought the waffle tasted good.  I still hadn't noticed the wrong chicken piece when I picked up the chicken leg and took a bite. \u00a0The chicken leg was nice and moist and the flavor was good. \u00a0I liked that the batter was very thin and the chicken didn't seem to be oily. \u00a0I'd bet I would have liked the chicken thigh just as much, but I never got one. \u00a0  The waitress reacted by saying something similar to \"that certainly looks like a breast\". \u00a0I assured the waitress it was okay since I really didn't want to sit there and have to go through another long wait just for another piece of chicken. \u00a0The chicken breast (<a href=\"http://static1.px.yelp.com/bphoto/aZxusIiKIsht2JUZEjaOpQ/l\">static1.px.yelp.com/bpho\u2026</a>) was very disappointing. \u00a0Although it had the same tasty batter on the outside the chicken meat inside was extremely overcooked and very dry. \u00a0Taking gulps of liquid with each bite couldn't save this piece of chicken. \u00a0It was that bad. \u00a0I didn't even finish the chicken, and I hate wasting food!  Although I'd like to return and hope for a better experience I'll probably wait awhile before doing so. \u00a0I would have gladly given Gussie's three big stars but to screw up my order and give me a super dry piece of meat loses a star. \u00a0For a dinner costing over $17 I could have had a lot better.",

The waffle was quite delicious but you have to pay extra $1 for pure maple syrup.  Saw a sign of $2 Tuesday (2 fried chicken wings / Soju &amp; Sake shots / pint of beer.) Wonder if there's a limit of how many you can order.  The great thing about this place is it opens all day, perfect for a late afternoon brunch. They also have a good varied selection. Will have to come back to try other items.  This place is comfort and exciting at the same time with warm service.",

My friend and I both ordered 1/2 chicken with grits. In contrast to many of the reviews here, our food arrived in ~10 minutes. Things were looking up...until I see the plates the waiter is about to place in front of us.  I told the waiter, \"Those aren't ours. \u00a0We didn't order waffles. \u00a0Ours is chicken with grits.\". The waiter replied ,\"It all comes with waffles. \u00a0I thought you wanted a side of grits.\". He went back into the kitchen and brought back one tiny bowl of grits. I was unclear on the concept -- were we supposed to share this little bowl? \u00a0Eventually he brought another teeny bowl of grits after I asked him about it.   As soon as the confusion with the order happened, I asked to see the menu to clear up the confusion. I showed the waiter that what we ordered WAS chicken AND grits NOT waffles. His response was \"Ooooh. I thought you wanted this 1/2 order of chicken that comes with waffles. \" \u00a0Can you say more training of the wait staff needed? \u00a0Learn your menu!  I like the chicken, except for the piece that was bone dry and stringy. Blech. The grits were OK. The accidental waffles were blah -- waffles should be a little crispy.  The dining experience did not measure up to the cost of the food. I won't be back for a long time.",

I've been here twice, got the chicken and waffles each time, been with friends who got other things and were more than satisfied. I lived in LA for 4 years and loved Roscoe's while I was down there, but I will say that I think Gussie's trumps Roscoe's just by a little bit. The chicken here is slightly more tender/less dry in the middle... also their syrup is ammmmmaaaazing. it just has a slight butterscotch taste to it that makes the waffle so damn delicious   The service has been great - no complaints. Be courteous to them, they will be courteous to you. I came in the middle of the day on both occasions and it was not crowded. Got seated and served in a reasonable time frame. The first time I was there, Billie Jean came on and I kid you not.. every single table started singing and rockin to it.... good crowd.   anyway, just leaving this review to offset the negative reviews cuz this place is the bomb.",

The waffles were tasty (I paid an extra buck for pure maple syrup--definitely worth the up-charge). \u00a0However, I wasn't very impressed with the chicken. \u00a0 I ordered the 1/4 chicken with dark meat and two waffles. The skin was tough, and the meat was a bit dry. But, I figured it was good enough, so I didn't say anything. \u00a0However after finishing the leg, I discovered that the thigh was even tougher, and once I managed to cut into it, the meat was stringy. \u00a0Maybe it had been pre-cooked a day or two before and then re-heated in the fryer? \u00a0I'm not sure. \u00a0But, it wasn't very good. \u00a0I probably should have said something after the first bite, but by the time I was convinced that I wasn't just being too picky, it felt like it was too late to complain. \u00a0Not sure if I'd go back or not. \u00a0Maybe it's worth another try.",

I ordered Gussie's Signature Sweet Potato Waffles with two pieces of fried chicken for $12.79. I don't remember exactly what the bf got but it was huge for just a dollar more. I loved my sweet potato waffles and the chicken was pretty tasty too. We got the red velvet cheesecake for dessert. It was a huge slice but not very tasty. I know there are cheaper chicken and waffle places out there but unless I can find one with tastier sweet potato waffles, I'll be coming back here!  Update: I came here again a second time with a large group of people and I ordered my sweet potato waffles with chicken again. It was just as good if not better than the first time! My fried chicken wings were really crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It was reported from others in my group that their chicken was too dry though. =/ I was so hungry I finished everything this time. My tummy's happy &amp; I'd return when I'm craving sweet potato waffles!",

    "review_text": "Dang it. \u00a0I really wanted to like Gussie's Chicken &amp; Waffles, but sadly, my visit was not to be on a good day for Gussie's. \u00a0Upon entering, a sign directed us to seat ourselves, however, with many of the tables occupied, several of those that were free were dirty and not wanting to seat ourselves at a dirty table, we opted for a table in the center of the restaurant, a minor inconvenience.  Gussie's was clearly understaffed during our visit, as it took more than a reasonable amount of time to bring the menus and then take our order, but what was the rush, it was a lazy day with no plans other than a lunch of chicken and waffles.  We ordered the Uptown Special and Downtown Specials, both with one waffle and either white or dark chicken, but sadly, the namesake items were both just \"meh\". \u00a0The waffle was thin and had to be consumed quickly, as it sogged up as quickly as a bowl of corn flakes do when milk is added. \u00a0The thin waffle had a nice flavor, but I was expecting a thicker portion. \u00a0The Uptown, which included the white breast was dry and the batter was underwhelming, nothing to really distinguish it to belonging to Gussie's. \u00a0Priced at $9.29, it was an ok value, but nothing special.  Food and bits of paper littered the restaurant floor and our water glasses stood empty for most of our meal, only being refreshed at the point were we were almost done with our lunch. \u00a0In addition to the chicken and waffles, we ordered the gumbo, which had the consistency of chicken soup, than a true gumbo. \u00a0The shrimp chowder left a burning sensation in the back of ones throat, similar to canned cheese, which we suspected, but could not confirm to be one of the ingredients.  My dining companion and I decided that we would give Gussie's another try, but not order the namesake items, hoping that upon our return visit, we would have a better experience, however, after paying our bill, we checked out the all you can eat buffet and finding it looking rather, um, simple, uneventful, kind of blah looking, decided that this would be our last visit. \u00a0  Honestly, I was rather disappointed in our visit, I've driven by Gussie's so many times and really wanted it to be a great experience, but sadly, was left disappointed.",

You know what I'm saying. I know you do. So imagine my surprise when I don't see Sweet Potato Pie on the menu. Sorry Gussie's, but you lose one star right there.   I got The Taste of the South. The chicken was excellent. The greens were just right. The candied yams were good, and the mac 'n cheese was all right. The corn bread--a little dry (and could afford to be a bit sweeter). The lackluster cornbread: another half a star off.   This place is very new, and three (and a half!) stars are pretty good as far as I'm concerned. I am definitely going back to try the sweet potato waffles. Besides, in this little big city of ours, I'm a big fan of kitchens that stay open late...not to mention of having a cold beer with my soul food.   The atmosphere: a bit loud, but I didn't mind. In fact, I like hearing people having a good time while I'm eating. It's comforting.   Staff: Gussie's--hire more black folks for your wait staff please. All the wait staff around us were white. The people who were bussing the tables: brown folks. Something felt weird. I know, I know...my yardstick, Sylvia's in Harlem, is not a fair comparison, especially given the 6% (and dwindling) Black folks population in SF. \u00a0:: sigh :: Black flight is probably a topic better suited for Racialicious, not Yelp.

It must be said that Gussie's isn't even close to the chicken and waffles I have had for the last 10 years of living in the south, but it was still exciting to experience CA's version of what used to be a staple for me. Its also lovely having Gussie's right down the street from our new apartment.   Service - 4 (close to 5) stars. The second we opened the door...we were greeted and treated very well. Our server made sure we were very happy without overdoing it.   Food - 3 stars (swaying some towards 2, but overall 3)  What we ordered... *Buttermilk battered chicken strips, which came with waffle fries and honey mustard. This is basically one of my favorite meals...when I'm looking for something fried, easy and all around not very good for you. :) *Boyfriend went with the Gussie's Chicken &amp; Waffles, which is basically 2 pieces of fried chicken (drumstick and breast) and 2 waffles. I hate to say this, but the waffles weren't that impressive. They looked like they came out of a standard waffle iron and they were a bit underdone.   Overall...they advertise \"Chicken &amp; Waffles\" and they deliver just that. If that's what you're looking for...give them a try, BUT if you're used to the southern \u00a0version...keep your expectations low.",

My brother and i walk inside the restaurant, we thought it was a nice and clean restaurant. I order the fillmore classic which include waffle, 3 fried chicken wings, and eggs while my brother order downtown style which have 1 waffles and either a choice of thigh or drumstick.  While my brother and i were chit chat and using the phone while waiting for our food, we was wondering why we were whats taking so long which we waited for about 20 minutes or more. Usually it doesnt take that long to bring out the food. While we waiting for the waitress who got our orders, my brother suggested that if she forgot what our orders was, we should just leave since we didnt want to wait long and i was really hungry.  When the waitress came to our table, we ask why it was taking so long, thats when she told us that there was a party of 20 in the back and told us that our food should be out shortly.   As for the food, i thought the chicken wings was a bit dry on the drumstick part and somewhat moist on the wing part. The waffle was alright not too special. I had scramble eggs which was good.  I would have gave this restaurant another star if there wasnt a big party on the day i went since the workers here are nice and keep checking on us. But if i rate on the food only, i give it a 3 since it was average but i dont mind coming here again",

The chicken was underseasoned and KFC probably would have tasted better. Not exactly sure what I was expecting from the waffles but they tasted really sour. I couldn't even finish it.

    "review_text": "After going to the Disney Museum with my wife earlier in the day (btw I highly recommend the museum), we were craving for some southern food and in particular, fried chicken.   Our first option was Hard Knox Cafe a few miles down but it was closed, which sucked. But we had a backup and ended up at Gussies. The reviews were a little hit and miss but we were already in SF so why not give this place a whirl.  First off, the area is not sketchy like some people mentioned. Geez people, grow a pair. What constitutes a sketchy area? Minorities? Don't even get me started, lol.  Anyways, my wife and I went at an odd time (around 3:30 pm) on a weekday but that was great b/c it was empty, which is great if you're impatient like me.  I'm not a big fan of waffles so I didn't try them; neither did my wife. I ordered two chicken breasts, a side of red beans and rice and collard greens. The sides were pretty good. My wife ordered similar sides, along with some yams and smothered potatoes. No complaints either way.  But it's all about the chicken. Like others mentioned, the chicken is pretty dry. It has a nice crisp but the inside is not very juicy. The portions are huge though, so beware. One chicken breast is plenty for a big appetite. I was in beast mode so I ate two!  The service seemed a little on the slow side but not too bad. However, like I said, we were pretty much the only ones there, so I'm not sure how i'd feel going and waiting with a huge crowd. That being said, the waiter was pretty nice.  Overall, you get a good amount of food for the price. The quality of the chicken isn't as good compared to other places, hence 3 stars. I'd probably go back here late night with some friends after some drinking but not sure i'd go out of my way to come here again.",

To their credit, the waffles were cooked perfectly and the syrup was good and warm, but the chicken left a lot to be desired, mainly because of the dredge.  Whatever dredge they used on the chicken lacked any character, it had absolutely no spice, and was salty and tough, and not even flaky. Some reviewers said that the chicken was cooked perfectly, and yes, it was cooked well, not too dry, but that's to be expected for a chicken dinner. The same dredge apparently made it on to the fried okra, which was similarly tough and tasteless, although the chipotle sauce that went with it (definitely very southern style!) was good.

In fact, I love this cake so much that my husband purchased one for my at-home birthday party last night!! \u00a0It ain't cheap, but nothing good ever is, and it'll easily feed ALL of your friends and then some...this cake is HUGE!!!  My friends also agree this is the best Red Velvet they've ever had: \u00a0my friend requested it as her cake for the baby shower I threw her in November! \u00a0She'd had it first at my birthday last year, and couldn't get it out of her mind!!  There are many other things I love at Gussies, too: \u00a0The Fried Chicken is delicious and moist (I only get dark meat, btw, so I have no idea how the white meat is)...the Mac'n'Cheese is flavorful and rich and soooo much better than any of the other soul food and/or bbq joints I've been to in the Bay Area...  The Fried Chicken Livers are a great starter for those rare people like me who love liver! \u00a0  I really enjoy the Red Beans and Rice, too, although I will admit to having had better...but still, if you're craving that, it'll hit the spot! \u00a0Sweet Potatoes are delish, although again, not super-special...but they most certainly get the job done! \u00a0  The Corn Bread is moist, sweet, not too heavy, and served in generous hunks...if you're looking for fussy corn bread with jalapenos or corn kernels or anything else in it, this is not the stuff you're looking for...but if you want good old-fashioned corn bread? \u00a0This is the stuff!  I'm actually not generally a fan of waffles, so while I've tasted the waffles here, and think they are just fine, I'm not a great judge of them in general...but my partner seems to think they're swell, because he hungrily devours them every time we go here!  I really enjoy the cocktails they make here: \u00a0a little bit out of the box, tasty, and not too pricey!  This is a GREAT place to take kids, to bring large groups (I've brought 20 people without the management batting an eyelash!), or to come for a casual evening out. \u00a0  There are PLENTY of VEGETARIAN options here, including the rice and beans (which usually have a giant hamhock in them at other restaurants), and they even make VEGAN buckwheat waffles and cornbread!!! \u00a0  Be warned: \u00a0Sometimes they have live jazz here in the evenings, and when that happens, it's WAY TOO LOUD to talk to anyone at your table! \u00a0I personally avoid those nights...it's probably a good idea to call in advance if you don't want a loud assault on your ears over dinner!  And sometimes if they are having a slow night, they'll close early...another good reason to call in advance if you're thinking of heading over there on the later side!  All in all, this is my favorite Southern-style soul food restaurant in SF. \u00a0I've been to Farmer Brown's, which left me cold. \u00a0I've been to Blue Jay and didn't understand what the fuss was all about. \u00a0Memphis Minnie's sides just didn't do it for me. \u00a0Etc. \u00a0You get the point!  Lest you think I'm a Californian who doesn't know her hamhock from her chit'lin's, I used to live in North Carolina. \u00a0I've been to all of the Southern states in the U.S. \u00a0I've had some truly epic soul food in my life. \u00a0While Gussie's may not be The Best Evar, it's certainly pretty darn good!!

The whole episode started badly, hostess stand is unmanned. Waited 4 min and finally someone came round and told me she would be with me shortly, that happened twice before she disappeared for good. Now 7 min have gone by and a couple arrive and are waiting as well. Near the bar area is a phone so I decide to call the restaurant in hopes of drawing someone's attention. Phone rang and rang, I can hear it but seems that no one serving can. Now 2 more people arrive and then 3 more people arrive, so now there are 8 people waiting for a hostess and I have been waiting for 12 min. Finally I grab a bus boy and ask for help. Someone final comes out and seats me.  Waiter takes my order and now the wait and wait and wait. Finally my appetizer arrives and now more waiting and waiting and waiting. The waiter finally appears and tells me he's forgotten to place my order and asks what I ordered. He is very friendly and apologetic. 3 min later the food arrives with what I think looks like a piece fried chicken, it should really be called overly dry chicken and it should come with a steak knife so that you can cut into it. Bottom line the food is really bad and as someone else mentioned if you call yourself a chicken and waffle place you should have some good chicken and this place doesn't. The waiter was great and comped my meal for the wait, but unfortunately the food does not make up for it.   The wait staff are running around doing the best they can and despite their constant coming and going they are still very friendly.",

    "review_text": "I came here months ago with my boyfriend on a Friday night. It was pretty late, but we were able to find parking a block away. We were debating between Hard Knox, which was already closed at the time, and Gussie's. Since Gussie's was open until 12am, we decided to eat here. It wasn't very crowded on a Friday night; maybe a couple of people, but that's it. The restaurant is very clean, well lit, and tastefully decorated. The waitress was very warm, welcoming and was very patient when we asked questions about the items on the menu.  I'm not too sure what the plate was called, but I ordered a piece of chicken with corn while my boyfriend got the chicken and waffle combo. We decided we both wanted to try the macaroni and cheese as well so we ordered a side of that. The waitress was reaaally trying to sell their chocolate kahula coffee cake to us and since we already ate before visiting Gussie's, we passed. While waiting, I noticed that Gussie's has a dance floor set up in the back. Pretty cool! The wait for the food wasn't too long at around 15 minutes for both of our meals. Our macaroni and cheese, however, came later because the waitress forgot to put our order in. No big deal, though!  My corn wasn't a corn on the cob like I expected it, but instead, it was loose kernels cooked with seasoning. I didn't really like all the flavorful seasoning on the corn, so I passed on that. The chicken was good, but not the best. It didn't give me that wow factor that I was looking for. My boyfriend, however, enjoyed his meal and said that Gussie's was better than Hard Knox. The macaroni and cheese was very good! Nice and ooey gooey cheesy.. my favorite! The waitress gave us the chocolate kahula coffee cake on the house! How sweet. :) I'm sad that we were going to pass up on it because it was SO good. Probably my favorite dish of the night! Definitely get that chocolate kahlua coffee cake!  Overall, the bill was decent. I saw the prices for the other on items on the menu and thought it was pretty expensive, though. I'll probably be back for brunch or something!",

The location is easy to find, just off Fillmore Street and they've done a nice job with the decor, \u00a0It is simple, clean, and somewhat visually appealing. \u00a0Service is \"down home\" and comfortable, but not polished.  I had the signature dish, chicken and waffles. The fried chicken was really quite good. \u00a0The outer was nicely fried, flavorful, but not overly spicy. \u00a0Best of all, Gussie's avoided the dreaded dry bird, serving up a fairly moist half-breast. \u00a0The accompanying waffle was satisfying, if not spectacular. \u00a0Served with either maple or brown sugar syrup (I had a little of each), it is a thin waffle, not Belgian. After shunting about 90% of the butter off to the side, I tasted both syrups then loaded up on the maple. Since I'm farm boy from rural PA, maple syrup is sort of like chocolate to me -- it makes most everything taste good. \u00a0The maple syrup container didn't pour very well and leaked like a sieve, leaving a nice puddle of syrup on the table -- an example of what I mean by lack of polish in the service, this kind of thing is easily rectified. \u00a0 The portions were adequate for me, which would make them more than enough for most.  Gussie's chicken and waffles were better than many I've had before, but not as good as some. \u00a0Although, anything I've liked better has been a bit more expensive. \u00a0So, I'm giving Gussie's my \"Price/Performance Best Pick\" on chicken and waffles.",

She refilled our water glasses without us asking; and kept on following up if we needed anything else.  -1 star: The food isn't good. The chicken and waffles were rubbery. The mac and cheese was not cheesy with the cheese only use as a topping. It was also hard to fork from it's little bowl;i felt like I didn't get my money's worth. The syrup isn't legit.  I expect the chicken to be crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Their chicken...even if i got a piece of thigh, was DRY. it was also very exhausting to chew on. If there's such thing as fake chicken...this was it. The waffles weren't soft and flaky and the batter was tasteless. I usually do a test run, sampling it without the butter and the syrup first. It failed my tastebuds.  I will not come back nor recommend this place.   I am still on the hunt for a decent Chicken and Waffles place comparable to Lo lo's in Arizona.",

They weren't ready for us when we arrived \u00a0so we had to wait about 15 minutes The buffet food looked as if it had been there for a while and picked through. Crusty, burned/scorched and soggy. \u00a0I definately wasn't going to eat that. . The menus were worn and wrinkled and the waitress quickly asked for them back after we ordered because they were short on menus. I ordered the \"taste of the south\" which took well over an hour to arrive. The mac n cheese was ok, the greens had the stems still on them and the sweet potatoes were canned. Also my food could have been hotter. One person in our group never got their \u00a0catfish meal so she canceled. All in all the food was just so so. It's very hard to make good soul food, even harder when mexicans are cooking it. Blacks don't make burritos, whites don't make chinese food and asians don't make pizza. Just saying. This dining experience would have been better had it \u00a0not been for the atrocious service and lack of lighting. If you have a flashlight on your smart phone you may need it. The waitress sucked, plain and simple! The \u00a0gratuity was already included in the total bill, which was over $200 so the waitress had no reason to provide good service, she was guaranteed a tip. Anyway, I won't be going there again and will discourage anyone I know from going there. Good service means alot and Gussies definately lacks it. \u00a0I don't see them in business in the next two years as word will get around about them and people won't go.",

The delivery guy arrived on time, but half of our order was missing. Delivery guy was apologetic and asked us to call restaurant to fix. I spoke with the manager on the phone and she apologized for leaving pieces of our order out but also told us we ordered incorrectly (there is a section on grubhub where you can write in additional requests and we asked for mac and cheese instead of fries) even though the website says you can do this \"for an additional charge\". Manager stated the rest of our food \u00a0(waffles, chicken fingers, corn bread) would come in 20 minutes and she would give us the mac and cheese as \"long as you know you you can't do that for future reference\". The forgotten food arrived 35 minutes later and looked pathetic. It wasn't clear whether the buttermilk chicken strips were chicken or fish and they were pink in the center and rubbery throughout. The \"sweet potato\" waffles were pale, limp and had no sweet potato flavor. The $0.99 corn bread was a 2x2 dry corner piece. I called the restaurant again to confirm whether we had received regular or sweet potato waffles and chicken vs fish because we couldn't tell. Manager stated the sweet potato waffles were \"sometimes not orange\" and that \"we don't even serve fish strips\"- though you can clearly see pictures of strip shaped \"catfish nuggets\" in other yelp reviews. I informed the manager that we typically loved Gussie's but that today's food and services were not up to their usual standards. The manager admitted leaving out half of our order was incorrect but that \"you think you can do whatever you want, but you ordered things that weren't even on the menu\" and she refused to acknowledge my concerns about the poorly cooked chicken/fish and made no further attempts to improve our customer satisfaction.",

Some days the greens are smokey and delectable other days it's blah, but to be fair I never hate it because there are dishes that are consistently good like the catfish, the red beans and rice, and the RED VELVET CAKE (which is some of the best I've ever had). The chicken is not make- you- wanna- slap- yo- mama good but it's tastey. And chicken and waffles is just f***in good!  Rules for Gussie's  1. Go to the Brunch buffet on Wednesdays for $12 2.

I recommend any piece of fried chicken and the Banana Pecan waffles. That is my favorite combo. My mom is a fan of the regular waffles and my friends seem to be partial to the sweet potato.   The only thing better then the food is the service, the staff is super friendly and although the kitchen can cause a bit of a wait it is well worth it.",
