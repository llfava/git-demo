I love the Patti Melt here, but I've enjoyed all the dishes I've tried at Max's over the years.  And Max's has my favorite desert, a chocolate macaroon crumble, which is basically vanilla ice cream, covered with a coconut macaroon that's been covered in dark chocolate sauce, and tons of it. I've tried the other deserts, and they've all been good, but this one remains my favorite.  Portions are so large here that I can't imagine eating both dinner and desert in one sitting, so I usually go for either one or the other, otherwise it's a waste of food.  I've eaten at the Max's Opera Cafe in SF, Max's Cafe in Redwood City, Max's Cafe in Palo Alto and Max's Restaurant and Bar in Burlingame, and they've all been pretty much the same.",

The food is decent but nothing memorable. \u00a0I accept this, however, \u00a0as Max's mainly is a deli that serves dinner. \u00a0If one wants a better culinary experience there are plenty of good restaurants in the area.  My big issue is the service. \u00a0For example, last night we arrived at 6:00 and were seated about five minutes later. \u00a0We did not see our waiter until about 6:25. \u00a0We told him that we had 7:30 opera tickets, to which he replied \"I can't guarantee anything\" regarding when we would get our food. \u00a0We ordered our drinks and food at the same time. \u00a0Fifteen minutes later our food came out, but our drinks were nowhere to be seen. \u00a0After prompting the bus person to find our waiter, he delivered our drinks a few minutes later. \u00a0Our waiter didn't display any sign of urgency despite the busy night. \u00a0It appeared that he just didn't care.  My one star for Max's is not for our single experience last night. \u00a0Max's has earned this star based upon poor and indifferent service on most of my visits.  I'd rather eat at the McDonald's across the street than return to Max's. \u00a0 I'll at least be treated better by the kids behind the counter.",

We went on Tuesday night and the food was ok, but the rolls which are usually great were hockey pucks. I asked for some that were fresher and the waiter brought more that were hockey pucks. We went back Wednesday night after a long day at the America's Cup on San Francisco Bay, looking for warm comfort food before driving home. We wanted a bowl of soup. The waitress told us that we couldn't have a bowl we could only have a cup. My sweetheart said he wanted more since that was what he was going to have for dinner. The waitress just kept telling him he couldn't have what he wanted. This was never about money although they charge $8 for a cup of soup. He got frustrated and ordered something else he didn't want. I decided to try again and asked to speak to the manager and give him an opportunity to make happy customers, His answer was the same, he couldn't give us a bowl of soup. When I asked him he told me that there was not one vessel in the entire restaurant that he could use as a bowl to sell a customer a bowl of soup. This is from a place that prints Max's Rules on every napkin and they are all about the customer having a good experience. Perhaps they should read their own rules! We left without eating and won't be back. Max's has gone from a go to to a don't go there place.",

The bread was great, a nice selection of sourdough rolls, walnut-cranberry rolls and whole wheat slices. \u00a0And our waiter very graciously kept refilling the basket. \u00a0Entrees were fine -- but what was really memorable were the desserts -- so yummy, and such giant portions -- we ordered the Opera Cake, the hot fudge sundae, and the apple crisp. \u00a0Wow! \u00a0So fabulous! \u00a0We ended up taking half of every portion home! \u00a0   Parking in this area can be a real pain in the ass, but there is a garage underneath if you can't find street parking.",

The yelp app showed the family-friendly places in the theater district were few and far between. Max's was really the only obvious choice, being a mere block away. We made a beeline.  On entering, we discovered we were not alone. The foyer was filled to the brim with waiting families, some on their way to The Nutcracker performance nearby. I sheepishly asked the wait time at the host desk and they said \"15 minutes.\" \u00a0Though I was extremely doubtful, I gave them my name, got a pager and sat with the family. \u00a0To their word, 15 minutes later we had a nice window table with menus in hand. I was amazed.  My hungry family ordered quickly. \u00a0I also opted for coffee and bloody mary (Hey, they were half price!). The coffee was good, and the bloody mary was spot-on; They even rimmed the glass with celery salt. Yum.  My huevos rancheros plate was much much better than I expected. It included perfectly-cooked eggs, good beans, guacamole, and home fries. Plus, triple-sized, delicious, homemade tortilla chips were tucked in around the sides. And it wasn't overburdened with cheese, like most places.  I then polled the family on their opinion:  \u00a0The oldest daughter: \"I love this place!\"  \u00a0The wife: \"mreeymgudmm\" (in the middle of enjoying her salad)  \u00a0The youngest daughter: \"Can we come back here?\"  In the end the news was both good and bad.  The good - we have a decent, family place to eat for the next theater trip.  The bad - my kids will now expect to always come here whenever we're in the neighborhood.",

It was take-out, for lunch, and only a half a wrap, so there for a half star is only appropriate. \u00a0If it had been a whole wrap, perhaps a whole star... Anyway, it doesn't matter. \u00a0After several attempts over the last four years of working at City Hall and having desperate deli cravings absolutely dashed to pieces upon one crappy Max experience after another, I have sworn off for good.   Recap of my last experience:   (Scene) It is raining absolutely sideways, we run from City Hall to the safety of Opera Plaza. \u00a0Throw open the doors to Max's and slosh through the nearly empty restaurant to the hostess stand.  Hostess: Yeah?  Us: Um, yeah. \u00a0We would like to get lunch.  Hostess: Well...you can sit at the bar.  We walk in the direction of her thumb, which she has just casually thrown over her shoulder, and sit down at the bar.   Mind you, Max's has just renovated from one horrific interior to something equally horrific, which is good because we have something to talk about as we wait for interminably long periods of time between any waitstaff attention throughout our meal. Honestly, it looks like a monster with a penchant for green and pink Smooth &amp; Melty's lost his lunch inside a slick chinese restaurant. \u00a0I do like the chandeliers, though. On to the rest of our lunch....  The waiter brings us menus, does not ask if we would like drinks, and leaves. \u00a0Another waiter comes, gives us water, leaves. \u00a0A third waitress comes. We order.   10 minutes later, we get our appetizer \"Baked Giant Mushrooms with Pecorino Cheese and Pesto\". \u00a0Now, wouldn't you think that they would be warm? Yes? Well, you would be wrong. Wouldn't you think the mushrooms would at least be large, if not giant? Wrong again. \u00a0We got 4 cold, not-so-big mushrooms in a tepid (at best) marinara sauce. \u00a0Generally, my lunch partner and I are not complainers--we are too afraid of spit. \u00a0In this case, however, we had to say something. \u00a0At two dollars a pop, we were not going to eat lukewarm mushrooms. \u00a0So we did. \u00a0The waitress STUCK HER THUMB in one of the mushrooms and said, \"yep, you're right\" and whisked them away. \u00a0She returned 10 MINUTES later with our plate maybe two degrees warmer than the last time, and made a huge deal about the fact that she gave us an extra, \"free\" mushroom, on her....Well thanks a ton, lady.   Our lunch continues in this downhill trajectory...my buddy's Rueben comes with no 1000 dressing, and he has to ask for ketchup for his french-fries too (I know, bizarre request, but still...) The cheese on his sandwich is, yes, melted, which would imply that it was once warm, but in fact it too is chilly to the touch. \u00a0So okay, maybe warm food is not their thing? On to my salad...which I never found under the huge glob of sour cream that they put on top of it.   Oh, and the desserts, which used to be the restaurants only saving grace, have been downsized. This is not my imagination, we asked and it was confirmed. And don't even get me started about the time I got a half a salad for the bargain price of $17 dollars....",

It is something we look forward to, as I am sure the restaurant is well aware of the Nutcracker customers that follow this same tradition.  We recently dined at Max's on 12/14/11. We arrived at 5:00p, and were the first table in an empty section. While waiting for over 20 minutes for a server to take a drink order, we noticed the section getting fuller and fuller. When our server, Blanca, finally decided to come to our table, we could tell that she was in a foul mood.   We finally got served our dinner after a full hour of waiting. The restaurant was in full swing by then with a line forming on the waiting list. One would think, if you are the manager of a restaurant with guaranteed customers going to the Nutcracker, that you would schedule your best and most efficient servers to make the most money, right?  Blanca forgot most of our order. She left ALL of the dirty plates and cups on the table for the ENTIRE meal. I had to hunt her down to order a glass of wine with my dinner, and again to order dessert for my kids. Whenever you tried to get her attention, she blatantly ignored us - as well as most of the table in her section.  While I usually am not one to post comments on Yelp, this disaster of a dining experience was just too much to ignore. The final straw was when she gave us our bill with a built in 18% gratuity. Seriously? So you flat out ignore your customers, forget most of their order, never clear the table or ask if we need anything, and then slap our faces with 18% for doing NOTHING? A complete insult in my opinion!  Sadly, I think our dining tradition prior to attending the ballet will be finding a new location. It's too bad that the management has become so uninterested in customer experience. In these tough economic times, customer service is EVERYTHING and should NEVER be taken for granted.",

My standard for Jewish deli food is the fabulous, amazing \"Famous 4th Street Deli\" in Philly, where the sandwiches are big enough to feed a family of 6 and the matzo-ball soup, which is the best I've ever had, could feed Somalia. So at Max's, I was expecting huge portions of yummy food.   The large soup was just enough for the 2 of us, but it wasn't spectacular. I was happy that it wasn't too salty, a problem that many soups have, and that the chicken was white meat. It was OK, but it didn't leave me anticipating my next visit. Same with the roast beef sandwich. It was a decent sandwich; nothing to complain about. But nothing to really remember, either. The latkes, however, were just as tasty as I remembered them.   So, next time I have a sick child at home, I'll try one of the Russian places on Geary that always seem to have a good supply of fresh matzo-ball soup.",

This evening I was feeling a little under the weather. \u00a0Often when I do, I crave good ole Jewish chicken soup. \u00a0So, I dragged my goyish boyfriend here tonight so I could get my matzoh ball on. \u00a0Granted my standards are high but the bumbahs here were pretty bad. \u00a0They were kinda sweet as if they had added sugar. \u00a0Even the bf knew they were bad and he's from Iowa. \u00a0The broth &amp; noodles were decent though.  All, however, was not lost. \u00a0I did get to indulge in a really good corned beef &amp; pastrami sandwich. \u00a0The meat was moist and flavorful and not too fatty. \u00a0He got the pork chop which while a bit overdone came in really good, tangy sauce.  They had a piano player playing this evening which was a nice touch. \u00a0And, when she went on break the played Ella &amp; Billie tunes which was cool.

I ordered a cobb salad, my companion ordered a lamb burger medium well. 30 minutes later we flagged the server down to check where our food was - only then did she update us. A few minutes later it arrived. The burger was brown on the outside and raw - I mean bacteria cold - on the inside. My salad - the greens were brown and wilted, as if they'd been dressed for at least an hour. Piled on top were dry chicken breast with no dressing to moisten it and a pile of brown and somewhat slimy mushrooms. Have you ever gotten up from a table in a restaurant to walk your own plate back to the kitchen because the wait staff can't be flagged? Incredible!

The coupon's only parameters were that we spend over $20, the meal be after 5:00pm and only one discount per table. The coupon specifically listed two Max's locations which would honor the discount (one of which was this Van Ness location), and there was no expiration date.  You guessed it. We ate dinner (not cheap at nearly $90.00 \u00a0with one kid's meal and one shared dessert ) and they said they were not going to honor the coupon. I pointed out that it had their specific location listed and that there was no expiration date. The waitress simply said, \"We're not part of that group anymore\". I said, \"are you sure this is how you want to treat your customers?\" She said \"You can use it somewhere else\". This after not being able to find her for a single coffee refill.   So Max, with all of your empty proclamations of \"The customer is always right\" etc on everything from napkins to banner boards hung on the wall, you would think that customer service would include honoring your own unexpired coupon, with your own address specified, and a photo of your own location's interior printed on its face. Sorry Max, you screwed up. You cost your waitress a tip, you cost yourselves goodwill, and irritated customers in the process.  I guess the economy hasn't hit your restaurant to the point that you care about chasing away customers.  These fast slipping Yelp reviews actually make a difference to many of us....be careful or your customers will all go away.",

It's funny how ambiance can truly make a difference for even a chain restaurant. In my opinion, the Max's near Union Square is dreadful from a service standpoint, as the attitudes have been fossilized from years of dealing with truculent tourists and squawking shoppers. Perhaps representing the gateway to the Tenderloin has hardened the staff into becoming gatekeepers of the socially acceptable.  Even though they have exactly the same menu at the same prices, I have to give one more star to Max's Opera Cafe because the staff is more genuine, some of whom actually sing at the piano whether we want them to or not. The opera connection seems outdated, but it still somehow works, probably because the interior still has that darkened 1970's, Peppermill-meets-Lyons kind of vibe. They just need their waitresses to wear Peppermill's backless, orange evening dresses when they \u00a0serve cocktails.  Last night, I shared a heaping slice of apple pie a la mode, which was a relative bargain compared to the $3 cup of coffee (that's where they grab ya).

Hefty portions and good while they last but a tendency to leave my memory bank soon after departure both from the restaurant and out of my...

I work nearby the Opera Cafe, so it's the one I go to. Gumbo, gumbo gumbo!! It's really good.   Even though it's pricey, the portions are huge. Salads are huge, sandwiches are moderately large, and the soup is huge. 5 bucks for soup, well worth it. You can easily down 40 dollars in one sitting, but you'll have leftovers.

    "review_text": "Disappointment. For me, one word is enough but for you I'll explain the situation.   First of all the ambiance is lacking, a diner at best.   Second of all, I came into Max's under the impression (as stated on their website) that \u00a0\"opera\" was going to be a part of my night, I was wrong. Opera singing only begins at 6pm and is only located at the piano. According to my very drab waitress, \"some waiters sing, sorta\". It was 5pm and I was attending the ballet at 6pm so no singing for me.   Next the food was below par. When a 5 year old is disappointed with their hamburger you know there is a problem. Besides the fact that they got 2 of the orders wrong, which I noticed was also the case at the table next to us.   Finally I ordered what I believe was called Flank Steak Mojito, described as being an infusion of mint and lime juice with broccolini and potato's. When I got my order the potato's were missing, the only thing about the steak that resembled \"mojito\" was the slice of lime and leaf of mint sitting on my plate, the broccolini was unseasoned as were the potato's when they came, not so much as a bit of butter was on them.   Like I said before....disappointment.",

By no service I mean I had to track down our waiter to ask for the bill and the location of the bathroom. Basically the experience was like this:  Seated begrudgingly by a woman with pigtails. Waiter comes to get drink order, we weren't ready to order drinks, so we ordered food. I then told him we'd have a drink order in a couple minutes. The waiter takes all the menus (including the drink menu sitting open in front of me.) and leaves to put in the order. I waved down the woman with pigtails to get a new drink menu. Time goes by. I wave to the waiter a couple times, he nods, but never comes. He shows up to drop off mustard, and whisks away to talk to a 4 top seated right next to us. A minute later he comes back with our food. No water refills, no checking on us to see if our food is right, no adherence to the Max's rules found on the back of the menu. That was it, it was disappointing.  After we ate and sat and talked for a while \u00a0we decided that it was time to get some drinks, somewhere where we would get SERVICE.   I tracked down the waiter, and walked up to him while he was at a order terminal. Asked for the bill, and that was the end of our Max's experience.  Truly disappointing, lackluster, and apathetic service. The food was great, but I doubt I'll be back. Good food offset by bad service is not a great experience. In case you are wondering, it was about 5pm on Tuesday, the place was maybe half full. However, we did get wonderful service when we relocated to Home for drinks.

This used to be my default place around City Hall. \u00a0No more!  Our waiter clearly didn't understand her job and kept asking for clarification. \u00a0Perhaps if she had taken 5 minutes to familiarize herself with the menu she'd know what's on there.  I ordered a hot pastrami sandwich. \u00a0What I got was cold brisket sandwich. \u00a0I asked for it to be heated and for all the drama displayed it would you make you think I was asking to see the cow before it was slaughtered. \u00a0What came back was a cold sandwich. \u00a0Again.  The pickle came out of a jar (I saw the Vlasic jar in the service area). \u00a0We had to ask (when we could find a server) for mustard.. \u00a0No one came and checked on us, even though we wanted to order more.  In general this is a poor excuse for a restaurant and especially one that serves a particular kind of food. \u00a0It seems like maybe they've sold to someone else but the original owners (if they can tear themselves away from counting their money) should check and see what a pitiful excuse for a restaurant \u00a0Max's has become.  Save yourself money and taste buds - go to the McDonald's across the street. \u00a0You'll save time and money and really the food couldn't be any worse.",

    "review_text": "My review is based on Max's service.   I went to Max's for the first time with a co-worker for a post-noon lunch during the week. About half of all the tables were taken but the restaurant did not give off a busy vibe. From what I could see, most of Max's patrons go here for a leisurely lunch. Since both my co-worker and I have an one hour lunch break, we did not feel pressed for time. With that said, we would've never gotten our waiter's attention without deliberately waving our hand in the air.   Once we got his attention, he sauntered over as if we were taking his precious time. When he found out that we wanted to order he gave us that \"oh, is that what you wanted? I'm too busy for you right now\" look and said \"I'll be back.\" Then walked away without another word. I've received better attention at CPK's.   When he finally did return to take our order, his service was just as curt and inattentive. After he took our order, we never saw him again. Not to bring us our food. Not to refresh our drinks. Not to give us the bill. Not to tell us that he would be leaving.   In regards to the food, my co-worker and I shared a Lamb Burger on an Onion Roll served with french ries and crispy onions and a California Chicken Melt. I would say that the food was 3 1/2-star worthy. And the portions mirrored the price. But the waiter's service far overshadowed the food.   I would not come back here.",

My favorite thing to order is a cup of the chicken matzo ball soup and a caesar salad. I love their iced tea as well - they bring it to you as hot tea in an individual tea pot and then you pour it over ice.   The wait staff is always super friendly and helpful - I don't think I've ever had my order messed up, and they notice right away if your drink needs refilling.  Their dessert menu is also fantastic. I looove their strawberry shortcake and their Niagara Falls cake. I also like how you can order these in half slices too - their full slices are incredibly generous and I usually can't finish them! When I come here with my family, we'll typically order a full slice of cake to share and then enjoy it over coffee (did I mention their coffee is also great here?)  Pros:  -Great food at reasonable prices -Amazing desserts -Friendly and attentive wait staff  Cons:  -Can get busy, especially when a show has just let out. If you go during one of these times, it might be a little loud and you might have to wait for a table - but it's worth it!",

The salads could use more greens, especially for the price.  The brisket melt sandwich was terribly soggy and drippy, and fell apart immediately. The beef was mushy and lacked flavor. The bread was barely grilled. The Ceaser side salad was miniscule and had far too much dressing.  The chicken Cobb salad had decently fresh ingredients (the tomatoes were very flavorful), but needed more greens.  The 'fresh crusty bread' was previously-frozen oven warmed rolls that were chewy and overly sweet.  The prices are not cheap, even by San Francisco standards: Appetizers run $9-$14, sandwiches are $13-20 ($13 for a grilled cheese!) salads run $13-$18, and you'll pay $17 for a chicken pot pie.  One bright spot: The service was pleasant and low key.  You can find better deli for less money, or if you want to spend $50 for lunch there are SO many places you can dine - not just eat.",

The food was plentiful, but not to the standards of a good New York deli. Under the new owners, the food has become truly awful. I had a dried out \"turkey sandwich\" that may have been cold cut turkey. Equally bad was a cucumber salad that was miniscule and tasted as if it had been in the refrigerator for a year. The new owners are genuine food idiots, and it's hard to screw up a turkey sandwich. There are three positives to this restaurant, e.g. #1 the piano player who has been there for years. #2 Opera Plaza Cinema nearby. #3 Books Inc for a quick browse. Don't eat at this place. if you do, be sure to ask for the manager and complain before you leave the premises. Maybe we all can get him fired and a good New York deli put into the premises. In the meantime, eat at Tommy's Joynt, also on Van Ness Avenue. It's cheaper and dirtier, but at least it's an authentic San Francisco sandwich/hofbrau.

Cold, thick creamed spinach.   Ok, so why 3 stars? The Reuben!! The sauce really does run down your hands! That won me over...a bit fatty though.  There's 5.4% \"benefits\" charge added to your bill in addition to sales tax (almost 10% these days) and then a 15-20% tip ? Well...you do the math.   I did have another Reuben at Mel's Diner for $5 less (not including Max's added charges!!) and dare I say it--it was comparable.

This particular location has gone through a recent remodel. It's a bit more \"diner\" feel now with blacks and whites being a central color theme. Menu hasn't changed much though prices have gone up slightly.  The food is pretty consistent and usually fairly large in portion though you'll find newer items on the menu will usually start off with larger portions and then are pared down the longer they stay on the menu. \u00a0I'm particularly partial to the meat loaf, enchilada pie (which is usually a special), chicken pot pie (which has gotten smaller over time), and the turkey burger max. \u00a0For salads, give a try to Guy's Chinese Chicken salad though go for a half unless you are really hungry.  In the evenings the waitpeople also double as entertainment and will go up and sing with the pianst. \u00a0They started charging an extra surcharge for the evenings so expect a somewhat pricier dinner than you might be used to from a Max's.  For lunch, which is primarily when I go there (since I work in the area), I definitely recommend getting there at least 10 minutes before noon to beat the lunch crowd, especially during the holidays when afternoon performances of \"The Nutcracker\" are going on nearby and the restaurant is filled with families eating lunch prior to the show.  Overall, it's one of the better places around the Civic Center area and worth a visit or two. \u00a0Remember to save room for dessert!",

As we approached the bar, the bartender asked THEM (in a rather unpleasant and demanding fashion) \"Is she (meaning me) over 21?\"  ...... I'm sorry, what that implies is 1. I'm obviously underage and if thats so, 2. I can't speak for myself and should let the \"adults\" handle the conversation.  Well... 1. I'm 23.   and 2. I don't ever recall being treated like that as a child. I'm pretty sure at 6 the people at Starbucks were kind enough to ask me personally if I wanted whip cream in my hot chocolate.   So I spoke up and said, \"Yes. I am, would you like to see my ID?\" (Which I already had ready to present to him because I AM AWARE I LOOK 18)  He was caught off guard that words were coming from my mouth (because he hadn't addressed his question to me) and said, still in a demanding tone, Yes. Then we calmly discussed how I look 18, but am actually 23. My pseudo moms told me to be happy I'll look 21 at 35, which I will be. But I'm hopeful people have the decency to actually address me and not the other people I am with. \u00a0Oh wait, 99.9% of the time, they already do.  I worked in a bar before, I understand under 21's can't sit at the bar, but to pull some sort of stunt like that before we even sat down left a very bad taste in my mouth. There are ways to approach situations that are more pleasing to the customer and ensures you don't anger them to the point of no return.  The wine I had wasn't that great. It's overpriced here and at the airport. After this stunning display I will certainly never be back.",

Prime Rib and Creamed Spinach - 5/5 Stars!  The prime rib was extremely tender, just the way I like it. It was accompanied excellently with the creamed spinach which had a nice tang of cream. \u00a0  Dungeness Crab Cakes - 5/5 Stars!  Exquisite! Hands down my favorite food on the menu. The inside of the crab cakes are superb. The combination of the juicy crab with the crunchy crab shell is just sensational. The crab cakes are hard to beat..  Caesar Salad - 4/5 Stars  4/5 stars is not bad for one of my favorite salads. I am a caesar salad lover and its hard to impress me. The dressing and croutons were decent although the dressing could be a tad bit richer with a bit more dijon mustard or worcestershire sauce. That combined with maybe a bit fresher romaine lettuce leaves and it would certainly bring it up to 5 stars.   Chicken Caesar Wrap - 3/5 Stars  Not bad. It's a convenient food that you can take on the run and its pretty tasty. The only thing is that it's a little heavy on the sauce. If they just put a little less sauce on it, it would be perfect!  Chicken Liver - 3/5 Stars  Tasted just the way I thought. Some people love it and can eat it by the spoon. Me personally, I am not a huge fan but its typical of chicken liver anywhere else. It's just not my cup of tea.  Omelette - 4/5 Stars  I came here for breakfast once and I got the omelette with mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, and a side of chicken sausage. It was decent and I would definitely recommend coming here for breakfast. It's also perfect for hangovers :)  Matzah Ball Soup - 3/5 Stars  I know people that go crazy over this and love it to death. Nothing too special about it except its great on a cold day.   Lamb Burger - 5/5 Stars!  Lamb... so yummy. Enough said..  Ahi Tuna - 4/5 Stars  Ahi Tuna, I almost forgot! It was crusted and seasoned with sesame which had a nice tangy spike to it. I personally thought the ahi tuna was very tender which is great.  Grandma's Honey Chicken - 5/5 Stars!  One of my top 3 favorites. This meal was perfect. The glazed honey sauce contrasting with the tender seasoned chicken was divine.. I would highly recommend this!  Overall, I've had great experiences with Max's. Dungenes crab cakes takes the cake for being top-notch. The crispness of the crab cake is potent and unmatched. The servers are extremely friendly and the vibe is nice. Can't wait to come again!",

The waiters take turns singing to everyone with live piano accompaniment, which my friend and i greatly enjoyed.  The menu is quite extensive so everyone will find something they enjoy. I liked the witty list of \"Max's laws\" printed on the menu and throughout the restaurant.  One law mentioned how Max's prepares freshly brewed iced tea table side. Since I'm a huge iced tea fan, I had to try this and was delighted when our waiter brought me two large glasses filled with ice and a small tea pot. The result - it was one of the best iced teas I've ever had and I got to make it myself, which was a fun activity while we were waiting for food to arrive.  I ordered the salmon with veggies - prepared well and not overcooked. My friend got the HUGE chicken pot pie. While he liked it, he felt it was too meat heavy for his taste and didn't have enough gravy. I tried some and thought it was delicious, although I agree with there not being enough gravy.  For dessert I got the Fantasy Torte after drooling over it in the display case. It's a layered mix of cheesecake, chocolate mousse, and chocolate cake - all surrounded by a layer of thick chocolate fudge. Simply amazing. If for nothing else, Max's is a great place to come for dessert.  While the food was pretty good and the dessert oh-so-yummy, the poor service really left us with a so-so experience. Our waiter rarely attended to us besides taking our order and handling our check. We had to ask other waiters passing by for drink refills multiple times. One waiter apologized for our inattentive waiter, and I could tell looking around the room that the other waiters were doing a better job keeping their tables happy. I'm sure we had an unusual experience, but for now that's why Max's gets only 3 stars instead of 4.",

I asked the waitress about an item on the menu \"bricked chicken and garlic confit\" and she was clueless, saying it was a baked half chicken with some garlic. She didn't know what confit meant for this dish and didn't offer to find out.  So I ordered the chicken piccata. It was AWFUL. It was FRIED, like coated with something and FRIED. It did not mention \"fried\" on the menu. I would never have ordered it if it did. And: It was overcooked, dry and chewy. The sauce, which is supposed to be lemony, was pretty tasteless except for the capers. I couldn't eat it.  The wild rice pilaf might have been tasty if it weren't so super salty. I could barely eat it.  The saut\u00e9ed spinach (I love spinach) was so bitter that I literally couldn't eat it.   My friend ordered the same thing. We both left most of the food on our plates and basically ate bread for dinner. The Acacia Pinot Noir was good. Ha.  This dinner was a complete bomb. And it cost me $50. Maybe I need to stick with pastrami sandwiches and chopped liver? I don't know. But I won't be going back any time soon!",

They do have this side salad with fresh shucked white corn and dill potatoes over field greens. Pretty good for a diner with a chandelier and grand piano.   The servers are hit or miss so I ALWAYS sit at the bar which I've already mentioned. It's best to go to places like Max's and hang out with hokey older people.

Max's Opera Cafe is a tradition; if the service ain't great, it's because, chances are, your waitstaff is trying to break into show biz. Hence the random outbreaks of singing and why it's next to the OPERA HOUSE.  There's a Max's in Corte Madera and one in Stanford - I think the chain was bought out awhile ago - but the recipes have stayed the same. Again, the matzo ball soup is EPIC, as is the turkey burger, the pear salad, the nachos...crap, now I'm hungry and bed ridden.  Bonus: they deliver through Waiters On Wheels, which isn't as expensive as you would think, and so worth it for their fries (AND SOUP! I CANNOT STRESS THE SOUP ENOUGH!)",

A sad shell of what it use to be. This was the place to go and get great food and great portions. \u00a0My visit last week was hands down one of the worst food experiences.  First, let's talk staff. Or better yet, the lack of any caring staff. There was a wait (hmmm..wait till word gets out). We were then rushed..yes rushed..to a table by an older host gentleman who threw our menus on the table and then left. Such a homey feel!  It took about 10 minutes for our server to come over and say she would be right with us. How kind of her to stop by. \u00a0When she came back, her greeting was \"And what do you want to eat?\" That should have been the sign to get out. \u00a0The burger I ordered was bland and not cooked to what I asked. The Matzo Ball soup was watered down. \u00a0What happened to the great bread basket they use to serve? We just got some generic French bread.  I remember going to Max's in the 1990's when it was great. Sorry to see what's happened.

Matzoh ball soup- so-so. The ball was heavy and the broth was sludgey, not clear like NYC's 2nd Ave Deli.  -Salad: The salad with pear, cranberries and walnuts is excellent. My friend got the dressing on the side.  -Friend's brisket came out cold- she asked them to microwave it.  -HUGE beverages: maybe 20 oz?  -Raisin rolls were better than the regular rolls  You can have a decent conversation in the back area bordering the street- if you are near the piano it might get loud. The music was pretty good, but I want to hear conversation, not overpowering music.  Entrees took a long time to come, even though our group ordered before the big dinner rush around 6, 6:30.

Not much has changed but for the added brunch... \u00a0at noon on a Sunday I was surprised 1) we found a parking space and 2) there was NO long line to get a table. The cute hostess wanted to seat me at a spot where I've previously been seated, and I asked for a booth as I didn't want each and every passing waitress/er bumping into the back of my chair. She understood right off and sat us by the big windows in a very roomy booth. It was about four minutes before we were waited on, and we ordered drinks and our brunch items... \u00a0I settle for a Vegetarian Spinach Fritta which came with country fries, and I added a chicken sausage which was one fat sausage cut in half and fried... \u00a0and was very meaty and big. It's a great helping sure to stuff you for a whole day.... \u00a0for less than $16. The fritta looked almost like a messy spanish tortilla with big pieces of spinach, onions, zuchinni and even peas - hahahahahaa \u00a0- and I commented on that. Of course, a spanish tortilla is much better and very clean... \u00a0;-) \u00a0This actually looked like a scrambled egg with veggies...  I was disappointed when a family of three sat behind us and were waiting over 10minutes before our waiter noticed they were still not served anything. He stated a crew turnover had them sitting without service but he would be happy to take their order. We soon left and I estimate they had been sitting 20mins with a very active and hungry child.... \u00a0I remarked to them that if it were me sitting there so long, I would have departed long ago with a few choice but courteous words to the shift manager.   In our not-recent last visits to this establishment, I have noticed that the waiters/resses seem preoccupied and would forget order items, refilling drinks, etc. This shouldn't be the experience one has at such a fine place as this but unfortunately, it seems to be happening more often now, as was a point in case the family waiting so long to order and to be served. It doesn't take but a minute to check on your clients and I know in a busy hectic environment such as a restaurant, things change from minute to minute.

My vegetarian frittata was delicious! \u00a0I was able to substitute the potatoes for fruit and biscuit for toast without being charged extra. \u00a0The portions are huge and I was only able to finish half my dish. \u00a0The best part of our meal was the bread basket. \u00a0The bread basket included fresh sourdough and cinnamon raisin rolls. \u00a0They were SO good. \u00a0Our server was very helpful and attentive. \u00a0The prices are very reasonable. \u00a0The location is conveniently located near City Hall and many of the performance halls. \u00a0I will definitely be coming back!",

    "review_text": "Although I discovered Max's serves decent sliders and a pretty good clam chowder, the service was subpar today. \u00a0At Max's establishments, there is a list of Laws the staff is not supposed to break. \u00a0At least three of them were broken today. \u00a0  It started with the burger sliders which were described on the menu as coming with crispy onion strings. \u00a0When the sliders arrived, they were draped with RAW dehydrated wilty red onion strings. \u00a0My friend and I were confused because the red onions sure as heck didn't look fried. \u00a0This was when Law #16 was broken, because the server is supposed to check-in with us within four minutes of serving the entrees. \u00a0So... the one time something is wrong, I couldn't locate anyone on the staff to tell. \u00a0I decided to ask the girl serving water if the red onions were the crispy onion strings and she stared at me like I was speaking Martian and said \"I don't know\" and walked away without a look back. \u00a0A few minutes later, I managed to flag down our waitress to ask the same question. \u00a0Apparently, she didn't know either, because she ended up taking our dish away to the kitchen and mumbled something about the kitchen possibly having run out of crispy onion strings. \u00a0Huh? \u00a0If that was the case, shouldn't she have told us in the first place so we could have ordered something else? Who knowingly serves an incorrect dish? \u00a0(Now I am channeling Kitchen Nightmares.) \u00a0When she brought our plate of sliders back, she told us that they had been served the \"old way\" (whatever that means) and that a plate of crispy onion strings was on the way. \u00a0\"I just work here\" should be Max's new motto.   The manager finally delivered the onion strings and explained that the cook had plated our sliders incorrectly since the menu has changed. \u00a0I eat out A LOT and have never had this happen to me before. \u00a0It is just plain sloppy workmanship. \u00a0By now the sliders were cold. \u00a0Around this time, Law #13 was broken. \u00a0The ketchup was supposed to come before the sliders, but no one thought to bring it until the missing crispy onion strings arrived. \u00a0  To add insult to injury, we left $40 for a check totaling $20.66. \u00a0The waitress asked if we wanted change. \u00a0DUH! \u00a0 She broke Law #17 by merely asking if we wanted change. \u00a0For each of the broken laws we were supposed to get a slice of Niagara Falls cake for the table. \u00a0Without the laws in front of us, we didn't know to bring it up. We confirmed these laws on the website when researching a promotion we previously saw online at their site called \"10-15-20\". \u00a0The restaurant told us the promotion was posted on the webpage by the \"old owner\" so I guess that means they weren't honoring it? \u00a0The experience was so odd, it warrants a letter to the manager because I like Max's and I want to help them improve.",

    "review_text": "What a terrible night at the Max's Opera. \u00a0Was Madame Butterfly getting ready to kill herself? \u00a0Gosh, terrible service and high ass prices.  I went there around 9:15 on a Thurday night and they told us they were closing at 10:00 p.m. (they ended up staying open to way after that). \u00a0In any case, we were seated \u00a0on the Bar/Piano side about 12 feet away. \u00a0Big mistake! \u00a0The noise from the bar folks and the noise from the piano player made it hard to talk. \u00a0Also, the people eating near the bar were very very loud; subsequently, they had to yell to hear each other. \u00a0  Next time, I'll go there for lunch like I have done at least 4 times before. \u00a0  Now back to the service that night. \u00a0There was one lone young man talking orders and fetching the food for circa 25 people; \u00a0 \u00a0So herein that starts the problem with attentive \u00a0and timely service. \u00a0The water lady kept giving me water when I said no I don;t want anymore water. \u00a0She just was not listening. \u00a0The hot breads that showed up with the water were great. \u00a0   I ordered the Broiled Salmon w/lemon Dijon sauce w/toasted capers, broccoli and smashed potatoes $19.99. \u00a0The salmon was cooked just right and had great flavor, \u00a0 the broccoli was cooked Al dente like I like it, but it needed some type of light butter sauce on it or more seasoning and a light tossing of olive oil; however, \u00a0the \u00a0so-called smashed potatoes were terrible!!! \u00a0They were not entirely creamed and moist like they should be. Throughout the potato mound were here huge chunks of potatoes, so I got 1/3 chunks and 2/3 dry creamed potatoes. \u00a0Yuck. \u00a0The cooked must have been lazy. \u00a0   Now comes the terrible service. \u00a0Not once did the server come back to our table to see if we needed something. \u00a0I wanted to flag him down, but he was so busy serving that it was hard to catch his eye. \u00a0Also, he did not notice that there was was a silent request for an extra beer and well as a silent request for our plates to be taken. \u00a0When a server sees an empty glass and the beer bottle at the edge of the table they are supposed to come by and see if the patron wants another one or clear them off the table. \u00a0When plates are on the edge of the table with the silverware in the 4:00 position, they are supposed to clear the plates. \u00a0None of that happened. \u00a0 When we were finally able to catch his attention, we were almost finished with our food, (I left a large amount of the potatoes on my plate since they were so terrible). Amount 40 minutes into our meal, another woman was running food to the customers, but was not taking any orders, so our man was stretched thin.  We noticed that tons of people were walking about the are and were coming into the restaurant (I believe that the symphony or the opera just let out 'cause people were all dressed up.) \u00a0Also, circa \u00a010:00 p.m. (when they were supposed to close), a huge party of about 25 people all dressed up came in and sat in the semi-private sunken banquet area. \u00a0The area does not have any sound-proof windows or partitions, just open partitions. \u00a0We were next to the people and it was so noisy that I was getting agitated and could not hear myself speak. \u00a0Luckily we were finished and got the check and out out of there.  1 Star for overall service 1 Star for the lumpy smashed potatoes 1 Star for the waiter for not checking in with us at least 5-10 minutes after he left our food 1 Star for Maxes for not staffing the restaurant properly and making the lone waiter bust his booty. 1 Star for expensive prices for a diner type setting. 1 Star for the noise in the Bar area 1 Star for not putting up noise proof partitions in the open banquet area that is within 2 feet of the upper dining area. 1 Star for the loud Piano noise",

    "review_text": "Usually, I love Max's. \u00a0I love their fries and sandwiches. \u00a0However, this location nearly ruined decades of love for me.  My usual at Max's is the Reuben sandwich. \u00a0I'd definitely consider it one of the best in the bay area. \u00a0A couple friends and I got lunch takeout and all ordered Reubens. \u00a0Keep in mind, the $9.99 price tag comes with the sandwich, coleslaw OR potato salad, and a pickle. \u00a0$9.99 was fine with me, because we were expecting huge portions, based on experiences at other Max's.  We got our food and went home. \u00a0When we opened the sandwiches, I was kind of grossed out. \u00a0The corned beef was an unpleasant purple color and full of hard-to-chew connective tissue and fat. \u00a0I was almost glad there wasn't that much of it on the sandwich.  I think the worst part is the complete lack of value. \u00a0$9.99 for a crap sandwich and no fries or salad?  This Max's should, by nature of its location, strive to set the bar for the rest of the Max's in the bay area, yet it is a complete failure. \u00a0Another thing, they don't have all of the famous Max's desserts I love so much. \u00a0They have a few, but not all!  Tip to Max's: Replace your terrible kitchen staff (any chef will tell you it's 110% clear they don't care about the food they're serving or are simply inexperienced) and you will profit.  Tip to those who are going to visit Max's on Van Ness: Go to a different Max's.",

Megan and I used to order it all the time and nosh on it in between serving customers. It's SO good.   Secondly, the desserts are incredible as well. I'd recommend stopping in for dessert and drinks in the late evening. I LOVE the Niagara Falls cake-- chocolate cake with loads of white butter-cream frosting. So worth the sugar coma it induces! Also, the brownie sundae is heaven as well. Mmmmmm I think my blood sugar is spiking just thinking about it!  Thirdly, as said in other reviews, yes, most of the portions are HUGE. I can only eat half of that chicken pot pie. It's good to come here and split an appetizer and an entree with someone (unless you're one of those who enjoys having a muffin-top, of course).   They have a lot of different kinds of salads, which are, again, huge, and they are popular too. Their burgers are mediocre-- I wouldn't waste your money on one from here. Their pastrami sandwiches seem to be popular too, but that's not my cup of tea, so I couldn't tell ya!  Also, to be noted-- it gets super crowded here when there is an opera/performance, especially in December with the Nutcracker going on. There are loads of children running around. If you're like me, you'll avoid those times like the plague. :D  Last thing to say-- they don't take reservations, so if you come here on a weekend night, especially on a \"performance\" night, you should probably be prepared to wait a while.",

I'm so disappointed that we didn't eat somewhere better considering the amount of money we all spent for terrible Dennys quality food. The only reason we came in was because everything else was ridiculously packed after the Giants parade. It was either Jack in the Box or Max's. I really regret not settling for JitB; at least I would have known what I was ordering was going to be somewhat yummy.   I excitedly ordered a Caribbean BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich thinking I was going to bite into juicy deliciousness, but I ended up only eating the fries. They basically chopped up super dried, overcooked pork chops into big chunks and put it on a roll with some BBQ sauce on the side. How dare they call this a pulled pork sandwich!!!   I'll never go to Max's again and will do everyone a favor and advise them not to either.",

Although, the patio dining would be a great attraction, I guess, but the menu is so overwhelming and the decor is retro-90s at best and everything is a hot mess, including the servers.  We ordered some of their \"famous\" fries, which were only O.K. Everyone else got sandwiches which were huge portions but nothing to write home about. My French dip was actually pretty good, but stil nothing amazing. Honestly, I'd rather go to Subway.  I don't really understand this place, either. Opera singers? I heard people used to sing here... what? It's kind of like a diner and a musical combined stuck in the 90s on an episode of Cheers? Ugh.",

This was not an isolated incident, merely the most severe one. \u00a0I've had some occasions where I've had the one seemingly good wait person in the evening and she was an absolute delight. \u00a0The lunch staff is a little more enthusiastic than the evening staff, and the evening staff is, by and large, under the impression that we need them more than they need us.  All of this aside, Max's food is typically very good. \u00a0I just don't recommend this particular location for the evening crowd.",

We won't be patronizing this place unless everything else close by is closed or too busy, and we do not have time to wait; otherwise, we'll continue to patronize Max's on GEARY BLVD instead where their chicken pot pie is consistently excellent, as well as there many other dishes that we tried.

I can't be giving Max a four star salute if they're not actual cake maker... lol  Additionally, A warning to the guys: You're date, wife, girlfriend, mistress, WILL tell she will only take a \"small\" bite out of your cake slice and that you can have the rest.

I probably would have given it three stars then: Our sliders were a bit greasy, but the sweet potato fries were good and, even with a drink each we got out for under $30 in less than 45 minutes.  But I went recently for a friend's birthday and felt like I got scammed. For a glass of wine and a dessert, I ended up paying $25. After spending the equivalent on two stiff drinks and appetizers down the street at Olive, this seemed way overpriced.   Verdict: If you need a pre-theater bite to eat, go for it and literally stomach the prices. If not, check out the local eateries in nearby Hayes Valley -- or toddle on up to some cheaper eats with the fast food venues and Naan-N-Curry on Van Ness.",

For the record, this review is specific to the walk-up takeout counter at Max's. \u00a0I've eaten in the dining room before and never had a problem, but after today's experience I wonder.  There was no line at the counter when I ordered my sandwich. \u00a0When I got back to my desk and unwrapped the sandwich, the first thing I notice was the mustard. \u00a0I didn't order mustard on my sandwich, but it isn't the end of the world, so I tucked in. \u00a0  The next thing I noticed was the cheese. \u00a0The slice of cheese had obviously been exposed to the air for too long, because a one-inch band along one edge had become indistinguishable from plastic.  I looked at the other half of the sandwich and saw...mayonnaise, not mustard.  Now, I'm not aware of there being a condiment equivalent to an Arnold Palmer, so the fact that she smeared half of a slice of bread with mustard and the other half of the same slice of bread with mayonnaise is somewhat of a puzzlement.  I never uttered the word \"mustard\" while placing my order, and certainly never invited the sandwich maker to follow her bliss and do something artistic on my bread with the contrasting colors of mayonnaise and mustard. \u00a0I can only surmise that she realized her mistake after she began smearing mustard on the bread and, instead of starting over with a new piece of bread, corrected her mistake on half of the bread.  By this point, I had completely lost confidence in the sandwich. \u00a0I ate the chips which, having been made by someone else, were pretty good.  Did I return to Max's and allow them a chance to get my sandwich right? \u00a0No. \u00a0I don't have sufficient time for lunch to accommodate a return trip to a restaurant that messes up a simple lunch order. \u00a0Get the freakin order right, or don't expect the customer to come back.",

I had a nice glass of the house Chardonnay. Hubby drank his usual water, which was brought to the table promptly as was the bread and butter.

I had a small order of nachos which were quite good with lots of different items on them like black beans, guacamole, tomatoes, cheese, lettuce and sour cream.

For this visit, I enjoyed the Roasted Veggie Wrap ~ a spinach tortilla wrap with caramelized onions, roasted peppers, portobello mushrooms, avocado, feta cheese, hummus, and fresh spinach. It comes with a tasty side salad of fresh corn, arugula, red onions, and tomatoes, lightly dressed. If you come by later in the evening, they have a tendency to run out of certain items. We opted for the apple pie and chuckled as a flyer saucer of a pie landed on our table. I'd forgotten that Max's does it BIG. It was a tad dry, heavy on the crust and encrusted with sugar. The bright side is that I didn't chow it all down, so I've another meal for tomorrow.  The service is friendly.

Lunch at Max's is always the same, tasty, enjoyable, no unpleasant surprises. \u00a0Prices are reasonable, certainly in line with the food quality. \u00a0The last time there my husband and I, along with two friends were celebrating our wedding vows, taken the hour before at City Hall. \u00a0I always like their brew-at-the-table pot of iced tea. \u00a0When I do it myself the strength is perfect, the lemon and sweetness just right. \u00a0Instead of bread they serve, when requested, two warm rolls, one sourdough, one raisin. \u00a0Again, excellent. \u00a0Today I had the Chicken Caesar Wrap with Arugula Salad. \u00a0Their Caesar dressing may not be totally authentic (but whose is, nowadays), however I really like it. I especially enjoy the salads, crab cake appetizer and vegetable stuffed baked potato. The meal portions are just short of huge. \u00a0Every time I eat there I promise myself one of their yummy and huge desserts. Today, as always, I'm too full after my main course and can't even look at the dessert menu. \u00a0A few times I've gone there with friends just for dessert and have never been disappointed. \u00a0I do have one small complaint. \u00a0For some reason I've never been able to figure out the wait person almost always chooses to ask me how my meal is when my mouth is full and I can only nod my appreciation. \u00a0It's a small price to pay for an otherwise pleasurable dining experience. \u00a0I highly recommend Max's.",

Really just gross for 18 dollars!? The soup of the day is $8 and also very basic, diner style stuff. You're going to pay the same prices at Max's as you would at a very nice restaurant, like 03 down the street, but get Mel's quality food. The menu is huge (always a red flag), not as huge as cheesecake factory - which by the way is much better, if that says anything. The piano player was not very good either - very average show-tunes on a blown out speaker. \u00a0You know, I hate to disparage my fellow yelpers ,but if you look at the profiles of the folks giving this place 4 stars, you'll see they mostly review diners and places like home depot.

Sometimes its good to experience an overpriced place to understand why it's overpriced, then decide if its worth it or not.  I went there after watching a piano recital; place was conveninet and I didn't have to feel cheap by walking to the burger king. Had their ground sirloin steak entree; it's pretty good. Didn't knew it came with baked potatoes AND creamed spinach, along with onion fries. At $17, yes it is a lot. but then again the next time i had a craving for Max's opera, I opted for San Tung and ended up foring $20 for my meal of chicken wings and black bean noodles.   Lesson? you may think its overpriced until you go to another joint and end up paying the same amount. Know what to order and you'll be fine. also, buy their creamed horseradish. or not. haha i just found it at bevmo for $2.50; this place charged $4.50, but it seemed more than 12oz",

    "review_text": "Two stars because it used to be a great place and I hope it becomes a great place again but, it has gone way, way, way downhill since we started eating here fifteen years ago!   I have good memories of this place. My favorite memory is of taking my son to Max's when he was a baby, which we did regularly. There was this one GREAT waitress who used to take time out to walk him around the restaurant so he'd stop crying and I could eat!!! The waitress moved to LA and we wished her well-- I hope she reads this--we are thinking about you and still wishing you well.   This restaurant used have a heart, the type of heart that could warm you up on a cold rainy San Francisco evening. Like, come on in, sit for awhile, enjoy the music, the staff, and have a Corned Beef Sandwich or a bowl of Chicken Soup while you are here. \u00a0The food was never more than competently prepared but the restaurant used to really have soul. I \u00a0compare the Old Max's to a good Northeast Diner experience: Friendly personality, competent food, large portions and an over-sized menu (What happened, Max? Your menu shrunk! Your old, over-sized menu was part of the fun of dining with you).  Max's soul is gone. I read in other reviews that it was sold or under new management but, I really don't know.  We just had some of the worst customer service I have experienced in San Francisco, \u00a0a city known for its restaurants. We were given a wait buzzer to a half empty restaurant--what other restaurant in the city gives out buzzers when it is half empty? When we asked to be seated on the quieter side of the restaurant, the hostess, seemed to punish us by giving us heavy sighs and saying, \"You will have to wait longer then (even though there were clearly five or six empty tables on the side we wanted)\". \u00a0People were sat before us on the side we wanted--I saw it. So, I complained to the manager. We were then, rushed to a table on the more crowded, noisy side (piano side)--the side we did not want! It felt like spite, even if it wasn't done out of spite, it did not matter. So....we left...  Phffftt....unfriendly, there was a sense that Max's could care less. And, there was a very strong sense of them treating us like we were problem guests (Hostess, threw her hands up and exclaimed, \"What did I do wrong?\" Answer: Well, you treated us like we were asking too much because we wanted to be placed on the quieter side and we were going to be punished for asking that question).  HOT TIP FOR OUT OF TOWNERS COMING INTO SF FOR THE OPERA OR SYMPHONY: \u00a0There are tons of great restaurants in Hayes Valley neighborhood, and many are close to the Civic Center. We ended up leaving Max's Opera Cafe and going to Chez Maman on Gough St. At first, I thought we were really striking out on restaurants for the evening because I had to ask for a waiter to come to the table after waiting for a very long time. BUT, boy oh boy, THIS RESTAURANT understands customer service so much better than MAX's!!!!! Apologies happened from both the hostess and server! They were honest that \u00a0no server was assigned to us (Sounded like it was the bubbly, friendly hostess's fault--and, she clearly felt awful about it--and given her level of empathy, we forgave her and tipped to server well--accidents do happen--and, thank you Chez Maman for either properly training your hostess or just plainly hiring well). They made it up to us! We were told that our food was going to be rushed since we were sitting for so long. And, the restaurant offered to comp us for something we did not want--so, we did not take the comp!  Max's Opera Cafe clearly has issues. I hope they get their act together but--sigh, I am not holding my breath. It has been a slow downhill change in customer service for at least a year or so. The waiters are not as friendly as they used to be. Last time, drinks were forgotten, etc....",

I know from experience that when that happens, the lettuce has been sitting for at least 5 days. Either that or their supplier doesn't give them the freshest of produce. Either way, as I was eating through my second salad (first one I sent back) that was fractionally better than the first, I had a perfect view of McDonald's and Chevy's.

After 45 minutes, our sirloins arrived. We both had ordered medium rare; both were well done. We called over our super busy waitress and she took them back to the kitchen. About 30 minutes later, they came back out. Mine was medium rare; my wife's was mooing it was so bloody.  If you can't get a medium rare steak from a restaurant after two tries, it fails in my book. My wife ate a few bites, but we had to get to the symphony so didn't send it back a second time. She took a doggy bag and we fed it to our dog when we got home.  The accompaniments were just OK...creamed spinach and a baked potato. Again, a hard dinner to screw up, but that they did.  Not sure if we'll be back.

The portions are truly Midwestern. \u00a0Everything was very fatty, it seemed just for the sake of being fatty and not to enhance the taste. \u00a0My beet salad was drenched with a thick dressing and had the biggest lumps of feta cheese I have even seen. \u00a0Tasted ok, but could have been so much better if they had tossed it in a nice light vinaigrette. \u00a0I had to bring about 2/3 of the thing home it was so big. I had a bite (a big bite) of the bacon cheese burger too. \u00a0The Bacon was very weird, it was hard and crunchy, reminded me of dog treats. And I would like to see the potatoes that the fries were cut from...those fuckers must be the size of pumpkins! \u00a0Do they use GM potatoes? \u00a0How big do potatoes get? \u00a0I think there was a French fry that was about the length of my arm!

It was disgustingly greasy and the ciabatta bread for a burger? that was uncalled for! that was hard to swallow.......no really it was hard to chew and swallow. I like Ciabatta bread, but it was simply too much bread, to hard, too doughy, and hard to hold while eating. Everything was sliding out, I felt like a 3 year old eating a massive size burger mess and all.  I'll all for BIG stuff and large servings, but this just didn't taste good or go well. Who would have thought ordering a burger would come on ciabatta bread; that was upsetting.   Today, I'm suffering from stomach cramps and I have the trash can next to me. I'm seriously considering going home sick.   I'm sure it was a complete misunderstanding, I was given enough oil to keep a high volume KFC in business for 2 days.   I ordered a veggie sandwich this time and again it came in another ciabatta (this one was specified in the menu but I overlooked it), and wtf why another ciabbatta?! ugh, not happy but I still hate my food.   Every bite I took, had an ocean of oil gush into my mouth. I dismissed it, and said it was probably the fried onion onion strings in it. Then another gush of oil, I opened my sandwich up and noticed there was cheese, ok another reason for it to be oily...... so much for trying to stay away from fatty foods like red meat. \u00a0I'm beginning to get a little grossed out so I open my sandwich up again and start dissecting it. I find Spinach drenched in you guessed it oil, the ciabatta is falling apart because its a complete mush drenched in oil. Artichoke hearts bathed in oil, sauteed onions floating in oil, I couldn't take another bite. My gag reflex had had enough and it wasn't going to warn me anymore. I gave up after realizing I had to wipe my face and chin after every bite. Warm oil dripping down your chin looks cute!   Funny/ disgusting part:  remember those HOT summer days as a kid eating watermelon and the juice would drip down your arms to your elbow? yeah picture warm OIL dripping down to your elbows from this disgusting oil drenched ciabatta.   french fries are large steak fries.........they're forgettable.",

Also, while you're at it, Mr. Max, maybe you should train your servers not to have a horrified look of disgust on their face when asked by a patron if a particular item on the menu is good or not. \u00a0The server tried to cover it up by saying, \"Oh, no, no, it's good, it's really good, I DO like it!\" \u00a0I mean, I may be a little slow, but I'm not that slow. \u00a0It probably would have helped also if the server could have looked me in the eye, at any point, during the time he was providing service to our table. \u00a0  If the food made up for the lack in service, I would have given a higher rating, but unfortunately, my food was also not up to par. \u00a0I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, which comes with sweet potato fries and coleslaw. \u00a0The meat and BBQ sauce was bland, and the roll didn't really stand up to the sauce, which made the sandwich bread basically turn mushy. \u00a0The best part of my meal was the sweet potato fries and even they were just average, really. \u00a0They weren't as crunchy or as flavorful as I'd prefer.  Also, at the end of our meal, we were overcharged for one of the items because they had not corrected the price on the lunch menu and charged us the price from their dinner menu instead. \u00a0If the person who was overcharged wasn't such a penny pinching, Groupon deal using, tightwad, none of the rest of us would have caught that error. The server apologized and corrected the error, but seemed a little irked by the complaint in general. \u00a0  With so many other restaurant options in the area, I don't think I'll be coming around to Max's again, anytime soon.",

    "review_text": "Unfortunately it appears as though there is new ownership at this location, and the patrons, kitchen and wait staff bear the brunt of the corners which are obviously being cut. The quality of the service and the food has gone way down in the past year, which is unfortunate because I used to adore Max's!   I've loved going to Max's for over 15 years, both in SF and the former Walnut Creek location. I work directly across the street from the Van Ness location so I've frequented their deli counter quite often for lunch over the past 3 years. Unfortunately, however, the past couple of times that I've ordered in, seated at a table, \u00a0the wait staff has been overwhelmed, the orders were mixed up, and the food was not very good quality. For example:  May 2009 - I had dinner before the symphony with a group of about 5-6 people. I understand the restaurant was busy because of the groups of people going to the theater, but isn't that the reason for the location? Max's Opera cafe, next to the Opera house? Unfortunately, however, on a Saturday night they were way understaffed so the experience turned out to be downright painful. \u00a0I had ordered the Caesar salad with salmon, a $15.99 dish, not chump change for a salad. It came to the table after I had to wait while all of the other dishes were served, and it did not have any salmon. Or Parmesan cheese, or even dressing. It was a bowl of bare lettuce! The server somehow didn't even notice this (or maybe they were hoping I wouldn't). So when I brought this to the server's attention they responded with, \"Oh, yeah, we're pretty busy. I'll see what I can do\". After 15 minutes of waiting for them to come back, while everyone else around the table were finishing their meal, another server brought me a tiny little condiment dish of dressing to go with my bare lettuce. And still no salmon. Long story short, I clearly did \u00a0not get what I ordered, I was unable to finish my meal because it took so long to straighten it out, and the server didn't apologize or offer to take it off the bill! I couldn't even talk to the manager because apparently they were too busy calming down other irate customers. I was so shocked at how atrocious the experience was that I chose not to return for the better part of this past year.  But since time heals all wounds, and who knows if that was just a particularly off day, I decided to try it out one more time and give them a chance. So, just yesterday, I made one more effort to have lunch before going to see Wicked at the Orpheum with my sister. When we were seated, I had asked to start our meal with their famous cheesy garlic bread appetizer that I've adored since I was in high school. The server didn't know what I was talking about, and apparently they don't serve it anymore. This news broke my heart, it was an institution of Max's for as long as I can remember! If anyone is reading this review that works there, please push to bring it back!  So, instead of the bread, I asked for the Portabello mushroom appetizer, and specifically said we'd like it before our meal. Then my sister ordered a burger and I ordered a soup and salad.   And a few minutes later, a new server delivered our food, but apparently they had forgotten to put the mushrooms in the system and our main dishes were brought out but there was no appetizer. And my Caesar salad didn't have the anchovies I ordered or the right dressing and the croutons were very hard and stale (I guess I just can't win with that dish!). So since by this point we had a new server (the original one was MIA), I went ahead and asked them to cancel the appetizer since we already got our meals and the kitchen hadn't started making the mushrooms so no harm no foul. But lo and behold, ten minutes later a THIRD server brought us the appetizer half way through our meal, even though I asked for it to be canceled. And we couldn't find our original server, and they charged us for the mushrooms even though we barely touched them through our meal.  All I can say is that I don't know what's going on with this location, maybe it's the stressed economy, but I'm not returning until I know that their service and management has improved significantly and the patrons can expect consistent quality. What an unfortunate turn of events to find out one of our favorite restaurants has gone so down hill. :(",

    "review_text": "I was walking around town with my girlfriend and a friend last night desperately looking for somewhere to eat. It was getting later and things were closing. Then I remembered hearing about this Max's place not too far from where we were. I am from the East Coast and have had my fill at the NJ/NY/Philly delis and have never been disappointed. I was curious to see if this place could satisfy as well.\n  ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!\n  The server was perhaps the worst I have ever had. She didn't listen to a word any of us said. My girlfriend asked for a lemon slice for her water three times and the waitress still didn't bring it after 20 minutes, so I went to the the back and found her and kindly asked her for it. She apologized but kept up her goofy grin. Then we ordered and got our food. I ordered the brisket, which was dry and bland, joined by practically raw broccoli and a latke that was basically IHOP hashbrowns in circular form. Disgusting, and the portions were not anywhere near the sizes on the East Coast and way more expensive too. My girlfriend got a burger with avocado, which of course the waitress forgot. She dropped the food off then walked away. We waited about ten minutes then I had to go to the back to find her again and remind her. We ate and when she came to check on us and ask how the food was, I said it was ehhhh, and she said, \"Great!\" smiling the whole time. She didn't listen at all. Then we had to wait another 20 minutes for the bill after we had finished. \n  So moral is, the food was mediocre at best and definitely not worth the price and the service was downright terrible. I would never go to this place again and would not recommend it to anyone.",

While waiting at the hostess stand we were salivating over the food that was put up....looked yummy! We had been moving all day and were very hungry. We thought PERFECT PLACE!   We got seated and ordered. Our food was really really good, although 2 of the 3 orders were not correct. Our waiter never asked us if we wanted drinks. If he had, then he would have realized...because we would have told him, that we are all water drinkers...no one ever came back to fill our water.   One person ordered a burger with cheese, avocado, and bacon (like I said, we were moving all day and hungry). No bacon. \u00a0I ordered a salmon salad that comes with red onions. I asked for the red onions grilled. Again, the waiter looked like I was imposing. I said, \"this salad comes with red ions, I would like to know if I can get them grilled?\" He wrote something down, did not answer, and scurried away. Oh, and I asked for dressing on the side. When I got my salad, it had no dressing on the side...and white onions grilled...with some onion skin in there. Ever try to eat grilled onion skin?   When we told the waiter about the bacon, he seemed very bothered by this...as if it were somehow our fault, or worse yet, that we should just accept it. The only thing they could do was charge him for a regular burger. This is a critical piece of information in this review.  When we got out bill, I was charged $2 for those onions. The waiter never said that it'll be $2 for the onions...and they were the WRONG onions....REALLY??? I did not say anything because of the burger price, but this is wrong.  Would I go back? Yep. If only to see if our experience was a Max's rule or an exception. i hope the latter, but based on the reviews, I am not hopeful.  I hope that Max's management reads this and all of the other reviews and takes note.",

    "review_text": "The warning is etched on the door. This is a bad place for a diet! No kidding! We went in anyway and decided to let it all hang out being New Year eve! We were hopeful that we can get a good meal and be entertained by their talented servers, as after all, we haven't been into Max's for well over 15 years. But alas! I now remember why we stayed away. Their glory days seemed over as we ended up getting neither.  The evening started pleasantly enough with live piano playing in the background. The dining room was nicely decorated for the holiday season and appeared cozy and swanky. The Christmas lights stylishly lit up the bar area and the glass windows. \u00a0Even with a full house, the muted conversation and soft piano music added some class and sophistication to the ambiance. Being a fan of the opera, I was somewhat disappointed that none of the servers sing anymore. This used to be a unique draw for Max's during their heyday.   The server could have been a little more attentive but overall pleasant and friendly. Soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches, pastas, desserts etc. ...You name it; Max's have them all! \u00a0One can say Max's is like a glorified diner. We shared a hearty bowl of Russian Cabbage Soup ($8.00) sans beets. I assume this was the non-beets version of borscht. It was instead tomato-y and the other ingredients were cabbage with chock-full of beef giving the soup a savory, beefy flavor. With a subtle sweet and sour taste, the soup was great though not over-the-top great. (4 stars)  In the mood to play \"Finding a needle in a haystack\"? Try Max's Famous Crab Cakes ($17.00). Two good-sized crab cakes were served but where was the crabmeat? Bland! Bland! Bland! They looked like frozen patties with tartar sauce on top, which by the way was good but cannot save the underwhelming crab cakes. The saving grace for this dish was the red cabbage and jicama slaw that came with a mustard caper aioli. (2 stars). Skip!  Tri-Mushroom Fettuccine ($17.00) wasn't bad but needed help. \u00a0Even without any culinary background, I still know it was time to add Parmesan for better flavor; to spice the pasta with a little chili crushed peppers and to add a cautious touch of salt. I am not a huge fan of rosemary and thyme bunches and had to toss them. I wish Max's were more generous with the tri-mushrooms (portabella, shitake and button). The mushrooms were delicious though, and were saut\u00e9ed with fresh herbs, evoo and toasted garlic. The fettuccine was a toothsome morsel, had a good bite or al dente. (3 stars)  We thought we needed to order at least one sandwich since Max's is known for their deli meats. Since no one cared for a Reuben or Corned Beef, we settled on a Patty Melt ($15.00) that came highly recommended from a young friend who had no qualms with fat and cholesterol! I bit my tongue and reluctantly agreed. \u00a0Why not... today was NYE? We ordered the works and it came loaded with cheese, caramelized onions and 1000 Island on grilled rye. It was sinfully rich alright and sinfully tasty as well while you chomp into the cheese, the onions, the medium rare meat and only to sober up with the down-to-earth taste of rye. Yay! There was no guilt feeling at least today...it only starts the next day or the New Year! (4 stars)  The tart and aromatic Key Lime pie ($8.00) was just the way I remembered it from 15 years ago and provided a happy ending.... for the year 2014, I mean. The sweet and flaky crust was filled with a creamy smooth lime flavored filling and topped with a dollop of whipped cream. It was very refreshing to your palate. (4 stars)",

If there had been, I would have made some suggestions privately. But now I'll do it in this forum  1. Servers really need more training. Go to Houston's to see how great the service is because of the training. After my meal, the waiter did not clean up any of the mess on the table and just removed the main plate and set down the desert. Very unappetizing. And what ever happened to the singing waiters?  2. Food quality is going down. I know that deli was the best food to order at Max's but I ordered ginger chicken. Plum sauce was strong and nearly uneditable. Chicken dish was not as good as any chinese or thai restaurant. But the worst was the pumpkin pie with whipped cream. The crust was soggy and about 3/8 inch thick! And the pie filling was only about 1/2\" thick. It was like soggy crust with a little pumpkin smear. Fake whipped cream.",

Some of the items I like are the bistro salad, the matzot ball soup, the Russian cabbage soup, the latkes, and the sandwiches (esp. corned beef, pastrami, and burgers). Very good service, and comfortable atmosphere.",

As an entire restaurant, it's 3 stars because I like the way it's set up. \u00a0It's gotta a style. \u00a0Max's to me is one of the restaurants that represent America. \u00a0  I don't want to remember this bitter dining experience, so I'm just listing up the lessons I learned from it.  1. Don't push yourself to eat at a restaurant near closing time. \u00a0Your waitress wants to go home &amp; so do kitchen people (see the photos). \u00a0The bathroom could be nasty.  2. Don't eat at a restaurant when the manager or owner isn't present. \u00a0It's just my guess, but things could have been better with him.  3. Don't take out desserts; they might be spoiled, and you get VERY disappointed on the way back home in your car. \u00a0I was so upset that made me speechless the entire trip (which my hubby might have appreciated, which I won't know).  4. Following #3, if you ever take out desserts, don't get your expectation too high; always be prepared the unexpected &amp; the worst.  To conclude, it might have been mere bad timing. \u00a0Max's could be a REALLY nice restaurant, and I REALLY regret to say this, but I'm resting Max's for good in my book.",

I chose the iced tea - actually they gave me warm tea and a glass of ice and I put it in myself- unsweetened style my favorite. They have lunch box specials for everyday of the weekday. I was impressed because the sandwich was pretty good. I also asked for extra gravy and it was just perfect- not too salty and included mushrooms in the mix. I thought the mushrooms could have been more cooked, but other than that the lunch was really good.  I felt a bit cramped in the booth seat I was in, and our table was a bit close to the others.

(it may have been warmed for 30 seconds in the microwave as well=nasty!

I've tried their salmon, the Philly cheesesteak sandwich, burgers/sliders, crab cakes, caesar salad, Reuben sandwiches, steaks, and many of their pastas as well. To this day, my favorite is the skirt steak MEDIUM and shrimp scampi. Desserts here are delicious! I ALWAYS get the sundae with multiple scoops of vanilla ice cream with bittersweet hotfudge, marshmallow cream, and candied peanuts.. generous enough to share between 4 people and still feel satisfied! NOMNOM   The portions here are HUGE! Plus they give you fresh and warm bread rolls (sourdough and this dark sweet cinnamony kind too).   The atmosphere is pretty chill. It's kind of like a high-end diner? But not high end like a No-Jeans as T-shirt policy. It's a casual environment and you can see people of all kinds and ages dressed down and up. They have a full- service bar (hard liquor, wine, beer) and a piano/piano-man that plays music to which most of the waiters/waitresses will sing with to entertain you.

Max's Opera Cafe was a bit of a disappointment though. \u00a0When only the service highlights the visit that's not a very good sign. \u00a0I received outstanding service. \u00a0I was seated promptly and the waiter/server was polite and courteous throughout the afternoon bringing my beverage to me quickly, bringing my food to me quickly, checking up on me twice and just being a very good waiter.  I ordered the table brewed peach ice tea which I thought was kind of cool and unique. \u00a0The waiter brought a tall glass filled to the very top with ice cubes. \u00a0He explained to me that the syrupy concoction in the base of my glass was the peach-flavored syrup. \u00a0In a small metal pot was a tea bag submerged in hot water. \u00a0The waiter suggested that I could mix the tea into the glass whenever I felt like depending on how strong I wanted the tea to be. \u00a0I like my tea super strong and the mixed-in ice tea was exactly the refreshment I needed.  I decided against ordering a burger and ended up choosing Max's Famous Meatloaf served with mashed potatoes and a vegetable. \u00a0The food arrived in less than five minutes along with a metal basket containing a couple of hot rolls and several cubes of butter. \u00a0There was a plain white dinner roll, and a darker roll which had a pleasant cinnamon scent to it. \u00a0I cracked open the darker roll to find that it was indeed a raisin roll filled with dark and golden raisins. \u00a0The roll had a thin, chewy crust and soft, chewy bread. \u00a0It was excellent.  I wish I could have said the same of the main entree. \u00a0I'm not sure why the meatloaf is \"famous\" because it certainly was not for the taste which was pretty generic. \u00a0The thick slice of meat patty had good firmness and nice texture, but I was not satisfied with its taste at all. \u00a0It was completely covered in a dark brown mushroom sauce which simply tasted sodium heavy. \u00a0The potatoes were lukewarm kept on the warm side only because a thick, gooey light brown gravy was piping hot. \u00a0The carrots were quite obviously reheated since they had now reached a level of extreme rubberness. \u00a0Had there not been diners seated around me I might have certainly tossed a piece of carrot off the table top just to see how high it would bounce.  The desserts looked decadent, but I passed on them. \u00a0If there is a next time here I'll consider a burger. \u00a0Three stars but just barely.",

    "review_text": "The first of Max's 17 Laws is testimony to why this dining spot is as popular as it is - \"This restaurant is run for the enjoyment and pleasure of our customers, not the convenience of the staff or the owners.\" Its motto is \"Everything You Always Wanted to Eat,\" while at the same time warning \"This is a bad place for a diet!,\" and no wonder - overstuffed deli sandwiches, gigantic salads, and large-enough-to-share main course specialties, plus addictive fresh-baked breads and decadent desserts made on the premises, have been signature items on the extensive menu from day one. That's not to say that the kitchen doesn't have the diet-conscious in mind. Whether on Atkins or South Beach, those watching their food intake can enjoy a number of items on a carb-conscious menu. Everyone else can indulge in the likes of tender, meaty barbecued spareribs in a tangy sauce, brisket of beef in a honey-caraway gravy, or linguini tossed with portabello mushrooms, roasted garlic, fresh herbs, and extra virgin olive oil. Corned beef and pastrami sandwiches have just the right amount of fat and are as good as any found in New York City. French fries are crisp and relatively grease-free. Even the iced tea is special here - you allow it to brew to the preferred strength in a small pot before pouring it into a tall glass. And when you request a refill, you'll get new tea bags, not just hot water to add to those you've already used. Desserts are sinfully rich and large enough to be enjoyed by two . . . or three. The gimmick that differentiates this Max's from others in the chain are the servers singing operatic arias and Broadway show tunes. Don't be surprised if the waitress who just served your Caesar salad is now in the spotlight belting a la Merman. A word of warning: avoid a table close to the small stage. When the staff isn't singing, a pianist is tinkling the keys, and conversation can be difficult.",
