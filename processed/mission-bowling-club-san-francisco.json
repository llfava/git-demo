The food here has a lot of flavor and is well cooked. It's a bit on the fried and greasy side. That's my only complaint.  Corn Nuts - Crunchy. Paired really well with alcohol. It's a good snack to have out on the bar.   Green Chili Cheese Fries - The green chili and pork was really delicious. Other than that, fries are fries.   Fried Chicken - Really good! Crispy on the outside, warm and tender on the inside. It's what all fried chicken should be like.   Salmon - Delicious! I felt that this was the healthier dish and so I was really pleased. Trust me, just order it and try!  Mission Burger - Juicy and with lots of flavor.   In conclusion the food seems to come first at this bowling alley because it was really excellent.",

Everyone there was very nice and helpful.  Food was delicious. The burger was thick and juicy but the grilled onions were a little mushy. The fries with the aioli sauce was AMAZING!! The fried chicken... wasn't as big of a hype. Dipped it in the ranch and I just wasn't feeling the urge to get more. The brownies were delicious.  Had a few cocktails.

I would pick Mission Bowling Club over the chaotic 80% night club 20% bowling alley that is Lucky Strikes almost any day!   Tips: -weekdays are less busy (DUH) -get the fried chicken! -bring cash so that they only have to charge one card--I don't think they require only one card, but I can only imagine how annoying it is to have to split a bill 6 ways every time! -Bring socks! -Give yourself enough time to eat first if you want--you cant eat in the bowling area.",

I made reservations a month in advance, paid cash up front for three lanes, two with bumpers for the kids, one lane for the parents. We needed to accommodate a large group of more than 15. Including running an open bar tab, and shoe rentals.  When we arrived to set up for the 2 o'clock party, no one there knew what was going on. They had made other reservations on our lanes, had no clue as to who the party was for, or how many to expect. We got our lanes at 2:20 after much complaining.   We were not well received, and staff/ owners, there are about 5 or so, hovered and complained about any and everything! Even though, I spent several hundred dollars.   I found Mission Bowling Club to be snooty and pretentious when it comes to us locals.  After I posted this, I received a call from one of the owners. She said that she was hoping to maybe work it out and maybe I would reconsider my negative review. I decided to give her my ear.   Unfortunately, she said that there are always two sides to a negative review, she was commenting on some food that a parent had made to share at the party. I had no problem paying a fee for that. She claimed that we left bad tastes in each others mouths. Really?  I suggested they take heed of the negative reviews. When multiple customers complaints take on the same tone. Try to fix it. Try not to repeat it!",

While I can see giving it less than five stars (the service at the lanes could be faster, it gets crowded in the evening hours on the weekends), I get so excited about going that it doesn't dampen my enthusiasm. Mission Bowling Club is great in the afternoons and early evenings when there is less competition for a lane. The bar makes excellent cocktails. I haven't tried any of the food yet, however. The people working the lane area are curteous. I do think an hour works out to slightly closer to 50 or 55 minutes considering setup, but I've had mixed experiences with this and sometimes it seems closer to an hour. I think an hour is not enough time and would personally opt for two, which is the maximum, but either way is fun. If you are reserving a lane online, be aware that reservations can't be made same day. Be prepared for the other patrons to watch you bowl, which might bother our less skilled brothers and sisters at first, but nothing ever seems to be in bad spirits. Overall, this is a must activity for groups of 4-6 looking for a fun as a group.",

I'm not a big butter fan, so I asked for the butter on the side so that the waffle wouldnt be drenched in the butter. I was surprised at how maple-y the butter was-- it was like solidified maple syrup and it went perfect with the waffle. I can't get over how good the waffle was.   The wait staff was also really nice. Me and my boyfriend were like an hour late to our brunch/bowling reservation but they were really cool about it.

It just sounded too manufactured hipster to be true, simply a Lucky Strike with some thick rimmed glasses thrown on top. But I have to say that after experiencing it firsthand I was completely won over!   I was about to give it four stars because they don't have very many lanes, and because only 6 people can bowl at a time. But I now realize that though it might not be the most convenient for large parties, that's actually what makes this place so great. The space isn't huge and it feels intimate, and the smaller numbers allow the staff to be fully attentive and friendly to everyone. So be warned!   The other thing to note is that you can't order food at the bar and restaurant and bring it to where you're bowling. So make sure to leave time to try their food and drinks (which are delish, read on for more on that) before your game starts.   They're known for their burger and understandably so, but I also very much enjoyed the smaller and healthier seared scallop dish I had. It was so well made and tasty - you would never ever think you were eating it in a bowling alley! They also have fancy cocktails, or pitchers of beer if that's more your thing.   Overall my friends and I had such a fabulous time here, and were super impressed by the quality of the food, the service of everyone from the bartenders to the bouncers, and the cute ambiance of the place.

Mussels and bone marrow: No perceivable bone marrow, but otherwise palatable.  Baby greens salad: completely ruined by way too much extremely salty salad dressing. We sent it back, it came back less drenched, but still overly salty.   Then we waited over half an hour for our entr\u00e9e, so finally we paid the bill and had them put it in a box to go. This was the porkchop, which was a good-looking piece of meat with some nice veggies, but again it was incredibly salty. Now, I like salt, but this was pucker your mouth salty!*  They appreciated that we were extremely unhappy, and let us know that they were retraining some people in the kitchen. Thankfully, they comped our drinks and salad. The servers were obviously distressed over what was going wrong in the kitchen, so we left a nice tip.  I won't be going back for a while, until they get their stuff straightened out. This is a great little place that seems to be going through a rough patch.  * all was not lost; I took it home and used the fatty parts like pancetta. :-)",

Before one of my friends moved across the country for med school, a few of us got together for one last boys night out to send him off right. \u00a0After all, since we weren't at Mission Bowling Club to do any actual bowling, what better way to send off a future doctor by loading him up with fried food, burgers, and beer?  After starting off with a pitcher of beer, we ordered the Home Fries and Fried Chicken appetizers to share and a round of the Mission Burgers for everyone. \u00a0The Home Fries were pretty good (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hEXhf40Y9PdnYJzT_LEJlg?select=Z1cf09enbz8aNyZ7-GVtxg#ZrBCsmq-8lyNP_9qYIUPAA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hEXh\u2026</a>), and I liked how they were lightly fried and seasoned. \u00a0They tasted even better with the aioli, but I wouldn't say the dish was amazing. \u00a0Solid, but not amazing. \u00a0The Fried Chicken, on the other hand, came highly recommended by one of my friends and it was easy to see why (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hEXhf40Y9PdnYJzT_LEJlg?select=Z1cf09enbz8aNyZ7-GVtxg#FSqdmh6we1qZKAnP2Zi14g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hEXh\u2026</a>). \u00a0The breading was thin and crispy, and the meat at the center was moist and tender. \u00a0I thought the ranch dipping sauce was a little heavy on the dill, but not terrible.  Now as good as the appetizers were, the burger was definitely the star (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hEXhf40Y9PdnYJzT_LEJlg?select=Z1cf09enbz8aNyZ7-GVtxg#ZAJ9WBJh11PNw4NnSKmeug\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hEXh\u2026</a>). \u00a0All of us were fans, and one of my friends even claimed it was the best he's had in SF. \u00a0Although I'm not sure I would go that far, it's definitely one of the better ones I've had in the city. \u00a0The meat was very well seasoned, the patty was juicy, and the grilled onions were a great addition. \u00a0Lots of flavor all around. \u00a0The only part of the dish I wasn't big on had nothing to do with the burger - I would have preferred regular fries instead of shoestring, but that's just me.  Despite its somewhat inconvenient location to where I live, I know I'll be back at some point to both eat and bowl. \u00a0Other nearby alleys might have more lanes (MBC only has six), but I'm pretty sure none of them can offer the same chill atmosphere, a full service bar with several unique beers on tap, AND great food. \u00a0Even if there's likely to be a wait, that's one hell of a burger to help pass the time!",

Mission Bowling Club is more approachable and serves better food.   We came here for a birthday party, and the guest of honor always chooses solid venues for great people to meet.   Get your drink on - the beer list here really sticks out. For food, I can vouch for the excellent jerk pork shoulder sandwich, the really good burger, and the fried chicken. If we don't plan on bowling then plenty of the non-finger food dishes look compelling.   Pro move: Eat and drink only with your left hand and bowl only with your right. The only thing in this place than the bowling balls are the bowling balls' holes, of course.",

Each of those times, I arrived at this joint only to find out that they will be \"closed at 5:30pm for a private event.\" And the most recent time I was denied entry was on a Wednesday afternoon. Ok. Then why didn't you update your calendar to reflect this closure? Your calendar said you were wide open. I had even checked the calendar on your freakin' \u00a0website no less than 2 hours before I arrived and the coast was apparently clear -- your website did NOT mention being closed for a private event.

The food was less impressive though.   What we ordered: Fried chicken with blue cheese ranch green taco salad with pineapple and avocado chili verde mission burger  Um, I honestly what was going on with the burger. Large and really thick patty over toasted bun, with the standard pickles, lettuce, and tomato on top. One thing I noticed though was that it had no sauce. So far so good right? But one bite in, I realized the meat had less meat texture and more meat loaf consistency. And I do not like my burger patties to be squishy. On top of that, it was incredibly salty to the point of bewilderment whether the seasoning had been an accident or not... Just a no-go on this one for me.  Green taco salad was good. Rolled up into cigars and deep-fried, the taco shells are nice and crunchy. Add the slightly sweet pineapple avocado salsa on top and it softens up nicely. The strong lime juice, though keeping the avocados green and attractive, distracted a bit from all the other flavors. Alright in my book.  Fried chicken came skewered on a stick dangling over a pool of blue cheese ranch dressing. The chicken was fried nicely, with incredibly juicy and tender meat inside. The marinate is oddly sweet and felt more like a dessert than a dish. The ranch also erred on the sour side. Not a fan, but I'm gonna blame this on personal taste.",

The plush leather upholstery is a nice touch though. If you don't get to play, the food and drinks alone are worth the trip.  The mission burger is a serious burger. And by serious, I mean serious. The 1/2 lb. patty is cooked to perfection, with a sear on the outside that gives it a delightful crispy crust and a juicy medium pink center. This is right up my alley as I generally don't like burgers cooked too rare, because instead of having a tender crumbly patty, it becomes mushy and pasty. The burger is also seasoned very well. It's salty enough to make the rich beefiness pop, and the flavor maintains its integrity as it mixes with the grilled onions, cheese, and bun. The only thing that would make this burger better is to slap it on a charcoal grill. It would be divine to have the same crust and juiciness with just a kiss of smokiness.   The jerk pork shoulder sandwich was really good when I first came here. It had big smoky flavor, and the warm spices gave the pork flavor some depth. It reminded me of my own barbeque since I use jerk spices in my rub. Unfortunately, it wasn't as smoky the last time I ordered it. Too bad...  Don't forget the home fries if you're here for brunch. They have a light but very crispy exterior, and the inside is nice and soft. I also really enjoy that there's rosemary to add an extra herby flair.  Bowling + Good Food = Duh Winning",

The all American bowling alley, complete with its inedible food, piss beer, and tacky decor, has in many respects been at the heart of this great nation.

We heard great things about the burger and were very eager to try it. It was well-seasoned, juicy, and a pretty good size. But what really got my attention was the fried chicken appetizer. Perfectly crisp on the outside, moist and tender on the inside, with a tangy ranch dip. It was glorious. I will even go out on a limb and say that it was the best fried chicken I have ever had (and believe me, I've had a LOT of fried chicken). And now, months later, nothing else comes close. It was a decent portion for an appetizer, and at $8, it's a steal. The dirty martini was disappointing, but they had a sizeable enough beer selection to more than make up for it.   I don't go to a lot of bowling alleys, but I think it's safe to say that this is one of the better looking ones out there. The lighting was great -- bright enough so that you could see what you were doing, but not bright enough to ruin the atmosphere and make everyone look ashen. None of that garish fluorescent and neon crap. They had some interesting posters on the walls too. With just six lanes, there was a really long wait, so we didn't get to bowl. Not that I'm broken up about it, since I'm not much of a bowler anyway. It's a fun alternative to the dreary dive bar scene, so I'm glad there are options for a night out without sacrificing your need for good lighting. ;)",

    "review_text": "Interesting place hidden in the Mission! Came here with a group of friends around 4 and the workers here are pretty nice since our entire party wasn't here yet so they started us on the \"practice\" round even though they were going to be busy. We had an hour reserved for 2 lanes, at the end of the game I checked my time and it wasn't even an hour yet. So I'm not sure if he included the \"practice\" time into it (which he made it seemed like it wasn't) or... we got jipped 15 minutes! Only 6 lanes, so either come early or make reservations. They're also limited in bowling balls that they have or size/weight you want. I didn't care too much since I don't really consider it a \"full blown\" bowling alley... otherwise I would have went elsewhere. You don't get to control the screens as much... you basically have to go up to the person up front to add names if you do, which is kind of lame. More of a hangout spot with friends.  Food here, I didn't get to try much. We only got a few appetizers... the fries were really good though. Nice and crunchy. I think it came with an aioli dipping sauce that was smoked... I didn't care too much for it. I preferred the ketchup sadly. lol. But the fries alone were good and seasoned. Also tried the hush puppies... probably won't order this again next time.. nothing special about it and rather boring and bland. \u00a0Wish they had more beers on tap, but they still have a pretty good selection of other drinks.  Overall, nice place to just stop by and hang out with some friends. Bowling here can be a bit pricey compared to other places you may be used to... but again, it's more for the socializing aspect and it is in the city... so meh! Will definitely try the burgers next time. I feel kind of schizo since I'm reviewing two separate things... the bowling alley itself... I would give it a 3. The food aspect... a 4. So... I would give them a 3.5 if I could.",

But it is a bowling alley, and my review is for what the place represents itself as: a bowling alley.  I get here at 8:15 on Thursday and put my name on the walk-in list. The lady says she will probably have a lane at 10pm. She asks for my number to put down for when a lane is available and I give it to her. Cool. I go to a nearby bar. 10pm comes and goes. Then 10:15. Then 10:30. I arrive at 10:36 having gotten no phone call. A lane is wide open. The lady gives it to me. Me and my date bowl for 15 minutes before the lane breaks down. Apparently a pin is stuck in the tube under the gutter. Fine. Then it happens again two bowls later. A pin is stuck. Next thing I know it has been an hour and we haven't finished a two-person game.   The lady says I don't have to pay. Thanks for not charging me for an hour of my wasted time. I VERY politely ask for an opportunity to be comped next time I come (\"pleeasse I really don't mean to be a d*** about this, but I feel my time was not well spent here\"). She smiles, shrugs, and says she'll ask her manager. Her \"manager\" comes over and smiles, shrugs, says she understands why I am frustrated for wasting my time, and the concludes that she doesn't feel comfortable comping me for my wasted time.  Thanks Mission Bowl. Way to treat your customers. You wasted a full 3.5 hours of my time and you don't even offer me an hour worth of free bowling in return. I've heard the word STINGY but I didn't picture your establishment in my brain dictionary under this word until tonight.",

If you're a vegan, you'll love the Vegan burger. IMHO, I'd add some more greens inside the Vegan burger, or maybe a tomato. But the vegan patty is pretty interesting. It does not resemble a traditional veggie patty, it resembles a tofu patty more. This is probably because its made out of chickpeas. Its quite soft inside and lightly fried on the outside with a little spicy kick. Definitely different than most veggie burger patties. So if you're expecting a regular veggie burger, you won't get it. You'll get something else, but it will be pretty good.  Other menu items looked yummy too, I'd be back to try more things.

As for the comments about families, for me it's actually a plus that it's an adult themed bowling ally. \u00a0Not everyone wants kids running around while they're having fun with friends.. \u00a0sorry!",

I reached out to Mission Bowling Club and even though they were all booked up, they said they had a number of lanes available for walk-ins. We arrived early and were able to secure lanes for the party. The staff helped accommodate our large party and they even set-up my cupcakes with a birthday candle that we brought in. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for \u00a0bowling place with outstanding service.",

    "review_text": "Our rating is an average (rounded-up) for the members of Gentlemen's Burger of the Month Club. \u00a0Individual member reviews below:  This one's a down and dirty, greasy burger -- juicy beef, cheese, and tons of aioli. \u00a0In other words, totally delicious. \u00a0Fries on the side and a beer from MBC's locally themed list makes for a solid dinner. 4.5 out of 5 -Chris P.  This was a pretty messy burger. I ended up eating it with a fork, which is not something I usually like to do. Fortunately, I value taste over tidiness, and this was a tasty burger that was perfectly cooked and full of flavor and delicious toppings. The bun was also excellent, even if it was not quite up to the task of holding all the messy goodness together. 4.5 out of 5 -Jamie H.  At first sight, I was suspicious of my burger. The tomato, lettuce and pickles were on the side and looked like they could have been stolen from McDonald's. I was also worried that my burger might drown in the aioli sauce that looked more like an unhealthy portion of mayo. But looks were deceiving. It only took one bite into the unusually savory meat to change my mind. Best patty I've tasted yet and the aioli complimented it well. Fix the fixings and you might have a 5 star burger. Ps. Bonus points for the fantastic bun. 4 stars for now... -Paul L.  The self-proclaimed 'home of the Mission Burger' indeed had a fantastic bun, but the caper aioli took away from the rest of my burger experience. It was messy, rather nondescript and made the overall burger mushy. Also, for reference, ordering the salad instead of fries is a total error. 3 out of 5 -Cameron E.",

Before I felt as if my opinion didn't matter and I hadn't experienced enough to compare one restaurant's food over another. \u00a0That all changed yesterday when my better half made reservations to Mission Bowling Club. I've read reviews and blogs about how hip and trendy this place is (Food, Drink, Atmosphere etc...) \u00a0Hell, its a friggin' restaurant with a bowling alley as it's main focus! \u00a0Sounds like a winning combination to me. Our experience was so good I had to write a review.  I've had some fantastic burgers in my day... 'Awful Awful' in Reno. \u00a0'Burgers and Brew' and the 'Squeeze Inn' in Sacramento. \u00a0The super chic 'Umami Burger' in Hollywood. \u00a0My hometown favorite 'Andre's' in Lodi. \u00a0The California Classic 'In-N-Out'. \u00a0All fantastic burgers but The Mission Burger is a religious experience. \u00a0I am a fan of a good burger that is fresh, not greasy and has quality meat and toppings. \u00a0All previously mentioned burgers are excellent at providing said qualities but never have I had a burger that shows you what the burger should actually taste like.  Every quality of beef that we Americans like are in this burger: \u00a0Tender meaty chew from your favorite burger. \u00a0The perfect texture of crust and char from an open flame. \u00a0The flavor and juices of the best steak you've ever had in your life.... You know what I'm talking about, and they're all in this burger. \u00a0The burger itself was so good it completely out-shined the extremely high quality bun and toppings that came with.  I've never had a hamburger that completely nailed the hamburger patty. \u00a0Other places choose good quality meat, but then rely on some gimmick or topping to set their burger apart from others.  Not here.  Not at Mission Bowling Club.  I must also note that every other part (except for our host - slow, unfriendly) of our experience was nothing less than fantastic. -Our server was friendly, sweet, and checked on us at the best times, never too much. \u00a0 -The fried chicken appetizer was insanely good. \u00a0Cripsy, tender, very Chicken-y. -We even got a free order of home fries due to a mistake in the kitchen. \u00a0BTW better than any other potato dish I've ever had.... And I know my Potatoes!!! \u00a0 -For dessert we got Cinnamon Crunchy Toast which is everything you love about Cinnamon Toast, Creme Brulee, and Ice Cream.  I've had the single best Hamburger experience and single best Potato experience in my life.",

    "review_text": "5 Important Things to Know about Mission Bowling Club:   1. This bowling alley is NOT for kids. This is a bowling alley designed (both aesthetically and menu-wise) for ADULTS. The drinks are intense and tasty and priced for adults who work hard and want to play hard with their friends. The food is designed for a seasoned palate NOT for bowling alley regulars who want deep fried/greasy late night food like nachos or wings. Families you can definitely come once you have all graduated from college and are celebrating your engagement, grad school/med school exams, and parents 30th wedding anniversary but before you and your kids have turned 21 go to Presidio Bowl for neon-family bowling instead.   2. Go as a group with at least 3-4 other friends. You will all pay less that way to rent a lane and to share the tab when you order their tasty drinks. That's just common sense here people...  3. Stop whining about their prices. It's a small bowling alley that can only accommodate 6 lanes of players comfortably (at 2-6 people a team). There's plenty of room to sign up on their reservation list so call ahead and make sure you ask for a lane. It's simple if you plan in advance. If you go later, expect to pay more for late night rates. The drinks are worth the price and are tailored well with great flavor and food pairings.   4. A+ for cleanliness, service, and overall upkeep. Fantastic, intimate ambience, in a really unique space. It's both a nod to the neighborhood but also to the local artists! The art is a variety of styles and levels.   5. Upstairs, downstairs, booth, table, bar, outdoors and indoors seating. You think of it, they found a place for you to sit whether you're there for a drink on a date or with a group to celebrate your birthday they can figure out where to seat you. Outdoor patio with sculpture art YES YES YES!   MISSION BOWLING CLUB IS THE BEST BOWLING ALLEY I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. Period. It's that simple.   And that's coming from someone who has bowled in Chicago, Philadelphia, LA, New York City, and now San Francisco. Yes, I've been to Presidio Bowl and yes, it's fine but it doesn't capture the art, style, and late night/SF noir/leather chairs/bowling alley/sexy escapades vibe that MBC can so well. Cheers Mission Bowling Club, you are kick-ass! I will definitely be back for more.",

    "review_text": "Highlights - Who would have ever guessed this gem of a place existed in this area?  - Bowling alley complete with bar and restaurant all in one. I'm not even hesitating to say YES and tell all my friends about this place, so that I can partake in indulging in their mean burgers and awesome bowling here.  - I like the fact that there aren't a bunch of kids running around here. More of a classy adult day/night out with friends. - Foodwise, think gourmet burger because the burger is around $15, but well worth your $$. Probably the best burger I have tasted.  - Bowlingwise, they have limited lanes and if you have a big group it would be advised to plan ahead and make a reservation. Everything is really new and clean though, which is a plus in my book.   Improvements - Inconvenient location that is not very close to Bart nor do they have much street parking around.   Tip - Park at the lot nearby. It's not too expensive and you won't have to worry about your car.",

A customer having a beer at the counter told me that I needed to get the menus from the bar and gave up his seat for me and moved to the bar. After doing so, I ordered and got the Mission Burger medium. When I got my burger, it was just slightly under well-done with a slight tinge of pink - obviously not medium. I decided to eat it anyway as it didn't bother me that much to want to have them remake it and probably have them throw away this burger in front of me. The burger itself was okay but the bun was rather hard and was rather difficult to bite into. The fries were okay, nothing to write home about. Overall, it was underwhelming and the service, frankly, wasn't very good. I would understand it a bit more if they were very busy but they weren't. Don't see myself coming back unless there was nothing else available unfortunately.",

The food lacked irony - just bluntly delicious or not:  - $7 Sausage Corn Dog &amp; $8 Fried Chicken - The Corn Dog is just a sausage, breaded and fried. \u00a0The Chicken was a little too crispy with a little too much breading, although the meat was moist. \u00a0Gimme two bacon-wrapped hot dogs from the carts outside instead.  - $15 Mission Burger - A bit salty, but nevertheless tasty with the crispy fries. \u00a0(The Tall Vegetarian's $10 Vegan Burger looked good, too, but I didn't have a taste for fear of Tall Vegetarian cooties. \u00a0I heard you become a vegetarian, if you're infected.)  - $11 Crispy Pork Belly &amp; $19 Marrow Braised Short Ribs - Small bites of both were amazing. \u00a0Pricey for the size, but I should have gotten these instead of the burger.  - $7 Cinnamon Toast Crunch &amp; $8 S'mored Brownie - Get both, and then post a pic about ironically getting the best desserts at a bowling alley with the #YOLO hashtag.  The bowling is definitely posh - newer shoes, fancy scoring, and big comfy couch seating rather than plastic chairs. \u00a0But then again, I would have much preferred the ironic hipness of cheap folding chairs instead. \u00a0Wait, now I'm just confusing myself. \u00a0Maybe it's be hip to be confused?",

Mission Bowling Club is a triple threat! \u00a0You have the restaurant portion, the bar and a small bowling alley. \u00a0You don't have to feel inclined to eat, drink and bowl but you're certainly welcome to do as many or little or the activities you fancy. \u00a0 \u00a0  Our party of four started off with brunch (with reservation) at 11am. \u00a0Meanwhile, we were also waiting for a lane to open up. \u00a0Luckily, friend got there a little early and was able to sign up for a walk-in lane. \u00a0Otherwise, you need to call and reserve a lane more than a week in advance. \u00a0The waitress was great server and didn't get annoyed with our special requests. \u00a0Bf and I asked to substitute the sides of potatoes with salads and also had the sauces on the side. \u00a0Only gripe I had was that it took incredibly long for us to get our food (about 30 minutes) and there were only a few other tables of patrons. \u00a0   Brunch eats: - Crab Benedict: In hindsight, I should have ordered this instead of nibbled off of bf's plate. \u00a0The crab and over easy eggs were wonderful on the English muffins. \u00a0The Hollandaise sauce had just the right amount of lemony flavor. \u00a0Side salad was dressed with a light vinaigrette. \u00a0 - Mission Burger: \u00a0I hadn't had a burger since I can't even remember when. \u00a0If friend didn't mention the burger, I wouldn't have known about it since it wasn't on the brunch menu. \u00a0Apparently, they serve it all day. \u00a0The burger was huge....we guessed about 1/2 beef patty. \u00a0The burger was stacked pretty high and came with caramelized onions, swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and aioli. \u00a0I also asked for the side salad. \u00a0I'm not sure why they cut off the tops of the buns but that's fine with me. \u00a0Although the beef patty was juicy and well seasoned, it was a bit salty for my taste. \u00a0 \u00a0  - Waffles: \u00a0Friend ordered the waffles minus the chicken. \u00a0They served two perfectly golden brown, crispy waffles with butter and syrup. \u00a0I tried a small piece and it was quite yummy.  - Hibiscus Ice Tea: \u00a0I was very happy that they didn't put sugar in the hibiscus tea. \u00a0It was tangy and refreshing. \u00a0 Overall, the meal was good. \u00a0It's much better than any fast/bar food served at most bowling establishments. \u00a0Our tab pre-tax (including 2 cocktails and another burger) was $86. \u00a0  Bowling:  We paid for 1 hour which included shoe rentals for the 4 of us. \u00a0It cost $35. \u00a0There are 6 lanes and plenty of bowling balls to go around. \u00a0They have comfy leather couches for everyone to sit on. \u00a0All the while bowling, you can stop by the bar for a drink and also order food. \u00a0The bowling staff was super friendly. \u00a0Shoes were a little nasty but I didn't get any feet fungus so I'm peachy. \u00a0Children are allowed to bowl until 6pm. \u00a0  Parking is tough in the Mission but don't let that stop you from giving Mission Bowling Club a try! \u00a0Food is better than alright. \u00a0Bar seemed laid back. \u00a0Bowling = fun factor!",

There were so many of us, we would go up to the bar in waves, so we kept them pretty busy.

He brought out 7 shot glasses and lined them up and we were confused. He saw our faces and just said \"what? they're just shot glasses.\" He poured out seven shots of whisky and said it was on the house . . . turns out he was one of the owners.

In a nut shell.... If you are anything but WHITE, OLD, and HIPSTER looking guaranteed you will be treated unfairly. (Nothing against White ppl, Old ppl, or Hipsters)  Let me explain our sad experience at this hell hole....  Saturday Night 9/28/13: My friend was throwing a b-day dinner for his gf. SMALL group of 8 ppl. Upon arrival, staff still made the party wait for 20 MINUTES PLUS. Ummm reservations made for NOTHING apparently...while others (WHITE PPL, get to walk in and be seated with no problem no matter how big their group). STRIKE ONE.   When my friend's bf asked to speak with manager, the coward fill in mgr, who was a Caucasian female with short black hair, refused to talk to our group, WHAT???? STRIKE TWO!!!   When finally seated, two ppl of the party (myself and hubby) arrived half and hr late and waitress was asked to add us to the table. No big deal we thought as there were plently of empty tables available. However, per mgr, we could not add a table to the group because it was a \"Fire Hazard\" and \"Those extra tables were for other walk-in guests\" STRIKE THREE!!! Anyplace else, would of been no problem.   Service: awful. Especially if you are upstairs. Waiters are lazy (esp you blondie), and they will minimize the times they need to assist you to avoid the long trip up and down the stairs. STRIKE FOUR!!!  Yes, the food was good thanks to experienced culinary Mexicans in the kitchen, muchas gracias!!!   We bowled and that was OK as we had music (big whoop same at many other bigger bowling alleys, Lucky Strike, Seabowl, etc). What was not fun was that there were no waitresses to bring drinks. You would have to go to the bar to bring drinks back which is inconvenient if you are trying to buy rounds and bowling on a timed schedule. It sucked to have to wait for ppl to come back from the bar which at times took awhile and interfered with the game. STRIKE FIVE!!!!  As we were leaving to a BETTER LOCATION, there was a good song playing and my friend and I, who were far from being drunk, started singing to a song as we walked out. As we did, we were attacked by the door man who yelled at us to stop singing because they did not want the neighbors to complain. He literally tried to scold us as if we were children in front of other guests who were looking at him like what the heck is his deal???......at that point I had had enough of this dump and vowed to never come back. STRIKE SIX.!!!  Despite all the wonderful reviews ppl have left for this place....sadly not everyone here is treated the same. Our small group was a mixture of SF Locals, Military Veterans, Teachers, and Out of Town Guests. Luckily we went to 16th and Valencia St. after and had a blast which made us kind of forget the unfortunate experience at Mission Bowl which should be renamed \"WE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE DIRT BOWL.\"",

The burger is one of the best I've had. btw - the burger to-go is just as good as eating it there. Bowling is so fun, hilarious and if you're not a jerk, they're very kind about giving you a little extra few minutes if they can. At the same time they're good about getting you your lane on time and not leaving people who've had their time on for extra time. Drinks are really good.  It always comes down to the people for me, and as in every place I love, the people here are totally awesome.",

I was frantically trying to find a place to have my 21st birthday party and stumbled on Mission Bowling Club.  They were able to accommodate everyone for lanes, including a table reservation upstairs for dinner after. The service was very nice and friendly, and when they took a little while longer than expected to get our tables ready, they threw in an extra game of bowling for us!  In the end, it was a successful 21st birthday. Drunk bowling and good food with great friends is afterall all one can really ask for a successful night out!",

Honestly, it doesn't matter which drink you order, because it won't taste like what you ordered. I ordered a dark and stormy that tasted and looked like a long island iced tea (but a bad long island iced tea).   And the bar tender was so S-L-O-W. Partly because he was more interested in socializing than doing his job, and partly because he's clearly just an awful bartender. No wonder he was working on a Monday night (last night).   Bowling was fine, not great--but what you'd expect from a hipster hangout in the City.",

I couldn't leave without trying the fried chicken which came in several chicken pieces on a long stick with dipping sauce. The famed fried chicken was only okay. I think it was too heavily breaded. Maybe because they're boneless pieces but as soon as I bit into one the skin just fell off the rest of it so I was eating pieces of chicken meat alongside pieces of breaded chicken skin. Not the most pleasant way to eat fried chicken.",

The service was laid back and friendly. They were sure to check in with us often.  Cost: $26 per person total (including tax &amp; tip). We got 2 drinks, 1 app, and 1 entree - a good dinner for two.  ~~Cocktails~~ * Honey Bee - 4 stars (tito's vodka, honey syrup, fresh lemon, orange flower water. $10) Slightly bitter from the vodka, but the server did say this one had a slightly stronger taste from the alcohol base. It was still refreshing, kind of tart the way I like my cocktails, and lemony. A good drink.  ~~Apps~~ * Fried chicken - 4.5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-bowling-club-san-francisco?select=ozJI1IWrRBGLrmADKdHmGQ#ozJI1IWrRBGLrmADKdHmGQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/miss\u2026</a> (w/ ranch dip, cayenne + paprika breading. $8) What a great value! You get three giant pieces, and they all have super moist and tender meat. The breading was nice and crunchy, and the dip thick and delicious. I love low they hoist up the pieces on a stick over a wooden board so you can see the oil drip off. There is also a layer of some sauce between the breading and the meat that was spicy! We thought it was sriracha but it was their own seasoning mix.  ~~Entrees~~ * Flemish Ale roast pork - 3.5 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-bowling-club-san-francisco?select=ozJI1IWrRBGLrmADKdHmGQ#0e0RVC9jmaSrl00ShfpLRg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/miss\u2026</a> (and spring vegetables. pork belly, favas, orach, cherries, chard leg. $18) The pork was moist, though the meat was a little tough with very thick layers of fat. I prefer pork belly to be softer with a bit of a crisp, while this was more homogeneous meat. The fava beans were nice and the cherries not too sweet. The chard leg was basically pieces of crispy fried skin (nice). But the veggies were like collard greens, kind of flat and flavorless.",

Rarely should ANYONE spend more than $10 on a burger; if you're spending that kind of money there needs to be a party going on in your mouth, unlike the snoozefest you get (or rather I personally get lol) with Mel's $10+ Avocado burger that tasted and felt like a typical $3-$4 burger.   Mission's burger is $15. I was starving and didn't want to trust anything else random on that menu like the \"Seared Halibut\" or \u00a0\"Summer Ratatouille\" (really is this an American bowling alley or a fine dining restaurant?? LMAO), so I got the burger. I heard from others it's usually salty but mines didn't taste that salty. Of course again I was starving so maybe I overlooked it haha but overall was a very good burger. Except for that cabbage stuff or whatever that is that comes on it. I'm glad it automatically came with fries because at $15 if it didn't I would've probably yelled at the manager. Stop trying to act like your restaurant is some grand location with a beach view and orchestra. One thing I don't get is how the Vegan burger is cheaper than the meat burger isn't that backwards??   We had a rather large party because it was someone's birthday celebration. The waitress who seemed rather annoyed was trying to be nice but wasn't doing a very good job. Big tables are big tables. DEAL WITH IT.   For the bowling side: Um that is a very small alley; only 6 lanes?? Not worth the wait on a busy night (we went last Saturday). At least the glow in the dark pins are cool to look at. If going to bowl, be dressed for the occasion please! Apparently a memo went around that you had to be semi-formal because like all the guys had on button-ups and all the ladies were pretty much dolled up like at a mixer. You most likely won't find any baggy jeans, fitted caps, over-revealing skirts/short and tight dresses or sweatshirts at this place (except for me, I think I was the only one wearing a sweatshirt. In my defense, it was a zip-up one) lol.",

Plus Roam Burger is a current co-champion with MBC, but its just in a different class.  The burger was big, the patty was thick and full of medium rare goodness, and each bite was just an explosion of flavor. The fries were pretty good too, but then again, I like french fries in general. Since we generally enjoy more portions, I give the nod to this over Marlowe or the Cavalier based on burger size.  The place however oozes with trendy hipster-ness. I've already over paid for bowling at Lucky Strike, so I'll pass on playing here. However, it is a good place to people watch when your table is on the second floor. In the two visits I have made here, it does make for a lively and entertaining atmosphere. The facility and dining areas are clean, and the wait staff are competent here.   Overall, I do like the spin this place puts on your standard bowling alley. You can wait for a table at their reasonably spacious bar area, with a few craft beers available on draft. Otherwise, get a reservation online if the time permits.",

After waiting so long for water glasses, and not receiving them, I decided to drink straight from the craft (a small bottle). \u00a0This got the bartender's attention and she finally brought us water glasses. \u00a0Then, my friend offered to buy me a cocktail and the bartender refused to serve me because I had drank from the craft. \u00a0She said it was an indication that I was drunk when in all actuality, it was a clear indication that the bartender was not attentive and took more than 20 minutes to get us water glasses. \u00a0My friends and I got a kick out of this because I had only had two drinks all night and was clearly not drunk. \u00a0I apologized for drinking out of the craft but she continued to refuse to serve me a cocktail. I was unable to participate in the toast for my good friends birthday. \u00a0I was being very nice to the bartender and trying to make light of the situation but she was clearly taking something else out on me.

These were good cocktails, and were worth the $10 or whatever the price was, but they were just good. I wasn't blown away, but I thought they were solid.

    "review_text": "This is a fun spot for bowling, which I do about once a year so I don't take it too seriously. I've been here twice for birthdays and both times the large groups enjoyed their experiences. Reservations were made in advance to reserve mulitple lanes. Since you can squeeze 6 people per lane the price per person isn't bad (avg $45/hr/lane).   I definitely preferred coming on Sunday afternoon since I liked the brunch options better. If you like all the elevated comfort food, you'll like the fried chicken and cornmeal waffles, loco moco, chilaquiles, biscuits and gravy. Portions were fair for about $10. I would go back just for brunch without the bowling since there is plenty of seating in the dining area, at the bar, and outside. For dinner, the greasy foods are on the apps side and you get the usual California cuisine entree options for $15+, which is difficult to eat at that side shelf thing when you're trying to bowl. Drinks were also good and standard pricing for a non-dive bar in the Mission.  You can order food and drinks at the bar on your own, separate from the bowling tab, so there's no messy tabs to split among your party. Staff was nice and not pretentious. But when one of the birthday boys was starting to show signs of drunkenness, we were politely asked to leave.",

This is not your normal bowling alley and while it might be comparable to the brand new Lucky Strike, I am assuming that Mission Bowling Club has a lot less douche bags. Its more a hipster place than anything. (Think: guys wearing skinny jeans, thick rimmed glasses, hair swept to the side, drinking PBR). But hey, who doesn't love a hipster?  I digress- this place is awesome. The decor is really nice, the bar is beautiful. Hand crafted cocktails and an impressive food menu. The staff is nice as well. You won't find fake nacho cheese here. I can definitely see this place being a great place to rent out for a cocktail party. They have a beautiful upstairs and outside space as well.  If you're in the area, this place is definitely worth checking out. My only complaint is that it closes at midnight...hope that changes!!!",

Thankfully it was Pride and no one wanted to bowl on such a glorious Sunday afternoon because we had a nice choice of times to bowl.  There are only 6 lanes and you can only reserve one 7 days in advance. So, I think you have to be pretty zealous to get a lane in general.  The price is between $35-45 for one hour of bowling. The shoes cost extra and remember to bring your own socks because their only option are a crappy pair for 5 bucks. Obviously, somebody by the name of Natasha forgot her socks.  My bowling score was 104- which made me so happy because I usually bowl about a 30. \u00a0Those damn gutters are always in the way.  The bartender made me a glorious Bloody Mary to accompany my two previous Royal Bermuda Yacht Club Cocktails- a cocktail that tastes similar to the kind of drink that causes a lot of teenage pregnancies.  All the staff was unbelievably friendly and special kudos to the young kid that works the actual bowl desk. That kid is awesome and definitely knows how to do the service thing right.",

Because that is precisely how out of shape I am.  Basically could not walk today. Totally not a joke. Totally worth having a pimp limp today for all the fun had wiping the floor with my co-workers during a friendly game of bowling.   Our group of 14 took over 3 lanes, had a small buffet of hand-held bites that kept-a-coming, and access to any of the bar's hand-crafted cocktails, craft beer, and wine. The only caveat on these things was that you couldn't bring the food over to the couch/lane area, so you basically had to stand and eat, but it was a good way to keep the area clear and clean so us bowling aficionados could have our space to do our rituals and bowls our strikes, spares, and sadly sometimes gutter balls.   I was surprised to see there were only 6 lanes in this bowling club, so it's not ideal for huge groups or coming in without a reservation, but they have a great bar, dining, and patio area if you're in it for just the food and drinks, which as far as bowling alley beverages and bites go- were spectacular, even including some vegan options (burgers- which were outstanding).  Besides all the winning I did, my favorite thing about coming here was that they've got great balls. A lot of bowling alleys carry mainly big balls that are in the 10-15lb range, and that's just too big for me. I need something more in the 7-10 range and they had quite a few balls that catered to my lack of upper body strength, just out and available so I didn't have to ask for a kids ball or anything. \u00a0  I only wish I had more friends to bowl with... and that they allowed more character/spaces when entering your name on the score board so I coulda been 'BigErn'. 5 letters is too few letters, MBC.",

I don't know how to describe it. Anyhow, just go there and get some. You won't be sorry.   They also have a butter lettuce salad with chunks of avocado in a lemon-mustard dressing that I enjoyed. And fried oysters, and mussels in bone marrow broth. My date liked that, but I didn't. We *all* loved their s'more brownie dessert.

Pros-  * Um, it's a bowling alley nearby my place.  Cons-  * As I was walking in I noticed a guy sitting on a barstool outside the place smoking a cigarette and talking to a girl on a fixed gear bike. I thought he might be checking IDs but he didn't look at me and didn't say anything. As I walked by him, this self-righteous hipster loser had the audacity to say, \"Yo chief, where do you think you're going?\" He then looked at the girl on the bike and was like , \" what does he think i'm doing, sitting here just for fun?\" and laughed. I told him he was an idiot to think I was going to assume his little hipster jackass self was actually employed by this place. Strike one - what a F'ing douchebag   * The bar staff was over-extended. They couldn't keep up with the amount of people that were at the bar. It took over an hour to get the drinks the 7 people with me ordered. Not really the fault of the bar, more of an issue with a lack of resources.  * We ordered the \"world famous Mission Burger\". Who gave it this moniker? It was fine, but nothing amazing.   * You are not allowed to eat in the seats where you're bowling. You have to sit on a bar away from the regular seating? Ridiculous.   Overall : I will always give a place a second chance, however this places \"I'm better than you attitude\" has turned me off completely.

Yes, it is that good. I eat a lot of cheeseburgers, too (for example, I will easily go to Five Guys for lunch, In-n-Out for dinner, and Jack in the Box for drunchies).   \u00a0First off, you could argue that the patty is the best pure beef patty in the city. Many places will mess around with the cuts of beef that go into the patty, or they will mix in bacon, onions, etc, and those are all great. But there is something really special about a burger seared in tallow (beef fat). Very rich and a lot of meat, too.   \u00a0The bun is excellent as well. It is very soft and holds up well with the large, greasy patty wedged in between. The burger is garnished with caramelized onions (which are a little sweet for my liking), Jack cheese (could be good if they had cheddar or American, as well), and caper aioli (almost tastes like a high-end Big Mac sauce).   \u00a0The fries it comes with are about as crispy as they come. I suspect they use cornstarch spray to achieve this. They are delicious.   \u00a0All in all, for $15 (with fries), I am very impressed. I don't know if I would say it's the best burger in the city, but I find it hard to believe that there could be one out there that is significantly better.   \u00a0I didn't get a chance to bowl, but there were not many lanes. The bar area has a cool vibe to it, and the service was pretty good. We also tried the dry-fried pork ribs ($12), which had somewhat of a curry flavor to them.

And last but not least, what completes this well constructed puzzle is the dining room. The kitchen, now run under new head chef Chris Kiyuna, is some of the best food for its price in the city. The chicken roulade is exquisite, cooked sous-vide style with browned crispy brussel sprout chips... you had me with sous-vide. The burger is superb, and understated perfection of properly prepared meat, caper aioli, and a toasted bun.   I had to give this next nugget of information its separate paragraph-anything deep fried out of this kitchen is golden. The fried chicken is the best I have ever had, and the mushroom poppers are bomb.   In a nutshell, the Mission Bowling Club is a must. Even if you're visiting for a couple of days, I would recommend spending a day in the Mission, and some quality time with the one and only MBC.",

The only way I can see it making sense is that they charge $15 for a hamburger, every other entree is ~$20. \u00a0Guess they are trying to earn their money less on the groups drinking and bowling, and more on food.

    "review_text": "This is a really tough review for me to write because I love Mission Bowling Club, and have always had a great experience there. I've experienced their brunch, dinner, and bowling, and normally it goes off without a hitch. (Reservations are clutch for busy times on Thursday and Fridays.) The bar is well stocked with generally quick service, and the bartenders know their way around most of my favorite drinks. They also make one mean Bloody Mary.  So why the negative review? I went to brunch at MBC yesterday; two people at my table ordered the chicken and waffles (usually delicious). I have a hard time finishing full portions, so I split mine with another diner at the table. The table next to us had 7 people who all ordered chicken and waffles, so the kitchen was a bit behind on the dish. The other two dishes my table ordered came out about 20 minutes before the chicken and waffles, which would have been fine if the three of us who ate the chicken and waffles didn't all immediately get sick.  My guess? They felt bad about being behind, rushed the order, and under cooked the chicken. The toilet was my best friend yesterday and today, and I'm not sure if I can ever order more of their friend chicken. Which is such a shame because it's usually delicious. So if your orders are coming late, make sure you ask them to cook the chicken thoroughly. Your stomach will thank you later.",

The whole time we were there, we kept saying \"is this possible? How is this so good? That kitchen is so small?\". I think they have a magical vortex in the back where delicious food comes out somehow, because, oh my gosh. It is indescribable. We split the french toast and the chicken and waffles, and holy crap, it was all good. So good. The french toast was eggy and delicious, and the chicken was cooked to perfection - the chicken even has some chili sauce cooked in it...oh my gosh, heavenly.   The waffles are cornbread waffles, which are not my favorite, but they go brilliantly with the chicken and chili, and are a great pairing. Also, we had the best mimosas we have ever had in our entire lives here (and I love mimosas). They were just...perfectly balanced. Usually you get a mimosa and it's good, same old same old, but these were just... mind blowing. Everything was. I am absolutely bowled over (haha see what I did thar) by this place, and will come back again and again! Love love love. Our waitress was also lovely, helpful, and wonderful! Seriously. If I had a million stars, I would give this place all of them. If I only had to eat one meal for the rest of my life, I would want that fried chicken.   Also, the bowling is really fun. :) As a native Bostonian, I obviously prefer candlepin bowling, but this was still ok. The food clinched it for me, though. Stellar food and great drinks, and some fun stuff to do? I am in. I am so in. Can't wait to go back!",

    "review_text": "You know that guy that's great on paper? He has a double masters, a promising career at one of the Big Fours and spends his free time volunteering at The Food Bank...  He seems so perfect until on your third date at Balboa Cafe (which he suggested), you find out that e-v-e-r-y-b-o-d-y knows him by name. You then overhear from cougar #16 that he has mommy issues and has went through the entire cougar town and then some. Guuurrrl, I hope you kept that cookie IN the cookie jar!   This is how I felt about Mission Bowling Club (MBC). After being featured on a handful of foodie publications and being praised as having \"one of the best burgers in SF\", I found it to be sorely disappointing. They might as well be featured on Fieri's Triple D because that's how overrated I felt the food was.  MBC has been on a radar for quite a while since I bookmarked it after reading that the chef came from Coi and the Front Porch. I recently found out that this chef is now at Ichi + Ni Bar; overseeing the izakaya kitchen. I revisited Ichi last week and the sampling of izakaya item(s) we had were stellar so I think it's safe to assume that with his departure and the slew of recent bad reviews that MBC has gone downhill.   With a small, focused menu with less than 20 items, everything should be executed well; theoretically speaking of course. Unfortunately, almost everything we had at MBC was poorly executed.   I'm not much of a fried chicken person unless it's KFC (the Korean kind) but I do follow the 7x7's Big Eats List. I'm completely baffled at how MBC's Fried Chicken (3 pieces - $10) got on that 2014 list: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1fp8CKp&amp;s=8afc2bd9f0179ebf6ee62d42de0e34369a5e15963098544fb1d29e73104b82ba\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1fp8CKp</a>. They should rename it to \"deconstructed fried chicken\" because upon biting into, all the batter fell off the chicken like an easy beezie smashed on one too many patron shots. We also ordered the Deviled Eggs ($8) which were dry and tasted like leftovers from a tea party.   Another round of disappointment came with the much raved about Mission Burger ($15 + $1 avocado) which was on 7x7's Big Eats List last year: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1fnr0xi&amp;s=16476696231b4ec72616272c5c44e7ced57ee8e8219860ff3e279b8c829a6eb0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1fnr0xi</a>. I read that MBC uses a \"granulated\" patty modeled after the Heston Blumental technique. Blumenthal's, (UK chef of The Fat Duck, 3-Michelin stars) technique of \"granulated\" patty involves grinding pre-salted beef, aligning it in parallel rows before forming into a roulade (log), and then slicing into patties. The result is supposed to be a more tender patty because the grains are running in the same direction as you bite into it.  I'm sure the original Blumenthal burger is perfection but MBC's execution fell really flat because what resulted was an incredibly salty meat puck with a texture of a tightly packed sausage: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1huBaPU&amp;s=8202d22d6c69b7b015fff9868a238b7cb215610aa5674014155a53c24461d0f0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1huBaPU</a>. I like my beef patty to crumble into my mouth. This didn't. Sure, it was a big, half pounder burger but who cares when it was so overbearingly salty that I could barely finish half. Three of my gfs who also had the burger agreed that it was way too salty. The super crunchy fries (double fried?) were otherwise good albeit greasy.  The best thing of the night was the S'more Brownie ($8) and I don't even like brownies: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1bJkqGp&amp;s=07c6f8521ab2a5134a85a5cfa627e519fde3ab1bbbcb5d03f22a8ee1d774ab33\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1bJkqGp</a>. It was super chocolately with a nice crunchiness and oooeey goooeeyness from the torched marshmallow.   Disappointing food aside, service was painstakingly slow. Our waitress was really sweet (and so are the bouncers) but the kitchen had some major timing issues as it took over 40 minutes AFTER finishing our apps to get our burgers. Our manfriends sat at the table next to us and were done in an hour but we were left still waiting for our food. Mind you, we were the second table to order and the couple next to us who took over our manfriends' table received their food before us. What the heezy?!?!  Beware of the wrath from the female waitress with black, shoulder length wavy hair. As we were gathering up to leave, we stood near the ramp, and with a huff and a puff, she rudely said, \"Guys, I'm going to be coming through here all night ok!?!\" basically saying to GTFO of her way. My bad, your hipster majesty, we should of rolled out the red carpet for you.   MBC is a large venue for the Mission standards but tiny for bowling alley standards. There's an outdoor patio in front, a bar area with communal tables, a small dining area and an upper loft dining area. There's only 6 [short] lanes for bowling which you MUST reserve.   Our group came in six different cars and parking didn't seem to be an issue unlike the more central part of the Mission where hot spots like Beretta, Lolinda and Foreign Cinema are located.   TIP: If you plan to eat and bowl at MBC, allot at least 2 hours to eat since service was as slow as a herd of turtles moving through a pool of nutella. So slow that the girls missed our bowling time slot.   MBC is not 100% at fault though since our manfriend organizer thought an hour would suffice for a group of eight to eat. Sorry J, but not all of us finish fast like you.",

There were more empty tables than I would've expected, so I'm guessing most people come for bowling and drinks/apps. The prices are fair (~$15 for a burger with fries...) for the location.   There are only 6 bowling lanes, so things can get busy during the weekends. the four of us bowled for 1.5h, played roughly 2.5 games and spent $25 each for bowling including shoes.

Dinner was a far cry from the hot dog, cheese fries and fountain soda feasts of my bowling-obsessed youth. \u00a0We started with a big, salty bowl of \"home fries,\" somewhat pedestrian on their own but instantly convertible to a can't-put-down finger food when paired with MBC's avocado-edamame dip (we had to ask what combination of ingredients was creating the creamy-earthy goodness). \u00a0  Hot on the heels of the fries came a seven bean salad served over mache and whimsically strewn with edible flowers and crunchy fried chickpeas. \u00a0A perfect, fresh, flavorful palate cleanser, and a great tee-up to the hearty roasted chicken. \u00a0I used to think ordering chicken at restaurants was a cop-out decision that steered me away from more inventive options - \u00a0not here. \u00a0This chicken is roasted in a sublime fashion that produces impossibly moist meat that melts in your mouth while exploding with the tanginess of pickled mustard seeds. \u00a0The \"crispy skin\" perched on the bird when it arrives is the proverbial cherry-on-top, a guilty pleasure that adds yet another satisfying dimension to the dish.  We didn't get to experience the bowling after all, but the gentle thud of bowling balls on hardwood and pins hitting the deck was a great soundtrack for the evening. \u00a0And everyone seemed to be having an awesome time and not taking the actual bowling too seriously - no slick, off-duty PBA bowlers in this joint.",

I have been here a few times for parties including parties I helped organize. \u00a0  But recently I went back with my wife, my son and a friend on Sunday while they were serving brunch. \u00a0We walked into the patio area which has a couple dozen tables, of which only 2 were occupied. \u00a0We went to sit at one of the many unoccupied tables and were immediately approached by a waitress telling us to leave and pointing to a sign we had missed saying nobody under 21 is allowed. \u00a0  If they want to discriminate against people with families, I guess that's their business decision to make (unless it's illegal which it might be). \u00a0But if they make that choice, then they deserve to suffer the results of that discrimination too -- and that includes me telling everyone I know not to patronize Mission Bowl, telling my company to stop having parties there, and letting people on Yelp know about their policies.",

I'm pleased to say that it all came together on my birthday and it wouldn't have been right if it hadn't been at Mission Bowling Club.  MBC is located in the Mission area just blocks away from the Southern Brewing Co. and has plenty of street parking, too. Inside MBC is a good-size full bar, seating for dining, a dj booth, and about 6 alleys for bowling. The spot does get busy so please do make rezzies via online. MBC also has outdoor seating in which you can bring your dogs and enjoy the hipsters that pass by!  One downside is to MBC is the short food menu, however, it does have a couple of mentionables which include their infamous burger and fries and MBC even has a brunch menu worth checking out. . I do also have to bring up their specialty cocktails, which is great if you're planning to do a group thing (like I did), MBC has a full bar and offers all types of beer on tap!  Overall, the main reason I did book my event here was because it was great for all ages and allows everyone to have a good time whether it was just enjoying the burger, bowling, having a cocktail, and/or even just enjoying the lively scene- MBC was great for all these things! \u00a0Thanks MBC for celebrating my birthday with me and making it a happy one!",

    "review_text": "This place is so new, you can't even tell that it exists if you research the address on Google Streetview. But it's there and so are the crackheads! I came here for another friends birthday and we all had a good time!  There's a really awesome patio that fronts the bowling alley. There is plenty of space to lounge with drinks, or park your bike off to the sides of the patio. There is one person at the front who checks IDs, sorry kiddos, this is 21 and up. There is a bar on your left and seating to your right as you enter the actual building. The lanes, approximately 6-7 standard regulation go from the rest of the front to back. The building appears to have been an old warehouse, and there is this awesome skylight that runs over the top of the bowling lanes. The decor just feels right for a bowling alley. As a group we tried to guess how much it cost to build this place up. I had researched in the past how much it might cost to start just a club/bar and you usually need about 1.3m in capital to make a decent bar and take over the plot of land. But this obviously had to be a lot more considering that they put in a complete renovation, installed multiple bowling lanes. I took my guess into the 3m range.   I was really starving, so I made the rudest call and ordered food before the birthday girl arrived, and made her really jealous as soon as she arrived. It's okay my friend still hates me :D I got the 1/2 lb. Mission Burger and ate it really slowly in front of my friend. I pointed to the patty after the first bite, to show her that they actually cooked it Medium Rare, just the way I liked it. The bun was so tasty too! I also proceeded to eat my shoe string fries very slowly and also demonstrate that they were slightly spicy! My friend, the birthday girl was pissed. Who's an asshole? This GUY! That's okay eventually her corndogs and fried chicken came out and I dropped my jaw. They came out on platters skewered by their own sticks and propped up on the plate like they were part of a mid-evil castle. I also had a payback porter to wash everything down.   The waitstaff was really helpful and courteous. They were not overbearing at all, but I can't say they the were doing anything exceptional. There was a $5/person cost for cake cutting since we brought our own cake to celebrate my friend's birthday. What a phenomenal deal!  We didn't get to try out the actual bowling lanes, but maybe another day! I would definitely return to this place, the environment is low-key and relaxed, exactly what you want for a weekday night.",

When we checked in with the hostess they had two booth tables for us at opposite ends of the dining room! Even though we had reservations, they would not sit us together, they would not put tables together and the tables that were together were needed for \"walk in business'. I guess the idea of walk in business was more important than guaranteed business with reservations.  By some miracle a table upstairs had \"opened up\", which is amazing seeing as how we already had reservations. So we went upstairs, when the rest of my party showed up, once again they wouldn't allow us to put another table on the end because it was a \"fire hazard\" and they wouldn't let us sit at a larger section. Our waitress said, \"This is what's it's gonna be, so deal.\"  I guess on some level I can understand all their policies, but it wasn't just that, it was the way they spoke down to us.The house manager refused to speak to us, she made her hostess do all the dirty work. On the way out, the doorman actually told us to \"Keep it down!\" It's an effin bar, on a Saturday night! What a dick!  As a native to this city, I still have trouble with how much the mission has changed over the years. The fact that a stuck up establishment even exists in the mission, still gets to me.

I ordered the Pastrami Buns. \u00a0I was hoping that they would be similar to a similar dish I'd had at Momofuku Noodle Bar, and sure enough, they were spot on. \u00a0The Pastrami was a little dry, but as a lover of burnt ends, they were spot on for me. \u00a0Delicious sauce and I believe pickled shallots made this a really enjoyable \u00a0and again light dish   My buddy and I shared a side of fries. \u00a0They were perfectly seasoned and crispy. \u00a0It seems like fries are supposed to be hard to mess up, but when a place nails them, it is worth pointing out.  Service was attentive and helpful.  All in all, have to recommend. \u00a0Will be back. \u00a0Perhaps bowl a game or two next time as well...",

Can't fault a business for being successful. Go Mission Bowl.  The next couple times I went I reserved a lane ahead of time. Both times we had at least one frame incorrectly scored per player. Sometimes it'd mark the wrong number of pins, other it's skip a frame, other it'd miss a roll entirely.   Now I think every game is more fun with money riding on it. Gambling is an important part of my being. Having to debate scores, or adjust scores on the little machine after drinking was not fun. Wagers were left in dispute.  The last time I went the machines were working perfectly. Everything was scored correctly. We had just finished the 8th frame when our hour was up and we were booted off the lane. No ten minute extension was granted.  So that's 5 or 6 times I've been, and not once was I able to have a problem free wager on a bowling game.   I really want a bowling alley in the mission, but I'm going to try lucky strike or go back to Seabowl.",

I've been to MBC three times so far...once to bowl, once for drinks and a third time for brunch and have yet to be disappointed. Some highlights: the fried chicken and waffles (whereas the chicken is INSIDE the waffle - genius!), the blackened salmon and, of course, the Mission Burger. Not in the mood for a (well made) $10 cocktail? Belly up to the bar for a $3 PBR and some great people watching. $15 Mission Burger too rich for your blood? Come at happy hour when it's only $10.

It all looks like it's going to be a fun night of bowling and drinking with your friends, until they quote you the price. $70 for 4 pairs of shoes and 40 minutes of bowling. 40. minutes. That's absurd. with the pitcher of beer being $26, we were looking at a cool $100 for 40 minutes of entertainment, which is about 1.75 games, if you play quick. we had to go back and pay for 10 more minutes to finish our second one.

I would recommend that - just to enjoy the good weather and also, carry out an easy conversation less disrupted by the sound of falling pins!   After glancing at the menu, three of us decided to get the chicken and waffles (the fourth initially wanted to do that too, but thought he should be different and get the loco moco).   All I have to say is, get the chicken and waffles! That is the stuff dreams are made of. The chicken was fried to perfection, the battery crispy and the chicken juicy. It was complemented by the waffles, which were savory (made with corn instead). The best part though, was the maple butter. Sweet and creamy and whipped so lightly. Amazing. We all ate in silence for a while as we enjoyed our food. My friend who had the loco moco enjoyed his dish, but by the looks he was giving us, I'm sure he would have wanted the chicken and waffles instead.  We also all got drinks. I got the corazon de melon, which had a mixture of juices and Cointreau. It was flavorful but a little strong for me.  Overall, a great experience!

Their burger is probably up with there with my all time favorites in The City, perfect bun, big patty, caramelized onions. \u00a0The fried chicken appetizer is extraordinary. \u00a0I had given up on finding perfect fried chicken, but, low-and-behold! \u00a0Thank you! \u00a0My date ordered a salad with watermelon in it. \u00a0NOT my cup of tea, but it was amazing!  I'm looking forward to having brunch in their great outdoor patio soon!",

Apparently, it's cheaper than Presidio bowl, but more expensive than Lucky Strike; the food is great and the cocktails are tasty. The fried chicken was extra crispy but too lemony for my liking, I would instead recommend the burger which won several awards I hear.  About 5 lanes, and they rent per hour, so bowl fast and make a reservation now!",

We went in to get drinks and check out the place. Apparently the food is really good. The staff was great, super nice and fun. \u00a0Can't wait to go back with a big group of friends to bowl.",
