I like how this restaurant opens pretty late so I come here often after a session of karaoke a block away. Food is great here! Bi bim bap is one of my favorite dishes here. The red bean paste that comes along with it is sooo good too. I also like the bbq pork box and the seafood pancake. Mmm... AND I love their tea! It has like popcorn or rice grains in it...  I'm only deducting one star because the service is not that great. They don't check up on you often so you might have to ask for more tea and for your bill.

One of our friends used to live in Filmore, they knew what restaurants were actually good. Considering how packed everything was, having a server say that the wait was only 30 minutes was great.  In the end, the three of us waited for about 45 minutes and there's the place is super small so I'm okay with the wait. However, things from there went downhill. First of all, the service there was horrible. We barely has our server come by wnough to get her attention that we were ready to order. Plus, the table wasn't properly cleaned so sauce dripped onto my friend's jeans. Then we had to move tables because apparently the servers cannot figure out how six people can be seated at a table of four.  Now onto the food itself. How come there was no banchan? I've never gone to one Korean restuarant and had no banchan. I've lways at least had 2 banchan served before my meal and this place is not one of those fusion places where you could look over it. Plus, there was no red chili paste to put with my food. Considering how they didn't really season my food, they should have offered that. The wait for our food was short, but that probably had to do with the quality of the food. I got dol sot bibimbap. The stone could have been hotter since my rice didn't get crispy towards the end. The egg was at the right consistency and they put all the usual vegetables. It was an okay dol sot bibimbap, but nothing that would draw be back to going there.  For the price I paid, I was expected a little more for my buck since I've paid the same amount for the same thing in San Jose. Considering this is SF, I expected better Korean food especially since it is super close to Japantown and there is some good Korean food in the area.",

Order the bi bim bap &amp; the spicy pork plate - great combo to share for 2 people. \u00a0Even though I like to attack my food when it comes, make sure to let the rice of the bi bim bap sizzle, get crispy and delicious in the hot stone pot. \u00a0Just like the method to get great grill marks on a piece of meat, leave the rice alone! \u00a0Once you think the bottom has gotten crispy enough, mix in that spicy/sweet/bbq-esque sauce they give you. \u00a0I could probably funnel that sauce directly into my mouth because it's THAT good. \u00a0The crispy rice, the soft rice in the middle, the beef, and veggies (bean sprouts, spinach and mushrooms) and the sauce from heaven are a delicious combo. \u00a0The panchan are okay: tofu, bean cakes, kim chee, and my favorite pickled veggies (usually carrots and radishes). \u00a0If you finish a side, they are really nice and will give you more for free, which always happens to me because I only eat the kim chee and the pickled veggies. \u00a0One time, they randomly put potato salad in the panchan dish, and I thought I was at Hawaiian Drive-In and not Arang. \u00a0However, the service is always quick, and their servers are kind and attentive.  The music will make you go bonkers at times while simultaneously making you laugh or roll your eyes. \u00a0Their bathroom is one I would normally try to avoid. \u00a0The last time I was there it wasn't particularly clean, and there was a dirty mop in the corner. \u00a0Let's hope that the bi bim bap doesn't cause big messes!",

Friend ordered the grilled beef box (it came with noodles + gyoza + salad and I forget the rest) and I ordered the grilled short ribs plate (since I was really hungry and needed protein...)  We also shared soju (yellow kind) and off we went with our gossip time.  Food came out pretty quickly. Friend finished her food (just the right amount for her) and my grilled short ribs was good and it satisfied the craving. Meat quality wasn't the best and it wasn't really grilled up to my taste...

It's hella hard finding Ramyun (Ramen) at the Korean places around Japantown-we did some hard searching and this was the only place that has it. The Ramyun was good for all the reasons I go to a restaurant for Korean ramen-it was hot and spicy, prepared with eggs and they even threw in some shrimp in there.   My friend ordered Seafood Bibimbap and while I'm kinda iffy about beef bibimbap, my friend's seafood Bibimbap was really good! Maybe I'll break out of my rut and try that next time.   The ambiance was cozy and laid-back. It took a WHILE for them to notice that we were ready to order-this is why I wouldn't recommend sitting at any table outside of the vicinity of the counter. The prices are very reasonable (the ones closer to Japantown tend to be pricier), so maybe what you lack in service, they make up for in prices?",

All alcoholic beverages are 50% off until the end of February! \u00a0So it's only $12 for a large pitcher of flavored soju right now! \u00a0You seriously can't get that deal anywhere else. Even at the original price, it's a steal. \u00a0Unfortunately, they only offer two kinds of flavored soju which is either lemon or peach. \u00a0Actually both flavors taste pretty much the same so it really doesn't matter which one you order. \u00a0The soju tastes great and it will get you buzzed before you realize it!  The food isn't anything to rant and rave about but it really isn't bad. \u00a0I've only tried the bibimbap and the tofu soup so I really can't say much but the food definitely has a homemade feel to it. \u00a0And the two ladies that work there are super nice. \u00a0A bit slow and forgetful sometimes on the service end but their friendliness definitely makes up for that.",

    "review_text": "Arang is one of the most authentic Korean restaurants I have been to. Service is hit and miss: sometimes you have good service and sometimes you have bad service. Food here, however, is delicious! The best time to come is during their lunch hours. Their prices for their lunch menu are unbeatable for the large amount of food you get. You basically get full dinner portions for the lunch items. Their dinner menu basically has the same items as the lunch menu with more entrees but dinner is more pricey than the lunch items.They have the best tofu soup, and seafood bibambap (rice with mixed veggies and seafood in a hot stoneware bowl) in SF. Their seafood pancake is also something you should try! And see if you can get it cooked with Kimchi (only certain servers know you can add kimchi to the pancake to make it a seafood kimchi pancake). They have a variety of non-spicy dishes too for those who cannot handle the heat. They serve lots of banchan (korean side condiment dishes), and these are refillable. You just have to ask the servers to do it. Their entrees are big enough for two people to share. They also serve you green tea with toasted glutinous rice on top. They also have regular sodas, and soju (alcoholic korean mixed cocktails)! You can buy the soju in pitchers.  They play korean pop music at night, and an american light rock music station during the day time.   There is parking on the street, and some people even park in the Safeway parking lot since the restaurant is located in the same plaza area. However do this with caution! I been told that some cars actually do get towed away for parking in the Safeway parking lot!  Other than hit and miss service, and the parking, I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try authentic Korean dishes.",

Arang uses all of the above, and also throws in some Cinnamon Toast Crunch-type cereal to the icy mush. $5 for a bowl big enough for two people.  As for the food, I've only had the soon dae (Korean sausage) and ddukboggi (rice cakes and vegetables in a sweet, spicy sauce), which were both decent. This place is more of a casual meal/street food/drinking spot than a regular restaurant. That's why you won't get the full array of panchan with your food.",

I asked for the kimchi fried rice, but EXTRA spicy. And you know what? They did just that!  I'm a simple person (sometimes, HA), and there are days when I have simple requests.

Think of it as Korean Tapas or Izakaya fare? And of course, they have beer and Soju (Korean version of vodka like alcohol) and mixed Soju (Soju cocktail that tastes like lemonade, among others)  It's a fun place to get in and out for a quick lunch or get totally drunk (just don't drink and drive)  As with all other Korean places, banchan (side dishes) are free and free flowing. :D",

The \"pitcher\" was more like a small at other places and it was very light on the alcohol), seafood bibimbap (which was weird that did had already put the sauce in there for you. How are you gonna tell me how salty/spicy I want it?), Pork bulgogi and Kalbi (which they were generous about and they were both pretty good), Japchae (which was oddly watery and was like it was SOAKED in soysauce or something), and Duk Bok Ki (my favorite korean bar dish so I can't complain).   They were cheap about the side dishes. Who does that? This place! When I tried to ask for more, they tell me they had ran out. W.T.F? Seriously? How are you going to lie to my face when I see other people getting seated and being served that? LAME!",

Open until 2am, plenty of parking in the Safeway lot, small homey feel, and most important good, relatively cheap food.  Been here on several occasions now but tonight solidified the 4 stars. It's been CONSISTENTLY good. They serve no frills Korean food, tofu soups, bi bim bap, chap chae, fried rice omelet, yu ge jang, etc. They also have the grilled meats but they cook it in the kitchen and not at your table.  Tonight I had the Soon Du Bul ($8.95) and it was hot, spicy, full of flavor, and contained fresh hunks of tofu. VERY satisfying on a cold SF evening. My cousin had the Yu Ge Jang ($9.95) and that was super yummy too. Spicy beef soup, more pure beef taste, more broth, no tofu. Really good.  I've had the casserole for 2, dok bok gi, and a variety of other dishes. I have always been happily satisfied. The only downsides are the unexciting pan chan or small side dishes. It's usually a cabbage, a cucumber, potato salad, bean curd, and egg served in one of those multi-divisional plates (like the ones used for little kids). Service can be splotchy too.  But I can overlook all that in favor of the good food, under $10 entrees, and barley tea. Oh and of course, the crowning melon gum at the end of the meal. Who can resist that?",

If you are looking for really authentic korean food then i probably wouldn't come here... i'd go a block down on fillmore where there are other korean restaurants that are more authentic. anyways, the prices aren't bad ... me and my friends come here when we're craving korean late at night or after we've finished going clubbing.. i love it because they usually open up until 2am! It's also good to come here during lunch because their prices are even cheaper! Whenever I come here i always order the bento box - the beef short rib, rice, chop che, 2 potstickers, vermacelli, pieces of potato... and i can't remember the rest.. the flavor of the beef was quite delicious and plus they give you a good amount of food. As i recall, the tempura wasn't up to my standards - maybe because it \u00a0isn't a japanese restaurant. it was kind of soggy. The bi bim bop was also good too! Let's see what else, the only downside about this place is that on weekends there can be a long wait because the place is small and service can be slow at times. I've never had a bad experience here... all i know is that this place is good for drinking alcohol with friends and eating your heart out to some good korean food! =)",

Very small storefront where the door is. \u00a0I'm a fan of everything Korean (I'm Chinese). Discovered a Korean dessert called Patbingsu which is really good. I think Arang is the only restaurant in SF that has it (at least mentioned on Yelp). Found 2 places in Santa Clara and 1 in San Mateo. I started off with dinner. I had the Soft Tofu Soup. It was only $9.95 and was decent size. Not the smallest or biggest I've ever had. This place has Japanese and Korean food and lunch specials. Have to try the Fried Chicken tossed with Spicy Korean BBQ sauce (I've made it myself before. It's less messy to have someone else make it). I'm going to have to try other dishes. Prices are reasonable. Saw another table that had this relatively large metal bowl over a portable stove that had noodles, spam, sausage, vegetables in a spicy broth. Have to try that next time. Ordered my Patbingsu. Took only about 5 minutes for them to bring it out. It was sized for one. Had ice shavings, red beans, corn chex flakes, fruit cocktail, a little ice cream and thinly sliced banana. I finished the whole thing. Only $5.95. I forgot to take a pic of my food. Next time. Service was decent. No issues. I'll write another review after I've tried a few more dishes.  Atmosphere in the place was nice. Only had about 8 tables in the place. So probably not good for groups. Not sure if there is a back room or upstairs. Music system played a mixture of English and Korean music. Not too loud.",

Usually at Korean places you are served banchan, the side dishes of kimchi, soybeans, cucumbers etc before the actual meal comes but at this restaurant we didn't receive our banchan tray until the main meal arrived which was kind of strange.   The tofu soup was just okay, not anything stellar but it had A LOT of tofu in it. It was difficult to find anything else in the soup (aka meat) since everything was tofu lol The broth was a bit spicy but tasted good and they give you a side of rice. I still think it was overpriced for what it was though. The bf thought the bibimbap was pretty good but not anything overwhelmingly awesome.

We were told the wait would be 2 hours and after coming back in 2 hours we were told it would be 2 more. Some regulars outside told us chances are we wouldn't get a seat no matter how long we waited. So I was so thankful we ended up coming to Arang because we were seated promptly and people working there were very nice and friendly. The food isn't as good as what you'll get at a place like Meogeoboka or Ohganae but it's quite a lot cheaper and still tasty. Here's what I recommend here:  Sea food bi bim bap - actually very good even compared to other more expensive and nicer Korean restaurants  Beef bone and potato casserole - tasty and spicy, it has chunks of beef on the bone, potato, sprouts, jalapeno, other green thing, in a spicy broth. If you order the large one it can be enough for 3-4 people no problem.  Sea food pancake   Mussel soup - I try to always end the night with this. It's so soothing and tasty, just mussels, white onions, green onions, jalapeno, salt and pepper.   Soju cocktail - lemon one tastes the best for me   I also really have a crush on the waitress working here on Saturdays. She's really cute and nice. My friends think she's a little old for me but I think it's ok because she's so friendly. So that's a plus!   So, I give it 4 stars because I don't think the food is really AMAZING like places in LA or Oakland or Korea House in Hayward, and the panchan is not really very good, but I always have a great time here and the food is good.",

He said, OK, and seemed like he was going to go get it, but then he didn't. I saw him on the other side of the counter just standing around looking unsure of himself, and then eventually he brought us our dinner orders, but still no tea. So, I had to ask again. He finally brought me another cup of tea, and it still wasn't even hot. Then we had to chase him down once we finished eating to get the check. And I mean we literally had to get up and find him because he was nowhere to be seen.  90% of what I eat is asian food so I'm used to bad service but it is tiring sometimes to have to run after a waiter when there are only 3 other tables for him to wait on lol.

Korean BBQ places (in my humble opinion) should be judged on 3 things.  1) tea 2)Kimchee 3) Spare Ribs (this is the important one.

The assortment of sides we had were good too. \u00a0Gyoza was tasty, and teh virmacelli (no \u00a0I can't spell..) was really really good. \u00a0Maybe it was cause we went to go, but the tempura was sub-par and chewy rather than crispy.

The food isn't the greatest Korean food that SF has to offer and its not the cheapest either. \u00a0I go strictly to get wasted on soju with my friends and eat random stuff from the menu. \u00a0I likey me some soju. (i'm asian, i could talk like this)  I also likey me the little area with the mirrors. \u00a0This allows me and my friends to check out the chicks that walk in and sit down. \u00a0If the soju is hitting exceptionally \u00a0good that night, maybe I'll bring up the nerve throw a wink and a smile. \u00a0This, in turn, compels said chicks to eat their food faster and leave asap so the next group of eye candy could sit down. \u00a0score.  the k-pop music in the background? well, lets just say it gets the labido going. \u00a0just kidding. its sounds like Korean Britney Spears or NSync half the time. \u00a0If only i spoke Korean...  i'd tell the waitresses to change the CD.  anyways...3 things that keep me going back.  Peach Soju, Lemon Soju, and Hite Beer. \u00a0I could easily buy these at a Korean supermarket, but it's more fun when you're looking at chicks. Through mirrors of course.",

The kimchi fried rice is really good, but their portion is pretty small :/ The sea bass soup is pretty decent as well, a lot of flavor and not too fishy. The great part about this restaurant is that they're open til 2am everyday!  One of the guy waiters who wears glasses sucks and always acts confused like he doesn't know what you're saying when you ask him for something. He has terrible service. Me and my bf were in the middle of ordering our soju to start off and he walked off as we were taking to him. He also kept dropping bowls and spoons as he was cleaning up after other people. I wanted a glass of ice water and he brought me a glass full of just ice. I told my bf to give him no tip when we ate there.   Other than that one waiter, this is definitely a regular food place for me since I live up the street. Great place to sit and eat Korean food and have some soju :)",

Here's a secret, if you go between 2-4, you get a quiet setting and maybe if you go between 3-4, or around dinner, you get K-POP playing. It's awesome.   It's really affordable. I'm a college student , that means, almost broke and wishes to only get good but cheap food. If you are looking for a fancy high end food, well go somewhere else.   This place is the best place for like: -bibimbap -bentous -beef!!!!!! -naengmyun -udon -FISHCAKE!!!!!!!!   What I love the most are the lunch boxes. I'm going to tell you right now, the best deals are before 3. I'm giving you an hour buffer zone because iono if they actually stop serving lunch at 4 or 3. I always get the same thing, BULGOGI LUNCH BOX. Two weeks ago, I went to this place like three times in a row. KEKEKEKE.   About the service, they never fail me. I drink tea like it's water so I'm always asking them to refill my tea so much. :p THE TEA IS REALLY GOOD. Unless you are allergic to rice, you will love it.   If you are looking for a recommendation, I suggest: -hamburger steak -bulgogi lunch box -bibimbap  I love the dessert: PATBINGOSOO. It's huge, YOU HAVE TO SHARE. It's really good patbingsoo. I haven't had a whole lot of experience eating this delicious creation but I have tried YakiniQ Cafe's and I like Arang's better.   If you don't have time to sit down and relax in this small restaurant, then take it to go. They are the friendliest people I have ever seen. They are really nice too. I am a waitress and I learn half of my skill from them.   I love this place so much that I recommend this place to everyone, even my own customers.",

But starting off with the food, my friend and I split the Kimchi Fried rice, and the Spicy Tofu Soup. The tofu soup was delicious, so was the kimchi fried rice but I wasn't a fan of the corn bits in the rice. You get of course as with any other korean mean, ban chan. I usually love the ban chan korean restaurants have to offer but this place was alright. The jap chae I tried from my friends dinner box was disappointing. It was mushy and didn't taste like how jap chae should taste. But I would say for the price, they offer pretty big portions.   As for their soju, I think it was $9-$10 for a bottle of plain soju which is I guess normal with most places. HOWEVER! I would not order the flavored soju again. They sell it by the \"pitcher,\" which in my mind, I was thinking of your average water pitcher. No, it's not, it's about half. Which I wouldn't have minded so much if it didn't cost $25? It was either $25, or $25+ And also, they don't have the price written up for how much it costs, maybe the menu did, I don't quite remember. But $25?!?!?! Really!?!? I can get 2 bottles of it somewhere else.   All in all, if you're coming for food, this place is pretty good. If you came to drink, I'd say go somewhere else. So 3.5 stars for me. =]",

The food was just ok for me, but I think that was mainly because I ordered the wrong item. \u00a0My friends ordered the galbi and they demolished it. \u00a0While I got the spicy pork bulgogi. \u00a0The meat seemed to have too much fat for my taste. \u00a0I don't know if that's supposed to be common, but most Korean restaurants where I've had it, that wasn't the case. \u00a0  Overall it was a good experience and I'll be coming back, partially because it's only a few blocks away, but also because I want to give it another shot.",

Walking in, you'll notice that the crowd is wrinkle-free and I was hit with a realization that I'm no longer a youngin, especially with the cheery K-pop music in the background.  Tea was served immediately upon request. \u00a0The menu offers more choices than Won Mi. You can get ramen here if you want or a box dinner (aka Bento Box) for $8.95. \u00a0I imagine this place is super popular for lunch as the lunch specials start around $6.  We imbibed on a yougurt soju, a small carafe is $12. It's pleasantly sweet, definitely a girly drink. Soon after, our huge Korean seafood pancake ($9.95) came. \u00a0It's bland if you don't dip it in the soy-vinegar chili sauce. Also, it was a tad bit oily and wish it was more crunchier.  I ordered my usual Man du Gook ($8.95) which is a dumpling soup with green onions and egg. What a disappointment. The dumplings were already falling apart after moving it around in my bowl.   The box dinner was a wise choice since heaping mounds of everything were devoured in minutes: \u00a0tender teriyaki beef, steamed white rice and simple iceberg lettuce salad.   Arang definitely scores points because it has more choices and noticeably lower prices than the other 2 Korean restos in the area. \u00a0However, it loses points with me because there are no banchans served for late night eats!",

I digress...  This restaurant is good place to venture if you're looking for a quick fix for a Korean craving. \u00a0When we walked in around 7 pm, it was relatively empty but within minutes, plenty of other people streamed in and filled up the tables around us. \u00a0  I wasn't starved, so I ordered the spicy tofu soup. It was boiling hot and filled to the brim with tons of silken tofu. \u00a0I was a little surprised by the cooked egg smack dab in the middle. \u00a0A few pieces of clam floated around and I think there were some straggling strips of beef as well. I enjoyed the flavor...could have been a tad bit spicier. I asked for medium, next time, I'll ask them to step it up a bit.   My friend ordered up the BBQ beef combo plate, which was a great value for the moola. \u00a0The BBQ was well seasoned, a little sweet and salty all at the same time. \u00a0It came with shreds of potatoes, mung bean noodles, a side salad, and rice.

(Its has a bright red color, it almost looks like sauce with mussels, clams, some meat and tofu) We always get a new dish we haven't tried with each visit. Last week we got squid on skewers.

I've been to many Korean restaurants and this one definitely compares well with others I've been to in the past. A good indication that this restaurant is authentic is that there were a good amount of Korean people eating here too. This restaurant is in a good location (right by Japantown) and there's a parking lot in the back.  -Beef Short Ribs Box (Dinner) - $10.95 (Meat was very juicy. The marinade was delicious! The box came with salad, soup, gyozas, noodles, and rice. For this much food, the price is definitely good for this dish. Highly recommend trying this item.)  -Soft Tofu Stew (Dinner) - $8.95 (The mild is still somewhat spicy but the broth was delicious. There were a good amount of clam meat and beef in the broth too.)  We wanted to order the Seafood Scallion Pancake too because it looked so good, but we decided not to since it would be way too much food.

Reason why is that its serve good food! lol like my buddy mark said on his review \"two of my friends usually get the OB beer along with their dish so they really enjoy this place\" which is true haha..   well lemme break it down on pricing, service, and food quality.  The pricing is kinda on the high end side. the plate that my friend and I away gets runs about 15 bucks each for a small plate of beef and pork. \u00a0They change per bowl of rice now... which they didn't do before. \u00a0Most plates cost about 10 bucks or more.  The service is OK i guess well on a slow night its excellent!! but when its busy they don't really have a waiting list. They tend to find a table for the amount of people and whatever goes. Also they expect a heavy tip, the 15% rule or some crap. which I believe is BS tip should be the way the customer feels on how good is the food/service.  Food quality! good,tasty, filling should i say anything more?  over all good food ok service = happy me lol",

The place can get pretty crowded during peak times but they are open pretty late which is nice because thats when I always crave it. They do take reservations though so take advantage of that because the restaurant itself is on the smaller side. The bento boxes are a great deal but you won't get banchan if you order one. So just make sure someone else in your group orders something else. They don't have a problem refilling the banchan if you ask nicely. The a la carte bbq are always tasty (the spicy pork is my favorite). The casseroles are super filling and can feed 3 easily and the still give you a bowl of rice on the side! I like the spam and sausage one. It comes with kimchi, rice cakes, ramen, and an assortnent of veggies on top. You let it cook down over the little stove they bring to the table and then help yourself. Service is attentive, the food is delicious and prices are fair. Plus you can park in the Safeway parking lot!",

The bulgogi was a little on the greasy side but the flavor was nice. The tofu soup was good with meat and clams and I personally did not mind the spicy flavor.

Came here for a late dinner with a friend after lion dance practice. We were looking to go to Jtown for food, but the parking sucked so we parked in the plaza with a Safeway in it and walked on over.   The service was quick and we were seated in less than a minute. For a Friday night, this place was packed with people and you could hear the latest kpop music in the background. I'd recommend this place for couples and for small groups of friends. Having a large group here, you may just take up the whole restaurant.   Alright, the food. My friend ordered the Chicken galbi bento box and I had the Bulgogi box. It came with a decent amount of lettuce with thousand island dressing, two pieces of gyoza, a small mound of japchae (silver noodles marinated in sesame sauce) and fermented potatoes. It was enough to fill us up while we were there.   From the time we sat down to the time we left, the staff refilled our tea when it went down to half full. Unfortunately, we didn't order any alcohol that night. Observing some of the other tables, it looks like the lemon or yogurt soju were the most popular. As we were leaving, these two guys ordered a few pitchers of it. That will be something I will try next time!   The only thing that I am giving one less star on is for the tea. Barley tea with toasted rice krispies tastes alright, but it tasted like there was some dish soap in it. My friend noticed it too, but its not that important.

Maybe they should change the name to kimchee tossed rice. \u00a0It had corn, spam, kimchee and huge chunks of semi-raw onions.

I would think this is palatable ONLY if in a drunken stupor when anything would taste good, if at that. I mean, how hard is it to make fried rice?!  We also got the spicy beef vermicelli soup...which came ages later, after inquiring about it halfway thru our meal. The soup base was standard, but where are my noodles?!

I've never had bad service at Arang, and never had much f a bad experience. This place ALWAYS has customers when I go. I go there for lunch a lot because it's so close to work, and lunch hours seem to be verrrrrrry busy. The taste of food is just mediocre, but nothing really to complain about (considering I don't really think any places in SF are outstanding). The choices for food are numerous and cover a variety of different categories (soups/broths, noodles, rice plates, meat, lunch boxes, etc.). The reason for 4 stars? the fact that I've been here countless times since I was a kid and have yet to have a bad experience.",

The place was pretty tiny but they seated the nine of us accordingly in a timely fashion. The service wasn't bad at all, they took our orders &amp; we got our food pretty quickly. The waitress checked up on us every now &amp; then &amp; refilled our waters.   One of the best parts of Korean cuisine that I love are the complimentary appetizers. I was snacking on them so much that I barely ate my actual food. I got a bento box which consisted of pot-stickers, a salad, pickled veggies, rice, &amp; Korean spare ribs. It was good but nothing to rave about. It filled me up but I can't see myself craving this.   The thing that made this experience less favorable was the fact that two of the three cars that we parked in the parking lot near the restaurant got towed. Its apparently Safeway's parking lot but this plaza consisted of other restaurants &amp; stores that you'd think would share the lot. So be careful where you park!",

I first heard about it from a coworker and I love the fact that they put spam and corn in the kim chee friend rice. It's also cheap! for the lunch special, i believe its only $6.50, maybe a little more. they have other lunch specials that are also cheap. The bento lunch boxes come with rice, soup, salad, yam noodles, choice of entree, and pot sticker. Its a lot of food for $6.50-$7. It's not my top choice Korean restaurant, but I would definitely come back whenever I work and would like a cheap lunch.",

I first ate at \u00a0Arang \u00a0a few months ago and the food was very good, but tonight's dinner was even better.  I had the salmon teriyaki, a Japanese dish, but prepared beautifully at this Korean restaurant. The salmon portion was huge and cooked perfectly. The teriyaki flavoring was subtle so the flavor of the salmon was prominent. I don't think I've ever had salmont teriyaki this good. Not one bone in the beautiful fillet.  If you're a salmon-eater (as I am) you MUST \u00a0enjoy the salmon at Arang.  Other foods were excellent, too, as was the friendly and efficient service.  In my opinion, Arang is a gem if you like Korean, other Asian, or just superior food in general.",

I couldn't decide want I wanted to eat. I haven't had kalbi tang in a while but I'm a total fire junky so I gotta have my spicy food. I ended up deciding that I needed more variety in my life, so I went for the kalbi tang, which wasn't bad at all. No complaints really. The broth had a nice flavor, this soup makes me all nice and tingly inside. I usually love having this stuff after snowboarding or on a rainy day, and slurp up the vermicelli noodles and be a cave man and chew on my huge honkin piece of rib.  But what I couldn't believe is that my friend ordered soon du bu and the waiter asked how spicy. He said, as spicy as you can get it. In all seriousness, please try to kill me kind of spicy. b/c we all know my Japanese friend todd, LOVES his spicy, maybe even more than me.   My other friend ordered ra-pok-ki (ramyun and dukkpoki) no specific level of spiciness, but when the food came out, the tofu soup and the duk po ki, tasted exactly the same. I WAS SOOOO DISAPPOINTED, maybe a little embarrassed for my people. You have no idea how excited I was for them to just deliever this crazy spicy concoction, and it wasn't spicy AT ALL.   There was no tingle in my mouth. I'm not exaggerating at all. I didn't know where all the red was coming from, b/c the thing was SO RED, but SOOO NOT SPICY.   Sigh.... I can't go on, I'm so sad. My people are supposed to be the masters of spicy. -_-  If you don't plan on making it spicy, why even bother asking how spicy?  will i come back? heck no, there are way better korean places in the city.",

Maybe I DO have a couple of years before I officially become 'Cougar Status'!\"  Last night's dinner at Arang was like a trip down memory lane for me. In the early 2000s, this was the \"spot\" to come for underage drinking before/after karaoke. Past forward 10 years, it's good to know that they NOW check IDs b/c I absolutely do NOT condone underage drinking *eyes staring at the ceiling*.   My friends and I came to here at about 9:30 PM for a post-movie dinner/drinking. A table of four had just left, so we were promptly seated.  FOOD/DRINKS: *Peach Soju (Pitcher - $24): It was ok. We used this to chase down the Chamisul. \u00a0The peach taste came from peach syrup from a can and not juice as it was a bit syrupy, sweet, and an odd yellow/orange color. If you like fruit sojus made w/ real fruit juice, check out the \"The Spot\" or \"Toyose\" in the Sunset.   *Yogurt Soju (Small - $6): Better than the peach soju. It was creamy, sweet, and tart with a slight hint of alki flavor.   *Chamisul (375 ml - $9.95): It was GOOD! The filtered sake was clean and refreshing.   *Soondubuchigae (Tofu Soup - $8.95): I didn't have any, so I can't account for the taste.  *Tteokbokki (Korean Rice Sticks -$9.95): Meh! The cylinder rice sticks were boiled and then stir-fried in gochujang (chili and fermented soybean) sauce. Because the rice sticks are very glutinous and wasn't cooked thoroughly, it was like chewing on stale gum.   *Kalbi (BBQ Beef Shortribs - $16.95): YUMMY! The short ribs were perfectly cooked and were fatty, tender, and very flavorful from the soy, ginger, garlic, brown sugar, and sesame marinade.   *Stir-fried Soon-dae (Korean Sausage - $12.95): Eck! This looked nothing as pictured on the menu nor on Yelp which displayed slices of fried sausages. What we received was sausages mixed with jap chae (vermicilli) and gochujang. Soon-dae is made of pig's intestines and stuffed with a mixture of pig's blood, rice, green onions, garlic, minced pork, and vermicelli. It's definitely an acquired taste. Because it's steamed first, it's has a mushy texture and an irony after taste. The jap chae was overcooked and soaking in the gochujang sauce.   *Spam and Sausage Jeongol (Casserole - $22.95): YUMMY! Essentially, you get a big pot of kimchee soup filled with sliced rice cakes, kimchee, SPAM, hotdogs (not the soon-dae), green onions, topped with a block of raw ramen. After letting everything simmer on your table for 5 minutes, mix everything and you have a stew-like concoction. If you like kimchee tofu soup, ramen, and most importantly SPAM, you will LOVE this dish! The soup was rich, savory, and super spicy. And, the other ingredients depend on the cooking time, cook it shorter if you want al-dene ramen and rice cakes and longer if not.   *Kimchee Fried Rice ($7.95): YUMMY! Spicy al-dente rice w/ cubes of spam and an egg over easy with a runny yolk....may I need to say more? I don't think so...  *Bingsu (Korean Shaved Ice - $4.95): YUMMY! The shaved ice is topped with vanilla ice cream, red beans, bananas AND cinnamon toast crunch! It's basically a Korean version of Halo-halo. It's had a good combo of texture combos: cold, creamy, rich, sweet, and crunchy. This is a definite MUST order to cool down your tongue after devouring all the spicy dishes!  SERVICE:  For an Asian restaurant, I thought it was pretty damn good. The waitress was very nice and friendly. She took our orders promptly, we got ALL of our food within 15 minutes, and she came to check on us every so often.  AMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: Hasn't changed a bit from the last time I went in 2001. They still have the same neon sign inside and out, bamboo plants, and hanging bubble lights. The dining area to the left has 4 tables that sits 4 people each and there's 3-4 booths on the right side that sits 4 people each.   PARKING: Arang is conveniently located in The Fillmore Shopping Plaza (Safeway, Popeyes) across from Panda Express and next to Subway, so you can park in the lot.   Although some of their items were a Hit OR Miss, Arang's pricing and service has an edge over other Korean restaurant; e.g. Won Mi charges $25.95 for Kalbi while Arang charges just $16.95. So, if you're having a late night craving for Korean Food (closes at 2 AM everyday) and don't feel like dropping $$$, Arang is definitely a place to check out esp for their bento boxes under $10 which comes with a meat of your choice, jap chae, gyoza, rice, and salad!",

They don't give a lot of side dishes, don't bother refilling your tea, but their food is always consistently good and they have combo dinners, which I like. This place is on the small side though so if you're trying to come here on a busy night, well, don't. But if you're there and they actually have seats, pop in to try it. I'm sure you at least think it's ok.   By the way, DO NOT PARK AT THE SAFEWAY LOT. Back in the day that's what we all used to do when we were in the area (and not shopping at Safeway) and it was perfectly fine, but a few years ago they really started cracking down on people who are using their lot, and they TOW YOUR CAR after an hour or something. So if you're new to the area just keep that in mind, don't park there. Trust me. Your ass will get towed.",

I was introduced to this place years back in my clubbing days from one my good guy friends. \u00a0We used to roll up in this place 15 deep if not more after the club or goin out and we would take up that whole corner section by the mirrors..lol...those days!  Its always a good time goin to this place. \u00a0Except maybe one time on a first date and the alcohol couldnt help me that night to get thru it...lol. \u00a0But every time i bring in a new person they love it and they go there w/o tellin me..u A$$es!! \u00a0This place can be fun especial the people who eat there Ive meet some of the coolest folks around. Some are even cool enough to let u try some of their dishes they are eating if u ask nice enough what they are eating.  But the food is good no matter what u order. Especially the pot stickers...hahaha we always have to order our own cuz no one wants to share...lol! The fried glass noodles are also very good.  The place is open pretty late. I think they close like 2 but they never seem to kick anyone out even thou its passed that. The music inside is pretty interesting. \u00a0Techno asian ...lol...not sure what u call it but for sure I feel like speed racing after being there. The parking is in the safeway shopping area complex. Its gotten strict they only allow 2 hour parking in the lot and they start towing and for reals there are tow trucks in the lot waiting. \u00a0I guess people be partying a lil too much there and leaving theirs cars...lol...i dnt...  Two solid key items to order the Pot stickers and the Peach Soju = a good nite. Plus I love their potato salad and the brown rice tea that comes with toasted popcorn on top..lol its the lil things!!!",

It has plenty of parking in the lot at Safeway (I usually come at night so I'm assuming it's safe...) and the food really hits the spot for me. I've been here like 3-5 times already and it has definitely been good practically every time.  My first time here I got the udon for lunch with some friends because I was not feeling korean food at the time haha, stupid me. It wasn't terribly yummy and I didn't want to come back especially in such a cramped space and it's not so ideal location haha. (That door is so heavy!)  Then I came back with another group of friends and had the real experience, bibimbap!!!! And I went a bit further and got the kimchi bibimbap! Oh man, that was satisfying for a cold day in sf, but when is it ever hot? And the appetizers/starting plate thing were yummers too. Too bad I had to keep asking for it to be refilled.  Then I had a strange craving for soondubu and I got it. Very satisfying once again, different appetizer/plate thingy that has random foods.  And it repeats like so with me leaving happy and filled. It's a bit pricey for the food probably considering the ingredients that go in there, but it's so damn good :)   Try try try, kimchi bibimbap :))))",

    "review_text": "Got taken here for my first time a few months back. Couple weeks later, I took my gf. And most recently, maybe 3-4weeks ago. And usually it's late at night (after 10 or 11p.m.) because really, when we can't think of places to go, it's Arang to the rescue.  The first time was great. We had kimchi fried race, a plate of the chewy rice noodles, and a plate of bulgogi. I had never had the chewy stuff before so it took a while getting used to the extra chews I had to take before swallowing, but it was pretty good after that. Some of you might find it very different from \"regular\" textured food, so be careful.  The second time, I had the tofu soup and my gf had the bento box. The soup was okay, I've had better. The tofu had a good consistency (I think...). Bento box, eh..I never really bother with buying these anywhere. It's just the default item you choose when you can't make up your mind.  The most recent time I go the mackerel. I had eaten some a week or two before it and was just craving some more, so I ordered it. It came out EXTREMELY OILY! be forewarned..each bite of it and I could feel the oil oozing from the fish. I had to grab 2 napkins to pad that sucker down before it was safe to eat, haha. But once I did that, it was pretty good.  Overall, 4 stars. Food is pretty decent, parking is widely available with the huge lot right there for Safeway. Then again, I've always been there late at night with no one around, so I can't say during the day. Service is shoddy..the ladies don't come by often enough, so I feel you guys about the water refills. Maybe the ladies are so tired by the time I get there? haha But really, I don't expect great service when I go to Asian restaurants. Growing up in Vietnamese in San Jose and going to all the Viet restaurants has set my standards a little lower than the norm :P",

This place is a little cheaper than some other Korean restaurants in Japantown.  This place is small so it's not ideal for parties more than 4 or 6. Every time I went, it was pretty busy so be prepared for a little wait. I like how at night, they play Korean music (largely K-Pop) and during the day they play American music, just so you know~. lol  They give you relatievly the same type of banchan every time. Tofu, eggs, kimchi, bean sprouts, seaweed, etc. The pig feet is great! Get it if you want to try something different. Don't worry, they slice it for you! I didn't like the lamb in the hot pot (for 2 or more) because I hate the way it smells (personal preference). The beef hot pot was like an army stew thing if you know what I mean. If not, please Google it. Didn't give a lot of japchae and my god, that stuff's soooo goooodddd!!!! Bibimnaengmyeon was great as well. ! Even my cousin who sucks at eat spicy foods couldn't get enough of it! \u00a0I think pretty much everything is freaking awesome. Haven't tried their sundubu yet though. Their (dol sot) kimchi bibimbap (forgot the shorter version) was great but it was the first time I had it so nothing to compare it to. They do give a lot for bibimbaps.   Basically can't go wrong with any menu items but I do wish they had a larger menu for soups and the like. They even have soju cocktails but I can't drink those since I'm not yet of age. =(",

Perfect amount of spiciness! and the seafood pancake.. my only complaint... where's the seafood... the only seafood inside was the squid! why not just call it SQUID PANCAKE! UGH!   Parking was super easy, but i just wish it was in a better neighborhood.. but whatever! not as bad as the TL. Service was great... i don't know what everyone was talking about.. it's like any other asian restaurant... you just got to flag em down!   Oh i forgot.... they have discounted alcohol! the beer and soju was crazy cheap compared to any other korean restaurant! WOOT crazy! I'll be back tomorrow!",

I especially love their lunch&amp;diner box special menu which is cheap and enough for one or even two persons. For dinner, I usually get a plate of seafood pancake, beef short lib, and assorted soup(it's called Budae-Jigae) to share with friends. So delicious that I had to come back a week later!!  The side dishes they serve are awesome. My favorites are a Kimchi, potato salad, and pink radish which is called Chayote(?). They are even refilled as much as you want forever!!! :)  It opens late till 2 AM!! Good thing for me and friends to enjoy late night with foods and drinks after midnight.   One more good thing is that you don't have to waste time to park your car. It is nearby Safeway so that you can park your car at Safeway parking lots which are available at anytime.   The food quality is excellent and the staff is super attentive and friendly. For sure coming back!!! :)",

We ordered the spicy fried chicken, kalbi bento box, and one of the spicy soups (sorry, I can't remember the name but it's in a red broth). Out of those 3 things, the only thing I would get again is the bento box because it was a really good deal for the price. This is definitely a fast, quick, and easy place to get some Korean food.

I find this place rather cheap in terms of price, comparing it to the other Korean restaurants in San Francisco.

The salad was pretty good . It was lettuce with some kind of white dressing . I really liked the dressing . It was really watery but I like how it wasn't too salty &amp; overpowering . The dressing had a light flavorful taste . The noodles w/ strips of potatoes were fantastic ! The strips potatoes were cut perfectly the right size and it went really well with the noodles .. very yummy . I tried some of my friend's chicken katsu it was pretty good too . My friend thinks I'm crazy but I could actually taste the difference between the chicken katsu &amp; the ton katsu . The chicken in the chicken katsu tastes more thick while the pork in the ton katsu is not as thick and tastes more smooth . I ordered a dish of spicy rice cake which was alright but kind of too sweet . My friend agreed . It wasn't really that spicy either . Their dessert (they only have one) was good , but kind of dumb &amp; a rip off . It was basically just a lot of shaved ice , some sweet milk , some Cinnamon Toast Crunch , red bean and pieces of fruits . I LOVE their homemade tea .. it's great . Idk what kind of tea it is but it has brown rice in it which I think is kind of cool . The service was very good too . The waitress kept refilling our teacups every time it was empty without us telling her to =) I will probably be back . I really recommend getting one of their box combo thingys .",

My judgments are for the kalgooksoo and soondubu and in tandem, the whole restaurant:  So, I ordered kal gooksoo. It wasn't disgusting, but it tasted like NOTHING. Even when I added the gochujang to give it some flavor, the soup was just bland. I felt like the waiter had lied when he said he eats it a lot and finds it tasty.   Look, I am not used to mediocre Korean food. I don't think Korean food can be mediocre. I think it can only be good or bad. And I've only experienced BAD Korean food once in my life, which I've swiftly extricated from my memory to the point that I don't even remember the name of that restaurant.  Something about bad Korean food deeply offends me in a way that other bad food cannot. I can handle cheap macaroni, cheap chips, cheap fries, cheap cookies, etc. Korean food is intricate, so when it's bad, it sinks below AWFUL. Keep in mind that bad Korean food is not like bad pizza, which is still edible. Bad pizza gets away with being bad. Bad Korean food is UNACCEPTABLE and makes me really angry. Maybe it's because I'm Korean and I've been lavished with authentic quality Korean food both at home and in the motherland, but I have zero tolerance for bad Korean food.   Back to the story. I couldn't continue eating the kalgooksoo and asked the nice waiter for a replacement. He told me to opt for the soon dubu, which \"everyone likes, including the foreigners.\" The last critics I want of Korean food would be foreigners or Americans, sorry. I want to know what an actual Korean would think of this dish, I told him. He assured me it's good and sped to make up for the shitty kalgooksoo.  The soondubu was only slightly better than the kalgooksoo because of the spiciness, which distracted my tongue. It was still watered down, and the worst soondubu I've eaten in my life. I'm not exaggerating by saying the worst.  I left this restaurant feeling like I'd been cheated not just out of my money, but out of my hunger, if that makes sense. I was no longer hungry because I'd tried eating as much as I could out of the money I just lost, but I was still deprived of being floored from good food.  I know this is a take out spot, so it's not like I was expecting the best, but based on these two dishes alone, I give this place its deserving sole star. I don't ever want to go through this disrespectful experience again.   Anyone who says this place has \"decent\" food must not know what good Korean food is. What a shame.",

Ironically what I love about Korean food is the appetizers. They give out a tray of regular kim chee, cucumber, fish cakes, etc.  I ate here today and I really loved the service, My friend and I came in waiting for one more person to come in, and the server let us sit there and take our time waiting and ordering. By the time our other friend came in we ordered and didn`t have to wait long. We took our time, ate, and was very satisfied, Today was one of the best days I`ve gone so far.  When I visited here before I remember how inattentive the servers actually were, some took a while to respond (probably depending on who it is, because the one who helped me today came by my table a lot) &amp; sometimes the appetizers came late or not at all.. :|  Also to add on, the restaurant itself is tiny itself.. don`t come in huge groups over 4+ people. They have a bunch of tiny tables that can fit 2 people on one, 3 tables that can fit at least 4-5 people on it, and 3-4 bar seats.. that`s all.",

I was told that It is right across from the panda express but there are two faces of panda express. So I went to the wrong side first. Arang is in the corner, if you will, with two korean symbols glowing in neon, but, if you look inside there will be a sign that says Arang on the wall :]  The place was pretty small, but comfortable. Waitresses were very polite and greeted us in Korean(which I love). We got seated and they served us the tea and menus. The tea had some kind of rice in it which I thought was pretty cool. It looked like hamster poo at first tho but..it wasn't, don't worry.   Their menu has a very big variety of choices but, I eventually ordered a BBQ Beef bento box-ish deal which came with BBQ Beef ,two Gyoza(potsticker), Salad, Miso Soup, Shredded Potatoes(very good), a scoop of rice, and Vermicelli noodles. (TIP: You have a choice between getting a box or plate. Box includes all that I listed above but plate gives you more of the meat that you order with rice but excluding all that I listed earlier and plate is more expensive. I thought the box gave me plenty of meat anyway.) The meat was very tender and flavorful, but I really enjoyed the shredded potato salad thing.   Arang is very authentic Korean. It is refreshing to see a Korean restaurant owned by and has Korean. My experience is better that way since I came for Korean food. You should try this place out!!  OH btw when you receive the bill they give you a handful of bangin Melon Gum. It tastes like Hi-Chew but you can't swallow it hahaha",

Usually we come a bit early to beat the crowd, otherwise we end up sitting around and waiting for a good 15-20 minutes and then I end up a starving child -sad face-. When they get busy, they tend to ignore you even when you're trying your hardest to get their attention. So minus one star. But they are a really great place to have late night Korean food. Here's what we typically order: Man Du Gook - korean dumpling soup with vegetables and beef.  Fried Gyoza - fried potstickers (Mark's favorite dish always lol.) Ramen - spicy korean ramen with vegetables and seafood  And sometimes we randomly order things that catch our eyes.. try not to stay with the same stuff every time lol. I have the say that I LOVE Man Du Gook a lot, I have to order this every time I go, its a comfort food for me. Try it out -smile-",

One day I returned after not eating here for like a couple of months...and UGH I was disgusted.  I always order the usual, a pick of a bento + a pick of either the seafood or beef bibimbap + soju ofcourse!  Ordered me a Spicy Pork Bento + Seafood Bi Bim Bap + Peach Soju. \u00a0How can you go wrong?  Ugh yea... it can go wrong when:  Booboo #1. The spicy pork was freaking BACON cooked in a watery spicy sauce! I normally LOVE bacon, but this was not no crispy bacon, so trust me I know my cut of pork! \u00a0Each piece of pork I picked up was HALF FAT.  Booboo #2. Yea I know I ordered the Seafood BiBimBap..but wussup with the FISHY stank smell?!? \u00a0 I put EXTRA of that spicy sauce to try to \"fix\" this, and yet NOTHING could have saved that. \u00a0  Booboo #3. Me and Soju has always had a love hate relationship, its always love love love you, until the next morning when I find myself passed out in front of my door, missing one shoe, and with a pounding headache. The problem here is that....my freaking Peach SOJU had practically NO SOJU in it! It tasted good (overly sweet), but now I know its cus they didnt add enough Soju!  Booboo #4. I walked out unsatisfied, and SOBER! Had so much leftovers, but didn't want to take it to go, cus it was just plain BOOBOO. And we knew we was just going to throw it away. \u00a0  Old Arang, you will always have a place in my heart! But the current Arang needs step it up!",

Soon Dobu is good here, but some of the other items I've tried are just okay. I do like their ban chan here - only a few selections but they're always tasty and I like how they present it on one plate with separate compartments. Easier to move around/refill and less clutter.   Just like another Yelper mentioned, the tea here is yummy! One of my favorite teas at a Korean restaurant.  Service is okay here - usually sort of aloof and they don't talk to you much.

It was very yummy and it was definitely spicy. I've had kimchi at other Korean restaurants and sometimes the kimchi ain't spicy.. It's like, \"What? o_O\" Why are you not spicy? Why are you so sour? Why are you salty?\" Anyway. Haha  It came pretty quickly after ordering. It was nicely portioned with the right amount of rice, veggies and all that goodness. The only weird thing about it is that they put the sauce/flavoring on it, for me.. Instead of having me do it myself..?  The rest of my party ordered their.. K-Japanese style bento boxes (which looked pretty tasty) and another ordered the Seafood BiBimBap. That too, already had the sauce on it. o__o\" But it was tasty, nonetheless, they didn't skimp on the seafood. It was a bit more watery than my kimchi still pretty spicy and all that good stuff.

    "review_text": "I decided to try this place because we were driving back to SF from Lake Tahoe and got back into the city before 11pm and it was still open. Otherwise the only other option would have been Won Mi which would have been more than fine. Wow... in hindsight that was big mistake to eat here.   First of all, when we stepped into the restaurant we were told to wait 15 minutes, even though there were at least 10 open tables and the whole restaurant holds maybe 20 tables in total. Then I realized it must because they were understaffed, so we sort of shifted our way towards a booth and sat down in one that still hadn't been cleaned yet, and watched some basketball being played on the big screen TV. At this point, while sitting around in a dirty booth we also became aware that everyone who was sitting down around us was drinking and playing drinking games at their table, with food being ordered as well, but not as the focus. We also started feeling very cold, perhaps it was the hunger and the long drive, but then the high ceilings, corner location facing wind, and lack of heat in the restaurant were very apparent. By the time I walked back to my car to get everyone's ski jacket the table had finally been cleaned and we ordered a few dishes with no alcohol.   They did not even have the normal BBQ chicken that I usually order but some Asian fusion orange chicken hybrid, Kalbi, and seafood pancake so we ordered that. The food finally came out some time later, and everything was totally forgettable... the chicken tasted a bit strange, sort of like a grilled version of something I would expect to find at Panda Express. The Kalbi was cut LA style which always reminds me of a lunchtime rice plate rather than a dinner style cut, and the seafood pancake was overfried and dripping with excess oil.   We ate our meal in silence with regret that we had rushed back only to have NOT eaten at Won Mi across the street. Well, let's just say I won't ever be making that mistake again when faced with these 2 choices. In my mind Arang is more like a bar you can come to enjoy some big screen TV action and drinking games with your friends, just don't come for the food.",

I was pleasantly surprised by the dukboggi, it was pretty tasty and had some fire in it. The bulgogi was average, quantity was meager for the price we paid. The fish egg stew was spicyyyyy.... The highlight of the night was the chol myhon. Very good and chewy. Just enough kick that didn't overpower the rest of the dish.",

The place offer orders more on a single person dinner then large parties like many other Korean restaurant.   You can get a Bento box \"Arang combination sub for BBQ short ribs\" and have almost everything you would want for dinner. At a typically, Korean restaurant you would have to order 1 dish which could be up to 20 bucks which comes with bunch of smaller side dishes.  At Arange you get a bento box and have a more personalized dinner for smaller parties with out the hefty prices.  The place is small and open late at night thats always a plus after a long night out dancing.  The only negative thing would be service. I always feel that they give better service to Koreans then all other guest. It like they are a bit for favorable to their own nationality.  For instance when order anything they should bring out the side dishes for you regardless if you asked or not. However, they only bring it for Koreans without asking.  Make sure you ask for the side dishes. That just part of the Korean food experience.",

Ever ask a waitress or waiter for their opinion and they really aren't helpful at all? \u00a0Yeah.  \"So, between the bibimbap, kimchee fried rice and yookgaejang, which one do you recommend?\" \"Ummmm... do you like seafood?\" \"No, I'm allergic to a lot of seafood.\" \"Oh. \u00a0Well. \u00a0The seafood soon tofu is good.\" \"Thanks, but no, I'd rather have something else.\" \"Well, everything is actually good.\" \"Can you please just pick one that you would get?\" *Points to bibimbap*  Boom done.  And it was really good - thank you, waitress. \u00a0I don't know if the regular eat-in portion is bigger than my to-go one, but it was definitely enough food for me. \u00a0I wish I had time to dine there, because it's one of those hot stone ones, and by the time I finished my food, it was already cold. \u00a0Sigh.  My coworker swears by this place, and I just might too. \u00a0Definitely a good lunch pick, as it's 20 feet away from my other office. \u00a0What a trek.",

So if you want spicy, but not too spicy, ask them to go lite on the spicy ness. My friend got the deokbokki with ramen. When tht dish came, I was shocked by how big her plate was and how yummy it looked!!! They also serve bento boxes and miso with any rice dishes.  Their water tastes BAD. So bring your own water or order a beverage.  The music played there was nice, some oldies and some new . It just lightened up my mood!   I love yellow radish, so I asked for a side order of it and it came right away! Usually korean restaurants charge us for asking for extra so I was very pleased with that.  Unlike other Korean restaurants that Ive been to, this was the first to have omelettes!!! Although I did not get to try it, Id try it if I ever come back.",

The potstickers (also included with the lunch entree) tasted like they were frozen and microwaved right before serving. The vermicelli glass noodles (chap chae?) were dry and didn't have much flavor. The bi bim bap did look good, but the ton katsu was run of the mill. Of course you also get your typical lettuce with Thousand Island as your salad.   So bottom line...the food ain't all that.

A couple of years ago, I went there for my friend's birthday. After we paid, we were gathering in front of the restaurant to decide where to go afterwards. A few minutes later, one of the waitresses came out and demanded for more tips. We gave 10% because their service wasn't that stellar. We had to wait over an hour to be seated and they never once came by to our table after the food came out. 10% tips were more than generous. My friend ended up giving them extra tips because he didn't want to make a fuss about it and ruined our friend's birthday.  I never intended to go back there, but after circling around Geary for parking last week, my friends and I gave up on eating around Geary. We went to Arang again because they have the convenience of parking. This time, they didn't even ask us whether we wanted anything to drink. We had to specifically ask for tea. They brought a small cup of tea for each of us. However, once we requested for a refill, they completely ignored us. They refilled the tea for the tables in front of us and behind us, but did not come by to our table. On top of that, they brought out the wrong order, of which they refused to take back.

The service was slow and there was just one other table that was being served. The restaurant was really warm and there was just no circulation going on in there.

I requested a glass of water three times before actually receiving it. We ordered what was like a Kimchi hotpot and some fried chicken. The hotpot came very quickly. It was filled with Kimchi stew mixed with some random processed meat like spam and hotdogs, and a hint of ground pork, and some packaged ramen noodles topped with some refried beans. It wasn't very appetizing to look at or taste. It was the most bland Kimchi stew base I've ever tasted, and they weren't even generous with the \"meat.\" It took a while for our fried chicken to come, and when it did it looked very.... well, it looked like they fried it while it was still frozen.
