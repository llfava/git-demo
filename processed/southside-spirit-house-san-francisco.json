During the event, the food came out piping hot throughout the first half of our 3 hour event. Late comers didn't have to settle for cold food. \u00a0All the food was delicious!!! \u00a0I had been here before just for drinks and thought the food other people ordered looked great. \u00a0So I was relying on my \"foodie\" instincts and hoped the food would taste as good as they sounded. \u00a0Flat bread doesn't sound like fancy party food, but SSH made them with upscale ingredients that are super tasty and elevated them to party food status. \u00a0Our waitress was \"on it\" when getting everyone's drinks. \u00a0When I checked with a new arrival about flagging our waitress to take their order, she had already gotten it!

It was a little quiet at first but quickly filled up (and for good reason!).  Impressive beer list with beers like Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA, Stone Arrogant Bastard and Hitachino Nest on tap. On top of beers, I tried the Vieux Kinner (Rye, Cognac, Fernet, Vermouth) which I enjoyed a lot. I tasted some of the other cocktails ordered by friends and those were pretty good as well.   The bartenders and staff were very friendly and responsive. One of the staff was especially helpful and attentive. After some chatting, we found out he was the owner, Colin, just filling in for the night. He is a cool dude - he let us know about the various specials and when there was a mix-up that delayed a couple of our drinks, he comped those drinks. The greatest revelation of the night is that on Saturdays, if you order two cocktails, you get a free pizza. Mind explosion. My memory is a little foggy about which ones we got (one was prosciutto and fig), but they were tasty.   Will definitely be back in some capacity. They have a happy hour with $1 off drinks and a late night Spirit Hour with $2 off spirits / $1 off beer and wine. Southside also has TV's, so it could be a good place to catch a game.   P.S. for the the people commenting on the $13 beer, you probably ordered Hitachino which retails for about $6 for a small bottle. With regular bar markup, $13 is about right.",

The draft beer list is full of glasses at either $5 or $6. Only one is at $13, if memory serves. Most glasses of wine in single digits as well.   The layout is nice, offering plenty of room for multiple groups, and yet it doesn't feel too big just for a twosome. A few TVs are placed strategically around the bar. Plenty of Warriors fans (yes, this is another Bay Area bandwagon time of year, though hopefully one of the folks will be wearing her own Sharks jersey - respeck!) cheering on the Dubs.   Vieux (spelled viex on the menu) Kenner is a steal at $11 because it tastes good, of course, and packs a punch; it's all alcohol. Get it neat rather than on a big block to taste it chilled and not too cold. You want some flavor to come through.  Closing out the tab wasn't easy if not done immediately when receiving the drinks. Anyway, you may need to speak up, way up, at the bar to get your bartender's attention even if Southside doesn't appear busy. My habit of putting down a credit card only if ordering multiple rounds works against me here. When just buying one round, I pay with cash, unless it's work T&amp;E. Why isn't this more common?",

I mean, yeah I GUESS that means you get this.\" \u00a0So, even after saying yes, there was no indication on what/how we order said pizza and we were left sort of guessing about what was next. \u00a0We flagged down the second bartender and asked the same question, got a similar response that resembled rolled eyes and heavy sighs, but was pointed to the back of the menu where we could choose which pizza we wanted. \u00a0Ultimately we ordered it, it came out, it was actually pretty delicious, and reasonably sized for two people to share. \u00a0Naturally our friends caught on to the idea and before you know it, Southside had to pump out 3 more pizzas for our group of friends. \u00a0My thoughts on the whole thing: Don't get mad about something that's on your menu, bro. \u00a0The most awesome thing here is their cassette tape wall. \u00a0Super hipster, but so cool at the same time.  So, the main takeaway here is that the whole idea of this place is good. \u00a0The cocktails are priced for SOMA/FiDi, and this free pizza incentive is amazing. \u00a0That being said, the attitude of the bartenders here really need to change. \u00a0We might be back if we're i the area and in the mood for cocktails + pizza.",

The happy hour was nice and took a $1 off our drinks. We didn't order any food, but I will definitely come back to this bar.",

Experimental cocktails, to-die for pizza and truffle tater tots, and a round of Jenga to kill time whilst enjoying good company you have with you. Best of all, you can't pass up their Jager shot and glass of beer on the menu. Look for it! Oh, don't mind me, but they have Snake Bite beer in a bottle. Trust.

I think my SF world-weary friend sent me in this direction after tiring of listening to me complain about my meal. Ever the old-time friend, he knows that a surefire way to shut me up is to get a good beverage in me. The cocktail of the evening was the Maiden Lane, a delightful blend of bourbon, strawberries, ginger beer, and lemon juice. Yes, I said 'delightful' when describing a bourbon drink. Somewhere in Kentucky, a burly man is anxious to beat me up. This drink would be worth it. Because a.) bourbon and b.) strawberries! Seriously? Yes. It's the perfect blend of tough and tender. Bourbon (just the word, not even the drink) will always be manly but when you pair it with a multitude of muddled strawberries...? Joy. In a glass. Imbibed many many times.  It's a good thing the vibe is so relaxed here. Between that, the drinks and the low-to-the-ground ottoman I was sitting on, upward/forward motion was something that just wasn't going to occur any time soon. Good for groups, come sit and stay a while in a craft cocktail bar that feels like home. Food? I can't say anything about that because 1.) my stomach was already full of bad decisions and 2.) who comes to a bar to eat (and then complains about it)?",

It was an unspoken understanding. Noise was not missing. Almost too loud to talk.  Drinks were better. Ramble On (gin, lime, homemade blueberry basil syrup) and Maiden Lane (bourbon, strawberries, lime juice, ginger beer) were enjoyable.  Bartenders making them might have woken up on the wrong side of the bed. Menu with clever references and cassette tape wall art had more personality.

The vibe on a Friday night was lively, seemed like a good after work crowd. Their location is easy within the SoMa area. Now on to the real star of the joint - the drinks.   SSH offers a fantastic cocktail menu which doesn't surprise me one bit as Leilani knows her stuff in the mixology department. Being the whiskey gal that I am, I opted for the Caged Heat: whiskey, lemon, cardamom, tamarind (grabbed my attention), &amp; ghost pepper. A little spice makes everything nice. This drink was everything I hoped it would be &amp; not sweet. I just can't do sweet drinks. I was also able to sip the Resurrection &amp; Maiden Lane. Both were equally as good as mine. \u00a0  Unfortunately I wasn't able to try any of their delicious food because we had dinner reservations.

Now about that pizza...Something about it, I think it was the sauce, didn't taste the way pizza should. As an \"eat this so I don't get too tipsy too fast\" substance it's fine - but I wouldn't say it's overly enjoyable to eat. The Mission pizza lacked the truffle flavor we all expected (but was heavy on the onion) and the Twin Peaks left everyone -whelmed. Not over, not under, just whelmed. Taste comments aside, I openly admit that the size is decent for the price. I ordered two to share with my table of friends and it was a decent snack for all.

Due to circumstances I've actually wound up here twice in the last week, and both times the new bartenders were snappy and rude. The first time I came in and tried to order the Dia De Los Muertos- they were out of guava. Then i asked the bartender if he could still make the Hooker's boot (see previous review), and his response was : \"I'm new here so I have no idea how to make that.\" Ooookkaaayyy, can you ask someone? I'm pretty sure I'm not the first/ last person to ask for this drink, and as a former bartender I would have offered to try to replicate it or ask the patron what kind of drink they like. Honestly these SOMA bartenders parade around like mixologists, but a true mixologist would be able to make any drink, on the fly, or invent something equally delicious to make someone happy. Frustrated, I asked for a Trumer...they were out. Finally I got a Kellerwies from Sierra Nevada. At this point my co-worker chimes in and makes a comment about the beer and mr. salty bartender asks if he's tried it. Co worker starts to reply he is from Chico and MSB replies \"what is that supposed to mean?\" Um, Sierra Nevada is from Chico bro.  Fast- forward to last night. Company happy hour. Our group arrives and someone who was assigned to be our server comes up, introduces himself, and says we can order from him or at the bar. I decide to order at the bar and as soon as I get my drink another salty bartender rudely snaps \"you know you have a server, right?\" From that point on I ordered from our server (who was really nice btw).  I know I'm not alone in this feeling since others remarked they also had salty experiences here. This place is not going to suffer- there's plenty of tech companies and fi-di firms in the area to keep them busy, but as for the monthly company happy hour we'll be going elsewhere from now on.",

I came here with a large group of about 15 people and it was so difficult to converse among my peeps from across our table. I guess I wouldn't mind such a loud atmosphere if I had been expecting it and it was later in the night. I had not been here before and didn't realize it's not really that great for large groups that want to actually talk to each other.   These specialty drinks were soo good and the staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. I had emailed to reserve a table 2 days before and they hooked us up with a very nice, lounge-y table - plenty of seating for a large crowd. I even got a personalized reserved seating label for...\"Chanelle.\" Oh yeah, that's me -Pretty fancy, huh? They even let us pay and/or open a tab individually instead of one large tab. They really go out of their way to ensure you have a great time. Happy hour means you get $1 off your drink. They also have a late night happy hour.

Apparently people steal them so if you want the cool cup with your drink (not to take home), you must front your ID at the bar as collateral (which of course I was game for).   Their food menu is pretty amazing. Our waitress recommended a margherita flat bread which is not on the menu and it was probably the best thing That Should Be on the menu.   I'm not sure how often this happens but there was a new, local vodka company promoting their product by giving out free vodka shots (Seven Still of SF). Who can pass that up? Really cool if they promote local companies like that.   Lastly, I could not find this place at first so if you are planning an outing here, it's right next to Kate O'Brien's on Howard at 2nd.",

I looked at the selection of beer they had and it was a very weak selection to start off in the first place unless they are more of a strong alcohol type of lounge/bar. The food does not look to amusing either. The beer selection they had as well was pretty expensive which was another thing that was lame. The place inside looks very nice that I have to give to them which I likes the most. There was a weird smell by where I was sitting like old towels that have been used multiple times to clean up a mess. I would not come here again but if you would like to come here to just chill and have a drink then it will not be a bad place to go but just remember to not go to crazy paying for the drinks here since it is a very limited selection and a bit pricy since you can get a shot instead for the price of the beer they sell.",

Autumn / Winter Old Fashion - Super smooth, with a hint of bitters, and a hit of sweetness, from I believe the maple syrup. I had a black cherry in my drink and I thought it was absolutely delicious.  They have a good selection of beers too.  Tater Tots are yummy, as are the flatbreads / pizzas. The food is a bit on the pricier side, I thought they were worth it!   It can get pretty crowded here. There is bar seating, and a few tables.

Awesome! \u00a0 It's very spacious inside, and they have lots of bar top tables that were open. \u00a0We ended up at a table with a house made Jenga set, and it kept us pretty entertained during our entire time there.  I was excited about all their cocktails, but I was disappointed when the bartender told me they couldn't customize one of the drinks because they're batched. I feel like a place like this should be making all their drinks individually as they're ordered??  - Ramble On: fresh blueberry, gin, lime, basil - not as sweet as it looks, good for summer - Maiden Lane: also great for summer with fresh strawberries and ginger beer to balance out the sweetness - Resurrection: I like drinks with peppers, so the serrano was great with the kiwi, cilantro, and green chartreuse - Triumphant: whiskey, tequila, with 2 kinds of bitters - Kentucky Stone Sour: the egg white was a little too stiff, but the combination of wild turkey and amaretto was otherwise good - Manhattan: slightly sweeter than I like, otherwise pretty standard  We also randomly added on a truffle pizza. \u00a0I know - random, right? \u00a0The reason we ended up here was because my friends had come across some free pizza special in the past, but they don't do it anymore :( \u00a0The flatbread wasn't amazing, but in the setting of many drinks, it was pretty good.  Drinks were good, but like I said, I would have preferred if they could better customize the drinks rather than batching them. \u00a0Otherwise, it's a good low key place.",

Alcohol is clearly labeled by type, with a heavy selection of whiskeys (obvi, especially if it's their \"daily soup\" afterall!). My friend and I ordered our drinks (Big Daddy IPA and Powers on the rocks, or, rock to be exact), and the bartender promptly joked with us that we had 2 of the most surly drinks ever.

It was chill, pleasantly populated and the sun was shining in through the open windows. We ordered cocktails (happy hour 'til 7) and got a free pizza to go along with them (free pizza with two signature cocktails on Saturdays).   The drinks were excellently made. I despise sweet drinks, so I stay away from most cocktails with fruit in them. My friend got a strawberry cocktail and I had a sip, and I have to say it was sublime. It was like tasting childhood afternoons by the beach (I'm from Hawaii). The fruit flavor was excellent and it was not at all sugary.  Of course, I rather liked my whiskey drink.  Pours were huge. They use those Champagne coups I love, however the ones they use are nearly double the size of the ones at Tradition and Rickhouse. And they're filled up nicely.  The mezcal Negroni was substantial.  Onto the pizza, we ordered the one with squash flowers and burrata. It was large; enough for two. The bartender even asked if we wanted another, since we ordered four drinks. We said no, because we were full, but I suspect that is somewhat unforgivable of us.  Anyway, Southside Spirit House (on a mellow night) has won my heart. Highly recommended.",

We had ourselves the deviled eggs, Mission pizza, and another ... pizza (I can't recall at the moment, and I can't seem to access the food menu on the website).

Like many of the new bars popping up around SF the interior has a hip modern vibe with high tables and chairs, plus booths, benches, and stools.  Cocktails are inventive and I love the use of fresh fruit and fun garnishes - especially since they're a good $11 - $13 each. Happy hour gets you $1 off drinks and runs until 7pm.  Food was decent too and I'd describe it as upscale bar food. As your typical starving worker after a long day we ordered truffled tater tots (with parmesan and garlic) - $8 for a small bucket, flatbread pizzas - $15 for 12\", and deviled eggs - $6 for 3.   Located on Howard between 1st and 2nd, this place is frequented by the typical FiDi crowd.",

I was here for the night before a friend's wedding so we had a lot of people, and it was a Friday and so to be expected there were a ton of other people there and NOWHERE to sit. I think an example of a Bar / Restaurant that does this RIGHT is the Phoenix out in the Mission . There are always places to sit for people just drinking , as well for the dining patrons.

Within a few blocks from my humble abode, I'm able to indulge in the finest of the couture cocktail movement - Local Edition, Rickhouse, Novela, Bloodhound, and House of Shields are all within stumbling (home) distance and all craft a solid cocktail. But only Southside Spirit House is my everything. It's never too crowded or overrun with fraternity types, the bartenders are cool and kind, and I feel just as comfortable bringing in a group of friends or a date as I do sidling up to the bar, solitary. You can kick it or kick back, depending on your mood.  Unlike a few spots I can think of, the bartenders don't give you the side-eye when you ask for something that isn't featured on the cocktail menu (read: zero attitude). And if you're not boozing, SSH has put together a decent craft beer list including my favorite, Hitachino White, as well as a small but thoughtful wine list.   Hungry? The kitchen stays open 'til 1am every night which has saved me a couple of times... think casual American fare like flatbread pizzas, cheese and charcuterie plates, and sliders.

    "review_text": "The last four digits of Southside Spirit House's number spells L-U-S-H. Any place that has \"Lush\" in their number, I'm immediately a fan of.  Apparently, so are a lot of people because Southside Spirit House was CRACKING last Friday during happy hour!  Formerly Eve, Southside has transformed into a low-key bar/lounge with a Western ambiance: wooden furnishings, wooden bar, buffalo paintings, wooden floors and wooden tables (I miss the sultry vibe of Eve). It reminded me a bit of John Colins except with a ton of communal tables and several flat screen TVs. Come to later find out that Southside is actually the sister bar of John Colins (they also owned Eve).  Although Southside did away with Eve's clubby-ness, they do have DJs spinning Motown at night. No more hip hop (BOO!) so they'll probably attract a different kind of crowd on the weekends than what Eve use to.   All artisan cocktails are $11. During happy hour (Monday - Friday 3 pm to 7 pm), it's a $1 off and during \"spirit hours\" (Monday - Friday 11 pm-2 am), it's $2 off.   Cocktail menu: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F13m41Ps&amp;s=a50f41d48de0b7da623d7a661192da5b49e2bcaec2ddc9ad9c7880f22e072110\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/13m41Ps</a>  I got the Ramble On ($11): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F12k81o0&amp;s=d9ef497d21b07137f4094fb9d1cd53447c5a36b285d50f8da918a264b36bf559\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/12k81o0</a> which is perfect for gin lovers especially if you like blueberries. It was a bit on the weak side for me but then again, \u00a0I'm a huge lush and I like my cocktails extra stiff.   Sadly, it was too crowded to try anything on their food menu ($6-$12) but they totally had me at Truffle Popcorn, Steak Tartare, Beer Braised Corned Beef and Flat Bread Pizza! I will have to try their food next time especially since the kitchen closes at 1 am; just in time for sloshed eats!  Food menu: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F16sHxlJ&amp;s=ee538da99331b1659fed338c3be14ebdd584ba15c420e898da2d6e222131abc9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/16sHxlJ</a>  Ladies, it's a total cockfest in there with a lot of well-dressed lads. Not that I was looking...just merely an observation.  Pro-tip: The tilted mirror above the bar will give you an aerial view of the crowd. Don't get caught creeping now! \u00a0;)",

We arrived at 9:40pm on a Friday night to kill an hour and change before a movie at the Metreon. The good- nice ambiance, busy but not crowded. A fantastic long ceiling/wall mirror lets you people-watch discreetly without being creepy.   Unfortunately the good stops there. The drink we ordered (Hooker's Boot) tries to be everything at once- sweet, smoky, spicy- and ends up being too much and as subtle as, well, a boot to the face. For the price there are much better drinks in the city.  The worst is that we almost didn't get our food. We ordered sliders at 9:55pm. At 10:45pm, the sliders still have not arrived and we need to go to watch our movie. Only after much prodding of the harried waitstaff do we finally get our food- nearly an hour after we ordered them. The bar was busy but not overly so. There really was no excuse for the wait. Either pare down your menu, increase your staff, or simply stop serving food.",

I found the price to be very reasonable too (12 USD, for two people). If you come in with a large group you might wanna sit on the sofa on the corner, which is pretty cozy. The low lighting is also key to create the intimate vibe.   I'd say this is a place for the ones looking for a low-key night of good food, drinks and conversation.",

Needing to drive home later in the evening, I limited myself to the Maiden Lane and the Ramble On. And while the former was a tad bitter, and the latter a bit too sweet, both were still rather enjoyable.  The crowd here is a fairly good mix of your usual SoMA types, and the ambient noise does get pretty high up there when the place gets packed. And, though the cocktail list and the decor of the place would suggest a venue more akin to a lounge, I couldn't help but get a certain pub vibe the entire night - neither a positive nor a negative, just an observation. A solid 3.5 stars.  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - While the venue itself is easily navigable, most, if not all, of the tables here were either too low (coffee tables), or too high (bar/counter height). But, if you're only using them for drink placement, then it's not a huge deal.  Bathroom - Accessible!",

Cons: - You might die if you drink here.  - $20 card minimum (3 drinks).   Walked in here at 1:00 am yesterday, on Friday night, for a final drink of \u00a0the evening because it was close to the Marriott where I was staying. \u00a0  The venue itself has potential to not suck - there was a mediocre DJ playing, an area for dancing, ample seating + booth seating good for groups toward the back, and an impressive array of liquor behind the bar. \u00a0Not surprisingly though, the place was relatively dead (especially for a Friday night) and the people who were there effectively accomplished giving the place a weird, old-dude vibe. \u00a0Not feeling it.   The purpose of this review was to lament the appalling and abhorrently irresponsible service I received at the end of the night. Come 1:40 am, the lights lifted and the staff began their efforts to round everyone up. We had already purchased 2 drinks for $14 but needed to order a final drink to meet the $20 minimum requirement. \u00a0I asked for a Screwdriver, thinking it would be a drink that we could easily share and consume quickly. The bartender informs me that she can't serve me a mixed drink, but offers a shot instead (I assumed this was due to a time consideration - they were trying to get people out after all). So, I ask for an oj back with my shot. I'm told I can't have juice, as it's been put away (under the bar where it always is? Perhaps you should keep out the items needed to service your customers while you're still open...), but I'm offered a soda back and I concede. This woman is in such an all-fired rush to get people out so that she can get off at 2 o'clock on the dot that she negligently hands me a glass of coke that is hot, un-rinsed, and full of chemical sanitizer.

I also tell myself I'm too old to eat Pops with chocolate milk, but I still do. What Southside Spirit House offers is a combination of classiness with funsies! Yes, I didn't know what other word to use. Enjoy incredible old school hip hop while sipping on contemporary cocktails while playing Jenga! Yes, yes and yes! I literally could stay here forever.   Although I only had 1 or 2 drinks here for an hour or so, the time and experience I had is enough to make me want to come back here. The drink I had was super unique. I can't recall the name or exactly what goes inside it but I remember it tasting like Tom Yum Soup topped with whipped egg whites. Not the best tasting drink but my friend's fresh strawberry lemonade and whiskey tasted uh-mazing! Drag the \"uh\" out for a 21 year old blonde girl sound effect.   SSH also had other games like trivia and what not and I didn't stay around long enough but I saw a DJ setting up and what looks like a small dance floor towards the front. If the current music was at all an indication of what to come, I give the music 2.75 thumbs up! Nothing more refreshing than old school hip hop in an era drowned out by fist-pumping electro-spinning raver-friend music.   If you're looking for a relaxing and enjoyable time, head to SSH.

I LOVE that they had the Giants game on, which made it a little less \"after work\" and a little more \"San Francisco.\"  Drinks here are pretty strong, and decent. I was swayed by their White Manhattan, and HOLY VODKA batman! This thing was like Vodka on ice, with a splash of bitters.   In the midst of our drinking, my friends (ok, really me) was tempted by their pork belly sliders...so I ordered one. The flavor of it was pretty good, but I wish they seared the belly fat a little longer. I got more mushy lard than that delicious crisp that you can get with belly meat. It came with some pickled veg, which really helped cut the fat.   Overall, I like this place. They had random games (Would You Rather, Jenga, etc) on the tables for fun.

I didn't know it used to be something else, but as Southside Spirit House, they serve little bites and great cocktails. They have long tables conducive to large parties, and are cool with you bringing your own desserts and snacks to share. Their cocktails seem pretty reasonably priced for being in SF and they have good service.  It was crowded and happening, but never so crowded you felt claustrophobic. They even have nice bathrooms, very themed ... I liked the ambiance overall and would not mind coming back!",

    "review_text": "Southside Spirit House's packed with people during happy house. It's kinda of hard to find a table, but there's plenty of tables around. Just gotta stand around a bit and wait for someone to leave.  == Food and Drinks ==  Pineapple express flatbread pizza tasted pretty good.  Maiden Lane and Ramble On. Ramble On is a blueberry gin drink which tasted great. Definitely would recommend the Ramble On. Maiden Lane is strawberry, whiskey, and ginger beer. For some reason, it tasted like cough syrup.  == Service ==  Order at the bar, get a number, and servers will come with the food.   == Overall ==  Great place to hit up for happy hour for a good meal and some drinks.",
