    "review_text": "This is one of the oldest bar in North Beach. Built in 1942, this bar is a favorite hangout for the old-school and newer generation Italians. The bar has 15 beers on tap with family-members bartending &amp; serving, cool music, a pair of billiard tables and entertaining locals with a ton of priceless and nostalgic stories of North Beach of the yester-years. Where North Beach once was the epicenter for the Italians. I love to hear stories of old North Beach. But unfortunately, North Beach is beginning to be an area for the younger generation who could care less about the past and care about getting drunk immediately.  With the bar's pair of of billiard tables, every Mondays and Wednesdays the bar has a pool tournament. One of my co-worker's best friend, who is also a regular Gino and Carlos patron, is one of 64 players involve in the tournament. I was there earlier tonight and she was one of eight remaining hustlers. Yes, she is that good. The entrance fee is $25.00 and the grand prize is a pair of airplane tickets to Las Vegas with hotel and car rental included. That's is not bad for $25.00 for the entrance fee, but you have to be a really good pool-shark.   While she was playing, at the bar I ordered a Sea Breeze. For $4.00 the cocktail comprised with parts cranberry juice, grapefruit juice and vodka. Frank, one of the family members and bartender, used Ketel-one Vodka for my cocktail and he didn't skimp on the higher-end vodka either. One sip of the potent cocktail has changed my mood completely. I was sipping on my cocktail and sadly saw my co-worker's friend lost and being eliminated from the tournament. Maybe I jinxed her. I hope not. \" Hey, I'm just being my Joe Cool-self and chatting to and listening with the regulars!\"   Other the priceless stories of the neighborhood, I was told that the bar has great lunch specials on Thursdays. With a slice of Prime-rib or Petrale sole with sides of salad and pasta and a glass of wine for $20.00. If I comeback during the midday, I might try that one day. I hear stories about famous personalities dominating North Beach. I hope one day that the newer generation will hear stories from Joe Cool.",

BTW this is a bar were the local off duty SFPD officers hangout before heading home. Another reason why I come by to chat and laugh a little.  Ambiance: Neighborhood divey bar were there are plenty of kith around. You don't need to dress all flashy showing up in style and wearing you best clothing from the closet. Here it's all about who you know and how you carry yourself. Don't expect hipsters or gadget geeks to be around here. What it is about mostly 50+ crowd locals with kids in college or started their own family, plenty of time on hand. There's really not much to say just your standard bar with jukebox,pool tables,flat screens everyone sitting at counter talking to Frankie sometimes he can bust out a joke from within. It's probably onevbofvthe quietest bar due to it's client lifestyle.   Staff: I always deal with Frankie so I can't say much only that he can get in your face if there are political issues arises.   Cleanliness: It's a divey place that has it's time since the 1940's so don't expect neon color lights or any high tech gadgets around, if you do, turn around and leave.  Eats/Drinks: I get numerous assorted drinks price range from $3.75-$6.50. My favorite cassidy mist is always my drink of choice made with maker's mark. Pizza I just grab from next door GB pizza and bring it over. Apps are serve in sizes of medium only, may order two and combine it.  Products: Full bar and finger food apps.   Punch Lines: North beach,old timers,divey,quiet/average,pool tables,jukebox,ATM,TV,street parking,many different ethnic around,no hipster appeal.  Tradeoffs: You come here for good laughs and to relax from a full day of hard work, leave the past behind you.  Final Thoughts: Cheapest place in NB neighborhood to get a drink and share some good times with old buddy's. You better be a local or else hard stares and slight pulse will be encounter. Italian nostalgia places and feel is getting less and less these days, this place stays in place through out the times and it shows, stop by find out for yourself.",

Pool table and flat screens. Seems like a good spot to watch a sporting event.   The prices are great and the people behind the bar are friendly. Its a good spot, nothing special but a solid place to grab a drink or two.

As a natural \"lister\" I can tell you that I'm aware of a number of fabulous places in the NB bar scene- and Gino &amp; Carlo was definitely not on that list! My boyfriend insisted we go here, as its one of his favorite dive bars. (Don't get me wrong- I dig dives!)  The atmosphere was fun- a nice mix of folks, and the bartenders are incredibly friendly (or so I was told, since a girlfriend of mine left with a #).   HOWEVER, did you really just charge me $6 for a vodka tonic that comes in the glass the size of a my pinky?!?!? I swear to you, this was the SMALLEST vodka tonic I'd ever received for the price. Especially since girlfriend got hers for free! Come on! I'm cute too! Is it because I'm obviously with this dude next to me that mine is more expensive? Are you charging me for her drink essentially? NOT COOL! (I'm just complaining to complain at this point.)  It was a fun place to go, but I think I'll leave it as \"his place\" and find my own little niche in North Beach. :)",

Well, nowhere I can think of so I picked a bar that opens at 6AM instead.  Now, I am not one to go on 6AM drinking sprees, so it is important to note that this is the only bar in the city that I have ever chosen to partake in a 6AM drink.   Oh, I love this place. It has been around as long as I have twofold. It has pool tables, good music, all of the North Beach regulars, food, sports leagues, strong drinks, great bloody marys (for the 6AM visits) and character.  This bit of conversation, as told by AD Winans, between himself and Charles Bukowski (Hank to his friends) seems just like the sort of conversations that have been going on here for years and will likely continue for years to come. This is why I love this bar;  \"Hank and I entered Gino and Carlo's bar, where we found Cheap Charlie lying on the floor in a drunken stupor. \u00a0Cheap Charlie had gotten his name because of his mooching free drinks at North Beach bars. \u00a0Hank and I looked at Aldino, who was leaning over the body of Cheap Charlie and pouring whiskey through a funnel down Cheap Charlie's throat, as the patrons cheered \u00a0on the action.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are all the poets in this area crazy?\" \u00a0 Hank asked. \"Not all of them,\" I said.\"",

That said, nothing about the bar impressed me.   After waiting kind of a long time at the bar's designated ordering spot, I was greeted by a relatively unfriendly bartender. The beer menu said they had Fat Tire on tap. So I ordered one. Oh, nope, turns out they changed out some of their regular beers for the Festival. So no Fat Tire. Hmm. I saw a bottle of Stoli Blueberry, so I ordered a Stoli Blueberry and Tonic. Turns out they were out of Stoli Blueberry. I ordered my friend a Stoli Raspberry and Cranberry. But they were out of Stoli Raspberry. I ended up with a straight vodka tonic; he had a vodka cranberry. Each drink was $6 and came in a pathetically small clear PLASTIC cup. Apparently they didn't feel like washing actual glasses for the festival. Or maybe we just didn't warrant actual glass, as I did see some real glasses on the bar.  The drinks were fine, but for the price, I felt they were too small by a half and mine certainly wasn't strong enough. I understand that this is most likely a bar where people come to chill out and many customers are regulars (and probably a lot older than me), and that the festival causes an influx of non-regulars, but shit. Come on.   Also, my friend was not impressed with what he saw on their internet jukebox, and a bar with bad music is...well, it's just not where I want to spend my money.   I will probably go back eventually, more because I want to go to a couple other bars in the area and because I think Gino &amp; Carlo's sign warrants a second visit, but if next time my experience isn't exponentially better than the first, this bar will definitely be on my \"pass\" list. The rundown wooden interior was half-awesome and half-trashy, and I guess I need another experience at this place to make a final judgment.",

You'll probably run into Carol Doda on a bar stool with five old guys around her... there might be a guy in the corner with a fedora on - straight outta the God Father... a couple of hipsters in another corner eating some Golden Boy... some passionate pool-players - a whole bunch of random people that don't really look like they would party together. \u00a0It's an eclectic mix of personalities but that is part of what makes it great. \u00a0A true dive, but the best of the best!  What it isn't: pretentious, a place to see and be seen and there is nothing Marina about it.",

I came here with my buddy Douglas to have a afternoon Happy Hour Cocktail and we were greeted by Dick the bartender, who was ever so entertaining....he sang to use along with the jukebox. Which by the is very classy. Dick had also invited us to his show, he was performing with Carol Doda. How cool was that....!!  I just love the vibe....you got the old timers and the wise guys playing pool and having a brew on mid afternoon. Also its a great place to hear stories of San Francisco and what was going on back in the days at Gino &amp; Carlo Cocktail Lounge.....Its Historical!",

Everyone in there was just having the best time, joking with the bartender, playing dice at the bar. It really felt like there was a community that was based around it, and although we weren't part of that community, I am glad I was able to witness it first hand.   Downsides: All their pool cues were 21oz, and the mixed drink glasses were a little small.",
